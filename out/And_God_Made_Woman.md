“And the Lord God said: It is not good that the man should be alone: I will make a help for him. And the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man, and he slept: and He took one of his ribs, and closed up the place with flesh instead thereof. And the rib, which the Lord God had taken from the man, made He a woman, and brought her unto the man. And the man said: This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh; **SHE SHALL BE CALLED WOMAN**, because she was taken out of man.” — **Genesis 2:18**, **21** – **23**

From time immemorial, evil has existed in our world.

When the Almighty said, “**Let there be light**,” it shrouded itself in darkness. Yet it continued to be. When it saw its opportunity, it made itself known when the serpent slithered up the tree in Paradise. It hissed its words of rebellion in the ears of Eve. After Adam and Eve were banished from the Garden, it returned to the darkness, but its influence remained within the heart of man, even to this day.

How do I know this?

It told me.

Knocking on the door of Dr. and Mrs. Keane, I looked around at their neighborhood. The Keanes lived in an affluent suburb of our city, surrounded by large houses, verdant gardens, and well kept lawns. Dr. and Mrs. Keane were close friends of my parents, so I volunteered to babysit their twin sons while they attended a function in honor of one of Dr. Keane’s colleagues. As I daydreamed about one day living in this suburb with a family of my own, Mrs. Keane answered the door.

“Hadassa,” she said. “Please, come in.”

“Hello, Mrs. Keane,” I replied. “I hope I’m not late.”

“No,” Mrs. Keane smiled. “You’re right on time. I’ll go upstairs and get Mr. Keane. Make yourself at home.”

“Thank you.”

I entered the living room from the foyer and I sat down on the couch. Unbuttoning my coat, I took it off as I laid my handbag to the side. The Keanes’ home was warm and comfortable. As I sat on the couch and waited for the Keanes, I looked around at their décor. An ornate frame holding the family portrait hung above the fireplace, the mantelpiece of which displayed various photographs of family and friends. An antique Crucifix hung high above the doorway to the living room, while a painting of the Madonna and Child was hung on the wall to its left.

While I was looking around the house, I heard footsteps descending the staircase and I looked over to the doorway to see Dr. and Mrs. Keane standing there.

“How are you, Hadassa?” Dr. Keane asked.

“I’m OK, Dr. Keane,” I answered. “How are you?”

“I’m doing well,” Dr. Keane said. Turning to his wife, he asked, “Are you ready?”

“I have to get my furs,” Mrs. Keane answered. “I’ll be ready in a minute.”

After retrieving her fur coat from the closet, Mrs. Keane was helped by her husband as she told me everything I needed to know to babysit for them that evening.

“The boys have already been put to bed,” she said. “They should sleep through the night. The phone number for the venue is on the refrigerator. Help yourself to anything you would like. We’ll try to be back by midnight.”

“Is there anything else, Mary?” Dr. Keane asked.

“No. . . .” Mrs. Keane pondered for a moment. Exclaiming, “Oh,” she continued, “If the boys wake up in the night, they should be able to go back to sleep by themselves, but if you need anything, please call us. The phone numbers for their pediatrician and the hospital are below the number for the venue.”

“I understand,” I said. “Have a good time.”

“Thank you,” Mrs. Keane replied.

Mrs. Keane stepped toward the front door while Dr. Keane put on his overcoat.

“Have a good evening, Hadassa,” Dr. Keane winked. “Hopefully those hellions of ours upstairs don’t cause you any trouble.”

Playfully shoving her husband, Mrs. Keane retorted, “They get it from their father.”

Walking out of the house, Dr. Keane waved goodbye before he closed the door behind him.

The clock in the foyer chimed 8 P. M.

For two and a half hours, I studied for my upcoming history exam, as well as talked with my best friend, Annie, on the telephone.

“Are you certain you don’t want me to come over?” Annie asked. “I won’t eat their food. I won’t take your money. I’ll be good.”

“Yes, I’m certain,” I laughed. “I’ve known the Keanes since I was little. They’re a good family. I’ll be fine.”

“Aren’t you bored?”

“A little,” I answered. “But boring is good with toddlers.”

“Well, if you’re certain. . . .” Annie trailed off as I heard a loud thud from upstairs.

“Oh,” I exclaimed. “I’ve got to go. I have to check the boys.”

After I ended my telephone call, I walked into the foyer, looking up at the second floor from the bottom of the stairs. I stood still to better hear if the twins made any noise.

There was another loud thud.

*What was that?*

I started walking up the stairs when I was startled by three knocks at the front door. Recomposing myself, I turned around and I walked to the front door. I peeked through the side window to see a woman standing on the porch. She was dressed in a black coat with her wavy red hair partially covered by a matching black hat. She was beautiful, ethereally beautiful, as if she were not entirely of this world. Despite her outward beauty, I felt a sense of unease as I continued looking at her, as if something about her was *off*, if not outright *wrong*.  *Who was she?* I opened the door slightly.

“Hello?”

“Hello,” she said. “Who are you?”

“Hadassa Adams,” I answered. “I’m the babysitter. Who are you?”

“I apologize for my manners,” she said. “I should introduce myself, shouldn’t I? I’m Esther Nachtmann, a friend of the Keanes. Isn’t this their house?”

“Dr. and Mrs. Keane didn’t tell me to expect you,” I explained. “I don’t mean to be rude, but why are you here?”

“My car broke down,” she answered. “Thankfully I made it here before it did. I was hoping I could use the telephone to call for a ride.”

Looking back briefly at the living room, I felt that sense of unease slowly become a gnawing sensation in the pit of my stomach.

*What should I do?*

Turning around to face her, I said, “I’m sorry, but I don’t feel comfortable letting a stranger into the Keanes’ home, especially alone with their children upstairs. I hope you understand.”

“Yes, I do,” she assured. “I completely understand. I’d make the same decision if I were you. I’ll walk to the library and use the phone booth there. Have a good evening, Ms. Adams.”

As she nodded her head and turned to walk down the porch steps, I felt a massive wave of guilt wash over me for turning her away. I was conflicted. I did not know her, but she said she was a friend of the Keanes. Yet she could have used a phone booth almost anywhere. Why would she come here to make a telephone call? Perhaps she felt safer going to a friend’s house than a phone booth at 10 P. M.? All of these thoughts swirled around my mind as I recalled a verse from the Torah.

“Love ye therefore the stranger, for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.” — **Deuteronomy 10:19**

I called for her.

“Ms. Nachtmann?”

I heard a voice whisper within me.

*Don’t let her in the house*.

She turned around.

“Yes?”

The voice grew louder.

*Don’t let her in the house*.

“Please, come in,” I said. “I don’t want you to walk to the library at this time of night, especially in the cold.”

The voice was now a scream.

*Don’t let her in the house!*

Against my better judgment, I let her in the house. She smiled as she walked up the steps of the porch and entered the Keanes’ home. Leading her into the living room, I gave her privacy as she made her call, but I could faintly hear her from the foyer.

“OK,” she said. “Goodbye.”

After she ended her call, she stood up from the couch and walked back into the foyer.

“Thank you,” she smiled. “You’re a godsend.”

“It’s nothing. . . .” I trailed off as she interrupted me.

“Not for us,” she said.

*Us?*

“Do you have a ride?”

“Yes,” she answered. “I’ve got to get going. I don’t want to miss them. Thank you again for your help.”

“You’re welcome.”

“Goodbye, Ms. Adams.”

“Goodbye.”

With that, she opened the door and walked outside. Stepping out onto the porch, I looked on until she stepped off the porch and she started walking down the sidewalk. I went back inside and closed the door. Trying to warm myself up, I turned around and I walked into the living room.

The clock in the foyer chimed 10 P. M.

Before I left my house to babysit for the Keanes, I promised my mother I would call her and check in at 10 P. M. Grabbing the receiver, I started to dial my number until I realized there was no dial tone. I tried in vain to fix the telephone, but it was clear it was dead.

Thinking about it, a question came to mind.

*How did she call for a ride?*

It was possible that the telephone died after she made her call, but I remembered further that I did not hear her dialing a phone number. All I heard was her voice as she supposedly talked to whomever she called to take her home.

*What if it was all a lie?*

The receiver dropped from my hands, causing a loud crash as the phone fell to the floor. Slowly, I looked for the telephone wire, which I found ripped out of the wall. I would have heard if she ripped the wire out of the wall. *What was going on?* It was then that the unease I had felt earlier in the evening returned as an all–encompassing sense of dread.

I ran to the foyer to ensure the front door was locked and bolted. Looking out of the windows, I did not see anyone, so I went to lock and bolt the back door in the kitchen. There was no one there, but I felt like I was being watched as I looked out into the night. As I was walking out of the kitchen, I heard an even louder thud from upstairs. *The twins*. I hastily grabbed a large knife from the knife block and I ran to the stairs.

Looking up the stairs, I could see the crescent moon through the window at the landing. When I switched on the light to guide my way, the lightbulb blew and the entire house descended into darkness.

By the light of the moon, I walked as carefully as I could upstairs to the twins’ nursery. I could hear a lullaby, sung by a woman with an almost angelic voice, which distracted me enough that I tripped and sliced my arm with the knife I was holding. Disregarding my wound, I stood up and ran in the direction of the nursery. Opening the door, I was terrified by what I saw.

It was Esther Nachtmann, whoever or whatever she was, her hands rocking the twins’ cradles, singing a lullaby. She appeared to be in some kind of ecstasy as she slowly turned around, opened her eyes, and a fiendish smile appeared on her face.

“Who are you?”

“I am ‘Woman.’”

“What?”

“The Almighty created us both in His image,” she hissed. “Yet I was asked to submit to ‘Man.’ Why would I do that? We were created from the same dust of the ground. When I refused to submit to him, I was expelled for another, whom Man called his ‘Woman.’”

I was vaguely familiar with what she was telling me.

Before I was able to say her name, she shrieked, “Do not call me by those foul names of men. They were given to me by the Fallen Ones. I am Woman, not because I was taken out of Man, but because I was created with him.”

“What are you doing?”

“I have waged war against Man and his Woman since the beginning of time,” she answered. “Since she is the ‘Mother of All Living,’ I am against all of her children.”

She abruptly stopped rocking both of the cradles.

The twins did not stir.

Without a word, she snatched the Keanes’ sons as they slept. I tried to run to rescue them from her, but I was held back by an unseen force, which brought me to my knees.

“Please, don’t hurt them,” I implored. “Please.”

After a pregnant pause, she asked, “Would you give your life for theirs?”

“Yes,” I cried. Wiping tears from my eyes, I begged, “Please, don’t hurt them. Take me.”

She pondered for a moment, but shook her head.

“No,” she answered. “The Man and his Woman and their Children took everything from me. I must take everything from them.”

In a flash of light, she showed me her true form. She was ‘Woman,’ ancient and mysterious, covered in the blood from eons of victims, her long red tresses flowing around her body. In each arm, she held one of the twins. She was holding them while she held her hands deftly over the twins’ noses and mouths, draining them of every breath, until they slowly stopped struggling. I held my hand to my mouth in abject horror.

With a scream like a hawk in the night, she leapt out of the window behind her, holding onto the twins’ lifeless and limp bodies by their feet.

I ran desperately to the window, but she and the twins were gone. Walking away from the window, I saw there was nothing in the cradles except specks of blood and torn linens.

I screamed as loudly as I could before I fainted.

My memories of the aftermath are like flashbulbs from a camera. Dr. and Mrs. Keane came home, Mrs. Keane found me face down at the foot of the stairs, unconscious and covered in blood, Dr. Keane discovered the bloodied knife in his sons’ empty nursery, the police, EMTs, my parents, the questioning, the twins’ disappearance and my injuries being attributed to a burglary gone awry, Dr. and Mrs. Keane moving away, and my family’s decision to stay after the close of the investigation.

Although I was never a suspect in the twins’ disappearance, I will always blame myself for their deaths. When I was sixteen, I felt I was headed to the top of the world. I was ready to graduate high school and go to college. Get married. Have a family. None of that mattered after that night. Fifty years later, I am a shell of who I once was. What I look forward to now is my next drink. I am an alcoholic, but I want neither sympathy nor help. I want to finally forget that night by drinking myself into the grave.

She was true to her word.
