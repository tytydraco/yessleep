I used to think the worst part of my job was the blood.

The stink of it—thick, metallic—clinging to my clothes clogging my nostrils. It soaks into everything—wood, concrete, carpet, skin. You scrub it off, bleach the scene, pretend nothing ever happened.

But doesn’t lie. It leaves stains, no matter how hard you try to erase them. It tells a story, even when no one don't want to listen.

Yet, it's not the worst part, the worst it 's the silence.

The kind that settles over a room after something awful has happened. The kind that lingers in the halls of the association, where questions are met with blank stares and shrugs. The first thing you learn here—don’t ask, don’t pry, just clean up and move on.

And that's what I do. I clean—in silence.

Before, I could follow the blood, chase the truth, let my instinct lead the way. Now I wipe up messes I’m not allowed to understand. I scrub bloodstains from places they shouldn’t be, haul away bodies that don’t make sense, and swallow down every urge to ask what the hell I’m looking at. They tell us what we need to know.

And apparently,  I don’t need to know much.

Things weren’t always like this. I used to be a cop once. Homicide. A damn good one! A guy who could  step into a crime scene and see the story written in the scuff marks, piece together a moment from the way a chair was knocked over. I lived for the chase, the puzzle, the hunt.

That was the problem. I saw too much. Asked the wrong questions. Dug into a case that should’ve stayed buried.

And after that—I wasn’t a cop anymore.

No trial, no headlines. Just a quiet conversation in a dimly lit room, a choice laid out in front of me. Walk away, forget everything, or take a job where my skills would be “better utilized”.

I wasn't recruited. The Association doesn’t do that. It absorbs. It advises, it warns.

People like me—people who see too much, ask the wrong questions—we don’t get to walk away. They make sure of that. We become janitors for the things that don’t belong in police reports.

It was a Thursday. The day my life changed for good.

The call came around noon. Nothing unusual—another stiff in a part of town where bodies turned up like cigarette butts in a gutter.

I remember the rain. Light, steady, the kind that runs the city into a smear of neon and diesel fumes. I was sitting in my car, sipping bad coffee, when dispatch cracked over the radio.

“Unit 4-2, we’ve got a DB at 11th and Mercer. Male, mid-thirties, possible OD. Patrol’s already on the scene, you’re up.”

I sighed, flicked my cigarette out the window—another nobody who went out with a needle in his arm, alone in some piss-stained alley.

Routine. Or at least that's what I thought.

I pulled up ten minutes later, to the address dispatch had given me, a crumbling tenement on the southside of town—the kind of place where the streetlights flickered and the air stank of piss and stale beer. The building sagged under its own neglect, windows boarded up, graffiti scrawled over every inch of exposed brick.

A couple of patrol officers loitered near the entrance, their rain-slick uniforms catching the dim glow of a nearby streetlamp. One of them, a kid with a buzz cut and dead eyes, nodded in my direction as I stepped out of my car.

“Detective.” I didn’t recognize him, but that wasn’t unusual. Beat cops rotated through these areas like bad weather.

“What’ve we got?”  I asked, pulling my coat tighter against the drizzle.

Buzz Cut shrugged. “A junkie. Some squatters found him and called it in. No witnesses, no suspects, same old song and dance.”

I followed him inside. The stairwell reeked of mildew and old piss, and my boots stuck slightly to the floor with each step. Water dripped somewhere in the distance, the slow plink plink plink echoing through the hollowed out building.

“Any idea who he was?”

“Not yet,” Buzz Cut said. “No wallet, no ID. We’ll see if his prints get a hit.”

He led me to a room on the second floor, of what used to be an apartment before time and neglect turned it into a husk. The door had been kicked in long ago, the wood splintered, hinges barely clinging to the frame.

Inside, a single broken bulb dangled from the ceiling. The walls were stripped bare, the floor layered with old newspapers and broken glass. In the middle of the room, sprawled atop a tattered carpet, was the body.

A man, mid-thirties. Dark hair, lean build. Dressed in jeans and a worn-out leather jacket. He lay on his back, one arm outstretched, fingers curled slightly as if reaching for something. His eyes were open, glazed over, staring at the ceiling.

Blood had pooled beneath his head, soaking into the faded floral pattern of the carpet, leaving only a faint trickle escaping onto the wooden floor beneath.

I crouched down. The wound was clean—a single puncture in the forehead, dead center. The kind of shot that drops a man instantly.

“Gunshot?” I asked, glancing over at the other officer.

“That's the current theory,” he replied. “No exit wound though. No shell casings either.”

No exit wound? That set off a quiet alarm in my head. A shot like this, straight to the skull, should’ve punched through the back of his head, splattering his brain all over the floor. But there was nothing—no splatter. Just the hole, round and neat, like someone had drilled into his skull.

I looked around. No signs of a struggle. No overturned furniture, no scuff marks on the floor, no smeared blood.

“This happened here?” I asked.

“Yeah,” Buzz Cut said. “‘Least, that’s what it looks like.”

I frowned. “Who found him?”

“Couple of squatters. said they came up looking for a place to crash and found him like this. No one heard a gunshot, though. Not that anyone around here would call it in if they did.”

I straightened up, letting my gaze sweep the room again. Something wasn’t right.

“Looks clean,” I murmured.

Buzz Cut Scoffed. “Yeah, tied up nice and neat—no witnesses, no noise, no trail. Just another dead asshole in a dump. Case closed.”

But that wasn't what I meant.

A hit like this—clean, precise, without witnesses—wasn’t gang work. Gangs were messy. They wanted people to see their kills, to send a message. When they shot someone, they left a signature.

Spray paint on the walls, mutilation, casings scattered like breadcrumbs. But this?

This wasn’t a statement.

This was surgical.

And that made me uneasy.

I glanced down at the man's hands. Clean. no bruised knuckles, no defensive wounds. He hadn't fought back.

I chewed on the inside of my cheek. If this was a gang hit, where was the message? The body was dumped in a place where people were supposed to find it, but it didn't scream intimidation. There was no spectacle here. Just a dead man in an empty room.

Something gnawed at my gut. “This guy doesn't look like a gangbanger,” I muttered.

Buzz cut scoffed. “You can’t always tell. Could’ve been mixed up in something. maybe he owed someone.”

Maybe. But my instincts were telling me otherwise.

I looked at the hole in the man's forehead again. Too precise, too methodical.

And why the hell wasn’t an exit wound?

I took a deep breath. Something about this didn’t add up, and I wasn’t letting it go.



The morgue was always too cold. A necessary evil to keep the bodies from rotting too fast, but still, it felt like stepping into a tomb. The air was thick with antiseptic, and the fluorescent lights cast a sickly glow over the room.

Dr. Harris barely looked up as I entered. He was in his sixties, thick glasses perched on the bridge of his nose, and his hair—what little was left of it— was slicked back with something that smelled like old grease. He was a man who’d seen much, and it had carved permanent lines into his face.

“Detective,” he grunted, not bothering to hide his annoyance. “I already filed the damn report.”

“I read it,” I said. “I just need to clarify something.”

Harris sighed and set down his clipboard. “Fine. Which part?”

“The wound...” That got his attention. He adjusted his glasses and walked over to a metal slab covered by a white sheet.

With a practiced motion, he pulled it back, revealing the body of our John Doe. The skin had taken on a waxy, pale look, and a Y-incision on his chest had been stapled shut.

Harris tapped a gloved finger against the man’s forehead.

“We thought it was a bullet wound at first,” he said. “perfectly round, right? but when I went to extract the slug, there wasn’t one. instead, the bone was cleanly pierce, straight through.”

“Pierced?” I frowned. “By what? An ice pick?

Harris shook his head. “An ice pick would leave an irregular wound, some chipping around the edges. This was smooth—cylindrical, about the thickness of a pencil.”

I felt my stomach tighten. “That’s… not exactly a standard gang execution.”

“Obviously,” Harris added dryly. “And that’s not the weirdest part.”

Harris paused. Looking nervously around the room as if checking for unwanted listeners.

“The liver…” he said, tapping the clipboard. “Well… it’s shrunken. Withered, almost. Like something had drained it.”

“Like something did what?” I blurted, blinking.

“Yeah... It was severely damaged, but not in a way that makes sense. No signs of cirrhosis, or disease, or drugs in his system, this guy should’ve been healthy. But whatever happened to his liver—it sure wasn’t natural. And sure as hell it didn’t happen before he died. No way he was walking around with that liver.”

Something cold slithered down my spine. “What could cause that?” I asked in a hushed murmur.

Harris exhaled through his nose. “You tell me...”

I looked down at the body again, at the wound in the forehead, at the vacant, open eyes. This wasn't some random drug deal gone bad. Something was off—way off.



The captain barely glanced up from his paperwork as I dropped the coroner’s report onto his desk. “Another conspiracy?” he muttered, flipping through the pages without any real interest.

“It wasn’t a gunshot. The coroner says something sharp and cylindrical punctured his skull. And the liver—”

“The liver was damaged,” he interrupted. “Because he was a drunkard.”

“No,” I said firmly. “There were no signs of alcohol or drugs in his system. Harris says there’s nothing that would do that to a liver post-mortem. This isn’t gang-related. Nor is it a junkie getting caught in the wrong place.”

“The Captain sighed, leaning back, rubbing his temples.

“Look,” he said, his voice slower, “even if this isn’t gang related, it could’ve been a hit done with some new weapon, or some sick bastard with a twisted M.O. But it doesn’t change the fact that it happened to someone we don’t have time to babysit.”

“So we just let it go?” I asked, my jaw clicking and I clenched it tighter, trying to contain indignation simmering in my gut.

“We have real crimes to solve, Detective.” The captain gestured vaguely towards his stack of paperwork. “Crimes that matter to people who actually pay their taxes. people that don’t get themselves killed in some condemned hellhole. I’m not wasting resources on a case that’s already dead in the water.”

The click in my jaw sharpened, a dull ache spreading as I forced the words out. “And what if this happens again? What if it happened before?”

He finally looked up at me, his expression tired. “ You’re chasing ghosts,” he said, waving me off. ”Let it go…”

I stepped out of his office, the weight of his words pressing hard on me. Maybe he was right. Maybe I should've let go. The department was drowning in cases and that part of town was black hole of trouble. But the thought of walking away sat like a stone in my gut.

The victim might not have been a “real citizen” in the captain's eyes. But they were someone, and if we didn’t care, who would?

To protect and Serve was etched into my badge. Not To protect and serve Some. Justice wasn’t supposed to come with an asterisk.

I would not let it go, and instead follow my gut. That was what had made a good detective—and that’s what, in the end, bit me in the ass.

The precinct’s archives were a mess—dusty shelves sagging under the weight of forgotten cases, filing cabinets that groaned when opened, microfiche readers that flickered like dying stars. Nobody bothered with this stuff. Once a case went cold, it stayed that way.

Which made it the perfect place to hide something.

I started small—just local cases, ones that matched the crime scene: a single puncture wound, no exit, no signs of a struggle. But the deeper I went, the stranger it got.

A John Doe from five years ago, found in an alley behind a liquor store. Same wound to the skull, same conclusion—gang-related. A decade back, another body with no name. The coroner’s report noted a peculiar liver shrinkage, inconsistent with disease, but nobody had looked twice.

But it wasn’t just here.

The pattern stretched beyond the city, bleeding into neighboring states, tucked away in reports no one had paid attention to. The killings were spread out—months, sometimes years apart—just enough to keep anyone from connecting the dots.

A man found dead in an abandoned warehouse in Detroit. A woman in a cheap hotel outside Chicago.

A drifter in New Orleans, left to rot in an alley. Different places, different victims, but the details were always the same.

A body, dumped somewhere no one would ask too many questions, with a single, precise wound, and a liver that looked like it had been eaten away from the inside.

The deeper I dug, the more cases I uncovered. and the more I realized—

This wasn’t a coincidence and for sure it wasn’t some freak one-off murder, and more horrifying still, this had been happening for decades.

I sat back, heart pounding, flipping through pages that told the same story.

How many times has this guy killed? How many times had he walked away, unnoticed, while cops shrugged and chalked it up to drugs or gang violence?

I stared at the scattered files on my desk. If I wanted to find answers, I'd have to find them myself.

I kept at it, the pattern becoming clearer. The victims weren’t gang members, dealers, or junkies. They weren’t even local. They were drifters—seasonal workers, backpackers, van lifers chasing the next sunrise, missionaries looking to save souls in places that had none. The kind of people who didn’t belong anywhere and wouldn’t be missed right away.

But there was something else—something that shattered the idea of them being casualties of the drug war. Their toxicology reports were clean. No heroin, no coke, not even a nicotine.  You don’t end up dead in a burned-out tenement or back-alley shooting gallery unless you’re on something. But these people weren’t addicts. They were healthy. Strong.

And yet they end up in that god forsaken place, killed in the same way—a single puncture wound to the skull, and with a liver that looked like it had rotted inside them.

This wasn’t random. This wasn't by chance. Someone was hunting them. And whoever it was—it was smart. Very smart.

And that was the problem. The murders were clean, methodical. The bodies turned up in places where people kept their heads down, where gunshots weren’t worth calling in, where life was cheap and silence was safer. Even the victims had lived on the fringes, moving through the world without a trail to follow. 

But as I sifted through the old case files, something started to stand out.

A woman. Always a woman.

People didn’t remember much about the victims, but they remembered her. She didn’t belong in those places. She stood out— too well-dressed, too elegant, too beautiful to be wandering around in rundown bars or crumbling alleyways.

She had been seen near these murders. Again and again.

One report from ten years ago described her slipping into a bar with a victim before its body turned up in an alley. A vagrant from twenty years back swore he saw her watching from a street corner the night before another body was found. But what really made my blood run cold was that some of these reports dated back fifty years. Different cities. Different decades. but the description never changed. Which was impossible

Soon another pattern emerged—one that could finally lead me somewhere. The victims were drifters, but they all had one last stop before they died—A bar

It wasn’t in every report, but in the few where someone had bothered to ask, the answer had always been the same—last seen drinking at some dive nearby, usually alone.

By morning they were dead.

The connection was subtle, buried in scattered reports from different places and years apart, but it was there. So that’s where I started looking.

I printed out the most recent victim’s picture and hit the bars near where his body had turned up. At first, it was a bust. Most bartenders didn’t give a damn, and the few who did had nothing useful to say. Just another drifter, another dead nobody. But after a couple of hours, I got a bite.

The old man behind the counter squinted at the photo, then nodded. “Yeah, I remember him. came in a couple nights ago. Quiet type. Had a beer, sat at the end of the bar.”

“Was he with anyone?” I asked.

The bartender frowned, thinking it over. Then something shifted in his expression. “Yeah. Actually… not at first, but then I saw him with some woman.”

My stomach tightened. “Describe her.”

“Fancy type. Way too put together for a place like this. Black coat think. Real looker.” he shook his head. “Didn't see them leave, but they talked for a while. Thought it was weird—someone like her, interested in a guy like him.”

A prickle ran down my spine—she was real.

All that was left to do was to find her—before another body showed up.

That night, I parked across the street from the bar and waited for a few moments, observing the city.

It had its own rhythm at this hour. The distant wail of sirens, the occasion roar of a passing motorcycle, the hum of neon buzzing against the damp air. This neighborhood never really slept, only  simmered—low conversations bleeding into laughter, the occasional outburst of a drunken argument quickly swallowed by the night—a place easy to disappear into.

Inside the bar, life went on like it always did. People drifted in and out, some alone, some clinging to each other like they’d fall apart if they let go. A couple fought near the entrance, their slurred words lost to the music. At the far end, a man nursed a drink, eyes hollow, staring into something that wasn’t there.

I sat at the counter, ordered a drink and watched the door—waiting. It didn’t last long until she walked in.

I didn't need to see her face to know it was her, I could tell by the way she moved—smooth, deliberate, every step precise. She wasn’t part of the scene, wasn’t drunk or desperate or lonely.

She was hunting.

She wore a long dark swing coat—the kind that flared when she moved, swallowing her frame in shifting shadows. Her gaze swept the room, sharp and assessing, lingering on each patron just long enough to size them up.

I sank deeper into my seat, keeping my head down, but my eyes up.

She moved to the bar, ordered something, then drifted toward a booth in the back. Settling into the shadows, her untouched glass glinting under the dim lights. Watching.

I waited.

Minutes stretched. She didn’t move, didn’t speak to anyone. Just sat there—patient. Calculating.

Then a voice cut through my focus.

“Buy me a drink?” I turned. A woman had slid into the seat next to me. Stunning, in a way that made it hard to look directly at her. Her smile was lazy, confident, her finger tracing idle patterns on the table.

“sorry, I’m—” I started, but she leaned in.

“Just one,” she murmured, her voice smooth, almost hypnotic. “You look like you could use one too.”

I flicked my eyes toward the booth. The woman in the swing coat was looking directly at us— at me. Then she stood abruptly, coat sweeping around her legs as she moved for the door.

“Listen, I really—” I started pushing back from the counter, but the other woman grabbed my wrist.

“Don’t go yet.” There was something off in her grip—too tight, like she wasn’t just holding me but restraining me.

“Let go.” I said, but she didn’t listen. Instead her grip tightened, nails pressing into my skin, her gaze locking into mine. For a split second, something flickered beneath the surface of those brown, almost reddish eyes. Something that made my skin crawl.

“Fine,” she said, a broad smile splitting her face, “your loss, my gain.”

I turned toward the door, but by that time the woman in the swing coat was already gone.

I bolted after her.

The night air hit me like a slap, cold and thick with the scent of rain on the pavement. I scanned the street, looking for movement. And I saw a shadow slipping around the corner. I took no time to think it over, I just darted after her.

She was fast—too fast. Her coat flared behind her as she moved, her steps impossibly light, barely making a sound against the cracked pavement.

I pushed harder, lungs burning, weaving through side streets, past shuttered storefronts, deeper into the city’s decayed underbelly.

I ran down an alley, over a rusted chain-link fence. Across an empty lot littered with broken glass.

My legs screamed, my lung raw, but I couldn’t stop—

Then—nothing.

I stood there, my pulse hammering against my ribs, my breath fogging in the cold night air. The alley stretched ahead, empty.

She was gone.

I turned in a slow circle, trying to get my bearings. The building around me loomed taller than I remembered, their windows gaping black. The streetlights were unreliable—half of them flickered, the other half were dead, leaving jagged shadows spilling across the pavement.

I need to get out of here.

Forcing my feet to move, I backed toward the nearest pool of light. It buzzed overhead, casting a sickly yellow glow onto the cracked asphalt beneath me. The warmth of it—however artificial—offered some small relief against the weight of the darkness pressing in from all sides.

Something about this didn’t sit right. I had chased people before. I knew the rhythm of a pursuit, the way panic played out in footfalls and sharp turns. This wasn’t that.

She had lead me here, and now the hunt would begin.

A rustle in the darkness.

I stiffened.

Footsteps, slow and deliberate, echoing from the alley behind me.

I turned sharply, my hand hovering over my holster.

The woman from the bar—the one who had tried to keep me inside—stepped into the dim light. But she wasn’t smiling now, not in the way people smile.

Her lips curled in a way that was too wide, stretching over teeth that looked just a little too sharp. Her eyes gleamed, something unnatural flickering beneath the surface.

She took another step forward.

“It's been a while since I had to chase my meal,” she murmured.

My fingers tensed around the grip of my gun.

She moved slowly, like she was savoring the moment, with a grace to her movements of something predatory.

“Your kind is always so quick to follow me,” she continued, tilting her head. “So gullible.”

My tongue turned to ash and instinctively I took a step backward.

She took one step forward, her smile turning into a delighted grin.

“It felt good,” she said, almost to herself, rolling a shoulder like a cat stretching after a nap. ”I should do it more often.”

My gut twisted as I realized what she was doing—playing with me.

I swallowed, steadying myself. “Stay where you are!” I shouted, unable to keep my voice level.

She didn’t. My hand closed around the gun, and I drew it, pointing it at her. “I said stay back!”

Her grin grew even wider, and she took another step.

The gunshot split the silence, echoing through the alleyway. The bullet buried itself in the brick wall above her head, sending a spray of dust and mortar into the air.

She however, didn’t even flinch, didn't even blinked. Just kept walking, creeping in close to me as if I hadn't fired at all.

The shadows rippled around her, the flickering streetlight making her eyes gleam in a ravenous crimson.

A bead of sweat rolled down my temple. This wasn't right. My instincts—years of training, years of surviving in a city that ate people alive— screamed at me to run. But my feet refused to listen.

“Last warning,” I said, forcing the words out. My hand shaking, making the barrel dance in front of me. “I will shoot you.”

She cocked her head, amused. “go ahead.”

The chilling cold in her words froze my blood. I swallowed again and then—I squeezed the trigger.

The shot rang out, the flash briefly illuminating the alley in stark, blinding light.

The bullet hit her dead center. But she didn't go down. In fact the impact barely rocked her. not even a stager—just a slow, deliberate glance down at the growing blotch in her coat.

The woman’s lips pursed, and her expression shifted—disappointment creeping into her eyes. “I think you can do better than that,” she murmured, her voice carrying an almost mocking lilt.

Something about the way she said it—so casual, so unbothered—made my stomach drop. There wasn't any shock in her voice, any pain. Just amusement as if this was all game to her.

My mind went on a spiral, trying to make sense of what was happening, but nothing added up. I had shot her point-blank in the chest, and all she did was mock me.

The gun began feeling heavy, too heavy in my hands, my finger trembling as I fought to keep it trained on her. I wanted to run, to turn and get the hell out of there, but my body was frozen, as if my limbs had turned to stone, my breath stuck somewhere in my throat.

She sighed, shaking her head as if I were a misbehaving child, and then took another step forward.

In that second my instincts kicked in. I shove the fear down, squared my stance, and pulled the trigger again. The gun roared, but she was already gone, turned into a dark blur shifting sideways with inhuman speed. I fired again, and again—each bullet swelled by the empty night. My pulse pounded in my ears, the dull ache of adrenaline thrumming through my chest. I tried to track her movements, but she was too fast, her figure flickering in and out of sight like a trick of the light.

She moved again, her form turning into a vanishing blur. This time not to dodge my feeble efforts against—to close the distance.

I barely had time to register the motion before she was on me, and then I saw it—something glinting above her head, reflecting the dim light. At first I thought it was a blade she had drawn mid charge, but no—this thing was attached to her. A long bony spike sharp as a needle. Arching from behind her like the tail of some nightmare creature. And it was aimed right at my skull.

I threw myself backward, barely escaping as the spike slammed into the pavement beside me with a sharp, wet crack. My back hit the ground hard, pain jolting up my spine, the impact knocking the gun from my grip, the weapon skidded across the asphalt, useless now, leaving me with nothing but my bare hands and the cold certainty of death looming over me.

She stood above me, her grin widening, eyes gleaming with something dark and hungry.

“I’ve forgotten how good it feels when you fight back,” she murmured, and took another, slow, deliberate step forward. The bony tail curled above her, its wicked spike glistening in the dim light like a threat. Her lips parted in a hungry grin. “I can’t wait to taste you.”

My breath hitched. My muscles coiled, but I didn’t move. There was nowhere to go. My back was against the ground, my gun lay feet away—out of reach—and she was right there, looming, poised to strike.

I clenched my fists, bracing for the inevitable, the spike twitched above her, ready to drop.

I closed my eyes and waited.

A gunshot shattered the night.

A single crack, sharp and violent, punched through the air like a thunderclap. My skull rattled with the force of it, my ears rang, drowning everything else.

My breath caught in my throat. Every muscle in my body locked up, still expecting the fatal blow that never came. Heart hammering in my chest, I forced my eyes open.

She was still there, standing over me, but something had changed.

Her body had gone rigid. Lips parted slightly as if she couldn’t quite believe what had just happened. She looked down. A dark stain was spreading across her chest, thick and inky, soaking into the fabric.

Not red. Black.

Her fingers hovered near the wound, trembling, hesitant, as if she couldn’t quite believe what she was seeing. Then, her head snapped up, eyes wide, frantic as they searched the shadows behind me.

“What are you doing here?!” She rasped.

Not to me, but to someone else.

I twisted my head toward the shadows just as a figure stepped into the pale glow of the streetlamp. A woman, wrapped in a dark swing coat, her expression cold, unreadable. She moved with purpose, each step controlled, the black-muzzle of a handgun in her grip still raised.

She didn’t speak.

The gun cracked again.

Once.

Twice.

Three times, each shot blending into the next with unnatural speed.

The monster blurred, twisting to avoid them, but this time, she wasn’t fast enough. The bullets struck true. A ragged, snarling hiss ripped from its throat as she stumbled backward, clutching her side, dark fluid seeping between its fingers.

And I saw something flicker in the creature's eyes.

Not amusement.

Not hunger.

Not even anger.

Fear.

“You better leave now,” the woman in the swing coat said to me, her voice like ice.

I barely had time to react before something ran past me—a flash of red and white, low to the ground, fast as a streak of lightning.

A fox. It lunged, fangs bared, eyes burning with something unnatural.

Its fangs snapped toward the monster's face, claws digging deep into its cheek as it clambered up, tearing through flesh. A ragged snarl ripped from its throat, its composure shattering as it staggered backward, trying to shake the creature loose. Thick black ichor welled from the gashes, dripping onto the pavement in heavy splatters.

With a furious hiss, Its tail whipped around, the bony spike slamming into the fox’s side with enough force to send it flying. The small body crashed against the pavement, rolling limply before coming to a stop. Where it stayed, eerily still.

A deafening gunshot followed, splitting the air. The muzzle flash seared through the darkness, blinding me for a split second. When the spots cleared, I saw the woman in the swing coat, her gun still raised, smoke curling from the barrel. but the monster had moved and the bullet missed.

It was already turning to flee, but the woman in the swing coat took no time to react, and she was fast.

In a blink she closed the distance, one hand snapping forward, fingers clamping onto the monster’s forehead.

Bang!

She fired point black, but the creature jerked its head aside at the last second. The bullet grazed its temple, slicing through flesh, black ichor bubbled up instantly, oozing down its face in thick rivulets.

Before the woman could fire again, the tail lashed out, the spike punching through her shoulder with a sickening thunk.

Blood splattered across the pavement.

I stood there frozen, my mind reeling, my body refusing to move as the scene played out in front of me. The woman let out a sharp breath, shaking her head as if trying to clear it, then slowly released her grip on the gun. It hit the asphalt with a dull clatter.

A strange stillness followed. Then the woman in the swing coat roared.

It was a deep, guttural sound, raw and animalistic, something that shouldn’t have been possible for a human throat. Her body expanded, growing thicker, stronger, in a way that made my stomach churn. Her coat strained as if barely able to contain the sudden mass of muscle beneath it.

The monster’s expression collapsed into pure, undiluted terror. And it turned to run, but it was too late.

The woman pounced.

Her hand snatched the monster’s tail, yanking it back with brutal force. The momentum sent the creature stumbling, arms flailing, just as the woman drove a fist into the back of its skull.

Bone cracked.

The monster lurched forward, its balance breaking, its legs nearly giving out beneath it. A choked snarl tore from its throat, its right hand lashing out, claws raking across the woman’s face, releasing a spray of blood into the air, as she carved deep gouges into her cheek.

She let out a snarl of pain, her grip loosening just enough for the monster to twist free. Its tail snapped forward again, aiming for the woman’s ribs, but before it could strike, a blur of red and white shot between them.

The fox.

It lunged again, snapping at the monster’s leg, forcing it back

The woman took the opportunity. She charged, but this time the monster was ready.

The spike lashed out—a blur of motion—but the woman blocked it with her forearm, the force of the impact jarring her entire body. Before she could react, the creature’s foot swung up. A brutal kick slamming into her ribs.

The woman crashed to the ground.

The fox darted forward, but the monster swatted it aside, sending it skidding across the pavement. It didn’t rise this time.

She turned her attention back to the woman, still sprawled on the ground, breathing heavily, and loomed closer.

Its tail rose, The spike glistening, poised for the final strike. A slow, cruel smile spread across its bloodied lips.

I didn’t think.

I just moved.

My fingers closed around cold metal.

I raised the gun and fired.

The bullet grazed its face, splitting flesh open, carving a deep trench along its cheek. Black ichor poured from the wound.

Its head snapped toward me. And I saw its eyes. Burning with fury.

It lunged.

A surge of adrenaline tore through me. I barely managed to roll aside, just as the spike slammed into the ground where I had been standing.

I swung the gun up, ready to fire again—too slow.

The tail lashed out, swatting the weapon away before I could even aim. My heart pounded, my breath coming in ragged gasps as it closed the distance.

Its hand snapped forward, grabbing me by the collar, lifting me off my feet.

Then I felt it. A sharp, searing pain of the spike punching through my shoulder.

A ragged breath tore from my throat. Warmth flooded down my arm, soaking through my shirt, dripping onto the pavement below.

Then it bit down but what I felt wasn’t just teeth.

Something burrowed deeper, wriggling under my skin, something needle-like piercing into me. A sick, sucking sensation spread through my veins, followed by a deep pulling in my gut. My stomach churned, my vision blurring at the edges.

I was going to die.

No, no! I still had the gun.

My fingers were weak, but I still had the damn gun.

I pressed it between us and pulled the trigger.

The gunshot ripped through its chest.

It staggered, the force sending it reeling backward, black ichor pouring from the gaping wound.

It let out a strangled wet snarl, her breath hitching in shock.

I hit the ground, my body numb, my vision swimming.

Somewhere nearby, the woman in the swing coat was already rising to her feet.

Her face bore a wicked snarl that said only one thing—she was done playing—the hunt was over.

The monster staggered, clutching its ruined chest, black ichor spilling in thick, sluggish streams. Its breath came in ragged, wet gasps, her body trembling from the shock.

The woman in the swing coat didn’t hesitate. She lunged forward, closing the gap before the monster could react. One hand snapped up, fingers locking around its chin, the other clamping onto its shoulder.

The monster snarled, trashing, its tail whipping up in a desperate counterattack. But the woman had anticipated it. She twisted her body, shifting her weight, and yanked the creature's head back.

Muscles flexed. Veins bulged.

A deep, guttural grunt ripped from her throat as she pulled.

Then came the sound.

A nauseating, wet rip. Flesh tearing. Tendons snapping. Bone grinding against bone.

The monster let out a strangled gurgle, its body convulsing, limb flailing wildly. Its claws scraped against the woman's arms, tearing through her coat, leaving deep, bleeding gouges—but she didn't stop.

With a final, sickening sound, the skin split apart, the sinew snapping like old rope, as the entire head came free.

I watched in horrified disbelief as black gore poured from the ragged stump of its neck.

Its body gave a last weak shudder before slumping to the ground, lifeless.

The woman stood there for a moment, holding the severed head by the chin, dark ichor dripping between her fingers. Then, with an unceremonious thud, she dropped it onto the pavement.

It rolled once, eyes still open, frozen in an expression of pure terror.

My legs buckled. My vision swam, my world tilting violently. My chest felt tight, my limbs numb, the warmth spilling from my shoulder draining the last of my strength.

The woman turned to me, and rushed forward, her coat billowing behind her, but I barely registered it. The edges of my vision darkened, my body fading out of consciousness.

Then—blackness.

I woke up to the feeling of soft fabric beneath me. The scent of antiseptic hung thick in the air, mingling with the faint traces of old paper and dust.

My body felt heavy. My neck throbbed, wrapped in tight bandages, and for a moment, I just lay there, my mind sluggish, struggling to piece together what the hell had happened.

Then the door creaked open.

A woman stepped in, young, with dark hair pulled into a loose braid.

She wore a reddish tunic, the color warm and rich, almost like autumn leaves.

She stopped mid-step, eyes lighting up when she saw me.

“Oh! you’re awake—good, good.” she moved closer, placing a cold hand against my forehead. “I thought we lost for a moment there.”

I blinked at her, still too disoriented to respond.

She didn't seem to mind. “Your name is Robert, right?”

“How do you—?” My voice came out hoarse.

She gave me a quick, almost sheepish smile.

“We checked your wallet,” she said, as if that explained everything. Then, straightening, she folded her hand behind her back and grinned.

“I’m Excelsa. And—” she gestured to the space around us, “welcome to the Association.

I stared at her.

The what? Association. The word sat heavy in my skull. something about it felt wrong—dangerous.

I opened my mouth to demand an answer, but before I could say a word, the door slammed open.

A man stormed in, tall with a sharp, angular face and eyes that cut through me like a blade. He didn’t waste time with pleasantries.

“Detective Robert—” He glanced at the file in his hand.

The way he said it made my stomach twist.

“Let's not waste time.” He stepped closer, gaze cold and calculating. “You've seen too much.”

Excelsa shifted uncomfortably beside me but didn’t say a word.

“You have two choices.” He tossed the file onto the table, the papers inside sliding loose. I caught glimpses—reports, pictures. My cases. My notes—My life.

“One: you become a Cleaner.” his tone was flat. “You work for us, take orders and help keep things in line.

“And if I say no?” I asked.

His expression shifted. Not with anger, not even frustration. Just cold certainty. “You won’t.”

I glanced at the papers again—the crime scenes, the bodies. What I’d seen and could never fully explain. I knew there was no going back. Not to my old life. Not to normal.

I took a slow breath, and nodded.

The man studied me for a moment longer, then, satisfied, he turned away.

“Good choice.” He walked to the door, pausing as he reached the threshold.

“Welcome to the real world, Cleaner.” The door clicked shut behind him. And just like that—my life changed. Forever.
