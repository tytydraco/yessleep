Only 15 people survived and they were taken for questioning by the police and later  the CIA.

Leefson - what do you remember happening in the massacre?  
  
Jack - please , it wasn’t a massacre , it was fathers return, his return to punish all who have turn away from him.(Jack was a devout  christian , he never committed -by bible standards- a sin).  
  
Leefson - what do you mean  Jack? Are you talking about god?  
  
Jack - why yes the creator , light of god came and all sinners revealed themselves.  
  
Leefson - so, you're saying that god made sinners reveal themselves, right?  
  
Jack - yes , you heard right ,policeman , now may I go, please?
