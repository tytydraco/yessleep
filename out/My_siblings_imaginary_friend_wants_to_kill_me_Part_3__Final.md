“Please. You have to remove Jumpy from the end of the episode.”

My animation supervisor looked at me with furrowed brows. “ We can't. We've already passed that sequence over.”

“Well then un-pass it. Just tell the client there was a technical error or something. We need to remove Jumpy from the background.”

He frowned at me and drank his coffee. A few people peered into the window of the meeting room, wondering why I was having another one-on-one with my boss.

“Elizabeth, it was *you* who wanted to add Jumpy in the first—”

“—I know! It was a terrible mistake. We should have never added him in. Please.”

He massaged his temple. “Why does it matter exactly? It's just a webcomic right?”

My hands were fidgeting, wringing each other constantly. I tried to keep my voice level.

“... If we don't remove Jumpy, we are risking the well-being of countless generations of kids who watch this TV show. Lives are at stake.”

He put down the coffee cup and looked me in the eye. “Elizabeth, I know you had that elevator accident. And if you’re feeling … untethered … that’s okay.”

“I'm feeling totally fine. This has nothing to do with the elevator. Please just believe me when I say we need to remove that cartoon frog.”

He took a deep inhale and shook his head. “My hands are tied here Elizabeth. But if you want to talk to production, see if they are willing to communicate with the client for us to resubmit the animation sequence. Go right ahead.”

\*\*\*

I spoke with production. I spoke with the head producer at our studio and explained how important it was to remove the frog from the background of episode six.

Everyone gave me strange looks and didn’t see the big deal, but I kept pushing.

Eventually, even the head producer said there was nothing that could be done.

The only person who had the power to make changes to episode six, was the client side boss. A wealthy studio exec who worked from home, some two hours away from my city.

His name was [Paul Winslow.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1cszldc/he_had_no_head_only_a_floating_set_of_eyes/)

I tried calling him, emailing him, messaging him via linkedin, slack and every other platform imaginable. But he was some big shot, and didn't have time to respond to anything.

I had given him three whole days. Three whole days where all I did was worry about my cousin’s nephews, and all the kids I could see going to the school across from my apartment.

This wasn't up to him anymore, It was up to me.

\*\*\*

HR said I was required to take a ‘ leave of absence’ for 2 weeks as they ‘ reassessed’ something. This was fine with me, because It gave me the time I needed to execute my plan.

On a dark, overcast night I drove all the way to Paul Winslow's house.

\*\*\*

It was late, but I could still make out the black, wrought iron gates at the entrance. The intercom box on the right.

I had waited too long, the episode was going to release imminently, so I didn't have time to bother with the intercom. Instead, I flashed my high beams and pointed at the gate.

In view of my headlights, the iron gate started to shake and bend.

The middle latch snapped off.

Within seconds, the gate had been peeled apart as if it were made of putty.

I drove through.

Along the path, two large dogs came barking at my car, they looked eager to leap at my throat.

But before they could reach my bumper, there came a large, earth-shaking stomp. The dogs froze. Noses sniffed the air.

Their tails curled between their legs as they ran away.

I pulled up to the enormous front doors made of some kind of red cedar. The handles looked like they were made of polished bronze, or maybe even gold.

The expensive handles crumpled. The doors were torn from their hinges.

I walked in holding a laminated copy of my Jumpy sketch. I spoke loudly and assertively.

“Mr. Winslow. We need to talk.”

From upstairs, I could hear a panicked voice: “Who are you!? Get out of my house! I have a gun!”

Wasting no time, I pointed at the stairs. The bannister bent and splintered.

I waited at the foot of the stairs until I heard a gunshot, followed by shrieks.

“What the hell? What is happening?!”

Some banging and screaming ensued. When it turned into crying, I walked up the stairs.

Mr. Winslow was lying in a bathrobe on his hallway floor. I could make out the wet indentation of a heavy footprint on his chest. He looked up at me with watery, frightened eyes.

“Paul, believe me when I say I’m sorry I had to do this. But I had no other choice.” I said.

He whimpered as he spoke. “Is it money you want? I have gold in the attic. take as much as you want.”

“Lives are at stake. I need you to remove this character from the kids show you're making.” I held up the Jumpy sketch to his face.

“ …What?”

“You have the ultimate sign off. I need you to prevent episode six from airing.”

“You’re talking about … that singalong show?”

“YES! You have to prevent this character from ever being seen by anyone!”

“But it's already … It's already been sent to the streamers.”

“What!? What do you mean it's already been sent?”

“They’ve already released it in … Asia and Europe.”

I dropped the picture, and lowered my face to his. ‘Are you serious? Kids have already seen it!?”

Mr. Winslow's face was beginning to turn blue. “Listen. Do you have any idea how tight the turnaround is on children’s programming? I don't make the rules.”

“No no no!” I pulled at my hair. *How could I be too late?*

I stared at the air above the studio exec and pointed wildly. “Jumpy, is that true? Is there something you're not telling me? Have some kids seen you?”

The air slowly rippled into green, white and orange patterns, until all the colors solidified into the shape of a massive tree frog.

I looked at one of the frog’s massive red eyes. “Do you have other believers? Can you sense them already?”

Jumpy frowned, holding one hand on its stomach. “Only thing that Jumpy can sense. Is how hungry belly is.”

The frog eyed Mr. Winslow.

“No Jumpy!” I shouted. “We agreed, only as an absolute necessity.”

“Holy fuck!” Mr Winslow tried his best to wriggle out of Jumpy’s foot. “What is this thing? Is this real!?”

Jumpy lifted its foot. The man rolled out and crawled away.

“Jumpy!” I waved my arms. “What are you doing?!”

Mr. Winslow ran for the pistol lying on the floor at the end of the hall. Just as his fingers leaned down, A massive tongue whipped out and grabbed him by the head.

There was a crack and a twist.

Mr. Winslow's body lay face down on the floor. His shocked face was turned upwards, staring wide-mouthed at the ceiling.

“Now can I eat him?” Jumpy asked.

\*\*\*

The following day I left town. Paul Winslow's sudden disappearance would eventually be traced back to me. Everyone at my work knew what I was after.

I had been obvious about it.

I had been stupid.

Terror prevented me from seeking Jumpy, but now survival has forced me to pair with the frog. It followed me wherever I drove.

Ironically, I was no longer afraid of the monster which used to keep me up at night, because I had turned into somewhat of a monster myself. A murderer on the run.

The silver lining was that when I finally got around to watching episode six of my company's kids show. You couldn't see Jumpy.

It was a sing-along show for young kids, and the baked-in lyrics on screen obscured the background characters for the whole sequence Jumpy was in. You couldn't even make out it was a frog.

And so here I am, driving from city to city. Never lingering too long.

I'm giving myself a few months to figure out what to do. I’ve mostly been staying in cheap hotels and hostels.

Every now and then I go swimming at the nearest public pool late at night. Jumpy always finds a way through the roof. We swim together.

Through Jumpy I’ve been learning more about my late twin sisters. They used the Jumpy a lot to get what they wanted.

But I don't need anything excessive. I don't want money, I don't want fame, I just want to live somewhere peacefully. Maybe teach synchronized swimming. If I can use Jumpy to arrange that—it's enough for me.

As much as I hate it, I feel like I deserve to be the sole believer. To have this invisible creature haunt me, and follow me wherever I go.

I was a Whitaker sister after all.
