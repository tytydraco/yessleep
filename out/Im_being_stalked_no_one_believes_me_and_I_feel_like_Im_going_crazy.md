Hi everyone, I just stumbled upon this place, so I decided to share an experience I've been dealing with for a while now.  
  
So, everything started when I decided to go out one night to meet with a few friends and have some fun. We met in a nice place, hung out, had a few drinks, and spent a great time together in a great atmosphere.   
After some time passed, we decided it was time to part ways, we bid our goodbyes, and my buddies went home. Although it was a little late already, I wasn't feeling like going home yet, so I decided to wander solo around downtown a little bit more. I'm used to doing that, so I wasn't afraid to go home late, mainly because my neighborhood is usually safe to walk around, no matter when. (Or so I thought.)  
  
So after a while of just looking at the passersby and the nice nocturnal glow being cast at buildings and nature in general, I decided that it was time to go home, it was already eleven o'clock in the evening, and I was lucky enough to catch the last bus to my neighborhood.  
I arrived at the bus stop that was closest to my house. I still had to walk quite a bit to get there, so I started walking carefree and untroubled since I was familiar with everything around me. All was ok until a fidgety man riding a motorbike approached me from out of the most ominous spot ever. He asked me if I had seen a hobo walking around wearing a red hoodie, carrying a half-empty trash bag. I was puzzled by the question but, at the same time, unfazed. (It could have been the alcohol inhibiting my adrenaline or the sleepiness, I'm not sure which of the two is more plausible.)   
So I replied that I had seen nothing of the sort or anything suspicious, chiefly due to my having recently arrived. This man then proceeded to explain to me that he and a gang were looking to find this hobo who went hiding because he killed a lady by knife-stabbing on a square close to where we were, this situation seemed very, very suspicious, but I managed to maintain my posture and told the man that if I ever saw a person like that, I'd try my best to steer away and that If I ever got the opportunity, I'd contact the cops right away, and that being so I went along the path that I was headed to, home.  
  
As I resumed my destiny, I felt uneasy and in danger, so I decided to quicken my pace. It is not long until I get home, but just to be sure that I'm not being followed, I take a glance at my back, and there he is, red hoodie, half-empty trash bag being carried in the left hand, right-hand, a rusty small pocket blade, not to mention a horrible yellow smile, and extreme jittery eyes. A sight that is still haunting me.  
As one would expect, I ran as fast as I could. Of course, I tried to mislead him by running around a few streets, hiding behind a few other houses and trees, and hiding in a small forestry area that is located at the end of a group of dead-end streets, my home, of course, is located in one of them dead-end streets, so I couldn't just walk straight ahead to my street address because I didn't want him to follow me, and figure out where I live, so I spent quite some time trying to spot him anywhere before going home.   
The craziest thing was I started to notice that when I could no longer see this specific hobo on my trail, I could always spot a different hobo with the same kind of evil look, looking at me and walking in my direction but trying to appear not as obvious.   
I feel like I spent a few hours trying to clear my path so I could lie on my bed and forget that this day existed. After being sure I wasn't being followed, I went home, slept like a rock, and tried to forget this day.   
  
After two peaceful weeks, the same hobo appeared in front of my door, ringing my doorbell, begging for food or money to buy food.   
I showed him my discontentment and told him to leave, which he would, but he'd keep coming back on the subsequent days, and after a while, he'd send his buddies to beg for food or money as well. I would always reject them, but then on the subsequent days, more and more people would come by my door impersonating workers, sellers, and workers from delivery services claiming that they had packages for my neighbors which they couldn't contact so they would always ask if I could receive those packages, which I never did.  
It's been three months now, and the situation escalated a bit.   
One day I woke up at 2 A.M. to screams in front of my house, and there were at least 20 people out, and they were banging at my gate, screaming for me to get out of my house, cursing at me, calling me names, I, of course, called the police, watched as they ran away before the cops could even catch them, and the cops didn't give many fucks about the situation.   
  
Now every time I see strange people walking around the neighborhood, people that don't live here, there's always one or two cars or motorbikes or bicycles parked in front of my house, or a couple houses down, they're always observing, always looking inside my house, when I show that I noticed their presence they steer away.   
The thing is, at times they stay in front of my house, for hours straight observing, and waiting for someone to come outside, sometimes I hear motorbike sounds in front of my house, the whole night. I've been living in fear when I go out I always feel like they're following me, waiting until I get to a place where I'm vulnerable. I noticed that when I go to restaurants, there are people who come in together with me, they ask for their food, but as soon as I leave the place, they leave as well, without even touching their food. If I turn a corner or another and another, it doesn't matter I will always see the same person, and it IS more than one person, perhaps it's the gang, perhaps the gang was wanting to hurt someone, for fun, perhaps I'm their next victim. I live with my parents, and they don't believe me, my mother is concerned and she wants to take me to a doctor, and I feel like my mental health, truly is going down, I don't know what to do anymore.

Any advice is welcome, sorry for the long text and the bad grammar.
