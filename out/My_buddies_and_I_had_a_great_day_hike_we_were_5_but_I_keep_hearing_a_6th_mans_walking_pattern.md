Hi guys!

This my might be my first and only submission ( pls be kind to me, I'm just a baby )

This happened a few years ago back when we were still in highschool 

Idk if someone has experienced this before but given a choice between having a member of your hiking group missing or there's someone new that you couldn't account for, I'll always pick the missing guy scenario since there's somehow a logical explanation and if acted quickly the resolution would be a funny anecdote about some clutz lagging or way ahead and took a wrong turn. 

That wasn't what happened that day. 

For context, back in my highschool days our school had this great boy scout program that offers academic incentives for participation. As a teenager who couldn't care about Isaac Newton's three laws it sounded great, perfect even I get to barely pass while just planting some seedlings on areas that could use it. It was a win for us boys that couldn't bother to comprehend Shakespeare and for the local Environment too. 

After a few years on that program we found ourselves in leadership roles and is burdened with tasks of training our juniors, the occasional paperworks, and documentation for our projects. One of these project areas where we conducted tree planting before was in a mountainous areas that need at least a two hour hike to get through. It's not perilous where mud sinks through the soles of your shoes and the occasional slips happens. It was mostly gravel roads and neglected asphalt roads that was meant to bolster tourism in the area. 

Amongst the 5 senior scouts 2 were on camera duty to take pictures of the status of the seedlings, I was on supplies ( snacks, lunch, the mat where we would have lunch, a jug of water), the troop leader ( he brought the other jug of water and Bluetooth speaker), and Mr. Medic ( the guy who was most qualified to do first aid, in case something goes wrong). In hindsight, 5 teenagers in the mountains alone without an adult or teacher was just a lawsuit waiting to happen but we can't really have that since it was on a Sunday and the deadline for the documentation requested by the local Environment agency was drawing near. 

So the day had come, we all loaded up in one Troop Leader's dad's pickup truck as far as Troop Leader's dad can take us drop us off at the end of the more safer and steady parts of the gravel path. The day went and go, took some pictures of the fledgling trees, scavenged around the area to find suitable replacements for worn down tree guards, notes which ones failed based on the planned plots where they were located from years ago, had friendly banter about crushes and who went number on the school's toilet and also making fun of some of the school faculty exaggerating their quirks to what was a hilarious degree. We did finish the job at around 3 pm, a bit longer than expected mostly due to the long lunch break we gave ourselves. 

After tidying up the area, it was very prudent for us to go back down before things get dark. We had flashlights but nothing beats the big one on the sky in terms of providing a light source on the trail.

Halfway through the gravel trail something was off with the group. I noticed that the merry band of 5 was suddenly silent, it couldn't be helped since we had a long day of doing what is technically manual labor on the field so everyone was just saving up their energy specially since tomorrow would be a Monday too. But something was off with their silence. I couldn't pick it up why and before I had to ask " What happened guys? Why so quiet? " I picked up something off

I was told my whole life that I might be on the 'tism to put it kindly but if it gave me a quirk it would be that I can tell which objects are making sounds. I don't want to sound like I'm being unique but a few years on weekend trails gave me this quirk that I can count pairs of foot steps walking specially on loud surfaces like gravel. It was a handy quirk in making sure that my patrol is in line when I'm leading in the front for sure. 

But something was off that moment, if Mr. Troop Leader's Bluetooth speaker hadn't run out of juice I couldn't have picked up on our cadence, the rhythm we subconsciously made while marching downhill. Out of habit, I counted

1,2,3,4,5,6....  1,2,3,4,5,6.... 1,2,3,4,5,6.... 1,2,3,4,5,6.... 1,2,3,4,5,6.... 

At this point one of the camera guys should have pointed out that our cadence is sorta off too since he and I share that quirk and he's the more outspoken one between the two of us and yet he was quite, eyes downcast on the road as if he's looking out for trip hazards. In our line formation it went like this from front to rear

Camera guy 1 ( he who shared my quirk with me ) followed by troop leader and camera guy 2 walking side by side as an effect on the conversation they had earlier followed by me with Mr medic at the rear. 

At first I was annoyed that the cadence was off

 1,2,3,4,5,6... 

I wanted to say something but something in my gut tells me not to say something for now. I understand everyone just had a long day and so do I so I just let out a quite and deep sigh and carried on the trail. 

When we got to the asphalt road leading to town I noticed that the cadence has appears to be normal

1,2,3,4,5.... 

I for one was somehow relieved that was no longer slightly peeved by this and carried on till we could hitch a ride on a farmer's truck heading to town for some supplies too. 

It was mostly a quite ride until camera guy #2 commented something along the lines of " was it me or did the gravel smelled like a dead rat? ". Troop leader chimed in with something like " probably a dead dog somewhere in the shrubs " . Mr. Medic couldn't help but call out their BS since all he felt was just some strong chills from the wind. But there was hardly any wind in the trail. I called out everyone's BS and chimed with my eyes locked onto camera guy #2 ( who was horizontally blessed) effectively saying that he was " Marching for two ". Camera guy #1  who was no longer shaken backed me up saying essentially that we were basically 6 people on that trail. 

We then proceed to banter even involving our mothers at one point and yet the kind farmer who gave us a rider was just noticably chuckling along. He was then the one who suggested that maybe we were followed by a spirit of sorts. The truck was dead silent for a short while. I can tell that my eyes went wide as I proceed to look at the other guys' faces to validate the kind Farmer's hypothesis. 

In the back of my mind it made sense in a way like how we experienced different phenomena and there was hardly any other explaination aside from maybe the food had a little something that the cooks didn't bother to tell us. Eventually the kind Farmer dropped us off to the town center before proceeding to go a hardware store for his supplies and we got into our own homes and just chucked it off as a quirky story we tell our other friends, parents, teachers,and juniors. I was adviced that it was just typical since we were baked by the sun for a few hours and maybe our brains just overheated that day. I really didn't mind about it, for me it was just a funny " supernatural story " I soon will tell to my kids or nieces and nephews. 

I write this now because I couldn't believe it took me so long to put the pieces together. This is how lately I've been losing sleep. 

A few years ago or to put it correctly a few years after that bizzare tale some construction guy who was doing some cleaning along the bushes on the gravel road to make way for a new asphalt road found human remains on what is speculated to be that of a child. 

Didn't think much about it when the news came out, it was viral in our town for a week and life went on. That was until a few months ago went forensic analysis confirmed that it belonged to a child missing for a long time and was assumed dead. He had been missing since around that time when we had that little Sunday Boyscout Documentation activity. 

It could have been him trying to find his way home back then. 

I'm so sorry buddy, we didn't know, we didn't know any better.
