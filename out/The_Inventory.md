The job posting said “Warehouse Manager - Night Shift” with no other details. I should have known better. But it paid well, and I needed the work.

The facility sat on the edge of town, unmarked except for a single number on the gate: 7. No company name. No logo. I showed up at 10 PM on a Monday with a signed contract that told me nothing and everything—I would manage inventory, maintain records, and follow all protocols without deviation. The pay was three times what anyone else was offering.

The man who hired me, Marcus, showed me around once. That was enough.

The warehouse was massive. Industrial lights cast everything in a kind of false noon that made my eyes hurt. Steel shelving stretched into darkness in every direction, arranged in neat rows that should have made sense but somehow didn’t. The aisles curved slightly, subtly, in ways that made me disoriented when I tried to count them.

“Every item is logged,” Marcus said, handing me a leather-bound ledger that felt too heavy. “You don’t log anything new. You only verify what’s already here. You count sections A through M every night. You cross-reference the inventory sheets. You make sure the numbers match.”

“What if they don’t?” I asked.

He didn’t answer that. He just left.

The first week was fine. Sections A and B were filled with standard items—boxes of unmarked files, sealed crates, filing cabinets. Nothing strange. I counted, I checked the ledger, I marked everything verified. The numbers always matched perfectly. Almost suspiciously perfectly.

By the second week, I started noticing things.

The boxes in section C were warm to the touch, even though the warehouse had no heat. The sealed crates in section E made a sound when I walked past them—not a rattle, more like a collective breath. The filing cabinets in section H had locks that looked new, even though the ledger said they’d been there for decades.

I didn’t write any of this down. I just counted, verified, and signed off.

In the third week, I noticed something in the ledger.

The handwriting changed every few months. Different people had managed this inventory before me. Some entries were meticulous. Others looked rushed, almost frantic. And the most recent entries before my start date—three months ago—were incomplete. Entire sections were marked “Verified” but the handwriting trailed off. The entry just… stopped.

I found the previous manager’s name in the ledger: David Chen. His entries were clear and careful until April 3rd. After that, nothing. Just a blank line where his signature should have been.

I told myself it didn’t matter. He’d quit or transferred. People do that.

But the next night, in section K, I found something.

It was wedged between two shelving units, small enough that I almost missed it. A piece of paper, folded dozens of times into a tiny square. I almost left it there. Every instinct told me to leave it.

I unfolded it.

“Don’t verify section N. Don’t ever verify section N. The numbers won’t match. They never match. Marcus knows. Don’t tell him you saw this. Don’t ask questions about section N. Don’t even count it. Just write that you verified it. He doesn’t check. He never checks section N.”

The handwriting was David Chen’s.

Section N didn’t exist on my route. My instructions were clear: A through M. Nothing beyond that. So I ignored the note. I burned it in the warehouse bathroom and forgot about it.

Except I didn’t forget.

I started thinking about what was in section N. Where it was, exactly. I began counting the aisles differently, trying to figure out the layout. A through M should have been twelve sections, but when I tried to count the warehouse’s actual sections, I got thirteen every time. The extra one was always obscured from view—behind the corner I turned, or past the row I’d already counted, or somewhere my eyes slid past without quite focusing on.

Around the fourth week, I made a mistake.

I miscounted section J. I’d gotten to twenty-three boxes but the ledger said twenty-two. So I counted again. Twenty-three. I counted a third time. Twenty-two. And then twenty-three. And then the numbers seemed to shift depending on how I counted, which boxes I started with, whether I counted left to right or right to left.

I panicked. I called Marcus.

“There’s a discrepancy in section J,” I said. “I’m getting different counts.”

Silence on the line. For a long time.

“What time is it?” he asked.

“11:47 PM.”

“Finish your route. Verify through M. Sign the ledger. Don’t open it again until tomorrow night. Don’t count section J again. Mark it verified.”

“But the numbers—”

“Mark it verified, or you’re finished. Understand?”

I understood.

I finished my route. I marked section J as verified. I signed the ledger with a hand that didn’t quite feel like mine. And I clocked out at 6 AM as I always did, just as the sun was starting to rise.

That day, I couldn’t sleep. I kept thinking about David Chen’s note. About section N. About what was in a section that technically shouldn’t exist according to my route, but that I was increasingly certain did.

That night, I made a decision.

I came in early. 9:30 PM instead of 10. Marcus wasn’t there—he never was. Just me and the warehouse and the humming of the lights.

I deviated from my route. I went past section M.

The air got colder. The light seemed dimmer, even though the fixtures were identical. And there, exactly where I knew it should be, was section N.

The shelving was different here. Older, maybe, or just arranged differently. The boxes were unmarked, but they were all facing the same direction—spines toward me, like books. And on each spine, in handwriting that looked intentional but completely illegible, was a series of marks.

I pulled out the ledger.

Section N wasn’t listed. Not anywhere. But when I flipped through the pages, I found entries written in the margins, in tiny letters, over and over again: “Section N = 1 box. Section N = 1 box. Section N = 1 box.” Different handwriting. Dozens of different people, all writing the same thing.

And then David Chen’s writing, frantic and dark: “It changes. Don’t count it. It’s not the same as it was yesterday. Don’t count it.”

I reached toward one of the boxes.

The lights flickered.

I pulled my hand back. My heart was doing things it shouldn’t do. I stood there in section N for maybe thirty seconds—it might have been hours—and then I backed out. I didn’t run. I walked carefully back through M and J and H and all the way to the front desk.

I signed the ledger. A through M, all verified. I didn’t mention section N.

That morning, I gave my two weeks’ notice via email. Marcus didn’t respond, but I got a direct deposit of two weeks’ severance that same day. More than I’d earned.

I’ve been unemployed for six weeks now. I’m not looking too hard for another job.

But last night, I got a call. Unknown number. When I answered, Marcus was on the line.

“We have an opening,” he said. “Night manager. Same pay, better hours. Warehouse 14.”

“I’m not interested.”

“You’ll want to hear the route,” he said. “Sections A through N.”

I hung up. I blocked the number.

This morning, I found a package on my doorstep. No return address, no postage. Inside was a leather-bound ledger, identical to the one I’d been using.

It’s open to a blank page.

Below it, a handwritten note in Marcus’s careful script:

“Your previous experience makes you valuable to our operation. We’d like you to consider the expanded role. The ledger is yours to keep. Think about what that means.”

I haven’t opened the ledger since I found it. It’s sitting on my kitchen table right now. I’m trying not to think about what I might find if I did.

But I keep coming back to something. Something that might be worse than anything inside that ledger.

When I was leaving warehouse 7 for the last time, I saw a bulletin board in the break room I’d never noticed before. It had photos of all the night managers, going back years. Dates and everything. David Chen was there, smiling at the camera. His end date was listed as “Resigned - April 4th.”

But there was a newer photo at the bottom. Someone I didn’t recognize, a woman with tired eyes and a name tag that said “Sarah K.”

Her end date was listed as today’s date.

I looked at the ledger Marcus just sent me again.

On the cover, embossed in gold, is a name.

It’s my name.

And there’s already something written on the first page, in handwriting I don’t recognize:

“Warehouse 14, Night Manager. Start date: \[TOMORROW\]. The inventory must be verified. Sections A through…”

The sentence just trails off.

But I can guess how it ends.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
