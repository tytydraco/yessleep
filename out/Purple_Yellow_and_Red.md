“I can’t believe that you’re making me do this,” I said to my brother as I caught my breath going up the stairs in my childhood building.

“Trust me. I’ve tried everything else. There’s no other way.”

I hadn’t been back here since our parents died last year in that freak accident — a gas leak from the stove, with all the windows closed. We had those old-school, double casement wooden windows. I knew my dad would always leave at least one open, no matter how cold it was, because he liked a little breeze. But that day, all the windows were shut, as if someone wanted them to die.

My brother swore it was the building itself. He said it had been cursed since we had that witch living on the second floor many years ago — a cousin of my dad’s, before the family knew of her ways and kicked her out, or in other stories, burned her alive to rid the world of her evil. Either way, everyone in our neighborhood swore she cursed the building. Everyone but our family, who denied she was even a witch and claimed their cousin simply lived in another country, but that the apartment was still hers.

Every time something freaky happened in our building that either made someone completely leave or get seriously hurt, my father would say it was just a freak accident, and that those happen all the time. Only people with a fluid imagination and lots of time on their hands would think it was something more. “People love myths and rumors,” he would always say.

We reached the second floor, just in front of the door of the infamous apartment. It was just after sunset, and it was starting to get dark. There was no electricity in the building since nobody lived there anymore, and it was becoming harder and harder to see.

My brother and I exchanged looks. We had always been terrified of that apartment and would always run past it when we were young. I hadn’t thought about it in years since I moved out. I knew the look in his eyes; he wanted us to run up and not spend more time in front of it. He didn’t need to say it.

“Come on, don’t be ridiculous. It’s just an empty apartment,” I said dismissively.

“Suit yourself,” he said.

I got closer and put my hand on the door. I didn’t know what I was expecting to happen — feel the wood burning, maybe? But there was nothing like that. All I felt was how dusty the door was. I put my head against the wood, just to see if I could hear anything — just an intrusive thought.

I heard nothing. It was hollow, just the sound of air.

But suddenly, I heard footsteps. Heavy. Not walking — running toward the door. I pulled my head away instantly and started running up, even though — realistically — I should have been running down and out.

Without asking, my brother followed me. We both ran until I stopped on the fourth floor, panting, my hands on my knees, dripping with sweat.

“WHAT THE FUCK HAPPENED?” my brother asked, also gasping.

“I heard someone running towards the door.”

“ARE YOU SURE? IT CAN’T BE. NOBODY LIVES THERE!”

“I KNOW WHAT I HEARD. I’M NOT CRAZY!” I exclaimed, starting to regret listening to him. “Dude, what are we doing here?”

“This is the only way. I told you, I spoke with this guy — Fathi — and he said I need to lift the curse before I can do anything with the building. Otherwise, people will keep leaving or worse, get hurt. You know Mom and Dad were the last two people adamant about not leaving, and we know what happened to them. Hate to say this, but now that they’re gone, I can finally do something with the building they left us. I’ll demolish the damn thing and build over it, but we gotta take care of this one thing first. Did you bring the roses like I asked you?”

“Yes, yes, I brought your stupid roses.”

“The right colors?”

“Yes, fucking purple, yellow and red. Why does it have to be these three colors?”

“I can’t remember exactly, but the guy said something about purple representing admitting wrongdoing, yellow representing asking for forgiveness, and red representing a sacrifice.”

“A SACRIFICE?”

“No, no, just a metaphor. We don’t actually have to sacrifice anything. At least that’s what he said.”

“I don’t know about that, man. Seems sketchy to me,” I said, frightened.

He grabbed me by both arms aggressively, eyes bulging, teeth clenched.

“Listen, bro. This is our last chance. This motherfucker cost me a lot of money to tell me what I needed to do. This building is also standing there bleeding money. I’m done with this fucki— I’m done with this witch. I want to get this over with. Let’s get this done and get out of here. It’s only a small window of time before it gets darker. Then we’d have to come back on a different day. We’re already on the fourth floor. Let’s get this done, ok?”

Me, not really sure if I was doing the right thing: “Ok.”

We started going up to the last floor, where we used to live. I was shivering. My emotions were all over the place. I was feeling kind of nostalgic for the place I spent most of my life, but it also felt cold, freezing, like it had been overtaken by something else, something darker — but maybe it was just my imagination.

We made it to the last floor. We heard a rhythmic creaking. I stopped in my place and looked at him. No matter how tough he wanted to look, he was my brother. I could read the terror in his eyes.

“It’s just the old baby swing. It’s kind of windy today. It’s winter after all,” he said.

I didn’t argue. The last floor entrance was kind of open anyway, no ceiling, so that could explain why it was moving.

But as soon as we stepped towards the door, the swing stopped — like dead stopped — not even slowing down.

“HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN THIS?” I exclaimed.

He didn’t answer me. I saw him audibly gulp, and then he started making his way toward the door. He walked sideways in front of the swing, as if trying not to touch whoever or whatever was on it, if so. It started swinging lightly when he came closer.

Squeak… squeak… squeak.

It went on swinging slowly. It frightened the both of us.

He turned around and started rummaging with the key in the keyhole. It took him a second to find the right one, also because he was shaking insanely. Finally, he found the right one. He put it in and I listened as the door unlocked. He opened it slowly. The creak itself, sounding like an old woman’s cackle, made me uncomfortable. I hadn’t felt like that since I was a little kid.

“Bring the damn rose,” he asked.

I came closer to him and looked inside my jacket. I took out the first one — the purple.

“So what do you need to do?” I asked.

“He said I need to leave it on the carpet, in the middle of the living room, then get out, close the door, and wait for a minute. If we open it again and it’s gone, then it was accepted.”

“And if it’s still there?”

“Then we need to get the hell out of here as fast as we can.”

I didn’t know which result I was more afraid of. Both were equally terrifying.

“Do you want to go first?” he asked.

“WHAT? WE DIDN’T EVEN TALK ABOUT ME DOING ANYTHING! I’M JUST HERE FOR SUPPORT!” I screamed at him.

“Alright. Alright. Fine… I’ll take the first one.”

He stepped in slowly. I peeked after him. It was pretty dark inside, and cold — extremely cold — with a draft of rotten air coming from inside. As if the bodies of my parents were still there. I wondered where that draft was coming from, as I was sure we closed all windows after we took them out of the apartment and buried them.

I watched him quietly walk into the middle of the living room, and there was silence. Not just the silence of an empty apartment, but even the world’s noise around us stopped when he stepped in.

In shaking steps, he placed the rose on the floor carefully, didn’t dare to look around, ran back quickly, and shut the door.

He was panting, shaking, sweating — even though it was freezing — eyes bulging.

“Nnnow what?” I asked.

“W…we wait for a minute.”

We stood in silence, looking at the watch and peeking our ears at the door, trying to hear anything. There was nothing. Just the loud noise of the moving watch hands.

Tick. Tock. Tick. Tock. Tick. Tock.

“Ok. It’s a minute. Let’s open up,” I said.

He turned the knob slowly and peeked from behind the door.

“OH MY GOD. OH MY GOD!” he exclaimed.

“WHAT IS IT?” I asked nervously.

“IT’S GONE. THE ROSE IS GONE!”

The idea of it sent a shiver down my spine. I shook. I didn’t even want to imagine who or what picked it up.

“Ok, ok. Go put the second one,” I said.

“Isn’t it your turn now?”

“Come on, dude. Just go. I’ll do the last one.”

“FUCK! Ok.”

He stepped in again, with the same careful steps, and placed the yellow rose on the carpet. Came back as fast as the last time.

Tick. Tock. Tick. Tock. Tick. Tock.

“Ok. You go check now if it’s gone, and then put the last one,” he said.

I nodded against my will.

I opened the door slowly and peeked from the corner. I looked inside. My eyes were blurry, still adjusting to the darkness, as it was getting darker by the minute. I couldn’t see anything at all — forget the rose, I was so nervous I couldn’t even see the carpet.

“What’s taking you so long? Is it there or is it not?” he asked.

“Wait a second. My eyes are blurry. I think it’s gone.”

“Oh THANK GOD!” he said. “Go put the last one.”

“Hey, what if it’s a trap?”

He stood for a second, not saying anything, thinking about it.

“I don’t think so. Everything is working like this guy said it would. If it was a trap, something would’ve happened the second time I went in, right?”

“Right. Right.”

“Ok. Go on then. Don’t overthink it.”

“Ok. Ok. I’ll go.”

I stepped in slowly, knees shaking like crazy. Every atom in my body screamed at me to run back. The silence was deafening. I was at the brink of collapsing — heavy breathing, sweating. I kneeled down and felt with my hands if the other rose was there. It wasn’t. So I put my right hand in my jacket’s inside pocket to pull the last rose…

Then I heard a loud flick.

I froze.

I closed my eyes.

Waited for something to happen.

I was ready to go.

“Dad?”

I heard a voice calling. A little girl’s voice. I opened my eyes slowly. There was a light coming from the back.

“Dad, is that you?” the little girl called again.

I turned and saw the light coming from the kitchen, on the right side of the door, where my brother’s silhouette stood, frozen. I couldn’t see his face, because the light was coming from behind him, but that’s not what I was looking at first — I was looking at the floor leading to the kitchen.

There was a little girl sleeping on the floor, peeking her head up a little, looking scared.

“W-what…what are you doing here?”

“I came with Mom earlier. She said you’d meet us here. I must’ve fallen asleep because I was tired. When I woke up, it was very dark and I was scared,” she said quietly, her voice breaking. “Dad, can you please take me? I’m scared.”

My parental instincts kicked in. I forgot about everything and immediately stood up, went to her, and picked her up. She wrapped her tiny arms around my neck and buried her face in my chest. She was extremely cold.

“Oh baby, I’m sorry. You must’ve been scared to death.”

“I’m still scared, Daddy.”

“I’m here now, baby. Don’t be.”

I turned around slowly to my brother. I was slowly starting to see his features again as my eyes adjusted to the lights. Suddenly, I remembered again why we were here. His eyes were bulging. He was visibly shaking, cold sweat running down his face.

“What’s wrong?” I asked.

“Wh-who were you talking to right now?” he asked, frightened.

“The kid… my daughter.”

“Yo-you don’t have a daughter.”

And the door slammed shut.
