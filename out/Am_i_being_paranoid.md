Intense night doing urbex, maybe i was just being paranoid but definitely the creepiest night of my life
For context- im James m21 and with my cousins Ethan, m23 and Alex, m19. We went urban exploring. This was our 3rd time doing urbex and it happened last week.

I want to document how strange this whole ordeal was. So im writing this down. It was quite a warm day so we packed a large amount of water.
I remember seeing the 12 bottles Alex had put in the Ethans campervan before we left along with a pack of marlboro cigarettes and some beers to get through the heat.

The drive was far longer than our previous urbex trips and i noticed the change of environment as the route only seemed to get more desolate. 
Once we arrived Ethan parked the van in a shaded area by some trees.

It was a broad building and visably worn, i thought it was really cool and probably going to be our most interesting trip.
We walked in the building and split up for a while, personally i wanted to find leftover belongings or something i could sell, but i know Ethan was here for the exploring.

I met back with Alex and he showed me an elevator. It looked like an older form of evelator with bars infront of it, almost boxed off.

But now we knew there was a lower level we both wanted to find it before Ethan, as Ethan usually discovers the interesting stuff. I see a door close by and open it to show a large flight of stairs which leads downwards underneath the building.

Alex calls Ethan and we walk down the passage of stairs which only seemed to get darker, in the moment i could feel Alex's warm breath on the back of my neck.

I said to him 'Alex your too close'
He replied 'turn around'. 
When i turned around Alex seemed to be atleast 3 feet away from me, that left me slightly surprised. I do have claustrophobia so i brushed it off.

During such a hot day, suddenly it felt rather cold. The further we went, the smaller the passage seemed to get, making our footsteps sound slightly louder as we descended.
In the moment i thought i could hear a fourth persons footsteps, coming down after us. Ethan suddenly stopped.

 'is something wrong?' i asked him and to my shock he replied
'just an echo i suppose' before Continuing further. I suddenly realised he had heard the exact same footsteps as me. I actually wasn't imagining it.
I looked back and realised alex seemed pale 'are you alright Alex?' 
I asked, hoping he would confirm hearing other footsteps but he simply said 'im fine' and continued walking, which really fucked with me.
Maybe it really was just an echo and i was over reacting. I just continue walking until we come to a hault.

I dont know what this building was previously used for but it reminded me of a parking lot. Large empty space with racks of some sort lined across it.
Ethan brought up the absolutely fucking brilliant idea of splitting up to search for interesting things, i nervously snapped back with 'Alex stick with me'

It definitely felt colder but much more quiet without the echoing sound of footsteps down a corridor. We slowly tried out best to search the racks in darkness.
For a couple of minutes before i heard a very small piercing sound through the air, around some racks near us, it sounded so much like wheezing, like deep breathing.

I knew Ethan had asthma so i whispered lightly across the racks

'Ethan, do you need your inhaler?' 
No response. 

'Ethan i have your inhaler if you need it'
Still, no Ethan.

Alex shouted 'Ethan where are you'

'Im over here, calm down.'
The sudden horror crept in as we both realised ethan was at the other end of the hall
I looked back at Alex and i say to him 'i dont feel great, lets go'
He responded with
'Ethan we're heading back now, let's go'

I actually ran towards the corridor and since it was dark i hit my foot against the first step but i didnt care, i just wanted to get out,
I actually fractured my foot because of this but the adrenaline made it feel like nothing.

I ran up the stairs, our running definitely shook Ethan since we could hear him begin to run back to the entrance as well. As soon as i made it to the top i just dashed outside and towards the van.
I turned around and realised Alex was choking. I run back and hit his back violently. He coughed up a lit cigarette he had swallowed, we made it to the van and jumped straight in.

Nobody wanted to mention how tense the moment was, but i could tell Alex was stressed. By now he had smoked 8 cigarettes already, and the pack was crumpled from his clenching.
I regret leaving Ethan but at the time adrenaline was my only sense of reasoning. Finally Ethan walks out looking incredibly pissed.

He gets in the van and slams the door 
'How about my fucking inhaler Alex'
He said, while wheezing. After this incident I didn't know what to think, here i am writing this down at midnight. I know i wont be able to sleep without a lamp on, am i being paranoid?
