I think I was hallucinating when I saw a swollen head staring at me from the shelves decorated with action figures.

After a few blinks, it disappeared.

Which left me sitting there in silence, just the background sound of the game my cousin was playing.

I was at Dawson’s house.

I came here to relax for a while. But he said he’d found this “really interesting website” where you could play a bunch of free games.

He celebrated with joy after every win...

But failed to notice something was wrong with his room.

The lights sometimes flickered.

And that swollen head...

It kept.... glitching.

One time, I heard his mom calling from downstairs.

“Yo, Alex! Complete this round for me!”



He handed me his controller and left without a second thought.

I sat in front of the screen, trying to ignore the weirdness I’d been seeing. The best distraction? Focusing on the game.

But the game was complicated,
definitely not something I could just pick up. I messed up fast. His perfect winning streak was broken.

The character Dawson had been playing died.

I figured I’d just wait until he got back-

Then the monitor went black.

A single message appeared on the screen:


____

<You have died.
DID YOU LOCK THE DOOR?>

<YES>    <NO>

____

I froze while I stared at the question. My eyes slowly drifted to the side.

The door was open.

I don’t know what came over me. Something tugged at me. Pulled me out of the chair like I didn’t have a choice.

I walked to the door. Shut it.

Locked it.

Walked back, sat down. And clicked 

<YES.>

The screen glitched violently. Just for a second. Then, new text:


____

 <PLEASE FOLLOW THE RULES AND ENJOY YOUR EXPERIENCE AT ███████████>




I blinked.

What rules?

I exited the game. It brought me to the homepage. A weird interface stared back at me:

▪︎ Player: Zizi_111  
▪︎ Status: ACTIVE  
• Game History  
• Find Games You May Like  
• 《Rules.txt》

______

I clicked the rules file without thinkin

I didn’t waste any time.


《If You Are a Player》

1. Please close the door if you lose any game levels.


2. Keep playing until you win to exit the room.
(It will try to replace you if you keep losing.)


3. Do NOT give your personal information to ANY games.


4. If you hear knocking—DO NOT OPEN.


5. It's best not to play with anyone else in the room.
THEY MIGHT LOSE THEIR IDENTITY OR GET REPLACED.

______

I stared at the list.

Was this real?

My blood ran cold. Every instinct screamed at me to walk away, to shut it down, to leave.

But…

I’d already lost a round.

According to the rules—I had to keep playing.

I backed out of the rules file and clicked "Find Games."

It gave me a suggestion immediately:


______

‘Games of Truths’
<Best option for you>

______

I hesitated. I just needed to win one round. That’s it.

Then I could leave.


<You have three hearts. ♡♡♡
Do you want to start?>



The monitor dimmed. Black background. Red text with no music. Only silence. 

I clicked <YES.>


---

< 1. Is your name Alexander?>


My heart skipped. How did they know?
I looked around. The room was silent. The lights still. Nothing visibly off.

But inside I was spiraling.

I didn’t want to play anymore.

But I wanted to leave.

 <No.>



< 2. Are you sure?>


“..."

<Yes>


<3. Are you Zizi_111?>



That was Dawson’s username.
So... maybe they’re just asking because I’m on his account?

 <Yes.>


<4. Are you sure?>

<Yes>

< 5. Are you lying?>

"..."

<No.>

<6. Have you seen a swollen head in the room?>



That’s when my stomach dropped.
I stood up, scanning the room, every shadow, every corner.

Was there a camera?
Was someone watching me?

I sat back down slowly, .

<Yes.>



[You lost. ♡♡]
<Try again?



The text blinked on the screen in an angry red.
My hands were shaking.

I think they knew I lied.

But I couldn’t give them my real information…

Could I?

I stared at the screen.
The red font practically vibrated.
It sent goosebumps crawling across my skin.

They knew my name.
They knew I lied.

But I couldn’t tell them the truth either.

So… I tried again.

This time, I said I was Alexander.
They asked if I was Zizi_111. I said yes.

Then came the next questions:


---

< 3. Are you a player?>

<Yes>

4. Are you sure?

<Yes>

Then again—

< 4. Have you seen a swollen head in the room?>



I answered honestly this time.

<Yes.>




 [You lost ♡
Not all your answers are correct.]
<Try again?>





I stared at the monitor, my reflection warped in the black screen.

Something wasn’t right. Then I noticed the pattern.

Whenever I told the truth, they never asked if I was sure. Only when I was lying. 

That’s when it hit me.

They weren’t trying to trick me with questions.
They were filtering me.

And this game...
This wasn’t about winning.
It was about categorizing who or what I was.

So, I played it their way.

This time, I told them:

—Yes, I’m Alexander.
—No, I’m not Zizi_111.
—And… no, I’m not a player.

They didn’t ask me if I was sure.

They just moved on.

No questions about the swollen head this time.

Instead-


 Knock. Knock.


“Alex! Hurry! Open the door!
I gotta grab something real quick!
Mom needs it!”

Dawson’s voice, right outside the room. But I remembered the rules.

 4. If you hear knocking, DO NOT OPEN.



I froze.

I didn’t move.
Didn’t speak.

I looked back at the monitor.


< 4. Is there someone behind you?>


My hands trembled. I could barely breathe.

I swallowed hard, then pressed No.



<5. Are you sure?>



Tears formed instantly.

"...Yes."


< 6. WILL IT TRY TO TAKE YOUR IDENTITY OR LIFE?>



I stared at the question. I didn’t answer.

Because right then...

I felt it.

The air shifted.

Something was behind me.

Something that didn’t knock.

Something that had always been in the room.

<No>


< 6. ARE YOU SURE?>



And still-
the knocking continued.
That’s when I realized...

They never considered me the player.

Dawson was the registered user.
Zizi_111.
The one protected by the first four rules.

I wasn’t.

I was just… there. Another presence in the room.

A target.

The first four rules were never for me.

Only the last one was:

“Don’t play with anyone else in the room.
They might lose their identity. Or get replaced.”



I stopped playing.

Didn’t answer any more questions.

Didn’t turn around.

I stood up, rushed to the door. Tried to open it- It wouldn’t unlock. Panic gripped me.

I banged on the door.

Once.

Twice.

Harder.

Louder.

LOUDER.

I screamed. I cried.
From the other side, I heard Dawson panic.

I don’t remember what happened after that. Because this whole thing is assumed of what actually happened. 

So, Dawson was recording his games... which ended up recording what I was playing..

I blacked out as my head started ringing, that is all I remember. 

When I woke up, I was in a hospital bed.
Surrounded by strangers.

Except one,
Dawson.

He was the only person I recognized. He told me I’d been found unconscious in his room... Unresponsive as I bleed from my ear, nose and mouth. 

The doctors ran tests. Said I had no drugs or internal.

Just… memory loss.

Severe.

When my “parents” came to visit...I didn’t know them.

Same with my sister.

But DNA proved it.
I was their son.

It was awkward at first.
Hard to connect with people who knew me when I didn’t even know myself.

But over time…
We grew close again.

They tried. I tried.

Dawson helped me a lot.

But sometimes....
I still wonder if I’m really me.

Because I have memories that don’t feel like mine.

Flashes of places I’ve never been.
Conversations I’ve never had.
A life that doesn’t feel like this one.
