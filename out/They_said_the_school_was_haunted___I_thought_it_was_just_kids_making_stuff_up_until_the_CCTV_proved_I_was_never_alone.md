I work night shift as a security guard at a small private school. It's old. Been around since the '60s the kind of building with creaky floors, long hallways, and lights that flicker for no reason. People always said it was haunted. Typical rumors. A student who died on campus, a nun who hung herself in the chapel, a headless janitor. You know, the usual. I never believed any of that crap. Until last week.

That night was like any other. 10:30 PM. Rainy. Whole campus was dead silent except for the buzzing of old fluorescent lights. My job was to check the classrooms one by one. Make sure no windows were left open. 

No lights on.

Simple routine. 

I started on the first floor and made my way up. Everything felt normal… until I hit the third floor. That’s when I noticed it.

Room 6. 

The door was slightly open. 

Now, that room's always locked. It’s an unused classroom. Been empty for years. I’ve never seen anyone go in or out. 

I pushed the door open slowly. 
The lights were off… 

But the air felt weird. Heavy. Like the kind of pressure you feel before a storm. And sitting at one of the desks, in the back there was a child. Just sitting there. Small frame. Pale skin. Short hair. Back turned to me.

At first I thought maybe it was a squatter’s kid who got in. I stepped in slowly. 

Hey!! What are you doing here? No response. 

I took one more step and the kid turned around. The face was blank. No expression. Eyes wide open, but completely black. Like two holes. And then it smiled.

I backed out of the room immediately. Heart pounding. Hands shaking. The hallway was empty, but I could still feel something… Behind me. I turned the corner fast only to see the same child standing at the end of the hallway. Not moving. Just watching.

I started walking faster. Tried not to look. Tried to rationalize it. Maybe I was just tired. Maybe it was a prank. Then I heard it. Small bare feet slapping against the tiles behind me. I turned again. The hallway was empty. But the sound didn’t stop. This time it’s faster and closer

I ran. Took the nearest stairwell, not caring where I ended up. I looked down the steps and there it was. The child. Standing halfway down the stairs. Head tilted. Arms hanging loosely. Then it twitched, like a broken puppet and charged up the stairs toward me.

I don’t remember how I got out. I just remember screaming. Running. Almost falling down the steps. Next thing I knew, I was outside the gate — knees scraped, chest heaving — and then everything went black. I collapsed.

The next morning, they found me on the ground. The admin reviewed the CCTV to figure out what happened. But here’s the part that still makes my skin crawl. 

I never exited the building. According to the footage, I walked up to the third floor at 10:47 PM. Then I stood at the top of the stairwell. And I didn’t move. Not for minutes. Not for hours. Just standing there. Frozen. Until 3:17 AM when I suddenly collapsed, mid-step, like someone pulled the plug.

But the worst part. Right before I fell, the camera caught something else. A small shape, slowly crawling up the stairs behind me. The child. Except its body was distorted. Too thin. Limbs too long. Crawling on all fours. And right before the footage glitches. It smiles at the camera.

They’ve let me take time off since then. But I keep seeing that kid. In reflections. In dreams. 

Last night I heard bare feet on my hallway floor at 3 AM. And when I checked my phone camera this morning. The last photo was a screenshot of the CCTV feed.

Except… I’m smiling in it. 
And I swear I don’t remember smiling at all.
