*Remain on the main road.*

*Occasionally, you will see other highways branching off Route 333. Do not take these. When you pass through towns, you may see side streets. Do not take these either.*

*Any building along the main thoroughfare is permitted: gas stations, truck stops, grocery stores, etc. Wandering through wilderness features is also permitted, though we do not advise this practice as it may distract from work-related activities.*

*Do not, however, wander onto paved side streets. You will likely never wander back.*

Surprise, surprise. I’m alive.

That shouldn’t come as much of a shock. How could I have posted my last entry if I’d died? But I assure you, sitting in the driver’s seat, watching highway patrol screech away and the deadly dark clouds roll in, I was entirely sure I *was* going to die. Randall seemed to think so.

Brownish-red drops pattered against my windshield. They rolled down the hood and dripped from the side mirrors. The drizzle soon turned into a shower, which soon turned into a downpour.

*Blood rain*―that’s the term I wish I could use. That it had stayed a simple deluge and then passed on overhead. Instead, it got worse. The wind picked up. My rig rocked side to side. A red bolt of lightning struck a far-away mountain top.

The weather transformed from a blood rain into the thing it truly was: a *meat storm.*

Chunks of *something* splattered against the windows. They exploded gore in every direction. Whole fingernails spattered the ground with the sound of hail. Loose, human-looking veins rained across the highway.

I didn’t bother with wipers. There was no surviving this, though I did try turning off the circulating air. *Too late*. By the time you smell manure on a road trip, it’s *always* too late to close the windows.  The stench of rotting flesh already filled my cab.

It was the most terrible, gory thing I’d ever seen. I should have asked, *Who?* What people had this gore been taken from? How could Route 333 possibly have caused so much death? I didn’t ask this though. Instead I passively watched the disaster unfold, oddly at peace.

Through the roar of the storm, I could make out something wailing through the back wall. The thing in the freight carrier was sobbing.

This was it. I’d taken this job on Route 333 to flee my old life, but you can’t run from one thing without running towards another. This was the thing I’d been hurtling towards. It would be easy too. So easy to just sit there, recline back, and wait.

My promise to help Tiff no longer mattered. My passion from the last few days flushed out of me as quickly as it had come, because in the end, this was the thing I truly wanted. An out. The end. A release. 

I didn’t just accept it. 

I craved it.

Across the empty desert, larger body parts rained down. Legs. Severed ears. Fist-sized, gelatinous globs I assumed were organs, that burst on impact like cans of soup. Something slammed against my windshield. A rotting arm with each finger severed at the knuckle.

It tumbled away but too late. Already cracks spiderwebbed out from the point of impact to match my side window.

*Any second now…*

And then, another truck appeared through the storm. 

The tempest bore down. The other vehicle flickered between visible and hidden, through sheets of blood rain. Where had it come from? There hadn't been anybody else. The weather had turned so quickly that I should have seen them beforehand in the distance. 

I watched as their rig slowed to a stop just a short stretch of road away. The driver’s side door flew open, and a figure threw themselves out into the storm.

 What happened next occurred in quick succession. There was a pop. The cab and front of their rig crumpled inwards like someone squeezing an empty soda can. Their shriveled hood burst into flames but was put out by the rain. The enormous freight carrier collapsed inwards in much the same way, going from 3D to 2D in a millisecond.

The entire vehicle groaned, teetered, then toppled to the side.

*Holy…*

A pounding on my window. It took me a beat to register what was happening. *The other driver. The person.* 

I unrolled my window. A nightmarish, entrail-laden person looked up at me. I couldn’t even tell the gender.

“*What are you doing!*” they screamed through the wind. “*Get out of here!*”

*“What about you?”*

*“What about me?”*

*“You don’t want a ride*?” I yelled.

“*I’d love a ride, but I’m not asking for one, am I?*”

Was this a vampire and a threshold situation? Why were they acting so odd? Despite the storm, and the crumpled truck, and the intestines raining from the sky, I experienced a jolt of fear. Was this the real way I died from using my phone? Had the road set up this whole elaborate situation to get me to *let in* this stranger?

I hovered my hand above the gear shift.

This was like Myra all over again. This person looked harmless, but they would kill me, or eat me, or any number of terrible things if I opened the door. Wasn’t that one of the first rules? Never pick up hitchhikers.

It clicked.

“*Get in,*” I screamed, and threw open my door.

Blood and entrails splattered me. The trucker clambered up the side, scrambled over me, and collapsed in the passenger seat.

“Took you long enough,” they spat. *She,* I now realized.

She wasn’t a hitchhiker. She’d waited for me to offer a ride before coming in so I would know I could trust her. Maybe this was still a trick of Route 333, but I got the sense there were some rules even it couldn’t break.

She panted and clutched her chest, but when I just sat there, she pounded the dashboard. “Go, you idiot!”

I did. We peeled out and careened the way she’d come.

“It should be lessening,” she said after a minute. “It already got my rig. It should be appeased.” The girl spotted my phone in the cupholder. “OH MY GOSH, YOU HAVEN’T GOTTEN RID OF THIS YET?”

She unrolled the window, and flicked it into the storm.

“Hey! That’s my―” But I had good enough sense to shut up. 

*Really, Brendon*, I chided myself. *Priorities.*

We drove.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Within minutes the storm had lessened. Hefty livers and lungs lightened to spleens and eyeballs. Eventually, everything solid stopped falling. The rust-colored rain diluted until it was clear, pure water. Maybe by the time we stopped, my truck would be semi-clean.

The inside, however, would not be.

In the passenger seat, the girl dripped with blood. Sinuous intestinal bits dangled from her chin. A puddle of what looked like stomach bile pooled at her feet from a fleshy pouch that had gotten tangled in her hair, and warm, rotting carcass filled the air. She spat repeatedly. “It’s in my mouth. *Ugh*!”

“Do you want a towel? There should be one―”

She tore the top sheet from my sleeper bed.

I bit my tongue. She’d just been through something traumatic. She deserved to do whatever she―

She ripped off the rest of the blankets.

“Okay,” I said. “I seriously just offered you a―”

“What kind of idiot uses their phone!” 

“Uh…”

“You owe me a truck by the way. You’re lucky I was there to take the fallout for your stupid decisions.”

“Well, *you're* lucky I was there to pick you up,” I shot back.

“I would be fine if you hadn't been there. Again. You were the one on the phone.”

“There wasn’t any other option. It was the only way to get rid of the cops.”

“You were *speeding* too?”

I forced myself to take three deep breaths.

Why were we arguing? Here we were, strangers covered in entrails, almost having died in the worst possible way imaginable, and already arguing about who to blame (for the record, my vote’s on Randall). I wasn’t even totally sure we were out of the danger zone yet.

“Pull over,” she said.

“What? Why?”

“Just pull over.”

I did, and she retched out the window. She wiped her mouth and re-composed herself. “K, let’s go.”

“One sec.”

I leaned out my own window and puked myself. We both took another few turns―it was like we’d been holding out until this moment―then set back out, ignoring the persisting smell of death.

She wrung out her hair onto my seat. “There’s showers in the town just past that ridge.”

“I’ve driven this way before. I don’t remember any towns nearby.”

“Not for you, no. Where do you think I came from? I’m lane-locked.”

I stared at her questioningly.

“Don’t you know anything about how the road works?” she asked. “We’re going my speed now. Otherwise every lane-locked driver could just get a ride back to civilization with a faster driver. I was just in a town an hour ago.”

The explanation made sense. Otherwise rescuing people like Tiff would be easy. It also explained why I hadn't seen her rig before she’d appeared in the storm: she’d been in her own pocket of the road I didn’t have access to yet.

The further we drove, the more unfamiliar the landscape appeared. We were only about a day from civilization, but I’d never driven here. In the far off distance were familiar mountains, but they were smaller than I'd ever seen them. Hours away, rather than minutes.

*And the cars,* I realized. We were no longer the only ones on the road. Jeeps and mini-vans rushed occasionally from the opposite direction, filled with families and couples. The other drivers had mentioned this would happen once the road elongated enough. It would start filling with other traffic, but I hadn't spent much brain-power on it. That point was still months away for me. I’d gotten so used to the eeriness of the empty road, this sudden fullness was even eerier.

“You’re new, aren't you?” the girl asked. “This is all still fresh to you.”

“It is.”

“I’m Autumn by the way.”

“Brendon.”

“Well, Brendon, you’re officially the first real person I’ve talked to this year, and you’ve done a splendid job reaffirming my hopes you’re the last person I talk to this year.”

“I really am sorry about your truck. Does Randall know about you?” I paused. “He probably thinks I’m dead by now. Hand me the radio, would you?”

“Radio? What rad―” Autumn felt under her leg in the pool of liquid. She pulled out the dripping handheld and attempted switching it on. “Uh. Bad news.” 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The town was quaint. I wondered if the variety of town was different for lane-locked individuals―a consolation prize of sorts―or if we’d just gotten lucky. There was a main street with hanging flowers from every lightpost, and a farmer’s market at a nearby park full of running children. Best of all, though? The truck-stop showers.

After my experience at Tiff’s diner, I’d resolved never to shower on the road again. After a day like today though?

Despite what the employee handbook says, some rules are meant to be broken.

I spent a whole hour scrubbing effluvia and bits of rotted skin from my nails and hair. Even when I was done, I could smell dying carcass, but I spritzed myself with gas station air conditioner and called it good. Autumn had used the rest of my clothes on our drive to wipe herself down, so I also bought an XXL ‘I HEART BEER’ shirt (I’m a medium for the record. It was the only one left.)

A few minutes later Autumn emerged from the shower rooms as well.

“You’re staring,” she said.

I was. “You look different.”

“Than when I was covered in literal human secretions? Um yeah, I do.” She gave me the once over. “You look about the same.” Then she stalked off imperiously before I could retort.

What I *hadn't* said though, the real reason I was staring, was this: Autumn looked undeniably like Myra. 

I don’t point that out to say I was attracted to her (I can already imagine the comment section. Please. Just. Don’t.), but it caught me off guard to be reminded of Myra like that. I’d finally stopped thinking about my ex-girlfriend, and here she was, on the road for the second time. Route 333 was mocking me.

I spent hours scrubbing out my cab. By evening, it looked mainly clean, but the smell was baked into the seats. *Absolutely wonderful.* It wasn’t like I had eight more days of my trip ahead of me. 

Autumn didn't offer to help, which was pretty understandable. I’d gotten her truck destroyed, and now what? I was just going to abandon her in this town without transportation. She did, however, show up once evening was set and lean against the side of the trailer. She couldn’t be much older than me. Maybe even younger.

“There’s a motel just down the street,” she said. “Not the coziest place, but you don’t have to go down any side streets, so it’s allowed. I stayed there all this week. It’s cleaner than your sleeper, and not all towns are as docile at night as during the day.”

“How long have you been stuck out here?” I asked.

Her expression darkened. “Take another shower. You reek worse than before.”

She marched away before I could respond. This was the second time she'd done that.

I paused at the back of the freight before following after her. “Sorry about today,” I whispered. “I’m sure you didn’t ask to get caught in the meat storm. I suspect you didn’t ask to be stuck in a trailer either.”

The thing said nothing. 

I leaned closer. “Do you want to come out?”

It merely sniffled.

That night was the best sleep I’d gotten on the road. Under any other circumstance, I would have been stressed beyond belief. Could the Faceless man get into motel rooms? What about highway patrol? There was nothing in the employee handbook against sleeping outside of our vehicles, but I’d escaped most of my experiences here by merely hiding in the cab. Sleeping outside of it felt somehow wrong.

I gave myself permission to relax. Autumn didn’t seem concerned, and I’d been entirely ready to die earlier. Why should I freak out now?

In the morning, I experienced something I hadn't for months: feeling rested. I grabbed an apple from the open breakfast area, and headed outside for a walk around the parking lot. The morning sun colored the clouds pink and orange―it’s always been fascinating to me. The fact that in photos sunsets and sunrises look nearly identical. The only difference is the direction.

“Brendon!”

I whirled.

Randall waved at me from an alley just beyond the parking lot. His face was a mask of relief and fatigue.

I blinked.

“You’re okay,” he said. “We weren’t sure after you stopped responding. We thought―but we weren't sure―I came straight here. I haven’t slept all night.”

I blinked again.

He pulled out a radio. “Gloria, we found him. He’s alright. He ended up in Autumn’s town. Brendon, come here. Say ‘hi’, so she knows you’re okay.”

I tilted my head.

I walked forward to the lip of the side street.

“I’m good,” I said. “We survived.”

“She can’t hear you. Here.” He offered the radio in one hand. I didn’t walk forward. “Brendon, take it.”

“Lucky you found me,” I said. 

“Tell me about it. None of the other truckers knew where you’d ended up. They told me not to come, but I had to search, and this seemed like the most likely area. You’re really fine? The cargo’s okay.”

“Cargo’s fine. Autumn’s truck got obliterated though.”

“You and I can go back in yours. She can take my car. Here, I’ll show you.” Randall gestured for me to follow him down the alley.

I stayed put.

“What is it?” I asked.

“Sorry?”

“The thing in my trunk, the living thing…why do you all want it so badly?”

“I’m not sure what you’re―”

“Oh please. That Myra clone was more convincing than your sorry self. I’ve made mistakes before, but I’m not an absolute idiot.”

For a beat, just one, Randall looked offended.

Then his expression dropped. He sneered in a cold, loathing fashion I’d never seen with the real Randall. “It doesn’t belong to you, Stone-dweller.”

“No. But I don’t think my cargo belongs to you either. At least I can take it where I want. That’s right, isn’t it? You can’t come here onto the main road.”

It scowled without answering.

“Try better next time.”

“We will devour you.”

“Maybe,” I said. “But not yet.”

I pulled an Autumn and strolled away before it could reply.

She found me behind my trailer. I don’t know how she knew to look for me there or why she was even looking for me, but when Autumn found me that’s where I was. I contemplated the blood-splattered cargo doors.

“Don’t,” she told me.

“Don’t what?”

“You’re a terrible liar. I know what you’re thinking about doing, but it’s not worth it.”

“You know what’s inside?”

She shoved her hands in a set of baggy pockets. “Management sucks. I knew this Randall you keep talking about. He’s the worst. He really is, but that doesn’t mean whatever’s in there isn’t dangerous. Terrible people can still be in charge of good causes.”

“What if we’re the ones hurting it?” I asked. “What if I’m the only one that can help it.”

“Savior complex much?”

“That’s not―”

“When you let me into your truck, you were just sitting there. It looked like you were just waiting for the end. Just focus on keeping yourself alive for now, alright?”

How did I explain that that was the issue? That when there was another person or thing that needed me I could put my foot on the pedal and drive. But when it was just me, alone, with nobody… 

I was about to voice this, but before I could, Autumn shrugged and you guessed it― strolled away.

That would get annoying quick.

I didn’t open the trunk. Not that day. But I did stop by it before I headed out to rest my hand on the cool metal. “I’ll protect you,” I whispered. “Wherever we're going, I promise you’ll at least make it.” 

The next time there was a storm, I [would drive.](https://www.reddit.com/r/lucasGandola/comments/1lklmnq/welcome/)
