This happened last Halloween, and I wasn’t planning on talking about it again. But with tonight being Halloween, people need to know.



My wife and I always loved halloween. Handing out candy, seeing all the kids in their costumes, eating all the leftover candy. It was the one night of the year we got to feel like kids again.



The night started out like any normal halloween night. Lots of door bell ringing and door knocking. The “Trick or Treats!” in perfect sync every time the door opened.



Just around 8 o clock like a record on repeat we heard the door bell ring and I went to grab the bowl of candy. My wife had ran upstairs to grab a new bag since we were beginning to run low.



A group of children showed up, maybe about 8 of them. All dressed in cute costumes. The parents standing at the edge of the driveway waiting to move on to the next house. 



“Trick or Treat!”



“Ohhh I love your costumes!” I said as I opened the door.



A doctor, a power ranger, a teddy bear, all adorable.



But there was one costume that stood out. A little boy, in a cheap looking devils costume. Plastic mask, tiny red pitchfork, candy bag in hand. 



He was the last kid to open his bag and wait for some candy. The other kids didn’t even bother waiting. I kind of felt bad so I  was going to give him a little extra.



I had just grabbed a handful of candy and was about to drop it in his bag until he looked up at me and said, *“*She’s fine*.”*



My wife was halfway down the stairs behind me when I turned around and saw her fall down the last few steps. It wasn’t a big fall, more like a stumble.



“Honey!” I said, reaching for her.



She caught herself on the handrail.



“I’m fine! Don’t worry!”



I turned around back to the door as the kid was catching up to the rest of the group.



I stood there confused. Did he say she was fine BEFORE she fell? Thats strange. I thought to myself.



I brushed it off at first. Probably a coincidence, right?



I didn’t even bother mentioning it to my wife.



The night continued on and we got a bunch more trick or treaters. Same routine, “Trick or Treat!”, candy, smiles, all the normal Halloween activities. 



Around 09:45 the doorbell rang. I figured this had to be wrapping up. I told myself this was going to be the last group I gave out candy to.



When I opened the door it was just 3 kids. One dressed as a cowboy, one dressed as a police officer, and one in a devil’s costume. I gave out the candy just as I had done all night and complimented their costumes in the process. 



I looked at the devil. 



“Hey there buddy. Didn’t I just see you a little while ago?”



No answer. Just held his bag open staring at me. 



I dropped a handful of candy in his bag, mostly to just get him moving along so I can close up shop for tonight. 



“There you go, Happy Halloween.”



As I began to shut the door, he spoke again.



“She’s sleeping now.”



I froze in place. My wife had just gone upstairs a few minutes before. She said she was going to lie down because her leg hurt from the fall earlier. 



“What did you just say?” I asked.



But the boy was already walking away, disappearing into the dark.



I closed the door and turned off the porch light.



Done for the night. 



I went upstairs to check on my wife. I just felt uneasy after that whole situation. The bedroom door was cracked open.



“Hey” I whispered as I pushed it open.



“You awake?”



Silence.



“Honey.”



No reaction.



I stepped closer. My eyes finally adjusted to the dark room. I could see the slow rise and fall of her chest. She was fine, she was probably just exhausted from the day.



I loosened up and shook it off and headed back downstairs to lock the rest of the house up. 



When I got downstairs I realized how tired I was. I needed a reset before I started cleaning up. I took a seat on the couch to rest.



I must have drifted off to sleep on the couch because I was woken up to the sound of knocks on my door. 



Startled and with my vision blurry I took a look at the clock.



11:37.



“What the hell?” I murmured to myself. 



I made my way towards the door and peaked out the window before opening.



Nobody was there. 



The motion light was on but no body was there. I kept looking out the window for a while just to make sure. I thought maybe I imagined it. Maybe I dreamt it. I didn’t have an answer. I made sure the door was still locked and turned around to make my way up the stairs. As soon as my foot hit the first step I heard again.



Another knock.



This time louder. 



Now I was concerned. Now I knew I wasn’t dreaming. I heard the knock, plain as day. I reached for the door and yanked it open in hopes I would catch whoever was knocking in the act.



Nothing. 



Just a cold breeze brushing past me. 



I had a shiver, from the cold breeze or the situation at hand I wasn’t sure.



I was just about to close the door when I heard my wife screaming. 



Without thinking I sprinted up the stair case and burst through our bedroom door.



My wife was sitting up. Sweating. Out of breath.



“I had a nightmare.” She whispered.



“What happened?!”



“I saw him.” She said. “I saw a little boy standing in the doorway.”



I went over to her and held her. Calmed her down the best I could.



She looked at me and said “I don’t want to go to sleep right now. I’m scared.”



I told her it was okay and that we can go downstairs and make some popcorn and watch a movie.



We made our way out of the bedroom and down the stairs. It was just then I realized I never shut the door. And that’s when I noticed it.



The plastic red pitchfork on our welcome mat.



We called the police. They searched the house and came up with nothing. I told them what happened and they chalked it up to some kids playing pranks on Halloween.



I still think about that night every day. 



We don’t celebrate Halloween anymore. 

We refuse to even open the door.
