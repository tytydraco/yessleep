Have you ever believed in the supernatural? Well, I’ve always considered myself to be a skeptic, believing there was always a logical explanation for every incident. Even those we couldn’t fully comprehend.

Not until what I saw on my first day of high school. Believe me, I was ecstatic to meet new people, make some friends. What I’m about to share with you will sound ridiculous, however, I wish to post this for 2 reasons.

The first is that I need to get this off my chest. I always wanted to be a writer anyway, so this is a good chance to practice I suppose. The second, well, I will not tell you yet.

It was Monday morning, approximately 8:10 a.m. I hadn’t slept very well and had missed breakfast, but I was still full of energy. I had already seen the school building, which was within expectations and after a long speech by the principal, we settled in our assigned classrooms.

The teacher hadn’t arrived yet, so I sat in the back of the class as I observed the students happily chatting with each other. It seemed like the other students were already acquainted. Unfortunately, I’m not very social, so I had a hard time striking up a conversation.

“How dull.”

“You seem fairly bored.” Someone said from my right. A blonde-haired girl was looking at me while wearing an awkward smile. It was then I realized I had said it out loud.

“Ah! Sorry about that, it honestly slipped haha!” I said, desperately trying to salvage a good first impression.

"Oh, don't worry about it. Orientation day can be pretty boring, especially if you're new around here." Her smile shifted slightly.

“I moved here last month, since my father got a new job around town." she added.

“Ah, you’re in the same boat as me then. By the way, what’s your name?” I said in a more relaxed tone.

"My name is Olivia, nice to meet you." She extended her arm.

"I'm Alex, likewise." I replied as I shook her hand.

As I chatted with Olivia for a while, we suddenly heard the door open. Assuming that the teacher had arrived, the remaining students took their seats. Only it wasn’t the teacher.

“Ah, hello there.” A brown-haired man who appeared to be in his early twenties entered, his gaze lingering on the classroom as if he were searching for something. That wasn’t very unusual, since he could’ve been a student who was, perhaps, late and was looking for the right classroom. What was odd were his clothes. Or rather, his lack of clothes.

He was walking shirtless and barefoot. Only wearing black track pants and carrying a blue duffel bag, which seemed to bulge as if holding something more than just books.

A student sitting in one of the front desks asked: “Anything we can help you with, mate?”

“I’m looking for a pig.” He replied with a carefree smile on his face. This caused the class, including me, to burst out laughing at him. However, I couldn’t help but feel like something was up.

Olivia seemed to share a similar feeling as well. She wasn’t laughing, instead she looked like she’d seen a ghost, very pale. Before I got to ask her what was wrong, the man spoke up again.

“Jeez, you guys are gonna laugh at me too? I even made a sketch.” The man said, looking rather  gloomy. Afterwards he pulled out a sketchbook from his bag and showed it to the class.

This time there was silence in the classroom. Everybody looked confused as they were unsure of how to react. What was depicted in the sketchbook was very detailed. Even I, who didn’t know much about drawing, could tell as much. The sketch was that of a person.

“Has anybody seen it?” The man unhinged by the awkwardness of the situation continued.

“I really have to find it before it starts causing trouble you see.” He added.

I was dumbfounded, unsure of whether this was a prank or not. The man however didn’t look like he was joking, despite his odd demeanor. On a closer look at the sketch, I recognized who it was.

It was our math teacher, mister Cameron. I had run into him while on a tour of the school some days ago. He seemed very reliable and caring, unlike that man’s characterization of a pig.

The man looked around the class as he waited for an answer when he spoke up again.

“Hmm, seems like you guys don’t know either huh? Alrighty then, I’ll look elsewhere. Have a nice day!”  He excitedly said, as he held up a peace sign. As soon as he left, the class resumed talking again, pretending this weird occurrence was nothing more than a joke.

Olivia on the other hand was breathing heavily, sweat dripping down her face.

“Do you want to go to the nurse’s office?” I asked, as I put my hand on her shoulder. She nodded and we both headed out of the class while receiving a glance or two from our classmates.

As we headed down the hall, I started to feel uneasy again. I wasn’t sure if it was because Olivia wasn’t feeling well or if it was something else. You know that paranoia when you watch a horror movie at night and afterwards you can’t help but turn the lights on?

It was similar to that feeling. With each step we took, I felt the gentle breeze cool my face.  It was a nice sunny day and the beginning of a new chapter in my life. Was I just being nervous about that? The nurse’s office was just around the corner when I suddenly saw him. It was Mr Cameron.

“Ah, hello Mr Cameron. My classmate here is not feeling very well so I was taking her to the nurses office.”  I said, startled, as I almost bumped into him.

However, Mr Cameron didn’t reply. He just looked at me as if in a daze.

“Mr Cameron? Is everything alright?” I added, as I grew more concerned by the minute.

This time Mr Cameron smiled at me. I reflectively smiled back and as I was about to ask why he was smiling, everything went upside down. I couldn’t feel my hands nor my legs, nor anything besides my head really. It was then I noticed the sharp claws that had replaced Mr Cameron's right hand.

He chopped my head off. As I heard Olivia scream, everything faded to black. It was only 2 seconds, yet they felt like hours. Suddenly, I heard a familiar voice from my right.

“Alex, are you okay?” Olivia looked at me with a concerned look on her face.

I jumped back from my seat and fell to the floor. Everybody was looking at me, but I didn’t care. I couldn’t even hear them at that point. My heart was racing, and I couldn’t stop trembling. My neck was throbbing.

I wasn’t injured, but my body still remembered that one split second of pain and that terrified me. Olivia was trying to speak to me, but I ignored her and sprinted out of the classroom. Did I somehow fall asleep in class and all of that was just a nightmare? Impossible. I’ve never had such an intense nightmare in my life.

Hundreds of thoughts were racing through my head, but the conclusion was the same. I need to get out of this school, right now.

As I ran like a madman through the school halls, I could see the exit in front of me. Still, I stopped dead in my tracks.

“Ah, hello there.”

It was him, that man I saw earlier. I couldn’t speak, I really wanted to but couldn’t. My teeth were chattering, my legs and lungs aching from sprinting.

“I’m looking for a pi- are you alright?”  His carefree smile replaced with a curious expression.

At that moment, someone grabbed my shoulder from behind. It was Olivia, she had chased after me.

“Relationship problems huh? Happens to the best of us man.” He said as he patted me on the back.

“What? We’re not.. Never mind, are you okay? I’m sorry if I offended you.” Olivia said in a hurry.

“I-it’s not your fault.” I barely mustered the words.

“Have you guys seen a pig by any chance? I even made a sketch.” The man said as he pulled out his sketchbook.  Olivia started to tense up once more after hearing that.

“Why are you calling Mr Cameron a pig? I muttered.

The man’s expression shifted, from a look of surprise to a wide grin forming on his face.

“So you’ve seen it huh? Nice! Can you please take me to where it is?” The man replied, overflowing with excitement.

Images of Mr Cameron then flashed in my mind and I fell to my knees. Olivia somewhat snapped out of it and tried to console me. I didn’t have a lot of energy left, so I tried to alert the both of them:

“It’s not safe here, we have to get out of this school immediately.”

“No can do, I need to take care of the pig first you see. I can’t leave, otherwise I’ll feel guilty.” The man replied as he sat on the floor with us.

“You two get out of here if you want, it’s enough to know that its in here. I’ll quickly take care of it.”

Olivia tugged at my sleeve, presumably to ask what the hell we were talking about. But before we could talk, the man spoke up.

“There you are.” Me and Olivia looked in surprise as Mr Cameron was slowly making his way toward us.

His whole body was covered in blood, with both his hands enveloped in sharp claws. As our eyes met, for the first time I was grateful I hadn’t eaten breakfast since I could hardly resist the urge to throw up with that smell.

Mr Cameron, no, that thing had just killed a lot of people. That foul stench emanating from it was overwhelming. I could only describe it as death. Olivia started crying and covered her face with her hands.

“Not again! Please god not again!” Olivia was hysterical.

“Don’t worry, leave it to me.” The man said as he walked towards Mr Cameron. I wanted to stop him, but every cell in my body was telling me to run for my life. Not only that, I wanted to get Olivia out safely if possible as well.

As I attempted to calm myself down by taking deep breaths, I heard it. Clank. The man was now wielding an axe he removed from his bag.

“I’ll cut you up real good you little shit.” He said as he pointed his axe at Mr Cameron.

“***I have the body of a pig***.” Said Mr Cameron in a distorted voice. That thing spoke for the first time and that’s what it wanted to say? Maybe that’s why that man called it a pig. Strangely enough, it wasn’t looking at the man. It was staring right at me.

“Yeah? And what’s new?” After the man said that, all hell broke loose. It was like a scene out of an action movie, despite that, all of it was real. I couldn’t take my eyes out of that sight, the man and Mr Cameron swung at each other at ridiculous speeds. The man was more impressive than anything, he could keep up with that monster or he possibly was even faster than it, since he would occasionally land a hit or two at that thing.

As I snapped back to reality, I grabbed Olivia and moved towards the exit. We had to call the police, the army, anyone at this point. I think it was a fair assumption to say that Mr Cameron couldn’t do much against gunfire.

As we were about to reach the door, I heard an ear splitting screech. It was so loud that both me and Olivia dropped to the ground. I turned around and saw that man had managed to cut both of Mr Cameron's arms off and it was in pain. I clenched my teeth and dragged Olivia towards the door. As I did, due to my poor hearing, I faintly heard that man yell something.

All of a sudden, I felt the ground vibrate as something was fast approaching behind me. Without looking back, I picked up Olivia and jumped to the side, barely hearing a thud to my right. It was Mr Cameron and he had 4 arms this time. Fantastic, he can grow back and develop new arms? Oh, and don’t forget the claws too. However, his head was almost split in half. Which apparently resulted in it becoming slower. At least that's what it looked like to me.

As Mr Cameron was getting ready to attack, I tried to think of anything I could do. Was I going to die again? This time for good? Why the hell is this happening to me? Despite the despair I was experiencing, from the corner of my eye I noticed the man was also very close to us. All he needed was a second to catch up.

That’s when I discovered that Olivia had brought along my bag for me. I was too distressed to notice, but no wonder she felt a little heavier than expected. With the last of my willpower, I tossed my back at Mr Cameron which he instantly tore to shreds. But that was more than enough.

In the blink of an eye, that man chopped off Mr Cameron’s head and the rest of its body until it stopped moving. With adrenaline slowly fading away, accompanied with my sheer exhaustion, I lost consciousness.

I woke up in a  hospital a couple of hours later and was told I had no major injuries. I hadn't felt it at the time but apparently Mr Cameron managed to graze me on the back. Those claws were really sharp indeed.

Next to my bed was Olivia and the man.

“Oh, he’s awake Olivia! Look! Look!” He said as he jumped up and down like a kid.

“Alex, how are you feeling?” Said Olivia as she sat beside my bed.

“I’ve been better.” I briefly replied.

“What happened with Mr Cameron?”

“It’s fucking dead man, and it’s partially thanks to you! You should be proud of yourself.” The man proudly declared.

“Alex, I think it’s best you see for yourself.” Olivia said as she handed me her phone.

In front of me was a local news coverage video about a shooting that occurred at my school. As I was still a little out of it, I only made out some sentences.

Earlier today, a school shooting took place at \*\*\*\*\*\* high school. Suspect was shot and killed after exchanging fire with police. With the unfortunate death of 19 students, the school promises greater security measures in order for this incident to never take place again.

“Wait a second, is the government covering up this whole incident? Also, what’s with the 19 students?” I asked, growing ever so agitated.

“Calm down Alex, I can explain. To answer your second question, the 19 students were killed by the pig. As for your first question, it’s not the government covering it up, I assure you.” The man answered sincerely.

“God, then who is responsible?” I replied feeling helpless.

“Its them man, the pigs. My theory is that this is their self-defense mechanism of sorts. In other words, they are able to bend reality to an extent so they can survive. If these things were to run rampant, humanity would eventually wipe them out.”

“How do you-“ I tried to respond, but the man cut me off.

“I’ve come across them many times man, each and every time though there’s one thing in common. Police never showed up, nor anybody questioned about how the victims really died. Even if the conclusion is severely lacking in logic, that’s the conclusion everyone reaches. At least almost everyone. And here I thought I was the only one.”

“You and Olivia both remember what actually transpired in that school right?”

We both nodded.

“Exactly! There are some who are immune to their influence. And it seems I’ve come across 2 of them.” He proudly proclaimed as he patted both our heads.

“Alright, I find this very hard to believe but setting that aside, what comes next? Speaking of which, where are my parents?” Said Olivia slightly anxious.

“About that, I’m afraid you won’t be seeing them in like uhm probably for the rest of your life.” Said the man with a stern look on his face.

“What?! What are you talking about?” Said Olivia as she practically screamed at him.

“Remember what I said about their influence? Well, they may be unable to mess with your mind, but they can still mess with the minds of other people. Including your family. I get the feeling you’ve already experienced this before, Olivia.” The man said as he took Olivia’s phone and after a few taps he showed us both an image that haunts me to this day.

It was like my life had crumbled before my eyes. Which it literally had. Depicted on the phone was a catalogue of all the victims of the “shooting”. Among the victims were both me and Olivia.

“What are you trying to say? If I go to my family’s house right now, I can solve this fucking mess!” I tried to argue. I wanted him to be wrong, desperately so.

“I’m sorry Alex, but they won’t recognize you. Please trust me, even if you go, they may as well condemn you instead. Since, in their eyes you’re pretending to be their dead son. I know from experience.”

I had nothing to say, both me and Olivia. What the hell could we do then? Against these god forsaken monsters who took everything from us.

“Why don’t you help me out then? Since you don’t have anything to do I mean. There’s more of these things out there.” The man said.

“Are you kidding me right now? We nearly fucking died some hours ago and now you’re asking us to accompany you on a death march against these things?!” I shouted at him.

“We may be able to take back our lives.” The man replied. Both me and Olivia froze up and listened like our life depended on it.

“I’ve been doing some research regarding these things, and I get the feeling that they have a hierarchy amongst them. If we’re able to track down and beat their leading members we should be able to cancel out this influence of theirs.”

There was silence in the room. The man, understanding our current predicament, gave us time to think.

“How sure are you that this will work?” Said a barely audible Olivia as she practically whispered it.

“Hmm, about 3% sure? If the pigs are wiped out, then there’s no one left to distort reality right?” He replied.

“Take some time to think about it, you have all the time in the world. Well almost, I guess. I’ll come see you in the morning.” After that, the man left us in the hospital.

During our stay in the hospital, me and Olivia clearly gained an understanding of our situation. The hospital staff completely forgot we existed, even though they treated my wounds earlier. Sure, we could speak to them, but after a while they would just wander off without saying another word to us.

The one thing I concluded was that, when introduced to new people, it took several hours before they started to ignore us. And what I mean by ignoring us, is completely erasing our existence from their minds. To test this out, I went and punched a nurse that treated me earlier, in the face. I know, not very cool, however I was desperate to get a reaction. Any reaction would suffice at this point. All I got was “Oh, my nose is bleeding. Hey Bill! Hand me some tissues!” from there on, he headed off to chat with his colleague like nothing happened.

Olivia on the other hand appeared to be taking this pretty calmly. Or so I thought, after taking a closer look at her, her eyes looked empty. Like all life had drained out of her, a shell of her former self.

“Alex, do you know why I moved here?” Olivia broke the silence. At first glance from my previous…”life”, I  thought I already knew the reason. However, I instead let her speak.

“ I have seen one of them before, Ben. One of those pigs- or whatever the hell you want to call them. It ate 3 of my classmates in front of me. I still remember them screaming for help as I watched, too scared to move. After it was done eating, that monster just left me there. I have no idea why, yet it didn't end there.

Everyone became convinced that my carelessness somehow caused a traffic accident and the death of my 3 friends. Nobody believed me no matter what I said. Not even my own family and friends. I was so alone and as I started getting death threats, in the end, we were forced to move.” Olivia said as she bawled her eyes out.

I didn’t know what to say. Why did she have to suffer this much? And on top of that, thanks to today’s events, she no longer had her family to count on. She was truly all alone. Perhaps I was being selfish, as part of me felt relieved that I wasn’t the only one suffering. I pulled her into a hug.

“Olivia, let’s live through this. Even if our chances are slim, I think we should fight. I truly don’t know what’s gonna happen to us from now on. That being said, I don’t think we deserve to be in this situation, so please don’t give up on me just yet. And if it means anything, it wasn’t your fault those 3 died. At least you have someone that finally believed you right?.” I said, as I simultaneously tried not to cringe at my own words.

It could be that I was taking advantage of her vulnerable state. I felt disgusted with myself and  as I put those thoughts aside, I reassured myself we had to move on. Olivia didn’t say another word after that. Even so, I believe at one point I vaguely heard her say “Thank you.”

Soon after, morning came. And along with the sunset, the man returned as well.

“Morning handsomes, you didn’t get any shut-eye last night huh?” He said after handing us some food.

Both me and Olivia reluctantly looked at each other and nodded.

“Let’s do it. We will help you as much as we can.” I said with a somewhat determined tone.

Perhaps I was still in shock or maybe filled with rage. Probably both, since I also felt a deep regret for what I was about to embark on. But even so, I have nothing left to lose anymore. Literarily nothing besides this erased life of mine. I still have no clue how the hell I came back to life, and when I questioned the man about this afterwards, he couldn’t even understand what I was talking about. Nevertheless I'm not planning on dying again anytime soon.

“Is it just the three of us then?” Olivia asked him.

“Well yeah, pretty much. I’m now certain there’s others out there like us. Surely, we can come across them if we search. We’re gonna need all the help we can get.” The man said, brimming with confidence.

That’s when I had an epiphany if you will. That article I read earlier came to mind. If their influence extends to the internet, then I can use it to my advantage as well.  This is the second reason I chose to post this. If you’ve read this far, honestly thank you so much for dedicating your time of the day.

That being said, I want one simple exercise for you to try out. If you can come back to this post again after a couple of  hours and still remember it like you read it the first time, well congratulations, you’re one of us. What you do with that information is truly up to you. I will consider posting more information regarding what we’ve discovered about them if I can successfully post this to begin with. Until then, long live the resistance. That sounded kinda cool right?
