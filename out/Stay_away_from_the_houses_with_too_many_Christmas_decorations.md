This is the time of year when people really get into the holiday spirit, and want their houses to reflect it. Decorations are usually one of the nicest parts of the season; twinkling lights, glowing “Merry Christmas” messages in red and green and inflatable reindeer. It’s silly, harmless fun.

For me though, seeing the decorations go up only serves as an inescapable reminder of my experience inside that one house. The one I’ve come to call The Festive House.

Sorry for the long post, but this is something I had to get off my chest.

Every neighborhood has that one house that goes way too hard with the decorations, right? Just wall to wall lights, lawn decorations, fog machines, the works. You see videos of them online blasting Jingle Bell Rock at 100 decibels. It’s hard to imagine how anyone could spend so much money, time and effort to make their house a sideshow and annoy their neighbors.

Back when I lived in Southern California, there was a house just like that about two blocks from me, but it wasn’t just during Christmas. It was every holiday.

Every.

Single.

Holiday.

Halloween? Light-up jack-o-lanterns, spooky lights and canned sound effects. Thanksgiving? Plastic turkeys wearing pilgrim hats and oversized cornucopias. Hell, even Flag Day would look like Betsy Ross exploded on the front lawn.

The house itself was a pretty normal looking 1-story affair; a 1960’s-style ranch home with a low roof and cream colored siding ending in whitewashed brick. Nothing about it seemed out of the ordinary. The lawn was manicured, the windows were clean and the leaves were raked. Whoever lived there was clearly house proud.

But here’s the thing: I never, not once, saw whoever lived in that house putting up or taking down any of these decorations. I walked my dog past that house a few times every day, and they just seemed to appear one day, all at once, and disappear the next. The neighbors didn’t seem to know who did it either. No one I asked seemed to have any idea who lived there. It was just assumed that the occupants were very private people, and had simply lived there longer than any of the other neighbors had.

What tipped this situation from just regular weird into deeply unsettling was the fact that any time there were decorations on display, the front door to the house was left open. Not swung wide, mind you, just enough to get a look inside. I know this because each time I’d pass by, I’d try my best to get a peek. However, I could never see past the entrance foyer, which was always completely dark, no matter the time of day. I tried over and over to see what was inside. I just could not help myself. It felt like it was pulling me in, trying to swallow me whole.

Somewhere deep down, I knew there was something wrong about that juxtaposition; the outside of the house lit so brightly and cheerily, while the inside was empty and lifeless. I couldn’t stop thinking about it. I needed to know who lived there, what the inside of the house looked like, anything.

Looking back on it now, it seems ridiculous that I should care about something like that, but at that time, I was like a man possessed. I resisted the urge to investigate for 5 or 6 changes of decoration, but eventually I gave in. I just wanted to see anything past that dark foyer.

Just before Christmas, I decided I couldn’t take it anymore. I had to see what was inside the house.

(I was so obsessed that not for one second did I even consider what the neighbors would think if they saw a random guy in a hoodie walk up to a house off the street, or how many ring cameras might record my stupidity.)

As we all know, winter days are short, and, wanting to take advantage of the few scant hours of daylight, I decided to do my snooping just after noon. As I approached, I noticed for the first time how old the decorations crowding the lawn appeared. The plastic blow-mold Santas had yellowing beards, the hundreds of lightbulbs were the old colored glass kind that screwed into the cord. None of it was modern, not a single LED in sight.

I followed the tangle of power cords as they wound their way up to the front door and into the darkness beyond. I tried telling myself that I was being ridiculous, that the door must have been left open to let these cords pass through. But my hand was already pushing against the door, warm from the afternoon sun. It swung open, and I stepped into the house.

Now, I had only planned on being nosey from the stoop; to get a really good look from the outside of the house and force myself to be satisfied with whatever I could see from there. But here I was, fully trespassing inside a stranger’s house.

I took several steps into the dark foyer, letting the door ease itself shut behind me. There was an odd, not unpleasant musty smell in the air, the kind that gets kicked up right after someone has vacuumed old carpets. I pulled out my phone for the flashlight. Dead. I frantically flicked a nearby light switch back and forth. Nothing. No lights, save from the lawn decorations. Was it a power outage? How could that be when the outside of the house was awash in the glow of electricity?

I waited a moment to let my eyes adjust. I saw a hallway that stretched before me, ending in a dining room. To my right was an open doorway that led into a den. Halfway down the hall, on the left wall was a closed door, perhaps a coat closet. The entire place was unnaturally dark, as though no sunlight from outside could find its way in.

The house sat completely still, and other than a slight ringing sensation in my ears, I couldn’t hear a single sound. No signs of life at all.

Cautiously, I stepped into the den, expecting to, at any moment, be met by a furious mother or father demanding to know what I was doing in their home, but no such person appeared. Instead, I was greeted by a large, re-upholstered couch in the center of the room. Dark wooden cabinets occupied part of the wall, filled with ceramic vases and other small items. In front of the couch sat a small, antique television set, adorned with faux-wood paneling and knobs to change the volume and channel. The whole thing had a very “grandma-chic” feeling to it. The faint, sickly-sweet smell of pipe smoke permeated everything.

The ringing in my ears got louder, and I felt a painful increase in pressure, like when an aircraft takes off.

The wall behind the couch was taken up with one massive, curtained window that peered out onto the lawn, letting in the red, green and gold light from the hundreds of lights outside. The shadows in the room shifted in time with them, and I peered out the window, and understood why the house was so dark.

Set behind the bright lawn was a pitch-black night sky.

I had only been in the house for a minute or two. How could it already be dark? My stomach tied itself in a tight knot as I put my back to the window. My elongated shadow fell across the back of the couch. I watched it wriggle along with the rest of the shadows, and in that instant, I saw them.

Stretching from the couch, across the floor and up over the television were four humanoid silhouettes.

The room was empty, but there they were, shadows cast by nothing, blurring and dancing along with mine in the blinking light of the Christmas bulbs. My breath caught in my throat. I swallowed a scream.

I needed to get out of this place, immediately. I inched my way back around the couch, never taking my eyes off those horrible shapes. They were so dark, they looked almost burned into their surroundings. It felt like I was moving through molasses. I counted five more steps to get out of that room. Then four.

Three.

Two.

I got too excited. I rushed to close the rest of the distance, and swung my knee hard into the corner of the couch. I swore loudly. My eyes immediately flew to the shadows sitting only feet away.

As the decorative lights flicked from red to green, one of the shadows shifted position, blinking from sitting on the couch to standing directly in front of me instantaneously.

For a long moment it just stood there facing me, motionless, except for its blurring, flickering edges.

And then it opened its mouth and began to shriek.

An earsplitting, buzzing, static that ricocheted around inside my head. The lights continued to blink, and as they did, the shadow moved towards me with unnatural, jerky steps. Each time the lights outside shifted, so did the shape, like a horrific zoetrope.

I turned to run, but the pain in my knee flared and I stumbled. As I struggled to move, the shadow descended on me. Its hand flicked out, and in the blink of an eye, locked around my wrist.

Instantly, my arm went dead, save for an overwhelmingly cold, spiky feeling, as though I had covered my bare skin in snow.

I wrenched myself free and raced for the front door. I pulled the doorknob with my other hand. The door didn’t move. It didn’t fight against a lock or bolt, it just felt like I was yanking on a brick wall. Immediately, the entire house shuddered. I heard a deep, gurgling groan come from somewhere deeper in the house.

My blood was pounding in my ears. The shadow stood, and took long, flickering steps down the hallway towards me. It closed in, its hand reaching out for my chest. I abandoned the front door, and ran down the hallway, past the flickering shape, deeper into the house.

I was hyperventilating. I was trapped here, with that thing. Every corner of the room flickered along with the decorations outside.

My ears rang louder. The pressure grew stronger.

I ran through rooms without stopping to see where I was going. Eventually I found myself in the master bedroom, its massive bed dominating the room.

And there, laying on the floral bedspread, were a dozen mummified bodies, piled one on top of the other. Their clothes, a mix of different fashions across decades, hung off of their tiny, shriveled bodies. Their mouths hung slack and open, and their empty sockets stared, terrified, at the ceiling. I squeezed my eyes shut, but I couldn’t get rid of that sight. I imagined how I would look placed on top of that pile of too-curious neighbors. Tears rolled down my face.

A shriek exploded in my head. I turned to see the shadow standing inches from my face, still flickering and buzzing in the ever-present holiday light. Before I could react, its hand flickered against my chest.

It felt like I had been kicked by a horse. My lungs emptied in a choking gasp. I tried to scream, but there was no air left in me. I fell backwards onto the occupied bed. The weightless husks toppled over onto the floor. The shadow stopped shrieking, instead turning to stare at the bodies as they fell. At that moment, I regained enough sanity to try to escape the dead-end room. I forced my lungs to inhale, exhale. Forced my pained legs to move. Forced my body back towards the entrance of the house. My mind was racing, trying to think of a way out, Maybe I could break the den window somehow, or maybe–

Something dark on the floor caught my eye. It was the tangled mass  of power cords for the lawn decorations, winding their way from under the front door, into the hall closet.

I don’t know what possessed me, but with nowhere else to go, I threw open the closet door. It was completely empty, except for a large, wooden hatch in the floor, jammed open by the mass of cords sneaking underneath it. The shrieking had begun again, somewhere nearby. I struggled to pull the hatch open, and saw the top of an old, splintery wooden ladder, descending into the inky black below.

Without hesitation, I flew down the ladder.

Look, I know. The basement is always a trap. Maybe the pain in my ears made it hard to think. Maybe it was the absolute, skin-peeling terror of imagining what would happen if that flickering shadow caught me. Hindsight, as they say, is 20/20.

As soon as my feet hit the cold stone of the basement, the shrieking above me stopped. The feeblest glimmer of holiday lighting made it through the ventilation gaps where the wall met the ceiling, giving the room the smallest amount of light to navigate by.

I followed the thick rope of tangled cords across the room, squeezing through large plastic objects, trying to discern their shapes through the darkness. Turkeys. Pumpkins. Leprechauns and cherubs. Hundreds of them.

Lawn Decorations. A year's worth of holidays, all crammed into one room. All waiting to be displayed outside. All waiting to lure in unsuspecting victims with their cheery painted smiles. To let the shadows drain them and place their husks in the bedroom.

I smacked face-first into the unfinished brick of the opposing wall. Feeling blindly across the stone and mortar, I felt a massive rat-king of plugs and sockets. I closed my hand around one at random, and started to pull.

In response, the room flashed yellow-white as every plastic decoration and coil of bulbs lit up at once. I was blinded by the brightest light I had ever seen. Shielding my eyes, I squinted through it, and saw several dark shapes resolve, scattered amongst the teddy bears and Uncle Sams. Human shadows.

A moment later, the decorations began to blink wildly. The shadows blurred and danced and suddenly were moving towards me, converging at an unbelievable speed.

Without thinking, I grabbed every power cord I could hold in my one working hand, and pulled. I strained hard, with every ounce of energy I had left in me. I pulled and pulled as the shadows flickered towards me in that chaotic, flashing room.

All at once, countless plugs came loose from their sockets. Pop, pop, pop, pop, pop.

The room was plunged in darkness. True darkness. All the decorations, inside and out had been disconnected from the house. I breathed heavily. Several seconds passed. Was it over?

The shadows began to shriek all around me, mere feet away.

I ran.

I didn’t even have the light from the outside decorations to navigate by now. I just fled full speed through that inky blackness, arms out, hoping I was moving in the right direction.

My hand closed around splintery wood. I threw myself up the ladder and out into the hallway. The first shadow, the one who had first attacked me, was still here, I could feel it, watching me through the impenetrable blackness. I closed my eyes, and sprinted down the hallway.

I guessed at the number of paces it would take to reach the front door, and as I approached where I thought it might be, I turned, and put the entire weight of my body into my numb shoulder, bracing for impact, and leapt forward.

Nothing.

I had guessed wrong. There was no door. My body sailed through the air, unobstructed, and landed hard.

I opened my eyes, and was greeted by the afternoon sun. I was laying on the grass, between a dozen grinning elves and reindeer. I glanced back at the open door, revealing the dark hallway just beyond. I was slick with sweat, panting as though I had just finished a marathon. The ringing in my ears and pressure in my head had both vanished.

“What the hell are you doing?”

My eyes snapped to an old man angrily staring at me, his hands gripping the lid of his trash can tightly. His mouth opened to say something else, but faltered when he saw the look of absolute terror on my face. I picked myself, the feeling slowly returning to my body, and mumbled an apology under my breath.

As I walked away, I turned back around just in time to see the decorations flicker back to life, merrily celebrating the Christmas season once more.

I moved away from that neighborhood a month later, but there’s really nowhere you can go in the US without finding at least one of those overly-decorated houses nearby. You have too, I’m sure. Just don’t make the mistake I did. Never go inside one of those Festive Houses.
