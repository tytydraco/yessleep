I’ve always been the kind of person who scrolls through app stores late at night, hunting for something new—something that hasn’t been downloaded a million times already. 

It’s a habit, I guess, born out of boredom and a weird fascination with the obscure. Most of the time, I find nothing but knock-off games or sketchy VPNs. 

But a few weeks ago, I stumbled across something different. Something that, in hindsight, I wish I’d never found.

The app was called *Veil*. No reviews, no screenshots, just a plain black icon with a single word description: “Confess.” 

I figured it was one of those anonymous confession apps—you know, the kind where people spill their darkest secrets for strangers to judge.

 I’ve always found those apps a little creepy but oddly compelling. What can I say? I’m human. 

I downloaded it without a second thought.

The app opened to a simple interface: a text box with a prompt that read, “What’s your secret?” 

Below it, there was a feed of other users’ confessions, each one anonymous and untraceable. 

I scrolled through a few. They were tame at first—cheating on a diet, lying to a friend, that sort of thing. 

But as I kept reading, the confessions grew darker. “I think about hurting people,” one said. “I’ve stolen from my own mother,” another admitted. I felt a chill, but I couldn’t stop reading. 

It was like staring into the void, and the void was staring back.

Eventually, I decided to test the waters. I typed out a harmless secret: “I once stole a candy bar from a gas station when I was 10.” 

I hit submit, and within seconds, my confession appeared at the top of the feed. 

I waited for the usual flood of judgmental comments or supportive platitudes, but nothing happened. The app was eerily silent. 

No likes, no replies, nothing. Just my secret, floating in the digital ether.

That’s when I noticed something odd. At the bottom of the screen, there was a small button labeled “Echo.” I hadn’t seen it before. Curious, I tapped it. A new prompt appeared: “Ask for a secret in return.”

 My heart skipped a beat. This wasn’t like any confession app I’d seen before.

 It was as if the app was encouraging a twisted exchange—a secret for a secret, like some kind of dark pact.

I hesitated, but my curiosity got the better of me. I typed, “Tell me your darkest secret.” 

The app went still for a moment, and then a single confession appeared in the feed: “I know who you are, \[My Real Name\].”

I froze.

 I hadn’t shared my name on the app. 

I hadn’t even logged in with an email or social media account. 

My hands trembled as I stared at the screen. It had to be a coincidence, right?

 Maybe the app pulled data from my phone somehow. But even that didn’t make sense—I’d never given it permission.

Another message appeared: “You shouldn’t have confessed.”

Panic set in. 

I tried to close the app, but my phone wouldn’t respond. 

The screen flickered, and then a new confession popped up: “I’m closer than you think.”

I threw my phone across the room, my heart racing. This had to be some kind of sick joke. Maybe it was a prank app designed to scare people. But deep down, I knew something was wrong. The air in my apartment felt heavier, like the walls were closing in. I glanced at the window, half-expecting to see someone staring back at me, but the street below was empty.

I forced myself to pick up the phone. The app was still open, the screen now filled with more confessions, each one more disturbing than the last. “I’ve watched you sleep,” one read. “I’ve been in your home,” said another. My stomach churned. I tried to delete the app, but it wouldn’t uninstall. Every time I tried, my phone crashed and reopened to the same screen.

Desperate, I turned off my phone and went to bed, convincing myself that it was just a glitch. But sleep didn’t come easy. Every creak of the floorboards, every shadow on the wall, felt like a threat. I told myself I was being paranoid, that it was just an app. But the fear lingered.

The next morning, I woke up to a notification on my phone: “New confession from Veil.” My blood ran cold. I hadn’t even opened the app, but there it was, waiting for me. With shaking hands, I tapped the notification. The confession read: “I’m outside your door.”

I laughed nervously. This was ridiculous. It was just a stupid app trying to mess with me. But I couldn’t ignore the gnawing dread in my gut. I crept to the door and peered through the peephole. The hallway was empty. I sighed in relief, but the feeling didn’t last. As I turned away, I heard a faint scratching sound, like fingernails dragging across wood. It was coming from the other side of the door.

I backed away, my breath caught in my throat. The scratching stopped, replaced by a soft whisper—too quiet to make out the words, but loud enough to know it was there. I wanted to scream, but I couldn’t. I was frozen, paralyzed by fear.

Then, my phone buzzed again. Another confession: “Let me in.”

I don’t know what possessed me, but I ran to the door and flung it open. The hallway was empty. No one was there. I slammed the door shut and locked it, my heart pounding in my chest. This wasn’t real. It couldn’t be real. But the app, the messages, the sounds—it all felt too coordinated, too deliberate.

I needed answers. I grabbed my laptop and searched for “Veil app.” Nothing. No reviews, no download links, no mention of it anywhere. It was like the app didn’t exist outside of my phone. I tried searching for similar experiences, but all I found were the usual tech support forums and conspiracy theories. Nothing that matched what I was going through.

As the day wore on, the confessions kept coming, each one more personal than the last. “I know what you did last summer,” one said, though I hadn’t done anything noteworthy. “I’ve seen the way you look at her,” another read, but there was no “her” in my life. It was as if the app was trying to gaslight me, to make me question my own reality.

By nightfall, I was a wreck. I hadn’t eaten, hadn’t slept, hadn’t left my apartment. I was trapped in a cycle of fear and paranoia, and the app knew it. The confessions had shifted from vague threats to specific details about my life—my childhood fears, my private thoughts, things I’d never told anyone. It was like the app was inside my head, pulling out my deepest insecurities and twisting them into something monstrous.

I decided to fight back. I opened the app and typed, “Who are you?” The response was immediate: “I am you.”

I stared at the screen, confusion mixing with terror. What did that even mean? Was this some kind of psychological experiment? A hacked app designed to break me down? Or was it something worse—something I couldn’t explain?

Another message appeared: “Look behind you.”

I whipped around, but the room was empty. My reflection stared back at me from the darkened window, pale and wide-eyed. I was alone. But the app wasn’t done. “I’m always with you,” it said. “I’ve always been with you.”

A memory surfaced, unbidden. When I was a child, I used to have an imaginary friend—or at least, that’s what my parents called it. I’d talk to someone in my room, someone only I could see. They never had a name, but they were always there, lurking in the shadows, whispering things I couldn’t quite hear. My parents brushed it off as a phase, but I remember the fear. The feeling that something was watching me, waiting for me to let my guard down.

I shook my head, trying to dispel the thought. That was ridiculous. Imaginary friends aren’t real, and neither was this app. It was just a piece of software, a collection of code. But the messages kept coming, each one chipping away at my sanity.

Finally, I couldn’t take it anymore. I grabbed my phone and typed, “What do you want?”

The response was simple: “Confess.”

I didn’t understand. I’d already confessed a harmless secret when I first used the app. What more did it want? But then it hit me—maybe it wasn’t about the candy bar. Maybe it wanted something deeper, something I’d buried so far down that I didn’t even acknowledge it myself.

I thought about the things I’d never told anyone. The mistakes I’d made, the lies I’d told, the people I’d hurt. But one memory stood out, one I’d tried to forget. It was from years ago, when I was in college. I’d been driving home late one night, tired and distracted. I didn’t see the pedestrian until it was too late. I swerved, but I heard the thud. I didn’t stop. I didn’t look back. I told myself it was probably nothing, that they were fine. But deep down, I knew. I’d hit someone, and I’d left them there.

I’d never told anyone. Not my friends, not my family, not even a therapist. It was my darkest secret, the one that kept me awake at night, the one that made me question if I was a good person.

With trembling fingers, I typed it out: “I hit someone with my car and didn’t stop to help.” I hit submit.

For a moment, nothing happened. The app was silent. Then, a single message appeared: “Thank you.”

The screen went black. My phone shut off, and no matter what I did, it wouldn’t turn back on. I sat there, staring at the dead device, my heart pounding in my chest. Was that it? Was it over?

But the silence was worse than the messages. The apartment felt too quiet, too still. I glanced around, half-expecting something to jump out at me, but nothing did. The tension was unbearable.

Then, I heard it—a faint scratching at the door, the same sound I’d heard the night before. My blood ran cold. I wanted to believe it was just my imagination, but I knew better. The app had done something. It had opened a door, and whatever was on the other side was coming for me.

I backed away from the door, my mind racing. I needed to get out, to run, but where? The scratching grew louder, more insistent. I could hear the whisper again, clearer this time: “Let me in.”

I grabbed my keys and made a dash for the back door, but as I reached for the handle, my phone buzzed in my pocket. I froze. Slowly, I pulled it out. The screen was still black, but the notification light was blinking. I pressed the power button, and the screen flickered to life.

There was one last confession on the app: “I’m already inside.”

I looked up, and that’s when I saw it—my reflection in the window. But it wasn’t me. The face was twisted, the eyes hollow, the mouth stretched into a grotesque smile. It was the thing from my childhood, the thing I’d tried to forget. And now, it was here, staring back at me through my own eyes.

I screamed, but no sound came out. The room spun, and I collapsed to the floor, my vision blurring. The last thing I remember is the sound of my own voice, whispering in my ear: “You can’t escape yourself.”

When I woke up, I was in my bed, the morning light streaming through the window. My phone was on the nightstand, fully charged and normal. The app was gone, deleted as if it had never existed. I tried to convince myself it was just a nightmare, a product of stress and lack of sleep. But the memory of that face—my face, but not mine—lingered.

I haven’t told anyone about what happened. I’m not sure I ever will. But sometimes, late at night, I hear the scratching at the door. And I wonder if it’s still out there, waiting for me to confess again. Or worse, if it’s already inside, buried deep within me, waiting for the right moment to surface.

I don’t know what’s real anymore. But I do know one thing: some secrets are better left buried. And some apps should never be downloaded.
