You ever think about bad luck?

I mean the real kind. Not spilling coffee on your shirt or stepping in shit on your way to work. I mean the kind of bad luck that follows a person like their own shadow. The kind that makes you late for every bus you try to catch, but is always right on time for the worst parts of your life. The kind that clings to you, until it eats you alive.

Most people say it all evens out in the end. Little good, little bad, but somehow all balanced. That’s what they tell themselves at least. But deep down, I think everyone’s afraid to admit the truth: maybe luck is not fair. Maybe it picks people.

For some, it’s nothing but clear skies. While others seem to always get chased by rain clouds.

I’ve had my share of rough breaks—My wallet was stolen, my bathroom mirror broke, and my car broke down out of nowhere all last week. And yet I bounced back. Most people do.

But Drew?

Drew didn’t bounce. Drew fell and he kept falling.

Everyone has a friend like Drew. One of those guys who just can’t catch a break even if you handed it to him gift-wrapped. Lost his cat, then his job, then his grandmother, all in the same month. His girlfriend left him the day before prom. His car caught fire during finals week. He missed high school orientation because his bus hit a deer, and the backup driver quit halfway there. Just... unlucky.

He's been like that as long as I can remember.

He lost his Game Boy on a camping trip when we were nine. I remember that after we couldn’t find it, his mother grounded him for being careless. Thing is, he wasn’t careless. He was the most careful kid I knew. That Game Boy just vanished.

Then his bike got stolen outside our middle school. Chain cut clean through. No witness, no record, just a clean theft. Cops never found it. And I still remember Drew standing there, holding the lock the thief left behind. Like whoever took it wanted him to know it was personal.

The thing is… nobody else remembers any of that. Not the bike. Not the Game Boy. Not even Drew.

Just me.

And I might’ve forgotten too, if it weren’t for that damn trunk.

It was the summer we graduated high school when we passed through Marlowe County. We were halfway through a road trip when we decided to stop at a small town just a few miles off Highway 49. It had just one gas station, one diner, and two guys asleep in rocking chairs outside a hardware store. You know the kind, middle of nowhere town untouched by the advance of technology.

There were four of us: me, Drew, and two others—Brandon and Lex. Both friends we’d made in high school. Brandon had the car. Lex had the playlist. And Drew… well, Drew had the worst seat and a headache by hour two. Unlucky as usual.

We weren’t trying to get into mischief. We were just tired, hungry, and maybe a little overconfident after six energy drinks and a gas station burrito that probably voided the warranty on our stomachs. So, when we saw a crooked little sign that said ANTIQUE TREASURES, KNICK KNACKS & ODDITIES, curiosity got the better of us and we pulled over.

The place smelled like mildew and old air. Not in that charming, vintage way like most thrift stores. More like something in there had been rotting for far too long. It was dim, cramped, and cluttered with shelves of rusted tools and forgotten junk.

And in the very back, beneath a faded "50% OFF" sign, sat the trunk.

It was old. There weren’t any decorations on it and it was hardly what some would consider vintage.  It was the kind of old that made you feel like you were looking at something that shouldn’t be touched. Wood blackened around the hinges. Leather straps cracked like dried skin. And to top it all off a rusted over brass lock that was one good knock away from falling off.

Honestly it looked like something you would expect to find in a shipwreck or an attic that nobody goes into anymore.

Brandon joked about cursed treasure while Lex laughed and dared someone to open it. Drew didn’t laugh, he stood still, arms crossed, eyes locked on the thing.

Drew as he grew older seemed to get more cautious. He never expected good things to happen.  Instead, he prepared for the worst-case scenario in every situation, though it was hard to tell if it helped when the bad luck actually hit him. Usually didn’t.

"I don’t like it," he said. "Feels wrong."

Brandon rolled his eyes. "It’s a box. It doesn’t feel anything."

Drew didn’t say anything else.

So, naturally, we bought it.

We tossed it into the trunk of Brandon’s old red sedan and explored the rest of the town until the evening when we drove to the nearest motel to spend the night and loot our "treasure."

The motel did not bother with frills. It had faded bedspreads, a buzzing neon sign, and a middle-aged front desk clerk who looked like he had not cared about anything since the 1990s. We dropped our bags and set the trunk in the middle of our shared room.

"Let’s see what haunted junk we just bought," Lex said, popping the lock with a hammer from Brandon’s trunk. The lid slowly creaked open. Immediately a musty smell hit us—paper, dust, and something sour underneath.

Inside there was only Junk. I could see faded postcards, a broken watch, and some tattered clothes filled with holes. Not surprisingly an utter disappointment.

"Treasure," Brandon said sarcastically. "Maybe we can flip this for ten bucks on eBay?"

As Brandon continued to search the trunk, I watched Drew. He was fidgeting and glancing at the door.

"Relax," I said. "It’s just old stuff. Probably came from some yard sale."

Internally though I sighed in relief. *Thank goodness it was just junk*. Nothing dangerous. I had been worried Drew’s luck would kick in and we would find something worse. Like a body…

"Wait," Brandon said, his eyebrows furrowing. "Guys, the trunk has a false bottom."

He was right. Upon a closer look, you could see that the bottom of the trunk sat higher than it should.

“Don’t just stand there, this has to be something good” Lex said, as she shoved Brandon aside and opened it.

That’s when everything changed.

Inside were layers and layers of toys, photos, and papers, covered by dust.

The first thing Lex lifted out was a battered old blue Game Boy…one that looked strikingly familiar.

Drew perked up. "Wow, I had one just like that when I was nine."

Panic started gnawing at the back of my spine, causing goosebumps to ripple across my skin. I looked at him. The expression on his face was a mix of nostalgia and sadness.

Next came a rusty bicycle bell.

“Drew” I said slowly, “doesn’t this look just like the bell from your stolen bike?”

Drew picked it up, turning it over in his hands, “yeah, that is… weird…”

One by one, more objects emerged.

And it stopped looking like a coincidence.

A faded collar with his cat’s name on it.

An obituary for his father. The article detailing the horrible Hit-and-run was folded and yellowed.

"This can’t be happening." Drew whispered, his face was going pale.

Then items got even more recent and… more intimate.

There was a photo of Drew’s car on fire, taken from a distance.

A crumpled letter of recommendation with Drew’s college of choice written in the corner.

It was like someone had been tracking him. Storing his grief and collecting it to satisfy some sick fantasy.

"This is insane," Brandon said, backing up.

Then Drew’s phone rang.

He answered, his hands shaking while bringing up the phone.

We heard the voice. Calm and casual, completely unaware of our situation.

"Hey, sorry to call so late at night," the antique shop owner said. "But the man who left that trunk came back. Said he donated it on accident and wanted it returned. He even offered to pay you double what you bought it for."

Drew blinked. "We can bring it back tomorrow—"

"No need, he said he was in a rush, so I gave him the motel address. Figured if you guys were still in town he could catch you there. Anyway, He said he’d be there shortly."

*Tap. Tap. Tap.*

As soon as the knocking began the line went dead. The knock itself was soft at first, almost polite.

But it sent a jolt of panic through all of us.

Brandon bolted for the bathroom window, trying to pry it open. Lex ran over to the door, her eyes watering as she fumbled with the chain lock.

“Drew, we gotta go,” I said, grabbing his arm. But Drew was frozen, his eyes locked on the door.

"Why does he have all my stuff?" Drew mumbled, more to himself than to any of us.

*KNOCK. KNOCK. KNOCK.*

The knocking grew louder, more insistent. It wasn’t frantic, just... determined. Whoever was out there knew exactly what they were after.

I yanked Drew toward the window, and Lex got the chain in place. Brandon gave up on the window lock and just smashed the whole thing with the hammer, jumping through after clearing most of the glass. I helped Lex through next.

*BOOM. BOOM. BOOM.*

The door was shaking now. Hinges groaning, barely holding on to the aged wooden frame that looked so old that it would break any second.

"Drew! Come on!" I yelled, shaking him now. “Hurry, we need to get out of here now!”

But Drew remained, eyes transfixed to the bike bell and belongings spread out on the floor. A display of every single act of cruelty he had ever experienced.

"Was it all caused by something?" he whispered.

I ran to the window and leapt through. Cutting my arms on the leftover shards of glass. Drew followed, but much slower. He reached his hand out and we grabbed it, yanking.

His head poked through, then his torso. He was nearly out. No easy task as Drew was at least Lex and my weight combined.

That was when the door imploded inward sending wood chips everywhere.

Time seemed to slow to a stop in that moment.

Just behind Drew, I could make out a man standing in the doorframe. Well, it looked like a man at first.

He was tall and pale. He wore a long, outdated-looking coat and his face was hidden by a wide-brimmed hat and shadows that didn’t move with the room.

To this day I swear not another atom moved, everything else in the world was motionless as he stepped inside, slowly and smoothly. Not hurried at all, like he had all the time in the world.

Drew slowly turned his head to look behind him. And as he laid eyes upon the man, Drew let out a blood curdling scream.

Because the man had begun to change.

Its limbs stretched, cracking at unnatural angles. Its arms grew too long, and its fingers began to start splitting to the knuckles. Twisting and curling and shaping into more limbs and appendages. Its face—if you could call it that—began to slide off, revealing layers beneath: eyeless sockets, twitching tendrils of exposed muscle, and a wide, grinning mouth that hadn’t been there before. His coat split down the middle like skin peeling back, revealing a ribcage and stomach that were… wrong. It pulsed, rhythmically, like it was breathing.

Like it was *hungry*.

Then the thing lunged.

It grabbed Drew and violently ripped him from our grasp. Kickstarting the world back into motion.

We all fell back from the sudden force, and I nearly bit my own tongue as I hit the ground.

I scrambled to my feet and through the broken window caught glimpses as it slammed Drew around. First on the ground, then the walls, then against the side table with a sickening, wet crunch... He didn’t move after that.

It paused. And then it began to eat.

It split, unhinging in places a body should never open, and began devouring Drew inch by inch. The wet sound of flesh being torn and bones crunching filled the room as it ate. It chewed methodically and carefully. Like it had waited years to complete this meal, and it wanted savor every. single. piece.

And when it was done… it looked at us.

It had no eyes, but I could feel it staring into my soul. And an icy piercing fear I will never forget, gripped my heart.

We ran.

Brandon had the keys, and we piled in his car, peeling out of the lot, like bats out of hell. In the rearview mirror, I saw the window—just darkness now, but it felt like I was being watched even as we sped away.

The next morning, we tried to piece together what had happened. We went back to the motel, but the clerk said the room was empty. Apparently, it was being renovated and hadn’t been used in months.

This was beyond weird now and when we looked, we couldn’t find our names in the registry. And there wasn’t any charge reflected in our bank accounts.

We asked people in town, but nobody seemed to remember us. While we were showing them the pictures we had taken the previous day around town, I suddenly noticed I couldn’t find Drew anywhere in them.

Not like there weren’t any photos of him to begin with. But the photos I knew I had taken with him in it, no longer showed him anymore.

Like he was never there. Now the photos were of Lex, Brandon, and I standing closer together than I knew we had been before.

We even tried to talk to the police, but without any proof of Drew’s existence or our stay at the motel, they shrugged us off and told us not to waste police time.

Then it started to affect us too.

Brandon forgot first. Then Lex.

They couldn’t recall Drew’s last name, or what he looked like, or why we’d even stopped at the antique shop.

But I remembered. I remembered everything. And for the next thirty years, I carried that memory like a scar.

The only painful memory of a horror that even I had started to believe was all in my head.

Until yesterday, when I saw that trunk again, sitting in the window of another antique shop in another town. My town.

I did say I had been experiencing some bad luck lately. But I bounce back, right? Most people bounce back… right???

I couldn’t stop my curiosity.

I walked inside. The shop was basically empty. Just a few things here and there, with the owner lazily reading a newspaper in the back.

I asked if the trunk was for sale, and he looked at me with a strange expression on his face.

“Trunk, what trunk?”

I pointed to the one in the window and he shrugged so I went up to it myself.

I lifted the lid. And inside, right on top, was a photograph of a younger me, standing next to Drew, holding that same Game Boy.  But the picture was taken from a distance away.

I rushed home in a panic.

I searched my closet; through boxes and boxes of stuff I had held onto throughout the years, until I found it.

The battered, old, blue, Gameboy.

I took it. I never told him. It was an amazing toy, and I have to admit I was jealous at the time. My parents couldn’t afford a Gameboy, and I was sure Drew’s mom would buy him a new one.

Instead, He got grounded. He cried. And I sat in my room, playing his Game Boy, pretending it was mine all along.

That was the first time something went missing for Drew. Not lost like he thought—**taken**.

And some *thing* must’ve seen that.

Maybe it decided Drew was the kind of person who things should be taken from. Maybe it reveled in his punishment and sadness over his own misfortune.

But Drew’s gone now, the misfortune it was feeding off is gone. It ate the dessert and ruined its meal. Maybe that’s the only thing that kept me safe all these years.

*Tap. Tap. Tap.*

And I think it might be hungry again.
