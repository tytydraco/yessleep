I stopped showing people houses after the fourth time things went wrong. It’s a shame because I actually kind of liked being a realtor. The idea of trying to pitch an essential need to someone over the basis of walk-in closets always came to me as a small joy. I wasn’t the best at my job. Sometimes I’d agree with my client about the neighborhoods being iffy or the foundation being of questionable integrity. I couldn’t help it. I can be a salesperson but I’m not gonna be dishonest.

I guess that’s a trait I picked up from my old man. He was always getting on me about the quality of artisan work and the downsides of a lazy contractor. Who would I be if I let a nice family move into a home that’ll tear through their pockets in a few years when the foundation shifts. I pride myself on finding good people their forever homes. I used to at least.

When I first started out as a realtor I got an in with my buddy down in Austin. We worked for an agency that has long since closed its doors. I really did enjoy it as a start, but my ambitions were set on much older architecture like historical cities along the east coast, or old giants like Chicago or Los Angeles.

…

Incident I

I was a couple years into my field when I got a position in Williamsburg, Virginia. The architecture there is absolutely stunning. I just got done giving a polite older couple a walk-through of this beautiful home with a tower topped with a cupola. It was a little worn by time but otherwise in great condition. It was a very pleasant tour that I thought was going well. Right after the tour I got a call that a family I worked with back in Austin was found dead in their home.

One of the first families I had ever completed a sale with. They were a lovely bunch and I really enjoyed talking them through the finer features of their home.

Apparently the place got put up for foreclosure and they were found rotting in the living room. The cops that found them there, the ones that could stomach it, said they must’ve been there for several months. Their rotting decay melting into the wood and filling in the grain of the neglected flooring. Their bones exposed and digging craters in the once beautiful tiger wood panels. I remember vividly selling the house to them based on that floor in particular. They were mesmerized by that warm shine. The wife said it reminded her of honey in the afternoon sun. It’s almost poetic how they stayed with it.

As I realtor I couldn’t help but cringe for the poor soul that would have to sell that house in the future. That gorgeous amber wood would never be the same.

I didn’t ask too many questions. A grisly end like that could have come from a number of things and I didn’t really have a strong desire to think about any of them in too much detail.

I’d heard stories of unfortunate realtors who had to deal with the haunting pasts of their homes, but it was a rarity I had luckily been able to avoid up to that point. All luck runs out eventually I suppose.

…

Incident II

Not long after that I had a more direct run in with misfortune. I was giving a young entrepreneur and his girlfriend a tour of a few beautiful townhouses in Baltimore. The problem with the younger generation is that they never seem to appreciate good historical architecture. His girlfriend whined about the creaky stairs and a strange shadow cast by the one-of-a-kind stained glass window that overlooked the staircase. The place was honestly too good for them, I could tell they’d just paint over the original wood cabinets in a dingy beige or mint green. It would’ve been a cabinetry homicide.

I was more than relieved when they told me they were interested in some of the newer modern slabs of concrete where craftsmanship goes to die. They never showed up for their scheduled tour though. Evidently, they never showed up anywhere ever again.

The police were sure to ask me plenty of questions about the couple but I didn’t even know the girlfriend’s name. I think I caught an, “Ash,” or perhaps an “Ashlyn?” I told them what I could and wished them the best of luck in finding them. Just glad I didn’t have to fake enthusiasm about a 21st century condo with vinyl floors and resin countertops. It was almost a relief, knowing they wouldn’t desecrate an architect’s livelihood with their desire for understimulating monotony; Eggshell paint and LED lights.

…

Incident III

I criticize the young, but in all fairness I’m not much older than them myself. My privilege comes from my father. He was a very kind man who was adamant on making sure I respected the dying fields of architecture and the idea of quality buildings meant for living, not just shelter in between shifts at a drab 9-to-5. The only time I ever saw that man angry was when my late brother decided to hide the elegant exposed brick in the bedroom of our childhood home with ratty SEGA posters and clippings from playboy magazine. It wasn’t so much the contents of the posters my dad disproved of, more so the fact that my brother drove nails into century old brick and mortar. He said “That’s not just a wall—that’s a century’s worth of craftsmanship ruined by four careless holes.” He didn’t speak to my brother for days. It wasn’t done out of anger, but of quiet disappointment—an exile. I learned from him that some people appreciate and preserve history and some people don’t deserve to own it.

That is in part why I chose to become a realtor. To find people and families who could appreciate and complete beautiful homes for the rest of their lives. It is a shame how few I have managed to find over the years. And how even the few that do, tend to stray from their compasses and debase the precious history they were honored with.

I thought I found a family that would really appreciate the homes I found for them. I was showing off this late 19th century three-story to a very polite couple and their two sons. The dad was a civil engineer, so I hoped that the years of contracted tedium and sky rises and intersections hadn’t destroyed his mind of the grace that can be found in a well-constructed abode. I was in the middle of showing them the expertly hand-crafted porcelain claw-foot tub in the master bathroom when one of the boys started complaining about a smell.

“It smells like dookie.”

I flinched at that. When I was young I never used any sort of childish language. What’s wrong with just saying, ‘It smells bad in here.’

“Old homes such as this can often have an odor of sulfur. It is a result of the water heater being out of use for so long so there is a buildup of sediment and bacteria, you can replace it or run the hot water in the house to clear it out,” I spoke calmly, like a teacher.

I had to resist rolling my eyes. This engineer was neglectful in passing on his knowledge to the younger boy and it was obvious.

The wife spoke up, “It doesn’t really smell like sulfur though, it smells like rotten food.”

I clenched my jaw.

“Rot is common in homes without residents especially older homes like this one, an inspector could verify any sources of rot. I could conduct it myself, I am very experienced.”

I was cut off by the derelict craftsman himself.

“Look, pal, I have smelled sulfur, I have smelled wood rot. This smells like dead animal. You should get your crawlspace checked.”

This man. This impotent of a builder found it in his own interest to judge my word. He saw himself as better than I. With great sadness I do have to admit that I was wrong when I had hoped that this family would be a great addition to the sleek and ageless beauty that was this home. The foyer with its vibrant Assyrian tile was a chapel of silence. The African Blackwood newel posts–that must’ve cost a fortune to import–intricately carved with the ornate flora that filled its length. Light fell through the stained glass like the breath of God. And these… these people tracked in dead air and disbelief.

I spat on the floor and shoved past the man to get some air out in the hall.

“Out,” I muttered, but not to them—to the rot. To the ignorance. To the insult.

“Excuse me?” Snapped the mother.

“Get out. This place isn’t for you,” I had to still my arm to prevent it from shaking as I clenched my fist at my side.

“This ground has known centuries of silence. It has heard better men than you and sheltered their last breaths. Get out before it remembers what it ought to do to defilers of history.”

The kids were scared of me. They clung to their failure of a father like lambs to a false shepard. Poor naive boys. Their father raised them poorly. They will grow to resent art and defile the only true beauty left in this world. He had failed them like my father and I had failed my brother.

I was right to cast them out. To take care of the history I was foolish to invite them to be a part of.

I had to move west after that. They said I needed help. They said their kids were terrified and that I should seek psychiatric treatment. Hypocritical coming from the patrons that sought to gut the soul from the very masterpiece I found myself required to save them from.

It was clear to me by this point that my work was sanctum. These homes needed me for more than finding permanent residents. They needed protecting.

…

Incident IV

Out west I found myself in front of a young couple. I had a distaste immediately. I knew the youth to be more than corrupt by this time. Although I had to prevent myself from thinking too rashly. They had amazing taste in architecture and they were looking for a grand historical home. Shockingly they made their small fortunes as Internet personalities. A line of work where aesthetics mean everything. Their taste for vintage decor and preservation of original furniture and wood drew me to come to their aid.

I took them on a tour of the Manor de Pazo, a small estate that had been desolate for decades. It took great inspiration from Alcázar of Segovia—a beautiful Spanish castle with enticing yellow stonework. The driveway was long and the owner of the estate asked us to politely leave our vehicles outside the front gates. I could respect that, no reason to tarnish perfectly paved stone driveways with rubber and skid.

I will say the walk to the manor up the driveway was excruciating. The two girls chose to vlog the entire walk on their phones and giggle at little insects and the color of the trees lining the driveway.

“Perhaps a more engaging commentary would be of the brass lions in perfect condition despite the wear of time and neglect. I also would note the bricks that line this path were hand shaped and dried in the sun before they were shipped from Spain itself.”

Ignored.

It bothered me a great deal to be spoken over by whelps with an insidious lack of attention span.

That wasn’t quite the moment I lost all hope for them. It was after we entered the manor itself—it goes without saying they ignored the flawless stucco walls and iron detailing that had been shaped out with fine hammers and years of patience. They didn’t even stop to remark at the red tile roofs or the courtyards big enough for kings.

When they finally spoke of the house it was drenched in sacrilege.

“This could probably go…” remarked one of the two. Her face was caked in makeup, like an apartment in between tenants—lathered with white paint to hide the grime of residency.

She was referring to the butlers pantry, an original component of the home that had stood strong much longer than any of us three had even existed. To say that a timeless piece such as that ought to be brought to an untimely end over a complaint of space is monstrous. An open floor plan has no purpose but to expose the fabricated lives of digital peons.

The other of the girls had a split second of promise as she remarked on the beautiful tile that the rest of the kitchen bore.

“That color of blue is fantastic.”

I felt a surge of renewed passion as I placed a hand on her shoulder and led her closer to the tiles above the counter.

“These are called azulejos. These tiles in particular were restored and recovered from an old train station in Portugal,” maybe this one had some saving grace deep down. I desperately hoped that I was right to think that. Maybe with the right influence even those like the sons of the ill-mannered civil engineer can be made to see the light.

“I just wish that they didn’t have that weird hazy look to them,” she continued.

“No, that’s part of the beauty. They are tin-glazed. It’s a method that preserves, protects, and also adds shine. The white haze adds to the depth and culture of the tile and in no way is a negative attribute,” I’d take my time to educate, and hopefully salvage this lost soul. Much like my father tried to do with my brother.

“We could just sand them down and apply like a clear coat to get rid of that,” the painted face one spoke now.

“Yeah that might work.”

I felt it now. The disappointment I can only describe as pathetic sorrow. I truly wished to believe that souls like these could be saved. That the beauty of this very special place could transform even the most disturbed minds. Like my brother driving a nail through brick, these girls had driven a stake through my heart. I felt so much more pain than the previous times I had attempted to salvage the undeserving.

I tried not to let my sadness show as I brought mercy upon the sad product of naivety and desecration that took the form of two young girls. Their scalps nearly tore from their clouded minds as I dragged them kicking and screaming across the kitchen floor. The glaze gave no resistance, only guidance, like the house itself was helping. One of them clawed at the baseboards, leaving crimson crescents in the dust. The other screamed. Not words—just sound, torn from lungs like wallpaper from plaster.

The cellar had no door.

Gravity did the rest.

Their skulls played the steps like teeth on a xylophone—ivory, chipped, and badly out of tune.

One thudded. One cracked.

I waited a breath, then followed. Slow. Reverent. My fingers trailed the stucco wall. Still smooth after all these years. Still sacred. Midway down, my hand met something unexpected—a dull, intricate shape. A wine opener, left hanging on a wrought iron hook. It was heavy. Antique. Honest.

A gift.

When I reached the bottom I found the girls breathing slow shallow breaths at the foot of the stairs. The heretic of open-concept floorplans lay bent and knotted, her neck at an obscene angle, as if trying to see where she had gone wrong. Her face was still. A cracked egg of rouge and concealer. I did not have to kill her. The house had done that for me.

But I did anyway.

I drove the opener into her throat, into that soft column that had once dared to house an offering of defilement. The blood came fast—warm and wine-dark—and spread across the tiles like spilled Chianti. The cellar reeked of iron and something sweeter. Like jam turned sour in the sun.

The second girl whimpered behind me and I turned. I had almost forgotten her in my moment of silent laudation.

She had dragged herself into the far corner, half-propped against an old wine cask. Her eye was swelling shut, her ankle at the wrong angle. She was shaking. She looked at me—not with pleading, not even hate—but with the blank stare of a cracked statue. She raised one hand slowly to shield her face.

“I liked the tiles,” she whispered.

For a moment the house was silent.

“You even liked the tin glaze?” I asked.

She nodded fiercely and stared at me with wide eyes. I felt remorse for a moment. My brother once wore that look.

My brother was a liar.

My hand swept left, blindly, and found a long, thin champagne saber resting on a barrel. I smiled. The house provides.

I approached, quick now. My breath even. My arm sure. The first swing took her in the clavicle with the sound of wet wood splitting. She made a noise—not a scream, but a gasp that fluttered like moth wings.

Another swing. Then another.

It stopped mattering where the blade landed. There was no body, only obstruction. Each strike a correction. Each gush a hymn.

When it was done, I lit a candle.

It stood on the cask, brave and trembling. Wax began to drip down its side, pooling on the iron plate below. The room was warm, quiet. I hadn’t noticed the draft before. The air moved gently now, as though the walls had exhaled. No more cries. No more cheap fabrications.

Only reverence.

They say the mind breaks before the body does. I disagree. My hands have always moved faster than my doubt.

…

I write this from the parlor, surrounded by dark walnut and silence. The girls are still. The wine has dried. The cellar air tastes of old stone and mercy. There is peace here now, in the hollow breath of this house, where no one speaks over the past.

I do not expect thanks. Not from them. Not from the city. Not even from the houses themselves, though I sometimes fancy they give it—a creak of gratitude in the beams, a door that opens without resistance.

…

They will find me, eventually.

Some gardener will complain of the smell.

Some idiot detective will mistake devotion for sickness.

Let them.

The rot comes first as ignorance, then as ambition. I cut it at the root.

This is not madness. This is preservation. I still have work to do.
