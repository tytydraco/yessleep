Look, I know how this is going to sound. To you, my friends and I are just stupid teenagers playing with forces we don't understand, and we got what was coming to us. I'm only writing this down at my therapist's suggestion, not that she believes half of it or would encourage me sharing any of it with total strangers. Before you judge us, I want you to read this story all the way through first. Can you do that for me?

We thought it was just a game. You've heard of Bloody Mary, right? Turn off the lights in your bathroom, chant her name three times while looking in the mirror, and she'll come say hello, or some bullshit like that. Obviously fake, but good fun at parties. Makes it a lot easier to prank someone, too.

My point is, that's all we thought it was - some new take on a viral mirror ghost/monster/urban legend/whatever. It sure as hell sounded like one with a name like "Sadie's Cross."

Let me start from the beginning.

My name's James, but you can call me Jamie - all my friends do. I never really believed in the existence of otherworldly supernatural forces, even when I was a kid. The only reason I got involved with any of this is because of my best friend, Frankie.

Frankie was the one who told us about the game. We'd known each other since we were in diapers and she was always dragging me into her practical jokes and bringing me on wild goose chases, determined to discover a ghost or ghoul of some kind before we went to college. She got her nickname from the time she rickrolled our entire class (before rickrolling was a big thing) with footage from *Young Frankenstein* during what was supposed to be a presentation on the Red Scare. The first semester of college came and went with nothing to show for it. I went to a pretty pricey university out of state thanks to the scholarship I'd managed to earn, but with her family's business teetering on the verge of bankruptcy and her parents barely able to hold onto their house, she stayed behind.

As friendships that are suddenly forced to go long distance often do, ours started to slip. At the start, Frankie texted me at least once a week, no matter what. If she didn't have anything interesting to say, she'd go on a rant about the rising cost of eggs or send me pictures of the kitten she rescued from a dumpster (which she of course named "Boo" because he's white "like a little ghost.") Whenever I opened my phone to see an unread message and felt a pang of guilt for not responding, I brushed it off, telling myself I was too busy to talk and I'd just catch up with her later.

Winter break eventually rolled around and I came face to face with the facts: we hadn't talked in months. I didn't know if she'd welcome me back or if we were still even friends. I mean, this was the longest we'd gone without talking pretty much *ever*. As you can probably guess, it caught me off guard when she tackled me at the airport.

"Hey, loser! Long time no see!" Frankie laughed, a big smile stretching across her face. In her eyes I saw no resentment towards me for leaving, just warm, genuine delight. She looked like the Frankie I'd known for years; same loud punk clothes that made her look extra alt or goth or whatever subculture she was exploring lately, same tooth-gapped grin, and same old wild curls.

Well, except for one small thing.

"Hi- hang on, when did you get those?" I gestured to her bangs, now streaked with an uneven barcode of bright cyan dye.

"You like 'em? I can get you an appointment with Amy too, just let me know when you're free," she teased. I rolled my eyes but couldn't wipe the smile off my face.

"Yeah, sure, whatever. Can we go back to my house? It's freezing in here,‚Äù I hissed through chattering teeth.

Frankie hummed in sympathy, linking arms with me as we walked. "Wanna go to Ma's after we drop off your luggage? I bet you're starving, you're practically skin and bones." She poked me in the ribs good naturedly, making me squirm away from her touch.

"I'm fine, really. Thanks though. Maybe later this week? Just, let me get settled in first."

"Sure, no problem. I'm busy on Thursday but other than that pretty much any time works for me."

We headed towards the exit, stopping only to grab my suitcase from the terminal. Frankie ushered me into her health hazard of a hatchback. She'd gotten the car for her sixteenth birthday, a hand-me-down relic of the 80s from her older brother, and affectionately nicknamed the thing the 'Sloppy Jalopy.'

"Is this thing even safe?" I half joked, already not looking forward to the bumpy ride home.

Frankie gasped in mock offense, clutching invisible pearls to her chest. "I'm sorry, do *you* want to drive her? I can give you the keys."

" 'Her'?" I raised an eyebrow, climbing into the passenger seat nevertheless. Frankie nodded, bobbing her head in a way that made her dark curls shake more than they really needed to. "My trusty girl." She gave the steering wheel a little pat. "She always gets me wherever I need to go."

"Really? In one piece?"

"Oh shut up."

We didn't talk much on the drive back, but only because Frankie insisted on blasting the radio so we could have a sing-a-long marathon the whole time. I'm pretty sure I had her beat when it came to raw talent, but her failed attempt to hit the high note in Mariah Carey's "All I Want For Christmas" sent us both into inconsolable fits of giggles, so we quickly forgot about keeping score. It almost felt like old times again.

God, I'd missed her.

Unfortunately, our happy reunion was cut short. She had to look after her little siblings, so we couldn't hang out properly until the next evening, when she introduced me to the worst game I've ever played.

When I showed up to her house, I was surprised to see another familiar face standing on her doorstep. It was hard to tell at first glance, but the longer I looked, the more I was sure it was Quentin, a former classmate of ours who I was never really close with. If he was here now, that explained why Frankie had mentioned him the other day - apparently he went by Quinn. Felt like "Quentin" was too formal or something. He was tall and lanky, clad in a baggy short sleeved t-shirt with the logo of some obscure band I'd never heard of stretched over a long sleeved shirt. The closest thing he wore to a coat was a vest that had clearly seen a couple rough winters.

The main thing that struck me as odd about his presence, though, was that I didn't recall him and Frankie being all that close with each other. It stung a little to think that she'd replaced me after I left, but it didn't surprise me.

"Oh hey- it's Quinn, right? What's up?"

Quinn, clearly not expecting to run into a former acquaintance, stiffened before turning. It took him a moment to recognize me, but when he did, his eyes widened. They darted back and forth between me and the door for a few moments before he spoke.

"J-Jamie...? Is that you?"

I nodded, trying not to cringe at the awkwardness of the whole situation. "Y-You look... Sorry, I should've known you were coming too, it's j-j-just- I didn't expect- d-doesn't matter," he cut himself off, looking away. I couldn't help but feel a pang of sympathy for him; his stutter had gotten him bullied pretty badly in the past. The poor guy was beet red with effort.

"I h-heard that you were back in town for the holidays. Frankie's real excited to see you, sh-she's got a lot planned," he added.

"Oh yeah?" I asked. "Please tell me it's not another one of those 'urban explorations.' I still can't move my neck right from the last one."

He laughed nervously. "I think sh-she has something else in mind. Said something about-"

"Are you two just gonna stand out here all night?" Frankie interjected. "It's fucking cold, get in here!" She grabbed both of us by an arm, pulling us inside. Frankie had a way of dispelling all the tension in a room just by being there. With her around, I instantly felt more at ease, and I could see Quinn's shoulders relax, too.

It was quieter than usual - no screaming children or songs blaring on the radio. I half expected to wade through several piles of messy clothes just to get to the couch, but the place was cleaner than I'd ever seen it. I asked her about it and she said something about her parents going on vacation and leaving her younger siblings with their aunt, meaning we got the house to ourselves for the next week. Frankie was the one who turned the conversation to the supernatural. I remember she had this sly look on her face before she asked, like the cat that got the cream. Like she knew I wouldn't be able to resist. And she was right.

"You ever heard of Sadie's Cross?"

"Uh. No."

"Oh c'monnnnn, you remember the \~tragic tale\~ of Red-Robed Sadie! You know, the human shish kebab?"

"I think there's p-probably a more respectful way to phrase that."

Now, none of us were- *are*\- particularly religious. Frankie was raised Catholic, but never took much of an interest in the culture, aside from attending church once a week on every Sunday. As for me, I was raised secular, and as far as I knew, Quinn hadn't set foot in a church, temple or mosque in his life. But thanks to history class, we all knew the tragic tale of Sadie. She was a mute girl born here in the 1890s who fled her alcoholic father's abuse, joining a convent in the town over. Her life as a nun was cut tragically short by a cold blooded murderer. She's best remembered for the gruesome way she died: strung up on the cross behind the church's altar, throat slit and tongue removed entirely. The killer was never found.

Pointedly ignoring Quinn's words, Frankie continued. "Anyway, last week I was bored at my day job so I started looking up ghost stories, urban legends, anything to distract me from that corporate hell. And you'll never guess what I found-"

"Was it a weird, totally real list of instructions for summoning the vengeful ghost of Red-Robed Sadie?"

Frankie stuck her tongue out at me. "That's where you're wrong, smartass. According to this legend, Sadie's *spirit*," she said, popping the 't' in a way that made it clear she was scolding me for using the wrong word, "is supposed to be benevolent. As long as you follow the rules, she'll be nice to you, maybe even give you a reward."

"Of course there are rules," I scoffed.

Frankie tossed the stuffed animal she was holding at me in protest, crossing her arms. It bounced off my chest with a squeak.

"Ow! That hurt!"

"Aren't you at least a little bit curious?"

Well I couldn't argue with that. Besides, the odds of it being a legitimate way to reach beyond the veil weren‚Äôt high. What harm could it do to indulge her?

"Alright, fine. Where do we start?"

Frankie, doing a very poor job of masking her delight, launched right into an explanation, leaving no room for any more objections. The ritual itself was simple: there had to be four people, one person to represent the ends of a cross, all of whom *willingly consented to participating*. Each person would pluck a hair from their head and be given a match to burn it with. We had to wait for the flames to flicker out, then - and only then - could we finish the chant. She'd go more in depth later, she told us, when it was time to actually perform the ritual.

She was two steps ahead of us all - she'd already written down the words, giving us each our own copy. I squinted down at her messy handwriting, trying to make sense of countless Latin words I didn't know how to pronounce. The paper looked old and faded, like it had been aged using a mixture of lemon and tea. Honestly, I was kind of impressed. She'd clearly put a lot of effort into the preparations for all this. The last thing I wanted to do was rain on her parade, but a nagging question burned inside of me as she continued.

"Wait, hang on, I thought you said we needed four people? There's only three of us here."

"Oh, did I forget to mention?" A devilish smile stretched across Frankie's face. "I invited Casey too."

As if on cue, the doorbell rang and I could hear Casey's muffled shout: "Who wants pizza!"

All the blood drained from my face at the sound of his voice.

Casey went to school with us, too. One look at him would tell you he's a jock, and I mean a next-to-the-dictionary-definition-of-jock-is-his-picture level jock. The thing you need to understand about Casey is, he's devastatingly attractive. Six foot three with broad shoulders and a jaw sharp enough to cut diamonds, his smile alone could melt the blanket of snow that covered our entire town. He was, and still is, one hundred percent my type.

Yeah. She was surprised too. Found me out in eighth grade and hasn't stopped teasing me about him since.

"Frankie!" I hissed, grabbing her wrist as she went to open the door. "What the hell were you thinking?!"

Frankie's eyes gleamed with mirth. "You never told me not to."

Which is how I wound up sitting toe to toe with my high school crush, pretending to be engrossed in a slice of pizza while my best friend rambled on about the 'optimal conditions' for performing some spooky ritual. We eventually got to talking about the usual stuff - our plans for the holidays, what we wanted to study, our most annoying professors. Casey was apparently majoring in something called sports science. "It's really interesting actually, we get to learn about the whole science behind sprains and concussions and stuff." We got along surprisingly well for a group of teenagers who'd never been under the same roof  before. Not outside of school, at least.

I'll admit I kind of zoned out after a while. I‚Äôm not interested in the riveting ups and downs of med school, sue me. I hardly noticed when the subject changed back to ghosts and ghouls. But then Frankie said something that made me question her sanity:

"Let's go to the supermarket in Deadwood! We can perform the ritual in the restroom, it's perfect."

Quinn choked on his slice of pepperoni and Casey rushed over to thump him on the back.

"I'm sorry, are you out of your goddamn mind? It's an hour drive just to get there."

I genuinely had no idea what the hell she was thinking, and something about her tone made me wary. A funny feeling had taken root in the pit of my stomach when I saw Quinn standing alone on her doorstep, and it had blossomed into full on unease.

Frankie pouted at me. "What! I've seen too many horror movies where the main character is stupid enough to tether a spirit or demon to their home - my mom would *kill* me. Wouldn't it be safer to go somewhere further away? It's not like the rules say we can't. Plus, they have the good ramen mix," she added sheepishly.

As much as I hated to admit it, she did have a point. And it made me feel better to think that if something went wrong, there'd be more people around to help. Once Frankie set her mind to something, she was determined to do it, and this time, she'd set her sights on Sadie's Cross. Even if I grabbed my coat and left, she would just go without me. And part of me felt all fluttery inside at the opportunity she was giving me to get to know Casey better.

To no one's surprise, I caved.

"Ugh. Fine. But you have to promise me we'll be back before 4 A.M. If I'm not, *my* mom will kill me."

We all piled into the Sloppy Jalopy and headed on our way to Deadwood. It was a tighter squeeze than it should've been for a four-seater - Casey tried to fit in the back, but he was too tall. He took the passenger side, leaving Quinn and me squished together in the back row. I think Quinn could tell I was uncomfortable because he didn't try to strike up yet another awkward conversation; a subtle gesture of consideration that I greatly appreciated.

I watched the overcast sky darken from the window as we descended into Deadwood valley. A few flakes of snow fluttered down from the sky, scattered here and there. None of them stuck. Halfway through the drive over, the radio signal cut out and the heater broke, leaving us to sit in the chilled silence. Despite his best efforts to hide it, I could feel Quinn shivering against me. Guess he *had* been cold in that scant getup after all. Against my better judgment I wriggled out of my jacket and offered it to him. It was too big on me anyway, I reasoned.

"Th-Th-Thanks," he managed to stammer out between the clacks of his chattering teeth.

"Don't mention it."

By the time we got to our destination the snow had gone from scattered flakes to a slow but steady stream. There weren't many other cars in the parking lot, probably because most people don't go grocery shopping after dark on icy Tuesdays. A few of the street lamps flickered in the encroaching shadows of dusk. "Deadwood Supermarket" read the lit sign of the building that loomed over us, humming with the effort to stay alight. Maybe it's just wistful thinking - hindsight is 20/20, after all - but looking back on it now, I swear it felt like a warning sign from the universe.

*Don't. Stop. Turn back before it's too late.*

We stepped inside, immediately greeted by a rush of warm air. I breathed a sigh of relief - maybe my nose wasn't going to freeze and break off after all.

Deadwood Supermarket wasn't exactly your run of the mill mom-and-pop grocer - think of a chain store you've been to and picture it in your head. Deadwood Supermarket in its prime was about twice as large and three times as wide as whatever image you've got in your head right now, I guarantee it. Its aisles were long and winding, stocked full but looking almost barren because there were never enough products to fill all the shelves. It prided itself on selling exclusively locally-sourced produce, which was great for the town's economy, as well as the farmers in our own. In more recent years with the boom of big utilitarian grocers, it had struggled to carve out an identity and sense of purpose for itself, which all but condemned it to a slow and steady decline.

To be blunt, the place had fallen into a state of disrepair. The light fixtures built into the ceiling had yellowed and dimmed with time and more than one row of shelves were beginning to rust at the hinges. No one had bothered to give the strips of carpet running from the store's front to its back the deep clean they so desperately needed anytime in the past year. Each time I went, there were fewer and fewer cashiers tending the cash registers, and the place didn't exactly have the pocket money to spring for self-checkout stations.

Most of the night shoppers were pretty much what you'd expect: one or two college kids in pajama pants browsing the soup aisle, a handful of stressed out workers making a pit stop on the way home from their 9 to 5 jobs, and a cashier on duty to look after all of them. I felt her eyes follow us into the restroom - you know the one, marked as unisex, a single sink and toilet inside. She was clearly suspicious of our intentions, but she didn't yell after us or try to kick us out.

The single stall restroom was about as grimy and stale as you'd expect. Pleased it didn't have an automatic light sensor, Frankie hummed to herself as she set about drawing strange symbols in a circle on the floor with her fingers.

"Is that supposed to be blood?" I asked, nodding at the red stuff on her hands.

"Hah, you wish. Wanna taste some?" She waggled her eyebrows, holding the jar out to me in invitation.

"No thanks, I'll pass."

"M-Me too," said Quinn, who looked like he was about to puke.

Casey just chuckled and shook his head, watching the exchange unfold as he leaned against the wall.

When she finished, Frankie clapped her hands together, sending droplets of red flying in every direction. "Aw man, I liked these jeans," she complained, but made no move to turn on the sink. "Anyway! Let's get started, shall we? Take out your papers, please."

One by one, she guided us to a different spot on the crudely-drawn cross: I stood at the head, Casey and Quinn to the side, and Frankie took her place at the long end. Each of us held an unlit match, watching as she struck one against the box. With one last mischievous look thrown my direction, Frankie hit the light switch, submerging us into total darkness save for that single small flame.

As she walked around the circle and lit each of our matches with her own, she began to chant. Her voice was deep and soft with an unfamiliar rasp to it, like she'd already been chanting nonstop for hours on end. We were each supposed to join in the chant when she got to us, and so we did, trying our best to keep up with the pace she set. "Oh Sadie," she began, voice dripping with faux reverence, "please make yourself known to us... Show us the truth of how you died, tell us what lies in store... Make known the bloodline tainted with the farce of the lamb!"

That last part wasn't in the script she gave us.

I don't know why I didn't notice that something felt off sooner. Maybe I was too busy trying not to stumble over my words, or too focused on how ready I was to be done with all the neo-pagan bullshit. When it came time to pluck out a hair and burn it, something searing hot dribbled down from the match onto my hand. I cursed, instinctively dropping it to suck at my thumb, oblivious to the damage I'd done. The red circle at our feet ignited instantaneously, flames burning uncomfortably bright for a moment before they fizzled into ash.

For a split second, I saw Frankie's eyes widen. Her expression contorted into one of either fear or surprise, I wasn't close enough to tell. A gust of wind blew through the once dormant air vent, snuffing our matches out one by one in the same counter-clockwise order they'd been lit. Gasps of shock came from outside the door, followed by the sound of shattered glass.

Alright, this wasn't fun anymore. I'd been thoroughly spooked and from what it sounded like, people who hadn't signed up from this were getting hurt. I stumbled forward until I hit the far wall, hand fumbling for the light switch, pressing it hard to no avail. I yanked open the door and was met with a sight that chilled my blood: the store was plunged into darkness. Panic rose in my throat. Was it a blackout? Had it just hit Deadwood, or would my family be left in the dark with no heating during a blizzard, too?

"What the hell?" Casey mumbled. He must've followed me out. I couldn't see his face in the dark, but I had a pretty good idea of what was going through his head right now - the same questions and concerns that ran through mine?

Someone clapped me on the shoulder from behind and I just about jumped five feet in the air. Judging by the person who spoke next, it was probably Frankie. "Jamie!" She whispered. Gone were the airs of amusement about her, replaced with alarm and a level of urgency I don't think I'd ever heard her use. "I think something went wrong with the ritual. We need to stick together, don't go running off on your own." She leaned forward, catching the light from the windowed sliding doors for a brief moment. I saw her reach instinctively for the cross around her neck, blindly searching for comfort, but she wasn‚Äôt wearing it today.

I rounded on her, jabbing a finger in her face. I didn't care if she could see me clearly or not, I wanted to give her a piece of my mind; tell her to cut the crap and that I'd find an Uber if she wouldn't take me back home right now. But before I got the chance, a large clawed hand closed itself around my throat.
