After my mom died, I was devastated.  It felt like one of those old underground nuclear test-videos in slow-motion, where the ground explodes upwards, then slowly falls back into its old place, before collapsing into a crater.  But I had to be strong, I had to handle family, the funeral, her estate, and everything else.  Once I had a second to breather, I extended my leave at work, packed a bag, hopped in my car and just drove.

I wound up in Texas before deciding it was time to make my way back to Philly.  I planned out the next leg of my trip, figured I'd spend a few nights at a "5-star" hotel in New Orleans, then a few nights in a cabin in the middle of Georgia, before redeyeing it back to the city.

For my journey, I had packed an ounce of OG kush, 10 hits of Sunshine-equivalent acid, and a fuckload of liquor.   Along the way I had been partaking here and there, but when I got to New Orleans, I decided "fuck it" and took 7 hits of the acid, smoked at least a half-ounce of weed, and finished an entire bottle of Jack.  To say I had an "experience" would be an understatement.

In the haze of it all, I'm pretty sure I broke through something I shouldn't have.  I remember being "seen" by something much bigger...not "God"...something different.  I felt it judge me negatively, not just that I wasn't "ready", but that I was "unclean", and I felt immense shame.  I felt like it gave me a cosmic-bitchslap of sorts and sent me back to reality...to lucidity of sorts.

Standing in the hotel room, suddenly feeling like I was back in my own body...in my own head...I felt a presence.  2 of them actually.  There was some...mind, that taunted me...mocked me.  But there was another mind, one that stayed quiet and seethed with rage...hate...for me.  To say I felt I was in danger is an understatement.

In that moment some deep part of me knew what to do...I began to see my own body as a sort of translucent thing...a shell.  Inside were these swirling balls of light at different points from the top of my head down to the base of my spine.  As I breathed in, the began to spin more fiercely, and I felt light building up inside of me.  More and more and more light.  Suddenly a lightning bolt of sorts crashed down upon me through my head to the base of my spine and the light exploded into the room.  I knew it was toxic to those other minds...those beings, and I immediately felt their presence dissipate.

I wish I could say everything was fine after that.  Unfortunately, things got much worse.  A twisting/coiling sensation overtook me...rising up from the base of my spine.  I felt like I was twisting through different worlds...different realities.  I decided then to smoke another joint to calm down...and it helped.  I still felt "unclean" and figured a shower would make sense.  But as I took this shower, I had something telling me I was "purifying" myself, I was washing myself clean of the filth that earned me that cosmic bitchslap.

When I emerged, I felt GOOD.  I felt on top of the world, like I had just grown somehow and was about to enter a new chapter.  After dressing I decided to take a walk.  And of course, since I was an alcoholic and it was 3AM, this meant to the liquor store.   I bought another pint, to get myself to sleep.  As I was walking back to the hotel, this woman noticed me.

She looked at me, that's all...but immediately I could see her entire life.   She was a different kind of addict...harder drugs.  A prostitute.  And a killer.

She began to follow me, at a distance.  I didn't look back for  a long while, but knew she was there...knew she had bad intentions.  I got to the hotel and as I walked through the revolving door, I saw her stop and stare, before choosing another victim.

Once I stepped foot back in the room, chaos resumed.  I kept "freezing".  I would take a step, then it felt like time would stop and I'd be stuck motionless.  Frame by frame, I worked my way to the bed, tore off my clothes, and buried myself under the covers.

As I lay there, I could hear vacuuming in the hallway, then at my door, then in my room.  I felt a presence, demanding that I open my eyes, that I see it.  I could tell it wasn't exactly benevolent...though it wasn't quite malicious...and I knew deep down that if I obliged, it would take me over and wear my skin like a mask.  The vacuum was suddenly over my bed, over my sheets and blankets, and the pull to open my eyes was near irresistible, though I tried my best.  At one point, my lids barely opened, before I forced them shut again...but it was enough for him to get in.

I awoke the next day in the same room.  Things were different though.  I had a message from my ex, Kate.  She sounded friendly and apologized for not meeting me in New Orleans.  We had no such plans...we hadn't been friendly in a while even.  Nevermind though, I packed my things and left NOLA for Elijay, GA.

Once at the cabin, the TV simply didn't work.  Fine.  I wasn't here for TV anyway.  I spent a day recharging, but everything still felt off.   I began to hear a sort of voice in my head...asking me permission to take over...making promises about how it would help me and do no harm and so on.  But I refused.  The day I packed up to leave, the TV that had only shown static suddenly burst to life, showing local news.

As I was driving back to Philly, I got a call from Tim...an old friend I hadn't talked to in a year or two.   Odd, but I agreed to get together after  I got home.  The rest of the ride was uneventful, aside from this voice pestering me for control.

Once I was settled at home and back to work, I noticed some other strangeness began to occur.  Every red light I'd approach would suddenly turn green.  If I tried doing drive-thru, static would overtake the ordering systems.  Lights would flicker around me.  Generally strange happenings, and it got old fast.

My job had me visit many different sites across the city.  One of those is a sort of retirement home/convent for old nuns.   Before I go in, I'm sitting in my car demanding this thing leave me...threatening that, if it doesn't, I'll arrange to have an exorcism done.

The entryway I use involves a door with an electronic lock.  I usually hit the doorbell, explain who I am over the intercom to the receptionist, and she buzzes me in.  The door usually opens without issue, nice and smoothly.  Today was different.  I hit the bell, explain who I am, and hear the familiar buzz and click as the locks disengage...but when I pull on the door, it won't move.  I talk to the receptionist and she keeps trying to buzz me in.  She even comes up and is trying to push the door open from the other side as I pull...but no luck.  A few minutes of this go by before the door suddenly pops open like nothing had happened.  Behind the door I see the receptionist, and a very old nun who stares at me like I am the devil.  I smile at the nun, who watches me like a hawk as I walk over to reception to sign in.  I ask the receptionist if anything like this has ever happened and she confirms it has not.  I ask her how they got the door open...and apparently it popped open the second the nun touched it.

There's more...I'll post another time if anyone wants to hear.
