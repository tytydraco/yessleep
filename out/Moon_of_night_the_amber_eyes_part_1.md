Late one night, I sat in my house. It was cold outside, with no stars visible in the city of Angels, aka La Gangeles, where dreams and nightmares come true. Right now, in my apartment, there was wine in hand. The dry taste was delightful, like someone had mixed honey and rose into this sweet toxic pleasure, beating through my body, giving kisses to the soul while caressing the skin. A lovely gown adorned my body, soon to come off when sleep beckoned. However, a persistent feeling of being watched lingered. The windows were closed, and everything was secure. Luckily, there was some comfort with the pitbull around. She was the sweetest thing, but if threatened, she would attack as if they were her favorite snack. A rub on the cute dog's head and a soft command, "Maria, go to bed," sent her off to her chair in the house.

Rising from the couch, the bathroom became the destination. The mirror reflected a 21-year-old with a baby face, which was often said to come in handy with age. Beautiful chocolate milk bar-colored skin, super coarse and curly hair, and dark brown eyes that were sometimes mistaken for black stared back. Full, plump lips completed the face. A glance at the phone brought a sigh. Despite having a great job in sales, there was a yearning for the carefree times. Maybe a trip to the gun range tomorrow would cheer things up. Average height for an American woman, the glasses came off, and a jump of surprise occurred at the thought of someone being in the house. Doing what any gun-carrying single woman alone would do, the gun safe was opened, the firearm was retrieved, and the house was checked. Always keeping the safety on, just in case something was missed.

Suddenly, sleepiness washed over, akin to eating a whole Thanksgiving meal and playing games with little cousins. Clothes were removed, and sleep came quickly. After a few hours, pressure on the bed was felt, strange since the dog wasn't allowed on it. Attempting to move to kick her out was futile. Eyes stayed closed despite the effort to open them. Fear set in, with the heart racing, searching for a way out like a mouse in a maze. Every hair on the body stood up. Then, suddenly, movement on the bed took over the cover. Something cold was felt on the body. Yelling for help was impossible. The coldness stopped at the breast, which seemed to be a hand squeezing them. "Well, aren't you a beauty. You would make a perfect doll for my collection. I put a bit of a spell on you to ensure you don't make a sound. Witches, you gotta love them, right?" The voice was feminine, not too low, not too high, with a southern tone.

The woman continued speaking. "Open your eyes, little girl. I'm going to make you pretty forever. I even have this video camera to record it all." Suddenly, a bite on the neck caused bleeding and pain. The pain was bearable, like a bunch of bee stings. She forced some blood down my throat, and I fainted. The next thing remembered was waking up to someone screaming. Naked, covered in blood, a man with amber eyes stared and said, "Well, you're not on my list."

The man looked at me like prey. He had a predator vibe, long and wavy dirty blonde hair, and pale skin. A glance around the room revealed a thirst that needed quenching. The blonde man smiled and waved. "Hello, new blood. If you stare at me, I might think you've fallen for me." Snapping out of the daze, realization hit. Jumping out of bed, the living room became the destination. A scream erupted at the sight of Maria, dead on the floor. Tears flowed, and the floor was hit in despair. The dog was like a child, the only companion after moving out. The woman had used her parts to make a welcome sign, a sick joke. Killing her would have been the intent, but she was already dead, thanks to that man.

The man who saved me entered and saw the tears. "No...Maria...my dear dog, you didn't deserve this..." The tears turned into rage. When he came to touch my arm, a punch in a fit of rage was attempted, almost catching him by surprise. He grabbed the wrist and put it behind my back. His body was close, breath on my neck, whispering in a low, demanding tone, "Calm down, new blood. You're not on my list, and I don't like killing those who aren't on my list." Thrashing around led to a head-butt, and a cracking sound was heard. Thrown across the room, the mystery man was seen with a cracked nose. Laughter erupted at the sight. Suddenly, a deep pain in the stomach was felt. "God damn it, why am I so thirsty...ow..." The man, whose nose was now healed, dug into his pale grey coat pocket and pulled out a flask. Moving quickly, he was near. He opened the bottle and said in a friendly tone, "Drink, you'll need your strength." The flask smelled so pleasant that it was quickly taken and drunk immediately, like a last meal on earth. A meal that tasted heavenly, like fresh honeydew topped off with honey.

After drinking the mystery liquid, there was relief. "You can call me Mr. Rain. You seem to have some red on your breast." The red stuff was licked off the chest. Mr. Rain was smiling, breathing slowly. A primal urge took over. The tongue moved slower, making sure every drop of red was gone, like putting on a naughty show. When Mr. Rain looked into my eyes, all that was seen was the lust of a primal beast, waiting to strike. His eyes glowed in the dark, making the mood feel much hotter, like we could let the beasts out at any moment. Then he shook his head, snapping out of the dazzle, making me stop the show. He laughed like a child with a new toy. "Damn, you are one vixen, lady. You're the most seductive one out of the Godiva bloodline or clan I've met."

Confusion set in. 'What is a Godiva? That sounds like chocolate... Wait, what did I just drink? Hold on, was that lady a monster?'

Mr. Rain cleared his throat and stood back, holding out his hand. "Well, since I'm done for the night, I can help you, Lady Young Blood, and answer as many questions as I can. Though, you might want to put on clothes, or would you like to sit there and be naked when you get judged by the Godiva family?"

Using his hand to get up, a miscalculation almost caused a fall. Mr. Rain caught me, holding tightly. He felt cold and smelled like roses and a graveyard. The intoxicating smell felt like being in a graveyard full of roses grown by the dead, with Mr. Rain as the grim reaper, waiting to take my soul. His hands traveled up, helping as I descended.

Quickly getting up and pushing him off, a calm tone was used despite the shaken state from seeing the dog's body. "My name is Nightingale, not Lady New Blood. Thank you for saving me... I guess. I don't know... I'm going to take a shower." Walking to the shower felt like the world had ended. It seemed like through this whole experience, death had occurred, and nothing was left in this world. It felt like something had left my body, and I could never feel the same.

The mirror reflected a paler version of myself, even though being a black female. The hair still looked the same, in a nice afro, but something sharp was felt in my teeth. A scream broke the mirror with a high-pitched sound. Getting up, the beast in the mirror was me, but at the same time, it wasn't. Falling to the ground, searching for an answer.

Mr. Rain entered faster than the speed of light. Pointing at the mirror and then at my teeth, "WHAT THE HELL AM I?!" Mr. Rain sighed and got on my level. Crawling over while panicking about the new teeth, he smiled a devilish smile. When close enough, a kiss was given, with a lot of tongue. He was a nice kisser and grabbed my butt.

Grabbing Mr. Rain’s hair revealed its wetness. It was guessed he was called Mr. Rain as a nickname. Looking into his eyes, the same lustful look as before was seen. There was a desire for him to take control, and it seemed he wanted the same. The kiss was needed in that moment, filling a void.

When the kiss finished, his tongue moved down my neck, making love to it and biting. The sharp sensation turned me on even more. The bite felt like fire. Suddenly, a phone rang from Mr. Rain’s pocket, snapping us out of the sexual haze. He took the phone and licked my neck one last time. “Nighty, go take a shower for me while I take this call.” The shower was turned on too hot, not realize the temperature until felt.

Feeling no need to finish what was left inside, it was time to get ready before being late to wherever Mr. Rain was taking me. Not being on the list was crucial; it seemed to get people killed. Coming out of the shower with a towel wrapped around, Mr. Rain was picking out some clothes and ran over when I picked out underwear. Grabbing them out of his hand.

He held up his hand, smiling innocently. “Now, come on. We need to go already, so I was helping you get ready.” Throwing the towel in
