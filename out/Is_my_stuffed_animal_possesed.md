A week or so ago I really started to get into creepypasta's, so I told my bestie  
about it. And she turned out to like it too so we started listening to some realy  
creepy stories about skinwalkers and that kind of stuff... We would sometimes share stories with each other but it was getting late so I really  
had to go study so I asked her to study together since we're in the same grade. I  
started a zoom call and we begin to 'study', Of course it ended up with neither of  
us to study but we had fun together so I didn't realy care about it. What I do care about is the stuffed dog behind me... It was the large Pluto i bought in Disneyland. I thought it was moving, like its paw slid a little to the left.  
We already where scared so I dicided not to think anything about it and tell her later. But right after I shook off the weird feeling of being watched, she told me that the stuffed dog behind me was moving. And she wasn't wrong... Oh my God, she really wasn't wrong... It also whispered something in the voice of a little girl, i couldn't hear what it said but now I think about it I think it was singing.I ran down the stairs and asked my mother if this house had any weird things going on in the past.  
That's when my mother told me the worst thing ever:The family Rogear, living in our house  
before us had all died in this house. The dad from the family, Charles, had killed mother Jenns and daughter Olivia. Soon after he commited suicide in the addic of the house. The police found the bodies after the neighbors complained about a strange smell. The little girls favourite things to play with were the toys they bought at disneyland.I immediately ran back up stairs to tell my bestie but ofcourse my dumb eyes catch the stuffed animal, I took it and trew it in the trash only to find it back on my desk with a note:  
"We are not throwing this out, it was expensive, xxx mom"  
Great i thought, I cant tell my parents anything about this or they will think I'm crazy. I came up with an amazing idea, I was going to use my Ouija board to make contact with the family Rogear and see if Olivia is ready to leave my plushy.

Okay everything is ready, I set up my Ouija board and asked if anyone would like to talk with me, the glass almost floughed to "yes" almost giving me a heart attack. Turned out they were ready to leave so everything was great, so I thought... My mother called me for dinner so I went to eat.When I was done and came in to my room, there was a shadowy figure of a little girl, she asked my to play a game. I said let me think about it. She gave me 30 minutes to think threre has gone 31 minutes past since and I'm hiding in my closet...

If this is the end prepare for the worst...
