To whomever might end up reading this,

My name is Josh Peters. I’m 17 years old, and no one believes what I’ve been telling them. I’m afraid they never will. If my own mother won’t believe me, I fear no one will. After they find out what’s happened, they’ll think I’m crazy—and who can really blame them?

This may be a futile attempt to plead my truth, but I need someone to know what really happened. A part of me knows many of you will say I’m lying, and, to be honest, I don’t blame you. Like I said, I know this is going to sound insane, but if this story can prevent anyone else from dying or making the same mistake I did, then let them think I’m crazy. So here it is. The truth. Whether you choose to believe me or not is entirely up to you. All I ask is that you listen.

Unknown Sender

I guess the best place to start is back when my friend Billy told me about a stupid post he had found online the day before.

We were sitting down for lunch in the school cafeteria, talking about the latest video game release and its ridiculously hard-to-beat final boss when, somehow, the idea of monsters came up.

Billy: “You think the monsters in Death Invaders are scary? Well, wait until you hear about what I came across last night.”

Billy was often unfiltered and didn’t exactly know when to stop talking, for his own sake. At first glance, you might wonder how a guy like me—your average Joe—could find anything appealing in a friendship with someone like Billy. But besides our shared love of video games and the usual teenage boy interests, Billy was a good guy. We both had other things in common, like being raised by single mothers.

Our friendship was mutually beneficial, to say the least. I was more of a hermit, preferring to be alone, and I tended to avoid attention. Billy, on the other hand, often drew too much attention to himself, making him an easy target for school bullies and jocks.

His red hair and freckled skin made him stand out, and because of his eccentric personality, he didn’t really have any friends besides me. In exchange for having someone to ramble on with about video games and the latest horror movies, I had a human shield who kept any unwanted attention off me. Most of the other kids avoided us—just the way I liked it.

Billy got to avoid loneliness, and I got to avoid attention from others. It was a win-win.

And before you call me selfish, it wasn’t like I was just using the guy. Well, maybe at first… but over time, I grew to like him. Sure, he was odd and could be annoying, but he was trustworthy and had a good heart. Beneath all his antics, he was just another kid whose father had left him, just like me. We both carried the same burden, raised by single mothers.

Billy: “Well? Aren’t you going to ask what I found?”

Billy leaned in toward me with a devilish grin stretched across his face. Hunched over the lunch table, as if trying to contain his excitement, he raised his eyebrows, urging me to share in his discovery.

“Go on then… spit it out. What did Detective Billy stumble upon this time?” I said with an eye roll, leaning back in my chair. My sarcasm went right over Billy’s head.

Billy: “Okay, check this out.”

Billy began telling me what happened the night before, and despite myself, I listened. His enthusiasm was contagious. What Billy had found definitely piqued my interest.

Billy had been surfing the web late at night, long past his curfew, when he stumbled upon an odd post in one of those weird cult-following forums about cryptic monsters and other mumbo-jumbo made to amuse the gullible. Billy often visited forums like this on his family’s computer when his parents were asleep.

Talking about scary movies and debunked folklore, like “Bloody Mary,” was a favorite pastime of ours. Billy loved to one-up me by finding the weirdest and creepiest things online.

Unlike other posts on the forum, which had only a few likes and comments, this one contained the following from a new and recently created account:
**“To seek a friend, just beckon—and bring me one sweet sacrifice.
A life warm with blood, one offering will suffice.
A life warm with breath and blood to help guide me in.
Beyond your walls, I wander and wait for one to open the gate…
Outside I linger, near but unseen, bound to roam for eternity until you beckon me.
Your friend,
Vagus”**

Billy: “And that was it. Nothing else. I poked around, and no one knew where the post came from.”

Me: “Well, couldn’t you just look at the account that posted it?”

Billy’s grin grew wider. “That’s exactly it! I did! And guess what? When I clicked on the account, it just took me to a page saying the information had been redacted, like someone had wiped everything.”

I smirked, now humored by Billy’s misguided excitement.

Me: “Well, don’t you think someone just posted some random bullshit and then deleted their account after realizing their cryptic poem was lame and no one was going to respond?”

Billy: “If that were the case, why delete the account so quickly? I asked around, and no one knew what ‘Vagus’ meant.”

Me: “His name,” I replied, raising my eyebrows in mock seriousness.

Billy, oblivious to my sarcasm, said, “Exactly! But what does it mean?”

Me: “Why does it matter?”

Billy shrugged. “It might not, but I’m gonna find out. And who knows? Maybe it’s really real!”

The school bell rang, signaling the start of 3rd period. Billy stood up.

Billy: “See you tomorrow after 1st?”

Me: “Sure thing.”

We went our separate ways, and I tossed my styrofoam tray into the trash.

I didn’t think much of Billy’s discovery. It was just a post—someone trying to be clever and then chickening out. But the idea of it being real… Well, that was both exciting and terrifying. I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t intrigued.

At the time, though, I didn’t fully grasp the gravity of what Billy had stumbled upon. I don’t think Billy did either…

Late

The next day had come, and I hadn’t heard anything from Billy since we spoke in the cafeteria during lunch. I remember letting my alarm go off more times than I’d like to admit, and by the time I finally dragged myself out of bed, it was half past 9 AM. I was late.

I sprang up, rushed to my closet, and grabbed whatever I could find from my dirty laundry hamper, which I hadn’t cleaned in longer than I cared to admit. Barely presentable, I got dressed and hurried downstairs toward the front door.

But before I could leave, I was stopped by a voice from behind me, one I could barely recognize.

“J… Jos… Joshy.”

It was my mother’s voice. Unlike the cheerful tone I was used to, this time it was the opposite—raspy, soft, like she had been crying all night. Hearing her like that hit me with a memory, sharp and painful.

The last time I’d heard that voice was the night my father died. I must have been around 8. My mother had received a call from my grandmother while we were waiting in line at the airport. We were supposed to be visiting distant family in California. Dad was going to meet us there after finishing a big meeting with a client. I remember it clearly because he’d taken us for ice cream just days before to celebrate closing a deal. And then, in that same broken voice, she had cried, standing in line for baggage check.

“What do you mean? Nn… no… that can’t be right… No! Oh my God!” 
Still standing in line, I stood there next to her bug eyed, looking up at her as she held my hand. In her other hand, she held the phone up to her ear. Tears flooded down her face and I watched as an unfamiliar look swept across her face; it was a look of pain. Right then and there was the first out of three moments I would see my mother with that same expression. It was one of disbelief, grief, and despair all rolled up into one display of emotion. But most of all…it was one of pain. With my mother still holding her phone up to her ear, she continued,  “Kevin, no…” 
She was no longer gripping my hand tightly. She was covering her mouth as if to stop the words from being spoken. 

“He’s dead?”

The memory shattered as my mother’s voice pulled me back to the present.

“Joshy… come here, baby…”

Still standing at the front door, I turned my head slowly, hesitant to face her, afraid to see her in that state again.

She was sitting on the couch, tears streaming down her face, her makeup smeared. She clutched the house phone in her hand before setting it down on the table in front of her.

She slid to the side of the couch, making room for me. “Come sit next to me, sweetheart,” she said, her attempt at sounding uplifting falling flat.

Me: “What’s going on? What’s wrong?”

Her weak smile quickly faded. She patted the seat beside her again.

“Honey, something bad has happened… I… I need you to come talk to me.”

I hesitated, but eventually made my way over and sat down beside her. She gripped my hand tightly, staring at me like she was searching for the right words. The silence in the room felt suffocating, stretching out for what seemed like forever.

Finally, she spoke. Her voice, thick with tears, broke the heavy quiet.

“Honey… Billy killed himself last night. I’m so so sorry, baby.”

A Fresh Start

About three years after my father died, my mother and I moved to a town far from the city we’d once called home. Living in the same house where my parents had built their lives together had become too heavy for my mom to bear. Despite both my dad’s parents and her own pleading with her to stay, she needed a fresh start. The wreckage left by my father’s passing was too much for her to piece together alone. I remember nights when the muffled sounds of my mother’s escapades—drinking too much, crying hysterically behind closed doors—became my lullabies. I have only vague memories of strangers—often her drinking buddies, sometimes distant relatives I barely knew—who’d come to comfort me in a sad attempt to distract me from the cold reality unfolding just beyond that door.

When we first pulled up in front of our “new house,” I remember my mom telling me, “Sometimes all you need is a fresh start and a new, shiny pair of keys.” She looked at me with an optimistic smile, tilting her head as she held out the keys to our new home, dangling them in her hand like they were a lifeline.

It was a small house with chipped white paint and dirt streaking the outer walls. The place looked old, worn down, like it had seen better days. Through the main entrance was a kitchen, and just beyond it was a small, open space that I figured was meant to be our living room. To the right of the front door was a narrow staircase leading upstairs to a hallway connecting the master bedroom and a smaller room that would soon be mine.

The house had definitely seen better days, but it was a house nonetheless. It had a backyard and a driveway where I imagined playing until dusk. Out front stood a tree so tall it reached far past my bedroom window. A thick tire was tied to one of the sturdier branches, just like the ones I’d seen on the big trucks on TV when Mom let me watch after homework. Even with the swing, it was nothing like the three-bedroom home we’d had back in the city. But it would have to do. My mom had only started smiling again after receiving a job offer from a small firm outside the city. Deep down, I knew she needed this—to escape our old house, our old life. Even though I was young, I knew better than to let my misgivings show. All I knew was that this fresh start made my mother happy. And if she was smiling again, I could, too. 

Billy and Sophie

It wasn’t long after moving that I met Sophie and Billy. It was the first day of 6th grade, and I remember standing outside the walkway leading up to the school building.

“Charlatan Middle School” stretched across the red-brick facade in large, metallic yellow letters that looked almost menacing.

Saying I was “a little nervous” would’ve been an understatement—I was terrified. Unlike my old school, here I knew absolutely no one. I’d spent the rest of the summer unpacking, reading random books, and swinging alone in the front yard. My mom had encouraged me to go to the nearby park, but the thought of meeting new people—especially after my father’s death—filled me with dread. So I never went. And now, standing there, I couldn’t help but wish I’d at least made one friend that summer.

“Dude, you look like you’ve seen a ghost.”

Snapped out of my thoughts, I quickly turned to my right. Standing beside me was a scrawny, freckled boy about my age. Curly hair hung to his brows, and he stared at me through thick glasses that made his eyes look bigger than they probably were. With a big smile full of braces and rubber bands, he said, “My name’s Billy. What’s yours?”

Billy and I grew close that first year in middle school. Before I showed up, Billy had always been an easy target. But with me around, all the attention on him seemed to wane, and the days of getting pantsed in front of everyone during recess or having his head dunked in the toilet became distant memories. Billy considered himself lucky. Once, he even said, “Josh, if you weren’t here, I don’t know how I’d ever cope with this stupid place.” We were sitting on the benches, watching the other kids play on the playground. I looked over, and he was staring down thoughtfully at one of his prized monster cards, a slight smile creeping onto his face.

Me: “You’d probably still be picking your underwear out of your butt from one of Gilligan’s ass wedgies from hell!”

We both laughed. Gilligan was in the same grade as us—a big, mean kid who loved to pick on others, trying to impress the older boys. If you’d asked me back then, I would’ve said he had shit for brains, probably from all the rotisserie chicken he’d been breastfed as a kid. Both Billy and I hated Gilligan, though Billy had it worse. The fat turd had been tormenting him since elementary school, seeing him as easy prey. And Billy’s need for attention from everyone didn’t help, either.

Luckily for Billy, Gilligan, for some reason, had lost interest in him after I came around. Now, the fat lard had found a new target: one of the new girls, Sophie. She joined our class in the middle of the year. Apparently, she was an “army brat.” Her dad served, so she was constantly moving from town to town, always saying goodbye, never getting a chance to make friends. I felt sorry for her. I knew too well what it felt like to be uprooted, forced to start over somewhere new.

Because of Gilligan’s constant pranks aimed at embarrassing her—like the time he smeared peanut butter on her seat and laughed when she sat down—Sophie tended to keep to herself, both in class and out. Sometimes, I couldn’t help but think this must have been what life was like for Billy before I showed up.

One day, Billy and I were sitting at our usual spot during recess when he caught me watching Sophie sitting off to the side of the yard by herself.

Billy: “Oooooooohhhh, Joshy likes the new girl!”

I quickly looked away, feeling my cheeks flush. “Cut it out! No, I don’t! I just… I just feel bad for her, that’s all…”

Billy nudged my side with a grin. “Yeah… me too. Maybe we should go say hi.”

The idea of talking to her made my palms tingle with nerves. I was never good with girls, and just thinking about it made my stomach twist.

“There’s no way—”

Before I could even finish, Billy darted up and started making his way across the school yard.

Following behind Billy, I sheepishly made my way over to the far corner of the schoolyard, where Sophie sat alone with her back against the fence. Her dark brown hair was tied up in pigtails with pink bands, and her golden-brown eyes were fixed on her shoes. She had a gold and pink Beret with a small silver butterfly on it tucked into the side of her hair. At the time, I couldn’t help but think how pretty she looked. Looking 
back, I now know Sophie was my first childhood crush. My little 6th grade mind was just too ignorant to realize it at the time…

“What do you two want?” she asked, her voice edged with defiance and sadness.

She wiped her eyes and nose on the cuff of her velvet long-sleeve shirt, looking up at us with a mixture of disgust and sadness sinking deep into her gaze.

“You come to laugh at me like everyone else? If that’s why you’re here, just leave. It was Gilligan’s stupid prank, and I don’t care if you believe me.”

Sophie buried her face back into her arms, her quiet sobs muffled beneath her sleeves. Without missing a beat, Billy sat down beside her. Reaching into his pocket, he pulled out one of his prized monster cards and held it toward her.

“We didn’t come to laugh at you, Sophie… We just thought you might like monster stuff like Josh and me. We’ve been collecting monster cards since the start of school. Wanna see?”

Billy’s grin must have been infectious because, slowly, Sophie lifted her head, her expression softening from contempt to curiosity. “M…monster cards?” she repeated, as if testing the words.

“Yeah,” Billy said, his face earnest. “Monster cards.”

We all laughed, the tension melting away. That was the beginning of our friendship.

Friends

That year, the three of us became inseparable. During lunch, we traded ghost stories, argued over which games were best, or shared news of a new monster card one of us had scored. Sometimes, one of us would describe a horror movie we’d snuck in the night before.

At first, Sophie didn’t have much to add. I don’t think it bothered her, though—she was just glad to finally have people to talk to. Eventually, though, Billy and I’s interest in the dark and mysterious rubbed off on her. She started watching more horror movies and even shared some creepy stories of her own.

Most days after school, we could be found at either my place or Sophie’s, playing video games or daring each other to try silly things like “Bloody Mary.” None of our dares ever amounted to much, but the thrill of it all made each one feel like a small victory.

We preferred Sophie’s house. With her dad stationed at a nearby fort and her mom working from home, her place just felt warm, like home should feel. Sophie’s mom was super nice to Billy and me, always making sure we had the best snacks. Looking back, I think she was just happy her daughter was finally fitting in.

Billy’s place, on the other hand, was different. His mom had a new boyfriend every few weeks, and he rarely spoke about his home life. We all knew she didn’t pay him much attention; in fact, it was clear to me as we got older that Billy’s need for attention came from always feeling overlooked at home.

But it wasn’t all perfect for any of us. Even though Sophie’s dad was usually away, when he did come home, things weren’t always safe for her. Sometimes, she’d show up to school with bruises on her arms or behind her ears, concealed beneath the long sleeves she always wore. I used to think her mom made her dress conservatively, but over time, we all knew the real reason.

As we grew closer, our friendship became a kind of refuge. Somehow, through the darkness each of us faced, we managed to find light in our shared, secret world.

Eventually, the day came when Sophie’s mother broke the news: her father had been reassigned to a different state, and they’d be moving by summer. The three of us took it hard, though none of us admitted just how much. I couldn’t help but think of all the little things I’d miss: her dark, silky hair always pulled back by that gold and pink barrette with a silver butterfly—the one she’d worn since sixth grade. I’d miss her steady, golden-brown eyes. And most of all, I’d just miss her.

The Plan

We spent the afternoon hurling every desperate question at her. “Can’t you just tell them you don’t want to go?” “What if your dad just goes, and you and your mom stay here?” But as Sophie sat there, taking it all in, the hope faded from her face. Eventually, silence settled over us.

I finally broke it. “I’m going to miss you, Sophie…”

Billy looked up from his deck of monster cards, his face unusually serious. “Yeah…we both will.”

Sophie got up slowly, her eyes filling with tears. “I’m going to miss you guys, too…” She took a deep breath and forced a small, wobbly smile. “But hey, summer’s still a month away. We can make the most of it.”

Seeing her smile through her tears made Billy and me stand up too. Billy, with a grin that stretched across his braces, reached over and grabbed our shoulders, giving them a gentle shake. “Come on, guys, enough with the waterworks! If Sophie’s leaving, we’re going to send her off with a bang.”

Sophie and I exchanged confused glances. I raised an eyebrow. “What’re you talking about, Billy?”

“Here’s the plan: we all sneak out tonight. Bring something important to you. When our parents go to bed, we’ll meet here at the school.” He smirked, raising his eyebrows mischievously. “I’ll explain the rest then.”

There was a beat of silence before Sophie nodded, clearing her throat. “Yeah…yeah, I’m in.”

Not wanting to be the only one left out, I swallowed my nerves and agreed, too. By 2 a.m., we’d all be here, at the playground, ready for whatever Billy had in mind.



2 A.M.

That night, I waited impatiently for my mom to fall asleep on the couch downstairs. It was Friday, and she’d gotten back late, probably exhausted after a long week at the office. She’d barely made it halfway through the latest episode of her favorite reality show before dozing off. Cracking my door just enough to peer through, I saw the dim glow of the television bouncing off the wall, casting shadows up the staircase. I held my breath, pressing my ear to the opening. Besides the hum of the TV, everything was still—until I heard my mom’s heavy snores start to blend with the drone of the show.

Suppressing a grin, I eased the door shut. I crept to the window, grabbing the special item Billy had insisted we bring and the flashlight I’d stashed on my dresser. Sitting on the edge of my bed, I laced up my shoes, my heart beating faster with a mix of excitement and nerves. This was a first for me—sneaking out into the night felt as exhilarating as it did terrifying. I could already picture my mom’s wrath if I got caught. Taking a steadying breath, I gripped my flashlight and my item, then slowly opened the window.

As I maneuvered out, a branch scraped against the frame, louder than I’d hoped. Wincing, I steadied myself on one of the thicker branches of the tree just outside. Half-hanging from the window, I glanced down and saw the old tire swing swaying slightly from my efforts. I swallowed hard; even with the low branches, the ground felt much farther away in the dark. After shifting my weight carefully, I managed to swing my leg over to a sturdy branch supporting the tire swing. Now completely secured to the tree, I reached out and gently slid my window seal closed. Finally, with one last steadying breath, I climbed down.

After what felt like ages, I dropped to the ground, my heart racing. Once I’d made it to the sidewalk and was out of sight of the house, I dared to turn on my flashlight. The street was silent, empty but for the flickering pools of light beneath each streetlamp. Each step I took sounded louder than it should, echoing against the sleeping houses I passed. My nerves prickled as I picked up my pace, eager to reach the schoolyard and the thrill of whatever lay ahead.

About halfway to the school, an uneasy sensation crept over me, prickling at the back of my neck like a cold hand. It felt like someone—or something—was watching me. Every few steps, I glanced over my shoulder, only to see the dark street behind me, empty but for the occasional pool of flickering streetlight casting faint halos on the cold, cracked cement. The houses lining the road were pitch black, almost lifeless in the late hour. I found myself scanning the dimly lit windows, expecting to catch a shadowed figure standing there, but there was nothing. Just the silence of a street that felt a little too empty, a little too quiet.

I tried to shake it off, reassuring myself that it was just nerves—being alone this late could get anyone’s imagination running wild. For a while, it worked. I pressed on, my stride steady, only two blocks from the school now, feeling my heartbeat settle. But then, out of nowhere, my stomach dropped. Parked along the curb, just a little ways up, was a beaten-up black sedan. A faint, torn sticker on the back bumper read the letters “U-D-E-N-T” in faded white text, the rest of the letters long since scraped away. The car sat just beyond the reach of the nearest streetlight, shrouded in shadow.

I froze. I’d seen that same car at least twice already. Once back on Glendale, then again just before the turn onto Main. And now here it was, waiting, almost as if it knew exactly where I was going. My hands felt clammy around the flashlight, and my chest tightened, my heartbeat quickening. I turned my gaze back to the ground, pretending not to notice, hoping that whoever was in the car wouldn’t take any interest in me. But questions buzzed in my mind like static. Was I really being followed? If so, who was in that car? And why were they so fixated on where I was headed?

Trying to keep my composure, I kept walking, heart pounding as I made the final turn towards the school. Just as I rounded the corner, a glint of light in my peripheral vision caught my attention, and I flinched. The sedan’s headlights clicked on, slicing through the dark. The car roared to life, its engine low and menacing. I whipped around, catching a glimpse of the taillights disappearing down the road as it sped away.

Not wanting to wait around to see if it would loop back, I took off in a sprint, my flashlight bouncing wildly in my hand as I darted towards the school. Reaching the chain-link fence, I leapt over it and ran across the schoolyard, finally ducking around the corner of the building, my breath coming in short gasps. And there, sitting on the ground with a deck of cards spread between them, were Billy and Sophie, flashlights pointed down at the makeshift playing area.

I must’ve looked like I’d seen a ghost because, as soon as I rounded the corner, both of them jumped up, alarmed.

“What’s wrong?” Sophie’s voice was barely above a whisper, her golden-brown eyes wide as she studied my face.

Billy’s expression turned serious, a rare moment when his usual smile faded.

Catching my breath, I managed to choke out, “Someone… pant* Someone was… pant* following me.” I pointed back toward the street, just out of sight.

The three of us stood in tense silence, the chill of the night settling around us. For a moment, the schoolyard felt like an island, surrounded by a darkness that suddenly felt a little more dangerous.

Billy’s eyes narrowed as he processed what I’d just told them. “What do you mean someone’s been following you?”

I struggled to catch my breath, relaying every detail. Sophie’s face paled, her disbelief evident, while Billy stayed quiet, his eyes scanning the dark street as if expecting to see the car pull up any moment.

Billy: “Are you sure it was the same car?”

Me: “Yeah, I’m sure. It had this sticker—same spot, same torn letters.”

Billy’s expression hardened. “Then that’s it. We’re not splitting up tonight. We’ll walk home together—Sophie’s place first, then yours.”

Sophie crossed her arms, shaking her head as she sat back down on the pavement. “And leave you to walk home alone, Billy? No chance.” Her voice trembled but stayed firm.

She took a deep breath, seeming to come to a decision. “My dad’s out of town, and Mom’s knocked out sick. She won’t be waking up anytime soon. Why don’t we all stay at my place until sunrise? You guys can walk home in the morning, together. Safer that way.”

Billy and I exchanged a nervous glance.

Billy shrugged, trying to play it cool. “If you say so.”

As the tension settled a bit, my curiosity surfaced, momentarily overriding the fear. “So, Billy, what was the deal with bringing something personal tonight?”

Billy smirked, surprised I’d even remembered, but the glint in his eyes was unmistakable; a mix of excitement and something darker.

Billy: “We’ll get to that. Let’s just get out of here first.”

We helped Billy gather his cards scattered on the ground, then cautiously peered around the corner toward the empty street beyond the playground. No sign of the car. Taking turns, we hopped the fence one by one, making our way through the quiet streets toward Sophie’s house, each step echoing louder than the last.

About twenty minutes later, Sophie’s house came into view. Even at night, it stood out among its neighbors, its fresh light blue paint and crisp white window trims practically glowing in the moonlight. The garage door looked polished, and the front lawn, neatly mowed, framed a granite pathway that stretched from the sidewalk to the front door. Above the entrance hung a plaque with the family name, The Colemans. Somehow, even after everything that happened tonight, Sophie’s house still managed to feel like home.

“How are we going to do this?” I asked as the three of us made our way closer to the house. 

Sophie: “My mom should be asleep in her bedroom. Luckily for us, my room is on the far end of the house so she shouldn’t hear us in there. I’ll check to make sure she’s still asleep. Then I’ll come back out and get you guys.”

Billy: “Alright, we’ll be out here waiting.”

The three of us were now standing just out front of her house on the sidewalk. Sophie walked down the granite pathway leading to her front door. Kneeling over, she grabbed something from underneath the planter box off to the side of the door and got back on her feet. Moments later, the door was opened and Sophie disappeared inside the house. 

Now it was just the two of us. Billy looked back over his shoulder, eyes trailing toward the road we’d come from, where it vanished into the dark. For a moment, I saw that what I’d told him had really shaken him.

In a low voice, I said, “I think we’re OK. I didn’t see any sign of that car the whole way here.” Billy kept his gaze down the empty street, as if weighing his next words carefully. When he finally spoke, his tone matched mine.

Billy: “Yeah… I know. It’s just… things weren’t supposed to go down like this.”

I turned to face him, watching his profile as he remained fixed on the street.

Me: “What do you mean, ‘wasn’t supposed to go down like this’?”

Billy’s eyes broke from the road and found mine in the shadowed dark, his expression guarded.

Billy: “You know what I mean, Josh…”

He forced a faint smile.

Billy: “This was supposed to be a ‘send-off’ for Sophie—a big bang, one last night with no worries, like old times. Just us. But now it’s… complicated.”

He sighed, his gaze dropping to the ground.

Billy: “Now, it’s messy, and—”

I cut in, “It’s not ruined, Billy. Whatever you had planned, we can still do it. The night’s not over.”

Billy’s eyes flicked up, and in that moment, Sophie appeared at her front door, waving us inside.

Billy whispered, a small smile forming, “You’re right… We still have time.”

We shared a brief look before slipping into the quiet of Sophie’s house, following her down the hall to her room, the night’s unease still hanging heavy in the air.

Once Sophie was sure we hadn’t woken her mother, she carefully eased her bedroom door shut, not letting it make a sound. Then, just as cautiously, she opened the small window facing the backyard, letting in a whisper of the night’s chill beyond the glow of her room.

She turned back to us and whispered, “You guys can leave this way when the sun starts to come up. We have to stay quiet and make sure to whisper. There’s no telling when my mom might wake up.”

Billy took his usual spot on the edge of Sophie’s bed, and I sank into the purple bean bag in the corner of her room, feeling its familiar, cushioned comfort. Sophie’s room was as I remembered, walls painted a soft pink, dotted with posters and reminders of the countless hours we’d spent here after school, playing games on the small TV perched on her dresser.

But this time, something felt different. For the first time, I realized this wasn’t just any hangout—it was the first time I’d ever been in a girl’s room without any adults around, the door shut, our secret night stretching before us. For a second, a thrill sparked up within me, that strange, innocent excitement that I quickly brushed aside, reminding myself why we were here.

Billy broke the silence, drawing my attention back. His voice, quiet but steady, pulled me out of my thoughts and back into the moment as I glanced from him to Sophie, my earlier excitement fading back into the shadows of the night.

Billy looked at us seriously. “Did everyone bring their item?”

He motioned us over to the bed. Sitting down cross-legged, he pulled something from his pocket, his face shifting to a quiet intensity.

I glanced at Sophie, who was still standing by the window, curiosity flickering in her eyes. We exchanged a quick look, then both kicked off our shoes and joined Billy on her bed, sitting cross-legged in a small circle.

Billy smiled and held out his most prized possession: a platinum-edition Dracula card he’d pulled from a pack he bought last summer in Washington. He’d talked endlessly about this card—the rare, glitter-coated Dracula with a glinting red eye and a single fang. Sophie and I stared at it, captivated by the strange figure on the card, half-shadowed in black.

Billy extended his hand toward Sophie. “I want you to have it.”

Sophie looked at him, stunned. “Are you serious? This is too—”

“Yes, Sophie. I mean it.” Billy’s voice softened. “So you don’t forget us. Josh and I both want you to know how much you mean to us.”

Sophie, visibly holding back tears, took the card in her hand. She looked at both of us, pressing the card to her chest.

Billy nudged me, giving me a look that broke my daze. “Come on, man, you didn’t think I’d be the only one giving something up, did you? Your turn.”

Taking a breath, I reached into my back pocket and pulled out a small blue and gray pocket knife engraved with “K.P.”—my father’s initials.

Billy’s brows furrowed. “A pocket knife? Josh, why?”

“It… it was my dad’s.” I swallowed, feeling Billy’s concern as he glanced between me and Sophie. “My mom gave it to me on my tenth birthday.”

Billy shook his head. “Josh, you don’t have to do that…”

I gave a small smile and took a deep breath. “No, I want to.” I extended the knife to Sophie, who stared, unsure. “Please. Take it.”

Reluctantly, Sophie took the knife, her fingers curling around it. She pressed both items to her chest, a few tears slipping free. “Thank you, both of you… I’m going to miss you.”

We each put a hand on her shoulder, laughing softly at how sentimental we’d all become. After a moment, Sophie composed herself, then took out the gold and pink barrette she wore every day. She handed it to Billy, smiling. “This was from my grandma. It’s not much, but I want you to have it.”

Billy laughed, clipping the barrette in his hair with a mock accent. “Why, thank you.” Then, quieter, “I’ll take good care of it.”

We laughed and continued talking as the night stretched on, the weight of the goodbye softened by the warmth of each other’s presence. For a while, I forgot the sense of dread from earlier, feeling only the bond we shared.

Eventually, the first rays of dawn crept through the window. Billy glanced at Sophie’s clock—“4:45 AM.”

“I think it’s time. Don’t want anyone realizing we’re gone,” he said, slipping on his shoes.

I stood up, stretching, as Sophie opened her window to let in a gust of cool morning air and the faint chirping of birds.

“Alright… good luck, guys,” she whispered as Billy climbed out first.

As I put my shoes on and reached the window, Sophie placed her hand on my arm. I turned, catching the faint scent of her flowery conditioner. She leaned in and kissed my cheek, smiling. “Don’t think I forgot about your gift, Josh Peters.”

My face flushed as she gave me a gentle push through the window.

“Gross,” Billy muttered playfully.

I turned back to see Sophie, still standing by the window, giving us a small wave. For a second, I couldn’t believe it. Sophie Coleman had actually kissed me.

Billy tapped my shoulder, breaking my daze. “Snap out of it, man. We need to get home before we’re dead meat.” He headed toward the fence, and I followed.

I walked Billy home since his house was on the way. With the sun rising, the earlier fear had mostly faded, and a couple of early-morning cars passed as we strolled down the road.

“You kissed Sophie!” Billy teased.

“Shut up, Billy! It was just the cheek,” I said, smiling.

He laughed as we continued, that moment replaying in my head.

When we reached his place, I noticed his mom’s car wasn’t there. “Where’s your mom’s car?”

“She went out with her boyfriend last night. She still hasn’t come back. Lucky me, right?” he said with a shrug.

“Well, I’d better get home too. I’ll see you Monday?” I asked.

Already walking to his door, he raised a hand. “Yeah, Josh. See you then.”

I continued to my house, feeling a wave of relief seeing all the lights off. My mom was still asleep. Quietly, I climbed the tree outside my window and slipped back into my room. I’d forgotten I’d left the window open, but everything was just as I’d left it.

Closing the window behind me, I exhaled, finally feeling safe. Changing into my pajamas, I crawled into bed, exhaustion setting in as I drifted into a deep, peaceful sleep.
