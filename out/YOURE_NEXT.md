Hey I'm.......and I went hiking with my 2 friends kai and joey, kai was tall skinny and a total gym boy, joey was the opposite he was short tubby and kinda weird,  I'm the middle ground I like gaming in short but I do work out, this might be important later

We were climbing Mt ghost it was given its name because its rumored to be haunted. Us three don't believe in ghosts but we love anything horror, we finally convinced joey to climb with us so off we went. it took 2 hours till we got about half way up and we left at 4 o'clock because we wanted it to be dark. We agreed that we would take the cable car back down, in hindsight I really regret that. 

We stopped and sat on some benches and ate the food we packed.
We reached the top nearly 2 hours later at   7:49 pm on a British, winter so it was cold wet and dark, we took some pictures made some memories but were disappointed at the lack of horror. We found the sign directing us to the cable car and hopped in, there was only one running car as it wasn't that popular so a couple around their late 30s was in there too, but we didn't really mind. We just wanted to go home.

We were riding this rusted squeaky car down The mountain, then I looked out the window I saw a strange figure just staring at us, but I figured that it was a prop to scare people  who went, but this cable car ride was taking a while to reach the bottom,  it had been a half-hour and something was weird about this couple next to us, they were silent but not just that, they were completely blank in their expressions too I was growing anxious about this and asked how their climb  
Was, but there was no response not even a change in face still blank, so I asked kai if they were acting a bit weird he agreed but said it wad probably because of the atmosphere of the mountain and I figured he was right.

we suddenly stopped and the couple stood up to leave but we weren't at the bottom we had gotten stuck, yet they opened the door and went to walk out but me and my friend grabbed them, and told them that we weren't at the bottom yet and that we were still mid air but they still said nothing pushed us off and walked out we were shocked and looked at the ground with our torches but they were gone, no body, no sign of them we tried to call the police but we had no signal, we then realised that joey never got on the cart with us, joey was very quiet and could easily walk out and we wouldn't notice for 10 minutes, not because we didn't like him but because he never made himself apparent and we were both so weirded out by the couple that he slipped our mind so we tried to shout to him to go get help because we were stuck but no reply then the cable car started shaking and rocking we held on tight and then it calmed down and we didn't know what was happening. Kai wondered if he could rope crawl to the bottom, but I said we were still to high up to even risk it so I said we would wait till morning.

It became morning after what felt like forever but then we thought about how joey was with us walking to the cable car and he wouldn't just stand there, no especially not joey he was the one who was desperate to go home so that's when I mentioned the figure I saw and kai told me to look over in that direction again but nothing was there, but something was definitely there before, I'm certain of it I looked at the huge rocky edge of the mountain and saw a huge blood drip, and what could only be joey impaled by a rock spike that was coming out his chest, we were frozen in pure terror.

We didn't know what happened but we knew something was going on then I saw it the shadowy figure with bright white eyes and a a beaming sickle smile and in blood the words "YOU'RE NEXT"  it was joey's blood I looked back at him and he disappeared then kai quietly utters the words "im next its me" I told him I won't let that happen but when I saw his face it was a warped painful smile the same smile as the figures, eyes hollow with blood dripping from them and he falls to the floor. Dead.

I realised he was going to kill me next so I took a risk, I climbed down the cable like kai suggested, my hands were bleeding i was mentally drained and sleepless yet the furthest thing from tired, i almost reached the bottom when something whispered Into my ear "you're next" I was with frozen fear, but I was close enough to the ground to let go, but I underestimated the fall and snapped my ankle it was completely broken I tried to crawl away but was dragged back by something yet nothing was there I felt a rock hit my head then everything went black.

I don't know how long it had been but it was dark again I heard the figure repeating the same words "you're next" over and over again then the  figure went silent someone reported  joeys body and the police were searching the area the figure emerged from shadow but this was no human he grabbed a long rusty machete put a stick in my mouth and dragged me off into a cave.

After being sat there for a while i was going to try to distract it or even kill it. I barely got up with My broken ankle but i managed to stand just High enough to grab the machete and swing at his neck it stuck into his neck but had no effect but it distracted him enough to let me get away despite my snapped ankle I was filled with enough adrenaline and anger that a makeshift stick-cruch would be good enough to get away he tried to grab me but wasn't close enough then it happened again the invisible force but it didn't matter I was close enough to the police that they would hear Me if I shouted loud enough so I did and they came running towards me I figured he could only use that invisible power on one person and I was right he couldn't let suspicion raise about something being there in the forest shadows so he let me go but when I was driving away in the back of the police car the back seat said "you're next" then I remembered  the blank face couple.........
