I didn’t leave the office straight away.

I sat there staring at my own line item.

ACTIVE — ADEQUATE

Projected exhaustion window: 14–21 months

Replacement: READY

The fan inside the computer kept spinning. The building kept humming.

Someone upstairs was already tagged.

Someone was already becoming what I was becoming.

I stood up slowly, like I was afraid of triggering something just by moving.

I left the office with the spare key still in my pocket.

The hallway outside was empty.

Not normal-empty. Cleared**.**

Like the building knew I was moving through it and had made space.

When I reached my floor, my apartment door was unlocked.

I stood there for a second, key still in my hand, staring at the gap like it was going to explain itself.

I knew I’d locked it. I always lock it.

I pushed the door open with my shoulder.

Inside, everything was… finished.

Not “tidy,” not “put away.” Finished the way a hotel room is finished.

The trash was gone. The sink was empty. The dish rack was dry and stacked like it had been sitting that way for hours.

My cameras were still plugged in. Their little LEDs were steady.

I opened the app.

Living room. Kitchen. Hallway.

All three feeds were clean. Smooth. No gaps. No missing blocks of time.

But something felt off with them.

Not the picture.

The timing.

I watched the living-room feed and looked up at my actual living room.

The movements matched… but they didn’t line up the way “live” should.

The feed was too smooth. Too composed. Like it had been edited for continuity.

I lifted my hand and held up two fingers.

In the feed, my hand came up the same angle, same speed…

but there was the tiniest delay, and it wasn’t a normal lag.

Normal lag is messy. It stutters. It drops a frame.

This didn’t.

It slid into place like the app already knew where my hand was going.

I tried again, faster.

A sharp movement.

And again the feed followed perfectly, no blur, no ugly catch-up.

Just… a clean version of the action.

I switched to the hallway camera, the one facing my bedroom.

I stepped into frame and stopped dead.

The person in the feed stopped too.

But the way he stopped didn’t match the way I stopped.

I’d hesitated. My weight had shifted forward like I might keep walking.

In the feed, the stop was decisive. Clean. Finished.

An edit.

I felt cold creep up my arms.

I checked the little “LIVE” indicator in the corner. It was there. Bright. Confident.

I tapped to rewind, just a few minutes, just to compare.

The playback didn’t jump the way it had the first night.

No missing time. No skipped stamps.

Which should have made me feel better.

Because the first night, the cameras had gone blind during the gaps.

Now the cameras weren’t going blind at all.

Now they were giving me a version that had no gaps to find.

I sat down on the couch and watched myself do it on three different screens.

Same room. Same me.

I went into the bedroom.

The closet door was open.

Not wide. Just enough that I knew it hadn’t been like that when I left.

The laundry basket was inside.

Empty.

I crouched and put my hand against the plastic rim.

It was warm.

The air still had that faint detergent smell that doesn’t linger unless something was just washed.

I hadn’t run a load of laundry in days.

I stood up slowly, my heart starting to beat too fast.

There was only one place that could explain that.

The laundry room.

I didn’t want to go back there.

But my feet were already moving.

The hallway was quiet.

The light above the laundry room flickered as I reached the door.

Inside, the same machine was running.

The far one.

The loud one.

The one no one ever used.

The sound was different now.

Not violent.

Not rattling.

Steady.

I pulled out my phone without thinking and brought up the camera feed.

The hallway view showed me standing in the doorway, staring in, as if I had never left the apartment.

The timestamp was still perfect.

Still continuous.

Then the feed froze for just a split second.

Not a glitch.

Not a drop.

Just… a pause.

When it resumed, there was a thin gray bar across the top of the video.

Text I had never seen before.

CONTINUITY WINDOW — ACTIVE

I stared at it, my skin prickling.

Another line appeared beneath it.

ANCHOR SUPPORT REQUIRED

My mouth went dry.

This wasn’t a notification.

It was part of the interface.

Like it had always been there, just hidden until now.

I felt something inside my chest shift, not pain, not fear, something looser.

A thread being gently pulled.

The floor beneath the washing machine moved.

Like something adjusting its weight.

I froze, my hand still hovering in the air where I had just touched the rim of the machine. The vibration wasn’t strong, but it was deliberate.

I knelt and pressed my palm to the concrete.

It didn’t feel like a floor.

It felt like a membrane.

There was a faint give to it, just enough that my skin registered it before my mind could.

My phone buzzed.

The hallway camera feed flickered, just once. When it stabilized, the image wasn’t quite right. The angle was the same. The lighting was the same. But the version of me standing in the frame didn’t line up with the way I felt in my body.

The one on the screen looked tired.

Used.

Like a person who had already been doing this for a long time.

Text slid across the feed.

CONTINUITY DROP DETECTED

Another line followed, quiet and clinical.

TRANSFER IN PROGRESS

I stared at it, my mouth dry.

Transfer.

That was when everything I had been circling for days finally snapped into place.

The folded clothes.

The clean apartment.

The gaps in the footage.  
The time I couldn’t remember.

The building wasn’t doing those things for me.

It was doing them while I wasn’t here.

It was the system rerouting the part of me that could still move through domestic routines, that could fold clothes and wipe counters and hold attention steady.

Every time the cameras skipped…

that was when the building had taken me.

Not my body.

My attention.

I wasn’t losing time.

I was being assigned to it.

And it was being routed somewhere else.

Down.

To whatever was pushing up against the foundation.

To whatever needed continuous human presence to stay contained.

The washing machine began to hum louder, but it wasn’t the sound of a motor anymore. It was layered. Thick. Almost… wet.

The air in the room felt heavier, pressing against my ears. 

It was relaxed.

I knew what Unit 2B was now.

The feeder units stabilized it.  
The anchor stabilized the fault.  
And the fault kept reality from tearing itself open.

People weren’t being punished.

They were being spent.

Slowly. Carefully. Efficiently.

Like a resource.

The washing machine door creaked.

I hadn’t touched it.

It opened just enough for me to see that there was nothing inside. No clothes. No water. Just depth, a darkness that didn’t behave like a shadow. It felt like something was looking back at me through it.

Not watching.

Waiting.

I could feel it now, in my chest. Not pain. Not fear.

A pull.

The same pull that had been lifting parts of me away during the gaps. The same quiet force that had been taking the version of me that still knew how to be present and routing it somewhere below.

I was being allocated.

The building had been doing this for decades. Maybe longer. Different systems. Different software. Different contributors.

But always the same pattern.

When they start to fail, replace them.

I thought about the man on the stairs.  
The woman who used to cry on the phone.  
The dozens of names in the Anchor History.

None of them had left.

No-one actually left. They were just Exhausted or Withdrawn or Terminated once their usefulness had finished.

My phone vibrated again.

ANCHOR SUPPORT REQUIRED

It wasn’t a warning.

It was a request.

And the most terrifying part was how normal it felt to read it.

How easy it would be to just… step forward.

To let the building do what it was designed to do.

With my help, whatever was under the building would remain contained.

So if this is my last update…

If I stop replying.

If Unit 2B stays occupied but my name never comes back…

You’ll know why.

Because sometimes the reason a place feels so stable…

is because someone is being quietly folded into it.

Over and over.

Until there’s nothing left to [unfold](https://www.reddit.com/r/ThisIsntRight/).
