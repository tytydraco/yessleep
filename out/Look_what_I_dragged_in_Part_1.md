I feel like a lot of people underestimate the unknown, or rather, they overestimate what they know. We boast about our knowledge of the world around us, we do so with such vigor that sometimes we fall into a trap of feeling as if there isn’t anything large left for us to learn. This knowledge leads to a severe lack of fear when it comes to considering what dangers exist in our cities and towns. If we didn’t chart out ecosystems and predict the weather changes around us, life would be a lot more scary. It’s hard for anything from the natural world to come as a blatant surprise these days when we have long been hounding it for answers and details as to how it works.



And yet, to this day, we are still discovering new species of animals. Whether they’re tucked deep in the foliage of our rainforests or lurking thousands of feet beneath the ocean’s surface, we don’t know everything that’s out there.. And that is something that really shouldn’t be glossed over as much as it is. Because when you are not prepared to see something that defies every expectation you had set for the environment you inhabit, you are reduced to nothing else than a clueless deer in headlights. Can do nothing more than watch it hurdle towards you and pray it doesn't hurt as much as you know it could.



In my town, you can find this lack of fear rampant in the people that live here. It’s a little backwater pit not far from nowhere, with nothing but trees and barren roads for what felt like miles in every direction. The youth resent how constricting and quiet it is, nothing more than an eighteen year sentence to serve before escaping into college. A sentiment I find myself sympathising with these days. 



On the other hand, it’s almost a paradise for newly-weds and parents-to-be. Because above all else, this little pit next to nowhere was safe. Always had been. The chances of someone even knowing it existed if they didn’t live there was slim to none. Very rarely did anyone new ever accidentally stumble in, and even rarer did they stick around afterwards.



But as I said earlier, being lenient with your expectations is a valuable skill to practice. There are always exceptions made to rules that may seem set in stone at one point or another. And when you realise that, you can finally acknowledge the true horror that resides behind the idea of danger cropping up in a place where the populace haven’t yet learned how to be scared. Where it almost never has a chance to fester.



The key word being almost.



I’ll sum it all up as best that I can, having started about a couple of months ago. Back when this stray cat started making the rounds by our house almost every day. It was this skinny little thing that was usually covered in some sort of filth. It had slightly sunken eyes that almost looked sad, and a pitiful gait. Despite the numerous complaints from my parents, I had decided to start slipping it some food whenever it would drop by. A decision I obsess over now.



My parents didn’t want me to encourage it to stick around. They’d always say it was a waste of cat food that should be going to our actual cat and that they didn’t want any fighting going on in their backyard between them. I didn’t blame them for thinking that. Pipsqueak had always been extremely aggressive and territorial to most things that weren’t human, and there was always the risk of the stray bringing disease into our house whether it affected me or Pip. Especially considering we had a cat flap it could easily access. Or rather, a dog flap that only Pip now used since our dog passed away a few years ago.



But despite this, I insisted on continuing this routine because it was one of the few interesting things that had occurred in my daily life for as long as I had remembered. Something unpredicted that added a sliver of spontaneity into my otherwise completely unremarkable day. Every night I would find myself leaving that stupid bowl out for this random cat that didn’t even always pay a visit. I knew Pipsqueak wasn’t appreciative of the habit, but I figured it wasn’t too big of a deal. Usually by the time I’d leave the food out she was already snuggled up on my bed half-asleep and she wasn’t nearly as nocturnal as most cats seemed to be. 



It soon stopped being this arbitrary thing I decided to do every night and became incorporated into my everyday schedule. I would brush my teeth, set out the bowl, and then I would go to bed. That was my nightly routine. Sometimes the stray would be waiting for me outside, and sometimes it wouldn’t. As the days went on, it would show up more and more. It started to put on a bit of weight, and its raspy noises from before turned into something closer to an actual meow. Once, I even caught it attempting to lick itself clean before I announced my presence by opening the backdoor. Whether or not I saw it at night, the bowl was always licked perfectly clean by morning.



On one of these fateful nights, there was a slight deviation to the usual programme I had established with the feline. At the time I brushed it off as some minor oddity and didn’t really think much of it. It’s with the help of hindsight that I can realise how small things like these can snowball into something much more than a “minor oddity”.



It was later than when I usually brought the food out, maybe half an hour or so. I was in the kitchen pouring some of our cat kibble into the bowl I had designated for this nightly ritual. My mother was across the open area sitting at our dining table, having been mostly silent for the last while. But she eventually spoke up.



“Do you ever plan to stop feeding that mangy thing?” She spoke in an almost off-handed manner. A comment she was accustomed to making whenever she caught me this late in the kitchen with the cat food.



I had anticipated the mildly disgusted tone, but it never made me somewhat defensive over my night-time visitor. Even if it made me feel somewhat silly deep down. I wasn’t a kid anymore, but that condescending tone had a habit of spiralling me straight back down into the cradle.



“Not really, Ma.” I mumbled in response, not quiet but unintelligible all the same. 



I grabbed the bowl and walked over to our backdoors. They were made of glass so I took the time to peer through intently, hoping to see the familiar sight of wide green eyes reflecting the porchlight back at me. While they were absent on that occasion, I still opened the door to go and place the food outside. My Mother muttered something as I did so. It was some other exasperated comment about what I was doing so I didn’t say anything in response, and I shut the door behind me.



I put the bowl in its usual spot near the door, calling out for the stray with the shushing sound it often responded to. But I saw and heard nothing. There weren’t any quiet mewls or chitters in the distance nor were there any furry looking shadows dancing around in the bushes that lined our porch barrier. The stray often jumped up in the wide gap between the spindles right into the shrubbery from the space behind the ledge, but that night wasn’t one of those nights.



I recall that I found myself mildly disappointed it hadn’t dropped by to skulk around for a bit, but all I did was call out one last time before withdrawing back into the house. I couldn’t bring myself to be annoyed at its absence when it wasn't even technically our cat. Pipsqueak was waiting for me upstairs on my bed, after all. Maybe I just missed seeing a fresh face, even if it belonged to some random animal. I knew I needed to get out more.



By the time I was in bed it was around eleven. It never really took me too long to fall asleep. Pip had settled against one of my legs atop the duvet, basically gone already. I shoved my phone under my pillow and shut my eyes, drifting to sleep as normally as I usually did.



A few hours later, I found myself awake for no immediate reason I could determine. It didn’t bother me too much, as I could usually fall asleep again as quickly as I woke up. And it wasn’t completely unheard of for Pipsqueak to wake me up on the odd occasion, whether it was her moving or her oddly loud snores. I had assumed the latter that night until I realised she wasn’t there. I didn’t feel the usual pressure on my legs or a gentle honking sound emanating from across the blanket.



I sat up, confirming that she wasn’t there. Not out of the ordinary, sometimes Pip would take a wander during the night. And more often than not I’d slam my head straight back down and nod off. But when I moved, I instantly grimaced at the feeling of saliva smeared across my face. I wiped it off in confusion at the unexpected feeling. I hadn’t known myself to be a big drooler in my sleep, so I wasn’t used to the unpleasant sensation of slobber being spread against my mouth and chin. The feeling of it encrusted between my gums.



I decided to go and get some water to wash it out, and that it wasn’t worth going to sleep trying to cope with the gross feeling. I flicked on the lamp by my bed and scooted over to the edge. I paused for a moment, taking the time to listen out for the sound of our cat’s claws clicking against the wooden floorboards. Aside from the stifled hum of our fridge downstairs, I heard nothing but silence inside the house, while wind raged against our walls outside. There was a loud rattling accompanying it, the sound of our botched shed door below my window. I had been begging for my father to fix it since, as it wasn’t uncommon for the sound to rouse me.



I stood up, trying not to feel as if I was intruding on my own residence and made my way downstairs. I was careful to avoid the boards I knew had a mean creak to them as I did so, even in the pitch-blackness. I didn’t see Pipsqueak once as I went.



I stumbled into the kitchen, only turning on the dim counter lights to illuminate the rest of the way. I filled a glass with tap water, taking a sip to swish around my mouth and spit into the sink. I was about to do it one more time, but soon stopped with the glass pressed against my lips. I heard something outside on the porch.



I recognized the sound pretty easily, it was the scraping of ceramic against wood. I heard it often weeks ago when the stray got exceptionally excited about a meal, eating so aggressively it kept accidentally hitting its nose against the edge of the bowl and consequently shoving it away. I put the glass down and walked over to the backdoors to go and greet the cat, but when I came into view, it had left. The noise had stopped sometime while I walked over, and when I looked out there was no sign of any creature having been there. Just the bowl, almost completely empty, and farther away from the door than I had ever seen it. Almost right up against the wooden railings and plants. My eyes darted around to try and find a glimpse of a tail, eye, anything.



But it was just darkness and meaningless silhouettes. I reached my hand out to tug on the door handle, having half a mind to call out for it in the middle of the night. But I changed my mind. And I dropped my hand down a bit further to turn the lock instead. We didn’t often lock it, our yard was enclosed in a fence and, once again, our area was remarkably crime-free. But for some reason on that particular night, I felt the urge to strive for security instead of searching for a random cat that was probably only using me for food.



As I looked out into the void of my backyard, I was brought back to a time when I was younger, tugging on my mother’s jeans and begging her to shut the blinds at night so I wouldn’t have to see the blank nothingness on the other side of the glass. Or at least that’s what she believed me to be frightened of. Something I never told her was that I was far more worried of what could have been looking in. All the while I remained unaware as I basked in the light of the inside. That I was under the illusion I was safe. This trepidation faded with age, but I felt it a bit back in that moment.



I scanned the porch one last time, eyes lingering on the bowl that seemed almost miles away before turning and leaving. I flicked the kitchen light on the way out, leaving only darkness behind me. When I got to my bedroom door, I realised Pipsqueak had returned.

She stared at me from the bed while I stood in the dark hallway, eyes half-lidded and curious. I stayed for a moment more, a smile creeping onto my face at the sight of her head lowering onto the blanket as if it weighed a hundred pounds. 



I left the door partially ajar behind me in case she wished to leave during the night. As I crawled back into bed, I made sure to flip my pillow before putting my head anywhere near. I felt Pip stretch her small paws on top of me before I fell asleep again.



In the morning that followed, I had closed the front door behind me and was halfway down our driveway when I was stopped by a polite meow coming from my left. Under the hedge, I saw what used to be my nocturnal visitor. The stray was crouched under one of our hedges, and when it noticed my staring it stood up and pranced over with a few quiet murrs. It coiled around my leg and looked up at me almost expectantly. It seemed rather hungry despite the fact it should have eaten earlier in the morning. It was then that the previous oddity from last night had some sort of an explanation.



I assumed that a fox or some other type of animal in the area had crept into our garden and eaten the food instead of the stray. And that the cat had probably avoided the garden because it knew there was some bigger animal back there that it didn’t want to get too close to. That was the only reason I could think of that would make it skip out on our usual deal. I grabbed a different bowl from the kitchen to leave its food in, this time beside our front door and headed on my way to the bus stop. With that revelation in mind, that was when the adjustments had first begun. Where it all began, really.



In the following two weeks I began to leave the bowl at our front door instead of on the porch. Whatever animal had eaten the food had probably crept in from the big back road behind our house, as it was pretty easy for most animals to find a way through our wooden fences. Not to mention the road was surrounded by fields and trees, a hotspot for wildlife. You wouldn’t really find many interesting things around here other than the occasional fox or rabbit. But either way, I didn’t want whatever it was sticking around in case it was on the more dangerous side. I had more than one cat to keep safe around the place at this point, no matter what my mother said.



However, after those two weeks I had to return to using the back porch. Other neighbourhood pets were becoming interested in our house, and my parents didn’t really appreciate that. So after enough complaining I soon started placing it back by our glass doors. It wasn’t too big of a deal, though. I figured the unwanted guest that had robbed the food was long gone by now.



Right before I did, I remember my father mentioning some peculiar sights he had noticed on the roads the past week or so. I had barely been listening, as I was busy opening a fresh bag of cat kibble until I noticed the disbelief in his tone.



“Swear to God, I’ve seen about six this week alone. Mangled little bastards.” He had grumbled, rolling a cigarette at the kitchen table next to my mother.



I had hummed in acknowledgement, not too alarmed by it. It made sense. It was badger season, more were gonna be crossing the roads, more were going to be hit by cars, and there were going to be more corpses on the roads. Not to mention the fact he worked the night shift every other week, driving to work right around where badgers would be most active. But I was somewhat caught off-guard by the disgust he displayed at the memory. I had never known him to be even slightly squeamish. Although I imagine seeing mashed animal corpses plaguing the roads every night could be unnerving to anybody. I wish I had asked more questions about the badgers, but I instead left him to discuss it with my mother so I could bring the usual bowl of food out to the front of the house.



The stray wasn’t there, which had become a more common occurrence over the past while. So I just gave the drive-way a half hearted glance before turning to go back inside. Before I opened the door I caught sight of something on the adjoining window. 



A patch of it was foggy, and had a few small droplets trickling further down the lower pane. Like a weeping cloud had been trapped inside. It hadn’t been raining, but it was freezing out so I realised it was condensation. Something had been breathing against the glass not too long ago. And when I looked closer, there were patterns wiped into the material. The marks were lined with traces of a thick, bubbly froth, left by a tongue that had swiped across the splotch in a crude zig-zag. Far too big to belong to a cat.



Mildly perturbed, I crouched down to try and get a closer look. I didn’t touch it, of course, as I didn’t know what had left it. It wasn’t low enough on the pane to be a cat, badger or any other animal I knew that lived in our area. Though, at the time, I chalked it up to one of the neighbour’s dogs getting too interested in the food I was leaving out. Or at least that’s the explanation I forced myself to believe. I zoned out while thinking about it, unconsciously peering through the glass into the house behind. I stared for a long moment, goose bumps shuddered up my arm that I couldn't just chalk up to the cold.



I saw into our kitchen through the hallway door we almost always left open. I saw our counter, and the bag of cat food lying on top of it.



I looked over my shoulder, both relieved and disappointed to see nothing behind me. And then I re-entered the house without sparing the window a second glance. However I continued to dwell on it for the following couple of days, and started shutting doors in the house with more regularity. Alongside whatever curtains and blinds I could.



Things returned to a sense of normalcy after that. I started feeding the stray a bit earlier, usually when the sun just started setting. And when I could, I'd stick around for the fifteen or so minutes it needed to eat. Just in case whatever had been back here hadn't completely moved on. At the time, I was almost certain it had.



It got to the point where I was feeling comfortingly alone in the areas around our house, but achingly lonely when inside. It was pathetic, really, but whenever I caught a window downstairs that was uncovered at night it made me sick to my stomach. The idea that something could be looking in at me while I remained clueless haunted me, the remnants of a childhood fear that refused to move on. I'd awkwardly shimmy to the side of the window, trying not to look out whenever I needed to close it. 



Eventually, maybe inevitably, I was late again. The moon was already out, and the porch was a similar darkness to what I had been used to weeks ago. Nothing but vague shapes and shadows that blended together into different darker and threatening shades of black. But nonetheless, I placed the bowl down and called out for my visitor. I thought it was going to be one of those nights where it bailed on me. I had learned that if it wasn't already waiting on me, nine times out of ten it wasn't going to show up until much later. Right when I was about to turn in, I was pleasantly surprised.



I caught a glimpse of it underneath the bushes lining our porch. Looking up at me, reflecting the porch light with its tell-tale, greeny mirror eyes. I recall with vivid clarity the confusion as to why it didn't come up to greet me or make a move toward the bowl. And how that confusion turned to unease. An inexplicable discomfort that had settled like lead weights deep in my limbs. 



I couldn't decipher it at the time, but there was something profoundly wrong with the way the stray had looked at me. Somehow, even though I could only make out its glowing eyes, I could tell it was off in some way. It was just the way it was acting, or lack thereof, at first. But then I started to notice the minor things.



Its eyes were so small, and had a larger distance between them than I had remembered. And it didn’t seem to be crouching under the bush, it would have needed to be leaning onto its hind legs to get its eyes up that high. It was if it wasn’t nestled under the plants, rather sticking its head through the bannister from the other side. Just looking at it made me nauseous.



I think it sensed that I clocked its sheer strangeness, because it moved.



Slowly, as if it were dragging itself with great effort, it slinked backwards off the porch, shifting silently on the earth behind it. Its gaze never left me as it did so, being the only way to tell it was completely out of view. Its blank neon eyes dissipated into the darkness. But I knew it had remained. It was just out of sight now.



Only when that stare broke from me could I regain motor function, walking slowly backwards on legs I barely remembered how to use. I reached a shaky hand for the door handle, almost tearing it off with how tightly and firmly I shoved it down. I quickly stumbled in and whipped around to lock the door. Not even the jitters in my extremities could deter me from double and triple checking that door was thoroughly unopenable from the outside. And then I roughly forced the curtains over the glass, as if that added some sort of extra protection.



I blocked it out at the time. But I definitely saw it staring at me again when I drew the curtains, this time peeking at me from over the porch steps.



I went to bed that night at war with myself, trying to rationalise what I had seen. That it was just a harmless animal that had wandered into our yard. But there's no arguing with fear. I didn't know what I had seen, but I knew that it made me afraid. You could call your fear as irrational as you'd like, that didn't make it go away. It stuck with you and fermented into a noxious, suffocating presence. Sometimes you get used to that presence, tolerating it out of nothing more than pure habit.



I couldn't stand the way those dark corners of my room looked at me while I tried to sleep. So I had to leave the lamp on, just to provide a sense of solace. Not that Pipsqueak needed any as she was already unconscious at the end of the bed, gently honking away. Admittedly it probably brought more comfort than the room being illuminated. 



And with that in mind I fell into an uneasy sleep, but fortunately, dreamless. Not any that I remember, anyway. Which on one hand I was grateful for, I don't want to know what my imagination would have in store for me in such a rattled state. But on the other hand, my brain never needed to bear the burden of concocting a horrific scenario for me. Not with what happened after I woke up a few hours later to an odd pressure on my leg.



My common sense was muffled when I first roused. I looked over my shoulder to find the source of the feeling. I spotted Pipsqueak straight away, the lamp across the room emphasising her silhouette. Her front paws were standing on my shin to stare over my body almost painfully. The fear didn't even get a chance to settle before it went away. And I almost laughed. I almost playfully swatted at her so she'd move. But instead, naturally, I turned to try and find whatever had her rapt attention. 



And then the fear came hurdling back with a mean bite.



My eyes met the bedroom door, and then the absolute darkness that laid behind. The light from my room blocked out anything and everything that could have been beyond the threshold of my doorframe. And yet, when I locked onto the five inch gap between door and wall I was overwhelmed with the devastating feeling of wanting to flee and having nowhere I could run to. Once again, my body knew long before I did that something was amiss, something that my brain struggled significantly to cope with.



Maybe it was simply just Pip and the way she was staring so intently into that void. Or maybe it was my brain picking up on things I didn't know it was capable of, something in the air I couldn't grasp consciously. Whichever it was didn't matter. All I knew was that when I looked into that hallway, I was supposed to be scared.



I knew something was there. And I knew it was looking back.



And after a moment of having that realisation stew in the air, the impromptu staring contest extending between us, it moved first.



A gentle creak rang out from the abyss, short, probably no more than two seconds long. More than enough to make me want to puke out all my organs so there wasn’t anything left for terror to tear at. Pip’s claws were digging into my flesh through all the fabric, but I couldn’t move no matter how much I wanted to. I was paralysed from my scalp and downwards. Head empty aside from flickering through my own fabrications of whatever stood outside. Each time with more teeth, claws and matted fur. We remained at that stalemate for a while, a minute that morphed into an eternity of hell I had never considered to exist. Then I heard something again, this time louder than before. And it wretched air from my frozen lungs.



I heard a brief scraping against the floorboards, and then a dreadful thunder as it clambered down the stairs in a clumsy manner. I heard it clipping its limbs on the wooden edges, sliding back and forth across them and rattling the bannister under the force of each awkward step it took. I wouldn’t begin to call its movements purposeful as it basically fell down the stairs, only propelled by the occasional purchase it managed to get as it scrabbled and writhed downwards. 



Then there was silence for a small moment, a scarily small moment. Right before the sound of our cat flap downstairs swinging back and forth. 



Pip moved about two seconds before I did, launching off the bed and shooting into the hallway. Her feet moved with confident thumps down the stairs, and I quickly followed while turning on every light that was in reach along the way. When we got to the kitchen I beelined to the cat flap and slid the lock across the bottom, kicking it with my foot to make sure it didn’t budge.



It was at this point that the slight paranoia I maintained over the previous few weeks devolved into a dreadful reality I couldn’t ignore. I checked all the doors and windows on our ground floor twice before retreating to my room. I ensured that I hit the latch on that too, one that had been practically untouched in years before. Not that I fell back asleep later that night, the whole incident left a haunting taste in my mouth. I just laid on my side, staring at the door for hours on end. I had expected it to open again at any second, and remained like that until the sun intruded through my window.



I saw my mother later, sitting at the kitchen table in plain view of the porch. The curtains I had yanked closed in panic what felt like eons ago were fully open to bask the room in warm rays. It sickened me. I stopped midway towards my mother, right between where the kitchen window ended and the backdoor began. I hesitated with my words, stumbling over them before they had even left my head. But I forced something out anyway, knowing they would never evolve into anything eloquent.



“Something came in through the cat flap last night. I heard it in the hallway, and it ran back out.” I babbled out dumbly, finding myself incapable of conveying the terror that I associated with the memory. I made it sound like a small little incident to be laughed about, and I was frustrated. Yet I still looked at my mother expectantly for an answer while not even knowing what type I wanted.



“Ah, I was wondering why it was locked.” She responded simply, looking at me over her mug of coffee as she took a gulp of it. As if she hadn’t a bother on her. It annoys me even now.



I don’t remember what exactly I said next, just a passive-aggressive comment about keeping all entrances locked from there on out. To which my mother agreed, in an extremely calm and nonchalant manner that only proceeded to further irritate me as I listened with vicious envy. I stood there for a second, mouth bobbing with things I wanted to say, things I should have said, before I turned around to leave. But then she spoke with words I had heard before and stopped me at the door. It was familiar, and I wanted to hear it again.



“What’s that?” I quickly shot back, not having been listening properly the first time around.



“I said I told you so. That you’d drag in more than just a cat.” She mused, almost smugly. She then focused back on her phone. Either completely oblivious to or revelling in my dissatisfaction. It was true. She had said that before. 



I only remember it vaguely, sometime right before the schedule between me and the stray had become so irregular. I gently closed the door behind me, leaving with limbs that took more effort to move than I wanted to admit.



School was longer than usual that day. And in all honesty, I was glad for it. I wasn’t exactly eager to go home. So much so, that when it ended I decided to skip out on the bus home. I instead accompanied some friends into town, none of which I had ever really hung out with outside school. But we were just close enough that they didn’t care, even if I could read the confusion on their faces. I walked after them, occasionally chiming in with my two cents when prodded but other than that I was glued to my own thoughts. Wondering what to do when I got home or when I had to toss in the towel and head to the bus stop. I was struck with the urge to relay last night’s events to the others, maybe grasping for some semblance of an explanation or answer. Or hell, maybe some advice. So when one of my mates, Theo,  asked me what I had been up to, I didn’t resist the impulse.



“Somethin’ weird happened to me last night." I started, as casually as I could. And the rest of my explanation was of a similar tone.



When I finished regaling, I was predictably met with a few laughs and grimaces. I explained it better this time, emphasising how oddly the way it tumbled down the stairs was. I got poked for some details here and there, but regardless, nothing noteworthy had really been said.



“Jaysus lad, the fecking Scrambler came after ya.” One of them jested, another round of laughs echoing through the street. I chuckled along, but once again found myself extremely discontent with the reactions I had been receiving. And while I was irked back then, I understand it a lot more now.



From an outside perspective, I was getting worked up over a harmless animal. They hadn’t seen the eyes peering from the darkest corners of our property nor had they heard the creaks and scrapes that accompanied every move the creature made. They hadn’t felt the stubborn unease that refused to dissolve in its presence. I knew it was more than just being shaken up, I knew this threat to be an absolute fact. Which made my continuous habit of brushing it off all the more infuriating to look back on.



Theo tried to poke at me for more details about the previous night but I deflected them. I didn’t want to think about it any longer, and decided to focus on the others. All now going on about their own cats.



I took the latest possible bus I could later that day, and spent the entire trip back home staring out the window in silence. I spotted something dead on the road. It was too mutilated and disfigured to make out what it was. But it was obvious that not just a car was to blame for its misfortune, whatever it may have been. I couldn’t stop myself from looking at it until the bus forced it out of view, and the image only further unsettled me.



I had decided on a strict set of rules by the time I got home. Simple but effective. I would continue to leave food out on the porch while it was still bright, but I wouldn’t be lingering anymore. I no longer wanted to be stood on that porch when I didn’t have to be. All windows and doors would be locked and double-checked by the time I was in bed. Most particularly, that goddamn cat flap. Whenever I could get away with it, I’d shut the curtains and blinds. Even during the day, which may have been overboard, but if it brought peace of mind I didn’t really care.



I stuck to it rather rigorously, more than I expected. It blended into my routine the following week, fit in snugly right alongside brushing my teeth and leaving out the cat food. And it brought a whole world of comfort. I still slept facing the door with my back to the window, but that was the worst of what remained from the night of ‘The Scrambler’. Of course, anyone with half a brain could tell you what I’ll say now.



You can’t block out your problems forever.



They’re tricky little things, always adapting and finding ways to worm their way back to you. Pests that can never quite get the hint, no matter how hard you kick or how loud you scream.



It was late at night, and I awoke for no immediately discernible reason. Not out of the ordinary as of recent, but I was on edge as the past incidents came to mind. I stared at my bedroom door, perfectly illuminated and securely latched closed. Nothing was going to get in. Only when I repeated that over and over in my head did I relax, and notice a lack of cat resting against my leg.



I rolled over to see if Pip was even on the bed, and she was. She sat up, her back facing me. I assumed her movement was what had woke me up, and I quietly called out to her. But she ignored me, and continued to ignore me even when I reached out and brushed my fingers against her fur. I stared at her, puzzled, and shifted up onto my elbow. Then I acknowledged the window she was most definitely staring through.



I could’ve passed out with the haunting feeling that curdled in my stomach. The kind of alarm that’s molded from the most potent of paranoia dragged from childhood to modern day and made into reality. The type of terror that was no longer confined to the mind. Not when your own cat was awake and staring it down for you. I could barely twitch my muscles, that's how obstinate my body’s reactions had become. But I had to know. I had to see.



Almost mechanically, I pushed myself up onto my knees. Trying to follow Pip’s line of sight. But it wasn’t going to be enough. There was only my own white reflection staring back, glossy eyes meeting glass ones. I breathed for a moment, sliding backwards off the bed to stand beside the light switch. My gaze never drifted from the window as I did so. My hand lifted up in a manner almost too quick and easy, like all bets with gravity were off. I felt around the switch, dragging my fingers up to the higher end of the pivot. And I lightly pressed down, just enough to allow the darkness to encase my room.



I couldn’t begin to precisely describe what I saw. But I remember with skin crawling accuracy the way all oxygen was robbed from my lungs, and the way my body pathetically slumped against the wall for support while my legs failed me. Last time, I saw too little. This time I had seen too much. It was looking at me.



It was standing on our shed. Perfectly upright like a person. But I knew better than that now.



It was skinny, thin in places I didn’t think possible. It’s a mystery that it was able to uphold such a human posture, its legs looked like it should crumble beneath its body faster than mine did in that moment. I could see its eyes locked onto me, neon, familiar and still entirely unwelcome. Its head had the shape of a peeled bat, skin wrapped tightly around skull and thin ears that pointed outwards like clock hands. Everything was too long, where its limbs started and ended was obscure. Something hung from under its mouth. I couldn’t see its face, or maybe just couldn’t make it out through my panicked haze. I had seen enough to justify my erratic heartbeat, and proceeded to swing my door open.



I scrambled into the hallway.



Only when the door slammed shut behind me could I breathe again. Every kind that ranged from desperate shuddering to greedy gulps, whatever I needed to bring my body back to a state of functionality. 



I sat there huddled on the dark hallway floor for the remainder of the night, dwelling over the hundreds of questions running through my head, none of which I had a single definitive answer for. I tried not to vomit whenever my mind conjured up the image, unable to stop myself from wondering if it had been watching me all week. Gawking at me and mocking my attempts to keep it at bay as it stared at my sleeping form. I shivered and curled in on myself tighter, feeling immensely disturbed by the idea and how probable it was.



Here’s the thing about even the mightiest of predators. They spend a lot of their time sizing up prey, weighing out the reward and comparing it to the risk. They carefully calculate whether or not a meal will be worth the effort and energy they expend hunting it down. All the while, some poor creature is unheeding to the danger that lurks until it’s far too late. At that moment, I got a pretty good sense of how it felt to be that unknowing creature. My mom found me asleep in the hallway the next day, neck killing me.



I think it’s the intelligence that scared me the most back then, as if the visage of it wasn’t enough to give anyone nightmares for weeks. But the way it stalked so easily out of sight and the rapidness in which it adapted its techniques was nothing I had ever seen before. I practically grew up watching Brave Wilderness and National Geographic. I knew animals more than most, and this thing defied all expectations I had ever set.



The way it stood in such a human manner made me wonder if it was possibly capable of opening doors. I was grateful I had been neurotically locking everything in sight recently, all of a sudden. As long as it remained out there while I remained inside, it’d be fine, wouldn’t it?



That is what I chose to believe.
