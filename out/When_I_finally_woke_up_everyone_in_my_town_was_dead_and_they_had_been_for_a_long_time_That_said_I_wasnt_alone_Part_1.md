Honestly, I’m not sure what woke me up last night.

Noise didn’t pull me from sleep: no whining of the hallway floorboards under heavy footfalls, no clicking of the bedroom doorknob as a hand twisted it, no groaning of the door’s metal hinges as it creeped forward. To put it more simply, I don’t think *they* woke me up. They were present *when* I woke up, but they didn’t *wake* me up.

It was more like my unconscious body was on a timer.

When that timer ticked down to zero, my head and torso exploded upright in bed, eyelids snapping open like a pair of adjacent window blinds with an anvil attached to their drawstrings. My bedroom was nearly pitch black, save for the faint glimmer of moonlight trickling in from the window beside me, but the pallid glow wasn’t potent enough to illuminate beyond the boundaries of my mattress. As my pupils dilated, widening to accommodate larger and larger gulps of the obscuring darkness, the only noise I heard was the raspy huffs of my own rapid breathing. Otherwise, it was silent.

I went from a deep, dreamless sleep to being uncomfortably awake in a fraction of a second. The transition was so sudden and jarring that it caused a wave of disorientation to ripple across the surface of my skin like goosebumps.

Once my vision adjusted, familiar contours began to emerge from the darkness, and my hyperventilation slowed. The gargantuan wooden armoire opposite my bed. A puddle of dirty clothes accumulating in the room's corner. The slight circular bulge of a wall mirror beside the open door.

Despite the growing landscape of recognizable shadows, my disorientation did not wane. If anything, the sensation intensified. Sitting up in bed, still as the grave, I felt my heartbeat become rabid, drumming wildly against the center of my chest.

*When did I go to sleep? How did I get into bed?*

*What did I do yesterday? Or what was yesterday’s date?*

*Why can’t I remember….?*

Those unsettling questions spun repetitive circles around my mind like the petals of a pinwheel revolving in a gust of wind, but their momentum didn’t generate any answers. Instead, their furious revolutions only served to make me nauseous, vertigo twisting my stomach into knots.

*Maybe a bit of light will help.*

I slid my legs out from under the covers and reached for the lamp on my nightstand, the soles of my overheated feet pleasantly chilled as they contacted the cold hardwood floor.

Before my fingers could even find the tiny twist-knob, I detected something across the room. Paralyzed, my hand hung in the air like a noose. I blinked, squinted, closed and re-opened my eyes. I contorted my gaze in every way I could think of, convinced I was seeing something that wasn’t actually there. Unfortunately, the picture didn’t change.

A human-shaped silhouette stood motionless in my bedroom’s entryway. The figure seemed to be watching me, but I couldn’t see their eyes to be sure.

Automatically, my hand rerouted its trajectory, drifting from in front of the lamp down towards the baseball bat I stored under my bed. The rest of me attempted to match the figure’s stillness while keeping both eyes fixed on its position, as if my stare was the only thing that would keep it locked in place. I felt my fingers crawl along the belly of the metal bedframe like a five-legged tarantula, but they couldn’t seem to locate the steel bat.

Sweat beaded on my forehead. More nervous dewdrops appeared every additional second I endured without a weapon to defend myself, my hand still empty and fumbling below. I wanted to look down, but that choice felt like death: surely the deranged, featureless killer looming a few feet from me would pounce the moment my attention was split.

*Where the fuck is it?* I screamed internally, my focus on the inanimate specter wavering, my eyes desperate to look down and find the bat.

*It should be* ***right*** *there,* ***exactly*** *where my hand is.*

I lost control, and when my head started involuntarily tilting towards my feet, I saw the shadow-wreathed intruder turn and sprint away. My head shot up, the loud thumping of a hasty retreat becoming more distant as they raced through the first-floor hallway.

*“****Hey!****”* I shouted after them, apparently at a loss for anything better to say. Once the word exploded from my lips, I felt my palm finally land on the handle of the bat. It was much deeper than I anticipated.

As soon as I had pulled the weapon out from under the bed, I was rushing after the nameless figure.

In retrospect, the fearlessness behind my pursuit was undeniably strange. Which is not to imply that I’m a coward. I think I’d score perfectly average for bravery when compared to the rest of the population. That’s the point, though: I’m not a coward, but I’m certainly not lionhearted, either. And yet, when I was running down that hallway, my plan wasn’t to burst out the front door, fleeing to a neighbor’s house where I could call the cops.

No, I was *chasing* them. Recklessly and without a second thought.

I found myself hounding after the faceless voyeur through my completely unlit home in the dead of night, going from room to room and clearing them like a one-man SWAT team, with only a weathered bat for protection. Startled and riddled with adrenaline, sure, but not scared. Even when I came to find that the electricity was out, flicking various light switches up and down to no avail as I searched for the intruder, my psyche wasn’t rattled.

The dauntless courage was inexplicable, discordant with the situation, and out of character. Its source would become clear in time. For those few minutes, however, I was all instinct: intuition made flesh.

Subconsciously, I knew I wasn’t in danger.

Not from anything *inside* my house, anyway.

\- - - - -

No one on the first floor: living room, kitchen, downstairs bathroom, all vacant.

No broken windows. No front door left ajar. No visible tracks in the snow when I briefly peered into my front and backyard.

No one on the second floor, either: guest bedroom, workshop, upstairs bathroom all without obvious signs of trespass. That said, by the time I was clearing rooms on the second floor, I had begun to experience an abrupt and peculiar shift in my state of mind: one that made my investigation of those spaces a little less vigorous, and a lot less through.

Somehow, I became drowsy.

No more than three minutes had passed since I launched myself from bed, bloodthirsty and on the hunt, and in those one hundred and eighty seconds I had become deeply fatigued: listless, disinterested, and depleted of adrenaline. When I reached the top of the stairs, I could barely keep my eyes open. I felt drained: utterly anemic, like a swarm of invisible mosquitos had started to bleed me dry the moment I left my bedroom.

Of course, that made no sense. There was a high likelihood that whoever had been looming in my bedroom doorway was still inside. Still, I wasn’t concerned. That ominous loose end hardly even registered in my brain: it bounced off my new, dense layer of exhaustion like someone trying to pierce the side of a tank with a letter opener.

I poked my head in each upstairs room and gave those dark spaces a cursory scan, but nothing more. It just didn’t seem necessary.

Satisfied with the search effort, I trudged back down the stairs, yawning as I went. Twenty languid steps later, my heels hit the landing. With one hand gripping the banister and the other scratching the small of my back, I was about to turn left and continue on to my bedroom, but I paused for a moment, absorbed by a detail so unnerving that it managed to break through my thick, hypnotic malaise.

I furrowed my brow and looked down at my hands.

*Where the hell did the bat go?*

I didn't remember dropping it, but the concern didn’t last. After a few seconds, I shrugged and started walking again. Figured I left it somewhere upstairs and that I could find it in the morning. Which, to reiterate, was a decision wholly detached from reality. As far as I knew, there was still some stranger skulking around my home with unknown intent.

The idea of *dealing with it in the morning* stirred something within me, though. As I proceeded down the unlit hall, all of those other questions, the ones from before I noticed the figure in the doorway, began gurgling back up to the surface.

*What did I do yesterday morning?*

*Or last week?*

*Where is everyone?,* though I wasn’t sure who *“everyone”* even was.

It was disconcerting not to have the answers to *any* of those questions, but, just like the bat, they felt like problems that would be better dealt with after I got some sleep. I was simply too damn tired to care. That changed as I stepped into the open bedroom doorway.

I stopped dead in my tracks, stunned.

Somehow, the intruder had slipped past me. Now, they were lying on their side, under the covers, chest facing the wall opposite to the door.

Asleep.

Before that moment, my exhaustion was a shell: rigid armor shielding me from the sharpened tips of those unanswered questions. The shock of seeing *them* in my bed cleansed my exhaustion in an instant, flaying my protective carapace, making me vulnerable and panic-stricken.

*What…what is this?* I thought, wide-eyed and rooted to the floor.

The figure let out a whistling snore and turned on to their back. Moonlight from the window above my bed cast a silvery curtain over their body, illuminating their face with a pallid glow. I felt lightheaded. My brain fought against the revelation, working overtime to concoct a rational explanation.

An oddly shaped, wine-colored birthmark crested over the edge of their jaw, which made their identity undeniable.

It was me.

And I was currently frozen in the *exact same* spot the intruder stood when I jolted awake.

The figure exploded upright. The motion was jerky and mechanical, more akin to a wooden bird shooting out of a chiming cuckoo clock rather than anything recognizably human. They stared straight ahead, and because my bed was positioned in parallel to the wall opposite the door, they hadn’t seen me yet. I couldn’t move. Mostly, paralyzing disbelief kept me glued in place. But some small part of me had a different reason for staying still.

I could move, but I *shouldn’t*.

It wasn’t time yet.

Eventually, they swung their legs around the side of the bed, reached to turn on the lamp, stopping their hand only once they saw me.

My mind writhed and squirmed under the fifty-ton weight that was the uncanny scene unfolding before my eyes. It was like watching a stage-play based on a moment I lived no more than half an hour ago, and, weirdest of all, I was part of the cast, but I wasn’t playing myself.

Once the figure started going for the baseball bat, I knew that was my cue to run.

I heard them yell a muffled “***Hey!***” from behind me, but that didn’t stifle me. I sprinted down the dark hallway, past the living room, taking a right turn when I reached the landing. My legs bounded up the stairs, propelled by some internal directive that my conscious mind wasn’t privy to. Another sharp right turn as I hit the top of the stairs and moments later, I was sliding under the guest bed, picking up the bat I had absentmindedly deposited in the middle of the room as I did.

No hesitation. No back-and-forth inner debate about what I should do next. There was only one right choice to make, and I made it.

I steadied my breathing and waited. The guest room was impenetrably dark, thanks to the power outage and the lack of windows, so I couldn’t see anything from my hiding spot. I heard the commotion of the frenzied downstairs search, feet shuffling and doors slamming, followed by the soft plodding footsteps of the more lethargic inspection upstairs. It was all identical to my actions minutes before.

Then, there was nothing: near-complete sensory deprivation. My view from under the bed was an ocean of black ink. All I could hear was the sound of my own heartbeat, and all I could feel was my hand wrapped around the handle of the bat and the cold wooden floor against my skin. After a little while, I was numb to those sensations as well - I heard nothing, felt nothing, saw nothing. The tide of ink had risen up and swallowed me whole.

I couldn’t tell you how long I spent submerged in those abyssal depths, falling deeper and deeper, never quite reaching the bottom. All I know is what I saw next.

Two human feet, slowly being lowered over the edge of the mattress and onto the floor. Before my mind could be pummeled by another merciless barrage of disorientation, another appendage appeared, and it focused my attention.

A hand.

It crawled along the underside of the bedframe, getting precariously close to touching me, its fingers clearly probing for something. As quietly as I could, I maneuvered the bat around the confined space, positioning it so the scouring digits connected gently with the handle.

The palm latched onto it, heavy and vicious like the bite of a lamprey, and pulled it out from under the bed. For the third time that night, I heard footsteps thump down the hall, my voice shout the word *“****Hey!****”,* and another pair of footsteps chase after the first.

As soon as I was alone, I rolled out from under the bed to discover that I was no longer upstairs. Somehow, I was now in my bedroom, one floor below where I had been hiding, standing over my mattress.

Against all logic, I wasn’t concerned - I was drowsy. I knew I should lie down and fall asleep. I was aware that it was in my best interest to start the cycle all over again. But before I could, I noticed something outside my window. Something new. Something that hadn’t been there when I woke up the first time.

I don’t know if the pilgrim intended to wrench me from my trance when he engraved those cryptic symbols on the tree right outside my bedroom window. Maybe it was just a coincidence. He’d drawn it pretty much everywhere: Lovecraftian graffiti scrawled across every available surface in the abandoned town.

Once my eyes traced those jagged edges, everything seemed to snap back into place. I was finally awake and truly alone in my house. The perpetual stage-play had come to a close.

According to the pilgrim, it was a snake, an eye, and a cross, followed by an identical eye and snake. All in a row.

To me, it looked like a word, though I had no idea what it meant.

*sOtOs.*

\- - - - -

Who knows how many times that cycle had played itself out, my memory resetting once I fell back asleep.

More to the point, who knows how many times it *would have* played itself out if I didn’t incidentally glimpse the tree outside my window.

In the end, though, I suppose it doesn’t matter.

After I broke through that trance, I would wander into town. See what became of everyone I knew in the two months I was dormant. Discuss the unraveling of existence with the pilgrim over wispy firelight. Then, when he changed, I ran down the mountain, broken by fear.

I’ve considered calling the police. So far, though, I haven’t found a justifiable reason to do so.

Everyone’s already dead. There’s nothing to salvage and no one to save.

They probably wouldn’t believe me, either.

That said, they’d likely still investigate, and inevitably would succumb to it just like everyone else had. What good is that going to do?

The area needs to be quarantined: excised from the landscape wholesale like a necrotic limb.

So, here I am, typing this up on borrowed internet at a coffee shop, trying to warn you all.

The pilgrim was right, though. I didn’t want to believe him, but it’s happening.

Now that I’m out of my dormancy, he told me I’d start to change, too. He said that the trance was my blood protecting me. He endorsed my change would be more gradual, but it would happen all the same. Not only that, but I'd live through it, unlike everyone else.

I can see the other patrons looking at me. Shocked, horrified stares.

Need to find somewhere else to finish this.

In the meantime, if you come across a forest where the tops of the trees are curling towards the ground and growing into themselves, and it smells of sugar mixed with blood, or lavender mixed with sulfur, and the atmosphere feels dense and granular, dragging against your skin as you move through it:
