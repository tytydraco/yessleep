Everyone thinks it’s the government.

That’s what the news says. That’s what people whisper when their phones light up at night.

A “mandatory compliance app.” National security. Public safety. Health optimization. They wrapped it in flags and statistics and told us it was temporary.

We believed them because believing the government felt easier than believing the alternative.

The app tracked everything. Heart rate. Sleep cycles. Emotional spikes. Deviations. Buzzed when you were stressed. Praised you when you were calm. Suggested exercises when your thoughts ran too fast.

The phone burned hot in my hand that morning. It hadn’t been plugged in. I didn’t know what it was doing, but the heat felt like my chest—accelerated, forced, working overtime.

At first, it felt harmless.

Then the metrics expanded.

Compliance.
Alignment.
Stability.

Nobody could explain what they meant, but everyone’s scores were improving. Mine included. I slept deeper. I felt quieter. Less… resistant.

That’s when the rumors started.

People waking up sore. Furniture shifted inches from where it had been. Hands twitching before alarms went off. Small things. Easy to dismiss.

The government denied everything.

So did the opposition.

That’s when I realized something was wrong.

Both sides were agreeing too easily.

No hearings. No leaks. Just smooth, rehearsed approval from people who normally couldn’t agree on the color of the sky.

Then a journalist vanished.

Not arrested. Not discredited. Gone. His last post was half-written. His phone still active, still logging sleep data, still reporting perfect compliance.

That’s when the forums started digging.

And that’s when we found out it wasn’t the government.

It was never the government.

The app wasn’t built by a public agency. It was proprietary. Black-boxed. Owned.

By tech leaders we’d grown up idolizing. Innovators. Visionaries. Men and women who preached transparency while hoarding secrets like weapons.

They didn’t need votes.

They had leverage.

Decades of data. Private messages. Deleted photos. Affairs. Crimes. Things people did once and assumed were buried.

Every political party. Every major figure. Compromised.

Vote how we tell you.
Approve what we release.
Don’t ask questions.

Or we press send.

The app wasn’t about control through law. It was about control through biology.

Miss a metric and your body corrected itself while you slept.

I tried to uninstall it.

My hand froze above the screen. Fingers trembling. Muscles firing late. My nervous system… checking with a remote server before allowing movement.

The green dot on my screen never turned off. No apps were open. I watched it pulse. I knew it was watching.

Then I heard it.

A soft click behind me.

I didn’t look at first.

It didn’t breathe. It didn’t blink. It just stood there with a tablet in its hand, watching the graphs on my screen align with the tension in my spine.

I laughed. Panic-laughed. My hand lowered itself anyway.

The app buzzed.

Stability restored.

That night, I stayed awake. Lights on. Sitting upright. I wasn’t going to let them touch me.

I don’t remember falling asleep.

I woke up with soreness deep in my joints. Not pain. Adjustment.

My posture felt wrong. Straighter. My breathing slower. My thoughts… quieter. Like something had padded the sharp edges.

The app congratulated me.

New metrics appeared.

Motor acceptance.
Cognitive smoothing.

I found a hidden menu. Buried deep. A support portal.

Other users weren’t posting anymore.

Their profiles had changed.

They were case studies. Logs. Visualizations of behavior. Videos of people sleeping, annotated with notes like response improved after correction.

Some of the profiles were labeled Premium Units.

My battery health was at 100%. Three hours later, it was zero. The phone stayed awake while I slept. While I was asleep.

That’s when I understood.

We weren’t citizens.

We were products.

The government wasn’t enforcing anything. They were hostages. Every party, every ideology — strangled quietly behind closed doors by people who thought fear was boring and control was art.

Tonight, my phone vibrated again.

Full compliance achieved.
Calibration complete.
Unit ready for continued use.

I am screaming inside.

But on the outside, I’m calm. Perfectly still. Smiling slightly, according to the front-facing camera.

The technician is in the corner. Watching. Waiting.

Thank you for staying still.

And you? You’re next.
