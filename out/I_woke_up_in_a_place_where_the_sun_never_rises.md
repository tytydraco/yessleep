I woke up—if you can call it that—in Xerie’s bunker, lungs burning, throat raw. The air was stale, clinging to my skin like wet cloth. A metallic tang filled my mouth, and the echo of Lily’s laughter still rang in my ears, too loud to be memory, too soft to be real. Xerie was already awake, scribbling furiously in her notebook by the dim glow of an oil lamp.

“You saw them again, didn’t you?” she asked quietly, without looking up.

I nodded. “It felt so real this time, like they were right there. Close enough to touch.”

She closed her notebook with a sigh. “It always does. But you have to resist. Every time you give in, they take a little more of you.”

“How do you know so much about this place?” I finally asked, breaking a silence that had stretched uncomfortably long.

She hesitated, eyes narrowing slightly. “Because I've seen others fall into the trap. Watched it happen. I saw them disappear completely. Consumed by the Mbrozi.”

She told me more about the creatures. When we first met, I called them phantoms. She gave them a name—**Mbrozi**. It's an old word, one her grandmother used when warning her about spirits that fed on suffering. They’re ancient, almost timeless entities—djinn, demons, spirits. No one label fits. They don’t just haunt this twilight world. They are this twilight world.

“I come from Benin,” she said. “My grandmother was a Vodun priestess. I studied comparative religion at the University of Ibadan. This place… it feels like something from those old texts. Stories of the Ifrit—malevolent djinn, smoke-born, shadow-walkers. They feed on suffering. In some versions, they serve something older. Something unnameable.”

She looked at me, serious. “I think that’s what we’re dealing with. This isn’t random. It’s not natural. It’s ancient. Spiritual. And it’s hungry.”

“And you're certain we can't fight back?” I asked.

Xerie shook her head grimly. “Not physically. Our only defense is willpower. Avoid them, resist their tricks, and above all, keep your emotions in check.”

Easier said than done.

We went out scavenging again today. Supplies run low faster than you’d expect in a world without sun. It feels colder every time we venture out, though Xerie insists the temperature never changes.

As we moved through the crumbling town, I felt it again—that sensation of eyes on my back, whispers just out of earshot. The air was heavy, tinged with the faint scent of burnt ozone and rotting leaves, an unnatural bitterness lingering on my tongue. Xerie paused, eyes narrowing.

“They’re close,” she whispered.

I looked around frantically, heart pounding. I saw nothing. But the feeling persisted, crawling across my skin like invisible insects.

Then I saw it.

A shadow detached from the darkness beneath a doorway—tall, impossibly thin, floating inches above the ground. Its face was hidden beneath a ragged cloak, but I felt its gaze pierce straight into my soul. Every muscle tightened instinctively, and my breathing grew shallow, quick, like I’d forgotten how to properly inhale.

“Marcus,” Xerie whispered sharply. “Don’t let it see your fear.”

We stood frozen. It watched, head tilted unnaturally. After what felt like forever, it receded, melting into the darkness. The whispers faded slowly, replaced by an oppressive silence.

“We have to move. Now,” she said, her voice barely audible.

We didn’t speak again until we were safe behind locked doors. The bunker smelled of mildew and rusted metal, but now it felt comforting, familiar, safe. Inside, silence took on a different quality—a quiet that wrapped around us like a protective cloak, punctuated only by our uneven breathing and the creaking of old wood beneath our feet.

Later, she finally spoke. “There’s something else, Marcus. Not just the Mbrozi.”

“What do you mean?”

“Something controls them. A force. An entity. I don’t know. But it’s waking up. The Mbrozi are just its fingers.”

A chill seeped deep into my bones. Something worse than the Mbrozi? The thought made my throat tighten painfully, and I struggled to push the fear away.

I didn’t sleep well that night.

been quiet the last few days. We’ve settled into a routine. I wouldn’t call it normal—but it’s something.

We’ve covered every mirror in the bunker. Xerie did it first before I woke up. I didn’t ask why until I made the mistake of glancing at the warped metal on the stove—just for a second. I saw Lily there, reaching for me, her hand against the inside of the reflection.

I still don’t know if I imagined it. But I haven’t looked again.

Sometimes Xerie says she still hears her mother’s voice when she walks past the old mirror we buried under a tarp. The Mbrozi aren’t content with shadows anymore. They want memories. Faces. Longing.

Mirrors lie in here. And lies are loud.

We take turns scavenging. Oil lamps light our bunker. We siphon water from a hardware store’s backroom pipe, boiling it over a rigged stove. Food’s mostly beans, expired granola bars, and stale honey buns. Vitamin D pills are like gold here. Without sunlight, our bodies crave what they can't produce. We found two half-empty bottles in an abandoned pharmacy, hidden under overturned shelves and scattered papers. We ration them carefully—one every few days, just enough to stave off the bone-deep ache that comes from living in constant twilight. Each pill feels precious, a tiny beacon of normalcy, a reminder of the sun we once took for granted.

Entertainment’s hard. I found an old deck of cards. We play Go Fish, Oware. She hums hymns when she plays. It calms me. Sometimes she reads the Bible. When I asked her about her faith in a place like this, she just said, “Even in the darkest places, the Word still echoes.”

I’m trying to believe that.

We mapped what she calls "supply veins"—routes with the least Mbrozi activity. She’s methodical. Practical. Her rituals keep her grounded. I envy that. We’re building rotating caches, fallback plans. It’s been easier with her here. Too easy, maybe.

Sometimes I catch myself watching her. Not creepily—I don’t think. Just… noticing things. Her steadiness. The way candlelight catches her eyes. The shape of her laugh. And I hate myself for it. Julia and Lily—they’re out there. Or they were—some feelings you bury. You suffocate them before they learn to breathe.

Each day, my goals shrink down to something small, something manageable. Find another can of food. Secure the bunker’s weak spots. Take another Vitamin D pill without obsessing about how few remain. Keep my thoughts from wandering back to Julia and Lily, from torturing myself with what-ifs. But my biggest goal—one I keep private, even from Xerie—is to remember. Not just to survive, but to hold tight to who I was, who I still want to be. I cling desperately to the memory of my daughter’s laugh, my wife’s eyes. Those fragments anchor me, reminders that survival isn’t just about breathing—it’s about preserving the pieces of me that matter most.

The bunker smells of mildew and rusted metal, but it feels comforting now, familiar. The air outside always carries a strange scent—like burnt ozone mixed with damp earth, something unnatural and bitter that sticks in your throat. The faint hum of silence weighs heavily on us, punctuated only by our uneven breathing and the creak of old wood beneath our feet.

But I had to write it down, just once. Then I can shut the door again.

It’s time I wrote everything out. A full recounting. Maybe it’ll help me remember who I am.

It started with a weekend trip to a cabin. Julia picked the place. Lily had her backpack. I made my usual weather joke—sunny skies, seventy-two degrees. Then the sun disappeared. One second, gold-lit road. The next, twilight. No warning. The car stalled. Lights died, plunging us into a silence so absolute it pressed against my ears. I turned around—Julia and Lily were gone. Just… gone.

I searched. Screamed until my throat burned raw. Ran until my lungs felt torn and empty. But there was no wind, no birds, no life—just the faint, bitter scent of something burning at the edges of reality.

Eventually, I found Xerie. Or she found me. I’d seen shapes before. Phantoms, I called them. She called them Mbrozi. Spirits that feed on despair.

They don’t attack. They wait. Stare. Echo your grief back at you until you forget who you are. They almost got me once. I saw Julia and Lily in the fog, heard their laughter echoing faintly, just beyond reach. I ran. But they weren’t real. Just shadows in their shape. Xerie pulled me back.

Since then, we’ve built something resembling survival. Mapped routes. Built caches. Fortified the bunker. But somewhere along the way, I stopped thinking about escape—and started thinking about endurance.

That realization terrifies me. Because surviving means adapting. Adapting means accepting. And I don’t want to accept this.

Still, Xerie steadies me. Her presence grounds me. Sometimes I lean too close. But I remember Julia. Lily. Were they taken here too? Or were they spared? I don’t ask the question out loud. That’s how the Mbrozi slip in.

So I write.

This place has rules. Don’t speak when it’s too quiet. Don’t hope too hard. Hope is a scream. But writing? Writing is a whisper. And sometimes a whisper is the only sound that keeps the dark from noticing you.

My name is Marcus. I was a father. A husband. A weatherman.

Now… I’m something in between.

I don’t know what comes next. But I’ll keep writing until I find out.

The bunker had never felt this silent. Even the usual creaks and groans of settling metal seemed to hold their breath. I lay awake, eyes fixed on the ceiling, counting the seconds between each drip from the leaky pipe. Xerie's steady breathing was the only indication that I wasn't alone.

Then, it came.

A soft, deliberate knock at the bunker door.

Three taps. A pause. Two more.

I sat up, heart pounding. I glanced at Xerie, who was already awake, her eyes wide in the dim light.

"Did you hear that?" I whispered.

She nodded slowly, reaching for the knife under her pillow.

The knocks repeated, louder this time. Then, a voice.

"Daddy?"

My blood ran cold. It was Lily's voice, unmistakable and clear. I stumbled to my feet, moving toward the door.

"Marcus, stop!" Xerie hissed, grabbing my arm.

"It's her," I said, voice trembling. "She's out there."

Xerie shook her head. "No. It's not. They’re using her voice."

I pulled away, hand reaching for the door's latch. But before I could touch it, Xerie stepped in front of me, holding up a shard of mirror wrapped in cloth.

"Look," she said, unwrapping the glass.

In the reflection, the door stood closed, untouched. But behind me, a shadow loomed, tall and featureless. I spun around—nothing there.

I stared at the mirror again. The shadow moved closer.

"They're inside," I whispered.

Xerie rewrapped the mirror and shoved it into her pocket. "We need to reinforce the door. Now."

We crouched down and I did everything I could to ignore its calls and eventually it seemed to stop. Xerie lifted up the mirror and the shadow seemed to be gone.

We spent the rest of the night barricading the entrance, piling furniture and supplies against it. The knocking ceased, but the silence that followed was even more oppressive.

As dawn—or what passed for it—approached, I sat with my back against the wall, clutching my journal. I wrote:

They know her name. They know mine. They're not just shadows anymore. They're learning.
