We didn’t have the luxury of staying in a motel for a couple of days this [time](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1afg2f7/only_the_dead_know_the_truth_about_the/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3): I could tell that the kids were burning out. I don’t blame them either, but we are so close to the truth. I strongly considered telling Caleb we weren’t coming back. I finally found my sister and we deserved some rest.   
  
But, after what happened at the clinic, I knew we needed answers. I was worried that we would accidentally stumble into one of these places and someone would get killed.   
  
\-

On the drive back to Greenridge High School, I made sure to stop and pick up a couple of pizzas and some snacks after getting us gas. I also didn’t let Hunter convince me to stop at the gas station and buy sushi again.   
  
Hannah and I talked a lot. Especially when we were at the motel.   
  
She told me that our parents took her to Clearview Clinic because she wasn’t sleeping well. Her nightmares were so intense that she was hurting herself in her sleep. My mother got a brochure for Clearview in the mail.   
  
Taylor said she fought tooth and nail not to have to go, but my dad forced her into the car. Once they got to the clinic, Taylor knew something was wrong right away. Two nurses escorted her into the hospital while my parents signed the paperwork.   
  
When I was there, no one was at the front desk. I was wondering if they were having a shared hallucination or something.   
  
She spent her first day in the hospital strapped to a bed and it was all downhill from there. Taylor told me that the nurses eventually let her go, and that’s when she met the doctor. He would spend hours chasing her around the first floor, and stop. It was like he was playing a twisted game with her.   
  
Eventually, she found the staircase and got stuck upstairs with the Whistler. She couldn’t find the staircase to leave. I hypothesize that it takes two to leave Clearview. We had to open the door together, after all.   
  
As I helped her dress her wounds she told me about the headaches she was having. They had been going on for months and they finally boiled over when she came face to face with the man who tried to kill her.   
  
I told her that I have them too, and so does Coraline. I filled her in on Kira, and how she used to have them but hasn’t had one since we brought her back. Taylor couldn’t believe that Caleb could bring people back from the dead.   
  
\-  
  
On the third and final day of our long drive, Hunter told me that he remembered the day he died.   
  
“I was coming out of art, and was grabbed as soon as the door closed.” He said while looking out of the window.   
  
“I didn’t have headaches or anything. I was just a normal dude.” Hunter sighed and rubbed his forehead.   
  
“It doesn’t matter. You don’t have to have headaches to be special and it was still wrong for you to be murdered.” I assured him as I drove.   
  
“You want to know what’s funny? My friend, Taylor, told me not to go to school that day. She said she had a weird feeling.” Hunter shrugged.   
  
Kira bounced up from the middle seat and took him by the shoulder.   
  
“You know Taylor?” Kira asked him.   
  
“I knew a few Taylors, I’m talking about Taylor Brown. We worked on the school paper for a while together.” Hunter said.   
  
\-  
  
“She was my best friend,” Kira told Hunter.   
  
“The smart chick that runs the yearbook? Yeah,’ she's pretty cool.” Coraline shrugged.   
  
“She helped me on more than one occasion,” Coraline mumbled.   
  
Hannah eventually joined the conversation, “I think everyone at our school at the time knew Taylor. She made sure the paper was interesting. She interviewed my whole class once after a science experiment went wrong.”   
  
I nearly slammed the brakes of the car.   
  
“You all knew this girl?” I asked, even though they just told me that they all knew her.   
  
I felt like such an idiot: All of the kids in the car went to school at the same time as Taylor. Taylor didn’t have a thread on the basement clues, she was still alive. Taylor was the connection between all of these kids.  
  
I slammed my hands on the steering wheel and told Hunter to pass me my phone so I could call Caleb.   
  
\-  
  
“Caleb! Taylor is the connection between all of the kids.” I told him once he finally answered the phone.   
  
“How are we just now finding out about this?” Caleb asked me.   
  
I told him that the kids were starting to get their memories back. We also discussed how all of the kids in my car had to have been in school at the same time to know who Taylor was.   
  
“You’ll never guess who I have in the car with me right now?” Caleb laughed.   
  
“No way,” I said.   
  
“Yup, I have both Taylor and Noah with me right now,” Caleb told me.   
  
“You have so much explaining to do!” I laughed into the phone.   
  
Once we hung up, I held my tongue for a moment. I couldn’t stop smiling though.   
  
Eventually, Kira poked me.   
  
“What’s wrong with your face?” Kira asked me with a squint.   
  
I told them what Caleb told me. The smiles on their faces were a true sight to see. I haven’t seen any of them this happy in weeks. I could tell they knew what this meant: With Taylor and Noah both alive, we could finally get some answers. They would also get to see an old friend again.   
\-  
  
I parked at a truck stop so we could all get some rest. By this time tomorrow, we would be back at Greenridge High School.   
  
“Cassandra?” Kira whispered to me.   
  
“Yeah?” I responded as softly as possible.   
  
“What happens when this is all over? Where are we going to go?” She asked me.   
  
This has been a point that has caused a lot of anxiety for everyone, myself included. Kira, Coraline, and Hunter had no one to go home to.   
  
“You guys will probably stay with me and Caleb at his house, or wherever we end up. If not me and Caleb, you’ll be staying with me.” I told Kira honestly.   
  
“Is Caleb going to bring anyone else back?” Kira asked me.   
  
I closed my eyes and thought about it. His house wasn’t that big but I was sure we could make it work.   
  
“That’s up to him, kiddo,” I said before letting myself fall asleep.   
  
\-  
  
As we drove up the street to Caleb's house, the car was dead silent. Both Hannah and Kira had horrible nightmares last night.   
  
I woke up early to make sure they felt safe enough to sleep. Coraline couldn’t fall asleep again, but Hunter slept through the same thing. I knew they would benefit from being in a house and having some space so I took us to Caleb’s as fast as possible.   
  
Once we got there, I parked the car and let them out.   
  
They each grabbed their backpacks and went inside. I took everything else and followed behind them.   
  
Caleb wasn’t home yet so I spent some time cleaning the place up. I also took the time to set up all of the evidence. Finally, I shot Caleb a text telling him to bring groceries.   
  
As I worked, I pondered the seriousness of the situation. It couldn’t have been a coincidence that we were all in the same place. Caleb found Noah and Taylor, the only two that didn’t have any threads in the basement.  
  
Caleb didn’t get here for another two hours but once he pulled into the driveway and stormed into the house, I knew that he had something else to share.   
  
\-  
  
“Caleb.” I smiled and threw my arms around him.   
  
Kira ran over and joined the hug. I’ll be honest, having another adult around already felt nice. I missed his company, and I could tell that Kira missed him too.   
  
“You guys can come in!” Caleb called to the front door.   
  
I moved my body away from Caleb and smiled at the man and the girl as they walked into the house. Kira came running over so fast, that I thought she was going to trip and take Taylor right out of the front door.   
  
\-  
  
We all sat in the living room together sharing stories. Apparently, Taylor was drawn to Noah. She found him at his home while she was being chased by a monster: A monster that they successfully killed after visiting a hotel.   
  
Noah filled us in on the box that was delivered to his front door. He had no idea who brought it to him but it had files for missing teenagers he was supposed to find. Searching for them is what brought Noah and Taylor to the Steadfast Hotel.   
  
I filled everyone in on Clearview Clinic. I told them about how it felt like the hallways were shifting and that Hannah and I had to work together to leave.   
  
The more we talked the more pieces began to fall into place.   
  
“So the Steadfast Hotel, Greenridge High School, and Clearview Clinic all must be the same in some way.” Taylor proposed as she got up to get another cup of hot chocolate.   
  
“I agree. All of the locations are places that don’t exist on any map. Hell, I couldn’t find any details on Greenridge High School anywhere. It’s like it was whipped from people's memories.” Caleb said.   
  
“We have to finish what we started at high school. So far, everything leads back to there.” I told the group as I rubbed my temples.   
  
I knew going back wasn’t going to be easy but I also knew that we had to be missing something. All roads took us back to Taylor and the high school.   
  
\-  
  
We all went to bed with one goal: We needed to go back to Greenridge and find the janitor. He was the only one who had given us any answers, even if they were cryptic.   
  
Noah told us that he wouldn’t be able to kill anything permanently without Taylor, but we all agreed it would be best to leave Taylor and the rest of the kids at home for now. If we ran into anything serious, we figured it would be best to have a smaller group.   
  
\-  
  
When we arrived at Greenridge High School the next day, something was off. The grass around the building was dead and withered, and the front doors were wide open.   
  
I watched Noah slide his gun into his pocket. Caleb and I just bought melee weapons, I felt underprepared next to Noah. But I was also thankful that we were all on the same team.   
  
As I stepped out of the car and the cold air hit my face, I clenched the baseball bat and turned to Caleb, “Are you ready?”   
  
“Yup.” Caleb sighed as the three of us walked to the front door.   
  
\-  
  
“You all found each other. You could’ve left this place alone.” The janitor said to us as he mopped the floor.   
  
“We need answers,” I told him honestly.   
  
“You’ve earned them.” The janitor smiled.   
  
He reached into his water bucket and I cringed a little. This man has been cleaning up dry blood and god knows what else for years, the thought of what could be festering in that bucket made my eyes twitch.   
  
The janitor brought a book out of the dirty water and handed it to me. It was bone dry. I slid my sleeve down and took the book, making sure to carefully place it in my backpack.   
  
“Greenridge High School was built on a Veil Line.” The janitor started as he dumped green soap into his mop bucket.   
  
“It was always going to be a place where the paranormal interacts with your world.” He said as he poured more soap on the floor and started mopping again.   
  
“What is a Veil Line?” Caleb asked.   
  
“You can think of them as a rip where paranormal entities can leak into your world. They’re extremely dangerous.” The janitor paused.   
  
“Everything that you see here is a result of the Veil Line. All of the murders, all of the killers, and especially the man who whistles. He put everything into motion.” The janitor said as he continued cleaning the floor.   
  
He told us that the killings started when a girl named Betty Young was bludgeoned to death by the guidance counselor. That same year, a boy named Lucas Reed was found dead in the school's basement.   
  
The killings had been escalating ever since.   
  
Each one of the killers was a different member of the staff here, but they were changed by the Man Who Whistles. The janitor said that the whistling man was not from our world, that he leaked in and quickly took control of the school.   
  
\-  
  
“Were the kids supposed to die?” I asked the janitor.   
  
“No, they were each hunted before their gifts could be fully activated. Everyone who died in this building would’ve had a gift. Like you and Caleb.” He frowned as he spoke.   
  
“Taylor was the one giving them headaches. But she didn’t know of course. She is Awakened after all.” The janitor smiled a little.   
  
I think he knew that I was going to ask another question because his hand shot up before I could get my words out.   
  
“It means that she can awaken Marked Ones, she also possesses a second ability.” The janitor said as Noah cut him off.   
  
“She can put down the monsters with me,” Noah said seriously.   
  
“Yes.” The janitor mumbled as he turned back to me. He looked older now, and extremely tired. Like this conversation was taking years off of his life.   
  
“Cassandra, you can speak with spirits. Regardless of whether they’re clinging to life or not. Caleb, you can pull these spirits out of the limbo they’re existing in. But be warned, every time you save a spirit, you are interfering with the plans of the One Who Whistles. You’re also causing a disturbance: It makes this place unstable.” The janitor warned us as he looked outside.   
  
“Who are you?” I asked him.   
  
“I am a Drifter. I am not from your world, Cassandra. My purpose is to guide you.” He paused. I watched as his skin slowly became translucent.   
  
“You must all make a choice. You can deactivate this place and shut it down for good. You will no longer hear The Calling. The spirits here will rest. To shut this place down for good, you must go to the heart of the building and kill the entity that exists there.”  The janitor said before fading away. His mop hit the floor as he disappeared, and we were all left standing there in silence.   
  
\-  
  
“We need Taylor,” I told Noah as I handed him the keys to my car.   
  
“Bring her back here. We are going to shut this place down.” I was serious. We had a chance to end this, but I wasn’t going to do it without helping as many spirits as possible.   
  
I knew that the janitor said we had to be careful when we brought people back from the dead. But, he also said that these kids were hunted. I wouldn’t be able to live with myself if we brought this place down without trying to save as many as we could.   
  
“What about you guys?” Noah asked as he took the keys.   
  
“We are going to save as many as possible,” Caleb said as he looked around the main entrance.   
  
“Don’t die,” Noah said as he gave us both a pat on our shoulders before rushing out of the front door.   
  
\-  
  
“Let’s clear the first floor,” I told Caleb as we started moving down the hallway that leads to the elective classrooms.   
  
As we walked down the hallway I called, “If anyone can hear me my name is Cassandra and we are here to help you. We don’t have a lot of time!”   
  
I thought it was weird that the halls were suddenly empty.   
  
Caleb and I opened every door, every classroom was cleaned. The janitor must’ve cleaned up before he disappeared. We checked the music room, the art room, and even the baking room and couldn’t find anything.   
  
“We have to check the gym. When I tried before I was chased out of the hallway.” Caleb told me as we walked towards that hallway.   
  
“Someone escaped out of the girl's locker room.” He said as we slowly walked down the hallway.   
  
With each step, the tension in my body grew tighter.   
  
As we walked past the boys’ locker room, we could hear a commotion. It sounded like someone was being thrown around the room. Caleb and I turned and rushed inside, we really should’ve come up with a plan first.   
  
“Holy shit.” Caleb spit out as we watched a young man’s head slam off of the doorway to the boy's bathroom. The killer shoved him inside of the bathroom and we followed, I recognized his jacket.   
  
“Jacob!” I screamed as I entered the bathroom.   
  
His head hit the bathroom sink, and the killer turned his attention towards me.   
  
“Run-!” Caleb screamed as the killer came charging after me.   
  
I took two steps back and watched the killer slowly go from being as clear as a ghost to full of color and life. He was different from the whistler, he had large shoulders and much bigger hands. His jacket had the word COACH written on the back.   
  
“Caleb! Get Jacob!” I snapped as the scene reset itself.   
  
Jacob was walking into the locker room. The killer was completely fixated on me.   
  
I turned around a locker as he reached for me, he was moving slower than I expected. He didn’t speak, or make any noise.  
  
Out of the corner of my eye, I could see Caleb trying to talk to Jacob, but his spirit was different. It didn’t have a color radiating off of it, and when Caleb reached out to grab him, his hand went right through Jacob's arm.   
  
“Cassandra, I can’t grab him,” Caleb screamed at me.   
  
I screamed at the killer, I screamed so hard I thought I was going to lose my voice. There was no bringing Jacob back if Caleb couldn’t grab him.   
  
\-  
  
As I backed up I kept screaming at the killer as he followed me. I had no idea why, I knew he wasn’t scared of me. I knew that I couldn’t kill him.   
  
My brother was going to be locked in an endless cycle of death until we shut the whole school down. It felt like my heart was being ripped out of my chest like my world was crashing down around me.   
  
Caleb grabbed my wrist and pulled me out of the locker room. He kept telling me that we had to focus, but I was only half listening to him. Until the killer came running out of the door.   
  
He was smiling, like this chase was fun to him. It was like he didn’t attack me right away because he wanted to chase after me. I turned my attention forward, Caleb led me right into the gym and we slid as we entered the room.   
  
\-  
  
We watched as the Red Mask killer slowly pulled his knife out of a boy's chest. It was slow and methodical. They were making eye contact. The killer plunged the knife into the boy’s chest over and over before turning his attention to us.   
  
The theory about this man staying in the auditorium was completely wrong.   
  
Caleb and I heard the coach coming up behind us so we went running further into the gym. As we did, the Red Masked killer rose to meet us. He slid the knife off of his pants to clean the blade.   
  
We could hear screaming coming from outside, and one of the double doors swung open. A girl came running through the door, she was promptly hit in the back with a baseball. When the man chasing her came bursting through the door, he slammed the baseball bat off of her leg.   
  
My blood went cold. Her scream was chilling.   
  
He brought the bat up to hit her again but I screamed, “Stop-!” As loud as I could.   
  
The killer turned his head to me and snickered. He pointed the baseball bat at me and I held my breath.   
  
“Caleb. Go get her.” I said before taking off and running down the gym.   
  
“Game On!” One of the killers, I am assuming the one with the baseball bat, screamed.   
  
\-  
  
There wasn’t anywhere to go in the gym, as soon as I reached the other side I spun around and clenched the baseball bat.   
  
My arms were shaking, I watched coach rush Caleb as he tried to reach the girl. The boy was already resetting, I just had to hold on until Caleb could grab them both.  
  
There is a different kind of terror in knowing that you’re outmatched in every way. The fear running through my body was nearly crippling.   
  
The Red Masked killer came running at me first, I ran in the other direction but had to maneuver around the Baseball Killer.   
  
I ran as fast as possible, but I wasn’t fast enough. The Baseball Killer easily ran into me: As our bodies collided I hit the floor, smacking the back of my head in the process.   
  
The moment my eyes opened his baseball bat was pressed to my neck. I tried to gasp, kick, and claw but it was no use. He leaned in close to my face, I could smell his breath. It smelt like rot and decay.   
  
“Your fear smells sublime.” He whispered to me as he put more pressure on my neck.   
  
My life was flashing before my eyes. All I could do was whimper.   
  
There is a special kind of terror in knowing that you are going to die, but not knowing what happens when you do.   
  
\-  
  
My vision started to blur and I stopped kicking my legs. As I shot my eyes I heard a gunshot, it sounded so loud in the gym.   
  
The Baseball Killer fell to the side and the pressure on my neck was released. I gasped for air and coughed loudly. Three more shots rang out. I could hear Taylor's voice, but I couldn’t see her.   
  
My whole body was shaking, I couldn’t breathe.   
  
Eventually, I planted my hand on the ground to turn over and gag, tears ran down my nose. I heard more gunshots around me. I tried to compose myself, but nothing was helping.   
  
I nearly had a heart attack when I felt a hand take my arm and pull me up. I gasped loudly and moved my arm up to grab the hand.   
  
“It’s me,” Caleb said softly.   
  
“We got them,” Noah said as he ran over.   
  
I took Caleb by the arm and leaned over to throw up. I wanted to stop shaking, I just wanted to take a second and breathe.   
  
\-  
  
“Did you get the kids?” I asked Caleb once I finally regained my composure.   
  
“I got them but they’re hurt pretty badly,” Caleb said as he helped me turn to face the new kids.   
  
The bodies of the Red Masked Killer and the Baseball Killer were on the floor. There was a black ooze around their bodies.   
  
“Taylor and I put those down,” Noah said as he motioned to the corpses.   
  
“They’re not going to come back either. I got them with my staff, and I can explain how I did it or we can just go.” Taylor said seriously. I could tell she was nervous.   
  
“The coach got away. He didn’t try to stop me from getting the kids.” Caleb said as he walked me to the gym door with the rest of the group behind us.   
  
We decided to leave through the gym door that led to the football field. It was going to be a longer walk to the parking lot but we couldn’t risk going through the lobby.   
  
\-  
  
I was still shaking when we got back in the car.   
  
We didn’t have a lot of time.   
  
The drive home was somber, no one spoke. I didn’t ask the kids their names, and Caleb didn’t play any music. Not even Taylor had anything to say. You could cut the tension in the car with a knife.   
  
As we dropped the kids off at Caleb's house we all took a second to breathe. I rolled the window down and let the air hit my face.   
  
I had one last showdown in me. We were going to put an end to the horrors at Greenridge High School, once and for all.
