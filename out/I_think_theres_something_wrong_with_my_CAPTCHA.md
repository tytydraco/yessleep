I don’t really know how to explain this without sounding like I’m exaggerating, but something incredibly weird has been happening with a CAPTCHA on a site I’ve used a hundred times before. I’m not even someone who gets freaked out easily. I’ve seen enough broken government websites to know that half the time the “glitch” is just because someone’s nephew coded it in 2008.

But this… this feels different. It feels intentional.

It started when I tried to log into my student tax portal last week. Everything loaded fine except the CAPTCHA box, which was just an empty white square. No prompt, no images, nothing. I thought maybe it failed to load, so I clicked refresh.

The box didn’t fill in.  
Instead, text appeared above it:

**“Select all images that belong to you.”**

I stared at it for a good ten seconds trying to figure out if that was even grammatically correct. There weren’t any images to select anyway, so I assumed it was a bug and closed the whole page. I didn’t think much of it, and honestly I was more annoyed than unsettled.

The second day, I tried logging in again. The prompt changed.

This time it said:

**“Prove that you are the correct user.”**

Still vague, still weird, but at least the grid appeared. Except the images were impossibly blurry, like someone had taken low-res screenshots of other low-res screenshots. Each tile showed something that looked almost familiar: maybe a street, or a ceiling, or a face, but distorted in the way dreams feel when they slip away, barely recognisable until the moment you try to focus on them.

When I hovered over the third tile, the blur sharpened just enough that I recognised my bookshelf. My exact shelf, with the crooked textbook I always pretend I’ll revisit and that I spent way too much money on. The photo had been taken from an angle I couldn’t place, as if someone had leaned in from the doorway while I wasn’t looking.

I didn’t even click. I closed the page, but the image lingered in my brain far longer than I wanted it to.

It escalated the next night.

My laptop was asleep. I was scrolling on my phone. Everything was normal until I heard my laptop’s fan quietly spin up. Not loud, but enough to know it had woken itself.

I didn’t touch it. I didn’t even go near it. Just stared at it for a good moment until suddenly—

It chimed with the notification sound I get when a webpage sends a prompt. I went to the laptop & opened it, out of curiosity.

The same CAPTCHA box was open. I hadn’t logged in. I hadn’t even opened the browser.

This time the prompt simply read:

**“Thank you. Verification in progress.”**

There was no grid.  
No images.  
Just that line. The words looked oddly centred, too precise for a normal CAPTCHA, as if someone had manually placed them there.

Then I noticed that my webcam’s light was turned on.

I froze. It wasn't even the usual “oh no someone’s spying on me,” because this was worse — I wasn’t even running anything. There was no meeting, no call, no app that should have access. The little green LED glowed steadily, like an eye opening.

I reached up and covered the camera with my hand.  
The text changed immediately:

**“Obstruction detected.”**

I didn't remove my hand. The light stayed on while I processed what was happening.

New text appeared:

**“Do not interfere. Process is almost complete.”**

And that was it. No explanation, no cancel option.  
Just those words glowing on the screen while the webcam light stared at me.

I shut the laptop so fast the hinge clicked. I didn’t open it again for the rest of the night.

Today, it followed me.

I switched to my phone because I genuinely didn’t trust the laptop anymore.  Threw it out almost immediately. I avoided the tax site completely. I didn’t sign in anywhere new. I even cleared my browser history like some kind of ritual cleansing.

Then, around noon, my phone froze for a moment.  
A white square appeared in the middle of the screen, covering up a portion of my wallpaper. It wasn’t from any app I recognised.

The outline of a 3×3 grid flickered faintly, like a watermark slowly bleeding through paper.

Then the text appeared:

**“Final verification needed.”**

I don’t think I even breathed.

The grid loaded without my input.

Nine images, perfectly clear this time.

They were all pictures of me. Photos taken from angles that suggested someone had been standing in my doorway, or next to my bed, or behind me while I studied. The lighting in some of them was the same dim yellow of my room at 3AM. In one, I was lying on my side, hair half across my face, clearly asleep.

Above the grid:

**“Confirm identity.”**

I didn’t touch anything. I locked the phone immediately, but I swear I could feel my own pulse in my fingers.

The worst part isn’t even the photos.  
It’s that the CAPTCHA is no longer asking me to prove I’m human.

Now it’s asking me to prove I’m *me*.

And I have this horrible, growing suspicion that it'll follow me on whichever device I use.

I haven't opened the phone again.  
I’m typing this on a computer in a library, before I forgo all my electronic devices to the second-hand market.

If you ever see a CAPTCHA asking you to identify yourself, I fear it's too late.
