I still couldn't really attend class, but I made sure to text mom and dad to tell them not to worry. I weighed the options of shutting off the other three phones, but decided to text my parents on each, telling them I would be going camping and out of service. I didn't understand what would happen if the other parents went too long without hearing from me. I didn't need the police showing up to discover the bodies piling up in my laundry room. 

Right. About the bodies in my laundry room. I was up to seven. I kinda tripped on my way into my apartment. Body four. Then I hit my head on the front table. Body five. Body six was when I tripped over body four, trying to step over it to quickly shut the door to hide the corpses. Slammed my head into the door. At least I didn't feel it for long. Body seven was when I tried carrying four through six, in one go, only to crumple like wet paper under my combined weight. Didn't break anything, other than my self esteem. I was still mildly disturbed by seeing my own dead bodies, let alone seven stacked up next to my dirty laundry. The intrusive thought to clone my favorite clothes did cross my mind. I shook that one off, shuddering a bit at how accepting I had grown of this situation.

After texting Dr Wisconsin to arrange a pickup for the bodies, I let her know I would be reaching out to the contacts she'd given me. Then I made good on that, starting with the first name and number. “Doctor Sawyer,” with a number you don't need to know, and quite frankly, don't want to know. Seriously, I hope no one ever has to go through this. This was just such a horrible experience. Sawyer picked up on the first ring, “Mr Brooks,” he asked, expectantly. “Uhhh, yeah?” I confirmed, unnerved at how he had guessed. “Glad I got it right. I've already answered five calls like that, this morning. Finally, don't have to keep that up” he sighed. Great. He's flipping insane too. “That's nice?” I grunted, unsure of what to say. “Anyways, um. Can I come get some tests done?”

An hour and a half later, I was on another school's campus, being guided by the eccentric Doctor Sawyer. He strolled through the labyrinthine corridors like a scientific Jack Sparrow, giving me the rundown on the various experiments underway behind each closed door. His intimate knowledge on what should have been much more sensitive information was anything but comforting. If one man knew so much about the ins and outs and goings on in each experiment, who else would know about what we were doing?

“And here is my room, let's get started,” Sawyer said, snapping his goggles onto his face and ushering me inside. A few minutes later, and the corpses began piling up. Drawing blood was not much of a challenge. The needle killed me, but Sawyer still drew plenty of blood. For good measure, he drew blood from me a second time, creating a second corpse in the process. I was handed a gas mask and informed of how unpleasant it may be. While the doctor evaluated the blood samples under his microscope, counted the plasma, and whatnot, he explained how he would slowly replace the air I breathed with carbon dioxide, in increasing volumes. A terrifying death may occur when the oxygen is too scarce for a body to breathe, yet you sow before you realize you've suffocated. Scary shit. Anyways, least painful yet absolutely most dreadful death I've experienced as of yet. About three to four minutes in, I suddenly sat beside myself, no longer in a gas mask. I did not interrupt Sawyer, as I did not exactly enjoy these tests, so a brief reprieve was entirely welcome.

Just then, something clapped my shoulder. Before I could yelp, a gloved hand covered my mouth. “Hey, you're immortal. Books, something er other?” A hushed whisper came to my ear. I nodded slowly, unsure what would come of this. Just then, Sawyer concluded his microscope evaluations with a loud clap. “Sam, get off of our guinea pi-I mean esteemed guest!” Sawyer ordered, shooing Sam by waving his hand. “Who the hell are you?!” I demanded, feeling somewhat betrayed at the extra set of eyes now seeing my affliction. “Just a lab assistant. I stayed late to grade homework in the supply closet. Slinked out when I heard a crashing sound. How'd ya pull off that whole stuntman thingy?” Sam pressed, sticking his face so close I could smell the orange tictac that undoubtedly stained his tongue.

“There was no stuntman, dear boy!” Sawyer cheered, clapping a hand on Sam's shoulder. “Sha-!” I desperately tried to shut up the scientist, but he continued unabated. “We have a seriously perplexing phenomenon on our hands! Every minute injury results in a corpse. It's our job to understand why, exactly, that is.” Sawyer happily blabbed, leaving me feeling betrayed and panicking as I saw my whole world crashing down around me. My secret had gotten out. It was no longer under my control. I held my breath as Sam digested what he just heard. A minute passed, then the two broke out in laughter. Hard, guttural laughter, from their bellies. I was at a loss. 

“The whole building knows, Mr. Brooks, relax.” Sawyer informed. I broke into a cold sweat, too overwhelmed to even begin to do the mental math on how to unfuck myself. There were far too many layers of fucked for me to unravel. “We've got far more sensitive and shady things going on, your situation barely made me bat an eye!” Sam laughed, slapping me on the back. And killing me. I couldn't help it. The sheer absurdity of my current life, the prank they played. I laughed too. Funnily enough, my corpse falling on Sam killed his laughter. Thanks, corpse!

“We brewed up some acids to help us dispose of the bodies, out of view from any camera. We were going to try and infuse your genetic makeup onto some mice and test whether or not your effective immortality is transferable, or not,” Sawyer explained, grabbing a scalpel while laying out some other surgical tools. “We don't think we can recreate your unique circumstance, as the lethality ceases all functions of life. Still, worth the testing,” Sam added, setting the corpse on the ground, as he pushed it off of him. I weakly muttered something along the lines of “you could've at least warned me.”

“Unfortunately not, Mr Brooks. We have just concluded that accelerated heart rate due to shock, does not activate your revival,” Sawyer scribbled something down, noting the discovery. “Was that really necessary?” I rolled my eyes. “Ya easily could've just jump scared me. Wait. You already did that!” I glared at Sam. Sam whistled in an innocent act, looking up at the ceiling. “Oh quit the act. You seemed quite willing to be a part of this ‘scientific’ experiment” I made air quotes around scientific. This really seemed like a slapped together string of whatever occurred to them, to test. “Hey wait. If everyone here knows, why aren't there more people all over me?”

“Feeling self important, are we?” Sawyer quipped. “I already stated how far worse tests are underway here, under this roof. Pretty sure the localized black hole downstairs has most of the researchers pretty captivated at the moment.”

My brows raised, alarmed yet slightly comforted at the outrageous suggestion.
