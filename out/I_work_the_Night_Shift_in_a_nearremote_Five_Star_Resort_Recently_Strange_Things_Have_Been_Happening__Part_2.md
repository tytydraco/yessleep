I work night shifts in a near-remote five-star resort. [Last week I made a post about strange occurrences at my resort.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1os2548/i_work_the_night_shift_in_a_nearremote_five_star/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) In that post, I’d said I hoped not to write another one. Well guess what.

Before I start with all the shit that’s gone on since then, I feel obliged to inform y’all what’s going right in my life. First of all, my girlfriend moved in with me. She doesn’t work in the same resort, but it's close. Secondly, my manager talked to me the other day about a promotion and a raise. Once again, I’d like to mention that the names of places and people in this post have been changed for privacy reasons. I am in an Asian country but I am not a native. The names you see here have been anglicised.

The night after I made the post was normal. I had my two days off after that, which were mostly occupied by trips to the immigration to sort some stuff with my visa, and getting the apartment ready for my girlfriend. When I came to work on the 12th, I really thought the weird stuff had stopped; I thought it was just my mind playing tricks.

Looking back I desperately wish I’d been right. 

12th of November 2025

The night started out as usual. I clocked in for work half an hour early, finished up the tedious reports and came out to take over for the afternoon shift. The occupancy was higher than last week, on account of a group staying at the hotel. It was some sort of staff party for an insurance company. Company parties are always a pain in the ass, the people won’t leave the lobby until late at night or early next morning – worst of all they would all be shitfaced. This one was especially bad, with some of them wandering around the hotel till sunrise. As is custom with such parties, we got several noise complaint calls from building 2, where the bulk of the group was staying. I volunteered to check it out, since the drunken laughter at the lobby was beginning to get on my nerves. After checking the complaint, I found out it was just an old couple who turned their TV volume to max because they could not hear it. They were nice about it though, turning the TV off as soon as they realised they’d been inconveniencing others. I wish more people were like that.

I was on the fourth floor when it happened. One second I was walking through the corridor, the next my foot failed to find hard flooring beneath it and sunk into the air. The momentum kept me going forward. My arms flailed to grasp at anything, but failed. I fell through what was just moments ago solid tile flooring. Before I could register the severity of the situation, my body slammed into the ground. My right arm broke the fall, and I heard a loud crack. A surge of sharp pain followed, and I let out a cry. I flipped myself so that I was laying on my back. My heart was pumping and adrenaline rushed through my body, but the pain stood out through that. My arm was bent in an odd direction. I laid there, clutching my arm.

After a good ten minutes, I found enough strength to sit up. My body was still aching from the fall, but my arm had taken the brunt of the force. I looked around to see a half-finished concrete flat where building 2 should have been. I glanced over to building one, where the lobby was and saw lights on the ground floor. I struggled to stand up, succeeding eventually, and slowly made my way to the lobby. The pain pierced through any thoughts or questions I had. When I reached the lobby, I found it empty. There was a couch set up in front of the front desk, and I headed towards it, and sat down.

As I made contact with the couch, the lighting in the lobby changed. I looked up to see Reggie, who was my partner for the night shift, staring at me.

“Are you sleepy or something, dude?” He asked. I nodded, and got up from the couch, the drunken celebrations from a group of men emanating from behind me. My focus went to my arm which was now fully healed. I tried moving it, waving it in front of me. I could not wrap my head around what had happened. I had vivid memories of falling and breaking my arm. The pain felt real. Almost too real. I pushed myself up with my right arm out of the couch. It was then I noticed a slight ache in my forearm, where my bone was supposedly broken a second ago. Reggie was still staring at me with confusion in his eyes. I scurried back to my post at the front desk. I tried to distract myself with work. When work ran out, I switched to podcasts. My girlfriend was coming the next day. A combination of the two helped me take my mind off of what had happened. Occasionally the memory of my pain would return, but I would bury it immediately. The night passed without much trouble.

13th of November 2025

I was quite tired starting the shift, as I had helped my girlfriend move in during the day and didn’t get much sleep. I clocked in earlier than usual, an hour before my work started, so that I could wrap up my job early and maybe take a nap in the back office afterwards. My plan worked, and at around 2 in the morning, after bribing Reggie by promising to cover one of his shifts the next week, I got to take a nap.

I think I had slept for around thirty minutes or so when I woke up. I opened my eyes to see complete darkness enveloping me. I was sitting on dirt, as opposed to the chair I had been in. I reached for my phone to check for the time but it just said  - -:- -  instead of showing the time. I turned on the flashlight on my phone to look around.

I was greeted with a dense array of trees and shrubbery, stretching up  into the darkness where the light from my torch could not reach. I realised I was leaning on a tree, and pushed myself up. I used my right hand, as compelled by habit, and an ache shot through my forearm reminding me of last night. I looked around with my torch and found a dirt path through the woods. Somewhat relieved to see a sign of civilization, I followed the path.  The forest enveloped me with the noises of cicadas and frogs, with each step I could hear the wet soil compressing and the leaves crunching. As I followed the path, I saw smoke rising from the distance. I sped up my pace and made my way towards the smoke. With each step the sounds of the forest receded, and the crackling of the fire took its place. After a few minutes I could hear voices chanting something. It sounded like the local language, but I could not make anything of it. As the fire came into view, I saw the source of the chant. A group of ten or so people stood around the fire, men and women. They were holding their hands up as if to receive something from the sky. The fire itself was partially covered by some shrubbery.

I moved closer to get a better look, and was shocked at what I saw. On top of the fire, tied to a pole, I saw a man. I stopped and stood there in shock. The man was still alive. He was writhing in the pain of being burned alive. The people around him kept chanting. Among them I noticed a man dressed in all black, with his face painted with black and red ink. His eyes were opened to an inhumane degree, and he was leading the chant. He danced around the fire inside the circle of men and women in a way I cannot find words to describe. I was frozen, my mind captivated by a mix of fear and passion. It was too late when I realised my flash was still turned on.

The man’s gaze shifted to me. He abruptly stopped and yelled. Soon enough, all eyes were on me. Not wanting to end up like the man over the fire, I ran. I ran through the same path I’d come from. I could hear footsteps and chanting behind me, growing closer and closer. I passed the tree I had woken up in and ran further down the path. Something flew by next to my ear and hit a tree in front of me. I ran as fast as I could, until I saw another light at the horizon. As I got closer, I noticed it was a village.

With each step the village moved closer and closer. I felt the chanting behind me slow down, then stop. The sounds of  footsteps also stopped as I reached the clearing in which the village was. I ran towards the first house I saw, but I failed to see the log that was laid down on the border of the village and the forest. I tripped and fell, landing face first into the dirt.

As I stood up, I saw the glaring ceiling light in the office staring at my face. “Dude, could you cover for me? I need to go to the bathroom.” I heard Reggie’s voice from behind me.

“Y-Yea sure.” I answered , and walked over to the front desk. The time was 03:13. I had been asleep for over an hour. A fact my body failed to reflect. I was sweating profusely, adrenaline rushing through my veins.

“You good man?” Reggie asked on his way out.

“Yea, I just had a nightmare.” I said. Reggie shrugged and walked out. 

I’m writing this post now at four in the morning. I have a raging headache as I type it out. I don't remember when it started, my brain's a mess. I know what I saw. I know how my body felt. I remember everything so vividly. It’s too clear and too detailed to chalk up to a nightmare or a hallucination. I need to keep this job, at least till I find another one. I can’t afford to quit now. And I don’t know if I want to come in for work tomorrow. I have no clue what the hell is going on. If you guys know anything, please contact me. I think I’ll ask my manager for a day off tomorrow.

  
UPDATE (21st November 2025): Things have been wild for the past week or so, but I believe the worst is behind me. I'll make a post when I'm ready to. Thank you for all your feedback and support.
