My name is Annibell and I am-or *was*\- a videographer. I did open commissions online. usually I got normal requests. Random videos plus the occasional short film. These were my favorite. The short films I mean. Not only were they fun, they payed well. That’s the main reason I was so eager when I got an odd request.  

A small group of people was making a mostly Improve short film. I found this interesting and messaged them back. we had a few calls and the director seemed nice. We got the where and when worked out, but I still wasn’t clear on the what. They hadn’t told my what it was being made for or if it would be made public. If this happens always-*always-*clear things up. I hadn’t worked on a short film in awhile and they offered a good sum of money, so I accepted without too many questions.

Around a month later, the set filming time, I packed up my equipment and headed towards the designated filming area. I got there a little early and saw some people setting up the last bits of the set. I briefly met the actors, and set up my camera for shot one. I wasn’t clear on exactly what they wanted me to do. I asked and was told to just film. no fancy angles, no cuts. I was just supposed to keep the camera rolling until they said to stop. I found this odd, but again, I needed the money. When instructed, I started filming. then I waited for a moment for the actors to start. Both people currently on screen stared at me in silence, until the woman spoke up.

”we can’t do this with you watching.” She said pointedly.

”*w-what?*” I asked, getting more confused.

”Can’t you start the camera and look away?” The man asked. “Our old camera guy always did.”

I wondered briefly what happened to the old one, started filming, and awkwardly turned around. I’ve stopped wondering, and I wish I didn’t know. Both actors stayed silent. 

”Can’t you walk away?” The woman questioned. “You can still hear us from there.”

I no longer thought this filming experience would be at all fun, but I didn't expect it to go the way it did. I still needed the money, so I sighed and walked away, very confused. I sat in another room for nearly the rest of the time. Mostly I just scrolled social media-a bad habit, but I can’t stop. After a long while I was called back to the set and told to stop the camera and send the footage to their editor. I followed their instructions quickly, and left the second I was done. Something had changed. I didn’t just think it had been an odd experience anymore. Something about that place gave me chills and I had to go.

when I got back to my apartment I thought for a while and realized what had offset me. The actors had looked different. Not completely different, but different. their faces had looked *off.* I just wanted to forget about it, but I was curious now. Later that day I watched the recording. I  didn’t sleep at all that night. Trust me, I tried. I deleted my social media account, stopped doing open commissions. I was able to get a job at a café. I thought it would help me keep my mind off of that film, but it didn’t. I can’t describe to you what was on that camera.

This is all I can say: The actors. They’re gone. I won’t give you their names, because someone might try to find them. That’s not a good idea. It might take you too.

 Every time I‘m happy I think about *them.* Those poor actors. And then I always decide I don't have the write to be happy. Not when I had been a part in creating that film. Not when more are still being made. 

I know they keep making them because I got a message. I don’t know how they got my number and I don’t want to know. the message was short and sweet. Only a couple sentences.

”Hello Annabelle! You did such a good job filming we decided to offer you another job, this time you can be an actor!”
