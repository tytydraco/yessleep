For my own sanity I needed to make another update. Joelaine and I have barricaded the room as best we can. We blocked the window but left a small gap. It’s wide enough that we can still see the yard. I’m sitting at the desk right now, which is bracing the door. It’s made from a heavy ebony wood that feels grainy to touch. My arm's hurt badly (I’ll explain why later on) so Joelaine did most of the work sliding it across the floor. The door is also locked, so I think anyone would have difficulty getting in that way. 

The people are actively trying to kill us now, that much I know. They’re not even bothering to wait for the cover of darkness at this point. I must have pissed them off by killing their pet in the basement yesterday. My uncle never responded to the text I sent for help. With the truck out of commission, he’s my only hope of getting out of here. I’m constantly on edge; I don't think I could sleep if I tried. I hate having to rely on someone so far away to save us. I don’t think I can get us out of here on my own. The date on my phone says it’s Monday. I’m so tired. It feels like we’ve been here longer than that.  If things had gone to plan we’d be leaving tomorrow. Edith was right, I miss him. If we were still together maybe this trip wouldn’t have even happened.   

I should start off where I left the previous post. The dripping sound from my ax was like a metronome as I climbed the basement stairs. The blood had soaked up to my wrists, and decorated the crevices of my skin. I was sick to my stomach. My concentration just on getting to the kitchen sink. I braced myself against it, under that cursed sign, and watched the clear water dilute with gore. 

Despite it all, I was feeling somewhat more in control of our situation. That thing in the basement was gone. One less thing for the three of us to worry about. After washing myself, and the blade I sat down on the stool for a moment to catch my breath. The place smelled of rats. That should be the least of my worries I realize to the point that it seems almost funny to mention. It was then that I made the text to my uncle Stan. I was as truthful as I could, while leaving out enough that I hoped he would actually take the situation seriously. I emphasized that my truck wasn’t going anywhere and we needed him to come get us as soon as possible. It was also then that I uploaded the previous post to Reddit. 

I decided to look for Edith. I had honestly expected her to be in the kitchen, helping herself to more of yesterday’s pancakes. I remembered the last time I talked to her she had wanted to put on her makeup. The logical place to look then was the bathroom at the end of the hall. 

I headed towards the door, double checking to make sure it was locked—not that it would have done us much good after the morning’s discovery. My plan was to barricade all the entrances before any of us slept. I had hoped Edith would help me with that. Heading through the common room I glanced down at the ax in my hand. I reasoned it might be best to lean it against the couch for a minute as I went to check the bathroom. Sort of an odd thing to go up and greet my sister with an ax. 

Turning down the corner I noticed both the wild pig and the bear pelts in the hall. They were ‘looking’ towards the bathroom. I instantly regretted my choice of leaving the ax in the other room (not for the last time). I repeated the theory I had created in my head over to comfort myself, that the animals could only move at night. There was an eerie feeling in the air as I continued. Even the pattering of mice was quiet this time. I gradually became aware of a gnawing sound. If you’ve ever bit into a hard apple you know what I heard. Only it was more damp, with a frequent cracking mixed in. Curiosity led me to push the door open, though I did so cautiously.  

I saw the fawn’s face first as the hinges turned. Its eyes were a milky white with grey streaks along the edges. It was being lurched back and forth violently as the wet squelching sound continued. Edith was crouched on the toilet seat like an animal, balancing on the tips of her toes. All down her chest was blood. It was pooled around her feet and dribbled down the toilet bowl. 

The limp fawn lay across my sister’s lap. She was gorging herself on it, chewing on its flesh with her little white teeth. 

“Edith?” I gasped. Her eyes looked insane as they flashed towards me. They were similar to the deer’s; however, her black pupils were still present. They were bulging though. She made no sound as the fawn dropped from her grasp. My eyes flashed to her long fingers gripping the edge of the seat. She looked like she was getting ready to pounce. 

I grabbed the door handle and tried to pull it shut, but she was quick. My sister lunged like a wild cat. Her fingers caught around my arm in a steel grip. “Edith, please,” I screamed at her. I pushed her face away from me. As I held her back some, part of me was scared to hurt her, even as the hunger in her eyes intensified. The muscles in her neck tensed as she bit down into the soft flesh of my arm. I screamed, shoving her again. Adrenaline rushed through me; there was more strength behind it this time. I managed to throw her off me and she tumbled. 

“Edith, I’m sorry.” The smear of fluid around her looked like tar. I made it a step towards her, but the smile she gave sent me running. She lunged at my angles as I sprinted but missed. I grabbed the ax as I headed upstairs. 

Reaching the summit I knocked rapidly on the door to my room. “Open up, Joelaine. It’s me, open the door.” She was hesitant to let me in, *of course she was.* I managed to convince Joelaine, just as the smiling face of Edith emerged from the stairwell. 

Pushing through the opening, I slammed the door behind me. As soon as I did, Edith’s voice began screaming from the other side. 

“Help, help,” she wailed, banging what may have been her skull against the door. “Joelaine. It’s me.” 

Joelaine was wide eyed, looking between me and the door. “We have to let her in,” she said, making a move towards it. 

“No!” I grabbed Joelaine and pulled her back. 

“I don’t understand what’s going on,” Joelaine's eyes were tearing up. “What if she’s in trouble, Bea? It’s our job to look after her…” 

“Azreal was right,” Edith said from outside. Her shouting had changed abruptly. Her voice now opted to a sweet little girl tone which sounded too young for a 15 year old. “You look like you really could use some sleep. Azreal was right. You look like you really could use some sleep. Azreal was right. You look like you really could use some sleep.” 

Joelaine sunk to the floor still staring at the door. “That isn’t our sister…” 

“It’s not.”  

“What happened to her?” 

“I don’t know,” I said, “it’s like she’s been possessed.” 

Joelaine covered her face with her hands. She was sobbing. I didn’t know what to say, my heart was beating so rapidly. It was hard to process what had just happened. I went to the window and peered down. There were figures, clearly moving around right outside on the lawn. Their boots were already making new trails in the tall grass. Though it was still light out, all of them carried torches. I waited to mention it to Joelaine, who was still crying uncontrollably into her hands. 

We both have bite marks now. Mine from Edith’s teeth, on my arm, and Joelaine’s on her leg from the thing in the basement. I wonder now if Edith had a bite mark I never saw, and if that’s what turned her. Maybe it works the same as zombies in older shows. I guess we’ll find out together. I’ll definitely be watching Joelaine more closely. We did our best to barricade the room before nightfall, as I mentioned. 

Joeline was lying passed out on the bed when I took a seat at the desk. As I neared the door I heard Edith whispering numbers, 2, 3, 17, 30. Then repeated them, enough times that they’ve begun to repeat themselves on their own in my head now. 

Edith fell quiet for some time. That changed at nightfall. “What’s all this blood?” came her voice suddenly. Joelaine instantly went pale. She sounded like herself. Somehow that was more horrifying than the previous girlish tone.  

Reaching over I put my hand on Joelaine's knee, trying to comfort her. 

“Bea,” Edith called to me, “I don’t know what’s going on. Open the door, please? You were right about everything; I knew you were. I don’t know why I said all that this morning. Why did I let those men into the house? Bea? Can you hear me?” 

It went quiet as there was a creak from downstairs. “Bea? Bea, please.” There was a heavy step. I heard it clear at the base of the stairs. 

“Move the desk!” Joelaine was on her feet. Her sweaty fingers clung onto the rim as she struggled to move it. “Help me, Beatrice!” 

I was hesitant to stand. We managed to pull the desk aside, just in time to hear a pounding of feet as something heavy charged up the stairs. The impact of it shook the room as it hit the wall near the door. It was followed by a shrill scream. There was a grunt before a sloping wet crunch, which sent shivers down my back. Joelaine made a sobbing yell of shock. I had to fight her to keep the door shut. Sounds of the violent struggle continued outside. The screaming continued until an abrupt end. Joelaine collapsed once more into tears. 

I don’t know what to do. I’ve been working it over in my mind for hours. If we had managed to open the door would it really have been my sister in those final moments?

Any advice would be appreciated.

Goodnight, 

Beatrice.
