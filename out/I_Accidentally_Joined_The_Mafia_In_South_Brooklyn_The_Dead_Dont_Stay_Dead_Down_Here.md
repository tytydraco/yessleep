I am here outside of Mino's at 4:45 the next morning. It is brick outside and I am blowing white clouds of breath underneath the streetlight long before I light my first cigarette of the day. I tuck my new winter coat tighter around my body, and stomp my booted feet on the concrete sidewalk to try and work some feeling back into them. My hand shakes uncontrollably as I try to hold the cigarette still to my mouth to take a drag off it. It's even more difficult to draw in a steady breath with my teeth chattering so hard the sound of them clattering together is nearly deafening in my head. 

I'm not entirely sure it's the cold that has me trembling so hard. Weather says there's a bad storm coming down from Canada, due to reach the city in a few days, a once in a century blizzard, and I can feel it, deep in my bones. 

Then again, that could be the overwhelming sense of dread that I've been feeling since I woke up this morning at exactly 3 AM.

I had a dream last night. 

I was sitting at the top of Deno's Wonder Wheel at Coney Island. The amusement park was dark, everything was, none of the city lights in the distance were visible. There was no sound of traffic, no police sirens. It was like the entire City of New York had disappeared. Coney Island was gone, too. Absolutely none of the void was lit up, just the ferris wheel glittering below me that I was somehow sitting at the top of, even though it was completely still, not rotating. I was wearing a black suit in the dream, with a black shirt and a black tie. 

I hadn't worn a suit since the days of attending mass with my *Nonna* and my PopPop every Saturday night and Sunday morning. I hadn't worn a black suit since the day they laid my mother and father in the ground right beside each other in matching caskets. 

In that weird way of dreams, some part of me knew it was the middle of winter when I had fallen asleep in my comfortable bed, but now, there was a pleasant summer breeze blowing through the empty, black void around me. I smelled… smoke. 

That was when I realized I wasn't alone in the booth. In this place where 8 million people had suddenly disappeared from existence, I wasn't alone in the darkness. 

I turned my head to the side, and stared into empty eye sockets. Somehow, though, I knew he was still watching me. His torn lips spread in a wide grin, showing raw gums with fresh, empty holes in them. There was a cigarette clenched between them, that was where the smoke was coming from. How he had even lit it with just the bloody stumps of his wrists was beyond me in that moment. 

"Antoni." I said, and my voice seemed to echo loudly into the void even though I could barely bring myself to whisper. 

He was naked, just like he'd been found in the river. I could see into the empty gaping hole in his abdomen where his intestines, stomach and liver used to be, the crests of his bare pelvis, and every now and again a puff of smoke seeped out through his exposed ribs, leaving the hanging end of his trachea as there were no lungs in his chest anymore to hold the smoke in. 

"*Dzień dobry, sąsiedzie.*" He said to me, *good morning, neighbor*, just like he said every day as we passed each other on the apartment stairs to the laundry in the basement. I didn't know how he was forming the words because inside of his mouth there was only the very root of his tongue wriggling around behind his lips. 

He gave a gurgling, wet laugh, and nudged me with his elbow like we were sharing an inside joke together. There was a hole in his bicep down to the bone. There used to be the tattoos of three coffins lined up there, a skull and crossbones underneath it, and the initials OOR and SOS, and I knew as I looked at the shiny white ends of his exposed clavicle and the bare ball-sockets of his shoulders, that there used to be an eight-pointed star tattooed on each side, and a pair of epaulettes above them, decorated with three skulls. 

His sternum rose and fell with each rattling, impossible breath, and I knew there used to be the tattoo of a rose there in the center of his chest.

I'd read an article once, when I was drunk and bored and a little overly curious about some of my new neighbors, on the 'language' of Russian prison tattoos. 

The rose on his chest meant he'd turned eighteen in prison, the skull and crossbones meant he'd been given a life sentence for three murders, what the coffins represented. 

OOR stood for *Osobo Opasnim Retsidivistom*, especially dangerous recidivists, the cream of the crop that was never going to see the light of day outside of prison walls again because of the heinous natures of their crimes. 

The SOS meant *Spasite Ot Syda*, save me from judgement. 

The stars, and the epaulettes, meant he had rank in the criminal world. It was probably how he had gotten out of a life sentence in a Russian prison in the first place.

"*Avtoritet.*" He said, beating the stump of his wrist against his chest with a hollow, echoing sound. And then,"*Obshchak*."

A Brigadier, the first meant, he'd run a crew for the *Pakhan*. The *Obshchak* meant he'd also been one of the Two Spies, the Security Group that worked beside the *Sovietnik*, the Support Group, to make sure nobody beneath them gained too much power in the Organization, the *rússkaya máfiya*, the Brotherhood, the *Bratva*.

"Brighton isn't going to sit down for this one. War is coming, little *bratok*. Be ready. You're a part of this now."

He took one last draw off his cigarette, and dipped his head to the side. For some reason I held my hand out to him, palm up. A drop of blood slithered out of his mouth and landed in the center of my cupped hand, and then he dipped his head further and put his cigarette out just over the Life Line on my palm. 

I woke with a gasp, my bedclothes soaked with sweat. I was freezing to death. The boiler in the subbasement must have been fucking up again, and only Antoni knew how to get it going when it went down. I could see my breath in the frigid air of my apartment and as I pushed myself upright in bed, my elbow buckled beneath me and I fell onto my back again. 

My hand hurt, it hurt like hell.

I reached to the side and turned on the lamp that sat on my Ikea nightstand. I held my hand up in front of my bleary eyes.

There, in the flesh of my palm, was a red, weeping hole. It had formed a blister and I'd popped it when I'd put pressure on my hand. It was the mark… of a cigarette burn.

I hear the jingling of a bell. I look up and see Jimmy unlocking the front door of the restaurant. It's still dark inside, but in the glow of the streetlight I can see he's wearing a pair of red silk pajama pants and no shirt. Across his right pectoral muscle I see the words *La Malavita* tattooed in a swirling cursive script, "the wretched life". The lean, cut lines of his abdomen are obscured behind an ace bandage that he's got wrapped around him. The hole in his stomach might be gone, but it's clear by the way the man holds himself that it still causes him pain. 

He looks tired, it's almost like there are lines in his face that weren't there yesterday. He doesn't say anything to me but waves me inside, and I enter behind him as he turns back into the restaurant. His hand sweeps again: he means for me to follow him. 

We head back into the second dining room. The two bodies of the Zabrowska brothers are still lying on the floor, but there's a bit less of them now than there was yesterday.  I can see the grooves left behind by molars in the picked clean bones of their arms and legs. 

I remember what Antoni had said to me in the dream, that the boys over in Brighton Beach weren't going to stand for what had happened to him and his brothers. 

The blood has congealed on the floor, and as I pass I see a fly has landed on one of the small one's open, staring eyes. His name had been Wojciech, if I remember correctly. That night at the sports bar a few months ago, watching a Poland vs Korea World Cup match on the TV while sharing a bottle of vodka with my new neighbors, seemed like it had happened in another lifetime. 

I hear another blow fly buzzing around inside of one of Misiu's empty eye sockets. His head is still exactly where it was yesterday, sitting, oddly enough, in the empty plate that was still on the table.

"Eh, don't worry about them." Jimmy says in a gravelly voice as he steps over Misiu's headless body and we track to the left, opposite of the kitchen door, opening a door printed with the sign *Employees Only*. 

"Clean up crew is coming in a few hours. Trash won't be here much longer. Nia'd help me out more but she'll be weak for a few days yet, and she can't eat that much in one sitting anyway. Meat's no good once it's not fresh."

There's a few more booths back here, a full bar to the left and a billiards table in the center of the room. I see an open door ahead of me with a massive, mahogany desk and some antique bookshelves glittering with tiny porcelain figurines of women in flowing old ballgowns. 

We head to the right now, opening a door that leads down a concrete stairwell. We pass down two flights of stairs into what must be the subbasement. There's an apartment down here, a neat little living room all done in shades of cream, and a stainless steel adorned kitchenette. I keep following him through another doorway. 

Bianchi, Nia, I guess, is sitting nude in the bed, silk sheets pooled around her hips. Her blonde hair is down, laying loose and curling around her bare shoulders. I carefully avert my eyes from her exposed breasts, but she makes no effort to hide herself from my gaze. She opens her arms to Jimmy, no more blood on her tiny hands now. He crawls stiffly across the bed on his hands and knees, stretching out on his stomach and laying his head in her lap. She releases a purring noise I can almost feel in my own chest, and begins petting Jimmy's head once more. He closes his eyes and sighs, a sound both exhausted and content, and tosses a hand out to me again. 

"Sit." 

There's an armchair there, with a tiny side table next to it. I seat myself, and see that there's a single sheet of paper with an expensive gold fountain pen laying on top of it. 

"Fill the rest of it out."

It's… a job application. Most of it has already been filled out with a typewriter. There's my full legal name, my address and apartment number, my social security and driver's license number, even my old Department of Corrections inmate number. Jesus Christ. 

My eyes slip down the page to what is still blank. *Emergency Contacts*, it says. 

"I'm gonna need the names and addresses of all your family members," Jimmy mumbles to me with his eyes closed. "And I wouldn't suggest you lie, I'll find out soon enough if you do, and I ain't got the energy nor the patience to deal with it today."

"Why?" Bursts out of my mouth, I sound like a panicked child, but… I already know the answer. 

"An insurance policy," Bianchi chirps to me. "Consider it a 'Non Compete Clause'. It ensures your loyalty to the *Famiglia*."

My hands are back to trembling again. I swallow hard and blink back the burning tears in my eyes that nearly completely obscure my vision as I begin printing my sister's name on the first blank on the page.

Nia sniffs the air, and then gives another rumbling purr. 

"Poor little *soldato*, how did you burn yourself this morning?"
