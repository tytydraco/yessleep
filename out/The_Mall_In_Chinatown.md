So recently, I was with my dad at the local Chinatown for some fun, and we had dinner at the food court at one of the malls there, After we ate, my dad decided to check out a nearby sports store a few blocks from the mall, so I decided to check out the rest of the mall, and see what it had to offer.

I went into one of the stores, and there was nothing I liked, so I came out of the store, suddenly, everything went dark, even that store, and nobody was there, except me. All of the stores were also now closed

I wandered around for a bit, using my phone as a light (It was so dark in there you could barely even see a thing, not to mention, it was night), when suddenly, I heard the sound of footsteps. Paranoid, I turned off my phone and hid in a corner, and a few minutes later, I stopped hearing them.

I got up, and still wandered around paranoid, when I turned a corner, I saw what those footsteps were coming from, with the light from my phone.

The thing making the footsteps was a rather tall man. He was wearing one of those traditional Chinese robes with flowers and dragons on it, and a menacing looking mask. The mask looked just like Green Goblin’s mask from the 2002 Spider-Man movie (the one with Tobey Maguire) only it was red instead of green and it had a Yin-Yang symbol on the forehead. The eyes on the mask also lit up bright yellow, allowing him to see in the dark. He was also carrying a replica Chinese knife, and he had some dark black gloves on.

The masked guy said something menacing in Chinese, and he started chasing me, while making strange noises and swinging the knife around. Eventually, I was able to outrun him, and I was able to hide behind one of the elevators.

About 10 minutes later, the mall speakers glitched, and they started playing a scary sounding lullaby. I actually recognized the lullaby, as it was from one of my brother’s toys from when he was a baby. 

Suddenly, the masked guy managed to find me, and I ran in terror. This time, I noticed that he didn’t have his knife, however he was a lot faster, and he managed to catch me. He attacked me several times, and gave me a few small scars. He also kept speaking in Chinese in a menacing tone. Thankfully, I managed to survive his wrath, and knocked him out by kicking him several times. I ran for about an hour, trying to avoid the masked guy while also trying to find a way to escape the mall, but all the front entrances were locked, so I tried the back exit.

Suddenly, the lullaby stopped, so it was just complete silence except for my footsteps.

That is when I noticed that the masked guy was healthy again, and I noticed his eyes, so I hid in a different corner. He left

Fortunately, some guy managed to leave the back exit unlocked, and I noticed the eyes of the masked guy in the distance as well, so I ecaped out of the mall as quick as possible, locking the masked guy in, and I rushed over to a nearby coffee store and I called my dad to come pick me up there, and he did. On the ride home, I told my dad what happened, and showed him the scars, thankfully, he believed me

I never saw that masked guy ever again thankfully
