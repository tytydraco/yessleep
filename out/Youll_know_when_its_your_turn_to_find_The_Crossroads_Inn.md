She was really gone.  
A six-year battle, one final breath, the planet kept spinning. As if she were nothing.

She was young, happy, engaged even. Her whole life ahead of her. Until the day she got the news, the day her life came to a standstill. A waiting game.

I swallowed my thoughts and pulled into the petrol station: I was almost empty. I filled the tank and went to pay, a laminated “out of order” sign was taped to the reader.  
The guy behind the counter barely looked at me. “ATM outside.”  
Great.  
I withdrew enough for the petrol and some extra just in case, my destination was the small village we grew up in - I wasn’t sure how useful my card would be there anyway. I paid in silence and returned to my car.

Tomorrow was my sister's funeral; it was all I’d thought about since the day was set. It wasn’t especially far but I’d booked a hotel nearby to spend the night anyway. I’d barely slept the past few days and thought a proper night's rest somewhere nicer than my home would do me good. I reached into my pocket and pulled out a creased photo. My sister and I, before the diagnosis. We had been on holiday in Italy. It was one of the last times I’d seen her smile and mean it. She was beautiful - golden hair twinkled in the sunlight, ocean blue eyes that truly brightened a room. She wore a white summer dress and an ankle bracelet. I traced the photo with my fingers, delicately, as though too much pressure would make it turn to ash. I folded it back up and started the car.

A couple of hours later and I was about to exit the motorway, the lack of sleep was catching up to me, all I could think about were the *'what if’s'*. I turned the radio up, hoping to drown out my thoughts. It didn’t work.

*“Police have officially suspended the search…”*

What if they’d caught it earlier?

*“...the three victims all shared…”*

What if I’d been able to afford better treatment?

*“...lake remains a point of interest…”*

What if I could’ve done more?

*“...no signs of a struggle…”*

What if it were me instead? I wish it had been.

I turned the radio off as I reached the small village. silence so loud I could drown in it.  
The hotel was only a few minutes away now. I needed to rest, to stop thinking, everything to just stop for a moment. A growing pain was forming in my left temple and an uneasiness washed over me. Could I even do this? I could turn around and go home. I checked my phone: 8:30 pm. No messages. I could barely think straight anymore. No. That was a stupid idea. I had to do this.

I pulled into the car park and stepped outside. The winter air was sharp and unforgiving; it hit my face immediately as my eyes began to water. I shoved my hands in my pockets and buried my face in my coat, hurrying to the door. The sudden drop in temperature had turned the growing pain in my head into a heavy, dull throb; I just needed to get inside, get my room key and everything would be okay for a while.

Everything was a blur, had been a blur. I hardly even remembered getting here. Just one foot in front of the other. I felt like a ghost, like time had stopped the moment she took her last breath. Time \*had\* passed, but I was still stuck in that hospital room. Frozen in a memory.

As I pushed open the doors to the lobby, I was hit with the smell of perfume and wine, the sound of music and laughter from down the hall began to fill my ears. To my left was a door, slightly ajar and a small table with a glittery “welcome” sign. Curious, I took a few steps forward and peered through the gap, barely making out the people dancing and enjoying themselves. 

Maybe I stood there a second or two too long.

“Are you here for the wedding? I just need your name and I’ll find you on the guest list.”

I looked back down the hall. This was the best day of their lives. I was plagued with guilt and resentment. I should’ve been happy for them. But I wasn’t. I couldn’t be. All I saw was the life my sister could’ve had, should’ve had. A life that was ripped from her grasp. She deserved happiness more than anyone, but life dealt her someone else's cards. I hated that my grief was being projected onto them, they were strangers. I began to feel out of place. I didn’t belong here.

“Are you? Here for the wedding?”

The receptionist's cheerful voice snapped me back,

“...Wedding?” My throat went dry and I buried my face further into my coat “No.”

His smile slipped slightly, “Ah. You do have a reservation, though, right? We do require guests to book in advance. Most of the rooms were booked by the wedding party, but I do see a couple of other bookings.”

I’d booked my room two weeks ago, in fact it was the last room available for the next week. Chances were, my room would be next to someone in that hall. Walls are thin in places like these. I couldn’t spend the night hearing echoes of their joy.

“No.” I blurted out before I even had a chance to process what I said.

“Ma’am. As I said, we do require guests to book in advance,” he looked at me for a moment, really looked at me. I was a dark stain on this place, infecting it with my misery. I swear he could see right through me, “Even if I wanted to help, we have no rooms available tonight… but I think there’s an inn, not too far from here. It’s hardly what you’d call nice, but they always have rooms and they don’t require reservations.”

He wrote general directions on a napkin and handed it to me before turning away, signalling that was all the help he was able, or willing to provide.

Was I really that pathetic? That weak? How could I let someone else, a stranger, do that to me? I clenched my fists. Was I really walking away from a room I had booked and paid for just because I couldn’t stand to see people so happy when I was going through something so terrible? 

I was.

God. 

I sat in my car for what felt like hours. I could go back; I did have a reservation.  
I sighed, they probably thought I was crazy. I definitely acted that way. That receptionist didn’t ‘see me’- he just wanted me gone. I didn’t blame him. 

I looked down at the now crumpled napkin. I didn’t need something *nice* at this point, just a bed.  
Anxiety was beginning to get the better of me. I had just put myself in such a ridiculous situation. I wanted to melt away. I breathed in deep and began to hum a simple melody, something my sister had made up when we were little - a song she would hum whenever I cried. It helped a little.  
I fixed my posture and put the closest address I knew into the satnav, it would only take ten minutes - I could keep myself together for ten minutes.

The inn was further out, closer to the motorway I’d come from than the village. It was situated near farmland, a wooden, chipped sign not-quite-welcomed me, ‘The Crossroads Inn’ it said in paint so faded it was hardly legible. It was the only place in the area I could see so I assumed it was right.  
The journey took around 8 minutes, thanks to the lack of traffic. It had felt strange watching the streetlights become more sparse until they disappeared entirely and the road transitioning into something narrower and neglected, like I was driving to another world.  
The building itself was ancient. Updated to have modern features like electricity but there was no denying its history. I wondered just how many lost or defeated people had wound up here. The only glimmer of something once beautiful was a nearby lake, almost hidden in the trees if not for the fact it was almost illuminated by the moonlight.

I stood still for a moment, for the first time in so long, I looked up to the sky. The stillness of the air was almost jarring. I expected a starlit night - light pollution was so low here, one of the few things I’d genuinely missed about home.

We… my sister and I, that is, spent countless nights staring up at this sky together as children, ‘discovering’ constellations and stars, wondering what was up there,  just out of reach.

I was met with an inky black void, devoid of light. Devoid of hope. Barren. It was alluring, in a way.

There were no clouds, not even the sound of a distant cricket.

Just a vacuum of nothingness, as though every star, every planet had been erased, stolen.  
Empty and silent. A blank canvas, only the moon, full and low - a sole survivor.

My eyes drifted back towards the lake, the ethereal glow of moonlight danced across the unnaturally still water, hauntingly beautiful like a siren's call. I felt as though, maybe, I was finally waking up.

I averted my attention back to the building in front of me, a soft yellow light leaked out the ground-floor windows. From a distance, it had a sort of charm about it - it was clear the owners had kept most of the original features. But as I stood before it, it became increasingly obvious it was falling apart. Blighted ivy covered the exterior walls, choking them, claiming the inn as its own. Windows were caked in years of dirt and dust, and a thick tarp covered a section of the roof, weighed down with large stones, maybe the same stones as those at the edge of the lake. I wondered if perhaps this was a result of dwindling business, maybe the owners had simply ceased to care about maintenance… or both, had they reached a point where what must have been constant repairs eventually stopped being worth the time and effort? Sometimes, fixing something that keeps breaking time and time again becomes meaningless.

I reached for the handle; the metal was cold and uninviting against my fingertips. As I pushed the door open, the wood scraped and dragged against the uneven flooring and the rusted hinges screeched. The violating mixture of sounds made me clench my jaw as I made my way inside. Nobody was behind the bar, so I took a seat on a stool that creaked and groaned as I sat and began to wait. I looked around, taking everything in. The walls were cluttered with old watercolour paintings of the village. I remembered it as being quaint and homely, but these paintings… something was slightly off, I couldn’t tell exactly what, but it made me uncomfortable. I shifted in my seat and scanned the room for something else to focus on. Near the back of the room was a traditional fireplace with an impressive, ornate mantle. Grey ash piled high and spilt over onto the floor, keeping the flames low and weak. Hardly comforting.

I’d expected to be the only person here, the inn wasn’t exactly inviting or super easy to spot without knowing the location prior, but next to the fireplace sat an older couple with a black dog lying at their feet. They looked normal enough, though I couldn’t help but feel weary. They didn’t just notice my presence; they watched me. Their eyes were fixed on me. Calm and expectant. I locked eyes with them, just for a moment. Their expression was impossible to read. I had to focus to pull my eyes away, almost as though if we kept eye contact for a second longer, I might not ever look away.

I was painfully aware of my own presence. I wanted to just get up and leave. I didn’t. It was late enough that I would struggle to find somewhere else to go. I took my phone out of my pocket. I could call someone, my parents would probably be asleep by now, but it was still worth trying. Zero bars, 6% battery. I had pretty much expected that.

Before I could decide what to do, a door opened behind the bar that I hadn’t noticed before. A tall woman walked out, probably mid 40s, she didn’t look at me - just poured herself a drink. I could still feel the couple's eyes fixed on me, waiting. Like they’d been expecting this, anticipating my arrival.

“You’re here for a room?” She asked, though it didn’t feel like a question. She still hadn’t looked at me, just stared at her glass without drinking. Her voice was soft, calming, but her tone was dry.  

“...Yes,” I replied, to utter more than that one word required energy I no longer possessed. I just wanted this night to end.

“£45 per night.” She opened the till and waited.

I pulled out my wallet and emptied it onto the bar, one twenty pound note… one ten… one five…three…

She grabbed the money and shoved it into the till, closing it with a loud clank. I knew I didn’t have enough. Maybe she took pity on me? She glanced up at me, barely, sliding a heavy, brass key over to me. I took the key and she smiled slightly, a gentle smile. Though, it didn’t quite reach her eyes.

“One night. Up the stairs, second room on your right.” She spoke as though she were reading a script. I took the key and began to stand. “Did you want a drink?”

I glanced over to the bottles behind her, they were dusty and the liquid inside was dark and murky - almost syrup-like in texture. I shook my head and walked towards the stairs. I glanced behind me, the couple and the innkeeper were watching me, their eyes tracking my movement. My body shivered involuntarily.

I arrived at my room and stepped inside, throwing my shoes and coat onto the floor. It was cramped and sad. The walls were covered with a sickly yellow wallpaper, peeling and ripped. I could see the damp and smell the mould, someone had sprayed perfume in a failed attempt to mask the smell - instead, the scents mixed, creating what could only be described as ‘sweet rot’. The bed was a single with a metal frame, painted black and chipped with time. I sat down, the mattress felt solid, the pillows flat. There was no duvet, but a thick, handmade patchwork blanket that itched and scratched at my skin. The bedside table had a small tray with an old-fashioned kettle - the base coated with a thin layer of limescale, two dirty glasses, several tea bags and a few small packets of biscuits - several months out of date.

Next to the tiny window was a laminated piece of paper, stuck to the wall with Blu-Tack.

In bold letters, it read ‘**Notice to guests**’ and in smaller print below, *‘Please follow these guidelines: 1. All doors to enter/exit are locked and service ends at 10 pm for our security and safety. Be advised that if you are outside the inn after hours, there will be no one to let you back in. 2. There are no individual facilities; please use the public bathrooms downstairs. 3. Entry to the cellar is forbidden, these are our personal living quarters, we expect you to be mindful of our (and our other guests') personal spaces. 4. Guests should vacate their room by 10 am. Violations of these guidelines may result in fines and/or bans from our establishment. Enjoy your stay.’*

Sure. that made sense for the most part. The curfew felt odd, but it wasn’t as though this was some fancy hotel with key cards or whatever - it was either locked for everyone or open for everyone. I checked my phone: 10:32 pm. 5%. One flickering bar. No messages.

My head still throbbed and the sweet rot smell was settling into my lungs - maybe fresh air would help? I took a deep breath and stood up, walking towards the window. A sharp pain radiated from my foot. I’d stepped on something, something metal and round. I picked it up and held it close to my face. A ring. It looked… familiar. I turned it over in my hands, inspecting it. It looked just like it, just like her engagement ring. White gold with a centrepiece diamond decorated with two rubies on either side. The only difference was the chip in the side of the diamond, my sister treasured her ring - she would never allow any harm to come to it. Or take it off.

I was so lost in thought that the sudden sound of the groaning pipes coming from down the hall startled me. The sound wasn’t just normal old-building-noises but something that almost mimicked a song. The same song my sister would calm me with when I scraped my knee or ran to her room to escape the ‘monster’ under my bed. I didn’t understand. None of this made any sense. The pipes continued to groan, a low, distorted vibrating sound, slightly louder now. 

I wanted to leave, I’d figure something else out. I couldn’t sit here and listen to this, to let such a warm memory be twisted and warped into a mockery of her. I grabbed my things and checked my phone one last time: 10:52 pm. 5%. No bars. No messages.

As a made my way out, I couldn’t help but listen as the methodical melody penetrated my mind. There it was, the door out. It was open. Not just unlocked but open, just a crack. I slowed my pace, taking a moment to question it. The main doors were supposed to be locked, it was past the 10 pm cut-off time. Why was I questioning that? I wanted to leave, didn’t I? Well, there was the exit, right in front of me. 

Footsteps. Soft and delicate. The pipes silenced instantly.

I held my breath and turned around slowly. Was the innkeeper coming to lock the door? The old couple, maybe? About to complain about the racket I’d made? No… 

Golden hair, white summer dress, ankle bracelet. She didn’t look at me. Didn’t even acknowledge my presence. As though I wasn’t there. I could’ve been a ghost. She just continued walking, stopped behind the bar, opened the door and descended a set of stairs that must’ve led to the cellar. I called out to her. No answer.

I didn’t think, didn’t question - just followed. My body moved on its own. The floor creaked as I walked, my footsteps echoing against the walls - hers were now silent.

The staircase seemed to stretch on forever - and every step I took, she got further and further away. I quickened my pace, almost falling as I went. I reached out to her, desperate, but she was gone. I’d reached the bottom of the stairs, the living quarters of the innkeeper. I wasn’t met with a furnished living room; I paused, taking in my surroundings. A large, cold room, empty except for an elegant banquet table. Silverware, plates, bowls and glasses decorated the table - yet there was no food or drink in sight. 

Five people sat at the table; six chairs remained empty. The barmaid, the elderly couple, a young boy and at the head of the table - an old man. They watched me carefully, without blinking. My rapid breathing filled the silence. They looked wrong. Waxy, pale skin and glassy eyes. I took a step backwards. I’d clearly intruded on… something.

“Welcome.” The man at the head of the table tapped his nails against his plate, one after the other. The rhythmic ‘clink’ rippled into my ears. “Are you ready? You seem to be.”

My body froze. His words seeped into my soul, keeping me in place. The throbbing in my temple softened, pulsing in time with those clink. Clink. Clinks. Was I ready? 

He smiled, tilting his head slightly. “It’s okay, that’s a difficult question - isn’t it?” His tone was gentle, the same way you’d speak to a child. “Sit. Listen. Your mind is yet to understand what your soul has known and craved for a while now.”

He gestured towards the empty chair next to him. I sat, my limbs were no longer under my control. The others had stopped watching me, their eyes fixed on him. Waiting. He was their shepherd.

“You’re so tired. The pain must be excruciating. Your mind and body have given up, yet you remain. Let us help you.” He stroked my hair softly. As he spoke, weeks of exhaustion and repressed guilt hit me at once - crushing me. He’d reached inside me and dragged it all out, my very being laid out on the table. 

He continued, “People don't just stumble upon this place, the universe finds a way to bring them here. None of this was an accident, you know. You were meant to be here. You went out of your way to come here, made it your only option. You could have left, the door was open. But you didn't. You chose to follow a memory.” He tapped the plate again. “You wanted this. You want what comes next. Sometimes people like you need someone to guide them - show them the path. That’s why we exist.”

The barmaid reached for something in her pocket and dropped it on my plate. The ring. They didn’t say anything about it; they didn’t need to. The ring spoke for itself, an eternal promise that was never able to be fulfilled.

His words made little sense to me, but they cut deep. What help could they possibly offer me? 

“You can’t fix this.” Slurred and faint, I hardly managed to get the words out. Every syllable required strength I didn’t have.

Every word he spoke drained me, sucked out my will. He wasn’t just talking to me, he was changing me. A lamb to the slaughter.

The man's brow furrowed “Fix it? Fix you? Poppet, attempting to fix something that breaks time and time again is meaningless.” 

I opened my mouth. No words came out. 

“No. Every fibre of your being is begging you to let go. I know you feel it. It’s time for you to leave. You’re ready now, go.”

My body was finally my own again. I picked myself up. My joints ground against eachother with every step. I reached the stairs, holding the wall for support - I began to climb. My body ached. My mind numb. I hunched over, vomiting. I couldn’t get back up. I planted my hands on the stairs and crawled the rest of the way. I wanted to give up, but I saw it. The door, the way out. The night air washed over me; I continued until I couldn’t. I collapsed. Sprawled out on the grass, I let myself rest. I was at the edge of the lake, I closed my eyes. There was no sound, yet the man's words pounded in my mind. I wanted to give up before this place, but being here - it was taking away my choice. The Crossroads Inn was a void of nothingness with no escape and it stole my ability to even try.

“You forgot this.” I opened my eyes. The boy stood over me, in the palm of his hand was the ring. He didn’t give it back to me, though. He sat down, focused on the lake. 

“What was she like?” He asked. 

“She was… special. She was more than just my sister - she was my guiding light.” I didn’t expect a child to understand the grief I felt, the emptiness.

“And now she’s gone.”

“Yeah.” 

“She’s not coming back.”

“I know.”

That was it. He stood up and walked away without another word, leaving me alone with my thoughts and a sense of finality. 

I used the last of my strength to pull myself towards the lake. It called to me, beckoned me closer. I looked into the water and saw her reflection staring back at me. I’m ready.
