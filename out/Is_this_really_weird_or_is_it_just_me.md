Okay so I was walking alone from my college class and got a little hungry so I decided to grab some lunch at a nearby dining hall since it was close. After I finish my meal, A man comes up to me and starts mumbling something. At first I had my headphones in so I couldn't hear him but then he begins to approach me. I take off my headphones and hear him say that he saw me in the dining hall eating alone and if I was a student there. I tell him that I am and that I am a freshman and 17 years old. He's taken aback and said that he thought i was "much older". He says he is a graduate student from another country and is 24 years old. Again he says he thought I was much older and he starts talking about his experience at the school and asks if I wanted to walk and talk with him.

At first he was just talking about the school and how he likes it there but soon after he starts flirting with me by saying he wants to see my smile and how pretty I am. He goes on about how he would party and do heavy drugs during the school year and says that he knows I am the type to be a party girl whatever that means. I start to get a weird vibe from him and even though I entertained him at first wanting to be nice and try to be more social, I decide its time to go. When I say I wanted to go back home and that it was nice to meet him, he insists on walking some more and takes me to a more remote area of the campus. He then pretends to be tired and takes a seat on a bench and tells me to sit with him.

This is my final straw and I say that I have to go to my dorm. He then gets up and is magically not tired anymore and follows me all the way and I am quite uncomfortable at this point. I make it safely to my dorm and get back to my dorm with my heart racing thinking of what could have happened if I did not leave at the time I did. The area was getting more and more remote with less people and who knows what he could have done if I stayed.

A couple days pass and I get a notification from my instagram. Its the same man from that other day. I have a very unique name so if he looked it up and the school we go to after he could have easily found it. He sends me a dm asking how I am and how my recent classes were going. I don't respond and a couple more days go by. To my amazing luck I see him while walking back to my dorm and he stares right into my face but luckily he was with someone else and didn't stop to talk to me. Am I in the wrong for this or is this guy really weird??
