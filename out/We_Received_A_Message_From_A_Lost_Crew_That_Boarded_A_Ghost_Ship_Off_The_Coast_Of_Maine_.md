On 7/5/24 a message was sent to the Hamilton Point Marina in Maine. Hamilton Point is a medium sized marina in North Maine that largely ports lobster and commercial fishing boats. The Wild Rose, a commercial fishing boat led by the decorated Captain H. G Barnes and his crew of ten went missing off the coast of Maine in February, never to return to port. A vast search and rescue mission was orchestrated in locating the missing crew. Captain Banes was a decorated captain, having decades of experience and ran one of the most successful operations on the East Coast. Our last account of Captain Barnes and his crew is them leaving port on 2/11/24 at 4:28am. Typically we’d see Captain Barnes return by mid-afternoon. After 24 hours, a search and rescue team were assembled. The search was called off after two weeks, Barnes and his crew officially pronounced dead with no leads on their location or what had happened. All that changed until now. A message was found in a bottle amongst a pile of debris off the coast of Bar Harbor. A woman walking her dog on the beach one morning came across a pile of debris which looked like it came from a boat wreckage. Amongst the debris was a bottle with carefully folded letters inside. Here is the transcription from the earliest dated note. The hunt for Captain Barnes and his crew has been reopened.

*Location: Unknown*

We spent the night aboard the ship huddled together in the cafeteria. The steel body of the ship was freezing and stung any exposed bare skin. The cold crept through us, chilling us to our core. Captain Barnes didn’t want us to freak out, he tried to keep the conversations hopeful, really it was to no avail. Captain Barnes, Trevor and I were the only survivors left. We boarded the ghost ship three days ago, with a crew of ten in total.

We weren’t even supposed to be here. The regret and anger I feel are so difficult to contain. I hope whoever finds this recording gets help. Maybe there’s some way to triangulate the coordinates and locate the ship somehow. Theres plenty of bodies aboard the ship to begin with, were certainly not the first crew to board this cursed vessel.

I haven’t been able to sleep since we boarded the ship. The lack of sleep might be accounting for some of the things I think I am hearing and seeing. Other times I know deep in my bones what I heard and saw were real. We can hear them walking sometimes or them banging on the walls. They can certainly hear us; I wonder if they smell us too. When Barnes and Trevor snap their heads in the same direction that I was looking towards, we can assume that what we all heard was real and close by. Theres no doubting something sinister is aboard the vessel with us.

We lost most of the crew the first night. Harrison, Engels, and Prichard vanished without a trace. Captain Barnes that first day had wanted us to search the nearly one-thousand-foot-long vessel for any trace of survivors. What he suspected was that it was an old cargo shipping boat that was either retired or something happened that made the crew abandon it. Logs on the boat and signs seemed to be written in Russian but I could be wrong. It was impossible to make anything out once the sun set and we were consumed with the darkness of the open sea.

Our boat was long gone. That fucking coward Edison. Edison on the first day, mere hours aboard the boat snuck away from our search party and took off on our fishing boat. He left us here to die. Three disappearances and one who went AWOL, all within twenty-four hours. The situation was dire.

Eventually we all found our way to the cafeteria. There was enough space in the cafeteria to spread out as well as doors we could lock from the inside and barricade ourselves inwards. Hunger was already getting the best of us. Six of us remained after that first night. We found some rations tucked away and fortunately some water in bottles and others collected in barrels outside. More evidence of humans existed here with the rain barrels, people trying to survive from something. We talked that first night about why Edison would leave us, why he didn’t try to warn us if anything was wrong. We cursed him all night, and none of us slept. It was frigid aboard the boat, and we had no way of getting warmer.

Eventually the sun rose on our second day. We ate some stale crackers and sipped a little bit of water. The ocean was calm and glassy in the cold mornings. Captain Barnes wanted us to search more of the boat for supplies and to figure out some way off this wretched boat; praying that there was a life raft somewhere. We went in pairs; Captain Barnes and I were going to take the lower levels while the rest of the groups went amongst the other two levels. I felt more comfortable with Captain Barnes, he didn’t seem worried just yet and he knew his way around larger vessels like this from his past jobs. He kept calling it a ghost ship, ones you’d see out in the very distance. No crew aboard, nor headed in any direction. Most of the time it was just an old vessel that was retired and sent out to sea, hopefully to make an artificial reef for fish and what not. Captain Barnes had never boarded a ghost ship before, I questioned him on why he did this go of it. All he could say was that he was curious after all these years. I prayed that curiosity wouldn’t kill the cat this time.

Captain Barnes and I bumbled around the lower levels, our breath hanging in the cold air. We found our first body within an hour. We opened lockers periodically as we searched, hopefully to find food or water inside. As I pried opened one of the rusty locker doors and out fell parts of a skeleton. The bones crashed into the floor, covered in cobwebs and reeked of high heavens. Captain Barnes and I examined the body, a complete torso and head remained but the pelvis and legs were missing. Tattered dark clothing hung from the corpse that was stained red. Insects must have eaten much of the flesh. Parts of the skeleton were mummified resembling Egyptian pharaohs. I wish that was the only body we found but quickly we discovered bodies strewn along the floor, in all similar levels of decay. A terrible feeling washed over the both of us, like we were stumbling into the den of a grizzly bear who was feeding. We deduced they were from the same crew, they all bore dark mechanic jumpsuits with some European flag etched onto their shoulder. Blood had stained the floor and walls around the bodies. The rooms we passed by we’d find bodies in all various positions. Some looked like to be hiding, others looked like they were tossed like rag dolls.

Captain Barnes marched ahead, holding a lantern up high illuminating the dark, narrow corridor. We came across a body that appeared to be pulled up into the ceiling by its legs. The body dangled from its torso partially pulled into the ceiling, wearing the same uniform and patch as the previous bodies. Captain Barnes had seen enough at that point; we’d discovered about a dozen bodies and felt like it was time to head back to the main cafeteria. We didn’t say a word to each other, we tried keeping quiet as best we could. With each step walking through the ship, it would clang and reverberate along the entire ship. It felt like with each move we were ringing the dinner bells right to our location.

As we navigated in sheer darkness through the twisting corridors I’d hear things behind us. The sounds of running, echoing down the chambers. Cold breezes would hit us from the front, flickering the light of our only lantern. I begged Captain Barnes to hurry up, he was old and couldn’t see well in the darkness. Maybe he wasn’t hearing anything or chose not to address it, but the sounds were growing louder, closer. My mind raced as I pictured something grabbing me from behind, pulling me into the darkness. The sounds started to quicken behind us, my eyes struggled to adjust to the darkness. I grabbed Captain Barnes by the shoulder and dragged him faster down the corridor. Even Captain could sense then that something was behind us, he would turn back and stare, not making a sound.

The corridor ended with a single flight of stairs to the top decks where hopefully the rest of the crew would meet us. The light at the end of the tunnel was before us. I hastily dragged Captain, the snarling like some kind of animal hot on our tail. I vaulted up the stairs first with ease. Captain needed to take one step at a time, time that he could not afford. I cursed at him, screaming at him to hurry up. I half considered leaving him there, shutting the door in front of him and letting whatever creature was there to rip him to shreds like the rest of the fated crew. At least it would buy me more time to escape. Something inside me thought foolishly that whatever it was couldn’t open the doors, but I knew I was being naive.

I reached for Captain Barnes’ hand to pull him up the stairs faster when he stumbled and crashed onto the steel steps, his nose breaking on the impact. Captain Barnes let out a horrific screech, he clutched at his leg. Stuck right above the back of his ankle was a shiv with a dirty brown cloth handle. Captain Barnes looked wide eye, his mouth struggling to form words. A pale hand reached out from within the darkness, grasping for the shiv. I pulled Captain Barnes up the few remaining stairs while the hand wretched the shiv from Barnes, sending a spray of blood against the wall. A face appeared from within the darkness, pale just as its arm. With sunken yellow eyes and jagged teeth. It looked at me with his head cocked and licked the blood from the shiv with its twisted tongue. The creature looked human to the smallest degree but lacked humanity in many areas.

 In a desperate attempt without thinking much about the consequences, I launched the lantern which shattered against the creature’s face. The lantern exploded in a flash of fire and the creature toppled backwards down the stairs crashing against the floor. I swore that in the brief moment of illumination that there were more creatures right behind that one, but I couldn’t say for sure. I hauled Captain Barnes up the stairs and slammed the door shut. I closed the latch and dropped to the floor.

Captain Barnes could barely stand; I assumed the shiv must have severed a ligament in his leg. It was not bleeding tremendously which surprised me, but his walking was impacted. Captain Barnes hung off my shoulder while we hobbled towards the cafeteria. The creature was slamming itself against the door, vibrating throughout the entire empty ship. It let out a harrowing shriek. It must have been calling reinforcements I figured. The door rattled against the weight of the creature. Who knows how long the ship has been out here, the salt water and rust must be doing a number to the steel. It wouldn’t hold long, and I wasn’t prepared to stick around to find out.

Left alone in the darkness now without a light, our only source of light came from the holes in the ship where sunlight pierced through. The shrieks of the creatures faded in the distance as we raced towards the cafeteria. Eventually, a light grew stronger ahead of us. We banged on a door, peering inside the cafeteria where the rest of the crew were huddled around a few lanterns. We screamed for them to open. Captain Barnes crashed onto the floor while the rest of the crew attended to his wounds. I fell to the ground as well, trying to process what in the hell was going on. Something I am still not able to wrap my head around. This is a living hell. [Please if anyone is out there, you have to find us.](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheNightmareLibrary/hot/?created=t3_1dy9pl8)
