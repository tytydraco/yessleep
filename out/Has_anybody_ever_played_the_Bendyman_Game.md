I feel like I'm going insane. As I type this, that \*thing\* watches me from outside my window. I hate the way it looks at me, like its eyes pry into my back. But it's stayed there for 10 years, so it probably won't come down soon.

I first played the Bendyman Game when I was eight years old.

I remember the way the sun streamed down through the leaves, I remember the blue shirt with a rainbow that I wore that day, I remember all of us sitting on the woodchips in a weird square-like shape, in the woods just outside the playground. I remember what Ethan said that day

"Have you ever heard of the Bendyman Game?"

"No. It sounds like a baby game." said Alex, very bluntly. The kid had this thing, back when we were young, about saying everything that came through his head. It probably wasn't a good idea to say something that would offend Ethan. He was a little weird about that.

"Is that a video game?" said Elise. "I've never heard of it." 

I hadn't heard of it either. Neither did Gavin and Sarah, across and to the left of me.

"Well," and as Ethan said this, a strange fanaticism came through his voice, "I heard about it from sleepaway camp. I've played it before, so I know how to do it."

He continued. Gosh, looking back on it, he looked terrible. His hair and skin were terribly greasy, like they hadn't been washed in a long time. He had bulging bags under his eyes, which were flecked with specks of red veins and had a paranoid look to them. Ethan wasn't one for putting much effort into himself, but this was a new low, even for him.

"We summon the Bendyman. Then, we ask him a question. And we give something in return."

I rolled my eyes. "Bendyman? Sounds like a knockoff version of the Slenderman. And it does sound like a baby game."

"IT'S NOT A BABY GAME!" He responded back, even crazier sounding than before.

"Whatever." Gavin said. "Let's just play the game."

  
Ethan told all of us to stand up in a circle. He took off his battered backpack, and unzipped it extremely loudly. Out of it, he pulled out an antique haircomb, a cigarette lighter, a paper crane, an old diary, and oddly enough, a necklace that belonged to my mother when she was still on this earth.

I wanted to know where he got that, but I was weirded out enough to know not to ask.

He laid out the objects in a small circle on the mulch-woodchip floor. We stared at him while he did this. I'm sure the others recognized the items too.

With an odd delicacy that was unbefitting of Ethan, he pulled out the final object from his backpack and ceremoniously laid it out in the center of the circle. It was a gun. I didn't know which kind and I still don't, but it was small enough to fit in his backpack and big enough to be scary. It had kind of a metallic gleam to it, and it looked somehow... malevolent.

Sarah said, " I don't like this. I think we'll get in trouble. Let's just play video games again."

Ethan did not look up. He walked outside the circle of items, and drew a larger circle around where we were all standing with the barrel of that horrible gun. Thus, we formed some sort of ring outside the interior objects.

I was getting scared like Sarah. This seemed like a really bad idea. Even if the Bendyman didn't come, we'd still get in trouble for that gun. Besides, Ethan looked really not okay at that point. Still, I said nothing.

“Now, we get our masks.” He said creepily. “Or else we will become masks.”

I think at that point we all collectively realized that whatever the fuck was going on, it was clearly not normal. I remember sweating through my palms, praying that this wouldn’t be as weird as he was making out to be. If I didn’t have a mask, what would happen to me? 

Gavin spoke first. “I don’t have a mask.”

This clearly ignited something in Ethan. “YOU DIDN’T BRING A MASK?? ARE YOU STUPID? DO YOU WANT TO DIE??” Spittle formed at the corners of his mouth, looking like a rabid dog.

“N…no??” He nervously replied.

A moment of silence, which Elise’s feet crunching on the ground broke. She started sprinting away, her sparkly pink and purple shoes getting dirt all on them. 

I guess she was the smartest of us back then. 

By this time, Ethan had wiped the spit off of his mouth and calmed down enough to give us a rational answer. “All right, I suppose we can do this without masks. You must put your heads all next to the wood chips and not look up NO MATTER WHAT.”

For some reason, I did what he told me to do. The others did too. 

“Now, we wait for the crunch.”

I breathed in the smell of the stale dirt, and wondered if anything actually would happen or if Ethan just stayed up late watching creepypasta YouTube videos one night. Stealing the gun… that seriously made me wonder if maybe this would be bad.

Soon enough, we found out. An echoing crunch came from a tree that was behind Sarah. It was strangely loud like the tree itself was falling. If it did fall down, it must have landed pretty softly( as I didn’t hear the thump after the snap.

More snaps, like bones that hadn’t been used for a while. My breathing was hard and heavy in my ear, and my heart pounded like it was the end of the world.

The snapping continued and I heard footsteps pacing behind me. They didn’t sound like human footsteps, though. It was more like something on four legs. 

Finally, the footsteps came to a stop. A strange sound emanated from somewhere, which sounded like wind whistling but also like the hiss of a snake. I was dying to catch a glimpse of the creature, but Ethan’s words kept me frozen in place. 

The footsteps started again, moving around the circle in methodical, snappy steps. Just before it was my ‘turn’, I heard another snap.

A different kind of snap. The kind that Doc Martens make when they are worn by a 150-pound goth kid with green hair and a septum piercing.

The thing next to me tensed. I could feel its odd waxlike skin pressing into mine, and then another sickening SNAP as it bent its head towards the intruders.

I had no idea what those crazy goth kids were doing in the woods, carrying a pentagram, some chalk, and a mysterious bottle of a substance I would later discover was lube. One was a tall, far girl with a cow ring and dead eyes- (the one who stepped on the stick) and the other one was a kid wearing an alligator mask, fishnet tights, and a maid outfit.

This day had only gotten more and more perplexing, so I decided for some reason to look up and see what was going on. Now  I understood why Ethan told me not to look up.

That monster had human skin, but very odd bones- too much, and in the wrong places. It was too tall and crawled on all fours.  The closest thing I could possibly say to describe it would be the Father Fester, but the Bendyman seemed… rubbery, somehow.

When it caught sight of the fat goth kid, it slowly raised its hands with slow, jerky movements. The thing had eyes that looked like they were about to bulge out of its skull, and teeth were brown and rotten.

The Bendyman pressed its fingers into its face, like it was resculpting itself. Its skull bent like rubber, and with the bony hands the nose and face were reshaped until the goth’s face was looking back at itself.

It couldn’t last, though. The skin sagged, and its eyes plopped out and bounced on the floor. A black liquid oozed from the sockets of that thing, and it pressed its fingers into that poor girl’s face, ready to replace itself.

I have no idea what Ethan learned at camp, but I learned that the best course of action in danger is run. So I ran. I ran as far as my small green Nike shoes would take me, through the summery woods, past trees, crunching on wood chips, until I reached my house. 

My house was a 19th century Victorian house, looked like a horror movie prop, but could be very cozy in a storm or at night. I jiggled the handle, kicked the door, but it wouldn’t open.

At last, the door opened. It was my cousin Jing, visiting from China for university summer break. I hadn’t known that she was coming, but she must have been so confused to see me all sweaty and scared and wood chips on my sweatshirt.

“Hello, Luke! It’s so good to see you again!” She said as she pulled me into a hut. “Are you all right? You look all dirty.”

“No, I’m fine. It was just a game that me and my friends were playing,” I said out of breath.

“Well, that sounds fun. Why home so soon?”

I didn’t know what to say, so I just said that some older kids took over the playground and I accidentally tripped and fell and I wanted to go home. Jing didn’t believe me and gave me a skeptic look, and to be honest, I didn’t believe myself either. I spent the rest of the day locked in the upstairs, praying that the Bendyman wouldn’t find me and steal my face.

Dinner was bok choy, chicken, noodles, and fear. My parents came late from work as they almost always did, and I prodded at my noodles. I now feared the rubber.

“Mama, Baba, can I go to bed early? I think I got a little sick.” I said, trying to make my voice as whiny as possible.

My mom looked with concern at me and my pale, sweaty face. Still, she let me go without questioning too much. 

That night, I couldn’t sleep. I tossed and turned, the smell of burning rubber seemed to follow me everywhere. All that was malleable was succeptible to sculpting, only in rigid objects would safety be found. 

I stepped on the floor and my feet took me to the door. I heard my bones crack, which comforted me a bit since it proved that I wasn’t rubber yet. 

The wood was cool under my feet, the hall was strangely cold for the summer, it overall had a feeling of premonition before me. I stepped close to the window, couldn’t breathe, couldn’t move, just look at what was going on outside of my house. 

I heard a methodical tapping. It broke my trance, and sent me sprinting back to my room. It didn’t follow me and I couldn’t catch another look, but at least I knew that I wasn’t crazy. I checked my clock- 11:37. It was late (I was 8 at that time), so I tried to go to sleep.

My dreams were filled with a liquid rubber, burning oil, and the smell of fear.



It’s been 10 years and I stand before the window now. Even though I was perfectly sane before, I hear the tapping every night and it’s seriously affecting my mental health. 
Tonight, I’m going to give the Bendyman what it wants.
