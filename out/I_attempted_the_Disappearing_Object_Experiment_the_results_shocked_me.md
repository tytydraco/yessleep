Greetings, sleepless Redditors. I've decided to share a peculiar experience that might intrigue those familiar with the enigmatic "disappearing object phenomenon" (DOP). I've encountered numerous posts about this phenomenon on the Glitch in the Matrix subreddit, and I was compelled to delve deeper into its potential causes. Basically, the DOP describes instances where objects “disappear” without a logical trace. Some believe it to be a simulation error, while others assume something paranormal is at play.

Was it merely a matter of misplaced items? Were these tales fabrications? Or was there a genuine, inexplicable occurrence at play? These questions gnawed at me, igniting my philosophical curiosity.

Initially, I dismissed the phenomenon as nonsense. However, my skepticism gradually eroded as I delved into the subject. While browsing the Wikihow website, a curious article titled "How to Do the Disappearing Object Experiment" caught my eye. Intrigued by the unknown, I clicked on it. It has since been deleted due to several deaths all relating to the experiment.

The steps outlined in the article were as follows:

Select a small, round object that can fit into tight spaces.

Grasp the object firmly, vividly imagining its texture and color.

Place two identical objects side by side in a spacious, open room devoid of hiding places.

Close your eyes and kick the objects in opposite directions.

Open your eyes and search for the objects. If one or both is missing despite moving all the furniture, congratulations! Your object has vanished into the ether.

If the objects haven't disappeared after numerous attempts, repeat the process with your eyes open.

While initially skeptical, my boredom and curiosity compelled me to give it a try. I had a supply of unopened golf balls, ideal for the experiment.

I conducted the experiment in my spacious yet moderately furnished living room, ensuring all doors were closed and my cat was removed from the area. After several hours of fruitless attempts, something extraordinary happened. After kicking both golf balls, with my eyes still closed, I noticed that one of them was mysteriously atop my couch, despite the impossibility of it “rolling” up there.

Hours later, again I did the same as usual but with my eyes opened. The other golf ball began rolling at un natural speeds and landed into my cats water dish with a splash. I walked over to the dish, expecting the ball to be floating at the surface, but to my shock, it was not there. I searched exhaustively, but it was nowhere to be found. This experience triggered memories of a similar occurrence. One night, I had misplaced my house keys, searching the entire house to no avail. They never reappeared in their original spot. I was angered by the burden of having to buy new house keys.

I noticed that my cats water dish was dirty so I went to my kitchen sink to clean it out. As I was refilling the dish, I noticed that the running water flowed right through the bowl as if it didn’t have a bottom. Shocked, I stood there for a few minutes, just watching as the water seemingly flowed through the bowl impossibly. I tried touching the bottom of the dish, but my fingers phased right through it. At the sight of this, I immediately blacked out. How was this even possible?

I awoke from my slumber and got up from the kitchen floor.  I felt a sense of unease. It was eerily quiet as if I was the only living being alive. No birds chirping, no engines roaring, no music playing. My home was enveloped in an eerie silence, and an unusual accumulation of dust permeated the air. When I looked at my kitchen counter, I was shocked to see my lost house keys. They had been in plain sight, and there was no way I just “missed” them all these years. I saw that my walls looked grayish from the amount of dust present. There also appeared to be what looked like foot steps on my living room carpet but assumed that was from my doing. Where my cats water dish used to be was that golf ball. It had reappeared? The neighborhood seemed deserted, and when I tried look for my cat, I couldn’t find her. 

As I prepared to rest, I heard strange noises emanating from within my home. Eventually, I awoke, glimpsing a shadowy figure, peeking from my closet. covered in dust, standing at a height of 8 feet, it quickly bolted to the foot of my bed at a speed I couldn’t comprehend. Fear gripped me as it stood there menacingly, its translucent form seeming both human and alien. It had no facial features present, but I could sense that I was in danger. 

I attempted to call the cops, but my phone had no service strangely. My area usually had good service but for some reason it didn’t exist. The figure began moving and let out a laugh. In an instant, The figure forced its arm down my throat, filling me with dust, laughing maniacally as it tortured me. As I was struggling to breathe, I took a closer look at this beings arm. There was no flesh, no bone, only what appeared to be layers of dust. As I lost consciousness, I saw the figure and the dust vanish. When I regained consciousness, my cat was by my side. The phone service had been restored, and I discovered that my failed 911 calls were logged, proving that this was not a dream. But that golf ball and my house heys are missing again..

To this day, I remain perplexed by these events. I am not sure if I entered a parallel reality where these missing objects re-manifest, or if I dealt with something paranormal. The reappearance of the golf ball, my keys, and the sight of the  eerie encounter with the dust figure all seemed to suggest that I had entered a rip in the fabric of the universe. I am certain that I experienced the disappearing object phenomenon and went to the very place where these objects reside.

 Occasionally, while sleeping, I’ll feel a tiny particle of dust land on my nose…

If you are planning on trying the disappearing object experiment, take caution. The “dust bunnies” as I like to call those freakishly tall monsters, are incredibly quick and they will try killing you if they find you. Be careful in this empty sub dimension, as no one can save you from them. There’s no telling when you will reappear back into our reality. Just like some of these objects, you could be vanished forever…

I got to go now, I’m starting to hear something in the hallway…
