  

Storm chasing is actually a safer profession than factory work, public transit, and even teaching now. Every known storm chaser death over the last 60 years has been driving related, most of which had nothing to do with the actual storm itself. You don’t choose to chase tornados because its safe, but when people bring up safety as a reason they could never do the job it proves to me they don’t know what they’re talking about. At least I felt that way for the first 15 years I was storm chasing. Then last year everything changed. 

I was in Chickasha county, Oklahoma heading south towards Texas. I was in Norman for a storm chaser meet up a week into spring, tornado season was up and running, I’d already put 600 miles on my truck. Everybody knew everybody else for the most part, sometimes we had newcomers, most of them didn’t come back the next year. It isn’t the storms that drives people away it’s the driving, the tedious radar checking, the disappointment when you been chasing a cold wind for 3 days and the damn twister doesn’t even touch the ground. You have to be obsessed with these storms, the horrific beauty, the terrifying power, it has to be in your bones or you won’t make it back out here. Not to mention Oklahoma is about the least visually appealing place the country has to offer.  Now I’m from west Texas and there ain’t much to see out there either, but my god do I pine for the hundreds of miles of desert when I’m in the plains of Oklahoma. Hell, at least we have mountains. But a storm chaser in the mountains is like a fisherman in the in the Gobi, just don’t belong. 

Anyway, I was on the tail of storm system making it’s way over to Wichita Falls, it had changed direction on me twice and I almost gave up on her, but there was a warm wind coming up from Louisiana and it was sure to bring a hell of a storm with it. Now I’ve had more sub-par meals in local diners than I’ve had hot meals at home but every single one of them is worth it when I get a tornado that touches ground. I’m not a scientist, I’m not doing this to further the knowledge of mankind. I’m what is now being called a “storm journalist” although “guy who really likes tornados” is more accurate. I document what I see, take pictures, take some measurements of winds and temperatures and then I send them to websites that give me enough money to live. I happened to be a little low on funds and I had to follow this storm and just hope and pray it turned in to something. 

Buddy of mine named Jeff Skelton had a real nose for the cold winds and where they were headed told me the twister would turn up about 40 miles northeast of Wichita, I headed out there, saw a couple of other teams on the way. I worked alone but most people didn’t now a days. Safety in numbers and all that. I parked the truck in a field after I paid the owner of the land a small fee for letting me on it. This was my favorite part of the whole thing. Setting up my equipment while the winds grew more powerful and the rain started, the chaos always brought a deep peace to my mind. Like all the shit flying around inside my head finally matched what the outside was looking like. I used to love being in the middle of the storm. Until I didn’t.

I first noticed this storm was different because of the lightning. Or lack there of. I’d never seen it before. All tornadoes come from thunderstorms. Sometimes the lighting strikes aren’t as many, sometimes they don’t even hit the ground, but the sky is always lit up when a twister starts turning. The funnel started to form in the clouds and I hadn’t seen a hint of lighting in an our more when I was up north. My first reaction was how lucky I was to be covering such a rarely occurring natural phenomenon. My second reaction was doubt, and uncertainty. The doubt and uncertainty didn’t have much time with me though. Soon every inch of my body was enveloped in fear. 

As the twister touched the ground I could see something moving inside of it. Not the usual swirl of debris from houses and trees, but something gigantic. Something moving against the swirls of the wind, something that you could feel in the ground beneath you every time it took a step. There is a mysterious reoccurrence whenever there are deaths from a tornado. Many bodies are never found. The logical thought is, of course, that the bodies are thrown such great distances and such random locations that the couldn’t possibly be located, but it happened even with smaller twisters. I think I was beginning to understand why. 

Whatever was in the twister kept taking swipes at the ground. It was pulling up tress and dirt and whatever else was in it’s path and sending it into the swirling winds. The storm was coming closer to me but I was glued to the part of the earth I occupied. From the field to the left of me a red jeep pulled up right next to me. 

“Jerry we got to get the hell out of here. What is that thing?” I didn’t answer. I stayed staring into the storm as much as I possibly could, I needed to understand what I was looking at. The guys in the Jeep were friends of mine, Dave and Harry. They hopped out and grabbed me, threw me in the back seat and took off. Madder than spit and running like a hot damn. But my eyes were fixed on the monster in the twister. I watched it throw my truck into the swirling winds. I watched it as it started to ascend back into the heavens. I watched until Dave turned onto the main road and I couldn’t see it anymore. Dave pulled over about 15 miles down the road and started to weep. Harry was also overcome with emotion. We tried to talk about it then and there but the words kept getting stuck in the back of our throats. 

I haven’t chased a storm since I seen the thing inside the twister. The cold winds will disappear soon and then twister season will be over. Usually that’s the saddest part of the year for me. Hell, it can’t come fast enough.
