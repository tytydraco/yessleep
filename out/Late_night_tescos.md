 It was a dark and stormy night when I decided to make a trip to Tesco's. I had been craving some junk food, and I figured that the supermarket would be the perfect place to find what I was looking for.

As I pulled into the parking lot, I could see that the store was almost empty. There were only a few cars scattered here and there, and the windows of the store were dark and foreboding. I shuddered as I made my way to the entrance, feeling a strange sense of unease wash over me.

When I stepped inside, I was greeted by the eerie silence of the store. The shelves were empty, and the few products that were on display seemed to be covered in a thick layer of dust. I could hear my footsteps echoing through the aisles as I made my way deeper into the store, and I couldn't shake the feeling that I was being watched.

I eventually made my way to the junk food aisle, but to my dismay, all of the shelves were empty. I was about to turn and leave when I heard a faint whisper coming from the back of the store. I turned to see a shadowy figure standing at the end of the aisle, and my heart began to race.

I cautiously made my way towards the figure, and as I got closer, I could see that it was an old woman. She was dressed in ragged clothes and had a wild, almost animalistic look in her eyes. She beckoned to me, and I could hear her whispered words in my ear.

"Come with me," she said. "I have something you want."

I hesitated for a moment, but the temptation of finding some junk food was too strong. I followed the old woman as she led me deeper into the store, and I could feel the hairs on the back of my neck standing on end.

We eventually came to a small, dingy room in the back of the store, and the old woman pushed open the door. Inside, I could see rows and rows of junk food, stacked high on the shelves. I felt a surge of excitement as I realized that I had found what I had been looking for.

But as I reached out to grab a bag of chips, the old woman suddenly let out a chilling laugh. She lunged at me, her eyes glowing with madness, and I realized too late that I had made a terrible mistake.

The old woman was not just an ordinary old woman â€“ she was a ghost, trapped in the store for all eternity. And as she dragged me into the darkness, I knew that I would never leave Tesco's alive.

I am writing this from an old phone I found in the back room the lady took me to, I'm not sure how much longer I'm gonna last here but at least I have the phone with a little bit of WiFi.
