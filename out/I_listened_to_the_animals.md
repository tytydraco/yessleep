I wish I could be in better spirits writing this...I listened to the animals, but I also ignored what they said, I wish I took this more seriously.

After making the post and with support I was going to see what was in the woods, I was scared but I couldn't take the noises anymore. As the noise started up again I went to the window to see the squirrels again, there was six of them now throwing things at my window, even started to crack.

"Go into the woods." They said in unison in that commanding voice from before, instead of a calm dominance, whatever this is it's patients was running thin.

"Fine I'll go, b but in the morning, it's freezing right now." I said shaking a bit but I tried my best to stand my ground. With that statement they all dropped whatever they had and ran off, I could even hear the mice leaving the walls, they all just left.

In the morning I collected equipment, warm clothing, flashlight, food, water, some rope, and a knife. I should of brought a gun but knowing me id rather run then fight so it was better to keep it light. Then my cowardice side realized something.

The animals left, they just took my word and I haven't seen a squirrel all day, maybe it all some sick prank? I decided to test my luck, I had everything ready but I put it the side and enjoyed my day and as the sun fell I looked out my window and hey no squirrels!

But as I went to bed, closing my eyes, a deer called outside. I don't know if you ever heard a deer before but one noise they make is to call other deer, it's like a creaking door slowly opening and as it continues it gets louder and louder. As I got up another started...it was two going at the same time, almost deafening to the ears as I get downstairs to look outside the window.

Now there was four deer standing outside, there darting eyes looking at the house. They lowered their heads before slowly arching up making that agonizing sound again, getting louder and louder with each one. I plugged my ears and looked away trying to block out the noise with thoughts. Once it ended I looked outside and there was eight now, bucks and doe alike.

"What the fuck is going on?!" My stepdad stepped out of his bedroom, gun in hand with Toby barking, from the calls I didn't even hear Toby going nuts.

"He lied" the deer said, that tone from before had a hint of sorrow in it, whatever was going to happen next was a punishment it didn't want to do.

I looked to my stepdad, a figure of a strong man now petrified after hearing some deer speak, the only thing pushing him was the anger and andreline of being awoken in the middle of the night. He goes to the door putting on a jacket before going out there with a gun and Toby.

"Wait Dave this isn't normal!" I grabbed onto his jacket pulling him back inside, but I couldn't grab Toby. Dave looked at me before looking out the window again, rationality coming back to him for a moment.

We tried calling Toby back in, but he was transfixed on the deer, his hair standing up, a ferocious growl that would scare normal deer, but they just stood there looking at the dog like it was nothing but an annoyance.

" We have to get him, t there just standing there we can get him." I tried my best to hold onto my stepdad as he said that but with a yank he was free from my grasp as he stepped outside.

I couldn't I wish I could of stepped outside and pull them in but fear overtook my body as I stare from the window. Dave held his gun up, a simple hunting rifle, he couldn't kill them all but it seemed to help him move forward. He got to Toby grabbing his collar, about 10 feet away from the deer.

"Go into the woods." A buck uttered looking at me in the window before turning to my stepdad and started charging, antler's down but before it got close a shot rung from my Dave's gun. As he tried to reload he let go of Toby who stood beside my stepdad ready to defend.

The deer did there call once more, wailing in the sky as more dear appear and started charging. Toby tried to take one down before he got speared by a buck, it's antler's going through his body as Dave took another shot getting revenge for Toby.

He dropped the gun and just started running to the door, the sickening feeling from watching my dog get fired to death broke me from my paralysis as I go to the door opening it wide.

"C'mon Dave you can make it!!" I screamed terror pulling at my heart as I watch him run, a horde of deer charging at him... The last thing I saw was the deer catching up and trampling down on my stepfather, the shattering of bones rung in my ears before slamming the door. I put my weight against it as the deer slammed there heads into the door over and over, I could hear on the other side skulls cracking before they smashed there exposed brains against the door and dying on top of each other till they couldn't get past the bodies.

I didn't know what to think, grief and anger trying to take over my body, as tears fell I heard the call again. More team came and just started running into the house, some just ran slamming full force into the wall before dying, others took the initial blow before trying again until there body couldn't.

"Fine! I'm sorry I lied please forgive me! I'll go into the woods I'll go into the woods!!" I screamed I didn't know what else do. The slamming stopped, the only thing that could be heard was my crying and the howling of the wind.

I finally found the courage to stand and look out the window, a stack of dead deer and brain matter splatter on the glass as I see one deer standing there it looked at me once more before slowly wandering back into the woods.

It was - 3 Fahrenheit If I had death wish I would of gone last night but if I die I want it to be with purpose. And this is where I sit the next day. I have all my gear but I grabbed three more things, I siphoned the gas from a vehicle, some matches and my stepdad gun. I'm not planning on coming back, I let people that took care of me die because I was to much of a coward to go into the woods.

I ignored the animals... But I shall listen now. I'm going into the woods.
