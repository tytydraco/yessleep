There was a man waiting for me on my front porch when I got home from work. He waved at me as I walked to my house from my driveway. I had a strange feeling about him, because he was a strange-looking man. There are strangers, and then there are strange strangers, and there’s a world of difference between them. But I waved back. Ours is a friendly town filled with friendly people.

“Good evening,” I said.

“And to you,” the man said. His head was shaped like an egg, and it was almost one and one-third times taller than the average man’s.

“Can I help you?” I said.

“Let me not be rude,” he said, “it’s my pleasure to make your acquaintance. In the way of comity and fellowship, I’d like to introduce myself. My name is Roger.” He held his hand out to shake.

I shook his hand and his fingers were long and cold and bumpy. A strange stranger’s strange head and strange hands. 

“Roger, I’m Maryellen,” I said. “Let me also not be rude but still be direct. I've had a long day at work, so maybe you could tell me right out what you’re doing here and how I can help you.”

Eggheaded Roger nodded like I’d said something true and wise. “I can certainly appreciate that. If there’s something that I can appreciate, it’s directness. That’s what folks are missing these days, directness—that along with a direction. I’m a rather direct man myself,” he said, though he was in the middle of disproving the same, “so let me get right to it.” He bent down and reached into a paper grocery bag, and pulled out a carton of eggs. “I’m from the Keystone Co-operative Growers’ Association, and I would like to offer you these eggs. They’re farm-fresh and cruelty-free, and it would be my honor, and the honor of my fellow growers, if you would accept this gift and use these eggs to your own delight.”

He held out the carton and I took the eggs. “Oh. Oh, okay. This is like a—this is a—what is this?” I said.

“A carton of eggs, ma’am.” His smile was too wide for his face and it looked like the gesture might’ve been hurting him.

“Yes, I understand that part—”

“Good,” he said.

“—but why are you giving out free eggs?”

“This is just a service we provide to the community. You see, the KCGA—that’s our initialism, you understand—the KCGA’s position is that to enjoy a good egg is to enjoy life. We want the whole world to enjoy their lives, which to some degree means we want them to enjoy our eggs, too!”

“Oh.”

“Do you know that a god lives inside of our eggs?”

“How’s that now?” 

“The time will come when the god-filled eggs will feed the sick and the poor until the sick and the poor are no more. That time will be the Time of the Egg. Everything unborn will be born and everything dead will be born again. All will fall under the judgment of the many heads.”

I stared at him. I said, “Is this a religious thing? I don’t really go to church…”

“There will be no more faith when the world’s flags are blooded. The light of sanctification is kept only inside the egg.”

“I’ve only ever met one Scientologist. Are you a Scien—”

“Well, as I said, it would make all of us at the KCGA just happy as the day is long if you’d only take those eggs and enjoy them for yourself. And with that, I will leave you and wish you a wonderful rest of your evening. Enjoy your eggs, and enjoy your life, ma’am. And if you can, enjoy both at once!”

He turned and sprinted toward the woods. I looked down at my new eggs, thinking of L. Ron Hubbard.

•

The KCGA man was half a bubble off plumb, and I was undecided as far as eating lunatic produce. I thought I’d mull it over before frying up the man’s eggs.

But maybe I was being mistrustful. I reminded myself to keep in the habit of trusting people until they give me a reason not to. Ours is a friendly town filled with friendly people.

•

I woke up hungry Saturday morning. Still in my pajamas, I maundered downstairs with the residue of sleep in my eyes. I looked in my refrigerator. There was nothing in there but those KCGA eggs.

I picked the egg carton up out of the refrigerator. I put the eggs on the counter next to where the range was built into it. I took the salted butter from the fridge and lobbed a dollop off into the skillet. I clicked the gas on the stovetop. The skillet got crackling. I reached for one of the eggs.

I picked up the first egg, nice and cold from the fridge. I could feel the weight of albumen and yolk inside the shell. But when I broke the shell on the edge of the skillet, then cracked it all the way open, there was nothing inside.

I had a feeling like one of those rubes a magician calls on stage just to make a fool of. I knew I’d felt something inside that egg.

I took the next one, its heft the weight of a shellful of egg. I again split the shell on the skillet. Naught but nothing, the same as before.

There I was, starting to get miffed.

I went through eleven eggs that way. Every one of them felt like it had a chicken egg inside of it—hell, I know what a full egg feels like. I cracked almost all of them open; empty down to each one.

One egg was left. In for a penny, in for a pound: I picked up what I expected to be the last empty egg. Except when I cracked this one, something came out. 

It wasn't the yolk.

A small egg-shaped human head plopped into the skillet out the shell; it had two sets of three little legs, one set coming out each side of the head. I screeched, and when the spidery little head hit the skillet and started sizzling, it was screeching, too.

I took the spatula and flipped the thing onto the counter. It moved its spindly little legs like it was hurt. It cried like how a baby cries. A tiny little egg-sized critter, half-fried on my kitchen counter. 

I turned off the burner. But I did not know what to do next.

The six-legged-head made a wheezing sound, then there was a noise like air being let out of a bicycle tire. And then it was dead.

I did not shower or brush my teeth or put real clothes on. I poured myself three fingers of whisky, grabbed the pack of cigarettes I’d swore off of two months ago, and parked my ass on my front porch steps. I sat there until I’d finished my whisky and smoked a half-dozen Parliaments.

I tucked my old-fashioned glass behind my derrière’s sternpost when the early-risers passed by on their morning stroll. To neighbors who stopped and said they thought I’d quit smoking, I made a gesture of hey-what-can-you-do. Ours is a friendly town full of friendly people.

•

I had some liquid courage to fortify me, so I reentered my house and then my kitchen. 

The six-legged-head was gone, but there was another egg in its place. This one was about the size of a grapefruit.

•

I figured on driving down the state road to my friend Dustin’s. His daddy was a poultryman, so Dustin knew lots about chickens and lots about eggs and loved talking about both. So much so that I’d previously found him duller than watching paint dry. But it’s not like I ever told him.

I put the egg in a little grocery bag and hung it on the wall hooks while I went to get ready to see Dustin.

By the time I got cleaned up and dressed, there was someone knocking on my door. I went downstairs and opened it to find my old high school boyfriend, Danny.

Danny smiled. I smiled back.

“Hi, Maryellen.”

“Danny. How’s tricks?”

“Well, you know, I’m in town to visit my brother and my new niece. He had a girl this time.”

“How is good ol’ Earlybird?” I said.

We used to call Danny’s baby brother Earlybird Earl because he was a known fussbudget who’d rather lose a limb than show up at church or school any less than fifteen minutes early. His mother used to say that Earl would make sure to be dead and resurrected twice before anyone else even knew the Rapture had started.

“He’s more boring than watching grass grow. Say, I was wondering if you—”

“I’ll get my purse.”

This was a semi-regular thing. When Danny came back to town, we went out carousing as a matter of course. After trolling roadhouses, we returned to my place to, as I’ve heard it put, “Netflix and chill.”

I was out the door not a minute later. The grapefruit-sized egg still hung on my wall hook, but for the moment unseen through the call of my lust.

•

We got dropped off back home after drinking by my friend Jackie, three sheets to the wind, too blitzed to steer the ship but too old to be stupid enough to drunk-drive either.

Some call that wisdom.

Me and Danny stood under the fading yellow porch light as it projected the shadows of moths’ aerial maneuvers. Danny kept grabbing at me (not in a bad way). I needed to concentrate because the lock, as if by magic, kept moving away from my key.

“Maryellen, I—you know, I like—I—”

I turned around and held my finger to my lips, trying not to laugh, “Shhhh. I got neighbors. They’re late when it sleeps. I mean—Danny, hey, Danny—what do I mean?”

“You mean they’re sleeping when you—” Danny stumbled back into my wind chime and jangled it loud “—shit!”

I started laughing hysterically. I finally managed to tell Danny that I thought my neighbors probably moved their bowels during daylight hours, too. He didn’t get it. To be fair, I’m not sure it was a joke.

I got the key in the lock and opened the door. Danny grabbed my wrist and stopped me as I was about to walk in.

“Hold on, little lady. It’s late at night and the light’s not bright. Lemme check your homestead,” he said and waggled his eyebrows.

I laughed and held one arm toward my door like a girl presenting game show prizes. “My hero. You’re sure as shit chivalrous.”

Danny walked inside. He suddenly stopped after just a few steps. I heard a gurgling sound. Then a croaking sound, like when you’re in severe pain but don’t have the wind to cry out. Danny just stood there.

“Danny,” I said, “what are you doing?” I reached inside and to the left of him and switched on the vestibule light.

I saw why Danny was stock-still and what was gurgling. Two foot-and-a-half-long barbs punctured his neck and the side of his head at his temple, respectively. There came a thick, quick slushing sound as the barbs slickly slid out of his throat and skull. Danny convulsed as he fell to the floor. I stared but couldn’t move.

A half-dozen legs like seven-foot-long bendable stilts carried forward a massive head the size of a yoga ball. My adrenal glands secreted enough to boot me off my drunk.

I put together the sequence in my head: the first egg gave birth to the first tiny head with legs; the first tiny head with legs gave birth to the bigger egg; the bigger egg gave birth to this. 

The barbs snapped back into the egg-shaped-head’s mouth. The thing’s six legs locomoted like an eight-foot-tall spider crab’s. Its height was all long limbs.

I screamed. I turned to run. It caught me on the snare of one of its crustacean spindles. The appendage was no thicker than a garden hose, but the kinetic strength of the other five legs produced an unimpedible force. The six-legged-head flung me like a ragdoll across my living room.

I hit head first into a wall. Everything went black.

•

I woke up in the corner of my living room. The six-legged-head was gigantic, much bigger than before. A proboscis like a livid blood-red bamboo chute extended from the middle of its forehead, down toward the ground, where it had punctured Danny’s body through the top of his skull. I heard slurping and sucking noises over another noise like a wet/dry shop vacuum.

As it sucked out Danny’s brains and guts, the six-legged-head metamorphosed. Bulbs of flesh molded new shapes on its face. Bones broke and reset to alter curvatures. It was a nightmare claymation, a freakish Rob Bottin manufacture.

I grasped its metamorphic purpose; it was turning its face into Danny’s.

By the time it slurped up the dregs of Danny’s insides, the face had completely changed into his. Its proboscis shucked itself free of the swollen puncture wound in Danny’s skull. My date’s dead body was shrunken, drained of its every wet drop.

The six-legged-head noticed me, as if I’d only just appeared. It approached my corner in a mutant hexapod gait. Once beside me, it looked down. I looked up and saw the top of the head almost touch ceiling tiles.

“I from KCGA.” The six-legged-head spoke in Danny’s voice. I started crying. “Neighborly is giving eggs,” it said. “You happiness with eggs. You loving eggs?”

I covered my mouth to blunt what would soon be hiccuping sobs. I tried not to make noise. It was right there. God, that thing was right there. And Danny’s voice…

“I—I—” My voice came from my body but still startled me. I was flooded with existential anxiety—had the six-legged-head penetrated my flesh, too—had it infected my brain—was I only a host dreaming my parasite’s dreams?

It spoke louder and chittered. Under Danny’s voice was a noisy, burbling sludge like food through a gassy gut. “You are happiness inside eggs. Are neighboring? HAPPY EGGS?”

“Yes. Yes, I am very happy with the eggs,” I managed while bearing down on my weeping.

The six-legged-head seemed to think this over for a minute. It spoke: “Eggs is community. Eggs is neighbors and neighborly. Eggs is friendly and are gooding. You will to buying more eggs?”

“Yes. Yes, I’ll buy more eggs, I swear.” I looked around for my purse. Did I have cash? Is that what it wanted? I could go to the… (Oh. Oh!) I thought of something. “I just—I have to go to the bank to get money to pay you,” I said.

The six-legged-head began processing this. As it worked out my proposal, it spoke its thoughts aloud, “Bank are money. Money are giving KCGA. KCGA god of peoples. Eggs is KCGA. Money is going to for eggs. Ex—ex—ex—”

“Exchange?” I said.

The six-legged-head blew dumb forced laughter out its mouth, like a grade-schooler guffawing at an incomprehensible joke about political economy. Its laughter stopped with sudden violence. “Eggs are money exchange. Eggs is money, are money is KCGA. Money is god of peoples.” It leaned over me, scrutinizing my face with a stupid but penetrating gaze. “Bank are where?”

I pointed toward the door. “In town.”

“Money are bank?”

I nodded. “Yes. The money is in the bank.”

It bent one of its spidery legs and scratched the neckless underside of its head-body. I don’t know if it was actually thinking or aping a gesture it had seen a thinking creature make. “You go bank?” it said.

“Yes. I go bank.”

It skittered back a few steps, and opened a clear path toward the front door. It turned to look at that point of egress, then turned to look back at me. “Eggs is money and are KCGA, god of all peoples. You are going to bank.”

I didn’t know what it wanted me to do. I didn’t move.

“GO,” the head said, much louder, with force.

I didn’t need any more prompting than that. I got to my feet, careful to make no sudden movements. I tip-toed passed the six-legged-head with as wide a berth as I could give.

As soon as I was at my door, I ran.

•

When I came back with the police, there was no evidence of any of the things I claimed had happened. There was no blood on my living room carpet, no six-legged-head, no egg carton in the trash from the KCGA. No Danny’s body. Nothing; all of it, gone.

I was warned that I needed to cut back on the sauce. EMS came and checked me out, asked me how many quarters make up a dollar and who the President was. They said that maybe I was a little too drunk, but that I was still lucid. 

I saw one of the EMTs nod his head at me sideways while he talked to one of the cops.

The cop came over and asked me a bunch of questions. They were all roundabout, secondary queries. What he was really asking was: Are you now, or have you ever been, a drunken lunatic spinster?

The cop decided the answer was probably yes; I was cited for the misdemeanor crime of “False Alarm or Report”.

I sought psychological counseling—you tend not to believe your own eyes when something happens like what I’ve precedingly described. I thought it couldn’t hurt.

After a week or so, I got a call from Earl asking if I’d seen Danny. I told him we’d gone out and I told him that I told the cops, too. And I left it at that. 

When Earl sees me in the grocery store now, he gets a look on his face like he’s smelling shit. Then he turns and walks the other way. I wouldn’t be surprised if he wanted to kill me.

•

A month later, there was a carton of eggs waiting on my doorstep when I got home from work. There was a note tied to the carton, knotted to it with twine:

“Enjoy the latest batch. Please remit payment at your convenience.

“-Your Friends at the KCGA”

Ours is a friendly town with friendly people.
