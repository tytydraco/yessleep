Not all cases have a happy ending. You might think that surviving with permanent mental scars or being forcefully committed to psychiatric facilities for the things you've seen is bad, but I can assure you, those are our best case scenarios. Our happy endings. In my line of work I report about deaths more than I do about life, it just comes with the job and you easily desensitize yourself from it. Especially when it's the deaths of strangers, as horrible as it might sound to some. Sentimentality is seldom a quality that one can afford when working for the M.A.D.

Unfortunately — or fortunately for the victim, depending on the circumstances — a lot of the anomalies we handle here are dangerous, purposefully or not. Extremely so. We, at M.A.D, have seen the names and circumstances of many who died as a direct result of being exposed to one anomaly or another. We have also seen many field agents perish in the line of duty trying to assess, monitor or contain said anomalies. Those deaths are harder to swallow. A fact I had to learn very early on in my career.

You may still think me a crazy person, a silly little writer with silly little ideas laughing behind my keyboard thinking 'ah, that'll scare them'. That's okay. I have accepted long before I started this endeavour that this would be the case. But for those of you who believe — those who simply have even a sparkle of doubt about the veracity of my reports — I implore you once again to be careful, be mindful, to avoid poking at any weird or strange occurrences you might come across in your vicinity, no matter how overwhelming your morbid curiosity might be and, most of all, to contact me promptly if you think you might be experiencing an anomaly.

If you do not do it for your own well-being and safety, at least do it to save some of us from having to lie to unsuspecting families whose grief will never end because we're unable to offer them the truth about the deaths of our agents, leaving them forever in the dark about the real purpose and demise of their loved ones.

As I've said, most cases don't have a happy ending, but you can choose for yours to be in this minority. Gods know not everyone — including the subject of the case file I'll share today — is offered this luxury.

The anomaly henceforth designated as 'Vigilia Arborum' has been under preliminary observation since initial reports in 2004 from local authorities regarding inexplicable disturbances in \[REDACTED\] National Forest, a remote area with minimal human activity.

Originating in the 1970s, the anomaly was first suspected after a series of watchtower personnel mysteriously disappeared or were found disoriented and incoherent. The incidents, sprinkled over the span of a few decades, were few and far between, enough for it to be labelled as "occupational hazard" for a long period of time since it is not infrequent for the isolation of the deep woods to prove too unsettling for most. We have been able to glean details from the very few rangers who have been found throughout the years, however most of them had become too incoherent by that point for even our specialists to uncover detailed accounts.

The most notable phenomenon we've been able to extrapolate from their disjointed narratives thus far are as follows: mentions of 'whispers in trees', indistinct humanoid figures only visible in one's peripheral vision, strange auditory phenomena of unknown kind or origin, area's topography differing wildly from maps of the surroundings and a recurring visual phenomenon including but not limited to sky distortion and unfamiliar star patterns.

In 2016, a containment team (comprised of Containment Team Leader \[REDACTED\], Senior Investigator \[REDACTED\], and Support Specialist \[REDACTED\]) was finally officially dispatched in the area to install additional surveillance in order to attempt to ascertain whether or not the Directorate's actions was indeed needed, or if past incidents were mere coincidences, unrelated to any anomalous behavior. The team was unsuccessful in fully isolating the anomaly's pattern, as it appears to manifest at varying intervals and responds unpredictably to human intervention. Although it was impossible to initiate a proper containment effort according to protocol in the conditions at the time, this team's effort gave us enough insight to officially categorize the \[REDACTED\] National Forest as harboring a metaphysical anomaly to be monitored.

Proper understanding, classification and subsequent containment of said anomaly, however, was postponed until this year due to the anomaly remaining mostly inactive, with seemingly no new incidents reported or witnessed by the surveillance team or the very limited amount of people working as the \[REDACTED\] National Forest rangers alike. One said event finally took place this past week, leading to an official containment attempt on August 14th of this year.

The following is the documented account from one Ethan \[REDACTED\], the newly appointed ranger who was stationed in the \[REDACTED\] Watchtower at the time. His audio logs, found in his watchtower after his disappearance, were paramount in providing the insight Containment Division needed to act and are an endless source of information for the Research Division to analyze, thus remaining in our hands at Site-16 until further notice.

Uh... okay. This is Ranger Ethan \[REDACTED\], recording my first log at \[REDACTED\] Watchtower. (laughter) It's a little weird talking to myself like that, can't say that was a thing in my old post... (clears throat) Oh, uh... It's about 4:30 PM, just getting settled in here. The weather’s pretty clear for now, but they’re calling for some heavy rain later tonight. The digs aren't too bad though and I'm alone for the next week, so it’s just me and the view.

Seems like a nice enough spot. Gotta admit though, it's a little... quieter than I expected. My last job was as a park ranger in— (short silence) Okay who cares about that, the point is: I'm used to the woods, nature and all that. But there I always had at least one or two mates working with me, always on comms and all. Hard to imagine it being *this* quiet all the time... (long silence then laughter) Well I did say I wanted a more slow-paced reassignment, so I guess I hit the nail on the head, eh?

Anyway, everything’s set up—radio's working fine, supervisor already radioed in earlier, visibility is good so far, no sign of anything down there or nothing. I’ll check in again later if the rain starts causing problems. Over.

This is Ranger Ethan again, reporting from \[REDACTED\] Watchtower. It's 10:28 PM, and boy is it pouring! Not really a big deal though, just making sure everything's still in place. Radio still working just fine, nothing's blown away or fell off, so everything's good. It's pitch dark out so between that and the rain, the visibility is shit now, obviously. At least it'll be hard to miss if a tree somehow catches fire right now, right? (laughter) Kind of creepy, being here at night, I'm not gonna lie. In my old job I'd do my shift and mosey on back home for some shut-eye. Here it's just me and my good ol' buddy the forest, 24/7.

Gonna take me a hot second to stop jumping at every little sound, I reckon. (laughter) Anywho, I'm going to try and get some rest. Hopefully I'll manage to get a few hours of sleep despite this blasted rain banging on the roof. I'll report in the morning for my first scan of the land. Over and out.

Good morning. Ranger Ethan here, from \[REDACTED\] Watchtower. It’s... 7:14 AM, and, uh, the rain’s finally let up. It kept on hammering all night. I love the rain but hell that caused one damned ruckus hitting the tower's roof. Managed to sleep, probably not enough but oh well, not like I'm at risk of mistaking one tree for another because of sleep deprivation. (laughter)

I'm currently out a mile and a half north from base, taking the lay of the land. Everything down below looks fine from what I can see, though there’s a lot of mist rolling through the trees. Normal, I guess, with all the rain we had last night, but it’s thicker than I’d like. Makes it harder to do a proper scan of the area. I haven't seen any signs of human activity or risk areas as of yet. Not much else to report for now though. Guess I was right to bank on this location to be cozier than my last!

Oh, wait. Actually, there’s... something. I noticed earlier—just before I started this log, I mean. There’s this weird... patch, kind of? (pause) I walked into a clearing that I didn't see on the map. I double checked to be sure but it might be that my map is outdated since nobody has been posted here in a while. Anyway, it was down about, uh... southeast from base. Maybe a quarter-mile out or so, I'd say? I don't know if there was an unreported self-contained fire there or what, but the ground was all bare and dead-looking. Nothing too weird, wouldn't have a job if fire never happened around here, right? (chuckle)

I’ll keep an eye on it, but it’s probably nothing. Just looked... odd in all the mist, you know? (sigh) I'll report it to my supervisor once I'm back at base and I’ll do my first proper hike tomorrow, get a closer look around to see if anything else hasn't been marked on my map. Over and out.

Hey, it’s Ethan. 4:37 PM, third day on the job. The mist from yesterday is pretty much cleared up, so I was able to get a better look around. That patch? Yeah, it’s still there. Bare dirt, no grass, no trees, just this weird dead space in the middle of the forest. I called it in to my supervisor yesterday, and she said she’d check the maps, but... (long pause) I don't like the look of it, I— (pause) I don't know, I think I'm just being a big baby, the solitude must be getting to me. (chuckle)

Other than that, things are still quiet. Too quiet, honestly. I was expecting to at least hear some wildlife, but I don't think I can remember hearing even one bird since I got here. Damn I know this place is super remote, but I didn't think it'd be too far out for even animals to come visit. (weak chuckle) Hell even the crickets are quiet. Not that I can complain about that, those things can make more noise than the rain on the roof the other day when they want to... Real talk though? (pause) It's giving me the creeps.

Anyway, nothing's on fire so technically it's a win for me, right? I'll keep you updated if I hear anything from the supervisor about that patch. Over and out.

Uh... Ethan again. 2:12 AM. I... wasn’t planning to record anything tonight, but... (long pause) Look, I know it's just the trees and all, but it scared the shit out of me when it started happening.

I keep hearing this... knocking. It's not like a branch hitting the wall once either. More like... Wait. (pause) There, can you hear it. (knock. knock. knock. knock.) It's... steady. Four knocks, pause, four knocks, pause. It's been like that on and off for 15 minutes. I don't think anything is hitting the tower, like a piece of the antenna that fell out or something like that. It sounds like it's coming directly from somewhere in the trees. I tried shining my flashlight down there, but I couldn’t see a damn thing.

The weirdest part? It sounds like it’s coming from that bare patch. Like, the direction matches up perfectly. I’m probably overthinking it, but... it’s weird. Really weird. (sigh) Note to myself, never watch horror movies again once this assignment is over, it's clearly making me paranoid. Gonna try to get some sleep. Over and out.

Morning. 8:30 AM. It’s Ethan. My supervisor got back to me about that weird dead patch last night, she said she couldn't see it on any map and couldn't find record of any fire that could damage the area since the maps were last updated either. So I hiked out to the clearing today. Needed to see it up close. I figured, maybe it’s just some erosion or, I don’t know, a natural sinkhole. But... it doesn't look like it. (sigh)

The ground there? It’s not just bare—it’s charred. Like something burned the entire patch down to nothing, except there no signs of spreading. Just... scorched earth. I don't know who fumbled the bag on this one but if it was an unreported fire it's just too... (pause) neat. I'd bank on something man-made, for sure. Maybe someone used to squat the forest back when it wasn't being monitored?

Oh. On the subject of the weird lack of wildlife. I found something, too. Uh, I don’t really know how to describe it, but it looked like... a handprint? Not human, though. Way too big, and too elongated too, with something like... claws, maybe? Can't say I've ever seen that kind of markings before, and I was a *great* boy-scout.(forced chuckle) I'm calling this in again once I'm at base. Supervisor's going to think I'm a pain in her ass, but I'd rather that than have nightmares thinking there's some weird fantasy creature out there. Over and out.

Okay, so, uh... it’s Ethan again. 11:47 PM. I’m not sure how to start this one. (deep breath) It might be the quiet or the dark that's starting to make me a little nuts but I— (knock. knock. knock. knock.) I think something is wrong. The knocking? It’s back. It's louder now. Closer. And I swear to God, I saw... something when I got back from my nightly sweep of the era earlier, right before the knocking started. Just for a second, out of the corner of my eye. Near the tree line. It wasn’t an animal. It was... tall. Way taller than any person has a right to be, and... (shaky breath) its arms were too... long.

I tried radioing. I don't know what for. Help? Company? Anything to remind me I'm still sane. But the signal’s dead. The radio’s been working fine all week, and now it’s just static. Maybe... (pause) Maybe the antenna got knocked down by a bird or something. A very fucking quiet bird that hasn't made a sound in 6 days. (deep breath) I'll check in the morning, there's no way I'm going back out tonight.

I’ve locked the door. I know it's stupid, there's nobody but me and a couple hundred trees out there, but it's the only way I have to make me feel safe... And even that isn't working great right now. So much for a cozy assignment, I'm already seeing things in the dark like a damn rookie. Hopefully some sleep will screw my head on straight. (pause) Hopefully I don't see more things that aren't there. Over and out.

(whisper) Ethan. 3:28 AM. (shaky breathing) I don’t know what to do. The knocking I could explain but... It’s not just knocking anymore. It’s like... footsteps. Heavy ones. Circling the tower. I’m staying up here. I’m not going down there. I’m not. I know it's my job to check for people messing around in the woods but... it's not people. I don't think. I don't... know. There's... (voice breaks) There’s something... at the edge of the clearing. Watching me. Just... standing there. It’s been there for hours now. It's not moving. It's not an animal, it's... (deep breath) It's not a tree either. Or maybe it's a tree, I don't— (knock. knock. knock. knock)

I don’t know what it is, but I feel like... if I look at it too long, it’ll notice me. Really notice me.. Fuck I must be losing my mind, I haven't slept properly in days but... You're hearing it too, right? The recording is picking it up, it's not all in my head, it's not... (long pause) I don't know how much longer I can do this...

Ethan. 10:12 PM. I didn’t sleep. I don’t even know if I *can* sleep anymore. Every time I close my eyes, I see... it. That thing. Standing in the clearing. Except now... now it’s not just standing there. It’s closer. I mean, not physically—at least, I don’t think so. But it feels closer... (sigh) It doesn't even make sense when I say it, shit. I try looking for it during the day time but it's not there. It only appears when the sun set and the knocking starts.

The knocking hasn’t stopped. It’s been going for hours, constant now. Not just from the clearing anymore—it’s all around the tower. Sometimes it’s above me, from the roof, the sky, sometimes below, right under the base's floor. It doesn’t make sense. There’s nothing there, I checked and checked but I can hear it. I can... (long pause) I can *feel* it.

I tried the radio again. Still nothing. The static sounds... different, though. I think there's a voice in it... Somehow I just... **know** it's not the supervisor. I don't want to listen to it, it... it's (shaky breath) worse than the knocking or the footsteps. (static) But the radio isn't turning off anymore. God, what is happening out here?

The door was locked. I know it was locked.

I grabbed the axe from the supply closet and I waited by the door. Maybe... Maybe it was the *thing* coming to finish me off, I don't know... But when I opened it, there was no one there. Just... nothing.

Except now... I swear I can hear breathing. It’s faint, but it’s there. It's behind me. In the room with me.

Four long, parallel gashes, like... like claw marks. Big *fucking* claw marks... Did I do that? Did... did *it* do that?

I finally went back to the clearing a few minutes ago, I... I couldn't be in the tower anymore, it... I needed to get away from it for a while. (rustling) The patch, it looks different now. It's... moving. Like it's breathing. I swear I feel like I'm losing my mind, I saw it ripple! Like... Like something underneath wanted to get out.

The remains of Ethan \[REDACTED\] were discovered in the center of the aforementioned 'dead patch' on August 14th, his body — or what remained of it — appeared to be in a grotesque and disturbing state. His skin, bones and most of his organs were partially fused with the scorched soil, slowly melting or merging *into* it. Most alarmingly, his entire facial skin had been removed and hung from a nearby tree, stretched unnaturally as if displayed like a mask. It is, as of yet, unclear if this was the act of an external entity as a part of the anomaly, or if the anomaly pushed Mr. \[REDACTED\] to peel the skin off himself before or during the first stages of assimilating his body. Fragments of his internal organs — such as one eyeball, half of his liver and a few segments of his large intestine — were scattered across the clearing in a manner inconsistent with any known animal predation making it easy to theorize this, too, was an active result of the anomaly's effect.

The containment efforts were entrusted to Containment Team Foxtrot, led by \[REDACTED\]. In a particularly rare turn of event, our esteemed Lead Researcher, Professor \[REDACTED\] asked to accompany the team on the field, as his specialization in Vegetal Patterns and Behaviors in Exoteric-type Anomalies was particularly well suited to assist with the security of the team and their understanding of this mostly undocumented anomalous terrain. However, upon entering the "dead patch," the team encountered an unexpected and highly aggressive response from the anomaly. Distorted sounds resembling voices emanated from the surrounding trees, which began to exude a sap-like substance that chemically burned the team's equipment and skin upon contact.

Despite extensive preparation, the anomaly reacted with unprecedented violence at M.A.D presence within itself. Professor \[REDACTED\] and one Containment Team Foxtrot member, Sergeant \[REDACTED\] were killed during the operation, the latter succumbing to injuries after being struck by what appeared to be sharpened and bloody wooden growths that erupted from the forest floor. Professor \[REDACTED\]'s final notes, recovered from his partially melted equipment, described "vegetative sentience exhibiting predatory territoriality" and hypothesized the anomaly's ability to "repurpose organic material".

The nature and inherent workings of the metaphysical anomaly henceforth known as 'Vigilia Arborum' are still up for theorization. One leading hypothesis is that the anomaly represents a form of semi-sentient symbiosis between the watchtower and the surrounding woods, wherein the tower itself serves as a beacon 'marking' the victim that is to be, subsequently, subsumed into the anomaly's ecosystem as was demonstrated by the state Ethan \[REDACTED\]'s body was found in. Moreover, analysis of the 'dead patch' soil revealed a unique composition of organic matter interspersed with high levels of unidentified enzymes, suggesting a rapid decomposition and absorption process. The sap-like substance observed during containment attempts appeared to be chemically similar to cerebrospinal fluid, raising questions about the integration of previous victims' biological components into the anomaly’s structure.

Further research is constrained due to the lethal nature of the anomaly. An operational perimeter has been established around the watchtower and the \[REDACTED\] National Forest site as a whole, with no personnel permitted within a 10-mile radius. Despite the localized, unmoving state of the metaphysical anomaly, its' Exoteric nature make it impossible for Containment Team to safely and discreetly destroy it in its' entirety. Therefore containment is maintained but fragile, requiring near-constant monitoring to ensure hikers and passerbys don't stumble into its center. *Only* preventive measures are tolerated, any and all field operations involving the 'Vigilia Arborum' beyond that are indefinitely suspended pending further analysis.
