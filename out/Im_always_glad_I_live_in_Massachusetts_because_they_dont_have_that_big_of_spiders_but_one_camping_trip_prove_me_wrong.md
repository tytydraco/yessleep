I am a huge arachnaphobe, to the point I have once slepted on the couch because a spider was next to my bed. But I don't want to rant for too long because I see how long no sleep stories can be. 

My brother invited me to a camping trip in a cabin in the middle of the fucking woods. I watch and read a lot of horror media, my favorite being mrballen (not sponsored). I brought along my other friend I will call Fred for this story. So me, my brother, and Fred all went camping for 5 days, but it was cut short after 2. 

When we got to the cabin, I had an off feeling, and that should have been the main sign to get the fuck out of there. I told them about the bad feeling but they pressured me to stay because my brother paid for it and it would be fine. I didn't want to be rude so I stayed, BIG FUCKING MISTAKE.

I soon as I settled in the room, there was a nickel sized spider on the wall. I am too scared to kill spiders ever so I just avoided it at all costs. The rest of the day went without incident. We went for a walk, made a fire, other camping stuff, etc. The next day gave more signs I should have left.

When I woke up there were 3 quarter sized spiders on the window, but not on the inside thankfully. There was also periodically a scurrying in the walls, but I just brushed it off and continued the trip. Again, big mistake.

The next morning, I woke up at 3am to a scream. I walk out of the room to see my brother looking at something.  Before I explain what he was looking at, the room we slept in was at the end of a hall that led to a living room, and my brother was at the end of this hallway, and I couldn't see what he was looking at. I walk down the hallway to see what was going on.

"Hey, why'd you scream? What's going on?"

"Look"

I turn the corner and there is the biggest fucking spider I have ever seen. This thing was not just like a huntsman spider, it was the size of a fucking person, and I know, because it was right next to a cocooned person, Fred. This thing looked like a huntsman spider, with a hairy body and legs. It was still, but it was alive because it was laying EGGS, this will be important, and it was laying like 1 per second, and they didn't look like regular spider eggs, more like snake or bird eggs. 

I couldn't move, I felt as if it had stuck me to the floor. But what really got me and my brother going, was the eggs hatching. 3 off the eggs starting hatching, letting out 3 quarter sized spiders, just like the ones on the window. We watched as the spiders, over the course of 5 minutes, turn from quarter sized, to huntsman spider size. Then multiple of eggs started hatching, and we also realized that there were like 50 other eggs already hatched. 

My senses came back to me as I grabbed my brother and we rushed back to the room, because the spider was right next to the door, so we would have to go out by window. We started grabbing our things and getting ready to leave, as we see that the windows are covered in spiders, each one having like 20 mini spiders and 1 huntsman spider. The windows were now off limits. I could hear lots of scattering all around the cabin, meaning they had covered the area. I walked back into the living room to see if there were any other way to get out, but I made a horrifying discovery. 

There were 3 more of the human sized spiders and multiple huntsman sized spiders. I noped the fuck out back to the room and my brother has a plan. He will throw his suitcase out the window and jump out of it, and then I will jump out after him. After some preparing and praying, we were ready. He through the suitcase at the window with all his might, shattering the glass, sending the spiders flying. He jumps out, followed by me. Luckily, no spiders got onto either of us. I turn around and flash a light onto the house to find the outside is absolutely covered in spiders, and a few of the human sized ones. 

I immediately started calling 911, but I stopped when multiple trucks and helicopters appeared. The whole house is light on fire, killing all of the spiders. Two dudes in suits brought us to a truck and used this weird divice to scan us and all he said was "All good". I still do not know what the fuck that was supposed to mean, what if I wasn't good!?! 

After a bit of sitting there watching the cabin burn down, the same dudes came over with two suitcases that was 1 million dollars in each suit case. They gave them to use and a contract that stated to never tell anyone about what happened that night or there would be consequences. 

We don't know who they were, what they were doing, why they took care of the spiders, I am still so confused. My theory is that this is the government or a secret corporation experimenting on spiders and other animals and this fast growing spider escapes the lab and they tracked them down. Thank God we escaped because if we didn't escape in time, they would have burnt the cabin down with us in it. 

I told them about Fred and how he had been cocooned, and they said they would take care of it. The next day, it was announced he had died after falling of a cliff. We went with it in fear of the consequences.

The only reason I am telling this is because I just have to let this of my chest and I just have to pray that they don't see this.

Although I have gained a million dollars, I have lost a good friend, and now have severe trauma. Stay safe in Massachusetts, and listen to your bad feelings.
