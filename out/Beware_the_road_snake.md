The time: sometime after dark.

The place: I don’t know.

In all honesty, I truly wish I could tell you where this all happened. Maybe then you could stay away from what ever that was, or at least be prepared to face it in a way that I wasn’t able to.

First, some history, I’ve been wandering the wilderness and backroads for years. I grew up in an extremely abusive house. Early on, I wandered out, and simply decided to never look back. From there, I simply just kept wandering, and wandering, spending years, all my life, wandering. 

Wandering for what, to what, I don’t know. All I know is that it was sometime midfall that I stopped wandering, and started running. Running for my life.

The door jingled as I pushed it open. The cashier greeted me cheerfully as I walked through the door. Of course, I knew I wasn’t going to be there very long. Normally I’d just buy essentials like firestarters or flashlights, or batteries with money I get cooking meals for other travelers, but winter was coming up, which meant convenience store non-perishables. 

As I was checking out my many, many pop tarts, the cashier had started going off about some strange events in the outside roads, missing people, but I wasn’t really paying attention. It was pretty standard on some of these backroads. Unexperienced fools decide to go hiking on a whim, and then accidents happen. I should have listened.

Halfway to the road, I started to get a certain feeling. I can’t really explain it to you well, and I hadn’t felt it below or since, but if I had to try, it’s like a pressure change. Like something big was coming. And oh boy, something BIG was coming. 

This mysterious pressure feeling stuck with me for hours after, until a little after sundown. Then, something hit me. It started as a bad headache, that sense of pressure mounting and mounting, slowly making my head hurt more and more. Then it became a stomach ache to, a gut wrenching stomachs ache. In a soft panic, I began fumbling a bottle of purified water I had on me, and chugged the whole thing, and when that didn’t stop the excruciating pain of the “pressure migraine” 

Then, I noticed it. The noise. 

It started faint, only a rustle, but by the time I noticed it, it was getting louder and louder, with the momentum of a freight train. 

Quickly, I turned around, facing down the road, I saw it. First, it was glinting in the night, then something else started glittering, and then I saw its teeth.

At first, I didn’t know what I was looking at, but once it started getting closer, I realized what those two huge pale shapes were. Teeth. And I swear, I was looking at a giant snake, big enough to cover the entire two lane road, and tall enough I couldn’t see the top of the creature. 

Suddenly, I’m jolted out of my trance, and a bolt to the side of the road, with no time to spare. Turning to look at the snake as it passed, I observed it, maybe for only a second. I saw what I assumed to be its eyes, staring forward, uninterested. Then it was gone, like it didn’t care what, or who, it swallowed up. 

Then, just like that, it’s head was gone, and the rest of the smooth light brown scales of the snake started rushing past, and in that split second, I turned around back in the direction the snake came from, and there were the wolves. Huge, ravenous, and at least 5 feet tall, and in another split second, they were tossed into the air by a huge air wave, carrying not only them I to the air, but me as well.

By the time I came back to conciousness, the tail of the snake was nearly gone, only a foot or two high, and the end was in sight, but I had no time to dwell on my crushed goods and bruised bones, because the wolves were out here, and so was the snake. At least now I knew better than to travel those roads again.
