This is one of the more fucked up things I’ve faced. Obviously I made it out okay, but not everyone else did.

----------------

When I signed up to be a Marine, I had fantasies of becoming some sort of badass Rambo, capable of killing any and all who dared piss me off. What the movies never detail is the emotional trauma that comes with being successful at that particular line of work, and how we can never just walk away from it.

Case in point: [my team and I had just killed two people by setting them on fire](https://redd.it/yt6yef). At least, I *think* they were people, or had been at some point. They exploded in the sun, and had turned one of my team and the little girl we were saving into whatever they were, so I guess that made them vampires?

And they could fly. I didn’t know if vampires were supposed to fly, but that particular slice of shit had been carved up and served on my plate, so that was that. After the first two died, someone creeped up the stairs while we waited at the top. 

“The trick worked,” the little monster girl whispered as the footsteps moved closer. “That’s my father, and his whole plan was to trap you. Put away your guns, they can’t save you now.”

Mike and I didn’t drop our guns, because we don’t always take combat advice from children. 

But as those footsteps got nearer, a species of previously unknown fear danced on each of my vertebrae, one by one, like an oversized spider picking its way along my bones. 

“She’s right,” a voice called from below. “You weren’t recruited for your intelligence, but even men of your limited aptitude must realize that the current circumstances are far beyond your ability to control.” 

The man’s head appeared over the bannister as he rose, one step at a time, into view. His pale white skin contrasted sharply with his ebony, slicked-back hair. The family resemblance was striking; he looked like what his daughter would be if she were a forty-year-old man who habitually pissed on his own bathroom floor as a way of judging which housekeepers moved fast enough to avoid punishment.

Mike and I kept our sights on him as he moved into the shadows of the third floor. We both wordlessly understood that we wouldn’t fire on him, at least not yet; he was three steps ahead of us and likely had more men lurking where we couldn’t see them. We didn’t want to play our last card quite yet. 

“I hired you because someone I trust told me that you were the best,” he continued, looking both serpentine and douche-nozzley all at once. Each hair stayed in place as he cocked his head. “This is a situation that you won’t escape on your own terms. I’d like you to work for me, and only me. Undoubtedly, you’re practical men. Bear in mind that it is against my best interests to keep you alive if you decline.”

“What are you going to do to your daughter?” Mike grunted.

The man looked down on her and wrinkled his nose. She crawled farther into the shadows. “Unimportant to you,” he sneered.

I held my aim steady. “We agreed to remove her from harm,” I snapped. “We’re going to do that, no matter who might be hurting her.” 

He scowled. “So bed it,” he huffed.

Then he pulled an enormous dagger with a cruel-looking, wavy blade from inside his jacket pocket and crossed through the shadows toward the cowering little girl. 

I realized, with a sudden start, that the guy apparently made a habit of carrying a fucked up weapon capable of killing his own kind. 

His own *daughter.*

I try to avoid pissing off clients, but I figured we were already out of the $191,300 we’d been promised, and I really don’t like child-killers. So I dropped the M4 and lunged at the unsuspecting man as he passed. He yelled as I wrapped my arms around his waist from behind and lifted his skinny frame, dodging frantic swipes with his weird-ass knife.

I staggered toward the sunlight, knowing that I only had to avoid his attacks for the three seconds it would take me to drag the fucker out of the shadows. With an almighty heave, I pulled us both into the warm splash of morning light now illuminating the center of the room, falling to the ground with him in my arms.

“What the *fuck*?” He spat, writhing as sunlight washed over his body.

And…

Nothing happened. 

I looked up at the man, his head now encircled by a halo of sunlight.

“Wait – did you think I would catch fire in the sun?” he asked, pressing the blade against my neck as he rolled to position me between Mike’s gun and him. “You know I’m human, right?”

I stared at him with gritted teeth, feeling Mike’s tension as he stood behind me with no clear shot at the man. I swallowed once, my Adam’s apple scraping painfully against the blade held tight against my skin. My heart rate slowed; I’ve trained my subconscious to focus when shit hits the fan, and this was an especially shitty, fanny moment. 

Before he could speak, both of us turned our eyes to his shoulder. 

Data had changed. He was paper-white and skeletal as he shambled toward us from the shadows.

“Coming to save your friend, are you?” the man asked, pushing the blade even closer. I felt the warm slickness of blood on my skin. “Perhaps you think you can turn me with a bite?” He threw out a high-pitched laugh that sounded like it came from someone doing it for the very first time. “Go ahead. Turning will only make me stronger, and he’ll be dead before you reach me.” He pressed the dagger closer still. “Your best choice – your *only* choice – is to do as I say.”

Data is the least confrontational of the three of us, but he’s got a thing about being patronized. I think he played a lot of Dragons and Dungeons in high school and got picked on a lot. At any rate, he chose that moment to lunge. 

But he didn’t bite the dickhead’s neck. Instead, his newfound fangs sunk deep into the man’s arm, right between the radius and ulna, and he dropped the knife. The two of them staggered into the shadows as I jumped for the M4 I’d left on the ground. I wheeled around, only to find that Data was now in between me and my target. 

“Idiot,” the man breathed, “even a bite on the arm will turn me and make me more powerful. You haven’t saved your friend, you’ve only-”

He couldn’t talk any more after that, because Data took a giant bite of his neck and pulled out the man’s larynx. You need a larynx to speak, so he just kind of gurgled and flopped around. I guess Data was hungry *and* pissed, because he jumped in and started chomping down on that neck like it was chunky shrimp burrito that flopped open like someone had dropped it on the floor. 

By the time Data was done, the man’s lifeless head was only attached to his body by a few boney, sinewy shards. I stared at my friend, who was now totally unrecognizable. His sunken eyes were dark against his pallid skin, he looked ten pounds lighter than he had a minute ago, and a pint of blood, drool, and gristle hung from his crimson lips. 

A chill froze every muscle in my body as I realized that I might not be safe from my own friend.

*tap tap tap*

We looked across the room.

“That’s my mother,” whispered Laney, who had been silent as we killed her father. “She’s much more dangerous than my dad, and she’s [floating outside the window](https://www.facebook.com/P-F-McGrail-181784199029462/).”
