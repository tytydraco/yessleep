 

My name is John and I'm the smartest student in my school. But that doesn't mean I have it easy. I'm constantly bullied by my classmates because of my intelligence. School is a place of misery for me. I was constantly picked on and made fun of by the other kids.

I walked down the street, listening to my music when I noticed an old man with a mischievous smile on his face. He was wearing a long, black coat and had a hood pulled up over his head. He was standing in the middle of the sidewalk, just staring off into the distance. I stopped and stared at him for a moment, wondering what he was doing there. Then he turned and looked right at me. "What are you looking at kid?" he asked in a gruff voice. I was taken aback by his sudden question. "Um, nothing," I stammered. "I was just walking to school." He nodded slowly and then said, "Be careful out there, have you heard the story about the forgotten diary of the devil?"

"No, I haven't," I said. "What's it about?" The old man chuckled. "It's said that long ago, the devil wrote down all of his secrets in a diary. But then he lost it, and no one has seen it since. Some say it's still out there, waiting to be found." I was intrigued. "Do you think it's real?" The old man shrugged. "Who knows? But if you ever find it, make sure you don't open it. The devil's secrets are not meant for mortal eyes." He winked at me and then walked away, leaving me with my thoughts. I continued on my way to school, wondering if the forgotten diary of the devil really existed.

I mean, how could something like that even exist? It seemed like something out of a horror movie. But then I started to think about it more and more. What if it was real? What if there was a diary out there that contained all the secrets of the devil? It seemed too crazy to be true, but I couldn't help but wonder.

Suddenly I heard a loud crash. I looked up to see a truck had hit a man crossing the street. He was lying on the ground, motionless. I ran over to him, my heart pounding.

"Are you okay?" I asked, kneeling down beside him. He didn't answer. I looked around for help, but no one else was around. I noticed something had fallen out of his pocket. It was a book.

It had a black cover with a red pentagram on it. I was both scared and intrigued. I had never seen anything like this before. I reached out and grabbed the book, and as soon as I did, I felt a chill run down my spine. I knew that this was no ordinary book. It was a diary, but not just any diary. It was the Devil's Diary.

I quickly picked it up and put it in my bag, not wanting anyone else to see it.

I stayed with the man until the ambulance arrived and took him away. As I watched them drive away, I wondered what was in the book and why he had been carrying it with him.

I shuddered at the thought and quickened my pace. I knew that whatever secrets were hidden in this book were not meant for me to know. But still, I couldn't help but feel a strange sense of curiosity as I continued on my way to school.

I was running late for school and I was already feeling the pressure. I had to get to class before the bell rang or else I'd be in trouble. As I rushed through the school doors, I could feel my heart pounding in my chest. I was walking down the hallway, trying to get to my classroom as quickly as possible, when I felt a sudden jolt. I had bumped into someone with my backpack. "Hey, watch where you're going!" a voice shouted. I looked up to see the school bully, standing there with a scowl on his face. I gulped. "I'm sorry," I said. "It was an accident." The bully just glared at me. "I want you to know that you better watch your back," Jake said. "I'm gonna beat you up after school today."

I gulped. I knew Jake was serious. He had a reputation for being a tough guy and I didn't want to get on his bad side. "Look, Jake," I said, trying to stay calm. "I don't want any trouble. Can't we just forget about this?" Jake laughed and shook his head. "No way," he said. "You're gonna get what's coming to you." My heart was pounding in my chest as I watched Jake walk away. I knew I had to do something or else he would come after me after school. I had to find a way to stop him.

I sit in my desk, my eyes darting around the room. I can feel the weight of the book in my bag. I know that it's forbidden, but I can't help but be curious.

My teacher is lecturing at the front of the room, but I'm not paying attention. All I can think about is the book. What secrets does it hold? What will happen if I get caught?

I take a deep breath and make a decision. I slowly reach into my bag and pull out the diary. I open it to the first page and start to read.

"If you read this, you will be cursed with a fate worse than death. You will be denied entry to both Heaven and Hell. You will be forever trapped in a state of limbo, unable to move on to the afterlife."

The words were strange and unfamiliar. It was like nothing I had ever read before, and I couldn't help but feel a little scared. The words seemed to be written in a language that was not of this world, and yet somehow I could understand them.

 It seems like it could be a real curse if I do.

After some thought, I've decided to take the plunge and keep reading. Who knows what I'll find?

As I continued to read, I felt my heart racing faster and faster. The words seemed to be describing something dark and sinister, something that made me feel uneasy. I felt like I was being pulled into a world of darkness and evil, and I wasn't sure if I wanted to go any further.

But then something strange happened. The words began to make sense. They seemed to be telling a story about John. He was a strong and courageous man who was always willing to take on any challenge.

One day, John was challenged to a fight by a much bigger and stronger opponent. Knowing that he could not win in a physical fight, John decided to use his wits instead. He quickly removed his shoes and filled them with his s\*it.

When the fight began, John's opponent was taken aback by the sight of John's shoes filled with s\*it. Thinking that John was crazy, he charged forward with all his might. But when he tried to punch John, the hit from s\*it shoes caused him to lose his balance.

John took advantage of this opportunity and quickly pinned his opponent down. After a few minutes of struggling, the opponent finally gave up and conceded defeat.

John had won the fight by using his wits and courage. He had proven that even the smallest of things can be used to great effect if used correctly. From then on, John was known as the brave man who fight by shi\*ting inside his shoes.

That was both fascinating and terrifying at the same time.

I couldn't help but be drawn in by the story, and before long I had finished it. 

I start to feel more confident, knowing that I have a plan now.

I close the book and put it back in to my backpack, feeling ready to take on the bully.

I was walking through the cafeteria,, feeling a little nervous about the fight with the Jake. I was so lost in my thoughts that I didn't even notice my friend Tom walking towards me until he called out my name. "Hey, what's up?" Tom said, giving me a friendly smile. I smiled back, trying to hide my nervousness. "Oh, not much. Just thinking about the fight I have to have later." Tom's eyes widened. "You're fighting someone? Who?" "Jake," I said, feeling my stomach twist into knots. "I got a plan from the devil's book and I'm going to try it out." Tom shook his head. "That's crazy! I want to come and watch." I shook my head. "No way. That's too dangerous." Tom shrugged. "I know, but I want to help you out. I'll hide in the bushes and watch from there. That way, if anything happens, I can jump in and help you out." I hesitated for a moment, then nodded. "Okay, that sounds like a plan." Tom grinned. "Great! I'll see you there." He gave me a quick hug before running off. I watched him go, feeling a little better knowing that he would be there to help me out if anything went wrong.

The rest of the day went fast. After the school I nervously walked into the school parking lot, my heart pounding in my chest. I knew what I had to do, but I was scared. I had to face my bully.

I can feel my heart pounding in my chest as I approach the spot where I know the bully will be waiting. I can already feel the anger and fear bubbling up inside me. My palms are sweaty and my stomach is in knots as I get closer. 

I finally reach the spot where the bully is waiting. I spotted him across the lot, leaning against his car, looking smug and confident. He looks me up and down with a sneer on his face. I try to stay calm. I remind myself that I'm not alone in this fight, and that I have people who care about me and are willing to help me if things get out of hand. The bully starts to say something, but before he can finish, i pull down my pant and start sh\*ting inside my shoe.
