I survived to write my side of things, but not everyone did.

------------

“How much of your family are you willing to lose?” the Leech hissed.

[I struggled against his arms, but the Leech’s grip was firmer than a duck’s watertight asshole](https://redd.it/13t5tbb). My fingers tingled from where they hung helplessly at my side. 

“So you can *choose*, Kim,” the thing gurgled at my wife. She stood still, arms at her sides, the car headlights illuminating her silhouette next to the “Route 1913” signpost. “Give Ella to me, and I let your husband walk away with you. If you take too long to decide, I rip hubby’s torso in half before killing you and taking your daughter.”

Kimmy, my headstrong and very fucking stubborn wife, balked. 

That scared me more than anything. 

I had very recently learned that her boldness was not confined to interior design arguments and BDSM roleplay; she had supernatural abilities that I was only beginning to comprehend. 

Which meant her hesitation revealed she believed, at least in part, that the Leech’s words were true. She knew he might overpower her, and that there was a very realistic chance our daughter was about to be taken no matter what she chose. So I did the only thing that made sense.

“Hey guy,” I huffed. “Are you getting riled up by this thing you’re doing to me and my wife? Because you’re pressing yourself up against my hips, and there is *nothing* subtle about your libido right now.”

“Russ, *please* don’t antagonize him,” Kimmy begged, her voice laced with terror. “Please let me handle this.”

“Oh, I will,” I answered. “Just as soon as I’m done.” Turning to face the Leech, I stared into the darkness of his head.

God *damn*, I wish I hadn’t done that. It was like looking into a kaleidoscope of sadness. His entire face was black, but not because it was shrouded in shadow. The best explanation I can offer is that light couldn’t exist where his head was. I shuddered. 

Closing my eyes, I focused on what I had been saying before. “I might not be able to stop you from shredding my guts, friend, but I’ll be a fucked pig if you think I’m cool with you getting off on the idea.”

He hissed and pulled me tighter still.

Just like I knew he would.

The downside was that I could no longer breathe. The upside was that his erect penis was now pressed into my open palm. 

I grabbed the appendage and twisted like I was trying to open a pickle jar for Kimmy that wouldn’t budge. That actually happened once, and I watched her face go from thinking “my husband can take care of this” to “maybe my infant daughter needs to take over.” 

I realize now that my two-year-old is orders of magnitude stronger than I am, but I did not have this information at the time. 

So I pulled on a depth of strength that I didn’t know I had as I squeezed the pickle jar. The effort resulted in a little shit nugget squirting directly into my underwear, but I got the jar open, so it was worth it. Besides, it was Kimmy’s turn to do the laundry. 

I turned with the same effort now as I twisted the Leech’s ding dong, feeling a blood vessel burst in my eye. 

He dropped me, and I fell to the ground like a sack of wet cement. 

That was all Kimmy needed. I still didn’t understand exactly what she was or what she could do, but I knew she was deadly. 

I felt fire, and I closed my eyes. 

The silence terrified me more than anything, because I knew that one of them had died instantly. Heart racing, I opened my left eye I first, wanting and not wanting to see who remained. 

Warmth spread through me as I saw Kimmy standing over the dark Leech. That warmth turned to hot nausea when I realized she was holding his head like a rotten pumpkin that dripped foul liquid onto his decapitated body below. I’ve been with Kimmy long enough to know that I need to give her space when she’s angry, so I crawled back toward the car to check on Ella. Propping myself up on my elbows, I looked into the back seat. 

She had gotten ahold of the golf clubs I leave in the back, and was bending my nine-iron like a pool noodle. I closed my eyes and sighed.

“You’re safe,” breathed. “I’m grateful for that. The clubs are replaceable.” 

Ella giggled and farted.

“Are you finished doing stupid shit?” 

I shot into a standing position, shocked at the voice in my ear.


Kimmy stood face-to-face with me.

I sighed with relief and hugged her, but she remained frozen. Pulling back, I met her eyes. I was worried that I would find anger there, but saw only the purest kind of fear.

“Do you realize how lucky you are to be alive after pulling that stunt?” she whispered in a high-pitched voice. 

Heat ran up my neck. “*No,* Kimmy, in fact I don’t. Do you know why I don’t? It’s because you’ve been hiding *every important thing about yourself*. So I can’t say how dangerous it is to fondle Leeches or punch Malverns because *you’ve kept me in the dark.* If you’re going to be pissed at someone, look in a mirror, Kimmy.”

She closed her eyes and forced slow, steady breaths. “You’re right, Russ,” she answered quietly.

“Huh?”

Kimmy opened her eyes. “You’re right. This is my fault, and I’m sorry.”

“I don’t understand.”

“What don’t you understand?”

I scratched the back of my head. “It’s just… I’ve never heard you say that I was entirely blameless.”

An awkward silence hung. 

“Let’s just agree that we’ve both been wrong in the past,” Kimmy conceded. 

I didn’t contradict her, knowing this was the best offer likely to come my way. 

She folded her arms, hung her head, and rested her face in her hand. “I’m so, so sorry, Russ. I convinced myself that we could have a normal family, and once I accepted the fact that I was lying to myself, I wanted to keep living that lie as long as I could.” 

Kimmy dropped her hands to her sides and gave me the saddest look. “Okay,” she whispered. “Here’s the truth about my family [and our daughter](https://www.facebook.com/P-F-McGrail-181784199029462/).”
