Every death spiral has an inflection point: a critical moment where the deathward trajectory shifts from highly probable to entirely unchangeable. 

Damnation, inexorably sealed. 

For me, it was the moment my crew began exhuming the sculpture. 

I wasn’t there when they shattered its cage. I was standing at the front of the warehouse, directly below the building’s circular skylight, letting sheets of warm, prismatic sunshine bake some relaxation into my throbbing shoulders. 

I sighed. 

The job was nearly done. 

We’d spent the day mapping out the structure’s ancient wiring, ripping musty tangles of it from the decrepit infrastructure, following the copper vasculature until it inevitably led us to the heart of the problem we’d been contracted to fix.

By my estimate, the building’s electrical issues originated at the very back of the warehouse, sequestered behind a dust-covered brick wall within an unlabeled storage closet. All of the wiring snaked under the bottom of that wall through a series of tiny, crescent-shaped tunnels. 

There was nowhere else the problem could be. 

*“Open it.”* 

My order was followed by an array of childish antics. 

The youngest of the bunch was the first to raise his sledgehammer. Smiling, Vijay heaved the tool over his broad shoulder with a reckless gusto. A man with white eyebrows and thick, bottle-cap glasses had to duck out of the hammer's arc to avoid getting his skull caved in (even though this *technically* occurred yesterday, I no longer remember his name - time’s funny like that, no?).

Kamal, my assistant foreman, began nervously rubbing the silver idol of St. Michael he always wore as a necklace between his fingers, brown eyes darting about the dimly lit room, frantically whispering the Lord’s Prayer as if those threadbare words could actually protect him. 

The others just stood there, waiting for someone else to do their work, cross-eyed, vacant-minded, thumbs sewn tightly up their own asses.

They were all so goddamned irritating. 

Everything was, really. Had been for a while. Forty years of construction work will do that to a person. The endless toil wears you down. Reality begins to feel sharp. The psyche excoriates; it bloodies like a child trudging naked through a thorn bush until every minuscule inconvenience becomes agonizing, almost unbearable. 

I couldn’t take it anymore. 

Anyone in my position would’ve walked away. Anyone as raw as I was would’ve ignored the oppressive feeling looming heavy in the darkness, this hellish gravity pushing down on our heads. 

So, that’s what I did. 

I walked away. 

About four minutes later, they broke through. 

On Saturday, December 13th, at approximately 4:02 P.M., the brick wall cracked and gave way. I watched the ramifications of that grievous mistake unfold through the smudged glass of the skylight. 

High above my head, a gray sun flickered into existence, silent and severe. 

I blinked. 

Blinked a few more times for good measure, but nothing seemed to change. 

It wasn’t the moon. Couldn’t have been the moon. Its perimeter seethed unlike anything I’d ever seen before. A bleary mist foamed from its gray edges, distorting the surrounding air, twisting chunks of stratosphere into a crown of hazy knots. 

Thought I was having a stroke. 

What a sweet mercy that would’ve been. 

Suddenly, the unholy sun expanded. 

The process reminded me of squid’s ink spreading through clear water: a gelatinous burst of liquid ash jetting through the blue air. The gray just kept eating, faster and faster, consuming the sky and the clouds and the sun in a series of rapid, peg-shaped bites, until there was nothing left but a uniform, concrete overcast. 

The handheld radio fastened to my belt crackled to life. 

*“Ravi - we need you back here, over.”* 

I pulled the receiver to my lips with a wet, trembling hand. The tip of a finger crept onto the push-to-talk, waiting for further instruction from my sizzling brain, but I couldn’t peel my eyes and my thoughts away from the invasive gloom. It was churning now. The sky was writhing like gray water brought to boil. 

Finally, I clicked the button. I attempted to speak, but the words couldn’t escape me; they caught between my teeth or fell down the cracks in my dry, fissured lips. 

Precipitation began to fall from the sky, but it wasn't rain.

There was no *pitter-patter* of droplets against the warehouse exterior. No accumulation of moisture on the skylight. Whatever the precipitation was made of, it was thinner than water, and it seemed to melt upon contact with the glass. A blizzard of soot composed of fragile, charcoal-tinted snowflakes. 

The radio slipped from my hand. 

I jumped when it clattered against the stone flooring, and that was enough; my paralysis was broken. Unfortunately, the radio looked broken, too. Fragments of black plastic lay scattered around the point of impact. Instinctively, I began pacing towards the back of the building, fear clawing at the base of my throat (to be clear, I would’ve tried to leave without the crew if I had the keys to any of our trucks on my person). 

The warehouse was divided into two equal sections. 

The front half sort of resembled an empty aircraft hangar - a cavernous, box-shaped atrium roughly the size of a hockey rink, with walls made of cold, corrugated aluminum. Each of those walls had a door at its center. Three of them led outside. The fourth led to the more instructable half of the warehouse, where the sculpture had been hidden. What lurked beyond that fourth door was a vast, all-encompassing darkness, thicker than the earth and quieter than the grave. No working electricity meant no functioning light bulbs, and the only window in the whole damn place was the skylight. Its illumination was meager, yes, but at least it was something. 

Earlier that afternoon, Vijay had led the charge, clicking on his flashlight and plunging into the murk with a hollow fearlessness: the bravery of a man too stupid to understand the depths of what can be lost. Hours later, I was forced to tread a similar path. 

My heart thrumming a desperate anthem, I yanked the door open and dove into the blackness. 

The narrow corridor felt suffocatingly tight. Wet carpet squished under my heels (we initially assumed - with no evidence, mind you - that the excess moisture was due to a leaky plumbing system). My flashlight’s pearly glow jittered in my shaking hand, dancing over the beige wood paneling and the surrounding walls many doorless frames: labyrinthine passageways to other nameless rooms or corridors, all seemingly vacant and maddeningly identical. 

They’re not far, I reminded myself. 

I just needed to follow the wires. 

Right turn at the first T-shaped intersection. 

Left at the next. 

Another left. 

Then right. 

Distant whispers curled into my ears, causing relief to trickle lovingly down my spine. I sped up. My boots thudded against the soaked fabric. The whispers got louder, and louder, and louder, and then there it was. 

A cracked door. 

Of all the rooms in the back half of the warehouse, it was the only one with a door. 

I pushed it open and plodded inside. All eight of them hushed in unison while turning their flashlights, blinding me. 

*“The hell's going on back here?”* I bellowed, hands raised, attempting to shield my eyes.

There was a pause. My crew began lowering their flashlights, but said nothing. My relief curdled. The fear in my throat began to mutate into a hot, mind-numbing rage. 

*“Oh for the love of...why the fuck are you all just standing there? Where is the* ***goddamned*** *electricity?”* 

They really couldn’t do anything right without me.

*“Actually, you know what? Never mind about the job - “* 

(The stockiest shadow, Kamal, swung his flashlight towards the back of the room and flatly whispered: *“Look.”*  I ignored him at first, focused on underplaying what I witnessed through the skylight. It was a lie, but if we all believed the lie, reality would have no choice but to follow suit, right?)

*“ - something's going on outside. Maybe a storm, maybe a wildfire, I’m not sure, but we really need to...”*

My gaze followed Kamal’s beam, and my voice trailed off, disintegrating under the sheer weight of what had been concealed behind that brick wall. I’ve taken to labeling it a sculpture in hindsight, but that’s not how I thought about it back then. 

It was a skeleton.

Only in the broadest sense of the word, though. 

Behind a new, craterous hole, suffused in a halo of white light, lay a set of bones, vaguely configured into the shape of a person. Ribs. A spine. Four extremities and a sort of pelvis. 

But the skeleton lacked variation in its components. 

Every bone was the same: each half a foot long, rounded at the ends, and decently thick. 

If I had to venture a guess, I’d say it was made up of thigh bones. 

An effigy of femurs. 

Six stacked femurs to form a spine. Rings of bowing femurs declaring a rib cage, all connected to a central, breastbone femur. Two hands pressed together in front of its chest, each with five long femur digits connected to triangular femur palms. The length of the bones made the skeleton twice the width and triple the size of a normal man, barely able to fit in the alcove. No skull at its apex; just a single red candle, nestled atop the highest spinal femur, burning a bright, sunflower yellow. 

The skeleton looked to be kneeling. Praying, even. 

The wires that led us there rested uselessly below it. There was no hidden circuit breaker; they snaked under the brick wall through those small, crescent-shaped tunnels to no discernible end. 

*“Why...why did you all light that candle?”* 

*“We didn’t. It was...like that.”* Vijay replied, his tone deflated, sapped of its usual eagerness. 

Kamal was feverish with worry. I’d suffered him long enough to sense an episode coming on, feeling his anxiety rub against my skin like static portending a storm. Before long, his panic bloomed in earnest. A hackneyed invocation began flooding from his lips. Pointless, piercing whispers. 

*“Lord, I ask You to surround me with Your hedge of protection. Cover me with the precious blood of Jesus and let no evil, no darkness, no scheme of the - “*

The jaundiced flame erupted, from a neon wisp to a sickly bonfire to an outright inferno.

Waves of blistering heat gnawed at my exposed face. The air tasted thin, polluted, teeming with the chemical sting of evaporated bleach. I doubled over, coughing, hacking. My lungs burned like I’d inhaled sandpaper. Animalistic screams and sputtering wheezes danced hand-in-hand against my eardrums. 

Once more, headstrong Vijay led the charge. 

I grabbed his arm as he pushed past me, sprinting from the room. Didn’t have the muscle to slow Vijay down, but anchoring to his momentum kept me upright, and I wasted no time chasing after him. 

Left - 

Right - 

Right - 

Left - 

Door. 

The whine of unoiled hinges echoed through the cavernous antechamber. Ahead, Vijay bounded towards the nearest exit. My vision swam, frenzied exertion exacting its toll. I stumbled and fell. Pain splintered through my kneecap as it thudded into the floor. I groaned, catching my breath on the concrete. Flakes of dust dissolved noiselessly against the skylight as Vijay reached the door. 

He clasped his hand around the knob.

With the slightest turn of his wrist, the door violently swung open, as if it was being battered by the winds of a category five hurricane. 

But it was deathly quiet. 

No whoosh. 

No crackling of thunder. 

No sound whatsoever.

Not until Vijay’s limp body collided with the wall.

He flew through the air; propelled nearly twenty feet by the silent, savage force. 

There was the concise, fleshy *crunch* of his body breaking against the metal, followed by the heavy *slam* of the door snapping shut, followed by the dull *thump* of his contorted frame landing on the floor, and then, mercifully, there was nothing.

We were alone for a little while. 

The rest of the crew was lost in the darker half of the warehouse. 

I watched him twitch and presumed him dead, his lifeless sinew animated only by corpse spasms, but Vijay was still very much alive. (In fact, he could not die, though he would certainly come to pine for death’s embrace. Soon, we all would hunger for an end, and, time and time again, we all would starve.)

Eventually, they found their way out of the labyrinth. 

Kamal helped me up. We gathered around Vijay, and it was worse up close. There was the bent fingers, and the fractured ribs, and the misaligned jaw, but it was more than that. 

His skin. 

There was something desperately wrong with his skin. 

He’d developed patches of swollen flesh, hideously tense, shimmering, and drained of their natural hue. Rivulets of milky fluid leaked through microscopic breaks in the scallop-colored dermis. We looked on in abject horror as half his face and the front of his right arm visibly pulsed to the septic rhythm of this cryptic malady, and that’s when it hit me. 

His body was tilted forward and to the right when he tried to leave. 

Everywhere the dust had touched him, *this* was the result. 

Someone else attempted to escape after witnessing Vijay. I didn’t bother warning them. It was better for the rest of the crew to see it for themselves. Much simpler than explaining. They weren’t as fortunate as Vijay. As they opened the door, the vast majority of their head became dust-kissed (within hours, the swelling evolved, consuming their visage entirely, leaving a moist pillar of white-yellow meat where their head used to reside).

If I’m remembering correctly, that’s when someone had the brilliant idea of calling for help.

With Vijay incapacitated, I was the first to try. 

The line rang, and rang, and rang, but I never seemed to reach a 9-1-1 dispatcher. A second person tried. Same issue. Then a third, then Kamal, then everyone was calling, some pacing fretfully, some biting their nails. It was bedlam, seven busy signals chiming in our ears, taunting us, pushing our collective sanity to its absolute limit.  

I pulled my phone away and looked at the screen.

Four bars: perfect, uninterrupted service. There was no reason for the call to fail. 

That’s when I saw the time. 

4:02 P.M.

I felt a boiling pressure build behind my eyes. 

It wasn’t possible. 

The time was 4:02 when that gray sun swallowed the sky. I was sure of it. The detail had been seared against the inside of my skull like a cattle brand. 

But that was at least an hour ago. 

A wild, ravening howl bubbled up my throat, perching on my vocal cords, but before I could slip completely into madness, I heard something. A faint noise from the receiver of my cell phone. 

*“Hello?”* \- there was a woman on the other line. 

Frantic with hope, I slammed the phone back against my ear and began rambling. 

*“Hello?? Hello?? Are you there?? I need help - ”* The remaining crew scampered over to me, eyes wide. *“ - I mean,* ***we*** *need help - we need an ambulance to a warehouse outside of city limits. The address is \[xxxxxxxxxxxxx\].”* 

“...”

No response. 

Sweat gushed down the sides of my neck. My gaze flickered over to Vijay, propped up listlessly against the wall a few yards away, eyes glassy but fixed on me with intent. A lonesome anguish stirred in the abyss of his dilated pupils. His breathing was labored. The swelling on the right side of his face had begun to grow over his mouth, narrowing his airway. 

*“Hello???”* I shrieked, voice cracking, tears welling. The sight of Kamal thumbing the silver saint around his neck nearly sent me over the brink. 

*“Oh dear...”* the voice muttered. Her tone was sympathetic but tinged with condescension. A mother gently scolding a child for being impatient, masking her contempt beneath a honey-sweet veneer. 

Something horrible fizzled between the cracks of my brain. 

*“...well, have you fixed it yet, Ravi?”* 

My heart collapsed in on itself like a dying star. 

I recognized her voice. 

*“I mean, you were hired to fix what’s inside that warehouse, were you not?”* she continued. The pleasant clamor of someone cooking a meal could be heard in the background. The rushing of water from a sink head. A knife connecting with a cutting board. Beeps from the dashboard of a stovetop. 

The crew stared at me expectantly. I watched in real time as their brittle hope began to shatter. Little by little, despair burrowed through their skin like a swarm of parasitic worms, causing their flesh to quiver, their expressions to tremble. 

I couldn’t speak. The words just never arrived. 

That was OK. 

Our employer didn’t seem to mind. 

*“Suppose what I’m saying is...well...it’s disrespectful to leave without putting in a full day’s work. So! You promised you’d fix the current. That was the deal. I suggest you do just that.”* 

The line clicked dead. 

We were never able to reach anyone outside the warehouse by telephone again. None of their clocks ever ticked forward, either: all of our phones displayed 4:02 PM for hours upon hours, until, inevitably, their batteries ran out of charge and their screens went black. 

During that time, the blunt truth of the matter became progressively apparent. 

We didn’t feel hunger. Nor thirst. 

We had no need to defecate and no need to sleep. 

The concrete overcast visible through the skylight never dimmed. The dust never stopped falling. 

We were trapped. 

Confined within a perpetual motion machine until we determined how to unlock it. 

To do that, we would need guidance. Aid from the divine. Scripture and a saint to interpret it. 

The answer (as with most answers, it seems) was always within reach, but it was hidden. 

Behind doors. 

Behind walls.

Behind glistening white-yellow skin, stretched taut with consecration, waiting patiently for someone to give it a voice. 

When Kamal tore off his precious necklace and dropped it to the floor like garbage, I was surprised. Not shocked. We’d done much, much worse in the interim (to ourselves, to each other, etc.). Still, I was taken aback, and curious enough to follow him as he limped over to the mound of flesh that had once been Vijay.

He lightly draped his fingertips across the pulsing skin. His eyes rolled into the back of his head, and he discovered something along his diseased geography.

Unfortunately, lifetimes would pass before we reached that pivotal moment.

But that juncture marked the beginning of the end.
