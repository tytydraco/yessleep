Where do I start. 

This all began 1 to 1.5 ago

[August] 
It was a quiet peaceful night. I was just staring out the window since I couldn’t fall asleep. The city was asleep so it was really quiet.  But there still was sound coming from the port. 

It sounded like a bunch of ships leaving one by one. Even though I didnt have a direct line of sight towards the river or the port but the sound was clear . The date and time didn’t match the normal schedule. 

I thought not much of it. Maybe the ships were for some reason late by a day or two.

A week went by until the same sounds came once more. And then once more a week later. This new and weird scheduled went on for a month until that stormy night. 

[October] 
A cool night, cloudy and windy when It started. The first signs were of shots being fired from the north-eastern side of the city.I could say for sure they were from north east since I live in the easter side. It started at 9-10 pm and ended at around 11:30. 

This happened again a day or two later. But this time the shots started at much later 12:30 this time. 

The night during whole month was riddled with gunshots firing, police sirens or ships docking. 

When some people questioned the gunshots, the were given the explanation of a construction going on which was true. A large scale construction was goin. But that didn’t explain the very frequent police/ambulance sirens or the mysterious ships docking. 

It all felt as if the military was fighting someone or something in the north-east. 

The fight grew greatly in intensity to the point where a stray bullet even came and hit my grandparents house. He lived 3 km away from the river. 
My uncle decided to get it checked by one of his police friends. Not much Information could be found from it unfortunately. 

This intense fight was short, it lasted a week before dying out. From then on until a few months, there was hardly and sound coming from that area. But, that soon changed.

[February](next year)
Night had just fallen when those shots started. It was not intense but it surely was on a much larger scale that the other ones. Now not only from the northeast but South and South east aswell. It sounded as if they were searching for something, as of they were hunting down something. It also lasted the whole night. Only calming down About 2 hours before sunrise. 

I only managed to hear all this because I pulled an all nighter because of an exam.

That was the last time this happened.
 That night one last convoy of ships left the port. And once again it was all back to being quiet.

I still wonder to this day what really happened, was there really a fight, who or what was it against, why did one one report anything. 

Maybe I Won't get an answer but I hope so that I get one. Maybe today, tomorrow or later.
