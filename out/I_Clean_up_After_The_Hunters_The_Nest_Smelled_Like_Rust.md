I’m typing this from a booth in a 24-hour diner off I-94 in Detroit, the kind with sticky tables littered with salt packets and coffee that tastes like burnt rubber gone cold. My left leg’s propped on a cracked vinyl seat, stiff and throbbing under my jeans. The skin’s hot and tight like it’s swelling against the denim, a dull burn creeping up my calf.

I’ve got a rag, the same greasy one from last week’s Chicago job, tied around my right arm where those four gashes still weep, black at the edges, oozing a slow, thick red despite the clumsy stitches I sewed Thursday with fishing line from a gas station kit. My hands tremble, smearing blood, diner grease, and coffee stains across the keys of my beat-up laptop. Its battery’s at 14%, screen flickering every time the waitress slams a plate or the jukebox skips on some old Motown track.

I can’t shake it, the shredder’s snarl from that warehouse looping in my skull, “clean me again,” now tangled with a new sound, a high-pitched chitter that claws into my brain like rusty nails on steel. I’m Alex, 32, and I clean up after Vanguard Extermination’s hunters. Tonight was my second job. I don’t know how much longer I can keep this up.

If you’ve seen what they hunt or what’s hunting me, tell me how to stop it. I’m running out of tricks, and the bleach ain’t cutting it anymore.

Vanguard texted me Sunday night, three days after that Chicago mess left me scarred and shaking. I’d spent the weekend holed up in a truck stop off I-90, my F-150 parked under a flickering sodium light. The cab stank of sweat and blood-soaked rags as I tried to sleep through the snarls echoing louder every time I shut my eyes, like that shredder knew I was still alive.

My arm burned under the stitches, the black edges spreading slow, a pulsing ache I drowned with cheap whiskey from a flask under the seat. The message buzzed my cracked Nokia at 9 p.m., screen lighting up the dark: “Sewer, 8 Mile Rd and Livernois Ave. Brood cleanup. Hunters done. Bring bleach and boots.”

Another grand hit my account, same encrypted app as before, no explanation, just cold cash and colder orders, like last time, but heavier now, like they knew I’d hesitate. I didn’t. I grabbed my kit from the truck’s bed, mop with a splintered handle that creaked in my grip, two dented steel buckets clanking against my thighs, rubber gloves stiff with dried blood from the warehouse, and that rusted crowbar, still chipped from smashing that hunter’s skull four days back.

I drove over in the dark, windshield streaked with slush, heater rattling, the shredder’s voice hissing soft under the engine’s growl, a constant itch behind my eyes I couldn’t scratch.

The sewer entrance was a manhole in an alley off 8 Mile, rusted steel half-buried under a crust of snow and trash, empty beer cans, cigarette butts, a shredded plastic bag flapping in the wind. The air hit me as I parked, sharp and cold at 20 degrees, thick with a metallic tang, like rust, but wetter, meatier, curling into my lungs with every breath.

A Vanguard van sat nearby, black and unmarked, doors shut tight, no hunters in sight, just tire tracks cutting through the slush, snaking down Livernois into the night. I yanked the truck’s door open, the creak loud in the empty alley, and hauled my gear out, boots crunching ice as I trudged over.

I pried the manhole cover off with the crowbar, metal groaning loud enough to wake the dead, scraping against the rim until it clattered aside. I climbed down, boots slipping on the ladder’s icy rungs, the cold steel biting through my gloves, water dripping from above, plinking into the dark below.

The tunnel stretched narrow and black ahead, concrete walls slick with slime that glistened under my flashlight, the stink slamming me hard, rust, rot, and something sour, like a butcher shop left to fester for weeks. I waded in, water ankle-deep and freezing, sloshing red around my soles, my beam catching glints of blood streaking the walls, pooling in cracks, trailing down like tears.

The brood’s nest was deeper in, a good fifty yards down where the tunnel widened into a cavern, thirty feet across, ceiling sagging low and dripping with webs that shimmered wet under my light, strands swaying slow in the stale air. The floor was a mess of blood and egg slime, thick and yellow, clotting around husks, crab-like shells the size of dinner plates, cracked open jagged, claw marks raking the concrete in frantic arcs.

Webs hung heavy from the walls, sticky and glistening, stuck with chunks of flesh, fingers curled stiff, a strip of scalp with matted red hair, a shred of muscle still twitching faintly. A hunter’s hand dangled from a web overhead, wrist torn clean, bones glinting white through ragged flesh, blood dripping steady into a puddle below, ripples spreading slow across the water’s surface.

I gagged, bile sharp and hot in my throat, the taste mixing with the rust-stink until I nearly retched. I pulled on my mask, rubber and cracked from last week, straps biting my ears as I yanked it tight over my face. I started mopping, bleach cutting through the slime, splashing white foam that fizzed pink where it hit the blood, fumes burning my nose until my eyes watered and my mask fogged with every breath.

The air buzzed, alive with a faint chitter, like metal scraping metal, but alive, echoing off the walls, burrowing into my skull alongside that shredder’s snarl from Chicago. I worked fast, mop dragging through the gore, splashing bleach to drown the smell, my flashlight propped on a ledge, beam cutting shadows that danced across the webs.

The chitter grew louder, sharper, a high-pitched whine that sank into my brain, weaving with the shredder’s voice, “clean me again,” until a new whisper joined: “they’re watching.” I froze, mop dripping yellow slime onto my boots, the sound swelling, pressing against my eardrums.

A husk twitched nearby, shell cracking wider, a claw poking out, small but sharp as a razor, glistening wet with ooze. I swung the crowbar, smashed it hard, yellow goo sprayed, splattering my gloves, sticking hot to my knuckles, but more twitched, three, five, a dozen husks splitting open across the nest, shells popping with wet cracks.

The chitter spiked, deafening, rattling my teeth. Broodlings hatched, spider-crab freaks, six inches wide, claws like scalpels, skittering fast on spindly legs that clicked against the concrete, eyes black and glinting like wet marbles.

They hit the water first, two janitors I hadn’t seen until now, hired grunts like me, wading in from a side tunnel with mops of their own, their flashlight beams jerking wild. The first guy screamed, a broodling clawing his throat, skin tore, blood sprayed in a hot arc, gurgling as it ripped deeper, carotid jetting red across the wall, painting the webs crimson. He dropped, hands clawing at his neck, water splashing around him as he sank.

The second tried to run, three latched onto his legs, claws slashing through denim, belly split wide, guts spilling into the water, steaming in the cold as he fell face-first, twitching, a wet moan fading fast. A third grunt stumbled in, a skinny kid, barely 20, mop slipping from his grip as a broodling leaped, claw punching through his chest, ribs cracking loud, heart torn free, still pulsing as it skittered off with it, blood trailing red behind.

I swung the crowbar, cracked one off my boot, ooze splashing, stinging my shin, but another leaped, claw raking my left leg, venom burning hot through my jeans, muscle locking stiff like a cramp that wouldn’t quit. I fell, water soaking me cold, bleach stinging the gash until I hissed through clenched teeth. They swarmed, six, eight, ten, claws clicking, chittering loud, the shredder’s voice laughing under it: “they’re watching.”

Boots splashed heavy from above, hunters burst in through a grate, four of them, rifles blazing, muzzle flashes lighting the webs in strobing red and white. Bullets tore broodlings apart, shells burst open, ooze sprayed thick, legs skittering loose across the water, but more hatched, a wave clawing up the walls, webs trembling under their weight.

One hunter, the young one, took a hit, claw slashing through his gut, intestines looping out in a wet tangle, screaming as they dragged him down, ripping flesh in bloody strips until his cries choked off. Another, a woman with a buzz cut, fired a flare, red light flared bright, webs caught, flames licking up the walls, the nest burned, broodlings screeching, popping wet as they cooked, the air thick with the stink of charred rust and flesh.

I crawled, leg dragging useless, crowbar swinging, smashed one off my chest, shell cracking open, venom splattering my neck, burning sharp like acid on raw skin. Another hunter, an older guy, grizzled, yelled, “Torch it!” The scarred leader from Chicago tossed a gas can, lit it with a flare. The explosion rocked the tunnel, a wall of heat singeing my hair, broodlings curling black, the chitter fading slow into a crackling hiss.

They didn’t look at me. They climbed out, dragging the young hunter’s corpse, guts trailing in a bloody smear, one arm gone, blood pooling in the cracks, leaving me in the smoke, flames licking the webs overhead, the air choking with ash and burnt slime.

I limped up after them, leg stiff as a board, arm throbbing under the rag, mopped what I could, slime sloshed under my boots, husks crunched into powder, charred flesh flaking off the walls. I grabbed a broodling claw, sharp, black, still twitching faintly, for proof, tucking it into my jacket next to that chipped machete from last week, the weight cold against my ribs.

The janitors lay shredded, first’s throat a gaping hole, blood congealing in the water, second’s guts strewn wide, floating in red clumps, the kid’s chest hollow, ribs splayed, face frozen in a scream. That voice stuck, “They’re watching,” high and shrill, weaving with the shredder’s snarl, my nose trickling blood I didn’t feel, warm down my chin and neck, staining my collar.

I climbed out, ladder rungs slick with slime, each step jarring my leg until I winced, the cold biting my soaked jeans as I stumbled back to my truck. The engine coughed twice before it caught, exhaust puffing white into the night as I peeled out, the alley shrinking in my rearview.

I’m here now, diner lights buzzing harsh, rag tight around my arm, four gashes, blacker now, wetter, pulsing like something’s alive under the skin, a slow drip soaking my sleeve. My leg’s numb below the knee, venom burn creeping up my thigh, jeans sticking to the wound, the denim dark and wet.

Vanguard texted twenty minutes ago, “Next job Friday. Keep quiet,” with another grand in my account, the app pinging soft on my Nokia, screen glowing through a spiderweb of cracks. I hear it, shredder snarling low, brood chittering sharp, faint under the diner’s hum of clinking plates and tired voices, louder when I blink, like they’re both waiting.

Second job’s worse, something’s following me, watching me, and I don’t know if it’s them or Vanguard or both. What are they hunting? How do I stop these voices? Tell me, I’m running out of bleach, and the rag’s not holding anymore. I \*Really\* need to find a way to fix this arm.
