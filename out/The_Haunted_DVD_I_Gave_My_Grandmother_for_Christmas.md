Hi everyone,

I need advice about a bizarre situation involving my grandmother and a French DVD I gave her for Christmas. I'm new here, so I don't know if this is the right place for that

For context, my grandma has always been in love with France. She traveled there in her youth and often reminisces about an old flame she met while she was there. She adores everything about France—its culture, its history, and especially its cinema. When she was younger, she used to frequent arthouse theaters, always eager to see the latest French films. It’s one of the reasons I thought it would be a perfect gift for her to receive a French indie sci-fi DVD I found online. The film is called LE DERNIER VOYAGE, and although it was second-hand, it seemed like something she would really enjoy.

She was absolutely thrilled with the gift. I could see how excited she was, especially because it was a film from a genre she doesn’t usually watch but always expressed an interest in. Today, she popped it into her DVD player but things took a strange turn almost immediately.

When she pressed play, the movie didn’t start properly. There was no typical menu screen or even a trailer. Instead, she thought she heard a faint voice, almost childlike in tone. At first, she couldn’t make out the words, and she assumed maybe it was just a strange glitch. But then, the screen suddenly changed, and instead of the opening credits or any recognizable scenes, a single photo appeared. It was a strange and unsettling image of a child standing alone in the middle of a supermarket aisle. The child had no face—just a crude smiley face drawn in place of eyes and a mouth.

My grandma, understandably freaked out by this, called me over to investigate. I didn’t know what to think either. I assumed it might just be a malfunction of some sort, but when I tried to check the DVD on my laptop, it got even stranger. There was no video file on the disk at all. Instead, there was a link that led to a youtube chanel (~~I’m not going to post it here, but I can share it if needed~~). The link led me to 3 strange videos with no clear explanation, and the whole thing felt horrible.

\[EDIT = here is the video #1\]

I trying to understand what was going on. It seemed to be connected to the film, but honestly, I'm not even sure anymore. It was like there was another layer to the film, like a story within the story. The more I watched, the more it felt like something was unfolding that wasn’t meant to be seen. It’s as if there was another narrative hidden in the background, something darker and far more unsettling.

Ever since that night, my grandma has been acting a little… off. She says she feels like something is wrong, that the DVD might be connected to something bigger than just a malfunction or a prank. She keeps insisting that the voice she heard sounded like it was trying to tell her something important, but she can’t explain exactly what that might be.

I’m honestly a bit freaked out myself. I’ve been trying to rationalize it, but there’s something about this whole situation that feels wrong. Has anyone ever experienced something like this before? Could this just be some kind of elaborate prank, or is there something more sinister going on here? Any advice or thoughts would be greatly appreciated—this is really starting to unnerve me, and I’m worried about my grandma.

Thanks in advance for your help.
