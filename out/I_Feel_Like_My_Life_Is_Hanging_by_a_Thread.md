I couldn’t afford to pay rent in my old apartment after getting fired from one of my jobs. Needless to say, I had to downsize.



Downsizing, in my case, meant renting a decrepit apartment in what most people would consider the slums of the city.



So anyway, I moved in about a week ago, only to slowly realize that I could barely keep up with rent even there. Money was tight. I used to work two jobs and now I only had one, and of course I lost the better paying one.



I needed a roommate, desperately. Of course, no one was willing to live there. No one sane, at least.



A couple of my friends came over for a house party after I moved in, and most of them left in a hurry after seeing the place. Constant yelling, banging, and shouting are the norm in this building.



I won’t even bother describing the state of the apartment. You can imagine.



Two of my closest friends stayed longer, though, and we ended up drinking together. Let’s call them Mike and Lucy.



Mike gave me a long talk about investing, self improvement, crypto, and things like that. Honestly, I zoned out and didn’t listen to a word he said.



Lucy, on the other hand, changed things.



Lucy comes from a wealthy family, to put it lightly. She offered to lend me money until I got back on my feet, but I refused, knowing full well I’d never be able to repay her. I even caught her trying to hide money around the apartment so I would “find it.”



She has a strange hobby. Lucy is into occult stuff, not the fanatical practicing kind, but more like collecting obscure and supposedly cursed items. She isn’t shy about paying a lot of money for them either.



She’s also highly educated. I’ve always wondered why she hangs out with us at all.



That night, she told us she had bought a strange grimoire off the dark web. I rolled my eyes as soon as she mentioned it, convinced she’d fallen for some obvious scam.



Mike and I started mocking her and trying to convince her it was fake, but she stood her ground.



“Want to see it?” she asked with a grin.



I don’t know why, but both of us felt uneasy. Mike hesitated before saying, “Okay, sure.”



She pulled it out of her bag.



It looked wrong. The binding was made of some kind of hard leather mixed with dried leaves or something like that. The book had a foul odor I couldn’t quite identify.



I took it from her, and I swear it felt unnaturally cold to the touch. Maybe that was just my imagination.



Mike and I flipped through the pages, unable to understand the language or symbols. It was clearly handwritten, and judging by the differences in script, it seemed like multiple people had contributed to it.



The last page showed a sketch of a grotesque creature that made both of us recoil.



Was it a scam? At that point, we weren’t so sure.



Lucy claimed she knew how to translate the text into something understandable. Somehow, she talked me into performing one of the spells. As a hardcore atheist and skeptic, I decided to humor her.



It wasn’t like it required a blood ritual or anything like that.



It was simple.



All I had to do was take two pieces of red string, which Lucy conveniently had, tie them into a knot, light a black candle, which she also conveniently had in her bag, and place it in front of my door. The final step was drawing a strange symbol on the door with black chalk and blowing into the knot.



“What will this do?” I asked, confused.



She gave me a strange half smile and said, “It should give you an influential roommate.”



So we did the ritual. Nothing happened at first. Mike and Lucy stayed for a bit, then headed home. As Lucy was leaving, I asked, “How do I kick out my roommate, then?”



She paused before replying, “Oh. Just undo the knot.”



I put out the candle and wiped the symbol off the door. I remember putting the red string in my nightstand drawer. At least, I think I do.



That night, I had a strange nightmare. I was walking down into a dark, wet cave. In the center was a black pond. I stepped into the water. It was ice cold, yet strangely soothing.



A horned woman with black eyes emerged from the water and leaned beside me. I felt terrified, and then I woke up.



She was hauntingly beautiful, but the dream felt deeply wrong. When I say I felt it, I mean I could physically feel everything that happened.



I got up, went to the bathroom, and washed my face with cold water. As I pulled a towel from the shelf, I heard a loud clatter on the floor.



I looked down and saw a golden nugget stamped with strange markings.



I thought Lucy must’ve put it there, but there was no way she could’ve reached that shelf due to her height, and I didn’t remember her ever going into the bathroom.



I took it to a numismatics store. The owner’s face went pale as soon as he saw it. He kept asking where I got it and refused to believe my explanation.



Apparently, it was something called a Lydian coin.



He paid me a small fortune for it, on the condition that I never tell anyone where it came from.



I tried looking into the previous tenant. All I could find was that he was an older man who worked at a car factory. Not someone who should’ve owned something like that.



I canceled my lease and moved into a new apartment. This one was high end.



Mike was shocked. Lucy, somehow, wasn’t. She didn’t say anything, but I could see it in her expression.



The nightmares grew more intense. Sometimes I woke up drenched in sweat. Other times I woke up gasping for air.



Every time I had that dream, though, something good happened. Unexplainably good.



If I applied for a highly competitive job, I got it. When I gambled, I almost always won. I found expensive jewelry lying in the street.



This went on for months.



The only thing I had absolutely no luck with was women. No matter what I did, I couldn’t get a single date.



That was when I really got scared. I decided to undo the knot, but I couldn’t find the red string anywhere. Lucy was visibly shaken when I told her.



We searched the entire apartment. Nothing.



I had a doctor’s appointment shortly after. They told me my health was noticeably declining, but they couldn’t determine why.



Last night, I had another nightmare.



The woman in the pond held me in her arms. That was when I noticed the red string tied tightly around her wrist.



Lucy has lost the book, and the website she bought it from no longer exists.



I’ve got more money than I ever dreamed of, yet I can barely muster the strength to get out of bed.



What is happening to me?



I feel like my life is hanging by a thread. Literally.
