They don’t understand the old business. The police in Port Augusta, with their sterile room and their blinking laptop, they think the land is empty. They think it’s just dirt and scrub and stars. They don’t feel it breathing.

My name is Aunty Mae, and my grandson, Kodi, is gone.

It was on the long drive across the Nullarbor. Just me and him in the old Troopy. He was sleeping, his little wooden lizard tucked in his hand. I needed a break, my eyes heavy with the kilometers. I pulled into one of those lonely rest stops—just a concrete bunker with two open doorways for toilets, squatting under that huge, star-dusted sky.

Kodi stirred awake yawning, slowly blinking his eyes. “Gotta go, Nana,” he mumbled, climbing out.

I looked at that dark entrance to the men’s. No door, just a rectangle of pure black. The air felt… thick. “Quick fella, Kodi,” I said, my skin prickling. “This country… old business here. Don’t be long.”

He gave me a sleepy nod and scurried into the darkness. I turned to look out at the plain, trying to shake the feeling. This is when you listen. When the land goes quiet.

The cicadas stopped chirring. Just like that. The silence was heavier than any noise.

Then I felt it. A coldness, a wrongness in the pit of my stomach. A feeling my people have known for thousands of years. A feeling that says, *Something is hunting.*

I spun around. “Kodi!”

Nothing.

My heart hammered against my ribs. “KODI! JUKA!” I screamed into the night.

Stillness. The kind of stillness that swallows sound.

I ran to the entrance, my old legs screaming in protest, and stared into the black maw of the toilets. “Kodi! Answer me!”

I fumbled for my phone, my hands shaking so bad I almost dropped it. The torch beam cut into the darkness, dancing over graffiti and cracked tiles.

There, on the concrete floor, just inside the entrance, was Kodi’s wooden lizard. Snapped clean in two.

But Kodi was gone.

The sound that came out of me then wasn’t a scream. It was a low, guttural moan, the sound of a thousand puzzle pieces I’d spent a lifetime ignoring suddenly snapping together. 

The stories my grandfather told by the fire, the ones I’d dismissed as old fables to keep children from wandering off… they weren’t just stories. They were warnings. And in the crushing, unnatural silence of that place, with my grandson’s broken toy at my feet, a single, terrifying word surfaced from the depths of memory, a name I hadn’t heard spoken in fifty years.

*The Munganngga.* The Eater.

Now, I sit in this cold room with the two policemen. Senior Constable Reid and the young one, Davies. They have a liaison officer, Jason, who tries to soften their words, but I see the truth in their eyes.

They show me a video on their laptop. A grainy, greenish thing from a security camera. There’s my Troopy. There I am, a small figure by the car. There’s Kodi, scurrying into the dark. My breath catches.

And then I see it. What I only felt.

Four seconds after Kodi disappears into the darkness, something else enters the frame. From the bottom edge, a patch of moving darkness, a slick, black mass that glides over the ground without moving, like a wave of oil. It doesn’t have a shape you could name, just a feeling of solid, hungry shadow. It moves from the edge of the scrub straight into that doorway, flowing inside like water.

It went in after him.

“Aunty, we need you to go through it again,” Reid says, his voice flat. “For Kodi.”

“I felt it,” I whisper, my eyes locked on the frozen blur on the screen. “The Munganngga. It came out of the old country. It glided right in after him.”

Jason translates. Reid’s mouth becomes a thin, tight line.

“The ‘Mung-ang-ah’?” he says, butchering the word, stripping it of its power. “Aunty, the tape shows a blur. It could be a dust devil, a trick of the light. We need to know about a person. A vehicle. Something real.”

“It’s real!” My voice cracks. “It’s older than your lights and your cameras! It took my grandson and you’re sitting here!”

The young one, Davies, leans forward, his face full of a foolish, earnest pity. “Maybe… maybe you got scared, Aunty? Maybe Kodi ran out the back and you panicked? We just need to know what *really* happened.”

The words hit me like a physical blow. They think I’m a confused old woman. They think my terror is a lie. They are looking at a creature as old as the dreamtime on their screen and they call it a “blur.”

I stand up, the chair screeching behind me. My whole body trembles, not with weakness, but with a frantic, screaming urgency they are too blind to see.

“YOU’RE NOT LISTENING!” I scream, pounding my frail fist on the table. “IT’S GOT HIM OUT THERE! IN THE DARK! YOU’RE LETTING THAT OLD EVIL KEEP HIM!”

They just look at me. They see a hysterical old Aboriginal woman.

They let me go after another hour of circular questions. Jason drove me back to my niece’s house in Port Augusta. The family was there, a house full of muted grief and silent, understanding looks. They knew. They didn't need the police's permission to believe. My older brother, Joseph, put a hand on my shoulder. His eyes, old and deep like waterholes, held the same terrible knowledge.

“The Munganngga,” he said, and it wasn’t a question.

I just nodded, too exhausted for tears.

“It’s been a long time since one has been spoken of in this country,” he murmured. “The old songs for that place… they haven’t been sung in generations. The land is forgetting the rules.”

That night, as the family slept a fitful sleep, I sat on the porch and looked south, towards the Nullarbor. I could feel it, a cold thread pulling at my spirit. A connection. A grandmother’s bond to her grandson, stretched thin but not yet broken.

And then I heard it. Faint, like a dream carried on the wind.

*Nana.*

It was Kodi’s voice. But it was wrong. It was echoey, wet, like it was coming from deep underground.

I shot up, my heart in my throat. “Kodi?” I whispered into the night.

*It’s dark, Nana. But I can see the stars… from underneath.*

The voice faded. The connection snapped. I was left standing on the porch, cold sweat on my brow. He wasn’t dead. Not yet. The Munganngga doesn’t kill quickly. It… preserves. It takes its prey to its place in the deep earth, and it feeds on the terror, on the spirit, slowly, over a long, long time. The stories say it can keep you aware in the darkness for years.

The police won’t listen. Their search is already shifting. They’re putting out bulletins about a possible custody dispute, suggesting maybe his no-good father snatched him. They’re looking for a human monster because they can’t conceive of the other kind.

But I am not looking for a monster. I am listening for my grandson.

I’m leaving tonight. I’ve got the Troopy packed with water, fuel, and the things my brother Joseph gave me: red ochre, sacred leaves, the old digging stick that belonged to our grandfather. The tools to sing the old songs, to remind the land of its rules.

I am going back to that concrete bunker under the stars. I am going to find the entrance to its burrow. I am going to sing the songs that haven’t been sung in a hundred years, songs that tell the Munganngga it is not welcome, that it must give back what it has stolen.

They think I’m a crazy old woman chasing shadows.

But they are wrong. The shadow is chasing my grandson. And I am the only one who knows how to follow it into the dark.
