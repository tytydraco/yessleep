So for context, I grew up in the suburbs, and outside of the occasional play park or sports field, there was nothing to do. Me and my neighbours used to play Knock and Run, or its other name, Ding Dong Ditch.

for context I have a sister who is a year younger than me, and my neighbour James was the same age as me; his older sister was 14 at the time, and she also played with us from time to time, although I think she just wanted to hang out with my sister, whom she thought was cute.

I was admittedly the biggest coward in the group, and to this day, my flight instinct is significantly stronger than my fight instinct, so I would never ring the doorbell as I would always find a way to wiggle out of it.

I always found watching it more entertaining than doing it. On this particular afternoon, my cousins came over. One of my cousins was my age; the other was a few years younger than me and couldn't play with us; and the other was a year older than me, but everyone treated him like he was an adult, even though he was only 11.

or at least that's how I perceived it. lets call this cousin Daniel as he is somewhat important to the story, I am not a reliable narrator, as it has been almost ten years since these events, but I will try my hardest to remember them. Anyway, I am getting off topic.

My cousins came over, and we were banished outside to play, and we all decided that knock and run was a good idea.

We usually just played around our immediate street, never venturing further than the next street over out of fear of getting lost in the copied and pasted suburban streets. We made our way up the street to the play park on top of the hill; it sat where a house could have been, and someone could cut across it onto the next road.

As we sat on the play equipment, we decided that a vote should decide who knocked first, and of course I was picked. I remember getting myself out of it and getting my older cousin to take my place. I am thankful that he was and is as proud as he is. It helped me get out of a lot of situations. We decided that our first target would be the fanciest-looking house in the area, a white marble house with a fountain in the front yard and a curved driveway.

I remember sitting next to a car; I was small enough to look under it from the kerb, and I had a clear view of my cousin sneaking up to the door and ringing the doorbell three times in order to get the attention of whoever was inside, and he bolted down the pathway towards the street to hide behind the cars, but before he got to the fence, an older man in a black leather apron with what I assumed was paint came sprinting after him.

I immediately knew something was wrong; this wasn't the usual response to a knock and run. Sure, we have encountered some angry people before, but this was something very different.

He practically flew down the walkway towards Daniel and threw his hand out to grab him. This didn't feel like anything someone his age could do, and it scared the shit out of me.

I think I might have been the only one with a clear view of what was going on, which meant that I was the first to see what was happening.

It wasn't until the man was practically on top of Daniel that he noticed that he was being chased, and the scream that he made when he realised this will always stick with me.

As I said at the start of this, Daniel was and still is a very proud person who will always try to prove himself, so hearing this scream of pure terror struck at my core.

Everyone was clued in at this point as to what was happening. Daniel didn't open the waist-high gate at the end of the path; he just jumped it, which I think ultimately saved him from getting hurt as the old man had to take a second to open it. Daniel was sprinting down the street as fast as I had ever seen him.

"Stop you little shit," the man shouted with a deep, angry voice.

which did actually stop Daniel in his tracks; they were both standing in the middle of the road at this point, reminding me of an old western movie when two cowboys would be standing at either end of the main road. The man marched straight up into Daniel's face, and I could finally get a good look at him.

His skin resembled rough leather, and the few strands of hair on his head had long since greyed. He was clean-shaven, and he was wearing white pants, a white button-up, and a black leather apron that had what I rationalised as red paint on it.

After he was maybe half a foot from Daniel, he started to berate him, and I could only make out the words "Sick people in there", Everything about this man threw me off, and I could see my neighbour and my other cousin, who was hiding in the bushes, felt the same.

My neighbour's older sister, whom I will call Tay, screamed out at him from the other side of the road, which gave Daniel the opportunity to run as fast as he could away from the man. We all ran at that point. I don't think I or anyone else knew where we were running off to, but I found myself in the carpark of the shopping centre across the road from me.

I waited there for maybe 30 minutes, just watching cars come in and out, feeling safer with the large group of people. I had no idea at the time if he chased one of us, but I knew that I was safe. I made my way back to my house and found that I was the last one to return. My cousin Daniel ran straight home, and Tay followed him. My other cousin and neighbour ran around the suburbs for a bit before deciding to go home.

My mum was missing when I got home, and I realised that she had been told what happened. My mother is someone who isn't afraid of protecting her own, and she is one of the strongest people I know, so I felt pretty safe that she was aware and was off telling him to fuck off, but when she got back she seemed off; she didn't want to talk about it or anything, and any colour from her face had completely drained. We slept at my neighbour's house that night because my mum wanted to talk to my dad about something serious, and I think we all knew what it was about.

Nothing happened for a while after that. Not for a while, but my mum was a lot more protective of what we did outside; we were no longer allowed to play knock-and-run or go up the road without a parent. It really bugged my sister, who loved to play outside.

but I don't think she fully understood what happened. I have a lot more stories about this guy, and I probably will write more because this has helped me get a better grip on everything that happened throughout that year, but I hope you enjoy the very first event in one of the worst periods of my life.

Chapter 2

I asked my my mum what the man had said to her, She was surprised that I remembered what happened and tried to sweep it under the rug, but I kept pressing her for answers. I'm not proud of pressuring my mother into talking to me about something like this, but curiosity got the better of me.

I know that that isn't an excuse, but I feel it somewhat justifies my actions, I felt like I needed answers and believed that they were owed to me, she grabbed my arm and led me to my room before placing me on my bed. She sat next to me and told me not to repeat anything of what I said to my sister, my cousins, or anyone else who was involved with this man throughout that year.

She finally opened up about how she was sitting at home watching TV when she heard a loud knock on the front door. It was my cousin Daniel and my neighbour Tay, who looked terrified and exhausted. After letting them in and grilling them for answers, my mum was rightfully pissed that someone had spoken to them in such a way, and so she got up to go and confront the man, and on her way out, my other cousin and neighbour arrived, whom she also sent inside.

She was concerned about where I was, but Daniel made it clear that I ran in the opposite direction of the man and that he would go out looking for me (which he didn't). My mum made her way up to the play park and saw the man pacing back and forth up and down his driveway. He didn't seem angry or upset; he apparently didn't seem like anything besides someone marching back and forth, which took my mother's mood from enraged to confused.

She walked up to the front gate and let herself in, which made the man stop almost immediately and stare at her. I am surprised that she didn't turn back and go home at that point, because that's what I and what I imagine anyone would have done, but as I said in Part 1, I am a coward. The man marched up to my mum and started to berate with her about trespassing on his property, which she met by berating with him about terrifying some kids.

This apparently went on for a couple minutes before he said something that terrified her. My mum didn't say exactly what he said because she said that she was trying to forget it, but he said something along the lines of, "I will show both of you what it feels like to have somebody on your property when you don't want them there, and then I'll shut those fucking kids up forever." He tried to grab her at that point, but she quickly moved away and left his yard, swiftly walking back home.

this really affected my mum. But that was the answer I got from her. I gave her a hug and apologized for pressing her to tell me, and we got back to dinner shortly after. I don't regret her telling me, but it just feels like knowing the end of a movie and seeing all of the hints leading up to it, recontextualizing a lot of stuff.

It had been about a month, maybe a month and a half, since the first initial incident with the man; we hadn't seen him since, and I was forgetting about it until I went to the shops one day. For context, my parents had started to let me go to the shops by myself to grab little things for them. I was young at the time, and the shops were across the road from me, so getting there wasn't an issue. One day, my dad asked me to go and grab a loaf of bread for him.

He gave me two 2-dollar coins and sent me on my way to the shops. I was getting used to doing this on my own and enjoying my independence. I grabbed the bread, which was on the far side of the large supermarket, and made my way towards the registers.

I stopped by the toy aisle and took a look at all of the low-quality, mass-produced action figures that I desperately wanted. This was part of my routine; even now, if I wanted something but didn't have money to get it, I would just look at it. But on this occasion, I wish I had just continued to the registers. I felt two hands push me to the ground from my left. I was shocked for a moment, as I didn't fully know what had just happened. The sticky and dusty floor beneath me hurt.

It took me a second to look at my attacker, and when I did, I immediately knew that this was very wrong. It was the old man from up the road; he had found me in the place that I had hid from him just a month prior. He started to shout at me, but I couldn't understand what he was saying. I don't know if it was the adrenaline ringing in my ears or his rage just taking over, but the tone in which he was shouting shook me.

I tried to get up to run, and when I planted my foot on the ground to get up, he kicked it out from below me, which made me fall back on the ground. Thank God a staff member arrived at this point; they must have heard his shouting from across the store and come to check on what was happening. I didn't get a good look at the staff member, but I am thankful for them.

As I got up to run with the loaf of bread in my hand, I could hear the man reacting to me getting away, and it took everything in me not to look behind me to look at him, but I knew that he was furious. I ran straight out of the store with the bread without realising it and almost threw up from all of the emotions.

I told my parents when I got home, and they both made it clear that I wouldn't be going on any shopping trips by myself from here on out. They didn't think about how me and my sister walked together to school, which in hindsight should have been something that they thought of.The trip to my school wasn't a long one; it was just over a kilometre long, or just over half a mile, but the trip was still tough on small legs. There were quite a few hills, which added time to our trip there, and the path went along a creek with nothing around it.

It was nice and isolated, which helped relax my mind after school. Not long after the supermarket incident, me and my sister were walking home from school and just made our way to the beginning of the path along the creek when we saw a suv that had been parked there for what I assumed had been a while. I thought it was empty, but as you could probably guess, it wasn't. We turned to enter the creek when the SUV car door opened, and we heard someone shouting out to us "Hey, do you guys want a drive home", It was the man. My sister, who was always trusting of others, started to walk towards the truck, but I quickly held her back.

"What's wrong?" the man said in a cheerful tone.

This was very different from the unintelligible screaming from just the week before, and I obviously wanted nothing to do with this man. I quickly started to lead my sister towards the creek, and the man quickly scooted over towards the door. "Wait up; I will walk you home." I should have run up the hill towards the school, but instead I started to sprint down the creek. Looking back at this, I feel stupid.Daniel was faster than me, and the man had been able to catch up to him in seconds, but for some reason he didn't leave his truck.

All I heard was another unintelligible scream and his truck driving away. My sister was beyond pissed that we didn't get a ride home and that we had to walk, but I didn't care. She and I were safe, and so we continued walking along the path. Thinking back to it, the path was beautiful and connected on either side to small, quiet streets--the perfect in-between of isolation. Sadly, my young mind didn't realise that the creek opened to two quiet streets, and so when I saw that same silver SUV on the street at the end of the path, I froze.

What could I have done? I felt powerless and had to take care of my sister, who was only now figuring out that this man may not have good intentions. I decided that the best course of action was to cross the creek and walk through the bushes to the other side. This was a beyond dangerous idea as there were slippery rocks, animals, and running water. This very easily could have injured or killed us, but somehow we managed.

We climbed over logs of wood and under tree branches, through prickly bushes, and through large plants. but we managed to do it and crossed over to another road that we followed towards the main road, which took us home.

Obviously, those two SUVs could have been different, but at the time I was certain they were the same, and even now I am not 100% sure if they were different.

I only found out about this later, but my parents got the police involved at this point, but based on the fact that more stuff happened, I am going to say that they probably didn't do much.There were a few other things that happened throughout this time, like mail being stolen, our bins being pushed over, and the front door knocking at the early hours of the morning that we knew was him, although we had no real proof.

The last thing that I will bring up before I end this post is something that I am not 100% sure was a dream or not. For context, my dad used to have "campouts" with me and my sister; we would sleep out on the couch, and my dad would sleep on a mattress on the floor.

The couches we would sleep on were right next to the front door in the living room. and we would watch movies with pizza or some other type of takeaway. It was really fun, and I remember those nights, but one particular night will stick with me. Everyone else went to sleep, and Naruto was on.I hadn't watched or read Naruto at that point, but I recognised the characters. I was sitting directly next to the large window that looked out onto the driveway. I was just enjoying doing nothing when I saw some movement out on the driveway, and so I looked out, and there he was, walking up to our front door, wearing his white pants and white button up t-shirt.

He was staring directly at our front door with such focus that it felt like nothing would break it, but something did, and it was me. He looked at me, and I could see in his eyes that it was funny to him. He simply held his hand up, waved at me, and then placed one finger on his mouth as if he were telling me to shush, and then he jogged away.

I surprisingly fell asleep not long later, and for the longest time I thought it was a dream until I read all of Naruto and recognised the scene.

It was then that I realised that it might not actually have been a dream and that he might have been attempting something, and after what my mum had told me, I think I know what he was trying to do.

Chapter 3

&#x200B;

It was summer, and the local council decided to have a fair. The local council hired a few clowns, some face-painting stations, food trucks, and bouncy castles at the local football field.

Of course, me and my sister were beyond excited to go. For a young child, this was the hottest ticket in town, and my parents were happy to take us as it was just down the road and free. I remember the field being beyond busy; the crowd was difficult to walk in and even harder to see through, but we managed to find ourselves right next to a giant blow-up bouncy slide.

As it was summer, the actual balloon of the slide burned to the touch, and the sun made me feel like I was slowly melting.

Regardless of this, I must have spent at least 40 minutes going up and down that slide. I was having too much fun and didn't notice that both my parents and sister had gone missing in the giant crowd of people. I got down from the slide, put my shoes and socks back on, and started to make my way through the crowd.

I didn't actually know where I was going, and I remember feeling incredibly anxious as I waddled around the fair. It wasn't until I felt a hand on my shoulder and then on my forearm that I felt a little safer. It was my dad, I thought; he had found me.

I couldn't actually tell whose arm it was, as the angle at which it was holding my arm made it difficult to look at in a crowd. The whole day was overly stimulating, and I wasn't thinking clearly. I should have known from how hard the hand was gripping me or the fact that it was leading me to the parking lot that something was wrong.

I only really felt terror when I saw my parents running towards me, running faster than I had ever seen them run. Adrenaline immediately coursed through my veins, and I pivoted my body around and immediately saw the leathery hand on my arm and white pants. The link was connected in my mind as to who this was.

My mother's scream was the first thing I heard, and the angry or annoyed grunt of the old man followed it. He started to jog with me towards his truck, but I had started to fight back against his grip.He may have been old, but he was stronger than any elderly person should be, and he was faster too. Everything about this man was wrong, and it may have been my young mind making it all up, but I still believe that something was very weird about him; no elderly person should be like this. At this point, I was only a couple feet away from his car, and as he opened the door, I felt two hands on my right arm that pulled me hard against the man's grip.

The man's grip held on before my dad came out from behind me and slammed the old man's head into his car, which loosened his grip on me. At this point, my mother grabbed me and ran, and we went straight home. Apparently, they didn't notice me slip away on the bouncy slide, and they ran into some family friends who offered to take care of my sister while they searched for me.I don't know what type of person it takes to do something like that in such a populated area, but this man was not normal, not in the slightest.

My dad returned later that night; he looked really roughed up and drained of all energy. From what I had gathered over the years, they got into a pretty brutal fight that ended with the police breaking it up. My dad didn't get into that much trouble considering that he had called the police on the man before, but they still took him to the station to give a statement.When he sat down on the couch, he looked exhausted, bruises forming all over and a cut on his lip and upper eyebrow still leaking blood, but he had a smile on his face, and I could hear him telling my mum that it was over. They were both hopeful, and so was I.

A couple weeks later, my cousins came back over, and Daniel wanted to know everything. He felt like he was the main victim and deserved to know everything because he was the one that the man shouted at and the one that the man wanted to get the most.I don't disagree that the man would probably try to hurt him on sight, but it felt weird to me—almost like he was trying to take credit for something that to him sounded like a creepy story but to my family was real. Anyway, we decided to go out for a bit.

My parents trusted us because we were with my older cousin. We went up to the usual play park, which was across the street from the man's currently vacant house. Daniel was telling us all about how he swore that he saw him near his house.

Keep in mind that he lives almost three hours away. I am not saying that he is a liar, but I am saying that he wanted to be part of this. Anyway, we were playing hide-and-seek. Tay, our neighbour, was seeking, and she had only just started to count down from 60.

I always tagged along with Daniel because he always found the best spots. We ran across the road towards the man's house, and Daniel jumped the fence, which I immediately stopped at. "Come on," he said from the other side of the waist-high fence.

"No one will find us", The house felt like a void that we would get sucked into, and I had up until this point refused to even be near it, but for some reason I agreed.

I joined him in the man's yard, and to my shock, Daniel wanted to go deeper into his home, not just his yard. I made it clear that this was a very bad idea; even if he was in custody, jail, or whatever, we would be breaking into someone's home. Daniel didn't seem scared by it, though.

I think the whole idea of being in the man's house seemed too attractive to him. We went around the side fence into his backyard; it was overgrown, almost like no one had been living there for years. I made my way towards his back window and looked inside. From what I could make out, he was a hardcore minimalist, only having a TV, chair, fireplace, and shelf that housed some photos of a much younger man and some medals.

He was a veteran; it changes nothing to me, but it explains his above-average speed and strength, especially for his age. The sound of a door sliding open almost made me yell in fear. Daniel had found an unlocked sliding door and wanted to venture inward.

I ran around to find him, but he was already inside before I could stop him. At this point, I was also curious to find out more, but I understood the risk of this all.

It didn't matter if I understood it because I went in with him. The rest of the house reflected the living room; the kitchen had a fridge and a stove, and the dining room only had a small table with one wooden chair. There was no decoration on the walls or signs of life besides these sad reminders of how lonely the man had been.

As I said, this changes nothing for me. I hate this man more than anyone can know. We made our way upstairs and found two completely empty rooms and one bedroom—a single bed with a bedside table filled with different types of weapons—a hatchet, a knife, and a knuckle duster.

I had never seen a knuckle duster before, and I successfully fought the urge to take it and put it on. This was something that Daniel failed to do, as he almost immediately grabbed it, which I almost hit him for. We continued searching the house, and Daniel had the idea that he must have something weird in his wardrobe, and when we opened it, he gave a disappointed sigh as there was nothing inside except a few white button-ups and white pants.

This especially creeped me out as he never wore anything else. We made our way back down the stairs and into the living room, and to our surprise, we missed the table that sat next to the couch; it was just out of view and only had one drawer. Daniel opened it and struggled to get it out fast, but when he did, we found something profoundly strange. It was a single photo; neither of us could make out what it was, but we knew that it looked familiar.

Daniel sat down in the chair bored, and it was only then that we heard Tay scream out that she had given up. Daniel shot up and sprinted back out to the backyard. We had both completely forgotten about her, but as I put the photo back into the drawer, something stood out to me about the photo: the fence was navy blue.

This was something unusual in my area, and I knew of only one navy blue fence in the suburb, our side door entrance fence. This realisation made the photo seem so much clearer. The white pebbles on the ground leading to the backyard, the cream colour of the garage next to it, and the green bush at the end of the path—this was my home. He had a photo of my home.

I quickly met back up with Daniel and Tay, and we went back home. I should of told my parents, but I was scared that I would be in trouble if they found out that we were in his home. I understand why we would be, but I still didn't want to live up to it.

About a month after that, we were having another campout with me, my dad, and my sister. Both my sister and my dad had fallen asleep with the TV still on, illuminating the room. It was one of those weird situations where you were both really comfortable and really uncomfortable.

That was my situation, and on most nights I love this feeling, but that feeling will always be tied to this night. I was drifting off to sleep as well, but I heard the sliding backdoor open slowly. I peered up above the couch and saw a silhouette of a man standing in the doorway. I froze with fear and started to cry. My dad woke up at this point. I am not entirely sure how; maybe it was a parental instinct, but he knew almost immediately that something was wrong.

He got off the bed and crouched towards the dining room, which is where the backdoor was. The other man had begun to walk slowly through the house at this point, murmuring to himself. To my horror, I recognised the pants—the bright white pants. So many questions went through my mind, the most prevalent one being 'how he was in custody'. But none of that mattered because there he was, standing in my dining room, holding something.

My dad charged him from around the corner and tackled him into the wall. The old man punched him in the arm, and my dad immediately dropped that arm. It was the knuckle dusters that Daniel was wearing. It was at this point that the lights turned on. I don't know if it was my dad or the man, but they came on, and my dad made a noise of pure horror.

Both men were fully healed from their last fight, but my dad took a real beating. I had always expected that the old man had had his ass kicked, but now I am not so sure. My dad was standing in the doorway to the living room, shielding us with his body. My sister was awake and crying at this time, as was I, and my mum also ran down the stairs and immediately saw everything that was going on. The man had lunged at my dad with a thing in his hand that I could see was a hatchet.

My dad threw himself to the side, and his other arm got scrazed by the hatchet, drawing blood. My mum at this point leapt towards the old man and pushed him into the kitchen bench, which made him scream. But he was up almost as fast as he was down. He slashed at my mum and missed her, and my dad ran to the other room and started to call the police.

My mum was dodging his slashes while also throwing things at him. Once she got to the knife block, she armed herself with two knives and threw one of them, and the handle hit him in the face. knocking him back, my mum took the opportunity and drove the knife into his shoulder. which made him scream again. He fell to the ground and didn't try to get up until the police arrived. After this happened, we moved—not too far away, maybe just half an hour away.

Even though we live so close to that place, we have never returned. As much as I have been tempted to go back and relive some stuff, for the time being, I am pretty comfortable staying here. Apparently, he paid bail and was staying in the hospital for a while before staying at somebody else's house.I know that he made his way back to his house before making his way to my home. It creeps me out to think that I could have been in his home at the same time as him.

That was the last time I saw the man. I know nothing about him beyond the small details I've gathered from his home and his actions. I don't know if he is still alive, but on the off chance that he is, I hope I never see him again. And to all of you reading this, please don't play knock-and-run because you don't know who you could be messing with.
