You might wanna read this because this CAN happen to you. You want proof? Go read some other guy's post about them on here. It's called *I'm being hunted, this is a warning for you.* SOMEONE doing this is paying attention to the comments after what happened.

I worked as a security guard in Buffalo over in New York in one of those casinos near Niagara Falls. Given that this was one of the closest places to stay by the landmark, it was one of the heaviest parts to work for, at least from my experience. I got used to the usual one could expect in this type of job, but certain events have changed so quickly that I can’t tell what is real except for my incoming doom.

I was working in the early afternoons, around 1 PM, give or take, and I was walking about when I saw a group of friends - I assumed - taking pictures. They were somewhat uncomfortable because a man in that picture looked to have one too many drinks at the time, rambling in some hysteria in the most annoying tone I ever heard.

He didn’t really look the part of a criminal. All I could remember was him having an athletic build, long black hair tied to a ponytail, a red sweater, a white shirt, black jeans, and converse shoes. He had tan skin and a clean-shaved face. As he continued to harass the group, which I guess consisted of some kids in their college years, I approached him, advising that he move along, or he will be escorted out.

The group left immediately while I was dealing with this guy. Strangely, he didn’t reek of alcohol, his eyes didn’t look affected, his speeches were clear with no slurrings, and he walked fine. While that beer in his hands was full, I wasn’t one to take chances.

But there was something off about this man. Looking into his eyes, I had a huge spike of anxiety… Something that I never felt at this level before just from someone. It was like the future was in jeopardy, and the closer I approached him, I could hear the heartbeat in my ears and a developing headache. I was questioning myself “Why?” because he didn’t look like someone who could kill anyone with a single punch, nor was he aggressive. Actually-

He acted out the opposite.

"Sorry, sorry-” I probably heard 4 ‘sorries’ in two seconds with how fast this guy talked in a light tone, and I mean really, really fast. It was a nice change of pace compared to the slobbering sentences I often dealt with. “I get carried away often, I promise to not do it again. But I did have a question. Are you hiring?”

So while this dude understood and at least apologized, I knew he would be a problem if he was going to be my coworker. Sadly this wasn’t my choice, and I think what I said next was how shit hit the fan.

“You’re gonna have to speak to my manager, I can refer him to you. Just write me your name and phone number-”

“John?”

Now, I only used a random name to cover my manager since I DIDN’T want to be dragging anyone else here, but since he did mention my boss’s name, I questioned him if they knew each other.

“Yup! For the record, I work with computers, cameras, and just about every technological gadget going on over here. The thing is your manager was somewhat concerned about this photo right here.” He pulled his phone out and showed it to me.

It was a photo of a broken-down subway door with shattered glass. He swiped, and it was another set of busted doors from the other side of the car. I never heard of this, so I assumed he was somewhat witnessed.

I didn’t know what to think of this, nor did I really care, but I sure as hell didn’t want to continue. I told him that if he wanted the job, he’d have to speak to the manager in question and that I had to return to work. He agreed and skipped his way into the casino's deeper parts. As I eyed him leaving, my body relaxed. It was like an adrenaline dump suddenly hit me and I was weirded out.

I went back to the office, monitoring the cameras as my coworker switched roles. It was the same as I watched, but I saw something weird in the corner of my eye. I turned and my heart sank, my blood boiled, and I felt like I was about to faint.

On one of the monitors was a taped photo of the front of my house.

Without hesitation, I approached my manager, confronting him as I thought this was a God-forsaken prank. He never saw my house, he never knew what area I lived in, or anything like that. As I had more questions, I was furious and ready to beat the fuck out of whoever this was, but I opened the door and I saw him… differently.

He was sitting on his desk, his head on his desk like he was sleeping. He would never do this, or post very private information for any workers to see. I woke him up and I saw his face a mess. He looked like he was crying, his face was somewhat pale, and his speech was slow. He didn’t show signs of somewhat taking drugs, or vodka in one sitting, so this was all strange to me.

But that didn’t stop me from our ‘talk’. It went like this from what I remembered.

“Hey, what’s going on with you?!”

“I don’t know, man. I don’t know anymore.”

“What the fuck do you mean?! First off, who put this in the monitor room? I never told anyone about my place, and I didn’t say it’s okay to take a damn photo for everyone to see. Who did it?!”

“What? I never saw that. That wasn’t me-”

“Well, someone did! I want to find out because that is a safety concern, let alone an invasion of privacy! Who?!”

“Stop yelling at me! Please, spare me! God, please! I had enough, don’t talk. Don’t talk, and let them to- I can’t, I can’t anymore, I quit! I’m sorry, alright. I’m-”

My boss broke down, and this whole scene ended up sending him to the hospital, and I ended up quitting on the spot, but not before I questioned every coworker I could find.

As much as everyone understood the severity of this situation, no one admitted to it. On my way home, I was thinking of why things turned out the way they were. At this point, I had a major fear lingering in the back of my mind - my safety.

Somebody exposed my house. While I’m a total recluse, I’m obviously also not one to spread something so private for a reason. With me living alone, I can attest that there was nothing more important than every detail I could see. While I hoped this was nothing more than a sick prank that, somehow, drove our manager insane, I always imagine the worst kind of people running across and doing God knows what.

From the driveway to my front door and living room, I took my time to check around the yard, the house, and every corner imaginable no matter how long that took. After confirming everything wasn’t touched, moved, or destroyed, I showered and went straight to bed. I may be out of a job, but I thought things weren’t bad, and I could fix it.

I woke up with one of the weirdest feelings. I felt something crawling on my arm, so I turned over the blanket and that was when things got worse from here. I didn't see anything on my skin, but it was more like something was INSIDE my skin.

The worst part was that I could see it moving, bulging just above my skin. I panicked, ready to grab my phone for the trip to the ER until I was paralyzed. My whole inside was rattling and moving under my skin. My bones, my veins, and my lungs were being disoriented and I could only scream the hardest I’ve ever had, unable to move like I was being torn apart.

Then, it stopped. Whatever it was, it made my arms dead, I was unable to move. I lay on the bed, refusing to move even if I was hungry or wanted to use the bathroom. I couldn't believe it, even now. I have no idea why and how this happened. I was in complete shock, I could feel myself panicking when I heard something that made me jump from the living room.

“Get out of bed.”

For some reason, I recognized this voice, but I had no idea who it was until I heard it again.

“You’re not gonna get hurt anymore, just get up.”

In a flash, an image popped up in my head of someone who sounded exactly like that voice. It was crystal clear who it was now. I left my room and saw my TV in the living room with someone inside. The face was of a young man with black hair in a ponytail and a red sweater, waving at me.

I was angry, but I sat down because I knew punching my TV wouldn’t do anything, but something threw me off. At first, I thought this was televised from a station, or pre-recorded. But his eyes were on me as I moved like he watched my every move despite no cameras being present. I only sat on the couch, feeling whatever was inside me now moving into the back of my thigh and… disappear.

“What the fuck did you do to me?! What do you want?!”

“Hey, hey, man. I’m sorry you gotta go through this, but just know this is necessary, alright?” I swear this man’s tone just made me wanna choke him out, he didn’t seem phased or anything. He was just like when I saw him in person.

So there I am, talking to the guy who seemed to be in charge of putting something in me and watching me like I was in a red room with that grin on his face on a television. I was thinking of ways to understand without possibly - does he even get mad? - pissing him off and sending me into a coma thanks to the rejected actor of the parasite from Aliens.

That thought I had right there? That came back to me later…

“Were you the piece of shit that doxxed my house?”

“What?”

“My fucking house…”

“What about it?”

“DID YOU TAKE A PHOTO AND TAPE IT ON ONE OF THE TVS FROM MY WORK?! WAS THAT NOT YOU?!”

“Oooooh… That was a drawing. Actually I-”

“BITCH!”

“Sorry, sorry. Yeah, that was me.”

“And did you put… whatever the hell this is in me?”

“Yeah.”

“Why? Why the fuck did you do that? Was it because you didn’t get the damn job?!”

“Not really, you gave us the answer anyways for OUR job. Thanks!” He smiled.

“But everything’s for a reason. You see, we’re doing what’s called ‘The Destruction’. I know this is a lot to take in, but we really, really don’t have much time, buddy. Let me ask you something. You’ve used Reddit from time to time, right?”

“Yeah?”

“On your table, there’s a piece of paper I want you to read. It’s about one of the posts written. I want you to read, keep to yourself, keep your thoughts to yourself, and only write everything after you say what you’re gonna do.”

Despite being confused, I agreed and picked up the paper, and sat back down to read while he was watching me do so. I’m not gonna restate what I read, but like I said in the beginning, read *I’m being hunted, this a warning for you*. 

Underneath - no usernames will be mentioned - there was a comment describing the OP’s strange way of describing where he was from. I mean, it's true. No one would say that if they were from there.

“So I assume you read that comment about that, right? Well, the thing is, he said that because he WASN’T from there.”

I looked up slowly. I had a gut feeling something was going wrong, aside from this morning, of course.

“Let me explain this simply. You heard of the phenomena of ‘extraterrestrial beings’ or ‘aliens’? Have you heard the debate about how they look? Have you ever thought they would look like YOU? Well, man, certain species outside your solar system do, and a particular set of species has made its way down to earth, escaping from our duty to eliminate threats to life as we know it. I gotta say, I wouldn’t blame you for not knowing about the subway incident, as our fellow wrote it as such, the technology here is so easy to play with, I think it may be THE easiest. Anyways, these aliens are trying to make a life here, and even try to use some of their technology on themselves to erase memories of their lives prior, so that they’d fit in and move on, that is why he was really… not a New Yorker, after all-”

“So you’re telling me that Earth secretly had an alien invasion to live a peaceful life?”

“Yeeees, and no. They’re escaping from their punishments and trying to correct things. But, the law is the law, and we’re the only ones to have the final say about that.”

“*We*?”

“Don’t worry about that.”

“Okay, but… why am I involved? I’m pretty sure I was born on Earth like a regular Earthling, so why drag me in?”

“Because your mom isn’t.”

I froze. Speechless.

“Your mom is one of the condemned, but she wasn’t meant to have a child, her biology doesn’t add up to what we know her race. That’s why we checked on you, and that is what that thing is for. It seems she had done a lot of work to try to make things harder.”

“My mom is an alien?”

“Yup! Now, we need to do something-”

I was in shock, sitting there as the man rambled on. He just told me that my life has all been a lie. My mind was numb, and I couldn’t process anything else at the time until the familiar pain jolted me hard enough for me to fall on the floor.

It lasted longer, and I started puking all over the floor as my body spasmed violently. My eyesight was blurring, and I couldn’t see anything except for bright colors that were everywhere every second. It felt like my body was being chewed apart, thousands of needles were ripping apart my bones, my lungs crushed in and out, and I felt my arms and legs being crushed as I couldn’t scream because of my vomit.

Then, it stopped, and I could smell last night's dinner all over me when I lay there, staring at the wall.

“Ready to listen, bro?”

I said nothing.

“Good! Now, the thing is, my other pals are doing their own thing. It’s currently… Six AM your time, it seems, and since we’re in bought time, I’m gonna need you to go to your mom and obey my instructions. You’ll hear my voice through that thing.”

I still said nothing.

“This is a good time to take a breather because things are gonna become harder. No worries, I’ll guide ya, you’re now in the hands of a professional.”

Then the TV turned off while I sat there. When I got up to change, I realized that I was sitting for almost a couple of hours, watching the blank TV screen in silence.

The thoughts of the event made me sick enough to not leave the house, not to attend work, and never eat anything during the day. My mom was an alien, hunted by another group of aliens for whatever crime she committed.

I remember a sharp sting in my head before I blacked out, and when I woke up, I found myself in my mom’s house. A forty-minute drive from my place.

“Why? Why did you do this?”

My single mother was lying on a bed with the ceiling light on, watching me with a tear streaming down her face as she was groaning in pain. I opened my eyes, realizing that I was standing up, feeling my hands warm and wet, but I couldn’t move my head to see what it was. I could only feel whatever it was dangling, touching my arms like it had several, thin legs, and the liquid was running down my forearm.

She was on her flower-printed bed next to the teddy bear I gave her from my trip last year with no arms, no legs, and a missing eye.

I wanted to scream, I wanted to throw up, and I wanted to be scared… But I didn’t feel anything, I couldn’t feel emotions, and I couldn’t move my body. My pupils moved independently, changing to the window curtains that were shut for the night.

I couldn’t see her anymore, only hear. I heard her scream, panicking as the bed creaked followed by some clicking noises to my right side, to the wall.

“Screaming isn’t gonna get ya anywhere. This whole room is separated from the outside now.”

My mom continued to shout for a while, which was long enough for me to feel some soreness in my legs, but that didn’t happen, strangely enough. I was a literal statue, only able to hear the situation without seeing her, or the man on the TV earlier.

“Ya done? I need to ask very important questions about your friends that’s around here.”

“I don’t know shit!”

“It’s no use lying, I already have your son in control now. I’m trying to make it easier for him since I think he should be fine staying here.”

“You… You fucking pieces of shits think what you’re doing is right?”

“We’ve already eliminated about thirty peeps down at that tunnel, but one of them escaped because they were given a good ole’ hand. Y’know Earth’s technology is so easy to tamper with that even you could do it. Y’know about that, right?”

My mom went silent when the man decided to work on his thing a little more.

“Ah! You are smart… very smart. This is actually getting fun by the minute. Unfortunately, the law is the law, and you still need to be punished. Don’t worry about your son, he’s not going to do anything, our little guy in him will make sure of that. Now, any last words?” My mom spoke in a weird language that sounded like static, gurgle, and gibberish. The man replied the same followed by a short conversation.

Then my head was forced by something invincible to watch him, sitting on one of the rocking chairs.

I saw my hand holding my mom’s severed arms with her guts dangling down.

“Remember this, bud. Revenge is best served cold, but it can be served hot. That’s why people love to do it, and a lot are doing it, but they never expect how much they have to pay that bill, including the tips… Thanks for helping!” He gave me a quick wave before I closed my eyes and I found myself on my bed, back to my room.

To this day, the “thing” in me never left, it’s still here, controlling my emotions, my fears, and everything about me. My mom was a criminal from outer space, I am the son of that thing. I’m currently trying to look for a job, and while my emotions and my thoughts are mainly controlled, my memory of that night never changed, especially since I was given the knowledge of what they said.

My mom: *Who and what are you?*

The man with an athletic build, long black hair tied in a ponytail, a red sweater, a white shirt, black jeans, and converse shoes: *The Elements. We are the ones responsible for the existence of all things. Me? I am the Chaos, the reason why there are things never meant to make sense for a reason throughout the universe. There are things better kept unsaid and hidden, and you made a very big shift that’ll come soon.*

Mom: *How come we never heard of you? How come we show up now?!*

The Man: *It’s… complicated, but we only show up when we need to. That’s how it’s been since we created THIS universe.* *Anyway, I don’t have time to talk. My job is finished. Bye!*
