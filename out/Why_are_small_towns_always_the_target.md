"When you conduct an experiment you cannot test the entire population, you have to take a sample. Big enough to get valid results but small enough so you can manage the data and get enough volunteers.

Well, in this case, the participants aren't always volunteers but they usually do get a nice payoff. Mostly in values that they cherish. For some, it's money, fortune, health, you name it. They mostly live without fear, especially when they are at least a little naive.

There is also a mixture of different treatments. Most don't seem realistic but some really are. 

The town you're from is an example. There are no supernatural influences, even if the people might believe it."

This was supposed to be a therapy session but the psychologist did most of the talking. She didn't seem very competent in her job, smart sure but also kind of wrong. Not because of her appearance though. Her hair was neatly put up, she was wearing a grey cardigan and glasses with milky white frames. 

Kind of how someone might dress after looking up what a therapist looks like.

I sighed.

"I'm not *from* that town. The others are. I only lived there for a week or something."

She raised an eyebrow.

"Or something? You don't know how long you lived there?" 

"You just held that whole monologue about experiments but aren't you a therapist?"

She smiled and put her pen down.

"Don't answer questions with questions or we'll be here forever. But I'll answer this one for you. First of all, psychology is a wide spectrum, if you want to understand humans, you need research as well. As for me specifically, I don't conduct them. I just know about them. And I suppose you know that I'm not a therapist in the usual sense. Do you even know what a real therapist is?"

I don't think she meant to sound condescending but she sure did. Still, when she talked about the reason I was there I felt a shiver down my spine. 

"Jeez, I'm not an idiot."

"Oh no I'm sorry, I suppose what I really meant was do you remember what a therapist is?"

"Yes. I remember a lot. Well, it's getting more by the day."

She nodded.

"Can you tell me your name?"

"[Charlie](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/zxjkmw/every_year_a_new_family_joins_our_town_something/)," I hissed.

"You're angry. That's not bad. I would be too. How old are you, Charlie?"

"Seventeen."

She pulled a face in response. I'm not sure if it was showing disgust or if she felt empathy for a split second. 

"Almost 18. Yikes."

I nodded. We both knew what that meant. My parents had willingly joined a cult that could murder any adult whenever they want and they decided to take me with them to this community just a year before I became an adult.

This could've been my last year on this earth if our neighbor didn't help me to escape that insane town. I wouldn't have made it on my own and my parents had enough drugs and other means to keep me there. 

I wonder how brainwashed they must be to willingly *choose* to go to a place like that. And while I will hate my parents forever for doing this to us, I'm also afraid of what will happen to them. Will they be punished because I ran away?

"How did Cha- sorry, Lucia's dad find you?" I asked her after the room had been filled with some silence.

"He didn't. I found you. We're pretty good at knowing where all the different residents are at most times. I mean, when an escape feels as easy as yours did, there's usually something or someone behind it, making sure things go smoothly."

I felt a cold sweat forming.

"Why would you do that? How are you connected to that place?" 

She smiled.

"Because it's one of our samples. A very self-sufficient one until now, but you disrupted it and we want to understand how you were able to do so. Don't worry, I won't snitch on you. If the people of Agsbury knew they'd come for you and shred you into pieces and bury you deep down or throw your corpse into their lake. I'm not here to meddle, only to understand and observe. In all those years nobody has ever gotten out of Agsbury. And not because there is strict security or borders around town. They haven't been necessary until now because the people there accept living like that. They don't want to leave. They think they need to *deserve* it to live there and do anything for it. And if the other residents decide that it's time for them to die, well then that's how it has to go, you know?"

I still wasn't sure if I could trust this woman but what other chance did I have? We couldn't go back to my old home, we couldn't try to contact anyone from our past lives because-

Why couldn't we? 

I tried to remember what exactly led us to this place, this therapist's office. 

"Where are the people I was with? Lucia, Benny, their dad?"

She tapped her finger on the small table next to her seat. 

"I will be honest with you, Charlie. Because I want you to be honest as well, alright? The girl and her brother are fine, I suppose. They are having conversations similar to ours right now. The girl did however have a little outburst after we informed her about what happened. She was screaming around, I'm surprised you didn't hear her."

I gave her a questioning look, both curious and scared. 

She took a deep breath.

"Well, the man committed suicide. Jumped out of the window while a colleague was getting him a glass of water. You're lucky it was on the other side of the building, blood and body parts everywhere."

She moved her body in an overdramatic shiver while I felt like throwing up. The man who saved my life had just ended his own life and she was talking like these things happen every day. 

I stared at the ground, not sure what to make of that news. I thought about Lucia. She'd been through so much already and now the only person who stepped up for her was dead.

But suddenly my feelings turned into something different. Fear. Why would I believe anything she was saying? If they were working with the people from Agsbury, those psychopathic cult members, they would kill us as well and ship our bodies back to that town so they could use them as a part of their disgusting ceremonies or whatever. 

I looked around the room for a way to escape. Maybe if I was fast enough I could run to the door but who says there isn't someone waiting for me on the outside? I couldn't try the window because we were far too high up. 

"I know what you're thinking. I see your eyes move around, you know."

"You killed him, didn't you?" I whispered. 

She shook her head.

"No, Charlie. I told you I'd be honest. This man is the very first person who willingly left Agsbury and took three children with him. Do you know how badly I wanted to have a glimpse inside his brain? And I mean his thoughts, not the goo that got spread all over the concrete."

I really hoped the person talking to Lucia and Benny wasn't like this woman.

"Why would he escape just to kill himself? It doesn't make any sense," I mumbled.

"Well, the spell was lifted. Not an actual spell but you know what I mean. His perception of his former life. This man had been a part of this 'cult-like community' for many years. Years in which he helped to murder at least a dozen people. It's really surprising that he snapped out of his mind at all, as I said nobody has ever left Agsbury before. But well, with a clear mind, he remembered everything he did. This is just my interpretation but wouldn't you wanna kill yourself as well?" 

\--

After minutes of silence, she got up to get me a glass of water which I didn't drink. She laughed and called me suspicious but at least gave me some time before continuing our conversation. Enough time to make me question how I ended up this way. 

My life hadn't been particularly great all the time. A lot of memories were still hazy but I do know that I didn't have the nicest childhood.

We moved around a lot. Dad had a gambling addiction, mum had a very difficult temper. We didn't have many relatives, the ones we did, couldn't stand my parents. I spent most of my time alone, hiding wherever I could inside the different shitty apartments we moved to before Agsbury, with books. Books I hardly remember now. 

I guess a part of me can understand that my parents were susceptible to the influence of some cult promising them a perfect life. Although I'm not sure how they got over the 'we regularly kill people to nourish our earth' part. 

Distracted by my own thoughts I didn't realize that the therapist had been watching me this entire time. When I caught her gaze I realized that she wasn't even blinking, just staring. I remembered that she'd casually talked about some towns being supernatural earlier but shrugged it off. 

Did I have a wrong view of the world or was everybody I met insane? 

Well, except for Lucia. She was like me, even though she was trapped in that hell town so much longer than me. And now her dad had killed himself after finally saving her. 

"Don't you ever blink?" I burst out.

Finally, the therapist closed her eyes for a fraction of a second.

"Didn't wanna miss anything. To be honest, I really wanted to talk to one of the others. You were in that town for such a short time, it hasn't changed you as much as them but I would like to learn as much as I can."

"You said something about small towns being targeted. Who is targeting them? Who are you working for?" 

She shook her head.

"I'm not supposed to talk about it. Trust me, there are things happening at the moment that you don't even want to think-"

Suddenly we were interrupted by a loud alarm. I had to shelter my ears with my hands because it felt like my eardrums would explode any second. A red light filled the room in which the therapist suddenly appeared a lot more frightened.

"What's happening?" I shouted.

She moved my hands from my ears and screamed "Stay here!"

Then she ran towards the door and disappeared outside. 

My heart started racing- my fast pulse, the red right, the ringing. It was all too much but I knew I had to act. Still, I couldn't get my body to move.

Until I saw her bursting in through the door that the therapist had forgotten to close.

"Lucia?" I said but of course, she couldn't hear me. 

She said something that looked like "come" or "run", so I jumped up and followed her down the hallway. 

When I got to her, she grabbed my arm and shouted "we have to find Benny!"

We continued down the long hallway and tried to open every door we came past. Some were surprisingly unlocked but with no people inside. Other doors were locked, like one that read **Parasite Lab**. We ran further until we reached the door to a staircase and followed the stairs down. There were no more doors on our way leading us to different levels of the building. I jumped down two or three stairs at once and finally the two of us, completely out of breath, had made it to the final level. 

As I pushed open the glass door at the bottom which wasn't locked either, we finally breathed in the fresh air. 

Lucia took a step back.

"What are you doing? We need to go NOW!" I took a few rapid breaths. "I don't know what they told *you* but these people are not trying to help us." 

"I don't care, Benny is still in there."

She was right. But I also knew that it didn't matter so I grabbed Lucia's arm and pulled her away from the building which had looked very isolated from the outside but as we walked down the empty road, we started seeing more houses and buildings. 

A town?

Surprisingly, Lucia didn't fight it and we kept walking toward civilization.  

I suppose she was thinking the same thing I was.

"I'm certain we'll see him again. And the people inside that building as well." I said after we'd gotten further away. 

She nodded. 

"Yeah, our escape was far too [easy](https://www.reddit.com/r/Likeeyedid/)."
