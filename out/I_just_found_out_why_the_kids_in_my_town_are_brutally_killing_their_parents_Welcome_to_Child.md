The bus ride to juvenile detention was like being shipped to a slaughterhouse—and being completely aware that I was going to be chopped into pieces.

I suppose this was what cows felt like. 

But cows had the luxury of zero self-awareness. They just ate grass, stared at the sky, and were butchered. There is a difference between me and a cow. Cows are not given [families](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/14iwyv1/i_just_found_out_why_the_kids_in_my_town_are/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) to form a connection with, a mother and a father to love, siblings to grow bonds with; a life they think is theirs. No. Cows are fucking cows. They’re told they’re produce, they know they are produce and end up as produce. Leaning my head against the window, I squeezed my eyes shut, refusing to look outside, and taking in the early morning sunrise blooming over the horizon. If I did, I would be reminded that I didn’t belong in the town which I thought birthed me, which I thought I was a miracle baby of. When I was in fact not even human. For seventeen years (?) I had been fed a lie that was coming back to haunt me. The bus jolted, and my head hit the window with a meaty smack. I had half a mind to do it again. 

Maybe I could kill whatever I was before I could arrive at this so-called juvenile detention center, which I was guessing was a slaughterhouse for kids who survived their parents’ stupid plan. Mom thought she could “keep me forever” by blowing me up. Call me weird, but that was just backward thinking. The mystery I had been struggling to solve over the last few months had come to a climax, with me becoming part of it. And yet despite knowing why kids were brutally ripping their moms and dads apart, I still felt like something was missing, like I hadn’t even delved into the meat of it. There were still so many questions I had. Seth Daniel’s and the sheriff’s son. Had they been taken care of for good?

Is that what this place I was heading to did? Mom spoke of a biological mother who was looking for me. So, where exactly was she, and why hadn’t she found me yet? Lastly, it didn’t make sense that Mom would go to the extreme of blowing me and my twin up to avoid giving us back to the people who created us. I was positive she did not plant that device herself. I think it was already part of me, and she had control of some kind of self-destruct. I could only guess that she and the Moms of the town who bought these “artificial children” had made a pact not to give us back.  But that didn’t explain why she had another version of Freddie. Had she really loved Golden Boy so much, she decided to buy my twin again? What about me? I thought back to hours earlier before I was caught. After the death of my brother, I took Noa and ran before mom came back. 

And saw I wasn't reduced to dripping red pooling from her walls. 

“Will it hurt?”

Of all the stupid things my sister has said, this definitely takes the cake. However, I didn’t say that. Instead concentrating on doing as little damage to Noa’s eye as possible. It had to be a clean cut-- and I was already struggling with one eye myself. Thankfully, mine had stopped bleeding after a while, and I was a proud owner of a deep, cavernous hole where my right eye used to be.  I’d ripped off the sleeve of my sweater and bound it in an eye-patch-like bandage. I said I looked like a pirate.

Noa. I think she was still in shock after seeing Freddie’s death. 

Seventeen years of him, whether they were fake or real, were gone in an instant, painting the kitchen, and neither of us were acknowledging it.

I wanted to pretend our brother was still alive. I wanted to be in denial. There was time for grieving, but in that short amount of time we had together, hiding in an abandoned church, we were free to be fully and completely in denial of our brother’s demise. Surprisingly, I had not decided to kill my parents… yet.

That would come, and after seeing what Mom had done to my twin, I knew I was going to make it slow, making her suffer. But first, I had to figure out just what exactly I was, and how to escape town without having the same fate as the other kids. The sheriff’s son, Finn Novak, told me I would join him once I turned 18. I was determined to prove him wrong. And I thought I had. Until I lost four hours, waking up on my back inside an abandoned church covered in blood, with no memories of what I had been doing. According to Noa, I had been dragging her around town looking for a place to hide out. But from the look in her eyes, and the fact she couldn’t look at me properly—I knew there was something else. It’s not like I could ignore my hands slick with blood. 

No, everything was covered in blood. 

Not just my hands, but the sleeves of my jacket and my face. I could feel it painting me, staining me like I was its canvas. Noa had done her best to wash away the blood with a bottle of water, but I could still feel it caked in my fingernails and dried into my scalp. I guessed the sheriff’s son was right. Noa was trembling despite the warm night air. The two of us sat cross-legged on rotten flooring. 

I pulled back the knife, trying to smile reassuringly. But there was no way I could sugar-coat carving out her fucking eye. Instead of focusing on her question, I found my gaze flicking to stained glass windows above and couldn’t resist a scoffed laugh. What God would allow a town to do this? To create artificial children to replace the children it couldn’t have? Why did we have to suffer for whatever mistakes they had made? “Yes, it will hurt,” I said, positioning the blade in front of her right eye. “I’m taking your eye out, so obviously.” I handed her the remnants of my sweater, “bite down on this.”

Sniffling, Noa swiped at her eyes. She was always bad at hiding her tears. “Is this what killed him?"

Her words stung, and I could only bring myself to nod.

Noa bit into the material, wincing. She couldn’t stay still, rocking backward and forward, blinking rapidly despite me telling her to stop, her gaze pinpointed on the blade. With her facial expression contorting, I couldn’t map out where I was going to start. With me, I had been desperate and just plunged the teeth in. With Noa, I had time to make sure I didn’t blind her. I didn’t even know how I didn’t blind myself. “Hold still,” I muttered. “I’m going to do it on the count of the three, okay?”

I steadied her shoulders. “Stay still. Unless you want to go blind.”

“Blind?!”

“Yes,” I held her gaze, trying to keep my own quaking hand steady. “Do you want to be partially vision impaired or blown to pieces?”

I didn’t mean to say that. It just came out. And with the way Noa looked at me, I realized the gravity of my words, the way her body stiffened, her expression twisting into agony. Noa was a lot younger in her mind than she was. It didn’t take a lot to make her cry. When her eyes widened, her lips wobbling, I told her repeatedly that what happened to Freddie would not happen to her. I wouldn’t let it.  

My sister nodded, clamping her teeth into the woolen hood of my sweater. “You killed three people earlier,” she muffled into the material. She let out a squeak when she realized I could hear exactly what she was saying, and her words weren’t as muffled as she thought. What she said did not surprise me, but it did send shivers wriggling down my spine at the thought of knowing I was just like Seth Daniel’s and Finn Novak. I had almost driven myself crazy trying to figure out why they would do such a thing, why they would slaughter their own parents, and yet turning eighteen had done the same thing to me. 

They killed their parents because they were told they were nothing but products. When Noa’s body slumped against mine, I almost dropped the knife. It was like the two of us were kids again, her sneaking into my room and crawling into bed with me. Sometimes Freddie would join, sitting propped up on pillows, pretending to play on his DS while I was reading Noa horror stories, and definitely listening. There were nights when Mom did her ritual in her bedroom. I can’t explain the pain of knowing there was a possibility that wasn’t real. That I really had been born at the age of seventeen and never existed as a child. 

That I never had childhood memories of my brother and sister and was grown specifically to be sold to infertile parents. Noa pressed her head into my shoulder, still biting down on my sweater.  “It’s like you were possessed,” she whispered in a hysterical sob. What I wanted to do was block my ears so I couldn’t hear the inevitability that just like them, I was a murderer. “I couldn’t stop you. I… I screamed at you, but you killed them,” Noa shook her head. “You ripped them apart and I didn’t know what to do…except run. There was blood everywhere, and I tried to call the cops but I didn’t know what to say, and you were in some kind of trance,” my sister let out a wet-sounding sob. “Are they going to take you away too, Mara?” She lifted her head, her eyes wide and childlike, “like our brother? are they going to do the same to you?”

“No.”

I spoke too soon.

“Girls!”

The knife dropped from my hands, hitting the ground with a loud clang. I twisted around to find no other than our mother standing at the entrance. I stood stiffly, and stepped back, dragging Noa with me. Mom was already stumbling over to us, her arms stretched out like she didn’t just leave me a birthday card announcing my death and murdering my twin brother right in front of me. The closer she came, with cops following her hesitantly, I was seeing those last few seconds with my brother. I felt the phantom weight of his hands on my shoulders and his breath on my face. 

“We’re okay.” Freddie had said, instead of carving that fucking thing out of his eye. Which our mother had detonated—with a clear intention which said, “If I can’t have them? Nobody can.” I watched my brother reduced to splattered scarlet on my face and hands, on the walls, and on Noa’s face when I tried to cover her eyes. Mom suffocated me with a hug which drew all the air from my lungs. 

I could see people in white slowly moving over to us carrying weapons. “Mara.” She whispered into my ear in a breath. “You got away. Oh god, you got away! I am so, so sorry, honey. I will explain to you, I promise. But the ones behind me that are going to take you away? Baby, they’re bad people,” her voice became a hiss in my ear. “And mommy is going to save you from the bad people. Do you understand me?” Mom pulled back, holding me at arm’s length. 

But her eyes weren’t searching me. They briefly found my cowering sister before looking elsewhere. “Sweetie.” Mom maintained her smile, but it was starting to slip. Mom was never good at faking smiles at the dinner table, and when she did smile, it was going upstairs for her nightly ritual. “Where is your twin?” Her frenzied eyes turned my gut. “Where is Freddie?”

My mother’s words were like knives perforating me one by one, sticking into my spine. I shoved her away, swallowing a shriek building in my throat. After everything she had put us through, somehow my mother favored my dead twin more than me. Golden Boy. He was always her Golden Boy, her sweet Freddie who could do no wrong. And even after giving him a death sentence and killing him, somehow my mother was still looking for him. Still looking for a ghost whom I was covered in—whom I could still feel bleeding into me, all of him covering me no matter how many times Noa scrubbed at my face with bottled water. I didn’t realize I was screaming until I was being dragged backward, my arms bound behind me. 

Instantly, I went for the knife. I dove to wrap my fingers around it and if I wasn’t being violently pulled back, I knew I would have done it with no hesitation. I would have plunged the blade of the knife into my mother’s skull.  And that is what terrified me. 

Not just the look of obliviousness on her face, it was the reality that I would have killed my mother, and done worse until I was satisfied, until my hands were slick with her blood, just like my twin’s. I finally understood Seth and Finn Novak. They wanted—no, needed, to kill. To stop hurting. To release pent-up frustration and anger and pain suffocating them. “You… you killed him, Mom!” the words were escaping my mouth before I could register them. “He’s all over me. He’s on my hands, on my face! And you're asking me where he is?"

“No, Mara,” Mom spoke calmly. “I mean the other one.”

The phantom legs of an insect crept their way down my spine. 

“What?”

What she had said took a while to register, but by the time it had, I was being pulled away from my sister and mother and dragged out of the church. Other one. I saw a different version of Freddie, but I never saw its face. Could it be possible that the box I saw had another of my brother—and she just replaced him?  Is that really what we were? Could we just be deactivated and replaced like we were real dolls? Freddie had died in front of me. Seventeen years (?) of him was gone in a matter of seconds, and my mother thought she could just get another Freddie. I laughed. I mean, I didn’t mean to. 

But the absurdity of losing my brother and being painted with pieces of him, only for hours later my mother telling me she had “got another Freddie” was enough to send me over the edge.  Mom’s words reverberated in my skull as I was shoved onto the backseat of a bus with several other kids. The windows were filthy and shattered, and the seats stunk of mold and rot. But anything was better than being with her. That thought dragged me back to the present. I lifted my head. The sky was getting brighter, a new day dawning. 

Not one I would see, apparently. 

“Welcome to Child™️,” the mounted TV at the front of the bus was playing the exact same thing over and over again. “Here at Child™️, we pride ourselves on making both our customers and produce satisfied. Hello there.” The voice spoke like it was speaking directly to us. “We are sorry to watch you go, but everything must have an end. Everyone must come to an eventually. You were artificially created to be the answer to infertility and have granted so many mothers and fathers their wishes. For centuries we have not been able to birth biological children which makes all of you… miracles.” 

Unbelievably, the kids in front of me were eating the presentation up. “For that, we thank you.  We say this from the bottom of our hearts. Thank you for warming the hearts of parents everywhere.” There was a colorful animation of hundreds of test tube babies morphing into fully-fledged seventeen-year-olds in a matter of days. “Before your separation, please feel free to use our state-of-the-art facilities to make yourselves as comfortable as possible!” Photos popped up onto the screen, stock photo kids frozen in laughter. Typical. They weren’t even using us. But I couldn’t imagine any of us laughing in this kind of situation. 

“We even have WIFI!” The voice continued before an animated smiley face bloomed onto the screen. “At Child™️, we will make sure your deactivation and separation are as painless as possible. It is okay to be scared. It is okay to feel hopeless and worried. We are here for every one of our children.”

The smiley face morphed into a heart, and I scoffed.

The guy sitting in front of me turned to shoot me a glare and I found myself laughing again. “We love you,” the voice was getting faker and faker as the presentation continued on. It was like an iPhone commercial. So much shit being rolled off of the tongue and it meant nothing. Its only purpose was to market. In our case, it was telling us we were going to die and expecting us to smile and nod and accept it.

“You are our children—our only children. And for that, we thank you.” The presentation ended, but the voice continued spurting out random messages of kindness like these people could justify doing this and getting away with it. “Please do not be scared. You should not feel fear being part of something beautiful. Natural. Extraordinary.  Take a deep breath. Look at the sky. Revel in all your memories,” the voice almost sounded sympathetic, and I might have believed it if it didn’t sound like a fucking cheap text-to-speech AI. “Your Second-Generation parents love you and always will. It’s time for you all to move on. Moving on is hard, we know that. But here at Child™️, we are here to help you through your final days. It is okay to be scared. It is okay to question yourselves. That is why you are coming to stay with us for a while. So your final days can be peaceful.” 

The video had a hypnotising allure to it, edited in a certain way to catch the eye and keep you engrossed. I figured it wouldn’t be hard for a group of traumatized teenagers (?) to fall under its spell.

It almost took me too, until the pain of the trauma in my eye pulled me away from that fake melancholy. It was a good pain which was enough to distract me. The guy in front of me was staring at the screen, his head cocked to the side, tears glistening in his eyes. Give me a fucking break. I kicked his seat and told him to wake up. Final days? I had a little sister I had to get back to and a mother I had promised to kill. 

I had a twin brother I wanted to mourn. 

The others in front of me were sitting quietly watching the screen which was repeating the same patronizing shit over and over again. It was dehumanizing the way the thing talked to us. Not even a human being. A robot. I watched a video clip of a group of kids walking through a dystopian glass building before the bus came to an abrupt halt. When I risked a look outside, I found myself staring at the exact same building. When I stepped off of the bus, we were led inside. The juvenile detention center resembled both a prison and a school in one. Which was impressive. On one hand, there were guards stationed everywhere carrying weapons, but in front of me was essentially a school. Yes, the ‘school’ had bars on the windows. But it wasn’t as horrific as I had imagined. 

Like... boarding school. 

What I was expecting were large metal cages where they forced us in like cattle-- to do who knows what to us. What I got was state-of-the-art technology built into each corridor where a TV screen was playing the same thing that had played on the bus-- that same soothing, reassuring monotone voice telling us everything was going to be okay, using buzz words like beautiful and magical.  And it did its job. Every kid I walked past looked to be in a manic trance wearing a wide smile that definitely did not say, “I’m going to die”. This place was a company and dare I think it, a store. Where we were the produce.

The boy who sat in front of me on the bus had introduced himself as Penn. I had known him for maybe an hour, and I already knew he was going to annoy me. He kept telling me to keep up with the line, hissing at me to walk faster. I don’t know what this guy’s problem was. Maybe he was suicidal. Maybe he liked being herded like cattle. Ignoring Penn attempting to pull me with him, I quickened my pace as the intercom fell into that same monotone drawl. 

"Please make your way to the Finishing Room, where you will begin your final days." The robot said loudly as I forced myself to follow Penn and the others, scanning for exits. There were two. One at the end of the hallway which looked like a fire door, and another in the form of an elevator which led to who knows where. "Newcomers, please go to Room 103 to be processed. Once again, please see this as a safe space where we will do our best to assist you before separation." Above me, there were at least three floors, and what looked like viewing screens on both. Like a human zoo. 

I could already glimpse people peering over glass panels, curious eyes peering down on our small line. The intercom was brutal, straight-up telling me I had walked into my own death, but hey, at least they had a PS5 in the rec room. Which it had repeated over five times. While I was expecting tunnel-like corridors and broken lights, there were large glass windows allowing in sunlight. In the late June heat, the air-con was perfect on my face, blowing my hair from my eyes and relieving me from the stuffy bus ride. It wasn't a prison, sure, but I wasn't letting my guard down.

I took my chance and sidestepped next to Penn.

“Out of curiosity, do you even know why we’re here?” I asked conversationally, “Or do you think this is some kind of vacation?”

He grimaced. “Oh, yeah. I ripped my mom’s lungs out and barbequed my dad.”

Penn caught up to the others. While the rest of my line shuffled toward the end of the hallway, I stopped at an automatic door, which immediately sensed my movement. I twisted around to see if anyone was watching, before ducking in quickly. I wasn't expecting to walk into a rec room, like the type back at school. Comfortably decorated with beanbags and expensive-looking couches filled with cushions, this place actually looked like the type of place you would send dying teenagers-- or dying artificial teenagers. Unlike the building itself, this place was more homely and less clinical. 

A large TV was mounted on the wall. Like a boarding school, this place had a dress code, girls and guys wearing light purple tees and shorts. The screen was taking up half of the wall with a countdown on it, bearing the words, "ONE HOUR, FORTY-THREE MINUTES, 17 SECONDS UNTIL SEPARATION." 

Which they ignored. Again, another death sentence staring them right in the face of whatever separation meant, and they didn't even glance at it. These kids looked happy, almost at peace. And it didn't make sense to me why they were all sitting there waiting to die with giant grins on their faces until my eyes found the corner of the room and a familiar face. Slouched on a beanbag, his legs propped up on a table piled with comic books was Finn Novak. 

He looked exactly as he had the last time I saw him, sporting a shorter haircut, and sandy-colored hair sticking in every direction. Still wearing raybans which clashed with the light purple of the so-called uniform he was wearing, the sheriff's son was idly turning the pages of a book. But it wasn't the boy who automatically stuck out to me. 

It was the glint of metal attached to his right ear. It was bigger than a piercing, but from that angle, I couldn’t see what it was. Finn Novak didn’t seem like the type to get spontaneous piercings. Still, though, the relief that filled me at seeing Finn alive was enough to send me stumbling forwards before I could stop myself. When I situated myself in front of him, he glanced up and the corners of his lips twitched into an unexpected smile. The last time I saw him, the boy was hysterically slamming his head into the bars of his cell. The manic contortion in his features was gone, replaced by a much more relaxed demeanour. Too relaxed. The boy looked high. He put his book down when I plonked into a beanbag in front of him. 

“Mara.” Nodding at me, he leaned his chin on his fist. “The eyepatch suits you." He inclined his head. 

“You’re here because you just turned 18 and received the bombshell on your birthday eve that you are nothing but a plastic doll modelled to be the perfect daughter to replace this town’s lack of children. So, you clawed out your eyes and killed your mom and dad." The boy leaned back on his beanbag, studying me through the shades. “Happy 18th birthday, by the way.” He saluted me with two fingers, a teasing smile pricking on his lips. “I’m glad you didn’t explode.”

I regretted telling him my fake mom’s idea of a hilarious yearly birthday greeting.

“Finn.” I managed to get out.

“Yeah?”

“How can you see me?”

The boy straightened up, bringing his knees to his chest. “Ooh, that?” He pointed to the device glued to his ear. “Well, this. But it’s not just helping me see,” Finn nodded around the room. “Look around. Notice anything?” When I followed his pointer finger, I did. 

This strange earpiece was apparently a universal accessory. I couldn’t help myself, kneeling in front of Finn, and prodding the thing. It was solid metal, emitting an eerie blue light. Finn tapped the thing with a smile. “Don’t be fooled, Mara. It can give me my sight, sure. But it’s also a leash.” His lips split into that maniacal grin from his father’s cell. “You’re wondering why I’m not a raging psycho right now? Well, that’s this thing.” He tapped it again. “Think of it like being high, or in permanent euphoria. When I got it fitted, I was told it’s supposed to inject happy drugs into our brains to send us to la-la land so we just accept our separation.” He turned, pointing at a girl trying to perfect a cartwheel. “Lyssa ripped a guard’s head off a few days ago. And Alex…” he pointed to a guy struggling with a Rubik’s cube. “Alex broke some guys' necks. So yeah, call it being…comfortably sedated." Finn surprised me with a laugh. “And guess what? It actually worked!” 

He let out a noise which I would expect from Noa, tipping his head back and grinning at the ceiling. I could sense his spinning head and foggy thoughts keeping him hostage, burning away logic and the desperation to escape. These kids were staring at a death clock counting down to their demise and they weren’t even allowed to be scared. Immediately, I knew he was going to be zero help. But if I was going to get out of there, I couldn’t leave him. Even if his brain was slowly rotting under the control of those announcements and the thing attached to his ear. “I’m being sloooooooowed dooooooooown,” Finn chuckled, abruptly pointing to a pile of board games. “Do you want to play Monopoly?” He lunged for the box before I could reply, his whole body vibrating with elation.

“Finn.” I grabbed his shoulders and lowered him back onto his beanbag. “I’m going to get you out of here.”

The sheriff’s son leaned back into the beanbag with a sigh. I glimpsed the device attached to his ear flashing a deeper blue. His smile faded. “Have fun with that, Nancy Drew. But I think I’m going to stay here and read, awaiting my inevitable demise.”

“My brother is dead.”

I had never understood Finn's liking for my brother. They had met once when Finn came over to awkwardly hand my mom mail which had ended up in his mailbox. I remember standing on top of the stairs watching the two of them. My twin, and Finn, engage in awkward conversation. I thought it was a crush on Finn's side, but then my brother, who was usually a snarky piece of shit, was suddenly incapable of words. It was almost like the two knew each other but also didn’t. I noticed Finn’s earpiece flash a deep red before flickering back to blue, and the boy’s head jerked slightly, his trance-like smile fading, humanity coming back to fruition. “What?” He shook his head, seemingly snapping out of it.

Finn leaned forward, his voice choking up. I could see the pain in his expression which was being torn away by the thing stuck to his ear. It flashed orange, and Finn was trembling. It turned red, and his teeth were gritted, before back to blue—and the boy’s body relaxed. “I…” It looked like he wanted to say something, his hands balling into fists. His head jerked, and the device turned a multitude of colors before he went rigid. “…sorry.”

“It’s okay.”

“How did it–" His head jolted again, this time violently backwards, but the boy didn't even notice. 

"...happen?"

“Did you like him?” I couldn’t help asking.

Finn shrugged. This time the device turned green, and a smile took over his lips. Whatever emotion the thing was combatting, it was strong. “I don’t… know,” he said. “I feel like I’ve met him before. But as far as I know, I’ve only been alive for a year.”

“I managed to get mine out,” I said, heaving out a breath. “He was right in front of me trying to do the same, and then he was just…gone.” I could see it in my head again, a vivid splash of red coating my eyes in warmth. “Mom murdered him, Finn.” I stood up, grasping hold of him and yanking him to his feet. “I need to get back to my sister. Mom told me I have a bio mother. That she’s looking for me. That she never stopped looking for me.” I whispered. “Don’t you want that? To find your real mom and dad and run away from here?” I gestured to the countdown. “Or stay around to find out what “separation” means?”

“Well yeah, obviously.” Finn winced, and his device flashed blue again. I figured it was mediating his emotions too, forcing him into a permanently relaxed state. But Finn was fighting it, momentarily managing to grasp hold of himself, his voice hardening before the thing turned his voice back into a drugged-up giggle. “I’d love to get the heck out of here, but this thing is more than a leash. It stops me from breaking the rules. I can’t follow you. I’ll get an electric shock.”

“You’ve already set it off?”

“Yeah. Swearing, breaking rules, and arguing/raising our voices.” Finn sighed. “I called Alex a fucking –ow—idiot.”

“Then we’ll find a way to pull it off,” 

“It can’t just be pulled off,” Finn shook his head. “Did you listen to that presentation? It’s—”

“If I find a good pair of pliers, yes. I will be able to pull it off.”

"Oh, yeah?" The sheriff's son's lip quirked. "What happens if I explode?" 

I rolled my good eye. "You can tell me ‘I told you so’ in the great beyond.”

Finn looked sceptical but followed me toward the door. I had déjà vu of breaking into his dad’s office. Just like before, I motioned for him to distract the guard before we made a run for it. He was right. When we passed over the threshold, me keeping a tight hold of his wrist, he hissed out, pulling at the device. When I twisted around to look at him, the boy sent me a sickly smile. "I'm fine," he said, "It's not as bad as I thought." I nodded, starting towards the first exit. The fire door. Voices, however, sent me stumbling back, pinning myself and Finn to the wall. Keeping myself and him still, I swung my head around.

"Are we all finished here?"

 A youngish woman came around the corner, followed by a man in a pinstriped suit and a smaller figure. It was a boy. Fifteen or maybe sixteen. 

His head was bowed, eyes on the ground as he dragged his feet. It was when he looked up suddenly, his gaze empty, a childlike smile on his face, when something sour crawled its way up my throat. I didn't recognize the short brown hair tucked under the beanie or the freckles on his cheeks. 

But from the facial structure alone, I could see seventeen years’ worth of smug smirks and teasing laughter. I was staring at a much younger version of him which I knew well. At fifteen years old, he had been the world's worst brother, never letting me play on the games console, throwing food at me at the table, and going through the angsty teen phase where he slammed his door on my face when I tried to enter his room. I was looking at my twin brother. 

The man in the pinstripe suit nodded, stepping into view, while Freddie continued walking, his steps slightly stumbled. When he looked up, there was no trace of my brother in his eyes-- it was like looking at a newborn baby. His eyes were full of confusion and childlike wonder, occasionally staring down at his hands. "We are, indeed, Mrs Cassidy."  

I could see the strain in the contortions of his face. "We managed to cut out the... unfortunate memories which caused this model to react in such an...interesting manner," he let out a fake laugh, and Freddie lifted his head, startled by the noise. When my brother wandered into a classroom door, the man yanked him back into a walk. "I can assure you he has been evaluated fully, and any and every trace of Freddie's second-generation memories have been removed, as well as those of the original." 

He chuckled. "Honestly, Mrs. Cassidy, I had no idea they even existed" Here at Child™️, we want you to leave here with happy. And I can say with confidence that Freddie is ready to be taken home. All we need is some last-minute paperwork, as well as a signed NDA, and you’re free to take your new child home.”

The man’s words stung. Freddie was nothing to him but produce he was marketing and selling to this woman.

“Didn’t you say your brother was dead?” Finn whispered over my shoulder.

“He is.”

“Well, he looks pretty fucking --ow-- alive to me.” Finn paused. “And…younger?”

I shushed him.

“He better be ready," the woman was frowning at my brother, a crease between her brows.  "I’ve been waiting months. How long does he last?" Her lip curled. "Do you know how long I have waited to have a baby as a barren woman in a cursed town?"

Pinstripe nodded. “Just like others, our FREDDIE model lasts a year from activation.”

“And there’s only one of him right now?” The woman enquired. 

“Yes! If various models were to be activated at the same time, that would pose a significant problem. To avoid complications with the Neurolink, we sell a model a year. Unfortunately, the seventeen-year-old model was scrapped due to a fault with programming. As you saw with the model’s, um, behavior, earlier, sometimes the neurolink can be disrupted and the model will experience what we call a Static Link. It is nothing to worry about, though we have decided to recall the seventeen-year-old Freddie’s to make sure it is just an isolated case.” 

Finn’s sharp intake of breath was enough for me to know that the Freddie who had blown up was causing other versions to behave erratically. I wondered if this had anything to do with the version my mom had. Pinstripe was clearly sugar-coating it. “But rest assured, 15 is a great age! And using the controls inside, you can implant any memories you would like. Freddie will remember a whole childhood with you, and of course, it will be like having your very own son.” 

He cleared his throat. “If you have ever lost a child, feel free to… replicate any given memory. Freddie will remember it as his own.” I felt sick. The way this man was talking was like he was trying to sell a phone. But this was my brother. When they arrived at the door, the man beamed. “Thank you again, Mrs. Cassidy.” He smiled proudly at my twin. 

“I hope you like your Third Generation parents!"

The boy finally lifted his head, peering through thick strands of dark hair. "Mmm." He said in a mumble, playing with his hands. Freddie cocked his head. "But... where are my sisters?" He twisted around, his eyes wide. "I was just with them, and now they're gone." My brother blinked rapidly, and my chest tightened. “Do you know where my sisters have gone?”

Something twisted in my gut. I had half a mind to scream at him, but I kept my mouth clamped shut. 

The man laughed nervously. “No, you do not have any sisters. Please say hello to your mother, Freddie."

“Oh, no,” Finn murmured. 

“What?”

“I dunno, I’m not sensing good vibes from your freshly grown brother.”

“Don’t say that!”

“It’s true!"

"Oh." My brother's voice sent me twisting back around. It was him. It was his voice, his face. Everything about him was real and in front of me. 

So, why did I feel so sick? Why did my chest ache at the thought of wrapping my arms around him and finally admitting that I was too slow to carve the thing out of his eye? 

My twin was standing there, and I could still feel pieces of him stuck between my fingernails. It was unnatural and wrong and agonizing-- a cruel trick. But it was also exactly what I hoped for. I was already taking slow steps forward in a daze, when Finn's fingers wrapped around the material of my jacket, yanking me back just in time for Freddie to smile at his new mother, reaching out and wrapping his fingers around her neck. 

When she cried out, his lips twitched into a smile I finally knew. "Hello, *Mom*. Thank you for the birthday card, it was so thoughtful," he said. 

Everything seemed to go in slow motion. With a jerk of his wrist, the woman was pressed up against the wall, and his fingers were pulverizing her throat. Her face was going red and then blue, then bruised purple, blood vessels exploding. There was no spite or anger or pain in his eyes. Freddie just looked confused. Cocking his head, he squeezed tighter, before plunging his fist into her stomach and pulling out her insides before letting her corpse drop to the ground, smeared scarlet stemming across clinical white. 

From Finn’s expression, I knew I was right. This monster was my real brother, the one I lost. 

Standing with the woman's slithering intestines in his hands, Freddie turned to Pinstripe. When my twin stepped towards him, he managed to pull out his talkie, before Freddie snatched it off of him and dropped it onto the ground, stamping on it. "I was with my sisters," he said, his tone hardening. "and then it all went dark. When I woke up, I was here.” My brother ran a hand through his hair, wincing. "There's something... important I need to tell them.” He grimaced. “But I…  I can’t remember what I was doing. I can’t remember my name or their names."

My twin stumbled toward the man, before blue fluid frothed in his mouth, splashing onto the tiles. The stuff dripped from his nose and ears, streaked pink and red. He didn’t seem fazed by it, frantic eyes scanning for an exit. I watched him take two steps back, before a guard came out of nowhere, grabbed him, and threw him to the ground. When his head hit marble, I was already lunging forward to help him. But Finn Novak’s fingers were already gripping the back of my shirt, and pulling me back when alarms started to screech, and the hallway was filled with red light. 

“That’s my brother!”

Finn kept a hold of me, dragging me back down the hallway. His earpiece was going crazy, flashing an angry red. I figured that meant he finally had some control back.  "I hate to tell you this, but no, Mara. That is obviously not your fucking –argh-- brother.”

Another voice took me by surprise, this one growing closer. 

It sounded like this person was being dragged.

“What do you mean he got away?!"

This time, Finn came to an abrupt stop, his earpiece flashing purple. I had never seen it flash that color before. His hand went to the device, suddenly, and I glimpsed desperation in his expression to claw it off. 

The familiar voice continued in what sounded like a struggle. “I want you to find him. Shut him down. Do you understand how much shit you will be in if this gets out? That I unwillingly donated my body to a cursed town? It’s bad enough that you actually had the guts to kidnap the son of... get the fuck off me! No. I want to speak to my father right now. You can't do this. You can't keep me here. I have rights! I want that thing put down—" When the yell morphed into a muffled cry, the sheriff’s son turned to me, his eyes wide. 

His earpiece was flashing like crazy, an all too familiar beeping sound filling my ears, and a red light flashed in my face, reflecting that same haunting countdown.

“Is that… me?”
