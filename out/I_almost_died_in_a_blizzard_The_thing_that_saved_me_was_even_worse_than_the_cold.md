The only thing worse than driving in a blizzard is breaking down in a blizzard. Winter hits Northern Maine hard, and this was my first experience of it. I'm from Florida originally, the state that only ever gets sun, rarely snow, and gets it year-round. I started dating a Maine woman during Covid, got married maybe a little too spontaneously and recently moved with her back to her home state. We're still looking for our own place to settle down, but until then we're living with my mother-in-law. Things have been going less than smoothly, and I find myself making excuse after excuse to leave the house. After tonight's screaming match, I didn't need an excuse. I just left. 

I'd been driving with my thoughts for over an hour when my car began to shake. It jerked another ten yards, giving me enough time to pull it into the side, before it conked out. For a while, I just sat there. Clutching the steering wheel and sighing repeatedly as a trail of black fumes dissipated behind me. I cursed the thousand dollar second-hand piece of crap I've been driving since I moved here and thought of what to do next. My breath formed miniature clouds as I stared at the snow piling up outside. I decided that the safest thing to do was to call 911. After fumbling around my pockets, and every crevice in my car, I realised I didn't have my phone. I left it such a spontaneous, rageful daze earlier that I'd forgotten it. I sat and visualised it charging by my bed. 

The engine was dead. No matter how much I prayed, no amount of key turning would revive it. I grabbed my wife's coat from the backseat and threw it on me. Even with an extra layer I could feel the chill, especially on my hands. I shoved them down my waistband for warmth and watched the snow pile up on the hood. Shivering, I began to seriously think of what I should do next. Looking at the ice covered backroad I knew that no passerby would find me. There was, however, a gas station around a mile and half walk back the way I came. I knew it was dangerous, I knew it was stupid, but that was my best bet. It felt like forward motion as well, rather than the sense of submission that came with just saying in my car. 

While looking for my phone, I found a half empty bottle of water, a crushed chocolate bar and a packet of apple-flavoured chewing gum around my car. Not exactly mountaineering provisions, but I drank and ate what I could before going outside. I grabbed the car door handle, swung it open, stepped out of the frying pan and into the fire. A baltic breeze hit me as soon as I did, and I thought I'd freeze where I stood. I wrapped my arms around myself in a bear hug, and buried my hands between my armpits. Staggering through a world of light grey, I drove myself with the thought of warmth. I kept to the side of the road, where the boreal trees met the asphalt. 

Trudging through the snow, all I could think of was turning back. I knew I'd fare no better in the car, but the air out here was bitter. As a headache set in, I was reminded of a poem we studied in highschool. The Cremation of Sam McGee. It told the story of two men with gold fever traveling to Yukon, looking to make a fortune. One of the men is so deathly afraid of the cold that he makes the other vow to cremate him if he dies. Reading this when I was sixteen, I didn't understand why someone could be so terrified of a bit of bad weather. Now I do. 

I began to feel it in my brain. Feeling naked, I took slow steps forward. My clothes couldn't keep the chill out anymore. Stumbling, I thought of my wife. She was the reason I was out here. If I died, she was to blame. I cursed her, but found little warmth in my anger. The tears that welled up in my eyes were little snowflakes, scratching at my cornea. I blinked them out, but more formed in their place. My jaw was in pain from the constant shattering of my teeth. I realised I could feel my hands, or my feet. When I looked down to see if I still had them, I almost fell over. Not from a lack of balance, but from fatigue. I yawned, the cold air cutting the roof of my mouth. My body told me that I could sleep for a week. I agreed. 

A few more steps forward and an inviting looking oak tree loomed into view. Its branches formed a nice, secluded spot by its powerful trunk. I made my way to it and sat at its base. Resting against the wood, I began to feel warm again. It worked. The snow kept piling up around me, but I couldn't feel it. I pulled my two hoods back and felt only numbness against my face. It was beautiful. Looking at my hands, I saw that they were now a light yellow-white, the color of pus. I used them to brush the snow off my shoulders. Squirming, I found a more comfortable position against the tree. Things were alright, I thought. I'd have a quick nap, then carry on my walk to the gas station once I had the energy. I yanked again. It hurt my throat. The only thing I could think of now was my dog. I wished I could see him again. I closed my eyes. 

I opened them again an unknowable amount of time later. Dazed, I looked around and saw someone standing over me. Their hands were on my collar, lifting me from where I lay, completely buried in snow other than my face and knees. The figure pulled me to the side, and rested me on a blanket. It pulled another from the bag it had thrown from his shoulders to the ground and wrapped me in it. The man, who was covered in so many thermal layers it made him look a hundred pounds heavier, sat me up and crouched down next to me. He rubbed his hands up and down my legs and arms and when we were done, unclipped a canteen from his waist. He made me take a sip of the contents, which I choked on as they burned their way down my throat. Brandy. 
I attempted to ask him who he was and what I was doing here, but I realised I couldn't speak. My tongue hung dead in my mouth. 

“Ok, we need to move. Are you up for it, champ?” The man asked. 

He didn't wait for me to respond. His arms interlocked with mine and he lifted me to my feet. He half led, half dragged me to his car, which was parked, engine running, just a few yards further down the road. He bundled me inside, and climbed into the driver's seat once he was sure I was safe. For a while, we sat in silence, being blasted by hot air from the ac. After some time had passed, he spoke. 

“My name is Andrew, by the way” 

He took my hand, which had its natural color back, in his own and shook it vigorously. He looked to be in his late 50s, if I had to guess, and had a kind, slender face. His brown mustache was sprinkled with patches of white, as were the tufts of his long hair which escaped from the corners of his woollen hat. 

“My name is Isaac” I whispered in quiet response. 

From there, we started talking. I told him where I lived and as his old car roared into motion, he offered to drop me off at my front door. 

“Thank you,” I said, my voice still hoarse, “thank you so much, man.”

“No worries!” He replied, slapping my shoulder. “I'm sure you would've done the same thing for me!”

“Of course I would.” I answered, turning to look out the window. 

“I'm just glad you'll get to see your dog again” He said from behind me. 

I turned to look at him, but his eyes were fixed on the snow covered road. Clutching the steering wheel and hunched slightly forward, Andrew saw me looking at him strangely from the corner of his eye. He smiled and spewed out some small talk. 

“Driving in these conditions sure is a pain!” He said with a chuckle. 

“Don't I know it?” I replied and rested my head against the car door. 

Just then we passed the gas station. There wasn't a light on anywhere, and the thick steel shutters had been pulled down. I wondered what I would've done next even if I had reached it. 

“Mind if I turn the overhead light off?” Andrew asked me, gesturing towards the small filament embedded in the roof between us, “It's just that kills the battery in this old thing!” 

“Oh sure. It's your car man, you don't need to ask me” I replied. 

He looked at me with a smile that rounded his cheeks. He switched the light off and suddenly we were thrust into darkness, with only a brief shine coming from the dim headlamps. I turned to Andrew, and saw that his face was now mostly obscured in shadow. The only thing I could make out was his smile. I noticed that I couldn't see his breath, even in the frigid car. He still kept an iron grip on the wheel, like it was trying to escape him. For some reason, I felt almost unnerved by my saviour. I glanced back out the window, and watched the snow beat down outside.

“I wish this blizzard would end soon” I expressed gruffly. 

Andrew didn't reply, but I assumed he agreed. Barely a minute later, as we began passing the occasional house, the shower of snowflakes started to pitter out. I watched as they became more elusive and soon, they had stopped all together. The blizzard had ended by the time we reached town. 

“Finally” I whispered more to myself than anything. 

“I knew it would” Andrew said, referencing the sudden halt of the snow storm. There was another minute of silence before he spoke again. 

“Why were you out in it anyway?” 

I looked at Andrew and frowned. 

“I've been fighting with my wife. I just really needed to leave the house, before I said anything I shouldn't.” I replied. 

“Oh, I get you, I get you,” Said Andrew as he pursed his lips, “No I do, I do, I really do. I was almost in trouble with my missus, but the marriage ended recently.”

“I'm sorry to hear that man.” I replied, hoping his situation wasn't a projection of my future.

“Oh it's fine, it's all good,” he told me as he put a hand on my shoulder and shook it, “I'm glad to be free of her, I really am.” 

I didn't know how to respond, so I just nodded and said “I see”. 

I noticed Andrew glance at me from the corner of his eyes before they fluttered back to the road. 

“I'm sure your wife is no saint if she drove you to this!” He said, with a touch of biting malice in his tone. 

My first thought was to defend her, but instead some part of my mind told itself that Andrew had a point. She waved at me, taunted me as I drove off. She knew it was dangerous to go out, but she didn't stop me. She'd seen the news reports. She knew it was the blizzard to hit that year but she acted like she didn't care, and maybe she didn't. Maybe she would've been fine if I froze to death in that snow drift. Maybe she would've celebrated. 

“Yeah, she is a bitch!” I said and immediately wished I hadn't. I turned away from Andrew, feeling embarrassed that I'd said something so vile about the person I loved more than anyone else in the world. 

“What about your mother-in-law?” Asked Andrew. 

“What?” I croaked out, looking at him in something close to shock.

“You're mother-in-law!” Andrew reiterated. “So maybe your wife was just caught up in the moment, and maybe she wasn't thinking straight. You can't say the same about your fucking mother-in-law can you? That hag stood by and egged your wife on, made you storm out and almost took your life. Surely you can blame her!

“Yeah,” I agreed and then, with more anger in my voice, “You know what, man? You're right. I think I can put the blame on them this time. I almost died for Christ's sake!”

“You did,” Andrew spat, “and it was entirely their fault. Glad I don't have to deal with this shit anymore!”

I shook my head and leaned forward against the dash as we finally pulled down my street.

“I wish I was rid of them both.” I admitted. 

Andrew's sudden, piercing laugh made me jump. I sat upright against my seat and watched as his chuckle turned to a wild howl. He began rocking back and forth in his seat as he continued to cackle maniacally. It started to sound almost painful, like it scratched his throat coming out. 

“What the fuck, man!?” I said, nervously looking out for my house. 

His laughter didn't break. He slowly took his gaze from the road and looked at me. His eyes were bizarrely wide and his smile was sickening. Any warmth that came from the man who saved my life had been drained away. He was still laughing when his car slowly stopped outside of my house. Where I lived was apparently one more thing he knew about that he really shouldn't have. I smiled at him frantically and half fell out of my seat, out of the door and onto the pavement. 

“Thanks for everything!” I stuttered out and slammed the door shut behind me. 

My hands dove into my coat pockets as I started walking up to my front door. 

“You said it champ, not me!” Andrew shouted from behind me. 

I didn't want to look back. I got to my front door and grabbed the handle. Just before I opened it, I turned around. Andrew’s car was gone. With an unsteady hand I unlocked the door and barged inside. I was hit with the smell of wet brass. My dog, Howie, rushed up to me from the living room. He left a trail of bloody paw prints behind him. I crouched down and wrapped Howie in my arms, glad to see him again. I took a deep breath in and made my way into the living room. My wife was lying on a red carpet of her own blood. My mother-in-law has still sat upright on the sofa, her oxygen tank by her side and a knife protruding from her chest. My mind broke in that moment and I fell to my knees. I pulled at my hair and cried into the hardwood floor. All the while my dog nuzzled its snout into my neck. 

No signs of a break in. The knife was taken from our own kitchen. Neighbours testified that they could hear loud, volatile arguing coming from my house in the hours leading up to the murder. My car was found in the garage. I was sentenced to death. 

I've spent the past year wishing that it could all be undone, that everything could go back to how it was. That I'd have my love and my freedom again. I wished that this was all just a bad dream but, apparently, Andrew can't hear my wishes anymore.
