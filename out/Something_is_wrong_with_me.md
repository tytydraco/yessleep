Tick. tock.

The clock on my bedside table ticked endlessly, over and over again. I lay there, tangled in unwashed bedding, the stale air heavy with the scent of neglect. My head rested against a bare, sweat-stained pillow, the only thing keeping me upright these days.

For too long, I’ve felt this way. A feeling I can’t quite describe, though it sits at the edge of my thoughts like a shadow I can’t escape. My mind is a fog, questions swimming aimlessly without purpose or resolution.

Tick. tock.

The dull glow of the clock’s face was the only light in my life, its rhythmic ticking like a drumbeat in my skull. Each second dragged me closer to some invisible edge until it felt as though my head might split in two. My chest tightened as I sat up, hands trembling with a vague, restless frustration I couldn’t name.

Tick. Tock. Tick. Tock. Tick. Tock.

My hand shot out, slamming into the clock and sending it crashing to the floor. A sharp crack of glass, then silence. Brief, but not long enough.

Tick. Tock.

It continued, relentless and mocking.
I glanced down at my hand, blood welling from a thin cut along my palm. Crimson droplets ran down my fingers, staining the sheets with dark, angry streaks. I stared at the wound, detached, as if it belonged to someone else.

Bang. Bang. Bang.

Someone was at the door. I heard my name called out, the voice muffled but insistent. I didn’t move. It didn’t matter who it was or what they wanted. Nothing mattered anymore.

The banging came again, louder this time, followed by another call of my name. I shoved the pillow over my head, blocking out the sound. I didn’t care if they barged in, yelling or shaking me like a ragdoll. Let them. I wouldn’t respond.

For too long, I’ve felt this hollow, this lost. Life has become nothing but a cycle of work, eat, sleep. A monotonous grind that once felt manageable but now feels unbearable. Every step, every breath, a weight I no longer want to carry.

Bang. Bang. Bang.

The noise was growing distant, or maybe I was sinking deeper. The pillow muffled the world, leaving me alone with the ticking of the clock, the sting of my bleeding hand, and the endless void stretching out before me.

After today, I wouldn’t have to worry anymore. After today, I wouldn’t have to feel.

Today was the day I would end it. This miserable life I was leading, today was the end and I couldn’t have cared less. To me, life was nothing more than disappointment. Dreams half-realized, lingering beside half-finished realities. Today would be the day. The day I ended it.

Bang. Bang. Bang.

The pounding on my door was weaker this time, as if the person behind it was realizing the futility of their efforts. Slowly but surely, they understood. I would not come. I would not open the door to greet them. Instead, I pretended they didn’t exist, letting my life unspool like a thread about to snap.

Then, a noise from inside the house. Different from the banging. Not rhythmic, but steady. Footsteps, moving down the hall toward my bedroom.
I sat up, leaving a bloody handprint smeared across the pillow.

A new sound. Light, deliberate. A gentle tapping against my bedroom door, a stark contrast to the pounding from before.

Tap. Tap. Tap.

The sound pressed against my skull, soft yet insistent. The voice followed, barely more than a breath.

"Please."

It was wrong. Twisted. A sound stretched too thin, like a whisper dragged through broken glass. My stomach knotted, but I didn't move. Couldn’t.

The door creaked open.

I didn’t look. I didn’t want to see.

Something climbed onto the bed, the mattress sinking under a weight too light to be real. A breath ghosted against my ear, warm and trembling.

"Stay."

A hand, small and cold, slid over my bleeding palm. Fingers traced the cut, dipping into the blood, smearing it. My body locked up, my breath caught in my throat.

"Don’t leave me."

The voice cracked on the last word, and something inside me cracked with it.

A sob welled in my chest, but I swallowed it down. My limbs felt heavy, my mind splintering under the weight of exhaustion.
Maybe I had never been alone in this house. Maybe the thing whispering in my ear had been waiting, patient and hungry, for the moment I gave up.

Maybe I was always meant to stay.

I closed my eyes.

And I let it hold me.
