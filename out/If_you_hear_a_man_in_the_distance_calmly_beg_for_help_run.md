Today was my last day after a two week long work load. Whenever the holidays roll by, Mohan needs me at the pub much more, after all it gets so busy around that time I could barely move from the bar to table 1.

Anyways it was a regular day of mine, I woke up feeling like shit around 1:30 after a long night of texting ally and scrolling TikTok, I got out of bed after 20 more minutes of marinating in my unmade bed before making my way downstairs. My family was in the living room, which I passed by without taking a second to look in, and I stepped into the kitchen to, as usual, check for food, find nothing of interest and then retreat back to my room. For the next few hours I’d fill time, drink an energy drink Jay gave me yesterday at the end of my shift and considered going down to the shop, but 4:40 rolled around too soon and I pulled together my work clothes and put on my hat before heading downstairs and out the door.

It was the 3rd of January, right in that awkward part of the new year where it gets colder just as everyone is getting ready for it to get hotter, and on my way I was one misstep away from slipping on the plentiful black ice on the pavement and breaking my neck. The pub was only 5 minutes away from my house, one of the few perks of living in a small village.

Once I arrived i offered a few quick nods to whoever i accidentally glanced at on my way to the closet in the back, where I left my coat and hat and went back into the pub area: There I was instantly met by James, one of the old boys who always sat at table one, the one closest to the bar and furthest from the television, aka a spot devoid of the younger customers. He met me with a senile “smile” that guys his age can muster, more of an odd raise of the upper lip than an actual smile

“So is it John Lennon you’re going for or just a coincidence?”

He asked as he raised the ale to his lips with an audible sip. It had been a running conversation between the old boys on my coat and hat, similar to what John wore in the early days. This led us on a considerably long conversation that due to the current length of this post already, I doubt you’ll care to hear.

It ended when his buddy, a visibly older, smaller man, however one that had something that could be better recognised as a smile, but in

“I’ve got a few vinyls I need throwing out, could always give them to you?” He said, and I saw a glint in his eye suggesting this meant something to him. I smiled as I nodded.

The rest of the night was pretty simple, some young guys my age came in, gave me a funny look every time I had to ID them (police cameras force us to ID any customer who looks under 25) and a few miscellaneous conversations with my coworkers due to the incredibly boring lack of customers. As always these conversations were awkward, the upside to being the only person who knows English as a first language at your job is you quickly become the favourite of customers, the downside is the language barrier between coworkers lol.

It was around 7:40, that odd twilight zone at my work, when it’s not really busy, and that means I might get an hour off work, but if it picks up before 8:30 (give or take) I’ll be staying till 10, I was talking to Dhaani, who was ever curious about my relationship with Ally. Anyways luckily around 8:40, she gave the thumbs up to go at 9, and 20 minutes later I picked up my dinner from the kitchen and walked out towards home. Not 1 minute away from home, it happened.

To my right is the barren community centre, to my front is the tile path to my neighbourhood and to my left, the massive grass field before the woods, none of it past 30 metres visible due to it being completely dark out. I was just at the end of the path when I hear way off in the distance of the forest:

“Help”

The sound stopped me in my tracks, and I waited.

Exactly 10 seconds later

“Help”

This sent a shiver down my entire body, the sound was barely coherent, and part of me considered it was an injured animal

Then, exactly 10 seconds after the last,

“Help”

After the third hearing I could map out the sound, it was distant, and it was, without a better way of saying it, calm.

Sure it was loud, the person (whoever they were) was certainly using their outside voice, but there was no urgency to it, and what was even chilling was the perfect gap between each beg.

By the fourth I was back on my way home. There was no way in hell I was going to check it out, at best I’d tell my dad and he’d tell me I’m “overreacting”. Either way I’m just some scrawny college kid who’s read way too many stupid creepy pastas to go into the woods alone at night.

When I got home my parents were on the sofa, mum fast asleep and my dad staring at the screen. I told him about the noise and got the exact answer I expected, something along the lines of “it’s probably just some crackhead or a group of drunk kids being idiots”

I didn’t care to press so I went upstairs.

Right now I’m typing this at my desk at home, still pretty shaken but I feel secure now haven distracted myself with a long sappy conversation with ally (a daily occurrence)

I’ll update you all if anything happens tomorrow or there’s any news on what the sound was,

For now I’ll try get some sleep.
