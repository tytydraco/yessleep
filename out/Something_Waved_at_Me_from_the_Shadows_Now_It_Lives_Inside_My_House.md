The first time I saw the house, I barely noticed it. Just another dying terrace on a street where everything else had been polished, gutted, reborn. A relic between gentrified ghosts.

But the door was always open.

Not the front door—the upstairs terrace. A narrow doorway leading to a rusted railing, the glass panel cracked in one corner. Sheer curtains hung inside, caught in the night air, shifting like something breathing.

And the room beyond was always black.

No light. No signs of life. Just that empty blackness, patient and waiting.

I walked past it every night with Baxter. Always a different route from the morning walk, a way to break the routine. The streets were quiet at night. Just me, the dog, the distant hum of the city. But no matter what path I took, I always ended up passing that house.

And one night, Baxter refused to walk past.

⸻

I barely had time to register his resistance before he froze. His body turned to stone—tail tucked so tight it nearly vanished, ears pressed flat. The leash jerked in my hand as he trembled.

“Bax?” My voice sounded too loud, too intrusive in the expectant silence.

A low, unsteady whimper. Pain. Fear. Something primal.

I followed his gaze.

The upstairs door was open.

The curtains moved, slow and deliberate. The room was black.

Same as always.

But the air felt different.

The street, usually filled with distant noise—cars, sirens, a muffled voice through an open window—was silent. A deep, pressing silence, like sound had been sucked from the world.

A vacuum.

The air was thick, heavy on my skin.

Then—

Baxter let out a high-pitched, strangled yelp.

And bolted.

The leash burned through my fingers as he tore forward, claws scraping pavement, blind with terror. I barely managed to keep hold, stumbling after him. My pulse hammered as I made the mistake of looking back.

The door was still open.

The curtains still moved.

But the darkness inside had changed.

Not empty. Not anymore.

Something was watching.

And now it knew me.

⸻

I should have changed routes.

I should have let it go.

But curiosity is a sickness, and I let it rot my common sense.

The next night, I forced myself to walk past the house again.

Baxter knew before I did. He whined before we even turned the corner. His breath came fast and shallow. When we stepped onto the street, he stopped dead, claws digging into pavement.

That should have been enough.

But I looked up anyway.

The door was open.

The curtains moved.

The room was black.

And something was waiting.

The wind stopped.

Not slowed. Stopped.

The curtains, mid-billow, froze in place—like invisible fingers had caught them. The air turned still, pressed, suffocating.

Then—

A shape emerged from the blackness.

Not stepping forward. Not moving like a person.

Seeping.

A shadow with no source.

My throat locked. My fingers tingled with the numb, crawling sensation of something unnatural.

It stood just inside the doorway, where the darkness was thickest. Tall. Wrong. Too long in the limbs.

It didn’t have eyes.

But I felt it looking at me.

The weight of its attention was unbearable, like something ancient and starved.

And then, it raised its hand.

And it waved.

Not a greeting. Not a farewell.

A test.

A mimicry of human movement, but wrong.

The arm lifted too slow, then too fast. The elbow bent at an unnatural angle, the fingers too fluid in the motion.

It was learning.

Practicing.

Mocking me.

My legs wouldn’t move.

Baxter whimpered, barely breathing.

I had to go.

But my body was locked, my muscles coiled in something worse than fear—recognition.

This thing knew me now.

Baxter let out a strangled, broken sound.

The spell snapped.

I stumbled backward, almost falling, leash slipping from my grasp. The wave continued, patient, like it was willing me to respond.

And then—

The world roared back to life.

The wind slammed into me, rushing past my ears. A car honked somewhere far away. A streetlight flickered.

The curtains moved again.

The shadow was gone.

The door was still open.

The blackness inside was deeper than ever.

⸻

I ran.

Didn’t think. Didn’t stop.

Baxter was shaking when we got home. He wouldn’t go inside. He just stood at the threshold, staring past me, ears back, teeth bared.

It took everything to drag him inside. To shut the door. To tell myself I was safe.

I stood in my kitchen, breath coming in ragged bursts, heart hammering. I wiped my clammy hands on my jeans, forcing the nausea down.

Then—

Something moved behind me.

I turned.

The curtains by my living room window were billowing.

But the window was shut.

I felt the blood drain from my face.

A deep, bottomless kind of dread settled in my stomach. The kind that tells you you’re not alone anymore.

I didn’t want to look.

I didn’t want to see.

But something shifted behind the fabric.

A dark outline, just barely visible through the thin curtain.

Not outside. Inside.

Standing behind the glass.

And then, slowly—so slowly—

A shadow raised its hand.

And it waved.

⸻

I don’t take that route anymore.

I don’t take any night walks.

Baxter still refuses to go near the front door after dark.

Some nights, I wake up gasping for breath, drenched in sweat, the feeling of that wave burned into my skull.

But worst of all—

The curtains still move sometimes.

Even when the windows are shut.

Even when the air is dead still.

And I tell myself I won’t look.

I won’t check.

But some nights, out of the corner of my eye, I catch a glimpse of something shifting behind the fabric.

Something patient.

Something waiting.

And if I listen closely, in the dead silence of my apartment, I swear I can hear the sound of skin brushing against fabric.

The slow, gentle rhythm of a hand moving back and forth.

Still waving.
