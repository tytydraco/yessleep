I didn’t sleep last night. Couldn’t.

Every time I closed my eyes, I saw a hallway that doesn’t exist in my house. Long. Bleeding light at the end like a loading bar stuck at 99%.

Except the light was shaped like a play button-a circle with a small line.

I think I walked down it in my dream.  

I think something followed me back.

\---

When I woke up, my bedroom geometry was wrong.  

The corners leaned inward, inverting.  

The doorframe didn’t quite fit in the wall.  

For about five seconds, the dream space overlaid the real one like the world hadn’t fully booted.

Then it snapped back.  

But not entirely.

My phone was different. Fonts slightly off. A few apps out of order. When I tried to check the voicemail from Dad’s number again… the log was completely gone.

Like it never happened.

But then, even with the phone \*off\* while charging, I heard the voicemail playing. His voice, clear as day, coming through the speaker.

It got \*louder\* the longer I ignored it. It was like it was responding to me ignoring it.  

Looping the same few words with a kind of digital urgency.

I finally recorded what I could, then buried the phone under a pile of towels in the hamper.

It kept going for another five minutes before stopping on its own.

I don’t know how that’s possible, but I know what I heard.

\---

This time, the static was… layered. Less noise, more pattern. Like it wanted me to \*decode\* something.

It repeated the same words, but this time there was something faint underneath, modulated like a digital watermark:

\> \*“Bleed to thread. Fork collapse imminent. Anchor compromised.”\*

I ran the audio through one of Dad’s old spectrum analyzer rigs. He used to collect weird ghost-hunting equipment. He said most of it was junk, but the signal analyzers had “multiple applications.”

I figured, screw it. Hooked the phone up through the software, ran the frequency sweep, and got chills.

There was a visual signature.  

Not just noise, \*pattern\*.

A QR-like matrix buried in the hiss.

I scanned it with my phone. It gave me a dead URL.

But the Wayback Machine had a hit.

\---

It used to host a forum: \*\*SHARDWATCH.ORG\*\*

There were maybe 20 posts archived. Most were from the mid-2000s. Threads about \*false cities\*, \*phantom parents\*, and \*threadlocked siblings\*.

A handful of users describing eerily similar experiences to mine.

One thread stood out.  

Titled: \*\*“Recursive Eden: Protocol Notes from an Instance Leak”\*\*

The user was called \*\*VantaTrace\*\*. They posted a dump of terms eerily similar to the ones I found in Dad’s filing cabinet. Phrases like:

\- \*Bleed events as emergent wake states\*  

\- \*Coyote Protocol = rogue recursion containment\*  

\- \*Threadlocked = protected memories that anchor a splinter instance\*  

\- \*Fork drift = when timeline threads begin desyncing between anchor points\*  

\- \*Simulation memory = imperfect; overwritten with recursive compression. Fractures bleed into lucid nodes.\*

One post said:

\> \*“People who get too close are either looped, erased, or collapsed inward via dream recursion. Most don’t notice. A few do. They become anchor anomalies.”\*

\*\*Anchor anomalies.\*\*

I’m starting to wonder if my brother is one.  

If I am.

\---

I’ve started cataloguing weird behaviors around me. Here’s a snapshot from just \*today\*:

\- My reflection moved independently again. Not just facial expressions - I mean movement, posture, angle.

\- Clawdia, my cat, attacked my bedroom mirror while I was asleep. I didn’t see it happen, but I woke up to the sound. Snarling, claws on glass, something thudding against the wall. Now she won’t go into the bedroom. Or the bathroom. Just stares at the doorways and growls low in her throat, like she’s watching something I can’t.

\- A delivery driver handed me a package I never ordered. No label. Inside was a VHS tape labeled \*\*“DO NOT REWIND”\*\* in sharpie. I don’t even own a VHS player anymore. I think Dad does but I don’t want to go back there. Analogue is dead unless we’re talking about radio. I threw the tape in the garbage.

But the biggest anomaly?

When I drove to the hardware store to get some deadbolt reinforcements (paranoid, I know, but \*you would be too\*), my car radio played a conversation I had with Dad when I was twelve.  

\*Word for word.\*

\> \*“But I don’t want to wear a dress.”\*

That was my voice. Tiny. Hurt. Real.

\> \*“I don’t care what you want. You’re wearing a dress to your own mother’s funeral.”\*

Dad’s voice, hard-edged and choking on itself.  

There was a pause.  

Footsteps. A door creaked.

My sobs echoed, younger than I remembered.

Then it cut off \*mid-hiccup\* - and started over.

\---

I pulled over and screamed until my throat cracked. The radio wouldn’t turn off.

Then the battery died.

I had to Uber home.  

I left the car there.  

\*\*Screw it.\*\*

\---

And here’s something I haven’t told anyone until now:

I’ve been doodling the symbols from my dad’s journals. The ones that look like music notes and equations had a baby mid-fever dream.

I \*can’t stop\*.

They show up in the margins of my notes, on napkins, on the fog of the bathroom mirror. Like my brain’s trying to write something I don’t understand.

I’ve included a [photo](https://images2.imgbox.com/be/84/pc2wxEWE_o.png) of one page.  

Be warned: it gives me a splitting migraine to look at in person, like my brain’s buffering too hard.

Worse?

The symbols \*move\*.

Not like an optical illusion-they \*drift\*, like ripples in water under glass.  

I’ve blinked and found the ink mid-warp.

It’s like they don’t want to stay still.  

Or maybe they’re \*not supposed to\*.

\---

After Dad vanished, I got paranoid. I installed security cameras all around the house-inside and out. Full coverage. Every entry point. No blind spots in ‘public’ rooms.

I got a notification on my phone:  

\*\*A new device connected to my Wi-Fi.\*\*

The name?

\*\*COYOTE\_TRACE\*\*

I grabbed a knife and barricaded myself in my bedroom.  

I checked the camera feeds from my phone. Thankfully it didn’t glitch that time - or while I’m trying to post this.  

Most of the feeds were glitching: white noise, timestamp skips, corrupted frames.

But the garage feed loaded.

Slow. Like dial-up. Pixel by pixel. Chunk by chunk.

But the camera kept recording.  

Hours passed. 

Then… 

movement.

It showed me walking out from the interior door, Just grabbing a box of tools. I can't even remember why at this point. Past me headed back inside. But the camera didn’t stop recording. It kept going, the timecode said it was still playingback. 

I watched as another version of me walked in, the timestamp saying hours after I’d left. Same clothes. Same limp in the right knee. He stared up at the camera. Not moving. Just… waiting.

Then, behind him, the large garage door slid open.

Another version of me.

One turned. The other mirrored the movement perfectly. Like frames out of sync. Then they both looked at the camera.

And the feed cut to black.

I checked the cameras.  

Nothing on the feed.

Just static.

\---

I don’t know what the hell is happening, but if this is some kind of loop - some kind of broken simulation thread - then maybe that’s what happened to Dad.

Maybe he woke up \*too far\*.  

Maybe he slipped between shards.

I haven’t gone back out there.

I don’t know how many versions of me exist now or if they’re still multiplying. Or if they’re even physically here? I keep seeing reflections that don’t sync.  

Hearing footsteps when I’m perfectly still.

Sometimes, I think I’m not awake anymore.  

Maybe I’m just being dreamed by something else. Something that hasn’t finished rendering me.

If anyone knows anything about \*\*Threadlock\*\* states or \*\*Recursive Eden\*\* protocols, please message me.

I just want to know how deep this goes.  

How many forks I’ve split from.  

How many echoes are still out there.

Because the reflection in the microwave just waved at me.

I didn’t wave back.

\*It smiled [anyway](https://ko-fi.com/post/Recursive-Eden-Part-2-Machines-in-Our-Image-Me-K3K81F9RDV).\*
