The dim light from my computer screen cast shadows across the small office, painting our worn-down walls in a bluish glow. I’d been glued to the computer for hours, clicking and typing, my mind barely able to keep up with the never-ending tasks. Bills and deadlines stacked up like barricades, keeping us one step away from losing everything. It was almost eleven, and I’d be up at 5:30 to start again. But in a town like ours, every hour of work counted, every dollar could mean dinner on the table or gas to get us through the week.

The quiet patter of footsteps in the hall broke my concentration. I turned to see my son, Liam, standing in the doorway. His small, tear-streaked face caught the dim light, his eyes red and swollen from crying. My heart twisted at the sight, and I held my arms open. He shuffled over, burying himself in my lap, his little arms wrapped tight around me.

“Hey, sweetheart,” I murmured, rubbing his back gently. “What’s wrong?”

He looked up at me, his brow furrowed, lip trembling. “Does Daddy still love us?”

My breath caught. I knew the question would come eventually, but hearing it from his lips… it hit differently. I felt the heaviness of it settle in my chest, a weight of memories from when things were good. I remembered a time when his father’s laughter filled the house, a time before the bills and debt piled up, before the desperation set in. A time when he’d do anything to keep our family safe, no matter the cost.

“Oh, honey,” I whispered, my voice barely steady, “of course he loves us. But he can’t live with us right now.” I stroked his hair, feeling the pain of the truth I couldn’t fully explain. How could I tell him his father was behind bars because of what he’d done to keep us from starving?

Liam’s grip tightened, and he whispered, “Mom… did we… did we eat any of the people Daddy hurt?”

The words hit like a punch to the gut. I felt the color drain from my face, my heart pounding in my chest. His small voice was thick with confusion and fear, and for a moment, I could hardly breathe. My gaze shifted, almost involuntarily, to the crumpled newspaper lying on the desk, its bold, horrific headline glaring back at me: *Local Butcher Arrested in Gruesome Murders; Town in Horror Over Cannibalistic Revelations.*

A shudder ran through me as I thought of the police raid on his shop just weeks before. They’d gone in on a tip, searching for any trace of foul play. Nobody suspected at first—he was well-liked, friendly even. People trusted him. But one officer, sharp-eyed and relentless, had found something hidden in the back freezer. Beneath sheets of butcher’s paper, tucked away like cuts of lamb or beef, they found pieces of people. Evidence of something more horrifying than any of us could have imagined.

The truth spread through town like wildfire. First, whispers of his arrest circulated, shock quickly turning to revulsion as details of the murders emerged. Then came the most gut-wrenching part: the butchered remains, the way he’d packaged them, how he’d sold them under the guise of “special cuts.” People realized, one by one, they had unknowingly eaten those they once knew. Neighbors. Friends. Faces from the grocery store and PTA meetings.

I looked down at Liam, his innocent face filled with questions too dark for him to bear. A tear slipped down his cheek, and he wiped it away with a small, trembling hand. He was just seven. How could he understand the kind of desperation his father had felt, the kind that drove him to such lengths?

“No, baby,” I said softly, pulling him close, my hand resting on the back of his head as I stroked his hair. I forced myself to steady my voice, to keep it as gentle as I could, to hide the horror clawing at my insides. “Of course not, sweetheart.” I murmured, hoping he’d never have to know just how far we’d been pushed to survive.
