While on the lam for 2½ years, a Japanese man wanted for the murder of a British woman says he scissored off his lower lip, dug two moles out of his cheek with a box cutter and gave himself a nose job in an attempt to obscure his identity.

The case became one of Japan's highest-profile murders after Hawker's body was found in a dirt-filled bathtub on the balcony of Ichihashi's apartment.

When 22-year-old Lindsay Hawker was approached on the train by a young man who asked her to teach him English, she had no idea that hiding behind the innocent façade was an evil sadist.

Just four days after the pair agreed to meet for a lesson, the Brit's naked body was found sprawled in a bloody bathtub filled with soil and sand.

The young teacher, on a gap year in Tokyo, Japan, had been bound and gagged with plastic ties before being brutally raped in a frenzied attack.

Her skin was covered in bruises and she had been strangled before she died on March 24, 2007.

When she was found, her hair had been shaved off and her belongings were scattered across the room.

Copa quickly identified the killer as loner Tatsuya Ichihashi, 28, and nine officers surrounded the monster’s apartment whilst he was still inside.

When Ichihashi realised police were swarming his home he grabbed his rucksack and - before even putting shoes on - sprinted downstairs in a panic.
But what should have been an easy arrest for the cops soon turned to utter panic when the monster came running out of his door.

He was then seen again as the chaotic manhunt continued – but evaded cops once more by zig-zagging through the street.
This would be the closest the evil murderer  came to being arrested for over two years.
As the nation-wide hunt ensued, Ichihashi fled to an island in Okinawa and worked for 14 months at a construction company.
He endured grim cosmetic surgery and deformed his face to try and throw off any suspicions.

The vile procedure saw the bloodthirsty rapist increase the height of his nose, add a fold to his eyelids, thin his lips and remove moles on his cheek.
He had an obsession with physical fitness and violent Manga, a form of Japanese cartoon.

Eventually, officers received useful leads from a cosmetic surgery, a construction company employee, and a ferry worker who recognised the killer.
They swarmed the area and finally, on November 10 2009, Ichihashi was captured in Osaka whilst trying to board a ferry to Okinawa.
For 31 months the evil beast had evaded any justice for brutally violating and taking the life of the young teacher.
Lindsay’s distraught family pushed for Ichihashi to be executed through Japans death penalty procedure.

They were horrified when lawyers successfully argued he should be kept alive, based on the potential for him to reform.
On 21 July 2011, the Chiba District Court sentenced Ichihashi to life imprisonment for the murder of Lindsay Hawker.
A judge at the case, Masaya Hotta said he was disgusted at the “heinous crime”.
"The victim was raped, with her dignity violated and life taken away while going through unbearable pain. At the age of 22, her future was taken away," he added.
But Ichihashi’s devastating impact on the Hawker family didn’t stop there.

He went on to write a book detailing the horrific acts from his prison cell – before offering Hawker’s horrified mum and dad the royalty money, which they refused.

It sold over 100,000 copies and was a success in Britain – so much so, the story was made into a film 'I Am Ichihashi: Journal of a Murderer'.

Today, Ichihashi remains behind bars to serve out the rest of his sentence.
