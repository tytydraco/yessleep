Five years I’d been in orbit, so the prospect of seeing people again excited me. I may enjoy time alone, but I long for human company as we all do. The day I anticipated soon approached, or so I believed.

As I exit the military spacecraft, desolate mounds of white sand with sparse plant life greet me. The sun beams in the cobalt blue sky over a vast mountain as the wind whistles through the sands and a lone American flag flaps in the breeze.

I furrow my brow and shift my eyes in every which direction. It’s mid-day, where is everyone?Continuing to scan my environment, I stomp through the sand, though turning proves difficult. There were footprints, so I follow them, but they led nowhere, stopping as if the person had vanished.

I expand my search, moving inside the compound, going from door to door. On one desk, a bag of takeout Chinese food sat untouched, on another, a coffee cup still warm to the touch. I panic and my mind races. How could this happen? Where did they go? I try my radio several times, but to no avail. My crew helped me land, and now they are nowhere to be found.

I feel dizzy because no one helped me adjust to Earth's gravity upon arrival. I need to do something soon, so I go back inside the compound. My head spins as I stumble across a wheelchair, plopping myself into it. Did they power the shuttle off and then… disappear? I had nothing.

A noise from the radio in my suit then breaks these speculative thoughts. It was a woman’s voice, yet no one I recognized. She speaks with a hushed rasp that chills me to the bone.

“Thank you for bringing me here,” the voice says.

I jump in my seat and a lump forms in my throat.

“Who are you? Where is my crew?!” I call out, trying to sound assertive and threatening.

“They will be back, unlike last time.”

Last time? What did she mean? 

“Who are you?! Where is everybody?!”

“You don’t remember me? Every time you peered into that black void, I was there. I’ve been watching."

The strange speaking ceases. Instead, it lets out a horrific wail. Nothing human could make that noise, for its screech pierces my eardrums, causing my headache to worsen. This horrendous howling goes on, the noise fluctuates in pitch and volume, but it never stops.

I wheel around in the building, trying to locate the source of this voice. My head pounds and my body needs rest. That was no longer a choice.

When I made it to the control room, I stopped in my tracks. A sign of life, yet it raised more questions. One word burned into the white wall.

“CURARE”

The instant I read this anomalous word, an image of a woman flashes into my brain. Deathly white skin, tangled black hair, and a mouth stained with blood. Gravity has no effect on her hair, for it fans out above her. My heart rate speeds up, and I pass out.

When I come to, the noises only grow worse. Now coming from both my primary radio and my backup radio. But the noises change. Still similar awful wailing sounds, but there are more of them. And they are deep and guttural.

In panic, I realize the noises originate from inside the building, yet here I am confined to the wheelchair. I’m in awful shape for my body has grown weak. I fear if I stand, my legs may break. 

The noise grows quieter on my radio, but louder outside the door. I glance at the security cameras and am greeted by a horrifying sight. That mystery woman was correct. Wandering inside the compound was my crew, or least what used to be my crew.

Their skin is grey, their eyes milky white and a strange gas emanates from their bodies. I have little time to think, evaluating the surrounding room, determining my best course of action. I am unsure of these creatures’ intelligence, so I decide to test them. Do they know where I am? How fast are they? I must figure out as much as possible before they arrive at my door.

I search for ways to defend myself. Smashing open the glass, I grab the fire extinguisher. I wheel over to the janitor’s closet, finding a broom. I break the stick off its handle. This commotion causes the crew to run closer to my location. Thinking fast, I open the sprinklers in another part of the building. It worked. Many of them changing course towards this new distraction.

I check the cameras again, stunned seeing more things wandering in from the desert. Except these are no longer former crew members. They were in the wrong century, their attire being very dated. Wide-brimmed hats, shirts with those ruffled collars...

Is that what the voice meant? Had she made people vanish long ago? With no time to ponder the meaning, my current goal is to stay alive. I continue fiddling with different distractions, but there’s so many inside that they are bound to find me soon. My chest tightens and my breathing speeds up as I can see them coming closer and closer.

Now I have a choice to make. Do I make a run for it, or stand and fight? Well, either way, tough to achieve sitting in this wheelchair. I’m unsure how to kill them, or if they’re killable, for that matter. A thud impacts the door, jolting me to my feet.

I grab the fire extinguisher and press a button, opening the door. The creature comes barreling towards me and I swing the extinguisher at its skull, making a loud thwack. I close the door as quick as possible, hoping no more follow. The creature staggers but continues towards me. I swing again, knocking it to the ground. A horde has built up behind the door, rattling it off its hinges.

After I knock the creature out for the third time, a shiny object slips out of its pocket. A key card. I yank it off the floor and slip it into my pocket. I now had a plan.

Making sure the thing was not moving, I made my escape. I balanced atop my wheelchair, holding a screwdriver in my hand. Adrenaline kicked in when the creature stood back on its feet. Quick, I climbed into the ventilation ducts. Sweat beaded on my brow.

I worked my way through the vents, but I ran into a dead-end. A loud crash echoed throughout the vents behind me. I panicked. They made their way inside the vents. I scooted backwards through the tight corridor as fast as I could manage, now out of breath and heading in another direction.

Shadows rounded the corner behind me, and the pounding of flesh followed. I jumped into a room. Pain shot up my leg as I hit the ground. But I had no time to complain as I limped towards the armory door.

Limping at light speed, I waved my newfound keycard as I approached the door. It flashed green and chimed. I darted inside, slamming the door behind me. I flipped over the place, searching every drawer and cabinet. Finding a pistol, a shotgun, and the ammo for both, I was now prepared. Strange, my foot no longer hurt. In fact, my whole body felt back to normal now.

I loaded the guns and waited, and not too long after, they found me. Chunks of flesh, brain, and blood splattered as I fired upon these former humans. Just as I expected, headshots did the trick. When I ran out of ammo, I just slammed the door shut and reloaded. It was too easy. In half an hour, I massacred two hundred of those things. I’m unsure of how it happened because I’d never been a marksman.

I stood surrounded by corpses, soaked in their blood as the realization came over me. What have I done? My suit radio buzzed.

“Thank you. You have brought forth a thousand demons. I have waited for this moment."

As her words ceased, I watched the bodies before me liquify into blood. I retched, my head pounded again, and I collapsed to the floor. The impious liquid formed into puddles and seeped into the barren earth, draining until it was no more.

I tried to stand, but my right ankle had fractured. I no longer had the strength to walk on it. As I lay there, the ominous wail returned. Frantically, I scanned the surrounding windows but saw nothing. I slid across the floor and grabbed the door, shutting it, the wailing growing louder.

The door shook with ferocious force, yet I saw nothing there. My radio made noise. That loathsome voice again, like sandpaper on my ears.

“Now I offer you a choice. Die for me and receive unlimited joy, or become a slave for the afterlife suffering for eternity.”
