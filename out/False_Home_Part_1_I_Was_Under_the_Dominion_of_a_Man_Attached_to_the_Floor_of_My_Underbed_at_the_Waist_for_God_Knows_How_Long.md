My eyes opened to the melancholy dark of my bedroom.

I focused on a spindled tail of dust that rode along one of the blades of the ceiling fan above me, clinging carelessly as it chopped through the air in endless cycles: tentative, helpless. It reminded me vaguely of myself.

A man’s voice, oil-smooth and pleasant, came from underneath the large bed I lay upon.

"You were talking in your sleep again, William. I hope no bad dreams decided to come along with you into the waking day," the voice said.

I wiped the sleep from my eyes without sitting up.

"No. Nothing," I replied, and it was true. I never dreamt—or at least, I never brought any of my dreams with me into the conscious world. Not for as long as I could remember.

A quartet of long, sallow fingers curled up from underneath the bed, gripping the wooden frame with a firmness that resulted in a soft creaking noise—a plead from the wood, long removed from its home in the Earth, to let whatever was left of its dignity remain unmolested by an appendage so repulsive.

"You were tossing and turning in fits, William. Are you sure? It needs a labyrinth. It needs a face. It needs a heart..." As the words were uttered, the voice under the bed dropped two octaves, booming as if being spoken through a megaphone. The walls winced. I jolted upright.

The voice returned to its liquid, euphonious tone. "No recollection? What could that possibly be about, I wonder."

"I have no clue, Germaine. Just nonsense," I replied. That was mostly true. Fetid, murky water rushed at me from the back of my mind. And there was a girl. Raven-haired and beautiful. I could feel crawling, slithering things just out of sight. Hateful things. I shook the images off.

I looked over at the clock on my nightstand: 11:03 AM. Fuck. I must have slept fourteen hours. My eyes shifted to Moor, my blue foulard necktie, which hung on the ornate knob of my bedroom door. Moor's blade flapped and shuddered at its tip—he’d been waiting for me to wake up. A mouth-like seam parted at the knot of the tie and he began to speak.

"Good morning, Willy. Very concerning noises coming from you last night, my friend. You good? We know you've been working hard lately." The pressed words frazzled out of his silken mouth gruffly.

"Many thanks to the both of you, but I’m fine, really." I slung my legs lazily over the edge, pressing the pads of my feet against the cool, hardwood panes. A small, flirting breeze tickled the hair on my ankles as the air shifted from underneath. The sallow hand had pulled the head and shoulders belonging to the shifting voice out so that it could greet me.

"Germaine," I said, my tone more formal than I had intended.

"William," Germaine replied. A serene smile accompanied his greeting, his teeth white and perfect, and at odds with the room's gloomy disposition. The contrast from the crisp ivory in his mouth darkened the rest of his face, which was clean-shaven and handsome. His hair glinted a golden blonde, neatly parted. His eyes smiled along with his mouth, pupilless and iridescent, like two opals in the shadows.

I gave him an amiable smile back. It was rare for Germaine to pull himself out from underneath enough for me to get a full view of his face, but when he did, it pleased me. None of the others in the house had faces, after all. None except the mannequin—which I’d come to name Abbey—that stood behind the door of False Home, the other house that rested up on the hill. Abbey, as lovely as she had grown to become to my eyes, never returned the sentiment. She was a cool, indifferent prospective customer, and an even colder prospective lover.

I half-remembered a time when Germaine was the one waiting at the other side of the door that belonged to the false-front house. Except that wasn’t quite true. It couldn’t be. Germaine, as commanding and domineering as he was, had no legs; he had no groin. As far as I could tell, the man under the bed's torso was attached to the floor, fused into a horrible union with the house. I didn’t know where Germaine ended and the house began—they may not have even been separate things.

"We're ahead of schedule, so why don't you take a half-day today, William; recharge your batteries. After you eat, run your rounds at False-Home with Abbey, and then come back and relax for the evening. I'll even treat you to some television time in the living room with Noah. You've earned it. Tomorrow we can pick the pace back up," Germaine rewarded me.

My eyes brightened. "Thank you, yes. That would be incredible."

Germaine placed a tender hand on my ankle and slid his way back underneath the bed, out of sight.

I reached over to the dangling chain belonging to the lamp on the nightstand and clicked it on, filling the room with a dull, orange glow. My knees creaked and popped like pinewood, and my muscles bemoaned the faint, acidic cries of overuse.

I stood up, stretched, and stumbled in my boxer briefs drunkenly to the bathroom to piss and prepare for my day. Once I’d shaved and preened myself with meticulous professional care—as any good salesman would before the daily loading of life's deck of cards, as I used to say to myself—I donned one of my many identical blue suits, grabbed my leather briefcase, and picked Moor up off the ornate doorknob, slipping my head through the tie's neck hole.

Moor cinched himself up to my top button wordlessly; silently. Silent except for the faint suckling noise as the tie searched for my trachea, for without him the air outside would burn caustic misery into my naked lungs.

"Outstanding. All's well in a short working day," Moor remarked jovially.

I looked over my shoulder, casting a departing glance at Germaine. Though I could only see two illuminated eyes fending off the swallowing darkness beneath the bed, I felt certain there was no longer a smile hanging on the man under the bed's face.

Gripping the doorknob, I twisted it open and stepped out, beginning the day that would forever entangle me with The Wolf and the living dark.



\*\*\*



Passing through the living room on my way to the kitchen, I glanced at the turn-dial television and Noah—the sofa and my favorite confidante in the house. Noah was an excellent listener, after all.

I gave him a warm pat on his cushioned arm as I moved by. “Morning, Noah. Germaine says we get some TV time together this afternoon, so I’ll see you then. Thinking of either *21 Jump Street* or *Raising Arizona.* What do you think?”

The space between Noah’s cushions parted a little as he spoke. “Hey, Billy! I’m good with whatever you’re in the mood for. It’ll be nice just to have some company in here. It’s been ages!” His voice was cheerful, like a young boy’s.

I smiled faintly and continued my march to the kitchen, pulling a pre-made breakfast croissant out of the refrigerator. I was in too much of a hurry to savor the food, scarfing it down while peering out the window.

Up the weed-spotted gravel road sat False Home. The white vinyl house rested blind in the everlasting twilight. Its gabled roof cut sharply into the horizon of dreaming purples and disphotic blues—a horizon that seemed to hold all the secrets of the expanse.

*Maybe I’ll take Abbey back with me tonight,* I thought. She had never spoken to me or moved in all my countless door-to-door rounds, but what could it hurt? The True Home had power; of that, I was certain. Everything within its walls could speak—Germaine, Moor, Noah—even some of the appliances would titter at times.

And God, did I desperately want to hear a woman’s voice.

Yes, I’d bring Abbey back tonight. Germaine would understand.

I left the house and began the trek up to False Home, passing the farm’s glassy lake. The still water mirrored the sky, reminding me of the rushing river from my vision earlier—the raven-haired girl. What the hell was that?

*Was it a memory from the outside?* Maybe. But I remembered very little from my past life. I knew I was a natural-born salesman—too many door-to-doors at False Home not to understand as much—but every time I dug deeper, my memories turned mottled, like trying to dig a hole in the sand that was ever-filling with the water from the tide.

It wasn’t nothing, though. That vision meant something. I just feared Germaine might have been prodding around in my skull. Looking for… what? I didn’t know. I shoved the thought aside. There were bigger things to focus on tonight. Troublesome visions weren’t in my deck of cards.

The gravel road snaked upward, bordered by tall grass blanketing eight acres of pasture in a dark sea of green. Beyond the pasture stood a woven wire fence on sweet-smelling cedar posts. And beyond that? I didn’t know. A thick canopy of trees stretched endlessly in all directions, and somewhere West of True Home, I could hear the gurgling of running water—a brook or maybe a small river.

But something always stopped me from crossing that fence line. Something told me I wasn't permitted.

As I neared False Home, nerves began to flutter in my stomach. My pulse quickened. Germaine might not like what I planned to do tonight. Still, the excitement at the thought of hearing Abbey—of hearing any voice other than my own and my clothes and the furniture—overpowered that fear.

At the porch steps, I set down my leather briefcase and straightened my sentient necktie. A dutiful sigh from Moor: “Whelp, should be a quick one today. How many you got left?”

I unlatched the drawbolts and opened the briefcase. Golden strands of shimmering light rippled across my face. For a moment, I just stared. My eyes felt too big for their sockets, like a boy holding his father’s nickel-plated revolver for the first time—awed by its beauty; its power-- the deadliness of it all.

“This is the last one,” I said, clearing my throat after the words caught in my mouth. “I’ll need more tomorrow.” I stared at the golden thing a moment longer before snapping the case shut with finality.

“Perfect. Let’s get this over with so we can have some R&R for a change,” Moor said, the weariness in his voice unmistakable. “Our work is important—maybe the most important thing there is—but fuck me, Will… this isn’t easy sometimes, you know?”

“Oh, I know,” I muttered. My thoughts darkened as I considered the work ahead. Thoughts that reminded me how lonely I was. Maybe the loneliest man in existence—which, as far as I knew, wasn’t far from the truth.

*I was a person once.*

That thought stung, but my starving heart clung to it anyway, sending back a desperate message for comfort.

*Abbey,* it said.

“That’s right,” I whispered aloud.

“Huh?” Moor sounded startled.

“I’m going to try something tonight,” I said, "and I need you to be on board."

  
And I told him my plan.

  
"Absolutely fucking not! I’m not taking part in any of these shenanigans, and neither are you. Who knows what Germaine will do if he finds out I brought that piece of plastic into the house, but it sure as Hell wouldn’t be pretty. He gave us the afternoon off—do you really want to screw this up for everyone? No, No way...”

Moor flapped and jittered, his fabric edges rustling with disheveled urgency. He looked ridiculous, like some kind of frantic little bird, and for the first time since I’d known him, he cursed.

I blinked in surprise, suddenly thrown off balance.

I let his outburst settle before deciding to try again, more carefully this time. “Moor, I just want to see if it works. She’ll be back before I even start the day tomor—”

“That MANNEQUIN is behind THAT door for one reason:,” Moor snapped, cutting me off. “--for you to run your rounds and unload the contents of that briefcase you’re holding. End of story.”

“Her name is Abbey,” I said, softly but firmly.

“That’s just a name you gave it!” he hissed. “It doesn’t have a name because it doesn’t belong in the house! Let me remind you of something, pal: the only reason you’re not hunched over trying to scratch your lungs out of your chest is because I’m here around your neck. I could loosen up, and you’d be completely fucked. Can't breath the air out here alone, remember?. So let’s go. Do your round, and let’s get out of here!”

I held his gaze—or at least, I imagined I did, since he didn’t have eyes. But I suspected Moor wouldn’t survive without me either. Not for long, anyway.  If we could even die. I decided he was bluffing. 

“I’m taking her home with us. If you’re going to leave me out here, then do it,” I said, my tone sharp; final. Moor didn’t respond right away, and when he finally tried, his words tumbled out as incoherent, flustered nonsense.

I felt my voice crack, betraying my tightly held composure. “I... I can’t remember what a woman’s voice sounds like,” I admitted, the words lodging themselves in my throat. “I need this. I promise, we’ll have her back before morning.”

Moor sighed heavily, thick with resignation: “Fine. But I’m not involved, and I’m not lying for you if Germaine finds out. This is so messed up, Will.”

I didn’t reply. I simply stepped onto the white, paint-chipped porch, the creaking boards beneath me almost whispering disapproval. I knocked three times on False Home’s door.

As always, the door swung outward, its hinges groaning, sending small puffs of dust spiraling into the air. Behind it, stood Abbey.

Her bone-white figure dawned a sleeveless turquoise swing dress that danced faintly in the breeze. Her bald, shining head only highlighted the delicately painted brows and the striking, sapphire acrylic eyes. To anyone else, she might have looked just like any old display prop, but to me, she was beautiful—not because she was an “ideal” image but because she was *any* image at all. She was a face.

She had eyes that might blink. A mouth that might smile. Hands that could touch and legs that could wander the house with me—or maybe even the twilight fields beyond it. I wasn’t foolish enough to ignore the desperation behind my feelings, but that didn’t make them any less real.

I imagined all the ways life might bloom from her.

I swallowed hard, trying to steady myself. My palms were slick with cold sweat. First, I had to complete my task. Then I could bring her home.

I slipped into a familiar rhythm--professionalism sliding into place like an old suit. “Good day, Abbey! It’s nice to see you again, as always,” I greeted her, unlocking the briefcase again with practiced clicks. “I’ve got one ticket for you today. Germaine gave us the afternoon off, so I won’t be making more rounds until tomorrow, but I’ll have plenty more soon.”

I removed the shimmering, golden ticket stub, its frilled edges twinkling as if alive. For a moment, I held it out with reverence before sliding it into the receptacle beside her.

The machine behind her buzzed faintly, the air thickening with a strange, fuzzy static. My task was done.

I turned to Abbey and took a deep breath. “Abbey, I’ve been coming to your door for a long time now. I don’t know how long exactly, but I’d like to think you’ve heard me. Anything seems possible here. I’ve started to think of us as friends. Maybe that’s pathetic, but...”

“God, this is so screwed up,” Moor muttered, his voice quiet but cutting.

“Shut up,” I snapped, yanking him tight enough to strain my neck. He squawked but fell silent.

“Anyway, I consider us friends,” I continued, “and I don’t have much company. There’s Moor, Noah, and Germaine, but... that’s it. I’m going to take you home with us. Just for tonight for starters. If you’re not happy with it, well, just let me know, okay? I thought it’d be nice for us to hear more about you. You've heard so much about me over these long--- years? Well anyway, as I said, I'll bring you back by morning. If this even works...”

I stepped in closer and lifted her with ease, her lightness startling me. A thin vine I hadn't noticed before, that clung to one of her thighs beneath her dress, tore loose. In the dim light, the severed tendril shimmered with little buds, one of which had bloomed into a stunning, luminescent little blue flower.

I felt an unexplainable pull toward its petals. The flower seemed alive—no, more than alive. It seemed to hold dreams within its pigment. Memories. Mine.

“Better leave that alone, big guy,” Moor said, his voice small but trembling.

I nodded, placing the flower down gently. I was shaken, but there were questions I couldn’t ask tonight. Tonight, I had other plans.
