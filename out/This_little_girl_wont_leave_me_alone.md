I grew up in a large, eerie house on the outskirts of town. My parents had inherited it from my grandparents, who had passed away under mysterious circumstances years before I was born. The house had an ominous presence, with creaking floorboards, drafty windows and an overall feeling of unease.

As a child, I would often wake up in the middle of the night to the sound of footsteps in the hallway, or to see shadows moving across my bedroom walls. My parents believed it was sleep paralysis and brushed it off as my imagination, but I knew what I had seen and heard was real. I would lay in bed, wide-eyed and trembling, too scared to move or call out for help. The fear I felt was overwhelming, it was like something was watching me all the time. 

As I grew older, the occurrences in the house became more frequent and more intense. Objects would move on their own, doors would open and close on their own, and I would hear strange noises coming from the walls. I began to notice ghostly figures, their human-like traits and emotions etched on their ethereal faces, lingering in the corners of my vision. My parents, however, refused to believe that there was anything wrong with the house and dismissed my claims as a child's fanciful imagination.

Despite the strangeness of the house, I grew accustomed to the ghostly sightings and noises, but it never truly left me. I would often have nightmares of being chased by the ghostly figure I had seen in my bedroom, and it was hard to shake off the feeling of being watched. I tried to ignore it, but it was always there, lurking in the back of my mind.

But one event changed everything. One night, as I was going to bed, I saw a ghostly figure, a little girl holding a black teddy bear, standing at the foot of my bed, staring at me with a malevolent grin. The light from the hallway outside shined off the teddy bear's glass more than the girl's, of which I could not even make out. It was then that I knew I couldn't ignore the ghosts anymore and I had to find out the truth behind the mysterious deaths of my grandparents and the source of the haunting.

The following weeks following this incident I would constantly see dark shadows at the corner of my eye that would be gone if I turned to look. Not like before however, this time it would be a pony tail quickly disappearing, a small bell ding or a giggle. I spent months researching the history of the house and the previous occupants, and what I found shook me to my core. I discovered that the previous owner, a man who lived in the house with his wife and infant daughter, had murdered his daughter in her sleep, driven to madness by the constant crying of the baby. The wife, unable to bear the guilt, killed herself soon after. The man was never caught and the murders were never solved. The ghosts of the murdered infant and her mother haunted the house, seeking revenge on anyone who dared to live there.

I knew I had to get out of that house before it was too late. I begged my parents to move, but they refused to believe that there was anything wrong with the house. I was trapped, living in fear every day, wondering when the next ghostly encounter would happen. The experience had a profound effect on me, it was like my childhood had been stolen from me. The memories of the haunting stayed with me, even after I left the house and moved on with my life. It was a constant reminder of the terror and fear that I had experienced, and I would never be able to forget it.

Years later, I moved out and got my own apartment, I thought I had finally escaped the haunting, but it was not over yet. One night, as I was going to bed, I saw the same ghostly figure standing at the foot of my bed, staring at me with a malevolent grin. I was paralyzed with fear, it was as if the ghost had followed me to my new home. It was then that I realized that the ghost was not tied to the house, but to me.

I knew I had to do something to put an end to this. I couldn't continue living in fear, constantly looking over my shoulder. I began researching ways to deal with malevolent spirits and soon discovered that there were people who specialized in dealing with hauntings. I contacted one of them and they came to my apartment to investigate. After conducting a thorough examination of my apartment, they confirmed that there was indeed a malevolent spirit present and that it was likely the same one that had haunted me in my childhood home.

The investigator attempted to assist me contact the spirit with the knowledge we knew, however to no avail, with some lights flashing and candles being blown out and nothing more. Since there were no more events after the investigator's supposed communication with the spirit, he called it a job well done and went on with his payment, but as he closed the door to my apartment behind him, I let out a defeated sigh as my eyes met the void of the little girl's eyes in the corner.
