For some context, my name is Desmond Cartright. I’m an Afghanistan War veteran; I did my time and retired, and I am 37 years old as of this writing and this all started about 4 and half months ago. I’ll be updating the story with developments as they happen.

After retiring 7 years ago, I bought a Winnebago Brave SE. When I got her, she was in rough shape, barely held together by bubble gum and hope. My 10-year-old son Clay and I fixed her as a summer project. In the winter, we took her for the first trip and named her Liberty, since the first place we visited was New York to see the statue of the same name.

Liberty has been a beast of a machine ever since we restored her, and with each check that came in, I kept upgrading her. I have an arrangement with my ex-wife (we’re still on good terms.) that, because I travel a lot, Clay stays with her during the school year and spends winter break with me. Clay has been my entire world since retiring. There isn’t a day that goes by that I don’t think of my son; he’s what keeps me going. No matter when, I can describe him in perfect detail: his smile like a beam of hope, the way he flails his arms when he’s upset, hell even the look in his eyes after he tires himself out. So every dime that comes in, I’ve put into this machine, so when I get to have him for those short three weeks, he’s always blown away.

I’ve put a TV in here, rewired the whole thing to allow for better speakers for music, and made the bed in the back a bunk bed. You name something a kid might want from an RV, and I’ve made it work here. I thank God every day that Clay didn’t get hit too hard by puberty. Sure,  his interests have changed, but he never got that. ‘All adults are lame.’ Phase.

I never expected to receive a gift from my son, but I was quite surprised when he brought me one last year. It was a tiny puppy; he said it was named Archer and that it was a basset hound. I showered my son with praise and thanks and promised to take good care of Archer. I was never much for pets, but I didn’t have the heart to tell my son, especially after he mentioned begging his friend to let him have the dog. Clay is everything I’ve ever had, and if he wants me to have this dog, neither heaven nor high water is going to stop me from taking care of it.

Archer is... well, he’s an odd dog; he’s got those textbook floppy ears and the droopy skin over his eyes, but he tends to stick to himself more than most dogs I’ve met. He spiked in size over the past year, from that tiny puppy to a fat old man, despite being a year old. He’s never been aggressive, but he’s strangely smart. I’ve seen him up the fridge by himself to grab out his kibble, and despite being a dog, he never seems to overfeed himself. I’ve decided to not look a gift... dog in the mouth and just accept that he’s self-sustaining. He’s pretty polite too; he never chewed on anything or pissed anywhere he wasn’t supposed to; sometimes he even leans against me to be pet.

Clay’s been begging his mom for a new PS5 this Christmas, so I saved up for the past month and had to skip some meals, but it’ll be worth it when I tell him he gets to take it home with him. It’s just about 2 weeks before he’ll be heading down for our winter trip, so I’m heading north to meet him off of his flight. I met him at an airport in Minneapolis since he flew down from Canada; it’s where his mother remarried. On my way, I usually pass by Kansas City, grab an early dinner, and drive through the night to Des Moines to park up and pass out for the morning. He flies the red-eye and gets in around 3 in the morning.

On my regular route this time, it was around 11:30 p.m. when I pulled into Eaglevile and stopped up for gas. I’d never really stopped here before, but I was running low on my main tank and my backups in storage, so I paid some big bucks to fill all of them up, probably enough to keep running for a few days since I wouldn’t want to have to stop on my way to Minneapolis.

I set off around 11:50. Archer was fast asleep, so I kept quiet as we rolled down I-35. Snow littered the roads, but Liberty trucked through it just fine. There were hardly any people riding this highway at this hour, just the occasional semi. The first thing I noticed as we approached the witching hour was the distinct lack of even those regular sights. I shrugged off this oddity as just a weird schedule to run on. I shouldn’t have been so naive. As I approached the border of Missouri and Iowa, I expected to see the sign as I rolled over the bridge—the one I had seen at least five times before. “The people of Iowa welcome you. Fields of Opportunity.” So you can imagine my surprise when the sign was blurred.

Not blurry, blurred, like you had put a digitizer over the whole thing and turned it milky white. I rubbed my eyes to be sure, but when I opened my eyes, the sign was knocked over. I drove past in a daze, unsure of what had just happened. That’s the second time in this short span I should have known something was wrong. The fact that I didn’t know where I was soon became apparent. I expected to roll into a town called Lamoni; I had been here dozens of times before.

My heart sank when the town I rolled into looked like a bomb had ripped it apart. I’ve seen what explosions do to buildings, and it was clear from the rubble. I stopped Liberty and stepped out with a now-wide-awake Archer. I grabbed my flashlight and, with my gun at my hip, approached a collapsed building cautiously. The cars in the driveway were untouched and almost looked freshly waxed. Moving through the rubble, there was no sign of life or shrapnel from an explosion. I was startled as Archer began to howl. Turning to look, I was met with a man standing in a sharp, two-piece suit. He looked like he was pulled straight from the 50s, pale, mid-30s, slicked hair, about 6’2, cigarette in one hand, briefcase in the other.

I shined my flashlight on his face, but his eyes didn’t react, and neither did his pupils. He stared past me as if I weren’t there, so I called out to him.

DC: “Buddy, are you alright? Is this your home?”

In his response, his voice didn’t echo as mine did; it sounded like it had been filtered through an audio mixer and cleaned.

UNNAMED MAN: “Honey! I’m home!” Somehow, a laugh track followed his words; the track was sudden and loud, like a crowd of people standing just behind me.

I backed away from the house, Archer bolting to the RV. I turned and watched the man from a distance, yet his voice never sounded far away. Then I heard… I’m not sure what it was, but it wasn’t human. It sounded like the rocks from the rubble ground together to form words. I was able to make them out, but I’m not sure how. They were a garbled mess.

RUBBLE: "Oh, Bart, you.” Cooed like a 50s housewife, the laugh track began, louder this time as I clutched my ears and fell to a knee. I had mortar shells impact next to me that sounded quieter than this, so I packed myself into the RV.

This had been weird enough; I was going to turn around and come back in the morning. As I started the engine, this strange music was blaring through the radio; it sounded like the opening to those old sitcoms, with an announcer's voice and all. I quickly reached for the knob and turned the volume off. I felt my hands clam up as the music and voice didn’t get quieter. I turned the RV around as I heard.

ANNOUNCER: “It’s everyone’s favorite show, Bart’s Darts!” The announcer called with vigor and passion in his words. I pressed the gas to the floor as we peeled back towards the bridge we had crossed to enter what I’m not entirely sure was Iowa anymore.

My ears began to ring as I swerved Liberty out of the way of a massive boulder launched toward us. It impacted the ground with a shock, shaking the RV and tearing concrete from the ground. I heard that man’s voice again, as if he were right next to me, despite the distance.

BART: “Looks like I missed that short, honey. Haha, let’s hope the next one is a bullseye!” I heard another sickening crack. I could assume another boulder was heading our way; checking the rear view was a mistake. I saw the man reaching for the rubble of his home, picking up chunks of what he called his wife and throwing them in my direction as I watched the last one fly over Liberty.

My eyes found the road too slowly; the rock impacted just in front of Liberty, and the RV smashed into it like a brick wall. My seatbelt was strapped, but my head slammed into the back of the seat, and my eyes slipped closed as I heard a horrid crashing sound of flesh against the glass. I couldn’t bring myself to look, but the blood pooling in my lap told me that my passenger had lost his footing.

I unbuckled and slipped from the door, collapsing to the pavement as I knew I had a concussion. I’d had my fair share before, but the pain and fog did nothing to stop me. I was furious; I had sworn to protect that dog, and now some nightmare creature had snapped him away from me. I noticed the sign lying next to me, the one I had passed into. ”Iowa” was tattered and laying face up, it read. “Welcome Home.” I didn’t have time to process what that was trying to say or mean. I had to push; that thing was getting ready for another throw; it had to run to keep up with the RV; it had to have run over 60 miles per hour to keep pace. At this point, I doubted my chance to survive, but I’d be damned if I’d give up without a fight.

He stood about 150 feet from me; it was a distance, but seeing the beachball-sized rock he was holding between two elongated, unnatural fingers made me sure I had one chance. I pulled the Glock from my side and dumped the mag in his direction. I watched 8 shots find purchase, 7 to the torso and 1 to the head. The torso shots came first; on the 8th, he let the rock fly. I watched his body drop to the ground, lifeless, with a thud, just as the rock impacted my chest and left me splattered against the pavement.

Now the question: “How are you typing this?” Is it a fair one, one I don’t rightly have the answer to? I just opened my eyes and swerved to the side of the road. Archer is asleep in the back, and my heart is beating out of my chest as the sign reads, “Welcome Home.”
