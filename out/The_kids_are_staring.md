“Tom she’s staring at me again” I whispered to my husband. He turned around and scanned the coffee shop but didn’t see her.

A girl no older than 15 had her eyes glued to me as soon as me and my husband walked into the shop. I felt her cold gaze on me from all the way across the room. I didn’t even know kids liked coffee, times sure have changed.

But there was something off about her, she wore a red and black boarding school uniform with long, curly red hair. Usually girls of her age are smiling and making videos on their phones but this girl’s demeanor was cold and serious. 

Every time my husband would look away she would stare me down, almost as if she knew he wouldn’t catch her, she toyed with me. As me and her kept eye contact she flashed a devilish grin that sent a wave of coldness down my spine. I got up and walked out of the coffee shop, my husband followed.

We walked to the subway station and boarded the train home. Throughout the ride my husband filled my ears with questions about the girl, why I left the shop and why I was so-

I felt my heart sink to the floor…… my eyes locked with a boy around the same age as the girl in the coffee shop. Same uniform, only his hair was messy and blonde, but the exact same stare. His eyes were actually more manic, his smile became more deranged as he stared at me.

I grabbed my husband’s arm and almost dragged him out of the train when the doors opened to our stop. My mind was racing, who were these kids ? 

My husband laughed at my paranoia after I explained to him what was happening. He couldn’t believe I would let some “kids” get me this worked up.

“Was he right ?” I asked myself. I listened to him and chalked it up to me just being paranoid.

As I slightly opened our apartment door I felt something sharp pierce my body. 

I stared at the knife that twisted inside of my stomach before looking up to see a different boy in that same black and red uniform, behind him was the girl from the coffee shop and the boy from the train. All staring and smiling.

My husband tried to rush to my aid but the blonde haired boy quickly tackled him with ease and subdued him.

“Please let my wife go” my husband begged.

I felt the knife twisting inside of me. 

“Your wife huh ?” The boy with the knife said.

He pulled out a pendant from inside of his shirt and held it up to me. They all did the same.

Crosses.

I felt my body start to tingle before feeling my skin rip open , followed by a burning sensation. My skin began to melt, I felt anguish. I looked into the boy’s brown eyes as he stared into my now red ones.

“Please don’t send me back” I begged.
