A demon has been watching me from afar for a few months now, and only I can see him. He makes appearances almost every day. 

From peeking from behind a tree or sitting next to me on the train into the city... He is always watching, and I see him. 

I never knew what his intentions were. He seemed harmless, or so I thought. The first appearance he made was on October 31, 2023. At first, I thought he was a kid, dressing up as something scary for Halloween like most kids do. But after Halloween, he became a part of my everyday life.

 when it comes to the dishes, or even reading a book in the park, he's always there, lurking from a corner, sticking his head above my fence to get a glance at me, I always see him, he always sees me. 

I accepted my fate a while ago as I've tried doing anything in my power to make it go away, my most recent attempt was carrying holy water with me anywhere i go, hoping to repel whatever he is. Didn't work, I soon found out it only works when it's near you, holy water kills it. I still use holy water to my advantage; just in case he tries anything smart.

 It was only a month ago he started making appearances inside my house, ever since, you could never catch me inside my house. I don't think I mentioned that i have a kid, Ava. She's 7 years old and is the best thing that ever happened to me, but I think she's starting to see it too. 

"Mom! Look, it's Apollyon!"

 She points outside, and guess what? He is hiding inside the bush. (Apollyon is a name my daughter came up with, I later found out that "Apollyon" is a synonym for Satan in Greek) 

A few days later I catch Ava speaking to Apollyon 

"Dad... Is that you?"

 Apollyon tries to smile, which extends to his ear. Ava screams and runs to her room, Apollyon is visibly upset in some way, it was a weird experience. 

Ava's father passed away from cancer of the lungs, he worked in a factory a while back and all that gas caught up to him. Ava was too young to remember him, she was only 4 months when he died. It was a tough time for me, I tried going on a few dates, but nobody ever stuck out to me.   
  
About a week ago was when my life really started to change.    
  
"Mom, stop pretending I'm real."   
  
"What do you mean, Ava? Are you okay?"   
  
"it's time to let me go."   
  
I stopped seeing Ava, I looked for her everywhere. She didn't come back again. I never saw her. I decided I was going to move somewhere for a change and try to escape Apollyon. An hour into my drive I was already feeling free. I was excited for my fresh start, new men, new friends, new places to explore. Of course, I'll visit my old friends, but Apollyon will be there as well, waiting for me. Then, I felt like i was being watched, it was Apollyon in the passenger seat! I crash the car. Everything went dark.   
  
"Diane wake up, you're safe now" a voice echoed    
  
I woke up, I was in this bed and there were doctors surrounding me. I was in the hospital.    
  
"What the fuck am I doing here, where's ava, what happened?"   
  
"You were in a car crash, Diane. You don't have a daughter"   
  
"Oh" I cried.   
  
I cried a lot that day. My life would never be the same. I didn't even know what happened to Apollyon. It felt like he was my only friend.   
  
Yesterday I was discharged after being in the hospital for a week, luckily, I didn't have serious damage. I decided to see a therapist so that I wouldn't be so sad anymore, I couldn't take it anymore, I gave in to the therapist and let her take my money, she was an old woman in her late 60s, but she was beautiful nether the less.    
  
"Let's talk about Apollyon."   
  
"I've been seeing him for the past few months and my daughter has too. But she went missing a while ago."    
  
"Ah, your 'daughter' ava, yes?"    
  
"Yeah... Why did you say daughter sarcastically?"   
  
"She doesn't exist, neither does Apollyon. Have you been taking your meds?"   
  
"What meds? I'm perfectly fine, why won't anyone believe me?"   
  
"Diane. You were diagnosed with schizophrenia... Remember? This was a while ago, after, Ava died?"
