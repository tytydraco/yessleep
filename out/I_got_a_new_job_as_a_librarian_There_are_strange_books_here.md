I got a new job recently. 
  
I know that nowadays, being a librarian isn't what it used to be. They're underpaid, overworked and running on fumes - the lack of funding from local municipalities certainly plays a role, and the internet makes it so that checking out books can either be done entirely online or not at all. That said, I still think they're an important pillar of the community - a place where you can just be, where you don't have to spend money to exist, where you can simply pick up a book, sit down and read.

While most libraries are run and funded by the municipality, this one wasn't. It was someone's private library that they've opened to the public. It was tucked away in a quaint little village, and it looked and functioned just like a normal library - anyone can come in, apply for membership, and start borrowing. The only difference is that this library has a private section that was invite-only. To be able to borrow from that section, you had to be approved by the owner himself. Not even I was allowed to enter that section. Only the head librarian and my manager, Johanna Lenz, had the key. 

One night, right before closing, a young man came in. I hadn't seen him before - he had thick, curly hair and deep brown eyes that had a gold sheen if you looked at it in the right angle. He greeted me politely and handed me his library card. It was one of the special ones. It said his name was Michael Leigh and it had a black border with intricate patterns to denote his special access. 

“Ah, welcome, Michael," I said, a little nervous. "How can I help you?” 

"I'm here to return a book," he said with a smile, and handed me a tattered copy of Oliver Twist. It looked like it had the normal library sticker on the spine. 

I quitly sighed with relief  - if he'd given me a book that belonged to the private collection, I wouldn't have been able to help him. Johanna had called in sick, which was a surprise because she seemed tough as nails. 

“Certainly!" I opened the inside of the book and stamped the return on the little leaflet. "Thank you very much.”
  

“No problem," Michael said. "Do you enjoy working here?” 

I nodded excitedly. "Oh yes! I really enjoy working with books. I think they're special - so much knowledge, fun and adventure in them." 

Michael smiled. "I'm glad you think so." He turned to leave, before he seemed to remember something and turned back. "Oh, by the way - as you might have noticed, old Hannah is getting on in age. It's good that she has someone so enthusiastic like you." 

He looked at the Oliver Twist I was holding. "Say, would you like to have access to the private collection? I'm sure you'llbe of great help." 

“Oh! I haven't been here too long, but I'd be happy to help Johanna out with the private collection.” 

Michael nodded. "Just go put that book away, and I'm sure the big boss will give you the key." He turned around and waved at me as he walked out the door. "Good luck~" 

I was a little confused as I was standing here with Oliver Twist. It was just a book from the normal collection, right? Sure, I might wander around a little to try and find the correct shelf, since I don't have them all memorized yet, but I'll get it eventually. 

I set about to put it back. A hardcover Oliver Twist, by Charles Dickens, so DIC. The code was 0207020582, 02 for fiction, 07 for historical, 02 for children's books, 05 for fifth edition, and 82 for year of print. A bit of an unconventional system, if I may say - it takes some getting used to. To make matters even more complicated, the private collection apparently used an entirely different system, but that's neither here nor there.  

I walked over to the children's section, but before I was able to put it back, the dustcover slipped. I was a little surprised to see that it had one to begin with, as I could've sworn it didn't have a dustcover before. It was probably just glued on very well. I cringed a little - I needed to be more careful with these older books. 

I put the book down at a nearby table and started to readjust the cover, when I noticed that the book itself wasn't Oliver Twist at all. It was a leather-bound version of Call of the Wild, by Jack London, first edition 1960. The leather was old and scarred, like it had really been in the wild. The title looked as if it had been sloppily carved out. At this point, I was angry both at myself and at Michael. At myself for not checking better, and at Michael for bringing the book in with the wrong cover. I sighed and went to put it back. LON-0207020160. 

I stopped again. The title... shifted? It now read "Vocatio Ferarum." I stopped and frowned, and flipped open to a random page. The page I opened was a double-paged illustration of the wild woods on a dark night, with our hero-wolfdog standing on a rock, looking down on me, his teeth bared and his eyes stark in the night. It seemed like he was beckoning me, daring me to come to him. I could almost feel the wintery chill on my skin, and my nose caught a whiff of frozen pine.  

I slammed the book shut, and the sensation disappeared. I slowly opened the book and looked closer at the inner cover, at the leaflet where I put down the stamp. 

From Hilfur Jensen's private collection.

I cursed inwardly. I couldn't call Johanna as she was sick, but I couldn't leave it here either. It seemed wrong, somehow. I remembered Michael's 'good luck' - I was beginning to understand why he said that. I decided to put the book in the back and that was that. No more weird shifting titles or mistaken dust covers. I was just tired and the setting sun was playing tricks. 

I started walking back when the lights flickered off. I stopped, suddenly standing in darkness. I thought it was still sunset, but now it was completely dark. When I looked outside, I froze - I saw a full moon high up in the sky. Something was so, very wrong - it was 6 pm, even if it would get a little dark, it was nowhere near the full moon. The smell of pines was stronger now and I could almost feel the temperature dropping. I stepped back in surprise - it felt and sounded like I stepped on snow. 

I could hear something rustling between the shelves, a deep and guttural growl, and I stood very still. A wolf? Here, in the library? I held out a hand to try and stabilize myself on a nearby shelf, but all I could feel was the hard bark of a tree. I immediately withdrew my hand - but when I looked, all I could see was a shelf. I clutched the book to my chest, trying to find any comfort at all. The leather was icy cold. "No," I said softly. I couldn't believe what was happening - this isn't real. 

The growling got louder. "No!" I shouted this time and started running as fast as I could. I felt like a rabbit before the wolves, and I wished I could burrow somewhere safe, but I couldn't. I could hear panting and howling as the wolves ran after me. I jumped over the counter, straight through the door to the back and slammed it shut behind me. 

I was in total darkness. I could hear the wolves scratching and howling at the door. I breathed a sigh of relief - but that was short-lived when I heard something growl in the darkness. 

I saw two golden eyes looking at me, glowing - as if emitting their own light. They were staring me down like I was prey. But I realized it wasn't looking at me - it was looking at the book. In its eyes I could see a yearning for freedom, and that book could give it. 

Then, all of a sudden, it lunged at my chest. I suppressed a scream and dodged - the wolf disappeared into the darkness. I followed the walls, flailing blindly, trying to find an exit, any exit. I could feel its claws scratch my legs, his barking ringing in my ear. I was kicking and screaming and I felt my legs connect with something heavy - a yelp rang out in the dark. Finally, I found a door - it was open! I could almost cry in relief. I quickly went through, and with all my might I closed the door, the wolf throwing his whole weight against it.

I collapsed right there and sobbed. What was going on? What is this book? I tried to convince myself that it was all a dream, but it felt far too real. I felt my leg - it was bleeding where the wolf scratched me. I cried again, burying my head in my knees. I wished I never got this job. 

After what seemed like a long time, I noticed that the scratching and barking had stopped. I still didn't want to go out there, in case they came back. It was only now that I started wondering where I was. The storage room only had one other door - the door to the private collection. I frowned - usually a key was needed. I guessed that Johanna forgot to lock it.

I felt the floor behind me - a step going down. It made sense that the private collection would be in the basement. I picked up the book and slowly went down the steps, feeling around carefully. The steps were uneven but smoothened over by age and use, as if they'd been there far before the library was even built. I could feel strange carvings along the walls. Finally, the steps ended, and the space opened up. I felt around for a light switch - I flicked it. 

It only lit up the first row of dusty books. I could see the outline of more rows, but they all disappeared in utter darkness. The books in the shelves were strange. I could immediately tell they were old, and so very similar to the one I was holding. I didn't want to enter, but I knew I had to, to make the wolves stop. 

The codes were different here, like I said, but I didn't know the logic behind them. Yet, I noticed that the code itself was the same - I supposed the meaning behind the numbers were different. I laughed to myself - why am I thinking about sorting with wolves in my library? I found an empty spot that wasn't as dusty, and to my relief, it seems like this was also where this book belonged. I put it back, and immediately, the oppressing cold lifted from my skin. I couldn't smell the pine anymore. I couldn't hear the wolves. They were gone.  

I almost collapsed again from relief, but I stayed upright and went back up the stairs. In the library, the sunset was back. I went home. 

I don't know why, but I went back to work the next morning. I think I still half-believed it was a weird dream and I was craving routine and normalcy. Johanna still wasn't there, but there was an envelope laying on the counter. It had a letter. 
  

"Excellent work. Congratulations on your new position."

I sighed. I knew I should resign. I knew I should run the other way very fast and try to look for a different job... yet, at the same time, I knew I couldn't. I don't know why, but something had shifted in me.

At least the position came with a hefty raise.
