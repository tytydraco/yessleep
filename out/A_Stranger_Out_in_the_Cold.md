I was always uncomfortable with the idea of living alone. Any time my parents would go out and leave me at home as a kid I’d get pretty anxious. Stories of home invasions and kidnappings were always on my mind. So when I moved out and got my own place it took me a while to really settle into being on my own. 

I found a quiet neighborhood, a little cul-de-sac full of people who’d lived there for decades. Everyone kept to themselves and I hardly ever saw my neighbors. But all good things come to an end I suppose. 

During a freezing cold December night my town lost power. It sucked but there wasn’t much to do other than wrap myself up in some blankets and sleep through it. I was on the verge of sleep when my attention was drawn to a slow, methodical tapping at my window.

I tried to ignore it but the tapping quickly turned to knocking. Being torn from my cozy rest annoyed me but the idea of someone being stranded in the cold because I didn’t want to get up won out in my mind. So I got up and sleepily walked over to the window. I pulled back the blinds and cracked it open. A wave of freezing air washed over me. 

“Hello?” I called out.

A woman responded from the darkness, “I’m so sorry to bother you but I’m short on blankets and it’s very cold.” 

I felt oddly comforted by her voice so I asked her to come around to the front door. I closed the window and stumbled through my dark home, finally arriving at the door and unlocking it. I invited the woman inside, still unable to discern any of her features. 

“One second I’ll grab my phone.” I reassured, leaving her in the entryway. 

I retrieved my phone from my nightstand and turned on the flashlight. I made my way back to the front of the house, now navigating a lot smoother. 

“I’ll let you take your pick for the blankets.” I shouted to the woman.

The house suddenly felt quiet. I could hear my heart beating slightly faster than usual. When I turned the corner to the entryway a sense of dread hit me. I had let a stranger into my home. Sleepy or not I should’ve been more aware of how stupid that was. But now, that stranger had disappeared. My mind swarmed with that old childhood fear. 

I couldn’t speak. My limbs felt heavy. I barely managed to pry my feet from the floor and began sneaking back to the hallway, shining my flashlight around wildly. I caught a slight bit of movement at the very edge of my light. I jumped and pointed my phone in the direction of the figure. 

I could only see a long, bony arm peeking out from behind a doorway. It was as if she was hiding, waiting for me to get closer. My fight or flight was in full swing. But I couldn’t run. Tears were filling my eyes and I held my breath. The arm shifted and a head tilted around the door frame. Her eyes were large and blue, glinting in my flashlight beam. Her face was thin, like her skin was a loose cloth covering her skull. I instinctively sprinted up the stairs to my right out of fear. 

I couldn’t see it but I heard rapid footsteps following close behind. I tripped over the last stair and rushed into the nearest room. I slammed the door closed and locked it. I was in a tiny bathroom, no space to run or hide. I hastily dialed 911, praying the snow wouldn’t prevent them from getting to me in time. 

“Come on. It’s cold. Keep me warm.” The woman spoke softly. 

I closed my eyes and tried to steady my breathing. 

“Open the door, please.” She lulled. 

I choked on tears while speaking to the 911 operator. 

“Open the goddamn door.” She shouted, forcefully. 

“Fuck you!” I yelled back. It was all I could do. A facade of confidence.

She began kicking the door. The loud thumping of the wood sent waves of anxiety through my body. The operator on the phone reassured me there were cops on the way. It was only a slight comfort, quickly ripped away by the sounds of the woman screaming while hitting the door. 

It sounded like the hinges were about to snap. I pushed back against the door. Feeling the door rock with every hit was overwhelming. After at least 10 minutes she finally gave up. I curled up into a ball and cried to myself quietly. 

Another 10 minutes later the police finally arrived. They searched through the house but didn’t find her. I was completely shaken by the whole thing, I felt sick. Sleep was impossible. Paranoia consumed me and I left to stay with my parents for a while. I was finally feeling well enough to go back home but recently my father has been complaining about tapping outside his window at night.
