Agricultural horror story

You think you will always be the top of the food chain. How naive. There are roots deeper than your arrogance, and worlds you should never have stepped on.

Mateo was one of those farmers from before. Quiet, weathered by the sun and hard work. His farm was far from town, land inherited from his father and grandfather before him. He grew onions, potatoes and pumpkins without modern machinery, just his hands, his hoe... and a silence that sometimes seemed more alive than the field.

One April morning, as he walked through the freshly watered furrows, the earth trembled slightly under his boots. Before he could react, the ground opened as if breathing, and Mateo was swallowed by a black hole of wet roots and the smell of rot.

He fell for what seemed like an eternity, hitting slippery, slime-covered walls. He finally landed in an underground tunnel illuminated by a dull green light that had no visible source.

The atmosphere down there was thick, as if breathing steam from rotten earth. Then he saw them: onions the size of a child, with short legs and deformed arms. They had eyes. Human eyes. Some even seemed to have teeth. They walked upright, and as they passed, they left behind them a smell of wet death.

Mateo couldn't move at first. He watched as one of those onions walked dragging a rudimentary shovel made of bones. Upon noticing his presence, it turned its bulbous face and emitted a shrill, vegetal screech. Soon, dozens more emerged from the roots, all with the same hollow gaze. They were chasing him.

He ran without knowing where, until he stumbled upon a field... or what was left of one. Dozens of people were buried up to their necks. Their faces, covered in dried mud, had a vacant look. Some were still moaning, but others were already corpses. Onions were passed between them, cutting pieces of skin from their faces with tools made of thorns and rusty blades. They tore out one's eye, another's tongue. Each piece was delicately placed in baskets woven from human sinew.

Humans were not slaves. They were crops.

Mateo vomited. He understood at that moment that this place was not new. It was old. Preexisting. Humans were not the dominant species here. They never were. We only visit the surface... while below, Cépula grows.

He hid among dry roots, trying to hold his breath. It was then that he heard two humanoid onions conversing in a strange language, which he could somehow understand. They were talking about portals. That the earth's crust was weakening. That the hunger was unbearable. That they had to expand to the surface… before their crop died.

A word was repeated like a sickly echo: Cépula. The Great Mother. The supreme root. The Queen of the deep.

Mateo knew then that he had to escape. Not for him, but for everyone else. If Cepula ascended, there would be no war. There would be no resistance. We would be sown, softened, cultivated.

In his escape, Mateo found another living human, a girl named Aina, about twelve years old. It had been there for weeks, hidden in the gaps between the fields of human crops. His mother was in the field, already without eyes. Aina knew the tunnels, the routes that the onions used to transport “fertilizer” and the secret entrances to the central nest: the Greater Bulb.

There, deep within, rested Cepula, a being the size of a house, with a crown of rotting stems and a decomposing human face that seemed to change shape every second. He slept, but he spoke in his sleep, and his voice made the ears bleed.

Mateo and Aina devised a desperate plan: set fire to the Greater Bulb with torches made of human fat and dried roots. The fire wouldn't kill Cepula, but maybe it would close the portal... for now.

They managed to do it. The fire lit, and as the maze filled with smoke and screams, they ran towards the exit. Aina stumbled. Mateo couldn't carry her. She looked at him and said with frightening calm: "You have to tell them. Tell them this is not over."

Mateo emerged to the surface covered in mud and blood. Nobody believed his story. They said it was a hallucination due to the blow, that he had been missing for three days in a ravine. But since then, in his field, the onions began to grow... on their own. And every night, I heard whispers coming from the ground.

Cepula had tasted the human world. And he was hungry.
