It started late at night, I can clearly remember.

Pam was already drifting off as we talked about how loud the music was at the concert we'd been to. 

After all these years of metal concerts, we agreed things have been definitely louder this time. Hell, we were even discussing getting earplugs for the next one. 

The Airbnb we'd picked for the night was close to the venue, but in a pretty sketchy area. One of those old buildings with long hallways and thin walls where you can hear everything your neighbors are doing.

We were lying in bed, and just when I thought we'd talked ourselves to sleep after all that random rambling, the first scream came.

I was almost asleep when I heard it:

**"HEEELP ME PLEEEEEEASE!"**

The high-pitched cry was distant but clear enough that it jerked me awake. 

It sounded like someone sobbing while they screamed, like pure desperation mixed with terror.

It seemed to be coming from somewhere outside the building, maybe from the street below. But it was hard to tell with these old walls and the way sound carried through the hallways.

"What was that?" I asked, hoping Pam was still awake.

"Hmm?" she mumbled, rolling over to face me.

"Did you hear that?"

She was quiet for a moment, listening. "Sounded like 'help me please' maybe?"

My heart started beating faster. It was 2:58 AM according to the nightstand clock. Who the hell would be screaming for help at this hour?

"That's weird, right?" I said.

"I mean, yeah, but..." Pam shrugged, though I could see she was more awake now. "This isn't exactly the nicest neighborhood. There's probably homeless people around, who knows?"

That made sense. The area around the venue wasn't terrible, but it wasn't great either. Lots of dive bars, some sketchy motels, the kind of place where you might expect to hear someone having a rough night. 

Still, something about the voice bothered me. It sounded so desperate.

We lay there in silence for a few minutes. I was starting to think maybe it was just a one-off thing when it happened again.

**"HEEEEEEEEEELP!"**

This time it was definitely closer. Not from the street, but from somewhere inside the building. Maybe the floor below us, or down the hallway. The sound seemed to bounce off the walls in a way that made it hard to pinpoint exactly where it was coming from.

"Okay, what the fuck was that?" I said, sitting up in bed.

"It was definitely closer this time," Pam said. I could feel her tense up beside me. "That sounded like it came from inside the building."

"That's messed up." My heart was really pounding now, but I tried to keep my voice steady. I didn't want to freak out Pam, and honestly, I didn't want to admit how scared I was getting.

"This kind of thing happens sometimes in my neighborhood," Pam said, though her voice didn't sound as confident as her words. "You know, people having episodes, or just drunk hobos”.

I wanted to believe her, but something felt off. The way the voice echoed, the desperation in it. It didn't sound like a normal argument or someone just being loud.

It sounded like genuine terror.

We both lay there listening, but everything was quiet again. Just the occasional sound of a car passing by outside, and the building settling around us. 

We both lay there listening, but everything was quiet again. Just the occasional sound of a car passing by outside, and the building settling around us. Old buildings make a lot of noise, I told myself. Pipes creaking, floors shifting. Nothing unusual about that.

I was starting to relax when I heard the third voice.

**"HEEERE"**

It wasn't a scream this time. It was barely a whisper, but somehow it echoed inside my head like it was being shouted through a megaphone. The word felt loud, impossibly loud, even though I could tell it was spoken quietly.

This time I shot straight up in bed, my eyes wide open. That hadn't come from the hallway or another room. 

That had come from inside our room. 

From the corner, near the little kitchenette.

"Did, you -ahem- did you hear that?" I stammered.

Pam didn't answer, but I could feel her sitting up beside me.

I reached for the light switch on the wall behind the bed, fumbling in the dark. I flicked it up and down several times, but nothing happened. Of course the fucking lights weren't working.

"Shit," I muttered, reaching for my phone on the nightstand. My hands were shaking as I felt around for it, knocking over my Kindle and almost sending my water bottle crashing to the floor. 

Where the hell was my phone?

That's when I heard it. A whisper, so quiet I almost missed it.

**"HEEEEELP ME."**

The voice was raspy, like someone who'd been screaming for hours until their throat was raw. But it wasn't coming from outside anymore, or from the hallway. 

It was coming from the corner of our room, maybe ten feet away from where we were sitting on the bed.

My blood went cold. 

Someone was in here. 

*With us.*

I finally found my phone and fumbled with the flashlight. My hands were shaking so badly I could barely hold it steady, but when the light came on, I saw something that made my stomach drop.

There was a dark shape in the corner. 

Tall, but hunched over, standing perfectly still. 

I couldn't make out any details, just a human-shaped shadow that seemed to absorb the light from my phone rather than reflect it.

I wanted to scream, to run, to do something, but I couldn't move. My whole body felt frozen, like if I made even the slightest noise, whatever was standing there would notice me. 

My heart was beating so loud I was sure it could hear it.

The shape started to move. Slowly.

It felt as if time was being suspended, but also flying by, but also running out.

I turned my head slightly to look at Pam, desperate to see if she was seeing this too, if she had any idea what we should do.

What I saw made everything worse.

Pam was sitting up in bed, but her body was facing away from me while her head was turned toward me at an impossible angle. 

Like someone had grabbed her head and twisted it around without moving her shoulders. Her eyes were wide open, but they weren't her normal brown eyes. 

They were white. Completely white, like someone had painted over them.

The only thing I could see clearly in the darkness were those horrible white eyes, staring right at me.

Then her mouth started to open. Slowly, wider and wider, until her jaw was hanging open further than any human mouth should be able to go. 

The white glow from her eyes cast just enough light for me to see into her mouth, and it looked like it went on forever. 

Just darkness stretching back into nothing.

Then everything went black.

When I woke up, it was morning. I could hear traffic outside. Normal sounds, normal light. 

I sat up in bed, my head pounding like I had the worst hangover of my life.

Pam was already awake, sitting on the edge of the bed with her back to me, brushing her hair.

"My hair is such a mess," she said without turning around. "You were talking in your sleep all night. Bad dreams?"

"I... yeah, I guess," I said. My throat felt raw, like I'd been screaming. "I had this really weird nightmare."

"Must have been some nightmare," she said, still not turning around. "You kept saying 'help me' over and over. But the weird thing is..."

She finally turned to face me, and her eyes were completely white again.

"I wasn't asleep [either](https://www.instagram.com/the._undying/)."
