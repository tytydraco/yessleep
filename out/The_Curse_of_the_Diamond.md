The summer had come, and with it, our annual beer softball league. For the past three years, I had been part of the "Boozers and Bruisers," a team more focused on drinking between innings than winning games. The games were always played at the old Crescent Hollow Field, a run-down diamond on the edge of town surrounded by dense woods. The field had a reputation—it was said to be cursed. Everyone laughed it off, but there was always something unsettling about the place.

The first time I heard about the curse was from Pete, our team’s self-appointed coach and beer supplier. “They say the old Crescent Hollow Field used to be a burial ground,” he said, cracking open a can of cheap lager. “Back in the 1800s, they built the field right on top of it. Some kind of mass grave. The spirits of the dead are supposed to haunt the place.” He took a long swig of beer and chuckled. “Just a spooky campfire story to scare people away.”

The league started like any other year: sloppy throws, fumbled catches, and plenty of beer-fueled banter. But something felt off this season. The air around the field was heavier than usual, and the woods seemed darker. Even on the sunniest days, shadows stretched long across the diamond, as if the trees were trying to creep closer.

Our first few games were uneventful, though we noticed some strange occurrences. Foul balls would disappear into the woods, never to be found. Players swore they heard whispering voices when they stepped up to bat. And then there was the scoreboard. No matter how often we reset it, the numbers would sometimes flicker and change on their own, showing scores that no one had made.

By midseason, the uneasiness started to take its toll. Mitch, our left fielder, quit the league after claiming he saw a face in the woods staring at him. “It wasn’t human,” he muttered before driving off, leaving his glove and cooler behind. We all laughed it off, but I noticed how quickly Pete grabbed another beer and changed the subject.

The turning point came during our game against the "Homerun Hooligans," the league’s reigning champs. It was a cool Friday night, the kind where the air feels charged. A thick fog rolled in just before the game started, and the field lights buzzed louder than usual.

In the bottom of the third inning, one of their players hit a deep fly ball into right field. Our teammate Sam sprinted after it, disappearing into the fog near the woods. We heard him yell, but the ball never came back into play. When we ran out to check, Sam was gone. His glove lay in the dirt, and the only sign of him was a single trail of footsteps leading into the woods.

We called his name, but the woods were silent. Eventually, Pete decided to call the cops, but when they arrived, they found nothing. No Sam, no trail—just a misty field and a bunch of confused, half-drunk softball players.

Sam’s disappearance shook the league. Some teams dropped out entirely, but Pete insisted we keep playing. “We owe it to Sam,” he said, though I suspected he just didn’t want to lose his excuse to drink in the summer.

The next game was worse.

We were playing under the dim field lights, the fog thicker than ever. In the second inning, our pitcher, Karen, threw a perfect strike. Or at least it should’ve been. The ball stopped mid-air—just stopped—before falling straight down to the dirt. Karen stared at it, wide-eyed, before muttering something about the shadows moving. She refused to pitch another inning and spent the rest of the game sitting on the bench, clutching her beer like a lifeline.

Then there was Pete. During the fourth inning, he was at third base, shouting at the batter like he always did. But mid-sentence, he froze, his eyes fixed on something just beyond the edge of the woods. “Hey, Pete, you good?” someone called, but he didn’t answer. He just stood there, staring, until the batter hit a grounder his way. Pete didn’t move to catch it. Instead, he dropped to his knees and started whispering under his breath, like he was praying—or begging.

We all rushed over to him, but Pete was gone mentally. His eyes were glassy, and his lips trembled as he repeated the same phrase over and over: “They’re here. They’re here. They’re here.” We dragged him off the field, and he didn’t come back the next week—or ever.

With every game, more players dropped out, either too scared or too disturbed to continue. Those of us who remained started noticing things, too. Shadows that didn’t belong to any player. Cold spots on the field, even in the heat of July. And then there were the voices. At first, they were faint, like a soft breeze through the trees. But by the end of the season, they were loud, angry, and unmistakable.

The league championship game was supposed to be a big event, but only two teams showed up: us and the "Dead Ringers," a team whose name now felt ominously fitting. The fog was the thickest I’d ever seen, and the field lights flickered like dying candles.

We started the game with just six players, barely enough to form a team. By the fourth inning, we were down to four. Lisa, our shortstop, claimed she saw hands reaching out of the dirt and refused to play another inning. Ben, our catcher, ran screaming into the parking lot after a foul tip landed near home plate and burst into flames.

By the seventh inning, it was just me and Dave, our center fielder. The score was tied, and the Dead Ringers were up to bat. Their batter hit a slow grounder to me at third base. I scooped it up and threw it to first, but as the ball left my hand, it curved in the air, like it had a mind of its own. It sailed over Dave’s head and into the woods.

That’s when I saw them—the spirits. Dozens of them, rising from the woods and the field itself. Their faces were pale and gaunt, their eyes black pits of nothingness. They moved toward us, their mouths opening in silent screams. I froze, unable to move, until Dave grabbed my arm and yanked me toward the parking lot.

We didn’t look back as we ran. The fog seemed alive, clawing at us as we stumbled to our cars. I don’t remember much after that, just the sound of whispers and the feeling of something cold brushing against my neck.

The league disbanded after that. Crescent Hollow Field was abandoned, left to rot under the weight of its curse. I haven’t played softball since, but sometimes, late at night, I hear the sound of a bat hitting a ball, followed by the faintest echo of laughter—coming from the woods near my house.
