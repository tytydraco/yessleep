&#x200B;

I was desperately trying to scrub blood out of a microfiber cloth when I got Eli's call. 

"City morgue, you stab em', I slab em'," I answered.

"Ha, ha, ha. Very funny," his rumbling voice answered, but I heard a smile in his voice. 

"What can I do ya for, boss?"

"I've got another job for you today."

"Okay, well, I've got the Locke job scheduled for 2, and it's 12 now, so I'll have to swing by after."

"Actually, I just need you to guard something for me for a few hours."

"Damnit Jim, I'm a technician, not security detail," I quipped back, knowing full well I was going to end up looking after whatever it was. I just hoped I would stay in this dimension this time. 

"My name isn't Jim," he answered, puzzled. 

"Yeah, it's from Star Trek. You've never seen Star Trek?" I was in disbelief. 

"No, who are they?"

I laughed, "Nevermind. Okay, what is it and who am I protecting it from?"

"You'll see soon enough and mostly from itself," he said with that smile in his voice having transformed into a smirk.

"Damnit, Eli, you can't expect me to keep working these weird ass cases for you without giving me any information. I haven't forgiven you for that Keith Kline fiasco. I still have invincible black goo on my duffel and I had to throw out all the clothes I was wearing," I cut my tirade short when I realized he'd hung up. 

I sighed, pulling the phone away from my ear, when I saw a flash of movement to my right. I jerked my head in the direction of the flash and my vision was suddenly filled with a round, grinning face. 

"Eeeeaaagh!" I yelled, gracefully. 

He was leaned on both arms on the arm of the couch, a small brown boy wearing a striped shirt and green cordoroy pants. In response to my jolted scream, he returned a toothy smile and shook his curly raven coils out of his face. 

I blinked dumbly at him for a moment before sputtering, "How'd you get in here, kid?"

"Oh, I can tele-hop. That's my trait. I got it when I was 7. That's early for my people." He leaned that grinning face on one hand, swaying his hips around as kids that age are prone to do.

"Tele-hop?" I squeaked. I'd backed away from him, scrunched onto one side of the couch, holding a pillow in front of me as the ultimate defense.

"Tele...uh...Tele something. I forget what you guys call it," he plopped onto the couch next to me, "I can move instantly, like right away, ya know?"

I nodded, my mouth not having shut in 45 seconds. 

"Okay, uh. What, uh, are you doing here?" I finally sputtered. I've got some very basic warding around the house shown to me by a witch I helped out once. Whatever this kid was had to be more powerful than your average house witch. 

"Uncle Eli told me to come over," he was now kicking his legs against the couch, picking at the lining of the arm. 

I groaned softly, dropping my head in realization. This was the asset he was talking about. This was what he wanted me to look after? I skimmed a glance over the kid. He was probably 4 foot something, maybe 9, 10 years old? His bouncy black curls fell into his face, framing it's cherub shape. 

"You're his...nephew?"

The kid glanced down and back up. 

"Oh, you're wondering why he's like a tan color and I'm like this brownish one?," he continued at my nod, "When we get our vessel, we don't really think about the color, so we mismatch a lot of the time."

I'd settled, putting aside my combat pillow.

"Vessel?" I asked.

He gave me a slightly baleful look from under his curls, and a mischievous smile. 

"Uncle Eli said you'd have a lot of questions but that your brain is too small and I'd explode it, so I better keep my hole shut,"

I digested that for a moment, unsurprised that Eli was boxing me out of any useful information once again.

"Okay, kid, what's your name?"

"Nathan," he turned then to look at me with piercing almond eyes, "Is there anything fun to do around here?"

My head spun with horrible ideas of what a small powerful creature such as this would find fun to do with his 'vessel'. 

"Uh, I've got monopoly," I said weakly.

Nathan pouted, sinking into his seat.

"Those pieces are gross. They just taste like plastic."

"Well, you're not supposed to eat them, Squirt," the corners of my lips quirked up, watching him cock his head onto his shoulder and whine. He was just another kid. 

He smiled, and his eyes lit to a bright green.

"Whoa, color changing eyes. That's new," I ducked my head to get a better look into his emerald irises. 

"I like that. No one's ever given me a nickname, before," he was smiling and I saw a missing tooth on the left of his two oversized front ones. My heart melted a bit. Supernatural abomination or not, this kid was cute. 

"Okay, Squirt. Here's what we're gonna do. I've got a crisp 20 here, we're going to go to the dollar store and load up a cart, then you're going to come back here and play at Auntie Pipers so I can go do another job for your uncle."

"Uncle said your name was Witches?" he cocked his head in confusion.

"Well, he likes to give out nicknames of his own," I scowled, "I'm non-binary, do you know what that means?"

"Nope."

"It just means I don't particularly feel like a boy or a girl. Your uncle Eli is, uh, a little confused about this, so he calls me witches as a joke. Like I'm two people. It's a bad joke," I scowled as I finished my lame explanation. 

"So, he's making fun of you?" he frowned at this.

"No, when you're friends with someone, sometimes they try to rib you, to poke fun at you. It's sort of like a bonding thing?" I thought for a moment, then sighed, "Or maybe he is making fun of me, honestly I'm not sure. Let's go get some water pistols, Squirt."

We had a blast at the store, picking out colorful bouncing balls, water guns, a yo-yo, a little sandcastle kit even though we were nowhere near the beach, and a hula hoop. We also picked up a couple Lego kits I hoped would keep him busy until I returned. 

We returned to the apartment and dumped our haul on the coffee table, spreading out the colorful array of treasures.

"Okay, Squirt," I glanced at my watch, "it's a quarter after one. I'm heading out but I'll be back in a couple hours. Promise me you won't leave this apartment and remember that I have demon blades that will kill anything," I wasn't totally sure where they were, but for children, the threat was more effective than the punishment, "I will carve fluffy unicorns into your forehead and then everyone will make fun of you. K?"

He grinned up at me and nodded his head. 

"For the record, though, I like unicorns. They smell nice."

I let that one go. I figured I might be able to squeeze one or two more nuggets of information out of this kid by the end of the day, and I didn't want to waste a question on unicorns. I just nodded, blew out a breath, and swept my bag up on the way out the door. 

"My number is on the table, call me if anything happens, okay?" I called as the door clicked behind me. I turned around and flinched.

"eeeaaaaghhhh!" I repeated.

Nathan was standing right in front of me on the sidewalk. 

"You've gotta stop doing that," I complained on an outward breath.

"Uncle Eli told me I had to stay with you."

I sighed, looking him up and down. At the end of the day, he was just a kid and he was trying to follow the rules.

"Okay, bud. Go grab some toys."

On the way, we talked some more about what he liked to do. Apparently he was a big fan of baseball cards and also of talking to lizards. I asked if he could understand them and he looked at me like I was an idiot, so I just chuckled and let it go. He also likes to grow flowers and talk to them as well. I kept all stupid questions to myself that time and just told him my mom also grew a lot of plants. We made plans for him to visit her so they could trade green thumb secrets.

We arrived at Loche Mechanics headquarters at a quarter til 2. My contacts name was Connie Loche, and she met us in the lobby in a prim pink dress, chunky gold earrings decorating her pointed ears. 

"Welcome to Loche Mechanics. May I have your name?" she asked. Her voice was deep and rich, a contrast to her elegant frame. 

"You can call me Piper," I said with a smile. 

"And I'm-"

"And you can call him Nathan," I quickly cut him off. 

He gave me the side-eyed look children give adults when they think they're treating them like children. I nudged him sharply and gave him what I hoped was a good imitation of the look my mom gave me when she needed to discreetly tell me to shut the fuck up. 

Connie's head cocked, and she seemed to look me up and down anew. 

"I'm here to look at your printer situation. Eli sent me."

"Oh, wonderful. It's right this way, Ms. Piper and Mr. Nathan," she gave Nathan a kind smile and turned on her heel, leading us back through the hallways to the main cubicle farm. 

"Oh, she's not a miss, she's a non-binary," Nathan stated confidently.

"How interesting," Connie replied, her pink tinged smile curving up at the corners. 

I sent Nathan another of my mom looks.

"Ms. is fine, it's no biggie to me," I smiled and she continued leading us through the office.

Everything was a shade of beige here, from the walls to the floors to the decorations. The spare artwork or slapstick mug gave a small splatter of color to the room, underneath the harsh fluorescent lights.

As we plodded down Grey hallways, Nathan bouncing along beside me with his hand adorably clinging to my back pocket, I wondered about why Eli would send me here. It seemed human to me. Somewhat dull, but aren't all offices? We passed rooms with bloated, Grey-haired businessmen and women in spazzy business suits sporting reserved versions of popular hairstyles. 

Connie excused herself once we got to the machine, simply saying 'This is our only means of printing. We must have it back up immediately,' before turning and striding smoothly into a corner office nearby. 

"This must be really important," Nathan said, eyeing the machine.

"Here's a trade secret, bud," I whispered, "they all say that about any issue they ever have."

I winked, he grinned, and I popped the top off the machine. I ran my finger along the edge and came back up with a blue smudge. Why were all my tickets resulting in goop these days?

Wiping the goo off on my pants, I quarter turned to continue whispering to Nathan. 

"Also, you always want to say 'You can call me Nathan'. Names have power, or so they say," I half-smiled, feeling goofy talking voodoo in a big corporate office, "They say if you give someone your name, it gives them power over you. Me? I'm a wuss, so I'm not taking any chances."

"A wise choice."

The voice just about scared me out of my pants. What is that instinct that causes us to jump straight in the air? How is it helpful for survival? It just makes running take longer.

Or turning, in my case. I swiveled around and my head fell straight back as I gaped open mouthed at the being in front of us. I glanced briefly at Nathan and saw his mouth shaped in a perfect O. 

He stood maybe 5'7, wearing a crisp white button up, beige slacks, and shiny black shoes. But I assume Nathan was reacting more to the monstrously large inky black shadow engulfing the man. The man was aflame with onyx vapor, waving in the AC unit blowing down from the ceiling. 

Now and then a purple or blue puff would float from his body and be instantly engulfed by the shadow. 

He was smiling. His hand was out, and I regarded it with care. I should have known Eli would never send me to a human office. If I shook his hand, was I agreeing to some kind of deal? If I refused, was I offending this being? Did the human even know the tar monster was attached to him, some kind of symbiotic demon deal? Or was this some kind of dark matter monster sucking the energy out of this poor, boring human? 

I was near panicking, trying to remember anything like this in my experiences. Dread poured off of this thing, weighing me down like being drenched on a humid day. I felt sweat instantly bead on my forehead and I wiped my damp palms on my pants. My pants were not fairing well out of this experience.

He laughed, an off putting high pitched squeal. Orange light flew off of his body and flooded into the fog and it squirmed around. Happily? I can barely read human social signals, don't ask me to interpret the cloud.

"I'm called Arnie. It's not often I meet a human who knows the law of faerie but given who you're with, I can hardly be surprised," he smiled down at Nathan, and Nathan moved closer to me. 

Arnie's tone was friendly, but Nathan's response raised my hackles. I always trust kids' reactions, they're notoriously bad liars. 

"You can call me Piper. Is there something I can do for you?" I asked sweetly, pulling Nathan a bit more behind me and deciding to forego the handshake. 

I had never seen anything close to this cloud. For all I knew, I could be agreeing to sell Nathan to him and Nathan's safety was more important than mine. If I let anything happen to him, Eli'd kill me anyways. Plus, look at the kids goofy face? C'mon.

"Oh, I was just saying hello. Not often you meet royalty, after all," his smile was sour, sly, and I no longer wondered if they were merged. The look on the man's face was vile and worse, practiced. I doubted the cloud was making him make it, but I didn't care, I wanted this guy gone. 

In the best case scenario where he wasn't a threat, he was pulling attention to us. Several heads swayed from their computer screens to our direction. I immediately knew this man was not the only anomoly in here and that we did NOT want the attention of more of them. 

"Well, as soon as we get this guy up and running, we'll be out of your hair," my smile was sweet and my voice was light, "Have a good one," I said the last dismissively before turning around.

I started explaining boring printer basics to Nathan, tinkering in the printer as I wiped the sweat from my face with my shoulder. I was really hoping just ignoring this thing would make it go away. It seemed to be feeding on the guys emotions, right? So, maybe if we just starved it of attention, it would go away? Regardless, I wanted to minimize the scene. Nothing happening here, folks.

Nathan had made himself small, flicking glances behind me as I squatted to dig around in my duffel. 

"Hey bud, wanna hear a joke?" I tugged on his shirt sleeve.

His glance flicked to mine and I smiled goofily. 

"Why," I began conspiratorily, trying to ignore my drenched face and the darkness around us that just seemed to be getting deeper, "don't eggs tell jokes?"

He shrugged and I gave him an obvious look and said, "Because, Squirt, they'd crack each other up."

I poked his chest as I finished the punch line, and he giggled. And just like that, it was like the sun came out. All the heat I hadn't noticed gathering around us dissipated and out of the corner of my eye, I saw Arnie striding back down the hall with his hands in his pockets. 

I clapped a hand on Nathan's shoulder and blew out a breath. 

"Looks like we got away with it, champ," I was still grinning, this time with relief. 

After I cleaned the printer off, I started it up and it began printing. It was a laser printer, so I had no idea where that blue smudge was coming from, but after our close call with Arnie, I wanted to skedaddle. 

Connie walked back up just then and smiled at the printer. 

"Oh, wonderful. Thank you very much, Piper. What a disaster that would have been," she laughed musically. 

I smiled. Every client thinks the worst disaster that can happen is productivity going down for 10 minutes. 

"No worries. Now we'll get out of your-" I cut myself off as I glanced around, noting that every one of the people had now risen. 

Black clouds surrounded us, waving irritably to and fro. They took one coordinated step towards us and I snatched my duffel with one hand and the collar of the boy with the other. 

But it was too late, I saw. The exits were covered with people, surrounded by dark splotchy galaxy clouds of dread filing in from every door. 

They marched in sync towards us, filling the space with beige bodies soaked in ink black smoke.

I bent down and whispered in Nathan's ear.

"Remember your tele-hop, Squirt? I need you to use it to get out of here."

"I can't tele-hop you, Piper!" his voice was high and panicked, and I put a hand on his shoulder, flicking an anxious glance at the angry clouds closest to us. 

"Dude, I've come out of worse, I swear to you, I'll be fine, but if anything happens to you, your uncle will turn me into a kebab, okay? GO," I said the last forcefully, not having any direction in general to push him so just shaking him by the collar.

"But-"

"NOW." I said in the absolute sternest mother voice I could possibly muster, the kind that shakes the lapels and inspires the fear of God. 

His eyes grew enourmous, his bottom lip quivered, and he teared up. 

"I can't!" he cried, "It goes on and off, I have to be calm, and I'm too afraid! I'm sorry!" he was sobbing now and I swore, which is not a great reaction but it was all I had. 

I clutched him close to me and turned towards Connie, who was just smiling, arms crossed. 

"Folks, is there any way we could talk about thi-eeeaaaaghh!" I said for the third time that day, forming what I saw to be a troubling pattern. 

This time it was in response to a much smaller, high-pitched wail from a dark blue creature that was rising off of the finished print from the printer. It ripped it's way into three dimensions, pulling itself up from the paper, leaving tendrils of purple slime in it's wake.

It was like overgrown grapes, bulbous pieces sticking out at odd angles. It had a mouth, which it was currently using for screaming, but I didn't see any other parts. 

In response to the tiny wails, every head in the office snapped towards it, and one by one, each worker began lining up behind the printer. 

Arnie was at the front of the line and snatched the little goblin from the paper and promptly popped it into his rapidly unhinged jaw. The printer repeated this process, Nathan and I flinching at every step, printing a screaming violet monster that then was consumed by one of the monstrous cloud people around us. 

After a few printed snacks, Arnie walked back up to us, this time his aura a pure beige, being fed by droplets of just about every color in the rainbow emanating from his human body.

"Apologies for earlier, mate. I get really hangry," he chuckled heartily and strolled off. 

Nathan and I looked at each other and snorted, covering our mouths. 

"This is the worst snickers commercial ever," he said. 

I burst out laughing, pulling the attention of the few workers still straggling around. 

"First of all, great reference. We're going to have to explore which pop culture you guys know about and which you don't," I grabbed his hand, "For now, let's get the hell out of here."

We got back in the truck, looked at each other and laughed for 5 minutes. I think it was largely drunken relief to still have our lives and souls. 

On the way back, we stopped for milkshakes and fries, and Nathan promised not to tell his uncle I almost got him killed. 

"Thanks for taking me with you, Piper. I had fun," his goofy smile was smeared in strawberry ice cream and I grinned at the image he made. 

Then he sneezed and a burst of fire spat out, landing on my jacket sleeve and catching it on fire. I refused to add one more to my scream counter for the day so I silently stamped it out on the table before turning up to look at Nathan's face and bursting out laughing. He looked more panicked than he had when he'd almost been eaten.

"That's the first time you did that, huh?" I asked, brushing embers off my sleeve.

"Puberty is...weird. for us," he said sheepishly, his gaze locked in his lap now, "I don't really know what my powers are going to be. Sorry."

I laughed. 

"Puberty is weird for all of us, man. I wish I could have traded a problem with you," I nudged him, grinning evilly, "Some of the girls I went to high school with could have used a good singe."

He giggled, seeming to straighten a bit in his chair, and I was glad I played it down. I was dying to ask about the whole royalty comment but he looked so fragile. I decided to let sleeping demons lie. 

"Now, what do you say we go beat up your uncle?"

His head bobbed up and down as he beamed, happily shoveling in his last glob of ice cream.
