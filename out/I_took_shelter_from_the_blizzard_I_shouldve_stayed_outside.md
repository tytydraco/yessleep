I only wanted warmth and shelter; what I found in their basement still haunts me.



I wasn’t sure I would survive. The storm hit harder than anything I’d seen before. 



I tried to get out my satellite phone, but my fingers couldn’t press the buttons.



Every step felt harder. Fingers and toes didn’t hurt anymore; they just felt numb.



Then, like a beacon, I saw an outline of a house. 



I knocked on the door, barely able to clench my fist. An old woman came out and quickly rushed me in.



My whole world felt like a blur. When they took the gloves off, my fingers had started to turn white. 



“You almost lost your fingers!” the old woman said.



The heat from the fireplace felt like stabs to my hands and feet, but I reluctantly warmed myself up.



They said they hadn’t seen a storm as bad as this one in years. I was lucky to find their house.



Their house smelled of cooked meat, making my body shiver with excitement.



The old couple was nice enough to let me eat with them.



The steak tasted like beef mixed with pork. It had a soft texture with a delicious, sweet taste.



“How do you like your steak, sweetheart?” the old woman asked.



“The steak is delicious. What did you season it with?” I returned the question.



“Only salt and pepper, nothing else.” She replied.



They both laughed and looked at each other. The man then stared me up and down and got back to his dinner.



After the meal, I finally regained my senses. The place seemed stranger than I thought at first. 



Their house was a mess. Trash and old equipment were scattered all around. 



In the next room, there were splatters of yellow and dark red liquid on the walls.



“You should stay the night, mister. The storm will rage on. If you don’t want to almost die again.” The old man said sternly. 



I didn’t like this place, but it was better than the instant death that was awaiting outside.



They let me sleep on the couch next to the fireplace. The old woman brought me a blanket and sat next to me. Her eyes were staring me down just like her husband did.



“Are you okay lying on the couch here, sweetie? she asked.



“Yes, thank you for all the hospitality,” I replied.



She then started rubbing my back and shoulder. This soon turned into squeezing and feeling my muscles around. I scooted away from her.



“You must’ve walked a long way. You poor thing,” she said.



I laughed nervously and thanked her.



That night, I woke up to strange sounds coming from the basement. 



The more I listened, the more I realized it sounded like muffled screams. 



I looked out the window, and the storm was now worse than when I first stumbled in.



I pulled a small knife from my backpack and lay on the couch, clutching it. 



The muffling grew louder.



I couldn’t take it anymore. I had to help anyone or anything trapped down there.



The floorboards creaked under my steps. My heart was beating so hard I could hear it. 



I put my hand on the door handle and hesitated for a while. 



Every sense in my body was screaming to ignore the sounds, but I couldn’t. I never ignored another human’s cries for help, and this cabin was not going to make me act any differently.



I slowly opened the door. The room was dark and cold.



I walked down the steps, searching for a light switch.



My hand ran over something. I pressed it. 



There were four mattresses, black and filthy with cockroaches crawling around them. 



Each mattress had a person lying on it, with one or both hands chained to the wall. They had rags on instead of clothing, unwashed with dry blood on them.  Their eyes were wide with terror, and their mouths duct-taped.



There were three men and one woman. Each of them was missing at least one limb. Most of them had both of their legs cut off, but one man in the very back was missing both legs and an arm. He was the one screaming the least, looking like he was in a trance.



As I walked down, the smell of the room turned slightly sour, almost coppery. The nausea was growing. I couldn’t stand the sight of this horror. My body started to gag, and I threw up my dinner all over the wooden steps. 



I slowly stumbled back up the steps. The floorboards creaked above me.



Then I felt a quick, sharp pinch in my neck. 



I turned around. Behind me, the old couple stood on the steps flashing the same grin they had at the dinner table.



I tried to walk towards the man, but my legs wouldn’t move, my fist let go of the knife, and I slowly lost consciousness.



I woke up on a mattress with cockroaches crawling over my body. I tried to shake myself around to get the bugs off. 



My mouth was duct-taped, and all I could make out were the same muffling sounds as the others imprisoned.



Before going down to the basement, I managed to send my location and concerns to one of my friends, an officer a few towns away, but I forgot to check if the message came through.



I heard the old woman humming upstairs. The door opened. A flashlight shone down the steps.



“How’s our new friend settled in?” I heard her say in her sweet voice.



I tried to get out of the chains, but they were tight around my wrists. 



Her steps were slowly approaching, and the flashlight blinded me.



Then I heard the faint sound of engines. I prayed it wasn’t just the storm playing tricks on me.



A siren echoed in the distance.



I heard footsteps running up the stairs. The basement fell into darkness again.



They found me before the old couple came down with their tools.



I gave my report at the hospital.



The officers informed me that they only found the woman. The man is still out there.
