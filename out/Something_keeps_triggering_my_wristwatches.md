I'm fed up, one year since I bought those damn wristwatches and for some reason they keep turning on in the middle of the night.

I have sleep problems, I admit it, living next to an avenue, with annoying and noisy neighbors doesn't help much. Sometimes even the dogs and cats agree to disturb my sleep in the wee hours of the morning. But if there's one thing that gets on my nerves, it's those damn wristwatches.

They've been a repeated but widely spaced problem for a while now. And today it happened again. After not being able to sleep because of a stuffy nose and having to get up to prepare hot water to deflate my nostrils, I went back to bed relieved because I could finally breathe naturally enough to sleep.

Until the tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick of the second hand of a clock began to sound. As soon as I heard the sound I knew what it was, it was one of those damn wristwatches I had bought in a package in an attempt to try to dress better and look more formal, following those social media tips about wearing “accessories”.

I started to look in my desk drawer, but the sound is lost as soon as you get out of bed, it is as if it was hiding and waiting just the moment you go to bed to start playing. And when I kept quiet again it sounded as if it was in the bookcase, but when I went to look for the bookcase again the sound became imperceptible. I lay down on the bed, turned off the light and nothing was heard until I was about to fall asleep.

Tick... Tick... Tick... Tick... Tick...

I got tense, angry... completely stressed but I didn't move, I listened carefully, the noise was under my bed. I got up and turned on the light, I began to search sharply among the objects in the drawer of my bed until I found it, the damn clock with the ticking second hand and the date wrongly placed for having been off until a few seconds ago.

I didn't want to get crazier than I should, because deep down I knew that that wristwatch shouldn't even be there, I had had the same problem months ago, the wristwatches were activated when I went to bed even when I had just deactivated them. So one night I took all the wristwatches, deactivated them and put them on the desk in my room, turned off the light and went to bed.

It didn't take long when I heard the first, tick, tick, tick, tick. I tried to ignore it, I needed to sleep, even though I knew I had just turned them all off, I could hear the tick, tick, tick, tick, on the desk, but it became impossible when suddenly another one started, and they joined in a symphony of clicks, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick.

So I got up that time, deciding never again to let something like that happen, I deactivated them and put them in a box in a room of unused objects and boxes across the hall.

Now, one of the wristwatches that I had already put in the box had appeared back in my room, in the drawer under my bed. But there wasn't much I could do, I knew that no matter how hard I wondered, how hard I tried to figure out why or how, nothing made sense, even if I tried to block it with plastic, or make sure it couldn't be activated by mistake, even if it was a small movement or tremor, but no, they all seemed well made and of good quality.

I even checked it when I took one of the watches to a watchmaker in the market of my city, who told me he would check it but the next day he said he did not find anything, I tried to pay him but he refused to receive my money since he could not find the problem so he could not charge me for a service he did not give.  
....

So well, I took the wristachwatch that was under my bed back to the storage room, made sure it was deactivated, and put it in the box in the corner of the dusty room, when I opened it there were the other watches, innocent, as if they were spectating ghosts. I put the watch away, made sure it was deactivated and went back to bed.

Turn off the light, close your eyes and take a deep breath.

Not even a few seconds of silence passed when I heard a distant and stifled noise, but more quickly that I would want my ear sharpened and I began to hear it, tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick, it was not only one, I knew again that there were several, I knew it, and I did not understand, they were all deactivated a moment ago and even if they were activated, why today? why today is that I hear them? and not yesterday, nor the day before, nor the day before yesterday, nor the day before that.
