TW: Implied Drug Use/ OD. 

The heat that was concentrated through what felt like the tip of a needle in the center of my forehead grew worse as I slowly climbed my way back to consciousness. The haphazard buildup to consciousness was abruptly ended when I felt its full effect immediately and without warning. What once had been colorful, blurry visions of my immediate past left me harshly, and I was faced with the reality of the present. That being the pitch black 8x8 room I was forced to perceive upon my waking up. Held tightly in my hand, what I later concluded was an old apron, messy. I could feel the mashed food-waste stuck to it in the darkness.

I was laying on a small cot that felt like the back of a police car, though lined with rubber, and this property made itself known by squeaking rather loudly as I shifted. I was undeniably comfortable. However the fact that I woke up in a dark room, and the inclination that I couldn’t remember anything about my life previous to this very moment grabbed my mind viciously. This thought disturbed me enough to rise from my position and ground myself on the cold, metal floor. I felt my face, and realized I had forgotten what I looked like. I tired looking for any comforting sign around the room I was in, and found nothing but darkness- the only exception being a shadow of some object standing tall against the wall opposite me.

The heat I felt in my forehead upon awakening had developed into an awful migraine that was hogging much of my thought process at the time. I felt that I had to cough and spit. The smell of vomit had been invading my nose before I ever had any inclination myself to vomit. Which eventually happened. I felt sick. I felt alone. This did not beat my mind or its thoughts into submission. I managed to stand up and lead myself through the darkness, using the cold metal alloy-paneled wall to guide myself to this object I could just barely make out. My hands brushed up against bolts stuck in the wall, which I assumed connected all the panels the wall had been made out of.

I knew that I was a girl, and upon inspection of myself I found that I was a particularly skinny girl. Perhaps on the side of morbidity. I also knew that the object I now found myself feeling, and leaning against- was a door. A heavy one, with bars bridging a tiny window that I could see through if I stood on my tippy- toes. In the 10 minutes spent since my awakening, my eyes adjusted well enough to the darkness, but unfortunately I could not make out a thing outside of the room I was in. The door was locked. For as small as my frame was, there was no way I could even attempt and bust the lock on the outside, nevertheless I had no tools to do so. I was luckily just able to reach my arm through the bars and feel up the lock. It was a padlock. In the dark I managed to feel out a mechanism of the lock seemingly meant for a numeric code input. I could twist the dial with my thumb but without any visual of the lock itself or a clue to what the code could be, I was out of luck.

My arm got caught on jagged rust that protruded from a bar in this window, which opened me up, just a little bit. I at least, had a solution for this. I quickly made a small bandage made out of my pillowcase. Tied it against my arm, under the medical gown I woke up in. The outfit isn't the most flattering, but I had nothing else, except the apron, which I decided to throw on over the gown just because it was an extra layer of protection. Just in case. This gave me a short reprieve from the truth, that I was practically shitting myself, the reality that I may starve to death in this very room growing larger and larger in my mind. These doomed thoughts seemingly delayed in my mind, but that doesn’t make them any easier to process when they do introduce themselves to me.

Hours of developing, increasingly delusional thought had gone by. I got 60x more desperate with every hour that passed by. My desperation increasing in one minute intervals, the thoughts in my brain wouldn't let up. I’m going to die in this room, emaciated, with no memories of who I am. I thought at least I deserved a memory or two before I died, right? This thought faded. Maybe if I died, my life would flash before my eyes and I would, for just a few seconds, get a slideshow of memories right before I curl up. This thought process lead to my manically trying to break out any way I can, and eventually my painted nails were cracked and my fingertips bloody from trying to rip the metal paneling off the wall. Through silent tears, and the use of my legs, I managed to tear off a small, flexible piece of metal right off the wall, where the bolt met the rest of the panel. I saw no holes in the wall still, but what I did have was something to end my life with, if it came to it.

As I began to feel the shape and edges of this piece of metal I was struck by the first of about three or four revelations I’d be required to have that night. Though I didn’t remember my name, how old I was, nor a thing about my past-- I did remember how to shim a padlock. Instead of a weapon, in my desperation I had made the perfect shim. The implications this gave me about the nature of my past frightened me a bit, however the fear of starving to death overshadowed this curiosity of myself. I was already shaking, thinking of what would happen to me if I wasn’t able to bust this lock.

I waddled silently over to the door. Tippy-toes. Reached my arm through the bar being careful not to get caught again, luckily I could manageably reach the post of the padlock on the other side of the door and maneuver my shim into position. The scrape of metal against the padlock from my positioning of the shim was incredibly loud compared to the complete silence of the building I was in. I moved the shim downwards between the post and body of the lock, I was almost there.

Before I got any results, *truly* loud noises had quickly reintroduced themselves to me for the first time since I woke up. Pounding footsteps, first at fast and steady rhythm yet growing more inconsistent and fumbling as they grew closer. I withdrew my arm from the window once again, and quietly put my back against the door. The footsteps, coming from the left, had rapidly grown more manic as if the person we’re bolting towards my room. Soon, I’m able to distinctively hear a different sound, a bounding sound. A sound of hard leather hitting the ground at an aggressive pace. It seemed to be following or chasing whoever was coming towards my cell. I figured this gave me fair reason to stay quiet.

The footsteps passed by my room and though I wanted to cry out for help, I could hear the groans and inhuman shrieks of whatever the fuck it was that was chasing them. I desperately wanted out, but the sudden horror of hearing what may have been following this person made me think that maybe I should’ve just stayed in that dark room and starved to death after all. I heard it pass by the door and prayed that it didn’t have a good sense of smell, whatever it was. A large crash down what I presumed was a hallway is proceeded by what I thought to be a middle aged man yelling out in pain. I wanted to yell back. I didn’t. I was too scared.

The man crying out in pain down the dark hallway only seemed to arouse whatever was chasing him even more. It snarled, a sound more guttural and just as loud as the cry of a bear. I could tell by simply hearing the sloppy pounding of its footsteps against the floor that it was a large body. I could tell simply by the sound of deluded joy it made when the man yelled, that it was bloodthirsty. The footsteps of the creature made distance from my domain as I then heard a mixture of growls, and the desperate agonizing screams of the man who had seemingly fell in the hallway.

Two gunshots ring out in my ears as I hear a bullet bounce off the wall outside the door- the other had made itself known by sending a shockwave down my spine as it impacted the metal door behind me. Luckily, the door was thick enough. The man fell silent. All I heard was the creature making a faint cooing sound, the crunching of bones into dust, and a steady flow of liquid trickling down to some unknown vestige of this building. That vestige happened to be directly under my door. I notice that my feet were starting to get wet, and I sampled the substance with my tongue and fully recognized it as blood, trickling into my room from right under the threshold. As soon as I came to this realization, I was pulled back to reality by what seemed to be the final, desperate gasps for air left in the man. The way he must have been opening his mouth to draw in air had to have been haunting, it sounded like it. This upset the creature further, and I heard a quick splat that silenced the man indefinitely.

I then curled up, closed my eyes and refused to believe in any mystery or reality these events may have just proposed to me. My heated forehead only raged on like a house fire that had just now reached the point of no return. I could do nothing about the fire and I was burning to death in a house I didn’t recognize. I eventually stopped remotely paying attention to whatever twisted sounds I was hearing and fell into a trance, the main goal of my focused state was to remember who I was. Perhaps I had thought if I could just remember, then it would somehow save me and wish me away to a place I loved in my past.

This only lasted a short time before I pulled myself off the ground and took initiative. I no longer heard any sound outside my room, and I came to the conclusion that I was either getting out of here- or I wasn’t. This time, I had to be careful not to slip on the pooled blood under the door and I reached through the window to attempt to shim the lock once-more. It took me a few minutes of tooling, each scrape I made against the lock the more my worry grew as I dreaded the return of the creature. Eventually, I re-experienced the feeling of relief for the first time since my awakening when my careful maneuvering of the shim finally caused the hasp to release. All I had to do was rotate the body of the padlock clockwise and remove the lock from its hinge. I pulled the lock through the bars and decided to keep it on my person. I threw it in a big pocket on the apron.

I wasted no time in opening the door to get a grasp of what was in front of me, the layout of this building. I made sure that I didn’t make a single sound. In fact, I flinched at even the light screech the door made as it was opening. Though I could see almost nothing but darkness, my adjusted eyes could make out vague shapes of walls and what seemed to be medical equipment littering the place. Otherwise, as I poked around in the dark space, I noticed it was absolutely trashed. Documents I couldn’t read in the dark, empty canisters of gasoline, too much to detail in its entirety. I made sure that I didn’t make a single sound. The air in this building was still working, to which a low hum was heard, although this seemed to only permeate the stench of death throughout the building.

Soon, I felt my way through the dark back to the puddle of blood pooled under my door. From what I could tell it was practically an open floor plan. Not many hallways, not many places to hide unless it was in some sort of room. This alarmed me enough to decide that I needed to get to the gun I had heard the man set off earlier. I followed the trail of blood from my door to his body, using the wet feeling under my feet as a sort of guiding line in the dark. I couldn’t see, so I had to feel my way there.

I was expecting, but not fully prepared for what I saw when I arrived at his body. He was leaned up against the wall, various shelves and a few items of office equipment scattered by his feet, which I imaged is what had tripped him up in the first place. I tried as hard as I could to make out his face in the darkness but I only saw a the malformed expression that only those missing the required amount of flesh on their face may give you. I patted him down for his gun, my hand accidentally slipping into a giant open wound near his stomach. The slippery and morbidly friendly feeling of what I assumed to be his lower intestine suddenly greeted my hand. I quickly withdrew and felt a little bit of it come out with me.

In *only* that specific moment I was thankful that I didn’t have a flashlight. I don’t think I was ready to see the full extent of what happened to this poor man yet. It was disgusting, patting around on him and practically having a play-date in the puddle of blood debris that lay beside him-- but I *had* to find his gun. In the dark my hand slid against the floor and ran into what I felt was a cold, metal handle. Upon further inspection I rejoiced in my head as I cocked the lever of the gun back. I had no clue exactly how a gun works, nor was I even sure if it had any remaining ammo left in the chamber. From what I could tell it was a standard 6-bullet revolver. All I knew how to do was cock the gun and pull the trigger.

To my right, the room I had just come out of. To my left, I could make out a few rooms in the darkness. There where about four rooms next to each other lining the wall running parallel to the wall which my room had been apart of. Upon looking back I notice 3 other rooms next to mine as well. Quite honestly, I don’t think I was expecting to get quite this far. New thoughts rush my mind as I zone out and focus on that room to my left, on the opposite side of this small building. What do I do from here? Where do I go? Are there any bullets left in this gun? How do I make sure? I thought long and hard about the odds of me being able to walk out the front door, and hoped to god there *was* a front door. I decided in my manic thought to go for it.

As soon as I took a step, a long face emerged in the darkness- right in the doorway of the room I had been so desperately staring into just a few seconds ago. It took me a second more to cognize this face, but it was stretched seemingly to the point where it dragged across the floor. The eyes were the only part I could truly make out in the darkness due to the size and positioning about 4 feet off the ground. The rest of the face faded in and out of reality as the darkness decided what parts to obscure and reveal. It was looking at me, and I was looking at it. Though scared myself, I didn’t get a reciprocating feeling from the creature. The longer we stared at each other, the more detail I noticed. I was soon able to almost comprehend the size of the being. It had to be twice the size of a man.

It did nothing. It sit there, staring at me with cold gray eyes and the vague remembrance of what used to be a smile. For minutes the standoff resumed and I decided to *not* take this opportunity to smell the roses, instead I rose my weapon and braced myself to shoot a gun for the first time in my life… Or the first time since I woke up… who knew? I pulled back the trigger to hear a click. My stomach dropped to my toes. The creature didn’t move a muscle, although I heard a playful cry leave its malformed lips. Almost a laugh. It felt almost familiar.

With one final wish I pulled the trigger again- to my surprise the gun shook and a shot rang out before me, reaching the monster which I confirmed by the quick sound of impact on its flesh before it cried out, hurt. I fully expected it to come barreling towards me, but the gunshot was surprisingly effective. The shriek turned into a loud sobbing rhythm that came from the creature as it retreated back into the darkness and uncertainty of its room. As this sound twisted into my ears, the shriek most closely matched one word “Sorry”. I hoped that it had gone to lick its wounds, because I needed more time to figure out how to escape. Although I had no premonitions, something deep within myself told me that I wasn’t going to just walk out the front door.

In these mere seconds of reflection I found myself formulating a short term plan. Standing there in the darkness, a slow intake of breath, the consumption of recycled air spat out by roaring machines in the ceiling above me. The situation I found myself in was almost as overwhelming as the burning sensation that reached out in all directions grabbing at the top of my skull with an aching plasma. By the time I finally exhaled, the silence around me cocooned, and my immediate safety fortified. My plan was ready to be put into action.

Of course, being a plan conceived within the short time it takes for one to complete a full breath (in and out), my thought process was not as fully realized as it could have been. Would you blame me? I was faced with the fact that besides what I’ve witnessed in the dark, I had not a clue the layout of this place. I didn’t know how big this place was. I started navigating in a straight line, slowly. My arms stretched out in front of me wishing to meet another cold wall of the building so it could lead me to some sort of exit- or another room. What my hands were *really* hoping to meet was a light switch.

I tried to avoid my left as much as possible, the creatures awful noise had ceased in its loudness, but even as I moved past its domain with such distance still I heard it sobbing, quiet and embarrassed. If I had more context, I may have been laughing- and filled with confidence that this anomaly, as big as it is, is showing such signs of distress after a simple gunshot wound. I didn’t know if there was another bullet in my chamber or not, but I definitely knew that abomination wasn’t dead yet. This gave me good enough reason to stay quiet--low to the ground along with the rot and the loose sheets of paper and the ripped cloth I felt brushing against my bare feet as I crept.

My arms wishes had been granted after only 30 seconds. They greeted a doorway to which I invited myself in. After a short wandering of the room I found it to be about twice the size of the room I woke up in. The darkness felt much less dense, but still a little suffocating. It must have been Christmas because I had tripped and the forward motion of my small frame sent me face-first into a cold metal box that dented against my head on impact. The smaller they are, they lighter they fall- I was grateful for this phrase at that moment because it enforced the fact that my fall had not made much noise. Certainly not as much noise as that poor man had made when he took his tumble earlier.

The impact made the burning worse, and by the time I had gotten up to my feet my stomach roared with an acidic projectile that spewed out of my mouth without warning. I was not so concerned with this, with how I felt, as I was preoccupied investigating what I had ran into. The hard and sharp edges of the box lead my fingers to a mechanism that I then unlatched to reveal a breaker. I flipped what I assumed to be the main switch located at the top, and my dreams came true as the lights in the room flickered on. A few seconds of viciously processing the new information that sudden light gave to me went by before what I perceived as a crash of bitter emotions roar from what seemed to be on the other side of wall to my left. Followed by loud footsteps leading out of that room, quickly moving farther away from my ear. By the pounding pattern it made, it sounded like the creature trabbled away on all fours.

If there didn’t turn out to be any bullets in the gun, then at least the light offered me some sort of agency or peace of mind. Thats what I told myself. The first thing I noticed in the room was a large floor-plan of the building displayed in a hard plastic casing on the wall. My immediate surroundings made themselves known to me, to a more horrifying degree. Bodies. All dressed in full PPE. Safety goggles, surgical masks, vinyl gloves, hairnets and blue gowns. Materials once sterile but now contaminated with blood and the deathly presence of those who lay there wearing it. They where all laid on top of each other in the corner of the room, left of where the floor-plan was displayed. I’ve wanted to cry many times since waking up, but I have kept this a secret from myself. I could not hold this secret any longer when I saw a true picture of violence bathed in bright sterile light. In the dark I could not sense a detail but now *every* sickening detail, the light forced my eyes to process. I wanted to leave the room but I convinced myself to stick around and scorer around for anything I may need. I had the thought that if I found everything in this room that I possibly could then there would never be a need to return and be of the awful presence of the dead that lay still, melting into the corner of the room.

The map kindly informed me that I was in a rehab facility. Kettering Rehab Center. I was specifically in the break room. As I continued to comprehend this map I started to transcribe it using a crumpled piece of printing paper and a few pens I found laying around on the floor. The furniture in the break room had been all but destroyed and scattered across the floor leaving only open cabinets and a sink present, still working. I encountered my first remembrance of my past when it suddenly struck me that I had taken much joy in drinking directly out of the faucet as a child-- just as I was doing now. The restored power benefited me in more ways than simple light. I marked up absolutely everything I knew about the facility and deduced little things that mattered to me most at the moment in order to be organized.

[Here is my transcription of the map.](https://imgur.com/gallery/kettering-map-xrIuqH9)

I decided to search the two rooms south of the break room; starting with the room nearest to the south side of the building pictured in the map. The office provided me with a few minutes worth of scrounging through drawers and trying to guess the codes to safes I’d later find were entirely empty anyway. Documents on documents, from what I pieced together from previous admission reports written by this “AT” and a handful of emails I had discovered between “Ann Temway” and “Simon Klein”, things weren’t entirely as they seemed here, systematically. Ethically. I was starting to realize the current state of affairs in the facility as it stood now, were not as extreme when compared to the vague caricature of the place these now meaningless electronic communications and documents had painted out for me.  Simon Klein and Ann Temway seemed to communicate most through email, which was strange because their offices were apparently directly next to each other. I noted that the initials labeled NG on the map where in fact wrong, perhaps covering for Simon. This made me suspect that yet they were obviously the overseers of this center, they rarely made time to meet.

No bodies in these rooms, thankfully. I decided that I was only comfortable viewing a dead body in the dark. Investigating Simon's office was my next priority. In the threads of emails chaining between the two,  I gathered that Ann was primarily responsible for admission and floor treatment while Simon took an observatory backseat. It seems the pretenses, the foundation that Kettering Rehabilitation Center was built on, had always been flimsy at best. There was no sensitive information disclosed between the two through their communications on the computer, there were only faint notions and alludings to events and circumstances surrounding the center that in my research I found to be highly suspicious. From what I could infer the facility was just built. Fresh concrete. We were in the middle of an open field, the building being in close proximity to festival grounds. Small festivals and raves alike held on these grounds.

After tens of minutes, I made my way into “NG’s” office. Though every single room I’ve seen in the facility had been boldly trashed- it seems Klein managed to keep tidy amidst the massacre. Upon investigation I found that Simon's room had been practically cleaned out. The drawers and file cabinets already open and cleared before my arrival, inviting me to fill them with something they had lost. Something that I suspected had been taken from them by someone. All that was obvious to my vision was a toppled canister of gasoline laid out on top of the desk, next to a golden nameplate with the name Simon Klein engraved onto its face. I picked up the gasoline and set it upright, it was too heavy to lug around with me and I wasn’t quite desperate enough to start any fires. The sterile white lighting illuminated a small index note that had been revealed as I moved the canister of gasoline. The light shining down on the paper was so bright that I couldn’t discern the words until my eyes cursed the light and finally focused. The note was drenched in gasoline, the words still hard to make out with a focused eye.

' Took your advice, Ann. I also took the effort of burning the remaining documentation of Project Kettering before retreating.

To you the most, I wish luck and haste in your death. May your sacrifice and the remaining lives of our understudies prevail under my coming breakthrough in Appitizine engineering. - SK '

It was a farewell of sorts to Ann. When shit hit the fan it seemed that Klein didn’t stop for anyone else before retreating, or trying to retreat, and dying painfully. From what I’ve read so far, another conclusion I’ve come to is that this facility only treats patients with a history of a specific drug. “Appitizine”. Of course, the name alone gave me revelations of memories of my past, none of which I particularly cared to confirm within myself. I reeled at the thought myself intimately familiar with a drug I can not remember. The memories weren’t complete in my head, and I had not been convinced of this yet. The strange morality of this place made me feel even queasier than what the atmosphere had already instilled into my body. The implication of it all. Patient after patient, separated by admission reports and labeled as either “Appitizine Compatible” or simply “Incompatible”. Numbers upon numbers of patients split into two groups of red and blue bloods, each the opposite each other. By the sheer amount of admission documents I found in Ann's office, this organization had to have been operating long before this building was built. Though this information I had been blessed with, I still had no clue what exactly this drug was or how it may have affected me.

In my continued search of the office of Simon Klein I had gotten far more answers that I desperately wanted, but hadn’t been quite ready for. Tucked under the foot of the desk was a folder with the name “Amanda” written in neat handwriting. As I read, my heart burned. I was melting onto the very paper that I was holding so lightly in my hands. My forehead had gone nuclear, and fuzz blurred my peripheral as my vision tunneled in on the words I was reading, they were all about me. The whole paper was about me. It was some kind of report, the memory of reading my immediate past and the vague details of my distant past is even now hard for me to relive. [I will let this document speak for itself.](https://imgur.com/gallery/admission-report-9wuXMOO)

Amanda. My name finally familiar to me again. The document only confirmed what I had feared about my past. Judging by my physical reflection I had no reason not to believe this was the culmination of my life before I had come here. Before I had overdosed. The latest of my memories penetrate my mind like darts thrown at a printed photo of myself. Thrown by someone apathetic, wanting to cause me the pain of remembrance. I had overdosed on the festival grounds that lay just outside the doors of the facility. I was worthless and out of control, sleeping in my car. Eating out of dumpsters. Begging for any spare change one could give me that could afford me a shot of Appitizine for the next while until the come down once again dragged me back into the mind-frame of the fiend I had become.

The night I went to the festival, I went with my best friend. A friend I hadn’t spoken to in 10 years. I was so lost, desperate to reconnect with anyone that I had messaged him on Facebook and asked him to accompany the festival with me. It was an extravagant rock festival, though no big bill bands took the stage that night, drugs were still scattered amongst the college students that had been present and sweating the night away. I remember being so excited to introduce my friend to the drug that I schemed to nick another dose right from under the nose of the distributors who were oddly prepared- as if the festival even officially promoted the distribution of Appitizine amongst the crowd. The plasma in my forehead ended anymore memories recalled through this recent reading of mine.

I cared most about finding out the secrets that may reside with Simon Klein, in whatever dark corner of the building he may lay-- hopefully bled out and carrying the information I need to escape. The condescending nature of his writing to his colleges made me simply despise him off the simple notion that he was rude. My emotions had easily gotten the better of me, obviously. I would find my friend after I got out. If I remembered anything I remembered the extremely tightly screwed head on his shoulders, and I highly doubt he would have found himself here with me, even under the influence. In the back of my mind, I must have imagined coming across his mutilated corpse in the darkness a million times within the span of just a few seconds.

A strange wind spoke to me and told me that I was the one who was destined to get to the bottom of what really happened here. Out there, on the other side of these walls, I was worthless. No home, no family- just in my own fake world playing with old, fake toys that no longer worked. When I had gotten bored of my fake toys, I would manipulate someone into lending me theirs, to which I would make old, and fake- just like my last set of toys. I shot my credit at the chemical bank. Regardless of what I remembered and what I did not, I now had one purpose, over any gruesome death that could face me when I left the room. Over any god or master- or monster- I had one single purpose. I was going to catch Simon Klein, or at the very least his remnants. Only then would I escape and hold tight the one finger I still had on life before my admission.

All of this contingent on the slim chance that my skull wouldn’t be crushed to dust in an instant by the thing that stalked the floor of the treatment center, as apologetic as I may have interpreted the creature to be after I shot it. Either outcome I determined was means to an end when it came to the burning in my head, getting worse with every shallow step I took around the office that quickly turned into manic pacing as I rediscovered myself. All in the glory of addiction. I was sober upon awakening at the very least- and comparatively in a much better state of mind, ironically.

I took this strange, naive confidence instilled in me by my newfound purpose and dispelling of past icons in stride and used it to explore the rest of the building. The entire open floor plan, almost every square inch had been covered in trash and broken medical equipment and so many more bodies than I ever imagined could be laying in the dark. Though I could barely look, I got up close and personal with each one of the scattered corpses in order to search them. I was able to get an ID card off just about every corpse, listing their name- position and information about security clearances granted. A sterile and dull photo of each of their faces had been pictured on each card, only some of the corpses even remotely resembled what their ID picture had depicted. Their faces malformed and jawbones snapped off and thrown into the exact center of the room despite the bodies being scattered tens of feet away from each other randomly.

I considered investigating the room I encountered the creature standing in, but my instinct set a barrier that my mind was not willing to cross at that moment. I instead investigated the west end of the building which I had encountered a hallway near the south side and a set of stairs descending into cold darkness on the north side. I concluded these were both the entrances to the maintenance hall and basement respectively. Both of which had been blocked off with heavy wooden shelves stuffed with naked, blue cadavers of what I assumed to be more of the medical staff. Flies and the stench of death perused this area more definitely than the smell that flowed through the air vents. I almost wished I was part of their numbers, stuffed in my own little snug space on a shelf of my very own.

Making sure to avoid the creatures room, I eventually made my way to the neighboring space. It was all part of the area labeled “Incompatible treatment”. I found nothing in room 4. Room 3 however, presented me with a twisted formation of flesh and extremity laying in a bed on the far side of the left wall. I was again greeted with the same cold walls that met me as I awoke. From far away the figure on the bed looked like a pair of legs poking out of a burlap sack, but as I got closer I saw the full picture of this gruesome failure or miscommunication of human biology. It once looked to be a man, and from the waist down one could not tell the difference. The creature, shirtless, had no head, arms or other appendages other than two legs. Tight skin wrapped around just torso, organs pumping and bones contorting under the skin slowly and methodically. It had a single eye positioned towards the top of its frame, looking straight towards the ceiling. It didn’t look dead, but it seemingly took no interest in my presence at the moment.

If it was comfortable, I suppose I had to be comfortable too. I needed to be. My reconnaissance once again paid off, as I had manifested another precious document in my hands. I noticed it tucked under the fleshy torso of the creature to which I swiftly nabbed in one quick motion. This report directly related to what I witnessed on the bed. It seems long ago, he had two eyes- a head- and two arms. He also had a name, Edward. From what I gathered, Edwards current state is a reaction experienced by those who use Appitizine, yet do not have a compatible blood type for standard usage of the drug. Edwards blood was “Incompatible”. Instead of the desired affect, this seems to be what happens to those who aren’t cautious, those who don’t take some sort of blood test before receiving a dosage of Appitizine. I’m glad that I was now in recovery. This all confirmed to me that I was compatible with the drug, I had won the blood lottery. My documented “extended periods of usage” of Appitizine in my past and the fact I had woken up in the Compatible Treatment area only gave me additional clairvoyance and reassurance that I wouldn’t turn into the suffering mound of flesh and regret that Edward now was.

As I finished reading the document, I lowered it from my vision to let my eyes focus once again on Edward. His blue eye that sat lopsided on the skinny torso that was his person was now intensely focused on me. Anguish reigned as the eye stared into the flame, burning brightly through my forehead.

I've said as much as I can tonight. I've been up all night reliving this wondering if the grace of strangers on the internet will bring any sort of lasting feeling of safety even still as I recount these events.
