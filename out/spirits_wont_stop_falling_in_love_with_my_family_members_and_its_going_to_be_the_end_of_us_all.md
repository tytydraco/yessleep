I had always dreamed of a simple, joyful life with James, the man whose kindness and love had captured my heart. Our wedding was a beautiful affair, filled with hope and promises of a bright future. But soon after, the early days of our marriage turned into a nightmare. I, who had always been affectionate and warm, found myself acting distant and cold. My behavior became erratic, and I felt as though I was losing control of my own actions. At times, I felt completely detached, as if a dark force had taken over me.

  
One fateful night, as James reached out to me, trying to reconnect, I felt my body go rigid. A deep, malevolent voice emerged from my lips, one that was not my own. "Stay away from her. She is mine," it said, filled with possessive rage. The voice was that of a man, not mine, and it spoke with a terrifying sense of ownership.

  
The ghost identified himself as Sebastian, revealing that he had been infatuated with me since I was fourteen. "I am her husband," he growled through my voice. He claimed he allowed our marriage to happen only because I begged him to do so for the sake of my parents. However, he threatened to kill James if he attempted to be intimate with me again. In my moments of clarity, I had no memory of these terrifying episodes.

  
Despite the warning, James, desperate to salvage our marriage, tried again to be intimate with me. As he approached me gently, hoping the spirit had moved on, a violent force hurled him off the bed, injuring him severely. I watched in horror as he lay on the floor in pain, and I heard Sebastian's voice echo through the room: "I warned you, James. She belongs to me."

  
I had two sisters, Anna and Laura. Anna was in a relationship with a man named Mark. Sebastian revealed that Mark was also under the influence of a vengeful spirit—Victor, Sebastian’s cousin. Victor had harbored feelings for Anna since childhood. One day, Victor’s voice taunted James: "Watch closely. My cousin will soon claim his prize."  
The warning proved true when Mark died in a suspicious car accident. The police were baffled, but James and I knew the sinister truth behind the accident. The specter of Sebastian's wrath was far from over.

  
Sebastian’s attacks on James grew more violent. Whenever he was alone in his car, he felt an otherworldly presence manipulating the vehicle, nearly causing fatal crashes. Fear dominated our lives—fear of driving, fear of sleeping, and fear of being near each other.

  
Desperate for a solution, James confided in a friend who directed him to Michael, a renowned spiritual healer. Michael agreed to visit our home. Armed with ancient relics and sacred texts, he began his rituals. As he chanted prayers and burned sage, I felt Sebastian possess me again, roaring with fury: "You will not take her from me!"  
Undeterred, Michael spread salt in a protective circle around me and lit sage to purify the space. I thrashed violently as he placed a healing amulet around my neck, forcing Sebastian to retreat. "You are not welcome here, Sebastian. Leave this place and do not return!" Michael commanded. The room shook violently, but his determination never wavered.

  
For a brief moment, it seemed the exercise had succeeded. I collapsed, unconscious but unharmed, and James rushed to my side. As I slowly regained consciousness, it appeared that the worst was over. But the peace was short-lived.  
A few nights later, a deafening bang jolted us awake. The bedroom door burst open, and Sebastian and Victor's ghostly forms stood before us. "You think you can banish us so easily?" Sebastian's voice boomed. "We will never leave. We are bound to them, and they to us."

  
Michael was ready for this final confrontation. He stepped forward with a vial of holy water and an ancient book of incantations. "Your reign of terror ends tonight," he declared. He splashed holy water on the spirits, who screamed in agony. Michael began chanting, pushing the spirits back. Chaos erupted, but he continued his incantations, his voice rising above the supernatural fury. With a final spell, a blinding light erupted, pulling the spirits from the room. The house fell silent.

  
Finally, my sisters and I were free from our torment. The healing amulet remained a symbol of our liberation. James and I moved to a new town, away from the dark legacy of Blair Manor. Our relationship began to heal, and we started anew, our past struggles fading into a distant memory.

  
Six months later, as I was settling into our new life, I noticed something unusual. James was humming a haunting melody I had never heard before. When I asked him about it, he turned to me with vacant eyes and a small, unsettling smile. "Oh, Emily," he said in a voice that was not his own—a soft, feminine whisper. "I’ve always known it."

  
I froze, recognizing the voice immediately. It was filled with sinister playfulness. Before I could react, James’s face contorted, and the female voice spoke again, more forcefully: "I’ve waited long enough, Emily. Now, he is mine."
