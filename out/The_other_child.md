When I applied to babysit Emma, (5 years old), I wasn’t expecting anything too complicated. It was a normal family in a quiet neighborhood, with a clean and tidy house. Emma, the little girl, was adorable : curious, energetic, and well-behaved. Her parents seemed caring, almost overly protective, giving me every little detail about the rules.

“You won’t be alone,” the mother had told me, placing a hand on my arm. “Samuel is a bit more reserved, but he’s very independent. Let him come to you.”

I had assumed that Samuel was their older son. Maybe a solitary teenager who stayed in his room. I didn’t think much of it. I just wanted to do my job well, and everything went smoothly on the first night : Emma played quietly, then went to bed without a fuss. Samuel, on the other hand, didn’t appear. Maybe he was sleeping at a friend’s house or just stayed in his room.

But it was on the second night that I noticed something strange.

Emma was playing on the floor, drawing shapes with her crayons while I prepared dinner. Everything was calm, until I felt a movement behind me. When I turned around, I saw a boy, around eight or nine years old, standing in the kitchen doorway.

I froze for a moment, surprised by his silent appearance. His dark, messy hair and his red shirt, which seemed a little worn out, caught my attention.

“Hi, you must be Samuel”, I said softly.

He didn’t respond. His dark eyes seemed to be studying me, without a hint of emotion.

“Do you want something to eat ?” I asked, trying to sound relaxed.

He slowly nodded. So, I prepared a plate for him. But when I returned, he was gone. I placed the plate on the table, thinking he might come back later, but he never reappeared.

That night, when Emma’s parents returned, I asked them,
“Samuel is… very shy, isn’t he ?”

The mother raised an eyebrow, then burst out laughing, as if I’d made a joke. “Yes, you could say that !” she replied, without explaining further.

Weeks passed, and Samuel remained elusive. He appeared occasionally, always silent, always distant. Sometimes he watched Emma play, but he never participated. I began to wonder if something was wrong with him. Was he autistic ? Traumatized ? His parents hadn’t given me any explanation.

Emma, however, often talked about him.
“Samuel told me to be careful in the bathroom.”
“Samuel hid my socks to play a prank.”
“Samuel says he doesn’t like you very much.”

Her comments grew more and more unsettling.

One evening, as I was putting Emma to bed, I asked her, “Samuel is your brother, right ?”

She furrowed her brows. “No, he’s just here. He lives here.”

Her tone was so serious that a chill ran down my spine.

“But… who is Samuel ?” I whispered.

Emma tilted her head, as if my question was silly. “It’s Samuel.”

One evening, after putting Emma to bed, I went up to the attic to fetch some decorations the mother had mentioned earlier in the day. The air was heavy and dusty, and the light flickered. As I searched through the boxes, my foot hit something : an old, yellowed notebook.

Curiosity drove me to open it. Inside, I found family photos, but something was off. In one of the pictures, I recognized the house and baby Emma, but next to her was a boy. Samuel, looking exactly the same, and almost... like erased or slightly transparent. However, it wasn’t a recent photo. It was dated from three years ago.

Confused, I flipped through the notebook and found a folded newspaper article inside. The headline sent chills down my spine :

“9-Year-Old Boy Found Dead After Tragic Household Accident.”

The article described how a child named Samuel had slipped and fallen down the stairs of this very house over ten years ago.

I closed the notebook, my hands trembling. The silence in the attic became suffocating, almost alive. As I turned to go back downstairs, I saw him. Samuel. Standing in the dimly lit corner. I called his name, trying my best not to tremble, but he stepped backward and disappeared in the attic.

From that moment, everything changed. Samuel was no longer just a distant and silent presence. He was everywhere. I saw him in the reflections of windows, in the shadows of the hallway, and sometimes even in my own room when I closed my eyes after leaving the house.

Emma kept talking about him, but her tone had changed. She seemed scared. “Samuel says you shouldn’t stay here. He doesn’t like when someone else takes care of me.”

When I told Emma’s parents about it, they reacted the same way as before : awkward laughter, followed by silence. But their eyes betrayed a truth they didn’t want to admit.

The last night I babysat Emma, everything came to a head. A door slammed somewhere in the house, even though all the windows were shut. Emma woke up screaming. When I entered her room, I saw Samuel standing next to her bed, his face twisted in an expression of anger.

I don’t remember exactly how I left that house. All I know is that I never went back.

Later, I did some research online, and I discovered that several babysitters had worked in that very same house after Samuel’s death. And all of them had eventually left, terrified, leaving behind the same warning :

“Don’t touch Samuel. He’s still here.”
