I don’t usually talk about old cases. Most of them blur together after a while.

But two never did.

I was an Alaska State Trooper at the time. This was years ago, back when I still believed that every strange scene had a logical explanation—you just had to look hard enough.

One night I was on routine patrol when my cruiser slid off an icy road and got stuck in deep snow. It was around –10°F, dead quiet, no traffic for miles. I got out to dig myself free and noticed something in the treeline: a small clearing about fifty yards off the road.

Someone was sitting there.

A man. In a wooden chair. Completely still.

He was hunched forward slightly, a cigarette between two fingers, the tip glowing faintly in the dark.

That alone didn’t make sense. Nobody just sits in the middle of the Alaskan wilderness at night in subzero temperatures.

When I got closer, it got worse.

He was dressed like a blue-collar worker from the 1950s—wool jacket, heavy boots, faded work pants. No modern gear. No gloves. No hat.

He was frozen solid.

Not stiff. Not cold.

Solid. Like a statue made of ice.

His eyes were open. His face wasn’t scared or angry. It was… disappointed. The same expression a father gives when he catches his kid doing something stupid and doesn’t even have the energy to yell about it.

I checked for a pulse. Nothing.

I called it in immediately.

We searched the area for hours. No footprints. No vehicle tracks. No campsite. No missing persons report that matched him. Even the cigarette had no identifiable brand. Somehow it was still burning when I found him, but nobody could explain how.

The coroner estimated he’d been dead at least ten days.

No animal interference. No scavenging. No damage at all.

The story made statewide news. Briefly national.

Then it disappeared.

A few weeks later, another one turned up.

After a major blizzard, a group of troopers and park rangers were checking safety cabins—standard procedure after storms, making sure no one’s trapped or injured.

Inside one of the cabins, we found a man standing at the window.

He was posed like that famous Malcolm X photo, holding a hunting rifle, peering outside.

He was frozen solid too.

The cabin had been reinforced with steel beams after previous storm damage. The fireplace was warm. The heater was running.

The room was above freezing.

The man was not.

Same thing: no ID, no missing persons match, no explanation. Ruled hypothermia. Filed away.

Years passed.

I transferred to the FBI.

That’s when I started hearing similar stories—from troopers, tribal police, marshals, federal agents. People found in impossible conditions. Bodies posed in ways no hypothermia victim should be. Cases that went nowhere. Files quietly closed.

During training, I interviewed several long-term inmates. One of them was Ed Kemper.

I don’t remember most of what we discussed. But I remember one line perfectly:

“At any given time in the United States, there are at least thirty-five active serial killers.”

I told him about the man in the chair.

He didn’t laugh.

He just said, “Probably one of the thirty-five. And you won’t find him.”

That answer bothered me more than anything else he said.

So I started asking questions. Quiet ones.

Across agencies. Across states.

Everyone had at least one story.

They just didn’t like to tell it.

I’ll share what I can, when I can.

But if you have one too—something that never made sense, something that got buried—post it.

Don’t let them stay forgotten.
