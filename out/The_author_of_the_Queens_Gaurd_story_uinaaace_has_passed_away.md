From the post by his friend:
"I’ve dreaded this day for such a long time and unfortunately it is finally here.

I regret to inform you all that our boy Milos Bogetic (u/inaaace) passed last night around 9 pm, asleep at home with his family.

I’m so glad that through this community so many of you were able to get to know him and be inspired by his fight. Please know that all of your encouragement and acts of kindness over the past couple of years meant the world to him and I’m confident that without them, he wouldn’t have been able to fight on as long as he did.

Milos was always a bit of a cynic and I don’t think he had much faith in humans as a species. Our mutual disdain for other people was actually something we bonded over quite often (looking at you bluetooth speaker guys). Imagine his shock then when all of you rallied around him, sent him words of encouragement, gifted him clubs and gear, invited him for rounds of golf, hosted him at tournaments, and sent him on some of the most amazing golf trips to play bucket list courses. It was just an amazing experience that you all gave to him and I will be eternally grateful to this community for the love and support you showed to him during his final years and months.

While those are certainly all cherished memories, the greatest gift you all gave to him was knowing there were still plenty of good and decent people left in the world so he didn’t need to worry as much about leaving his family behind. That was something that weighed on him heavily and your outpouring of love really gave him a sense of peace while he was going through his fight.

I would give anything to be able to play with him just one more time, so please don’t ever take for granted any opportunity you have to be out on the course with the people you love. Also, and most importantly, remember the next time you pure it onto the green from 200 yards out and roll up to find the green is clear, as you slowly walk up to the flag and peek over the edge to find the cup empty, Milos is staring down at you with a smug look on his face, shaking his head saying, “c’mon bro, you know you’re not that guy”

Milos’s wife Trish wanted me to let you all know that this community was truly his biggest support system. You all brought him joy during his hardest times and for that she is forever grateful!

If any of you feel like memorializing our boy, feel free to write u/inaaace on your ball the next time you tee off, but understand that this will likely increase your chances of topping it 20 yards or shanking it straight into the woods (two of his favorite shots).

I love you all and thank you all once more from the bottom of my heart. To do what you did for this dying man is truly breathtaking and I’m bawling right now just thinking about what amazing human beings you all are."
