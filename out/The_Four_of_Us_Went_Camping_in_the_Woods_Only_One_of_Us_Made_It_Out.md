This happened over eight years ago, yet it still clings to my mind as if it all happened  yesterday. The memory is sharp, fresh, and I can feel the weight of it in my chest, especially when I close my eyes. Edward, our dear friend, passed away in a horrible accident. No matter what they say—no matter how they try to comfort me—deep down, I know it’s my fault.

We had planned the hike long before he died. Back then, everything seemed normal. The woods in Norway were supposed to be an escape, a place to clear our minds and reset. But after Edward’s death, it became something else entirely. We weren’t going to the woods for an adventure anymore; we were going to honor him. To somehow pay tribute to his absence. I still remember the conversation I had with him

We were sitting at a small café in the heart of the city, sipping our drinks after a long day of catching up. Edward had just returned from England, and as usual, his energy was infectious. He’d been telling me about his work, his life in the UK, but now his tone shifted to something more serious, a kind of excitement that only he could summon.

“There’s something beautiful,” he said, leaning in a little closer, his eyes gleaming with that familiar spark. “Something the world hasn’t seen before.”

I raised an eyebrow, half-smiling at him. “What are you talking about, man? What’s so special?”

Edward’s grin widened. “There’s a place out there in the woods. I can’t describe it. But I know it’s exactly what we need. You, me, the guys—we’re going to see it. We outta see it.”

I stared at him for a moment, trying to process what he meant. Edward was always full of ideas, most of them crazy, but this felt different—like there was something in his words that pulled at me. He wasn’t joking, I could tell. This was serious for him.

“Are you sure?” I asked, my voice low, still unsure. “We’ve all got our own stuff going on, Ed. You really think this is the time for something like that?”

Edward leaned back in his chair, looking at me with a kind of conviction I hadn’t seen in him before. “You’ve been carrying that weight, Ethan. And so have I. We need this—something pure, something untouched. The woods... the quarry. It’ll clear our heads, I promise you.”

I thought about it for a moment, the weight of my own life pressing on me—the divorce, the loneliness, the mess I was constantly cleaning up. Maybe Edward was right. Maybe this trip, this strange place he was talking about, was exactly what we needed.

“I don’t know, man,” I said, feeling the pull of his enthusiasm. “It just... sounds too good to be true. The world doesn’t work like that, you know?”

Edward chuckled, his eyes softening. “I know. But sometimes, you’ve gotta go after the impossible to find something real.”

I looked at him, and for a brief moment, I saw that old Edward again—the one who believed in things, who saw beauty in the world even when everything around him seemed dark. It was contagious.

“Alright,” I said finally, shaking my head but smiling. “I’m in. But if this turns into some wild goose chase, I’m blaming you.”

Edward laughed, the sound filling the space between us. “Trust me, Ethan. This isn’t a chase. It’s something you’ll never forget.”

There was five of us who planned the entire trip but then….*the accident happened…*.*and there was only the four of us*.

Francis, Joshua, Peter, and me—Ethan. But it never felt like four. Edward’s memory weighed on me the heaviest. He had been a good man, the kind of person you hold onto in a world like this. Honest, down-to-earth, with a smile that made you believe there was something good left in the world. Now he was gone, and we were left with nothing but the burden of his absence.

**Joshua**

Joshua was the first to suggest we still go. A solid guy, physically, but not much else. Joshua had always carried some weight—not from age but from bad habits. It showed in his broad frame, his tired eyes, and the heavy way he moved. His life was a mess, though he never talked about it. He had a wife and two kids at home, yet we all knew where he spent his nights. Seedy places—strip clubs, hotels, anywhere he could run away from the truth. His personal demons followed him everywhere.

But the real problem wasn’t just his inability to face his own flaws. No, it was me. I wasn’t the cause of his problems, but I was the one who took the brunt of his anger. I could see it in the way he looked at me—the quiet disdain. He blamed me for everything, for Rob’s death, for the way his life had spiraled, even for his failing marriage.

It was hard to be around Joshua after Edward died. He was an emotional wreck, only masking it behind tough talk and ill-advised actions. His temper was always on the edge, and when I’d catch him staring at me with those bloodshot eyes, I knew the anger simmering inside him was meant for me.

**Francis**

Francis was the religious one. He was the kind of guy who believed everything happened for a reason, that there was a divine purpose behind it all. Edward’s death? “Part of God’s plan,” Francis would say. I hated hearing that. What kind of plan takes a good man away from his friends and family? What kind of God allows something like that to happen?

Despite my frustrations, Francis’s faith never wavered. It was unshakable. His prayers before every meal, his insistence on forgiveness—it grated on me. Sometimes I’d bite my tongue, but other times I’d mutter under my breath, “Some plan.” It wasn’t just the tragedy that upset me—it was his way of coping with it, as if the pain could be prayed away, as if Edward’s life was some sacrifice for a greater good. But that wasn’t enough for me. I wanted Edward back, I wanted answers.

I didn’t know whether to admire Francis for his conviction or resent him for it. He seemed to have it all together, with his steadfast faith and unwavering optimism. But deep down, I knew it was a mask. No one can truly be that certain. And that bothered me more than I cared to admit.

**Peter**

Peter, though, was the one I envied the most. The perfect life. Married to a stunning wife, with two little girls who adored him. He had it all. The career, the family, the happiness. On the outside, Peter was everything I wasn’t—stable, loved, respected. He was the kind of man you wanted to hate, but couldn’t, because he was just too damn kind.

He never pushed me to open up about my failures or my struggles. He never judged me for the mess I was. Instead, Peter looked after me quietly, in his own subtle way. When I was at my lowest, he’d take me aside and tell me everything would be okay, even when I didn’t believe him. There was something comforting about Peter, though it made me feel small, insignificant. His kindness felt like a reminder of how far I had fallen.

I guess that’s what made it harder when things went wrong. Peter deserved better. He didn’t deserve to be caught up in this mess.

**Me** 

And then there was me. The screw-up. The one who couldn’t hold a relationship together, who wasted every opportunity in life threw his way. I was a mess. Drugs, failed jobs, broken friendships... I was everything Joshua hated, everything Francis prayed for, and everything Peter pitied.

I was the outsider in our group, the one who was never quite on the same wavelength as the others. The one who never quite belonged. I wasn’t close to Edward like the others had been, but I admired him. He was everything I wasn’t: confident, composed, and self-assured. He had his life figured out. I never did.

So when he died, it shattered something in me. And I’ve never been able to piece it back together.

\*\*\*

We climbed toward the creek that ran through the mountain, talking about Edward as we ascended. His laugh, his quirks, the way he would’ve loved this trip. It was supposed to feel good, to honor him. But instead, it felt wrong, like we were forcing something that didn’t belong anymore. We weren’t a group of friends anymore. We were just strangers to each other, trying to outrun the pain, the guilt.

When we reached the summit, other hikers were already there. Families with picnics, children playing by the water. It all felt so out of place. This wasn’t a place for joy. Not now. Not without Edward.

I kept looking over my shoulder, as if expecting him to be there with us, his laugh ringing through the air. But he wasn’t, only an empty presence that filled the hollow ground.

We climbed toward the creek that ran through the mountain, our steps heavy with the weight of unspoken thoughts. The higher we ascended, the more I felt the absence of Edward, like a shadow cast long behind us. We spoke of him, his laugh, his quirks, the way he would’ve loved this trip. Every memory was supposed to honor him, to keep him alive in some small way, but instead, it felt like we were forcing something that didn’t belong anymore

The trail narrowed as we approached the summit, and when we finally reached the top, the sight that greeted us made my stomach twist. The landscape should have been a reminder of peace, of the solace we sought, but instead, it felt foreign. The summit was crowded with families—mothers and fathers setting up picnics, children playing by the water, their laughter ringing in the crisp mountain air. It was too perfect, too much like something from a postcard, and I hated it.

*This wasn’t a place for joy. Not now. Not without Edward.*

I kept glancing over my shoulder, as if expecting him to materialize behind me, his familiar voice calling out my name, that laugh of his carrying through the trees. But he wasn’t there. There was nothing but the emptiness left behind, the hollow ground that seemed to suck the life out of everything around it.

“Let’s sit for a bit,” Peter said, pulling his backpack off and setting it down with a sigh. He looked at me, a faint smile on his face, but it didn’t reach his eyes. “Take in the view.”

I nodded, but I didn’t sit. I couldn’t. The air felt too thick, too heavy with the things unsaid. Instead, I walked over to the edge of the cliff, my eyes fixed on the horizon, trying to breathe through the knot in my chest. I lit up a cigarette…puffing through the heavy chemical smoke.

Joshua approached after a few moments, walking up beside me. We stood there together, silent. His hands were shoved deep into the pockets of his jacket, his breath coming out in uneven bursts. I could feel the tension in him, the quiet anger that had been simmering since we first set foot on this trail.

“You think he’d want us here?” Joshua muttered, his voice barely above a whisper.

I didn’t answer immediately. The question wasn’t one I could easily answer. Did Edward really want this? Did he want us to carry on, to keep pushing through, when it felt like we were only dragging his memory along with us like a broken wheel?

“He would’ve,” I finally said, my voice rough. “Edward wanted us to move forward..”

Joshua’s head jerked slightly, but he didn’t say anything else. Instead, he turned his gaze to the families below, the happy chatter of children climbing over rocks and chasing each other. His lips pressed into a thin line, but his eyes stayed on them, like he was seeing something I couldn’t.

After a long pause, he spoke again, his tone harder. “Doesn’t feel like we’re doing much moving forward, does it?”

I didn’t know how to respond. It wasn’t just that we were grieving, it was that we were still lost. Lost without Edward, and maybe even lost without each other. The idea of moving forward felt like a joke, like we were trying to take steps in a direction that didn’t exist anymore.

Finally, Francis called out from behind us, snapping me out of the quiet storm swirling in my mind. “C’mon, let’s keep going.”

We started back down the trail, moving in a somber procession toward the next part of the hike. I kept walking, my eyes on the ground, lost in thought, until I heard Peter call out from a little ahead.

“Hold up. You guys need to see this.”

We all quickened our pace, curiosity mingling with a growing sense of dread. Peter was standing just off the path, his face pale and drawn. He motioned toward the forest that lay just beyond the trail.

“What is it?” I asked, stepping forward to see.

There, hanging in the trees like some sick joke, was the body of a gutted elk. Its carcass was suspended, the blood still fresh, dripping from the open wound. But it wasn’t just the brutal nature of the kill that stopped me in my tracks. It was the symbols. Carved deep into the bark of the surrounding trees—strange, angular marks that seemed to pulse with some kind of malevolent energy.

“What the hell is this?” Francis breathed, his voice low and shaken.

“That’s fucking witchcraft…”, said Peter with a bit of tension in his voice.

“We should turn back,” Joshua muttered, his face ashen. “This isn’t right.”

But Peter stepped forward, squinting at the symbols on the trees.

“No, wait,” he said, a hint of stubbornness in his voice. “There’s a shortcut around here. If we cut through the forest, we can avoid this mess and get to the next camp faster.”

I looked at him, then back at the grotesque scene before us. My stomach churned, but something in me snapped. “No,” I said, my voice cold. “We’re not going into that forest. Not after this.”

Francis, standing off to the side, clenched his jaw, his eyes flicking between us. “We don’t even know what we’re looking at. It’s... it's just some weird hunting ritual. A warning, maybe?”

“Or something worse,” Joshua said, his voice tight. His gaze never left the elk’s body.

There was a long pause, and for a moment, I thought I saw the fear in Joshua’s eyes, something deeper than the anger he usually wore like armor.

“We need to stick together,” I finally said, my voice hoarse. “Whatever this is, we’re better off facing it as a group. We turn back, go back to the marked trail. Now.”

But no one moved. Instead, Peter’s voice broke through, low and stubborn.

“We’re cutting through.”

On our trail, darkness fell upon us…it must have been three or four hours that we were circling onwards through the way….a path Peter had suggested that would be quick….eventually night fell and the clouds thundered with heavy roars….eventually….we stumbled upon an empty cabin in the woods….The rain came down harder than it had all evening. The sound of it pummeling the roof of the cabin felt like an endless drumbeat, drowning out everything else. The fire in the small stone hearth flickered weakly, casting warped shadows across the walls. We were all huddled inside, wet, cold, and restless. The storm outside seemed endless, and the darkness inside felt suffocating.

We had no choice but to take shelter here. The cabin, though old and decayed, offered us some protection from the torrential downpour. We could have kept going, tried to push through, but the forest had swallowed us whole, and none of us had the energy or the desire to venture back into it. Not tonight.

“Shit,” Joshua muttered under his breath as he rubbed his hands together for warmth. “This place gives me the creeps. I think we should’ve just kept moving.”

I agreed. The cabin was unsettling. The air felt thick with something I couldn’t put my finger on, but it wasn’t just the storm. It was something in the very bones of this place. The wooden beams creaked, and the floorboards groaned as if the building itself was alive, holding its breath.

*And then we found it.*

Tucked into the far corner of the room, behind an old moth-eaten curtain, lay an effigy. The decapitated torso of a man—no, not a man—of something human, but not entirely. It was made of twigs, carefully crafted with a sickening precision. Antlers jutted out from the shoulders where arms should have been, each limb unnaturally bent. At its feet lay necklaces strung with more symbols, twisted, grotesque markings that seemed to pulse with something dark. The whole scene made my stomach churn.

“Jesus Christ,” Francis whispered, his voice barely audible. “What the fuck is this?”

We all stood there, frozen, for a moment. The air felt thick with unease, and no one dared approach the effigy. But there was nowhere else to go. So, we did what we had to do. We made camp in the same room, trying to block out the strange presence of the twisted figure.

That night, I couldn’t sleep. The storm raged outside, and the cabin creaked with every gust of wind. But it wasn’t just the storm that kept me awake—it was the memory.

*The accident.*

I kept hearing the crash in my head, the sound of metal twisting, crunching against metal, and then the sickening thud of bodies hitting the ground. The screeching of the tires, the engine's roar as it swerved out of control, everything happening in slow motion. I could see it over and over again—Edwards standing there, frozen, unable to move, his eyes wide with shock as the truck careened toward him. *I could’ve saved him…*

I woke up with a gasp, my body soaked in cold sweat, my heart pounding in my chest. I reached up instinctively to touch my own face, as if to remind myself I was still here, still alive. But the nightmare lingered. The guilt. The failure. It would always be with me.

My chest burned, and I winced as I touched it. Something was wrong. I pulled back my shirt to reveal the source of the pain—puncture wounds, several of them, like small, shallow holes, scattered across my chest. Blood was dried in places, but the wounds were still fresh. The others were beginning to stir, groaning and stretching in their places, unaware of the horrors that had already begun to settle in.

*And then I heard it.*

Peter screamed—his voice high-pitched with terror—and I turned to find him writhing on the floor, his eyes wide with fear, his body trembling uncontrollably. He was soaked through, his clothes plastered to his skin as if he had just been dragged through the mud. But it wasn’t the rain that made him like this—it was pure, unadulterated terror.

“Help me!” Peter cried out. “It’s coming! It’s coming!”

I rushed to him, trying to calm him down, but Peter wasn’t hearing it. His breath was ragged, his eyes unfocused, and the stench of urine filled the air. I could barely look at him.

Then I saw Joshua. He was sitting in a corner, his eyes wide, but not seeing anything. His lips moved in a continuous chant, his body stiff as though he were caught in some kind of trance. He was screaming now, too, but it wasn’t the scream of a man in pain. It was the scream of a man calling for something, someone—*Abigail*. His wife. The name echoed through the cabin, twisted and haunting.

But it was Francis that made me freeze in place. I turned to see him, standing in front of the effigy, completely naked. His hands were raised in prayer, his face a mask of anguish. “*Please forgive me,*” he murmured, his voice cracking. *“Please, God, forgive me.”*

“What the fuck is going on?” Peter shouted, panic creeping into his voice.

I couldn’t answer. All I knew was that something was deeply wrong—this wasn’t just fear, this wasn’t just a bad dream. Whatever was happening to us was tied to this place, to the forest, and to the damn effigy.

“We need to leave,” I said, my voice shaking. “Now. We can’t stay here any longer.”

But I wasn’t in charge. Francis, shaking with feverish desperation, was the first to make a move toward the door.

“We need to leave. This place is cursed,” he muttered, but his words sounded like something else. A command. A warning.

We stumbled outside, trying to get our bearings in the forest. The trees loomed over us, silent sentinels in the gray light of morning. Francis led the way, his gaze fixed, almost hypnotically, on the path ahead. But I could see it in his eyes—he was as lost as we were.

And then it happened.

“Over there,” Francis whispered, his voice hoarse. “Do you see that?”

We all turned to look. There, amidst the trees, a large figure—*tall, dark, and looming*—shifted between the branches. I saw it first, and my heart skipped a beat. It was massive, its silhouette so dark it seemed to swallow the light around it.

“Stop,” I ordered, my voice hard. “You’re seeing things.”

But Francis wasn’t backing down. “No, I saw it,” he insisted. “It’s out there. We need to run.”

Peter, ever the skeptic, shook his head. “There’s nothing out there. Just trees.”

That’s when Joshua snapped. “We wouldn’t even be here if it weren’t for *him*!” he shouted, pointing directly at me. “This is all your fault, Ethan!”

My blood ran cold, and I felt the sting of his accusation.

“We wouldn’t be here if you hadn’t dragged us into this mess,” I shot back, the words bitter in my throat. 

“We wouldn’t be in these woods at all if you hadn’t insisted on coming. If you hadn’t *pushed* us!”

The tension snapped. Joshua lunged at me, fists flying. I barely dodged, stumbling backward as his rage consumed him. And in that moment, I knew—we were all broken.

But it was too late. The forest was never going to let us leave. *It was only the beginning….*
