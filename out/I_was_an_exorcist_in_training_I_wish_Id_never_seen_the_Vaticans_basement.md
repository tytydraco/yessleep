I squirmed uncomfortably in the ancient stool, its uneven padding forcing me to sit at a slant. In retrospect, I’m sure Cardinal Robles chose it on purpose. 

He wanted to see me as uncomfortable as possible. All part of the test. 

Of course, I was nervous already. As intended, the grand chapel’s ceiling soaring above us made me feel small. Sixty-six feet above us, God reached out to Adam, granting him life. The metaphor was obvious: I was Adam, waiting for my prize. But what was the Cardinal about to give me?

The old man fixed me in his gaze. 

“What do you know about Hell?” he asked after a few moment.

I thought back to my training. 

“Hell is the absence of God,” I answered carefully.

He smirked.

“Good. Cautious answer. We like caution here. Sometimes. Other times, we prefer cojones.” He started laughing, as if he’d just made some kind of outrageous joke.

The Cardinal had grown up on the streets of Montevideo in Uruguay. He had a reputation for crude jokes. Some people called him ‘direct.’ Others called him an asshole. I suppose he was both.

“Let me rephrase,” he said. “Suppose I were to ask you the geography of Hell. Could you draw me a map? Could you describe its mountains? Its swamps?”

I shook my head.

“I have never thought of it as a physical place,” I answered, still careful.

“Of course not,” he said. “But you’re not so stupid as to deny the connection between the physical and spiritual, correct? Take your little altercation in Los Angeles. You sewed the girl’s lips shut, correct? But if that’s all you did, there would have been no effect. You were able to quell the demon’s hunger because the sewing of the mouth had a metaphorical, spiritual equivalent. Same with the demon’s eyes on the plane. Think of Matthew 18:9: And if thine eye causeth thee to stumble, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: it is good for thee to enter into life with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into the hell of fire”

“Now I’m a bit lost,” I confessed.

The cardinal rubbed at his temples, clearly disappointed. 

“Let’s try this one more time. Stop being so goddamned careful, or I’m sending you back to the states to study under Father David.”

I shuddered at the thought. Father David was a notorious coward, a priest only fit to deal with minor exorcisms. He had called the Vatican for assistance so many times on major ones that he’d earned the name “Father Backup” amongst his peers. 

“Those things you sealed. Where do you think they live? Think back to Maya Knowles’s house.”

I closed my eyes and thought back to the house where I’d sewn Maya Knowles’s lips shut. I had spent every hour since then trying to block out the smell of blood and colon, the thickness of the air. Suddenly, I found I was speaking, almost without trying:

“A swamp,” I said. “Thick mud. Shit raining from the sky.”

The Cardinal’s eyes lit up.

“Yes. Yes. More.”

“Someone’a always screaming. Animal sounds. The air is freezing. There’s a constant hail pelting the burning mud.”

“Yes!” He shouted. And then he began to recite:

In the third circle I arrive, of show'rs

Ceaseless, accursed, heavy, and cold, unchang'd

For ever, both in kind and in degree.

Large hail, discolour'd water, sleety flaw

Through the dun midnight air stream'd down amain:

Stank all the land whereon that tempest fell.

I struggled to remember where he was quoting from. Certainly not the Bible this time. 

“Inferno,” he said after a moment, looking disappointed. “You’re not a literary man?”

“I studied engineering in college,” I said. “More of a math brain. I do remember something about Dante being non-canonical…”

He rubbed his temples again. There was something exaggerated about his movements, like Donald Duck losing his cool in an old cartoon. 

“There are truths in this world that are better kept secret,” he said. “The church must act as a shield sometimes. You know? Guarding the flock from the fiery darts of the wicked? And so it is with us exorcists.”

I looked up at him, slightly confused.

“I wasn’t aware that you are… were? An exorcist yourself? I mean, you’re a Cardinal–”

He started laughing. 

“There’s a lot you don’t know.”

He stood, stretching slightly. Then he began to lift the hem of his robe. I looked down to see a deep scar running from his ankle to his knee.

“Got that one from a demon of violence named Tauru. Everyone was sure I’d lose the leg below the knee. Doctors are idiots, of course.”

He raised the robe further and turned from me, exposing four parallel scars across his back. 

“Those are from Mammon himself. Demon of greed. He got away from me, but not before he left me this little souvenir.”

He paused, looking up at the ceiling, up at God.

“There demons, you understand, they’re different than the minor entities responsible for most possessions. Even what the church calls a “Major Exorcism” is really just the minor leagues compared to what we handle. These demons I’m talking about, they are the lords and lieutenants of hell. Professional soldiers for the other side. More exorcists will never encounter one over the course of a whole career.”

“The thing that was inside Maya Knowles–” I started to say.

“--was Lady of Hell. A demon of gluttony. Quite powerful. Really, you shouldn’t be here today. If things had gone according to the demon’s plan she would have eaten you too, and then consumed her own host body like an ouroboros, breaking her own arms and legs and swallowing them whole.”

I was beginning to feel sick. And if I’m going to be honest, I was afraid. Everything I’d known about demons up to that point was suddenly invalid. I thought I’d been a soldier for the church, but now I realized I was playing parlor games with Hell’s second-stringers. Were the things that had taken Maya and Anselmo the worst things out there… or were there even worse horrors to be discovered?

“Why are you telling me all this?”

He smacked his head, and muttered “Dios mio.” Then he looked up at me. “Isn’t it obvious?” he finally asked. “I want to know if you want in! If you want to play in the major leagues, mijo! Do you want to fight some real demons with us, or do you want to go back to sprinkling holy water on little shits pretending to be possessed so that they can get more attention from mama!”

I thought of the demon slurping Father Anthony’s guys through the tiny hole at the side of its mouth. I thought of the baby head sprouting from Father Anselmo’s neck, its deep, guttural laugh. I thought of the foul air, the smell of shit.

Cardinal Robles held up a hand.

“Don’t answer yet,” he said. “It’s enough to know you’re considering it. Before your answer, you need to see the reality of what we’re up against.” He swept his arm out with a flourish. “Follow me.”

“Do you believe in god? Any kind of god?” 

I looked up at Sofia. It was a bold question for a second date, but she was asking it anyway. Even before I’d asked her out, I’d known Sofia was religious. Not that she was a fanatic or anything, but she went to church most Sundays, which was unusual in our social group. 

I shrugged, hoping we could deal with the question quickly and move on to another topic.

“I think at some point, I decided it was one of those big questions that you could never answer. So I stopped asking. I try to spend my time on problems that have solutions.”

She silently ate a few forkfuls of her salad.

“I’m assuming you do?” I said, trying to break the awkward silence. “Believe, I mean?”

“Well, I don’t believe in god,” she said after a bit. “Believe implies there’d be a possibility of doubt. I know there’s a god. Because I know there are demons. I’ve seen them at work.”

I topped off my wine and took a drink. This was getting interesting.

“What do you mean, seen them?”

“This is going to sound crazy, so I’ll understand if you get up from the table after a bit and walk out on me. I won’t be offended at all. We can still be friends after.”

I met her eyes. They were deadly serious.

“I’m not going to do that,” I said. “You can tell me.”

Now it was her turn to take a long drink.

“When I was younger, fourth grade, I was possessed for a few months,” she said. 

I almost spit out my wine. 

“I know how it sounds,” she continued. “I used to be embarrassed to tell people. But… it’s part of who I am. There was a demon living inside me. It pushed me to a dark little bubble that I didn’t know existed. It was terrifying, watching her through a black haze, saying the most vile things to my parents, my sister. I’d always been a good kid. At least, that’s what I thought. But I must have let her in somehow.”

She was crying now. For a second, I wondered if I was on a date with an insane person. But when I looked at her, she didn’t seem even the least bit crazy. I reached out and took her hand. 

“I’m so sorry,” I said.

“It’s okay,” she said. “The church–they sent people. Exorcists. It turned out to be something minor, they said. It didn’t feel minor to me. But their prayers made it go away.”

“I’m sorry,” I said again. What else could I say?

“Don’t be,” she said. “It was a gift. After that, I didn’t have to believe anymore. I knew there was something out there. A bad thing. And a good thing. I’ve gotten to carry that with me every day of my life.”

I followed Cardinal Robles through a series of rooms and doors, each less grand than the last. Gone were the frescos and magnificent tapestries. Instead, we weaved through corridors of simple brick. 

I realized that the architecture too was growing simpler, older. The brickwork was uneven, caked with centuries of grime. The air began to grow cold. Without realizing it, I recognized that we’d been walking slowly downward. There were no windows here or even electric light, just large candles inset into the walls.

“Of course, everyone knows about the grandeur of the current Apostolic Palace. But like many things in life, truths lurk beneath the surface that most people never realize. Some of these bricks you’re seeing now go all the way back to the 4th century. This was all part of the Old St. Peter’s Basilica, constructed by Constantine the First. He was a convert like you, you know.”

The path we followed was winding and haphazard. Without the Cardinal there, I wondered if I’d be able to retrace my steps and escape. 

Escape. That word started to echo in my mind. I realized I didn’t like it here. I hated it. Wanted to get out at any cost, back to the light, the murals, God and Adam.

Then, something shifted in me. Somewhere, not too far away, I felt her presence. It was unmistakably Sofia, as if she’d just walked behind me in the hall. I turned, sure I’d seen her, but she was gone. 

It was enough to make me keep walking forward. Finally, we came to a door. 

“Beyond this door is no return,” said the Carindal after a few moment. “Even if you choose not to join us, you will have seen things beyond your imagining. Beyond the worst descriptions of Dante or even Revelation.”

For a moment, I only stared at the door handle. It looked ornate and ancient. Filthy from the grime of a thousand hands of a thousand priests. Beyond it, I heard something that sounded like the clanking of metal on metal. 

“Go ahead,” said the Cardinal. “Open it.”

I took a step back in revulsion. But when I looked again, I saw now a handle, but a woman’s hand, soft and welcoming. I knew who it belonged to, saw the familiar wedding band on the ring finger. I knew, somehow, that if I went forward, I was moving closer to her.

I walked forward and opened the door. 

We entered a room built of ancient stones. It was perhaps as large as a high school gymnasium but perfectly round, with many doors extending in all directions. To one side sat a man in priest’s robes and a thick leather apron. Nearby, a cauldron of molten silver sat over a roaring fire. 

As I watched, the priest said a blessing over the silver, then poured it into a large, cross-shaped mold. Soon, he was pounding on the surface. Beside him, in neat stacks, lay perhaps a hundred such crosses, all neatly stacked.

“Why so many?” I asked the Cardinal, who only smirked.

“You’ll soon see.”

He gestured to the blacksmith, who set aside his hammer for a moment.

“Where are the new prisoners? Or–just the girl, actually,” asked the Cardinal, and the man gestured silently to one of the doors, adorned with gold inlay and flanked by small, silver gargoyles. 

The man resumed his work as we walked to the door and opened it.

On the other side, I found out what the crosses were for. 

In the center of a small, dimly-lit room lay a cage. More of a box really, a six-foot cube. The whole thing had been built of silver cross, all elaborately connected to form an inescapable grid. 

Inside lay Maya Knowles. Her eyes were no longer closed, but the stitching still ran across her lips. Both of her wrists were manacled in bracers connected on opposite sides of the cage by silver chains. 

I gave the Cardinal a curious look.

“This is like no exorcism I’ve ever seen,” I said.

He shook his head.

“You misunderstand, father,” he said. “This is no longer an exorcism. Maya–and whoever has infested her–will be here as our permanent guests, unable to cause further mischief in the world.”

I felt something twist in my stomach.

“You have to let her go,” I said quietly. “I can get the thing out of her. Together, we–”

The Cardinal shook his head.

“You could kill her,” he said. “Release her that way. But there is no saving Maya Knowles’s mortal life. Which is why she’ll be our guest here for as long as she lives. For as long as the demon is trapped within Maya’s mortal coil, it will be unable to hurt another soul.”

“You can’t,” I said. “Maya–she’s still in there. She’s an innocent.”

“Were she truly innocent, the demon would have never infested her,” said the Cardinal. “Please understand, I know this is a lot to swallow. This is why we work in the basement, out of the light. What we do here takes moral courage. The same bravery that Abraham possessed when he stood over Isaac, dagger in hand. Thanks to Maya’s sacrifice, dozens of others–possibly hundreds–will be spared a similar fate. She is the true cage. The box of silver crosses, that just keeps her in place.”

As he spoke, Maya looked up at me, her eyes pleading. 

“It’s her,” I said. “Right now it’s her, not the demon. It let her to the surface. She’s experiencing all of this.”

“Of course,” said the Cardinal. “The demon loves to hide inside. It loves to let her suffer.”

“Maya can’t eat like that,” I said. “Can’t drink. She won’t live long.”

The Cardinal shook his head.

“You still don’t understand the powers we’re facing. With demons of this strength–these lieutenants of hell–the possessed body is essentially immortal. It has no need for sustenance. Maya will still be here long after you and I are both dust.”

I wanted to fall to my knees and vomit. The Cardinal was staring at me hard, trying to read my reaction.

“Do you need a drink?” he asked. “Water? Wine?”

I found I could barely speak. He shook his head, looking disappointed. 

“Do what you must,” he whispered. “I never claimed it was easy to be a soldier on the front lines.”

I ignored him and took a step toward Maya. Then, suddenly, something compelled me to run to her. I felt around the cage of silver crosses, searching for a hinge that would open or a weak spot on in the soldering.

“Step away!” shouted Cardinal Robles. He was keeping his distance from both of us. “You still don’t know what your dealing with, and those restraints aren’t built to be permanent–”

Before he’d even finished his sentence, I heard a horrible cracking sound, and I looked over to see Maya’s wrenching her arm against one of the bracers. The arm had clearly broken, and now blood was gushing freely from the places where her bone had pierced her flesh.

Quickly, she pulled the broken limb from the bracer and swung her limp forearm in my direction, spraying me with blood. The blood splattered across my face, running down my lips and into my mouth, and I was struck by the sensation that I’d ingested poison.

“Drink up, priest!” The thing inside her shouted before breaking into peals of laughter.

I looked around the room, looking for some kind of weapon. I was filled, suddenly, with a bloodlust like I’d never known.

“Step back!” shouted Cardinal Robles again. This time, he grabbed my collar and pulled hard. He was far stronger than he looked, and I found myself clattering against the ground.

He rubbed at the bridge of his nose, frustrated. The demon was laughing now, at me, I realized. 

“This is your new soldier, Robles?” it asked. “He’ll be dead before the week is out!”

As she spoke, blood continued to pour from her open wound. Seeing my eyes fixed on it, she tried to swing it at me again, but this time I was too far away for the blood to hit me. My stomach turned. If I’m going to be honest, I almost pissed myself. 

In that moment, I realized I couldn’t be in the room another second. My instincts took over. I had to leave. The demon cackled as the fear took over, and I ran. 

“Go if you like,” called Cardinal Robles. “But you can’t run from the devil!”

I was more terrified than I’d ever been in my life, if I’m being honest. Not just of the thing in Maya, but of the Cardinal outside the cage, of the whole new reality I’d stumbled into. 

I ran back to the room with dozens of doors to find the blacksmith back at his work, smoothing out another silver cross.

I tried to remember which door I’d come from in the first place, but they all looked basically the same. I walked the circle, fruitlessly searching for some identifying mark but came up empty. Finally, I just opened one.

On the other side was a dark tunnel leading downward. A waft of sulfur hit my nostrils, blowing on a hot wind. I was immediately struck by the certainty that I’d opened a doorway to hell itself. I was about to close it when I heard a voice calling for me.

“Matthew?” it said. “Is that you? I’ve been waiting for so long, calling to you, trying to bring you here.”

I could barely speak. My throat went dry. My vision blurred. Somehow, I still managed to speak her name.
