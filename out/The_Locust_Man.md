Every town has their own version of “The Boogeyman”.  A monster, cryptid, phantom, whatever you want to call it, it’s all essentially the same thing- just a scary story they tell kids to get them to behave. An urban legend is just a life lesson disguised as a horror story, after all. For us folk living up in the tiny and once prosperous gold-mining town of Trillium, ours was called The Locust Man. 

Now, let me start by saying, I realize how ridiculous that name probably sounds to you. *The Locust Man?* Pfttt. What’s he going to do besides get stuck in the grill of someone’s pickup truck? Destroy some crops? Oooh, he sounds *real* scary… yeah, I know. Yet, as I sit here nearly 20 years later still trying to make sense of what happened, a grown woman who’s wiser, stronger and even more grounded in reality than my 12-year old self, I find myself hesitating to even type that name. 

I guess we should go back to where it all started. I remember as a young child I had always thought it was strange that our town was called Trillium, considering I had never come across a single one growing there. If you don’t know, a trillium is a small white flower with 3 pedals and a bright yellow center. They sort of look like if you took a lily and tore off every other petal playing ‘he loves me, he loves me not’. 

In school, around 2nd grade, we were taught all about this elusive flower I had never seen in real life, but above all, how very proud our town was to be named in its honor. Trillium, Colorado was established in 1922. A new town born in the wake of a tragedy that had struck the previous town, which had once sat in the same location. A ‘rebranding’ tactic, I suppose one could say. 

For us, and those that came before us, the trillium blossom was supposed to be a symbol of hope and rebirth. Knowing all that I know now, that sentiment feels morbidly absurd. 
              
Growing up in a small and mostly isolated town like Trillium, there really wasn’t much for a kid to do. You’d have to drive almost an hour to get to the closest mall or movie theater, so those trips were reserved only for special occasions. The high school kids would all go hang out at the roller rink downtown, or at the old run-down burger joint called Slim’s that sat across it. My friends and I weren’t allowed to go downtown without a chaperone though, and by that age, going with parental supervision was both embarrassing and inconvenient. 

My neighborhood consisted of a row of modestly sized homes situated on a long dead-end road called Rain Street. At the end of the road was a large patch of woods that separated the abandoned mining system from the main part of town. The old trail the minors used was still easily accessible for the most part, so we used to go hang out in those woods all the time as kids. 

We had a ‘secret spot’ which, what we thought at the time, was about halfway through the woods, 10 steps away from a small creek that ran the length of the area. ‘Rain Creek’, we used to call it. There was a small clearing there, and we had created our own clubhouse in the center of it, using old milk crates for supports, half-broken wooden pallets as walls, and a few old lawn chairs one of the neighbors had thrown out. I made my contribution by bringing an old tarp we had lying around in our basement, which found new life by serving as the roof of our arboraceous establishment. 

Our parents weren’t exactly thrilled with the idea of us running around in the woods by ourselves, but as long as we stayed within earshot and made it back before the streetlights came on, they probably figured it was still safer than letting us run around with all the hooligans downtown unsupervised. I guess they picked their battles. 
            
It was me, Lacey, Devin, Mikey and Michelle. We were all best friends- pretty much inseparable, except the boys weren’t invited to the girls’ sleepovers, and vice versa. Everyday after school we’d all get dropped off by the bus at the very beginning of our street. It became a running joke between the Rain Street Gang (as we liked to call ourselves) for us to all try and run off the bus as fast as possible, while me Lacey and Devin all yelled out, ‘last two home are some rotten eggs!’, with Mikey and Michelle trying to push past us to get a head start. The aforementioned two were siblings, and lived in the very last house on our street, so they’d always get home last, regardless of their efforts. Although, the year that Mikey got a pair of Heelys for Christmas, he finally got his edge over the rest of us, leaving Michelle to be the lone rotten egg until the following summer, when one of his wheels broke off. The whole point of it all was just to get home and get our chores and homework done with enough daylight left to make our trek into the woods and back, together as a group. 

The ‘RSG’ had made a pact never to visit the clubhouse without all five members present, though us girls always had our suspicions that the boys thought themselves to be excempt from that rule. They were the ones who had discovered the clearing in the first place, and not to mention, did most of the physical labor of hauling our provisions out there. Lacey and I only learned of the spot a day after the boys had found it. Michelle had walked in on Mikey and Devin talking about it, and immediately relayed that message to us. Michelle wasn’t necessarily more loyal to the girls, she was just the youngest in the group, and couldn’t resist blurting out any mildly relevant information she thought she might have, in a desperate attempt  to be included. To say she was nosy would be an understatement. But, in that regard, if the boys *had* ever gone out there without us, they would have had to be extremely sneaky about it, as it was well known that Michelle’s number one objective in life was to gather any piece of intel she could. It was a seemingly normal Saturday morning when Lacey and I learned that all of our speculating may have been warranted. 
              
I had slept over at Lacey’s the night before. We were in her room sitting on her bed and discussing our possible plans for the day as she filed her nails. Out of nowhere, Michelle flung open the door and barged in. The expression on her face immediately told us she had just gotten ahold of some real juicy information, before her words could even begin spilling out. 

“Oh my God… you guys! Guess wh-wh-what?!”

Lacey gestured the nail file toward Michelle in a circular motion, raising her eyebrows bluntly as Michelle struggled to catch her breath from running all the way there.

“So… last night, Devin came to sleep over, and… wh-wh-while they were in Mikey’s room, I pretended I was going to the bathroom so I could spy on them! See, I was s’pposed to be asleep, but I-“

“Ugh, come on Michelle, get to it! What’d you hear?” Lacey snapped.

“Okay, okay… jeez! I *am* getting to it! Ugh! So… I heard the boys talking, anddd…”

She paused excitedly for a moment, as if she were expecting a drum roll to precede her announcement. 

“They’re planning to go try and find the abandoned mine today!!!” 

“Alright Michelle! Good spying!” I chuckled, trying to encourage her after Lacey’s impatience. 

Lacey looked over at me and rolled her eyes, then abruptly stood up off the bed. She took the scrunchie from her wrist, tied her long blonde hair up into a messy bun and said, 

“Let’s go.”

“Lacey…” I protested. 

“What??” She responded as if she hadn’t registered the tone in my voice at all. 

I opened my mouth, but before I could begin explaining all the practical and logical reasons why even if the boys were stupid enough to go play around somewhere dangerous, *we* shouldn’t be, Michelle exclaimed,

“That is where The Locust Man lives!”
 
I immediately closed my mouth in defeat, knowing Lacey will now take this nonsense as a challenge, and no amount of my reasonings will have any effect on her decision. She dismissed Michelle’s comment while attempting to shove her foot into one of her new pink sneakers that she refuses to admit are too small for her.

“Pshh, don’t be such a baby, Michelle. He’s not real, you do know that right?”

Michelle crinkled her face and yelled back,  

“Yes, he is Lacey! He is!! And that is where he lives, and he eats kids that go there!” 

“Oh yeah? You still believe in Santa Claus too? What about the tooth fairy?” Lacey laughed. 

Michelle looked down at her shoes, and even though she could admittedly be annoying, I found myself feeling bad for her. 

“Come on Lace, she’s just scared.”

She once again rolled her eyes, then said,

“Get dressed.”
                
We walked in silence towards the end of the road, though all three of our reasons for it differed drastically. Lacey’s was determination and resolve, mine was contemptuousness and defeat, and Michelle’s was just fear. I found myself hoping the boys had left already, but as we approached the driveway, we caught them right as they were about to step off the porch.
 
“Hey!!” Lacey yelled in her trademark cheerleader cadence, adding one hand on her hip for flair. “Where exactly do you boys think you’re going without us?” 

Mikey let out an annoyed groan, while Devin stepped forward and said, 

“Well actually, we were just heading out to go and find you girls.”

“Liar!!” Lacey snapped, quickly wiping the shit-eating grin off of Devin’s face. “Michelle already blabbed. We know exactly where you two are going, and we’re coming too.” 

Devin looked at Mikey for approval, who, after a moment of consideration, replied, 

“Okay fine, whatever. But no crybaby snitches allowed.”

Michelle then proceeded to prove both of his accusations correct at once by whining back, 

“I am *not* a crybaby! I’m telling mom if you don’t let me come with you guys!” 

At that point, I spoke up. 

“Alright, listen.” I said sternly. Then once I had their full attention, I lowered my voice a bit and continued, “Just for the record, I think trying to go find that grody old mine is a dumb idea and a colossal waste of time. But, if one of us goes, then *we* all go. That’s the deal. So make your decisions.”

Lacey folded her arms in solidarity beside me, and with that, we all had an unspoken understanding. With the boys out ahead leading the way, we headed towards the uncertainty that waited beyond the tree line. 

As we entered the woods, I felt a sense of dread wash over me- but to be fair, as a preteen emo kid who’d already reached an adult level of cynicism, I felt a certain amount of dread towards almost everything in life. So, take my premonition with a grain of salt, but for some reason, and even though I played in those woods almost every single day, this day felt… *different*. I remember the woods being abnormally quiet. It took some time for me to even notice, but once I did, I interrupted the mindless chatter going on around me to ask,

“Where are all the freakin’ birds?”

They all looked at me as if I’d completely lost my mind. 

“Uhh, what in the hell are you talking about?” Devin asked. 

I pointed up towards the treetops.

“Listen...”

 They all looked up, then back at me again in confusion. 

“Every single time we’ve been in the woods, there are always birds chirping back and forth. We’ve been walking for a few minutes now and I haven’t heard a single one, have an of you guys?” 

“Damn… yeah, that *is* weird.” Mikey agreed.

“They probably all just migrated!” Devin goofily offered.

“Um, that’s stupid Devin, birds migrate for the Winter. If anything, there should be *more* birds around, it’s the middle of Spring, you moron!” Lacey argued back. 

Devin flipped her off, which was the best rebuttal he could usually come up with, then turned to me and asked,

“Okay whatever, what’s your point exactly?”

“Just that- “

I paused and looked over at Mikey, then back at Devin.

“It’s weird.”

I didn’t want to say what I was actually thinking. That the woods being too quiet was never a good thing. That when birds fall silent, it could mean danger. Like a predator nearby, or a severe storm headed our way; neither of which I was eager to encounter out there. Besides, I was pretty sure that the boys, having both been in the scouts, knew what I knew. Saying it out loud would only serve to annoy Lacey, and further frighten Michelle. Mikey broke his gaze that had been fixed on me, and while scanning our surroundings he said, 

“Let’s stop by the clubhouse on the way.”

With a nod from me, we continued. As soon as we arrived at our pit stop, Lacey hobbled over to the nearest lawn chair and plopped herself down in it. 

“Ugh, my feet are *killing* me!” 

“*I wonder why…*” I muttered under my breath.

“Excuse me, what was that?”

“Just saying. Those shoes are gonna be the death of you Lace, you can barely walk in them.” 

“Pshh, shut up. They fit fine, I just need to break them in is all. You’re just jealous cuz you’re still wearing your dirty old Vans from last year.”

“Ooh yeah, you got me there. I am *so sad* I don’t have a pair of ugly ass pink sketchers that don’t fit me.” 

She stuck her tongue out at me, then we both laughed. I was the only one who could really go toe to toe with Lacey’s sass. It’s part of the reason we ended up being BFFs, in addition to being neighbors. Regarding style, personality and interests, we were almost polar opposites, but when it came to quick-witted humor and insults, we were equals. More importantly though, she and I had a mutual understanding and acceptance when it came to our differences. Neither one of us tried to change the other, so it just worked. I was just about the only person who ever really stood up to Lacey too; I didn’t back down or take any of her crap like most others did, so I think she respected that. 

While that exchange had been going on, Michelle had begun picking tiny pink flowers, and I could hear the boys rummaging for something inside the clubhouse. I yelled over in their direction,

“Hey, Big Mike and Dirty D!!”

Lacey and I giggled, and she mouthed the word ‘big’ with air quotation marks. They didn’t respond, so I approached the entryway and looked in. They were standing with their backs toward me, looking down at a large open metal box, and Mikey was reaching down to grab whatever was in it. I walked inside, and as he stood back up, I could see what it was. 

“What the fuck, Mikey! Seriously??”

Hearing my expletive, Lacey and Michelle ran over and crowded in behind me. 

“Chill, it’s just a BB gun.”

“I’m not stupid, I know it’s a BB gun Michael, what are *you* doing with it, and why is it *here*?”

I was livid at the thought that he might be going out there and shooting at animals just to be a shithead. I expected something like that from a goober like Devin, but not Mikey. Right on cue, Michelle butted in to say,

“I’m telling mom!!!”

“Nice try, Dad knows I have it.” 

He looked at me, then softened his tone. 

“Look, it’s just for protection. In case we run into a black bear or some weirdo creep out here. Seriously, it’s just to scare something off, not hurt it.” 

“Unless it *is* some weirdo creep, then we’ll blast ‘em to high heaven! Bears get a pass though…” Devin laughed, breaking the tension.
 
Mikey knew how I felt about killing animals, especially for no good reason. A lot of folks in Trillium are poor and hunt for food, which I could accept as an unfortunate reality of living in a rural mountain town. But hurting animals just for fun is psychopathic behavior, so I was relieved to hear him dispel my fear over it. I really didn’t want to have to hate him. 

“Do you even know how to shoot that thing?” Lacey asked. 

“Yeah, my dad showed me.”

Devin obnoxiously clapped his hands together loudly, making us all jump and himself laugh, then said,  

“Well, alright losers, let’s get going!” 

I turned to Michelle, still holding the flowers in her hand. 

“You okay?” I asked.

She nodded. 

“If you want me to walk back with you, I can.” 

I was slightly hoping she’d say yes, just so I’d have an excuse to bail, but she just shook her head and forced a smile. I knew how scared she was, but she was just too curious. Maybe I was too.

We walked for what felt like half an hour, much longer than we had expected our excursion to take us. The woods had become more dense, and the path narrowed from the overgrowth. Still no birdsong. I kept scanning the area in search of any signs of life other than us; looking for the movement of creatures scurrying away, listening for the sounds of rustling as we passed, hoping for a squirrel, a lizard… even a bug. *Nothing.*

“How much further is this damn thing?” Lacey groaned. 

Mikey answered without even turning around. 

“Should be coming up on it any time now.”

“You said that like 10 minutes ago.” 

“Yeah, and now we’re like 10 minutes closer to it. Oh, and hey, guess what? *You* insisted on inviting yourself, so suck it up, buttercup.”

Devin laughed like a maniac at Mikey’s quip. Lacey folded her arms across her chest, and for once in her life, didn’t have a snappy comeback locked and loaded. This time however, I did. 

“Well, we really only came along to make sure you idiots don’t kill yourselves out here.” 

“Oh really? So you girls came with us to be *our* protectors, huh?” Devin asked, sarcastically. 

“Eh, more like babysitters.” I shot back. 

Needless to say, I was flipped off for that statement, but it shut him up for the time being, at least. We rounded the next bend, and suddenly all came to a screeching halt, one after another, starting with Mikey. Devin positioned himself beside Mikey on the trail, and let out a disappointed groan.

“Shit Mikey…”

An enormous tree had fallen and was lying a few feet ahead of us, blocking the trail completely. There was no way we could climb over it- too many branches and leaves. We’d have to go around it, which meant leaving the safety of the trail. But, because the tree extended out so far in both directions, it meant we would also have to cross Rain Creek twice to get back. 

“Seriously?!?!” Lacey exclaimed.

“Maybe we should just turn around.” I shrugged. 

Mikey didn’t seem phased by the obstruction at all. In fact, he seemed more confident. More calm. More certain of his intended mission. 

“It’s fine, we’ll just go around.”

“You *mean* go off-trail.” I corrected. 

Michelle, who had been mostly quiet this whole time, finally broke her fear-induced silence. She gasped, and dramatically cried out, 

“We are *not* s’pposed to leave the tr-tr-trail Michael… we could get lost!!”

“We’re not going to get lost Michelle, I have a compass. Besides, it’s just a few paces that way. We’ll just follow the tree trunk to the creek. Once we cross, we’ll circle back after we go far enough to clear the tree, cross back over, then we’re right back on the trail.”

“Oh hell no, you have *got* to be kidding me!” Lacey yelled. “I am not treading through that nasty water!”

“Yeah Mikey, what if Lacey’s brand new shoes get a droplet of water on them?” I laughed, and she slapped my arm. 

Mikey’s patience was wearing thin with us.

“Look, we’ve already walked this far. If we turn around now, we’ve wasted all this time for nothing. Now, if you girls want to be lame and  turn around, then go for it. But me and Dev are going.”

That was all Lacey needed. A challenge to accept. Someone to prove wrong. 

“I’ll show you lame.”

She pushed past the boys and led the way through the thick brush toward Rain Creek. It wasn’t very wide across, and had a ton of large rocks and fallen limbs spread throughout. The current barely was that of a trickle, and the depth was no more than knee deep for us. Definitely doable, just an inconvenience. And of course, one more ominous obstacle lying directly in our path. Another hint from the universe telling us to turn around. We didn’t listen. 

Lacey extended one foot out onto the closest limb, and pushed down a few times to test its sturdiness. 

“I got this.” 

She stepped out onto it with both feet, and carefully shimmied sideways across the limb until she was close enough to the large exposed rock in the middle of the creek, then hopped onto it. A little shaky on the dismount, but she landed it. She turned around with a full grin and asked,

“You all coming or what?”

Mikey made his way across the limb, as Lacey hopped from her rock onto another limb that led her to the bank on the other side. Devin followed, then me, and then it was Michelle’s turn. 

“I’m scared to fall in!!” She cried. 

*Of course she is, I should have made her go before me.*

“It’s okay Michelle, it’s easy! You’re not going to fall!” I reassured her. 

She didn’t look convinced in the slightest. 

“Come on Chelle, we’re leaving you!” Mikey yelled, already walking away. 

“Nooooo! I’m coming, wait!!” She squealed.

She made it across, but instead of just walking like everyone else did, she got down on her hands and knees and gripped the limb as if it were the only thing between her and a 50 foot drop to the ground. It was funny to watch, but ultimately prolonged the whole process. After all, we were going to have to do all of this again in a few minutes. 

Next go round, thankfully, went a lot smoother. The creek was a bit more shallow there, and had a lot more stepping stones and debris built up for us to use. Having just successfully crossed a few minutes ago, we were all more confident in our abilities, including Michelle, who, this time, we made go first.

“Just walk across like it’s a bridge! You got this!”

We all cheered for her, then broke out into applause when she reached the other side. Before we knew it, we were back on the trail and it wasn’t too long after, that we finally arrived at our intended destination.  

We all stopped and stared at it for a moment, carefully examining the dilapidated exterior of the place that had brought both prosperity and destruction upon our town. Mikey bent down, picked up a small rock, and threw it into the entrance. We heard it bounce a few times before it stopped. 

“Just to make sure there nothing in there.” He turned around to clarify. 

“Did anyone think to bring a flashlight?” I asked. “It’s dark as hell in there.” 

I was hoping for just one more reason to turn back. Devin reached into one of his cargo shorts pockets and pulled out a keychain flashlight, smiling with the satisfaction of finally being useful. 

“Okay, Mikey’ll hold the gun, I’ll shine the light, and you girls follow behind us. Let’s go.” 

Mikey shifted the BB gun from its position of resting on his shoulder to holding the barrel in his left hand and the butt in his right, trying his best to emulate a soldiers stance. Something his dad had taught him, I’m sure. We ducked down a bit to enter. 

“How far in are we going?” Lacey asked. 

“Until we see something cool.” Mikey replied. 

I turned around to check on Michelle, who was still hovering in the entrance. 

“You coming?” I asked her.

I could see that fear had gotten the better of her, and curiosity had now taken a backseat. With wide eyes, she shook her head. 

“The Locust Man lives in th-th-there...” She tried to whisper.

“I *knew* you were going to be a baby about this!” Mikey yelled. 

I crouched down and put my hand on her shoulder. Against my better judgment, I said, 

“How about you just wait here for us and pick some more flowers. We won’t be long, there’s nothing in there, I promise. Just… don’t move from this spot and we’ll be right back, okay?”

I could feel her unease, but she seemed to accept my suggestion nonetheless, and replied,

“Okay.” 

I smiled at her, then stood up and looked down at my watch to check the time. 

*12:46 PM*

I turned and hurried in, trying to catch up with everyone else. I didn’t feel good about leaving Michelle, but I didn’t exactly feel good about letting the others go in there alone either. And if I’m being honest, maybe a little part of me wanted to see what was in there too. 

When I caught up to Lacey, she asked where Michelle was. 

“Stayed back at the entrance.” I said. “Too scared.”

“Pshh, figures.” Lacey laughed. 

“Yeah. How’s your feet?”

“At this point numb, actually.” 

The darkness was so thick that even Devin’s rinky-dink flashlight illuminated the area well enough for me to start inspecting my surroundings. I glanced around at the ancient-looking rock walls as I walked. They were covered in what looked like orange mold and green moss. There was a slight breeze coming in from the entrance, but the whole place still had an overwhelming staleness to it. The boys stopped and turned around as we approached the first turn. 

“So ladies, what do you think? Cool huh?” Devin asked excitedly.

“Smells like a fart in here.” I said.

The most dangerous thing about exploring an abandoned mine wasn’t getting lost in the maze of tunnels, or even tripping on the rusted tracks and slamming your head against the wall. It was something simply referred to as “bad air”. One type is caused by air getting trapped in a pocket and becoming stagnant; the old men in town referred to it as “black damp”. Another was something produced from the old chemicals the miners used down there, called “stink damp.” Both of which were lethal, and what’s worse, you may not even realize you’re breathing bad air until it’s too late. 

“I wonder if there are dead bodies in here!” Devin said. 

“Uh, Dev, *we* are going to be the dead bodies in here if we go in too far. I wasn’t just making a joke, that fart smell can mean bad air.” I said.

“The entrance isn’t far behind us, there’s still plenty of fresh air coming in. We won’t go in too far.” Mikey interjected, then grabbed Devin’s flashlight from him and took a few steps forward to look ahead. “The tunnel splits off a little ways down there. Let’s just go to the end and look around a bit, then we can turn around.” 

I moved in closer to see what he was talking about. The fork in the tunnel really *wasn’t* that much further. Even though I knew that once we rounded this curve I wouldn’t be able to see the entrance behind me anymore, I decided *what the hell*. Maybe a hundred more steps, then we could finally turn around and this whole stupid situation would be closer to being over with. 

When we got there, we all leaned forward to look down the connecting tunnels each way. Everything seemed to be covered in a fine black powder, and looked unusually identical in its deterioration. I could see just how easily someone could become disoriented and lost down there. 

“Helloooooo!” Mikey yelled to the left, his voice echoing through the corridor. 

Devin turned toward the opposite direction and called out, 

“Hey yo! Locust Man! You in here?!?!” 

We all giggled at the mention of our local urban legend, which instantly brought my mind back to Michelle, still at the entrance waiting for us, alone in the woods. I looked down at my watch. 

*12:46 PM*

“Hey, what the fu-“

My cuss word was abruptly interrupted by a loud bang that had come from the passageway Devin had just been hollering into. We all froze. I didn’t have time to process that my watch had stopped right as we entered the mine, or that Michelle had been left alone for God knows how long now, or even that we just heard what sounded like a support beam crashing to the ground, because next… a horrifying screech pierced through the stillness, unlike any earthly sound I’d ever heard. It seemed distant at first, but was quickly increasing in volume, revealing a buzzing undertone to the sound. 

We looked around at each other in terror, then began backing away slowly, utterly stunned at what we were hearing. Mikey never took his eyes off of the tunnel though. Slowly, he began to raise the BB gun to firing position. Without even thinking, I grabbed the barrel and quickly shoved it downward. He tore his eyes away from his target to look at me, and I shook my head, barely managing to choke out a single word. 

“Explosion…”

He nodded, and I let go. I looked down at the gun in his hands, and seeing his finger had already been on the trigger, I realized how lucky it was that I didn’t make him shoot himself in the foot. Suddenly, the noise just… stopped. 

“What in the hell was *that*?” Lacey asked. 

“I don’t know, nothing good.” I replied. “Let’s just get the fuck out of here before the whole place caves in on us or something.”

As soon as the words left my mouth, another loud bang erupted from the right extremely close to us this time. So close that it sent a shockwave through the ground below our feet.

“Shit!!!!!”

We all turned around and ran as fast as we could back toward the entrance. Devin tried to push his way past me, but as he did, my elbow knocked the flashlight out of his hand. 

“Fuck! My flashlight!!”

“Leave it! The turn is right up there, we won’t need it!” Mikey shouted. 

We rounded the corner, and using what little light was illuminating from the entrance to guide us, we ran like our lives depended on it. And they may have… none of us dared to look back. Not like we would have been able to see anything anyway. 

When we finally made it out, we were all completely out of breath. I felt like I was going to throw up. I have to admit tho, once I realized nothing was chasing us, I felt a rush of adrenaline, like I had just had a near death experience. We all let out a few breathless laughs, and I felt a sense of relief and accomplishment that we had come out of this adventure unscathed. That feeling instantly turned into sheer panic when I looked around and realized… Michelle was no where to be seen.

“Uh, where’s Michelle?” Mikey asked me.

“I-I told her to stay right here. She can’t be very far… Michelle!!!!” 

We all called her name as loud as we could. No response. No sign of her anywhere. 

“Alright look, she probably just wandered off a little further looking for flowers to pick.” I tried to rationalize. “Let’s just split off in four different directions and walk in a straight line while we call for her. She’s bound to hear one of us.” 

Everyone agreed, and even though I appeared to be the level-headed calm person you need to take control during an emergency, truth was, I was *petrified* that something had happened to her, and that whatever it was would be my fault. I took the east and headed out, my anxiety level increasing with every passing second. 

*I can’t believe I was stupid enough to leave her by herself. What was I thinking?!?! If something happens to her, Mikey will never forgive me.*

Fortunately, it didn’t take too long before I passed a large tree and discovered her sitting down behind it, staring at something on the ground in front of her that I couldn’t see. 

“Michelle!! *Oh, thank God!* Didn’t you hear us calling for you?” 

She didn’t answer me, or even turn around. 

“Dammit, Michelle! Didn’t I tell you to stay by the entrance and not move?!?!” 

My relief was fading into annoyance as she continued to ignore me. I walked up closer to see what she was looking at on the ground, and my mouth dropped open when I saw what she had found. 

It was a single white trillium. 

They say it takes 8 years for a trillium plant to produce a flower, and conditions have to be *just* right; that’s what makes them so rare, especially around these parts. I gazed down at it in complete amazement- almost in a trance, as if I were seeing some kind of mythical creature. 

Michelle began to slowly reach out her hand towards the flower, and I snapped out of it. 

“No!!” I yelled, then grabbed her by the arm which finally made her turn around to look at me. “If you pick the flower, the plant dies.” 

She ripped her arm away from my grasp. 

“But I wanna show my mom!!” 

We heard Mikey calling from the north, and I cupped my hands around my mouth to yell,

“I found her! She’s over here!!”

I looked back at her and said, 

“No Michelle, come on. You can just tell her about it when you get home.”

I had enough. I was ready to go, and we probably had at least another 45 minutes of walking just to get back to the clubhouse; an hour if Michelle kept up her crap. I grabbed ahold of her arm once again and pulled her up to a standing position, stealing one more look at the trillium as I walked her away. 

Mikey caught up to us, completely out of breath, but trying to hide his concern with anger. 

“You little shit! We should have left your ass out here. What the hell were you doing?”

I let go of her arm, and she ran over to Mikey excitedly. 

“She was trying to pick a flower over there.”

“It was a trillium!” Michelle squealed. 

“Wait… for real?” He asked me. 

I opened my mouth, but before I could respond, a blood-curdling scream echoed through the trees, coming from the west. 

It was Lacey… 

My heart dropped into my stomach, and every molecule in my body instantaneously shifted back into full-blown panic mode. This time, I couldn’t contain my composure. 

“Laceyyyyyyy!!!”

A panicked shriek erupted from my lungs, and I took off running. Mikey picked up Michelle and sprinted after me. All of the trees and bushes around me became a single blur, I didn’t even feel any of the scrapes and scratches. 

*Had she encountered a pack of coyotes? A mountain lion? A bear??* 

I didn’t even care about the potential danger I thought I might be about to expose myself to, I just ran. And then… I found her. She was lying on the ground motionless, holding her left foot. 

“Lacey!” I screamed, trying to choke back the tears building up in my eyes. 

“Ugh, I think I broke my ankle!”

“Oh God dammit, you *bitch*. I thought you were dead!!”

“I might as well be! I have cheerleading practice on Monday!”

Mikey and Michelle caught up to us. He set her down and asked me what happened. 

“She’s being a drama queen. She just rolled her damn ankle.” 

I was pissed off. 

“Can you get up?” He asked her. 

She was able to lift herself off of the ground and stand with Mikey holding her arm, but as soon as she tried to put any pressure at all on the ankle, she screamed out in pain. We spotted Devin running over from the south, as he yelled,

“Yo! Everyone alive and accounted for?”

“Yeah, we got Michelle, but Lacey hurt her ankle.” Mikey answered.

As he approached, he actually looked concerned. Was this going to be the first time Devin didn’t try to turn something into a joke? 

“Can you walk on it?” He asked her. 

“No.” She whimpered. 

Without any hesitation, he replied, 

“Alright then, looks like you’re gonna have to piggyback it all the way home. Come on, hop up.” 

He turned around and lowered himself enough for her to climb onto his back. Mikey pulled out his compass to make sure we were heading east, and started back toward the mine. Devin followed close behind, carrying Lacey. We collectively decided Michelle had to walk in front of me so we didn’t lose her again, which put me last in the group, leaving me with a persistently paranoid urge to turn around and look behind me. Even though my nerves had started to settle a bit, I knew we were still far from being out of the woods yet, in more ways than one.
