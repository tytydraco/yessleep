I'm A Big Game Hunter Sponsored By The Government, Here's What My Agency Doesn't Want You To Know-

Part One- Skunk Ape 

First Hunt - December 19th, 1999, Swamps of Florida - 

My first ever hunt. I'll never forget it. I was licensed with a government sponsored agency to hunt a creature called the Skunk Ape. I had no idea what cryptids were at the time, but I did think it was odd that they were having me hunt for an ape in the Swamps of Florida.

Just to set some things straight- I was 21, broke, loved hunting and traveling, so when some suit approached me telling of a job that offered exactly that- I jumped in it.

“Well hey there stranger. Odd dress for this part of Kentucky.” We were in the middle of the woods, and here this guy came up, dressed in a brown suit and pants, looking like he was getting ready for a business meeting, briefcase and all.

“I've heard you're one of the top hunters in your area.” The man said, an affable smile on his face.

“I don't know about all that,” I said, “why?”

“What if I told you I had a job that was nothing but hunting rare, big game.” Now I was intrigued.

“How rare?”

He smiled, “Very rare.”

That was the start of a wonderful business relationship with a man whose name I still have yet to find out. In my head, I always called him Mr. E, just to be funny.



Anyways, I was brought to this room which looked like a police interrogation room. Mr. E and another man, #2 I called him, asked me a whole bunch of questions, and this was the first time that I had ever heard of a ‘cryptid.’

“Have you ever hunted anything that no one believes in, a concept?”

“What…what does that even mean?”

“Thought so.” #2 said, looking at Mr. E, then back at me,

“So, you've never heard of cryptozoology?”

“No, I can't say that I have.”

“Well, in short, it is the study of things said to not exist, except in mythology and folklore.”

It was a long conversation that I'll spare you the details of, but they wanted me to hunt for these things that don't exist. They said that they would give me a location, drop me off, and pick me up either when the job was done, or when they put my casket in the ground. They also said that I may or may not be working in a group on certain outings. I was about to tell them off, when they wrote down a number, and slid the piece of paper my way. I looked back at them, amazed, thinking that that would be more money than I would ever see. They said that's what I make for each successful capture, and I get to keep the body, after they've seen it, recorded it, and filed it. I agreed on the spot.



Later, they dropped me off in the woods of Florida, with a map, and all of the equipment I said I required. They had me sign a bunch of paperwork, some about confidentiality, some about equipment needed, and one saying that I was briefed on what I'd be hunting.

What I was hunting was called the Skunk Ape, a creature of folklore and myth. It is a cousin of sorts to Bigfoot, and resides in the swamps of Florida, with it being named a ‘Skunk’ Ape because of the odor it emits, similar to a skunk. ‘Should be easy to tell when it's close,’ I thought, not realizing the incredible feat that was ahead of me.

They gave me some money, in case I was out here for longer than I thought and was in need of extra supplies. A burner phone to report either a failed hunt, or a request for extraction. Mr. E said that either he or #2 would always be by the phone. Now that I look back at it, how did they know that I called him #2?

I remember being anxious then. I didn't know who I was working for, I didn't know how I would look for something that isn't supposed to exist, and I didn't know how long I would be gone for. But I pushed all that down. I thought of the money. I thought of what it could do for my family. I could finally take care of my mother like I promised my father before he passed. All these things, as well as my pride as a hunter, pushed down all feelings of doubt or fear.

So on I trudged, pushing deep into the thorny thicket, hoping that this hunt wouldn't be a long one. 

It was. It was a very long one. Months on months, verging on a year actually. I still remember the first time I smelled skunk. I nearly shit myself. I think the bastard could tell that I was on the hunt for it. Either that, or I had stayed in its woods for too long, and it didn't care why I was there. Regardless, it knew I was there. 

I was in the swamp long enough to build a nice little shelter, with all the amenities. I bought a lot of stuff, built a lot of stuff, and eventually considered myself a professional in swamp hunting. I grew very familiar with the taste of crocodile. It tastes like chicken, feels like veal. One of the biggest threats in the Everglades is snakes. They pop right out at you when you least expect it. They were what I was most scared of for the first few months.

There was more than just one Skunk Ape. And there was definitely more than just the Skunk Apes out there. I learned through the locals of something called a Wampus Cat, a six-legged mountain lion who some say has colonies in Florida after migrating from Appalachia, and tended to lurk in overlapping hunting grounds of itself and the Ape. Then, further North, is the Bardin Booger, who may be a relative of what I'm hunting for. He didn't have anything to do with the hunt that I was on, so I paid him no mind. Then there were the skinwalkers that were spread all over the country, as far as I was told. I prayed long and hard I wouldn't have to run into one of those.

These stories spooked me, as I didn't know what I'd run into, now that these suits told me these cryptid things were real. 

Over time, I began to get it. Improve the shelter one day, hunt the next, repeat. I started to see more and more signs of the thing. Footprints that were a bit too large, the smell of skunks where there shouldn't be, and hair. A lot of hair. Like, a metric shit-ton of hair. It wasn't the black and white that the name made me expect it to be, but a deep, reddish brown, with an even worse scent up close. I always had my hunting rifle loaded, my AR strapped to my torso, and my revolver holstered. 


I remember one night, that for as long as I lived, I will never forget. There is a rule in the woods, the farther something sounds, the closer it is, unless it's right outside. Well, my tent was surrounded by some pretty good traps, as far as dumb animals. But if an intelligent creature came anywhere near me, I was finished.


One night, while sleeping, I was woken up by a shrill, cutting screaming, deep in the woods. The noise shocked me out of my cot, so violently that I hit my head on my wood roof. I was suddenly glad that I had four walls around me, as something began to slam on the walls so hard, it sounded like someone was putting all of their weight into breaking down the Lincoln Log like structure. Then, all of a sudden, it stopped. And as quick as it stopped, it started again, but this time, at the door, tugging at the knob, twisting it, slamming into the door, and the howling. This thing was screaming a mix of a tortured fox and a gorilla getting his balls stepped on. I grabbed my gun and aimed for the door, ready for a reddish brown hand to emerge through the weakly reinforced entrance. When I installed the door, I didn't expect to be hunted myself.

Another stop… another long wait… then, from right behind me, a succession of three rapid knocks, right level with my head. I jumped, and considered grabbing the burner phone they gave me, and hoping that I could hold out until help arrived. But then the thought of a failed hunt crossed my mind. The idea of this thing trying to scare me out of my reputation, it pissed me off.

I slammed the door open, turned the corner, gun aimed, and came face to face with the ugly son of a bitch. A face more like a man than the ape it was named after, canines taking the form of almost tusks, stained a disgusting green-and-yellow brown color. Its eyes bloodshot, pupils a chocolate shade of brown. A wide nose occupied the center of its face, nostrils inhaling and exhaling deeply.

Now, what I wish I could tell you is that I shot the thing, killed it, and got out of there. I. Wish. Instead, what actually happened is that we both froze, and I, shocked by seeing the thing that had haunted me for months in person, slightly dropped my gun, and then fired at its legs, completely missing the kill shot. What's worse, is that its skin is so hard that one of the bullets ricocheted off of its foot, hitting me in the shins.

To my surprise, the beast ran away instead of taking my head off. I went back inside to get my medical kit and fix myself up.



It was many months before I saw the Skunk Ape again. In the time it took to find it, I got called about another, easier hunt that I could undertake, for less money, of course. They told me to hunt down a giant hog that was supposed to reside near where I camped. I didn't ask how they knew where I was camped. I didn't want to know.

The hunt for the hogs was easy enough, find the giant hoof prints, follow the direction they were going, and boom, you had yourself a giant hog. Turns out that the problem lies within their being more than one. There seemed to be a whole herd of them, all sleeping together, hunting together, and eating together. I watched them, studied them, and came to the conclusion that these weren't the cryptids that the agency thought that they were. I called them and told them, but they just said that I hadn't found it yet. So the hunt continued. Looking for larger tracks, and then larger tracks, and so on. Eventually, I found what must've been what they were looking for. The monstrous pig stood with its shoulders towering above me at seven feet high, its head the size of a pitbull, some of its teeth bigger than my hands put together. I decided that I would need to come back with a bigger gun.

I got back with a budget 50 Cal with armor piercing rounds. If its hide was anything like the Skunk Ape, which I was betting that it was, I would need something a little heavier than buckshot.

I came back to where I had spotted Big Boris, that's what I named the big pig, and came to find that its area was empty, void of all traces that it or its clan had been there in the first place. Just then, I got a call on my phone. #2 told me that I was to find and kill not only Big Boris, but also the pigs it traveled with, as they would also grow to his size. I was freaking out now, wondering how they could know that I was close to my phone, and how they knew I called him Big Boris. Almost as if he read my mind, he told me that they had cameras set up around all of their hunting grounds, so they could keep track of their hunters' progress. That calmed me down a little, but it still shook me a little that I hadn't seen any cameras the whole time I'd been there. Even now, I don't remember any cameras. I asked #2 what these things were, but he gave no inclination as to whether or not he even knew. Knowing what I know now, I wish I'd never asked.

Either way, I got back to the hunt. Day and night, it consumed me. I needed to kill one of these monsters, for my own sake, and for the sake of providing for my family.

To avoid confrontation, I tried poisoning their food supply, but turns out cryptids are too smart for that. I tried taking away their food supply, but they eat everything, and there are so many things that I can keep them away from. They really are pigs.

Eventually, I had the idea to just lure them to where I was more comfortable, in what I was now calling my part of the woods. They wouldn't budge.

So I had to go to them. I found them easy enough. If anyone is interested in cryptid hunting, it's really not that hard. All you really need is time and ambition. I found them, after weeks of being on the move non-stop, after weeks of being away from my cot, and away from the Skunk Ape, I felt like I had my groove back. I perched in the trees around their camp, and waited until they were asleep. I took aim at Big Boris, and fired. It pierced his temple area, which woke him up. I was shocked to see that he pretty much shrugged it off, but with a bit of a wobble to his walk. I fired again, and this time I missed, but he figured out where I was shooting from. Smart ass.

I hopped from my place to another branch just before he rammed his thick skull into the basement of the tree. The tree shook, leaves and pinecones falling off their branches. Boris let off a roar that reminded me of my encounter with the Skunk Ape. I believe he then attempted to climb up the tree, because it looked like the same thing that my beagle would do when she spotted a squirrel. The tree came down under Boris’ massive weight, bringing down others in its path. He brought his nose up to the air, sniffing around before spotting me taking my next shot. I shot right into his eye, hoping to see the bullet make its way out the back of his skull, but to no avail. I landed the shot perfectly, only to see him stumble a bit.

At this point the other things in his party were up and trying to get me out of my post, and I had to move before this tree came down too. I took some shots at the smaller guys, killing some, definitely injuring the rest. I moved to another spot, which didn't go unnoticed by Big Boris. He trampled one of the smaller pigs to get to me, which only angered him. He started shoving some of the other hogs, pushing his tusks into their sides, stepping on their head like the enraged tyrant he was. Some of the other pigs noticed, and I guess they had had enough of being trampled by Big Boris, as they all started to bum rush him. I took my shot in all the chaos, and landed two in his forehead, sinking the last one deep in his skull, finally ending him. There were only two left and the scrabble, and they got picked off pretty easily.

Then, I saw him. Standing just barely out of sight, the Skunk Ape. Apparently drawn here by his compatriots’ dying cries, came to see what all of the commotion was, when he found me. I had run all out of ammo, and had dropped some of my other guns which were then stepped all over, so all I had was my revolver and a silver knife I had bought out of superstition. I rapid fired three shots right into his gut, which made him lurch over in pain, before running up to him and gutting him with my knife. He aimed a sloppy punch at my head, which I jumped back to dodge, not wanting to get touched by the creature, its long nails forming deadly claws.

I thought he bled out after trying to run at me a few more times, and I called for extraction.

Truth is, while I was waiting for extraction, I let my guard down and turned away from the Ape, exhausted after being awake and on the hunt for almost a full day. When I turned back, the body of the ape was gone, not even a trail to track him by. As I started to make way for where I thought he had gone, a team of well armed men showed up, ready to take me in for extraction. I tried to tell them that the ape had gotten away, but they insisted that they would send out another hunter, or maybe even myself later on, but that I had killed Big Boris, and that that was enough for now. Someone would come along for extraction.

To this day, I still haven't returned to the Florida Everglades. Because as we were leaving that place, and those woods…I was sure we were being watched.

End of Part One
