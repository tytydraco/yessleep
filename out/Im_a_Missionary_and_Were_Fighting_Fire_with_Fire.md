Cassara growled from her kneeling position, “How did you fucking find me?!” She narrowed her eyes, “Did the fucking bitch Lydia sell me out?!”

“Really, Cassara?” Ragna lifted an eyebrow, “Denial isn’t very becoming on you.”

Cassara’s face fell as she hissed, “Launa…”

I tried to reach Cassara before Madison grabbed my shoulder roughly, “Cass-”

Madison blocked me, grabbing my wrist.

I glared at her, looking away from my hand as she squeezed it.

Madison’s resolve broke slightly as she started to squeeze my hand harder.

No more pain than usual came from my hand, but I was concentrating on keeping my eyes fixed on Madison.  If I did that, I wouldn’t notice whatever it was she was doing to my hand.

“Captain,” Ragna called out, “That’s enough!”

Capt. Madison looked at Ragna, surprised, “Ragna?” 

I was surprised at the slightly informal address between Ragna and her Captain, before Ragna’s voice caught my attention.

“He’s not some well trained monk with a high pain tolerance,” Ragna said with a short laugh, “his hand is clearly numb.”

I blinked, turning to Ragna, surprised. 

Ragna’s expression was bold, smug, and above all else: Proud.

“It wasn’t your face’s lack of movement or ticks that was your tell,” Ragna informed, “Rather it was the lack of reflexes that otherwise normally occur in the elbow upon having your hand twisted in such a manner,” Ragna gave a bemused smile, “You grow more intriguing by the moment, little mortal.”

I felt Madison release my arm before she grabbed my shoulder to force me to my knees, “Sorry Ragna.”

“It’s fine,” Ragna said as she took a few more heavy steps, towards Cassara and me.

I looked up at the towering figure of Ragna, all the more imposing when I was forced to my knees.  The boots she wore were completely flat, and she wore slacks that appeared part of a ceremonial uniform, complete with a brass buckle. 

“Now,” Ragna began as she looked down at us, “We tried the carrot,” she said as she looked at Cassara, “now it seems we have to resort to the stick.”

“I can’t believe Launa sold me out,” Cassara hissed.

“Sold you out?” Ragna scoffed, “Dear, she’s the one who wanted you back,” Ragna shook her head, “Retrieving you is part of our elaborate deal for the evaluation of the House of Hestia.”

I narrowed my eyes on Ragna, “So you don’t give a shit about the people in Penthasil, do you?!”

Ragna’s head snapped to face me at stunning speed, her long braid flung to the other side as her eyes narrowed on mine, her smile faded, “Do *not* speak that which you know nothing of, *child*.” 

I felt my throat seize up as she spoke.

Ragna took a steady inhale, her chest filling with air, causing the buttons of her jacket to strain before she let it out slowly through her nostrils, her smug smile returning.  “The people of Penthasil are my beloved subjects, and soon Penthasil shall conquer the world.”

I growled at Ragna, “You think you can take over the whole world?  How do you plan on that?” I demanded.

“Do not think me fool enough to reveal my master-stroke to every pawn that happens to cross my path,” Ragna scoffed, before she turned to Cassara.

“So, I’m part of some deal with Launa?” Cassara said, her eyes cast to the floor.

“Indeed,” Ragna said as she sank down onto the balls of her feet, her huge wings looming over Cassara and me as she crouched down before us.  “Your sister’s a rather shrewd woman, Cassara,” Ragna taunted as she lifted Cassara’s chin so that she could look Cassara in the eye, "it seems the daughters of Rhea are a rather stubborn lot.” 

Cassara was about to spit before Ragna slipped her hand over Cassara’s mouth

“But not unpredictable,” Ragna’s thumb and forefinger rested just under Cassara’s nose as she fixed  Cassara with a firm gaze, “Now all that is left is to recover you. A shame that Major Tanya couldn’t make short work of you, would have saved me some trouble.” 

“Yeah well, next time send someone who can handle a hand to hand fight,” Cassara quipped.

“That is precisely why *I* am here,” Ragna said as she stood up, releasing Cassara’s face, “One failure is enough for me to reconsider the cost of my endeavors.  No more minions or fiddling about with whom can and cannot handle your potency.” Ragna lowered her face to Cassara, her nose just a few inches from Cassara’s “Taking the matter into my own hands,  to ensure there’s no mistakes this time.”

“Is she even wort’ the trouble?” I heard the cockney voice of Rasper burst through the room. 

Ragna turned to Rasper, her face not amused, “Excuse you, Rasper?”

“Aye mean as little disrespect as possible,” Rasper said as he motioned to Captain Madison, “But this one took her down easy ‘nuff.”

Ragna paused as she looked between Madison and Cassara, “I’d consider that further enhancement from the bit of my essence within her,” Ragna thought out loud.  

“What?!” Cassara said, turning to Captain Madison, “She’s why you’re like this?!”

Capt. Madison looked down to Cassara, “Yes.”

“Why did you agree to that?!” Cassara shouted.

“I was tired of being the American Girl, tired of getting kicked around,” Madison smiled, “No regrets, by the way.” 

“Yes, though for the rest of the soldiery I’ll be drawing back the potency,” Ragna scoffed, “Hard enough sharing part of myself with Maddy.”

Madison narrowed her eyes on Ragna, “Oh it’s not so bad, Sellenia.”

Ragna shot Madison a glare.

Madison, to my shock, was unphased.

“Touche,” Ragna said as she chuckled, “*Madison*.”

Madison smiled back and nodded.  

“Regarding Casssara,” Ragna said as she turned to Rasper, “I could always use someone in tune with the spirit world. I’ve heard she can use magic, specifically fire.”

The mention of spirit world snapped me out of my stunned stupor.  

I felt stupid.  I didn’t have to be pinned down where I was and useless.

I wondered, briefly, if I could do to Ragna what I did to Esmeralda.

I closed my eyes, and what I saw wasn’t like anything before.

Blazing brightly in the room was Rasper’s body. His entire aura made it appear as if his body was on fire.  Multiple red, green, yellow and blue sprites fluttered around him.   

However the fire appeared to be moving towards Ragna’s, as if there was a strong wind blowing towards her.

I turned to Ragna, and to this day I’m not sure what it is that I saw.

Black armor covered her from head to toe.  It wasn’t the armor that was shocking.  The armor had chains wrapping around it, as if the armor was a prison containing something.

It was then I tried to see what that armor was attempting to hold back.  

The heavy armor was a matte black, the joints, however glowed with pulsing purple smoke and fire.

When I say ‘Fire’ I mean like the sort you see on the surface of the sun.

As if, roiling under this armor, was a star-like entity, burning within it.  

The visor of the armor was what cemented this concept.  

I could see Ragna’s fiery eyes from within the visor.  Her eyes blazed, but spun like smoldering plasma contained within.  

Occasionally I would watch a crest of purple and black energy erupt from her visor.  But, like a solar flare attempting to rip away from the force of the sun it spawned from, it would curl back and collapse against the armor.  

When it happened, the armor glowed slightly, before changing back to its natural matte black color.  

I shook my head, and focused my efforts, trying to throw my feathers at her, aiming at the black chains.

A hand quickly fell upon my spirit, gripping me tightly, “Oh no, do *not* do that.” 

I turned to see the face of a blond woman with rather intense, if not overly intense, amber eyes.  

To my surprise, she was existing inside of Madison, within her spirit, leaning out of her not unlike a stereotypical ghost.

“Who the fuck are you?!” I shouted.

“An absolute fan favorite,” the strange woman announced, “You don’t even know how many readers just flipped out.”

I paused, looking around, “What are you talking about?”

“Nothing,” she said as she floated in front of me, “Call me: Eris.”

I thought for a moment, trying to recall where I had heard that name. 

Eris heaved a sigh, leaning closer to me, “Come on there priest, think back to your Greek Mythology.”

“I’m not…” I tried to think of the spirits and Goddesses I could recall.

“Apple to think it over?” Eris said with a smile, offering a golden apple to me.

“Uh-” I recoiled, “Oh, *that* Eris, Goddess of-”

“Discord!” Eris said as she finished my sentence for me, though I was sure I could hear an odd ‘ding’ noise occurring from somewhere in the distance.  

“Why are you-” I tried to move further back as she floated into my face.

“No no, I get it.  You’re like: ‘Why are you trying to protect Ragna’ and I just want to say that, first: she’s my niece,” Eris said smiling.

“Your niece, who’s her mother-” Eris continued, running my sentence over.

“Listen as much fun as it would be to see *if* your little wings could break those chains, and I’m very certain they can’t,” Eris chuckled, “That whole thing doesn’t happen until the end of book 2, not the published works, mind you.” 

“What are you talking about?!” I demanded.

Eris rolled her eyes, and snapped her fingers.  A massive cloth unfurled from the ceiling and disappeared into the ground.

Its colors rushed by, and I could see some strange depictions and images, as if they were hieroglyphics.  All of them were moving fast, however, as if the tapestry were a series of frames of a stop motion film.  

“What is all of that?” I asked.

“You get used to it,” Eris said with a giggle. “I don't even see the code, All I see is blond, brunette, redhead…” Eris snickered again before she looked at my confused face, “God you are just a stick in the mud, huh?”

“Sorry?” I asked, even more confused.

“This is the Tapestry of Fate,” Eris explained, “And I’ve been able to see it for eons… You see, my goal is to ensure as much chaos and discord as possible!” 

“Uh, how do you do that?” I asked.

“The longer the tapestry the more gnarly it gets, and the more chaos!” Eris laughed, “So, I need to make sure specific events occur to prolong everything’s pain and continued suffering!”

I glared at her, “That’s an… Odd way to say you’re looking out for the entire universe.”

“Pft, no!” Eris laughed, “I just hate Entropy.” She paused, and turned to face something else, “Seriously: Fuck Belphegor!” 

I looked around, wondering if it was possible for a Goddess to be mad. 

“Anyway,” She turned back to me, patting my wings, which had no effect on her, “You are dealing with someone who is the dead center of the alignment chart.  I’m not with Lawful Evil over there,” she pointed to Ragna, “Or Chaotic Good over there,” she said as she pointed to Cassara, “I’m just right here, in the middle.”

I sighed, “Chaotic Neutral, I get it.”

“There we go!  One of those was going to land, sheesh,” Eris said, puffing a small strand of blond hair up out of her face.

“So, what is on her?” I asked, motioning to Ragna.

“Oh, her dad did that.  Got all pissy with her using her magic against him, so he locked that down,” Eris grinned, “Ol’ Hades was displeased with his daughter so… you know, locked her magic up!”

I looked to Ragna and then to Eris, “You mean that her power is contained?”

“Deaf, Dumb, and Blind in the spirit world, but when she gets out?  Oh man…” Eris grinned, “See that armor absorbs mana.  Any energy that touches it gets sucked up into it, here watch!” Eris walked over to Rasper’s form.

Rasper, for his part, turned to Eris, “The ‘ell do you tink yer doin’?”

“Oh calm down there hot head I’m only taking one to show the dum-dum,” Eris chuckled as she plucked one of the blue flame sprites from Rasper, “You’re not friends with this one, right?”

“It’s an elemental spirit, yah know damn well it’s not sentient," Rasper said, “Yah explainin’ it fer dis one?” He motioned to me.

“Well, yeah, and the readers,” Eris said with a giggle.

Rasper rolled his eyes as Eris flicked the spirit towards Ragna’s armor.

It flew towards Ragna, and as it touched the armor it was soaked into it, like a raindrop on the ground.  The armor glowed blue before slowly dulling and returning to its original color.  

“Every time a bit of mana hits that thing, it’s sucked up, and added to her power!” Eris chuckled, “Making her physically stronger as a result, since she can’t use any magic.”

“So that just made her stronger?!” I shouted.

“In much da same way a single raindrop makes da ocean deeper,” Rasper said to me, “We’re long past havn’ to worry about that kind of ting.” 

I looked to Rasper, “So what are you?”

“I’m a titan of fire, normally,” Rasper growled, his arms crossed, “Sadly me coven was broken and I’m stuck in a mostly mortal shell,” Rasper shook his head in agitation, his fiery aura growing as his rage built, “It’s hard havin’ to actually ask the spirits to do wot I want rather than just doin’ it, dey listen but,” he lamented. 

With that, Rasper snapped his finger as two more blue flame spirits appeared next to him to replace the one Eris had removed.  

It was here I saw the shackles on his wrists, neck, and ankles tied on Ragna's armor.  

I remembered what Brittney had around her body, the chains of servitude.  

“How does a Titan of Fire get enslaved to the daughter of the Devil?” I asked. 

“How indeed,” Rasper said, looking at me, “It’s a long story an’, but lets just say I ‘ave some plans should I ever break free.”

“Killing Ragna?” I asked.

Rasper’s fire rose to fill the room, my eyes widening, “Not ‘er.  Her Brotha,” Rasper’s next word sent shivers through my spirit as his flame spirits even seemed to wilt and shrink as he spoke.  “**Xyphiel.”**

Even Rasper’s own fire, though still tall and roaring, shrank back at the name.

I glanced at Cassara and Ragna, “Shit.”

“She ain’t gonna be ‘urt,” Rasper explained, “Mistress likes people like Cassara.  She’s doin’ dis as a fava to ‘er sister.”

“Why does Launa want Cassara home!?” I demanded.

“Launa’s ‘fraid Cassara’s gonna get caught in da crossfire of the war,” Rasper explained, “Can’t blame ‘er.  I’d want me own kin behind friendly lines if possible.”

“I have to protect her,” I shouted.

Rasper looked at me, then to Cassara, and gave a hard laugh, “Oy! You lot?  Wot yah tink yah gonna protect ‘er from?  A good time?”

I narrowed my eyes on him, flexing my feathers.

Rasper’s eyes caught the light of his own aura glinting off my feathers, “Oy,” he paused, “...Oh I see,” his eyes moved to Ragna’s form, “Ight.  I got dis.”

Eris giggled, “And that’s what I’m here for…” Eris slunk back towards Madison, grinning to me, “Pulling one thread… to make the tapestry just a little bit longer.”

I frowned, “A bit longer?” I asked, looking at Eris as she began to sink into Madison.

“Oh, yes,” Eris smiled wide to me, her eyes bright, “Just a bit,” she pointed, where the Tapestry stopped, high above the ceiling, “We’re close to the end, you see.  I give it two, maybe five more years as you’d expect.”

“What happens when it ends?!” I asked, eyes wide.

“That’s the best part,” Eris grinned even wider at the ‘end’ of the tapestry, unnerving me, “I have no idea!  I’m so terrified and nervous about the end coming,” she turned back to me, “It’s so exciting, isn’t it?!  Will time stop?  Will we notice?  Will Entropy rule, will Chaos?!" 

With that Eris’s maddened laugh filled the room.

“**I have no idea what’s coming!”** Eris shouted as she looked up to beyond the ceiling, her arms out wide as she sank into Madison’s spirit, “**But I can’t wait for it to arrive!  Oh the horrors and pains to await!  The deaths of millions, the torture of countless souls all to be dragged out to the very end of all eternity!!”** 

I watched as Eris sank into Madison’s body.

“What the fuck-” I said just as Eris popped out fo Madison’s spirit once more, as her finger poked my nose.

“**Boop!”** Eris announced.

I opened my eyes, back in the real world.

Rasper, in the physical world now, was still speaking to Ragna as if nothing had happened between Eris, him and me.  “Yah heard, but yah ‘aven’t seen.  Dere’s all sorts of fire mages, dis one might not be able tah do more den a light show or camp fire.”

Ragna huffed, “What are you getting at, Rasper?  I haven’t the time to waste on frivolous things,” she tapped her wrist, “There’s a consortium to get to, I need to overthrow another empire, and I’m rather certain Rachel’s off doing something to cause me some indigestion later.”

Rasper grinned, “Well how’s dis den, I’m sure yah don’t need to be at the consortium, an yah need data on Cassara anyway, don’t yah?”

Ragna sighed, crossing her arms, “I do.  Hard to determine where she’d slot into the whole mix.”

“So let ‘er ‘ave me as a punchin’ bag and yah can record the data.  See how she fights, I mean,” Rasper grinned, his face looking at Cassara and I, “If she can’t take the likes of me down, in me weakened state, why even bother takin’ ‘er.”

Ragna laughed, “And after that tid bit why would the girl try to fight you in any serious capacity?  She’d likely lose just to escape.”

Rasper looked to Cassara and then to Ragna, “An’ is dat the kind of warrior yah need?”

Ragna considered things for a moment, “Fair enough point,” she pulled a small black orb from her pocket, letting go of it around her eye level.

I watched as the small black marble was surrounded in a red translucent cube as it floated in the air, “Yes Mistress Ranga?” a clear male voice called out.

“Will Launa fare just fine without my presence at the Consortium, Rage?” Ragna asked the small floating device.

The red cube floated one way and then the other before the voice echoed from within it, “Yes.  In fact I would advise against you going to the Consortium.  Your presence may dissuade some of the audience who would otherwise believe Launa’s farce that the House of Hestia would return their people to their ‘Traditional’ values.” 

“Hmm,” Ragna said as she walked away from Cassara and me, “Rage, lock the room down against physical and fire damage.”

I watched as the black orb pulsed twice.  

The first pulse caused a sheen to appear on the ground, walls, and furniture.  The second pulse caused the orb to glow with a strange fiery symbol, making the sheen flicker red before it went invisible again.

I closed my eyes once more.

The orb appeared very much like any other inanimate object I had seen.  But written along it were a number of shifting and mixing runic letters.  One of those letters glowed against the walls, ceiling, and floor.

I opened my eyes, turning to Cassara, who still looked dejected.  “Cass, snap out of it!”

“I just got stabbed in the back by my own sister,” Cassara hissed, as I saw tears drip down her nose, “Give me a second, okay?”

I flinched.

“Indeed Cassara,” Ragna said, “Snap out of it.  I’m going to need you to show me exactly what I’m exerting this effort for.”

Cassara growled, “fuck you!” Cassara shouted as she got to her feet.

“There we are,” Ragna said with a half smile, “That’s the spirit.” 

Rasper walked in front of Cassara and me now, "Alright, Girlie,” he grinned, “Let’s see what yah got.”

Cassara glared at Rasper, looking to Ragna, “After I beat down your little blimey bilge rat, I’m coming after you.”

“Oy, Girlie, lets keep what yah bitten’ off in chewin’ distance, yah?” Rasper said, “Now, show me yours and I show yah mine.”

Cassara lifted up her fists, both igniting in blue flame, “I’ve gotten better at this, just to warn you.”

Rasper narrowed his eyes on her, looking to her fiery fists as he took a step back, “I want to see you bring all of it, girl.  Come on, no fuckin’ around,” he motioned to the room, “Rooms protected and reinforced.  Ain’t no need to hold back.  Yah ain’t burning anyone outside of this room.”

Cassara looked at me out of the corner of her eye.

Rasper rolled his eyes and snapped his fingers.  

I watched a rune similar to the one that came from the red square fly towards me and hit me in the chest.

“Including dat one,” Rasper growled, “Now, come on den, show me what yah got!”

Cassara shifted slightly, her eyes narrowing as the flames grew slightly on her fists.

Rasper grabbed the air in front of him, a fiery spear appearing out of nowhere.  He slammed its point down next to him.

My eyes went wide as I saw the spear was very much a physical thing, in a way, but generated entirely by the flame sprites that floated around Rasper.  

“Woah…” Cassara said, eyes wide, “How did you-”

“I asked,” Rasper narrowed his eyes, “Yah don’t know how, do yah?”

Cassara paused, before she shook her head.

“Fine den!” Rasper shouted as he turned to Ragna, “I’mma give ‘er a handicap.”

Ragna nodded, “Rage, being data collection.”

The red cube pulsed, “Collection beginning.”

“Is… that a computer?” I asked, shocked.

“Yes, a bit of my own design software wise,” Ragna said with a smile, “This is Rage. He’s extremely useful, now,” Ragna said as she looked at Cassara, “No holding back.”

“This is all I’ve got, okay?” Cassara snapped, “It’s more than enough.”

“Nah, it ain’t, but don’t worry, iffin’ ya’ don’t know how ta’ ask, I’ll ask fer yah,” Rasper said as he snapped his fingers.

“Ask who-” Cassara’s eyes went wide as she screamed.

I had to take a step back as Cassara was surrounded by blue fire.  Her clothing singed at the edges, but her fists were covered in massive balls of blue and white flame, her eyes pulsing with a maroon fire as her long black hair wafted up from the heat rising.

“Cassara!” I shouted.

Cassara gasped, looking at her hands, her glowing maroon eyes open wide in shock, “What the fuck are you?!”

A fiery shield with a cut at the top appeared in Rasper’s opposite hand, as he was wreathed in red flames.

The fire surrounded his face, wreathing his bald head in a fiery Greco-Roman helmet, complete with a long fringe of a Mohawk across his head.  His feet, chest, waist and arms were also wreathed in fire that appeared like ancient armor.  “I am the Spartan who held the King of Macedonia at bay!  I’m the Titan of Flame, forged by the Great Alexander and bound to His name!”  Rasper grinned wide, “Ya’ facin’ Rasper of the Alexandratta, now lil’ girl.”

Cassara glared at Rasper, composing herself, “I don’t care who you are.  I’m not going to throw at fight just to get out of a bind.  So prepare to die.”

“Oy,” Rasper’s grin grew, as he sank into a fighting stance, his spear pointing at Cassara, “Dat’s the [spirit](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Guardian_Temple/).”
