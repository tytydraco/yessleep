[So, I’m done with the store.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1hhi5g7/should_i_take_the_offer/)



Regardless of what happens from now on, I’m moving on. And move on, I have, because that interview was certainly something. Hell, the whole place was anything but typical! When I checked Google Maps for the area (it’s located at 1324 \*\*\*\*\* St), it just went staticky. No matter what I did, I couldn’t get a clear picture of the area, but I *could* get directions. So it’s not all bad, at least.



The area was pretty, with tiny little lakes all around, shrouded and covered by dense fog, with beautiful weeping willow trees drooping over the lake, casting stunning shadows, and the midday sun! Gosh, it was like a Bob Ross painting! I mean, just the sounds as I drove up, from the birds chirping to the sounds of skittering wildlife. It contrasted starkly with what I saw a few days ago. At least until I get his name, I’ll call him ‘Jack Frost,’ after the mythical being of the same namesake.



Upon entering, I was greeted by a well-dressed individual who looked to be in his mid-20s, hardly older than myself. Standing around 6’0” tall, he said, “Hello, Sir! How may I help you today?”



I approached the desk and said, “Ah, hi! I’m here for a job interview. Is this for the ‘In-House’ Therapist position you're offering?” I presented the poster to him, and as his fingers grasped it, I watched it crumble into dust.



He shook his hands of the dust and then stated, “Ah yes, I see the chief has decided to recommend you for your unique qualities? Ah, I do wonder what he means by that? Are you aware?” as the words left his mouth, I felt my heart hitch in my chest, as it began to beat faster, not painfully so, but in the same manner as when you see someone you know makes you safe.



I stammered ou,t “Ah! N… No.. I’m sorry, I don’t know what that means.” By some luck, I resisted divulging my encounter in the store. But as I finished speaking, I watched the man in front of me give me a slight stare and sly smile.



“Ah, I see, now I understand. Well, it’s a pleasure to meet you; please, call me *Igarez*, or Igar for short.” He held out his hand from behind the desk in greeting.



I grasped his hand and gave it a firm shake. Then I responded, “It's a pleasure to meet you, Igar…” As I spoke, my head became heavy, as if I’d just worked a 10-hour shift…



“Igar, let go of the poor man. He’s not someone you're allowed to mess with.” A tall, broad-shouldered, and tough-looking woman shot Igar a glare as he quickly released me and mumbled something under his breath as I felt my exhaustion fade.



“Thanks… I don’t know what came over me! Must just be tired from the road.” I chuckled as I turned to look at her. She stood around 5’9” and wore a pleasant plum suit. Unadorned with much else, not even a name tag by which to identify her.



She noticed my glance and said, “My name is Solia. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Would you care to follow me?” She gestured to a hallway, down which I began to follow her, just wanting to be away from Igar.



“So you're here for our in-house Therapist position?” She smiled politely as she led me into a small office space adorned with paintings and pictures, some of which looked quite expensive.



“Ah, yes! I am. Your boss, the ‘chief,’ as I’ve heard him addressed, offered me the position a few days ago.” I set down my resume in front of her. She didn’t even bother looking at it before staring into my eyes.



As she stared into my eyes, I felt my body begin to… freeze. The room around me began to lose color… beginning to grayscale before my eyes. I also felt my body stiffen up, and as it did so, my heart slowed. I saw a glimpse of what appeared to be emerald snakes in front of me. Mesmerizing they were, but as if compelled by a power within me, I managed to break my gaze with her. 



Though how, I’d be hard-pressed to tell you, even now, hours after as I sit typing this. Hell, even as I recall it, I feel my head pound and silent whispers begin to crawl at the edge of my vision, threatening to consume me.



“Hmmm… I see why the boss took an interest in you… Quite interesting indeed. You’ll fit right in here.” She brought her hands up to her mouth, a smile slipping through the cracks of her hands. As soon as she took that pose, I saw the snakes snap away, and reality come back into view.



I rubbed my eyes with the palm of my hand as I stated, “I’ll be glad to join the team. God, I need some more sleep. Anyways, when do I start?” She then grabbed a piece of paper and slid it before me. An NDA stating that I’m not allowed to discuss what happens outside work through verbal means, or I’d face severe punishment in the form of termination and a lawsuit.



Luckily, it did not mention written disclosure. I signed the paper, and as she stood up, I knew that my fate, whatever it may be here, was now… set… in… stone.
