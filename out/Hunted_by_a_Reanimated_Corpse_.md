I have been on the run since February. Stalked and taunted by a cult with motives impossible to comprehend. 

I guess I’ll start from when I discovered the snuff videos. They were hidden in a website filled with cryptic messages, cyphers, and esoteric occult imagery. Of course this peaked my 3AM interest and I tore through it finding some schizophrenic blog posts and unlisted videos that could be part of an obscure snuff film. I also found coordinates to a geocache in a city 45 minutes from my hometown. I built up the courage to go there, where I found nothing but a pile of rocks and a blank white mask. 

The place was an overgrown field that used to be mental asylum, but was torn down. It was pretty open space and I didn’t feel too unsafe, except for the fact that there was some homeless guy in a long coat some 500 feet away from me. I didn’t think much of him till way later in this fucking mess. There was another location that was much more difficult to find. I had to Google the satellite image on the site which led me to a massive, 100+ year old mill or factory. I got lost in its lower floors and basement looking for a specific courtyard from the snuff content. The photos and videos of the courtyard looked like one of those liminal spaces where the brick building is on all 4 walls but the trees and grass are on the inside of the room. The place was so huge that I got lost and couldn’t find it. It was much scarier down there. I was afraid to run into a crackhead or something. Knowing how the city is and how unpredictable people can be, I wouldn’t have been surprised. I promptly went home because the sun sets fairly early in February. I will never forget what I found in my mailbox the following day. 

When I got home there was a hand written note in my mailbox. No envelope or return, addressed to me by name. Taped to the back of the note was a USB flash drive. Whoever had sent me this note delivered it by hand and must’ve followed me home from the mill. 

The letter said
“Dearest Angelica, you’re getting very close, aren’t you? But you’re missing the point… Maybe this will answer your questions, regards.”

I brought the USB to the police, who treated me like I was some lunatic looking for attention. They must have looked up my record and seen my little grippy sock vacation back in college. I made sure to check what was on the drive before handing it over. I know it’s stupid and probably gave me a virus, but I dont even know where that pc is anymore, nor do I care now that I’m constantly on the run. The drive had a text doc and an image of a spider in its web. The cypher translated to “IF I WAS ABLE TO GET HERE SO ARE THEY. THERES ANOTHER MESSAGE FOR YOU. WATCH YOUR FUCKING STEP” alongside another set of coordinates.

I took my time going to the next location. I began couch hopping between friends’ houses. I was afraid of being stalked. I KNEW I was being stalked. There were videos of me through windows and in public places buried throughout the website. I had other users sending me the links even though I had already found them myself. I was stricken with some sort of obsession over this website. It was constantly changing as often as I would move around physical locations. I decided I had to go to the newest coordinates. 
There I found a cobble stone structure about 10 feet tall with a base about 5x5 feet wide at the edge of a swamp. Lord knows I brought the pepper spray in case I ran into my secret admirer. I’m not allowed to have a gun.  At the location was a zipped up plastic bag with a candle, a Polaroid of an extremely dark room with a piano in it, and another flash drive. On that drive was two images; one green ruined Polaroid with a link with my name photoshopped onto it, and a grainy red photo of teeth. This shook me to my core as I was having nightmares of gnashing teeth for days prior to this geocache. This is what was hidden in the images using steganography;
 “binahisthehighestformofluna.sheiswhatgivesthemthepowertocommunicatethroughdreams.thisiswhyyouvebeenhavingthosedreamsaboutgnashingteeth.theyarepoisonedjustlikeyouandi.youwillunderstandsoonerthanlater.

itswasnicefollowingyouaroundthisweek.youarequiteaninterestingperson.becautiouswalkingaloneinthedarkness.seeyousoon.”

I knew there were at least 3 people following me. Two in masks would get real close to me at night. Looking through my windows, climbing the roofs of wherever I was staying. Only at night though. For some reason the third guy kept his distance. I had seen him at the first geocache. I didn’t recognize him until I decided to go to the cemetery in one of the videos. He would circle me from a distance leaving little cryptic notes for me on scrap paper. I found the cemetery through the blog page which kept hinting at these places around and outside of the city. The page also seemed to be communicating with whoever was running the website through codes and cyphers, as well as hinting to me what their next moves might be. Many more videos popped up on the website as the map of it changed around. I went to the locations and continued documenting my descent, albeit in private since I knew this cult was watching all my socials. 

My obsession with the site turned for the worst, littering my friends’ apartments and my hotel rooms with crudely drawn maps of its pages and thousands of notes attempting to decipher these stalkers’ messages to each other. I began asking myself, what did they want from me? How am I involved in this? I was losing too much sleep. I was afraid of seeing these people in my dreams. There was a horrifying feeling in my nightmares very difficult to explain. As if a tentacle or rather a giant centipede was wrapping itself around my limbs and pulling me down as the masked people approached. My lack of sleep was not only becoming visible in my speech patterns but also in the condition of my body. I guess I wasn’t eating or showering. My eyes were bloodshot and eye bags formed under my already existing eye bags. My speech patterns were incoherent and all I talked about was this fucking website. My friends had me sectioned and I spent another 30 days in an institution. I don’t remember anything from my visit or after my release up until May. 

This is when I remember having extremely vivid lucid dreams of that mill place and a vast forested park with broken down stone structures. I remember seeing Him down there in the mill. The guy with the trench coat. He never let me get close to him, probably due to me carrying pepper spray in the past. I never told anybody how I lost that spray during my second trip to the institution. I mean they were only dreams anyways right? The dreamscapes felt so real though. They felt astral. I saw the other two there as well. They would always chase me. The ones with the masks. One was a crude bloody mask that looked like somebody’s skin was removed and hardened with enamel and the other was that same blank white mask from the first geocache except the eyes were blacked out now. All of these dreams felt so vivid. But there was something dark looming in the dream scapes. And an unforgettable humming sound. God damn that fucking buzzing. It haunts me in any silent moments, just like tinnitus. 

Every time I got sleep it felt like being in somebody else’s dream. I know it sounds schizo but it’s the only way to describe the place. It is all one place. As if every landscape, indoors or outdoors is just a room in one big house. But who’s house is it?

From this point forward I only had moments of clarity. My memory mostly consisted of the dream scapes and the things that happened in them. They seem more real to me than daylight now. I remember giving into the blackness. A feminine voidlike and inky abyss. I can’t remember anything else until that night. The night we tried to drown him.  

He posted my cellphone on his blog with a set of coordinates reflecting off its screen, carefully taped to the wall off camera. I though my phone had been confiscated when I was sectioned. I have no idea how it landed in his hands. He said that it contains my missing memories. Videos and photos like the snuff I found on the website. I met him at the prison camps where the coordinates landed. That’s where we tried to drown him. I did not have control of my body anymore, She did. That inky darkness that clawed at my arms and legs like a centipede, gripping my bones from the inside of my flesh. But there was something much stronger than us that woke me up. Stopped us from killing him.  I managed to throw him the string lights before I woke up. I know that was me and not Her. He stayed there. I don’t know if He can leave anymore. I have to come back to my body lest her thousand legs claw harder and take control again. I can’t go back to the institution. 

Weeks went by and there was no changes to the blog or the website. I knew something was wrong. I stopped dreaming. I tried to make contact but it was futile. I feared the worst. 

They had cut me off and killed him. I know it now. I saw his body reanimated on my phone. It was the last video taken in my camera roll. 

He had one of them held hostage and they did it again. I know they filmed it too. That’s what’s on the VHS tape in the cabin video. It’s not how things were supposed to go. I can’t explain how I know but my subconscious understands the situation. 

They used his body to wake up that dreaming One who’s been taunting us all from the start. He is the eldest One. She doesn’t want Him to reach me. Even She is afraid of Him. He is awake now. I took the video down there in that fucking mill. I know it’s real. I know that sick fuck is in that body, rotting away His host like a parasite.  

They filmed the whole thing with the VHS camera. They murdered him, sliced up his corpse with razor blades, cast that damned circle and summoned that [devil.](https://imgur.com/Er3AyHw) Spitting more blades and whispering to them in His gentle tone. I’ll never forget the look he gave me before I ran out for the last time. That awful fucking smile and dead eyes. This time it was real. It was not a dream. He’s been tapping on my windows and climbing my roof again, except now I can smell the decayed flesh. I know that body won’t hold out forever but neither can mine. She wants me in the astral, but my tether was cut when He woke up. I can’t go back. I can’t go back. I can’t go back.
