They're everywhere, and nowhere at the same time.

I am -or was- a archeologist, me and my colleagues started to work on a new burial site on the French Alps, buried deep into the mountains.

It was found by someone hiking, then entering a formerly unknown cave system, getting lost and sending multiple voice messages before starving to death. Yeah, alredy bad luck.

We arrived there with the equipments and other things required for things like that. The air was stifling and smelled of rot, it was moisty and mold was all over the place.

It looked like a normal cave at first, then the surroundings suddenly changed, and instead of the boring cave walls, there were ancient stone walls, different symbols and figures engraved in them. It was truly fascinating, if you forget the fact that the symbols and figures were almost all about death or inhuman things.

There was one symbol, repeating in every doorframe and every wall, ever single stone.

A eye, a giant, singular eye. It had a vertical pupil, and of course, it was flying and had hundreds of limbs, spiraling and spiraling. 

After a while, we finally came to the main part of the site, a tomb.

It was out of the place, it was made out if metal and was bound by chains, with a Latin phrase engraved on it.

"*Angelus Quintus.
Quinta Potestas.
Quinta Tribulatio.

Ens quod hic iacet a Prima Potestate, Servatore nostro, signatum est.

Quicumque hoc sepulcrum aperuerit, calamitatem peiorem quam maledictiones regum antiquorum Orientalium, et in se ipsos et in omnia entia, incurret.*"

Of course, we didn't take it seriously, it was probably something like the Curse of Ra, y'know, to make people afraid of opening the tomb so it doesn't gets raided. 

And, a Latin phrase saying we will get cursed, on a tomb in the French Alps looked a bit out of place.

We opened the tomb, as we did, the doors shut down, the lights sources went off as darkness filled the room, and *something* got out of the tomb, alive.

And my vision faded, then came back, to make me see only one thing, a eye, a giant, singular eye, with thousands of limbs, spiraling, spiraling, spiraling, and spiraling. 

Filling my line of sight as I heard thousands of voices speaking everywhere, all at once, whispering, screaming, crying, laughing, everything at the same time.

And as my head filled with the voices and the Thing, and as my perception of reality slowly slipped, and as my will broke a hundred times, it stopped.

Everything stopped, time itself stopped. And then world ended. Existence unexisted and a new one started. I saw entire species exist and thrive, then die out in agony. I saw stars light up and explode. I saw death itself die and I heard the song of life slowly dying out. And as stars bleeded again and again, I was alone in the chaotic nature of cycles and spirals.

Then I woke up in the same tomb room, all my colleagues acting like nothing happened and I just faded out for a moment.

They did notice the black veins around my left eye though. Spiraling. Spiraling. Spiraling.
