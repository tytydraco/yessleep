“So, when did this start happening to you?” the shrink asked, his eyes unfazed, staring, calculating, assessing.

“About 3 weeks ago,” I answered. I didn’t want to look him in the eye. I knew I’d get that look, feigned sympathy and fake understanding. I hated being here. I hated having to talk to this guy.

“And it was around this time that you said your shadow started … talking to you. What did your shadow say?”

“He didn’t exactly talk like a regular person. Just clipped phrases. Mostly he said to run towards the light and to prepare”

“So the voice that you heard is a male voice? What else did he say? Did he tell you to cut you arm like that?” he gestured at the bandaged wound in my arm. Pain flared up again.

“No, this was … I played around with a wild animal, is all.”

“Awfully big animal to leave a wound like that. Alright, back to the talking shadow. You said something about preparation? What did your shadow tell you to prepare?”

“I don’t know. He didn’t say” I smelled suspicion in the air. It smelled like a dank old office lined with old wooden furniture, bitter pills that turn your head funny, new paper that get scribbled on with unrecognizable handwriting.

“This shadow fellow’s not very chatty huh” he said. Then there was a bell. He picked up his phone, his brows squeezed into a frown. Seemed I was about to be released.

“Well, Victor, that is all the time that we have for today. But don’t you worry about a thing alright? We have had many schizophrenic patients, and you can absolutely live with it with the right medication. So, same time next week for your evaluation?”

“Sure” I said, standing up, feeling relieved. I headed out of the building and stood on the sidewalk, breathing in the fresh air. I preferred the outside. I started walking home through the upscale area. I wanted to look at some of the apartments and houses and imagine what it’d be like to live there. I passed by ivory white buildings, skyscrapers and tight apartments that were painted brick red.

I passed by the apartment of my friend, Peter Collins. Or at least he was my friend, three weeks ago, until his shadow killed him and gave me this wound in my right arm. I knew it would sound crazy if I ever tell that story to anyone. But here I am, writing to you. I’m not crazy. The shadows in my town are starting to kill people.

It all started 3 weeks ago. We were all excited to be able to have a group trip to a nearby water spring. Me, Peter Collins, Andie Brooks and Tyler Morgan made up a group of friends. We were all roommates at the university, and we all liked the same things, horror movies, videogames, rock music, and girls.

It started out just a normal camping trip. We’d just swam in the spring and started a BBQ and pitched our tent. Then it got dark, with the four of us around the fire. We started telling ghost stories, the sound of running water and crackling flame as our background.

“So this one is about a skin walker. A creature who can open your skin and eat your inside and then take on your look. No one would know if it was the real you or the creature. The only sign is a wound to the forehead” Peter started.

“Sounds like bullshit to me” Tyler said.

“Duh, it’s a story. And this one’s an actual urban legend. Don’t you hear, we’ve been getting a lot of reports about people turning up with forehead wounds in this city.”

“Actual urban legend is an oxymoron. Can’t be actual if it’s a legend” Andie said, sipping his beer can.

We were in the middle of our conversation when, suddenly, I started hearing words. Faint whispers at first, but then it built into a raspy voice.

“Run…away…run…to…light”

“Did someone say something?” I asked my friends.

“What do you mean?” Peter asked back.

“Someone said something about running away to the light?”

“Yeah…nice joke. What’s next? A monster gonna jump out of the bush?” he said and laughed. I gave an embarrassed laugh to save face. I thought I must have misheard, you often hear weird things in the wild.

“Run…to…light” the voice returned with greater volume this time. This time I was sure that I heard it. I looked to my friends for confirmation. Andie looked at me with incredulous eyes. I knew he heard it too.

“Anyone hungry for some roasted marshmallow?” Peter asked and took out three metal skewers, held each skewer between the space of his finger and roared “I’m the wolverine”. He turned to Tyler, they both laughed.

Just then, I caught something from the corner of my eye. A shimmer. It looked as if a black creature was writhing on the ground behind Peter. It took me a while to realize that it was his shadow. It was warping, moving somehow. He didn’t see it, didn’t have the chance to. His shadow rose up from the ground, formed a humanoid figure, the shadows of the skewers formed three claws on its left hand. Before we could react, the thing pierced Peter’s chest, making a loud puncturing sound and splashing his blood on the ground. Peter only had enough time to turn around and look at the creature before dropping.

I was the one sitting closest to Peter. The thing made towards me. I jumped and started to back up.

“Run…to…light” the voice said again, clearer this time. The creature was rushing to me now. I looked to my left, Tyler and Andie were still frozen with fear. I knew I would not be able to outrun this thing, so I picked up a nearby burning branch and used it as a weapon. The creature paused, then it started for Andie, who was closest to me. My fight or flight instinct kicked in, I swung the branch as hard as I could towards the creature, it dodged and with one strike from its left claw, splintered the branch. The burning head of the branch dropped to the ground right next to the shadow and the creature staggered backward as if afraid.

“It’s scared of fire” Andie screamed.

I realized the same thing. But the creature was now closer to the fire than we were, and it realized that as well because it immediately advanced to cut us off as the fire from the branch head died down. Tyler circled to the creature’s right, and it immediately jumped to block him.

“We outnumber him, just spread out and each of us get one branch” Tyler said.

We did as he said, each of us spreading out to draw the creature away from the flame. Realizing the situation that it was in, the creature backed down from us and from the flame.

“It’s running away” I said to my friends. We advanced just as the creature backed down in a kind of weird lockstep. Finally, we were close enough to the flame. Each of us picked up a burning branch. My fear gradually gave way to justified anger. It was 3 on 1 now. I wanted to crush the thing’s head.

“We’ll fucking kill you, hear that you son of a bitch?” Tyler roared, his branch raised high above his head. In the flickering light he looked so grand and brave, like a giant. The light cast a large streak of his shadow on the ground, along with his branch, now magnified. Then the shadow started swirling.

“Oh shit, run!” I screamed to my friends. They realized it just as quickly as I did and turned tail. I stole a look behind as I was running and the sight froze my blood. The shadows were running for us, the new one was far larger and taller, and it held a giant club in its right hand.

“Turn…on…light” the voice said again. I thought we all heard it that time, because Andie made a get-together motion with both of his arms to me and Tyler.

“I’ve got an idea” Andie said, “buy me some time”.

“Are you crazy? How the fuck do we do that? They’re gonna kill us in seconds.”

“Just trust me. Buy me some time.”

Me and Tyler stopped and faced the creatures. The shadows caught up to us. The big one immediately gunned for Tyler. It was unusually fast, the giant branch in its hand made loud thudding noise every time it struck the ground. The smaller one advanced slowly towards me, as if calculating its every move.

We tried our best to draw out the fight, but Tyler ran out of breath trying to dodge the creature’s strikes, and one of them hit him square in the torso, making a crushing sound. He held his side and dropped unconscious. At that moment I lost focus, the smaller creature leaped forward and slashed at me, grazing my arm. The pain was immediate. I dropped my weapon and stumbled to the ground. The shadows were approaching us, I could almost feel the victory swagger in their walk. This was it, this was how we were going to die, killed by our shadows.

Just then, I heard a roaring engine approaching, as it closed, a blinding beam of light flooded our entire area. The two creatures immediately started burning away. After a couple of seconds, they collapsed and dissipated.

Andie got out of the car and ran to Tyler. I got up and we checked on him together. He was still alive, but there was a large and purple bruise on his side and some ribs looked like they were pushed inward. We called the cops and left the headlights and the engine on until they arrived hours later. We wanted to go back for Peter, but we were so scared that we didn’t dare leave the front of the headlights, our eyes fixed on our shadows.

The cops did not believe our story, of course. I could hardly believe it myself. They called an ambulance for Tyler and Peter and searched around our campsite. No one besides Andie and me noticed that they cast no shadow even under strong headlights from the police and ambulance. The police escorted us to the station. They made us wait for 5 hours and interrogated us in different rooms. After a while, a thin and hawk-like man walked in.

“Killian Kessler, detective. Here to ask you about the death of your supposed friend” he said. His voice was quick and brusque.

“I already told you people about it. My friend’s shadow rose up from the ground and killed him”

“With what weapon?”

“With these, uh kind of long claws made from the shadow of the iron skewers that we use to roast marshmallows”

“And you expect me to believe that?”

“Well, it’s the truth.” I was getting angry. I wanted to check on my friends, not waste time with this asshole.

“Know how much trouble you two are in? One count of homicide and another count of first-degree assault with a blunt weapon. Where did you hide the weapons?”

“They burned away with the shadows when we turned our headlights on.”

“Isn’t that just so convenient. Know how many murder suspects we got that said the same shit you did? Half a dozen just this week. Shadow people and weapons. Let me guess, you joined a cult and killing your friend was your initiation ritual. Is that it?”

“Look, I don’t know what to tell you. Just look at the ground around the camp. You’re a detective right, see the marks on the ground. No way we could make those with just the two of us”

The detective looked at me, his eyes now two small slits in a gaunt face. I knew he didn’t believe me. But I also guessed that he had no other explanation either because after asking a couple of questions, he just left me in the room. Another officer entered and allowed me to leave with a warning that if any incriminating evidence turned up, I would be summed in a heartbeat. Looking around, I saw that Andie also got out and was waiting for me.

“How’s your wound” he asked.

“Bad. They disinfected it but didn’t give me anything for the pain” I was realizing the throbbing pain in my right arm.

“Heard anything about Pete and Tyler?” I asked him.

“Pete’s dead. Tyler is in intensive care” he said, his face darkened.

“What do we do now?”

“I’ll do some digging. Meanwhile, I think you’d want to turn on all the lights in your apartment this evening.”

“Prepare” a voice came out of nowhere, just like before, I looked around. No one. Andie could hear it too because his eyes were darting around searching for the source.

“You know I didn’t say it” I told him.

“Prepare” the voice repeated. I realized that it came from the shadow under my feet.

“Prepare, what do you mean by prepare? And why are you not rising from the ground and slitting my throat right now?”

“Prepare… light”

“I think it wants us to prepare for light sources” Andie said.

“Doesn’t make sense. Why would it want to help us?”

“I don’t know right now. The detective told me there are some other cases like ours. I know someone inside, I’m gonna ask them for the info about the cases. Try to keep safe and in the meanwhile, I think we should buy some flashlights.”

I said goodbye to Andie and headed for Home Depot. I settled for two Streamlight ProTac and a Fenix, with a couple packs of CR123A batteries. The cashier gave me a strange look but fortunately did not ask any question. I took the items home with me, occasionally looking at the ground. The experience had made me paranoid, I started to constantly look at the feet of passersby, afraid that at any moment, a shadow would spring up.

That was three weeks ago. Since then, we hadn’t heard anything from the police, but the news was talking about an increase in violence in our city. I also got the feeling that I was followed everywhere I went, and I thought I saw the same car on the street opposite my apartment a couple of times. I started going to a shrink’s office because my parents were raving nonstop about it. They thought I was actually going insane, but they didn’t know.

I passed by Peter’s apartment. His funeral was last week. I didn’t dare show up and I imagined that Andie didn’t either, we were still the only suspects in the case, and I didn’t think his parents would take kindly to my recount of their son’s shadow killing him. I muttered a few words of goodbye to my friend and carried on.

My phone rang. It was Andie. This was the first time that he contacted me since the police station.

“We need to meet, I think I figured out something.”

“Sure man. Just tell me through the phone.”

“Can’t. Just meet me in my apartment.”

“Right now?”

“Right now!”

I didn’t argue. From Peter’s apartment, it would be about a 30-minute walk to Andie’s. I kept my eyes trained to the ground, afraid of any unusual motion. Suddenly, a shadow of a person appeared on the ground, staggered and aimed at my direction. I could feel my heart rate doubling. But I looked up and it was just a drunk who was pointing at someone behind me.

I walked as quickly as I could, my hands holding on to the two ProTacs in my pocket, their butts jutting out. Another person would think that I was carrying weapons, and I received some frightened look from other people, they all avoided my direction and walked quickly past me.

I arrived at Andie’s and rang the bell.

After a few clicks, the door opened. Behind it was Andie, only he was skinny and pale with two purple bags under his eyes.

“Jesus, what happened to you?”

“Couldn’t sleep. Come on in. Quickly. I think we’re watched.”

His entire apartment was brightly lit. Every corridor, every room. He gestured for me to sit at his dining room table. Our shadows were printed on the wooden floor of his apartment. I looked around, there was a large industrial lamp with a long metal base that was shining directly on us.

“They’re coming” Andie said, his two fingers pressing on both sides of his temples.

“Who?”

“The shadows. I have read reports. There were 7 cases of murder, same as us. Suspects all reported shadowy people rising from the ground. 21 more since then.”

“Shit. Are you sure those are all shadows?”

“Certain. No killing weapons were found. All reported seeing writhing shadows. Some escaped, some were burned away. We need to prepare.”

“Well, I’ve got these.” I took out my ProTacs. “Want one?” I asked.

“I have my own, but…” at this point our talk was interrupted. There was a knocking at the door. Andie moved to open it, but he only had enough time to unlock before the door was kicked in. It was Kessler and another police officer.

“Looks like we caught you red-handed, boys. Exchanging weapons huh? May be a few tips on how to conceal them from the police?” he said, he was smiling now, his eyes lit up like a predator.

“You got it all wrong. We just want to…” I started

“We’ll see for ourselves what you are up to. Hands against the wall.”

While Kessler searched me and Andie, his associate looked around the apartment.

“Why’s it so goddamned bright in here”. He looked at a switch near the wall and flicked it.

“No, not that one” Andie screamed. Immediately, two of the brightest lights above went out. The room became only half-lit. Our collective shadows formed an overlapping black mass on the ground. The light stands formed straight sticks. Then the shadows started swirling.

“Look on the ground” I shouted. The shadow was rising now. From the amalgamation of our bodies, a hideous torso with 4 pairs of legs rose up. An arm of the officer overlapped with Andie’s, and the shadow formed a big arm with two forearms on the left. On the right, Kessler’s coat cast a large shadow, and the arm that emerged was also large, twice as large as that of a normal person, and it was holding the shadows of the lamp base.

Kessler and the officer fired at the creature, loud bangs and a burning smell filling the entire room. But the bullets did nothing. Andie and I got free and used our flashlights on the shadow. It immediately started to burn away. Andie made for the light switch. Just then, its right arm used the lamp base shadow as a blade and swung. It sliced off Andie’s arm in a single strike. He dropped to the ground, his scream reverberating through the entire room. The flashlight in his arm rolled away. The creature swung for the second time, and Andie’s torso was cut into two pieces. His blood splashed onto my face, leaving a metallic smell. I couldn’t believe what was happening.

“Motherfucker, I’ll fucking kill you” I bellowed and trained my flashlight on the creature, wishing with every fiber of my being that the light would kill the creature. It burned away slowly, but the light from the flashlight was not strong enough, and it held out its left arm to cover itself. It was moving towards me.

“The flashlight, get it.” I screamed at the officer. He dove for it as the creature was fixed on me. Then he turned it on and aimed it at the creature. It was visibly burning now. But before the officer could back up to a safe distance, the shadow leaped towards him and with its weapon, cleaved the flashlight and the officer in half, there was a sickly sound of flesh being torn in two. The officer collapsed. It turned back and made towards me. Just when I thought it was all over, I heard a click. Light filled the room and the creature burned away, its body dropping to the floor then dissipated like burned paper. Kessler had turned on the light.

I dropped to the floor, my heart jumping wildly. Then I just started to cry. It was all too much. My friends are now dead or dying and I had never felt so alone. After a while, Kessler approached and put a hand on my shoulder.

“I’m sorry kid. I didn’t know. So, shadow people huh?”

“Yeah”

“Alright. Are there more of these coming?”

“That’s what Andie said.”

“Sorry about your friend.”

He sat down to my level and looked me in the eye.

“Alright. Here’s what we’re gonna do. I’m gonna clean up here. Meanwhile, you should go home, get some rest. No one will believe you, but they’ll believe me. I’ll chalk it up to a serial killer and gather a group of friends. Meanwhile, you should prepare. Flashlights, batteries, whatever you can get your hands on. Don’t worry kid, I believe you now. You’re not alone anymore.”

I headed home, still sniffling, but my mind was made up. These shadows were rising and I was going to make sure that my friends did not die in vain. A raspy voice called from beneath my feet.

“Prepare…for… the coming!”

I stood dead in my spot.

As I’m writing this to you, there are still more questions than answers. Every time I close my eyes, I could hear the sound of flesh torn apart and smell blood. My friends’ faces haunt me every night and I often wake up in the middle of the night, scared that some shadow would strangle me in my sleep. To tell you the truth, I don’t know how it happened or why it started. I don’t know why my shadow is saying these cryptic messages to help me. I don’t even know what “The Coming” is, my shadow has been quiet ever since. But it must be serious. So I guess if you have read this far, then you know what’s coming. Buy a flashlight and a backup battery, keep them close to you at all times. And if your shadow starts to swirl, run.
