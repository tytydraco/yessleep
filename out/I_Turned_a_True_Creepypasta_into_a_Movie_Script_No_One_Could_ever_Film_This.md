Ok, so here’s the deal. I’m a screenwriter – not a very successful one, but a screenwriter nonetheless. I write horror scripts mostly, and I actually thought the story concepts I had were pretty ground-breaking. But despite the many shitty and just God-awful horror movies that get made these days, that prioritize political correctness over actual scares, it appears my stories aren’t even worth reading past the first ten pages. 

I almost felt like giving up, just calling it a day on the whole screenwriter dream - but one night, scrolling through the internet for the scariest creepypasta I could find, I stumbled upon a story... Maybe you’ve heard of it. It’s called: ‘I Journeyed into the real Heart of Darkness...’ Basically, the story is about a group of American activist students (and some English guy) who journey into the Congo rainforest to start their own commune, only to find all kinds of fucked-up horrors... Well, it turns out this creepypasta, isn’t just a creepypasta... Apparently, it’s a true story... 

Back in 2020, a group of American activist students (and one English guy dating one of those students) went missing somewhere in the jungles of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Five of them are still missing to this day, but three were able to find their way out of the jungle. 

When the three survivors were interviewed, they said they were harassed by locals in the jungle and got lost... But then one of them again came forward two years later – and they told the truth – or the supposed truth... It was the English guy.   

According to this guy, Henry Cartwright, the group had stumbled upon a part of the jungle that was closed off by a wooden, spiked fence, where they were later forced by local Pygmy hunters to enter through it... And what they had to endure on the other side, was complete nightmare fuel! The most unspeakable horrors you could imagine! 

I didn’t even know if I believed this guy’s story - it sounded way too far-fetched. But the story was still scary as hell. I couldn’t get it out of my mind. I had become obsessed with it... And so, feeling inspired, I chose to write it into a screenplay, in the hopes that someone in the movie biz would love this story as much as I did. 

I had only written a handful of drafts before I realized, that the things these people were put through inside that jungle... could never be turned into a movie... I’ve always loved horror movies, but one subgenre I could never stomach was the so-called “torture p\*\*\*”.... But somehow, that’s what I’d written. 

Even though I convinced myself this story was going to be my big break, upon redrafting what I wrote, reading through the horrors that these guys went through... I quickly realized this story wasn’t ever going to be made. I didn’t even try to redraft it after that. If this story actually happened and people brutally lost their lives the way Henry said they did, there’s no way I was gonna sugar-coat it... So, I abandoned the script. 

I spent a lot of time and effort writing this script, and rather than destroying or leaving it unread by the masses... I thought I’d upload it on here for you guys to read. I’ve changed certain parts to the original story and creepypasta, just to make it a little less generic, but it’s basically the same story. I did change the ending drastically, but who wants to see a cliché ending where people enter a “haunted house” “haunted forest” etc, where the virgins or final girl eventually get out of there.  

Through the telling of this story, I’ll remove the scenes that are either too boring or nothing scary really happens (you’re only here for the scary stuff, right?) where I’ll instead write a brief summary of the scene. 

If I ever got the chance to pitch this screenplay, I’d describe the story as Get Out meets Apocalypse Now - with a pinch of ‘What the actual fuck!’ 

With that being said... enjoy the story... 

Synopsis: A young Londoner accompanies his girlfriend's activist group on a journey into the heart of African jungle, only to discover they now must resist the very evil humanity vowed to leave behind. 

INT/EXT. BLACK VOID - BEGINNING OF TIME  

...We stare into a DARK NOTHINGNESS. A BLACK EMPTY CANVAS on the SCREEN... We can almost hear a WAILING - somewhere in its VAST SPACE. GHOSTLY HOWLS, barely even heard... We stay in this EMPTINESS for TEN SECONDS...  

Until:  

FADE IN:  

"Going up that river was like travelling back to the earliest beginnings of the world, when vegetation rioted on the earth and the big trees were kings" -Joseph Conrad  

FADE TO: 

EXT. JUNGLE - CENTRAL AFRICA - NEOLITHIC AGE - DAY  

Conrad's WORDS fade away - transitioning us from an endless dark void into a seemingly endless GREEN PRIMAL ENVIROMENT.  

VEGETATION rules everywhere. From VINES and SNAKE-LIKE BRANCHES of the immense TREES to THIN, SPIKE-ENDED LEAVES covering every inch of GROUND and space.  

The INTERIOR to this jungle is DIM. Light struggles to seep through holes in the tree-tops - whose prehistoric TRUNKS have swelled to an IMMENSE SIZE. We can practically feel the jungle breathing life. Hear it too: ANIMAL LIFE. BIRDS chanting and MONKEYS howling off screen.  

ON the FLOOR SURFACE, INSECT LIFE thrives among DEAD LEAVES, DEAD WOOD and DIRT... until:  

FOOTSTEPS. ONE PAIR of HUMAN FEET stride into frame and then out. And another pair - then out again. Followed by another -all walking in a singular line...  

These feet belong to THREE PREHISTORIC HUNTERS. Thin in stature and SMALL - VERY SMALL, in fact. Barely clothed aside from RAGS around their waists. Carrying a WOODEN SPEAR each. Their DARK SKIN gleams with sweat from the humid air.  

The middle hunter is DIFFERENT - somewhat feminine. Unlike the other two, he possesses TRIBAL MARKINGS all over his FACE and BODY, with SMALL BONE piercings through the ears and lower-lip. He looks almost to be a kind of witch-doctor. A Seer... A WOOT. 

The hunters walk among the trees. Brief communication is heard in their ANCIENT LANGUAGE - until the middle hunter (the Woot) sees something ahead. Holds the two back. 

We see nothing.  

The back hunter (HUNTER#1) then gets his throwing arm ready. Taking two steps forward, he then lobs his spear nearly 20 metres ahead. Landing - SHAFT protrudes from the ground.  

They run over to it. Hunter#1 plucks out his spear – lifts the HEAD to reveal... a DARK GREEN LIZARD, swaying its legs in its dying moments. The hunters study it - then laugh hysterically... except the Woot.  

3 EXT. JUNGLE - EVENING   

The hunters continue to roam the forest - at a faster pace. The shades of green around them dusk ever darker.  

LATER:  

They now squeeze their way through the interior of a THICK BUSH. HUNTER#2 scratches himself and wails. The Woot looks around this mouth-like structure, concerned - as if they're to be swallowed hole at any moment.  

EXT. JUNGLE - CONTINUOS  

They ascend out the other side. Brush off any leaves or scrapes - and move on.  

The two hunters look back to see the Woot has stopped.  

HUNTER#1: (to Woot) What is wrong?  

The Woot looks around, again concernedly at the scenery. Noticeably different: a DARKER, SINISTER GREEN. The trees feel more claustrophobic. There's no sound... animal and insect life has died away.  

WOOT: ...We should go back... It is getting dark.  

Both hunters agree, turn back. As does the Woot: TO US – we see the whites of his eyes widen - searching around desperately...  

CUT TO:  

The Woot's POV: the supposed bush, from which they came – has vanished! Instead: a dark CONTINUATION of the jungle.  

The two hunters notice this too.  

HUNTER#1: (worrisomely) Where is the bush?!  

Hunter#2 points his spear to where the bush should be.  

HUNTER#2: It was there! We went through it and now it has gone!  

As hunters #1 and #2 argue, words away from becoming violent, the Woot, in front of them: is stone solid. Knows – feels something's deeply wrong.  

EXT. JUNGLE - DAY - DAYS LATER  

The hunters. Continue to trek through the same jungle. Hunched over. Spears drag on the ground. Visibly fatigued from days of non-stop movement - unable to find a way back. Trees and scenery around all appear the same - as if they've been walking in circles. If anything, moving further away from the bush.  

Hunters #1 and #2 begin to stagger - cling to the trees and each other for support.  

The Woot, clearly struggles the most, begins to lose his bearings - before suddenly, he crashes down on his front - facedown into dirt.  

The Woot slightly and slowly rises - unaware that inches ahead he's reached some sought of CLEARING. Hunters #1 and#2, now caught up, stop where this clearing begins. On the ground, the Woot sees them look ahead at something, he now faces forward to see:  

The clearing is an almost perfect CIRCLE. Vegetation around the edges - still in the jungle... And in the centre -planted upright, lies a LONG STUMP of a solitary DEAD TREE. 

DARKER in colour. A DIFFERENT kind of WOOD. It's also weathered - like the remains of a forest fire.  

A STONE-MARKED PATHWAY has also been dug, leading to it. However, what's strikingly different is that the tree -almost three times longer than the hunters, has a FACE -carved on the very top. 

THE FACE: DARK, with a distinctive HUMAN NOSE. BULGES for EYES. HORIZONTAL SLIT for a MOUTH. It sits like a severed, impaled head.  

The hunters peer up at the face's haunting, stone-like expression. Horrified... Except the Woot - appears to have come to a spiritual awakening of some kind.  

The Woot begins to drag his tired feet towards the dead tree, with little caution or concern - bewitched by the face. Hunter#1 tries to stop him, but is aggressively shrugged off.  

On the pathway, the Woot continues to the tree - his eyes have not left the face. The tall stump arches down on him. The SUN behind it - gives the impression this is some kind of GOD. RAYS OF LIGHT move around it - creates a SHADE that engulfs the Woot. The God swallowing him WHOLE. 

Now closer, the Woot anticipates touching what seems to be: a RED HUMAN HAND SHAPED PRINT branded on the BARK... Fingers inches away - before: 

A HIGH-PITCHED GROWL races out from the jungle! Right at the Woot! Crashes down - ATTACKING HIM! CANINES sink into flesh!  

The Woot cries out in horrific pain. The hunters react. They spear the WILD BEAST on top of him. Stab repetitively – stain what we see only as blurred ORANGE/BROWN FUR, red! The beast cries out - yet still eager to take the Woot's life. The stabbing continues - until the beast can't take anymore. Falls to one side, finally off the Woot. The hunters go round to continue the killing. Continue stabbing. Grunt as they do it - blood sprays on them... until finally realizing the beast has fallen silent. Still with death.   

The beast's FACE. Dead BROWN EYES stare into nothing... as Hunter's #1 and #2 stare down to see:  

This beast is NOW a PRIMATE. 

Something about it is familiar: its SKIN. Its SHAPE. HANDS and FEET - and especially its face... It's almost... HUMAN.  

Hunters #1 and #2 are stunned. Clueless to if this thing is ape or man? Man or animal? Forget the Woot is mortally wounded. His moans regain their attention. They kneel down to him - see as the BLOOD oozes around his eyes and mouth – and the GAPING BITE MARK shredded into his shoulder. The Woot turns up to the CIRCULAR SKY. Mumbles unfamiliar words...Seems to cling onto life... one breath at a time.  

CUT TO:  

A CHAMELEON - in the trees. Camouflaged as dark as the jungle. Watches over this from a HIGH BRANCH.  

EXT. JUNGLE CLEARING - NIGHT   

Hunters #1 and #2 sit around a PRIMITIVE FIRE, stare motionless into the FLAMES. Mentally defeated - in a captivity they can't escape.  

THUNDER is now heard, high in the distance - yet deep and foreboding.  

The Woot. Laid out on the clearing floor - mummified in big leaves for warmth. Unconscious. Sucks air in like a dying mammal...  

THEN: the Woot erupts into wakening! Coincides with the drumming thunder! EYES WIDE OPEN. Breathes now at a faster and more panicked pace. The hunters startle to their knees as the thunder produces a momentary WHITE FLASH of LIGHTNING. The Woot's mouth begins to make words. Mumbled at first - but then: 

WOOT: TERROR!... THE TERROR!... THE TERROR! 

Thunder and lightning continues to drum closer. The hunters panic - yell at each other and the Woot (no subtitles). 

WOOT (CONT'D): TERROR! TERROR! TERROR! TERROR!...  

HUNTER#1 screams at the Woot to stop, shakes him - as if forgotten he's already awake. 

WOOT (CONT'D): TERROR! TERROR! TERROR!... 

HUNTER#2 tries to pull hunter#1 back. Lightning exposes their actions.  

HUNTER#2: Leave him!  

HUNTER#1: Evil has taken him!!  

WOOT: TERROR! TERROR! TERROR!... 

Hunter#1 now races to his spear, before stands back over the Woot on the ground. Lifts the spear - ready to skewer the Woot into silence, when:  

THUNDER CLAMOURS AS A WHITE LIGHT FLASHES THE WHOLE CLEARING - EXPOSES HUNTER#1, SPEAR OVER HEAD.  

HUNTER#1: (stiffens)...  

The flash vanishes.  

Hunter#1 looks down... to see the end of another spear protrudes out his chest. His spear falls through his fingers. Now clutches the one in his chest - as the Woot continues...  

WOOT: Terror! Terror!...  

Hunter#1 falls to one side as a white light flashes again - reveals hunter#2 behind him: wide-eyed in disbelief. The Woot's rantings have slowed down considerably.  

WOOT (CONT'D): Terror... terror...(faint)...terror...  

Paying no attention to this, hunter#2 goes to his murdered huntsmen, laid to one side - eyes peer into the darkness around ahead... 

Hunter#2. Still knelt down beside hunter#1. Unable to come to terms with what he's done. Starts to rise back to his feet -when:  

THUNDER! LIGHTING! THUD!!  

Hunter#2 takes a blow to the HEAD! Falls down instantly to reveal:  

The Woot! On his feet! White light exposes his DELIRIOUS EXPRESSION - and one of the pathway rocks gripped between his hands!    

Down, but still alive, hunter#2 drags his half-motionless body towards the fire, which reflects in the trailing river of blood behind him. A momentary white light. Hunter#2 stops to turn over. Takes fast and jagged breaths - as another momentary white light exposes the Woot moving closer. Hunter#2 meets the derangement in the Woot's eyes. Sees hands raise the rock up high... before a final blow is delivered:  

WOOT (CONT'D): AHH!  

THUD! Stone meets SKULL. The SOLES of hunter#2's jerking feet become still...  

Thunder's now dormant.  

The Woot: truly possessed. Gets up slowly. Neanderthals his way past the lifeless bodies of hunters #1 and #2. He now sinks down between the ROOTS of the tree with the face. Blood and sweat glazed all over, distinguish his tribal markings. From the side, the fire and momentary lightning exposes his NEOLITHIC features.  

The Woot caresses the tree's roots on either side of him...before...  

WOOT (CONT'D): (silent)... The terror...  

FADE OUT.  

TITLE: ASILI  

INTERCUT/EXT. MODERN DAY - BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS - 2020 - STREETS - AFTERNOON  

FADE IN: We leave the mass of endless jungle for a mass gathering of civilisation... 

 A long BOSTON STREET. Filled completely with PROTESTING PEOPLE (of ALL COLOURS). Most wear MASKS (deep into PANDEMIC). They CHANT:  

PROTESTORS: BLACK LIVES MATTER! BLACK LIVES MATTER!...  

Almost everyone holds or waves SIGNS - they read: 'BLM','I CAN'T BREATHE', 'JUSTICE NOW!', etc. POLICEMEN keep the peace. 

Among the crowd: a GROUP of SIX PROTESTORS. THREE MEN and THREE WOMEN (all BLACK, early to mid-20's). Two hold up a BLACK BANNER, reads: 'B.A.D.S: Blood-hood of African Descendants and Sympathisers'... Among these six are:  

MOSES. African-American. Tall and lean. A gold cross necklace around his neck. The loudest by far - clearly wants to make a statement. A leadership quality to him.  

TYE LOUIN. Mixed-raced. Handsome. Thin. One of the two holding the banner. Distinctive of his NECK LENGTH DREADLOCKS.  

NADI HASSAN. A pleasant looking, beautiful young woman. Short statured and model thin. She's barely visible from her mask - and HIJAB. She takes part in the chanting alongside the others - when:  

RING RING RING. 

Nadi receives a PHONE CALL. Takes out her IPHONE and pulls down her mask. Answers: 

 NADI: (on phone) (raises voice) HELLO?  

She struggles to hear the other end.  

NADI (CONT'D): (London accent) Henry? Is that you? 

The girl next to her: CHANTAL CLEMMONS. Long hair. Well dressed - inquires in.  

CHANTAL: (pulls down mask) Have you told him?  

Nadi shakes a glimpsing 'No'. Tye looks back to them - eavesdrops. Fixates on Nadi.    

NADI: (loudly) Henry, I can't hear you. I'm at a rally - you'll have to shout...  

INTERCUT WIIH: 

INTERCUT/INT. HENRY'S FLAT - NORTH LONDON - NIGHT - SAME TIME   

HENRY: (on phone) ...I said: I was at the BLM rally in the park today. You know, the one I was talking to you about?  

HENRY CARTWRIGHT. Early 20's. CAUCASIAN. Brown hair. Not exactly tall or muscular, yet possesses that unintentional bad boy persona girls weaken for - to accompany his deep BLUE EYES. In the kitchen of a SMALL NORTH-LONDON FLAT, he glows on the other end. 

BACK TO:  

Nadi. The noise around takes up the scene.  

NADI: (hand over ear) (on phone) Henry, seriously - I can't hear a single word you're saying. Look, how about we chat tomorrow, yeah? Henry?  

HENRY: (on phone) ...Yeah. Alright - what time do you want me to call- 

NADI: (on phone) -Ok. Got to go. Bye! Bye! 

HENRY: (on phone) Yeah - bye! Love y- 

Henry looks to his iPhone - Nadi's hung up. He lets out a sigh of defeat - before carelessly dumps the phone on the table. Slumps down into a chair.  

HENRY (CONT'D): (to himself) ...Fuck.  

Henry looks over at the chair opposite him. A WHITE RALLY SIGN lies against it. The sign reads:  

'LOVE HAS NO COLOUR'. 

INT. BOSTON CAFE - LATER THAT DAY   

At a table, the exhausted B.A.D.S sit in a HALF-EMPTY CAFE (people still protest outside). An awkwardness hangs over them. The TV above the COUNTER displays the NEWS.  

NEWS WOMAN (O.S): ...I know the main debates of this time are racial rights and of course the pandemic - but we CANNOT hide from the facts: global warming is at an all time high! Even with the huge decrease in air travel and the manufacture of certain automobiles, one thing that has not decreased is DEFORESTATION...  

MOSES: (to B.A.D.S) That's it... That's all we can do... for now.  

A WAITRESS comes over...  

MOSES (CONT'D): (to waitress) Uhm... Yeah - six coffees... (before she goes) But, I have mine black. Thanks.  

The waitress walks away. Moses checks her out before turns back to the group. 

MOSES (CONT'D): At least NOW... we can focus on what really matters. On how we're truly gonna make a difference in this world...  

No reply. Everyone looks down at the table as to avoid Moses' eyes.  

MOSES (CONT'D): How we all feel 'bout that?  

The members look to each other - wonder who will go first... 

CHANTAL: (to Moses) ...I dunno... (struggles for words) It's just feeling... real all'er sudden... (to group) Right?  

MOSES: (ignores Chantal) How the rest of y'all feeling?  

JEROME: Shit - I'm going. Fuck this world.  

JEROME BOOTH. Sat next to Moses - his lapdog.  

BETH: Yeah. Me too...  

And BETH GODWIN. Shaved head. Athlete's body.  

BETH (CONT'D): (coldly) Even though y'all won’t let my girl come.    

MOSES: Nadi. You're being a quiet duck... What you gotta say 'bout all'er this? 

Nadi. Put on the spot. Everyone's attention on her.  

NADI: Well... It just feels like - we're giving up... I mean, people are here fighting for their civil and human rights - whereas we'll be somewhere far away from all this. Without making a real contribution...  

Moses gives her a stone-like reaction. 

NADI (CONT'D): (off Moses' look) It just seems to me that we should still be fighting - rather than... running away.  

Awkward silence. Everyone back on Moses.  

MOSES: You think this is us running away?... (to others) Is that what the rest of y'all think? That this is ME, retreating from the cause?  

Moses cranes back at Nadi for an answer. She looks back without one.  

MOSES (CONT'D): Nadi. You like your books... Ever read 'Sun Tzu: the Art of War'?  

Nadi's eyes meet the others: 'What's he getting at?'.  

NADI: ...No- 

MOSES: -It was Sun Tzu that said: 'Build your opponent a golden bridge for which they will retreat across'... Well, we're gonna build our own damn bridge - and while this side falls into political, racial and religious chaos - and when global warming finally kicks in... we'll be on the other side - creating a black utopia in the land of our ancestors, where humanity began and can begin again...  

Everyone's heard this speech before.  

MOSES (CONT'D): But, hey! If y'all think that's a retreat - hey... y'all are entitled to your opinions... Free speech and all that, right? Ain't that what makes America great? Civilization great? Democracy?... (shakes 'No') Nah. That's an illusion... Not on our side though. On our side, in our utopia... that will be a REALITY.  

An awkward silence again.  

JEROME: Retreat is sometimes... just advancing in a different direction... Right?  

MOSES: (to Jerome) Right! (to others) Right! Exactly!  

The B.A.D.S look back to each other. Moses' speech puts confidence back in them.  

MOSES (CONT'D): Well... What y'all say? Can I count on my people?  

Nadi, Chantal and Tye: sat together... Nod a hesitant 'Yes'.  

TYE: Yeah, man... No sweat.  

Moses opens his hands, gestures: 'Is this over?'. 

MOSES: Good... Good. Glad we're sticking to the original plan.  

The waitress brings over the six coffees.  

MOSES (CONT'D): (to group) I gotta leak.  

JEROME: Yeah, me too.  

Moses leaves for the restroom. Jerome follows.  

CHANTAL: (to Beth) Seriously Beth? We're all leaving our loved ones behind and all you care about is if you can still get laid? 

BETH: Oh, that's big talk coming from you!  

Chantal and Beth get into it from across the table - as:  

TYE: (to Nadi) Hey... Have you told him yet?  

Nadi searches to see if the other two heard - too busy arguing.  

NADI: No, but... I've decided I'm going do it tomorrow. That way I have the night to think about what I'm going to say...  

TYE: (supportive) Yeah. No sweat...  

Tye locks eyes with Nadi, tries to make a connection.  

TYE (CONT'D): But... it's about time, right?  

Underneath the table, Tye puts a hand on Nadi's lap.  

Nadi reacts...: Ashamed? 

EXT. NORTH LONDON - STREET - EARLY MORNING  

A chilly day on a crammed SHOPPING STREET.  

Henry crosses the road. He removes his headphones, stops and stares ahead:  

A large queue has formed outside a Jobcentre - bulked with masked people of MULTIPLE ETHNICITIES.  

Henry lets out a depressing sigh. Pulls out a mask before joins the line.   

Now in line. Henry looks around at passing, covered up faces. Embarrassed.  

Then:  

PING. 

Henry receives a TEXT. Opens it...  

It's from Nadi. TEXT reads:  

'Hey Henry xx Sorry couldn't talk yesterday, but urgently need to TALK to U today. When's best for U??'  

Henry pulls down his mask to type. Excitement glows on his face as he clicks away.  

Cough, cough. This is the screenwriter again. Hopefully you enjoyed what you've heard so far. Stay tuned for the next instalment where we get to know these characters a little better, before they take their journey into the jungles of the Congo... Thanks for reading.
