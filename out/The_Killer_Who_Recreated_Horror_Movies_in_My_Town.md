I’ve been a cop in this town for over a decade. I thought I’d seen everything—domestic disputes, overdoses, even a couple of homicides. But nothing—nothing—prepared me for what happened this summer.

It started with a body behind the old theater. The victim’s chest was slashed open, blood pooling on the asphalt. His arms were pinned out, body arranged like a crucifix. Exactly like the Exorcist scene.

At first, we thought it was some deranged mugging gone wrong. Until the next one.

A week later, a woman was found in her bathtub. Wrists slit, lungs full of water. A portable TV on the counter played only static. And a VHS copy of A Nightmare on Elm Street floated in the bloody bathwater.

That’s when the whispers started.

> “He’s copying movies. Horror movies.”



And they were right.

Every new crime mirrored a scene from a slasher classic. Victims strung up like in Texas Chainsaw. Throats slit like Scream. One poor guy stuffed in a sleeping bag, beaten against a tree until his skull caved in—just like Friday the 13th Part VII.

But it wasn’t just killing. It was directing. Each scene staged. Angles perfect. Props chosen with sick precision.

Like someone was making a movie.

The town fell into chaos. Parents kept kids home. Theaters shut down. Some folks even burned their DVD collections, saying horror cursed us. But the murders didn’t stop.

And then I noticed something: every scene had cameras. Hidden in corners. Always rolling.

Whoever was doing this wasn’t just reenacting. They were filming.

We got our break on a stormy night. An anonymous tip led us to an abandoned warehouse.

Inside, the walls were covered in movie posters, bloodstained scripts, and storyboards drawn in red marker. A tripod stood in the middle, camera still rolling.

And on the monitor—footage of the murders. Cut. Edited. Scored with music.

It wasn’t crime scene tape. It was a film.

And then I saw his face.

Not in person, not yet. But in one of his “behind-the-scenes” clips. A local kid. Early 20s. I knew him instantly—he ran a small YouTube channel where he reviewed horror films. Barely a hundred views per video.

But he’d found a way to make his content stand out.

When we caught him, he didn’t resist. He just grinned and said:

> “They don’t want reviews anymore. They want realism. They want authentic horror. I gave it to them. And they loved it.”



His hands dripped dried blood. Knife dangling from his grip. He leaned in close before we dragged him away and whispered:

> “This isn’t the finale, officer. This is just the first season.”



And then he laughed.

That laugh hasn’t left my head.

Because last night… a brand-new video dropped on his channel.

New murders. Perfectly edited.

Scenes we never found. Crimes we never reported.

But the timestamp says uploaded today.

He’s been locked in a cell for a week.

So tell me…

Who’s still filming?
