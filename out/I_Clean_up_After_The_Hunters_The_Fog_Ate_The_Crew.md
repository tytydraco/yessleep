I’m typing this from a Shell station bathroom off Highway XX in Oregon, the kind with cracked tiles and a flickering fluorescent buzzing overhead. My right hand’s wrapped in a rag, same greasy one, now stiff with blood and pus, where those four gashes from Chicago pulse, blacker and hotter every hour.

My left leg’s propped on a sink, jeans cut open, skin blistered red and weeping from that brood venom four days back, numb below the knee. My hands shake, smearing blood, grease, and wet ash across the keys of my laptop.

It’s 4 a.m., I can’t shake it, the shredder’s snarl from that warehouse, “clean me again,” the brood’s chitter from the sewer, “they’re watching,” now joined by a new sound, a low, wet hiss that coils in my skull like smoke. I’m going insane with these voices piling up, screaming in my head every time I blink, stuck there like hooks I can’t pull out, and I’m wondering how they got in and if they’re connected somehow—shredder, brood, this thing tonight, all clawing at me together.

I clean up after Vanguard Extermination’s hunters. Tonight was my third job. I don’t know how I’m still breathing. If you’ve seen what they hunt or what’s hunting me, tell me how to stop it. I’m out of bleach, out of tricks, and the voices won’t shut up.

Vanguard texted me Wednesday night, three days after that Detroit sewer left me limping and burned. I’d spent the days driving west, F-150 rattling across state lines, crashing in rest stops with the heater on full blast to keep the chill off my leg.

The arm gash festered under the rag, black edges spreading, oozing rank pus I wiped with gas station napkins, the shredder’s snarl louder every time I drifted off. My leg throbbed, venom burn creeping up my thigh, skin peeling where I scratched it raw.

The message buzzed my Nokia at 10 p.m., screen cracked but glowing: “Forest,  Hwy XX , mile marker 42. Mist-wraith cleanup. Hunters done. Bring bleach and mask.” Another grand hit my account, same app, no questions, just orders, like always, but heavier now, like they smelled my blood.

I grabbed my kit from the truck’s bed, mop splintered worse from the sewer, two buckets dented deep, gloves crusted with blood and slime, and that crowbar, chipped and stained. I drove over, headlights cutting fog, shredder’s snarl hissing under the engine, brood’s chitter weaving in, a constant buzz I couldn’t drown.

The forest cleanup was a clearing off Highway XX, a dirt pull-off ringed by pines, snow-dusted and silent under a moonless sky. The air hit me as I stepped out, sharp, 25 degrees, thick with a sour, wet stink, like damp rot and burnt hair.

A Vanguard van sat crooked, black and unmarked, one tire sunk in mud, doors ajar, no hunters around, just boot prints fading into the trees. I hauled my gear out, boots crunching snow, the fog rolling in slow, gray and heavy, curling around my legs like it had weight.

The wraith’s kill zone was deeper in, a hundred yards through pines, branches snapping underfoot, fog thickening until my flashlight beam drowned in it, a dull glow barely cutting the gray. The clearing opened, twenty feet wide, ground littered with bones, human, picked clean, marrow sucked dry, blood streaking the snow in frozen smears.

Webs of fog hung low, shimmering wet, stuck with flesh scraps, fingers, a shred of scalp, a jawbone still dripping red. A hunter’s boot dangled from a pine branch, laces torn, blood crusting the sole, swaying slow in the mist.I gagged, bile sharp in my throat, the stink choking me, rot, ash, and something sour, like meat dissolved in acid. I pulled on my mask, rubber cracked from Chicago, straps biting my ears, the fog seeping through anyway, stinging my eyes.

I started mopping, bleach splashing over bones, fizzing white where it hit the blood, fumes burning my nose until tears blurred my sight. The air hummed, alive with a faint hiss, like steam escaping a pipe, but wetter, deeper, sinking into my skull alongside the shredder’s snarl and brood’s chitter.

I worked fast, mop dragging through the gore, splashing bleach to drown the smell, flashlight propped on a stump, beam swallowed by the fog. The hiss grew louder, a low rumble that shook the snow, mixing with the voices, “clean me again,” “they’re watching,” until a new whisper joined: “you’re meat.”

I froze, mop dripping bleach onto my boots, the fog swirling thicker, pressing against my skin. A bone twitched, femur, cracked, rolling slow across the ground, fog curling tight around it.I swung the crowbar, smashed it, bone splintered, dust flying, but more twitched, ribs, a skull, clattering together, the hiss spiking loud, rattling my teeth. The fog thickened, tendrils coiling, and reformed, a mist-wraith, ten feet tall, gray and shimmering, no face, just a maw of swirling vapor, edges sharp as glass.

It moved fast, tendrils lashed out, slicing the air, the voices screaming in my head: “you’re meat.” It hit the trees first, two hunters I hadn’t seen, stragglers hauling gear from the pines, rifles slung loose.

First guy yelled, tendril slashing his chest, skin melted, ribs dissolved, guts liquefying into a red puddle, steaming in the snow as he dropped, screaming cut short. Second swung his rifle, shot twice, bullets vanishing into the fog, but a tendril coiled his arm, flesh sizzling, peeling off in strips, bone crumbling, blood spraying as he fell, gurgling wet.

A third hunter, older, grizzled, stumbled from the fog, flare gun raised, fired, red light burst, fog flared, but it lashed back, tendril through his throat, melting his jaw, blood and flesh dripping as he collapsed, twitching. I swung the crowbar, hit a tendril, fog parted, hissing loud, but it coiled my right hand, blistering the skin raw, rag burning away, gashes pulsing hot.

I fell, snow soaking me cold, bleach splashing my leg, stinging the venom burn until I bit my lip bloody. The wraith swelled, tendrils lashed, shredding a fourth hunter running in, chest dissolved, guts spilling, legs crumpling as he screamed, fog swallowing him whole.

I crawled, hand raw, leg dragging, crowbar swinging, smashed a tendril, fog hissing, but it lashed my back, burning through my jacket, skin peeling hot. Headlights cut the fog, Vanguard van screeched up, hunters piling out, five now, rifles blazing, rounds ripping mist, tendrils flailing.

The scarred leader from Chicago yelled, “Gas it!” A hunter tossed a canister, flare hit, explosion rocked the clearing, fire roaring, fog burning off, hissing wet as it shrank, tendrils curling black. They didn’t look at me. They dragged two corpses, guts trailing, one headless, blood pooling, leaving me in the ash, flames licking the pines, fog tendrils fading slow into the snow.

I limped up, hand blistered, arm pulsing, leg numb, mopped what I could, bones crunched, blood sloshed, ash smeared under my boots. I grabbed a wraith shard, gray, sharp, still warm, for proof, tucking it with the machete and brood claw, weights cold against my chest.

The hunters lay shredded, first’s guts a puddle, second’s arm gone, third’s throat melted, fourth a heap of flesh and bone. The voices stuck, “you’re meat,” low and wet, weaving with the shredder’s snarl, brood’s chitter, my nose trickling blood, warm down my chin, staining my shirt. I’m losing it, wondering how these things stuck in my head—shredder, brood, wraith—like they’re linked, talking through me, tearing me apart from the inside.

I stumbled out, pines snapping, fog clinging, the cold biting my burned skin. Truck engine coughed, exhaust puffing white as I drove off, clearing shrinking in the rearview. I’m here now, bathroom light buzzing, rag gone, hand blistered red, arm gashes blacker, pulsing alive, oozing pus that stinks rank.

Leg’s numb to the thigh, blisters weeping, jeans dark with blood and venom. Vanguard texted, “Next job Tuesday. Keep quiet,” another grand in my account, app pinging soft. I hear it, shredder snarling, brood chittering, wraith hissing, louder when I blink, like they’re all waiting.

Third job’s worse, something’s hunting me, and Vanguard don’t care. What are they hunting? How do I stop these voices? Are they connected, stuck in me like this arm’s rot? Tell me, I’m out of bleach, and my head’s not mine anymore.
