I'm writing this not out of guilt, but to confess. I've never been caught and I never will. You may say that I'm foolish for telling my tale of horror to millions of users on the internet, but how can you find a man who never existed? Well not literally, but that's beside the point.



I am a killer, and a good one at that. I cleaned up nicely, leaving no body behind - The folks who were unfortunate enough to fall victim to me were never seen again - no evidence there was even a struggle. It was almost saddening watching as the people around town never grew suspicious of their absence.



However I claim to be, I do claim this wholeheartedly - I am not a man. I never was. When born I was born as most were - With flesh and bones and teeth. I never cracked a smile when I never thought I had to, and my horns were small but there. Metaphorically, of course.



Do you, with what I have presented so far, think I am of an evil nature? Oh my dear, of course I am.



If you don’t believe my claims, I shall recant you of my first kill:



Marie entered her room. I looked inside. The door was open to the room, so I could see her clearly. I hear the children crying. In contrast to the ugliness of public space, Marie has made a home for herself. The furniture may be old and worn, but the place is clean and comfortable. If you pay attention, you might notice that it lights up from time to time, but who would know that?



I exhale slowly through my nose. I sit motionless and watch. The little canvas she paints on, it’s still alive. Through a small hole, dawn's sunlight approaches, seeing me looking through it like a spotless window. I’m near one, I’m near a window, I can only assume, given the sunlight was that bright. Interesting.



The door handle can be jiggled, but trying to enter is of no use. I'm locked out. I stood up and stretched out my arms and legs - shaking my head from side to side. My clothes were in tatters. I probably looked like some junkie on the street. Yes, yes I was the equivalent of one, wasn’t I?



The children cry and cry, like scratching a chalkboard I couldn’t take it. I had to find a way in, but the door was locked. How could I get in? The window. I could use the window to get in, and then I applauded myself for my amazing genius.



I walked around the outside of the house, admiring the subtle nuances of it - the colors, the bright colors, and the underused greens of the plants lining the walls - the children’s toys sprinkled on the grass. Oh what a lovely house - it truly was a home. I crept up to the window, ducking low, observing before I strike. I pressed my forehead against the cold glass, the feeling of peace on my sinned skin was an orgasmic feeling - It was the meeting of two worlds completely unaware of the other, but entwined through fate. 



I could spiritually, through touch alone, feel her artistry and creativity, my body almost being a direct conduit for her touch. I had a surge of reactions, sexual in nature. The more I thought about her, her motherly love, her uneventful but loving life, I almost prematurely cummed on my pants. The things I wanted to do to her - These fantasies, these desires of my whore mind, they would be unleashed - and her life, like her art, would have meaning.



The handle was unlocked and I opened the window. I pulled myself into the room. I was in her private world now. I was her world now.



The room was standard in decoration, almost sad really, but I’m a sick fuck, so what do I know? 



Stepping on toe for each foot, I stayed low, I was a mouse in terms of sound, small but squealing. Squealing, thump, thump, thump. Here I come.



I reach the door to the room, open, Marie is there - Unaware. The children must be drowning me out, yes, must be. She is so beautiful, Marie, her skin is soft and warm, her hair lays down and down her back, her nose is crooked, the kind of crooked you’d love to stick your finger up into. She's an angel, oh she is - I must have her.



My hands inadvertently stretch out in front of me, like Frankenstein in a sense. Her neck, I approach, hands ready. I’m getting closer and closer, nearly there, almost able to touch her. How does she not know? How foolish can she be? My body, my hands cast a shadow over her - and she reacts - her eyes light up like a Christmas light, mouth agape but no words leave other than a faint gasp.



I strike, without giving her a chance, I wrap my hands around her soft, soft neck. She scratches, my face was being bombarded with her attempts at survival, but I overpowered her. It was an odd experience to watch someone lose the will to fight - to go from person to body to corpse - her eyes, so full of light before, were dead - drained of energy, gray in a way.



Now that I’ve finished my deed, I knew I had to get rid of the evidence in order to continue living - I had so much more planned. Some days I feel I live in fear of being sadistic, but other days I do not. Opening the window in her room, I picked up her body, maybe weighing 115 lbs. I hoisted her out the window, closed the window, and was carrying what was once my beauty angel to my car.



I put her in the trunk. The best place for all your murdering deeds, am I right? Yeah, I am.



If I recall correctly, I drove for 3 hours to the town’s lake. I made sure no one was around. I took her and wrapped a chain around and around her body, before tossing her into the lake. No one has ever discovered her. And I am not giving away where it is to those of you reading this. What do you think of me? A stupid man? No, I am more than that.



She’s still there floating - My beautiful Marie. I think I’ll give her a visit after I post this.
