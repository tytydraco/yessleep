I remember the start of yesterday evening vividly, and the end not at all. 

My second date with a new beau was going well. The dessert was even better, an exquisite entremet with layers of delicate genoise, cherry mousse, and pistachio praline all coated in a gleaming, bloodred gelée. Unfortunately for me, it stained quite noticeably, right down the front of my brand-new dress. 

“There’s a mall a few minutes away – we can stop on the way,” consoled Henry. “If we hurry, I’m sure we can still make it to Hailey’s party on time.” 

We flagged down the waiter for the check and rushed to his car. After driving a short distance, the large, beige behemoth came into view. It loomed at least three stories overhead, but gave off a sad, neglected vibe. Only a handful of cars dotted the parking lot.

“Do you know what stores they have here?” I asked doubtfully. I’m new to the area and had never been to this mall, but its first impression was not promising. 

“Not sure. This place was the go-to hangout when I was a kid, but it looks like it’s seen better days… It doesn’t hurt to look though.”

We pushed open the grimy, glass doors and started walking. Most of the storefronts were shuttered. There was an aggressively cheerful pretzel stand, a store hawking every imaginable scent of toiletries, and a sketchy convenience store, but not much else. Finally, at the end of a long, deserted corridor, we found a clothing store. It had no name over the door, but the display windows were full of mannequins in colorful attire. 

I started flipping through the rack, but the clothing was all very odd: there were crop-top puffer vests, pleated skirts circa 1999 Brittany Spears, and graffiti-covered oversized tees galore. Half the store was taken up by shelves covered in bucket hats. There was a display of one single type of perfume, and the tangy, sour scent was choking. All the free space on the walls was covered in floor-to-ceiling mirrors. 

I didn’t like the look of the place, but my options were limited. Henry gestured impatiently to a rack of dresses, reminding me that we had little time to spare if we wanted to make it to our acquaintance’s soiree. The tags just had jumbles of letters on them, so sizing was going to be tricky. Choosing the least offensive dress I could find, I asked the cashier if there was a fitting room. He looked at me askance.  

“Sorry, but I really need to try this. I have no idea what size I am here,” I said.

He stared at me for an interminable amount of time, his eyes searching for something in my face. I don’t know what he found, but he eventually pointed at a door in the corner. 

“Second door on the left.”

The door led to a long, white hallway with only one other doorway at the end of it. Pushing it open, a smokey gray warehouse opened up before me. There were dimly lit neon lights like crown molding along the tops of the walls. The cavernous space had what looked like office cubicles at one end and circular tables in the middle. A cluster of people were hunched over one of the tables; they appeared to be writing something in big swooping strokes, or maybe drawing?

“I think I’m in the wrong place,” I muttered, backing up slowly. 
The people turned to look at me, but their faces were wrong - they blurred and shifted, undulating like a field of prairie grass in the breeze. It was almost like those videos of influencers where they’re using a face tuning software and something moves in front of them, making the illusion glitch. Simultaneously, they stood and started walking toward me.

A meaty hand clamped down on my shoulder. 

“What are you doing here?” asked the man as he spun me around to face him. He was large and bald, with vibrant tattoos covering his arms and scalp. “Who were they going to let you color with?”

“Color with? What are you talking about?” I squeaked. 

“Ugh, a rube.” 

With that he pulled a glowing yellow tube out of his pocket, uncorked it, and blew it at me. I remember falling in slow motion and then nothing. 

I woke up this morning on a park bench with a jaundiced tinge to my skin. Henry won’t return my calls or texts.
