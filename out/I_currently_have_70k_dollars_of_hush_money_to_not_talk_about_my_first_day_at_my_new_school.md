Dalton Academy was… not like I had pictured it. 

No sign of the outdoor swimming pool on the brochure or the supposed wellness centre, not to mention it resembled a prison. *Dalton Academy, the school that your child will not be able to stop talking about!* were the words printed all over the website. First thing's first, I'm not a child, I just turned nineteen, and Dalton is more of a college, or a high school for older kids. 

Admittedly, it did look appealing from the photos. But now I was looking at the thing in real life, a crumbling structure which looked ready to topple over– I realized the images I had seen were most likely taken a decade ago.

So much for the heated pool and jacuzzi I had been promised. 

There was no sign of life, apart from an empty chip wrapper blowing by, like a tumble weed. The bars on the windows were the first thing I saw when I jumped out of the car, stumbling, my cuffed hands doing nothing to stabilise me. 

*Were cuffs really necessary?*

Apparently in 2023, they were. 

Very dystopian– or Mom was playing some kind of joke, which was bordering on child abuse. I could imagine her now, hiding behind a wall, ready to jump out and *teach me a lesson* as if mentally traumatising her son was a "gotcha" moment she could post on Facebook. 

"Wait here," the driver told me in a gruff, to-the-point growl, which froze me in place. I think this was the moment I started wondering if my Mom had secretly wanted to send me to either juvie, or just straight up prison. 

I want to preface this. I only punched a guy in the face and was suspended from my old college, so if this was what the punishment was for a simple right hook to the nose, then I dreaded to think what committing an actual crime would harbour. 

I nodded to the driver, my gaze travelling to the back seat, where I could have sworn the seats were… discoloured. 

They were supposed to be white, but something was ingrained into plush leather. I sat in the passenger seat on the journey to Dalton, so I never saw it. 

Before I could look closer, a voice sent me twisting around, and I was met with an armed guard.  This guy towered over me, six foot something, a real monster with slightly glazed over eyes, his hands already twitching around the hefty looking gun strapped to his chest. Instead of going trigger happy, he pulled out a clipboard, a ratty piece of paper barely being held in place, flapping in the breeze that had picked up. 

This had to be a joke, surely. 

Dalton Academy was supposed to be a school for troubled kids, but *this* troubled? This messed up? Would I be attending calculus with a murderer? Mom had screwed me over. That was all I could think in a panic, my stomach twisting and turning. The lady who convinced her into sending me to this place, Mrs. Caraval, had also screwed me over. 

"Alex Caine?" The guard's eyebrows furrowed, narrowed eyes flicking to the clipboard in his hands, and then back to me in quick succession. He looked confused. Which was better than  pissed. 

There was a sound which was driving me crazy, buzzing I couldn't get out of my head, like a swarm of mosquitoes had nested inside my skull. 

"Alex Caine," the guard repeated. "Confirm your name."

Nodding, I did my best to smile. 

"It's *Caines–*" I started to correct him, before the words were drawn from my lips, the cold sting of his palm slamming into my cheek. The sound made me cringe, skin against skin. It was a simple and yet terrifying gesture that reminded me I was not allowed to speak. Which was my sudden new reality. The force of the hit almost sent me stumbling  back, and I did sort of sway backwards on my heel, narrowly avoiding falling straight on my ass.

Before I could formulate words in my mouth, the guy grabbed my shoulder and started dragging me, not inside the school's entrance, a set of automatic doors which was the only modern thing about the place, but across rough tarmac towards what looked like an abandoned football field that used to hold pep rallies and weekly games, now converted into what almost looked like a fire drill from first glance. There were four lines. A, B, C, and D. And the buzzing sound in my head collapsed into a low whine. I felt goosebumps across the bare flesh of my arms, my jacket suddenly having a mind of its own. 

I can only describe it as the sensation of opening an oven and being blasted in the face with intense heat. 

It wasn't quite heat that hung in the air, however. It was something I couldn't explain, a static buzz hanging above me and playing with my hair. Getting closer, it started to build in my throat like a thick paste, suffocating my lungs. 

Stumbling forwards, the guard shoving me closer to the field, I started to realize what this sensation which was ripping me apart was. It was them. These kids, what looked like eighteen and nineteen year olds, were in the same position as me, their wrists cuffed in front of them, surrounded by a deluge of guard's treating them like… animals. 

The A's were the odd ones out. 

While the other groups were filled with pushing and shoving and swearing at each other, attacking guard's and screaming, the A's stood silently– and bizarrely, were each wearing a pair of bright red rubber gloves. 

Something ice cold slithered down my spine when I glimpsed one of the A's standing at the very front of their queue. Her eyes didn't meet anything or anyone, oblivious of the whirlwind around her. 

Dark red hair framed her face in a halo, half lidded eyes glued to something I could not see, her head inclined slightly as if to appear confused, and yet there was no expression on her face. I could sense myself starting to back away, my stomach volleying into my throat. 

This girl had no life in her eyes, no ignition in her features, because she was dead, I thought, the word registering like a cold wave slamming into me. 

The gaping bullet wound in the middle of her and every other A's forehead, told me that. 

**Dead.**

Dead, and yet somehow standing. 

"I don't think…" the words *I don't think I'm supposed to be here* dried up in my throat when the cruel metal of the guard's gun stuck into my spine. There was nowhere to run. When I was shoved, unceremoniously, into the group of D students, it started to hit me that this was Real. So was that feeling, that weight in the air pushing into me, climbing into my lungs. 

I couldn't breathe, just standing near them. I had to turn my head and suck in precious gulps of oxygen from the open air behind me. One guy was kneeling on the ground, trying to bite through his cuffs, while a girl was rocking backwards and forwards, screaming into her lap her trembling fingers inched over her ears to block out the screams. "I'm not supposed to be here," I managed to get out in a breath, drinking in the other D's around me. When a gunshot rang out across the field, I grabbed the closest person to me, and shook him. Touching him, though, was a mistake. It felt like someone had stuck a metal rod into my skull and stirred my brain into soup. 

His presence sent chills down my spine, almost taking me to my knees. I staggered back. "I'm… fuck, I'm not supposed to be here!" The boy pulled away with a scowl, and I noticed something lit up in his cupped hands. 

*Fire.*

I could see orange light writhing up and down his fingers, a tiny dancing flame. 

I searched for a lighter, but how could he cup fire in his hands without scalding himself? These kids were fucking crazy. I was suddenly all too aware of a girl standing up, just the simple movement of her getting to her feet, almost knocking me off kilter. In the corner of my eye, I noticed the A's were being marched off of the field. 

"Alright!" a guard boomed, situating himself in front of us. "We're going to start the induction process. If either of you have anything to offer us, you better talk fast." Immediately, the other A's stumbled into a clumsy looking line. I tried to raise my hands to tell them that I did not belong there, and if I did, there had been some fucked up kind of mistake– before I was being sandwiched between two other kids. 

I was so close to them, the three of us pancaked together, a dull pain throbbed in the back of my head. This pressure is something I can't put into words. It fucked with my head, with my thoughts  fraying my vision. When I pressed my cuffed hands to my nose and lips, they came back glistening intense red. 

When my body swayed forwards, the pressure coming off the off the boy in front, only flung me back, and I wondered if my brain was going to explode if one of them shoved into me. Unfortunately for me, I had no idea what was going on, slowly suffocating between two equally powerful pressures. My ears popped, and I could hear nothing but my own shaky breaths as the line in front of me got shorter. 

I started drifting back to fruition as I got closer to the front, my cloudy vision clearing a little. I didn't notice it until I stared down at the ground, and found myself standing in pooling crimson bleeding across dead grass. 

It was thick and red, like the ground itself was wounded. I couldn't move. 

Trapped between two powerful pressure's keeping me in place, all I could do was focus on keeping the perfect distance away from the both of them, the soles of my shoes turning the same shade as the grass. I didn't notice I was at the front of the line until the voice sliced into me, jerking my head up. 

"Nicholas Leviathan," the guard called out, and the guy in front of me stumbled forwards, relieving me only slightly from his pressure. The boy's head was bowed, but I could see his lips were moving, fingers tightening into fists. The guard's lips curved in amusement. 

"Stand down, Nicholas," he said, chuckling. "I know your father, and I don't think he'd want you to step out of line."

"He's not my dad," the boy said in a low growl bordering on a sob. "You killed my mom and dad. You're a monster."

"We killed your human parents," the guard corrected him. "Because you do not belong in this world. We are simply taking you back to your real family."

The guy, or Nick, was muttering something again, and I could have sworn a purplish light was igniting across the palms of his hands, sparks bleeding across his fingers, before the guard laughef heartily. "Knock it off," he said, "Your father is one of the most respected witches among us. It pains me to see his son struggle with basic magic." he cleared his throat, and I glimpsed the red slicked across his fingers when he ran a hand through his hair. Witches, I thought dizzily. Was that what I was surrounded by? He pointed his gun at the kid, his finger inching toward the trigger. Nick, for some reason, was personal. "Now. What do you have to offer us?  Come on, magic boy, don't be shy! Call it recruitment before I press the off switch."

"Fuck you." was all Nick grumbled, to which the guard only laughed. 

"Yeah, I didn't think so. You were always a little brat. Your mother was too human. You're too much like her."

Nick shook his head, and that purplish light was glowing brighter, flickering, like it was weak. He seemed to give up, then, his fingers coming apart. "Our parents are going to find us," he said, in a tone that suggested he too was playing mind games. Nick's lips formed a small, spiteful smile. "Then you'll be answering to them, you fucking toad–" 

His voice cut off, a gunshot rattling in my skull. 

For a moment, there was no sound but a slight ringing. 

I screamed into my cuffed hands, squeezing my eyes shut. The world turned topsy turvy, and I was only aware of the *thud* of the boy hitting the ground. When I dared open my eyes, he was crumpled on dead grass  in pooling, stemming red. And the pressure weighing down on my skull completely disappeared. I glimpsed his hands were still glowing, the intense purple light fading. If I concentrated, so were the pieces of skull and chunks of brain scattering the ground. I was watching the boy's body jolt, like it had been shocked, the bullet wound in his head moving like it was alive, like something was burrowing under his flesh, when the guard shouted, "Next!" 

I strode forwards, like I was in a dream. 

At this point, I wanted to get it over with. I was shaking, trying to speak, trying to tell them that I wasn't like these other kids. But my gaze kept snapping to the guy's corpse, and the movement I could see under his skin.

The guard's lips upturned into a sneer when he snapped at me to pay attention, and I forced myself to make eye contact with him, despite knowing there was something wrong with Nicholas's body. Dead bodies were not supposed to jolt like that. His eyes were still open, his pupils filling with a darker purple, almost black, snaking around his iris. 

"Alex Caine," the guard pointed his gun in my face, his patience seemingly fried. This man was done talking. "What power do you have to offer our organisation in finally bringing down the humans, hmm?" He laughed when I managed to open my mouth to tell him, **Are dead bodies supposed to, like, fucking, sit up?** Because that is exactly what Nicholas was doing, slowly getting to his feet. 

The man either didn't notice, or didn't care. 

"Come on, Alex! You're a Caine! Your family are some of the most powerful witches I've ever seen!" he chuckled, striding towards me and sticking his gun into my temple. His breath stunk of cigarette smoke and coffee, turning my gut. "It's such a shame I blew all their brains out, huh."

His eyes were inhuman, cold and grey. 

They held no sympathy. 

No compassion. 

I was not the boy he was talking about, but I don't think he cared. 

The world seemed to stop and then start again, when the barrel of his hand-held protruded deeper into my flesh. 

"Wait!" 

The voice wasn't enough to bring me from my reverie. Because it could have been a trick. They wanted me to open my eyes and risk having hope, before tearing it away. But no. I knew that voice. When I risked prying open my eyes, a woman was stumbling across the field in heels, almost toppling over before righting herself. "Alex!" 

Her voice was high, slightly hysterical, and relieved by her wide smile. Mrs. Caraval. I didn't think she held any kind of authority over these monsters, but she yanked me out of the line of kids, after a short hissing match with the guard, who's lip curled in disgust. 

"Human?" was all he scoffed, before giving her a curt nod. "Get him out of here," he grunted, nodding to Nicholas, who now resembled one of the "A" kids. 

"Before I turn the power back on."

Nodding, Mrs. Caraval took my arm. I didn't realize I was in a daze until she grabbed me, and I didn't move. 

"Alex, come on," she said in a polite laugh. "I made a mistake. Let's not make a scene."

I looked for Nicholas, but he was gone. 

The only thing remaining of him was the slightest bit of pressure I could sense, grazing the back of my mind, and the ugly smear of red on the grass. 

Mrs. Caraval turned to me, her eyes widening in horror when she saw the state I was in. 

She was already pulling out a scrap of tissue paper, swiping at my bloody lips and chin. "I am so sorry! Your school is *DEATON* Academy! I must have gotten the paperwork mixed up!" she told me in sharp breaths, sputtering out a laugh. 

She didn't acknowledge the stains on the grass, or the eerie silence, apart from stray kids sobbing to themselves. Mrs Caravel kept talking, laughing about traffic being bad, and being embarrassed that she had gotten the school wrong— while I was trying not to heave up my stomach, holding onto her for dear life. 

It wasn't until I was sitting in the back of her car, when it registered that I was alive. But my shoes were still covered in their blood. Mrs Caraval's voice was white noise, when my gaze found a struggling figure being pulled towards Dalton. There was a bag on his head. Extra security. Alex. The real Alex, who was going to take my place in the line. 

I watched his squirming form until it was a shadow in the distance, and we were driving away from Dalton. 

The plush leather underneath me was still warm.

Had Alex sat in my seat? Did he know he was being driven to his death? 

**Or whatever came after death...**

*"Your school is DEATON Academy! I got the wrong one!" How could I be so stupid? Honestly, it's a memory thing, but you have to admit! Both school's sound similar!"* Mrs Caraval had said the same thing four times since we started the long journey back to my town– or maybe I was hallucinating. 

I didn't blink until we were outside my Mom's house. 

Home. 

I wanted to feel relief, but staring down at my shoes, the soles were still smeared red. 

I lurched up to jump out of the car, vomit choking the back of my throat, when Mrs Caraval stopped me. She didn't open the door. "What is your email address, Alex?" she asked cheerfully. "or just give me your PayPal!" 

I said my email in a daze, my lips barely moving, and she pulled out her phone, tapped the screen several times, and then shot me a wide smile. "There! That's 70k, kid! Don't spend it all at once!" When I could only stare at her blankly, she cleared her throat, tucking a stray hand of hair behind her ear. 

"The school I sent you to was a… juvenile detention for, uh, let's call them, gifted individuals. There is no need to speak to anyone about this. I hope I am making myself very clear."

When I couldn't reply, she gestured for me to get out– and when I did, her hand fell on my shoulder, fingernails digging into my skin. "The principal of Dalton Academy sends his regards," she said, her tone darkening. "Remember, sweetie, he knows exactly where you live! So, do us all a favor and keep your mouth shut, okay? 70k is a lot of cash!" 

Before I could reply, her lips twisted into a grin. I stumbled out of the car, and she stuck head out of the window, sliding a pair of raybans over cutting eyes. "Have fun at your new school!" 

I thought this woman was fucking with me, but yeah, I actually have 70k. 

Hush money. 

So, I have 70k and a secret that is driving me crazy. 

Who the fuck were those kids, and would I be putting myself at risk by telling the authorities?
