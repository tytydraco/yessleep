  


Sometimes when you walk through the forest, it plays tricks on you. Lefts become rights and rights become lefts. You could walk on the same path for hours only to turn around and realize you've only taken a few steps, and sometimes if you look in a puddle your reflection will blink back at you. I have become well accustomed to these tricks. I have walked these trails many times, but they have never been as aggressive as they were during my last trip. 

  


It was just like any other of my treks at first, being aware of the forest's deceptions I brought a rifle along with more standard backpacking supplies. The start was standard, it usually was. It would be completely undesirable from a normal forest if it wasn't for the complete silence, not a chirp of a bird or a rustle of leaves. I continue forward these trees have put me through worse. It remained silent until the sun fell, when a far too familiar sound echoed through the air, a scream. I struggle to discern if it's genuine or one of the forest deceptions. Best not dwell on it, I need to start running either way. My steps are rhythmic, I must not show fear, I must not show weakness. I continue my stride, I need to find a clearing before darkness, can't camp on the trail and I most definitely can't camp in those god forsaken trees. The sun is down and no clearing is in sight, compromises must be made. I set up my tent in the center of the path trying to keep it as far from the tree line as possible. I lie on the polyester floor of the tent, the uneven terrain digs into my back. A rustle emanates from outside my tent, I grab my rifle and raise it to my shoulder. I leave my tent and I am met by two deer, I line one of them up with my sites and pull the trigger. The deer collapses to the ground with thud. Its accomplice stares at me with its soulless eye, its mouth opens as the sound of my gunshot echoes through the forest.

  


I chamber another cartridge and pull the trigger. The bullet pieces the deer's skull yet the beast is still staring me down, blood dripping from the new hole in its head. Suddenly the skin on its skull it's being stretched outwards as the familiar sound of snapping bone rattle around me. The center of its skull splits in half revealing rows of hidden teeth. The reprobate approaches me, I unload yet another bullet to no effect. I can feel its hot breath on my skin, I accept my fate as I prepare for the beast to deliver the final blow. Only for a deafening shriek to piece the air, the beast raises its head away from me. Its head reconnects as it stampers towards the source of the sound. My confusion only lasted a moment, I quickly started to collapse my tent. I can not risk another one finding me. As much as I didn't want to, I would have to travel back during the night.
