Hey guys, another update.

I know you’ve all been telling me not to go back, but I can’t just walk away. Not at this point. I opened the basement door, and I don’t know what I unleashed, but it’s my fault that things are escalating.Jamie was now being hunted, tormented… even in ways I couldn’t see.

I didn’t know where else to turn. Nothing I’d tried so far had worked. The crystals hadn’t worked, the house itself seemed alive with menace, and Jamie… he was terrified. 

And I couldn’t let him face it alone.

So I did the only thing I could think of: I went to the church. I’m not religious. I’ve never been religious. When I was a child my parents would occasionally take me to mass for Christmas but it was never a big thing in our family.

But, what happened to Jamie.. The only word I can think of is ‘possession’. I’ve seen The Exorcist, and it’s the closest comparison I can make. Is something possessing him? I was out of my depth and needed help from someone with more experience.

The small parish sat at the edge of town, old stone walls worn smooth from decades of wind and rain. Inside, the church felt hauntingly empty. Rows of polished wooden pews stretched into shadowed silence, each one unoccupied. Flickering candles cast a trembling glow, their light dancing across the worn stone floor. The sweet, heavy scent of incense hung in the air, weaving through the stillness of the large, hollow interior. Even with the vast emptiness, I felt a comfort as I stood at the door… like I was in a safe space.

I walked in slowly, unsure of how to even approach this. I sat down in a pew feeling awkward and out of place. After a few minutes a priest emerged from a door behind the altar. I stood up and he gave me a kind, welcoming smile. He was elderly, with white hair and thin glasses. 

I approached him slowly, my hands shaking. I was embarrassed to even say the words. “Father… I - I need help,” I said, voice tight, uneven.

He gave me a small, encouraging smile and gestured toward the pew beside him. “Tell me,” he said quietly. “I’ll listen.”

So I did.

Once I started, I couldn’t stop. The words poured out of me in a rush, faster than my breath, tumbling over each other as I tried to explain the impossible: how I thought little Jamie was possessed, and everything that had led me to believe it. The basement door. The knocks. The voice that didn’t belong. The crystals that failed. The mirror. Objects moving on their own. The flickering lights that seemed to respond to our fear.

By the end my hands ached from twisting together so tightly, and my throat was raw.

The priest sat quietly through it all, fingers steepled, his face unreadable. He didn’t interrupt. Didn’t laugh. Didn’t dismiss me the way so many others might have. He just listened.

When silence finally settled between us, I found myself waiting for his verdict as though my entire hope rested on his next breath.

“I understand,” he said at last. His voice was calm, deep, carrying a weight that seemed to fill the space between us. “Sometimes we feel a presence that isn’t Godly in our home.”

Relief surged in me. He believed me… or at least, he didn’t think I was insane.

“So you’ve dealt with this before?” I asked quickly, almost desperately. I needed to hear that this wasn’t uncharted territory, that others had faced it… and survived.

He gave a measured nod. “I’ve done many house blessings. I can come and perform a prayer. It may help bring peace to you all.”

I bit my lip. A house blessing. It sounded too simple, too… ordinary. Just like the energy cleansing with crystals that failed a couple weeks ago. Did he understand what we were up against?

“What about an exorcism?” The word slipped out sharper than I meant it to, like a stone tossed into still water.

The priest chuckled softly, not cruelly, but in a way that made my cheeks burn. “Exorcisms are rarely what people think. Why don’t we start with a blessing? If things persist, we’ll see what needs to be done.”

I nodded, swallowing my disappointment. Maybe he was right. Maybe I’d seen too many movies, let my imagination fill in gaps that didn’t belong. Maybe a simple prayer would be enough.

Still, I couldn’t shake the gnawing sense that it wouldn’t.

I didn’t want to waste any time. “Can you come Friday evening?”

The night of the blessing, the storm had returned with a vengeance. Rain pelted the windows like stones, wind rattled the old frame, and the house groaned as if in protest. Jamie clung to my hand, his small body tense and shivering, eyes wide and fearful. 

As always, David and Margaret left without any kind of conversation, which I was glad about. I hadn’t told them about what happened to Jamie last week. If I thought they were the type of parents that might do something about it, or at the very least comfort him, then maybe I would. But they didn’t seem to prioritise Jamie’s safety.. Or even care about it. Plus, how would you even start a conversation like that? “So, while you were gone, we had a snack, played with Lego - oh, and by the way your son was possessed”?

As much as I dreaded my Friday nights at the house, I felt a bond with Jamie that I couldn’t break. We were in this together, I wasn’t going to let him fight it alone.  It broke my heart to think that the rest of the week - when I wasn’t there - he would have no one to hold his hand, no one to cuddle him.. Be there for him. 

I asked the priest to come just after 6. David and Margaret always left promptly so I didn’t need to worry about them crossing paths. I didn’t want them to know that I had arranged for a house blessing. Not that I think they would have been against it.. But they aren’t the type of people that seemed open to any kind of discussion, let alone one involving God and demons and possessions. It was easier just to do this without having that talk.

Plus, I just don’t know how much I can trust them. I don’t think they’re inherently bad people… but… there’s something off about them. The way they are with Jamie. Like they don’t want to be near him. 

The priest’s small blue car turned into the driveway a little after David and Margaret pulled away. The sound of tires crunching over the gravel reached me in the hallway, and for the first time in weeks, I felt something I hadn’t allowed myself to feel: hope. Relief washed through me so strongly it was almost dizzying. Maybe this was it. Maybe tonight everything would change.

When the knock came at the door, I opened it quickly, almost too quickly, and stepped aside to let him in. He gave me a kind nod, his features calm, unbothered by the storm that had begun to stir outside. I searched his face for even the smallest trace of unease, some flicker of fear in his eyes, but found none. If anything, he seemed steady. Grounded. It soothed me in a way I didn’t expect.

Jamie pressed himself against my side, his small fingers gripping the fabric of my sleeve so tightly my arm tingled. His wide eyes followed every movement the priest made as he unpacked a small bag, carefully placing its contents - a gold crucifix, a vial of holy water, a slim leather-bound bible - on the table.

The priest didn’t waste time with ceremony. No hesitation, no nervous glances around the house, no questions about whether I’d exaggerated. He simply began. Moving slowly, deliberately, he walked the length of the hallway, dipping his fingers into the holy water and sprinkling it against the doorframes, murmuring prayers under his breath in a steady rhythm. The sound was low, almost soothing, like a chant that wrapped itself around the walls.

I followed his lead, repeating the words where he prompted, though my voice shook. I kept Jamie tucked close to me, murmuring reassurances in his ear even as I leaned into the priest’s words like a lifeline.

I waited for the bangs, the cold air, the voice… anything. But it was silent.

For the first time, I dared to let my shoulders drop. My chest loosened.

It was working.

I smoothed Jamie’s hair, as he clung to me, whispering, “See? It’s okay. He’s helping us.” And for a heartbeat, I believed it too.

Everything was still. Peaceful. As though the very walls had settled, sighing out their centuries of tension. I let myself imagine, for the briefest, most dangerous moment, that the nightmare was finally ending. That this was all it had taken.

Finally, the priest announced the blessing was over. The storm outside still shook the house, but inside, it felt steady. 

The priest packed his things. “Hopefully that will be the end of any disturbances” he said.

I nodded, relief washing over me.  
  
“Thank you, Father,” I whispered, my voice thin with exhaustion but heavy with gratitude. He gave me a gentle nod before stepping outside, the front door clicking shut behind him with a finality that seemed to echo through the quiet house.

I let out a shaky sigh I hadn’t realized I’d been holding. Glancing down, I looked at Jamie leaning against me, his small body warm and fragile, his eyelids heavy with weariness. For the first time in what felt like forever, I allowed myself the dangerous thought that maybe, just maybe, it was finally over.

Then -

A deafening crash split the night. My heart leapt into my throat. My stomach turned over.

I ran to the front door, Jamie clinging to my arm trembling, his small fingers digging into mine.

And then I heard it-a voice, deep and guttural, booming through the storm:

**“I WARNED YOU.”**

I froze, blood running cold. The storm whipped around me, but that voice wasn’t the wind. It was deliberate. Malicious. Mocking.

I swung open the door, and my heart sank in horror. The priest’s car had smashed into a massive tree at the end of the driveway. The windshield shattered, the hood crumpled. Rain poured over him, soaking his figure. He was slumped against the steering wheel, motionless.

“Father!” I screamed, running toward the car, shaking, heart hammering. I yanked open the door and tried to check for a pulse, hands trembling and wet.

He didn’t move. Not a twitch. Not a breath I could feel. I couldn’t even tell if he was alive.

Jamie whimpered behind me, small and scared. “What’s happening?”

I had no answer for him. 

I looked into his big sacred eyes, searching mine for comfort, for safety. I decided then.

I’m going to get him out of this house…
