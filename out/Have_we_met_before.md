Hello again, or, is it just, hello? Have we met this time around? There are too many people to remember them all, so forgive me if I forget your name. I need your help, I don't know how I wound up in this situation but I seem to have been ground hog day'd. I have seen the world ending thousands of times and I need someone to help me.



It wasn't world ending apocalypses initially it started out with small things, I'd get hit by a car and die, so the next time round I would wait till the car went past, then cross the street. Just little things like that, after the first hundred or so times around though, things started to get a little more extreme, the first such example was a man with a knife who charged me and stabbed me to death, so I called the police ahead of time. They made it, stopped him from attacking me and hit me with a stray bullet when the knife man charged them. After that, I took a different route to the coffee shop. The first time I actually made it to the coffee shop a gas line exploded when I arrived and killed me, and, I assume everyone else there at the same time.



After that I decided to try and leave town, so I went to catch a train, which promptly derailed and took out everyone on the platform as it did so. The strange thing is though, that I checked the news while I was on the platform and the gas line didn't explode this time around.



That got me thinking, if bad things were only happening to kill me, what if I just stayed home and waited it out. Well, the only time I tried that I was the victim of a plane crash in my own livingroom. I decided that my best course of action was to wander the city for the day and do my best to be aware of my surroundings, and wouldn't you know it, it got me further than anything I'd tried so far, but ultimately failed when we were hit with a chemical weapon strike



At that point I came to the decision that I should stay away from crowds to minimize the casualties, the problem was that I didn't own a car, so my options were public transport or walk, and public transport hadn't treated me well today. I started walking first thing in the morning, by noon I was on the city outskirts with lifestyle blocks lining the highway. I made sure to stay well away from any vehicle that I saw on the road. That, of course, didn't stop the bombs from killing me. I turned around after the bright flash and, a couple seconds later, woke up back in my bed. The next few attempts I tried running, but for the first time, the exact cause of death repeated itself. That's when I realized that the only way to prevent an event was to be safely out of it's reach. I spent a few attempts trying to find the most accessible bike I could to “borrow”, after a few attempts I found that one of the bikes at the convenience store had been left unlocked. That time I made it to the next town over, turns out, they were quite earthquake prone. It took a few attempts, but I eventually found a safe spot to weather the earth quake.



The declaration of war came next several world leaders were assassinated all at once and everyone blamed everyone else, and then the missiles began to fly, and, surprise surprise, the first nuke hit the town in was in. Interestingly enough, if I didn't go to that town, the war didn't happen, I figured that since I was far enough from that first nuke that I didn't die immediately, then it had to be a different cause of death.



I had taken to keeping up with the news to try and avoid anything that seemed dangerous. I basically gave up when I saw that a virus had swept across more than half of the Continental United States in a matter of hours, leaving very few survivors in its wake. The experts were saying 97% of the population was dead within 5 minutes of first symptoms, and believe me, it was not a comfortable 5 minutes. After that I tried to break the loop myself a couple of times, if you catch my drift. That, evidently also didn't work. That's when I had an idea scuba gear should have enough oxygen for me to last at least the initial pass of the virus, and if the pattern holds, that meant that it wouldn't happen at all. I was right, I looked like an idiot in a stolen scuba mask, but I was right. That still didn't stop the meteor though, and that's where I've been stuck for the past few hundred days, 3.37pm, the world ends. And I don't know if there is any way, aside from breaking the time loop, to stop it. Which brings us to the reason I'm writing this now. I think I have figured out a way to break it. I've spent a few decades at this point studying mythology about time loops and I think I know which one I'm in.



Are you familiar with the concept of purgatory? Well, it's kind of like that, except, I'm not dead yet, and it's contagious. It's a punishment and once I have made amends and atoned for my sins, I believe I will be set free. It also turns out that, by sharing my knowledge I have spread the reach of this curse. Thank you all, for taking on a portion of my suffering and making penance for my sins.



If you want my advice, don't dodge the car, it hurts a lot less than the feeling of you lungs liquefying in you chest.



Goodbye for now, I'll see you on the next go around.
