Before I begin, I just want to say that if any of the government officials involved in this are reading this, then I don’t care anymore, fuck you and your NDA.

Okay, here goes: in 2010, I was fresh out of college with a degree in archeology. Archeology jobs, as you can imagine, are few and far between. I was working in catering when I got an email from my old professor. She wanted to let me know about a government program I might be interested in. Said program was an archeological initiative to uncover possible remnants of the first human settlements in the Americas. Some years prior, human footprints had been discovered in New Mexico, dating back some 23,000 years, some 9000 years earlier than what we had previously thought the earliest human settlements had been. It might be hard to understand how mind-blowing this was to the archeological community. Because of this, there was a gold-rush to the south-west, everyone hoping to find the next big breakthrough that would forever alter our knowledge of human migration. The government program was ostensibly only for students as a cost cutting measure, but given my interest and prior research into the the late Pleistocene epoch, she had made a special accommodation for me. The only catch was that I would have to leave my home in Michigan and move to the deserts of New Mexico for nine months. I didn’t hesitate.

Despite what happened towards the end of the program, the first five months on site were some of the best of my life. I was stationed at dig site Romeo, an area I later learned that the local indigenous tribes had specifically told us not to go. I had all but given up on any hope of fulfilling work in the field. 	At best, I might be able to land a quiet job in the caverns of some university, staring at shards of pottery under buzzing fluorescents, slowly driven mad by the yellowing lead paint and lack of sunlight. But here I was, in the burning heat of the New Mexico summer, my body becoming tan and lean as I poured through the ancient dirt. Were we digging up pottery? Of course, but they were fresh to us, newly awoken from their time in the soil, plucked like crops from a garden. We would gather around it like a newborn as centuries of darkness were wiped from its exterior, a quiet understanding between us that this thing had a life we could hardly imagine, and it had survived, so that we may look upon it once more, as the treasure it is.

I miss them, the other researchers. How when the sun settled behind the horizon and we had washed away the dust from our skin, we would gather together around bonfires, aching from the day’s labor and eat together. We sang songs, shared stories from back home, discussed articles and research papers, told of our hopes for what our futures may hold. I met Cara there. I’ll never forget when we first met, before we grew close over those few months, how I would watch her laugh by the fire, her knees tucked up to her her chest and her short, raven hair flitting in the breeze. I remember seeing the fire’s reflection in her eyes and wondering if it was really a reflection after all.

Then we found it.

I still feel the tightness in my chest, feeling the energy around  Romeo. It began when as a flat stone buried beneath the soil. I couldn’t place the stone entirely. It looked crystalline, smooth as glass, but opaque and the colour of charcoal, completely alien next to the yellow white earth of the New Mexico desert. We dusted the stone gently, expecting an edge. But none came. The perfectly even stone slab stretched beyond the borders of the pit like a marble floor. It was during my shift in the pit, when we started expanding outward, that a heard a trembling voice exclaim something in a panic.


Words. He had found words. At least, a few errant, unrecognisable runic carvings cut into the stone. As we dug further, those words became sentences, unreadable but undeniably sentences. Further still, more words, but strangely in a complete separate form. Another language. Still unknown to us.

When we finally laid down our shovels, the entire team stood around the edge of the pit, staring down at this vast rock with its unrecognisable etchings in the center. No one smiled. Our faces hung, numb with awe. Some wept. No one spoke. The only sound in the desert was the wind around our ankles and the distant screech of a vulture. I don’t know what forced me to turn my head, but I did, and peered over at a hill on the horizon. I saw three figures there, watching. Natives. I couldn’t help but feel they knew, somehow, what would come from this. 

A few researchers walked on the slab, as if they could gleam any more knowledge of it from twenty feet below. Mandelson, a senior researcher, laid down on his, his ear pressed to the stone.

“Fuck.” I remember him saying, “fuck, it’s not a slab.”

“What do you mean?” Someone asked.

“It’s not a slab. It’s hollow, on the other side. It’s hollow. This isn’t a slab. This is a roof.”

We stopped the bonfires around then. Everybody went to their tents, refused to speak, just stared into the middle distance. Even Cara and I, holding one another on a single camp bed, couldn’t find any words. We should have been excited. This was the most incredible archaeological discovery since the Rosetta Stone, but all we could muster were a few murmurings in the night.

We all watched as Mandelson chipped away at the roof. It was like watching Carter casting light through the walls of Tutankhamun’s tomb. When he finally created a hole large enough, a light was lowered down.

“Christ, it’s huge…” Mandelson muttered. But he saw nothing. Not even the bottom.

The hole was enlarged. A team was going in. In any other archaeological discovery like this, the students would be tearing at each other at a chance to volunteer. This felt more like a draft. Five students were to accompany Mandelson below. Cara was one of them.

They were down there for just twenty minutes or so. I pulled Cara up out of the pit and asked her what did she see. She was white as cotton.
	“They were like… barrels.” She whispered, not looking me in the eye.
	I felt her trembling. It was the last time I saw her whole.

Cara, Mandelson and the rest of the team died shortly after. Their symptoms were all the same. Vomiting, burns… they rotted as their hearts kept beating. The site was shut down, covered up. Officially, it never existed. The researchers who spent their summer there aren’t to talk about it, aren’t to make contact with anyone else involved. I haven’t left Michigan since returning home. I don’t know what that thing was out there. I don’t want to know. I want it to stay buried.

I miss you, Cara.
