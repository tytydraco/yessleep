As I live and breathe, I know this: among all those in this broken world, none have suffered such as myself.  
  
At eight years old, I had never met friends or playmates. Mother did not trust outsiders and kept me from socializing. She would not let me be hurt as she was. She felt as though, in her fierce overprotectiveness, she was looking out for me and gave me all her love, leaving none for herself.  
  
My father was a broad man with a short and explosive temper. He racked up assault charges as if he was doing it for sport. In my early years, he had yet to take it out on me or Mother to his credit.  
  
One night, close to my 9th birthday, I overheard my Mother and Father arguing over me,  
  
“Michael is weak and clingy. He comes to us like a puppy expecting a treat. It’s pathetic.” Father said to his wife dispassionately, a flask of whisky in hand.  
  
“What is wrong with you?! He’s a well-behaved and sensitive boy! If you gave him a chance to get to know you, you’d come to love him too!” Mother snapped back. She found any offense on her son much worse than an offense on herself.  
  
“You’ve raised a loser, Mary! You coddle him! I had guts! He’ll be eaten up when he gets into the real world.” Father replied, his attitude escalating.  
  
“How dare you, Jacob! You bastard! I will never let my child suffer!” Mother cried out through a heavy flow of tears. Father got up and walked away without a glance at his distraught wife.  
  
“Hysterical bitch” he muttered under his breath. I retreated to my room to hide my sobs under the floral comforter Mother picked out, despite Father calling it “prissy”.  
  
At 13 years old, my Mother said I was an intelligent and talented boy. I played on my home computer and started learning basic coding skills. Mother let me outside at most twice a week and never for more than an hour. She said the air was dirty and violence could come from anywhere. At this age, I started to understand and share Mother's crippling fear of crowds and strangers. It was humiliating, but Mother had never removed the child locks on drawers and rubber corner guards from the corners.  
  
One night, I made a collage for a school project. It turned out that the pictures I used were very important to Father. When he found his treasured memories cut to pieces, he grabbed me by the arm, dragging me to the living room with an iron grip. I cried and apologized, more afraid of him than any monster on television. When Mother attempted to intervene, she failed, of course.  
  
“Let go of him!” she shouted. “You’re gonna hurt him!”  
  
“Exactly,” Father gruffly replied, “This shitty brat needs punishment. He just takes up space without ever getting any discipline.” Mother tried to scratch at Father until he threw her off of him, where she hit the ground hard, earning a few bruises for her trouble. Her delicate, thin frame could not withstand her husband's wrath, and she was knocked unconscious.  
  
I was not used to pain; the lashes on my behind were the first blemishes on my body but not the last. I bled. My wails didn’t stop for the whole long night. Father never gave me the courtesy of a lesson and explanation. I had no idea what set him off, and for my safety, I avoided him like the plague, refusing even eye contact, cowering in fear of the day he might snap again.  
  
At 16, I asked my Mother about my grandfather on her side. She reacted like a deer caught in the headlights. She sputtered briefly before replying, “He was a bad man, Michael. He died a long time ago... I will never let you become like him. You are my child; you will be better.” It began to make more sense, all of those old photobooks with some mysterious figure cut out of family shots.  
  
He must have hurt her like Father, I assumed. So why would she marry a man just like him, I wondered.  
  
Father had made an effort to be around the house as little as possible until vanishing altogether as he was escorted by the police to prison, resisting violently and predictably. The day prior, what started as a bar fight escalated into a homicide after Father's fist connected with another rowdy patron’s jaw. Unluckily for both of them, the patron's head hit a stool in just the right spot to make an assault into a murder.  
  
The cops dragged him, kicking and screaming, from the apartment. By the time he made it to the car, he was already pierced by the barbs of three Tasers. After this, Father was behind bars, for life, in fact. Twenty years with no trial, I prayed he would never escape a cold cell. Blame that on his shitty attitude on trial. Who’d have thought cussing out the judge wouldn’t help his case? Assaulting the bailiff may have been a poor decision as well.  
  
Mother refused to go to visitation. Fine by me. I didn’t miss him much, but I never did get the chance to get Father to see me. Not as a man, not as his child. Not once.  
  
I was 20 years old and finishing online school while working freelance in coding. I was now the sole provider of the household after our savings dried up. I was a sickly pale, scrawny joke, at least 40 pounds underweight.  My world was 600 square feet, the sky was a popcorn ceiling, and my social network was one trembling mousey woman named Mary, my Mother.  
  
Mother’s fear of the world had been deeply ingrained in me. My desire to live a real life was always tempered by the prospect of what was beyond the door. Chaos. A world of hate and danger, evil people who wanted to cause me pain.  
  
At the very least, Mother’s intense paranoia meant she came in for her yearly checkups. When the doctors found the growth of a sizable brain tumor, I was tossed off the edge of an infinite abyss.  
  
At twenty-seven, I was experiencing more of the world than ever as I took Mother to and from chemo treatments while talking with doctors, and it terrified me.  
  
The lights were too bright, the sounds were too loud, and there were people everywhere, so many people. My eyes were locked squarely on the ground in front of me. I continued to nurse her as her condition steadily deteriorated.  
  
Twenty-eight years, four months, thirteen days, and eleven hours, that was my age; the moment Mother left the world and me behind from that day to the end of time. I had been staying in the apartment and commuting to the hospital. I couldn’t bring myself to stay the nights at that place.  
  
I was not at Mother’s side when she breathed her last. I never knew her last words. The doctors told me she passed peacefully in her sleep. Their words didn’t reach my ears.  
  
I was 29 and huddled up in my dark apartment. Maybe out of grief, I began obsessing over finding some way to bring Mother back. Her death was so unacceptable it seemed rational by comparison that there was a supernatural solution. I dug through the deep web and old abandoned forums obsessively.  
  
I had spilled liters of my blood throughout this year of rituals. Seeing the dark red liquid flow from my body gave me a sense of calm. In many ceremonies, there was a tug I knew was connected to the land of the paranormal. This tug kept me going. It was fate admitting it had made a mistake.  
  
I had dug so deep on the internet that it felt like I would soon hit a permanent dead end. But, after one late night of digging through links to dead links, buried long ago and archived, I found what would be the fated summoning. It was a forum beginning with an image of a stone tablet with Arabic writing. The original poster had requested a translation of his tablet from this fringe linguistics community.  
  
He said he found this tablet buried in the sand on an excavation mission in the Middle East. He felt a strange draw to it and believed it chose him, so he hid his discovery from his team. After much debate in this forum, they settled on it being an ancient method for summoning a djinn. The creature was said to grant any wish for the appropriate price. The original poster claimed he was trying the ritual and was never seen again on the forum. None of the others had the stomach for this ritual, especially seeing as it demanded a part of one’s flesh.  
  
But I knew there was something different about this summoning. The threads of destiny were converging on my attempts at the rites. First, the ritual demanded a letter with the request written on it. Next, the letter must be sealed with the blood of the summoner; an offering must be wrapped in the letter. Finally, it is to be placed on the ground and burned.  
  
Just reading all of this, I felt supernatural energy in the room. I knew I was in danger, but my frantic mindset kept me from going back. I found myself paper and began to scrawl out my desire in the hope of salvation. The letter read,  
  
*Give her back to me. Wrench her from heaven if you must. Answer my call and save her. I offer my blood and body for your summons, come demon.*  
  
*Name your price.*  
  
I tried in vain to stifle my screams as a dull steak knife took from him the lobe of my right ear. Through tears, I cut a deep gash on my palm, a new addition to my ever-growing collection of scars, reminders of bloodrites and violent coping. The blood dripped onto the unceremonious graph paper that contained my plea and a vestige of my body. The spark from the Bic lighter engulfed the letter and its contents far too quickly. It disappeared into a blue fireball, vanishing before my wide eyes. The ignition sent me falling.  
  
I lay strewn on the ground. The fear of the blast made me lose my grip on my body. I pulled myself to my feet, whipping my head around the room in search of a sign of the ritual’s success.  
  
My body was shivering in the frightening cold that swept through my apartment. I was engulfed in pure silence; the tension was so thick my body could hardly withstand it.  
  
*Where is it?!*  I thought. Then, *Holy shit….. Did it work?*  
  
The lights were all off, and my senses felt useless.  
  
I got up to find the switch.  
  
My legs were jelly. I shook and collapsed every few feet.  
  
The room felt infinite; I was trapped not in a box but in a vast, lifeless expanse. My ears began ringing louder and louder; my heart was hammering.  
  
Something was coming, something very dangerous.  
  
I leaned against the wall that I managed to find after a veritable lifetime of crawling around.  
  
*It's going to kill me– I fucked up, didn’t I?*  
  
I called out into the darkness,  
  
“D-d-djinn! Where are you?! I called you to be of s-s- service to me!” My false bravado was a pathetic attempt to control the situation.  
  
What if  I just pissed it off? I thought confidence was the answer, but I’m such a pathetic worm; I’m fooling no one, much less a djinn.  
  
The seconds passed on, but they may have well been decades.  
  
*Was it a fluke? Did the djinn not fully cross over?*  
  
Finally, I heard something; a meandering whistling filled the void with its unsettling melody. Then, a chuckle. Through the impenetrable darkness, I heard it speak,  
  
“Hello…  Fragile human. Why are you so afraid? I won’t bite.” it continued chuckling, “I wouldn’t kill you when you have so much to give me.” the djinn's voice lowered menacingly, “Although, all toys break eventually, don't they?” the being spoke slowly and softly  
  
“I read your letter… What a shame it was to lose her, but your hope and pain were a delight to feast on.” The demon added, a hunger clear in its voice. “You… a husk of a human as you are, have piqued my interest. I want more… I want to see you suffer,” the djinn’s voice lowered to a growl, “I want to see what it takes… to break you.” Some words came off as masculine, some feminine; this creature was beyond human standards. Its sinister tone shook me to my core.  
  
Two glowing eyes like high beams opened a few yards from me, or maybe a few miles away, and light flooded back into the room.  
  
It had simple but alluring androgynous features with black hair down to the ground. It was very tall and thin and wore a white three-piece suit. Its eyes were too bright for a human; they shined like the bulb of an angler fish. Its grin was too long; it seemed to stretch wider and wider endlessly, and its teeth were far too sharp.  
  
I hadn’t known what to expect, but the demon’s aura was oppressive beyond belief. The pressure made me vomit. It slowly walked closer to me, the infinite distance shrinking. It put itself just a few feet away from me and stared me down. I couldn’t break away.  
  
“P-p-please stop…” I squeaked out.  
  
“No, Michael… We are just getting started.” Its mouth opened, unhinged. It was going to devour me; its breath was hot and wet. It drew closer. I knew that my head would fit snugly in its maw before being ripped off my neck. Instead of ending my short, miserable life, it yawned and then snickered to itself. Its long, pale fingers caressed the bloody stump that was once my ear.  
  
“Explain to me, Michael, truthfully, what you want…  And I will tell you what I will take from you.” The djinn whispered to me, its mouth a few inches from the remains of my right ear. Fate had led me to my undoing. The tangled threads of destiny had tied me and dragged me towards the horror of what lay below the bottom. I see it now: this day was the last I would spend as a whole person. It was the first day of the agonizing end of the life I once had.  
  
The djinn backed away from me, twirling on its heel before finding a seat on my tattered sofa.  
  
“What? Not going to ask if I want a drink.” Its tone had lightened. It was still amused, which I figured was best for my safety, so I kept it that way. What was this being? It left me terrified of its volatility.  
  
The djinn started to look dissatisfied, putting me further on edge. It addressed me a little louder than the first time.  
  
“Well?… I don’t tolerate being made to wait for long….” It wanted me to play its game. To squirm and bend to its whims. Knowing this was pointless, I haven’t stood up for myself against anyone, much less an ancient demon.  
  
“I’m s-s-so sorry… Do you have a name? Would you prefer djinn?” I tested the waters with our conversation, trying to suss out the djinn’s preferred way of being treated.  
  
The djinn seemed to reflect on my question for but a moment,  
  
“It matters not,” it replied, “I’ve been called by many names. It’s all human nonsense.” It quickly lost interest in that discussion and moved back on topic. “Michael… I hate wasting time.” It leaned forward, and its demeanor darkened. “You will tell me your desire. Be specific… or don’t. I love playing a game of monkey’s paw.” Yes, I was terrified of the creature, but at the same time, I was elated that I found the right one. I had direction; there was a way to get her back!  
  
“Michael… put the tea on… now.” My lack of hospitality was becoming offensive; I was scared shitless; what could it expect? I darted out of the room and started boiling some water in my kettle.  
  
The djinn was in a better mood, appreciating my skittish attitude and hesitation. “Tell me about your mother… Michael.” Another joke, it almost pissed me off that it was so happy to toy with my mind. I could only hope that the djinn wouldn’t be bothered by the lack of a reaction. I mustered up the courage to speak my piece before the creature.  
  
“She was the m-most important person in my life.” My voice was quiet, and I stuttered; Father would have been deeply disappointed with my weakness. “My only friend, my only family. Without her, I don’t know how to live. The world is too loud, too big; it's hell out there; I’m safe in here… but the loneliness is starting to screw with me. I’m losing my fucking mind.”  
  
The djinn leaned further forward attentively, but to me, it looked like it was getting in position to pounce on me and… eat me? Take my soul? I had no idea what I was dealing with.  
  
The legends had no consistency. The mounting horror of making one wrong step was in the front of my mind, and my request was further back. It took my everything to even finish; all of the misery I was put through came crashing back. “She was gentle and protective and never gave up on me-” the kettle whistled loudly.  
  
“The tea is ready. Are you going to keep prattling on, or will you make me a cup?” The djinn interrupted.  
  
“Yes, I-I’m so sorry, one moment.” It was toying with me, and I couldn’t say anything about it. I brought the tea back to the djinn; it stood and closed our distance, fixing me with its glowing eyes as I entered the room.  
  
“Put the tea down over there.” It gestured to an end table. “I’ve become bored with your backstory…” It paused, likely for dramatic effect, “I can create a divergence in reality, as real as this one… just for you, where your mother will be alive and healthy. Is that what you desire?… Yes or no.”  
  
The djinn drummed his fingers. *Ahh, it never cared about the tea, did it?* I couldn’t help but think. What a waste of my last bag of Earl Gray.  
  
“What does that mean? How would–” My chest tightened as it put a sharp finger to my throat.  
  
“Yes or no, Michael. What about that, did you not understand?” It snarled.  
  
“Please don’t! I’m sorry! Please! Y-Yes, that’s exactly what I want!” I quickly replied. Once again, the twinge of hope returned, a twig on its tiny fire. This fucked up mistake of Mother dying; I could make it right!  
  
“There will be a cost… One most steep… How about your life, hmm? Are you willing to die for your precious mother?” The djinn’s nasty grin was widening. “You love her, don’t you? You owe her everything, don’t you?” Its face drew closer to mine. “Well?” I seized up on the spot. At that moment,  
  
I realized the depths of my cowardice. No matter how awful life was, no matter how much I suffered, I was too afraid to die. If I sacrificed my life to save Mother’s, I wouldn't even be around to be by her side. So what would be the point? When I die, it all dies with me. I was selfish. I disgusted myself. But nothing was more important than my life.  
  
Nothing is worth braving about the horrors of hell or the long quiet of infinite darkness after my consciousness slipped away. I can’t give my life, even for her. Mother would have understood; she always put me first. I couldn’t live without her, so she shouldn’t be able to live without me. It’s only fair… Right?  
  
“I can’t give my life… anything but that.” I turned away while softly admitting this. My tears began to well, and as much as I tried, the brave face I had never even successfully put on vanished. I couldn’t bring myself to look into its glowing pale yellow eyes. It stood high over me with that awful grin plastered to its face.  
  
It snickered derisively like it saw my answer from a mile away. It chuckled before bending to my level. The djinn cleared its throat and spoke with a perfect replication of Father’s voice, “Well… aren’t you a sorry excuse for a son… and for a man.” It finished while its long frame stood looking down at me. I recoiled in fear at the reminder of the person who hurt me most throughout my life. Just the slightest reminder left me clutching my chest and gasping for air. How does it know that voice?! It looked down at me like I was its plaything.  
  
The djinn spoke again, now sounding exactly like Mother, “You would let me die? Right? My son would never abandon me, right? Not after all that I’ve done for you…” My tears flowed; I was shattered. I sat on the floor with my head in my hands.  
  
The djinn placed one finger on my forehead, “Well… if you don't give your life, you will have to give me something far more tantalizing… Your mind.” The djinn spoke again slowly and returned to its normal voice. Centering myself, I tried to get back to my feet. It was the first time I was grateful for the experience of thousands of panic attacks.  
  
“What do you mean, my mind?” I responded, confused and concerned. One look at the djinn’s smirk told me that he was waiting for this smooth transition.  
  
“Well, Michael, I have grown old… I have seen thousands of humans live and die, but I feel as though my curiosity has yet to be satiated. I enjoy humans; they’re full of endless possibilities.” The djinn glided into the middle of the room; its arms spread wide like a seasoned ringmaster. Its theatrics were haunting; the way it moved was inhuman, with no mistakes, no wasted movements.  
  
“As I don’t have one myself, save for my jars on a shelf in the office, I know too little about the human mind… I want to take it, stretch it, and mold it. I want to pull the threads of sanity to the absolute limit….” The djinn had a wistful look about it.  
  
“My past subjects snapped. They are now useless carcasses, filling hospital spaces, their catatonic bodies being spoon-fed slop. You, Michael, have something different.” It held out its hand. “Join me in a little experiment. That is all I ask….” I flinched as his hand drew closer to me.  
  
“What do you mean different?... And what kind of experiment?” I cautiously asked, staring at the floor. I couldn’t take the weight of those blinding eyes any longer.  
  
“Firstly, how should I put it? You’re… the perfect type of pathetic. Second, it’s quite simple, really; I want to test your mental fortitude to find the human limit. I want to isolate you, Michael. Isolate you so completely that this world will be a distant dream. You will remain in your solitude for what will feel like 100 years. Not a second will have passed out here.”  
  
The djinn’s pace picked up with excitement at the prospect of my situation. “If you give up before the time is up, you will never see your mother again, and, of course, you will pay for wasting my time. Maybe I’ll take an arm or two, maybe your life if I’m in the mood.” Its hand beckoned out to my own,  
  
“Do we have a deal…” It never dropped that nightmarish smile.  
  
I frantically called out, “Ww-wait! I have so many questions! Will I-”  
  
“No more questions, Michael. I will not physically harm you; all you have to do is stay in the space I create for you. I will not sabotage you; the whole purpose of this is to gain knowledge. I would not ruin that.” The djinn was becoming impatient once again. “This is your last chance to back out, with consequences, of course… But you wouldn’t do that, Michael. Shake. My. hand.”  
  
I was staring down the barrel of a loaded gun. The hand in front of me held promises of some unknowable thing. Was it salvation? Damnation? Maybe something outside of labels? All I could do was go along with anything that came at me.  
  
At that moment, after he finished his pitch, I came to an epiphany. If I took the djinn’s deal, if I tried and succeeded, I would have my life back. If I tried and failed, I would probably lose my life, only earlier.  If I had never tried, I would have lived out my miserable existence until I begged for death, too scared to take my own life. The consequence of not trying was just as bad as that of trying and failing. I had nothing to lose.  
  
Wishful thinking.  
  
The djinn’s massive hand swallowed up my own as we shook on the deal.  
  
It sent me off with ironic words of encouragement, “Well, Michael, welcome to a century of nothingness. I cannot wait to see your human brain erode and crack. Good luck; you might find solitude to be a friend. You may also find it a torturous burden. No man is an island, etcetera. See you in 100 years.” The djinn's eyes brilliantly glowed until all I could see was yellow light. After that, I blacked out, having taken my final look at a world of substance.  
  
My body felt like it was falling for hours. When I came to, I was in a perfectly and flawlessly white space. The dimension warped and changed as I looked around. This space was disturbing, and it played with my head, making me confused and tense. The djinn had dressed in some kind of simple, loose clothing that I could not pry off despite my every effort. The floor had no friction whatsoever—my every attempt to get up led to my falling, not that I could feel the impact.  
  
There was no bed, no bathroom, and nothing in the room besides the flawless walls, floor, and ceiling, except for a single object on a simple shelf out of reach. An hourglass the size of my body trickled sand at a snail's pace, what must have been one grain a minute. I scooted across the floor until I was up against the smooth, slick walls. The first day of my new life began.  
  
**Day One**  
  
I spent most of the day acclimating to my new environment; everything threw me off. There was no smell, nothing. There was no sound whatsoever. There were no shadows. There was no temperature; that one is the hardest to explain, but I felt no hot or cold, just a temperature that didn’t register with my brain. My mind sent warning signals that this state was wrong and that the world was missing so much. I had an initial panic about the feeling of being so wholly trapped, but this isolation wasn’t new to me.  
  
I lived almost my entire life in a few hundred square feet and didn’t want it any other way. I was built for isolation. I had been training for this my entire life. As it turned out, this isolation was different. I was used to a computer; then, I had no entertainment. I was used to the food, but I didn’t feel hungry in the room.  I was used to bodily needs, but then I had none. I was alone with my mind and was starting to feel the burden.  
  
*What if the djinn was lying?* I thought, *What if I never make it out of here?* I was frantic; *what if I’m dead? What if meeting the djinn was a dream?* My mind raced, finding more and more disastrous outcomes. I*’m not going to make it! But if I quit, who knows what it will do to me?* I sat against the wall. I may not have felt my heartbeat, but my mind was scrambling. It had been but one day and the cracks were already showing.  
  
The hourglass was no help; it only held a few grains of sand so far, and I couldn’t track time. I was lost; the century ahead of me was a death sentence. I cried without tears.  
  
*I should have just waited to die a lonely death,* I thought, defeated. *If I’ve been pushed this far in one day, I will be a shattered tragedy after the time is up.*  
  
Whenever I tried to quit, I saw the djinn's teeth ripping me apart and my mother's corpse rotting under the ground. Even though I needed Mother more than anything, I was in over my head. I wouldn’t be able to form a coherent thought by the end of my imprisonment.  
  
**Day 30?**  
  
What was I at, two million? I had been counting since the first day without stopping for a second. The numbers in my head kept the flood of thoughts and fears at bay. Then, the numbers stopped coming to me; they couldn’t quiet the screaming in my mind. I heard voices—echoes of the past and warnings for the future. The voices staged an intervention.  
  
“Michael, you can give up!” my eight-year-old self told me. “This is a mistake; Mother wouldn't have wanted this! We can’t handle this!”  
  
My older self berated me for my stupidity. “You made your bed, you moron. Now lie in it. That thing out there is probably gonna kill or maim you the second you quit.” He told me. “There’s nothing you can do. You’ll go insane in here. What’s the point of living anyway? Once your mind’s gone…”  
  
I heard my Mother telling me to give up for my safety, “Michael, please!” she cried, “I want you to be happy, without or without me.” Tears streamed down her face. “I love you, Michael… even if you would abandon me.” Those last words cut me up.  
  
Father told me to grow up, “You’re a pussy. You don’t have it in you. You’re only doing this for your self-satisfaction. Be a man; don’t give up, even if it kills you!” Father shouted. “For once in your life, see something through to the end! Who gives a shit if you make it out in one piece!” Father’s voice drowned out every last thought.  
  
No matter how much I bit, my fingernails wouldn’t tear off, so I rocked myself back and forth while biting at my hands and arms. It made me so guilty and so small.  
  
There was nothing to have or do or make that could save me. All I had were my thoughts. There had to be a way to take me away from this lonely hell. On the very edge of insanity, I made a decision. If I were trapped away from the real world, I would make my own.  
  
The world outside was cruel; I thought I could do better. My cracking mind was ready to believe anything I put it to. The delusions could work in my favor. I had nothing to occupy me and all the time in the world.  
  
Mental construction began work on my new cozy town, one where everybody loved me—**a place where everybody knows my name.**
