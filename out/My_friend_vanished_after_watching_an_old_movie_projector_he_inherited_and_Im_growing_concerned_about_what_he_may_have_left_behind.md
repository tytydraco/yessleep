My friend has been missing for almost a month now. He’d been living with his parents, feeling stuck and frustrated ever since his grandfather passed away. When he inherited an old film projector from him, he thought it might somehow help him break through his writer’s block.

The last time we talked, he told me he was going to finally try it out and watch whatever was on those old reels. Apparently, he fell asleep watching one of the movies, but when he woke up… Well, according to his notes, he didn’t wake up in his room. He woke up in some kind of labyrinth.

His parents found his notebook under his bed after he disappeared. I’ve started typing it up, but it’s long, and I’m still going through it. For now, I’m posting the first part, hoping someone might have some idea of what’s going on—or maybe where he could have gone. I’ll post the rest as I go through it.

If anyone has seen anything like this before, please, let me know:

"It’s been over a year since I wrote my last short story. My heart just hasn’t been in it. I’m not sure what to write. I guess I’ll start by explaining what and why I’m writing. I’m an aspiring fiction author, but I’ve struggled with writing for a long time. Mostly because I’ve been depressed for years. I feel like I have a ton of good ideas, but it hurts to think. I love my imagination, but it’s an increasingly painful place these days. It’s so bad that I’ve been too afraid to try to do anything creative. I’ve mostly been trying to avoid my thoughts because I don’t want to think about how my life got this way. But I can’t stand just sitting around getting more depressed. I need to do something to at least try to fix my life. 



Recently, I decided to write this diary just to get myself writing something again. Maybe if I just try to write whatever comes to mind, it could turn into a story. As I said, my thoughts have been painful and scary lately, but horror is one of my favorite genres. Maybe I could get inspired to write something horrific. And I’m struggling to write even this. I’m just so indecisive about every word. I hate how very long it takes me to wake up sometimes. Over two days, I only wrote a little over a paragraph. This is the only practice that will get me back into writing anything again. But it’s okay if I just keep at this. I’m sure I can get used to it again. It’s just so annoying how groggy and lethargic I can feel sometimes. I’ll try writing while watching something instead of listening to music for a bit. The music can sometimes feel like noise if I’m not in the right mood and I’m forcing myself to write. That was a dumb idea, but watching something is too distracting. I’ll just listen to fantasy music.



I haven’t written anything in so long because I was pretty depressed after getting kicked out of the friend group I had for over two years. It’s a long story that I don’t want to overthink about right now. I’ll just say that it sent me back into my old ways of being a depressed, lethargic shut-in who hardly gets any exercise or sun. I tried therapy, and I gave up on that. It’s another long story I might get into later. It’s well after midnight, and I’m pretty tired, so I guess I’ll stop here. I know I haven’t written much yet, but I started pretty late. Besides, I want to try to improve my sleeping habits. I would like to wake up before noon instead of well after for once. It’s so hard to get good sleep when you’re depressed. 



















My parents and aunts finally stopped fighting over the inheritance from my grandparents and settled on who gets what recently. It took years for everything to be settled in court finally. According to my parents, my aunt did some stuff to give herself control over my grandparents’ finances shortly before they died. I don’t know, and I don’t know if I care. I loved my grandparents, but I don’t like sticking my nose in or thinking about my family’s drama. It’s nice to have some extra money, my grandfather left me a few things. They just arrived in the mail today. Most of it is computer stuff. I got my love of tech from my grandpa. He taught me how to use them when I was really little. I remember visiting my grandparents and playing Nickelodeon and Cartoonnetwork games on his computer as a kid. It was a while before I had a computer at home. And even longer before we had internet faster than dial-up. 



As nice as the computer stuff is, it’s not the most exciting thing my grandfather left me. I also got this old projector. It doesn’t have any branding or labels on it, but it looks really nice and in good condition. Maybe my grandpa made it himself. His tech interests and knowledge were always far beyond mine. I was only ever interested in PCs, and He liked to fix anything and everything. Still, I wonder why he left me a projector. I was never really interested in this kind of stuff. One summer, my friends and I wanted to make a movie, and that’s maybe why. But I was always way more interested in writing and making video games. Because of that, my tech interests and knowledge have always been mainly focused on the software side. 



This projector looks like it's from another era. The design is elegant yet mysterious, with intricate engravings along its metal casing that seem to tell their own story. I can't shake the feeling that there's something more to this projector, something beyond its physical appearance. Perhaps there's a reason my grandfather left it specifically to me, a reason that goes beyond nostalgia or a passing interest in filmmaking. I don’t know why I didn’t notice before, but it’s bizarrely cold, almost like dry ice. I’m going to try it out in my large walk-in closet. The walls in there are bright white and plenty large. Plus, it’s more than dark enough for the projections to show up clearly. Also, the bulb outlet has a power socket. 



I’m continuing this on my phone in my closet. I locked my bedroom door so my parents don’t bother me while I watch this. I'm shocked this old projector still works perfectly; it emits an eerie, whirring hum as it powers on. Luckily, it came with a large film reel already loaded. I’m not surprised this thing is so slow. I guess this projector hasn’t been tested in a while because it’s kicking up a lot of dust. The hum of the projector is growing a little louder, filling this small space with a strange, low mechanical rhythm. The light from the projector is flickering to life on the wall in front of me, revealing a black-and-white scene reminiscent of early silent films. The image is blurry, grainy, foggy, and distorted as if it's been warped by time itself.



It's hard to discern what exactly is being shown. Shapes and shadows dance across the surface, forming abstract patterns that seem to shift and morph with each passing moment. The scene is slowly beginning to coalesce into a semblance of coherence, like memories emerging from a fog. The images are muted and washed out as if drained of life. The setting appears to be abandoned, and It’s an empty, featureless dessert. A barren expanse is stretching out before me, devoid of any signs of habitation or vegetation. The sky above is a dull, featureless gray, casting a pall of gloom over the scene. Despite the lack of any discernible movement, I can't shake the feeling of being watched. It's as if unseen eyes are peering out from the darkness, observing my every move with a sense of malevolent curiosity.



As I continue to watch, the scene on the wall begins to undulate subtly, like the surface of a still pond disturbed by a single drop. The barren desert landscape starts to darken at the edges, the shadows deepening and growing as if the night is rushing in at an unnatural pace. The horizon line is beginning to appear cracked and uneven and separate the barren plains from a sky choked with churning, unnatural fog. An inky blackness is bleeding down from the clouds, slowly but steadily consuming the empty landscape. The whole scene is flooding with a strange, viscous substance. It's as if the very essence of the film is seeping through the projector, defying the laws of reality. The thick, murky liquid is creeping slowly across the landscape, swallowing everything in its path. It moves with an eerie deliberateness, oozing into every crevice and corner, consuming the world before my eyes.



The viscous darkness now pools in the center of the barren vista, swirling and churning as if alive. From this inky well, a grotesque and misshapen head is slowly rising from the ground. Its features are vague and indistinct, like a half-remembered nightmare. It seems impossibly large, and its silhouette dwarfs the horizon. Hollow eyes stare out of it into the abyss, devoid of any emotion or life. It has a single, elongated nostril that hangs flaccid. The head makes no sound as its gaping maw yawns open, revealing row upon row of jagged teeth. All the liquid is somehow draining out of its mouth and drying most of the land.



A shape is emerging from the depths of the churning, black ocean, or perhaps it's a boat - the distinction is blurred in the murky depths of the film. It's a silhouette shrouded in darkness, and its contours are barely discernible against the inky blackness of the water. It’s slowly inching its way towards the shore. As it draws closer, details start to emerge from the gloom. A lone, skeletal rowboat bobs precariously in the churning waves. Suddenly, a long, spindly arm reaches out from the water, grasping the edge of the boat. The figure is pulling itself up onto the rocking ship, and each movement is deliberate and foreboding.



 It seems impossibly tall and thin, its limbs extremely long and twisted, like the branches of a gnarled tree reaching out to ensnare unwitting prey. Its head hangs at an unnatural angle. And its eyes... if they can be called eyes, gleam with an otherworldly light. They’re piercing through the darkness with an intensity that sends shivers down my spine. The water around the ship is starting to bubble and froth. The figure is crying out a mournful sound that cuts through the rhythmic groan of the projector like a knife. It’s somehow human and inhuman at the same time. For all my growing sense of unease, I’m unable to tear my gaze away from the unfolding spectacle. It’s now standing on the boat, and It seems to be searching for something. Its pale, hollow orbs are scanning the barren horizon. It lets out another mournful cry, this one tinged with desperation.



The camera just panned over to the forest. A monstrous, undulating creature is emerging from the depths of the forest. The grainy film struggles to capture its details. However, I can just barely make out its immense, barnacle-encrusted limbs and a hide that ripples like a vast sea. It's a creature so large it defies comprehension, dwarfing the mountains in the distance and casting an oppressive shadow that seems to stretch for miles.  It moves with an unnatural grace, and its form is shifting and undulating like a specter summoned from the darkest depths of the human psyche. Its body is a patchwork of mismatched limbs and grotesque appendages, each one moving in perfect synchrony with the others. As it draws nearer, I can make out the details of its… well, what I guess is its face. Its eyes are empty voids, sucking in the light around them like black holes in the fabric of reality. Its mouth stretches impossibly wide, revealing row upon row of jagged teeth that glint malevolently in the dim light.



The camera shifted focus again, and it settled on the most disturbing sight yet. In the center stands a colossal tree, unlike anything on Earth. It stretches endlessly upwards, disappearing into the swirling gray above. The sheer size of it is overwhelming, dwarfing the mountains on the horizon and casting a sickly green pall over the landscape. But it's not just the size that’s chilling. The tree's roots are sprawling like the tentacles of some ancient leviathan. Its trunk is impossibly bulbous, its surface mottled and wrinkled like ancient, sunbaked flesh. The bark is gnarled and weeping sap that glows faintly, pulsating with a rhythm that mimics a heartbeat. Its branches are thick and sinuous and writhe and twist like enormous, petrified serpents. They seem to pulse with a slow, rhythmic life, their surfaces glistening with a sickly luminescence that seems to emanate from within the bark itself. Nestled amongst the branches, colossal, fleshy fruit dangle precariously, their surfaces pulsating with a rhythmic, almost hypnotic glow. They resemble giant, misshapen eyes, staring down at the desolate plain below with a cold, unblinking gaze.



But the most unsettling aspect is the single, immense eye embedded deep within the trunk itself. It's a pulsating orb of raw, chaotic energy, the iris a swirling vortex of shifting colors. It stares out from the tree with a chilling intelligence. I can't help but feel it looking directly at me, judging, scrutinizing. This tree, this grotesque parody of nature, feels ancient beyond imagining, powerful beyond comprehension. It is a monument to some dark, unknown force, and I have a feeling I've stumbled upon something I was never meant to see. This tree, this entity, is the epicenter of the film's universe, a god-like presence that exudes an aura of primordial power. It's as if the tree has always been there, watching, waiting, a silent observer to the passage of eons. The figure from the boat, now on land, approaches the tree with a slow, reverent gait. Its form is dwarfed by the sheer size of the tree, yet there is a connection, an unspoken understanding between them. The figure reaches out a hand, and the tree responds, a single massive limb lowering to touch the figure's outstretched fingers.



The landscape is starting to warp and twist, contorting into bizarre and unnatural shapes. The once primarily empty expanse is now filled with strange, otherworldly structures. Now, I see an overgrown garden with gnarled trees reaching out like skeletal fingers clawing at the sky. They’re casting twisted shadows across the ground. Strange, barely discernible shapes are popping in and out of view. Grotesque humanoid forms with unsettling proportions are writhing and wriggling across the screen. Their movements are jagged and erratic, as if they are not entirely tethered to the laws of physics. Their faces are shrouded and obscured by masks of blank, dark expression. I can make out the silhouette of a looming structure, its jagged spires piercing the heavens. As the minutes pass, the imagery is becoming increasingly surreal and disorienting. Shapes morph and twist in impossible ways, defying logic and reason. In spite of the unsettling nature of the footage, there is a certain monotony to it. The abstract patterns have become hypnotic, and It’s starting to make my eyelids feel heavy. Between that and the rhythmic whirring of the projector's mechanics, I just might fall asleep in my chair right here.



What happened? Where am I? I don’t feel like I was asleep for very long. This doesn’t look anything like my closet. I just woke up, and I’m in a little white room. There’s nothing in here except me, a small desk, a chair, a notebook, and a pen. The scariest thing is there is no door or window. I don’t know how I ended up here or why. But I’m guessing whoever put me in here wants me to write my thoughts in this notebook. Well, I'm less guessing and more hoping that writing this will make them happy and let me out. I don’t know what else I can do right now, but I can’t think of what to write, and I’m still exhausted. And the fact that everything in this room is the same shade of white is strangely maddening. Especially with the only light source here being one overbearing, almost blinding bright white fluorescent light. I think I’ll just try to take a nap. Maybe this is just a nightmare, and I’ll wake up in my room.



Fuck, damn it, I’m still stuck in here. And I think that the light is getting worse. It’s almost impossible to see anything. It’s almost like the light is washing away all the shadows and contrasting light. It’s very disorienting. It’s like being lost in a blank, white, empty void. I tried breaking through the walls. I even tried hitting them with the chair. But it didn’t do any good, and I just wore myself out. I have to find some way out. That was weird. I had to rewrite that last sentence because I accidentally wrote it on the desk. At least, I think I did. Wait, where’s the desk? I can’t tell where the desk is.



I keep trying to feel around for it in the all-consuming light. But it’s almost like it just keeps shifting virtually as though it was liquid. Yet it feels rock solid and bone dry. It’s a very confusing feeling I’ve never experienced before. I’ve had trouble feeling around for things in the dark before. But nothing has ever run from me like this. Damn, this is frustrating. What the hell? I slammed my fists down on the desk, and for a moment, I could tell where it was. However, as soon as I moved my hands, it shifted again. I can hardly believe it, but I think concentration makes it stay. Ok, this has to be a dream because it’s working. I don’t know if I’m awake, I feel very awake, but I don’t care. I just want out. I have an idea. Wow, that worked. I drew a circle on the wall and forced my hand through. So I guess if I draw a door, maybe I can use it to escape. It’s worth a shot.



It was all I could do to scratch a crude rectangle across the wall, but I managed to make it through. I thought, but where am I now? I can’t see anything; it's just pure bright white everywhere. Why can’t I stand up? Am I falling? I think I am. How did it take me so long to notice that I was falling? It’s like I wasn’t falling before I saw, or guessed it? But I didn't even feel like I was floating. I didn’t feel like anything like I was barely even existing. I’ve been falling for a while. What’s going to happen? Am I stuck falling forever, or am I going to land? I don’t know which I’m more afraid of. I’ve had way more than my fair share of suicidal thoughts, and I’ve even attempted it a couple of times. But I’m a coward who’s terrified of death. I don’t want my life to end now, especially not like this. And not here all alone. I'm so sorry…



What? Am I ok? Am I alive? How did... Where am I? The floor is so soft and cold. It's almost like it's not even there. But I feel like I'm on solid ground. That is solid enough, anyway. This room is just as blindingly white as the last one. Well, at least this one is a lot bigger and has several doors. I might find an exit around here. This place is like an office building, except it's far more cold, sterile, and pure white. Every step I take here seems to be getting me more lost. How long have I been searching for an exit? This place is almost like an empty dream. I tried calling out for help, but I couldn't. No matter how hard I yell, I can’t hear myself. I don’t think there’s anything wrong with me. I tried clapping, kicking the wall, and stomping the ground. But I heard nothing but a cold void of silence. This place is like a box that’s hostile to any sign of life. It’s oppressively sterile and trim as much as it is hopelessly endless. I don’t even have any breath in here…



How long have I been trapped here, searching for an exit in this stark white maze? I can’t remember if I checked three hundred rooms or just three. I think this place is doing something to my brain. I can feel my mind slowly fading and getting fuzzy. I’m starting to struggle to think and concentrate. What’s going on? Where am I? This place seems to be making me numb inside and out. I can feel my mind draining. What’s wrong with me? Why can’t I think? Why is my mind so blank now? Where was I? I lost my train of thought. I need to concentrate. I just need to find the exit…



Every wasted moment that passes without anything accomplished burns. Time just seems to pass faster and faster and pull me closer and closer to death. The blank emptiness is strangling and suffocating my mind more and more. I’m lost in a self-perpetuating cycle because the longer I’m trapped, the more I can feel myself being crippled by this place. And the weaker I get, the faster this place breaks me. I’m just getting so tired now I don’t know how much longer I can push on or even move. And the scariest part is everything I don't know. I don't know why I'm here or how I get out. I don't know what will happen when this place drains me, and I inevitably collapse…



As tired as I am and as soft as the floor is, I wish I could just take a nap. But I can't, and I need to leave as soon as possible. I'm too afraid of what could happen if I stop moving. So, no matter how much every waking moment burns, I need to keep moving. I don’t think I’d be capable of sleeping anyway. My mind isn’t able to relax enough for that, and it's not even close. I just need to give up on the thought of peace or relaxation until I get the fuck out of here. I just need to concentrate on finding the exit. If I just hurry up and move faster, I can get out of here before it’s too late. I can feel my body slowly starting to freeze up. I have to fight against my mind and body a little more with every step. The more I fight, the more it hurts, but I can’t give up. I need to get out...



I just need to focus hard, harder than I ever have. If I just push on with every bit of strength I have left, I know I can get out of here. It really hurts, but I have to, and I just need to use the pain to drive me, to fuel the fire in my belly. Yes, that’s it. I can feel myself moving faster and more easily. The harder I focus, the less I hurt. It’s like ice is melting off me. I think I see a door in the distance that doesn’t look like every other damn door in here. It doesn't look like an exit, and it barely looks any different. But it must be the exit, and it’s the only door that doesn’t seem exactly like the rest. I can’t think why else it would seem as unique as it does.



Damn it, What’s wrong with that door? What’s wrong with me? I can hardly describe it. I want to open it, and I have to open it. It’s my only hope of escaping this nightmare. Yet, something is holding me back. I don’t know why, but I’m terrified of this door. The closer I get, the more I freeze up from fear and struggle to even think about opening it.  When I get close enough almost to touch the handle, I freeze like a statue. No, I’m so close, I can’t be stuck here like this now… 



I have no idea how long I’ve been just standing here staring at that door, but I know I need to get out of here now. I also know that if anything is going to help me escape, it’s probably that door. I mean, it’s at least different. It’s the only thing that is. I just need to relax and open that door. I know what I have to do, and I know I need to do it now! Yet I can’t do it, no matter how simple it is. I just can’t make my body do it. I don’t even have a clue why I’m afraid. I have a few vague and unlikely guesses. It could be fear of the unknown or something like that, but that has never been the case for me. I’ve always loved to explore. Well, at least I was. I have been a hermit for the past handful of years. But that’s not due to fear. Besides, I have no idea why or how I could have become afraid of the unknown or anything like that. At least, I am not this afraid or even close to it. 



Maybe part of me somehow knows what’s on the other side of that door. But I don’t see how that could be possible. I’m just thinking about and dwelling on this too much. It’s a simple task, and I just need to rip it off like a bandaid. That’s my problem. I think about stuff like this too much. I just have to calm the fuck down, and it. I just need to stop being such a god damn coward. But why am I such a loser coward? No, no, no, that’s just it. I need to stop getting stuck in an endless loop of thinking about it. I just need to charge at the door and do it before I even realize what’s happening. This is ridiculous and dumb, and I’m just going to do it already. All this thinking is going to trap me here forever. Ok, now or never, here it goes…



 Well, I made it through, thank fuck that worked. I had to almost black out and just mindlessly ram myself through, but I did it. But I’m not so sure this is the way out anymore. There’s no way in hell I’m going back, though. This place is pretty different from the rest of this labyrinth. I guess that’s a good thing. I don’t know, and I don’t feel so much like I’m being drained or like I’m dying. But this place is a lot more foreboding, and It's darker, greyer, and duller. I’m sure why this place feels so much more unsettling to me than the previous section. I’ve always loved the dark. It usually makes me feel calm and confident. Wait, what’s that in the corner? 



It’s just a shadow, but it almost looks like it has a thin, spindly hand coming out of it. It is pretty hard to see here; it’s probably just a trick of the light or something. I guess I’ll just try to ignore it and keep looking for the exit. The more I explore this place, the more uneasy I feel. I feel like this place is messing with my head, but not as harshly as the white section, at least not yet. I’m starting to feel like I’m being hunted. Almost everywhere I look, there are strange shadows. I know I need to look around everywhere and behind every door if I want to find the exit, but it’s so difficult here. Well, I just can’t think of anything better, to be honest. But thinking about checking what’s behind any of these doors makes me nervous. I’m struggling to keep myself from running back to the first area despite how miserable that was.



At least I don’t feel my mind fading or my body aching anymore. Now I can think. It’s just somewhat difficult to think. It’s weird because it doesn’t feel like a headache. Thinking just makes me feel tired and a bit disoriented. Like getting the wind knocked out of me. Is something here with me? I feel like every corner and intersection of this place is watching me. I should just stay focused on getting out of here fast. If there is something in here, escaping is probably the only thing I can do about it, so I had better get to it. So this is it, the first door…

 

Am I outside? I think I made it out. I must have. I’m at the local park. I don’t know what happened to the door I came out of, but I don’t care. I’m just happy to be out of there finally. I’ve never felt this happy, not since I was a kid anyway. After all that, I need to sit and relax for just a moment. That bench looks good. I remember playing with other kids in this park when I was tiny, about three or probably 4. Man, those were some of the happiest memories I’ve ever made. It’s such a lovely night, and the full moon is beautiful. I forgot how nice this park is, but it doesn't seem to have changed a bit since I was a kid. My eyes are getting so heavy, and I better get going soon before I fall asleep.



What happened? I must have nodded off, and I guess I was even more tired than I realized. Wait!?! Did the bench grow while I was asleep!?! FUCK! That wasn’t the exit, was it? I’m still stuck in that hell, aren’t I? Assuming I’m right, how the fuck do I get out of this nightmare? What’s that? Is this a frisbee? It looks exactly like one of the frisbees my friends and I would throw around when we were little. It has the same cheap, plasticy, almost rubbery look and the same bright, vibrant, warm, candy-like color. “Hey, buddy! Wanna play some frisbee?"  It's been a really long time, but I remember that voice. Yep, that's Caleb and the rest of my friends from when I was a toddler, just as I remember them smiling brightly with pure joy in their eyes. I can hardly believe it. Is this some kind of dream?



We had so much fun, and we raced all over the place on our tricycles. We played a lot of games like catch, tag, hide and seek. We even saw and collected fireflies in jars. We had the time of our lives for what felt like several hours, but it must have been well over a day because I remember two nights passing. I know I should be trying to find my way home, but I don’t want to think about that right now. Sophie just told me about a cool place my friends want to explore with me. It sounds so cool, and it’s like some sort of empty factory with a bunch of bizarre machines. 



I can’t resist the offer. It's been so long since I’ve been on an adventure like that, especially with friends. It looks like they’re ready, and it's time to get going.  My life has felt so empty and frozen for so long, and I need this. My friends and I did a lot of exploring, kind of like this when I was a kid. I’m excited and curious to find out why there’s a strange factory in the forest just beyond the park. 



On the way, my friends and I couldn’t help but get distracted playing around and exploring in the forest. We swung on and played on the trees like a jungle gym for hours. We almost forgot about the factory. It really felt like being a little kid again. The forest was filled with my friends' echoing laughter and playful banter. It was as if we were frozen in time, reliving those cherished childhood memories. The sun cast a warm, golden hue through the leaves, and the chirping of birds provided the soundtrack to our adventure.



As we ventured deeper into the woods, I couldn't help but notice how the trees seemed to stretch endlessly into the sky, their branches forming a dense canopy above us. The air was thick with the scent of earth and leaves, and the ground was covered in a soft carpet of moss that cushioned our every step. Caleb, the ringleader of our little group, led the way with his boundless energy and infectious enthusiasm. He was always the one with the wildest ideas and the biggest dreams, and it seemed like nothing had changed. He was the first to spot the strange factory in the distance.



It’s weird, and I thought this place was a manifestation of my memories from when I was a kid. But I don’t remember exploring a forest when I was this young or with this group of friends. It was so long ago that I struggle a bit to remember all of it clearly. But I doubt I would forget a factory in a forest connected to the park. When I think of it, I don't remember a forest being connected to the park, at least not this park anyway. There’s the factory. It looks strangely pristine and welcoming, except it's covered in a soft, glowing mist. Just looking at it sends a shiver down my spine, but my friends seem unfazed by it. At this point, I almost want to turn around and go back to the park, but I can’t resist exploring this place. I have to know what’s inside, especially with that oddly faint but beautiful light emanating from it. Besides, as I look back at the forest, I realize It's not much better, and I don't remember the way back anyway. Well, I'd better try to catch up with my friends. I don’t want to be even more lost. This place isn’t so scary. The more we explore it, the more we realize how interesting and even fun it is. This place is starting to seem a bit familiar. I think I have been to a place like this before. I think it was some sort of field trip. I remember being fascinated by the lights, sounds, big freezers, and conveyor belts. It just seemed so otherworldly to me at the time. I was so young, and now my memory is so hazy that it almost feels like a dream. The few memories I have from being this young have almost completely faded. God, that’s depressing because they’re some of the few truly happy memories I have.



I can’t help but smile at the sight of my friends having so much fun. Their laughter and joy are just so infectious. The factory is even more wonderful than I expected. There are all kinds of machines and gadgets that I don’t recognize, but they look cool and futuristic. Some of them are still working, making weird noises and flashing lights. This place is starting to seem like a wonderland, full of surprises and discoveries. Some machines can do amazing things, like create music and paint pictures. My friends and I are having the time of our lives, exploring every inch of the factory. It’s so awesome to press buttons, pull levers, and watch in awe as the machines come to life, creating a symphony of sounds and lights. We pretended to be workers, inventors, explorers, and rebels. We even sang and danced along with the machines. We had so much fun that we lost track of time and forgot about everything else.



However, as the hours pass, a subtle unease creeps deeper into the corners of my mind. It's not about the place itself but rather the idea that this euphoric world could be fleeting and slip away at any moment. This growing sense of dread gnaws at me, but I’m trying to bury it beneath the joy of being with my friends. As the night progresses, the world around us shifts, becoming more twisted and surreal. Everything around me starts to fade away like a painting being washed away by water. Colors blur, blend, and become duller, and the shapes become hazier. The once vibrant factory has begun to lose its luster. The glowing mist is receding, revealing the cold reality that was hidden beneath. The lights flicker and dim, casting long shadows that taunt me. The machinery slows to a grinding halt, the symphony of sounds reduced to an eerie silence. My friends' laughter is becoming distant, their voices muffled, and their once vibrant presence fades. 

Maybe this is just happening here; if we return to the park, everything will be better. As I rush through the factory, I notice it changing further. The machines that once danced with us now seem to groan with exhaustion as they break down and rust before my eyes. The walls are cracked and dirty, and the floor is littered with dust and debris. It's as if this place has been abandoned for years, maybe decades. The factory is crumbling around me, its wonders fading into the void. The entrance seems to be locked or jammed. A sense of urgency creeps in, so I pull harder and harder with all my might. No matter how hard I try and how desperately I want to get back to the park, I can’t force the entrance to open. My body is slumping to the floor as my mind gives way to the feeling of defeat and hopelessness.

Suddenly, panic surges through me, and tears well up in my eyes as the illusion crumbles before me. Memories cascade like waterfalls. I realize that this dreamlike world, this newfound joy, is slipping away. No, this factory isn’t a manifestation of my memories but a distortion of them. A cruel illusion that lured me in and then betrayed me. This realization hits me like a ton of bricks, and a heavy ache settles in my chest. Then, as if on cue, my friends surround me, their faces a mix of sorrow and support, as if they understand the depth of what's happening. One by one, they begin to disappear. Their forms blur and dissolve into vapor like ghosts. My hands pass through my friends like they're clouds as I desperately try to reach out and hold on to this fleeting happiness. It's as if the veil of illusion has been lifted. A dark, thick smog is creeping in, filling the air with a faint smell of smoke and ash. I'm left in a cold, desolate place, the remnants of my joyful memories slipping through my fingers like grains of sand.

As I sit here in the cold, lonely darkness, I can see and feel myself rapidly aging back to adulthood. I can see a dull light shining several feet in front of me. I can see it’s the hallway light shining through the open door into the room I’ve been in this whole goddamn time. I'm back where I started. I was never outside; I’ve been trapped within this cruel labyrinth all along. Well, I have to keep going. As much as I don’t want to go through something like that again, I have to try more doors unless I want to stay trapped in this hell. So, I’ll muster up what strength I have left, get up, and force myself to push on forward. The dark, seemingly endless hallway stretches before me as I search for the next door. I remember this area having fewer doors than the first area, but I remember it being more than this. I wasn't expecting to have to search for another door to try. I hope I can find another door to try. There has to be another door, right?

The shadows that once seemed creepy but harmless now feel like ominous entities. The last time I was here, I thought, or maybe was hoping, that I was just paranoid. But now I’m starting to think something is in here, stalking me. Before their shapes were ill-defined, they looked like hands, sure, but only vaguely. They could have been almost anything, some sort of wires for all I know. I swear they’re slowly taking more definite shapes the longer I’m here. Also, I think they might be starting to move. I better pick up the pace. I don’t want to be here long. Haha, it’s almost funny. I mean, there’s one silver lining. At least this creepy maze is keeping me motivated to find an exit quickly. Wow, I must be getting tired. I think I’m starting to get pretty punchy. I’m almost too exhausted to be scared, even here.

Finally, another door. Hopefully, this is the exit. Where am I now? It looks like some sort of cemetery in the middle of a forest. If I didn’t know any better, I think I was outside. So, is that the big fucked up gag of this place? Am I just supposed to keep thinking, ‘Maybe I have made it out this time’ over and over again until I lose my mind? Well, I’m not going to make that assumption again, not after last time, at least not quickly. What was that? “Hello!?! Is somebody there!?!” I know I heard something, and I’m pretty sure I saw them in the distance. It was so hard to tell. I just saw a tall, dark, thin silhouette in the distance for a second. There it is again, and it’s getting closer. I get the feeling I’m not safe here. I should get out of here quickly. 

I’ve been running for what feels like hours. There’s no way I can keep this up. I’m going to pass out. I really must be starting to lose my mind because that pile of leaves is starting to look so comfy and inviting. It does look to be in a pretty tucked away and hidden place. I haven’t heard or seen anything in a little bit, and I could have lost them. This forest is vast and dense. Maybe if I’m cautious and quiet… I can’t believe I’m even considering it, and there’s no way it’s safe. But FUCK! I can hardly stand, and my eyes are so heavy. I can hardly think, I might collapse out in the open soon if I don’t get some rest.

 It’s just a pile of leaves, but the relief of finding a temporary refuge is washing over me. Exhaustion is consuming every ounce of my energy, and it’s a struggle to catch my breath as it comes in ragged gasps. My body aches, and my heart races, not just from the frantic running but from the fear that still courses through me. The silence is eerie, almost suffocating. Is it possible that I've managed to escape whatever was chasing me? Or is this just another illusion, a cruel trick of this labyrinth?  I can't shake the feeling that I'm being watched. 

The ground beneath me feels oddly soft, and surprisingly, the leaves cradle me in a cocoon of comfort. It's strange how desperation can make even the most unlikely places seem inviting. As dangerous as it is, I need to close my eyes for just a moment to rest and regain my strength. As the seconds pass, the inviting warmth of sleep begins to pull me in. I can hardly fight against it to keep my eyes open, and my mind alert. It’s all I can do to remain in a state of semi-consciousness between wakefulness and sleep."
