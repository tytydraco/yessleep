A year or two after my grandma had died, i was given her vacant ranch house. it had 3 small bedrooms and a little kitchen and living room. the basement was enormous but was full of junk and trash, so i wasn’t able to use it. The same thing applied for 2 of the 3 bedrooms, so only one was available to me. The bed was old and cranky, but clean and good enough for me. I had my siblings help me move in and would stay at my parents house until i had most of my things moved in. 

when i was first cleaning out the house i remember that sometimes i would leave a room and certain way and i would come back and it would be completely different, but i told myself that i was just imagining things. things would randomly fly out of cupboards but i played it off as they were about to fall. headaches would come over me when i would clean out the house and i would have to step outside and rest until they went away. i didn’t bother decorating the house because my grandmothers decorations were still up and i didn’t mind them. 

after getting all of my things inside the house and the necessities unpacked, i spent my first night there. i cooked myself a nice dinner and sat on one of the old chairs in the dining room connected to the kitchen. i pulled out my phone and did whatever while i ate, but i kept feeling a breeze of striking cold air. after a few minutes i looked around to see if maybe one of the windows was partially open or  had a crack, i looked at the front door in the living room and the back door in the kitchen to see if any of the doors were open. Nothing was broken or open. i thought it was just the old house that wasn’t perfectly sealed or something but the breeze kept hitting my bare arms. (mind you that this was a humid night in early july, so it wasn’t cold). 

i finished my dinner and put my bowl in the sink to take care of later. i went to the bedroom i was going to sleep in and realized that bed wasn’t set up yet since my dad had taken it apart after my grandparents died. i told my self that i would set it up in the morning and went to the living room to set up a makeshift bed in there. i got a pillow and some blankets and turned on the tv to watch for a bit until i got tired and would go to sleep. i would’ve slept on the couch but it was getting cleaned. 

At around 11 i got tired enough to fall asleep and shut off the tv. as soon as shut my eyes that cold  breeze came back, but this time it was like wind. i pulled my blankets over my head and rocked myself to sleep. 

I woke up at what must’ve been around 1 or 2AM and this is when i knew i wasn’t imagining things. a lump was laying next to me. Now i knew it wasn’t my cat because my cat wasn’t this big. but the weirdest part was that it was saying my name. pure terror swept over my body and i was frozen. not only was it calling my name, but it was in my mothers voice. i knew it wasn’t her, because 1, why would she be here and 2, the voice wasn’t quite my moms. something about it wasn’t right.

 i just stayed there, frozen for at least 40 minutes, waiting for it to stop, the breeze was also there and i could here the bath water running in the bathroom. tears were flowing out of my shut eyes and i had my hands covering my mouth. the creature never went away until i somehow got myself to fall asleep. 

i woke up in the morning and it was gone. the house was at peace and i didn’t feel the terror anymore. i got up and walked over to my sink to do the dishes and saw my cat with wide eyes and dilated pupils. i tried to bend down to pet her but she just hissed with the same terror in her eyes that i had the night before. immediately that chilly breeze came back and i froze. my sink turned on and i snapped back to reality. i grabbed my cat, flew out the door, and got in my car and drove away. 

i glanced back at the house and saw a man peering out the garage door and blood trickling out of the garage. i stepped on the gas and drove all the way to my parents house. after getting on the highway my cat calmed down and so did i. 

i told my parents that i had forgotten something at their house and that i should have my little sister spend the night at my house as an excuse for me to not be alone. 

nothing happened after that, but occasionally the water would turn on and then off and i would see a man in front of the house when i would leave. i never stayed inside the house unless i had to, and only stayed there for a couple months until i moved in with my boyfriend. 

when i left for the last time after packing everything up, i heard screaming and a faint voice that was the same as the one from the one night saying that i needed to get out and then more things that i couldn’t understand. i quickly shut the door after hearing it and ran out to my car. not once did i look back when leaving that time. not once.
