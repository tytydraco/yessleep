I looked at the hand in the vending machine, stunned. It stood on a rack seen through the glass shield, as if it were a piece of candy someone would want to purchase. Behind it, I saw a line of candy bars stretching to the back.  
  
I heard the chatter of my co-workers in the break room behind me. I glanced up and down the hall, looking for the culprit. I expected to hear someone yell, “April Fool’s!” or something along those lines, even though it wasn’t April.  
  
But as I leaned closer to the hand, I realized that this hand wasn’t some Halloween store prop or a piece of a mannequin. It was dripping blood- dark, clotted drops of it. The fingers had curled up like a dead, dessicated spider, the nails blackened and falling off the skin. A jagged piece of arm bone stuck out the bottom of the wrist. Dried shreds of tendons and ligaments still clung to the yellowed pole of a bone.  
  
I screamed. Everyone in the break room went deathly quiet. I could hear the ticking of the air conditioning, the rattling of vents in the walls, but for a few seconds, not a single human voice echoed throughout the floor.  
  
“Henry?” someone said from behind me. I saw the secretary, Alexis, standing at the threshold of the break room.  
  
She was undoubtedly the most beautiful woman in the office, with her blue eyes, pale skin and long blonde hair that rippled around her shoulders in light, scintillating waves. A smell like peaches and honey emanated from her lithe body. Seeing her face calmed me slightly, yet shivers of anxiety and fear still ran up and down my back.  
  
It was more than just the hand. Invisible electricity seemed to sizzle in the air, as if lightning would strike at any moment. I felt like a man standing next to an empty mass grave, intuiting that the massacre would soon begin but not exactly how or why.  
  
I pointed at the vending machine in horror with a trembling finger. Alexis instantly went silent, staring at the dismembered stump of a hand for a long moment. Then she took out her phone and began to dial 911.  
  
\*\*\*  
  
“The police are on their way,” she told me, her face pale. Others had streamed out from the break room. They all stood around with blank expressions on their faces, like sheep packed into a herd as they waited for the butcher.  
  
“Who would have done such a thing?” the janitor said as he came up to me with his broom and dustpan, his ancient eyes watery and squinted. He walked slowly with a bent back. His light wisps of white hair blew slightly as he went up to the vending machine and put his nose right against the glass, peering at the hand as if it were a great work of art at a museum rather than a rotting piece of biological waste.  
  
“Hey, there’s a wedding ring on it,” he said. I stopped my pacing around the hall at that. Slowly, I walked over to the vending machine and pressed my face close to the glass. The janitor was right- there was an engraved gold ring with writing wrapped around the outside of it.  
  
I squinted, trying to make out the words. I took out my pocket notebook from my shirt and clicked a pen open, scribbling the letters down and trying to make sense of them.  
  
“T… O… M… Y…” I muttered to myself. A few people gave me strange looks, but most just stood there without speaking. I could only make out the first few words.  
  
“To My True Love Lu…” I read on the paper. I showed it to the janitor. He grunted.  
  
“Well, that doesn’t help us a lick,” he said in his quavering voice. “Not a goddamn lick.”  
  
“Lu?” Alexis said, looking at the note over my shoulder. “Maybe it’s Lucius.” I looked up at her quickly. That actually seemed to fit.  
  
“You mean the President of our building?” I asked, knowing the answer. Of course. Lucius Unvayhee. But I wondered how his ring could have ended up on a dismembered hand in the vending machine. Unless it was his hand…  
  
“The police will be here any minute,” Alexis said. “They’ll take care of it and find out what the ring says. Maybe it will help them bring it back to the family of the owner.” I pulled out my phone, nervously checking the time.  
  
“It’s been ten minutes since you called,” I told Alexis, “and I still don’t hear any sirens.”  
  
“It’s probably just a traffic jam!” a woman said from the crowd standing around the break room doorway.  
  
“Maybe someone should call again, just in case,” another faceless voice from the back of the crowd offered. The old man tapped lightly on my shoulder. I turned to look at him. His dark eyes shone with intelligence and wisdom.  
  
“You’re Henry, right?” he asked. I looked down on him with his crooked back and trembling, aged-spotted hands. He must have only stood five-foot-six. He looked so light that a strong breeze might blow him away. I nodded. “Did you find this evidence here?” I nodded again, wondering what he was getting at.  
  
I had begun to sweat, and the feeling of electricity and pressure in the air kept getting stronger, if that was even possible. Something instinctual deep inside me told me to run, not just run from the dismembered hand and my co-workers, but run far away from this building before the pressure blew it apart like a faulty submarine hull at the bottom of the ocean. I took a deep breath, looking around at my co-workers and their staring, curious eyes. I knew if I ran off in terror, they’d probably never let me live it down. I tried to calm myself, but I felt shaky and my heart kept racing. I couldn’t bring myself back to a sense of inner peace.  
  
“And you are…?” I asked the old man in a quivering voice. In his pressed blue janitor’s suit, he made a neat, grandfatherly figure.  
  
“Alvin,” he said, shaking my hand with a strong grip. His slim old fingers wrapped around my hand and squeezed surprisingly hard. Yet I felt the slight tremors in that grasp radiating into my arm.  
  
“Henry, can I talk to you… in private?” he said, his head shaking slightly. I nodded, feeling surreal and dissociated. Alvin turned and began to limp slowly down the hall. A few doors down stood a mostly-empty broom closet, except for a few large buckets of chemicals shoved into a corner next to a small rolling cart filled with rope, tape, box-cutters, screws and a few other odds and ends. I sat down on one of the large chemical buckets, using it as a stool. I saw Alvin do the same, pulling a heavy bucket of floor cleaner forwards with a grunt.  
  
“Do you believe in God, Henry?” Alvin asked. I shrugged.  
  
“I don’t really know,” I said, taken aback. “I guess not. I believe in science. You know, evolution and the Big Bang and everything.” He nodded sympathetically.  
  
“Well, Henry, I can tell you there is a God. In fact, there are many. Do you feel that pressure in the air?” he asked. “That sense of energy?”  
  
“Yeah…” I said. “I figured it was just a thunderstorm approaching.” He laughed at that, a wheezy, chortling sound that shook his frail body.  
  
“No, it’s nothing of the sort,” he responded, shaking his head. “Did you try looking outside yet?”  
  
“What does that have to do with anything?” I asked.  
  
“It has to do with everything,” he said. “I just looked out the window before you all started shrieking. There’s only darkness out there and strange shapes moving around in it, Henry. It’s just blackness as far as the eye can see. It’s like the building’s floating in the middle of… well, I don’t know exactly what. Maybe Hell.” I scoffed at that.  
  
“You’re insane,” I said. “The police will be here any second and…”  
  
“There’s no one coming,” Alvin said, seemingly unperturbed. His old dog’s eyes looked far away, as if seeing through the walls of the closet. He looked like a man with no hope. “No help is coming. We’re stuck here in this building. When I looked out the window before I found you all gathered in the hallway… Well, something was out there in the darkness, looking back.  
  
“I don’t know exactly what I saw. I thought for a moment I must have been dreaming or having a stroke, until I came out and saw that hand. You were all screaming and calling for the cops. But when I looked outside, for the first few seconds, it was like the city buildings flashed on and off, becoming translucent. I could see right through them, into a blackness that stretched forever out into the horizon. There were things crawling through that darkness, pale things that twitched and writhed underneath the city streets. They looked like giant worms with teeth and blood-red eyes, their bodies the color of maggots. A foul, black syrup constantly seemed to drip from their gaping mouths, and they constantly snapped at each other, the larger ones tearing pieces off the smaller ones.  
  
“As the last of the buildings faded out, I saw something hovering above the dark horizon. It hovered high over the pit of abominations thrashing below. It looked skeletal, with its arms and legs stretched out like Jesus on the cross, and yet it just hovered there, unmoving. It had red eyes, flat and shining like rubies.  
  
“Its mouth constantly chattered. It reminded me of a wind-up toy I used to have as a kid. It was just this big mouth, and you would wind the spring back, then the teeth would chatter in this eerie, staccato way. Somehow, I thought I could hear the teeth gnashing and biting even behind the window.  
  
“It felt like staring into an aquarium filled with sharks and Portuguese Man-o-wars just inches away, looking back through the glass. Except these things were far worse than any sharks.  
  
“I just hope that those things that are outside… well, I hope they stay there,” Alvin said. He looked genuinely distressed, and I wondered whether I was dealing with a mentally ill man. “Whatever I saw wasn’t human. This thing looked ancient and powerful. And when I saw it, it saw me too. I know it did. I heard its voice in my head, like the shrieking of tearing metal. It sounded harsh and deep and slow. I wanted it to stop. I wanted to rip into my own head and make that voice stop speaking. I felt like shadowy fingers ran up and down my back when it spoke.  
  
“It said to me, ‘I am the god of the shadows, the first-born in darkness, the eternal. And agony follows me as the Moon follows the path of the stars. Where will you go to escape the death perched over your head like a swinging ax?  
  
“‘Tell those inside that there is no escape. There is no hope of release. You are mine…’”  
  
We sat in silence for a long moment. I looked at him, contemplating his words. Then I got up without a backwards glance and started to leave.  
  
“Great story, Alvin,” I said contemptuously, “but I’m going to see if the cops are here yet. You do what you want.” He didn’t respond.  
  
\*\*\*  
  
And yet, when I opened the closet door, I found the hallway empty. I looked up and down the long white corridor, frowning. I saw the hand still perched in the vending machine, sitting in a slot in front of a bunch of Snickers. The machine claimed the hand cost $1.50. I had an absurd urge to put my credit card in the machine and buy it. The gold ring, after all, had quite a bit of value. And the police were taking their sweet time getting here. I looked at the clock on the wall, realizing twenty minutes had passed.  
  
“Where the hell are they?” I muttered to myself, going to the nearest window about twenty feet away. I looked outside- and froze.  
  
The old man was right. There was nothing. It felt like staring into an endless sky without stars or planets or even dust. But things moved in that darkness. Oh yes, I saw lots of things moving- barely glimpsed most of the time, like shadows dancing over darkness, and yet horrible even to glimpse.  
  
A hand grabbed my shoulder, and I jumped. I spun, seeing a man I had never seen in the office before. He wore a black suit and sunglasses. His shoes had been polished to a reflective sheen. He had close-cropped dark hair and his skin looked tanned and rough, like leather left out in the sun for too long.  
  
“Don’t look,” he whispered. “When you see them, they also see you.”  
  
“What in the hell is going on right now?” I asked, terrified. “And who are you? I’ve worked here for five years and I’ve never seen you before.” A door clicked open down the hallway, and the man pulled a compact Uzi from his inner jacket. He spun in a blur and raised the gun.  
  
“Identify yourself!” he cried. I saw Alvin peeking out of the broom closet, his watery eyes wide and scared like a child’s.  
  
“I’m just the janitor,” Alvin said.  
  
“Put down the gun,” I said, “that’s just Alvin. He’s worked here for thirty years.” The man slowly lowered his Uzi, turning back to face me. Alvin meandered over to stand next to us, looking like a kicked dog. His head was bowed and he kept giving the newcomer worried glances, as if he thought the man might turn and shoot him on the spot.  
  
“I’m Agent Kleiner,” the man said. “I work with the Cleaners.”  
  
“The Cleaners?” I asked. “Is that a janitorial company?” He laughed uproariously at that, a booming sound that echoed down the hallway.  
  
“No, nothing of the sort. I guess you could say we are part private military group and part government agency. But we don’t publicize ourselves. Our job is to track and contain anomalies, and this building has been off-the-chart for the last few days in terms of anomalies. Our readings show increasing electromagnetic energy surrounding the structure, and quite a few bodies have been found mutilated in the area.”  
  
“I didn’t hear anything about that in the news,” Alvin said conversationally. He had decided that the man wasn’t going to hurt him and now perked up, smiling and showing us his nearly-toothless gums. “How come they didn’t report it if people got killed?” Agent Kleiner stared down at Alvin through his shaded sunglasses. He towered over Alvin’s small five-and-a-half foot frame by at least nine inches. I saw thick muscles filling out the suit, bulging beneath the thin cloth.  
  
“Because,” he responded, as if speaking to a child, “we didn’t allow it to go to the news.”  
  
“So how do we get out of here?” I asked. Agent Kleiner opened his mouth to say something when a shriek of agony and terror rang out through the hall. It went on for a few seconds, deafening, as if someone were being burned at the stake. It abruptly cut off. A coughing, choking sound faintly echoed down the hall, and then it was quiet again. I could hear my heart thudding loud in my ears, beating like a bass drum.  
  
I saw someone dragging themselves out of an office room. The figure crawled on the floor, leaving trails of frothy blood streaming behind them. I saw long blonde hair falling over her face, fully covering her features, but I still recognized her instantly. It was Alexis, the secretary. She gurgled as she came near, sounding like someone with a slit throat trying to breathe.  
  
“Holy shit, Alexis? What happened?! Do you need medical attention?” I cried, running forwards to go help her. Agent Kleiner put a strong hand on my arm and pulled me back. I spun to face him, terrified and angry.  
  
“Don’t get near her,” he whispered, aiming the gun at Alexis. “Stay the fuck back, friend. I’m warning you. That’s not the person you think it is. Not anymore.”  
  
She continued to crawl towards us, her bare hands and feet making strange clicking noises on the hard linoleum as she went. A slight breeze blew down the hallway, moving the long hair away from her face. I saw it and screamed.  
  
Alexis had no eyes. Two empty sockets stared up at me, lidless and crying blood. Her lips and nose had been cut off. I saw strange, black, spidery legs peeking out through the holes. They writhed and wriggled and then withdrew back into her skull. She opened her mouth and vomited black, stinking fluid down her chin without slowing. Agent Kleiner raised his gun and fired.  
  
The Uzi hummed like a sewing machine. Its bullets came out so fast I could barely tell one from the other. Its automatic fire blew apart her face and chest in a single spray. She collapsed on the floor, her half-naked body kicking and shaking. Her face had become a mask of bone splinters and cratered flesh. The bullet had torn through her forehead and neck. Yet she managed to open her mouth and laugh. As she did, a torrent of blood rushed out. Something black and skittering sat in the middle.  
  
It looked like a giant spider the size of a baseball with dozens of wriggling legs. It had two red eyes on stalks, like those of a snail. Long, curving pincers clicked open and closed in front of a hideous gaping mouth, filled with sharp teeth covered in some black, stinking fluid. It turned to us and gave a high-pitched hissing noise. The abomination appeared like the world’s ugliest baby, born in a pile of bloody afterbirth and now crying out for the first time in its new world, its mother’s crumpled body laying in a heap behind it. Even though this happened a few months ago, thinking about that abomination still gives me chills.  
  
“God, kill it!” I screamed at Agent Kleiner. He calmly raised his automatic rifle and fired a spray of bullets at the squirming black mass. It looked like a skittering tumor, running across the floor in a blur, its thin, spiky legs reaching out a foot below it and propelling the alien face and thorax high above the floor. The bullets followed the abomination in a trail, but some predatory instinct in the creature kept it one step ahead of the shattering floorboards behind it. It ran under the vending machine with the dismembered hand in it. I swore.  
  
“Are there more of those things in here? What the hell is that?! I hate spiders!” I screamed. Agent Kleiner ignored my outburst.  
  
“Damn it! Now I have to get it out,” Agent Kleiner compained, as if he were only speaking of a trapped housefly rather than a mutated, alien spider. “One of you guys will have to go around the other side and try to scare it in my direction.”  
  
“What do you think this is, a bluejay?” I asked sarcastically. “There is no goddamn way I’m getting anywhere near that thing.” I took a step back for emphasis. I hated spiders, and this thing was far worse than any spider I had ever seen.  
  
The problem solved itself when the skittering black mass ran out, heading straight at Alvin’s steel-toe workboots. It hissed and spat, biting into the composite material and denting it. Alvin began to scream and shake his leg, but the creature hung on with its fangs clamped firmly in place, its pincers working furiously to dig through the hard material. Dark, fetid saliva ran from its mouth as it continued to hiss at him and try to bite its way through the metal.  
  
Agent Kleiner calmly walked over and stomped on it. It flipped over in an instant and wrapped its legs around his shoe. He put his full weight down quickly, smashing it against the floor, but it wouldn’t die. It continued to hiss louder and more black fluid dribbled out of its open, fanged mouth.  
  
He finally kicked his foot forwards to try to get it off, but the alien spider had other ideas. It twisted its dozens of legs around and pulled itself to the top of Agent Kleiner’s leather shoe in a blur. Then it started to run up his leg.  
  
Agent Kleiner’s mask of nonchalance quickly broke. I shared his instinctual sense of horror, backing up quickly. A look of panic transformed his face. He pointed the Uzi straight down as if he would shoot off his own foot.  
  
But at the last second, his instincts and professional training seemed to take over. In a move nearly as quick as the spider’s, he lowered the gun to the side of the spider’s body and fired as it ran up his shin. It had started to open its clicking black pincers, aiming to bite deeply into Agent Kleiner’s leg. Bullets whizzed fractions of an inch from his skin, digging deep craters into the hallway’s white walls.  
  
The spider exploded like a water balloon filled with black sludge. The disgusting slime went everywhere. It painted the bullet-riddled wall next to the vending machine with random splotches of alien blood, like a Rorscach inkblot from a nightmare. Its face landed nearly intact at my feet, its long, curved pincers still opening and closing slowly, its red eyes on stalks still twitching. I quickly backed up away from the nightmare.  
  
“Let’s get the hell out of here,” I said quickly. Agent Kleiner nodded.  
  
“Yeah, we might as well go investigate,” he said lazily. He opened his jacket and pulled out a fresh clip for the Uzi. Agent Kleiner began to walk down the hall. At the end of it stood a massive office, with dozens and dozens of computers and desks.  
  
I walked into the room. Monitors and mouse pads in private work areas stretched all the way to the front wall. A smell almost like stink bugs, starter fluid and copper seemed to emanate from somewhere. It wasn’t overpowering, but the odor made my stomach do flips. I felt some kind of instinctual revulsion.  
  
To my surprise, I saw every one of the seats filled with co-workers. I recognized all of them, at least by face if not by name, and yet no one spoke or moved. They sat as still as corpses. The fluorescent lights above began to flicker violently. I saw all the computers turned on, the monitors showing strange, dark colors spinning in dark kaleidoscopic fractals, zooming forever inwards towards the center.  
  
Agent Kleiner, Alvin and I began to move slowly forwards, towards the first line of desks. I saw an acquaintance I knew from the computer programming department, a balding, mousy man with glasses that made his eyes seem to bulge out of their sockets. I felt a strong urge to call out his name and see if he was alive, but something in me told me to wait. Agent Kleiner had the Uzi raised. I could feel the hairs rising all over my body, as if electricity flowed through the air itself.  
  
As we got closer to the computer monitors, the colors flowing across the screen seemed to darken and speed up. Shades of black and dark ruby-red dripped and melted until all of the light had been leached away. Then the monitors just showed the darkest void. In the glass screens, the black background made a perfect mirror. I could see the faces of some of the people closest to me. I repressed an urge to scream.  
  
I silently ran up to my acquaintance from the programming department and saw my fears confirmed. All of the people had their eyes cut out. Their faces had been slit from ear to ear across their cheeks. It formed a wide, bloody smile. Flaps of mutilated skin hung down. The grinning teeth behind the wounds chattered endlessly. I caught glimpses of spiky, insectile legs reaching out through the holes in their skin. A few black legs would quickly appear out of an eye socket or out the side of a mutilated cheek then disappear in a blur.  
  
The screens all changed at once, a figure forming in the perfectly black backgrounds of the monitors. I saw a skeletal, chattering figure with red eyes that glowed with an eerie inner light. It held its arms and feet out as if it were crucified. Its dark crimson robe fluttered around its body, as if blown by a random breeze passing through the abyss. Thread-like wisps of translucent red light shimmered and rippled around his bones.  
  
On all the screens, I saw the face turn towards me, the ruby eyes staring deeply. I could feel a sickly, diseased presence invading my mind. A voice like grinding metal and roaring engines sounded between my ears, vibrating my body down to the bone.  
  
“I see you. I see you very well. Soon your soul will serve the Red Messiah,” a voice like a rushing waterfall screamed into my brain. My ears seemed to ring. I thought my head would explode from the pressure of it. But then, as quickly as it had begun, it cut out.  
  
The teeth of the skeletal monster on the screens chattered in time with those of the mutilated people all around us. I wondered if anyone else in the building was still alive.  
  
All of my co-workers began to rise at once, as if they were synchronized dancers. With jerky, shaking movements, they pushed out their chairs and turned to face us. Fear rose within my heart. I wanted to run. I took a step behind Agent Kleiner, who continued to survey the transformed mob calmly behind his mirrored shades.  
  
He moved his head slightly towards Alvin and me. He reached into his inner jacket pocket with his left hand, slowly grabbing something and pulling it out. I couldn’t see the object clutched tightly in his fist, his knuckles turning white from the tension, but I figured he had a plan. I let out a long sigh of relief.  
  
“Get ready to run,” he whispered. “As fast as you can.” His face remained stoic and nonchalant, never changing. He threw the object. It gave a long beep as it flew through the air. I only glimpsed it for a moment, but it looked like some sort of futuristic grenade. It had a long, green handle and various flashing lights at the top. It reminded me of a miniature scepter, except with the jewels replaced by bright lights. It flew towards the nightmarish crowd in wide, lazy revolutions.  
  
Every single eyeless abomination in that room began to run at us then. Their hissing and spitting sounded just like the sounds of the spider creature Kleiner had killed, except magnified into a hundred voices. I turned to run and didn’t look back. Agent Kleiner quickly overtook me, sprinting out the door. I heard Alvin puffing behind me, his breathing ragged and heavy. Luckily, we had a small head-start.  
  
As I went left into the hall, sprinting down the white linoleum, I saw a flash of light and felt a wave of heat. A moment later, an ear-shattering boom rang out. The floor shook and walls cracked. I fell forward on my face, smashing my forehead.  
  
The world went dark for a long moment. All I could hear was my breathing, but I smelled thick, cloying smoke.
