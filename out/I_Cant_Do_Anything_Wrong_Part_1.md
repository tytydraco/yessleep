I swear I'm going crazy. Of course, by how things are going lately, nobody would agree. Nobody ever agrees, or calls me out on anything I'm doing anymore. And I've tried, believe me. Good lord how I've tried. 

Let's start at the beginning. My name is Raymond, I live in San Clemente, California, and I can do no wrong. Sounds egotistical, right? What a stuck up, obnoxious, self-assured piece of shit, right? No, you probably *don't* think that. You probably think I'm a paragon of virtue, a blameless man, a saint on Earth, because *everybody does.* I'm praying you people will call me out on this. On *anything* I've done.

It all began with a speeding ticket. I drive to music, you know, to make the trip go by faster. I was on my way to work, idly humming along to "Machinehead" by Bush, when I saw the red-and-blue lights in the rear view. A quick glance at the speedometer told me I'd been going 88 in a 75. Pretty cut-and-dry, I was in the wrong. So I pulled over, rolling my eyes, cursing my fate, waiting for some badge to waddle on up to the window and ask for my license, registration, and probably my immigration papers despite the fact that I was born in fucking Connecticut. Just how these sorts of things always go for me.

I waited and sure enough, some highway trooper in fatigues sidles on up, taking his sweet time, and leans over the driver-side window. Guy looked like a peeled potato with a mustache and a pair of reflective aviators, and I could tell what he was going to say the moment he saw my face. 

"Hablo english?" He asked in something not even approaching proper pronunciation of Spanish. *Hah-blo English.* The last person to speak Spanish as a first language in my family was my Abuelo, and he married a woman who'd been here for a generation. What I'm trying to say is, this racist piece-of-shit cop probably genuinely spoke more Spanish than I did, and even *then*, he spoke it like shit.

"Yes, officer, I speak English," I said through clenched teeth. He looked genuinely taken aback, like I'd just answered in Mandarin. 

"Uh, right. Right. Well, you know how fast you were goin', son?"

*Son*. They always say *son*. Or *honey*, if you're a woman. 

"Nope, officer. Not a clue," I quipped, unable to keep the annoyance from entering my tone.

"Oh, okay. Well, if you look at the gauge on the dash, there's a number that tells you how fast you're going in miles per hour. That number shouldn't exceed the one on the white sign you passed, or else you're breaking the law."

I looked at him with open contempt, but he stared back at me with a dumbstruck, genuine expression.

"I know how a speedometer works, dude."

"Good! That's good. Well, everything seems to be in order. You have a swell day."

I blinked, taken aback. The officer was already turning away, walking towards his car. I sat there waiting for him to come back up with cuffs, or a clipboard, or to actually *do his job*, but to my utter shock he just drove off. He hadn't even seen my license. No ticket, no altercation, nothing. I was dumbfounded. It was so bizarre I looked around for a hidden camera or something to see if I was getting punked. Nothing. People just drove past me on the side of the road, and I pulled out and drove off, this time at the speed limit. 

I would have chalked that up to a very, very weird interaction had it not been for the first thing that happened when I set foot in the office. See, I work at a healthcare office as a receptionist; when we go in, we swipe our ID card and do a quick Covid screen (despite it being, what, five years since the pandemic), then we sit down and help clients. When I went to drop my bag off in the employee area, however, I was careless and I knocked directly into one of my co-workers, who had been holding a cup of scalding-hot coffee. Now I'm a tall guy, so while she bumped into around my collarbone, her coffee went high and hit her right across the face.

She screamed, the most terrible scream I'd heard in my entire life. Steam gushed from the sizzling flesh as  her eyelids blistered. Desperately I tore at my jacket and tried to wipe the liquid off but she was writhing and clawing at her sockets like a madwoman. Blood began to dribble as her nails tore through the flesh of her face. Finally thinking like an *adult* for once, I called for help from other staff and rushed over to the sink to wet down a cloth with cold water. Two other people came running and immediately grabbed the first aid kit I'd ignored in my panic.

"What happened?!" Someone asked as she finally began to stop squirming. White pustules had broken out across her eyelids and deep red gouges where she'd tried to get the searing liquid from her face ran warm blood down her cheeks. As they tended to her, accusatory eyes fell on me and I stammered out an explanation.

"S-sorry, oh my god, sorry! Fuck, it was my fault, I turned the corner and she was there and-"

"*You stupid BITCH!*" My manager roared, so loud it echoed back into the lobby, and his foot cracked directly into her ribs. *CRACK.* Spittle flew from his lips and his eyes bulged from a face the color of overcooked pork as he ranted incoherently at her.

"What the hell?!" I yelped, pulling him off her. His face was a manic rictus of inhuman rage and he spat at the weeping woman over my shoulder before turning to face me. 

It was like a switch flipped, and the color drained from his face in a rush. Jack was not a pleasant man, but I'd never heard him raise his voice, and certainly never seen him act in violence against anyone. The shrieking monster bled away and Jack smiled at me in an avuncular sort of way.

"Raymond! So sorry you had to see that. You're not hurt, are you?"

"Hurt?! No, *I'm* not hurt, but Susan-"

"-will be disciplined properly, I promise. I can't believe how careless she was!"

Someone tending to her smacked her across the face as she wept.

"What the fuck?! No, it was *my* fault, not Susan's! What are you doing?"

"N-no... I d-deserve it..."

I turned to see Susan sitting up, blood and pus running down her abused cheeks. Her eyes were shut tight and the others were holding her arms back as if to restrain her.

"I d-deserve it..." She whimpered, and nobody spoke.

"No! No, you don't! What the fuck is going on? I made a mistake, it was *me*, not her! She needs help!"

Jack snorted derisively.

"You shouldn't defend her, Ray. She'll lose her job for this, I'll make sure of it."

"No! Absolutely not, what the hell?"

The inhuman rage bled back into Jack's face and he started towards her.

"You hear me, *bitch?!* You're *done!* You're fucking *through!* Get your shit, and get the *fuck-"*

I did the only thing I could do. I punched Jack. It was an awkward, shaky swing that grazed his ear and barely connected. It was pure panic; at that moment, I felt like if I didn't stop him, he would *kill* her. 

The effect was instantaneous. The crowd gathered around Susan stopped restraining her and immediately moved to restrain Jack. They forced him to his knees and put him in an arm lock, while Susan staggered to her feet. She was blind and I caught her before she could stumble.

"Jack, what the hell is wrong? It was an accident! And it was *my* fault!"

Jack shook his head in bewilderment.

"I- I-..." He stammered, and tears glistened in his eyes.

"I'm so sorry, Ray. I'm so very sorry."

"Don't apologize to *me*! Apologize to *her!*"

He looked at her blankly, his eyes barely focusing on her.

"Susan? Why?"

"You kicked her in the ribs, you fucking psycho!"

Susan sniffled. Security had arrived and the paramedics had been called, thank god. The officers put Jack in cuffs and led him towards the back door.

"We've got him now, Ray. And someone will look after Susan. Why don't you take the rest of the day off? We'll get someone to fill."

I nodded, still shell-shocked by the turn of events. Without further comment I headed out into the parking lot towards my car. I got in and just sat there, staring blankly at the dashboard. It felt like a dream.

A sudden crack jolted me out of my daze and I looked up towards the alley. One of the security officers holstered his service weapon and was talking with his fellows.

They'd executed Jack in the alley.
