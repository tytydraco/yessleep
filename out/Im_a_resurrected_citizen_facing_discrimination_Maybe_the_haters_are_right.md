I’m feeling sick right now, I’m writing fast and I have to go back and fix every other word. Sorry, but I really need to get this out before I implode. My god, I smell like bleach. My whole room does. You know that chemical stink that you can even taste in your throat. I threw up twice already. I bagged my clothes – everything – and threw them in the communal garbage bin. Maybe I should’ve burned them.

 

I tried posting this on r/depression an hour ago. Didn’t even care for the experts’ advice, I just wanted to talk about it with anybody. Mods took it down literally a minute later. “Controversial/Political topic”. Seems like the trauma of coming back from death is political nowadays. Before that, I tried on r/legaladvice, you know, for all the rising discrimination and hate towards us. Got a permaban for trolling.

 

So, this is my last resort. Believe me, I’m not a troll, or an activist. Never cared about politics. I’m not seeking validation and I don’t care what your opinion is about resurrection. I’m just scared shitless. And the worst part? My heart keeps this perfectly calm click, like it just doesn’t care.

 

My name’s Tom, 22. I’m a medical student on my first year, though I used to study Physics. I switched last October after I came back. Don’t know exactly why, you can say it was because I wanted to repay the debt or because I simply wanted – or needed – to understand how a human body can stop working and rot for days, to then just start again. But mostly you can say I had to know if my body is still biology or has become… mechanics.

 

I live in a small village in Southern Italy. A suffocating place. Not going to say the name because I’m the only resurrected citizen in this shithole of a place, and my life is already hell. If you know this part of the world, you can picture the cobblestone streets too narrow for cars and the church bells ringing every fifteen minutes to remind you God is watching. Where the sweet grandmas sit outside judging your sins from their balconies. They spit at my feet if I dare to take a walk during the day.

 

Traditions here are like air, and anything new is regarded as the devil’s gift. Discrimination is not a word because it’s the normality. Any kind of –ism or –phobia you can name, we have it, here where the average age must be something like 70. And people like me – the resurrected – are the very bottom, below stray dogs. Funny thing is I’m not even an atheist like most people my age; I’ve never been a proper perfect Christian, I admit, but I do believe. Yet, I’m no longer welcome in our church.

 

If I had been born in the US, this wouldn’t be happening, most likely. My family wouldn’t have been able to afford the therapy. Well, not my family, actually. Just my mother. I would’ve stayed dead. I know you guys overseas may think otherwise, but believe me… you are the lucky ones. An American friend of mine told me it can get up to a million dollars there. But here in Europe? It’s basically free; our Government calls it “Right to Life”. When they scraped me off the asphalt, five months ago, they didn’t ask for my credit card. If you die of any non-natural cause – doesn’t matter what – they just bring you back, as long as your brain is intact. You don’t even get a choice; I guess for them it’s better to recycle a taxpayer rather than pay the death benefits to the family. Right? That’s why more and more people are signing an LMS paper (Let Me Sleep, or in Italian: *Lasciatemi Dormire*; basically our version of the DNS – Do Not Resurrect – card you have in the US). My dad did, he doesn’t waste any occasion to remind me. So that’s the mood these days. Being dead is preferred to… well, being like me?

 

I don’t think I need to explain the resurrection to you guys. Unless you’ve been living under a rock for the last two years, you know the drill. You’ve seen all the debates in TV, you’ve heard the Vatican calling it “The greatest abomination of modern times”. You’ve seen the violent protests in London, in Berlin, and the riots all over Texas and Florida. But until you actually go through it (and I don’t wish that to anybody), you have no idea how it feels.

 

It was five months ago, when I was still normal. Well, kind of. It was late July, and you can imagine what summer feels like here. Hot and humid, the heat that makes you sweaty and gross all day and night. We were coming back from a nice day at the beach – Alex and me. We were arguing about something stupid, I don’t even remember because it feels like a dream now. Maybe some movie or some series he was obsessed with. I stepped off the sidewalk. I don’t remember the car, just the sound, like when you crunch a can of coke, but amplified tenfold. My only thought on the spot went to my ruined ice-cream hitting the asphalt, because I didn’t even realize what happened.

 

You probably think getting run over is painful, but I didn’t feel pain. No idea how fast was that car going, enough to break my bones and snap my neck. No pain, just such an intense heat, and the lights went out the moment I hit the ground. It was like falling from your bed. People who came back from near-death experiences talk about tunnels of light, dead relatives smiling at you, white gates or angels. Wasn’t like this for me. It was like drowning, that’s it. No lights, no God. Just blood rushing through my nose and throat and filling my lungs. It lasted for a second.

 

And then I was back. Like blinking. A week had passed, but for me it was like falling asleep and waking up without remembering your dream. But you know, when you sleep you still have some sense of time passing, right? Even if you close your eyes and reopen them 8 hours later, you still know time has gone by. For me this wasn’t like that. One second I was drowning on that street, feeling the pressure crushing me, and the next I was in the resurrection ward of my region. They had just pulled the breathing tube out and my throat was burning. My bones ached.

 

“Welcome back, son,” the doctor standing over me said. He didn’t even smile or look at me. He checked his tablet and looked bored.

 

He mumbled to a nurse, I didn’t understand anything. When they looked at me, I could tell their eyes were cold, as if you know, they had just repaired a malfunctioning machine. The nurse at least pretended to smile, even if she was a bad actor honestly. But I don’t judge her. They were both young and looked exhausted. The doctor used a lot of words that were sci-fi to me at the time. Neuro-preservation, synaptic-something, bio-cardiac-whatever-the-fuck.

 

Basically: my heart was gone, so they had to cut it out and replace with a bio-pump shaped like a fist, and the “battery” – the thing everybody hates the most – was automatically pushing the synthetic blood through my veins. He told me I would feel cold, that I wouldn’t have the need to sleep as much as before and my appetite would also change. You know that.

 

Before dying, I never really cared about getting to know how this worked. Because I thought, it didn’t concern me. I thought it was never going to happen to me. You know, I guess everybody thinks that, more or less. Until it happens. The doctor did tell me that I was going to feel… detached. Kind of a nice way of putting it. He said the feeling wasn’t going to last longer than a month at most. What he didn’t warn me about, was that I’d feel like I had stolen somebody else’s body. And that my eyes would change. They’d catch the light but remain empty. White. I saw the reflection in the window when the nurse turned off the lights.

 

“You’ve been dead for seven days. We repaired the structural damage and installed the battery. You’ll feel a bit… laggy, for a couple of days, until your body becomes used to it. Avoid moving too much for now.”

 

Then he said that word. He called me a “marvel of modern science”. As I was lying on the bed, touching my cold chest and listening to my new “heartbeat” – a ticking sound, like a rhythmic, endless mouse click – I understood that I was no marvel. The doctor was wrong, but I’m sure he knew that. I was basically a patchwork. Some kind of Frankenstein monster. But I was alive. I could breathe and feel pain. My mum screamed when they let her in. Dad didn’t come. Alex held my hand the whole day. They both never stopped crying, they made me feel so guilty. So, back then, I thought in the end it was worth it.

 

I didn’t expect that dying was going to be the easiest part.

 

At least when I was dead, nobody looked at me with disgust. Nobody was afraid. Going back home threw me straight into my “second life” like a prisoner being finally released for a crime he didn’t commit, but everybody labelled him as the serial killer. You can be free from the cage, but it doesn’t matter when all the eyes are always on you.

 

You have to understand that my town is ancient. Mentality hasn’t changed a bit since the 50s. Growing up as a gay guy in a place where most people believe in the “evil eye”, call the priest to exorcise their bedrooms and where masculinity is measured in how many girls you knock up – it was already a death sentence for your social life. I had to learn how to be invisible. But I didn’t. I never came out of the closet; I was dragged out three years ago when this old neighbour, Mrs Teresa – they used to call her “the nun”, she passed last month at age 98 – saw me kissing Alex in his car. Gossip spread like covid. Next morning, the whole town knew.

 

My family isn’t much different. Very conservative. But my dad – he’s a man of the old century. He didn’t hit me physically. He just stopped looking at me in the eyes and said God gave him a gay son to punish him for his sins. Well, he used the F word actually. Mum kept telling me he just “needed time”. And then, after my resurrection, he stopped looking at me entirely.

 

My brother Sam didn’t really change at all. He was a spoiled asshole before and is a spoiled asshole now.

 

“Can you turn it off? It’s annoying,” he said once, at the kitchen table.

 

“No,” I replied, feeling full after eating a quarter of my plate of pasta. “If I turn it off, I’d die again.”

 

Everything shook when dad slammed a fist on the table. “Shut the fuck up! If you say that one more time I’ll kick you out of my house.”

 

He didn’t refer to that word, “die”. He meant he didn’t want a reminder of his son being a zombie. My mum was the only one who stood between them and me. She signed the papers and paid for my rehab, and the only one in my house who looked happy. I think she’s really trying but she’s not really convinced. Dad didn’t want to spend a single cent.

 

That was nothing anyway. I was used to it already. What I can never forgive though, is Nami.

 

Nami was my cat. The cutest tabby girl you’d ever seen. Grumpy. She hated most people and other animals, but she loved me and I loved her. I found her when I was 10. She would be 12 now, she survived a lot – cancer, a dog aggression, some stupid kids almost burying her alive. After I came back from death, aside from mum and Alex, she was the only one I wanted to see.

 

When I got home, her bowl was gone, so was her scratching post and her litterbox. And so was she. Dad said she had ran away while I was gone, probably “looking for me”. I knew he was lying because she was old, couldn’t even jump or run that much. Then he changed his version and said he “rehomed” her. He’s never been a cat person. He’s never been a pet person at all, actually. I know he took her in his car, drove to the middle of nowhere and dumped her. To get rid of the last thing that reminded him of me. I miss her every day.

 

God, this smell is making me nauseous. I think I’m going to throw up a third time soon. Some bleach got on my skin, and it burns. I haven’t managed to get the blood off my nails.

 

You may think being treated like a leper by my dad and brother is horrible, but the outside world is worse. I know I should stop but it’s stronger than me. I can’t help it. It’s self-harm but what else can I do? I keep checking on r/banresurrection. You’ve all seen it, you know what’s like. After they first quarantined then banned r/resurrection, that’s what’s left. The threads, the statistics. It’s basically r/banpitbulls… but with us.

 

“Resurrected individuals are 70% more likely to commit violent crimes.” That’s the stat they love to quote. But don’t mention that most of them are people actually trying to defend themselves from those who want to beat us up.

 

“New study shows inhibition centres in resurrected individuals are decayed.”

 

“Murders perpetrated by resurrected increased 4 times in 2025”

 

That’s what we are for the world. Pitbulls, wagging their tails one moment, eating a toddler’s face the next. I have to say I’m lucky Alex is quite a big guy and nobody dares approaching me when we’re out. Those rare times I’m outside by myself? I’m shitting my pants every time somebody walks by.

 

I can’t even buy groceries anymore. They stopped selling “hazardous materials” to us, and they can stretch that label to almost anything. Yesterday, mum asked me to get her a lighter from the store. She’s a big smoker even if I’ve been trying to make her quit since forever. Well, the cashier refused to sell me that because my ID has the resurrected stripe. She even threatened to call the police.

 

If any of you are still on Twitter – or X, whatever – you’ve noticed the hashtag #burnthedead trending right now. Apparently, a leak claimed the guy behind the terrorist attack in Paris last week was a resurrected. It’s not even confirmed. Just a rumour. What I read broke me. I spent the evening crying, feeling trapped. I needed air, so I put on my jacket and I went for a walk. Usually I need more than that to keep me from freezing, since my body temperature never reaches 35°C (95°F) – but tonight was warmer for December. Thanks climate change, I guess.

 

I wish I didn’t. It was almost midnight when I stepped out. Streets were empty, exactly how I like it. Maybe the only good thing about this place. I pulled the hood up, tucked my hands in pockets and just walked, and breathed. Didn’t care where I was going as long as no one was around. And even then, I stuck to the shadows out of habit. Alex lives on the other side of the town, near the next one – I thought about going there but he must have been already asleep and I didn’t want to wake him up. He would’ve worried too much if he saw me shaking and crying, and would’ve stayed up all night. And he has work tomorrow.

 

So I just wandered aimlessly, until I saw her. She stood under a streetlight, phone in one hand and a bag clutched to her chest. Young, probably my same age. Looking around, over her shoulder. On the same sidewalk I was walking on.

 

She flinched when she heard my footsteps and turned. Her hand tightened around her phone. It stayed dark. I should’ve probably switched to the other sidewalk to show I was not a threat. I don’t think I can imagine what it feels like being a girl alone in the middle of the night and watch a guy in a hood approach you. She did look at me with a face that screamed, “please don’t kill me.” She would’ve never imagined I was thinking the same.

 

I sped up a bit, just because I wanted to pass her and go my way. When I got close, she gasped. I could hear that. Her eyes were wide. I should’ve just kept going. But I stopped, raising my hands. I tried to keep my voice as low and soft as I could.

 

“Sorry! Didn’t mean to scare you. I’m just… taking a walk.”

 

She hesitated. I doubt she could see the white in my eyes, or the pale skin through the dark. But I was afraid she could hear my heartbeat.

 

“Is okay.” She smiled, I’m sure she faked it. “I am lost, phone battery die. You know where is hotel?” Her Italian was broken and strongly accented. Sounded eastern European.

 

“Yes, of course,” I replied and tapped on Google Maps on my phone. My hand was shaking when I showed her the position on the map, and so was her hand when she checked it. “It’s a ten-minute walk at most. Straight that way, then to the left. You can’t get it wrong.”

 

She thanked me. I told her to be careful, and warned her about the streetlights on the next street being off. I faked a smile as well and was about to go my way, but she called me again.

 

“You live here?”

 

“Yes,” I tried to keep my head low. “Unfortunately.”

 

For just a second, I felt lighter. Almost good. Warmer. Because she laughed at my bad joke. I don’t know, guess I was so much starved of humanity that even a normal, small laugh made me feel happy. We started walking in the same direction. She actually asked me if I could walk with her until the hotel. For safety. Told me she saw some creepy young guys earlier.

 

I asked her what she was doing in such a shithole of a town. I didn’t use that word. She told me she was from Ukraine, here for studying and learning the language. Then she hit me with that question that made me almost trip over my own feet.

 

“You are returned?”

 

“Excuse me?”

 

She smiled again, but I could tell this time it was not fake. “Resurrected. We say returned in Ukrainian.”

 

I thought she was about to insult me. Maybe spit on me. But she didn’t.

 

“In Kyiv, many are returned. Soldiers, civilians. Is normal. My dad is returned. Is beautiful.”

 

There, I was about to start crying again. I felt this lump in my throat. Five months. For the first time in five months, somebody talked to me not like a freak. And what was that word she used? Beautiful. I’ve read that discrimination towards resurrected is mostly a western thing, but didn’t really believe it. I can understand it, though.

 

“So, you don’t mind? That I’m–”

 

“No. You seem nice guy. I am Julia,” she pronounced it with a liquid sound. Like Yulia.

 

“I’m Tom.”

 

We turned the corner, walked down the dark underpass, towards the hotel. She was talking about how much she liked the architecture of the towns here, and the food. I didn’t say much, just nodded, with a smile that must have made me look like an idiot. I was at peace. She thanked me again, said she didn’t want to disturb me further, with the hotel a hundred metres away (\~300 feet). I waved and watched her go. The next moment, I was standing in front of my house.

 

My arms and shoulders ached. My breath was heavy. As if I had just finished lifting heavy weights. It happened exactly like when the car killed me. A blink, and the world transformed. I didn’t faint, I’m sure. It was like a snap. I can tell you I heard something just a fraction of a second before it happened. A click, but not like the bio-pump in my chest. It was more of an electric click, I don’t know how to properly describe it. Like the sound of lightbulbs going out after a power cut.

 

I looked around, disoriented – took me a bit to recognize the street and the gate of my house. Nobody was there. Julia was gone. The last image was her walking with her hotel on the background. At least two kilometers from here (1,2 miles).

 

My hoodie was ruined. Covered in dark and wet patches all over my chest and sleeves. Scratched. My back hurt like after a night sleeping on a bad couch. My jeans were torn. And my hands…

 

I rushed inside, stripped off my clothes before even closing the door behind me, and locked myself in the bathroom. I tried soap, bleach. I scrubbed my skin and clothes until it hurt and burned. I don’t understand what happened. I’m afraid somebody attacked us.

 

Julia talked about a group of young, creepy guys. I heard about these so-called baby-gangs doing any sort of horrible stuff. Name better targets than a resurrected and an immigrant. Did they attack us in the underpass? Hit me on the head? But my head’s fine. I checked my entire skull. It doesn’t hurt. There’s no bump, no wound. No blood. That is just on my clothes and hands. Did I fight them off? And what happened to Julia, did she run away?

 

I stuffed all my clothes in a bag and threw them out. I can’t go to the police. You know why. A resurrected walking into a police station with blood on his body? They wouldn’t lock me in jail. As soon as they see the resurrected stripe on my ID, they’ll throw me out and let an angry mob take care of me.

 

And in all of this, my heart is still the same, repetitive and endless click.

 

I need to go. I have to throw up again.
