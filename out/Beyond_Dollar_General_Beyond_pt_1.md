Hey everybody, it's been a little while.

I bet you never thought you'd hear from me again.

It's been about three months since Gale, Celene, and I escaped from the Dollar General Beyond, and a lot has changed.

First off, I haven't been back inside a Dollar General since that night I first stepped into the bathroom and was cast into the infinite Dollar General.

I took the money Agent Cash gave me and put a down payment on a place. I didn't have anything to move, all my stuff got taken or donated when I didn't pay my rent. Luckily, my parents had got my car from the impound so that was a nice surprise. The amount I'd gotten put some basic furniture in my new house, and it's got a nice little backyard for Buddy to run in. Before you ask, don't worry. I didn't break the bank, and I got all the furniture for my house from Goodwill and barely broke a couple hundred bucks. I've got a buddy who's a stockbroker that I gave a little money to, and he's been giving me updates that sound pretty good to me. I never thought I'd be one of these Wall Street guys, but so far I haven't had to go back to work. It's just been buddy and me for the last little bit, watching movies and enjoying being back in the real world.

I wish I could say that all of us have been enjoying our time in the real world, but that would be a lie.

Celene and Gale have been living in motels mostly. They decided to stay together, no surprise there, and I saw a pair of rings last time we met up which makes me think they're planning on making it official. We still meet up for food or I have them over to the house for dinner once or twice a week, and I wish I could say that being out of the Beyond has done them both good.

Celene is adjusting well, but Gale looks rough. Something happened to him in the ceiling, something he still won't talk about, and I think it's making him crazy. Being around Celene seems to help, but when she isn't around, I see him glancing around nervously. He looks like he hasn't been sleeping, and Celene told me she didn't think he had been. She wakes up sometimes to find him staring into the bathroom door, and it scares her a little.

"He won't answer me right away when I call him, and I thought at first that he was sleepwalking. He just stares at the door, seeing something only he can see, but when I touch him, he jumps like I've burned him. I don't know what he's seeing, but I'm afraid it's more of the same thing we saw in the Beyond."

Gale denies it when I ask him, but I don't know if I believe him.

Then, a week ago, Celene called me and said Gale had been taken to jail.

"They thought he was drunk, and thank God for that. If they realized how far gone he was, they might have had him committed."

Gale went into a Dollar General near the hotel they were staying at, and after getting the key, he just opened the bathroom and looked into the space as if he could see something. He closed the door and opened it again, and after doing this for about fifteen minutes, the manager went to try and get him to stop. When he wouldn't, they tried to take the key from him, and Gale didn't seem to like that. He scuffled with the manager, trying to get the key back, but the Manager was an ex-marine and put Gale on his head. They called the cops, and Gale ended up in the drunk tank.

"Can you go bail him out?" Celene asked, "I can give you the money, but I think he might talk to you if you ask him about it. He doesn't want to worry me, but you two have been through it together. He'll talk to you, I know he will."

I told her I would try, and one bail payment later, Gale and I were on our way back to their motel.

He seemed to realize we were taking the long way and gave me a look of said resolve.

"She wants you to talk to me, doesn't she?"

"Yeah," I said, deciding not to beat around the bush, "She's worried about you, and I am too. What were you thinking, Gale? Why would you ever go into one of those stores again? What if the bathroom had led back to the Beyond."

"I was hoping it would."

We were silent as we drove, and I wasn't sure how to answer him.

"Why would you ever want to go back there?" I asked after some time, not really sure what to expect.

"Because when I was there, I could get away from the Miasma, but now that I'm here, I can see them all the time."

He told me that every time he woke up, he could see them on the ceiling. They watched him from the darkness, their eyes on him as they danced in the murk, and it was all he could do not to scream. He would go to the bathroom and try to leave, just as he'd always done in the Beyond, but the door was just a normal door. The doors here went nowhere except where they were supposed to, and he was afraid that the Miasma would get him again and take him back to that monochrome hell.

"I'm afraid they won't stop with me," he said, shaking a little as he looked at his feet, "I'm afraid they'll get Celene. I'm afraid they'll get you. Hell, I'm afraid they'll get the damn dog too. We did the impossible, we escaped their trap, but they can't have that. They need us all back inside so we don't blab, and they need it soon before someone figures it out."

I didn't know what to say to that. He wasn't wrong. The fact that I've been talking to all of you is probably the only reason we haven't been snatched up by whatever mysterious organization congregates around the Dollar General, and I was pretty glad for that. If Gail was seeing Miasma outside the stores, however, then there were only two real options.

The first was that we were all in pretty big danger.

The second was that Gale was losing it.

Either way, it sounded like we needed to support each other, and Celene might need more help than she was letting on.

By the time I pulled up at the Corbin Heights Motor Lodge, I already had a plan brewing.

Celene met me at the door to their motel and I told her to pack what clothes they had.

"You two are coming to stay with me."

Celene started to object, saying they couldn't impose like that, but I insisted.

"I thought this might happen, so I went ahead and got a guest room ready. There's no sense wasting all your money on a motel room when I have a three-bedroom house all to myself. You two can stay with me for as long as you need. Buddy will be exstatic to have you guys there full time."

The fur ball was, indeed, ecstatic and my friends settled into the guest room easily enough. Much like me, they didn't have a lot of luggage, and the few clothes and things they did have fit easily in the closet. They brought the food they had in the room with them too, and we went and bought some groceries for the house. That night we all sat down to a fantastic meal of spaghetti and meatballs, and it honestly felt like old times as I sat around the table with them.

That night, they both went to bed in a slightly used number I had gotten from Habitat for Humanity, and Buddy and I went to sleep in our room.

At around two, I heard Celene calling Gale, and when the door to their room closed, I smiled and went back to sleep.

Gale seemed to do better for the first few nights. He actually slept for a change, the bags under his eyes got a little better, and I started to think that being back among friends might help him get back to his regular self. He helped out around the house, he walked Buddy, and Celene said he was finally sleeping through the night. If he still stopped to look into open doors sometimes, it was only briefly. If he stared at the ceiling a little too long sometimes, well, he had been through hell, so why wouldn't he check his surroundings?

I should have known that the good times would be too good to last.

On the fourth night in the house, Gale woke us all up screaming.

It started around midnight, and Buddy came awake fitfully from his bed in the corner. He was barking and scrabbling at the door, and I heard Celene calling Gales's name as she tried to calm him down. Gale was shouting about how they were "here to get him" and I was careful to lock buddy behind the door before I went to go help. I could see light underneath the door, and when I opened the door to my guest room, I squinted as a bright light hit my face.

Gale was wielding a mag light like a sword and flailing around as he lit up the ceiling. Celene was against the wall, trying her best not to be hit by the heavy light, and looked relieved when she saw me. She scooted around the bed and made her way to me, looking back at Gale as he looked around for whatever he thought might be trying to get him. I closed the door to the guest room, locking it behind us as I left Gale to get it out of his system.

Celene and I went to the kitchen, and I made some hot cocoa as she tried to calm herself.

"It's never been this bad," she said softly, her head in her hands, her body shaking a little.

"So the night terrors are new, then?"

She nodded, accepting the cup of cocoa I offered her, "He's mumbled and thrashed some in his sleep, but he's never been violent. I'm worried. I don't know what we're going to do if he keeps doing this."

I sipped at my own cocoa, thinking about how to broach the subject I had been considering.

"Could this be something different? Besides something attacking him from the DGB?"

"What do you mean?" asked Celene.

"I mean," I started, trying to be tactful, "You and Gale were in the Beyond longer than I was. Could he be experiencing something like The Hermit did?"

Celene pursed her lips, clearly not wanting to hear this, "Jasper had dementia before he came to the Beyond. Being there may have made it worse, but it wasn't the reason for it. I don't think Gale has dementia. I think he may have PTSD, but I think his mind is," she stumbled, not sure what she thought but wanting to power ahead, "I think Gale is fine. He's just rattled is all."

I wasn't so sure, but I kept it to myself.

When the screaming began that night, however, I was the one who was in for a surprise.

I woke up not because of the screaming, but because Buddy was growling like a wild animal. He was crouched in front of the door, his ears back and his teeth bared as he prepared to do battle with my door. I went to him, calling his name and trying to see what was happening, and that's when I heard the screaming. I had expected Gale's panicked yells, but when I heard Celene's high-pitched distress as well, I knew something was up. I grabbed a flashlight and Buddy and I came tearing up the hallway as we tried to see what was going on.

I opened the door to find Celene pinned against the wall but a large, dark something, as Gale tried to free himself from the sheets he had tangled himself in. It was lifting Celene up by the arm, and despite its translucent, she was rising with that muscular arm as it drug her. It turned its head when I came in, and as those familiar yellow eyes settled on me, I began to believe Gale was seeing more than nightmares.

The beam of my flashlight cut across the arm of the creature, and Celene dropped in a heap at the base of the wall. The creature turned its massive, shadowy head, the shadows around it bringing it to its normal height. It was soon towering over me, filling the room with its bulk, and it was like being back in The Outside. This was not something that should exist in our world, but here it was in all its terrible glory. What could we do against this thing? It was in its element, it had us dead to rights, it...

I reached out shakily, and it roared as it sensed my intentions.

I flipped the light switch on, and the creature became vapor as the light fell across it. It didn't disappear immediately, but it wasn't capable of holding its form with the intrusion of brightness. It swiped its arm around, trying to get something before it was forced to retreat, and as it vanished into nothing, it loosed another of those earsplitting roars.

The three of us just stood there in the aftermath, trying to process what had happened, when Gale's voice broke us from our stupor.

"I told you I wasn't crazy."

It's dawn now, and we've been talking about this for hours.

I don't know what this means or what we'll do, but it's pretty clear that we have a problem.

The Dollar General Beyond is reaching out for us, and despite our best efforts to put distance between us and it, we seem unable to escape it.

I'll keep you all posted on what we decide, but for now, I think we'll be sleeping with the lights on.

Till next time.
