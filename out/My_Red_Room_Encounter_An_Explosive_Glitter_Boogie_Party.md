So, here’s the deal: when your best friend calls you up and says, “You’ve got to come to this underground drag party; it’s going to be insane,” and you’ve got nothing better to do, you go. At least, that’s how I ended up at a party that might have been the last decision I ever made.

When I walked into the place, the first thing I noticed was the smell. Imagine a combination of old gym socks and burnt toast, with a hint of something that might be decay. The room was a nightmare of black velvet and dim, flickering lights. It was like a bad dream you couldn’t wake up from—every shadow seemed to writhe and pulse with malevolent glee.

My friend Simon, dressed in a fabulous but hilariously ill-fitting tuxedo, was waiting for me. He was practically bouncing with excitement. “Darling, you made it! This place is a riot!”

“Right,” I said, eyeing the peeling wallpaper and the decrepit armchairs that looked like they had been recycled from a haunted house. “Looks like the horror section of a thrift store threw up.”

Simon laughed nervously. “Don’t worry, I really trust Dolly, just look at her fake tits. That’s a party girl.”

I glanced at Dolly Petite, who was making her grand entrance through a curtain of sequins. Her dress sparkled like a disco ball, but the light from her oversized feathered hat cast a sinister shadow. “Uh-huh,” I said, scanning the crowd of eccentric partygoers dancing erotically. “I’m sure this is going to be memorable.”

I had just settled into a corner, trying to figure out if the drink in my hand was actually alcohol or an elaborate prank when the room’s energy shifted. The pumping boogie music turned into static. I could hear muffled whispers and giggles, and I could swear I felt a chill creep down my spine.

“Okay, this is definitely not in the brochure,” I said, fumbling for my lighter. I managed to spark it, lighting my cigarette and casting an uneven glow over the dark corner. The light revealed three party guests—Dolly Petite, Emerald Gator, and Max—the trio who, to my knowledge, were hosting the event.

“Oh, honey!” Dolly’s voice was suddenly closer than expected. “We’re just about to go to the VIP section, but how do you like the static sound? It’s called red noise.”

“It’s fantastic,” I replied, tempted to ask if the VIP section was soundproof.

Max swirled a glass of something that looked suspiciously like it had been mixed in a lab. He gave us a smirk that made my butt cheeks clench. “You’re in for a real treat tonight. Just remember, what happens here stays here. And if you’re not into surprises... well, we do have a lovely exit.”

Simon clapped a hand on my shoulder, his excitement wavering. “See? They’re just messing with us. Now, come on, let’s get another drink before—”

A high-pitched giggle interrupted him. Emerald’s smile was tight as she adjusted her glittery shawl. “We’re just glad you could join us. You know, raves and underground parties can be scary sometimes. They target specific groups of people, but you never know who else might be there.”

“Right,” I said, raising an eyebrow. “Like an exclusive dinner party where the special of the day is you. And your parents invited a bunch of random guests over.”

Emerald’s smile grew even tighter. “Exactly. And while Max and I love the attention, our parents can be really, really mean with whom they invite over.”

Max’s smirk turned a little less jovial. “They don’t care for our comfort much, actually.”

Simon cleared his throat awkwardly, shifting his feet. “Oh, well, that’s, um, intense.”

Trying to salvage the mood, Dolly waved us goodbye and motioned to the sibling pair to follow her to the VIP section. “We’ll be right back.” Simon and I exchanged uneasy glances.

“What the fuck was that?” I asked Simon, creeped out by the oversharing and seemingly threatening insinuations.

“I don’t know. Maybe they’re having a bad night.”

A sudden loud clang interrupted our conversation. The lights flickered ominously before plunging us into darkness. My heart skipped a beat. “Oh, this is just fabulous. I was hoping for a little excitement tonight, but I didn’t expect a blackout.”

Simon’s voice trembled. “I think we might be in trouble.”

Before I could reply, a high-pitched, maniacal laughter echoed through the room. The lights came back on, revealing the figures—android clones in macabre costumes with disturbingly realistic masks. Their eyes were hidden behind insidious mechanical lenses that flashed with eerie red lights.

“Simon,” I whispered cautiously, the hair on my arms stood on end, “I am actually scared right now.”

Simon’s eyes widened. One of the clones raised a gleaming knife. “This is definitely not the kind of riot I signed up for!”

The figures began to move, their steps deliberate and unnervingly synchronized. The room erupted into chaos. I grabbed Simon and we ducked behind a bar, watching in horror as the clones attacked the unsuspecting guests.

From the scene, one clone grabbed a glamorous drag queen and, with a swift motion, sliced her dress—and her body—in half. My jaw dropped as her blood sprayed across the room, painting the walls in a gruesome shade of red. The room’s grungy decor became a grotesque canvas of blood and gore. Another clone wielded a meat cleaver with disturbingly precise swings, turning a particularly flamboyant guest into a human fountain.

“This is not what I meant by a fabulous evening!” Simon shouted, his voice barely audible over the chaos. “What do we do?”

“We need to get out,” I said, my mind racing. “And we need to find out what’s really going on. But first, we need to avoid becoming the evening’s main course.”

We sprinted through the room, trying to avoid the clones. One particularly enthusiastic clone chased us, its mechanical eyes glowing with sadistic delight. We darted through a series of rooms, each more horrifying than the last. In one room, a poor soul was trapped in a rigged carnival game, their blood pooling around them as the clone methodically operated the game’s twisted mechanisms.

“Do you think this is some sort of sick performance art?” Simon gasped as we rounded another corner.

“If it is, I’d hate to see the reviews,” I said, shoving a nearby table into the path of an approaching clone. It crashed to the floor, giving us a brief respite.

We stumbled into a large, open space that looked like a barbaric execution chamber, a proper red room. The walls were smeared with blood, and the floor was a slick, crimson mess. In the centre, a group of partygoers—including Dolly, Emerald, and Max—were trapped, their expressions a mix of horror and disbelief.

“Help!” Dolly cried out, her voice trembling. “Please, help us!”

Emerald was the first to meet her grisly fate. She tried dancing provocatively to intimidate, her sequined gown shimmering under the lights. One of the clones, wielding a wickedly sharp scythe, swung it through the air, slicing through her gown and into her chest with a sickening crack. Emerald crumpled; her final scream drowned out by the chaotic red noise in the background.

Max, with his larger-than-life personality and neon jumpsuit, tried to fight back, swinging a champagne bottle wildly. The clones descended on him with horrifying precision. One clone grabbed Max and, with a morbid show of strength, twisted his head at an unnatural angle before delivering a final, brutal blow with a metal pipe. Max’s blood splattered on me before he, too, fell to the floor in a twisted heap.

I ran in quickly to grab Dolly, who was clutching her dress and bleeding from a deep cut revealing the inside of her silicone tit. “What’s going on here?” I demanded as we fled.

Dolly’s eyes were filled with tears. “It’s a human hunt! They’ve set this up for rich people to watch. The clones are programmed to kill us all for their amusement. I owe them so much money, and they were forcing me to promote. My kids... my kids will be left with nothing! I didn’t know they were going to kill me, too. I am so sorry,” she bawled. “Emerald and Max were forced by their parents, I don’t know why they’re dead, it’s so gruesome. We tried to get you to leave.”

As Dolly’s confession hung in the air, a group of clones closed in. One of them threw a spike through the air, catching Dolly in the stomach and sending her sprawling. Blood gushed from her wound. “Move forward as far as you can, take the door to the right.”

“No!” Simon shouted, trying to help her move. But a clone’s blade slashed through the air, slicing through the panicked crowd attempting to escape. Dolly’s final scream was cut short as her head was violently severed, her blood spraying across the hallway.

Simon and I were left in a nightmarish tableau of gore. I grabbed Simon, my mind racing for a way out. “Fuck these homicidal, homophobic motherfuckers!”

We dashed through the carnage, making our way to a set of heavy double doors on the right that led to an industrial room. Behind us, the clones were slaughtering the remaining partygoers with disturbing efficiency. I couldn’t believe our luck.

Inside the industrial room, I spotted a large propane tank. “Simon, we’re blowing this place sky-high. Grab anything you can and use it as a weapon, if they come.”

Simon, his eyes still wide with shock, picked up a metal rod. “I’m a power bottom, I’m a power bottom, I’m a power bottom,” he repeated.

“We’re going to set this place off like a Fourth of July fireworks show,” I said. “But first, we need to deal with these… okay, let’s just get going. You prepare the tank, I find safety.”

As Simon prepared the propane tank, I opened the doors to check for a place where we wouldn’t get killed by the explosion. I tried the room next door marked with “VIP,” and to my surprise, it was a men’s bathroom. One of the rich spectators—a particularly fancy man—stood by a urinal, seemingly oblivious to the chaos. I grabbed a nearby pipe and stormed over, smashing it against his back with his hanging dick out. The posh man fell over, pissing on the floor, looking confused as I dragged him out and shoved him against the wall.

“Sorry, darling,” I said, not even bothering to hide the glee in my voice. “But I’m dragging you into this show. Tell me where there’s an escape.”

“I don’t know,” he muttered, but then I squeezed his nuts like a pathetic bag of peanuts. “Upstairs! The VIP section is upstairs, that is the nearest escape from this. But you can’t get there from here; I got lost, okay? Just jump out a window in the bathroom.”

For all the lives lost because of him and his peers, I spat him in the face. Then I shoved him into the path of an approaching clone. The man’s confused scream was cut short as the clone’s blade went through him with a sickening squelch. I quickly ran back to Simon, who was now hastily rigging the propane tank, so that we could throw the lighter and run.

“I have an escape. Are we ready?” I shouted over the sound of screams and mechanical noise.

“Ready!” Simon shouted back, flicking the lighter. The flame danced briefly before he threw it towards the tank.

We ran for our lives across the hallway, and through the bathroom, smashing the tinted windows with our bare hands. The explosion was nothing short of otherworldly. The building erupted in a fireball that sent debris flying in every direction. The flames roared, engulfing everything in a furious blaze. Glitter cannons must have been nearby because silver glitter burst simultaneously, creating a surreal, glittering inferno. The entire venue, rich patrons, clones, and every last remnant of the nightmare was consumed.

Simon and I were thrown clear of the explosion, landing on a nearby beach with the sand and drying blood stinging our skin. We scrambled to our feet, watching the firelight dance across the waves. The once-grand venue was now nothing but a smouldering ruin, its horror buried beneath a sea of ashes and glitter falling slowly from the sky.

Feeling a momentary ecstasy, I took out a cigarette and lit it, using the building. Time for an impromptu smoke break. As we sat on the beach, it started raining down with body parts. I grabbed a severed ass, casually flicking the ashes into the grotesque receptacle.

Simon looked at the flaming wreckage and then at the severed ass. “You’re a real piece of work.”

“Well,” I said with a grin, giving the cheeks a little slap, “now that’s a butt holder.”

I took a long drag of my cigarette, exhaling slowly as the sun glistened over the horizon. “Sometimes, you’ve got to make your mark in the most absurd way possible.”

“Honestly,” Simon added, his voice cracking slightly as he took in the tranquility of the morning, “I think I’m going to need therapy after this.”

I chuckled, feeling the weight of the night's adrenaline fade into a more manageable sense of disbelief. “Oh, come on. We survived a fucking snuff party. I’d say we’ve earned a drink or two. If I ever make it to another underground party, I’ll make sure it’s for brunch.”

Simon looked at me with a weak smile. “Next time, let’s just stick to the basics. Like karaoke or something. No more murder-themed soirees.”

“Deal,” I said, still grinning as I took another drag from my cigarette. “But if someone invites us to a glitter rave, I’m definitely saying no. I can’t believe they would… they really tried to kill us. All those people are dead. They were *party-goers.* Dead for what?”

“Not for the party,” Simon spoke in a soft voice, sadness washing over his face. “You know why.”

As the early morning light danced on the ocean, we both fell into a strange silence, the trauma of the night melding into the absurdity of the situation. Amidst glitter and gore, we had survived.

Simon’s phone buzzed, breaking the silence. He glanced at it, then at me, and let out a small, nervous laugh. “It’s Dolly’s ex. Seems like he heard about what happened and wants to know if we’re okay.”

I snorted. “Tell him we’re doing just fine and enjoying a beachside view of the apocalypse.”

Simon shook his head, smiling despite the fatigue in his eyes.

The sun blazed in the sky, the beach a serene safe haven, already hot. I basked in the warmth on my blood-covered body and listened as Simon put on “Carnage” by Jazmin Bean and Lucy Loone on his phone. I reached out for his hand and grabbed it tight. Now, I may never go to an underground drag party with him ever again, unprepared.
