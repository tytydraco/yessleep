Elizabeth loves her dog, she would do anything for him really. They did almost everything together except eat, dogs are meant to eat on the floor obviously. One thing she loved most about her dog is that it speaks, for example when she was about to go out her dog will ask if she could stay. She would have to tell him things like “Sit boy, be good for me okay?” or “I’ll be back soon, I wont be out for too long” sometimes a pat on the head will do good for him. Other times her dog will whisper at night to her while she tried to sleep.

 

He would often say things like “I will be here,” or “I’m watching you” or sometimes he’ll whisper “hide.” It’s very rare when he tell her to  hide, though she knows it’s just to protect her. She tried to tell people that her dog has such a wonderful talent for speaking but no one believed her, when she told them he can speak they think he barks. Her dog doesn’t bark. Elizabeth loves that about her dog, she think it makes him super unique, sometimes people will want to meet her dog, though they’re not friends. These people who try to visit her dog are men in suits, and when they come over her dog pretends he is unable to speak. He is not very fond of strangers, and really he only loves Elizabeth. Sometimes her dog will go out in the middle of the night and wont usually come back until a few days later, She would ask where he would go but he would never answer her questions, at some point she just stopped asking. Though her dog started acting quite different in the recent weeks, this is because one night he came home early from his trip outside, and he usually will stay out for a few days but tonight was different. He crawled through the doggy door and he sat next to her.

 

He was very quiet up until he got up and stood in front of Elizabeths bed.

 

“Andy?” But he didn’t respond his usual response, which would be his whispering. Instead he growled and his bones sounded as though they were cracking, and he started to grow bigger and bigger. He ripped out of this skin of a husky and morphed into a hairless, black monster that reeked of old blood.

 

“How long will you keep this up, your time is near…” It growled very quietly.

 

“Just a little longer, I can’t let him go yet.” She cried softly, it’s growling became louder and it was clearly growing impatient with Elizabeth.

 

“I should rip your throat out tonight, people are beginning to notice, the church has been here too often,” it inhaled deeply and whispered, “They know…”

 

“I can protect you! I just need more time with Andy.” She begged the monster.

 

“Andy is dead, I’ve killed your husband and his mistress and I agreed to be here for 5 years,” it inhaled, raised two fingers and continued to speak, “Your time is nearing, you have 2 weeks left.” It licked it’s lips and began salivating a black oozing liquid, “Mark my words Elizabeth, I will devour your flesh and it will be painful, I will not show mercy.” It growled an inhumane growl, before opening the door and leaving Elizabeth to her own thoughts. A few days later Andy returned as its usual self and she cherished every moment with him. After the remaining two weeks, Elizabeth and her dog had disappeared, and I found her Journal under the floorboards. In her Journal she wrote the steps down on how to summon the demon she had bargained with, Balaam. Elizabeth was my sister and I am not ready to let her go.
