[There’s a lot of things we don’t talk about back home.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/157zyvq/how_to_survive_college_maria_isnt_allowed_to_make/)  Everyone knows what’s going on, of course.  It’s a small town.  Everyone is up in each other’s business because we’re all bored and there’s nothing better to do.  We don’t say that, because that’s rude - at least, we don’t say it directly to anyone’s face.  But people gossip and stories get spread and it’s all inconsequential or outright lies because for some topics, we don’t want to discuss it out in the open.

It’s like the stories.  Saying something out-loud gives it strength.  Makes it real.  Maybe they believe that or maybe they’re just scared.

We all slept safe in our homes and looked the other way while Kate was out there dealing with those creatures.  We all knew.  We just didn’t say anything about it, whether because of fear or taboo or culpability.  I think at some point that silence started to leak into other things as well.  When my father vanished they said that he’d abandoned us even though they all knew what had happened.  That people vanish.  That things take them in the night and they’re never seen again.  I think the lies and the silence staves off the fear.  It’s a rot in my hometown.  An infection.  It’s one of the reasons I don’t want to go back there.

But I’m also a product of that place.

I’m not trying to make excuses.  I just want to explain.

Sometimes I wonder if they know that my ex-boyfriend is dead.  If they know some ancient thing came through and took him, but they say otherwise, because it’s one of those things that we don’t talk about.  It’s easier to blame something - or someone - else.

I wish they’d be honest with me.

I wish it wasn’t so… habitual to do the same thing to someone else.

I didn’t say any of this to Cassie.  Your comments made me rethink that.  Explanations just feel like excuses, sometimes.  I told her I was sorry instead, that I shouldn’t have kept the fact her roommate died to myself.  I said that… I knew hearing it was going to open an old wound, and I didn’t want to be the one to do that.  That I didn’t want her to hurt but more so, selfishly, I didn’t want to be the one to hurt her.

She was really quiet and then told me she’d appreciate it if I gave her some time to think about all of this.

I’ve banished myself from the dorm to give her space.  I’m spending a lot of time with Maria and Grayson.  Maria is fine, by the way.  Her misadventure in the steam tunnels has seemingly had no lasting ill effects and also, she hasn’t been going outside when it’s raining.  Not that it’s rained much since my last post.  It’s been quite dry recently, which is a very welcome change.  I haven’t had to deal with the flickering man.  Nothing weird crawling out of the steam tunnels.  No more weighing my personal safety against my grades.  (I’ll be real with y'all, my grades have been winning, I haven’t told you even like half the times I’ve gone out in the rain)

I’ve also been taking advantage of the weather and going on walks around campus. I just need some space to think.

Unfortunately, thinking while walking is apparently just the right combination I need to summon everyone’s favorite tutor.  That’s right.  One moment I was walking along, brooding, the next minute there was the devil with his suspenders and smug smile plastered on his face walking alongside me.

“Really?” I grumbled.  “I don’t even want to see you right now.”

“But I’m supposed to be here!”

“No you’re not.  The campus doesn’t want you here.  I didn’t call you.  You don’t have a reason to be here.”

He huffed and began rummaging in… thin air, actually.

“I actually do.  Hang on, it’s in the handbook.”

And he literally pulled out a notebook from… somewhere… and started flipping through it.

“Ah yes,” he continued, “here it is.  The helper character shows up at pivotal moments when the protagonist is going through some kind of external or internal struggle and a growth moment is at hand.”

“I thought I wasn’t the protagonist.  Haven’t you been telling me that I don’t matter as much as I think I do?”

He threw the notebook over his shoulder.  I have no idea where it landed.

“That was… not quite the lesson I wanted you to get from that,” he sighed.  “Whatever.  You’re in some kind of turmoil and that is a siren call to creatures like me, so here I am.”

“Either that or you’re here to start some shit,” I grumbled.

“Precisely!  Could go either way.  I love my job.”

We walked for a few more paces in silence.

“Soooo,” he finally prodded, leaning in close to my face.  “What’s on your mind?”

I asked if I was a bad person.  Yes, I see the irony in asking the devil that, but ALSO I figured if anyone would know the answer, it’d be him.  I didn’t actually get a straight answer, though.  Instead, he pinched his nose and sighed dramatically.

“Okay you know enough about stories and rules to understand that is a complicated question,” he said, “and depends dramatically on where you’re from and where you’re currently located.  But if we ignore all those systems of morality and evaluate you on the scale I think matters the most to you - are you the kind of person that people will like? - then I think no, you’re not a bad person.  You’re making the stupid mistakes you make when suddenly you’re old enough for there to be consequences but you’re still too young to know how to avoid those mistakes.  But if you need more objective evidence of what kind of person you are, the campus Folklore Society appears to be making a field trip to the graveyard.”

Startled, I glanced up.  We were by the graveyard and it was Sunday and that meant it was open for visiting hours and just as the devil had said, there was a small group of students heading through the open gates.

“Oh no,” I whispered.  “No no no no.”

“Guess you gotta go after them,” the devil helpfully suggested.  “If you’re a good person, that is.”

“This is why you’re here!” I snapped.  “You planned this!”

“Sure did!  Shenanigans and moral support!  I’m really nailing it today.”

I didn’t stick around to listen to him congratulate himself.  I get the feeling that once he gets started, he could go on all day.  Tricksters are like that, you know.

The Folklore Society were well past the gates by the time I reached the graveyard.  I hesitated for just a moment at the entrance.  I hadn’t been back since Steven died.  I swore I wouldn’t go back, that there was nothing good there, and not even the allure of the petrified wood was worth the danger.  I teetered at the edge, my feet already sinking into the mire of indecision.  I couldn’t stay here for much longer, or I’d sink entirely and then I’d be useless to everyone.  I screamed at myself in the back of my head, to GO, to DO SOMETHING, and then spurred on by my own admonishments, I took that step through the gate.

And like that, the paralysis of my own fear was broken.  I was moving.  I was going forward.  I couldn’t stop now.

I was inside the graveyard.  I didn’t look around.  I just went straight towards the small group of students winding their way between the headstones.  It was already close to the end of visiting hours.  The group showing up with roughly twenty minutes to spare had to be deliberate.  They intended to stay beyond the gates closing, which meant they were risking the anger of the groundskeeper.  I had to get them out of there before they encountered him.

“Hey!” I called, trotting up to them and plastering a smile on my face that I hoped didn’t look panicked and forced.  I don’t think I succeeded, because they gave me that look you give someone when they’ve inserted them into a conversation that you’d really rather not have interrupted.

“Do we know you?” one of them asked pointedly.

Ah yes.  Very subtle hint for me to fuck right off.  But unfortunately for them, I am no stranger to awkwardness.  My social interactions are nothing *but* awkwardness.  I was not going to be deterred by the faint hint of public embarrassment.  I am embarrassment incarnate.  Cringe is in my blood.

“No,” I said.  “But I know you’re about to stay past the end of visiting hours and you’re members of the Folklore Society, and as such, should know that bad things happen to people who trespass.”

That made them eye each other nervously.  It didn’t get much more ominous than standing in a graveyard with a stranger who knows exactly who they are bearing dire tidings.  I kind of wished I’d had the presence of mind to ask the devil for individual names.  That would have really spooked them.  But unfortunately, my advantage only lasted for a moment.  More plausible explanations for what was happening asserted themselves.

“Sure, bad things happen,” one of them said with a roll of his eyes.  “Like we get informed visiting hours are over and asked to leave.  C’mon.  We’re going to find the tree.  You… do know about the tree, right?”

And I swear he smirked a little when he said this.  I scowled.  Great, they had a skeptic among them.  And worse, he seemed to have the most influence in the group.  The others were clearly listening to him.

I let them turn away and start walking deeper into the graveyard.  They got a few paces before I spoke up again.  Appealing to reason wasn’t going to work here.  I needed to connect with that primal, instinctive fear that knows the stories are also *warnings*, because that instinct would be what could save them.

“I know about the groundskeeper,” I said quietly.  “You do know about him… and what he can do, right?”

A few glanced back.  There was a bit of whispering among them and I strained to overhear.  I only caught snippets, but it sounded like whoever had told them about the visiting hours hadn’t said anything about the groundskeeper.  I suddenly, desperately, wanted to know who told them how to get into the graveyard (and maybe send Maria around to yell at them, she’s better at that than I am) but I had more pressing concerns, so I shoved it into the back of my head for later.

We were running out of time.  I think the Folklore Society realized that too, because their leader(?) shot me an annoyed glance and kept walking.  He wasn’t going to spare any more time on my crazed rantings.  I sucked in air between my teeth and thought that maybe it was time to change tactics.  If I couldn’t talk them into turning around, then maybe I could get them to see what they were after and leave - quickly.  I briskly walked past them (the nice thing of having worked on the campground is I did a lot of walking and walk a lot faster than most people now) and took the lead.

“The tree is this way,” I said.  “I’ve already seen it.  Let’s take a look and then get out of here.  I’m warning you though - you’re going to be disappointed.”

It was only a stump, after all.

I led them through the winding paths of the graveyard, my heart pounding with urgency.  I didn’t want to look at my phone to see how much time we had left.  My mind was entirely focused on remembering which way the tree stump was.  There was a crypt? thing? nearby, I remembered that much.  It wasn’t that big, but it stood out among all the other headstones around it, and once I found that landmark it was easy to find the tree.

Especially since it was no longer a stump.

It was a tree.  A massive tree that was swallowing up the graves closest to it, enveloping the headstones in its trunk, its roots digging through the soil in thick cables.  It stood taller than all the other trees in the graveyard, its bare branches stretching out their brittle limbs like grasping fingers.  I stared at it in disbelief.  How was this not visible outside of the graveyard?  Unease churned in my stomach and the hair on the back of my neck prickled.  There was something not quite right with this tree.

I have only been in the gray world once, with the laundry lady, when she showed me the remains of her realm.  There was a strange feeling while I was there, like being halfway between sleep and awake and knowing that you’re hovering between two states, not yet firmly entrenched in either place.  A sensation of not belonging anywhere at all.

This is what it felt like, staring up at the massive tree.

“I don’t know, that’s pretty impressive,” one of the Folklore Society members said.

“It… wasn’t this big when I saw it last,” I said weakly.

I covertly checked my phone.  Five minutes past visiting hours.  The tree was only visible outside of the times people were allowed inside.  It could only be seen when trespassing.

And we were certainly trespassing.

The other students clustered around the tree while I anxiously scanned the graveyard.  Maybe if we just… avoided the groundskeeper it would be okay.  We could get out of here still.  I was so focused on watching for someone approaching along the paths that I almost missed it.  There was a bulge in the soil, near one of the exposed roots of the tree.  I didn’t notice it at first and it only caught my attention because it was moving.  Even then, I almost dismissed it from my mind, with as focused on keeping watch for the groundskeeper as I was.

But it kept moving.  Pulsing upwards, like the beat of a heart.

And then something broke free from beneath the earth.  It erupted from the soil, the earth falling away like the ocean crashing against the cliffside.  It straightened, raised its head, and stared at us.

All of us, trespassing in the cemetery.

The groundskeeper was here.  It was coming for us.

“We gotta go,” I said urgently, yanking on the arm of the student nearest to me.

She tried to shake me off, but as she did, she glanced in my direction.  I guess she saw the utter panic in my face, because it made her pause.  Then she saw beyond me, towards the groundskeeper, still dripping with soil and standing in the ruin of the earth he’d emerged from.  Her brow pinched in sudden confusion.

“WE GOTTA GO!” I bellowed, shoving at her.

It didn’t matter where she went.  Just so long as she *moved* in a direction that was vaguely away from the groundskeeper.  She stumbled a few steps, tapping a nearby friend and pointing at the groundskeeper.  She said something and honestly I wasn’t listening, I was in full-fledged panic mode at this point, but I think it was along the lines of ‘where did he come from’ which really isn’t helpful, that’s the sort of wasteful speculation that I don’t know, gets you *killed* around inhuman things.

Then their leader, a very practical person I’m sure who reasons things through which works great when you’re not dealing with the inhuman, sighed and took the lead.  He began walking towards the groundskeeper.

Just like Steven had done.  Because you can reason with people and the groundskeeper looks like a person.

I felt sick.  I wanted to run off somewhere and throw up from fear.  I knew what was going to happen next and I didn’t want to see it but I didn’t know how to stop it.  Could I grab him and pull him back?  Was I strong enough or would the scuffle just give the groundskeeper enough time to close in on us?  He was slow, but he was coming our direction with all the determination of a landslide that had already been set on its course.

“Did… did he come out of the ground?” someone asked.

That’s right.  It was right there, plain to see.  They just needed convincing.  I glanced at the shallow hole the groundskeeper had climbed out of and then I saw it.  I crouched, my shaking fingers closed over something, and I rose.

I threw a rock at the groundskeeper.  Just an ordinary rock.  I think.  I didn’t look at it too hard.  I just grabbed and threw.

It hit him on the face.

I wish I could claim that was intentional but no, I was too panicked to aim, and it was sheer dumb luck.  But the rock hit his cheek and… bounced off.  There was a sharp sound of impact, of two stones striking each other, and it careened aside and landed on the ground at the groundskeeper's feet.  There was a faint mark where the stone had hit.  A tiny chip.  Not a cut.  Not a bruise.  A chip.

Like he was made of stone.

Then the groundskeeper slowly lifted one foot, set it back down on the stone I’d thrown, and casually ground it into dust.  Like extinguishing a cigarette.

One of the students behind me screamed and I gotta tell you, I’ve never been so relieved in my life to hear that sound.  Finally.  They got it.  They were properly scared *as they should be*.

I didn’t even need to tell them to run.  In fact, this time one of them grabbed me and dragged me along with them.  I glanced over long enough to realize it was their leader, the same dumbass that thought that nothing bad was going to happen, that was planning on talking to the groundskeeper.  His hand was clenched on my arm and he was pulling me along, pulling me out of my paralyzing fear and forcing me to feel my legs, to use them, to run.

“We can jump the fence!” he yelled at the others.  “Nate, you’re the tallest, you help everyone over and then get over yourself.”

Oh good.  Someone that can not only change their mind when they’re wrong, but can also strategize in a bad situation.  The groundskeeper was between us and the gate and he wasn’t going to even attempt doubling back, not after what we’d just seen.  What a refreshing change this is.

We hit the fence and Nate stooped, linking his hands together to boost the first person up and over.  He threw the second person over.  One of the girls with us was crying.  My mouth was dry and my heart was pounding and I stood next to their leader, anxiously scanning the graveyard.  The groundskeeper was coming.  I could see him.  I could feel the earth trembling under the weight of his steps.

“A-at least he’s kind of slow,” the leader stammered.  “C’mon, it’s your turn, get over the fence.”

He shoved me towards Nate.  I stepped up into his linked hands, he threw me up, I grabbed hold of the top of the fence and then I was tumbling over.  Then the leader was climbing over and that just left Nate.  And like he’d said, Nate was tall enough to jump, grab hold of the top, and then we were reaching up to help pull him up and over.

We’d made it.  We were out of the graveyard.

“Let’s go,” I said anxiously.  “Let’s get far away from here.”

But they were clustered in a nervous knot, watching the groundskeeper approach.  He was still coming.  I guess with the fence between us and them and with the adrenaline flowing in their veins they felt brave enough to observe our pursuer.  They watched as he got closer and closer, his lurching, pained steps slowly dragging his body across the yards separating us.

“I don’t believe this,” someone near me whispered.  “Is he really made of stone?”

The groundskeeper was on the other side of the fence.  We stared at each other.  Up close, he looked just like an old man with weathered, severe features.  The chip out of his cheek, however, told a different story.  It was small but deep, deep enough that it should be bleeding.  Yet there was no blood, no change in coloration.  Like he was a statue put together from different pieces of colored stone.

“Uh, sir,” their leader began.  “We were just wondering-”

And the groundskeeper stared him dead in the eyes, raised a hand, and grabbed hold of one of the iron bars of the fence and ripped it clean off.

So yeah, that set off a bunch of screaming and running for our lives.  This time, no one stopped until the graveyard was well out of sight.

But that was it.  That was as far as the groundskeeper pursued us.  At some point we all stopped running and the Folklore Society started to regroup to figure out what the hell had just happened.  And of course they had questions for me.  They started peppering in, starting with ‘who are you’ and ‘how did you know about the groundskeeper’ and folks, I was not in the mood for it.  I don’t want anything to do with them.  At least their leader this year seems to get how dangerous it is, now that he’s been forcibly dragged out of his initial skepticism.  That was good enough for me.

“You know what?” I finally snapped.  “You should go camping if you want to do something exciting.  There’s this place I know that’s *perfect* for people like you.”

Then I stormed off, leaving them to wonder why telling someone to go camping sounded so much like a *threat*.

There’s one more thing I need to tell all of you.

I asked Grayson if he’d ever been in the graveyard.  He shrugged nonchalantly and said he’d been there plenty of times.  He’d grown up in the area, after all.  Then his expression sharpened.

“Is this about your friend that died?” he asked.

I swallowed hard.  No, it wasn’t.  Not this time.  I asked him if he’d ever seen a tree in the middle of the graveyard, a tree that was only there when people weren’t.

“I know about the tree,” he said, his voice soft and haunted.

He knew the tree very well.  I heard it in his voice, saw it in the fearful look in his eyes.  He’s been to the tree and there is something horribly wrong with it.

“You don’t have to tell me anything else if you don’t want to,” I said.  “But I’d really appreciate knowing.  I think it could be important.”

He stared down at his hands, linking his fingers together.  His knuckles were white with strain.

“I think… the tree.  I think it wants to consume me.  I can feel it if I get too close.  Like it will drink me up and leave nothing behind.”

I think I know what’s happened to his dad.  The tree is a curse on Grayson’s family.  It’s taking his dad and when his dad is all gone, when mind and body has failed and there is nothing left to drink up… then Grayson will be next.[\[x\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/goatvalleycampgrounds/)
