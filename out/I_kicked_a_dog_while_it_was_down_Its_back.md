I didn’t have a happy childhood. I bounced around between my separated parent’s shitty council flats, random peoples houses if we were homeless for a while and foster care. Moving all the time meant I never had much to carry with me. But I did have a dog. Her name was Stella, (like the beer, wasn’t my choice) and she went wherever I did. She followed me from room to room, council flat to council flat, town to town. Of course I couldn't bring Stella into foster care with me but she would always be there when I got out. And my parents would bring her to visit me if the contact centre was pet friendly. 



I should’ve been nicer to Stella. I regret that now. With the pets I’ve had since I’ve been gentle, kind and a good companion. I’ve told myself for years that Stella had to have forgiven me. I was only ten at the time and mentally twisted from everything I’d witnessed. Leaving me with a pet to care for pretty much from both was a mistake my parents made, not me. And anyway I’m a different person now. I used to imagine that Stella and I would meet in heaven one day and she’d bound over to me licking my face like she used to, and we’d live happily ever after. I liked to think of her watching over me as I got better. And in spirit warding off weirdos and protecting me. 



She always protected me no matter how much danger and pain it put her in. When I was a baby she’d sleep under my crib and growl at my father whenever he came in the room. She saved me and mothers lives several times. I often say my mother is the strongest woman I know and my inspiration. But that’s a lie to boost my mothers slow self esteem. It’s Stella who inspires me. But I can’t talk about a dog in my graduation speech. 



I hadn’t thought about Stella in a long time until the other day when I was moving the last of my stuff out of my mothers house. 

“Aw look Mum.” I said lifting up the picture to show her. It was me and Stella when I was a toddler and she was a puppy, cuddled on the sofa under my blanky. 

She took the picture from me and looked over it, a solemn smile spreading across her pale pink lips and making little wrinkles on either side of her mouth. I am continually shocked by my mother's aging. I don’t know what to do with it. I don’t have a grandmother and my mother was nineteen when she had me. Seeing her in her forties feels wrong. In my head she’ll always be in her mid twenties with pencil thin 2000’s eyebrows, blue sparkly eyeshadow, low rise blue jeans and big silver hoop earrings. I know how ridiculous it must seem to be talking about my mum aging when she’s only 40 something. But women don’t tend to last long in my family. And it truly is strange to me to watch her age.



“Poor Stella.” My Mum shook her head, tutting. Then she looked up at me. “Do you want this? I have a frame you can have somewhere.”

“Is it a tacky glittery silver one?” I asked knowing my mother has the typical taste of a woman her age. 

“No! It’s a nice boring oldy worldy one.” 



I don’t tend to have photos framed around me. I feel like people are watching me. Also my childhood pictures are usually just reminders of something awful. The background always ruins whatever is happening even if it’s a good memory. What annoys me most about them is that awful council flat flooring that's dark brown and bespeckled. I hate that shit. It makes every picture of me sitting on the floor look scummy. I remember always being freezing cold as well no matter the weather. So whenever I see it I feel cold all over and get goosebumps. I think of taking showers in cold water and being forbidden from turning the heating on. 



Secretly, I also don’t want people to come over and see pictures of me as a child in these situations. I’ve built a nice life for myself and I don’t want my past getting its grubby paws over my success. Like I said, I'm a different person now. 



But I brought the picture of Stella home with me. I figured it would be harmless enough in my bedroom which only me and my closest friends would go into. I placed it on my bedside table pleased to have my canine guardian angel watching over me. I kissed my hand and pressed it to the photo that night before I climbed into bed and went to sleep. 



Then I saw her in my nightmares. 



Dreaming, I found myself in an endless expanse of concrete council flats that were far bigger and taller than they ever were in real life. I wasn’t a stranger to this dreamscape. In fact I visit it often. But I’m always alone. I walk and walk but the estate never comes to an end. My mother has dreams of this place too but she usually has me with her and she’s trying to run away. I’m always alone. And although I am often running around I’m not afraid. I wander around looking at the impossible brutalist architecture and wait until I wake up. 



In my dreamscape that night I was meandering across a concrete bridge. This bridge now only exists in my mind and has been knocked down in the real world. But in my dreams I can touch it again. I rested my hand on the ledge, feeling the rough pebble dash of the bridge and looked down at the road below. There weren’t any cars. There never are. 



As I stared out at the endless road, looking at the little white lines getting smaller and smaller until they disappeared into the foggy horizon, I thought I heard something. A low rumble. A growl. I turned to my left to see my old dog. My Stella! But something was wrong. She didn’t look right. She was thin and ragged with patches of fur missing. Her mouth was snarling and angry as she dribbled on the floor. Her jaw was bigger and broader than I remember. I didn’t realise a dog could scowl with bared teeth like that. The expression felt too human, especially the eyes. She looked up at me, growling viciously. My first instinct was to look behind me to see if she was growling at someone else. But no, she was growling at me. Glaring at me. She smelled like rot. Like decay. And the iron rich scent of fresh blood. 



Slowly, I moved to approach her, to let her know everything was okay. But I don’t think dogs understand apologies. Or maybe they do. But my apology just wasn’t good enough. Gently, I crouched down and put my hand out for her to sniff. Maybe after all this time she didn’t recognise me and just needed to recognise my smell. 



Cautiously, she took a step toward me, still snarling. There was a second where I hoped she’d sniff me, realise who I was and come give me a hug. Instead, in one shockingly swift movement, she pounced on me. With a sickening crunch, she latched her big staffordshire bullterrier jaw on my hand. The bite sent an agonising pain through my nervous system and shocked me awake.  



I bolted upright with a scream. My eyes frantically scanned my room as they adjusted to the dark. The room was the same as it always was, my wardrobe, my desk, my window. Then noticing something from the corner of my eye, my gaze went back to the wardrobe. I saw something moving glowing in the dark. Breathing. 



Staring at me from the corner of my room was Stella. Her silhouette was barely visible in the dark, shrouded by my wardrobe's shadow. But I knew it was her. She was growling in a low eerie hum. Her reddened eyes were fixed on me, glaring. My eyes were focussed on her teeth bright white which shone in the moonlight. They were longer and pointier than I remembered. I swear her jaw was never that big. As I stared at it in disbelief, suddenly her mouth began to warp from a snarl to a wide grin which made my stomach churn. 



Suddenly, the light flicked on and Stella disappeared. 



“What happened?” My roommate Amy asked looking around my room for an intruder. She had her emergency bat with a sock on it in one hand and a hammer in the other. 

“Worst night terror of my life!” I wept, wiping my teary eyes with the back of my hand. My entire body was trembling as I pulled the duvet back over myself. 

“What the hell happened to your hand?” Amy gently took a hold of it and held it under the light. I had a big bite mark. The wet blood of the wound glistened in the light. 

“Oh god.” I mumbled, trying to think of a way to explain myself. I decided to be honest with Amy. She believes in this sort of thing. Ghosts and ghouls and what have you. When I told her about my nightmare and what I saw in the corner of my room she nodded understandingly.

“I have to ask.” She said solemnly. “What did you do to that dog?” She asked, taking a seat on the bed next to me. 

“I-” I swallowed, choking on a sob. “I kicked her.” I admitted. 

“You kicked her?” She raised an eyebrow. 

“I was- I didn’t mean for her to die!” I cried as Amy pulled me into her arms. She let me cry for a moment before she asked hesitantly: 

“Listen, I won’t judge you if this is the case because I know you weren’t well for a long time. But did you kick the dog to death?” She rushed through the last question and watched tensely for my reaction. 

“No! No. I- Well- Stella and I would get locked inside the house for hours at a time and one time she peed on the carpet… When my dad got home he went ballistic and beat the hell out of both of us.” I took a deep breath before I told her the next part. “When he was done, the two of us were left alone in my bedroom. I was so angry at her for getting us beaten that I kicked her and called her names. Instinctively, still in defense mode after her tussle with my dad, she bit me. So I screamed. My dad came running in. I don't really remember the next part but one thing led to another and she got taken into a shelter. She got put down…because of me.”



Amy tried her best to convince me it wasn’t my fault. But I didn’t believe her. How could I? Stella was still angry at me. She went after me, not my father who is very much alive, somewhere in the world, at least I think so. So clearly Stella blames me. And why shouldn’t she? 



She visits me all the time now. I see her in the dark corners of my room as well as my mind. She growls at me without being seen when I’m home alone. And she brings dead things to my doorstep. In short, she haunts me. And no amount of Amy’s sage or seances will get Stella to forgive me and leave me alone. Sometimes when I’m walking home alone at night I see her dipping in and out behind peoples bins and down alleyways. She follows me everywhere. She follows me around like a lost puppy. And then goes for me like something feral and rabid. It’s strange to think she is very much both of those things at the same time. 



I see her now as I finish typing this out. She’s at the end of the garden, grinning fiendishly at me, waiting for me to go to sleep so she can get me in my nightmares. But as I look more closely at her, I think I see something else. A shadow behind her. It’s the shape of a human. And I swear that before she started growling this time, I heard the rattle of a chain. My father always kept Stella on a big bulky choke chain.
