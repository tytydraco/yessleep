Desperation: It can turn you into an idiot who can't see danger if it bit him in the ass if you aren't paying attention. 



Long story short I lost my job because of a boneheaded misstate I made on the job. At first, I sat in my house and felt bad for myself. After seeing how quickly my bank account was running low I knew I needed money fast. So, I did odd jobs. A way I found surprising to make money was through focus groups or surveys. Typically very minimal work for the amount of money they give you, usually the catch is you have to fit into a specific demographic. I got really good at finding the right groups and surviving off of it. 



I know other people are well-versed in the focus group world. They know all the tips and tricks and make good money. But please, *please.* Take my advice, see my warning. If you see the ad for the last focus group I went to…RUN!



Below is what was transcribed from the official ad I saw. I still have the screenshots but felt the transcription might work better in this format. The ad was only up for a few minutes so you probably won’t have luck finding the ad for yourself, and if you do ever see it for yourself, pretend like you didn’t.

I know what you are probably thinking… I would have to be an idiot to apply for something like that. Well, call me a moron, because I reached out for more information. At first, it was more out of curiosity than thinking I would want to be part of the group.  



I was hoping for more insight into the group but was only given the amount of money for participating and the address. Normally I would have been annoyed with them for still not giving me the name of the company or other important info, however, they said they would pay me $10,000 for my attendance. All logic was out the window at that point, I was already thinking about the steak dinner I was going to buy myself after it was all said and done. 



I signed a document and was told the focus group would start in three hours and to find them in the large warehouse off of Willow Street. A few things surprised me by this. First, it was starting soon but also I had no clue what they meant by *‘off of Willow Street’* How on earth was I supposed to find that? 



I asked for some more clarification and was told to get to Washington Street, drive west for two miles and I would see Willow Street to the left.  



"Washington Street? The one five minutes from my house?" I mumbled to myself.



Every thought in my head was swirling. I kept thinking of all the things that might happen and almost didn't go. Then I checked my bank account and remembered I didn't have an option. 



It was already pretty late at night when I got into my car. Around 9pm. I didn't know how long they would keep me, but I figured it would be overnight or at least a few hours. As I drove I ate a leftover burrito from the night before, hoping it would be enough to hold me over until I was done. 



Doubt infiltrated my thoughts as I got closer. What's going to happen when I drive all the way down Washington and I never see a Willow street? Then from out of nowhere, there it was. Willow Street. Just like they said. 



The green road sign looked like it was staring back at me. Begging me to turn back. Was the color of the green just slightly off? Was the font a little weird? I grabbed my steering wheel and turned onto Willow Street. I looked in awe out the window at the brand-new road that was under my car. What was a field of grass yesterday when I drove by, was now a paved road.



After driving down Willow Street for about three miles, I saw a massive warehouse. Had this been hiding in a field all these years? As I slowly drove closer, I noticed the parking lot was empty. Hundreds of parking spots for me to choose from. I picked what felt like a good spot and noticed I was right on time. 



I stood up from out of my car and just listened with the door open. I knew this was my true last change. Part of me was hoping to hear some awful sound coming from the big gray building to scare me off, but all I heard was wind softly making its way through the nearby trees. 



“I need this money, I need this money!” I said to myself as I slammed my car door, hearing the sound echo off the warehouse. Each step I took toward the door felt harder and harder. I remember looking at the dim light poles as I walked to the door. I knocked on the loud metal door and then well, that's when everything got blurry. 



Three months… They kept me and several others for three months. My memories now are hazy. Almost like I am remembering some kind of fever dream. I've done my best to try and piece some things together, but they always end up not making any sense. I remember a huge room made of concrete with some kind of round table in the middle of it. The room was cold and gave me the opposite feeling of claustrophobia. So much room left empty and void. I believe there were five other people participating in the group, however, I can only vaguely recall two of them. The others are just a blurry shadow in my mind.  



The only memories of the focus group took place in that room, forgive me if my recollection from this point on doesn't make much sense. 



I remember wearing a blindfold while someone touched my fingers. I had to count each finger that was being touched until I got the ‘right’ number. I had a breakdown when I kept counting only eight fingers over and over again. We were asked to name every single object in our childhood bedrooms down to the last Hot Wheel, I think this one made someone vomit for some reason. I remember all the lights being off and hearing a distant giggle. We were asked ‘Is that him?’ 

We were asked questions like ‘If you robbed a bank how would you get away with it?’ or ‘If you were to kill another member of this focus group how would you get away with it?’ They made us explain plans in extreme detail until they believed it was the right answer. 



These memories did not happen one after the other, almost like they all happened at the same time? Maybe that's just how my mind is showing it to me. 



Something else I'm having a hard time putting into words is who *they* were. Sure, I never figured out the name of the company, or at the very least I just forgot the name. What I mean is I can't remember who was running the focus group. I know I was in a room with some other people and I kept doing weird crap. But the thing is, I don't know why I was doing any of it. There were no tall men in lab coats writing on clipboards. No voice over a loud intercom. Just me and a few other poor souls in desperate need of money. Did I forget their faces or was it something else entirely? And why did no one ever ask to leave? At no moment did I ever think to leave? 



Unfortunately for me, the nightmare didn't end when the focus group did. 



My long-term memory started to form again when I was driving home from the focus group. I can recall suddenly snapping back into reality and then fading back into blackness a couple times on the short drive. All of a sudden I found myself in my bedroom. Sitting on my bed staring at the corner. It was at that moment I felt my phone in my pocket. I believe I had my phone the whole time but can't remember ever looking at it. 



I was expecting calls or texts from friends and family worried about my location but it looked like either I texted them all or someone else did. Letting them all know I was 'safe'.



I got back from the focus group around five months ago. The money I got has been extremely helpful but I soon learned it wasn’t worth it. 



The side effects from the focus group have made most days unbearable. I have a terrible fear of leaving my house because every time I come back and see my front door, I get an awful sinking feeling and break down. They said the memory of the third arm was a false memory, but I have a massive scar to prove it. Every day I have to be sure I am somewhere safe at 4:42pm on the dot. I don’t get scared and feel the need to scream, it’s more like an uncontrollable urge that can’t be stopped. Jefferson has stopped by my house many times selling his newspapers as it’s been a very rainy season. Not just requesting money, but objects from my house such as a red sock and a dead moth from the closet. Once he even made me jump rope in the rain for thirty minutes. I know I could just say no but I really don’t want to know what happens if I tell him no. I couldn’t sleep until I had two scarecrows in my room, and feel the need to hide from someone or something at random times of the day in my house or when I'm out.  



This focus group reunited my life. I can only hope these side effects wear off but I feel they are only getting worse. It feels like something left with me from the awful facility. I tried to go back to the building after gaining some courage, but the road and the building were both gone. They paid me in cash so I can’t trace them back that way. I have no way of finding the other participants as I only can remember the first name of one person. Peter. Which is also my name believe it or not. I know I signed an NDA, but what damage could I possibly do without even the name of the company? Plus, if I got sued I would get the name of the company. I probably couldn’t sue them for anything considering I signed that damn contract, but in my mind, I feel like it would help me somehow. 



I am posting this for two main reasons: the first reason is to see if I can find any more information about this company with your help or maybe find someone else who went through it. Most importantly, I felt like I had to warn you all. No amount of money is worth the suffering these people caused me. 



Remember to be careful when going to focus groups. Please.
