The story I'm about to tell you happened back in '96. Like 1996. I was 12 then. A young, carefree kid in middle school. I lived in a small town in New Jersey, where nothing really went on. Come to think of it, the town wasn't really known for anything at all. It was just a small suburb, wedged between Wyckoff and Ridgewood. 

It was a cold January, and I had friends over: Andy and Klara. They had been my friends since childhood. We bonded pretty quick, since we were the only Asian kids in the town. We were playing with the PlayStation, which mind you was pretty popular at the time, when my older sister Jane walked into the room with her boyfriend Lewis. 

"Mom said you couldn't play video games after 10!" Jane yelled at me. Lewis was trying not to laugh.

"Well Mom is away on a trip," I said, which was true. My parents were away on a business trip.

"Well Mom and Dad left me in charge, and I demand you turn that off," Jane yelled at me. Lewis couldn't hold it in. He burst out laughing.

"What are you laughing about?" I asked Lewis.

"Sorry, sorry," Lewis said, speaking in a soft British accent. His family was from London, and he had moved here a couple of months ago. He and Jane hit it off pretty quick. 

"Well can you give me like ten minutes and then I'll let you have the room for yourself?" I asked. Jane groaned.

"Fine," Jane said. "But I'm keeping time!"

I went back to playing with my Playstation. Andy snickered a little bit.

"What are YOU laughing at?" I asked Andy, annoyed.

"Your sister's kind of hot," Andy said, bursting out laughing after finishing the sentence. Klara was laughing too.

"Why is that funny?" I asked. 

"Well, you know," Andy said. 

"No I don't..."

"GUYS!"

I turned back to the TV. The TV was emitting a orange light.

"What the heck?" I said, pushing the buttons on the controller. Nothing worked. The orange light was still on the TV. 

There was a sudden jolt, and I fell back. The whole house was shaking, like someone was violently shaking it back and forth. I stumbled out of the room and saw Jane and Lewis falling off the couch, shaking violently. The shaking suddenly stopped. I ran downstairs and hugged Jane.

"Why are you hugging me?" Jane asked, clearly disgusted.

"I'm just glad you're ok," I said. 

"Was that an earthquake?" Andy asked, rushing downstairs.

"No," Lewis said. "Earthquakes don't happen here,"

A orange light suddenly blinded my eyes, and a deep sound echoed throughout the house. The light was everywhere, hitting every single window in the house. I stumbled back, unable to see anything. Eventually, my eyes adjusted to the light, and I saw Lewis running to the kitchen and grabbing a knife.

"WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?!" Andy yelled.

"I DON'T KNOW!" Jane screamed. 

"WAIT WHERE'S KLARA?!?!" I yelled at Andy.

"SHE'S STILL UPSTAIRS!" Andy yelled back. I immediately ran upstairs.

"KLARA! KLARA!" I yelled, then stopped. Klara was hovering in midair, her eyes glowing orange. She was staring at the ceiling, her mouth open, not moving, just hovering. I ran towards Klara and shook her.

"KLARA SNAP OUT OF IT!"

Klara didn't move. I ran back downstairs and saw that Andy, Lewis, and Jane were in the same position. I ran to Jane, shaking her. Jane didn't budge. Neither did Andy or Lewis. 

"STOP! WHOEVER IS THERE! JUST STOP!!!" 

Something suddenly overtook me. My vision was overtaken by a bright orange light. I felt my body hover up into the air, and I couldn't move at all. It was as if I wasn't in control of my own body at all. I felt my body ascend into the sky, and everything went black. 

When I regained consciousness, I found myself in a white room. My hands were pinned to the wall, and a searing pain overtook me. I groaned, seeing that my hands had been penetrated with two large spikes, I saw Andy and Klara in the room too, their hands also pinned to the wall with large spikes. 

"HELP! HELP!" I yelled, but it was futile. My voice echoed throughout the entire room. Just then, two large humanoids entered the room. I could only stare in shock as they walked towards Andy, observing him. Their eyes were a pitch black, and their hands were long and webbed. Their legs were bent slightly, but were even longer than their hands. After observing Andy for a bit, they walked towards Klara, then towards me. I tried to free myself, but it was futile. The searing pain came back. 

"GET AWAY! GET AWAY!!!"

Just then, the humanoids spoke, and I could understand every word they said. It was English, fluent English.

**"He's...awake"**

"**That wasn't supposed to happen"**

"**Look at him. He's not a perfect specimen"**

"**I agree. The others are much more better,"**

**"Should we let him go?"**

"**I suppose"**

The humanoids walked towards my hands and I felt the pain come back. The humanoids walked back in front of me, holding the spikes. They dropped them, then caressed my face.  


"**Shhh little one. You will be returned to your family. Your friends however, we must keep them,"**

"Please," I was crying now. "Let them go,"

The humanoids turned to each other, then back to me.

**I'm afraid we need them for further study. Do not tell anyone about our little encounter, or else..**

The pain overtook me again. I keeled forward in pain, clutching my head.

**The pain is coming from a bug we have implanted in your brain. Any attempt at telling any other humans about the encounter will result in the pain you are feeling right now.**

The pain slowly stopped, and I stood back up, still crying. 

**Now, we shall let you go little one**

The orange light returned, and I found myself back in my bed in less than a second. I stood up quickly, and looked at my hands. There were no scars, nothing to indicate that they had been stabbed with spikes. I groaned and walked to my bedroom door, hearing crying downstairs. I walked downstairs and saw my parents and two men in trenchcoats. As soon as my mom saw me she let out a wail and ran to me, hugging me tightly.

"OH MY BABY!" My mom wailed.

"What's...going on," I said, holding in tears. I knew perfectly well what was happening.

"Kiddo," One of the trenchcoat men spoke up. "Your uh..."

He cleared his throat and continued.

"Your sister and friends went missing last night," The trenchcoat man said. "Do you recall anything during that time?"

I opened my mouth to speak but stopped. I remembered the threat. If I told a single soul about last night the pain would return. I gulped.

"No...I don't" I said. "I fell asleep at 9,"

The trenchcoat man nodded, and handed my dad a card.

"If anything comes up, call the number on the card," The other trenchcoat man said, standing up and leaving. My mom and dad hugged me for what seemed like eternity after that.

&#x200B;

That was 27 years ago. I'm 38 now. I have a beautiful wife and two kids. I still can vividly picture the night my sister and friends were taken, but I haven't told a single soul about the incident since it happened. By now I've come to accept what happened that night. What's happened has happened, and besides, I can't change my past. But from time to time, the faces of the humanoids still haunts me.
