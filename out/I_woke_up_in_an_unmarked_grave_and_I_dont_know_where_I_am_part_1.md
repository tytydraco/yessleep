I don’t know how much the battery on this thing is gonna last, so I’ll be brief.

I woke up just a couple of ours ago, laying in a wooden coffin at the bottom of a small pit.

Someone tried to bury me alive.

Fortunately they didn’t see the job through and just left me there.

Sick bastards even dressed me up for the occasion, they tailored a suit just for me!

How the hell were they able to get my measures perfectly, what did they do to me when I was unconscious.

God, I can’t remember anything, I don’t even remember my name!

My whole body hurts like a bitch, I think they might have beaten me up until I was unconscious, maybe I got a concussion and lost my memory during the beating

I feel like I’m living in a haze, a thick mist covering my mind, my first few moments after waking up are a blur, I just remember gasping and sprinting out of there as fast as I could.

While running away I tripped and fell on an old shovel, I’ve taken it with me for self defense, just to be sure.

I think I’m somewhere in the Northern part of the country, I saw mountains, a forest, and a town not too far away.

Maybe someone can help me there!

But what if they live there, the people that stuffed me in that coffin, what if they catch me?!
Will they finish the job for real this time, or will they put me through something worse?!

God damnit I don’t know what to do!!

I decided to hide in this small church inside the cemetery, I thought I could wait the dawn over here, but I don’t think it’s going to be safe for much longer.

It’s dark in here but the light of the moon shining through a couple of holes in the roof paint a small picture of the environment

The place is covered with blood, almost as if someone exploded in here, but there aren’t any guts, nor any sort of remains left

It seems like a wild animal had trashed the place too, half the forniture has been destroyed and the church’s organ has been smashed in, as if someone or something heavy fell onto it.

And it also looks like someone started throwing salt everywhere, some of it even fell on this phone

Speaking of, I found the phone I’m currently using on the remains of one of the benches, set on flashlight mode, pointing upwards.

The password was carved on the cover with a shiv or something: 203117

Why would anyone do this?! Was this phone meant for me?! Is this my phone?!

This password doesn’t ring any bell though, but after all nothing really does.

Damnit! Why can’t I remember

Maybe there is something else on this phone that can help me, but as of now I only found the link to this forum in the notes.

Somehow there is still internet connection, but whenever I trie calling anyone there is just silence, not even static, just silence.

Hopefully here somebody will be able to hear me, even though I’m not entirely sure.

Shit, I saw someone through the window, I don’t think he saw me thanks to the stained glass covered in blood, but I saw his silhouette.

I think he was limping or something like he was hurt

Could they be another victim?! Are there other people trapped six feet underground?!

I just want to go home

But where is home why can’t I remember?!?

Fysdg 

No no no someone’s here, someone’s here with me, oh god, how did they get in, I didn’t hear the door opening, could they have been hiding in the shadow all along.

I just hear them breathing somewhere in the church, they aren’t moving, how didn’t I hear them before?!

I can try and bolt out of the back door, but will I be able to outrun them

I need to get out of  here, please god please find me send help send help
