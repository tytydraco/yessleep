RUN!

JUST RUN!

DON’T STOP.

DON’T LOOK BACK.

JUST RUN!

 

There’s something out there, its old, ancient even. it’s been here a long time since before the dawn of man and it will continue long after were gone. It’s the thing that chased our people through the forests from the times we had just barely evolved from apes, it’s the bump in the night, the scratching noise in the other room that you tell yourself was just the pipes; or the house settling. It’s the shadow on the carpet cast by nothing, it’s the thing in the corner of your eye, the thing darting across a dark room, the breath on the back of your neck and the monster in the closet when you are a child.

 

Have you ever been staring into the corner of a dark room and sure you saw something move, but eventually tell yourself it’s nothing and it your mind playing tricks on you, or been walking down an empty street and heard a noise but your mind tells you it’s probably just a cat or something… well that’s them, their there, their always there they are why humans fear the dark. I don’t know how many they are but they’re here. They live in the shadows, in the darkness, well a more appt description would be that they are the darkness, they consume, feed and leach on the fear that manifests within their pray.

 

There the original owners of the planet were just the invasive species; we took over their planet and now they want it back. They will feed until we are wiped out, they are everywhere, without you even noticing them. They have been watching and waiting for the perfect moment to strike, and now that time has come, they are hungry for flesh and blood and we are the perfect cattle, all they had to do was wait for us to get fat and complacent, get us thinking we are the dominant species. Then they go in for the kill and we would never see it coming.

 

They are not demons or ghost or ghouls, goblins, vampires or werewolves these are real and they have chosen me next, they did not choose me for food, they chose me for something else. I don’t know what that is but I can feel it, like a cold wave across my skin that makes my hair stand on ends it feels like… freedom, they need me they showed me the light, the beauty of how they live they don’t want to hurt us, they want to free all of us, they love us.

 

When you stare into the darkness or see them out of the corner of your eye, don’t look away, look deeper. look and you just might see them, because they will see you, they’ll be there ready and waiting so the next time you see them I beg you please…

 

DON’T RUN!

JUST DON’T RUN!

STOP.

LOOK BACK.

JUST DON’T RUN!
