We called ourselves the Gaffers. Why? ‘Why, why give a feck’—that was always the answer. Just a few Irish kids poking around places where we didn’t belong, just looking for a thrill, thinking we were invincible. We never set out to get hurt, though. If I’d known what we were walking into on that island, I’d have smashed every pint glass in the pub before letting Mick rope us in. But that’s the thing about us Gaffers— we couldn’t resist the craic, especially when there was a good story to chase.

And this story starts like most of ours, with a night out in Galway. Fiona, Mick, Connor, Paddy, and me were crammed into a booth at O’Malley’s, trading banter over pints of stout and whiskey chasers. Paddy had been going on about exploring some abandoned asylum up near Sligo, but none of us were biting. Too cliché. Too obvious.

“Sure, what’s next?” Mick teased, leaning back with a grin. “Ye gonna tell us there’s ghosts in the basement too? Feck off, Paddy.”

“Go shite, Mick,” Paddy shot back, flipping him the bird. “At least I’m bringing ideas to the table. What’ve you got, then?”

Mick shrugged and tipped back his glass, but before he could answer, the old fella at the bar chimed in.

“Yer man’s right, though,” he said, voice gravelly from years of smoking. “Plenty o’ places round here folk won’t go near. Abandoned, aye. But not empty.”

That got our attention. Mick leaned forward, eyebrows raised. “Go on, old lad. What’re you on about?”

The man turned, his face half-lit by the dim glow of the bar. “There’s a wee island off the coast, west of Connemara. Ain’t on any tourist maps. Place was a village back in eighteen-thirty-two, til a merchant ship docked there. Brought somethin’ with it. After that, poof—every soul on that island vanished. Government shut it down, banned anyone from goin’.”

Connor snorted. “Aye, sure. And let me guess, it’s haunted by banshees?”

The old man’s eyes darkened. “Not banshees, boy. Somethin’ worse.”

He downed the rest of his drink and stood up, as if that was all he had to say. “You’d do well to leave it alone,” he said. “Some places are better forgotten.”

The man left without another word. 

There was a pause as we exchanged glances. Fiona, sitting beside me, nudged my arm. “You think he’s takin’ the piss?”

“Doubt it,” I said, watching the man shuffle out the door. “He looked scared shite-less.”

Mick was grinning like a kid on Christmas. “An island? Condemned by the government? Jaysus, lads, we’ve hit the jackpot! No one’s been there in years, probably. Imagine the state of it.”

“We don’t even know where it is,” Fiona pointed out.

“Bet we could find out,” Mick said, tapping his phone. “Few searches, a bit o’ digging. What d’ye reckon, Paddy?”

Paddy’s eyes lit up. “Aye, I’m in. Be a right adventure.”

Connor leaned back, skeptical. “And how’re we getting there? Swim?”

“There’s boats,” Mick said, waving him off. “Fishermen’ll take us for a price. They’ll do anything if you grease their palm enough.”

I should’ve said no. Should’ve pointed out how feckin’ stupid it was to go chasing ghost stories on an island that’d been off-limits for over a century. But I didn’t. That’s the thing about Mick—he could talk you into anything, make you feel like saying no would ruin the best night of your life.

“Feck it,” I said, raising my glass. “Why not?”

The others cheered, clinking their pints together. Fiona rolled her eyes but smiled, leaning into me. “You’re all eejits.”

“Aye,” I said, kissing her temple. “But you love us for it.”

We spent the next hour plotting, Paddy pulling up old maps on his phone while Mick made calls to see if any locals were mad enough to take us out there. By the time we left the pub, the plan was set: dawn tomorrow, we’d meet a ferryman at the docks. He’d take us there and be back to collect us by morning.

It seemed simple then. Just another madcap adventure for the Gaffers. But as I sit here writing this, I can still hear Mick’s laugh in my head, ringing loud and clear, like he’s just around the corner.

God, how I wish we’d stayed in the pub.

We set off at first light, bleary-eyed and a bit hungover but buzzing with excitement. The ferryman wasn’t exactly thrilled to see us, though he didn’t ask too many questions—he probably figured the stack of euros Mick handed him was explanation enough.

The boat was a rickety thing, smelling of salt and diesel, but it cut through the early morning mist like a knife. The sea was calm, though the cold was biting. Fiona pulled her scarf tighter around her neck as the island came into view. It looked like something out of a horror film—a jagged, dark silhouette against the pale grey sky.

“Bleedin’ hell,” Connor muttered, leaning over the side. “Looks like somethin’ out of a feckin’ nightmare.”

“Relax, mate,” Mick said, elbowing him. “It’s just an old rock with a few ruined houses. We’ll be grand.”

The ferryman stayed quiet, his eyes fixed on the island as if he didn’t want to look away for too long. When we got close enough, he slowed the engine and pointed toward a crumbling stone pier.

“This is as far as I’ll go,” he said gruffly. “I’ll be back sharp at dawn. Be ready.”

“What, ye not stayin’ for the craic?” Paddy quipped, earning a glare.

“No one stays,” the ferryman said sharply. “Be here at first light. No later.”

We didn’t argue. The five of us clambered off the boat, our boots crunching against the frost-covered stones of the pier. The air was colder here, heavy with a damp, earthy smell that seemed to cling to the back of your throat. The ferryman didn’t linger—he turned the boat around and disappeared into the mist before we’d even had a chance to thank him.

“Well, that’s feckin’ ominous,” Connor said, rubbing his hands together.

“Good riddance,” Mick said, slinging his backpack over his shoulder. “Right, where do we start?”

“Hold it, lads“ Paddy said, his voice steady despite the biting wind. He swung his rucksack off his shoulder and started handing out gear 

“Everyone take a knapsack—got torches, rope, some snacks to stop yer whingin’, and first aid. Fiona, I threw in a few extra batteries for your camera.” He handed me a heavier bag last, pausing as he rummaged through it. “And this,” he said, pulling out a flare gun and pressing it into my hand. “Just in case.” 

I looked at him, eyebrows raised. “Feck’s this for? We’re not signalin’ the Coast Guard, are we?” Paddy gave a tight smile. “Might not be, but if somethin’ goes sideways, better to have it than wish ye did.”

The village wasn’t far—just a short walk up a narrow path lined with gnarled, leafless trees. The cottages came into view first, their stone walls crumbling and roofs long gone. It was eerie, no doubt, but also strangely beautiful in the way abandoned places often are. Fiona was snapping photos left and right, her camera clicking softly in the stillness.

“Imagine livin’ out here,” she said, her breath clouding in the air. “Middle o’ nowhere, no electricity, no nothing. Must’ve been grim.”

“Aye,” I said, looking around. “But peaceful, maybe. Before, y’know… whatever happened.”

“Right, enough of the sentiment,” Mick said. “Let’s split up, cover more ground. Paddy, you’ve got the drone, yeah?”

Paddy nodded, already fiddling with his gear. “I’ll get some overhead shots. Might spot somethin’ interestin’.”

“Sean, you and Fiona take the church,” Mick continued, pointing toward the spire visible through the trees. “Connor and I’ll check out the docks. Meet back here in an hour.”

“Bossy bollocks,” Fiona muttered under her breath, but she smiled.

The church was in slightly better shape than the cottages, though not by much. The roof was mostly intact, and the stone walls still stood, covered in moss and lichen. Inside, it was dark and damp, the air thick with the smell of decay.

Fiona shone her flashlight around, the beam catching strange carvings on the walls—symbols I didn’t recognize. They looked old, older than the church itself, and had been scratched deep into the stone.

“This doesn’t feel right,” Fiona said quietly.

“Nothing about this place does,” I replied, running my fingers over the carvings. “Let’s get the photos and head back.”

Outside, Paddy’s drone buzzed overhead, its tiny camera scanning the treeline. Suddenly, it cut out, the sound disappearing abruptly.

“Oi!” Paddy’s voice echoed through the village. “Feckin’ thing’s dead. Hang on, I’ll go grab it.”

“Be careful!” Fiona called, but Paddy was already jogging off into the woods.

The others returned shortly after, Mick and Connor looking grim. “Found claw marks on the dock,” Mick said. “Big ones. Look fresh, too.”

We exchanged uneasy glances. Fiona squeezed my hand.

“Let’s stick together from now on,” I said.

No one argued.

“Right,” Mick said, clapping his hands together like he was trying to shake off the tension. “What’ve we got so far? Paddy’s drone’s bollocksed, the dock’s scratched to hell, and the church has… weird scribbles?”

“They’re not scribbles,” Fiona snapped, showing him the photos on her camera. “Look at them. They’re… I dunno, ritualistic or somethin’. Who carves that into a church wall?”

Connor snorted. “Maybe the same eejit who clawed up the dock. Bet it’s just badgers.”

“Badgers don’t scratch *stone*, ye clown,” I said, pointing to Mick. “And he said the marks looked fresh.”

Mick nodded, his grin flickering. “Aye. Fresh enough to be worryin’. And big. Bigger than a badger, anyway.”

Paddy came trudging back through the trees, clutching his drone. “Found it caught in some branches,” he muttered, scowling. “Bloody thing’s dead. Weird, though—the battery’s full, but it just… shut off.”

“What’d it see before it went out?” Fiona asked, leaning in.

Paddy shrugged. “Nothing clear. A shadow, maybe? Fast as feck. I can’t make it out.”

“Great,” Connor said, throwing up his hands. “So we’ve got big scratches, weird carvings, and a ghost shadow. And we’re stuck here til morning.”

“Would ye stop,” Mick snapped. “We’ve handled worse. It’s probably nothin’. Just some animal livin’ out here, scared by us pokin’ around.”

“Scared?” Paddy said, raising an eyebrow. “That’s not how it feels. Feels like *we’re* the ones bein’ watched.”

The words hung there, heavy as the overcast sky. No one wanted to admit it, but he was right. You couldn’t shake the sense that something out there had its eyes on us—watching, waiting.

We decided to check the rest of the village together, though no one was cracking jokes anymore. The cottages were much the same as the first—rotting beams, sagging walls, and dirt floors overgrown with moss and weeds. But here and there, we’d find something that didn’t sit right.

In one, Fiona found a wooden crib tipped on its side, the wood warped and splintered but still faintly recognizable. Inside were shreds of fabric, bleached white from age, and dark stains that neither of us wanted to identify.

In another, Mick pulled open what might’ve once been a pantry door and found animal bones scattered across the floor. They weren’t old, though—there was still gristle clinging to some of them.

“Foxes,” Connor said, though he didn’t sound convinced. “Or… badgers.”

“Would ye shut up about the badgers,” Mick said, slamming the door shut. “Whatever’s eatin’ out here, it’s no feckin’ badger.”

As we moved deeper into the village, the woods seemed to press in closer, the air colder and heavier with every step. The path narrowed until we reached the edge of a clearing, where the ruins of a larger building stood—what might’ve been an inn or a meeting hall. The roof had collapsed inward, leaving the inside exposed to the elements.

“Christ,” Fiona muttered, clutching my arm. “It smells rank.”

She was right. The air reeked of something foul—like meat left to rot in the sun.

Paddy edged forward, covering his nose with his sleeve. “There’s somethin’ in there,” he said, voice muffled.

“What?” Mick asked, stepping up beside him.

“I dunno. A carcass or… somethin’. It’s fresh, though. Real fresh.”

“Let’s go back,” Fiona said, tugging at my sleeve. “This is mad. We’ve seen enough.”

“We’ve barely scratched the surface,” Mick said, though even he sounded uneasy. “Let’s just—”

The sound cut him off: a low, guttural growl from somewhere in the trees.

We all froze.

“Fox?” Connor whispered, though his voice cracked on the word.

“No,” I said, staring into the shadows. “Not a fox.”

The growl came again, closer this time. Whatever it was, it wasn’t hiding anymore.

“What the feck was that?” Connor whispered, his voice barely audible.

“Doesn’t matter,” Mick hissed. “We’re leavin’. Back to the cottages, now.”

No one argued. Fiona grabbed my hand, her grip vice-like, and we started back the way we came, moving as fast as we could without breaking into a full sprint. The woods were darker now, the weak afternoon light swallowed by heavy clouds. Every snap of a twig or crunch of leaves underfoot made my heart lurch.

“It’s followin’ us,” Paddy muttered, glancing over his shoulder. “I can hear it.”

“Don’t look,” I said through gritted teeth, keeping my eyes forward. “Just keep movin’.”

The cottages came into view like a lifeline, their ruined shapes barely visible through the trees. We piled into the first one we came to, slamming the door shut behind us. Mick and Connor shoved an old dresser against it, the wood groaning under their weight.

“Feckin’ hell,” Mick said, doubling over to catch his breath. “What the feck is out there?”

“Somethin’ big,” Fiona said, her voice shaking. She was still gripping my hand, her nails digging into my skin. “I saw… I don’t know what I saw. It was movin’ in the trees. Fast.”

“It’s not just an animal,” Paddy said, pacing the room. “I saw the eyes. Feckin’ *glowin’*. Like… like fire.”

Connor slumped against the wall, shaking his head. “We’re trapped. We’re trapped on this bleedin’ island with… with that thing.”

“No, we’re not,” Mick said, standing up straight. “We just need to hold out til dawn. The ferryman’ll be back. We’ll make it.”

“Hold out?” Fiona said, her voice rising. “In this? Against *that*? Are you mad?”

“We don’t have a choice!” Mick snapped. “Unless ye fancy swimmin’ back to the mainland.”

A heavy thud against the wall made us all jump. The room went deathly quiet, everyone staring at the door. Another thud followed, louder this time, rattling the dresser.

“Jesus Christ,” Paddy whispered, backing toward the corner. “It’s here.”

The growl came again, low and guttural, but now it was accompanied by a scratching sound. Long, deliberate scrapes against the wood.

“What do we do?” Connor asked, his voice trembling. “What the feck do we do?”

“Stay quiet,” I said, barely recognizing my own voice. “Don’t move. Don’t make a sound.”

For a moment, it seemed to work. The scratching stopped, and the growl faded. We all held our breath, straining to hear anything over the pounding of our own hearts. My ears rang in the silence, my pulse thundering like a drum. I prayed—silently, desperately—that it had moved on.

Then the door exploded inward, the dresser splintering like it was made of matchsticks. The thing that burst through wasn’t human, wasn’t even close. It was tall, gaunt, with gray skin that lay tight over bones that seemed to jut out at odd angles. Its face… Jesus, I can’t even describe its face. Hollow reflective eyes, a maw full of jagged teeth, and a smell like rotting meat.

Mick reacted first, grabbing a rusted iron rod from the floor and swinging it with all his might. The creature moved faster than I thought possible, ducking the blow with an inhuman grace. Its clawed hand lashed out, raking across Mick’s shoulder with a sound like tearing fabric—but it wasn’t fabric. Blood sprayed in an arc across the room, and Mick staggered, clutching his arm as his breath left him.

The thing didn’t stop there. It pounced on him, knocking him flat on his back with a sickening crunch as his head hit the floor. Its claws sank into his chest, ripping through his jacket and shirt like wet paper. Mick’s breath turned into choked, desperate gasps as the creature tore at him, pulling skin, muscle, and bone apart with horrifying precision. The sound was unbearable—wet, crunching, tearing.

“Mick!” Connor shouted, rushing forward, but I grabbed him, pulling him back. I didn’t even think, just reacted.

Mick’s hands flailed weakly, trying to push the thing away, but it was useless. The creature pinned him down with one clawed hand while the other plunged into his abdomen. There was a horrible sucking sound as it pulled something free—a glistening, pulsing piece of him that I couldn’t even identify. Mick’s body arched, his mouth open in a silent scream, before collapsing limp onto the floor.

The creature tilted its head, its reflective eyes fixed on us, as if savoring the moment. Then, without any effort, it dragged Mick’s lifeless body toward the shattered doorway, his boots leaving bloody streaks across the floor. His head lolled to the side, his face frozen in a death rattle.

We couldn’t move. Couldn’t breathe. The sound of Mick’s body being yanked through the wooden splinters into the darkness was the thing that finally broke the spell.

“Run!” Fiona screamed, grabbing my arm. “We have to run!”

We didn’t need telling twice. Connor, Paddy, Fiona, and I bolted out the back of the cottage, into the night, leaving Mick behind to an awful wet noise.

We ran blindly into the night, stumbling over roots and jagged rocks. The cold bit at my face, my lungs burned, and Fiona’s hand was a vice around mine, keeping me grounded.

“We need to stop!” Connor gasped, doubling over. “I can’t… I can’t keep goin’.”

“You can’t stop now!” Fiona snapped, pulling me forward. “It’s right behind us!”

Paddy came to a halt beside Connor, panting. “She’s right,” he said, clutching a stitch in his side. “We’ve got to… to find somewhere safe. Somewhere it can’t get to us.”

“There’s nowhere safe!” Connor barked, his voice cracking. “Did ye see what it did to Mick? Jesus, Mary, and Joseph, it tore him apart like he was nothin’!”

“That’s why we have to keep movin’!” I said, my voice sharper than I intended. “Stayin’ still is our death.”

The sound of snapping branches cut through the darkness. Fiona grabbed my arm, her nails digging in. “We’re wasting time. Sean, we have to go!”

I nodded, but Connor was frozen, staring back into the black woods, his face pale. “It’s playin’ with us,” he whispered. “It could’ve killed us already, but it’s waitin’. Why’s it waitin’?”

“Connor!” I shouted, grabbing his jacket and shaking him. “Snap out of it! We’ve got to—”

The creature came out of nowhere, a blur of pale, twisted limbs and glinting teeth. It barreled into Connor, knocking him off his feet with a sickening crunch. His scream tore through the night as its claws raked down his chest, carving deep, ragged furrows into his flesh.

“Connor!” Paddy yelled, rushing forward with a rock in his hand. He swung it with desperate force, smashing it against the creature’s skull. The thing barely flinched. It turned to Paddy, its hollow eyes glinting with malice, and lashed out, catching him in the side. Paddy crumpled to the ground, clutching his ribs, blood seeping between his fingers.

“Run!” Paddy croaked, his voice strained and wet. “Get Fiona out of here!”

I hesitated, my body screaming to help, but Fiona tugged at me with all her strength. “Sean, please! We can’t save them!”

Connor’s screams turned to wet gurgles as the creature leaned over him, its mouth opening wide. I didn’t look back after that. Fiona and I ran, tears streaming down her face, bile rising in my throat. I’d never felt so helpless, so cowardly, but I knew she was right. We couldn’t save them.

We stumbled through the woods, half-blind in the darkness, until the faint outline of the church spire rose above the trees. It was the only place left. The cottages were useless, the woods were a deathtrap, but the church… it had walls, stone walls. Maybe it would hold.

We pushed through the rotting wooden doors and slammed them shut, dragging a heavy pew in front of them. My hands were shaking so badly I could barely grip the wood.

“What do we do?” she whispered, “Sean, what do we do?”

I didn’t have an answer. I just pulled her into my arms, holding her as tightly as I could. We stayed like that for what felt like hours, though it could’ve been minutes. The air in the church was cold and damp, the smell of rot and mildew thick enough to choke on.

Then came the scratching.

It started faintly, coming from the back wall of the church. Fiona froze in my arms, her head snapping up. “Sean…”

“I hear it,” I said, my voice low. “Stay here.”

“No, don’t—”

“I’ll just look,” I said, cutting her off. “Stay by the door. If anything happens, run.”

She nodded reluctantly, clutching a broken piece of wood from one of the pews like a club. I crept toward the sound, my heartbeat thundering in my ears. The back wall was covered in those strange carvings, faintly glowing now in the darkness. The scratching grew louder, more frantic, as if something was clawing its way through the stone.

I leaned in closer, my breath clouding the air in front of me. For a moment, I thought I saw movement within the carvings, like the shapes themselves were shifting. Then a hand—thin, pale, and hooked—punched through a crack in the wall. Blood dripped from its claws, dark and viscous, pooling on the stone as it worked.

I stumbled back with a shout as the creature’s head emerged from the hole, its maw twisted into a grotesque ‘O’. It pulled itself through the wall like it was nothing, its body folding and contorting in ways that made my stomach churn. I scrambled back toward Fiona, shouting, “Run! We’ve got to run!”

She didn’t argue. We shoved the pew aside and burst out into the night. The woods loomed ahead, dark and endless, but there was no other option. We ran, our breaths ragged, our legs burning, the ground slick with frost.

We knew the creature was faster than us, it already proved that. But something about how it was moving now was different. Like it wasn’t just hunting. It was herding. And as we broke through the treeline and onto the beach, I realized with a sinking heart why it let us go. The boat wasn’t there. Dawn was still hours away.

We were alone. It wanted us to know that.

The beach stretched out before us, endless and barren under the faint glow of the rising moon. Waves lapped at the shore, indifferent to our situation. 

“He’s not comin’,” Fiona said, under her trembling lips. “We’re on our own.”

I grabbed her hand with a tight squeeze. “He’ll be here at dawn,” I said, though I wasn’t sure how much of that I believed. “We just have to make it til then.”

“That’s hours away, Sean!” she snapped, her voice breaking under the words. “We’ll never—”

The growl cut her off. Deep, guttural, and close. I spun around, my heart pounding so hard it felt like it might burst. The creature emerged from the treeline, moving slowly now, playfully. Its gaunt frame was illuminated by the pale moonlight. 

Fiona clutched my arm, her nails digging roughly into my skin. “It’s playing with us,” she muttered, “It could’ve killed us back there, but it didn’t. Why?”

I didn’t answer. I couldn’t. My eyes were locked on the creature as it stalked closer, its hollow eyes fixed on us with a mocking intensity. It stopped a few dozen feet away, tilting its head to one side, almost curiously. Its body filled the air around us with the thick stench of decay, making it hard to breathe.

“What do you want?” I shouted through my cracking nerves. “What the feck do you want from us?”

The creature didn’t respond. It didn’t need to. It crouched low, its muscles tensing, and I knew it was about to finalize its hunt.

“Run!” I shouted, shoving Fiona toward the water. “Go, now!”

“No!” she screamed, refusing to let go of my arm. “I’m not leavin’ you!”

“You have to!” I yelled, my voice desperate. “If we both stay, we’re dead!”

The creature lunged, faster than I expected. I pushed Fiona aside and dove to the ground just narrowly avoiding its claws. The sand was cold and damp beneath me as I scrambled to my feet, grabbing a large rock and hurling it at the creature. It struck its shoulder with a dull thud, but the thing didn’t even flinch.

“Sean!” Fiona screamed toward me.

The creature turned its attention to her, and I felt my blood run cold. It moved toward her, gentle and soft, as if savoring the moment. Fiona backed away, her eyes wide, until her heels hit the edge of the water.

“Come on, you bastard!” I shouted, grabbing another rock. “Come after me!”

I hurled the stone, this time hitting it square in the head. The creature stopped. For a moment, I thought I’d succeeded in hurting it. Then it’s teeth began to jitter. A grotesque, unnatural jittering and clacking noise that made my stomach lurch. 

It was laughing.

“Fiona,” I shouted again. “Get to the water and swim!”

“No, I’m not leavin’ you!” Her voice was broken. The thing turned to me.

The creature lunged again, faster this time, and I couldn’t move quick enough. It knocked me to the ground, its claws raking across my arm. The pain was blinding, hot and sharp, but adrenaline kept me moving. I rolled to the side, grabbing a piece of driftwood and swinging it wildly. The makeshift weapon connected with its ribs, eliciting a low groan, but it wasn’t enough.

The creature grabbed me by the throat, its claws digging into my skin as it lifted me off the ground. Its face was inches from mine, its breath hot and rancid. I could feel its strength, its malice, radiating off it like a wall. I thought that was it, that I was done for.

Then Fiona screamed again.

This time it wasn’t a scream of fear—it was rage. Pure, unfiltered rage. She charged at the creature with a sharp rock in her hand, stabbing it into its back with all her strength. The creature roared, dropping me as it whipped around to face her. Fiona didn’t stop. She kept stabbing, tears streaming down her face, her screams echoing across the beach.

“Get away from him!” she shrieked, each word punctuated by another stab.

The creature swiped at her, its claws grazing her side and sending her sprawling onto the sand. Blood soaked her shirt, but she pushed herself up, crawling toward me.

“Sean…” she gasped, her voice weak. “Get up…”

I forced myself to my feet, my entire body screaming in protest. The creature was focused on Fiona now, its attention fully on her. I reached for my bag for anything I could find. My hands touched something hard and plastic. I grabbed it and pulled it out. It was the flare gun—Paddy’s last contribution. My hands were shaking so badly I almost dropped the thing, but I managed to aim.

“Hey!” I shouted, my voice hoarse. The creature turned toward me, its hollow eyes narrowing.

I pulled the trigger.

The flare shot out with a deafening crack, striking the creature in the chest. It roared, a sound so loud and guttural that the ground itself vibrated. Fire erupted across its torso, the flames consuming it as it thrashed and howled. The stench of burning flesh filled the air, making me gag, but I didn’t look away.

The creature staggered toward the treeline, its movements wild and erratic. Then it collapsed, the flames still licking away at its body. The beach fell silent, save for the crackling of the flames.

I dropped the flare gun and fell to my knees, pulling Fiona into my arms. She was trembling, her breathing shallow, but she was alive.

Before we knew it, the first light of dawn broke over the horizon, and in the distance, I heard the faint hum of an engine.

The ferryman was coming. We had survived.

But as I held Fiona, watching the creature’s charred remains smolder on the sand, I couldn’t shake the feeling that we hadn’t won.

The ferryman didn’t say a word when he saw us stumble onto the pier, half-carried and half-dragging each other. His eyes lingered on the gash across Fiona’s side, the blood-soaked sleeve of my jacket, and the rapidly growing bruise on my neck, but he said nothing. Just gestured for us to get into the boat.

“Are… are ye takin’ us back?” I asked.

He nodded once, his face grim, and started the engine.

Fiona leaned against me, her breathing shallow but steady. I wrapped my arms around her, holding her as tightly as I dared without hurting her further. She didn’t speak. Neither of us did. The only sound was the rumble of the engine and the waves slapping against the hull.

When the mainland came into view, relief surged through me, but it was hollow. The weight of everything we’d lost was too heavy to feel anything else.

As we stepped off the boat, the ferryman finally broke his silence. “Ye saw it, didn’t ye?”

I froze, my hand tightening around Fiona’s. “Aye,” I said. “We did. It’s gone.”

He nodded again, his expression dour. 

We walked away, leaving the ferryman and his boat behind. Fiona’s hand slipped into mine, her grip weak but steady.

“We made it,” she said.

“Aye,” I replied, though the word tasted bitter. “We made it.”
