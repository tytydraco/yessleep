The Hill-Harbour community centre had been closed for months before the military arrived.

After those last disappearances, the danger to the public was unignorable, and any hope that common sense would prevail over curiosity was scattered to the winds.

Extreme measures had to be taken, for there was nothing common or sensible about what was happening at the Hill-Harbour community centre.

***--------------------***  

It began on the first Friday in March last year; The night-custodian, Jacob Wallace, had simply vanished.

When the facilities manager, Andrew Olsen, arrived Saturday morning at 7:00am with two large coffees (as he had for the last six months), Jacob was nowhere to be found. Andrew had recalled the sensation of the heat from the second takeaway cup burning his left hand, as Jacob had always been there to receive it before any discomfort could set in.

Andrew searched high and low for Jacob; all the more frantically after finding that his jacket and Colorado Avalanche cap were hung in their usual spot.

He wouldn’t have left early. Not without his coffee, jacket, and cap to shield him from Winter’s last bitter chill before Spring.

Something must have happened…

Andrew did another sweep of the facility, calling for Jacob aloud in increasingly concerned shouts. He checked everywhere.

Then he arrived at the pool…

At the time, the bizarre lapping of water against the tiles of the innocuous indoor swimming pool didn’t particularly concern Andrew. Nor did the little scrap of fabric he skimmed out of the deep end.

But after five more people went missing from the facility over the next two months...including seven-year-old Tommy Anderson... 

After a brutal, invasive, heartbreaking police investigation...

After realizing that the fabric he’d scooped out of the pool was a piece of      Jacob’s shirt... 

After his total ostracization from the community...

Well...all Andrew could reflect on in those final late nights was that seemingly innocuous lapping of water…

It was all he could hear when he put the barrel of the gun in his mouth.

***--------------------***

Hill-Harbour was a small college town with an intimately linked suburban community. The disappearance of one person was more than enough to induce fear and paranoia within the populous. But the disappearance of six people? One of them a seven-year-old boy? The reputational destruction and grisly suicide of a once beloved community figure? Such an incomprehensible series of tragic events proved to Alanna Silver that her once typical, quiet hometown was not as far beyond torches, pitchforks and howling for blood as she would have liked to believe.

She had grown up learning to swim at the community centre, as had all the other children with inextinguishable amphibious inclinations. There were no other options in town; Even in the sweltering summer heat, Quincy Bay was treacherous, and Winter always arrived with a vengeance in Hill-Harbour. You could practically set your watch to those first flakes falling within the week after Halloween.

The only option for aquatic relief and refuge was the pool at the community centre.

But what had once brought joy, now brought nightmares. Not least of all for Alanna Silver.

She knew Andrew well. He was a friend. Her instructor. She’d even had a crush on him; An innocent, fleeting thing that sprouted in adolescence, but bloomed into something more substantial as she grew up. He taught her how to swim; How to not drown. That trust and security, evoked by such a primal, mammalian necessity was never replicated in any other non-familial relationship. Especially not when that deep feeling was coupled with the pristine imagery of her guardian gliding so effortlessly through the water.

Dancing in zero gravity.

Her self-consciousness would always keep her restrained in fantasy, but that didn’t stop Alanna from pursuing her talent and honing her abilities as a swimmer. She became an instructor herself and worked as a lifeguard alongside Andrew at the community centre. She was also a star on her high school swim team, earning scholarships to several reputable universities, including Lakeside U, right there in her hometown.

She chose to stay where she grew up. Close to home. Close to all she knew.

Close to Andrew.

She grew to love him, in her own quiet way.

But the face that had kept her awake during those carefree nights long-passed, now kept her awake for an entirely different reason…

She could see his face. She could hear the shot. She could smell the blood.

She wept uncontrollably when she found out.

She was inconsolable and shut herself in her room for days.

Despite whatever he may or may not have done, she would miss Andrew.

Because of what he may have done. She’d be the only one who would.

In her heart of hearts, she knew Andrew couldn’t have done what everyone said he did.

Certainly not to a child…

He couldn’t have.

Could he?

No. It simply wasn’t possible. There was some crucial, overlooked component, some piece of evidence which would have completely exonerated Andrew.

Perhaps it still could?

If it did exist, she knew the only place where it could be found…

**--------------------**

At 1:30am, after the ninth consecutive night of horrifically disrupted sleep, Alanna shot out of bed. She got dressed, grabbed her backpack, and crept out into the hall, then downstairs; The only home she’d ever known was black as pitch, but she required no vision to confidently navigate the space.

She slinked through the kitchen and reached the basement door.

The basement had always gotten to her; The cold stone, old wood, shadowy corners, and groaning furnace played tricks on her overly active imagination. She opened the door, and the droning creak beckoned her into the darkness that the little girl in her still hesitated to penetrate. She flicked the lights on, splashing weak florescent hues across the dungeon-like space her dad claimed as a workshop. She descended the old stairs quickly, hurried to her father’s large workbench, took a flashlight and a set of bolt-cutters, then left the basement in less than a minute.

No amount of confidence, courage or surety of the natural world would ever slow her ascent up those basement stairs.

Back in the kitchen, she put the tools in her backpack, then proceeded to the side door at the opposite end, leaving her house.

Alanna locked the door, unlocked her bike, hopped on, and set off.

***--------------------***

The hypnotic spinning of the spokes and occasional shifting of gears provided the only soundscape in the dead of that midsummer night.

The community centre was only a ten-minute ride from her house. She hadn’t been up that way since early spring.

Few had.

“For Sale” signs adorned the lawns of several houses, and only multiplied as she grew closer and closer to the community centre.

She turned the corner onto Maple Street, then stopped.

There it stood…

The large, ranch-style building was the haunting focal point at the end of the dimly lit cul-du-sac. The few houses on the street were as dark and abandoned as the community centre itself.

The wind beckoned Alanna. She swore she heard her name in the breeze.

She spun her head around.

Nothing.

No one.

She dismounted her bicycle, deciding to walk the last hundred metres or so.

The *click click click click click click click* of her spokes grew louder, as she grew closer. It matched the frantic beating of her heart, which sent ripples through her body.

She stepped off the street and onto the walkway of the community centre.

She was right to bring the bolt-cutters, seeing that the large double-doors were lashed with an old, rusty chain.

She parked her bike in the stands beside the door, then removed her backpack and pulled out the bolt-cutters.

She approached the door…

*Snip*

*Snip*

*Snip*

The chains rattled lightly as they were severed, then loudly as she pulled them out of their haphazard knots around the door handles. They splashed down onto the concrete, with the large padlock clanking atop the pile of old metal.

Another strong gust of wind seemed to thrust Alanna against the doors.

Her name was yet again, woven into the breeze. This time louder, much clearer than before.

She spun around sharply, instinctively brandishing the bolt-cutters.

Nothing.

No one.

The darkness of the street reminded her of her basement.

She shook her head, rocking some sense back into the present moment.

She turned back around, gripped one of the handles, and pulled.

It was unlocked.

The deadbolt released with a snap, and the large metal door creaked open with an aching groan.

Alanna stepped into the enormous dark foyer, and the door slammed shut behind her.

The darkness and silence enveloped her.

Despite the countless hours she had spent within the facility throughout her life, it was devoid of any warmth or familiarity. The memories of laughter and carefree summer days held no power to combat the dark emptiness that filled the halls.

Only disturbing silence prevailed.       

She reached for the primary light switches to the right of the main doors.

Nothing.

A chill ran through her, as full and frigid as the wind that bid her enter this terrible place.

Those doors were lashed securely with chains for a reason...

What was she doing?

She turned to leave, then stopped herself.

No. No no no. Her objective, her responsibility here was not inconsequential; She knew in her bones that there was *something* going on. Something beyond the comprehension of those judgmental, paranoid cretins that pilloried a good, innocent man and drove him to madness.

She’d expose the truth; Prove them all wrong.      

She removed her pack and pulled out her flashlight, piercing the veil of darkness.

The space surrounding the thin cone of light grew darker, as if to defy her efforts.

She walked down the great hall straight ahead from the main entrance, her footsteps echoing on the old linoleum floor.

A faint smile struggled to cross her visage as she passed a sizeable room that was primarily used as a daycare. She poked her head in, the light revealing toys and large, bold, multicolored ABCs haphazardly splattered all over the walls.

The place had the feeling of an abandoned museum, or those buildings seen in footage of the town outside Chernobyl.

Frozen in time. Lost and forgotten.

Continuing down the hall, Alanna poked her head in the various rooms; Each contained a brief memory that flashed through her mind, bright as her torch, but were ultimately extinguished by the shadows that now claimed dominion over this place.

She came to a closed door with a placard beside it, and shuttered.

“Andrew Olsen – Facilities Manager”

Her trembling hand reached out and grasped the handle.

It was locked. Still, she persisted in twisting and grappling with it.

She leaned in and started to push with her shoulder, then stopped.

She heard something...

She focused and listened intently.

It was faint, but clear…

The soft lapping of water. 

The hairs on the back of her neck stood on end, and were grasped by some irresistible force that pulled her away from the door, and lead her toward the only place the sound could be coming from…

The pool.

As she made her way to the end of the hall, the air around her grew darker and heavier.

Her flashlight was of little use now. The light struggled, flickered, then died.

Damn batteries.

No matter. Sound was her guide now, and it grew louder to match the ever-increasing darkness.

She turned the corner at the end of the hall but stopped sharply as a puddle of water splashed beneath her feet.

She looked down and stomped each foot a couple of times. The whole floor was soaked.

Looking back up towards the end of the hall, she distinguished the wide, open entrance that led to the pool.

A cold grasp emanated from the portal and drew her forward with haste. Her feet splashed as she approached.

She came to the threshold.

Crossing over, the void opened up, and she took in the grand space.

She felt as small as when her parents first dropped her off at the beginning of summer, all those years ago.

The darkness was impenetrable, but she knew her footing.

The flooded tile splashed beneath her feet as she stepped to the exact spot where she was first baptized in these sacred waters.

All sound suddenly ceased.

Silence.

Unbearable silence.

Her heart pounded; her breath quickened. She panted, and gasped for air as she began to weep.

Then, a new sound…

A ripple…

Out there…in the pool…

Clenching her flashlight, she beat it ferociously, screaming through her tears.

It flickered on with a brilliant glow, and she swept the light across the water...

Alanna's light fell upon the source...only for a brief moment...before being consumed by the darkness once more...

***--------------------***

Alanna’s bicycle was found at the stand beside the main entrance of the community centre.

Two weeks after she disappeared, her mother took a bottle of pills from the medicine cabinet and ran herself a bath.

Her father was arrested after he was found hysterically dousing the community centre with gasoline. He was desperately struggling to get the zippo lit before he was handcuffed.

Private security details were hired to keep watch over the facility. After three of the guards disappeared, a town hall was held where the crowd unanimously demanded the destruction of the community centre.

A few days after the town hall, people began to notice the military personnel.

What started out as a few men in suits in unmarked vans, quickly evolved into full-fledged martial lockdown; The upcoming fall semester at the university was cancelled, several people were displaced from their homes (most left of their own volition) and by late September, Hill-Harbour was a ghost town, only occupied by a hundred or so military personnel and government agents.

A two-square-kilometre perimeter was sealed off around the community centre. The heavily monitored checkpoints are perpetually manned by operatives the other soldiers are generally afraid to address, or even look in the eye.

***--------------------***

No one knows exactly what’s happening at the Hill-Harbour community centre. Even the nameless, faceless board members of the undocumented government agency overseeing the operation only have vague, secondhand reports from their operatives who haven’t set foot inside the facility.

Those who have gone in, haven’t come out.

All except for one…

At 6:34am, EST, on Saturday, March 5^(th) (precisely one year after the first documented disappearance of custodian, Jacob Wallace), the main doors of the Hill-Harbour community centre opened. Agent 989, a class A operative with gold security clearance, stepped out of the facility, and immediately collapsed. He was retrieved by three class B operatives, and medically extracted by 7:01.

Upon retrieval, agent 989 was drenched, head to toe.

He was in a catatonic state for ninety-six hours. Upon waking, he had to be physically restrained after attempting to seize a security team member’s gun.

He is currently confined in a padded room at an undisclosed detention facility, where he can do no harm to himself, or others. He is kept under 24/7 surveillance and checked on three times daily by class A medical staff.

He doesn’t speak. Not in a way that medical staff members and translators can understand.

During brief windows where he does seem to be coherent, medical staff and translators unanimously report feelings of being “stared through” as he repeats the same thing over, and over and over again; Softly…to himself…

“We all return to the water…We all return to the water…”
