There had always been a man in my attic. Well, as long as I had owned it. After my mother passed, I inherited her house. I never heard of anyone living there until then, but over time I had come to accept the squatter. My mom taught me well to let good enough things be. He never bothered me, and from time to time I would even find overnight things would seem to be fixed, from bugged lightbulbs to creaky doors. I assumed the man helped me out for letting him stay. This was nice because I didn't keep tools around the house, and I don't like calling people to fix things for me. Call it laziness, but I left him. We had our peace.

I never did see the man. I could hear him though.

Speaking of hearing, that's where my story began. It had been a particularly stressful day of work - working overtime - and I was ready to pass out. As my eyes grew heavy from the blue glow of my television, I was ready to call it a night. But I couldn't. It was the man. He was doing something up there. In the attic. An instinctual shiver shot up my back when I was rudely awoken by loud crashes and bangs coming from above. Usually he's quiet enough but this night he had been making such a racket I couldn't even hear my TV. Hardly even my own thoughts.  


Thump a thump thump. Rackety bang bang. Thump a thump thump. Rackety bang bang.

What the fuck was he doing up there? Did he have a drumset? Was he playing with power tools? I had never seen him and preferred to keep it that way so I tried to ignore it and just let the man stay and mind his own business - but when I can't even mind mine what am I supposed to do? This is my house. Who does he think he is?

The pounding *above* my head creeped in*to* my head, a throbbing headache. Each pound of the floorboards, a new beat against my temple. Enough is enough, I could hear myself think - or maybe say. Scream? Everything that night is a hazy drunken blur. Up the stairs I went, sloughing along the guard rail, caught in an enraged stupor. He's dead, I thought - or maybe said. I'll kill him. I reached the final step. I pulled down the hatch to the final floor - the attic and...

Nothing. There was no sound. It was like pulling down the hatch to the attic ended the noise, somehow. I peeked my head into the room, the throbbing in my head slowly dissipating, and saw nothing. There was no man. No tools. Only a few spare boxes holding my late mother's old possessions.

The rest of the night was silent. Eerily silent. My thoughts seemed louder than life. Thankfully the swirl of panic and rage from the night slowly trickled down and I could find rest. This did not last long though.

Thump a thump thump. Rackety bang bang. Thump a thump thump. Rackety bang bang.

The exact noise from the attic. Clear as day. He's not getting away this time. I felt myself move as if through a mist. Each motion took no effort. To kill this man would be an easy task. Filled with confidence at the grace I found in my body, I tugged down the hatch to the attic. But this time I wasn't greeted by an ending to the noise. Rather, I was met with a hammer to my head. And my vision turned black.

Immediately I started from my slumber. Looking around my room, I gathered my senses. I could feel my body in my bed. I could hear my fan whirring. I was alive. Brushing it off as a nightmare, I laid myself back to rest, trying to ignore the pool of sweat I then lay in.

Yet after the incident, I never again had a restful night. The same nightmare haunted me over and over. I relived my death time and time again. Every time I would wake up in my bed in a cold sweat, panicked - thankful for being alive, but dreading the next night.

I can't say for sure why this happened to me. Or that it continues to. I never heard the man in my waking hours, only during rest. The only explanation I can come up with is advice my mom would always tell me, that I didn't follow that night. Let good enough things be.
