At first, I freaked out. 

For obvious reasons.

I'm a woman, and even if I weren't, the sensation of being followed is never good. It started when I was a teenager and coming home from school. At first, I assumed it was just some classmate that had the same route as me. Every time I turned a corner, this shadow would follow. 

However, every time I stopped, they would stop too. 

I didn't want to pay attention too much, you know, because I thought it was a stalker or something, but I started getting so freaked out that I'd periodically stop and look back.

And no one was there. Even when there was no possible place where they could have hidden.

I told my family and friends, and even if I was walking along with them, I'd *still* feel followed, and that went on for years and years. Obviously, after I moved out to a city 1000 miles away, I realized it had to be all in my head. I felt followed even in my own house, all the time.

One night, I had the *brilliant* idea to open my front camera and check behind me. That's when I first saw the creature, and it wasn't pretty. I remember that moment vividly, but after that everything was a blur. I just know therapists and priests couldn't help me and I had to accept this permanent guest in my life.

Besides, it's not like it did anything. Just watched. 

Last month, I had to wake up really early for a flight, but even though I was incredibly tired, I could still make out something was wrong. I don't know how. The air felt different.

I got on the plane and, the whole trip, the watching sensation had stopped. It was almost imperceptible, but I knew, just like you know one of your ears is clogged because your balance is a little off. I thought the creature hadn't managed to get on the plane with me, but even when I returned back home, the *guest* would not make an appearance anymore.

I stopped hearing its footsteps and seeing it with my front camera. I stopped feeling watched, for the first time in 15 years.

Now, some would have been relieved.

Happy, even.

I wasn't.

You know how silence doesn't always have to be comforting? I kept associating this with the calm before the storm. Let me describe it to you: you're walking through a dense forest, loud and full of life. What do you do when the noise stops? When suddenly everything is dead silent?

Do you feel relief?

I didn't. 

Well, the watching sensation started again three days ago, only this time it was more prominent that ever. I didn't necessarily feel relieved, just back to my normal state of ignoring whatever thing had chosen me as its show. I didn't think it would hurt me - it had done this for over 15 years, why start now?

I should have moved on from these thoughts, and yet...

Well, as I said, the sensation was more prominent. 

And so were the footsteps I'd hear behind me, and the breathing. 

I was watching this show on my laptop, and it had a dark scene, the ones where you can see your own reflection in the screen. I stared at my face and at the pale silhouette of my dresser behind me, waiting for the frame to get lit up again so I could finally *make out what was happening.* 

I spun around a bit in my chair. 

... At my desk. In the living room, that had no dresser. 

I paused the show and stared at the white silhouette, then took out my front camera, trying to look behind me.

The creature wasn't there anymore.

At least, not *all* of it.

Just the skin.

Stretched out, the face propped, eyes wide open, like some coat too tight to fit a much larger body. As if something was wearing its skin, with bloodshot eyes, never blinking, fixated on the camera. It had seen I was looking at it, so it looked back, then... smiled.

My instinct was to take a picture, so I did, but it just showed me and nothing behind. I turned around, only to be greeted by the empty room.

Something was wrong. I had forgotten to breathe, and my limbs were numb from fear. Trembling, I stood up and ran, tripping and hitting my knee on the coffee table, I ran like crazy upstairs, to my bedroom, and slammed the door shut. 

For the last three days, I've only walked around the house with my back against a wall, never leaving any space for anyone, or anything, to follow me anywhere. Because, if I know one thing, it's that it always stays *behind* me.

Problem is, I can't keep up with this lifestyle forever, and I think it's waiting for me to turn my back on it.

I've been watched and followed for 15 years and, yet, I have never been so terrified until now.
