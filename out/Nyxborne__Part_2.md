“We got wind of missing sewer workers a few weeks back,” Nathan held the door for me as we entered the warehouse, “Three solo hunters vanished when we sent them in to see what happened.”

“Any idea what it could be?” Going into a hunt blind was dangerous, obviously.

“Something that hides in the dark.”

“So anything?”

The nod I got didn’t help with the knot that was forming in my stomach. 

“Don’t worry, you won’t be going alone,” I froze as Nathan continued walking. He stopped and glanced back at me, “Something wrong?”

I spoke truthfully, “I hate working with people.”

People pissed me off, when hunting I mean. I’m responsible for my actions, for every step I take. If I get hurt, it’s my fault. Other people add more variables to my hunt. Fear, worry, pride and ego. These emotions end up creating bad decisions. Bad decisions put my life at risk, and those decisions weren’t my fault.

“You’ll learn to play nice with others eventually,” Nathan continued forward. The room he led me to did, in-fact, have other hunters inside. Four people. Two men were sitting, talking with each other. I’d never met them. One had blonde hair, with a large scar down his eye. The other had black hair, and a long trench coat covered his shoulders. I noticed a person I’d worked with, a man named Jameson. The sight of him made me feel a little better. He was cold, calculating, and robotic. The exact type of person who wouldn’t make mistakes. The last person was…

“Shit.”

Julia. Her brown hair was tied up in a ponytail, like it always was during hunts. A bandolier clung to the black sweatshirt she covered her armor with. When her eyes met mine, she rolled them and scoffed. Me and Julia had dated a few years back, my only real attempt at a human connection. We hunted together, but she said I was too focused on the hunt, that it consumed me endlessly. We broke up and I hadn’t seen her since.

“You look like crap,” she muttered as I sat at the table.

“Nice to see you too,” I joked, but the ice in her voice told me that things weren’t buddy-buddy.

The projector in the back of the room lit up, and Nathan pointed at the screen with a long stick. 

“As you know, something is residing in the sewers under this town. We don’t know what, but sonar has shown only five bodies, so a humanoid cryptid is off the table.”

I pulled out my notepad and started writing down everything I could think of that would hide in the damp wet cold of a sewer. I noticed Julia doing the same, but she glared at me when she noticed I was staring at her. 

“We’ve identified a clear pipe for you to enter through. You are to find and kill whatever is inside on sight. Do not hesitate. Do not extract it. Kill it and call in a cleanup-team,” Nathan’s instructions were clear, “Understand?”

We nodded and our advisor checked his watch.

“You move out in five, get ready.”

Everyone else stood up, moving to their weapons and gear. I remained seated, staring down at my notes. Whatever was stalking this place, it was different than anything I’d seen. At least, I thought. Almost every monster leaves some kind of trace of their victims. I couldn’t piece together what wouldn’t, especially in a sewer, where everything you’d eat would no doubt taste worse.

Pain flooded my shoulder as someone punched it. I felt a grunt of pain escape my lips and turned to see Julia staring at me.  
“Move it.”

I rubbed the injury, “I dislocated that two weeks ago dick.”

“Is that why your cringe biker jacket is stitched up everywhere?” Her question was an attempt to dig at the insecurities she knew I helped, but I ignored it. I snatched my bag off the ground and followed the group out of the building.

\*\*\*  
The smell of salt flooding my nostrils caused me to sneeze. The ocean sat behind us, a massive gaping pipe in front. Jameson pointed his rifle into the darkness, the tac-light on its muzzle splitting it like the red sea. He moved forward, clearly cautious. I held my shotgun close to me, my other hand gripped a flashlight tight. I could feel my knuckles turning white. A drip of terror was crawling down my spine. I hated going into the unknown.

“What have you been up to for the past few years?” Julia’s whisper nearly sent me through the concrete roof. I swallowed and glanced at her.

“Is now the time for small talk?”

“These guys don’t care,” she rolled her eyes. Her twin pistols were by her side, but I knew she’d have them drawn if we were in trouble.

A shook my head, “Of course these guys don’t care, but do you think whatever is down here does?”

The light of the entrance had vanished behind us. The only illumination came from the beams that shone from our group. I could feel the wetness sloshing by my boots, and the smell made me miss the strong scent of the sea.

“Ah, the job always comes first for you. I forgot.”

“When something down here can kill me in an instant, yes the job comes first.”

She shook her head and I could tell memories of our past were coming to her, “Shame every job you have includes an instant-death monster right.”

Jameson froze, and the rest of us followed his suit. His flashlight beam had hit something, a shape on the ground. It was a blob, pulsating. It almost looked like a booger.

‘Hell’s that?” The blonde asked, his body tensing. I couldn’t answer. It wasn’t any monster I’d seen. Just a pile of flesh that… 

The realization hit me like a truck. It was a person. A melted person kept alive and animated. I whipped around counting our group as fast as I could. Me, James, Julia, Blondie… four. The man with the trench coat was gone, vanished from my sight.

“We need to leave now,” I whispered, pointing my flashlight down an adjoining tunnel.

“What is it,” Julia asked. Her voice wasn’t cold anymore. She was focused. Obviously, when it came down to it, she put the job first as well. Jameson’s back hit mine, pointing his rifle down the tunnel opposite mine. His beam landed on something else. It was trench coat, standing very still. Like a statue. 

His body was dark, skin a crispy grey, cracking. His eyes stared at us, alive, pleading for help. The moment I got a good look, he vanished. It was like a giant train had filled the tunnel, swallowing him completely. It disappeared down the sewer, the slithering that it emitted barely audible. Julia realized it at the same time as the others.

“Basilisk.”

Blondie stared down a hallway and yelled. My head instinctively turned to see the issue, but I felt Julia grab my chin and force it away. I caught sight of Blondie, his skin shifted from its bright tan to a stoney gray. He collapsed into the water, paralyzed, and I could see bubbles floating up from the disgusting green water as he drowned.

A Basilisk isn’t just a snake. It’s a nightmare that learned patience. Long, slick scales the color of oil, until the light hits it, then green and blue shimmer off like gasoline on water. Its eyes glow faintly yellow, and that’s all you’ll get to see before you’re paralyzed. They don’t even have to bite to kill you. One look is enough. Your muscles lock up, skin hardens, and the rest of you follows. You’ll stand like a statue until you die of starvation or thirst. If it bites you after that, it’s just cleanup that melts you into a puddle.

Julia grabbed my arm, pulling me out of thought and alongside her as we tore down the pipe.

Where are we going?” My shout was barely heard over the sound of our footsteps splashing through the sewer. Somewhere behind us, in the maze of water and metal, I heard a hiss of rage. The Basilisk had corralled us away from the entrance we came from, we had no way out. My question wasn’t given any response. Jameson took a sharp right and Julia almost slipped. 

The disadvantage we were at couldn’t be worse. Basilisks are master hunters, their sense of smell granted them a guaranteed trail of pheromones to follow us with. Sticking together was a terrible idea. I snuck a glance over my shoulder, noticing the black wall of scales covering the tunnel. If we wanted a chance of escaping, we had to tear that pheromone trail into three.

At the next intersection, I took a hard right, splitting from the pair. Julia screamed at me, a shout of rage and abandonment. Her emotions were clouding her judgement, all I could do was hope she understood my move. The right I’d taken was a mistake, however. The pipe sloped downward, and I felt my feet give way under my weight. I slipped down the disgusting smelling water, doing my best to not imagine just what was under the surface.

I splashed down into a large room. It was about the size of a gymnasium, the walls reached up about thirty feet in the air. Large circular pillars lined the room in rows, preventing the concrete roof from collapsing in on itself.

I gathered my bearings and pulled myself from the ground. The water was knee deep now, and I could feel it slowing me down as I walked. An exit had to be nearby, otherwise I was screwed. I moved to one of the pillars, holding myself up as I rubbed my head. A splash from where I came from made my heart leap into my chest, and I ducked around the corner. My luck had obviously not turned up as the hissing of the Basilisk came from the water. Of course my smell was different from theirs. Something inhumane would be far tastier than a normal person.

I craned my neck around the corner. The Beast was huge, one of the biggest Basilisks I'd ever seen. It was close to forty feet by my estimation, and about as fat as a car at its widest. The scales pointed into sharp, dark edges off its body, giving it an almost spiky appearance. Horns pierced the skin above its eyes, giving it a sort of crown. *Serpens Regina* was what the weirdos in lab coats called them, the Serpent Queen.

Its head swiveled toward me and I ducked behind the pillar. It knew I was still here. We’d entered a very dangerous game of cat and mouse, and I didn’t have time to set a trap. Without any preparation, running into a Basilisk was a deathtrap, but there was one thing that they hated more than anything…

I realized that my bag had flown off my shoulders when I tumbled down the pipe. All of my stuff was somewhere under the water, probably under the snake itself. Enough firepower could kill one of these, but all I had was a pistol and bullets laced with salt. An idea entered my head, and I pulled an extra mag off my belt. I emptied the bullets into my hand and tossed one across the room. It caused a small splash, and I heard the Basilisk stop moving. It was listening. Their eyesight wasn’t amazing, but their hearing was like a bat. I tossed the rest of the bullets in the same direction. This seemed to confirm my location, and the Basilisk shot toward the water with a speed I didn’t want to think about.

The splashing and hissing it caused as it tore around the pillar was enough to mask the sound of me sloshing to the entrance. I dove into the water, feeling for anything. My hand brushed my bag and I managed to pull it from the murky depths. The beast had noticed my deception, however, and was speeding toward me. I was screwed, my hands wouldn’t wrap around the zipper.

A gunshot rang out. Blood spurted from one of the eyeholes, and the monster roared in pain. Its path barely diverged from me, and I was hit by the knife-like scales on its side. Deep cuts were in my chest and arm, but I ignored the pain. Jameson had appeared in another entrance to the room, his rifle poised and ready. With another shot, the Basilisk was blinded. It was distracted again as a molotov burst on its back. Flames licked the side of the monster as it tried to focus on Julia, who had appeared in another tunnel.

I dug through my bag, finally reaching the Tupperware I kept inside. A small path of rue, a herb from Europe. Basilisks couldn’t stand the feeling of it. I rubbed a bunch on my knife and sprinted toward the monster, which had crashed into the wall by Julia. It heard my splashing and charged toward me. Its mouth opened, and I was met with thousands of needle-like-teeth, lined in rows of death that called for me.

I jumped over the death trap, throwing the herb-covered knife into the tongue of the snake. It hacked and spit blood, shaking its head in an attempt to relieve its mouth of the taste. Its tail slammed into a pillar and cracks started to form in it. Another idea formed, and I shot at the monster to draw its attention. 

“Hey, over here!” My shouts echoed through the room. With a hiss of rage, the Basilisk was upon me again. I could see the black saliva it had in its mouth. Like a bull fighter, I jumped out of the way, booking it back toward the pillar. The snake rounded the corner, charging at me. Its smell had been thrown off by the rue, so I screamed to keep its attention. I stood with the pillar to my back, pressing into my clothes. If this didn’t work, I would be swallowed whole in an instant. The Basilisk was charging again, moving as fast as its legless body would carry it. Right before it devoured me, I jumped, pulling my legs to my chest to make myself as small as possible.

My plan worked, and the Basilisk’s jaws passed right over and under me. The tunnel shook as it crashed into the pillar, sending shards of concrete everywhere. I landed on its tongue, rolling out of its maw before it could recover from the concussion it’d given itself. The Basilisk tried to escape, turning to slither away, but the pain it was in impeded it completely. I spun to the other side of the pillar, pushing it with all my might. The huge slab of concrete fell, tumbling straight onto the head of the snake. There was a crunch and a splatter of black blood as the Basilisk’s skull was crushed, sending brain matter into the water around it.  For a minute, the body of the snake writhed, but with the neck still stuck under the slab of rock, it couldn’t escape. The Basilisk’s body finally died, and an empty silence filled the sewer again.

I climbed on top of the pillar, sitting myself down and taking a breath. The adrenaline had worn off and the slices in my chest had begun to stain my shirt with blood. More pain entered my cheek when Julia slapped me.

“So you just bail from the group? Leave us for dead?”

I rubbed my face in dismay, “Are you serious? I saved all our asses just now. Did you have any rue in your pocket?”

“Yeah right!” She yelled. Her face was turning pink, “Like you weren’t just ‘eliminating variables’ because we’re too emotional for a hunt. You left for yourself.”

“We would’ve all died if we kept running together-”

“Is that why you left, or is it because you didn’t want to have to rely on someone else?”

She jumped back into the water and headed for a tunnel. Jameson looked at me and shrugged. I hated being scolded, but deep down I felt her words touch something in me. Maybe I hid my choice as a tactical decision, but maybe I did run because I was scared. Maybe I didn’t want to rely on them for my safety. I slid off the concrete and wiped the thoughts from my mind.

I followed Jameson down the tunnel as we began to search for a way out of the sewer.
