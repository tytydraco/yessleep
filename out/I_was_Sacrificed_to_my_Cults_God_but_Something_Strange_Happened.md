To give some backstory before everything happened, yes I was a part of a cult. The cult from what I knew, never had live sacrifices. They’d burn food and what not for their ‘God’ but that was it. Looking back on it now, they probably did have live sacrifices. I joined the cult because a few friends I had met in college were a part of it. After hearing them talk about it, I thought the cult wasn’t so bad. I was dead wrong, but it was too late by the time I found that out.

I am ashamed I was even a part of the cult, but at that time in my life, I was in a terrible head-space and wanted a place I could lean on and confide in. The cult offered just that for me. They listened to my problems and offered their support. They didn’t judge me for things I did and things I experienced; instead they told me their ‘*God’* would help me. At first, I wasn’t really there for belief in their *‘God*’, but after a while, I began praying to it and I did start feeling better mentally. 

I was part of the cult for almost a year and I never noticed anything off. I should’ve paid more attention; who knows how many people were sacrificed in the name of their ‘God’. The guilt from that still clings to me to this day. Anyways, sorry for dragging this on, but I wanted everyone to get a clear understanding about how I became part of the cult. It all happened on the night of a lunar eclipse in 2015. 

Earlier that day, I was messaged by one of my friends that was a part of the cult to come later than usual. I was curious as to why they wanted me to come later, but I figured maybe it was a surprise birthday party. Stupid, I know, but the cult made a point to celebrate birthdays. So like my friend said, I arrived at the place the cult met later than what I normally did. When I walked through the doors, a bag was placed over my head.

This naturally startled me until I heard my friend say, “It’s just me, I’m taking you to the other room.”

I just thought that they really wanted to keep it a surprise so I didn’t resist. I only started getting nervous and scared when I began hearing the chants from the cult members. They only recited those chants when they offered up their food as homage to their ‘God’. Naturally I had asked my friend what was going on, but they were silent. I resisted against them but other hands grabbed me.

I screamed and screamed and moved however I could, but it was no use. It wasn’t long before they had me upon a table with ropes tied to my arms and legs. Regardless of that, I still tried to move. The chanting quieted down and the cult leader’s voice rang out, “Brothers and Sisters! What a blessed night for us! This poor lost lamb will be the final sacrifice to release our lord from his imprisonment!”

Cheers erupted from the other members as the bag from my head was removed.

I stared up at the cult leader’s face in fear. His smile seemed so genuine despite him holding a dagger in his hand.

“Please, why are you doing this? Why me?” I asked.

He patted my head, “Lost lamb, our lord has done so much for you, it is time to repay his kindness. Our lord has chosen you to be his final sacrifice, you should rejoice!”

Tears built in my eyes, nothing I said would convince them otherwise. After my silence, he motioned to the members and they began their chants once more. I cried and struggled against my confines more, cutting into my flesh to try to escape. The cult leader walked to the fire in the center of the room and placed the dagger’s blade in it. He began chanting as well. 

He walked back to me, “Lord we offer this lost lamb to you! May you accept this sacrifice and be released from your chains!”

As soon as he said those words, he plunged the dagger into my chest. The pain was horrible but quick. I felt myself grow cold as my vision blackened. *Why? Why me? How could this happen? I don’t want to die! Please! Someone! Something! Save me!* These thoughts rushed through my mind, not expecting an answer in return,

“***Poor lost lamb, I shall grant you what you wish for***”

Next thing I knew, I was waking up on that table, no longer bound by rope. I sat up and looked at the horrible sight around me. All of the cult members were dead. I looked down at my chest and noticed that there was no wound where the dagger was, just blood that coated my shirt and skin. 

Naturally, I was taken aback by this, I mean, I should be dead, but here I am. It was then that I felt a faint presence inside me. A presence that resembled the one that I felt before I *‘died’*. Was this the *‘God’* the cult spoke of? The presence felt dark and sinister; it made me sick. Once I found my legs, I stumbled back to my apartment in a daze. 

I refused to go outside for weeks; I couldn’t trust anybody and I was scared of what had taken residence in my body. I drove myself crazy trying to search for the identity of the being the cult worshiped, but I couldn’t find anything. It wasn’t until my brother showed up at my apartment, worried to death, that I decided to try and forget about the presence and what it was. But, that was easier said than done. No matter what I did, I felt its presence observing me and the outside world. 

It almost felt as if it was trying to understand the world around it before it made its move. Not to mention, no matter what happens, I never get hurt or sick. I was involved in a car crash in 2018 where I should’ve died, but I was alive without a scratch on me. Later on, in 2019, I was mugged at gunpoint. The person who mugged me went to take off across the road and was hit by a truck that came out of nowhere. 

I know some of you might think it was just a coincidence that the mugger was hit by a vehicle, but I’m positive it was the presence that caused it to happen. After that, I cut contact from most people except for my mom and brother. Thankfully, nothing had happened to them. For whatever reason, it is ensuring that I’m not harmed in any way. Anyways after the mugging incident, I began researching it once more. 

I searched scriptures of ancient civilizations, delved into mythology and religion, and even talked with theologians and mythologists. The only thing those experts and I found was a tablet that spoke of an ancient being sealed over a millennia ago. Since then, I’ve been searching even more diligently about this being since it is the closest thing to this ‘God’ the cult had worshiped. 

Whatever this thing is, I think I became its vessel when I was sacrificed. My research has come to a stalemate as of recently, there is nothing left for me to dig into. That is why I'm here, if any of you have any information concerning this, I’d love to hear it. I do feel guilty, however, because even as I’m writing this, I can feel it observing me and what I’m doing. I have no idea if it’ll do something or if it can do something, but I can’t continue on in constant fear like this.

Again, if you have information, no matter how small, please tell me. I, at the very least, want to know what this presence, this ‘God’ is. Especially since it has not revealed itself to me at all, even in a dream. I guess I would also like to add, don’t trust people blindly, you may end up in horrible situations. After all, this all started because I met some ‘friends’ in college.
