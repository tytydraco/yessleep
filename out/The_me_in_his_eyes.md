I really liked to bully the weird kid of my class. I could try to justify it by saying i thought if i bullied him enough for his weird behavior then he might try to become normal but honestly i just really liked tormenting him. My fav part was that after toying with him i would get close to his face and there in his fearful eyes i would see myself with a pretty evident smile. It's not like i don't know when am smiling but that thing just really gave me a lot of satisfaction. Hell i used to tie him up just so i could do that easily.

The thing is he never really retaliated for what i did to him and i just didn't like that. He just accepted whatever i did to him but what i really wanted was for him to struggle a bit, to try and stop me. Why you ask? because there's special kind of pleasure u get from breaking someone who's trying their best to do something but can't. No matter how much i would see my smile i always felt the absence of that pleasure. I tried all kind of things but didn't succeed.

Then one day i got my hands on something magical- His last gift from his parents. At least that's what he told me but i thought he was lying cuz why would he bring something so important to school when he knows am there. Oh yeah his parents died 2 years ago trying to save him in an accident and people said that's what made him weird but i don't believe that's how things work cuz i never had any such "traumatic" experience but still i was twisted like that.

What made that thing magical was that when i took it from him he tried to take it back. I beat him up and then tied him. For like half an hour i was dangling that thing in front of him with him begging to return it back and it felt like the best day of my life. And what better day to end with a bang so that's what i did . The moment i smashed that thing to pieces was when his begging face changed to one full of hate and in his eyes i could see myself not smiling...but laughing.

That evening as i was returning home, i felt a huge impact at the back of my head and when i turned the last thing i saw before blacking out was his emotionless face. The next morning when i woke up i didn't feel any pain for a injury that knocked me out but still he deserved punishment even if i wasn't in pain. I was really sad though because i just couldn't think of anything to punish him that could top what i did yesterday. And then i spotted that mf walking straight towards me and was honestly surprised by the lack of fear. As he got closer i thought maybe direct eye contact would intimidate him, so i looked in those emotionless eyes and saw...nothing. And then it really dawned on me.

Honestly i smiled at that moment because i made the weirdo act like how a normal person would.
