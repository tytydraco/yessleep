It started small, as unsettling things, things  I would have ignored if they had come and gone. But while they arrived  one at a time, they didn’t leave, even when I prayed.

It started with the new dog. Oh, it wasn’t her fault I suppose, but she was the first thing to change. Before then it  had been routine. My husband and I lived next door to my grandfather,  bought the house there so we could take care of him. It was down a  country road, no sidewalks or streetlamps, barely paved, but it was  nice. We were out of the way, but it was only a 40-minute drive to the  city, which meant Frank didn’t have to commute far to work.

Out of the way, though, meant a long response  time from emergency services. So we never wanted to leave Papi alone for  too long, in case he fell or needed something, even at night when he  didn’t do much but stare at the TV. So Frank bought us a telescope,  something we could setup in the backyard. In that uncertain present,  with its pandemics and wars and death lingering next door, watching the  vault of heaven go by like beautiful clockwork was a comfort.

Standing out in that dark, away from  everything else, was when we noticed there were sometimes strange  headlights at night, cruising up and down our little country road,  moving with unknown purpose. Moving a little too fast to be lost, a  little too slow to be without a destination.

But we had our old, trusty schnauzer then, big  and black and with a bark like Cerberus. That’s what we called him,  kind of as a joke, but he made things easier. Whenever we let him out,  he’d run next door to check on Papi, and whenever there was a strange  noise around the house at night, Cerberus was always the first to  investigate. Maybe a little too loudly, but that thunderous bark could  make you feel safe if you weren’t sure what was on the other side of a  door.

Papi lived longer than Cerberus, though, and  long enough still that Frank and I missed having a dog. We adopted a  mongrel that we named Cyan because of her startlingly blue eyes. She was  part German Shepherd, too, so we figured she’d make a good guard dog.

She wasn’t, though. In fact, she was terrible  at it. If left off leash she would go bounding into the thick, dark  woods around our house, barking bloody murder at whatever squirrel or  deer or God knows what else she had seen. Frank and I spent hours in  those first few weeks trying to track her down every time she bolted.

That’s probably why Papi didn’t like Cyan from  the start. She didn’t come over to check on him like Cerberus did, but  dragged us away. After a time, he even refused to have Cyan in his  house, saying that with her red coat and blue eyes she looked like some  kind of skinless horse and he didn’t like the way she stared at him.

Now, Papi lived in the South, and by the time  Mami died there was no getting him out of there, so that’s where we  moved to take care of him. Plenty of nice things about the South, just  like everywhere else, but there’s bad things too, just like everywhere  else. One good thing they always say, and I think maybe a lie, is that  people in the South are oh so friendly. It may be friendliness to some,  and maybe it’s because I wasn’t born here, but it doesn’t feel like  friendliness to me. More like watching for trouble. After all, it seems  like everyone has a gun these days, particularly in the South, and if  you smile and wave at someone, and they smile and wave back, it at least  feels like they’re less likely to shoot you.

So when a strange man started to wander down  our road, with its dusty pavement between the tall grass, I smiled and  waved at him. He as tall and lanky with a rangy movement like there was  an unsteady musical beat only he could hear. Whatever song he heard, he  muttered to himself too loud to ignore, but quiet enough that you  couldn’t make out the words. His dark skin absorbed the twilight rays of  the Carolina sky and his eyes never settled on anything. It was that  last part that made me think he didn’t see me wave, so I waved again  when we passed each other, close enough that he couldn’t miss it. In a  flagrant breach of protocol, though, not only didn’t wave, but he didn’t  stop his meandering song, or look in my direction.

Cyan clearly didn’t approve of this and, when  we got close, lunged at him in a barking strain at the leash. There was a  viciousness to it that was surprising, even to me, and I felt like I  could hear the bays of every hound that had run slaves to ground. I was  mortified by that image, and I stammered out an apology. The stranger  and his music, though, kept walking along with a dead-eyed stare that  made me wonder if he wasn’t blind.

Which is fine, that’s OK, what’s one weirdo in  a world full of them, and maybe Cyan’s barking was just a good judge of  character. We’d run into the blind, black singer every few days, and to  my embarrassment, Cyan’s reaction was always the same, and I wondered  what fear lay at the root it. Was she reading my own discomfort at this  strange, unrelatable man?

One night at dusk, I took her for a quick walk  while Frank set up the telescope and I saw the tall music man mumbling  to himself down the road. I stuck to the other side, didn’t even bother  to wave, but just as we were getting close to passing him, those strange  headlights blazed from the top of the road. They were as bright as  spotlights and, when I raised a hand to shield my eyes, Cyan barked and  lunged at the man. She went at him with such ferocity I was barely able  to hold on. Rambling in the dark, the man didn’t notice, just kept on  walking, even as the car raced down the road between us. I couldn’t see  beyond its headlights even as I heard a yelp from Cyan.

When I screamed, Frank abandoned the telescope  and we got Cyan to an emergency vet. She was fine, in the end, lost a  few teeth and broke a paw, but I didn’t walk her anymore without making  sure music man wasn’t around and it was still light enough that those  headlights couldn’t be seen.

So we started to take Cyan out on leash while  we watched through the telescope. It wasn’t as peaceful as before, with  her barking at the dark of the woods, but it was better than waiting for  those lights to come down with a driver that couldn’t be bothered to  stop for any living thing. But then Frank lost his job and started to  drink at the beginning of our stargazing sessions and became impatient  with the turning of the firmament.

Cyan seized on that and slipped her leash  every chance she got, bounding out into the trees, yipping away at  whatever she saw out there. It got to a point where Frank would just sit  on his lawn chair and refuse to go after her, and I was too afraid to  go out into the dark of the woods alone. Cyan would come back,  eventually, though, covered in dirt and brambles and panting a happy  grin at the chase she had given.

Until she didn’t. One night after she had  pulled her escape artist act, she didn’t come back. I waited and  screamed out into the dark for her, but she didn’t return. The only  thing that came back was a howling that I told myself was her chasing  prey. But it didn’t sound like her. Or any other animal I’d ever heard  for that matter. After awhile, I told myself that I had lost my patience  with that ungrateful mongrel, and put an arm around Frank to help him  up. Truth be told, though, with whatever was howling out in the woods, I  didn’t want to leave Frank outside.

I got up at first light to go search for Cyan,  but she was waiting at the porch door. I was relieved at her  appearance, until I saw all of the blood she had trailed with her.  Confusion and concern pushed me outside to find her barely moving on the  deck. Whatever had happened out there in the woods that night had left a  long, jagged gash the length of her ribcage, deep enough that you could  see bone in places, even through the matted fur.

If we had neighbors, my scream would have woke  every one of them. Frank and even Papi stumbled out and between my  panic, Frank’s hangover, and Papi’s feebleness, we managed to make  enough of a person to get Cyan back to the hospital. The vet was a  competent woman who got Cyan stitched up, but afterward she gave me a  suspicious look, like one might a parent who said their child fell down  some stairs. She told me she had never seen any kind of claw mark like  the one that had tore into Cyan.

After that, Cyan doesn’t leave the yard  anymore, just runs around its edges and barks into the woods at things I  can’t see. I’m not as young as when we first arrived and my eyesight  isn’t as good as it was those years ago, but I don’t think it matters.  There’s something in those woods circling our home and I can feel it  just as much as Cyan can.

We don’t watch the night sky anymore, but just for prowling headlights on the road, [and the darkness of the woods](https://matthewcmclean.com/).
