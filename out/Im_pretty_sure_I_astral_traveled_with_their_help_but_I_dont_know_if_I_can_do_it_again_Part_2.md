Alright, listen. I’m running on fumes here—no sleep, no clarity, just fragments of whatever this world has left me with. I could’ve given you more, sure. More details, more answers, more *certainty.* But that’s not the story I have for you right now. This is what happened so far. It's messy, it’s raw, and maybe it doesn’t all make sense yet. But I’ll keep writing. I’ll figure it out. And when I do, you’ll know. Stay tuned.

I spent hours setting up the damn thing. The mirrors were angled with precision, the lasers crisscrossed like a brilliant web, and the cameras were stationed so their lenses formed a mandala, blooming in shades of red and white. It was mesmerizing—beautiful, even, in a terrifying way. When I powered it on, the flickering started. 

My hands, my feet—they dissolved in and out like static on an old screen. It was working, or at least it looked like it was, but something about it felt off. I wasn’t leaving. The room stayed put, though I could feel this raw, relentless pull, something primally wrong. 

That’s when it hit me—it wasn’t pulling my body. It was pulling me. My essence, my core, my consciousness—call it what you want. The machine had locked onto it like a predator, and there wasn’t a damn thing I could do to stop it. 

Crossing over felt like stepping into a dream where all the rules have been rewritten. The street ran the same direction, the houses lined up as expected, but nothing was right. The familiar had warped—the neighbor’s picket fence was no longer white but a charred, splintered black, the trees shimmered with unnatural silver leaves, and my house, the same shape and structure, was cloaked in a deep, wet red with a porch light that flickered like it was gasping for air. 

My hands flickered too, cycling between transparency and solidity, like I was on the edge of existing. It made me nauseous. And that tooth—I knew it was the source of all this. I remembered how alive it felt when I first pulled it from that black, viscous mass, the way it pulsed as if it had a heartbeat of its own. 

My fingers shot to my pocket, panicked, and there it was. That jagged edge, glowing faintly green and yellow like something that shouldn’t exist. For a moment, relief. But then the thought hit me: if this tooth could do all this, what else could it do? That fear was real, but so was the pull—forward, always forward. 

The streets felt like they were holding their breath. I saw her then, a woman walking ahead. For a flicker of a second, I felt relief, but when she turned, her eyes locked onto me, and she swung her bag. No sound, no impact, but pain ripped through my side, sharp and cutting. 

I stumbled back, clutching at the air, but she didn’t stop or acknowledge me. Her body moved like I wasn’t even there. It wasn’t her. It was something else—her spirit, her essence. 

Whatever it was, it knew I didn’t belong, and it wasn’t happy about my presence. I kept moving, though it felt like every step hollowed me out further. I pushed into a house to test how solid I was, I clearly didn’t have a physical body but a ghostly one. It worked. 

Inside was worse. A woman crouched in the corner, clutching her son. Her body stayed frozen, afraid, but her spirit—her spirit was locked onto me, bristling with a fear so sharp and suffocating it was almost hostile. It made my chest tighten, and I backed away, rattled to my core. 

The rules here weren’t just bent—they were broken, and I wasn’t sure how much longer I could keep bending with them. My hand slipped into my pocket, grasping the jagged tooth. “Take me to the twins,” I muttered, not even knowing why I said it or thought it could work. It’s like my subconscious was half taking the lead, like I knew the rules of this all somewhere deep down inside.

Now, this is hard to describe, but I will do my best to describe it in a way that will make sense to you guys.

The world changed again—trees swaying though there was no wind, roots curling as if they had minds of their own, and whispers that didn’t belong to me. I pushed through willows that seemed alive and stepped into a field of lilies so tall and unnatural it made my skin crawl. 

The light around me wouldn’t stay steady—flipping between day and night in rapid pulses. My spirit warped in ways that didn’t feel like mine anymore. 

By the time I stumbled onto a beach, I was unraveling. The sand beneath me was slick and cold, more like flesh than stone, and scattered with bodies. They weren’t rocks—they were husks. Human husks. Their hollowed faces were familiar—friends, neighbors, people I’d loved once. My mother. The air tightened around me, and as I passed them, one of the bodies twitched. Its head turned toward me with agonizing slowness, dragging time itself along with it. That’s when I saw them—the pyramids. They rose out of the water, towering and bone-white, gleaming as though they were alive. I should’ve looked away. I knew I should’ve.

I woke up back in my room. The mirrors, the lasers, the cameras—they were all still there, still angled just right, though everything looked... strained. The lasers flickered, the mirrors had shifted like they had to fight to keep the portal open. 

And me? I was still standing. Somehow. I felt it right away—the exhaustion. Not just tired, but hollowed out, like something vital had been drained from me. I stepped over to the mirror, caught my reflection, and there it was. A new streak of gray in my hair. I almost laughed. The joke writes itself, doesn’t it? You build a machine to cross into another dimension, and you come back older, weaker—probably dying. 

But I still had it. The tooth. My hand went straight to my pocket, and there it was—solid, warm, pulsing faintly like it had a life of its own. That thing got me there and brought me back, but the cost... well, I’m still figuring that part out. While I was there—God, where do I even start? What I’ve told you is nothing compared to what it really was. 

That place... it doesn’t make sense. It doesn’t translate. My brain can barely hold onto pieces of it, fragments that don’t fit together. The streets, the people—or what I thought were people—it all felt like some terrible dream. And the pyramids rising from the water, the bodies pulled toward them... I still can’t shake the image. They told me—the creatures, the ones I saw there—that humans don’t last long in their world. Our bodies weren’t built for it. We’re batteries, they said, and batteries only hold so much charge. Ten minutes, maybe less. I was there longer, but only because the machine and the tooth pushed the limit. I don’t even know how long I had—an hour, maybe? Two? Long enough to feel like I was coming apart. But I understand now. 

That place... it isn’t random. It isn’t chaos. There’s a system, rules I haven’t pieced together yet, but I will. And when I go back—and I will go back—I won’t walk into it blindly. Not this time. First, I need rest. A day or two to pull myself together, recharge. Then I’ll start looking for answers. The creatures—they’re the key. I need to know what they want, what they offer, and what they’re hiding. No deals, but a way to find Sarah. This isn’t over. Not by a long shot.
