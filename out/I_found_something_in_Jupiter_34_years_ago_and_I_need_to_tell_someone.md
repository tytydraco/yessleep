So for context, I am a former astronaut, in fact, I am retiring in 3 months since I am turning 60. I am keeping my name anonymous since if this information actually gets out, it would be really bad for my name since I am a quite well-known in the NASA and in my own departments. When I was 26 years old I had my first ever out of earth trip to Jupiter which is a quite difficult planet to go. There are tons of requirements physically, intellectually and mentally. You need to have a very eminent understanding of all the gadgets and switches in the spaceship. You need to have an outstandingly strong memorization skills. Going to Jupiter requires you to be in the spaceship for at least 3,000 days. And you need to be extremely fit, we actually have this very difficult fitness test for all the contestants. This is where most people fail to pass. 

 Growing up, I was always an overachiever. I topped in every class, I was an honor student and also graduated 2 years early. I love challenging myself and I was really hard to join NASA. I was actually the youngest person to join NASA! Anyways, In 1986, I was on board. With 4 of my shipmates and we were very ready. The journey was as expected. By the 1643th day we arrived. Jupiter have this bright crimson surface which was made of calcium nitride. It was very soft and squishy. There are plenty of holes in this crimson planet that leads you to the lower levels of the planet. The air was heavy with dusts flowing around preventing you from seeing 10 ft in front of you.


 Our goal was to find specific rocks and take them back to do experiments. Our professor strictly told us to not collect, explore or touch anything out of the requirements. 

 We were done with finding all the rocks 3 days before expected, leaving us 3 days for doing nothing at the planet. I decided to wander off and do down one of those holes that brings me to the lower levels. Our professor also strictly told us not to, that’s our number 1 rule. There was even more dusts flowing around on the lower levels but with my special goggles allowing me to see. The holes led to more holes under and across. I walk through the holes on the ‘walls’ on the level I landed in. The walls and ground was very dark the lower you get. 


 I caught a glimpse of something very shiny and black, an obsidian-like color. Its surface looked very thin yet slippery like one of those plastic wraps. Yet it looks so wet and liquid like. These things move moderately fast, faster than us though. They won’t have facial features, just this one hole in the middle of their bloated stomachs. They are thin and slim, about 8 foot. They have these high pitch voices which sounds like cats. Their holes would squirt this metallic silver liquid as they move. Along the floor as paths telling us where they are. I follow this thing deeper and deeper in the lower levels, being careful to not step on or touch any of these liquids. They look so shiny and with something like oil on it’s surface. 

 I followed this thing for about at least half a mile until I finally slip and fell with my whole body in the liquid. The liquid have a weird gravitational force that makes it so hard for me to get us. The dusts are thicker and thicker as we got lower. That’s when I decided to back out. 

I got back to the spaceship to see my friends falling dead asleep. I went to the toilet to change out of my slimy metallic suit to a new one. Then I went to sleep. 


I woke up to one of my shipmates yelling, it was Mark. Apparently he had slip on the liquid thing on my suit that was on the floor. He was 2/7 covered with the thing. I volunteered to clean it off the toilet while he wash them off. I could see the liquid thing on his bare skin. I told him it’s just the toilet cleaner wash. While cleaning up, my bare hands accidentally touched the liquid thing. It felt like a sharp pain had strike through my blood veins. I shrugged it off but deep down I was terrified to thing about it. 

About 2 months after our landing back to earth. Mark have been showing signs of hallucinations. He claims that there are these parasites moving in his body and in his blood. He vomited the liquid thing a bunch of times and claim to see a shiny black thing about 1 inches in his vomit. It keeps coming from 1 then 2 then 3 everytime he vomits. He swore they are alive in his body and that they’re eating his organs.  He went to the doctors just to find that nothing is wrong. Until one day he loses it and tried hurting himself. He was sent to the mental hospital… it was actually a very well known news in the nineties. When a bunch of people from his facility reported the same pain as his and vomiting the liquid. It was blown off as some weird contagious disease from Mark when he went to this cave in Arizona. He actually went there right after the landing. They theorized that it was from one of the animals in the cave. 

Back to 2022, yesterday I felt a sharp pain traveling through my blood,like a needle-like thing is in my blood. Exactly as how Mark described his pain. I don’t know who tell and I don’t want to be responsible for what happens to mark and the people there. I doubt anyone would believe me anyways. 

This morning I threw up for the first time. I can’t find the black thing Mark described yet but I am terrified. The pain isn’t getting better. What should I do??
