I never thought I would become a victim of the internet. I always thought of it as a safe place, a place where I could connect with friends and escape from the real world. But now, as I sit here in the dark, cold basement, I can't help but regret ever logging on.

My name is Tyler, and this is my story.

It all started when I received a message from an old friend. We had lost touch years ago, but he had found me on a social media platform and reached out to catch up. At first, I was excited to reconnect. But as we talked, something about his tone seemed off.

He asked me strange, personal questions, probing into my life and my habits. And when I asked him about himself, he always seemed to deflect or change the subject. It was as if he was trying to learn everything about me, while revealing nothing about himself.

I should have cut ties then and there. But I was lonely, and the attention was flattering. And so, I ignored my gut and continued talking to him.

It wasn't until he asked to meet in person that I realized the full extent of his obsession. He had been stalking me online, learning everything about me and my daily routine. And now, he wanted to take our relationship to the next level.

I tried to back out, but it was too late. He had already planned everything, booking a hotel room and promising me a romantic weekend away. And so, against my better judgment, I agreed to meet him.

When I arrived at the hotel, he was waiting for me in the lobby. He looked different in person, older and more sinister. And as he led me to the room, I could feel a sense of dread wash over me.

Once inside, he locked the door and revealed his true intentions. He was a collector, he said, and I was his latest acquisition. He had been following me online for months, learning everything about me and my life. And now, he was going to keep me locked in his basement, where I would be his forever.

I tried to fight back, but he was too strong. And so, I was forced to watch as he transformed his basement into a prison, installing bars on the windows and setting up surveillance cameras.

Days turned into weeks, and I lost all sense of time. He brought me food and water, but otherwise left me alone in the dark. And as the weeks went by, I could feel myself slipping further and further into despair.

But then, one day, I heard a knock on the door. It was faint at first, barely perceptible over the sound of my own breathing. But as I listened, it grew louder and more insistent.

I called out for help, hoping against hope that someone would hear me. And to my surprise, someone did. The door burst open, and a team of police officers rushed in, guns drawn.

It turned out that my old friend had been on the radar of law enforcement for years, a serial stalker who had abducted and imprisoned countless women in his basement. And as they led me to safety, I couldn't help but wonder how many other victims were out there, trapped or worse, I was lucky.
