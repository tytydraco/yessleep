As  I watched the waves crashing against the deck of the fishing boat, I  couldn't help but feel a sense of unease. The storm had been raging for  days, and we had been stuck in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean with no  land in sight. The rest of the crew was on edge as well, but we all knew  we had to keep our wits about us if we wanted to make it back to shore  alive.

It was on the fourth day of  our fishing expedition that I felt a tug on my line, a welcoming feel  after the long period of stillness. At first, I thought it was just  another big catch, but as I began to reel it in, I knew there was  something different about this one. The weight on the end of the line  was much heavier than anything I had ever caught before, and I began to  wonder if I had snagged a shark or a small whale. The movements were  different too, instead of the usual thrashing and fighting I would feel  at the end of my line, it was simply… dragging down.

As  the creature emerged from the depths, my heart sank. It was like  nothing I had ever seen before… a twenty-foot-long, worm-like thing as  thick as my forearm, resembling some kind of Polychaeta, with long  tendrils and tentacles sticking out of its body, and hundreds of tiny  eyes covering its flesh. The rest of the crew gathered around, staring  in horror at the thing at the end of my line, writhing and thrashing. We  knew we had to get rid of it, but we didn't want to just toss it back  into the ocean, it was snagged on my line, and none of us were even  going near it. Despite my best attempt at putting it into words, the  creature looked nothing like I had ever seen in decades of fishing the  Atlantic… something about it looked off.

Otherworldly.

Who knows what kind of damage it could do?

As  we stood there, debating what to do, the creature suddenly let out a  spine-chilling screech. It sounded like the wail of a thousand tortured  souls, and it sent shivers down my spine. I could feel the fear rising  within me, and I knew we had to act fast. The creature lashed out,  wrapping themselves tightly around my arms and legs as I slammed against  the slippery deck. I tried to pull away, but its grip was too strong,  the strength insane for such a thin creature. It began to drag me  towards the edge of the boat, and I knew that if I went overboard, I was  done for.

The rest of the crew  sprang into action, trying to pry the creature's tentacles away from me.  But it was no use - they were too strong. I could feel the creature's  cold, slimy skin against my own, and I knew that this was it.

This was how I was going to die.

Someone  suddenly fired a flare gun, the bright orange burst sinking into the  creature's flesh as                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      I scrambled away, panting and shaking, as the rest of the crew  huddled together, staring at the creature in horror.

For  a few minutes, we all just stood there, catching our breath and staring  at the creature in disbelief. It was still writhing and squirming, but  it didn't seem to be interested in us anymore. It was almost as if it  had accomplished what it had set out to do - to terrify us, to show us  that it was in control. And so, against my better judgment, I approached  it once more. As I drew closer, the creature's slimy skin seemed to  glisten in the dim light, and its tentacles twisted and turned in a  hypnotic dance. I couldn't take my eyes off of it.

And then, suddenly, it *changed.*

"What the fuck," I gasped.

The  creature's flesh burst, and as if it was molting, the skin fell off of  it, and a larger, fleshier mass of living tissue unfolded from the  shell, expanding and growing until it was the size of a full-grown man.  Its skin had grown darker, and it was dripping with a black viscous  liquid, with its entire head wrapped in the body of a disgusting ocean  worm, hundreds of feet and appendages digging into the monster's flesh.  The new humanoid monster stood in front of us, its gaze burning my soul  as I looked into the water beyond us.

The storm had rolled back in, and the ocean looked like hell.ENORMOUS  black shapes were moving under the surface of the water, and [creatures of ungodly size](https://www.reddit.com/r/SeasideUniverse/comments/mjn4ot/the_complete_seaside_trilogytimeline_in_order/) broke the surface as they surrounded out minuscule  fishing boat.

"We're heading back," our captain said. "Before the ocean [takes us."](https://www.reddit.com/r/SeasideUniverse/comments/xyitrx/the_ninth_circle_preview_while_working_on_several/)
