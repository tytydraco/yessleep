The chariot flew down the hill, a wall of billowing flame and smoke rising thousands of feet into the air behind it, as if a hydrogen bomb had exploded and was expanding forward towards me at a slowed-down pace. On the chariot stood a demon ten feet tall, with blazing red skin, pure black eyes and horns poking out of the top of his head, looking curved and white just like those of a ram. Around him, smaller demons about as tall as a regular man jumped and screamed in exhilaration, grinning from ear to ear while they looked around with excitement, some of them speaking rapidly to each other in a deep, gurgling tongue I had never heard before.

The main demon bellowed, shaking the ground as he put his arms into the air, looking straight up into the sky and smiling. A circle of fire shot out from his chariot, expanding rapidly and burning up every building and shrub it touched in the abandoned desert town.

Looking behind me, I saw the deep indentation where a river had once run through the town, during wetter times before the never-ending drought affecting our Western area of the USA. Without thinking, I jumped in, shielding my head and ducking down. The wall of fire soared above me, burning my hair and the back of my shirt. I heard screaming nearby as men and women in white lab coats or black suits burned alive. I closed my eyes and tried to block it out.

While I lay on the ground, crouching into a ball and shutting my eyes tightly, I thought about how I had ended up in this situation, cursing my now dead girlfriend who convinced us to come out here on a sight-seeing trip.

\*\*\*

“Markey,” Katherine said, smiling sweetly, “I am so excited to see that old ghost town on the edge of the desert- the one they used to call Saddle Ranch Springs.” I hated it when my girlfriend called me Markey instead of just Mark. “Will you be ready in twenty minutes?” I grunted in response.

“Is that a yes or a no?” she asked. Sighing, I turned to her and smiled slightly.

“OK, fine,” I said hesitantly. She sprung up, clapping in happiness and ran upstairs to get ready. As soon as she had asked about it, I knew I was going. I could never say no to Katherine. While she got dressed and put on make-up, I finished cooking breakfast and making coffee for both of us, wondering exactly what could be so exciting about seeing a ghost town that had been dead for over a hundred years.

“Katherine, are you almost ready to eat?” I yelled up the stairs. She mumbled something I could barely hear that sounded like a yes. As I waited for her, my phone rang. Looking down, I saw that the number was marked “Private”. I answered, putting it up to my ear.

“Hello?” I said. At first there was just a mechanical cacophony, like shrieking metal overlaying clicking and whirring noises, then someone started screaming in the background. It sounded like a woman being burned alive or tortured. A deep, gravelly voice began to speak.

“Do not go to the place where the Saddle Ranch massacre began,” it said. “It will end with death. But not for you, Mark. Some things are worse than death.” Then suddenly the line went dead. I looked down at the smartphone in my hand, confused, but I shrugged and put it away. I wondered if my friend Rooster was playing some kind of prank on me, as he knew we were all going to the abandoned town today.

After we were ready, Katherine and I left to go pick up Rooster. He loved urban exploration and knew every abandoned mental asylum, haunted house and ghost town in a five-hundred mile radius. But that wasn’t saying much, seeing as I lived in the middle of the desert out in the Western US. There were barely any towns nearby with more than five thousand people.

Rooster had eyes like a Siberian husky, a pale Russian complexion and far too many tattoos covering every exposed inch of his arms and legs. Many of them were mystical in nature, including paintings from Alex Grey, the OM symbol in a mandala pattern and a huge tattoo of a four-armed Shiva dancing the tandava on his right leg. I had known Rooster since I was a kid, when we went to the same school, and he was the one who had introduced me to psychedelic drugs, music festivals and eventually, my fiancee Katherine herself. I owed him a great deal.

As he got in the backseat behind Katherine on the passenger side, I looked back and saw a huge, shit-eating grin on his face, his pupils looking dilated, a thin sheen of sweat covering his face.

“Dude, are you fucking tripping right now?” I asked, slightly shocked. He nodded slowly.

“I just ate like three hits of *really good* Grateful Dead family blotter acid,” he said, laughing to himself. I shook my head and started the car back up, driving off down towards the highway and towards Saddle Ranch Springs.

“Now why would you eat acid when you knew we were going exploring in a ghost town?” I said, feeling peevish. Katherine looked over at me, smiling her slight Buddha smile. She had never even done psychedelics and refused to ever try them, but she always found Rooster hilarious when he had eaten mushrooms or acid. I was happy they got along quite well, because God forbid, if I had to choose between my lifelong best friend and the girl I loved, I’m not sure which I would have chosen.

“Because I want to *see,* man,” he said, laughing again. “Open up my third eye and all that, just like Bill Hicks said. ‘Today young men on acid realized we are all one consciousness experiencing itself subjectively…’” He trailed off, rambling for a few more moments before going quiet.

“Huh, OK, makes sense,” I said quietly, feeling the absurd urge to start laughing too. Then I remembered the phone call. “Hey Rooster, did you prank call me this morning?” I looked into the rearview mirror, seeing his huge smile and sparkling eyes.

“I have no idea what you’re talking about, man,” he said, his smile never faltering. I took that as a yes. In hindsight, I should have questioned him more. I should have realized he was just smiling because of the drugs, not because it had anything to do with my question. I should have done a lot of things differently, I guess. They might both still be alive if I had.

I turned up the radio and we didn’t talk the rest of the journey.

\*\*\*

“Oh my God, look at how *cool* this is,” Katherine said, pointing to the abandoned saloon a few feet in front of us with its massive batwing doors. The entire downtown area of Saddle Ranch Springs looked like the set for some old Western movie. It had only one real street, with all of ten dilapidated buildings on it, including an ancient police station and jail, a town hall, the saloon and a few houses. We walked up and down, exploring. When we got to the jail, that was when things started to go wrong.

Rooster walked ahead of me, still smiling and laughing far too much for the circumstances. I could tell he was really tripping hard. He could barely follow the conversations Katherine and I had, and kept getting distracted by the smallest of things, such as a tiny snake that slithered across the dirt road. He chased it excitedly, looking like a little kid. The snake ended up being far faster and smarter than him, though, and the look of total childish disappointment on his face was so exaggerated that both Katherine and I started giggling in unison.

Katherine ended up being the first one into the old cell, the jail door standing wide open. Rust covered every square inch of the metal, and the jail smelled dusty and old, almost like the smell of an antique shop.

We looked at the metal bench where the prisoners used to sleep, and Rooster got down on his knees, peering underneath it.

“What are you doing, bro?” I asked, kneeling down to get a closer look. Rooster looked up at me suddenly, the smile gone from his face.

“There’s some random ass trap door down here hidden beneath the bench,” he said, pointing to the extremely faint outline of a square covered in dust. Using his hands, he wiped the sand and dust off of it. I would never have seen it on my own, it was so well-camouflaged. The only reason Rooster had been able to see it, I assumed, was that the LSD was giving his senses an extra kick that allowed him to pick up subtle, tiny cues that everyone else would instantly miss. Feeling around at the corners, Rooster began to pull with the tips of his fingers and eventually found a way to open it.

We heard screaming and shrieking as soon as we opened the hatchway, and then the desert outside started to explode with noise and movement. A much larger hidden square rose up out behind the jail, a metal door with sand glued to the top of it swinging open, and we saw men and women in lab coats begin to run out, scattering like cockroaches in every direction. In the hatchway beneath the bench in the jail, a woman frantically appeared, wearing a lab coat and an ID badge that read “Dr. Kay”. She climbed up a ladder from the dark shadows beneath, heaving herself out with mortal terror and panic evident on her face.

“They’re getting out!” she yelled at us, not even appearing to realize that we weren’t wearing lab coats, black suits or biohazard uniforms, unlike all the other people who were now spilling out of the much larger hatchway by the dozens. “Get the hell out of here!” Just then, a deafening alarm began to sound from underneath us.

“What in the hell is going on?” Rooster whispered to me. Katherine just stared around, her green eyes wide and shocked.

“Project Eldritch has had a containment breach,” an amplified, calm female voice said, sounding like it came from thousands of speakers beneath our feet. The worn planks of the abandoned building shook as it spoke, dust falling from the ceiling as spiders and insects in the corners of the room were knocked to the ground. “I repeat, Project Eldritch has had a containment breach. This is a level 5 breach. All personnel must evacuate the premises at once. I repeat, evacuate the premises at once. Do not return until authorized. Project Eldritch has had a containment breach…” The voice started to repeat itself, sounding the same warning over and over again as what sounded like a tornado siren blared from hidden speakers all over the ghost town.. I couldn’t tell whether it was a robot or a person speaking the warning into the PA system. The cadence and inflections were all totally flat and emotionless, almost sounding like a text-to-speech software app.

“Oh God, it’s too late!” the woman in front of us in the lab coat said, crying and putting her face into her hands. 

“Ma’am,” I said, calmly walking up to her and putting a hand on her shoulder, “just what is going on? Where are all these people coming from? Is there some sort of secret laboratory underneath Saddle Ranch Springs or something?” Katherine was standing to my left now, taking my hand into hers. I felt her fingers trembling, her heart beating so fast I could feel the pulse through her skin.

“We need to get out of here!” she said. “Follow me, if you want to live. It’s your only chance. There’s a safe room not too far from here, a hidden hatchway door leading down in case of a containment breach. I’ll tell you everything there, *if* we live that long.”

We sprinted out of the jail, Dr. Kay leading the way. I heard engines revving as a few Hummers pulled up, and the doctors and scientists in the lead got in, being whisked away down the dirt road by their security details. The cars left a cloud of dust in their wake that blotted out the sky, covering the ghost town in a dim light. We ran past the jail, past the town hall and behind the saloon, where Dr. Kay got on her knees and began feeling around in the dirt. Within seconds, she had found a handle, pulling up a door so cleverly disguised that I would have never seen it in a million years if I had not been with her.

She jumped down, falling into the blackness. I peered down and saw her standing about five feet below us. Without being prompted, I jumped down, Katherine landing behind me a couple seconds later, then Rooster last of all. Red emergency lights flashed, the bulbs within the large round casings moving in slow, lazy circles. It gave a bloody glow to the entire tunnel.

We followed Dr. Kay ahead, where a massive steel door eight feet tall and five feet wide blocked out the entire tunnel. A black pad stood on the wall to its right. Dr. Kay put her eye up to it, as apparently it had a small camera with an optical scanner, and a buzzer went off in the hallway, sending the door flying open and making my ears ring from its sheer volume. The door dilated like a pupil, the metal expanding in a circle as it disappeared into the wall.

Behind it, a room lit by too many bright, fluorescent lights appeared. I instinctively put my hand in front of my eyes to shield them. On the edge of the room, I saw countless video monitors with live cameras covering every inch of the ghost town, as well as many shots of laboratories and scientific installations I had never seen before.

“What *is* this place?” Katherine asked behind me. Dr. Kay turned.

“Well, this is just a bunker, a safe room with back-up video feeds,” she said. “But if you mean the entire scientific complex itself, it’s where the US government does secret research into alternate dimensions, parallel worlds and doorways between different parts of the multiverse.” Her eyes flicked to the monitors, where people were still running and screaming, trying to escape from some unseen horror. “We’re funded by an agency unknown to the general public, the Department for Paranormal Research. Billions of dollars of black-ops taxpayer dollars are funneled through the CIA and military to the DPR, and some of it goes to experiments like ours here.”

“OK, so what kind of *experiments* are we talking about?” I asked, feeling unsure. My hairs stood on end, and the air had an electric feeling to it, as if something big was about to happen. I thought I knew what the Japanese citizens of Hiroshima and Nagasaki must have felt when they first felt the quaking of the ground and the flash of white light from the center of their cities.

“Here, we only do experiments trying to provide doorways to other worlds,” she said, pointing to her name badge. “I myself have a PhD in quantum physics, and we used all the knowledge gathered by physicists to open a quantum doorway earlier today. But something came through it just now, and it is creating havoc and death throughout the labs. I saw a few other scientists ripped apart by something that looked like demons straight from Hell. They stood about the height of a tall man, but their eyes were pure black and their skin bright red, their fingernails and toenails were just long black talons, and they spoke in some gurgling language I’ve never heard before. I don’t think anyone on this planet has seen them before, at least not in a very long time…” Her eyes became distant, as if she were deep in thought. And as she stopped talking, the earth began to shake violently.

It started as a small tremor, then rapidly built up into a high-intensity earthquake. Looking on the video feeds, I saw some of them cameras go black, but others outside in the abandoned town showed the ground begin to split open, flames and smoke shooting out as a massive demon rode out on a chariot, led by seven white horses. Looking closer, I realized the horses had exposed bone with pieces of rotting skin and fur still clinging to their corpses. Yet they ran at a furious pace, their tendons and muscles flexing under the high-quality resolution of the video feed. I saw the escaping Hummers filled with doctors and government agents in far-off shots of the video feed drive directly into a massive crack in the earth. No one came up from the smoking cracks that now appeared all around us.

Chairs in the room fell over and tables cracked and splintered as the earthquake’s tremors reached a crescendo, but they didn’t begin to recede. I saw Katherine, Rooster and Dr. Kay all holding onto whatever stable surface they could grab nearby. Katherine and Rooster were holding hands. My heart began to race in my chest, old suspicions rising to the surface as I forgot our mortal peril for a moment.

“They’re here,” Dr. Kay said, a look of total terror marring her tear-covered eyes. The floor of the room began to crack down the middle. “Get out of here!” she began to scream. None of us needed to be told twice. We ran through the still-open door and back into the world above.

As we came out into the blinding sunlight, I looked up at the small hill of the desert behind the town, and saw horrors from another world rushing towards us. The chariot flew down the hill, a wall of billowing flame and smoke rising thousands of feet into the air behind it…

\*\*\*

As I came out from the dry riverbed I had taken refuge in, I realized no one was moving around me. I saw the burnt bodies of Katherine, Rooster and Dr. Kay, laying on the ground ten feet in front of me, blackened and still smoking, their melted clothes attached to their flesh now from the intense heat they had been exposed to. The demon in the chariot rushed towards me, the hooves of the seven horses creating a loud “clap-clap” noise as they drew closer, and I thought he would run me down. But with a cry, he stopped the horses only a few feet in front of me. The demons behind him regarded me with interest and suspicion. The huge one stepped down in front of me.

“Mark,” he said to me, smiling from ear to ear. Small billows of smoke escaped from his mouth as he spoke. “I am *so happy* to finally meet you. My name is Lucifer, or Satan, if you prefer. I have many other names, as I’m sure you know.” He laughed at this. My heart beat hard in my chest as I realized I was the only one I could see still left alive.

“What do you want with me?” I asked, trying not to make eye contact. “Please, I don’t want to die.”

“Oh, neither do I want you to die!” Satan said loudly. “If I wanted you dead, you would be dead already.” He leaned close to me, lowering his voice. “And by the way, you were right about Rooster and your girlfriend there. They were in love, cheating on you, betraying you every chance they got.

“Your suspicions have been correct for a long time,” Satan said, his face totally expressionless. “Your girlfriend has been having sex with your best friend nearly every day for the past year. When you were working to support her, she was betraying you over and over. They are traitors to you, totally unworthy of your attention. Ants in the afterbirth have more meaning than their lives did. And I did you a favor by killing them. 

“They were worthless sheep, and the world is full of worthless sheep. They are more sheep for the Sheep God. But you, my friend, are different. Will you follow me?” I thought for only a moment and nodded. I had a feeling if I said no, I would die a horrible death on the spot.

“Every President and world leader in the past two centuries has given me his allegiance,” Satan said to me, showing me his perfectly white, sharpened teeth in a grisly smile. “Everyone from Hitler to JFK to Stalin to Obama has pledged his soul to me, and in exchange, I gave them the power they desired. And now I ask you, do you also wish for power, for money, followers, or anything else your heart desires?” I barely had to think about it.

“Of course I do,” I said quickly. With a puff of smoke, an old-looking, rolled-up parchment appeared in Satan’s left hand. He unrolled it, handing me an ancient quill pen and pointing to the bottom line. I didn’t even read the contract, nor could I if I wanted to. It was written in some language I had never seen before, almost reminding me of an ancient Tibetan script I had seen in history books.

“What is this?” I asked. He shrugged.

“It is just a contract between us, written in Enochian, the language of the angels,” he said simply, his black eyes shimmering with an inner light.

“Just sign here,” he said, pointing to a thick line on the bottom. I took the quill pen and began to move it towards the line, but he laughed.

“Not like that!” he said, motioning to a demon behind him, who came up to me and handed me a dagger. “Cut your hand and sign it in your blood.” I put the knife over my left palm, hesitating for a moment, before taking a deep breath and slashing it into the skin. A burning pain shot through my hand. I dipped the tip of the quill in the drops of blood pooling in my palm, signing my name in cursive on the parchment. When I had finished, the paper disappeared back into a puff of smoke. As soon as it did, my hand re-knitted itself, healing within seconds, and I began to feel a rush of euphoria and light enter my body.

It felt as if someone reached into my heart with invisible hands made of light and pulled out all the stress, all the anxieties and insecurities built up there. All my depression and sickness at finding out my girlfriend had been cheating on me with my best friend evaporated in an instant, and I felt pure bliss, thinking of their burnt bodies in the dirt of the destroyed ghost town. 

My hearing suddenly became far more acute- I could literally hear mice and voles crawling in the dirt beneath the ground. I could hear people screaming in Hell and angels singing in Heaven. It was as if I had been given a small taste of omniscience, and I enjoyed every second of it.

“What’s… what’s happening to me?” I asked, feeling shocked.

“You are gaining the divine wisdom that I offer all my followers,” Satan said, smiling, showing his sharp, bleached-white teeth. “They don’t call me Lucifer for nothing. I bring light to those who wish it, and I bring wisdom and peace to those who are forgotten by God.

“Within twenty years, I will make you President of the United States, as long as you do as I wish. We can start your political career small, as a state representative perhaps, but it won’t last long. It never does.” Satan grinned at me, extending a huge red hand, and I shook it. A fiery heat emanated from within his smooth flesh.

“I can’t wait,” I said, excited about my future for the first time in years.
