It's been ten days. 

1.4 weeks

240 hours.

14400 minutes.

864000 seconds.

And still ten days.

Ten terrible days in the shed. 

I have spent my time writing this, hopefully someone will see it. I don't know if it will ever post. But maybe madness has already eaten away at me. 

If I leave it will surely kill me— if it ever does leave. My many days trapped within this place have brought me an unforeseen madness. Once, as a child, I was told that being alone drove you crazy. At the time I had scoffed at such an idea. Only the sane can laugh at the deranged, but it’s once it consumes you laugh no more. In this shed it eats away at me, a fungus that takes my soul. Perhaps I will never leave, I will stay within this shed until I am an empty husk. Nothing but a body. Maggots eating away at my stomach. Wiggling and crawling. Lips cold with the touch of death and eyes emptied and grey. The idea of my own death has consumed me for many long hours in this trap. Its ghost haunts my waking hours and even in sleep I dream of its face. 



When I put my ear to the ground I can hear it outside, it's always just waiting there, circling the shed as if it's a planet in orbit. The bushes beside the shed tremble every time it passes, swishing with its body and the wind. It sounds like some sort of large wolf, tramping and thumping. The door rattles sometimes, but always playful, so playful like it knows the game isn’t going to last much longer. The teasing knock of death on a door that rots. Sand falling in an hourglass. I can sense its rotting teeth peeling into a grin. Its macabre face smiling at my ticking clock of time as it slowly runs out. “You don’t have much longer!” It seems to say. But when it does speak it is much worse than that. 



On the wretched fifth day it called out for me, in a voice that was covered in mildew and rot. Begging and pleading, sobs, and gasps, things so human, yet so fake. A masked wolf imitating the sheep. The babbling of a baby that crawled from the depths. I couldn’t sleep on that fifth night. I could see its shadow from under the metal door, a waiting doorman. It reminded me of the story of Sisyphus. Did he feel this way when death arrived at his door? Was this the despair that filled him, knowing he was going to be taken into the biting embrace? An urge to open the door slithered through my veins, yet I steeled myself. I will not give into it. Not when it sat outside and begged me to let it in. It pleaded and scratched at the door, lightly. I could almost hear the giggle beneath its words. It will not be better to leave. It will not be better to stay.



There are no windows in the shed. Some days I am glad for the lack of windows, days when it slams itself against the shed and lets out screams of frustration. I wonder sometimes if it must be as hungry as I am. Thirst consumes me, and I lick the morning dew off the wooden wall in hopes to satisfy its craving. The hunger and thirst drive me to only one notion. Curiosity. When the silence becomes a puddle that drowns me beneath it I wish for just a look, a glimpse of what is outside my tiny world. Is there truly a creature out there? What if there is simply nothing left? Everyone in the whole world could be dead, and I—somehow, am the only one left alive. A single marauder waiting on the dunes of a lonesome desert, rescue who will never come. My spaceship in tatter and ruin, a one way trip. What if all of it, the creature, the shed, the silence, isn’t real? It could be a dream? Maybe, the voice outside is simply another person. They must be awfully angry with me, this strange crazy person who refuses to come out of a shed. When they break down the door maybe they will find me, take me to a hospital, it's not real. My mother will scold me and then cradle me in her arms. They will comment on how mad I am. 



All of those thoughts consumed me in the early days before. When my hope was still a swooning ocean, ups and downs. Highs and lows. 

But there are no more highs as it speaks more and more. I cannot deny its existence any longer. I can almost feel the sounds reverberating off the walls of the shed. The pressing weight of truth and reality eroding away at my conscience. 

As it begs again to be let inside, I know for sure. There is no person calling me, waiting for me to come out so they can help me wretched state. 

The thing out there is no human. No man or woman, it is an amalgamation of another evil, not yet seen by me. A mystery that can contend with only the unknown of death. 



On the first day I heard screams. It had become sticky and hot in the midday sun, then by night a chill wriggled through the panels of the shed like a mouse. Even with my hands pressed against my head, curled into the corner of the shed like a cat I could still hear them. All through that terrible first night, like a cacophony of exotic birds, howls, and bellows, and shrieks. It had never occurred to me that someone might have a different scream as another. It never occurred to me that maybe people should keep lots of food in their shed, or that they should run faster, or work harder, or barricade their house. A lot of things never occurred to me before. Every night it lets out those low hoots, like an owl with a rat stuck in its throat. In the distance, I can hear other hoots. There are more of them. Maybe there are a million. There could be trillions, crawling about the world like wretched parasitic bugs. But, there is only one of me, alone in the shed. I have nothing, nowhere to go. Stuck, lost in a galaxy no one will ever reach.



All that's left is the shed. The creature has made me become this, a scared animal trapped and bargaining with no one, nothing but dirt and floor, for a redo of a life I can never reverse. If I could just change this— maybe if I did something different. No, things would still be the same. Somehow, I just know it. 

I used to wonder how the world would end when I watched scary movies, and read books. Climate change, missiles, nukes, poison gas, robots, zombies. I feel stupid now, like a little kid.

*Mommy? How will the world end?* 

But then again, it won't, right? It only ends for us. For me. The creatures take the world from man, just as man took the world from animals. As animals took it from others. 

 

The screams were gone by the middle of that horrid second day. By the second night, everything was so silent you could hear your own heartbeat bouncing out of your chest like a child on a pogo stick. But sometimes, when the wind was just right I would get wafts of a terrible smell. A sickening sweet stench that attacked my nostrils with its truth. The scent of death. 

 Every few hours those haunting hoots and wails from the creatures. Then, silence would fall again, its blanket hiding the exposed nature of the outdoors to my prying ears. All noise gone, except of course, that wicked creature with its soft thudding footsteps and its tune of death. Stalking around with the grace of an acrobat on a swing. When I finally fall asleep I imagine it, a shadowy figure swinging from a circus trapeze, the audience howling like wolves up at the sky. And I am in the middle, trapped in the sandy ring. I turn and struggle but am unable to leave from the spot where my feet are rooted. As if I had grown in the ground for millennia.



From the loudspeakers, a child screams and laughs. *Mommy, tell me now! How will the world end?*

The infernal dream never ceases to leave me in my hours of sleep. A cruel sandman playing his game with me. Perhaps at the end my brain will be nothing but a puddle.



I bet I could make it. To the house, up the stairs, shut the door, down the hall, to my bedroom. I can practically feel the cool silver doorknob in my hands, Turning to expose a way out of this nightmare. Perhaps I could do it if I really, really tried. Is there another choice for me? If I stay inside the safety of the shed I will starve. That is for certain. But if I simply try it, the idea of success is so tantalizing. I just know I could do it, I would run down that hallway with its family pictures of smiling faces. I would fling open my bedroom door and hide under my covers. I would be surrounded with the smell of detergent, soft pillows and stuffed animals. No monsters can reach you under the blankets. My ceiling fan would slowly squeak and rattle as it spins, a mechanical ballerina, her cogs turning above my head. I would be safe and soft and warm. Then of course it wouldn’t be able to find me there. The creature would just stalk away and never come back. That wretched thing would finally go away. 

It would go away. 



It's been 4 hours since I last heard it. Nothing now, not a stomp, or a grunt, or a whisper in the bushes. A rare occasion, not something that has happened since the third day. Maybe it finally moved on, found someone else to scare and prey upon. Perhaps another shed, another crazy person, another thing to torment. In another life that would’ve made me guilty, wishing this problem on some other soul. Now though, ten days ago was a billion days and I am in another hemisphere completely. I was once Jekyll but now I can feel only Hyde. I haven’t room for anyone else.



But should I even risk this? Is it worth it, what will I even do once inside? Can the creature learn to open doors and windows? Do I call for help? No, I have to stick to my plan. House, stairs, door, hall, bedroom. I can do it. It's gone, I am here in this shed and alone. Finally, this is my chance, my one shot. As if I am some sort of rabbit escaping the fox that prowls in the underbrush, muzzle dripping with blood. 

I open the door, just the smallest bit. Creaking of metal hinges makes me wince, and I peer out from behind my shed, my world. 



The fresh air fills my lungs and it is divine. The real outdoors looks as if it's always been, only stark and quiet, a picture out of a magazine for gardening. Empty lawns, empty cars, empty houses, dark lights and dark windows. An eerie ghost town of a home I once knew. 

Is the entire world gone but me? 



Just the creature and I alone on the open range? 

I cannot think about that right now, not when I am so close to my escape. My lungs inflate as I gulp in air in preparation for the run. My body races and jitters, my heart a drum beating with a song of fear and unknowing. Before I know it I am running, my legs pumping with the adrenaline shooting through every vein, blood racing and pounding in my ears. I’m so close, my sneakers are on the stairs, I can hear them creak under my weight. And for just a second I am alive, not in the shed, not trapped, but alive. Just for that small bubble of time, I will make it, I will be free and safe and go home and to school and to everything. But I know, I have known, the outcome to my predicament from the first time the shed door banged closed behind me on day one. I know the end of the story. 



A kid on my bus used to tell me about a family who was trapped on an island, and they lived there. A tiger also lived on the island, eating each of the family one by one. Until there was only one left. I remember sitting on that sticky bus seat, its cheap plastic cushioning hot from spring. I was teetered on the edge, excitement coursing through my veins. How I wondered what the ending to the story would be. 

“So what happens to the last person?”



Then the boy will look at me and he will open his mouth, filled with scraggly baby teeth, and say— 

“Well, they all die in the end. That’s just how it goes.”

I hadn’t believed him at the time, as all children don’t. Death isn’t real to children, they are pure. Unable to comprehend the depravity of life and death. Its always sunny on that bus. 

But the sun has gone down. 

*That’s just how it goes.*



I can see that boy on the bus as the creature snags my t-shirt in its jaws, before I stumble, and its teeth sink into my shoulder. The smell of rotting fish fills my nose as its jaws release my shoulder. The stench sickens me to no avail, I feel bile rise in my throat. Somebody is screaming nearby. But I know better, nobody has been around, it's me who is screaming. I suppose it's my turn now. My turn to add to the cacophony. The rattling screams of the world. I’m the one who howls as it throws me onto the lawn. I wonder if somewhere, in another shed, near another creature, there is someone who hears me and thinks about what I sound like. They are waiting for their escape. Maybe I am just another bird call, a song that nobody knows or understands. And now the cat has caught me in its wicked claws. 



It flips me over onto my back and for the first time I get a good look at it. Through my tearstained eyes it looks like a hairless wolf. Its patchy gray skin is a petri dish of moldy coloring. Beneath its translucent skin I can see bones and blood and tissue. Moving in an almost human way, yet so inhuman that it disgust me to the highest degree. A violent mimicry. 

A monster made of putrid skin, boney and predatory. A horrible chattering noise falls from its throat as the creature slinks toward me. Together it sounds almost like a person talking. 

It slips out of my sight, and all I can see is the blue sky. Wisps of clouds like icing on a cake float around my vision. 

It's a lovely day.  

Somewhere, off in a distant land outside this body of mine, I can feel it chewing on my leg. That's alright, I don’t even need it now right? That ringing in my ear has only gotten louder. When I close my eyes I can see a young boy balancing on a wooden beam. He is smiling and telling me a story about some island. *That's just how it goes.* My head hurts. But all of those things are so fuzzy. The world is so fuzzy now. Who was that boy again?

The creature is looking at me now, its eyes are beady and searching. Its lips are curled with satisfaction and thrill. I look back up at it, I can feel my own face turning into a lazed grin. The creature is so grotesque to me, it's almost comical, all that hiding for this?

It’s falling back— No, I am falling back now.

I can’t feel my head hit the ground, but I hear it. *Thud.*

I am floating, it's not so bad. The foaming spit in the monster's mouth must have something in it. I giggle to myself, because the whole damn world must have something in it. Is this how Alice felt when she fell into Wonderland? I wonder where my rabbit is now, perhaps the creature ate him. My eyes have begun to close. I hope it's fast. I hope it's nice, I did pretty good to be honest with myself. I’m not in the shed anymore. I am finally free. I can see the sun. I can see the world. 

When I wake I see it happen. I don't know if I should leave the shed.
