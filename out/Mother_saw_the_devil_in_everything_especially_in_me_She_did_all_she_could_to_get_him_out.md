Mother saw the devil in everything, especially in me. She tried, with beatings, to drive him out. I would spend hours praying, kneeling in the backyard, my back lined with belt marks.

Father didn’t bother to contain her excesses. His life revolved around reading the newspaper, working, having dinner, and watching whatever game was on at night. He looked at us like animals, whose only master was mother.

As her only daughter, mother was particularly worse with me. “Every woman is an Eve in potential,” was her motto. There was always an apple to be eaten.

My only solace was at school, where, even though I had no friends, I had books. At the library, I read everything—from geography to science fiction. The printed words were my real home, not the cramped room I was forced to sleep in.

Sometimes, when I spent too much time there, I would run into a teacher who always stopped by to see me and recommend books. I called him Teacher L because I couldn’t pronounce his name. He told me he saw a great future in me.

As I grew into puberty, mother got worse. The moment she found me brushing my hair and lingering too long in front of the mirror, she enforced strict fasting and longer prayer routines, throwing out all my books except for the Holy Bible. I even overheard her talking to my father about taking me out of school.

Funny enough, that’s when I met Jake in biology. He sat next to me, often cracking stupid jokes just to make me laugh. Our relationship started innocently, but soon, we began spending more time together during lunch break. Jake also came from a difficult family, with alcoholic and absent parents, and we bonded a lot.

Since home wasn’t an easy place to be, I spent most of my time either with Jake or at the library. My interest in books slowly started shifting from science fiction to romance. And there he was, always, Teacher L, handing me many of those, that increasingly sparked my imagination. Somehow, it felt like every story brought Jake to mind.

He began walking with me almost the entire way home, and we would spend hours talking about the movies he had seen—ones I hadn’t, of course. Jake’s world, full of smartphones, apps, movies, and tv series, felt as foreign to me as my world of prayer and discipline did to him.

One afternoon, we walked to the point where we usually parted ways—to avoid the risk of my parents seeing us—and as we said goodbye, he kissed me. It was my first kiss, and the sensation was something I had never felt before or since. I was in love at last and I realized my books hadn’t been lying about how good it felt.

But a day that was meant to be my happiest quickly turned into a nightmare. My older brother had seen us while riding his bike nearby and rushed home to tell mother. When I got there, her eyes locked onto me with an indescribable mix of hatred and fear.

She grabbed me by the arm and dragged me into the basement. My brothers, smirking, helped her as she cut my hair with a scissor and locked me inside an improvised cage down there.

“My child, do not give the devil a foothold,” she said while walking up the basement stairs. "Or I’ll take it from you.” Then she shut the door, leaving me in complete darkness.

That night, I wept until I physically couldn’t cry anymore. The bitter cold and the sound of rats creeping around kept me up until late.

The next day, mother simply left me there as if I didn’t exist. No meals, no water, no attention. I was supposed to purify myself through fasting and self-reflection, to get rid of impure and evil thoughts. But it was on that day that impure and evil thoughts truly took root in my mind.

Hunger and cold kept me awake again until late, and when I finally dozed off, I was jolted awake by a long, thin hand. It was Teacher L, crouched down, motioning for me to get up and follow him. And I did, the door was somehow unlocked.

The rest of that night feels like a fever dream, or a hallucination. But I’ll recount it as I remember.

Teacher L and I took a half-filled gasoline can from the garage and topped it off using a hose to siphon fuel from father's truck.

We poured it inside and around the house, making sure to cover every viable exit.

I turned on the gas valve and walked outside, holding the lighter my father used for his stinky cigars.

One of my brothers must have heard something because I saw him opening the door to investigate the noise—though it was already too late.

A few seconds later, I flicked the lighter on with one hand, while holding the red right hand of Teacher L in the other. I had never realized it before, but his eyes were as dark as the night, and his delicate skin was the color of blood.

Sitting in the yard, I watched everything unfold inside the house. The discovery of the smoke, mother’s screams, father’s struggles, and their final realization that there was no escape. The entire place was engulfed in flames in less than fifteen minutes.

Slowly, the neighbors started noticing the event, and a commotion began in the street. I heard the sound of fire truck sirens emerging in the distance. As I turned to thank Teacher L, I found he was not there anymore.

It was just me.
