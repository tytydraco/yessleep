Retirement, the biggest scam there is. You work your whole life waiting to retire, like it's something to look forward to. Around a year ago I gave up being a detective so I could focus solely on what everyone does when they are middle aged and single. Drink and think about the past. The difference is, a certain group of federal agents is forcing me to think about what really happened, not the romanticized version in my head. 

 

There are a group of men in suits snooping around my old office as we speak, probably harassing my old secretary. Above them there is likely a whole team dedicated to the purpose of uncovering what I tried my darndest to bury. I can’t imagine why they are suddenly so interested, but whatever it is can’t be good. If they keep searching, eventually they will find what they are looking for.  

 

Something happened twenty years ago, something horrible. It changed my life forever. After all this time I haven't told a single person, more out of fear of being committed than anything else I suppose. This subreddit is a washed-up old man's last chance to arrange the bones in his closest into a fully-fledged skeleton. The last chance to understand what happened, before the government does.  

 

Before I begin, allow me to state a few things. All names and locations will be changed. This is the first time I’ve ever told this story, or even thought about these events sober. I may be fuzzy on some details. This is a long story, so I’ll be telling it in parts. And finally, please leave any ideas you may have about what the hell happened in the comments. I need all the help I can get. 

 

“Slow down” I said, taking care not to let any coffee seep over the edges of my mug as I returned it to my desk. “You realize that doesn’t make any sense.” I saw a look of annoyance in my secretary’s eyes, she sighed. “It’s almost like I told you that when I came in.” Susan said dropping a stack of papers in front of me. “Just tell me what we know, slowly.”  

 

“At approximately 2:00am last night, Perry Grove Police Department was flooded with noise complaints. All these complaints came from 2nd street, and they were all regarding the Pinehill office building. The street and the building were about the only things they had in common. The first caller was a harsh sounding woman who claimed to hear screaming coming from the office. She kept insisting over and over that an officer head to the building and ignored any requests for her personal information.” 

 

“A few minutes into the call, two more came in. One was a gentleman getting fed up with the loud music he insisted came from Pinehill, demanding an officer put a stop to it. The other call seemed to come from a child, who claimed to hear crying coming from the building. These callers also ignored any attempt to collect personal information. Shortly after these calls, four more came in, then 8. The small team of dispatchers quickly grew overwhelmed.” 

  
“At 2:17am, Deputy A. Smith arrived on scene. He noted the entire street was dead silent, expressing frustration over what he believed to be a series of prank calls. The next thing he noted was that the door was unlocked. Upon entering the building, Smith advised he could hear faint sobbing coming from an upper level. He requested an additional unit, before heading up the stairwell. At 2:20am, he reported the 2nd floor as clear. At 2:22am, he entered the 3rd floor office space. Immediately noting the carpet was soaking wet.” 

 

“At 2:25 he requested more backup, all units available; he was hysterical, refusing to say why.” Susan trailed off; her eyes trained on the floor. “And? What did they find?” A breath she had inadvertently trapped in her throat made its way out. “What he found doesn’t make any sense, I’ve never heard of anything like it.” 

 

“Let me guess, he was concerned about dry rot forming from the damp floor, that’s why he needed backup?” Susan’s face didn’t change. “He heard a voice coming from somewhere in the dark. He could just barely make it out, someone saying they were sorry. He scanned his flashlight around the room, that's when he saw them.” Susan’s mouth remained open slightly, but nothing made its way out. 

 

“Jesus Christ Susan, saw who?” I sat up now, paying more attention. “6 people, 4 men and 2 women, all identified as employees who worked in the 3rd floor office. They all sat perfectly still at their desks. Smith stumbled back, before demanding to know what they were doing there. Not one of them so much as blinked. He approached one of them, a young woman. He called to her again. When she didn’t respond, he checked her pulse, nothing. Smith frantically squished across the carpet, searching for a survivor among the bodies, none of them had a heartbeat.” 

 

I stared at Susan, unable to find any words for what I was hearing. “A mass murder in Pinehill?” “It seems that way.” Susan said matter-of-factly. “That isn’t even the worst part, Smith found something else, something unexplainable. The bodies were pale, cold against his fingers. His mind began to make an awful connection. He turned his flashlight to the ground, and watched as a dark crimson liquid stained his boots.” 

 

“Blood? That’s sickening and all but hardly unexplainable, blood and corpses go together like love and marriage.” I muttered while mulling over the ramifications of this vicious crime in my head. “Mhm, I’m not finished. Within 20 minutes officers and EMTS were swarming the building. It didn’t take either group long to figure out something was wrong. Out of the 7 people in the building, 6 of them were dead. Of these 6, not one of them had a single drop of blood in, or on their bodies. Nor did they any lacerations or bruises.” 

 

Susan paused for a moment to look at me, the expectation for me to say something was obvious. She was right, this didn’t make any sense. I needed to hear the rest. “Keep going, tell me about the 7th person.” “They found him, Edward Coleman crying in the fetal position under his desk, babbling incoherently. He is the only suspect as of now and is currently undergoing evaluation at a secure medical facility.” 

  
“I wish there was more to go off of, but until we can get ahold of the officer manager and get a search warrant for Mr. Coleman’s residence, this is all we really have.” Susan dropped a journal in front of me. “This was found on his desk, presumably it's his.” I let rubber gloves envelop my hands before picking it up. It was encased in thick, dark red leather. “Thank you, Susan.”  

 

Susan walked out of my office, leaving me alone with the journal. I ran my fingers over its coarse leather face, finding myself surprised by its weight. The book felt as though it was made of solid oak. I created a seam in the pages before letting one half of the book slam onto the table, startling poor Susan in the other room. She yelled out asking if everything was okay, I ignored her. Edward’s handwriting made it seem as though he had put the journal and a pen in his bag before going for a jog. I focused intensely, scanning the page.  

 

May 13th, 2005. Entry one, new adventures in a new town. With the unpacking of this small notebook, the physical transition to my new life is complete. Tomorow I will go out and let the denizens of this town bear witness to my presence. I hope they can contain their enthrallment. As much as I would love to go out today, I cannot. I am drained, and so is my beloved companion, soup. I am concerned for soup, he has not reacted well to his sudden displacement, and has instead taken to hiding in the laundry room. I did manage to snag something that will allow me to catch a glimpse of my surroundings from the security of my couch, today's paper. I found it lying completely unguarded in my neighbor's driveway 

. 

Entry two, a daring encounter. Today, my own bravery nearly cost me my freedom or worse, in a conflict between myself and a teenage grocery store clerk. Yesterday, I was able to collect two coupons from the paper I found. One of which was buy one, get one free on a half-gallon of whole milk purchased at ParFoods.  Armed with the contract, I courageously made my way into ParFoods and brought two half-gallons of whole milk to the checkout lane.  

 

As the clerk sloppily scanned my refreshments, my blood pressure began to rise, for I knew the time of action was near. I placed the coupon down in front of him. Rage filled his eyes. He must’ve realized I was going to be paying less than standard market value for my milk, this deduction would no doubt be coming out of his already meager wage. “That will be 2.49” He spoke with a manufactured smile. I handed him the money, playing dumb to his facade by saying “Have a great day!” I still haven't stopped trembling from the confrontation. 

 

I let out a deep yawn, wiping tears from my eyes. This guy was a freak, no doubt about that. I glanced over at the antique clock above my desk, it was already an hour past closing time. I knew Susan was ready to leave, and it would be dangerous for me to drive home after reading anymore of this pyscho’s mundane life. I decided to skim through the journal, looking for anything that stood out.



From entry one to fifty-five, there was nothing of interest in the passages. After feeling the remaining pages, I guessed there were less than 10 entries left. I had to be missing something, I would finish the last few and start over.  

 

No amount of training, consultation, or prayer could’ve prepared me for what events I was setting in motion by turning the page. This single action led me to where I am now. Entry fifty-six, I skimmed the words just as I had the others. This time however, I had no idea what I had just read. A memory of grad-school flooded back, when I would read from a textbook while my mind was somewhere else. 

  

I did a little mental exercise to clear my thoughts, one I had done many times and re-read the passage. Again, I didn’t understand it whatsoever. I tried two or three more times expecting something different to happen. Eventually I tried to just read a single word, then a single letter. They were so familiar to me; I knew I should be able to understand. I just couldn’t place them in my head.  

 

I focused harder and harder on the words; my skin began to stick to my clothes. I felt the tip of an axe drive into my skull.  I pulled two Ibuprofen eight hundreds out of my top drawer and popped them in my mouth. I placed the journal in the drawer and locked it shut. The migraines were bad, but they’d never made me unable to read. I made a mental note to tell my doctor, then instructed Susan to lock up. I knew once the headache really took hold, I wouldn’t be getting any work done. 

 

As I started the silent drive home, a million things were on my mind. The details of the case didn’t fit together, there were too many variables. The journal had given me nothing, but I needed to finish it. Slowly my mind began to focus on one single thing, keeping my eyes open. Five minutes ago I was wide awake, now my eyelids felt like cinder blocks.  

 

I shook my head, then started talking to myself aloud about the case. I found I couldn’t even keep track of what I was saying, so I reached for the radio. Heavy rock music blared from the speakers, a pulsing behind my eyes thumped in rhythm with the drums. I shut the music off, wincing from the pain. After a few seconds later the throbbing stopped, leading me to briefly close my eyes in relief. I was jolted awake by protesting tires grinding across rumble strips. 

 

The shock had woken me up temporarily, I needed to get off the road as soon as possible. I knew there was a gas station coming up, but the sight of the neon green $1.17 per gallon unleaded sign still felt like seeing an angel. I pulled off, deciding to rest for a few minutes as my eyes closed again. 

 

When I opened them, my world had changed. The axe in my skull was gone, my eyelids felt weightless. In fact, I had a hard time thinking of pain or weariness at all. My view was fixed forward, into a dark blue abyss. I struggled to look around, but I seemed to have no control over my body. 

  
It was as if I were seeing from the eyes of something else. After I made this connection, my point of view began to shift. The abyss from earlier was the sky, and I was now looking past dark clouds to the ground. I felt a strange sensation, a taste of fear. The feeling only lasted for a fraction of a second before it was gone completely. I’ve never been comfortable with heights, but in that moment, it felt natural. 

 

My vision began to shift sporadically and jerk around. I remember worrying about motion sickness, but it never came. Over the next few minutes, I began to hear talking. I heard a woman complaining about her husband on the phone, and a man telling his boss he couldn’t work his shift. 

 

More voices joined the cacophony, dozens, then hundreds of conversations happening all at once. Somehow, I could still hear everyone individually. This put a massive strain on my mind. As more and more voices filled my head, I realized it wasn’t just conversations anymore. I could hear people's thoughts. I heard a man order two triple cheeseburgers at a drive through, before his internal monologue scolded him for breaking his diet. I heard the drive through attendant mutter “looks about right.” to himself after seeing the man go past. 

 

Just as I thought I had reached my limit, the voices stopped. There was a moment of serenity before my view began plummeting to the ground. There was no fear during the descent, no exhilaration either. I did feel, something, a drive I can’t explain. Within seconds, I was close enough to the ground to make out what I was going towards. A man in a plaid suit.  

 

The man’s clothes hung loosely from his body; the features of his face were sharp. I wanted to warn him, to tell him to get out of the way, but I couldn’t speak. A second later I was right on top of him, his expression remained unchanged.  

 

I shot up, my skin peeling off soaked sheets. My eyes darted across the room; I was in bed. I stared at the keys on the nightstand, trying to remember driving home. I couldn’t remember anything past pulling into the gas station. Momentary relief washed over me as I felt the Motorola phone still in my pocket. When the device powered on, I noticed two things. I had twelve missed calls from Susan, and it was eleven o clock. I was three hours late for work.  

 

I practically jumped out of bed and into my clothes, anxiety fueling my movements. A soft buzzing interrupted my frantic actions. Susan was calling again. I declined the call, then sent an apology over text and let her know I was on my way. She replied almost instantly, “David, you have three interviews today, all with people who were with our victims before they went to Pinehill. The first will be here in 30 minutes. Hurry up.” 

 

I stumbled out of the bathroom, breath now minty fresh. I started to head for the door, when I noticed something that paralyzed me in place. In the corner of the room lay an open book, one with thick leather casing. 

  
My stomach tied itself into a knot as I tried to process what I was seeing. This was not possible. The air was eerily silent, the stagnation only broken by the sound of my thumping heart. I noticed a faint, sulfur-like smell as I approached the book. It was open on the page I had stopped reading, only now I could make it out. Entry 56, apparitions.
