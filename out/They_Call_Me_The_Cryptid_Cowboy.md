Hello, my name is Colt Mcgraw and I am what the fine folks of the west call " The Cryptid Cowboy ". I will start from the beginning. I was born in the small town of Creede, Colorado. There were three of us living in a small one-story ranch on a few acres of land in the foothills outside of town. While I was a young child I was always interested in the theatrics of the local cowboys and the fantastic animals that they rode upon. I recall going to the rodeo one dusty spring and having one of the best days that any young child could imagine! I sat in wonder of the cattle rustlers and their unflinching skill to fight those cows from atop the giant horses they rode. As I watched one of the most respected wranglers flip and wrap a calf, I knew that was what destiny had planned for me. 

Now, there were numerous ranchers that were featuring in the show that day, yet this one was unlike any other.  I was in complete bliss sitting with my parents in the stands enjoying the day, when suddenly a woman in the grandstands started to scream a blood curdling scream. The crowd grew wild with alarm. My parents began to pull me in the direction of the exit with the flow of the crowd. I could hear the sorrow in the woman's voice as her screams were stifled by whatever had been causing her immense pain. Out of pure horror I began too vigorously scan the crowd for the source. 

  
That is when I experienced the worst fear and overwhelming wash of sheer helplessness. I locked eyes with something that at the time I could only describe as a monster. I now know that what I was seeing that dusty spring day was a Luferlang which is essentially a pissed off rage monster in a horse's body. Now still to this day I along with my cohorts are completely baffled at the proposition of that animal (an avid herbivore might I add) choosing to brutally dismember and consume that woman, and in the broad daylight at that. But you see Cryptids are the farthest thing from dependably consistent when it comes to habits and behavior. 

  
The events that transpired that day quelled my desire to be a cowboy and fueled my desire to see too it that terrible vicious things such as the Luferlang were held at bay. allowed to exist only in the minds farthest reach. I along with a few dusty plains drifters who fell into this life were all that held the scary monsters that go bump in the dark from infesting and decimating the small towns and even big cities that were spattered across the great western frontier. And I am known amongst them as " The Cryptid Cowboy ". 

You see, we were all known by some silly moniker formulated by one another due to the wide array of backstories that lead us into the life of cryptid hunting. For example, there is a broad-shouldered man known only as Tex. Now I know that nickname does not leave much of an opening for one to imagine a backstory, but things are not always filled to the brim with sparkles and glitter. In fact, if this line of work has taught me anything at all it is that most things in life that are covered with glitter tend to be traps. Traps set to ensnare either your mind or attention for darker things to occur right behind your back.... damn... here I go rambling already. I'll get back to the good stuff

Me and the other hunters typically work alone. sometimes crossing paths in dusty old diner booths or across the bar in some run-down hole in the wall in a ghost town. Sometimes we would work alongside each other fighting the worst creations that any ill minded soul could drum up. Today however was not a day in which I had the accompaniment of one of my band of cohorts. 

I was lost deep in thought on highway 89 headed south towards Glacier national park. I was headed back south after a three-day excursion in Alberta helping an old friend Red fight off a pack of Waheela that had been tormenting the local populous of sheep and cattle. When my cellphone started blaring out that old George Strait song about Amarillo. I peered at the screen as the song echoed through the cab of my old chevy pickup. The name on the screen was one that I had not seen in a far too long time, the name on my screen was that of my former partner Rusty. I answered the phone with haste wondering what it was that the old retiree could possibly be up to now. 

" Russ talk to me brother! What the hell can I do for you? " I asked expecting to hear the gruff response of my old crusty friend. 

" Colt this is Maggie " Said Rusty's aging wife 

" Maggie? What what's going on? Is everything alright? Where's Russ " I said in a slightly worrisome tone. 

" Oh Colt Its bad! Its so so Bad! " I could hear the absolute pit of despair that poor woman had found herself in ringing through in her horrified words.

" Mags just calm down please and tell me what the hell is going on? " I said, while attempting to stifle the sense of dread that was pooling at the pit of my stomach 

" They found Rusty this morning " The words hit me like a ton of bricks having been heaved off the top of a building. 

" They found.... What....What do you mean "Found" mags?" I asked in an even more worried tone than before.

" YES, they found Rusty out in the pasture behind the calf barn this morning" 

The dread that had once pooled in the pit of my stomach now punched at the bottom of my throat from my insides, attempting to heave whatever bit of morning coffee and bagel that remained inside my stomach from the start of my voyage early this morning. 

" Oh mags.... I'm so goddamn sorry... " I exclaimed while scrambling to find the words needed to express my condolences and hold my innards from becoming outwards. My mind began to wander and wonder what it was that finally knocked that legend of a man, the same man that holds the Colorado record (amongst us hunters that is) for singlehandedly destroying and torching the most vampire nests in the state. Rusty was just four months from his 65th birthday and even I must admit that it is hard to keep up with a healthy schedule of " Good " food while chasing the deprived and demonic across the great western expanse. I quickly came to the assumption that it was in the end his own damn ticker that had taken the old man out. 

I began to say "Listen, I know that this must be the worst damn day of your life Mags, but that man lived one hell of a life protecting thousands of people and livestock from meeting devastating ends" 

" Russ was a HERO in every sense of the word, I know that 64 is far too young for your body to give out on you " 

" HE WAS TORN TO PIECES " Maggie screamed into the phone in a devastated manner cutting me off as I spoke. 

My heart Pounded in my chest and the blood rushed to my brain as I tried to decipher the horrifying words as they crawled their way through my ears. There's no man nor beast alive that was strong enough to take down the man that taught me and countless other hunters all that we knew of the cryptid world. THIS the same man that I myself, had watched topple even the most malevolent of cryptids. I fell into a small episode of emotion as I pulled over onto the shoulder of highway 89. 

" Maggie are you telling me that someone killed Russ? " I asked in vain seeking clarification on an already understood comment 

" YES COLT RUSTY WAS MURDERED!" Maggie shouted through the phone in mournful despair

" I'm on the way Mags, just tell them not to move him I need to see him " I said hanging up the phone and tossing it onto the bench seat next to the stack of cryptid research that lay haphazardly across the seat. 

The next two-hundred miles were a blur. Sonic booms of emotion shot through every single cell in my body as my brain scrambled to find the thoughts to think. Was this an accident somehow? Was Russ working with some kind of equipment and somehow lost his footing? Was he back to work? Rusty wouldn't have gone back to work and not mentioned something to me .... right? The thoughts raced and so did I down the long and winding highway on my way to a conscious nightmare.

As night began to fall, I was somewhere on interstate 90 close to the Yellowstone River when what looked to be a deer leapt from the edge of the road and into the front passenger side bumper and underneath my vehicle before I could even tap my brakes. " AHHH COME ON! NOW! OF ALL THE DAMN TIME IN THE WORLD IT HAS TO BE RIGHT NOW! I exclaimed loudly from inside my truck, pounding my fist into the steering wheel. I gritted my teeth as I pulled off onto the exit ramp that conveniently had been just about one-hundred yards from the collision.  As my truck came to a stop, I slid the shifter into neutral and set the emergency brake. 

I opened the door and was met with one of the most horrid stenches that even now I lack the words to describe. A stench that I had known all too well. This smell was undoubtably a Shunka or a Ringdocus. This was what is known in the hunting community as the Montana Hyena. Foul smelling wretched creatures that decimate entire herd of deer and domesticated animals in a flash. These horribly dangerous canines love to work alone but can be often found in packs hunting prey and rolling around bathing themselves in the piles of the strewn about innards of their prey. 

" Ah shit! " I mumbled under my breath as I noticed the hanging headlight and twisted bumper on the passenger side of my beloved pickup. Though ugly, the damage seemed to be light and not seriously detrimental to the functionality of the vehicle. "Thank God" I uttered as I knelt to further examine the undercarriage of the truck. As I let my hands slap the cool pavement of the highway and peered under the truck, I could see what appeared to be a shiny piece of bone. "Just Perfect" I complained as I reached under to grab whatever kind of tangled mess lay in the bottom of my engine bay. 

Feeling with my mind as I slid my hand past the warm underneath of the motor, I grasped what certainly had felt like bone. Pulling the mysterious item out into the light I could make out that I was holding the twisted remains of a Jackalope. " I hope you enjoyed your last meal you son of a bitch " I said bitterly whilst staring in the direction of the spattered remains of the Shunka. 

Tossing the remains of the Jackalope to the side of the road and wiring the headlight back into place with some cable ties I returned to the cab of my Chevy. The sounds of Craig morgan " I was almost home " enveloped my ears as I slid the shifter back into gear and fired the ole girl back to life. Backing off the exit and back onto interstate 90 I rolled down my window and spat at the horribly rancid smelling baby killer that lay sprawled on the side of the interstate. One less pain in the ass for me to deal with someday I thought as I punched the accelerator and sped back into the lane of the highway.
