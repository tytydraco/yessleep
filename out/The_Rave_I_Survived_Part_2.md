When they dropped my arm, the pain remained, renewing with each heartbeat. My eyes watered as I slowly moved my arm into my good hand. I hoped holding it steady would ease the pain -it didn't. I was doubled over, reminding myself to breathe anytime I caught my lungs starting to burn. My inhales were shaky and shallow, an attempt to avoid aggravating the angry wound of swollen, taut white skin that I could already feel filling with serum.

"The third time," I started with a voice gravely and feint. "Was on purpose in my apartment. I was losing a battle with depression." My breathing quickened in natural panic as I looked at Tower, who had their head cocked to the side. I hastily added, "At least that's what I usually blame. I wasn't just sad; I was so tired of feeling so intensely so often."

I almost cried when I saw Tower nod. The tall masked man then waved a hand through the air as he began to walk away. The other masks followed around like a swarm of excited bees.

It wasn't till the sound of their feet and rustling clothes was gone that Rabbit stood up. "Come on, we should get running water over these." Rabbit extended their good hand. I awkwardly took it in my own good hand and let them lead.

"Were they invited?" I asked.

"Everyone is invited," Rabbit said as we approached the blue and purple-hued doorway.

--------------

The first hallway was short; the blue and purple ambient glows competed for dominance in a slow, eternal conflict. Echoes turned the noises of distant music and chatter into a sludge.

We arrived at a highly trafficked intersection where six halls converged into a single, boxy space. We weaved through the idle and the slow to take the hallway to the left, where the bathrooms made themselves evident. They spewed sharp fluorescent yellow into the dark hallways, clashing with the moody tone. "One moment," Rabbit mouthed before ducking into one bathroom and then the other without me. When they returned, they leaned close to my ear so I could hear them without them bellowing. "There's a sink in each. Take the one on the right; it's a bit cleaner." I managed a distracted nod. Rabbit smelled nice; some chemical compound gave them the aroma of fresh air through a cool meadow.

The next thing I concretely remember is just leaning against the bathroom counter. I knew better than to run cool water. Steam slithered up the fractured mirror as warm water beat against my arm before flowing down to my fingers, much of it passing over the still irritated burn. My hips were tilted drastically to one side, with one foot stretched out and the other leg bent harshly. Despite the strain across a few muscle groups, I was comfortable. The aches were just annoying enough that I wasn't tempted to close my eyes. Ten to twenty minutes -that's how long I was supposed to stay there. How long had it been? My mind had floated in and out of thought.

I saw shiny shoes step into my hazy view of the ground. The opulent footwear spun and shifted, a new weight on the counter behind me. "Already through your first game?" I looked up at the familiar voice to see my flushed features reflected back, widened by dark lenses.

"Yes," I said simply.

"A harsh one to start with," Sunglasses remarked, looking toward my arm, half-submerged in the sink.

"I've gone through worse for dumber," I assured Sunglasses. Lips pulled into a light purse, concealed gaze moving from me to the powder-dusted counter. Some of it was surely makeup, though I was more confident much of it wasn't.

"You intend to keep playing then, little owl?"

"I do." I did not hesitate to reply.

"So, who did you learn about?"

"Rabbit."

"You sure about that?"

"Yes?"

"Doesn't sound like you are."

"If I'm not?"

"You'll have to wait till you are."

"I hate waiting." I grimaced, turning the water off. My fingertips were starting to tingle like white noise. I curled and uncurled my fist. Each motion caused the burn on my arm to feel tight and sometimes elicited a pinching pain, but all that was manageable. Sunglasses handed me a paper towel I used to dab the water off my arm.

"Mind your head on the way out," Sunglasses said with a wide smile.

"No promises," I said. Sunglasses shook their head before turning to the mirror to peek at their hair. Their advice proved sound. I managed to avoid hitting my head on the edge of the squat doorway.

--------------

The harsh yellow flickered out, and only darkness remained. I grasped out at the abyss in the hope of finding an anchor. I searched for the other bathroom doorway, but it was gone. I spun and spun, stumbling to and fro, but all I found was the ground.

After stopping to huff, a feint white dot appeared in the distance. Taking only two steps toward the light, it twinkled back out of existence. Alone again. I wasn't alone long, though; a new light appeared at the corner of my vision. It smoothly curved up before dipping low for only a moment, and once it reached its original height, it stopped moving.

Another two steps forward.

This time, the light disapproved. The spark turned an unappealing dim before popping loud enough that my back straightened. Immediately, a new light repeated the motion, once more starting in the corner of my eye. Somewhere in the darkness, I could hear a melody struggle for its voice. Buzzing synths tuned to sound like distorted strings held onto a shared chord that stretched over my hesitation.

I squared my shoulders as I had once been trained.

One deep breath in preparation.

I placed my fingers together in front of my pelvis.

Right foot slid forward, and then I rolled my weight onto the tip of my toes. My left foot swept off the ground behind me.

The chord fell to a complimentary third.

I kicked my left foot out before dropping myself down, so the hell touched the ground. My head dropped over the skitter of reversed hi-hats.

My center swooped up to hover over my left foot, shifting from heel to tip-toe.

Back in starting position, the distant light shimmered and vanished.

I became bathed in a new light as an orb flashed to life directly ahead. The light diminished in size as it flew back before spinning around an invisible axis.

A leap forward, right foot leading. Fuzzy strings cut into a diminished fifth, a bass line erupting into a roll that almost disrupted a delicate balance.
I landed on my lead foot, converting my momentum into a spin with one knee still raised. I had barely brought myself to stillness when a new light zipped under the vanishing one. The drums entered, giving a cyclical rhythm to the music.

The newest spark teased out a chase with carefully measured strides. When it rose up, I jumped; when it dropped low, I slid low. More than once, a near-complete split was required to keep pace. When the light stopped, I stopped. It flickered out before my shadow suddenly stretched out before me. A spin to face the light, only for it to turn red, hiss, and pop. Glass bouncing over the ground disrupted the rhythm of keys that traced the strings.

I froze when, once more, I was lit from behind. My shadow reached out to the left, the light moving to my right. One spinning step, and then another, until the shadow again stretched in a single direction. The light moved left, my shadow right, and I mirrored my movements. The keys commandeered the melody, striking short chord after short chord. The strings began to swerve through a complimentary bar.

My shadow lengthened, the light growing closer.

I strode forward.

The light flickered and drew closer again.

I leapt.

The light flickered and drew closer again.

I spun from one foot to the next.

The light began to strobe and drew closer again.

The world and my own body moved in jagged stop-motion. I took a step forward and then swept my foot in a wide arch from behind me. Through the motion, a nagging sensation began to throb from my toe. The tug worsened, turning sharp, as foot orbited me. I watched as bouts of blackness stretched between clear images where my sneaker painted a perfect circle around me. Shards of glass sang a heart-wrenching, discordant melody.

The song drove on.

The light twinkled out before a new source of illumination burst in front of my eyes. It swung forward, and I leaned back. It swung back, and I leaned forward. The light winked out.

I gritted my teeth, my foot feeling warm and numb.

The light swayed right, so did I. It swayed left, and I did the same.
One strobing light replaced another, and I took hobbled strides in one direction, then another. I kept my weight on my spare foot as often as could be managed. Then, the light demanded a spin. Not once. Not twice. Again and again. Failing momentum had the light draw close and weaken.
In an attempt to rebuild my momentum, I threw my weight onto the injured foot, and needles rippled from toe to hip. Every inch of my leg felt like it was being torn open like a seem ripper through damaged cloth.

My strength gave out.

I fell.

Then,


I


kept



falling.

--------------

Like many things, I became accustomed to falling. The fear of such sudden intensity faded into a sensation that would only illicit the dull spirit of self-preservation-driven panic on rare occasions. Some choked, and distant light gave a striated texture to the space that refused to contain me.

My mind painted twisted clouds all around, favoring shades of red and orange. In my more delirious moments, there were hints of lavender and peach. There was an insistence on gravity to be noticed. It constantly tugged on my clothes and pulled my hair, but I could barely give a second thought. I was consumed by the lack of sensation radiating from my foot as if it had been popped off. Yet every time I managed to check, it was still there.

The rushing air hummed like an interlude that refused to end. In all directions, there were just shades of black and gray. Drifting around me was my own body with little care as to which way was upside right.

The air continued to drone, my head picking up on subtle inflections in tone if I tilted it one way or another. Facing what I could only conclude was down, breath was constantly pushed back into my lungs. Despite their experience with misuse, they burned in rebellion.

So, I faced the direction I assumed was up. At least I could breathe semi-freely. Which could possibly be worse? Seeing the ground coming or hitting it without ever knowing?

Above me, thin white lines stretched across my vision. They wavered in a perfect lack of uniformity. Undulating to and fro, they were like waves. Occasionally, the lines twisted new colors along their form before shedding them.

I had seen this before.

Countless times sitting at the bottom of a pool.

It was far too dry, though.

It was also far too loud. The air hummed one note and then another, pushing upon my chest and shoulders.

That was also wrong. The sound was far too complex to be the wind. The heavily authored bells were like crystals struck in a bucket of water.

I blinked, focusing. Where was my head?

It was under a concrete ceiling hidden by a layer of lights that danced over it like the underside of the ocean.

I propped myself up on one elbow. The shimmering light encompassed what was once a plain room, now decorated with hanging sheets and clothes. Mattresses and pillows were turned into lounging areas where groups of people occupied each other's hands and mouths. A teacup was near my head, a stained shard of glass sitting in it.

"I don't recommend drinking that," a youthful voice said.

"I'll take that advice," I acknowledged. Nearby sat an over six-foot boy (that's how they looked to me, but they probably weren't that much younger than I.) He had compressed himself to sitting on a single cushion. Before him was a clock missing its minute and hour hand. The second hand worked just fine, running one lap after the other. I pushed myself up to sit with my legs crossed atop one of the pillows that floated around me.

The boy raised a pink wristband-clad hand, looking at the alcove that presided over the room. Bells cross-faded to keys, bass dipped away before a warmer sound rolled through the walls. People rolled over, crawled, and some even dared to walk to new partners. I must have had a look on my face.

"You know what they say about bodies and temples," The boy said.

"Can't say I do."

"No good without worshipers."

I scoffed. "The body is no temple."

"Then what is it?"

"A tomb."

"Rather morbid," The boy remarked, looking down at his clock.

"How? They're only places that are only temporarily beautiful and always rotting."

"I've never met a body that wasn't beautiful," The boy interrupted.

"You should spend more time looking." I put my hands carefully around my foot and gingerly lifted it to try and get a better look at it. The side of the shoe had been sliced open. The serrated fabric was tinted orange and brown with blood that had dried. I grimaced, widening the hole. Beneath the shell, the sock was rigid, and I could feel it had become stuck to my skin. The dim blue glow made it hard to discern just how concerned I should have been. At the very least, it was dried, and the glass seemed to have already been removed.

"Is it bad?" The boy questioned. He waved his hand once more. The entrancing echo brightened once more before falling into a chilled rhythm. Hands found new occupants, mouths found different company.

"I've danced on worse," I said.

"Should you have?"

"Does that matter?"

"I guess not if you expect disrepair."

"Exactly. Hand me that." A finger pointed at a soft white tee that hung from some hidden line. The boy met my request.

"Your crew waiting for you? You seem in quite the rush to move."

"I'm not from here." I began twisting and turning the fabric, fingers pushing intently at the woven threads. All I needed was a single weakness in the structure to get purchase.

"Not exactly what I asked."

"Can't say I have one."

"Not even back wherever you're from?"

"Not particularly." A single, sudden tear let me start pulling the shirt apart into long, ragged scraps.

"So you always avoid connection?" The boy was prying, and I could feel heat building around my cheeks and behind my ears.

"I avoid it when it's inconvenient."

"So yes."

My face felt stiff and rigid. My back teeth ached to grind together, but I ignored that and ground them together anyways. I turned my attention to trying to peel my shoe off my foot. Every jostle and twist felt like it shook the open wound like an air bubble in a bottle of water. I sighed heavily as my foot pulled free.

A gesture and bodies cycled once more, the change of tracks far from subtle.

The boy, ever at the edge of my vision, seemed to remain mostly intent on me.

"Do you know Rabbit?" I asked, starting to wrap the fragments of cloth around my foot. A bit of extra padding, and I'd be right as rain for the night, I thought. "Not bunnies," I added as his mouth first opened.

"Oh. Hmmm, possibly. They don't stop by in here often."

"But they stop in?"

"Yes."

"Have they tonight?"

"No." Another conducted change of places.

"You may try staying," The boy said.

"I'd rather not." I took a deep breath before starting to work my foot back into my shoe. Standing was a test to see if the injured foot could hold weight. Through the padding, the pain was reduced to that of a blunted needle. It was enough. "Is there an exit?"

"Of course, exits are easy to find." The boy pointed at some darkened corner concealed by overlapping sheets that fluttered in a breeze I couldn't feel.

Through the sheets and over some embracing people, I found an archway. Through it and down a step, I was back in a hall.

--------------

The hallway stretched a few feet to either side. To the left, the hall became an ascending staircase. Neon lights swirled in a mix of colors from somewhere above those first few steps. To the right, the hall began to slope down. Red lights pulsed slowly around the edge of the black gullet.

The exit was indeed easy to find but even easier to ignore.

The incline proved steeper than expected in the dark. The first few steps stumbled, and my feet threatened to abandon me, but I kept upright. Ahead, streaks of red circled and waved around some distant termination of the path. If not for my inner ear complaining about the center of gravity, I would have thought the path was straight and sure.

Step after step, carefully probed the dark for the ground. Sometimes, the floor was closer; sometimes, it was further. At other times, it was to the side and tilted.

The spiraling red glow at the center of my vision adhered to no single shape. Sometimes, the edges highlighted were straight and structured; other times, they curved.

I trudged forward, swearing internally when my sliced foot struck the ground unexpectedly. My eyes told me the goal was fixed and straight ahead; vertigo told me the path was winding.

The red glow alternated between spinning clockwise and counter-clockwise. It changed between stretching out and recoiling. Always, it beckoned closer.

The wall first closed in on my right, though it'd scrape in from the left not long after. I angled my body to a sharper angle with each nudge.

Shadows gave definition to the light, flickering to and fro on the fringes. On rare occasions, darkness broke the bright edge.

One wall pushed on my back, another pushed on my chest. My breaths were shallow. I felt myself tip toward the flickering fissure more and more with each halting step.

The shadows grew more intent on grabbing at the light's brightest edge, breaking the ring into disparate segments.

My heart beat frantically at the surface, pressing down on my ribs. Something grazed the top of my head.

The red glow warped around a dark circle and reached further into the vast expanse of the hall that separated us. The blocking shadows grew sharper, taking on the shapes of stretched forearms and wide hands with slender fingers. Digits tugged at brighter pulsing gleams.

Something grazed my ankle. Then something combed through my hair, next over my shoulder. These fleeting sensations lingered on my skin like the imagined legs of bugs. I wanted to scratch away the sensation, but the narrow passage prevented me.

Shadowy hands pulled light away from the darkened center before plunging into the abyss. Hands reaching in pulled forth hands that reached out. My one guide diminished as hand after hand was pulled from its center.

My temples pulsed. My eyes ached, and my stomach twisted. I knew I wasn't getting enough oxygen, but I was inhaling as deep as the walls pushing sternum to spine would allow.

Distracted by any of the numberable discomforts, my foot hadn't found the floor when I pushed weight upon it. I tipped forward, momentum forcing me down the enclosed space. I was on my side, a manageable pain radiating from my shoulder. I could crane my head back enough to watch hands reach beyond the edges of the red glow.

I twisted my body and pushed against the wall with my toes despite the ripping sensation that shot up from my injured foot. My pace was now measured in inches, but I continued forward.

The shards of light, the few brilliant arms that remained, were growing closer, the darkness between them widening. Something cold cupped around my chin, pressure points pushing on the soft cavity of my jawbone. My vision became blocked before the sensation of palms on my throat made the hall feel smaller than it already was. I found I could move my arms despite the crushing claustrophobia. Before I could claw for my freedom, unseen fingers interlaced with my own and wrapped around my wrists. The red glow now only existed in my slowly fading visual memory.
I remember feeling pulled into the inky blackness, into something cool.

Next, I was rolling, heels over my head.

A high-paced cycle of kicks and toms plodded over a rattling theme.

Above me, the darkness was spattered with pinpoints of lights. They were constellations of stars I didn't recognize. Around me, in all directions, the floor was laid out like natural terrain, with swaths of grass interrupted by patches of dirt and sand. In the distance, the orange glow of a fire propped up someone's dark outline. The dark outline raised a hand in my direction. I returned the wave.

"Smoke break?" she called out over the melancholic bass.

"Yeah," I replied, probably not loud enough to be heard, before getting up and approaching the fire. A giggling couple bumped my shoulder in passing, and we muttered pleasantries to excuse the exchange. As I approached the fire, the girl in a poncho, at least four sizes too large for her, stood up and held out a crumpled pack. A few inches back, a green bracelet hung loose around the girl's wrist.

"Thanks," I said, taking the pack to choose the least crushed cigarette from it.

"You're welcome," the girl chimed like a bell while reclaiming her mostly empty pack.

"Light?" I asked, to which the girl pointed at the fire. Fair enough.
Kneeling by the fire, it was a dry warmth that washed over me. I found a burning stick near the edge and carefully lifted it from the stone-defined confine. My cheeks and nose sensed the heat first. I gingerly balanced the cigarette between my lips while lifting the swaying pale flame. After two attempted pulls, the familiar soothing scratch flowed down my throat and into my lungs. The burning stick was tossed back in with its kin, and I took to sitting on a log across from the girl.

"Better?" She asked.

"Much, thanks again," I said. She shook her head and laughed.

"Do you know if Silhouette played yet?"

"I don't."

"That's okay, I don't think they have; it's way too early."

"What time is it?"

The girl with her large poncho cocked an eyebrow. "Early?"

"Right." I took another long drag before transferring the cigarette between pointer and middle finger. "What type of music does Silhouette make?" I questioned just to placate her inquisitive eyes.

"He mixes a lot of retro techno with dubstep and drum-n-bass. It's all sci-fi inspired. They just put out a whole EP that you're supposed to play alongside Visitors with the music turned off. Gives it a whole different vibe."

"Visitors?"

"Oh! It's an early 90s alien-monster flick. I think Silhouette's music honors the original ending better."

"How so?" I asked before returning the cigarette to the corner of my mouth.

"Well, original audiences complained the ending was too bleak, so they cut a voice over the last minute and used cheery music to give a sense of closure. Silhouette's music-cut removes the voice-over and lets the music linger on the disquieting lack of resolution."

"I'll check it out," I promised, knowing I wouldn't keep the pledge but would genuinely want to.

"I'm trying to arrange a screening closer to Halloween," Poncho said.

"I'm not from here, sorry."

"None of us are," she laughed. "You always can be, though."

"I suppose." I didn't, actually, but the sentiment seemed to make Poncho smile. I leaned out of my seat to tap ash into the fire pit. Poncho waved as a small group joined around the fire. Poncho's pack of cigarettes was passed around, somehow making it back to her with some left. I finished my smoke, letting the gray clouds float away from my lips. I flicked the butt of the toxicant into the fire pit.

"See you later," Poncho stated with a confident enthusiasm I couldn't understand. A thin arm emerged from under her poncho and held out a fist that I impulsively bumped.

"Yeah," I said low before wandering toward the dark the crowd had emerged from. Behind me, jeers clashed with outrageous laughter. The sounds of familiarity I found foreign.

As the fire shrunk behind me, a treeline began to form from the shadows. As I drew closer, I noted the treeline was some mural painted on the concrete wall. Between a few of the painted trees, a doorway hid, a black space almost lost among the dark colors.

--

I stepped into a wall of noise. Airhorns celebrated a refresh of the catchy but straightforward bar repeated again and again with minor variations -mostly new sounds or the resolution of a chord progression. Bouncy and energetic, I enjoyed it, sure, but it was the type of electronic dance music that gentrified the scene. I didn't hear the guy I nearly ran into start retching. I barely avoided his liquid vomit that splashed on his feet and the floor. 

The ceiling here was low enough to watch simple shapes tumble slowly across it. Lights like candy flickered with the bass, lasers of matching hues cut mechanical patterns in the air and around the crowd.

It seemed from every angle a hallway connected to this relatively small space. The crowd bounced and swayed out of sync with the music. The room smelled of sweat and bile, though that was probably the pile of sick I hadn't made it far enough away from yet.

I watched the crowd through the traffic I struggled to get around. Every few seconds, someone on the dance floor fell over. People lazily grabbed at each other between bursts of frantic movement that seldom suited the repetitive beat.

A stripping of the music to a bare keyboard melody had the crowd whooping and hollering for the anticipated drop. Military-style drums cut in, picking up rhythm till the tap of the snare became a single sputtering note. Then, airhorns and a bass low and loud enough to rattle my skull had the crowd tripping over itself.

I was trying to avoid getting swept up in a stream of people when a hand glinting with tasteful decorations swiped in front of me and pulled me close to the owner by the shoulder.

"Thanks," I said to Sunglasses without having to look at them just yet. I was practically yelling just to hear myself.

"You're a little dry to be down here," They commented. They helped navigate around the traffic that rushed around the dance floor.

"So are you," I observed before looking up at their wide grin.

"Touché."

"Did Silhouette play yet?" I asked, although I wasn't sure exactly why. Maybe just for the empathetic relief that someone hadn't missed their anticipated set yet.

"Of course not," Sunglasses remarked. "You listen?"

"Not yet," I said.

"Ahhhh," Sunglasses chuckled. "You gonna come back out for Visitors?" I watched the lights twist and bend in the dark lenses that rested so surely above that smile.

"Maybe," I lied. Sunglasses arched a judging brow but didn't push the subject.

"A misstep?" Sunglasses asked with a flourish toward the limp I had stopped giving mind for the moment. My foot still stung, and a bump at the wrong point consistently sent a shiver of pain tearing up to my knee and through my hip. The burns on my arm were more annoying, especially as the stumbling scraped past me and renewed the ache.

"Something like that," I said.

"You gonna be okay?"

"Of course." I didn't realize I had squared my shoulders or puffed out my chest till after Sunglass's next reply.

"Don't need to convince me." They patted my shoulder before removing their loose hold.

Sunglasses left me there in the pull of the dance floor. I didn't notice at first, but glancing at where I expected Sunglasses, all I saw was their boot vanishing into the mass that retreated down one hallway or another.
Invariably, I tested putting weight on my injured foot. There was pain; I was uncomfortable, but it could be done. Hips and shoulders swayed independently of each other, my body keeping with the rhythm of the beat. I swiped my left foot under my right and then threw my weight into my heel so I could slide over the floor. A few nearby cheered or donned expressions of awe. They drew closer. I was both flattered and annoyed.
I swapped from one heel to the other, feet barely missing each other. I was about to throw my weight into the next slide but jammed to a stop to avoid crashing into someone sloppily transferring weight between their feet. Pain rippled up my leg. They clearly thought they could imitate me, repeating what they thought were my moves through some haze.

I backed away to try and find room to start again. I bumped firmly against someone, irritating the tender burn on my arm. They were running in place with no grace. Another pale imitation. I turned around to catch more, concentrating exceedingly hard on trying to bounce from one foot to another, which was confusing. Children could bounce between feet better than that.

The music paused for a brief moment, allowing the crowd to scream and throw their hands into the air. Horns heralded unseen spigots unleashing a downpour on the dance floor.

The liquid smelled sharp, causing me to scrunch my nose. It wasn't entirely unpleasant, but completely unexpected. It was a chemical smell, much of it immediately recognizable as alcohol.

My skin tingled. My hair began to stick to my ears, neck, and forehead. People around me jumped, screamed, doubled over, shouted, tripped, gagged, vomited. The world before me was devolving, the chaos fading into a comfortable haze. 

I remember contemplating what a lovely shade of red was falling from someone's mouth. Even when I finally realized it was blood-tinged rancor, thick and edged with foam, I wasn't bothered. They weren't alone.

My own gut clenched as I struggled to find a way to hold my weight against a tilting world. Some ancient reptilian part of my brain dumped ice down my spine. A survival instinct, not usually heeded, put me on edge. I understood I needed to escape, even if much of my brain was fuzzy and warm.

There was a comfort and joy to the optimistic and easily consumed EDM. I could afford to dance another moment or two. The hiss of the sprinklers was blending in with the reversed snare. I lifted one foot, trying to stand on my tiptoes, but my leg made a violent refusal. I collapsed onto hands and knees. I coughed and hacked, heat rising from gut to chest.

"Yyyoo kkaayy?" Someone nearby slurred. I waved them off, shakily getting back up. The sting of alcohol was becoming lost under the oppressive odor of stomach acid and copper.

My memory here becomes dim, but it remains reliable enough. I can recall a persistent confusion over the impulse that I needed to be somewhere else -I couldn't figure out where, though.

My efforts to dance were frustrated by the thicket of people that continually formed around me and the delay between thought and action. Eventually, I found myself chasing something down a hall. The dark hall was full of turns and doors. The doors ranged in color and shape, though I'm not entirely confident in that last detail. I found myself chasing something down a hall.
