Everyone keeps telling me to write down all the weird things he does. My friends think the one-off stories are funny—quirky dog stuff. But I’ve always hesitated to put it all together in one place.

I’m not sure if I’m afraid of what other people will think of me or of him. Or if I’m afraid of what it might add up to. Or maybe… maybe I’m afraid he’ll know. That I’m onto him. That I’ve somehow betrayed this delicate trust we built over time.

How do you explain to your friends that you’re scared to write a story about your dog… because you’re scared he might Know?

I lost a bet, so now I’m finally writing it all down. This is everything I can remember about the dog that used to be called Snowball. 

I met him during a delivery. He was tied to a lead in a dusty yard, filthy but excited to see me. The homeowner said he’d been a stray and that her kids had left him behind. She said he was “too good of a dog for the pound.”

After checking with my now-ex-husband, I brought him home. He rode an hour in the car, stressed but quiet. We bathed him. Blow-dried him. He didn’t protest. He wasn’t quite white, but another bath would get him there. I thought maybe he just knew he was safe.

He adjusted fast. He never really responded to his old name, so we gave him a new one. He learned it. Learned the dog door. Potty-trained himself. He even asked for permission to go outside like my other dog despite being double her size. He would stand silently by my door until acknowledged. But then, one day, the boy - as we affectionately call him - stopped waiting. I’d hear the flap at odd hours, see him standing in the yard, still as a statue under the motion light. Always facing the same direction. Like the moonlight was charging him.

He had other quirks. He doesn’t lick, unless he’s wildly happy. He doesn’t bark, except at the front door or in an emergency. He gruffs, huffs, pants, prances. His language is expressive, strange little vocalizations that sound like he’s trying to speak English without human vocal chords. 

And the boy stares. Long, heavy stares. Out the window, into darkness and long after our other dog has lost interest. Into corners and shut doors even when all is still and quiet. At us, sometimes, from just outside the room or down the hall. Always, nose down, eyes up. Still. No blink. Until you acknowledge him or speak. Then he’s all smiles and tail wags – “dog mode” as we call it – like he just remembered the act he’s supposed to put on.

Sometimes, I’ll wake to find the boy watching me through the mirror.

He hates feet. He’ll stand up in a shuffled rush anytime someone attempts to step over him, despite laying in positions to watch over everyone’s movements. Even moving your feet while he’s laying too close is enough to incense him. 

He hates being shut in small spaces. I got finger pinch guards for many of the doors, including the bedroom, and laid one of his dog beds in there so he had a safe space to escape to.  I’ll often find him napping on it during the day time, and he’ll often come lay on it with me when I’m hanging out in bed. I don’t remember when exactly my chronic health issues began, but they’ve steadily gotten worse over time since bringing the boy home. Despite him not being cuddly, there is something soothing about his presence. I loved his company on the days when I spent most of the day in bed. The boy is always sure to sense and stick nearby when I feel at my worst. That’s a reasonably normal dog skill, right?

He hates thunder. If a storm hits, he loses himself. He’ll scratch at doors for them to all be opened, or at doors if that didn’t make him feel better. Once we saw the boy scratch at an open door, as if he thought it was a new door that needed to be opened. We laughed at the time. 

But we didn’t understand what he saw. 

During the first winter after installing the in-ground electric fence, we had an extreme storm that left us without power for multiple days. I remember distinctly taking both dogs out to go potty, and I noticed the boy tiptoeing up to the edge of his allowed territory. I called him back, not wanting him to wander too far in the cold. For a long moment, the boy’s gaze wandered from me to outside the virtual fence, and back, as if his will wavered. But then his gaze met mine and he came trotting back with a wag of his tail. Somehow, I’d forgotten that no power means no electric fence. 

After that, our bond was sealed. I was now chosen. 

And he guarded me. But never slept near me during the night and only briefly during the day. If I lay down to sleep, even for a nap, he left the room. Always. He would keep me company while I laid in bed, but when sleep called, he slipped out of the room like a big white shadow. 

The men in my life were another story though. After my ex and I had lived as a separated couple for more than a year in the same house, I started dating a mutual friend of ours. It caused discomfort for my ex and the boy alike, but for different reasons. After a sleepover one night, I received the following text from my new partner:

“{the ex} said last night that {the boy} looks like an animatronic sometimes. Like he'll turn and look at you and then his ears perk up 😂 or like he'll go stand somewhere and just idle for unusually long periods of time, like if a door is shut that usually isn't he'll just stand at it with his face straight down and just stare at the ground for a REALLY long time, or like he'll look at you but not like from the angle a dog normally would but with his nose down 😂”

My new partner began telling me stories of waking in the middle of the night when he stayed over. Upon opening the door, the boy stood staring in the front foyer. Somehow, he explained, he seemed… annoyed. Irritated. He didn’t guard our door in the same way or lay in the bedroom when we were in there together.

The boy seemed openly unsettled. Soon enough, the new relationship became serious, my ex moved out, and my new partner - and later a new roommate also - moved in. Although I was happy and settled, the boy wasn’t so sure yet. One night, my new partner and I laid in bed, watching TV. I rolled over and whispered to him, “I heard the boy walk up and lay down outside the door, but… I only heard two feet, not four.” He shuddered and gave me a joking, soft shove. “Stop thaaaat! He’s creepy enough already! I don’t need to imagine him walking around the house on two legs too!” 

I laughed and smiled, but I hadn’t been joking. But he knew not to ask. 

Not long after that, I stepped behind the mostly shut door into the bedroom to get dressed. I paused for a moment. I thought I had heard our roommate in the kitchen, but then I noticed. The boy was standing at the door, staring at me, as I stood mid-change, clinging clothes to my near-naked body. Nose down, eyes up. Staring. Breathing heavily. As if some amount of him needed to stake his claim on his ward. His prey? I felt frozen in place. This felt different. 

With the stories my new partner began telling me, I had noticed the boy acting somewhat different toward me too. As if he was reconsidering his stay. Reconsidering his approval and perspective on me. Now, if I passed him while he laid by the front door, he’d stare, nose down, eyes upon me, while I walked by. He appeared like an old painting on the wall, gaze following me as I moved. No tail thumps when I met his gaze, barely even a breath emitted.

At this time, I noticed the boy standing at doors, staring straight down at the threshold, considering them thoughtfully. Had he done this before? Whether the door is open or not, I find him at times staring at the threshold as if it may draw him into another dimension if he doesn’t carefully stabilize his grip on his version of reality.  

Eventually, my partner won him over. Probably with snacks. I remember one night, I found the boy standing silently behind me, staring out the dark window. Just staring. I turned to look at him, and he blinked. Wagged once. Remembered he was supposed to be a dog. Cared to go back into “dog mode.” 

When we sold the house and moved into the camper, something shifted. He stopped leaving when I fell asleep. Stopped wandering to the edge of the yard. Now he just lies outside, next to my new father-in-law, who sits quietly in the sun despite every medical prediction. They don’t talk. They just sit. Breathing. Existing.

The boy is almost twelve now. Dogs his size don’t often make it past nine. But he goes on. Quiet. Still. Present. Watching like he’s waiting for something.

Like maybe he’s been waiting a long time. Far longer than anyone remembers. 

I don’t ask questions anymore. I don’t look at mirrors in the night. 

But lately, I’ve been wondering if he didn’t come for *me* after all.

Maybe he came to protect *whoever needed him most.*

Or maybe not to protect us at all.

Maybe he just has his own rules.

Maybe he’s just… watching.

And maybe… he’s something else entirely.

Because the truth is, I’m not sure he’s even a dog.
