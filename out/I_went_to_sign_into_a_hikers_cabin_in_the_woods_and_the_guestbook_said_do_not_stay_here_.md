I was in New Zealand finding myself in my early 20’s. Failing that I’d found myself a nice girl with a van and we were trekking around surfing and hiking. All I ate was shoplifted trail mix for that whole month. 

We were with this annoying Spanish girl for a bit of the trip and aimed to go on a few day hike in the mountains on the South Island. We joked about losing her along the way to get a moment alone. 

We started the hike in the afternoon and a few hours in we were at our cabin for the night. My pal felt a urinary tract infection coming on and thought it best to turn back. I have that affect on women. I decided I was gonna finish the hike myself. We were mere hours in and I had 2 more days and 2 more cabins to stay at by myself. I was actually kind of looking forward to it for some reason. Wanted to get some early 20’s ruminating done probably. Think about philosophy or some shit. 

First day hike, a bit wet but uneventful. First cabin had modern digs. Wood fire, heaps of bunks. Some old couple there playing board games. Next day I got up and immediately got lost. Ended up off the beaten track and had to turn back. It was raining and slippery and horrible. Lost maybe 3 hours. 

This meant I rocked up to my second cabin right on dark instead of in the afternoon. It was so old that it didn’t have a door. There were sections of wall missing. I immediately tried to get some firewood but everything was wet cos it was still raining. A storm was settling in. There was an old saw on the bench by the guestbook and some remnants of dry kindling. I tried to cut some wood in the rain but it was past dark so I accepted I’d barely have a fire that night. 

The last thing I did before bed was sign into the guest book, so search and rescue know who’s been where and can track you if you get lost. I look at this fucking book and inside it were a few peoples names and the date they stayed. One from ten years ago, one from seven years ago.  Great. Then scrawled in big letters over the rest of the available columns on the page were the words ‘do not stay here’. I lifted the page to see the next, and on the next page over all the columns there was a drawing of what looked like a dog. Like a greyhound in silhouette but with a silly kind of human face stretched down the muzzle. I kinda smiled at it but it chills my blood to think back to now. Just figured the warnings were like a prank or something and the dog was an unrelated doodle. 

I drag a horrible old mattress out of the tiny sleeping quarters with a few old bunks and I make a bed down by my sputtering fire. As I’m setting wet wood to dry by it, I see a metal plaque above the fireplace. It reads ‘hound cabin’. Basically it just details that some old bloke and his dog lived up here and one time the river raged such that he couldn’t get across to get their usual supplies and they died. 

This kind of freaked me out to be honest and I thought for a second about what to do. The fire was sputtering and casting these deep shadows across the cabin, and no fucking door. I could see trees swaying and the rain bucketing down outside. I was defenseless. I put my coat back on and walked down the path to see if I could see the way back. It was stormy but I had a good head torch, maybe I could finish the hike tonight and not sleep in the creepiest cabin ever. But as I walked ahead a bit i realised there was a full river right there. It was too swollen to cross and I could only make out the stepping stones to get over it because water was hitting them and spraying up in the air. It just wasn’t safe.

So I head back to the cabin to try and get some sleep. I’m sort of laying there, uncomfortable when I’m facing the door and getting chills on my neck when I’m facing away from it. I think I must’ve been exhausted enough that I managed to fall into a shallow sleep despite my extreme anxiety. Just imagining this dude and his dog. 

At some point in the night something ran into the cabin. Full on ran in. Dog toe nails on crude wooden floorboards. My eyes shot open, I was on my back. My fire was dead, and the black silhouette of a skinny dog stood between me and the dark blue hue of the sky through the door. It had noticed me and bowed its head down defensively. It walked toward me in this unnatural way. Like it had human shoulder blades protruding with each step like a man walking on his hands and feet. Lighting cracks outside and lights up its face and the breath disappeared from my lungs. Straight up winded me. It was like a humans skin had been stretched over a malnourished greyhound. The head was the shape and profile of a dog, but stretched over it was the misshapen face of a man. The hounds feet looked like a human walking on its knuckles. It seemed basically hairless, and had pallid white skin. 

It was basically over me at that point. I was in its house, and it wasn’t pleased. I closed my eyes as it proceeded to aggressively sniff me all over. It’s nose scraping against my sleeping bag. One paw stood on the mattress as it moved down my body. I just kept my eyes shut and found myself repeating that this was just terrible sleep paralysis. Eventually I felt it settle at the end of my mattress. But i didnt look to see. I’ve had sleep paralysis before it had to be that. I was on my back, that’s when I get it. There’s no way this man ate his dog and this was their fate. Nope, just sleep paralysis. 

In the morning I found a dogs skull up on one of the roof supports. I crushed it underfoot before I left. The river was still swollen but I waded through and never looked back.
