In [my first post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/125wj5e/im_a_security_guard_who_works_the_night_shift_at/), I revealed the extraordinary demands of my position — keeping a close eye on terrifying things that wish to destroy humanity. In [my second post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1278rap/im_a_security_guard_who_works_the_night_shift_at/), I explained that my boss seems to be *actively* working towards ending mankind.

There was something that I avoided for two years: Harper Andrews. The woman who could provide answers to all of my questions. Yesterday afternoon, I visited her at the local psychiatric ward.

“I know why you’re here,” Harper said.

The woman was slender, and she wore pristine white attire. Her brunette hair was glistening in the midday sun. It hung in prim and proper plaits which made me shudder. She was the spitting image of her painting — *Harper’s Youth Dies*. That was unnerving, given that she was a couple of decades older than the version of herself that she’d painted.

“The paintings,” I eventually replied.

Harper smiled, motioning at the seat opposite her in the deserted canteen. I nodded awkwardly and slumped into the stiff plastic chair on the other side of the table. A member of staff loitered in the canteen doorway, keeping a watchful eye over us.

“Two years on the job, right?” Harper asked. “I think you would’ve summoned the courage to visit me a long time ago if this were only about the Exacter.”

I shivered at the very mention of the name, and I quickly glanced at the member of staff — just to ensure that he only stood six-feet tall. For a fleeting moment, I thought the nightmarish man from the painting had been hunching in the doorway and watching me.

“I’m not blaming you,” Harper continued. “I just want to save time. My sister isn’t evil. In fact, she’s a kindhearted woman. And maybe part of her is still in there, but it’s not the part that’s in control. She longs to free the Exacter and… the others.”

I paused for a long time, staring into the dejected eyes of the woman before me. She looked sharp. Focused. *Well*. Not at all what I had expected.

“Why… Why haven’t you… If Amy…” I trailed off.

Harper sighed, reading my mind. “Yes, I suppose killing her would’ve brought an end to things, wouldn’t it? Yet, somewhere deep down, she’s still my sister. I’m sorry. And why, you might wonder, hasn’t she *already* freed the creatures from their painted prisons?”

“That final question is the one that really needs to be answered, I think,” I said.

Harper nodded. “Do you have your phone with you?”

“Yeah,” I replied. “Why?”

“Record my story,” She said. “I need you to document the knowledge that I’m about to pass onto you. Nobody has ever believed me, but *you* will. You’ve seen what’s at stake.”

This is the transcript:

*The year was 2003. I was eight years old, and Amy was in her twenties. My birth certainly caused an upheaval. Mum was a full-time lawyer, and Dad was a historian. They thought their days of parenting were long behind them.*

*“Mum, did I ruin Dad’s life?” I once asked.*

*“You were the best curveball that life threw at us, darling,” My mum promised, and we chuckled.*

*Dad loved us, but he spent so much time abroad. He wasn’t quite so busy or successful in his youth, so I think he worried that he had been a better father to Amy. One fateful day, he sought to rectify that.*

*“Machu Picchu,” He said. “Let’s go. You and me.”*

*“What’s in Pikachu?” I asked.*

*My dad laughed. “Machu Picchu. It’s a lost city. I think you’ll love it. You could paint it. Your talents are wasted on the dull scenery around here!”*

*I didn’t think I’d enjoy ancient ruins, but I couldn’t pass up the opportunity to spend time with Dad. And he seemed so excited about the place.*

*It was stunning. My eight-year-old brain wasn’t immature enough to overlook that.*

*And after hours of watching my father excavate what he called “a point of interest”, the man finally started to dance jubilantly. I stopped painting to see what had enthralled him. The fruit of his labour was a large slab of stone, and it was covered with dreadful etchings of ghastly creatures.*

*My dad started jabbering ecstatically about the magnitude of what he’d uncovered. He spent a decade connecting dots between the mysterious vanishings of advanced cultures. There were indicators of a destructive force — a plague greater than anything earthly.*

*He said there were entities which sought to destroy humanity, though their origin remained a mystery. They certainly weren’t bound by physical laws. And my father uncovered detailed writings on rituals which successfully contained the abominations.*

*He said salvation always came from imprisoning the entities. But they couldn’t be killed, and they would always seek freedom.*

*That was what terrified me.*

*They would always seek freedom.*

*And my father held their prison in his very hands. He had unearthed something which should have been left alone.*

*When we returned to England, I slipped into my father’s study and found his translated texts. I had a terrible feeling about the stone slab that he’d brought home. So, I studied the ritual that could imprison the entities. It involved detailed drawings and a watcher.*

*But who was watching the drawings whilst they were buried beneath the earth in Machu Picchu?*

*Nobody. My father’s research seemed to suggest that the Inca artist in Machu Picchu had cleared uncovered a new ritual*  *— something which allowed the Incas to trap the demons more successfully than their predecessors.*

*If my father had only let it be, you would still be living a normal life, Frank Hull. None of us would be in this mess.*

*Things quickly took a dark turn. My parents started bickering about that stone slab. Dad would obsessively stare at it until the early hours of the morning. He said it spoke to him.*

*When my mother couldn’t take it anymore, she left. Amy and I were distraught, and we hated our father. That was when my sister did something stupid.*

*She destroyed the stone slab with a sledgehammer.*

*Everything quickly fell apart. The Exacter and his deformed creatures steadily rose from the shattered stone, and I fled the room. It was the moment I had dreaded — the prophecy which had riddled me with nightmares.*

*I locked myself in my room and unboxed the paintings that I completed — in preparation — weeks ago. To imprison the freed demons in a new picture, however, a ritual was required. As many artists had done before me, I dislodged one of my teeth.*

*Bloody-gummed and teary from the agony, I started to shakily etch my name into each of the paintings with my baby tooth. And the most horrifying thing happened — one by one, black masses started to slither under my door. The creatures were unwillingly latching onto their painted forms. They were being trapped in a fresh prison.*

*The house fell unnaturally still. I crept out of my bedroom and called for my family.*

*When I entered the living room, I shuddered. The demons were gone, but my dad was sitting in his rocking chair. His eyes were vacant, and he was… smiling. It was a wicked grin — something beyond your darkest imagination. Blood oozed through finger tears in the fabric of his shirt. He had been clawing at his own flesh. He was still alive, but he didn’t move a muscle or utter a word. He just grinned.*

*Amy, meanwhile, was curled on the sofa in a foetal position. She was bawling her eyes out. And when the police arrived, they discovered disturbing.*

*Mum never left.*

*Her body was found in the garden shed — she’d been decomposing for weeks. I was never saw the scene, but I vividly remember one of the paramedics throwing up on the grass.*

*Our father went to prison, and Amy became my guardian. I explained everything to her, but she didn’t believe me. So, I kept a daily watch over the paintings, and, years later, I used my inheritance money to open the art gallery. I thought it would lessen the burden if other eyes were on the paintings.*

*Amy helped to run the place. She had her hands in lots of different money pots, so she didn’t mind that the gallery was… a bit of a money-burner.*

*However, one day, she changed. She came home from the gallery with a vacant look in her eyes. A look that reminded me of Dad. She told me that she finally believed my story.*

*She saw the Exacter step out of its painting.*

*I couldn’t always be at the gallery, but Amy promised she would never leave the paintings unattended. She admitted that she had gone out to grab some food before locking up for the evening.*

*If she hadn’t returned in time, I… I suppose you and I wouldn’t be having this conversation right now. The world would already have ended.*

*Anyway, my sister changed over the following years. She grew cold and distant. I started to see a darkness in her eyes, and she spoke in a voice that… wasn’t hers. I became so fearful of her and her malevolent smile that I had a nervous breakdown. And that was her ticket — well, the Exacter’s ticket.*

*She had me committed to this ward four years ago. I suppose the Exacter thought that, without me in the way, he could puppeteer Amy to free him from the painting. All she had to do was make sure nobody looked at him.*

*But why haven’t things already fallen apart? Why did she hire guards to keep watch?*

*Well, she still plays by my rules because I have something that the Exacter needs.*

*If it had so wished, that terrifying creature would have driven my sister to kill me, much as it drove my father to kill my mother.*

*But it needs the tooth that I used in the ritual.*

*The Exacter always uses slaves to achieve that goal. It seeps into people’s minds. At its behest, I’m certain my dad must have destroyed whatever Incan tool was used to etch the drawings on the stone slab.*

*So, if Amy were to close her eyes or, better yet, destroy the paintings, it wouldn’t be enough to free the entities. Sounds like watching them might be unnecessary then, eh? As long as I keep the tooth hidden, you can just quit your security role and call it a day. No way the Exacter can fulfil its destiny. Right?*

*The problem is that an unwatched Exacter, whilst unable to end the world, becomes freer and freer with every passing moment. Free enough to find me without Amy’s help, perhaps, and infiltrate my mind to find the tooth’s location. As long as somebody keeps watch, they remain in their paintings.*

*Their real power lies in servants. My dad. And now Amy.*

*She visits me often, and she only wants one thing from me. The tooth. But I still hold the power. She does what I say. Otherwise, I’ve threatened to… end things. The secret dies with me.*

*The Exacter uses her to wear me down, but I’m stronger than it thinks.*

*And that’s everything, Frank Hull. The rest is a mystery even to me.*

I stopped recording at that point, and I exhaled deeply. There was so much information to digest. Have you seen the length of that transcript? Sorry to anyone who didn’t prepare themselves for such a gargantuan body of text.

“Amy’s trying to sabotage things,” I explained. “She let *Harper’s Youth Dies* out of the gallery.”

Harper sighed. “It might be time for me to-”

“- No, I didn’t mean that,” I firmly said.

Harper’s eyes were brimming with tears. “I’m tired, Frank. I’m so *fucking* tired. I’m just one person.”

“You’re not alone,” I said. “I’ll keep watch.”

She sniffled. “And what happens when *you* reach your breaking point, eh? Maybe this is bigger than us. Maybe we need to tell someone.”

I scoffed. “Who? The government? You think that would be a good idea? Give the Exacter hundreds of minds to infiltrate. It’s dangerous enough that your paintings are visible to the public.”

“You and I won’t live forever to fight the good fight,” Harper pointed out.

“Then we’ll keep looking for people to take up the mantle. Or maybe we’ll eventually figure out what that Incan artist did to *truly* seal the lid on these monstrosities,” I said. “He found a way to put them in the fucking bin for good. No watcher needed.”

Harper sighed. “I guess there’s one more thing you should know.”

“What?” I asked.

“The tooth,” She said. “It’s in the house-”

“- Woah, stop!” I barked. “What are you doing? The secret dies with you, remember?”

“Yeah, but Amy’s never going to stop looking for it, so you need to keep her away from the base-” Harper began.

“- Please,” I cried. “I don’t know why you’re telling me this! I just… I have a bad feeling…”

I looked up to find that the member of staff had left, and that was when the clamp tightened on my gut. The sun seemed to dim, and an emptiness filled the room — I know that sounds like a contradiction, but I’m sure Harper felt it too. Her eyes widened.

“Frank…” Harper gulped. “Is there a red Range Roger in the car park?”

Legs trembling, I crept over to the canteen window and squinted. A greying cloud hovered heavily above — blue sky lay beyond the solitary omen. There seemed to be no other visitors. Beside my white Mitsubishi, there was only a crimson Range Rover. I shrieked in horror.

“Frank,” Harper began. “You need to-”

A splintering sound echoed around the canteen, and I spun around to see something sickeningly sinister. Harper’s neck had been snapped backwards, and her upside-down head hung over the back of her chair — much like those menacing exacters in the art gallery so many months ago.

In the doorway of the canteen, there stood a figure too tall for the frame. I screamed, squinting my eyes, but it was *Amy*. She seemed to be a regular height, but I know what I saw for a fleeting second.

I chased her out of the building, heart racing as I prepared to meet a similar fate, but the Exacter spared me — it had other plans. Besides, Amy was nimble. I was no threat. She’d driven away before I could reach her.

That was three hours ago. I know where she’s going. The good news is that their family house is in Ireland, so it’ll take some time for Amy to get there.

The bad news is that it’ll take some time for *me* to get there too. I’m currently waiting for a flight.

Tomorrow, the world might end. Cherish your loved ones.
