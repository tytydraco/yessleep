I’ve worked at this bar for the last year and a half. It’s been just like every other bartending gig i’ve had before, got some regular drunks who wait at the door for you to arrive for your morning shift, young college kids trying to use their fake ID’s on nights when we have cheap specials, and bumbling idiots who are only looking to cause a ruckus. That was all until about six months ago when I began experiencing events that are not only weird, but make me want to believe in the paranormal. 



I’ll give you some background as to who I am and the place that I work at. My name is Anthony, but most of my co-workers and regulars just call me Ant. I’m 23 years old and have been working in the service industry since I was 17, so I’ve seen my fair share of shit while working. I won’t bore you with details of the past places I’ve worked because there is nothing noteworthy to say about them. I also won’t give out the name of the place I am currently at because I don’t need any crazy people online trying to visit me. I will say it’s a local dive bar not on the best side of town, but also not the bad side of town either. Not much to write home about on the inside, the bartop seats about 12 people, we’ve got a pool table that runs on quarters, and a small tv we keep up in the corner for big sporting events. We get a wide variety of people coming in, but they are usually on a schedule so it’s easy to predict what type of crowd will come when. Morning shift is usually populated by locals from the baby boomer generation that like to sip on Budweiser and Jameson. During the weekdays the night shift is typically pretty slow and consists of those same morning dwellers sleeping on the bartop and needing a cab called for them. On the weekends we usually get a solid bunch of college kids from the local state school who like to come for the cheap beer and special on red headed slut shots. 



Like I mentioned before I’ve begun dealing with something at work that nobody else seems to understand other than me. Around six months ago there was a new guy that came in during one of my morning shifts. I was working solo like usual because we don’t often get that many people on weekdays. He’s about five foot ten inches tall, looked about 30 years old, and was wearing dark khaki pants, a black dress shirt, tan shoes, and a white blazer with multi-colored large polka dots on it. He didn’t seem like a weird guy when I first interacted with him, he politely asked for a miller high life and a cold pint glass to go with it. He would then sit there for exactly 3 hours, stare forward, and only break his gaze or talk to anyone when I asked him if he needed another beer. He would have anywhere from 12-15 beers per sitting, but would never show any sign of intoxication. He did this every day for a month straight at the same time every morning that I was working.



After a month was when things began to change. He would still come in at the same time and in the same outfit that day, but this time he ordered something different with his miller high life. He ordered a shot of 151 proof rum which I found to be a little odd because people offered to buy him shots in the past, but he always ignored them. When I gave him the shot he took a lighter out of his pocket and lit the shot on fire, he then asked for a double shot of rum so I gave it to him just to see if he was really gonna drink all of it. When I gave him the double shot he instantly threw it on his chest, splashing the alcohol all over his clothes and face. He then took the lit shot and threw it in the exact same spot, igniting his whole body in an instant. He began to char and turn a sickly blackish, reddish, amalgamation of flesh and fire. His face was the first to start seeing any serious deformities, his left eye was beginning to wither out of its socket and dropped out like a pinball going into the starting slot. His ears crisped up as if they were slices of potatoes in an air fryer. It was all very reminiscent of the melting of the nazis in that one Indiana Jones movie. I began to panic because of course I’d never been trained to deal with a customer committing suicide before. I looked around at the couple of other patrons in the area, but they didn’t seem to notice anything, they just kept laughing and joking with each other while they sucked on the teat of their bottles. I ran to grab the fire extinguisher from the back and when I got back I closed my eyes and started blasting at him with no regard for anything or anyone around me. 



When I opened them up I saw the bartop and some of my customers covered in extinguisher foam, but I didn’t see any sign of the polka dot man or any burn marks made by the flames. The regulars all just laughed and busted my balls about “spraying my white foam” on them. I asked them about the fire and they told me I just suddenly freaked out, grabbed the extinguisher, and foamed them. I gave them all a free round for their trouble, but I just couldn’t get over the fact of how it all felt so real to me. When I left that day I just hoped I would never have to see that polka dot guy again and that he was just a weird day dream that my mind wanted to make up.



The very next day he walked in right at 11:35 just like he had for the last month before, he sat down, ordered a miller high life, and stared forward. I had a thousand yard stare on him from the moment he stepped through the threshold of the doorway. I figured I had to have imagined what happened the day before because fact was that the man who burnt to a crisp in front of my eyes was now sitting in my gaze without so much as a scratch on him. After he ordered his beer from me I began to question him about what happened the day before. I asked if he was okay, if he went to the hospital, how he got out of the bar without me seeing. He wouldn't answer a single thing I said and just looked forward with those soulless pale blue eyes. The only words that would leave his mouth were “Miller High Life” between every few questions that I’d ask. Once I realized that talking to him was pointless I just placed the cold bottle in front of him and watched him out of the corner of my eye for the shift. He never did anything out of the ordinary (for him anyway) and at 2:35 sharp he asked for his check, I gave it to him, he paid, left a 30% tip, and began walking to his car. 



His car was parked on the other side of the road in perfect view of the propped open door. I watched as he walked to his car, unlocked it, settled down in the front seat, adjusted his mirrors, then he turned his head to look at me. He never had much of an expression on his face when he was in the bar, mostly just a blank face of an emotionless void. No expression of malice or joy has ever stricken his face, until he looked at me from the drivers side window of his beat up 1998 Toyota Camry. He had a wide grin on his face, one that curled at the corners of his lips similar to that of the grinch from the old Dr. Suess cartoon. Although his smile was tall and wide his teeth never showed, it was as if he was trying to hold something on the inside of his mouth while experiencing a renowned feeling of ecstasy. His eyes told a different story, they showed the expression of fear. His eyebrows raised so high that they nearly touched the base of his already receding hairline. Eyes squinted as if he had just gotten a fist full of sand thrown directly in them. 



We maintained eye contact for what felt to me like an eternity while he reached into the glove compartment of his car. He pulled out a small six shooter revolver that looked like it couldn't have been any more than a pea shooter. We keep a rifle below the bar so I knew that if he tried anything funny that I would be able to tag him before he could even step out of the car. 



Although he didn't make any movements to the door handle or anything like that, he was just there keeping his eyes locked with mine while he slowly pushed the gun towards his left shoulder. He fired a shot, but the gun made no sound, and I could see as the bullet passed through the flesh on his shoulder and out through the back side of the driver's seat. Faster than I could even think he placed the gun on his right shoulder and did the exact same thing. He then followed with his left and right kneecaps leaving the car door flooding with blood. For his fifth shot he placed the gun on the side of his cheek and let the shot go, his smile was now extended even further on the left side of his face now stretching all the way to the back of his ear. Throughout the entire process he never broke eye contact with me, it was like he wanted me to watch and he only wanted me to watch. I still see that same god damn face every time I close my eyes, it has been burned into my memory for as long as I live. For the final shot on his revolver he placed the gun directly on his temple and pulled the trigger. I watched as the expression on his face left and his body sank lower and lower into the recesses of his car. I immediately ran out to go check on him and call an ambulance, but just as it was with the fire extinguisher, I opened the car door and there was no body, no blood, no gun, no sign that a person had ever even been in the car. 



At this point I was petrified to come into work, I called in sick for the next few days to avoid the man and try to make any sense of what was happening to me. Was I going insane? Was I having a schizophrenic episode? Had I been secretly drugged with a strong psychedelic? After four days of sick time I was running low on money, and had no further answers. I knew the rent was coming up next week and I needed to start making some quick cash again, so I asked my co-workers if the polka dot man had come in at all. They said they hadn't seen anyone that looked like the guy I described to them. I figured that meant he was gone for real this time and I could safely return back to work.



The next week I worked 5 days, Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday, and Sunday, with all of them being morning shifts except for Saturday. That week, without fail, the polka dot man routinely came in and found a gradually more sadistic way to end his own life. On Monday he used one of the bar toothpicks to execute himself by stabbing thousands of small wounds starting with his chest, then face, then stomach, and then his arms and legs until he was nothing but a deep crimson figure continually spilling out on the bartop. Tuesday he took the CRT that sits in the top right corner of the bar and placed it on the nearby pool table, he walked calmly to the opposite side of the bar, about 15 or so feet back, and ran full force with his head into the old tv. This day made me realize that I am not going totally insane, when he first shattered the screen it caused a surge in electricity causing his body to convulse for a few minutes after impact, but the bar also had a few seconds where the power went out. Once it came back some of the patrons asked what happened to the lights and thought there may be a storm outside, but it was clear as anything. Now I know that to a degree other people can see the effect the polka dot man has on the environment, but I am the only one who seems to actually see him. 



Thursday was an interesting day because it was the first one where he broke his routine. It wasn't a huge change, but he brought with him a newspaper and instead of his usual sit and stare he read for the duration of his stay. After he finished reading 3 hours later he took the newspaper and folded them up into razor thin, sharp triangles. He took the paper and began to slowly make cuts all over his body in the same order as he stabbed the toothpicks. He also acted differently this time than when he did his whole “Death by a thousand toothpick stabs”. He was looking right at me this time with that same fucking smile that he had in the car. Those same dead and narrow eyes, that same absurdly wide smile, and the same cartoonishly raised eyebrows. I couldn't look away as he cut himself, once he got to his stomach the wounds began to get deep enough to allow for more than just blood to leave his body. He dug the paper into the base of his stomach as far as it would allow before his hand went inside and he then sliced vertically up his body until the paper met with his adams apple. I was expecting what I had seen in the movies before, the usual intestines and guts and flesh to start spilling out from him. Instead what I was met with was a flooding sea of blood exiting the cavity in the middle of his body. 



He laid sunken back with his head slouching off the back of the bar seat and once the liquid was done flowing I looked inside of him and found nothing. It was hollow, no organs, no bones, nothing. There were only two thoughts running through my head at this moment, if I turn away then this thing will disappear, and that now would probably be my only chance to investigate whatever this was. I climbed over the bar, ignoring the chuckles and pestering from the few regulars that sat in their stools, and got closer to the open hole. Before my hand could touch it a hand reached up to grip my wrist with the force of a doberman closing its teeth into an intruder. With a petrified look on its face it said only three words to me “please turn around” in a soft, almost whispering, tone. I didn't know what else to do but comply and turn around, by the time I turned back the thing was gone and my regulars began asking for their free round for having to deal with my weird bullshit.



Friday is the reason why I’m writing this today. It came back like always, but almost immediately after I served him his typical Miller High Life he asked to buy an entire bottle of Chambord. We’re mostly a beer and shot type of bar so the Chambord has been sitting on the shelf unopened since the establishment of the bar. I gave the bottle to it mostly because I knew the bill would be higher and he always tipped at least 30% so I was looking for that tip. 



Once he got a hold of it he opened his mouth as wide as it could possibly go and began to insert the bottle inside. It struggled at first, but after a couple of minutes was able to use the bottle's force to rip open and expand the size of his jaw. The lower half became unhinged and just hung off the bottom of its face. All while the shape of his face transformed into a wide, endless cavern struggling to fit the perfectly spherical glass inside. After another minute of struggle the glass shattered and forced deep and sharp cuts all along the inside of its mouth and face. The contents of the liquor spilled all over its body, the countertop, and the floor below us. Meanwhile it did not stop ingesting what was left of the glass, shards were continuously thrown carelessly into the chasm as if it were a teenage boy popping tic tacs before a first kiss. I could not do anything but stare in awe until every last shard was erased from existence. Rage began to fill me from the inside out, I could not stand to see this thing come back again and I decided then and there to attack it with one of the pint glasses that was nearby. I picked up the glass and smashed it over the side of its head causing an immediate response from it in return to right hook me in the opposite side of my head. From what the regulars told me they said I suddenly blacked out and they called for an ambulance to come get me.



Two days ago I woke up in the hospital bed surrounded by the only people that ever cared about me, my local degenerate drunks. They filled me in on how I got there and told me the doctors said I blacked out from exhaustion and should take a few days off of work. To my surprise there was no injury on my head and no pain to speak of, I knew I had to have been hit pretty hard to be knocked out on impact and if it was caused by the impact on the bartop I’d have some sort of sign to show for it. I got checked out that afternoon and came home to think of a plan to beat this thing or die trying. 



The plan was very simple and would end my suffering one way or another. I will go into work today as usual, I told my boss I was feeling fine and just needed a day's rest, and I will wait for that thing to come in at 11 as usual. Once it sits down and has their precious Miller High Life in front of them I will grab the rifle below the bar and put a bullet right between that sick son of a bitch’s eyes. If that does not work and it looks like it will retaliate against me like it did before I will turn the rifle on myself and pull the trigger. I cannot live in this consistent torment, I fear that even if I move or get a new job that the polka dot man will follow me there. I’d rather be dead than have to experience this horror. 



My shift starts in an hour, I’ll come back and give an update if I am successful. If not I would like you all to know that I am not upset about ending my life, I’ll finally have peace.
