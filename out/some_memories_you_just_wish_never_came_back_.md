For most the innocence and naivety of being a child are some of the fondest memories to look back on, this is not one of those stories.

As an adult my childhood memories have been overcasted by a thick fog until either family or a childhood best friend brings up a event or story from when we were kids. I pretend to play along, nod my head and convince them to the best of my abilities that I do indeed remember that one summer twenty years ago. 

However just like the fragrent smell of your grandma's homemade cookies filling the house with a sweet air, that one old nostolgic song that brings you back to "the good old times" or the family photo of you all together some things can throw you right back into a sense of nostalgia, joy and wonder.

Every now and again, that very same effect occurs but instead it evokes a sadness, a painful experince or a memory you've buried down so deep inside you've forgotten in its entirety that it ever even happened.

It wasn't until I revised my old childhood house with my wife and saw that rustic brick wall on the old barn style house and willow trees that I felt for the first time in years, a coldness that I had forgotten existed.

It's the early 2000s, at this time I'm around the age of seven or eight. My family had moved from an Air Force Base in Northern Idaho to a small city outside of Boise called Nampa to a house on the far outskirts of the city with a horse pasture, aged and worn red barn and a single story home with plenty of room for our family of six.

 As most kids, moving to a "brand new" house that thrill of running into the front door and making a mad dash into the nearest empty room to claim your new bedroom was as sweet as this story gets.

I am the middle child, the first to enter the house was my older brother, he is 4 years older then me and faster. He ran through the front door with me trailing behind, hooked a left down the hall and claimed the first door on the right. I run slightly past him to claim the door across from him on the left.

By this time my Mom and Step-dad have entered the house to graciously inform me that the bedroom I had picked was already planned to be shared by my little brother and sister so I ended up with the room farthest down the hall and to the right. I was... ecstatic to be relocated. 

The room was medium sized, plenty enough for my battle scarred bunk bed that I had once shared with my older brother, my early 2000's inflatable transparent couch, a small handy-down toy box and a dresser. If you were to be outside and facing the front of the house, my bedroom was located on the far back left side tucked away in the corner with a window on the side of the house that gave you a view of a dreary willow tree and the old, worn down barn. 

Nothing overly eventful happened for the first year or two, we had fully moved in, adjusted to the new house and found it to be our home. It wasn't until one week in 2003, that that home became a memory we all wished to forget. 

At night the moon shined on the left side of the house peering through the hanging willow tree branches shining into my room casting a marionette of shadows on my bedroom wall. This had always creeped me out, I never quiet got use to the stillness of the silent nights, the quiet sound of willow tree branches scraping against my window and the eerie feeling that you felt disconnected to the rest of the urban city. 

This is where the first night that the naive childhood fear of the dark turned into something that would haunt me twenty years later. 



Night One: Saturday

Earlier in the week the horror movie Darkness Falls had just come out on VHS, against the better judgment of my parents and out of pure curiosity I protested to watch it with my parents and older brother late at night.

After what felt like hours of looking behind my fingers and looking away from the screen the movie had done its job and absolutely terrified me. Since I adamantly protested to watch the movie, my parents refused to let me sleep in their room and my older brother wasn't about to have his bedroom invaded by a scared senseless child. The movie had ended and it was now time for us kids to all to go to bed. 

 I reluctantly moved down the hallway making sure all the reachable lights where flipped on and made my way into my bedroom where I cracked the door slightly open and crawled into the bottom bunk that was parallel to the window. As usual the willow tree branches shadows danced across the room and the sound of wind beat against the window. 

Over a lengthy time with my head under my blankets I drifted off to sleep only to be woken up to a slight tapping sound on the window, at first I though it was just the willow tree branches scraping against the window until I realized the sound was deeper,  more of a light but dull thudd rather then the scraping I had reluctantly become accustomed to. 

I kept the blanket over my head for what fell like an eternity until eventually the rythmic noise of tapping had stopped. I immediately got up, bolted for the door and proceed to wake my parents up in the middle of the night terrified. They assumed it was due to the movie we had all just watched, let me stay in their room for about half an hour until my mom got up and walked me back into my dimly lit room,  tucked me back into bed, told me everything is okay and told me to get some sleep.



Night Two: Sunday

Over the course of the day I had told my older brother about the tapping sounds, he lightly laughed and teased me that  Esmerelda (the creature from the horror movie) was going to get me as he proceeded to climb one of the willow tress in the back yard. As night rolled around, I wasn't thrilled about being alone in that room but I mustered up the courage and decided I was going to power through. I got back into bed, this time on the top bunk as I had decided it's safer up there then on the bottom where the bed sat just below the bottom window seal. 

I then slowly drifted off to sleep however when I woke up, it wasn't morning. A light was seeping its way into my window and into my eyes. I convinced myself it had to be morning, maybe I slept in, Why else would it be so bright? It took but a moment until my eyes adjusted that I saw it, shrouded by the night  just past the willow tree, peeking through the branches within the moonlight and through the large front doors of the barn, the hanging light had been turned on. 

For a few seconds I watched as the light swayed back and forth through the doors until it abruptly turned off and the doors slowly shut with my eyes readjusting to the darkness and in a sleepy haze yawned as I crawled out of bed, turned on the hallway light on my way to the restroom. Passing each closed bedroom door on my way and for the first time it struck me. Everyone in our house was asleep.

My eyes widen with the realization as panic started smothering  me like a weighted blanket, I ran to the end of the hall threw open my parents bedroom door and started to cry as I poorly tried explaining what I had saw just a few moments ago. This time my step-dad was the one to get up and out of bed, he wasn't enthralled with being woken up so abruptly in the middle of the night a second time nor was he the kind of guy to entertain nonsensical stories.

He grabbed me by my arm ushering me out of the room into my bedroom and sternly told me to look out the window, pointing out there was no light, no open doors, no anything. I was instructed to stay in my own room, to quit waking them up at night and to go to bed. He stood up and without another word, walked out of the room closing the door behind him allowing the branches shadows to cast endlessly through the window



Night Three: Monday 

My step-dad had returned to the Air Force Base for the week so it was just my mom, older brother and little brother and sister at the house for a few days. That wasn't  anything new as my step-dad was a active duty jet mechanic so him leaving to base and coming home on the weekends was a fairly normal occurance. 

During the day at school I had told all my friends about what had happened over the weekend, I told them about the tapping, the barn light being turned on in the middle of the night and how neither my older brother or parents believed what I had heard or saw. 

They reluctantly pretended to play along with the story and went on about their day.
The third night was quiet, nothing to strange or out of the ordinary that I wasn't accustomed to. When I woke up, it was morning. 

Nothing went bunk in the night and I was more then relieved, thinking about how I was just being paranoid and how that movie really got me worked up. I got dress for school with my older brother and my mom walked us out to the bus to be picked up. We got on, I sat next to my older brother as we pulled away from the house my brothers demeanor changed, as I looked at him, then past his shoulder I saw it to. The barn doors were wide open.



Night Four: Tuesday

Nick was more reserved then usual today and I could tell my older brother was visbly shaken throughout school and the evening. Some thing you should all know is that Ive always had a guilty conscious, as a kid even more so.

I didn't like to lie as it always lead to me ratting on my older brother for the questionable things we did as kids weither stealing the neighbors barn cats kitten (we wanted to raise our own barn cat) or taking candy from a convenient store i never could keep a secret and it always lead to us getting in trouble or punished. 

That being said, after my brother saw the barn door I think he knew, i wouldnt have lied there had to be some truth in what I had been saying but he was still conflicted. It wasn't until that night things would change.

I was jolted awake to my older brother shoving my shoulder whispering to me to "wake up, wake up!" however his face had an distinct expression that I hadn't ever seen on him, it was panic. I was rushed out of my bed, down the hall to the front door of his room. He put his finger up to his lips and looked at me with a agency of fear in his eyes as he slowly cracked open the door. 

His room had a window. The window was located on the wall opposite of his door straight ahead on the back of the house over looking the backyard and horse pasture. He slowly grabbed my hand, he crouched down and silently we worked our way crouching through his room. It was alot darker then mine, no night light, no moonlight casting through the window. Scared we eventually made to the window and were right underneath it, he again put his finger to his lips as his other hand pointed upwards with his finger, slowly we both raised our head. 

In the middle of our backyard, facing our house stood a dark silhouette slowly pacing back and forth as if it was looking for something. For a moment It looked our way, caught our eyes, slightly cocked its head, slowly waved and jogged away outside the narrow view of the window frame. Terrifed we both stayed awake all night in his room, not saying a single word out of fear that someone was outside of the window listening.



Night Five: Wednesday 

In the morning, sitting alone in the empty dew covered backyard was our worst fear. We weren't seeing things, it wasn't mass hysteria, it wasnt just a story or two kids scared crazy by a horror movie, there on it side was a single dirty boot. 

Once light started breaking through my brothers bedroom and with the backing of my older brother we both rushed to wake our mom up. This time there was something tangible, my older brother did the talking and explained to our mom that late last night someone had crept up to his window and had been tapping on his window waking him up and proceeded to stand and pace in the backyard waving every time he looked out the window. That's when my brother grabbed me and that if she didn't believe us there in the backyard was a boot of whoever it was. 
   
  She took one look at my brother and I, got up and put her shoes on as she walked us down the hall preparing us with her speech about how  movies are fake, that theyre just actors and how we're taking this to far. We walked through the house and as she got to the glass sliding doors leading to the backyard she froze.

 She stared out with a blank expression on her face, looking out at the single worn-down boot. She openned the sliding door, telling us to stay inside, looking left and right she walked out into the yard grabbed the boot, she sat there for a moment just holding the boot. Then looked left and right away and jogged back into the house. 
We all stayed home that day, I remember being in the living room while my mom was on the home phone in the kitchen. Periodically look back at us, down at the boot on the counter and back at us with a worried expression dawning on her face.



Night Six: Thursday

That day we all packed a few bags for clothes and essentials as our mom told us that we were all going to be staying at our grandparents for the night. That my step-dad had been called and that he was going to be returning from the base tomorrow a day earlier then usual. To me and my older brother we were young and naive enough to think that ment us boys were in serious trouble, very rarely does our step-dad come home early and it's usually means we're going to get our annual ass whooping. 

Hastily our mom grabbed our bags running back and forth from the car to the house looking left to right each time. Wedrove 30/45mins out to our grandparents house in complete silence. When we got there we were told to go outside to play, while we were there our mom seemed sharper and much more stressed then usual, she talked with our grandparents while we were outside. Seeing them go back and forth as our my mom looks frantic. 

Our mom stayed awake most of that night and eventually feel asleep on the couch in their living room and that night for the first time in a week I had gotten good sleep. 



Night Seven: Friday

We arrived back to our house in Nampa to our step-dad waiting in his forest green Chevy Blazer, when we pulled up to the driveway he'd gotten out of his SUV as my brother and I prepared ourselves. Our mom got out and they immediately hugged, what they were saying was muffled by the car windows and my older brother giving me a pep-talk on how to deal with our future ass whopping.

Our mom waved for us to get out of the car so we followed suit. Our step-dad walked up to us and wrapped his arms around us, asking if we were okay. We both nodded in shock and he picked up our little brother and sister as we walked inside the house. Once inside we got a brief run down, we were to sleep per usual but our step dad was going to be awake all night so if we see or hear anything immediately let him know in the living room. 

Everything was normal throughout the day, our step-dad had called the police and they came to check the barn and surrounding area's they didn't find anything or anyone in the barn nor the horse pasture gate corral. They left, after I'm assuming my step dad and more left a police report.

This night though would make a scar that lasts 20+ years.
It was around dinner time, dinner was being cooked as the home phone rings, my mom picks it up, puts it to her ear and shrugs then hangs up. About 10 minutes passes, the phone rings, my mom picks it up. Asks "hello, um hello?" Then hangs up.

She is plating dinner and as she's doing so the phone rings again, this time my step-dad picks up. Same thing, he waits for a response to no avail, he hangs up slowly looks at my mom and hangs up as he seems more agitated.

We all sit down, finish dinner and watch some TV. About half an hour passes by and the phone rings again we let it ring out until it stops, my mom and step-dad looking at eachother. Immediately the phone starts ringing again this time my step-dad has had enough. 

He picked up the phone and yells at whoever is on the other end "listen you have the wrong number, quit calling this house!" he waits a second the his face relaxes, then sinks as he looks across the kitchen at the boot left on the counter, ill never forget the look on his face. The same look my mom and brother has a few nights prior. 

He hangs up, goes into my parents room and returns with a shotgun and sets it behind the front door. At this point it's getting dark outside, he calmly tells us that it's time to get ready for bed,  reminds us of the breif run down earlier and us kids do accordingly so. 

I get in bed on the bottom bunk, close my eyes and slowly fall asleep. *tap tap tap* I slowly openned my eyes. Those taps then became weighted into violent pounds, I sat up in bed paralyzed in fear as a man's face peered straight into the window, with his eyes peeled wide open staring directly at me on the bed.

Inches away from me, centimeters away from the glass pounding on my window, he opened his mouth to the point it looked as if his chin touched his chest. As if gasping for air. Looking directly at me, never breaking eye contact. He began to scream. A guttural, piercing, blood curtling scream. I cant move, scream or even cry. I am completely paralyzed in fear. 

Theres a lound slam as my step-dad kicked open my bedroom door. The man locked eyes with my step-dad, stops screaming points down to me, slowly cocks his head, grins and waves slowly.

The second my step-dad started bolting from my room the man pounded one more time on my window looking at me with those peircing eyes, as he turned around and started running. His silhouette now being casted through the moonlight with the willow tree's on my bedroom wall slowly fading away.

Those eyes some memories, you just wish never came back.
