I wake up on cold, smooth glass. My head throbs like I've been hit with something heavy, but there's no blood, no bruise. Just this endless reflection staring back at me from every angle.

Where am I? Last thing I remember is... what? Falling asleep in my apartment? No, that's not right. I was walking home from work, rain slicking the streets, and then—nothing. Blackout.

I push myself up. The floor is glass, clear as crystal, but beneath it, there's only void. Blackness stretching down forever, like I'm suspended over an abyss. Walls too—glass panels rising ten feet high, meeting at seamless edges. A maze. I'm in a goddamn glass maze.

I call out. Hello? Anyone? My voice echoes, but it's weird—distorted, like it's coming from behind me, or above. No answer.

I stand, steady myself. My reflection multiplies. Hundreds of me, in every wall, floor, ceiling—wait, the ceiling's glass too? I look up and see myself looking down, infinite copies stacking into eternity.

Okay, calm down, Alex. That's my name. Alex Rivera, 32, graphic designer. This has to be a dream. Or a prank. Or... I don't know. I start walking, hand trailing the wall. It's cool, unyielding. No doors, no seams. Just turns—left, right, dead ends that force me back.

After what feels like ten minutes, I find something. A smudge on the glass. No, not a smudge—a word, etched faintly: "REMEMBER."

Remember what? I trace it with my finger. The glass warms under my touch. Then, in the reflection opposite, my finger isn't tracing—it's scratching, drawing blood. But my real hand is fine.

I jerk back. Hallucination. Has to be.

I keep moving. The maze shifts. I swear it does. A corridor I just passed through—now it's shorter. Or longer? Distances play tricks. My watch says 3:17 AM, but the second hand ticks backward sometimes when I glance away.

Then I hear it. A whisper. Soft, like wind through cracks, but there are no cracks. "Alex..."

I freeze. Who said that? It comes again, from the glass itself, vibrating under my palm. "You've been here before."

Bullshit. I run now, turning corners blindly. Reflections run with me, but they're not syncing perfectly—some lag, others speed ahead, like echoes out of time.

I slam into a wall. No, not a wall—a mirror version of myself, but he's smiling when I'm not. He presses his hand to the glass from the other side. "Let me out," he mouths.

I stumble back. The maze laughs—low, rumbling, from everywhere.

Hours pass. Or minutes? Time melts here. My watch now reads 3:17 PM, but it's still dark void below. No light source, yet everything's visible, like the glass glows internally.

I find a chamber. Bigger, octagonal. In the center, a pedestal—glass, of course—with a single object: a key. Old-fashioned, brass, gleaming.

I pick it up. It fits my palm perfectly. But there's no lock. I turn it over. Engraved: "UNLOCK YOURSELF."

The whispers swell. "Yes... remember now."

Flashes hit me. Memories? Not mine. Or are they? Me as a child, breaking a mirror in my grandmother's house. Seven years bad luck, she said. But in the flash, the shards reform, crawl back together, and the reflection inside winks.

Another: High school, staring into a bathroom mirror, practicing a confession to a crush. But the reflection says the words first, mocking.

College: Waking from a nightmare, seeing my dorm room reflected wrong—furniture reversed, but me normal. Or was I the reverse?

The key burns in my hand. I drop it. It shatters on the floor—no, the floor shatters around it, cracks spiderwebbing out. But when I blink, it's whole again.

The entity appears then. Not suddenly—it's always been there, in the reflections. A shape, humanoid but stretched, like taffy pulled thin. Made of swirling glass shards, refracting light into rainbows that hurt my eyes. Its face—my face, but fractured, eyes in the wrong places, mouth a jagged crack.

It speaks without sound, words forming in the glass like frost: "I've waited for you."

Who are you? I shout. My voice cracks the nearest panel, hairline fracture.

"I am the Other Side. The one you ignore when you look away from mirrors. Every glance, you trap a piece of yourself here. Now, you're whole. With me."

I back away. The maze constricts. Walls inch closer, reflections pressing in. My duplicates reach out, fingers piercing the glass like it's membrane, grabbing at my clothes.

I run again. But every turn leads back to the chamber. The entity follows, gliding through the walls, phasing like a ghost in a funhouse.

"You built this," it says, voice now in my head. "Every lie you told yourself. Every regret buried. The maze is your mind, Alex. Glass because it's fragile. Transparent because nothing's hidden anymore."

More memories flood. Not memories—possibilities. Me killing my boss in a rage. Me abandoning my family. Me jumping from a bridge. All the dark paths not taken, but here, they're real, playing out in the reflections like silent films.

One shows me escaping—finding a door, stepping into light. But as I watch, the escaping me turns, smiles wrong, and the entity bursts from his chest.

The key. I grab it again. It pulses like a heart.

"Use it," the entity urges, closer now, breath cold on my neck though it's still in the glass. "Unlock the center. Become us."

I search the pedestal. A keyhole, hidden in a swirl of etchings. I insert it. Turn.

The world shatters. Glass rains down, but instead of cutting, it reforms around me. The maze expands, infinite now, layers upon layers.

I'm not alone. The entity is inside me—or I in it. We walk together, reflections syncing perfectly.

But wait. That's not right. I remember now. Truly remember.

This isn't the first time. I've escaped before. Or thought I did. Woke up in my bed, sweating, vowing never to look in a mirror again.

But I always do.

The whispers laugh. "See you soon."

I wake up on cold, smooth glass. My head throbs.

Where am I?

I wake up on cold, smooth glass. My head throbs like I've been hit with something heavy, but there's no blood, no bruise. Just this endless reflection staring back at me from every angle.

Last thing I remember is falling asleep in my apartment. No, walking home from work. Rain. Blackout.

I push myself up. The floor is glass, clear as crystal, void below. Walls rising, seamless. A maze.

I call out. Hello? Echoes distort.

This feels familiar. Like I've said these words before.

The word on the wall: "REMEMBER."

But now there's more. Below it: "YOU NEVER LEFT."

The entity watches from the reflections, patient, eternal.

I start walking. Hand on the wall. It warms.

The loop begins again.

Deeper this time. The maze folds in on itself, corridors looping vertically, gravity shifting. I walk on walls, ceilings, reflections pulling me in directions that shouldn't exist.

Time fractures. My watch spins wildly. Memories overlap—past lives? Alternate selves?

One: I'm a child again, but the mirror in grandma's house swallows me whole.

Another: In college, the dorm reflection steps out, takes my place. I've been the copy ever since.

The entity reveals more. "We are legion. Every human has a maze. Yours is glass because you see through everything—except yourself."

It offers escape. "Merge with me. See all timelines. Be infinite."

Tempting. The key appears again. But now I see—the keyhole is in my chest.

Insert. Turn.

Pain. Shattering.

I become the maze. Walls of my skin, reflections of my thoughts.

But in the center, a core. Pure dread. The entity isn't separate—it's me. The part that doubts, fears, destroys.

To escape, I must shatter myself.

I slam my fist into the glass. It cracks. Blood flows.

More fists—my reflections join, pounding from all sides.

The maze implodes.

Light. Real light.

I wake in my bed. Sweat-soaked sheets. Clock says 3:17 AM.

Relief floods me.

I get up, go to the bathroom. Splash water.

Look in the mirror.

My reflection smiles. But I don't.

The whispers start again. Faint, from the drain? No—from the glass.

"You never left."

The mirror cracks. Hairline.

I back away. Trip. Fall.

Hit my head.

I wake up on cold, smooth glass.

The loop tightens.

This time, the entity is closer from the start. "Why fight? Eternity here. All versions of you, together."

I see them now—other mes, trapped in adjacent chambers, pounding silently.

One breaks through. Grabs me. But it's not me—it's decayed, eyes hollow. "Help," it rasps.

The entity laughs. "That's you, tomorrow."

Time isn't linear here. Past, future, all walls in the maze.

I find a new etching: "BREAK THE CYCLE."

How?

The key. But instead of turning, I snap it.

Reality warps. Glass liquifies, flows like mercury.

The entity screams—multitudinous voices, all mine.

I drown in the flow. Dissolve.

Reform.

Outside?

No. Deeper level. The maze is nested. Infinite regressions.

Dread peaks. No escape. Only descent.

But in the core, a truth: The maze isn't punishment. It's me. Built from every avoidance, every lie.

To end it, accept.

I stand still. Let the entity approach.

It merges.

We/I see everything. All paths. All horrors.

But in unity, no fear. Just existence.

The glass clears. Becomes window.

Outside: My life. Waiting.

I step through.

Shatter.

Wake in bed. For real?

Mirror check. Reflection matches.

No whispers.

But deep down, a crack remains.

Waiting.

October—no, what day is it? Doesn't matter.

If anyone finds this—my voice recorder was in my pocket the whole time. Somehow.

Listen. And remember: Don't look too long in the mirror.

Or you'll see the maze.

Staring back.
