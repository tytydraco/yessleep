I’m approaching the outhouse.

If I lock myself in there, what’s next for me? She’ll get in; I know she will. 

I have to keep running.

I cling to my broken wrist which flaps more and more with every step I take as I run past the outhouse and into the dark treeline before me. My body bounces off trees that the dark conceals but I do not stop, I do not slow down. My panting breath and beating heart are all that I can hear as I run through the forever dark. I can feel her chasing me but cannot bring myself to look back.

I’ve been running for about 10 minutes now, never slowing down. My wrist is in absolute agony, and my legs and arms have been cut to pieces by low hanging branches and bushes. I have no sense of the direction from which I have come, or how far I’ve travelled, but I do not care. I just need to escape that woman. That demon. As I begin to tire, I see something glimmer to my left. I run toward it, my legs now extremely heavy. It’s water.

A small stream, no, a river, runs through the forest. It flows through the trees ahead, winding into the darkness. It is fast flowing but not dangerously so. I stop by its waters, for the first time since leaving the house, and fall to my knees. I plunge my hands into its cold depths, scooping water up and bringing it to my mouth to drink. As I do this, my broken wrist folds under the weight of the water, cracking as it does so and splashing water by my knees. I stifle a scream, not wanting to alert the creature. I lay down beside the water and put my mouth to it and start to drink. 

I lay there for a moment, catching my breath. I can no longer hear my heart beating, no longer hear the pant of my breath. I just listen to the water; it is somewhat calming, hearing it flow into the unknown. I roll over and lie on my back, my hair slightly submerged by the water which flows through it and trickles around my ears. The distraction of the water’s rhythm seems to take away the pain I feel throbbing from my wrist and up my arm. 

I lay there, shaking, quivering, but in peace.

The peace, however, lasts only a brief moment.

I hear a sound, a sound that breaks the white noise of the river's flow.

It is the sound of snapping branches, of dragging feet.

My head darts upward, looking around my surroundings at the dark trees that tower over me from all sides. Water trickles off my hair and down the back of my t-shirt as my head flicks from side to side, trying to locate the source of the noise. 

Another snap, closer now.

A rustle.

And now, a sound I recognise. A sound I dread.

*CRUNCH CRUNCH CRUNCH CRUNCH CRUNCH*

I stare at the treeline, just past my feet. As the trees part, the pale face of the woman emerges, almost floats, from the darkness beyond. Her eyes are still wide, still locked into mine; it feels as if she has been locked into my gaze the entire time I have been running, although I know that is impossible. She moves fast toward me, her long arms dragging along the ground behind her. She has not stopped. She will not stop. She runs closer.

Just as she reaches me, with what feels like my final ounce of energy, I tightly grasp my hammer and nail, and throw myself backward into the river. 

The water hits my body hard; it is stronger than I expected. I am propelled into cold, my limbs all being pulled in different directions. My torso hits something hard beneath the water. Next, my head clatters off what I can only assume is a rock. My heart drops - it is as if time stands still for a moment - as I feel the hammer and nail slip out from my grasp and lose them to the water. I fight the current and manage to rotate, I’m unsure how, so that my head is no longer submerged, and I regain a bit of control. 

As the river pulls me into the shadows that surround its course, I look back to the woman. She is running along the river, in my direction. Her eyes, now wider than ever, are firmly locked into mine. Her mouth is closed tight, the clenching of her jaw is prevalent, twitching with every  step she takes. She is not as fast as the river; I am getting further away from her each second. But she is continuing to run; continuing to chase me. 

I fear she is not going to stop.

I know she is not going to stop.

I can only hope this river takes me far. I can only hope it takes me to safety.

I am washed onto a bank beside the river. I am lucky it has pushed me out of its grasp, as the river ahead seems treacherous and far more dangerous than what my body can handle. 

I get to my feet, the wrinkled skin down my legs now a culmination of tears given to me from the river and from the trees; blood tries to escape through the gashes, but the effect of the water has caused the blood to strangely pool around the base of each cut. 

I have to keep moving. I can no longer see the woman, but I know she is coming. She is determined to get to me and will stop at nothing. I could see that in her eyes; she is insatiably hungry; insatiably bloodthirsty.

I immediately start to run. It is still dark and I fear it will remain so, I feel that morning is still hours away. I don’t know what I’m running toward, I just know what I’m running from. I follow the river, aware that if I do so I won’t get turned around. The river provides comfort in knowing that I am running in the right direction away from the woman, but also that if she does catch me, I can jump into it once more to escape.

I follow it for a matter of minutes before I see it.

A light pierces the darkness ahead, just beside the river. It is my beacon of hope, my heart flutters as I see it.

I speed up, glancing over my shoulder to be sure the woman wasn’t close behind, and to my relief I cannot see her.

I soon reach the light; it is dimmer than I had first thought, it had been accentuated by its surrounding darkness. I find myself standing before a small house, not dissimilar to Asri’s, however not stilted above the ground. The light illuminates from above the wooden front door. The house is nestled on the grass nicely within the trees, and there is a clear path from it to the river. A small shack sits beside it, with an outhouse beside that. I run up to the front door and try to open it, but it is locked. I bang on the door, calling out for help. 

As I do this, I hear movement inside.

As I do this, I hear movement outside.

Movement from behind me.

I turn, lean against the door, and look back toward the river.

*crunch crunch cruNCH CRUNCH CRUNCH CRUNCH CRUNCH*

She’s here.

I dart along the side of the house and leap into a nearby bush, concealing myself well. I pray that my scent has been washed off, or at least weakened, by the river.
I see her emerge, running along the exact path I had taken along the river. She turns and sees the house, her eyes are no longer locked with mine, I think she has temporarily lost me.

She stops moving, her tall figure accentuated by the backdrop of the river. She is still; extremely still. She stares at the house before slowly walking up toward it.
There is still the sound of movement from within the house, I fear that they will come outside just as the woman approaches it. The ghostly woman walks up to the front door and stands by it, her head high above the door frame. She stares at the door for a moment, almost in confusion, before turning and darting into the dark treeline on the opposite side of the house to myself.

From the treeline, I see only the white face of the woman, watching the house with wide eyes.

The front door to the house opens.

A woman, a small local woman, emerges holding a light. She looks tired, confused. She shines the light around for a moment, seeing if anything is nearby, but she cannot see me or the ghastly face that watches her from afar. I stare as she stands by her front door before my eyes dart over to the demon hunting me; she looks bored, almost disinterested as she watches the woman walk out of the house.

It is only as a child emerges from the house that the face of the creature changes.

A small boy, maybe the age of 5, comes from within the house and stands by the front door, hiding behind the woman I assume is his mother.

As he comes into sight, the face of the ghost changes.

Her eyes widen.

Her mouth opens, blood now dripping from it as if she were salivating.

Her eyes are fully focused on the young boy. She is hungry for him.

The young boy and his mother return inside their house, closing the door behind them.
I look back to the face of the creature, and she looks excited.

She wants the child.

The child.

The child may be the only way.

The child may be what I need to kill her, to get to her neck.

I may have to take the child.

I may have to [use him as bait.](https://www.reddit.com/r/squishycabbage/)
