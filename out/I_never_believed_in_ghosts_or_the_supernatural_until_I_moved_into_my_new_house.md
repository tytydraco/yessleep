It was a beautiful Victorian-style home that had been abandoned for years. It was cheap, and I thought I had hit the jackpot.

The first few weeks were great. I was slowly getting settled in, and I had even made some new friends in the neighborhood. But then things started to change. It started with small things, like hearing footsteps in the hallway when I knew I was alone, or feeling like I was being watched when I was in the shower.

I tried to brush it off as my imagination, but then things started to get more intense. I would wake up in the middle of the night to find my things had been moved around, and there were strange marks on the walls. I even found a piece of paper with a strange symbol on it under my pillow one morning.

I started to feel like I was losing my mind. I couldn't explain what was happening, and no one believed me when I tried to tell them. They all thought I was just being paranoid.

Then one night, I saw her. It was late, and I was in my bedroom when I saw a figure in the corner of my eye. I turned around, and there she was, standing in the middle of my room. She was wearing a white dress and had long black hair. Her eyes were dark, and she had a sinister smile on her face.

I couldn't move. I was frozen with fear. She started to move closer to me, and I could feel her breath on my face. Then she disappeared.

I didn't sleep that night. I stayed up all night with the lights on, afraid that she would come back. The next day, I decided to do some research on the house. I found out that a family had lived in the house many years ago. The husband had been abusive, and the wife had taken her own life in the house.

I knew then that I had to get out of there. I didn't feel safe in my own home anymore. But it was too late. The house had already claimed me.

Every night, I would hear strange noises and see things move around on their own. The ghostly figure would appear to me more and more often, and each time she did, she would get closer and closer.

I tried to leave the house, but every time I tried to pack my things, something would stop me. It was like the house was holding me captive, and I couldn't escape.

Then one night, I woke up to find myself in a different room. I didn't remember how I got there, but I knew something was wrong. I could hear strange whispers coming from the walls, and I could feel a presence in the room with me.

That's when I saw her again. She was standing in front of me, and this time, she wasn't alone. There were other ghostly figures with her, and they all had the same sinister smile on their faces.

I tried to run, but I couldn't move. They were holding me down, and I could feel their cold hands on my skin. They started to whisper in my ear, and I could feel their breath on my face.

I knew then that I was going to die. The ghosts were going to claim me as their own, and there was nothing I could do to stop it. I closed my eyes and waited for the inevitable.

But then something strange happened. I heard a voice in my head, telling me to fight back. It was like a spark had been ignited inside me, and I suddenly had the strength to push the ghosts away.

I ran out of the room and out of the house as fast as I could. I never looked back. I knew that the ghosts
