Photography has always been in my bag of tricks! I love to get out in the wide open and just snap photos, if its of wildlife, weather, some place unknown or getting into that "NO TRESPASSING" area just for a quick shot! Well, the latter is one I will NEVER do again, even if I almost lost my life

It was a pleasant day in October and I had just got home from work, the air was still fresh with the smells of the outdoors! After I had freshened up, I decided to grab my camera and head out into the wilderness for some photography bliss! The day was light out and I didn't want to waste any of it. I got to the spot I wanted to start hiking at and made my way in, not knowing of the adventure I was about to really have!

About 3mi in, I came to a HUGE building, one I have never seen in this area, even though I've trekked this trail many of times. Graffiti lined the exterior and interior, all the windows were smashed and an overwhelming sense of foreboding came over me!

"Well, this is new! I should take some shots since I've never came across this!" I mumbled to myself!

I walked the full grounds, finding anything of interest to take a photo of! This place was MASSIVE, a good 15,000sq ft, had about 5 dilapidated buildings that were interesting to say the least. Taking a good careful look into all the buildings, I found one that was easy to access, the "NO TRESSPASS" sign staring me right in the face!

"EH, what's there to fear in here!? Well, here goes nothing!" That would be the single most, frightening thing I've ever done!

Making my way through the crumbling hallways, snapping photos as I went! That feeling that you aren't alone really didn't hit me until I was well into the building, and it hit me hard! Every 5min I kept looking over my shoulder, hoping to see someone there! I didn't, but when I stopped walking, it would sound like someone was walking up behind me, walking ever so softly, just rustling the paraphernalia on the floor!

As I turned around, the noise stopped and I saw no one there. I shrugged it off and kept going, floor after floor, snapping pictures. It was getting dark out and I still had the basement to explore, somewhere you DON'T want to be at night in a dark and creepy building!!! I started to make my way down to the basement, the feeling of dread getting worse and more thick. As I got to the door, the air was cool, musky and damp.

The door opened with a loud and thunderous wail, probably waking up every forest creature in a 2mi radius! I walked in and looked around, taking photos every second I could. I noticed a few red stains on the floor and walls, but passed them up to being rust or just the color of the old paint that was peeling.

I started to make my way out of the basement when I saw one door that I hadn't opened! I walked over and put my hand on the handle, a jolt of electricity coursing through me! I had that instant dread feeling again, but this time it was much thicker! I had to think of what to do if I were to run into someone with a dark intent, but knowing my luck, it wouldn't be that simple!!

I opened the door to a candle lit room, the air filled with the smell of candles burning and incense! The air was thick, the air you could cut with a knife thick. Then I noticed him!! A LARGE, black mass in the corner, watching my every move! Then I noticed the stains all on the floor and the walls. They were covered in dripping red, and it made me shiver! I made a move to the door and it slowly closed, then slammed shut, sealing me in with the figure! I stayed near the door and waited to see what he would do!!

It wasn't long before he broke his gaze on me and started to move! He came closer, not super close but to a point to where I could make out what he looked like! 7ft tall, normal human head with rams horns and dark, motionless eyes! I stood frozen to the spot, then it spoke. 

"Sanguis purpureus super parietem et sica firgida et prompta est" the figure said, not breaking his gaze

I have to no idea how to speak latin, but he pulled a long knife looking weapon, a good 10 to 12in long, and pointed it toward me. The air was sucked out of my lungs and I couldnt breathe, looking at any opportunity to escape. He then made more strides toward me and I found the closest thing I could to me and threw it at him. It hit him right above the eye and he was dazed enough where I found the door and made a run for it. Running through that hallway was not easy, everything that could go wrong did.

Just then, the most bone rattling, earth shattering roar came from behind me as he was making his way through the hallway after me! I ran as fast as I could, hearing this beast not that far behind me. I found a small crawl space I was able to fit into to hide and wait. It was the middle of the night so I would have to wait until daylight to make my move to get out of here and away from the nightmare in front of me!

Morning came and I slowly peeked my head out of the crawl space, hoping to not see this thing waiting for me. I didn't see him, so I gathered myself and got out of that building as fast as I could, not looking back. I got to my car and drove the 30min home, thinking of what may have lead up to me getting into that predicament.

I looked through all the pictures I took of this place and only one stood out to me. It was in that same building, not in the room I saw this beast, but it was in the most obvious place. Right when I walked in, after ignoring the signs on the door! He was standing in the doorway, not 5ft from me! He was fully in the picture, but my own eyes didn't see him!

Ill never go back into any abandoned place like that again, even if its for the thrill of a photo
