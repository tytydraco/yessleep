I hate this fucking house.

I try to avoid the rooms with people in them, simply because I cannot bear to look at them. I wonder if that’ll be me in a few days, pulled into a wall or floor, skin like brittle paper, everything else soft and full of life drained from me. I say people and not bodies – I don’t think they’re dead, although that would certainly be kinder.

We’d first heard about the house on a small subreddit dedicated to urban exploration of supposedly haunted locations. Some posters warned that friends or peers had gone there and never came back. Those that claimed to have visited themselves said it was the most terrifying place they’d ever been.

It sounded perfect for our YouTube channel, especially after such a long hiatus, so Carson, Liv, Dee, and I piled our equipment in the van and made the long drive out.

It almost felt like it did when we first started the channel ten years back in college – the four of us in Dee’s old Ecoliner, we were even rotating through the same four CDs she’d in the van since 2013. Liv had moved up her company’s corporate ladder blazingly fast and been buried in work, I hadn’t left the house much since Shae got sick, and we hadn’t seen Carson at all since the accident. Dee was ecstatic – she had been trying to get us together for months, and I was glad it finally worked out.

The house was the only one standing in the entire cul-de-sac, cracked driveways that led to overgrown plots of land were the only indications that anything else had ever stood there at all. The entire town looked shuttered up, we hadn’t seen another person or car in hours.

We had no trouble getting in, luckily. I was a believer the moment I walked in the door – I could feel the weight of it, the presence of something, as soon as we stepped over the threshold. I saw the same recognition on the others’ faces, too.

The house was mostly empty, save for ruins of other electronics left by prior visitors. It struck me as odd – typically we all aim to leave no trace, plus that equipment is expensive. The only reason *we* had nice equipment at all is because Carson insisted on putting some of the insurance payout towards it, saying at least the money could do someone some good.

The look of the interior made me question if it was even structurally sound. Some walls were no longer standing, and in the dark, a single misstep could have meant falling through weak points in the floor.

As I first shined my flashlight around the place, I realized that it went on much further than the outside of the house would’ve indicated. Beyond the set of main rooms, a long and narrow hallway led back into the unknown.

At the time, I thought it was perfect.

Carson and I brought the equipment in, prepared the generator and hotspot, and hung shop lights through the main space and beginning of the hall while Liv and Dee talked sound and video.

Dee left to set up the cameras and she set up the first three, but must have never got to the fourth. She simply disappeared down the winding hallway and never came back.

At the time, I figured she got distracted, or was just exploring, since the house seemed far larger than the outside would’ve indicated, until hours had passed, and she still hadn’t returned.

We were getting video feeds from cameras 1, 2, and 3, but no matter how many rooms we went in, we couldn’t find her. Camera 4 seemed to be on, but all we got from the feed was what sounded like a continuous loop of static and despite the infrared, the video was just pitch black. We found camera 1 in a back bedroom, but we never could find the others. I'd hear Carson calling out for her through camera 2, but even when I could hear his thudding steps what sounded like mere feet away from it, no doors he opened ever took him closer to the camera.

It felt almost silly, calling her phone when we were all in the same house together, but it was the only thing we could think of since she wasn’t replying on the two-way.

I wandered down the hall as I called her, shop lights flickering above me. I drifted through rooms I hadn’t noticed before, in utter silence – save for the low electronic hum of the equipment and my own dial tone, before I heard it ring, far from the main space. She never picked up, but I could hear the familiar ringtone. I followed the sound until I was right on it, but it seemed to be coming from the ceiling, high above my head – I could hear it buzzing as if sitting on the floor above me. We’d never seen stairs. I've still never seen them.

When I told Liv and Carson about the phone ringing endlessly, just out of reach, they just stared at me. Eventually, Liv quietly pointed out Dee’s phone, still on the kitchen counter.

The sound of the ringing kept going long after I hung up and lingered on my mind like a sour taste in my mouth. Every time I heard it coming from the ceiling, below the floorboards, or within a wall – always just beyond my reach – all I could think of was Shae by herself in bed in our empty house, afraid, waiting for me to come home.

“Hey man, do you smell smoke?” Carson tapped me on the shoulder, startling me out of my thoughts.

Liv and I both sniffed the air and shook our heads.

“Huh, I could’ve sworn I smelled something burning.”

The longer we went without finding Dee, the more anxious the rest of us became.

After hours of searching, we laid on our sleeping bags on the floor wordlessly until sunrise. It didn’t feel right to do anything else. Liv clutched her two-way to her chest hoping to hear from Dee, but silence was the only response.

We must have eventually all drifted off and upon waking, the first thing we noticed was that the house looked newer. We pointed out to each other that the walls were solid rather than dotted with areas of exposed sheetrock, water stains on the ceilings were gone, and the floor seemed to have repaired itself overnight. Carson was the one to point out the sofa that hadn’t been there before. Dee’s two-way that we *knew* she had taken with her was sitting on the cushion, but there was still no sign of her.

None of us brought up the door, though. Maybe they too thought they were sleep deprived, and only imagining that it was gone.

The more time we spent in the damn house, the more it weighed on us.

As we talked, Liv would stop mid-thought as if listening for something, look over her shoulder at the empty house behind her. At several points she’d stare intensely at the ceiling – sunken eyes narrowed – as if silently daring it to act out in front of us, but nothing happened.

As the hours passed and we realized we had no way to refill the generator, we’d alternate between sitting in the dark with nothing but our headlamps on, and turning it back on to watch the camera feeds.

By 1 AM the next morning, Liv was murmuring desperate apologies to some unseen person while she clawed desperately at the wall where the door had once been.

It almost helped to drown out the phone ringing faintly in the distance.

It was my own ringtone, I had realized, as I watched Liv fruitlessly try and scratch through the sheetrock. Once her nails had worn away, I could see that she merely left streaky red trails on the stark white wall.

By 5 AM, Carson was pacing, taking rapid and shallow breaths, looking to open windows that no longer existed.

“You *really* don’t smell the smoke?”

We confirmed that neither of us did. He went back to frantically walking back and forth for a while, sweat dripping down his face despite the cool, damp air.

“No,” He stopped short and shook his head, “I *know* I smell someone burning.”

I was only half listening; we’d turned everything back on for a bit and I was mainly focused on watching the feed from camera 3. There was something in the room that hadn’t been there before – a hospital bed?

“She didn’t know.” Carson told me, staring into space, “It was all me. I figured we were going to lose the house anyway, so it was worth a shot.”

I nodded, despite having no idea what he was talking about – the ringing was so loud that I could barely hear him over it.

“Her car wasn’t there. I didn’t realize she was home. She *wasn’t supposed to be home!*”, his eyes pleaded with me.

As I looked at him more closely, I realized he’d been crying, leaving clean trails in the black soot I hadn’t noticed on his face before.

“You really don’t smell it?”

It was the last thing he said, a look of sad bewilderment on his face before he turned and walked down that hallway, alone.

I never told Liv when I found Carson. He was in a fully furnished, immaculate little room tucked far towards the back of the house. I simply closed the door and tried to jam it shut so she wouldn’t have to see him like that.

“Liv, did Dee tell you where she was planning to set up the last two cameras?” I asked, as we sat quietly in the dark that night.

“Upstairs” she whispered.

“There *is* no upstairs.” I found myself laughing uncontrollably, borderline hysterical, “They’re gone Liv. They’re all gone.”

She simply regarded me sadly and then went back into staring off into the distance. I watched the light of her headlamp play across the dark walls across from us; sometimes I still wonder what it was that she was looking for.

The next morning, we’d taken one of the serrated knives that had appeared in the kitchen once Carson was gone, and tried to saw through to the outside wall. We’d made progress after several hours, only to discover another wall behind it.

I think that might have been what truly broke her.

That last night, Liv looked so fragile, as if she’d break at the slightest touch, as she hunched over, watching camera 3 closely, only inches from the screen. The room was empty again, but she was captivated, her eyes moving as if watching something dart across it.

We’d just turned everything off for the night. I was so distracted by the empty hospital bed that had appeared in the living room – the machines, the oxygen tanks, just like at home, it was positioned so Shae could look out the window into the garden – that I hadn’t realized that Liv had got up until she was already walking away from me.

“I think I’m ready to go home now,” she smiled at me, sadly.

I looked over my shoulder almost expecting to see the door, but it was still just an empty wall.

She took off her headlamp and walked into the absolute darkness as she too disappeared down that hallway. I tried following her, but never found her.

Later, when I watched the footage, I saw her there, leaning against the wall, staring at something just above camera 2. There were shapes moving behind her, something bulging from the wall, pulling her towards it, but she made no effort to move from the embrace. She simply smiled serenely and she was gone, leaving only a ripple.

I’ve been alone now for a while, and for a time it was silent, save for the phone ringing in the distance.

Each time I am unable to find it, to answer, my mind drifts back to Shae. She called me so many times that night, and I never answered.

I promised her that I’d be there, I promised her that she wouldn’t die alone. But when the crucial moment came, I was with someone else, somewhere I never should’ve been. At our house, the bed, the machines, it’s all still there. I know it’s not going to bring her back, but I can’t bear to get rid of it.

It’s only a matter of time, now. I thought it might help to get these words down, partially as a warning to others, but mainly as catharsis for myself.

When I first heard the heavy footsteps above my head, I thought that maybe Dee was okay, she truly had found a way upstairs and was finally coming down – maybe I’d even imagined what had happened to Liv, to Carson. Maybe, maybe we could all still find a way out.

Until I started getting the feed from camera 4. That’s when I finally accepted that there is no hope of ever leaving this place.

Soon, the generator will run out of gas and leave me without camera feeds or light. After what I saw, well, the best I can hope for is that the walls claim me before what’s up there [does](https://www.reddit.com/user/JamFranz/comments/11or7ez/hello_and_welcome/).
