Her name was Annabelle. Her friends and I used to call her Belle. I sometimes called her Bellie. To me it sounded cuter, but she didn't like it because it sounded like "belly". We loved each other very much. We met in collage and had been together ever since. We had similar interests, compatible personalities and we were both amazing in bed. The only time I remember arguing with Belle was after her sister's wedding. I was drunk. That's when I gave up drinking. I'd rather never have another sip of alcohol than argue with my sweet Belle again. Or course, I couldn't admit that to her. Her love language was quality time and she'd probably just leave me if I got too sentimental. On the contrary, I often had to pretend to be rude to her while simultaneously showing her I cared for her. For some reason it turned her on. I used to call it "being nice in a rude kind of way".

Last year I proposed to her. We were supposed to get married this autumn. Despite being very busy with preparations for the wedding, we managed to squeeze in a short holiday to one of the European capitals this summer. I won't tell you which, out of fear that somebody reading this might go over there so look for the Evil Flowers.

It was a wonderful trip at first. We went sightseeing, we visited all the tourist attractions: museums, cathedrals, palaces and so on. But, Belle and I liked to experience a little more of the cities we visited. We liked to hike through every city, from north to south and from east to west (or the other way around, it didn't really matter). We used to call it "getting a feel for the city".

One evening I was scrolling on my phone in our hotel room. Belle had already fallen asleep. We had been hiking around the city all day long. I saw in my recommended feed a video about interesting, but lesser known places in the city we were visiting. It was a top-ten-list style video. I decided to watch it. Most of the places mentioned in the video we had already visited, but the last item on the list was the catacombs. I didn't know this city had catacombs. From what I've seen in the video, they weren't as impressive or famous as those in Paris or Rome, but I thought they were still worth visiting, as both Belle and I had a fascination with the macabre. Worth it they were not. Nothing is worth risking your life over.

Foolishly, I made sure the next day, that on our city hike we would pass by the entrance to the catacombs. I wanted to surprise Belle. The entrance was underneath a small, old church. The catacombs were dark and narrow and filled with human remains. The bones were behind bars, but some of them were pretty close to the bars. If you wanted, you could reach and touch them, which is exactly the kind if thing that Belle liked to do. Personally, I found touching the bones disrespectful to the deceased and also kind of gross, but it didn't bother me enough to try to stop her. It should have.

Belle was super excited to see the catacombs. She poked every bone she could reach, whenever nobody was around or looking. I guess the thought of getting caught thrilled her. For some reason, the whole experience made her horny. She grabbed my behind and whispered in my ear slowly and with passion in her voice: "I can't wait to get home." Needless to say, her words also put me in a mood for some "boning", pardon the pun.

"Ouch!" cried Belle. "What the heck was that?" She had pricked her finger. She took out her phone and turned on the torch. I took out mine as well and went to see, what happened, thinking it was a bone or maybe wood splinter. "Who knows what kind of germs are living down here. It might get infected," I thought out loud. No such luck. Out of the eye socket of one of the skulls poked out the weirdest flower, I had ever seen: a very dark purple, almost black, iridescent flower. The stem, thorns and leaves however were completely black. And I mean COMPLETELY. I don't know if you've seen those videos on the internet about Vantablack, a dye so black, it looks like a hole in reality. That's exactly how the stem and leaves looked. And not just in the darkness of the catacombs. I've had the misfortune to see the accursed things in broad daylight and they are just as mindbogglingly black. It was on one of these impossibly black thorns that Belle pricked her finger.

Short after our visit to the catacombs, Belle couldn't go any further, despite only having walked less than a quarter of the distance of the previous day. She felt ill, was short of breath. I touched her arm, then her forehead. She ran a fever. We took a taxi to our hotel. Belle went straight to bed, couldn't even get undressed, let alone shower. If only she took that shower or at least put on pyjamas. We might have noticed the signs of the infection earlier — or is it parasite? Let's call it what it is: a curse. 

In the morning, she couldn't get up. She was just too weak. That's when I noticed it: something black, like black veins, or rather black roots underneath her skin on her arm. Panicked, I took her shirt off. She wasn't able to. The roots were going from her hand to her breast. Ugly, thick and impossibly black, even beneath the skin. What was that thing? How was that possible? Is she going to die? It can't be normal. It can't be natural. I didn't dare think it then, but I'll say it now: it was supernatural.  I started hyperventilating. I didn't know what to do.

"Stop… being… a pussy!" said Belle with much difficulty. "Call… ambulance."

At the hospital she went into a comma. The roots spread all around her torso and eventually down her legs. The first flower bud came out of her private parts. There the flesh was more tender and the flower could more easily get through. Then out of her belly, arms and legs and eventually from between her ribs. There wasn't much blood loss, because the flowers produced some soft of coagulant, the doctors said. It didn't want to let her dye that easily. It wanted to produce as many flowers as possible first. We buried her last week.

Maybe, it's a good thing she was in a coma. Hopefully, she didn't feel much of the pain. Otherwise, it would have been excruciating. Hopefully, I won't feel much pain ether. I woke up this morning — more like afternoon — unable to get out of bed. I mustered enough strength to take off my pyjamas. I have a black root going from my belly button down my left leg.
