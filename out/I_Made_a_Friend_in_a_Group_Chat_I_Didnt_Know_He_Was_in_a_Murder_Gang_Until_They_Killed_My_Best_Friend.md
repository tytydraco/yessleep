This all started with a meme. That’s how I met “Milo.”

We were both in this chaotic group chat called **"Bleednet"**—just a random online space where edgy kids posted cursed images, late-night confessions, and weird internet rabbit holes. The admin was anonymous, the members unhinged. But it was fun…at first. It felt like a digital haunted house, if you know what I mean.

I started DMing Milo after we both laughed at this dumb image someone posted—a grainy photo of a gas station with the caption: *“Free meat inside.”* He seemed chill, into creepypasta, dark humor, and urban legends. We bonded fast.

Then he started inviting me into smaller group chats. Exclusive ones. He called them “real-time hunts.” At first, I thought it was a game—some ARG or scavenger hunt kind of thing. The photos they sent were staged horror stuff: an abandoned motel room, a bloody bathtub, weird symbols scratched into doors.

But then it changed.

One night, Milo sent a photo that looked way too real: a woman zip-tied to a chair in what looked like a basement. Her mouth was gagged. Her eyes were swollen shut. The caption just said:  
**“This one begged. They always do.”**

I messaged him right away, thinking it was a prop shoot or fake blood FX.

He replied:  
**“It's not fake. You’re in too deep to pretend now. You kept watching. You didn’t report. You laughed. You liked it.”**

I felt sick.

I left the chat immediately. Blocked Milo. Deleted the app.

Two days later, my best friend Jae went missing.

We’d been gaming together that night. I remember he logged off mid-match, saying someone was knocking at his door. I didn’t think much of it. It was close to midnight, and we lived in the same town. Sometimes people knocked late. Sometimes it was delivery drivers or drunk neighbors.

Jae never came back online.

The next morning, his sister called me, hysterical. They’d found his front door wide open. No sign of forced entry. No struggle. Just…gone.

That night, I got a DM from a new account:  
**“We told you we were local.”**  
Attached was a video. My stomach dropped before I even hit play. I recognized the room instantly—Jae’s basement.

In the flickering flashlight frame, I saw him. He was tied to a chair. Beaten. Mouth gagged. Just like that woman in the other picture. Then came a second message:  
**“Your turn’s coming soon, GhostxRider.”**  
That was my username.

I went to the police. I showed them everything—the chats, the video, the threats.

They said the video was gone. That the metadata showed it was corrupted and unreadable. That I had “no proof” anything had happened the way I claimed.

They told me not to call again unless I had “real evidence.”



I didn’t sleep that night. Not because I was scared—but because I kept replaying the video in my head. Jae's muffled screams. The gloved hand stroking his hair like he was some kind of pet. The faint metallic sound that came after... like a blade being dragged slowly across metal.

Then there was the laugh.

God, that laugh.

It didn’t sound human. More like someone trying to mimic a laugh but getting it just a little too wrong—off-beat and breathless, like a dying thing learning how to enjoy pain.

The next morning, my phone buzzed again.

No number.

Just one message:  
**“We gave the cops a gift. Go check.”**

Attached was a GPS coordinate.

I knew I shouldn't. I knew I should send it to someone—anyone—but by then, my brain wasn’t wired to trust logic anymore. I grabbed my jacket and a flashlight and drove. It took me to the outskirts of town, to an abandoned overpass near the old trainyard.

There were no cars. No buildings. Just rusted guardrails and graffiti that looked more like blood than paint.

And there—hanging by wire from a broken streetlight—was Jae.

What was left of him.

Skinned from the chest up like a butchered animal, face peeled back to the bone, eyeballs shoved into his open mouth like some grotesque joke. His fingers were missing, replaced with disposable plastic forks jammed into the nubs of his hands. On his stomach, carved into the raw meat of his torso, were three words:

**“U LAUGHED 2.”**

I threw up until I couldn’t stand.

When I looked up again, I saw something else—something tucked inside Jae’s exposed ribcage: a flash drive.

I grabbed it and ran.

Back at my place, I locked every door and booted up an old laptop I hadn’t used in years. The flash drive had only one file: a folder named **“LIVEFEED.”** Inside, there were dozens of video thumbnails. All dated for *today*. All scheduled to go live at midnight.

The names chilled me:  
**“Librarian, Age 36”**  
**“Twin Brothers, 19”**  
**“High School Janitor”**  
**“YOU.”**

That last one? It had no thumbnail. Just a black screen with a blinking white cursor.

Suddenly, my webcam light turned on.

I hadn’t touched anything.

And then... the screen split.

The top half showed *me*, staring at the screen. Below, in grainy night vision, was **my apartment**, from a high angle. Not from the webcam—but from inside my own vents.

Whoever was filming me… was already inside the walls.

I didn’t hear the crawlspace open until it was too late.

A figure dropped from the ceiling. I barely caught a glimpse—rubber mask, blood-slick hoodie, and a serrated hunting knife—but it was enough. I bolted for the front door, kicked it open, and ran into the street screaming.

No one came.

By the time the cops showed up, my apartment had been scrubbed. No blood. No camera. No flash drive.

Just one thing left behind: my phone, screen cracked, stuck on the group chat.

And a new message:  
**“You tried to snitch. Now it’s your turn to entertain.”**

Attached was a livestream link.

I clicked it.

I don’t know why I clicked it.

The video showed a man strapped to a chair.

Hood over his face.

Breathing hard.

Then the hood came off.

It was **me**.

Bleeding. Crying. Mouth duct-taped. Flailing in real time.

I’m still watching it.

Still alive somehow.

I don’t know **where** I am anymore. Or who “me” really is.

But someone else is typing in the group chat now.

A new username. One I’ve never seen.

It says:  
**“Lol. That guy thought he was real.”**
