If you’re reading this, it means I made it past the Palantir webcrawlers. This is not entirely a mistake. If I can say anything at all, it’s because I was allowed to. That’s also why I’m posting here: disguising something as fiction and dropping it where that nobody in their right mind would think otherwise goes a long way. Who am I to judge what constitutes a “right mind” at this point. I used to think I could live with all the secrets—that the money was good enough to keep me quiet.

I’m a contractor for the U.S. government. I’m aware of how vague that sounds, but it’s the most specific I can really get without setting off alarms. My company is a pretty standard shell that coordinates dispatch, retrieval, and payment for people like me who investigate places that no longer exist.

I’m the kind of guy who couldn’t hack it at a nine to five. I’d rather dodge rental cops, sneaking into a boarded-up Cinnabon at 2 a.m. to map holes in reality, than sit in a cubicle all day pretending I don’t want to suck-start a nine millimeter.

Abandoned places are dangerous in plenty of obvious ways: broken glass, black mold, the occasional meth kitchen, or the homeless dude who has every right to be there because no one else is. As a kid, running around a dying mall or crumbling factory felt like freedom—a haven for breaking shit, tagging walls, and pretending that being edgy would somehow make me matter. It all seems insane now that I fully comprehend how getting busted or a round of tetanus shots were the least of my worries.

The last thing I’ll do is try to convince you not to go to an abandonment after telling you the things I know. Forbidden fruit being the sweetest and all. All I offer is my story—do with it what you will.

My “career” began around six years ago, under the instruction of a man I’ll call Marcus. Marcus was an explorer through and through. The guy reeked of Marlboro Reds and spent every minute between gigs researching the next spot he’d hit. He’d spent a lot of time in Europe as an exchange student. From what he told me, they’ve got it worse over there—centuries more history producing everything from abandoned villages and towns to entire industrial complexes and bunkers.

I had explored spots all over the Midwest with him and other friends on and off for about six months. I had finished up a stint of incredibly soul-draining jobs and needed the time to reset—mostly pretending I was somehow closer to deciding what to do with my life. Exploring was one of the few things I did back then that made me feel tangibly alive.

One day, when Marcus and I were supposed to meet for coffee and planning, someone else was there with him. She stayed seated but offered me her hand as I walked up to the table where Marcus was lounging. Her grip was firm, and she gave Marcus—who was oblivious to my presence, lost in his screen—a curt look before greeting me.

“Joshua, right?” “Yeah, sorry if I seem surprised, Mark didn’t mention anyo—” “That’s perfectly alright,” she said. “Marcus has kept me updated on your progress. My associates and I believe you might be just the kind of person we’re looking for. Please, have a seat.”

I smiled awkwardly and nodded in feigned interest as I sat. My patience with this lady was already wearing thin after her interruption, but I couldn’t help being curious why some suit was trying to hire me based on my qualifications as a vagrant.

“Like… a job?”

Out of the corner of my eye, I caught Marcus pausing his frantic typing to take a sip and chuckle at my confusion.

“A position is on the table, provided you meet standards,” she said. “Marcus will fill you in on the specifics. I simply needed to make contact. That will be all for now. It was a pleasure meeting you.”

She stood. Before I had time to mutter a half-hearted “Uh, sure,” she’d already strode past me, placing a hand high on my shoulder. “Good luck.”

Marcus snorted into his Americano, tossing a lazy, “Later, Judy,” in her direction without taking his eyes off the screen.

I let the silence stretch long past its third trimester before finally breaking it. “Fill me in on what? Are we still checking out the cement plant today?”

Marcus fiddled with his tabs for a moment, then spun his laptop around. Several windows were open: an aerial map, structural layouts at least fifty years old, and finally an incomplete wire transfer—the routing number of which looked suspiciously like my own.

“I find my method of recruitment more fun,” he said. “But in full disclosure, that’s higher than your normal rate on account of onboarding costs and a bonus.”

It had a lot more zeros than a Pizza Hut paystub.

“Marcus… who are you?”

He smiled the smile of a man who’d just pulled off a massive joke—but in his eyes, something else shined. The intensity of it both drew me in and made me want to look away.

“One good question begets another,” he said. “So I’ll ask you: if you see a tree fall in the woods, and it makes no sound… what would you do about it?”

“What?”

“We’ll talk shop on-site. C’mon, we’re burning daylight.” He closed the laptop and slid it into his messenger bag.

I finished the last of my cheap drip coffee and watched as he stood and made a beeline for the door, tossing a few bucks on the table for the waitress. I considered my position carefully.

I had known Marcus just long enough to go along with whatever this was. I wasn’t ready to believe it was anything other than some kind of prank.

Forty minutes later, we made it through the last town before the factory. I caught glimpses of its single, large smokestack from the freeway, but the trees obscured any view from lower down on the dirt road. Nobody seemed to be around when we passed through the main street—then again the cement plant had been shut down a few decades before I was born. There was an off-kilter swing gate blocking the access road, with a sign that said CAUTION: SINKHOLES right next to a NO TRESPASSING sign that was so sun-bleached it was hardly legible.

Marcus pulled his Tacoma sharply around to face the direction we’d come from, leaving room for me to do the same behind him. He hopped out with a different bag slung over his shoulder—something I found odd since he usually made a point of traveling light in case we had to book it.

“Leave the tourist gear for this one,” he said. “I have everything you’ll need. Otherwise, keep doing what you’ve always done. Try to just… go with it. I’m sure things are moving quickly to you, but no amount of me yapping is going to help until you see.”

“Alright then, lead on, O’ knowing one,” I joked.

He didn’t laugh.

The man before me seemed much different than the one who sat grinning across the table less than an hour ago. Now he was sober, focused on me in a way I had not seen before.

I pulled my digital camera and snacks out of my bag, then left the bag altogether just stuffing a basic first-aid kit and a few flashlights into my cargo pocket. Marcus handed me a respirator, the kind with detachable filters. We hopped the gate.

The quiet was intoxicating after a few days away from a “bando”. The fall air was thick with humidity and it suited my lungs just fine. We crossed a shallow dike running parallel to a set of train tracks before deciding to skip a sketchy looking suspension bridge that went over a decent size river

I’ll admit, to this day I’ve had a nicotine problem ever since I started running with Mark. But addiction aside, stopping to take that scene in and acclimate calmed my nerves after a strange morning. The acrid plume I slowly drew into my lungs grounded me.

“What’s the skinny on this one, Marcus? Is there some kind of plan I should follow?”

We leaned against the wall of the silo stack. Marcus and I had skipped the rest of our usual sightseeing and went straight to the area marked on his map—a break in the wall leading down into a basement.

Marcus took a moment to reposition his cigarette to the corner of his mouth before speaking, gesturing over his shoulder at the gaping hole in the earth.

“Follow my lead and do everything I say without hesitation. That’s your plan for now. Any second thoughts?” “Lead on.”

We went.

Just before the hole in the wall, Marcus donned his respirator and put on a headlamp, holding another flashlight in his hand. He adjusted the headlamp to point nearly straight at the ground, then motioned for me to press my hands to my mask’s filters and inhale—the mask sucked tight to my face. Marcus nodded in satisfaction and flashed me a thumbs-up.

“Keep an eye on your footing, and don’t leave your flashlight on anything for more than a few moments. Let’s go.”

We clambered down into the basement of the silo, ducking a hunk of ventilation duct hanging loosely from the ceiling. Everything—the thick dust hanging in the air after each step, the vulgar graffiti—was par for the course.

Marcus cracked a glowstick and dropped it at his feet. He painted a beam of light across the walls briefly, then took a left. I followed, not sure if I was starting to see things in the shadows or if the tension from the café was finally getting to me.

It was when we passed the next corner and all outside light had faded that I realized I wasn’t seeing things in the shadows. I was seeing the shadows themselves.

Everywhere I swept my narrow beam the dark seemed to shrink away from it. A chill set in my spine, like watching CG Tom Hanks in The Polar Express for the first time. If this was a prank, Marcus would’ve had to violate the laws of physics.

“Good—you noticed. That’s why I told you to keep your light moving. Needed to know if you were paying attention. The slower you move, the more obvious it is.”

He swept his own beam in circles around mine. The mist responded by growing thicker at the edges of the light.

“Don’t do that too much it seriously does piss it off though” I ignored his apparent lack of concern for my worldview shattering in real time.

“This… is why we’re here?”

“Astute observation, young grasshopper. Nictophyllosis is one of the things that likes to crop up when nobody’s around. All you need to know is: keep the light on, and keep a spare handy. At all times.”

I longed for the overcast sky outside, my off-hand wrapped tightly around my backup light as I tried to convince myself that Momma didn’t raise a bitch.

We continued. Rounding another corner, we came into the main room I’d seen in the architectural diagrams: a run of conveyor belts under the silo stack. Marcus stopped to check various side rooms and a hopper that protruded from the ceiling. Finally, he set a small cube on the ground in the middle of the room. It clicked on, projecting a square of red laser light on the walls.

“We’ll need to be a ways back for this part. Any shadow you cast makes the yield less. We really only get one shot at this.”

He placed a ceramic container on top of the cube—a rectangle the same footprint, just taller. We backed out around the corner. Marcus clicked a remote, and the laser incrementally rose toward the ceiling.

He gestured for me to follow him back in. A crackle. A faint line of soot on the wall closest to the device.

“Damn, Mark—how powerful is that thing?” “Yeah, my bad. Don’t look directly at it. That’s a lot stronger than a laser pointer.”

Now the box projected a small square on the ceiling; the dust revealed a wall of light matching the container’s sides. Marcus shone his beam at the ceiling, then flicked it downward sharply. “Gotcha.”

I reflexively inhaled as the several inches of air above the open container turned opaque—like ink blooming in water.

“Pretty neat, right? This is our sample.” He fished a small lid from his coat pocket, approaching the light field gingerly, still compressing the black matter downward with his beam.

“It could get a bit hairy after I lid it. Follow my lead. Do not panic. Do you understand?” “Y-yeah.”

For what felt like a minute, I stood transfixed as he slowly lowered the lid before clamping it down with a hiss. A chill crept down my back—too real to be imagination. Marcus’ breath came out of his mask as a fog. My fingertips burned as if dunked in ice water.

“Turn toward the exit.”

Beside me, Marcus wrestled the container, slipping a metal clasp around it lengthwise—a motion that looked easier than it probably was. The container gyrated like something inside was spinning at impossible speed.

“Hand on the wall.”

I pressed my palm to the concrete. It felt warm compared to my fingers.

“Walk.”

The pounding of my heart drowned out the ringing in my ears. My vision narrowed to a tiny tunnel. I decided the mask wasn’t going to stop me from trying to hyperventilate.

“Stop.”

I froze mid-step and slowly lowered my foot. Marcus looked at me without a hint of impatience.

“Close your eyes. Breathe deeply. Then open them.”

I obeyed. When I opened them again, pale gray light filtered down in distant rays through thick dust.

“What are we waiting for?”

“There are two things wrong with this picture,” Marcus said. “One is in your hand, and the other is on the ground. You’d better figure them out before we freeze to death.”

I stupidly looked down at my left hand before realizing—the right was still curled around the chipped corner of the wall.

“We turned left to get down here, didn’t we?” I asked.

“Correct. And what did I leave at the entrance?” “The glowstick.”

No glowstick ahead. I turned right.

The hallway that should’ve been our exit was swallowed in darkness. My beam reached only a few feet before being eaten alive.

“Fuck.”

“Close your eyes again,” Marcus said. “And keep following the wall. You got this.”

My numb right hand scraped forward along the concrete. I rounded the corner—one step, then another. We moved cautiously until the air warmed and the sound of wind swelling from outside brought me back.

I opened my eyes. The hole back to the world was in front of us. Marcus nodded toward his glowstick on the ground. “Go ahead and climb up. I’ll just be a sec.” His tone was different—lighter. That eased my mind.

I scrambled up the broken wall, welcomed the muddled sky, and pressed my back to the silo. Slow breaths. My hands rubbed together for heat. I lit up to feel something warm. Marcus emerged a few minutes later—no worse for wear. Giddy, even.

“Gnarly, right?” I managed a half-laugh. “Are you going to tell me what the hell any of this was, or what it has to do with a job?” He laughed in my face.

“Nope! Go home and rest up. Call me when you pull yourself together and if you’re still interested I’ll give you the whole spiel. Sound fair?” “Not at all, but… doesn’t seem like I’m in a position to complain. Where are you off to in such a hurry?”

He grinned. His backpack gently wriggled. “Yeah, I’ll walk you to your car. C’mon.”

I didn’t need the time off to decide. Hell, I didn’t even need the walk back. I didn’t have a clue what I’d seen, and that was a rush was unlike anything I’d ever felt.

“Is there a dental plan?” “Not really. But that’s not usually something someone making almost six figures worries about, is it?” he said, patting my back.

“Oh yeah—Judy’ll want this back.” He plucked something from my neck. Right where Judy had grabbed me earlier.

“Needed to make contact, huh?” I asked. “I thought something about that interaction was strange. What’s her deal?”

“Standard-issue vital monitor and mic. Just doing her job. Don’t worry… she’s usually not that weird.”

I couldn’t tell if he was joking, and I was too tired to care. Every time Marcus had me thinking I knew anything about him, he found a way to remind me I knew absolutely nothing.

I sat in my car for a long time. I had about an hour’s drive back to my motel. It would be dark again soon
