About a week ago, we were planning a class trip together. Percy was the first to raise his hand.

“Please let us go to the beach, Mister Baker,” he said. “Please let us go.”

I was surprised. Normally Percy was a timid boy: quiet and listless. Now there was determination in his eyes. Real desire.

“Please, Mr. Baker. Please.”

His hands were balled into fists. Sweat ran down his face. What could I have done other than agree?

“Fine. The beach it is.”

Days passed. The water was glistening, bathing in sunshine. We had made it, all twenty-two of us.

“Okay, everybody,” I said. “Please make sure not to go too deep...”

A sudden splash interrupted me. Oohs and ahhs rippled through my crowd of middle schoolers. I turned around. Percy was in the water, gliding deeper and deeper. The waves splattered around him. Somehow, he held on.

Soon, the other students followed his example, keeping close to the shore, while Percy drifted farther into the open sea. For two hours we stayed. I watched his dance in silence. No matter how hard he spun around, how fast he moved through the water, an effortlessness accompanied him. It was like he was made for the ocean.

Even when it became time to leave, Percy was still out there. Merely a figure in the distance, he swung his arms around, high in the air. Between the surface of the water, his head bobbed uncontrollably.

“Is Percy drowning?” my students asked playfully.

After all they had witnessed, the thought seemed unfathomable. But inside of me, a panic set in. Greyish clouds approached us. Still, the boy hadn’t moved an inch. I fought my way through the ocean. My arms felt heavy. With time, I was getting closer.

Percy was a mess. Liquid ran down his lungs every time he tried to scream. He moved without grace, hitting the water rather than guiding it. The exhaustion had gotten to him. Gone was whatever control he once held over the elements.

“Percy,” I screamed, “take my hand.”

He couldn’t hear me. He passed out, sinking towards the ocean floor. I reached for him, again and again. Finally we found each other.

Relief, such relief. With one swift swoop I planned to yank Percy out of the water. Somehow, he felt heavier than before. His fingers lay interlocked in mine. His grip was stronger than it should have been.

“I got you,” Percy said.

Even though he was still underwater, his voice sounded perfectly clear. His skin had changed. It was white and scaly. His legs had changed. They had turned into a giant fin, covered in scars and blood.

“That’s what I wanted to do for a long time, Mister.”

He dragged me under the sea. He held his clawlike hands against my wrist. We moved at unbelievable speeds, right towards the deeper darkness. There was a tightness in my chest. Soon I would pass out.

“The waves are coming, Mister. Can you feel them? The ocean tells me stories of every one of your sins.”

His skin was like glass. His teeth sharp like an anglerfish. Only remnants of his humanity remained. I managed to keep my eyes open. Desperation moved my head towards his hand. One bite and blood ushered out of his fingers. Just for a second his grip had loosened.

The waves were about to come. They were my only chance. With all my might, I swam away. Finally, oxygen filled my lungs. Just for a second, we were next to each other. Then, a rumbling took over. A wall hit us. The biggest wave I had ever seen, swallowing us both alive.

Nature toyed with us, flung us around. Every new splash of water felt like a punch to the gut. The noise was deafening. I had no sense of orientation. I gasped for air, impact after impact. When it stopped, I was a rotting corpse, swept up to shore.

“Are you okay, Mister?” a voice above me spoke.

Percy held my chin around his hand. He had transformed back into his old self, pale and blonde and barely above five feet. 

“Mr. Baker,” he whispered. “Let’s go to the beach again tomorrow.”

He smiled at me. He didn’t care that his classmates watched.  

“Let’s search for your wife together, shall we?”
