In a small, forgotten town tucked between rolling hills and dense forests, there was a legend that every child learned but seldom spoke of—The Forsaken Woods. Local lore warned of strange occurrences and whispers that came from the trees, luring people with promises of hidden treasures and ethereal joys. Few ventured into the woods; those who did often returned changed, their eyes clouded with a fear that words could not express.

One  autumn evening, we group of friends—Jenna, Mark, Rachel (me) , and Tom—decided to challenge the stories. Armed with flashlights and , we set out , driven by a mix of curiosity and the thrill of the unknown.

As we entered the forest, an unnatural silence enveloped us. The air grew thick, and the scents of damp earth and decay clawed at our senses. Shadows danced at the corners of our vision. 

“I don’t like this,” I said, shivering slightly as I clutched my jacket. “Maybe we should turn back.”

But we continued walking, encouraged by the sounds of laughter. We wandered deeper into the woods, the path beneath our feet fading into an underbrush of tangled roots and bramble. Just when I was about to suggest another retreat, we stumbled upon a clearing illuminated by the silvery glow of the moon.

In the center lay an old, decrepit cabin, its door hanging from one hinge, and the windows obscured by grime and dirt. “What do you think?” Tom asked, his eyes gleaming with mischief. “Let’s check it out.”

Reluctantly we followed him inside. The air was stale, thick with a sense of dread. Dust motes danced in the beam of our flashlights, which flickered. We stepped into the living area, revealing a tattered couch, shattered furniture, and scattered remnants of a life long abandoned. Cobwebs clung to the corners like skeletal hands.

Suddenly, Mark noticed something glimmering beneath a broken floorboard. “Hey, look at this!” He pried the board loose, revealing a small, ornate box embedded in the earth. It seemed strangely out of place amidst the decay—a jewel-encrusted treasure with intricate engravings.

“What if it’s cursed?” I cautioned, but Mark dismissed my fears, eager to unearth his find. He opened the box, and a chilling  wind surged through the cabin,   flashlights turned off and everything went into darkness.

Panicking, we scrambled to reignite our lights. When we finally did, a shiver ran down our spines. Around us stood figures—shadowy, indistinct shapes with hollow eyes. We were trapped, surrounded by whispers that seeped into our  minds, chilling us to their core.

"Leave this place," a voice echoed, layered with pain and desperation. "You’ve disturbed our rest."

We turned to flee, but the trees seemed to get closer and closer, closing off our escape. The whispers grew louder, morphing into anguished cries—echoes of past wanderers lost to the woods, forever haunting the living who dared to trespass.

Desperate, Jenna recalled the stories—the townsfolk had warned that the woods demanded a sacrifice for the curiosity of the living. As the apparitions circled closer, she realized what she had to do. “We have to let it go!” she shouted. “Mark, the box!”

But he clutched it tightly, fear overtaking reason. “No! It’s mine!” The shadows engulfed him, pulling him into their midst. A scream erupted—a raw, primal sound—as Mark was dragged away, his fate sealed.

Now panicked we , stumbled through the woods, desperation driving us, the whispers taunted, urging us to join our friend in eternal darkness. I tripped over a root and fell, but Jenna pulled me to her feet. “We can’t stop! Keep moving!”

As we broke through the trees, we caught sight of light—the edge of the forest. We sprinted towards safety, our lungs screaming for breath, only to find the path narrowing once more, the woods a labyrinth of torment.

With one final push, we burst from the treeline and into the moonlit field, breathless and trembling. The whispers faded behind us but the loss of our friend hung heavy in the air—a haunting reminder of the price of our curiosity. 

Days turned into weeks, but the memory of that night haunted Jenna and me. Mark was never found. The townsfolk whispered of a new tale—the tale of a boy who journeyed too deep and was claimed by the Forsaken Woods, his spirit now among the whispers, forever warning the next curious souls about the price of trespassing.

The forest is waiting for the next group of friends  to tempt fate.
