As a kid, I used to live by this big pine forest back in Arizona. It was about a 5 minute walk from my house, straight down the road. There was something special about this forest. It looked just like every other dry pine forest in Arizona, but it gave me this strange feeling. Stepping inside it almost felt like entering into another dimension.

My mom experienced the bulk of these stories im about to share regarding the forest, but I'd like to preface by saying my mom has never experienced any kinds of hallucinations or delusions outside of the forest, nor has she been one to tell fantastical lies. Perhaps she misinterpreted what she was seeing, but i believe that her stories are true recollections.

1. The ball of light.

One evening when strolling through the forest my mom saw a wispy ball of white light moving down a hill in the distance. She said it almost looked like, "a woman in a wedding dress sprinting down the hill." It slowly got closer and closer until it disappeared right in front of her.


2. The woman in the striped shirt.

One evening my mom was walking with our dog Daisy through the forest when suddenly she sprinted ahead down the path. This was highly unusual for Daisy as she wasnt usually one to run off. My mom jogged after her until she finally approached a young woman in a striped shirt who was curiously being sniffed by Daisy. My mom apologized and picked up Daisies leash before continuing down the forest path. Only a few seconds after turning away from her, my mom decided to look back towards the woman only to see she was gone. She heard no footsteps, and from where they were standing the woman couldn't possibly have disappeared from view that quickly.

3. The shadow man.

My mom was only approaching the entrance of the forest when she noticed a figure in the distance pacing back and forth. At first she thought it might be a man looking for something he had dropped on the ground. However, as she got closer she began to have this deep feeling of dread. The man was moving in-humanely fast, and his legs were completely still. This was the first time something caused my mom to run from the forest in horror.

4. The yellow man.

This is one of my own experiences. Its a pretty hazy memory at this point as i was probably around 6 or so when it happened. Me and my older brother were playing near the entrance of the forest when we saw something in the trees. It looked like a mass of yellow plastic sheets, only they were covered in what appeared to be blood. Me and brother were freaked out by this and ran back home. Our dad came back with us to check out this mass of yellow and red, only to find that it was gone. No idea what it was, but me and my brother started calling it "the yellow man." It didnt really look like a man so idk why we called it that.

Anyway these are all the stories i remember at the moment. I feel as though there are more but they've been lost to time.
