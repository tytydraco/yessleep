This has happened to me twice now, once while I was 15, and again at 20. 

I will explain the first instance. I was home alone, chilling in my parents house on a quiet street. I was falling in and out of sleep when I heard something, loud, outside. It sounded like a gun shot and obviously that scared the absolute hell out of me.

I jumped up from the couch, and I heard a few more bangs. I immediately turned off the lights as I had left some of them on (my parents house has a lot of windows and glass doors, I didnt want anyone seeing me from outside). I also want to add, my parents live on a decent sized property with a pretty large backyard, that shit is scary at night.

I snuck around the house, peeking out windows to see if anything was out there. I remember that night being so dark, and after a while it went silent. I didnt like that after such a loud bunch of noises it suddenly went quiet. I didn't like that at all and if anything, it was worse then the loud bangs.

I felt like I was being watched, like everyone has felt that feeling, but it felt way worse in that moment. Like, no matter where I went in the house I felt that eerie feeling at one thousand percent.

I couldn't just hide, so I went to the kitchen, grabbed the biggest knife and searched the whole house, even then avoiding windows and sneaking around. After searching, I felt a sense of relief, because the house was secure  and whatever made the loud noises outside seemed to have left (boy was i wrong).

I turned some smaller lights on to do a final walk through. I felt brave, probably too brave, because i cracked the front door open, just enough to look outside. Just the driveway with some tiny lights out near the front garden. I finally took a deep breath and relaxed.

Just as I opened the front door a bit more, a face darted from the bottom left side of the door, I slammed that door so fast even though my body wanted to freeze. The thing is though, the face wasnt right, and also a human litterally could not be in that position and dart away like it did. 

The face was the worst part, it just wasn't right. Like, way too pale and the facial features didnt sit properly on the face, like something trying to be human but failing. I could not get that image out of my head for the longest time, I genuinely thought I was going crazy. 

Yes, it was dark, but there was light shining from the house and dim lights from the front yard. It was so close to the door, like maybe a couple centimetres away from the screen door and thank god for that screen door.

I really tried to convince myself it was just my brain seeing shapes in the dark, but how did my brain make those shapes so vivid and so messed up. I dont know, I still dont know.

The more recent instance, I was home alone in the house I share with my sister. I was drinking and entertaining myself, blaring music and having a blast one Saturday night.

Then, out of nowhere that same fear crept up my spine, that same uneasy feeling. Surely not here, but the feeling didnt leave and I would not leave the house unchecked. So, because it gave me comfort last time I went to the kitchen, picked the biggest knife and checked the entire house. 

I didnt quite see it that night, but I swear to you at least twice in my peripheral vision I saw it in windows, but i refused to look directly at it, it felt wrong. Maybe its all in my head, but i felt that same gaze and same fear i felt the first night and it is unmistakable. Its a distinct fear, and I sure as hell was not checking the front door, not again. I dont ever want to see that face ever again. I refused to directly look at any window in case it was there. 

But, I get the sense that I have been followed. Like, something wants to get in my house, its already making its way into my head. Am I going to be doing this every five years? I guess I will start preparing for next time, I feel like it's not done with me yet.
