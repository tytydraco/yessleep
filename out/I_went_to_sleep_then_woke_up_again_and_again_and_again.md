The first time I woke up, I was in my childhood home in Salt Lake City. Or... something that looked like it. Everything had the same shape, the same walls, the same pale yellow light coming in through the blinds. But it wasn't my home. It looked like home the way a wax museum figure looks like a person. Familiar, yes—but dead behind the eyes.

I felt wrong. Like I’d broken some rule just by waking up here.

So I closed my eyes again. Willing myself to sleep within the dream.

When I woke up again, I was in my other childhood house in Cedar Hills. Different walls, different paint, same hollow feeling. It looked perfect, but it felt counterfeit. I stepped outside, and the sky hit me like a hallucination—swirls of bright purples and oranges and greens smeared across the sky like Jupiter’s storms. The kind of sky that makes you think you’re seeing something you're not supposed to.

Then it hit me: I was dreaming. And I knew it. I had control.

I turned back inside to find someone—anyone—who could tell me what was going on. My dad and my brother were in the kitchen, quietly sitting at the table like mannequins posed in a family tableau. I asked a simple question:

“Where are we from?”

They looked up at me in unison. Like a script had been interrupted.

My dad answered, slowly. “San Francisco.”

That didn't feel right. I pressed. “No. Where did we grow up?”

My father tilted his head. His mouth twitched.

“Epcot,” he said.

The word was ice in my ears.

And then he moved.

He didn’t run. He didn’t lunge. He advanced—methodical, mechanical. With each step, his shape dimmed, losing all color, all detail. Eyes gone. Mouth gone. Just a silhouette of absence. Not a shadow—shadows belong to something. This thing was a void that wore the shape of my father.

And when it reached me, it struck. I couldn’t see what he used, but I felt it—something sharp, something deliberate—driving into me with surgical precision. Not rage. Not panic. Purpose. I collapsed under his weight on top of me, paralyzed by pain and confusion.

I woke up again.

I was thrashing in bed—clawed sheets, a toppled lamp. My shoulder slammed into a bookcase with a violent crack, and I gasped. This felt real, realer than the other places. But I couldn’t shake the feeling that I’d brought something back with me.

My partner was in another room, playing on a device I did not recognize, half-awake, I ran to him.

“I asked them,” I blurted out. “They said San Francisco. And Epcot.”

He stood completely still.

No confusion. No alarm. No empathy.

Just a blank expression. No emotion in his voice, no reaction in his eyes. Like he had heard me but didn’t understand the language I was speaking.

“You’re not making sense,” he said, monotone. Flat.

“I told you,” I whispered. “I told you I was going to ask them where I’m from.”

But he didn’t respond. Didn’t move. Just kept watching me with that empty face.

That’s when I realized: this wasn’t my partner, it only looked like him. I backed away, and then—finally—I woke up again.

The real world. Or at least, I tell myself that every morning now. But I can't shake the feeling that something stabbed through more than just my body in that dream. Like something marked me. And I know, someday, I’ll wake up again.

And this time, it’ll say I’m from somewhere new.
