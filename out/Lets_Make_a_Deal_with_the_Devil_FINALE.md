“Quiet on the set!”                 
 
My worried face splashes across the monitors. Geesh. Am I really that old? 
 
“Aaaaaand, we’re live!”
 
I suck in my gut. “Greetings! My name is Bruce Davie, and I’m the host of…”

(Cue the Audience)
 
“LET’S MAKE A DEAL WITH THE DEVIL.”
 
(Camera one)
 
“Gosh darnit folks, we’ve done it. We’ve reached the end of yet another season. Who woulda thunk it?”
 
Someone in the audience shouts, “You suck, Bruce!”  
 
I tip my non-existing hat. “Yes, I do have something in common with your mother.”
 
The audience boos. Profanities drop like bombs.
 
“Anywho, we’ve got a special show planned for tonight.” I pause for suspense. “After scouring the galaxy far and wide, searching for the perfect guest…”

The audience leans in.
 
“Please put your hands together for tonight’s guest, hailing from the land of moose and hockey sticks.”
 
(Cue Canadian anthem)
 
A dill pickle-of-a-man with unkempt hair and watery eyes approaches the podium. He’s wearing a lumberjack sweater and jeans so old, it’s impossible to tell their true color.
 
(Camera three)
 
Clearly, he’s drunk. His speech soars like hockey pucks. “Thanks Bruce. Good t’ be here. Watched all yer episodes. Yessir. Including da one where yer pants fell down. Saw yer little wiener too, I did!”
 
The audience is stunned.
 
(Camera two)
 
I shrug, not having understood one word the man said, except the wiener bit, but I digress. “Alrighty then. Let’s start with your name, and where you’re from? Can you do that?”
 
(Split screen)
 
The contestant nods politely. “Yes boi. M’ names Pete. Pete Tailor. From St. John’s Newfoundland, I am. Whattaya at?”
 
The audience is scratching their heads. I don’t blame them. The man’s accent is thicker than a ten-pound moose steak.
 
“Woah, simmer down, partner.”
 
The contestant chuckles. “Oh sure. Ye Yanks are a bit slow between the ears, eh?” He winks.
 
The audience boos. More F-bombs are dropped.
 
(Split screen)
 
My jaw falls to my feet. I’m dumbfounded. The last thing I want to do is screw up the season finale. Again. 

“Um, let’s bring out the Devil, shall we?”
  
(Cue creepy music)
 
The lights dim. A fiery pentagram floats across the stage, then – POOF – the Devil appears out of thin air. He’s dressed in a tuxedo-style devil suite with fancy red stitching, and shiny black boots. 
 
The audience jumps to their feet.
 
Damion salutes. “Good evening. How’s everyone doing tonight?”
 
The audience hoots and hollers.
 
“Excellent.” Damion turns to the contestant, regarding him with disdain. “A Newfie, huh?”
 
(Overhead camera)
 
The contestant looks him up and down. “Yer some nasty, wha? Where’d ya get that suit? Walmart?”
 
The audience chuckles.
 
Damion sneers.
 
I bite my bottom lip.
 
The contestant stands on his tip toes. “How’s da view up there?”
 
Damion growls. Flames flash from his furious eyes.

The audience gasps.
 
“Alrighty then,” I intervene. “Pete, please tell the Devil why you’re here.”
 
In truth, he’s here because no one in the USA signed up. Literally, Pete’s the bottom of the barrel.
 
(Camera four)
 
The contestant rolls up his sleeves, revealing a tattoo of a lobster swimming in a sea of freckles. “Oh, sure,” he says languidly. “I ran outta Newfie Juice.”
 
The audience is gobsmacked.
 
(Split screen)
 
I do a double-take. “Excuse me?”
 
Pete huffs. “Wha? Hard of hearing, are ya?”
 
The audience roars.
 
Damion shouts at the director, “For the love of Satan, can we get a translator?”
 
Pete makes a coo-coo gesture. “Not too bright, eh?” 
 
My anxiety is skyrocketing. Trouble is brewing, and I’m smack dab in the middle.  
 
Damion’s voice drops an octave. “Listen here, you little twerp. Show some respect, or I’ll cut off your head and stuff it down your throat! Capeesh?” 

The ground trembles as he speaks, the lights flicker, and a sense of doom wafts over the studio. I trip into camera one, breaking the lens in the process. The camera person swears, before disappearing backstage in a fit of rage.
 
“Whoopsies!” the contestant blurts.
 
(Camera two)
 
I straighten up. “Pete, you’d better repeat yourself. What is it you truly desire? But please, speak slowly.”
 
(Camera four)
 
The contestant makes a chugging gesture. “Screech. Powerful stuff. Puts hair on yer chest, yessir!”

The audience cheers.
 
(Split screen)
 
The devil snarls. “Liquor? Are you telling me you want…liquor?”
 
“Aye.”
 
“Whatever ales ya!” I exclaim.
 
“Shut up, Bruce!” Damion forks his tongue. “Yes, yes. You shall have your liquor. Your…Newfie Juice!” 

Boxes of Screech appear next to Pete, who’s wide-eyed and visibly excited. “Dat’s more like it!” He reaches for a box.
 
“HALT!”
 
Everything stops. Nobody breathes. You can hear a pin drop.
 
“First, you must sign the contract. I can’t just GIVE you the damned Screech, can I?” Damion produces a contract made of human skin.
 
Pete shakes his head. “Nah. In Newfoundland, a good ol’ handshake will do ya.”
 
Damion grimaces. “Fine. Have it your way.”
 
They shake hands for an uncomfortable length of time. Pete fails at overpowering Damion; instead, he’s sent flying across the room, crashing into a stack of boxes. Grinning coyly, Damion flexes his muscles, and does an evil dance, while the audience cheers him on: “SATAN…. SATAN…. SATAN…”
 
Meanwhile, Pete opens a bottle of Screech and takes a swallow. He returns to the podium, bottle in hand, and offers the devil a drink.
 
(Camera two)

I groan. “What does the audience think? Should the devil have a drink?”
 
(Overhead camera)

“DRINK…. DRINK…. DRINK…. DRINK…”
 
I nod approvingly. “The people have spoken!”
 
I’ve trained myself not to look scared. But in truth, I’m petrified. Things are about to get ugly. And fast. Only fools drink with the devil.
 
(Camera three)
 
“DRINK…. DRINK…. DRINK…”
 
The Devil blushes. “Well, twist my evil arm.”
 
He snaps his fingers. All of a sudden, we’re in a seedy nightclub which wreaks of urine. The room is dimly lit and lined with human skulls. Plumes of smoke sift languidly through the thick, stale air. We’re cramped inside a booth; an unopened bottle of Screech, plus three shot glasses, greet us.
 
The bartender arrives. He’s a vampire, with fangs protruding from his ashen face. He’s tall, thin and shockingly handsome. “Damion!” he hisses. “How wonderful to see you! It’s been…too long.”
 
Damion groans. “Hello Sergio.”
 
The bartender wipes the blood off the table, drops an ashtray, then scampers away.
 
Pete opens the bottle of rum, pours three tall shots. His eyes meet mine. “C’mon Bruce, have a grog!”
 
Nervously, I step out of the booth. The floor is sticky and gross. “Sorry,” I say sheepishly, “I’m on the job.”
 
Pete’s disappointment is obvious. “Suit yerself.” He hands Damion a shot. They cheers, before downing the liquor.
 
“Ugh!” Damion spits fire, narrowly missing Pete, who’s pouring more shots. They drink. The Devil grimaces. “Bloody hell!”
 
The bartender is watching from a distance. He seems terrified. This worries me. Have you ever seen a scared vampire? Trust me, you don’t want to. Sergio returns with a jar of insects. “Snacks,” he says, joylessly, before scurrying back behind the bar. 
 
All at once, the patrons – vampires as far as I can tell – vacate the premises. The bar empties, leaving only the three of us, plus the bartender, who’s as pale as a drink of water. 
 
Damion stands on the topsy table. “Sergio!” he slurs. “Drinks are on me!” He snaps his fingers. The audience appears, filling the vacant booths. Bottles of Screech are passed around freely. 
 
Pete, clearly enthralled, joins Damion on the table. “Now yer gettin’ it!” He pours Damion another shot. 
 
“CHEERS.” 
 
Everyone drinks. I look away, noticing the cameras hidden in the cracks of the walls. I sigh. How the cameras can follow us is a secret I’ll never know. 

Damion belches. Pete matches it, and a belching competition unfolds.

I’m trembling, having never seen such reckless behavior from Damion. And that’s saying a lot. If he keeps this up, all hell will break loose. I’m about to interject, when the door dings. All eyes turn. A She Devil enters, with long legs, swinging hips, and gargantuan breasts. She’s wearing a necklace made of human skulls, and nothing else. Her tail swaggers, as she strolls catlike toward the Devil’s booth. 
 
“Woo we!” Damion catcalls, as She-Devil puts her arms around him. Their tongues intertwine in a grotesque display of affection. His erection is impossible to ignore.
 
“Well, I’ve seen enough!” I blurt.
 
Meanwhile, the audience is getting belligerent, downing rum like sailors on leave. 
 
Pete hands me a shot. 
 
The audience turns on me: “DRINK…. DRINK…. DRINK…. DRINK…”
 
Grudgingly, I oblige. “Oh good God!” The rum tastes like turpentine. 

The Devil grunts and groans as She-Devil whispers naughtily into his ear, while stroking his tail. His erection knocks the table, spilling a bottle of booze.
 
Pete points a stubby thumb. “Whoopsie. Someone can’t handle their alcohol!”
 
The audience snickers.
 
Damion turns to Pete, eyes ablaze. “You think yer hot stuff, do ya?” He grabs Pete by the collar, then knocks him flat on his ass. “You’re a loser! Same goes for the rest of you!”
 
Pandemonium ensues. Bottles bounce across the barroom in a glass-shattering, rum-fueled frenzy. I try to escape, but Damion grabs the scruff of my neck. 
 
“Going somewhere, Bruce?”
 
“I…I” My flailing heart is threatening to explode.
 
Damion sneers. “Time to teach you a lesson, once and for all.”
 
Damion wraps his ropy fingers around my throat. I gasp for air, but my efforts are in vain. My poor excuse of a life flashes before my eyes. Everything goes grey. I’m about to die. My body goes limp. 

Something crashes. Something loud. My body jolts, as I spill onto the rum-soaked floor. Damion is shrieking. His head is bleeding. A broken bottle lay at his feet. Damion grabs the nearest audience member, snaps their neck. A fresh corpse falls next to me.  

Damion sneers. “Who’s next?” 
 
Someone shouts, “You suck, Damion! You’re a fake!”
 
“Is that so?” 
 
Damion goes on a killing spree, slaughtering the entire audience. Necks snap like turkey wishbones. Bodies drop like flies. Thick, crimson blood oozes everywhere. A large man wearing a dress tries to stop him; Damion knocks his head clean off. The head rolls next to me, eyes open. I gag. Finally, the screaming stops. All that remains are headless corpses, and buckets of blood. The smell is vomitous. Damion regards the gore with glee. 

Heart pounding, I step forward. “Now that’s what I call clearing the bar!” 
 
Damion snarls as he reaches for my throat, looking to finish me off. Beside us, Pete cracks open a fresh bottle.
 
“I reckon the Devil needs a drink. Yessir.”
 
Damion’s eyes light up. 
 
Pete pours two shots. Damion downs the shot, then suffers through another coughing fit. Pete pours three more, offering me one, to which I refuse.
 
Damion is enraged. “You cheap, no good, son-of-a…” As he speaks, flames flash across the barroom. The rum-soaked booth catches fire, and quickly spreads. Within seconds the entire bar is ablaze.
 
“Noooo!” Sergio steps out from behind the bar and rushes over, yielding a butcher’s knife. The blade is long and silver and sharp. “You’ve been a thorn in my side for far too long!” 
 
 “Hosh posh,” Damion croaks, shoving the bartender backwards.
 
She-Devil, whose eyes dance like shooting stars, starts speaking in an unknown language. Damion, clearly entranced, fails to notice Sergio sneaking up on him.
 
“Devil be gone!” Sergio proclaims. And with deadly precision, he slashes Damion’s throat, releasing a pool of vile, black blood. 

“NOOOOOOOooooooo….” Damion drops to his knees, his face twists with terror and surprise. She-Devil joins Sergio. Together, they stab Damion repeatedly, spilling his guts like spaghetti. The sound is sickening. Again and again they stab, gutting him like a pig. Flames flicker from Damion’s eyes, before growing dim. He collapses. The ground shakes as he falls. Sergio stands over the Devil, knife gleaming. With She Devil by his side, he places the sharp edge of the knife against the Devil’s bloodied throat. With hate-filled eyes, and with one strong swoop, he decapitates the Devil, whose head rolls onto the fire-riddled floor. The head catches fire, then explodes. The body turns to acid, then dissolves into black goop.
 
With much effort, I refrain from commenting. Words escape me. Meanwhile, the barroom continues to burn, cooking fresh corpses like dinner. The smell is abhorrent. Sergio and She-Devil share a mouth-watering kiss that lasts forever. 

A bomb detonates. Everything fades to black. My body disappears. This is it. My time has come. The Lord of Death has arrived. I hear a voice. It’s close. When I open my eyes, I’m standing next to Pete inside the cheap Hollywood studio. The lights are off. The power is cut. The crew is nowhere to be found. With a glimmer in his eyes, Pete offers me a bottle.
 
“Ah, what the hell?” I take a swallow.
 
Pete slaps my back. “Yer alright, Bruce.” He leaves me with the bottle, then saunters toward the exit, carrying an unopened box of booze. He waves goodbye, then steps outside. The door slams shut behind him.
 
I breathe deeply, trying to calm myself. What the hell happened? Is Damion dead? Am I unemployed? So many questions. So few answers. With shaky movements, I turn to the lifeless camera.

“Pete may be going to Hell in a bucket, but at least he’s enjoying the ride! And Damion, well, something tells me he’s suffering from one hell of a hangover!” 

I dry my water bucket eyes, and straighten my tie. Then, using my very best Bob Barker impression, I sign off one last time: 

“This is it, folks. We’ve reached the end. I hope you survived the final edition of…Let’s Make a Deal with the Devil.”
