Hi, I'm pretty sure I met a serial killer? So, there's a very old (cold) murder case round our area: a serial killer who killed tens of people. He was never found.

By accident I got talking to an old man during an event, probably around 60. As soon as I started talking with him he gave me the creeps. There was sth very strange in his eyes: it was as if he didn't focus on me but was somewhere else. Still, he heard me more than okay and WAS in fact looking at me. He had a few wounds on his knuckles, dirt on his trousers and shoes, very long finger nails - the whole apperance was off. And the way he talked too. He kept asking me about where I lived. I didn't tell him. So, he gave me his address and phone number.

I called him, out of dumb curiosity. A weird woman picked up, and every time I called she told me he wasn't here but digging some stuff up in the garden... ahem I mean planting flowers (?) until midnight. ?????

I wonder if he gave me the right number or if he gave me the number of a human trafficker? The woman told me she's his sister, but idk...it all seemed very weird. Like why isn't HE picking up the phone? Or is he really in the garden all night?

I called because all my friends told me I'm crazy, that he's just a nice old man who wanted some kind of contact...so I just wanted to reassure myself you know.

Weirdest thing: the unsolved murder case happened around the address he gave me. AND there's a facial composite on this unfound murderer who looks... exactly like him.

Maybe it's just my imagination at play here. I can't even remember what he looked like exactly. It might just be in hindsight he looks similiar. And he might have a weird sister and be weird. And reallt just be an old man who likes gardening?

After all, if there really WAS sth wrong he surely wouldn't give me his address and phone number (if they're the correct ones?!) AND why would the sister tell me he's digging stuff up in the garden if.. he really was doing something illegal? Plus police said the eye witness for the picture was unreliable. BUT the description (hair, eye colour, age) all fits, but is quite general.

I have to say I'm quite a bit over the top at times and too immersed in crime fiction and stuff so it might be my imagination that's putting all that stuff together. I don't even know WHY I spoke to the stranger - it must've been stupid curiosity, because I immediately felt something was off.

Oh I remember: It's a landline I called basically. BUT the woman put the phone down for like 5 minutes, telling me she'll look for the man. She couldn't have possibly tracked my phone right? That's only stuff police can do? And when I was asking her about something he had told me she asked me if I really did need to talk to him at all cause he's been quite busy lately and told me to call back another time (we were taking about post cards and stuff, that's why I called, about a rare edition he had showed me during the event).

I now wonder if I'd been stupid.. I didn't give him my name, my address or anything else. All he or whoever has is my mobile phone number, that's it. They can't do anything with that right?

Talked to him again and yet again he asked me about my real address to send me rare postcards (I expressed interest, he offered to send them; he didn't seem pleased that I have a 'friend's' address and not mine and kept slightly pushing me for MY address just to be sure they arrive alright. Isn't that weird? Granted my friend lives a bit farther away so it might be a financial issue?
