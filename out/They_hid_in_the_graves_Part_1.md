I don’t know what you will think about me at the end, but I need to get this off my chest. My therapist would never believe me. If he did, he would be the one needing therapy. You people here might be the only ones crazy enough to not laugh me out of the room. So, here goes nothing.

Before I start, I should explain a few things, so the reason we were there to begin with makes more sense. I’m from Germany. Once you’ve reached the last grades, you have to make a sort of special assignment. To put it in a nutshell, you have to work together with a few other students over the span of roughly a year on a project of your choosing. Think of it as a dumbed-down version of a Bachelor-thesis. Something a bunch of dipshits in their late teens can manage.

I and three friends decided to work together, but we had no idea what subject to choose from. You see, every project needs a practical part. Something that isn’t just you writing about your topic. You must go out there and do something. Sounds vague, right? Exactly!

knewWe were going insane until my best friend, Jonathan, had an idea. His neighbor’s job was to keep an eye on the forests in the region, checking whether everything was fine and dandy. He also hunted as a hobby. He was the kinda guy who knew far too much about something and would bore you with every detail. But he was also a very nice guy.

When Jonathan was talking to him one day, his neighbor suggested picking a nearby forest and its wildlife as a topic. He had a lot of data on the forests, which would make the writing part of our assignment straightforward. We all liked the idea, but the icing on top was the practical part. We could set up a few marking spots that would attract some animals. Perhaps you have seen some of them before. Imagine scratching pads attached to a tree that animals would love to rub against, leaving behind fur and other stuff.

It was a done deal from the get-go, as it didn’t require any greater work from us. The neighbor just gave us everything. This leads us to the day that destroyed my life. Not gonna lie, I am a bit nervous writing about it, but I think it is for the better to get it out of my system.

In retrospective, it kills me how easily we could have avoided it all if we hadn’t been so fucking lazy. Because the project was so easy to pull off, we didn’t do shit for months. There was no reason to stress ourselves, so we rather went to parties or played video games. But once it was clear that we couldn’t ignore it anymore, we went out into the forest to set our animal traps. In the middle of December.

Sounds stupid, right? It gets even dumber because we decided to set them up during the foggiest day you could imagine. You might wonder why we would do something like this? When I said we did until the last moment, I meant it. You have to understand. We really didn’t want to do it. So, the absolute last time when we had to start was a Saturday afternoon. But, to our defense, I can’t remember the last cold winter with a lot of snow. In our region at last.

So, when Jonathan drove us to the forest, there wasn’t much white outside. I already mentioned Jonathan. I have known him since we were children. He was a good guy. The kinda guy who didn’t say anything when he was the only person in his friend group to get a driver's license and had to serve as the personal taxi. Even at parties, he never complained that he couldn’t drink \`cause he had to drive. Though, he never liked to drink. He hated not being in control over himself.

Besides Jonathan and me, two other friends accompanied us, Peter and Marie. I don’t like writing too much about my dead friends, as it fucks with my head, but I think you guys should know at least a little bit about them. Peter was the opposite of Jonathan. Very extraverted, loud, chaotic, and a bit eccentric. Not in the weirdo way. He was a bit unhinged but in an endearing way.

Marie was a bit of a tomboy. She didn’t really fit in with the other girls and liked to hang around us guys. While she sometimes gave not-like-other-girls vibes, she had no ego. She was quite goth and had a hang for older places that are long abandoned. I had thought she was just too into horror stories, but she explained it to me as having “Ruinenlust”. You can google if you want.

Sorry for yapping, but I think that’s all the context you need to know. As I have already mentioned, my friends and I were driving into a forest to place our traps if you can call them that. The drive there wasn’t anything out of the ordinary. The usual bicker and jokes you yourselves have heard and said hundreds of times.

Jonathan kept his mouth shut and his eyes on the road. While the street wasn’t frozen over, and he had taken this road countless times, he didn’t risk anything. Peter liked to fuck with him for that, daring him to accelerate a little bit. Thankfully, Jonathan wasn’t someone you could easily steer in any direction. If Peter proved himself persistent enough, though, he earned himself one or two middle fingers from Jonathan.

Marie and I went over where to best put out traps as Jonathan took a dirt road into the forest. We couldn’t drive too deep into the forest, as the road narrowed down, making it impossible for a car to pass through. Usually, parking your car in the middle of the forest path was forbidden, but we didn’t expect anyone at a time like this to show up. But it took a bit of convincing for Jonathan how wasn’t thrilled by the idea.

“But what if someone wants to pass?” he asked. “They would…”

“Jonathan, please,” Peter said, getting the traps out of the trunk. “You’re not the fucking pope, okay. Nothing is gonna happen. Just calm down.”

Jonathan frowned, but he stopped arguing. I helped Peter carrying the traps and equipment to attach them to trees while Jonathan and Marie smoked, watching us struggle. As Marie would be responsible for positing the traps in the right spot and Jonathan had driven us here, Peter and I were assigned to carry the damn things around. Despite both of us having agreed to it beforehand, Peter and I bitched and moaned the entire time, Jonathan grinning with a cigarette in his hand.

You know, it never made sense to me why Jonathan started smoking. For Marie, it fit perfectly. She already drank black coffee and loved the bleakness of life and all that. Smoking gave her the finale edge. Would have been weird if she didn’t. But Jonathan was always concerned about his health to a certain degree. Like I said, he never drank alcohol, but he also never did anything foolish that would put him at risk. Perhaps he smoked to look cooler. Or perhaps it was because both his parents smoked. I don’t know. I never asked, and now I will never know.

I’m gonna skip a bit forward. You probably aren’t interested in how we determined where to put the traps and how we had to do it. No, that’s not why you’re here. Though, one detail I want to mention is how silent it was. I have never been much of a forest guy, but I thought there should be some sounds, right? Of course, during winter there shouldn’t be much going on, but you would expect to see and hear some noise coming from an animal. But there was nothing.

After setting up a few scratch pads, Marie clapped against my shoulder. “Look at this,” she said, pointing at the ground. She wiped away dirt and snow with her foot to reveal parts of a stone path in front of us. We both kneeled to have a better look. Most of it was still covered in a thin layer of snow, but we could make out most of it.

The stones that were used were old, battered by time, the gaps between them filled with whatever plant life could endure the winter. I’m not an expert, but even I could clearly see that whoever had worked on the stones had done so with crude tools. This wasn’t the result of someone from the last decades or centuries. That pathway was ancient.

Marie’s face lit up, a crooked smile spreading over her features. She didn’t say anything. She didn’t have to. All she needed to do was to look at me.

I sighed. “Do we have to? I wanna go home.”

“Come one,” she said. “This leads somewhere. Let’s just take a look. A quick one.”

I had mentioned it before, Marie had a big knack for ruins. She got a thrill of sorts seeing them. In particular, the ones that look really shady. Like they haven’t been cared for in years. They had to look like they were about to fall apart any minute to hit the right spot for Marie. Don’t ask why. She once tried to describe it to me.

“You are engulfed in a deep, profound melancholy,” she had said. Thereafter, I never asked again.

“What is it,” Peter asked, walking over to us.

Marie just pointed at the stone path. Peter grinned, nodding. “Ah, I see,” he said. “We can have a glimpse.”

“Fine, fuck it,” I said, shaking my head.

“Oi, Jonathan,” Peter called to him. “Come, we gotta something to look at.”

Jonathan frowned, and it deepened as he saw the stone path. “Okay, sure, but not more than five minutes. I’m freezing my balls off.”

Peter rolled his eyes, about to call him a pussy. But before he could do that, Marie hurried onwards, following the path. I kept my hands in my pockets, kicking away some snow as we went after Marie. She didn’t run off like a dog, but she had a quick pace. Peter caught up with Marie in no time. As soon as someone showed any excitement in his vicinity, it spread over to him, making him shake like a little kid. If whatever caused the original excitement turns out to be boring to him, Peter would be drained of his newfound energy, becoming lethargic. This had never happened with Marie, though, as he was also into spooky shit.

Jonathan sighed, massaging his temples. I clapped him on the shoulder, shaking him a little. “Hey, perhaps we will find something cool. Come on, man.”

“Sure, whatever,” he said. “But they don’t drag any garbage into my car like last time. You will…”

“Yeah, I will search them.”

“Especially…”

“Especially Peter, I know. Now, come on. Let’s hurry before we lose them.”

Jonathan made a grimace, having a response on his lips but lacking the energy to utter it. “Fine,” he said. Jonathan had always looked a bit tired. Besides Marie, he was the only one my age that drank coffee voluntarily. I swear, he was one of those people that made a big deal if they hadn’t a coffee in the morning. He had made too many horrible jokes about dying without his daily hit of caffeine. 

Marie mentioned some collapsed windmill she had once visited with her brother, as Jonathan and I caught up with her and Peter. Before Peter could make an intelligent remark about the potential state of the ruin after several fireworks would hit it, I could see the destination the stone path led to through the trees. The fog kept much of it hidden, but it what as building, covered in snow. Even though I didn’t get a good look at it, it was obvious what it was. A church.

“Ehr, Marie,” I said, pointing at it.

Marie had cut off Peter before he had to chance to make a joke about the windmill. As she turned around, her eyes lit up, sparkling, standing in sharp contrast to her black make-up. “Oh, fuck yes.”

Seeing a church in the middle of the forest, seemingly abandoned, now she ran off like a dog. “What did I expect,” I muttered under my breath, hurrying after her. Peter sprinted past me, echoing Marie’s cursing with his own. Jonathan kept a sluggish jog behind me. Where Peter searched for any excuse to move, Jonathan hated any sudden movement.

It wasn’t quite dark yet, but the fog made it difficult to get a clear picture of the church until we stood in front of it. It was a tiny thing that a dozen people could fit in. Its tower was the most impressive part, and only due to the lackluster building it was attached to.

Parts of the church’s roof had collapsed, the windows all smashed in. Snow covered the entire thing, giving it at least a certain amount of atmosphere that didn’t scream of an ancient shithole. “Oh my god, this is so metal,” Marie said.

As she was about to reach it, she stopped all of a sudden. Peter nearly collided into her. “Marie, what the…,” he said, falling silent, too.

“Ehr… what the fuck,” Marie said.

Thanks to the fog, Jonathan and I could only see them once we reached Marie and Peter. In front of the church, six statues stood, leading towards the entrance. They stood in pairs, looking at each other, the gap between them the path you were supposed to take to get into the church. You might think they were supposed to watch the entrance, which would have been weird on its own for a church, but their appearance didn’t scream guards to me.

At first glance, they appeared to have been made from stone, but once you wiped away the snow, we saw they were ice. They looked human but with a dreadful expression. Like they were about to be torn apart. The details on their faces were insane. So insane, even Marie and Peter kept their distance from them. Touching them to make their faces visible was as far as anyone of us wanted to go with these statues.

Marie laughed, failing to keep her nervousness out of her voice. “Wow… that’s heavy. That’s fucking freaky.”

“Uh-huh,” Jonathan said. “You could say that.”

“Oh fuck,” Peter said, “look at this shit.”

Peter pointed at the adjacent fields around the church. Again, thanks to the fog, you didn’t see much. Furthermore, the fields Peter meant were a bit behind the church, making it even more difficult to notice them when you are walking towards the church. But as we took a step towards them, gravestones became visible, appearing from the fog. The statues on their own were bad enough, but stepping into a graveyard in the middle of the forest really did a thing to me.

“That’s a bit…,” I said. “That’s a bit much, right.”

Marie tried to regain her excitement again, kneeling in front of one of the graves, clearing the gravestone to read the name. She squinted, but the writing had been weathered away, leaving nothing but fractions behind that couldn’t be deciphered. Peter kicked a different gravestone, hands in his pocket, rattling away the snow. He gave it a few tries but couldn’t read a single letter of what used to be carved into the stone. They appeared worse than they should have.

I have no idea how a gravestone should look after a couple of hundreds of years fighting against the elements. But big sections were missing, seeming as if someone had broken them off. Perhaps they had crumbled off on their own. Or perhaps someone had accelerated the process.

“Okay,” Jonathan said, “that was something. How about we go home now?”

“Yeah,” I said. “I’m getting bad vibes. Let’s head out.”

“You guys are pussies,” Peter said. He kept his face away from us, stomping against the gravestone. Despite his best effort, even he couldn’t hide the fact he had paled. “Let’s… let’s go inside the church.”

Jonathan groaned. “Peter, please.”

“Grow a pair of balls, Jonathan,” Peter replied. “Marie, you’re in, right?”

Marie stood up; a frown carved into her features. She massaged her lower jaw, seeming puzzled by the whole ordeal. “Ehr, sure. I wanna take a closer look.”

 Peter looked at me. He said nothing. He only raised an eyebrow. I hated when he called me a pussy. “Fuck. Only a few seconds. I want to get out of this forest as fast as possible.”

Jonathan sighed, deciding against his best judgement to come with the rest of the group. The gate to the church was half opened; the gap not big enough for any of us to get through. It took the four of us to push it wide enough, the hinges croaking as they were moved for the first time in God knows how long.

 To no one’s surprise, the inside of the church was nothing to write home about. Most of it was drenched in darkness, the only light coming through the broken windows and the collapsed roof. The parts that were illuminated revealed several beer bottles shattered on the ground, with an old fireplace in the middle of the church.

Seeing this, a few things made more sense to me. Some kids our age had found the place before us and decided to get hammered here. They made a bonfire and, while drunk, started to fuck up the place. They smashed in the windows and took a baseball bat or something like that to the graves.

Marie seemed to have gotten to the same conclusion, grimacing. “Fucking assholes. Way to go to ruin the place.”

Peter smiled. “Pun intended?”

Marie stared at him; her eyes squinted. “Wha… fuck you.”

Peter shrugged, stepping into in front of the abandoned bonfire, nudging some beer bottles with his feet. He tried so hard to play it cool, but it was clear as day he hated stepping deeper into the church. I never understood why he always wanted to impress us. Perhaps he didn’t. Perhaps the only one he wanted to impress was Marie.

“That place is…,” Peter mumbled to himself, looking around. As his eyes landed on the back of the church, the spot veiled in darkness the most, he jumped back, screeching. “Jesus fucking Christ!” he screamed, nearly failing straight into the broken beer bottles and bonfire.

“Wow, Peter,” I said, catching him as he bumped into me.

Jonathan took his phone out, turned its light on, and pointed at the back of the church. I wish he hadn’t. Leaning against the crumbling wall was a massive crucifix with a woman nailed to it. There was no snow on her, thanks to the still intact parts of the roof protecting her from it. She looked just like the statues outside.

At first glance, she appeared to have been made from stone, but due to her surface reflecting the light back, it was obvious she was crafted from ice. Unlike her counterparts outside, we could see her entire figure. There were semblances of clothing carved into the statue but nothing more, lurking out of the thick layer of ice. Whoever had made her seemed satisfied by capturing nothing but her general form, though they have failed somewhat at that. Besides her face, everything seemed too big. The proportion of the body was off compared to the head of the statue.

Before I knew it, I had taken a few steps towards the statue. There was something weird about the crucifix. It wasn’t part of the statue. That was a real wooden crucifix made to crucify people. It was in a horrible condition, the wood ripped and rotten. Only by some miracle did it bear the weight of the figure it carried. Furthermore, the crucifix was too big for the statue. I mean, it looked like it was made for someone a few feet taller, and the statue was our height already. That thing could have buried you with ease.

“The face,” Marie said, stepping beside me.

She was right. It was normal looking. Perhaps normal isn’t the right word, but considering the circumstances, it appeared shockingly plain. No grimace of pain or horror like the statues outside. She looked calm, her eyes directed to the ground. But something was off. Something about her expression didn’t seem genuine. As if the crafter had failed in capturing the minute details in the human face. Or, as if the statue faked it.

What I mean is when someone acts like they are calm, like nothing bothers them right now. The statue appeared as if there were hidden emotions boiling underneath the surface. If this was intended, then the craftsman was a true master of his craft. But this wouldn’t make much sense either. Why spend so much time and effort on the face and then entirely ignore the body?

“Okay,” Jonathan said, “that’s too much. Let’s head out and act like this never happened.”

“But Jonathan…” Peter begun.

“I will hear none of it,” Jonathan. “Peter, look at this. I don’t want to know why it’s here, or who made it. Fuck, this person could stumble in here any moment, and I don’t want to be anywhere near that psycho.”

Peter opened his mouth, but he had nothing to respond with. His bravado had burned away by discovering the statue. Marie and I were standing right in front of it. She was about to touch it as Jonathan turned off his lightning.

“Guys, I swear to god, if you’re not coming right now, I will leave you here.”

We both turned towards him. There was no point in denying the truth. Finding this little church with its weird statues was the most exciting and frightening thing we had ever experienced, but this place was wrong. None of this made any sense. This was where it got its allure from, but we were playing with fire.

Marie nodded. “You’re right, Jonathan. We shouldn’t…”

A groan cut through Marie’s words and made her stop. The sound came from the crucifix. Two seconds. None of us moved or talked for two seconds, but my god did it feel longer than that. The act of turning around made my entire body cramp up, every muscle tense. There was nothing. Nothing about the statue or crucifix had changed. Nothing had appeared out of thin air.

I exchanged glances with Marie. Perhaps something was behind the crucifix. And whatever had made that sound didn’t appear to be good health. It sounded more like the last breath of someone or something dying. I plucked out my pocketknife, touched the crucifix and glimpsed to what lay behind it. Marie used her phone to spend light, so we could see what was hiding behind it. And again, nothing. Only debris.

As we both had our hands on the rotten wood of the crucifix, the entire thing fell forward. I let out a gasp of air, too surprised to even scream, and leaped out of the way. Marie did the same, as the crucifix collapsed onto the ground, shattering the statue into countless pieces. Covered in the broken piece of what would have taken hours to make, the church’s silence carried the slam throughout the building into the forest, its echo hanging heavy on all of us.

As I locked eyes with Marie, I knew she had felt it, too. We both had our hands on the thing. The crucifix hadn’t just fallen forward out of nowhere. Something had pushed it.

We both jumped onto our legs and dashed towards our friends, the ice shards crunching underneath our feet. Marie jerked her light up, searching for whatever had shoved the crucifix. But there was nothing. Whoever was responsible would have been behind the top of the cross, somehow attached to the wall and small enough to fit into the gap between wood and wall. 

“Did you see it?” Marie asked.

“Marie, fuck, are you alright?” Peter said. “You…”

“Did you see something behind it? Something pushing it?”

Jonathan came towards her, putting a hand on her shoulder. “Marie, you need to breathe.”

“Did you…”

“No, we saw nothing. Okay? Just breathe, and then you can tell us what just happened.”

“She’s right,” I said. “There was something. Something pushed it. Fuck, there was something.”

“What?” Peter said, his eyes racing from Marie to me, looking for hints of a joke. “What are you talking about. The thing made a sound, you took a closer look, and then it just fell.”

I shook my head, having my hand on my chest, trying and failing to calm my heart. “No, that’s not…”

“We didn’t see anything,” Jonathan said. “But whatever caused it, doesn’t matter. We have to go now.”

Marie nodded, already at the exit. She still pointed at the crucifix and the shattered statue but said nothing. Repeating herself wouldn’t make any difference. As she walked outside backwards, a growl sounded from behind her. Three wild dogs stood between the statues, baring their fangs. Neither of them seemed to be in healthy condition.

They were very thin. So thin you could see their rib cage underneath their skin, their fur missing at several spots. Scars covered their bodies. Parts of their ears had been ripped off, marking of teeth still visible. They would have been a sorry bunch if they weren’t drooling as they stared at Marie, their hunger radiating out of their eyes.

Marie gasped once and then they rushed her. She made it back into the church before one of them caught up to her. The dog dug its fangs into her right calf, tearing at her with reckless abandonment. I can still hear her first scream. Faster than I could register, Peter had grabbed two broken beer bottles and leaped towards in front of Marie, dashing in between her and the two other dogs.

While he roared at them, slashing one of them across its snout, keeping them at bay, Jonathan and I came to Marie’s aid. The dog shook her leg, trying to rip her flesh away. Hearing her pained screams, we both stomped down on the dog’s head and neck. You know, I always thought I was someone that could never harm an animal. But at that moment, I wanted to see this waste of air whine and cry as we turn it into a bloody mess.

The dog was already weakened, and I could see how it withstood our kicks out of sheer desperation. At first, I didn’t know what had changed. Did it notice that it would die if it continued. Or did it hear its brethren tug tail and flee? But it was neither. It was the snow. Only as the dog let go of Marie and sprinted back into the woods did I see that it had started to snow again.

“That’s what you get,” Peter called after them, the beer bottled dripping red in his hands.

He snorted a few times before his blood calmed down, and he came to Marie’s side. “Holy fuck,” she hissed. “What the fuck was that.”

Peter was livid. He didn’t know what to do with his hands, them hovering usually over her. There were tears in his eyes, and I could hear how he struggled to breathe.

“Okayokayokayokay,” Jonathan uttered to himself, kneeling in front of Marie. “Paul,” he said to me, “hold your phone light in front of me. I need to examine her wound.”

I wasn’t teetering on the edge of a panic attack like Peter, but believe me, I was pissing myself right that moment. Once Jonathan gave me a clear order, I got control back over my body, my shacking hands struggling to hold the light still. If I did a horrible job, Jonathan said nothing, checking the wound through the torn shreds of Marie’s jeans.

“Uhm, Peter,” Marie groaned. “Give me your hand. I need something to squeeze.”

The words had to make their way through the brain fog that had veiled Peter’s brain before he gave his hand to her. “Don’t worry, big guy,” she said to him. “Everything will be fine.”

“But you…”

“Come on, tell me a stupid joke of yours. I… I need something to laugh at.”

Peter wiped away a tear, a nervous laughter escaping him. “Hey, we now know what to expect from our traps.”

No idea whether Marie found that actually funny, but she laughed, calming Peter.

“Okay, they broke skin…,” Jonathan said.

“Yeah, I’m bleeding, I know,” she responded.

“… but there is no fur sticking in it. We need to clean the wound with something like warm water. Do any of you bring water.”

Jonathan clicked with his tongue as we shook our heads. Sweet dangled down from his forehead, his eyes darting back and forth. “Okay, fuck it,” Jonathan said. “We will do make-shift bandage right now. I have…”

Without missing a beat, Peter ripped the left sleeve of his jacket. He held it in front of Jonathan, who stared at, his expression shifting into a frown. “What? No, I have… okay, whatever.”

He took the ripped sleeve and wrapped it around Marie’s wound as tight as he could. Marie hissed, clawing into Peter’s hand, who endured it in silence. “We will carry her back to my car, and then we will drive to the nearest hospital. Paul, as soon as we are out of here, and you got signal again, I want you to use Google Maps, okay? You will tell me which way to go, okay?”

I nodded, and Jonathan looked at Peter. “Peter? Peter, do you hear me,” he snapped his finger in front of Peter until he caught his attention. “You will be in the back seat with Marie. I will drive fast, so you will have to make sure she’s good. You got that? Peter, did you get that? Yeah? Good. Let’s move. Come on, go.”

Peter wanted to carry Marie on his own, but Jonathan convinced him in one bark that we would carry her together. Another sound came from outside the church, resembling a kind of thud. As if someone had slammed against something. The wind had picked up and the descending snow mixed with the fog made it impossible to see whether the dogs had returned, but that didn’t matter. Peter’s head turned crimson, veins popping on his forehead. “Those dumb motherfuckers.”

He picked up his bloody beer bottles and rushed out of the church. “Want another go?! Try, and I’ll rip you open from your ass to your mouth!”

“For fuck’s sake!” Jonathan cursed. “What are you doing?!”

We had started to get Marie up, but we had to put her down again as we hurried after Peter.

“Peter, get your ass back right now!” Jonathan shouted.

He stood between the statues, looking for the dogs. The weather had started to swallow their tracks, no new paw prints leading towards the church as far as we could see. But there was something. I can barely remember thanks to the entire situation, but it definitely sounded like a thud.

Peter’s knuckles turned white by how he gripped his weapons. “Come one,” he whispered to himself, his words nearly lost to the wind.

Jonathan griped Peter by the shoulder and turned him towards him. “Peter, I understand you're mad. We all are, but this is pointless, okay?”

“They fucking attacked her!” he shouted.

“I know, I know.”

“They could attack again! We have to find them and…”

“Right now, Marie is more important. She’s injured. She could get rabies if we don’t get her to the hospital asap.”

Peter’s anger faded away, replaced by uncertainty. “Fuck, I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have…”

“Yeah, yeah, sure. Now get your ass in there and help us.”

“Guys, wait,” I said, holding a finger to my lips. “Listen.”

Since we got out of the church, something had bothered me. My senses had picked up on a trail but failed to give me a clear picture of what. But now, I heard it. Following the wind, acting like a supporting melody to it, hidden inside its greater sound backdrop, someone was breathing. In long rasps, they took air into their damaged lungs, having an eerie similarity to an elder person on their deathbed.

The others heard it, too. Unfortunately, we failed to see it, though. When we got into the church, there were six statues, not seven.

Following my stare, Peter turned around in time for the figure with long white hair to leap at him. It tore him right off his feet, sinking its teeth into his neck. The mess of hair nearly reached its lower back, hiding most of its body. But despite that, one could easily identify it as humanoid.

This strange thing ripped at Peter’s flesh, starving to taste his blood. Peter grounded his teeth, pain turning his face white, as he rammed his beer bottles into the thing’s side. Jonathan took hold of the white hair, pulling at it while I stomped hard on its neck. I didn’t aim for the head out of fear of hitting Peter.

As Peter stabbed his attacker, his weapon often struck its rib cage. It was starved to a similar degree to the dogs from before, its bones visible underneath its pale blue skin. Whatever that monster was, it couldn’t endure our assault for long. With a sickening sound, he ripped out a junk from Peter’s neck and ran away on all fours, reminding me of a beaten monkey.

This is the point where it will get difficult to write more.

Peter had paled, blood pouring out of his wound. His breathing, hectic at first, grew weaker. Jonathan had lost his cool for the first time, mouth wide open, not knowing what to do. This time I tore off my sleeve, holding it to Jonathan. “We have to wrap it around him,” I managed to say, my voice shaking, burdened by fresh tears.

Jonathan nodded, thought returning to his mind. He worked surprisingly efficient for being taken by shock. “We… we have to run.”

I nodded and hurried into the church to get Marie. She had seen some of it, asking in a shrill voice what had happened. As she saw Peter leaning heavy on Jonathan’s shoulder, the upper part of the wrecked jacket turned red, she slapped her hand over her mouth, a silent sob escaping her lips.

“To my car and then…”

The sound came again. The thud. But louder and more numerous. As if to torture us, the fog lit for a moment, revealing more of our surroundings. The attacker stood near a tree, letting out a howl, its voice raw and damaged, like a rusted sword with chunks of its blade missing.

As a response, the thuds grew in intensity. Now we knew where it came from. The graves.

The first hand ripped through the soil, so scrawny it appeared to be nothing but a skeleton with skin wrapped around it. Its long nails were sharpened, perfect for piercing flesh. The other followed suit, like twisted trees emerging from the earth, birthing a forest that reeked of death. Only one grave was already dug out. The same Peter had slammed his foot against.

Marie whimpered, and Jonathan’s face cramped up, horror twisting his features. “Run!” I shouted.
