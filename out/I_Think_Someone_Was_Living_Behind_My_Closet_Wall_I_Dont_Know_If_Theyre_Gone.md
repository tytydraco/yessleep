I can’t talk to anyone I know about it because they’ll think I’m losing it. I mostly just want to put this somewhere so I’m not alone with it.

I moved into this apartment about three weeks ago.  
It’s an older building, the kind with radiators and thin walls. The landlord gave me a decent discount because “it’s been empty for a while.” That should’ve been a red flag, but I was desperate to move quickly.

At first everything was normal. Nothing creepy. Just old-building noises, neighbors you never see, stuff like that. The only thing that bothered me was the smell in the bedroom closet. Not strong — you wouldn’t smell it unless you were standing inside it — just this faint stale odor. Like old sweat, or breath, or something lived-in.

I cleaned it. Sprayed it. It faded a bit but never completely left.

But whatever. Old building.

Until I figured out that the back wall wasn’t a real wall.

I only noticed because I dropped something in the closet and it rolled toward the back… and I heard it *hollow* when it bumped the wall. The rest of the closet had a solid thud when you tapped it. That part sounded empty. Like touching thin wood.

I pushed on it and the whole panel moved.

It legit just slid back like it wasn’t attached to anything.  
I didn’t even use force. It basically fell inward.

Behind it was this narrow space full of trash — newspapers, cardboard, plastic scraps, and rat droppings. And right in the middle was a blue plastic barrel. The big ones. The industrial kind.

I know that sounds dramatic, but I swear I’m not making this cool for the story. It was just sitting there with a bunch of garbage around it, like someone shoved it in the wall and covered it up. The smell hit harder back there — not like rot, just old and stale and wrong.

Behind the barrel, someone had literally smashed open the drywall. It wasn’t cut out with tools — it was broken, like someone used their hands or something heavy. There were pieces of plaster and insulation everywhere, and a hole just big enough for a person to crawl into.

I know everyone reading this is already thinking “don’t go in there,” and you’re right. You’re completely right. I don’t know why I did. Curiosity? Stupidity? Not wanting to panic without proof? I honestly don’t know.

But I crawled in.

It sloped down, like a little tunnel. My phone flashlight barely cut through the dark. The smell got thicker the farther I went. About halfway down the tunnel, I noticed scratches on the wall. Like long, slow drag marks. Not animals. I’ve seen animal marks before. These were controlled. Straight. Repeated.

It made my stomach feel weird. Like I just realized I was somewhere I absolutely shouldn’t be.

At the end of the crawlspace was a metal ladder going down. The weirdest part? The ladder wasn’t attached to drywall or concrete — it was bolted into **stone**. Like whatever was down there existed before the apartment did.

I should’ve stopped there.  
You know that feeling when your brain is screaming at you to leave, but you keep going anyway?  
That’s what happened.

I climbed down.

At the bottom was this circular stone room. Like an old drainage chamber or something. Not huge, but big enough to stand and move around. It was cold as hell down there. There was a tiny stream of water running through a gutter in the floor.

Someone had been living down there.

Blankets. Old clothes. Cans of food. A lantern hanging off a nail. Not a modern lantern — like a cheap battery one you’d get at a dollar store.

And the walls had carvings on them. Not symbols or anything — just faces. Dozens of faces. All scratched or carved into the stone, all facing toward the ladder. Toward where I was standing.

I know how this sounds. I’m not asking anyone to believe me. I’m just saying what I saw.

I climbed back up as fast as I could. Nearly fell twice because my hands were shaking. I shoved the board back into place and pushed my dresser in front of the closet door.

That night, I heard something behind the closet.

Not rats.  
This was slower.  
Heavier.  
Like someone shifting their weight against a wall.  
Or breathing.

I didn’t sleep.

I called the landlord the next day. I didn’t tell him everything, just that I found “something weird” in the closet. He looked stressed as hell the second he walked in. When he saw the panel even slightly moved, he went pale.

He said, “It wasn’t like this before he moved in.”

I asked, “Before who moved in?”

He didn’t answer.

I asked, “Did the previous tenant leave normally?”

He hesitated for way too long.

Then said quietly:  
**“Nobody saw him leave.”**

He told me not to open the panel again.  
Then he basically bolted out of the apartment like he didn’t want to be inside anymore.

Last night was the worst part.

I woke up around 3AM because I heard the closet door creaking.  
Like something was gently pushing it open from the inside.

I grabbed my phone and stood in the hallway because I didn’t want to go closer.

Someone stepped out.

I swear to God I’m not making this up.

A woman stepped out of my bedroom closet.

She looked like she hadn’t been outside in months — clothes filthy, hair matted, barefoot, eyes wide like she was terrified or in shock. She just stood there looking at me like she expected me to say something. I don’t know if she was scared or angry or confused.

Her arms were scratched up, like she’d been crawling through something narrow recently.

Like the crawlspace.

I said, “Are you okay?”

She didn’t answer.

She tilted her head slightly, like she heard something behind her.

The lights flickered — just once — and she moved.

I don’t know how to explain it. She didn’t run. She didn’t fade away. She just… wasn’t there anymore. I don’t know if she stepped back into the closet or deeper into the apartment or something else. I didn’t see it.

The closet door was wide open.  
The wooden panel was gone.  
Not removed. Gone. I still haven’t found it.

I’ve been sleeping on the couch with the lights on.  
I don’t know if she was real.  
I don’t know if the previous tenant is still somewhere behind the walls.  
I don’t know if there’s still someone in that crawlspace.

I keep hearing breathing late at night.  
Sometimes scratching.  
Sometimes just silence that feels wrong.

I don’t know whether to call the police or just move out and pretend none of this was ever mine to find.

Anyway… thanks for reading.  
I don’t really know what to do.
