I woke up in an unfamiliar room. The room was made of stone, and in front of me was a large glass window with darkness behind it. A single light bulb hung from the ceiling above me.  
I looked down. I was strapped to a metal chair that was bolted to the ground, a metal bar went across my chest, thighs, and shins preventing any movement, although my arms and hands were free.  
Before me were two pedestals, each had a red button on top of them.  
A speaker cracked to life somewhere in the room, startling me. “Hello, Mr. Davidson,” a jolly voice said. “You must be wondering where you are right now. Well, Mr. Davidson, as you see, you’re in a room. Behind you is a single door, which you of course can’t see.”  
“Hey!” I struggled in the chair. “Hey, who the fuck are you! Let me go right now! This is illegal!”  
Laughter came from the speaker. “I know you’re eager to escape, Mr. Davidson, and you will in due time, but for now you must listen to me. Now look at the two red buttons on the pedestals.”  
I did. They were within range of my pointer fingers.  
“If you want to escape, Mr. Davidson, you must press one of the two buttons. But, before you do, let me show you what happens if you do.”  
A light turned on beyond the window, revealing a room similar to mine. My breathing caught in my throat, sweat formed on my temples. I wanted to scream, but I wasn’t able to.  
In the room were two people, one man and one woman, who were stuck to a wooden wall by nails through their hands and feet. Dried blood stained in a circle around the nails. Above their heads were long pikes that had their other half through the ceiling.  
“Depending on the button you press, Mr. Davidson, one of them will die. If you press a button, you live. Simple. You have eight minutes to choose, Mr. Davidson, or it’ll be you who will lose your life.” The speaker clicked off, and a clock above the glass turned on, revealing a countdown. 7:59, 7:58, 7:57.  
“What the fuck!” I yelled.  
The door behind me opened. Footsteps approached me, and someone appeared to my right. It was a man wearing a black suit with a black mask that obscured his face. The only parts of his head I could see was his short, brown hair styled back and his pale ears. He was too far away for me to grab.  
I thrashed in the chair some more, even though it did no good, I still continued. What the fuck was going on? Who were these people? All I could remember was going to sleep on my shitty couch and then waking up here.  
I turned to the masked man. “Hey,” I pleaded. “Hey, if you get me out of here, we can go to the cops together. I’m sure they’d offer you some sort of deal where you won’t go to jail. *I’m sure of it.* So please, *please get me the fuck out of here!*”  
The man only continued to stare at me in silence. The only movement he made was his slow, even breathing. I stared into his cold, green eyes. And it made me shiver. There was no emotion. It was like this guy wasn’t human. How could anyone just stand there watching and do nothing? I’ll tell you who, a psychopath, that’s who.  
I turned my attention back to the clock above the glass. 7:10, 7:09. 7:08.  
I looked to the people attached to the wooden wall, metal pike above their head ready to drive into their skull at the press of a button. Tears streamed down both of their eyes. Desperation filled their eyes, and a pleading.  
They opened their mouths, which revealed them having no teeth. Their mouths moved, trying to speak, trying to speak to me!  
I threw up all over my self.  
The timer had reached 6:59.  
The masked man approached me. He grabbed one of my hands, pinning it to the metal chair’s armrest. With my other hand I tried to pry his hand off my forearm, but he was too strong. In his right hand he raised a hammer, then brought it down on the pinkie finger of my right hand.  
A blood-curdling scream escaped my mouth.  
The masked man raised the hammer again, bringing down once more, bringing another scream out of me. He did it a couple more times before backing away. I forced myself to look at the damage done. My pinkie was at an odd angle, the bone broken, a bit of the bone stuck from the skin.  
I nearly threw up again.  
The speaker crackled to life. “Oh, dear,” that jolly voice said. “A minute had passed, and you lost a finger. Every minute a finger will be lost, Mr. Davidson. Think hard. Do you want to go into this world with no fingers? And take a look at those people nailed to the wood, Mr. Davidson. Nails are through their hands and feet, they lost their teeth, and a lot of blood. It’s a miracle that they’re still alive considering they’ve been here for a time.  
“Now, think of the life they’d have if they go out. In a way, Mr. Davidson, killing them is saving them.”  
The speaker clicked off.  
I screamed again, not only from the pain in my pinkie, but because of everything. Tears streamed down my cheeks. And the timer kept ticking. Moving closer to 5:59 second by second. If I did nothing, I would lose another finger.  
I looked at the buttons before me, then up at the two people. They shook their heads frantically, screaming, tears also rolling down their cheeks. They were watching me. They knew what I would do.  
“I’m, I’m sorry!” I shouted, pressing the right button.  
The pike above the woman’s head launched, piercing through her skull, killing her instantly. The man looked over at her, screaming, then looked at me. The door to their room opened and another masked man stepped inside. He raised a gun and shot the man in the head.  
The speaker crackled on. “Wow, Mr. Davidson. I actually didn’t think you had it in you. I’m surprised. Well, I guess it’s time for you to leave now. Thank you for playing, and good bye, Mr. Davidson.”  
I felt a prick in my neck, then everything went black.  
Then I woke back up in my room, on my shitty couch. I jumped up, thinking it had to be some sort of nightmare until I saw my pinkie at an odd angle, with a compound fracture.
