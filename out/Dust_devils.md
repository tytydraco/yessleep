‘Psychotic’ was probably the most generous title you could give my grandfather. Even before he got dementia, my experiences with him were vastly unpleasant. Me and my sister would joke about his ‘haunts’, or rather, his visits to our town. 

The first time that towering elderly figure came shambling through our front door, I knew from the nauseating stench of cigarette smoke and scotch that I wouldn't get along with that senile old fuck. 

Clad in a musky fur coat, gold rings, fedora and other sickeningly outdated drapery, he disturbed the peace every so often to watch over my sister and I. The weekends he watched over us were tense survival games of avoiding breaking whatever arbitrary rules he had decided we needed to follow. 

I've spoken with many people about the oddness of my grandfather, thinking that his guidelines and punishments were befitting that of a traditional conservative grandparent. Whenever I bring up his bizarre methods of childcare and punishment, people give me a disgusted and horrified look. 

You're seriously telling me no other grandparents got angry if you forgot to read Bible verses to the walls? You mean to tell me nobody else's grandfather poured dust in your cereal? He always had a wicked grin on his face whenever he watched us pull out our hairs to make dusters like he told us to. 

Whenever we cursed or said the Lord's name in vain, he would make us grind our teeth against a brick until our gums bled. If we didn't do our chores properly, he'd make us lick the dishes clean. 

He'd always hog the television whenever he was over, switching our kids cartoons to a channel featuring an evangelical preacher waving his hands describing the depravity of Jezebels and homosexuals. I remember how furious and unjustifiably angry he would get if we coughed or sneezed. 

Even if we covered our mouths, hearing me or my sister make an involuntary noise would send him into a ranting fit, telling us how disgusting we were. Occasionally, to make up for his abuse, at the end of the weekend our grandpa would sit down and have a heartfelt talk with us. 

“Listen, I'm only hard on ya cuz I love ya.” He would insist. His words never stuck with me or my sister, we hated him. Despite me and my sister's protests, our grandfather would always return to watch us. I had to be 9 or 10 when I finally snapped at him. 

He had growled at me for tripping with a glass of water, and told me I needed to lick the carpet dry. I pouted and put my foot down, refusing to do what he told me. Despite my defiance, the twisted, gnarled way his saggy old skin contorted into a gargoyle of white hot rage made my insides twist into knots. 

“You will lick up this mess you just made, or you will clean the entire house with your tongue.” He snarled, pointing a jagged ringed finger at my mouth. I stubbornly shook my head. I don't remember him ever beating me before that moment, and I did my best to make sure it didn't happen again. 

Still, I had a wrathful grandparent to make amends in that moment, and what I had to do to redeem myself in his eyes is a task that still leaves a bad taste in my mouth. “George! Get in here!” He yelled from the living room. 

I was kneeling in the bedroom with my sister comforting me, still weeping from the fresh bruises planted on my skin. My sister looked into my eyes like a guilty dog. I trembled and walked out into the living room, seeing my grandfather huffing and pacing around the couch. 

Slowly, he drew his eyes towards me, my own eyes magnetizing to the floor. He let out a long, disappointed sigh. “George, do you know what dust devils are?” He asked. I shook my head weakly. 

“They're little troublemakers. They gather in clumps in the dust and filth in corners whenever children misbehave.” He informed as he gestured up into the corners. “You must lick them. To get rid of them, you must lick them.” I stared at the corners of the living room for a few seconds. 

I stifled a gag as I imagined running my tongue over the dusty, cobweb filled corners of the room. “Do you hear me young man? Look at me.” He demanded. I met his gaze hesitantly, seeing his arms crossed and brow furrowed through my glistening eyes. 

“The dust devils will be your dinner. You will get no food besides them, do you understand me?” He sternly finished. I nodded. Without another word, my grandfather picked up a long, wooden pole, and placed it in my tiny hands. 

With no further instruction needed, I started poking at the corners with the wooden pole, hoping to draw out the dust devils. Nothing. The living room was silent. Where are the dust devils? I'm getting hungry. 

My stomach pleaded with me. I hate it when my stomach speaks. I prodded the corners with the stick again, I gently lowered the stick to my head and licked the end. Gagging, I licked up the cobwebs and dust. Not good enough. I'm still hungry. 

For minutes on end I desperately searched the corners of the room, I was starving. I was so hungry, it physically hurt my insides. I felt pregnant with hunger, it was tearing me apart from within. 

I feverishly lapped up at the walls with my tongue, beckoning the dust devils to enter my mouth. Too short. My little child body was too small to reach the corners. 

Come down to me! Come down into my mouth! I need to eat! My eyes widened, releasing tears of joy when I finally saw them. Grey, dusty little imps. Tiny, colorless winged creatures gathered in the corners. Living room light reflected off their beady black eyes. I've never been more hungry in my life. 

SMACK SMACK SMACK! I bludgeoned the small pale creatures with the stick. Some scattered, flapping their little wings to get away. Some fell limp to the ground. I scooped up the fallen angels and shoved them in my mouth. 

Dry, gray powder erupted from their flesh as I sunk my teeth in. I coughed as I forced the dusty flavorless meat down my throat. I'm so hungry. My mouth was a billowing chimney of gravelly fumes. 

Consuming these creatures came at a cost. Grey bile flooded out of my throat, specks of my dinner floating into the air as I heaved up my meal. Dust devils are no delicacy. But at least I didn't go hungry. 

My grandfather stopped visiting when I was about 15. We had to put him in an old folks home, as he tragically began to show signs of dementia. For years afterwards, I would come and visit. Maybe there'd be a dust devil or two sitting in the corner, and I'd pop it in my mouth. 

I hate the powdery texture and bitter taste of the dust devils. 

I hate the dust devils. 

I hate my grandfather.
