"Are we there yet?" Eddy groaned from the passenger seat for roughly the seventeenth time, complaining that his phone's GPS had lost signal miles ago. "Seriously, how are people supposed to find this hidden turn without internet?"



He was already halfway through his road trip snacks, which, knowing Eddy, were meant to last the whole weekend. Classic Eddy. He's one of those guys who's perpetually "between hustles," charming his way through life, always up for a good time, but with the follow-through of a wet paper bag. Still, you couldn't ask for a more loyal guy when things got real.



"Dude, if you complain again, I'm making you navigate with an astrolabe," I said, trying to keep a straight face as I dodged a pothole the size of a small badger … or maybe it was a badger.



Eddy paused for a moment like his brain was buffering, "A what now?"



From the back, Maya snorted. "Be nice Liam, you know Eddy doesn't know what things are if he can't use google" Maya's the pragmatist of our crew, sharp as a tack. She's actually starting to make a name for herself with her photography – gigs for local bands, a few art shows. She sees things others miss, both through her lens and in general. Right now, she was meticulously checking her camera batteries for the third time.



Chloe, beside her, was practically levitating. "Oh my god, I think I just heard a faint bass drop! We're close! Liam, can you *feel* the energy?" Chloe's our resident free spirit, an art school student with a heart full of unicorn dust and a head often in the clouds. For her, Emberbloom, especially with **Aetheric Echoes** headlining, was less a festival and more a spiritual pilgrimage.



"Feeling the energy of needing a pee break, mostly," I grinned, downshifting. Me? I'm Liam. I work a pretty standard construction gig to pay for my part-time online kinesiology degree – keeps me active, pays the bills. To my friends, I'm just the chill, slightly dumb muscle of the group, and honestly, I'm fine with that. It's easier that way.



The "Welcome to the Bloom!" archway was less an archway and more a massive, woven… thing of branches and flowers, looking like a forest exploded and then reassembled itself with surprising artistry. The "Welcomers" standing beneath it were our first real taste of Emberbloom's unique flavor. They all had this unnervingly placid vibe, but one girl, in particular, caught my eye.



She couldn't have been much older than us. Instead of the usual festival gear, she wore a long, flowing linen dress the color of saffron, with intricate, darker embroidery snaking around the hem and sleeves. Her feet were bare in simple leather sandals that laced up her ankles. Around her neck hung a long, wooden beaded necklace, and from it, a polished wooden amulet, about the size of a silver dollar, depicting that same looping, organic spiral I'd seen on the festival's website. Her dark hair was braided with wildflowers, and her smile, as she handed us our wristbands, was sweet, and her eyes a startling shade of green that seemed to hold the light.



"May your spirits find resonance within the Bloom," she said, her voice soft and melodic. Her gaze lingered on Chloe for a beat.



"Uh, thanks. You too," I managed, probably sounding like the articulate genius my friends thought I was. She just smiled wider and turned to the next car.



"Did you see her necklace, Liam?" Chloe whispered excitedly as we drove further in. "It's beautiful! I wonder if they sell them."



"Probably cost more than my first car, Chlo," Eddy quipped, already craning his neck for food stalls.



Setting up camp was the usual comedic ballet of tangled tent poles and misplaced stakes. "Seriously, Eddy, you had one job – the main support pole!" Maya sighed, wiping sweat from her brow.



"Hey, I was providing moral support and scouting for potential nacho locations! Equally vital!" Eddy retorted, striking a mock heroic pose.



Once the tents were semi-erect, I took a walk to get my bearings. That's when I first properly noticed the hum. A low, persistent thrumming, more a vibration in your teeth and bones than an actual sound. It seemed to be strongest near the festival's heart, where this towering wicker effigy – the "Ember Heart" – loomed over everything, looking like a giant, pagan piñata. The spiral amulet symbol was *everywhere*. Woven into banners, painted on the side of that girl's saffron dress, even subtly embedded in the "artisanal" (read: overpriced) craft stall signs. Just aggressive branding, I figured. Effective, though. It was already starting to feel… familiar.



We heard the first whispers about "The Jackals" from some seasoned festival-goers at the communal water tap. "Watch your gear," a guy with more piercings than teeth advised. 



"Jackals have been bolder this year. Territorial little rats. Look for the chalked wolf-head."



"Great," Eddy said, rolling his eyes when we got back to our site. "As if we didn't have enough to worry about with Chloe trying to spiritually adopt every squirrel she sees."



And, like a bad omen, Maya piped up, "Hey, has anyone seen my good trail mix? The expensive kind with organic goji berries?" It was gone. Vanished.



"Probably those damn Jackals already," Eddy grumbled. "Or Chloe ate it in a meditative trance."



Chloe was already halfway to the "Wisdom Weavers" tent. "There's a 'Harmonic Attunement Circle' starting soon! Silas might even be there for inspiration!" she called over her shoulder.



"You think she'll levitate this time?" I asked Maya, unraveling my sleeping bag - I know I wouldn't feel like doing it later.



Maya gave a droll smile while doing a jaunty backwards jog, "With Chloe, anything's possible. Just try not to lose any more critical supplies." still calling out as she turns to chase Chloe whooshing a hand into the air, "While I make sure she doesn't accidentally ascend to a higher plane of existence without a return ticket."



I watched them go, then turned back to the tent. Eddy had already cracked open a beer and was sprawled in a camp chair.



"Man, Chloe is... a lot," he said, taking a long swig. "All that 'energy' stuff."



"That's just Chloe," I said, taking a mental count of all my snacks. "She dives in headfirst. Always has."



"Yeah, no kidding," he smirked. "She's cute when she gets all passionate like that, though. Think I got a shot?"



I stopped what I was doing and just looked at him. "With Chloe? Dude, her head is in the cosmos. Your head is trying to figure out if it's a better deal to get two small brats or one large"



"Hey, opposites attract, man!"



I shook my head, laughing a little. "Not this time. She's not a conquest, Eddy. She's like... a whole weather system. All lightning and beautiful, weird clouds. Honestly? She'd be too much for you."



Eddy thought about it for a second, then shrugged. "Yeah, you're probably right. Way too much work. So... any of those Welcomer girls seem single?"



A couple of hours later, Chloe and Maya returned. Maya looked like she'd endured a timeshare presentation, but Chloe was… incandescent. "Oh, you guys, it was unbelievable," she breathed, eyes wide and sparkling. "The elder leading it, this amazing woman named Anya, she just knew things about me. And Silas was there! Just sitting quietly in the back, observing, his energy was so… pure. We all drank this special herbal infusion she made…"



"Did it taste like my goji berries, by any chance?" Maya asked dryly.



Chloe just smiled, a new, serene expression settling on her face. She started humming a strange, meandering tune, a melody that, I realized with a sudden, faint unease, seemed to intertwine with that deep, earthy hum I'd felt earlier. "Anya said the song of the earth is within us all, we just have to learn to listen."



"Riiiiight," I said. "Well, I'm listening for the sound of a burger sizzling. Anyone else?"



As dusk began to bleed across the sky, and the distant throb of Neon Sirens' sound check started to vibrate through the air, things took a slightly more overt turn towards the weird. I saw a group of those amulet-wearing festival staff – maybe a dozen of them, including the saffron-dress girl I'd noticed earlier – moving in a slow, synchronized procession towards the Ember Heart. Their previously sweet smiles were gone, replaced by expressions of intense, focused solemnity.



Maya, ever the documentarian, raised her phone. "Hold on, this is interesting…" She frowned, tapping the screen. "Huh. That's odd. Camera just glitched. Showing static for that shot." She tried again. Same result. "Battery must be playing up," she muttered, though she'd just charged it.



I scanned the edges of our campsite, that prickle of unease returning. And there, just for a heartbeat, half-hidden by a wildly psychedelic tapestry someone had strung up, I saw a figure. Dark hoodie, face obscured, and for just a second, I thought I saw a faint white smudge on the fabric – like a crude chalk mark. A wolf's head. They were just standing there. Watching. Then gone, swallowed by the growing river of people heading towards the main stages.



"Everything alright, Liam?" Eddy asked, noticing my gaze. "You look like you've seen a ghost… or worse, like they're out of your favorite craft beer already."



"Nah, just… festival lights playing tricks," I said, forcing a grin.



But as the first real bass drop of the night shuddered through the ground, vibrating up through the soles of my boots, I couldn't shake the feeling that the tricks being played at Emberbloom were a lot more complicated than just lights.
