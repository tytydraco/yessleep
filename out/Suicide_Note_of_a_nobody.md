Dear everybody who loves me Im sorry
Ever since I was a kid I realised I was different. I never cared for football basketball or even fuckin shotput i enjoyed my own company more than anything, Mother was a single one who worked hard every day and night at her retail job to provide for me and my brother. It was just me and Brother at the small small house on the small road that anybody and everybody would describe as poor. Brother beat me anytime, anywhere yet I don't blame him. He was going through the same thing as me but he had all the responsibility because he was the older one therefore he had to cook and make sure I was still kickin. He is in Jail now brother, your daughter misses you. I was so damn scared of the second floor of the house a pitch black colour enveloped and surrounded the stairs that led up to the second floor  i thought if i walked up them that the boogeyman or Jason would be at the top i begged brother to bring me to the toilet but he refused and continued to watch the tv i pissed in the corner of the living room praying it would dry before mother would come home. 

Everyday we would throw our trash on the floor even though we were instructed to clean the living room and kitchen. Our bed time was a strict 9 pm yet me and my brother would stay up since mother got back from her overtime at 10. When the time struck 9:44 brother would change the channel to the adult one and the countdown would begin at 9:45. That's when they would show boobs on the tv, something me and brother could bond over. When we saw two bright lights pour into the dark room we would shut the tv and run to our bunk beds it was her car we would then lie down and feign weak snores but mom never believed it when I realised we didn't do our chores my heart kept beating faster and faster praying mother would be too tired to care but every time i heard our names being shouted. Looking back on it i now me and brother were in the wrong but i was so tired so fucking tired. Me and brother went down to mother dressed in her retail uniform and cleaned the mess we made while all I could do was cry and complain.

 Looking back on it I'm sorry mother I'm so damn sorry. As the years went on the same thing happened over and over. Mother worked late to support two kids alone since our dad was out of the picture and she had no one else to help her. 

I got a tumour when I was around 8 and had to go on medication. Due to the meds I got really fat . After i was okay i continued to eat like a fucking pig and when i continued to be fat i blamed it on the meds. I was bullied heavily in school but it didn't matter much. I had some good friends damn good friends I miss you guys.

 During the early years of school I was an asshole. I acted as a tyrant towards those i called friends “we want to do this” no you cant i don't want to “let's go here” no i don't like there and they all listened to me. For fuck sake bestfriend would tell me about a new channel he was watching and i would lie and say “no i found them first” i hated myself and took it out on others. I was bullied for my weight and told on everyone who talked shit on me which made me hate myself more. When I moved on to my secondary stage of school all the friends who tolerated me were split up into different classes. I lost everyone. Brother was in the same school yet he hated me. I don't know why maybe it was the sibling rivalry that was never resolved, maybe it was the lack of a father figure but I don't know why. There I was in a new environment as the fat kid in a world of hormones and testosterone. As the day passed I found my friends in the school yard and we all promised each other we would never break up. But as the months passed friends started to dissipate one by one joining new friends groups and cliques until it was just me and best friend . 

Best friend was the best he never left my side even since my first years of school  yet he rarely went to our new school and for that i cursed at him and blamed him for never coming into school to be with me so i could i cure my fucking boredom. But now i know why he was severely depressed and yet i fucking blamed him for not fulfilling my ego. As the years went by I changed who I was. I wanted to be popular so I started to treat the weak kids like shit in my 2nd year of my new school . The teachers put me in charge when they left the students. The popular kids would tell me to tell the teacher that the students who were quiet and did their work were trouble makers and pulled shit while the teachers were out of the room. I did it. I'm sorry, nice kids I truly am. 

As the classes went on and on and the days passed and passed my brother had beaten me countless times and mother came back exhausted again and again. I had no outlet. Best friend was never in school and my old friends were in new groups. I ended up looking for an outlet. I would light a candle and pour the hot wax on my skin. The burning felt good and made me forget about everything for a second. As the years passed I became more popular in school due to my rapid decline in empathy.

 I didn't care about anyone and acted in accordance but with that i treated the popular kids with a lack of respect which somehow made me some sort of pseudo popular kid. The most popular kid Travolta was the best ever since he was a kid, a prodigy if there ever was one. Somehow Travolta became my rival. He would make fun of me and I would do so back. Since Travolta was the coolest kid I became even more of an outcast but in a way that was fun to me. All his friends would make fun of me and I just kept saying stuff back. It almost became fun for me. But with it i became an asshole making fun of everyone the losers the populars the jocks everyone alike. 

I got moderately skinnier in that time from every popular saying i was a fat fuck i ate less and worked out yet i still felt like a tub of lard. As the months passed school life got easier but home life worsened. Brother got worse and worse leaving at night and not coming back until morning until one day it exploded.

 Mother confronted brother about his delinquency. I huddled in my room until I heard a thump and I leaped out and saw brother choking mother. I grabbed the first thing I saw brother's electric guitar and hit him in the head with it. Mother looked at me with delightful glee but yet it looked so guilty. Brother left soon after failing his final school exams yet he still called mother anytime he needed help i begged her not to. All she said was “he is still my son” everytime it happened I gripped my fist tight. It was my final year of school and I had lost most of my weight. Travoltas gang actually started to like me unironically and best friend started to come to school more. That was probably one of the best years of my life. As the school year ended and everyone began to split, life became difficult. I got my exam results back and they were exactly middle of the road I should have expected. Of course i didn't study i simply didnt care  i just have myself to blame don't I. Brother got arrested for abusing Girlfriend after all that shit girlfriend got pregnant. I got into a community college which I hate and Best friend got a job. Best friend made a new friend group. One day I was doing the same monotonous walk to community college and something just snapped. 

Everything felt different. I couldn't do it anymore. I felt like nothing yet the world kept spinning with bustling people . I saw on social media Best friend having fun with coworkers Travolta doing great in a prestigious college and mother had gotten boyfriend with two new kids who she seemed to care about more than me. I had no place in this spinning world. I'm not good enough to be a lawyer or a doctor or a veterinarian. I'm a nobody and will never achieve anything. I couldn't talk to mother i couldn't talk to brother something in me yelled to just tell someone but everytime i thought about someone i realised they were better off without me and decided to scratch at my tongue i just couldn't force myself to ruin anyone's happiness im so fucking sorry.

Nobody cares about me. Nobody cares about my life. Nobody cares about my actions in this world. Nobody even cares about my name

For those who even bother to find my body this the suicide note of a nobody

Sorry for the fucking smell
