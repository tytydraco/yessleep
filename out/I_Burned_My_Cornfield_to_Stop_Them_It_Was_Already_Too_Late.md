I have always enjoyed walking at night. In this town, everything shuts down very early, and at that hour, all that remains is the distant noise of the highway and the sweet smell of the cornfield when the humidity drops. I usually follow the path that runs along the fields, where the sky looks clearer and the lights from the farms are hardly noticeable.

That night I was looking at Orion, as I always do, when something crossed the sky. It wasn't a plane or a meteor. It was a sphere of light, large, pulsating, as if it were breathing. It stopped just above the cornfield, near the old fence that separates my land from the Dawson family's.

Then it exploded silently.

Dozens of small white lights descended slowly, floating like luminous ashes. They fell onto the corn cobs and disappeared among the leaves without making a sound. I stood still, feeling as if I had seen something I shouldn't have.

Two minutes later, maybe less, I heard a soft crackling sound. Then another. And another. The corn cobs began to open from the inside, splitting as if something were pushing to get out.

And what came out was human in shape.

Slender, tall figures, covered by a kind of wet membrane that fell away as they hit the ground. Some were already walking upright. The worst part was that one of them turned its head in my direction. It had no distinct features, but I know it saw me.

I started running.

I crossed the gravel road, passed the rusty county line sign, and reached my house breathless. I locked the door, lowered the blinds, and stood there, listening, trying to calm my breathing.

Then I heard footsteps on the porch.

I looked through the peephole.

Outside was someone identical to Bill, the guy from the grocery store. It was him, but expressionless. An empty copy. Behind him, I saw two other familiar silhouettes. Exact replicas.

They knocked on the door. Softly at first, then harder.

The worst part wasn't seeing them imitate my neighbors. The worst part was realizing their tactic: they don't attack, they don't talk, they don't make noise. They just appear as perfect copies and take your place, as if they had always been you. And the most terrifying thing is not knowing what has become of the original people.

My hands were shaking so much that I had to take a step back.

I went up to the bedroom almost blindly, stumbling on every step. I closed the door, but before I could walk away, I heard a rustling on the floor, right behind me. Something was crawling. Suddenly, long, cold fingers slipped under the crack and grabbed my ankle.

The touch was wet, slimy, as if the skin hadn't finished forming.

Before I could pull away, I felt a flash inside my chest, a flash that didn't come from my eyes, but from somewhere deep inside me. It was like a warm light trying to break through to my mind. It wasn't pain; it was intrusion. It was as if it wanted to read me, copy me, know who I was.

My vision darkened at the edges. I felt something inside me recoil, as if trying to escape from this presence that was trying to enter.

I screamed and kicked out. The fingers recoiled suddenly, sliding under the door. I staggered away.

My ankle burned. It had a reddish, circular mark, like a chemical burn.

At that moment, the knocking on the front door stopped. The silence that followed was not normal. It was a tense, expectant silence, as if something was listening on the other side of the walls.

I stood still, not breathing. I knew they didn't need to keep knocking. They had touched me. They had seen inside me.

I don't know how long I sat there on the bedroom floor. When dawn finally broke, I got up. I got dressed quickly and went back to the cornfield. I needed to see what had happened there during the night.

The plants swayed in the wind, but as I walked between the rows, I saw that many ears of corn were open, torn from the inside, leaving damp, empty holes.

I kept walking.

I found fresh footprints in the dirt, all pointing in the direction of the village.

I understood that they needed the cornfields to be born. And that if they stayed there, there would be more.

I don't know if it was fear, desperation, or simple instinct, but I went to the shed, grabbed the old fuel can, and returned to the field. I lit a match. The fire spread too quickly, lighting up the entire valley as if dawn had suddenly broken. For a moment, I thought I had done the right thing.

It didn't take ten minutes for the sirens to arrive.

I ran to my house and waited with my heart racing. A police car stopped in front of the porch. When the car door opened, I felt the ground sink beneath my feet.

It was Ben, the sheriff. Or, at least, a perfect replica of him.

He climbed the steps with heavy steps. He knocked on the door twice. I didn't say anything. Neither did he.

He came in and grabbed my arm effortlessly, pushing me against the hallway wall. The blow left me stunned. Another push took me out the door, and I staggered onto the porch.

He pushed me toward the patrol car and opened the back door. He shoved me inside with a blow that left my temple ringing. He slammed the door shut and got behind the wheel.

The car started without him saying a word.

As I tried to catch my breath, I looked at my hands. They weren't restrained. There were no handcuffs. He hadn't used them at all. The real Ben would never have forgotten.

That detail chilled me.

It wasn't carelessness. It was ignorance.

Ben is an NBA fanatic. He lives for the Boston Celtics. The last time I spoke to him, he spent ten minutes telling me absurd statistics about the Eastern Conference.

So I said, very quietly:

“Ben... how's the Eastern Conference doing this year?”

He didn't blink.

“I don't know,” he replied.

The confirmation hit me like a block of ice.

It wasn't Ben.

It was his replica.

At the entrance to the village, he didn't turn toward the police station. He kept going straight, skirting the houses, and took a dirt road toward the old feed factory.

As we got closer, I noticed a sweet, dense, almost cloying smell. I remembered it well: the smell of the factory when it was still in operation. Fermented grain, organic debris, something that made your throat close up a little.

But it had been closed for years.

That smell could only mean that someone had started it up again.

The car drove between the rusty silos. I already knew why they were taking me there. If the cornfields were used to create replicas, the feed mill could be used to dispose of the originals. I had no proof. Just a growing certainty that I would not come out of that place alive.

And then I saw it:

The back door wasn't locked.

He hadn't activated it.

He didn't know he had to.

It was my only chance.

I swallowed hard.

I put my hand on the handle.

One.

Two.

Three.

And I threw myself out before the car stopped.
