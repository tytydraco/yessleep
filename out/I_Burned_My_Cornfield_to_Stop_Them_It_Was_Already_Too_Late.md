I have always enjoyed walking at night. In this town, everything shuts down very early, and at that hour, all that remains is the distant noise of the highway and the sweet smell of the cornfield when the humidity drops. I usually follow the path that runs along the fields, where the sky is clearer and the lights from the farms are hardly noticeable.

That night I was looking at Orion, as I always do, when something crossed the sky. It wasn't a plane or a meteor. It was a sphere of light, large, pulsating, as if it were breathing. Likewise, it stopped just above the cornfield, near the old fence that separates my land from the Dawson family's.

Then it exploded silently.

Dozens of small white lights descended slowly, floating like luminous ashes. They fell onto the corn cobs and disappeared silently among the leaves. I stood still, feeling as if I had seen something I shouldn't have.

Two minutes later, maybe less, I heard a soft crackling sound. Then another. And another. The corn cobs began to open from the inside, splitting as if something were pushing to get out.

And what came out was human-shaped.

Thin, tall figures, covered by a kind of wet membrane that fell off when they hit the ground. Some were already walking upright. The worst part was that one of them turned its head in my direction. It had no distinct features, but I know it saw me.

I started running.

I crossed the gravel road, passed the rusty county line sign, and reached my house breathless. Furthermore, I locked the door, lowered the blinds, and stood there listening for a while, trying to convince myself that I had imagined it.

But then I heard footsteps on the porch.

I looked through the peephole.

Outside was someone identical to Bill, the guy from the grocery store. It was him, but expressionless. An empty copy. Behind him, I saw two other familiar silhouettes. Exact replicas.

They knocked on the door. Softly at first, then harder.

The worst part wasn't seeing them imitate my neighbors. The worst part was suddenly realizing their tactic: they don't attack, they don't talk, they don't make noise. They just appear as perfect copies and take your place, as if they had always been you. And the most terrifying thing is not knowing what has become of the originals. That thought left me frozen.

Just when I thought they were going to break down the door, I woke up.

I was in my bed, drenched in sweat. It had all been a dream. Or so I wanted to believe.

I got dressed and went out at dawn. The dream had been so real that I needed to check it out. I went to the cornfield. The plants swayed calmly in the wind, but as I walked between the rows, I saw that many of the cobs were open, torn from the inside, leaving damp, empty holes.

I kept walking.

I found fresh footprints in the dirt, all pointing toward the village. My stomach sank.

I understood that they needed the cornfields to be born. And that if they were still there, there would be more.

I don't know if it was fear, desperation, or simple instinct, but I went to the shed, grabbed the old fuel can, and returned to the field. I lit a match. The fire spread too quickly, illuminating the entire valley as if dawn had suddenly broken. For a moment, I thought I had done the right thing.

It took less than ten minutes for the sirens to arrive.

I ran to my house and waited with my heart racing. A police car stopped in front of my porch. When the car door opened, I felt the ground sink beneath my feet.

It was Ben, the sheriff. Or, at least, a perfect replica of him.

He climbed the porch steps with mechanical calm, as if every movement had been rehearsed. He knocked on the door twice.

“Open up, please,” he said in his exact voice, but without emotion.

As I listen to him knocking on the door, I feel for the first time that something is watching me from inside my own house.

I didn't open it. I stood still, paralyzed.

Because I understood that they weren't coming to arrest me.

They were coming to replace me.

The invasion has begun.
