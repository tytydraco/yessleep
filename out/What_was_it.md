This happened 14 years ago, and to this day i still consider my self lucky. The morning was cool as we loaded into the ambulance heading to a call at the edge of town. It was 6:12 am and it was still dark outside.

 We were called in by the police station saying that there were multiple wounded and a few dead at what seemed to be a farm. We didnt actually know what caused the injuries, but we made our way to the scene. 

The address took us to a dirt road that lead us to a home that had 2 police cars outside with their lights on, but we didnt see any officers posted, there was no one there. The home was attatched to the farm that seemed to be either deserted or just really old, but my main focus was on the cop cars out front, typically when they were called to a scene there is at least a police officer guiding us to where we needed to go, but there was no one.

 A situation like this could be dangerous, we could be heading into danger and not know it. The homes front door was open but there werent any lights on, there seemed to be blood on the front porch that lead into the house. 

Hading been in the field for 18 months, i was pretty hardened by multiple calls with car crashes and even a triple homicide, but something about call was different, for the first time being on call i was actually afraid, i decided that rather than just sitting around that we should enter the home and try to find the injured people. 

I slowly entered the home with a flashlight and a medical bag, the blood that was on the porch lead into the home and up the stairs, i made my presence known but i got no response, i tried the lights but they didnt work, what was this place?

 As i searched the bottom floor clues i started to hear muffled sounds coming from upstairs, it sounded like something very heavy, being dragged across the floor. The other paramedics that were now with me also heard the sounds upstairs but they also seemed to feel scared. 

We heard the dragging sounds continue upstairs slowly moving to the top stairs, not thinking i began to walk to the stairs to see if there was anyone there, the blood on the stairs was thick and it made it slippery since the floors were made with wood.

 i shined my light to the top of the stairs having no idea what to expect, i slowly continued forward with the other paramedics behind me. 

We were half way up the stairs when we saw a hand pull forward, a policeman who was on the ground, he continued to drag himself on the ground revealing that his lower half was missing. "Get out of here before it sees you" he said with extreme pain. 

My medical training must have kicked in as i ignored his warning and i rushed to his aid at the top of the stairs. At the top of the stairs i could see what remained of the officer and the trail of blood that he produced that came to another set of stairs leading to what appeared to be the attic. 

The 2 paramedics that were with me attended to the officer at the top of the stairs and i ventered slowly to the stairs of the attic.

 Above me i could hear sounds that im not able to describe, but they were terrifing in nature, sounds that i assumed to be grunts or something very large eating. My flashlight was the only thing illuminating my path in the long hallway leading to the attic stairs.

 The hallway was long and unfurnished, i could see scratches on some of the walls and floors although blood covered most of the floor. 

I had no idea what was happening here or more importantly what was still happening, but i assumed due to the blood and lack of personel at the scene that there were many that still required my help although scene was most likely dangerous.

 Ive experienced violence before while on duty, many people while in shock can be aggressive and numb to pain while making subduing them quite the task. I wasnt necessarily preparing for violence although its never outside the realm of possibility. 

I proceeded to the attic steps alone flashlight in hand, i was tempted to announce my presence but i decided against it, i had a feeling that i never experienced before, but the best was i could describe it was that i was about to meet the devil.

 The literal embodiment of evil was up these stairs, i walked up the stiars slowly hearing sounds much clearer, sounds that didnt sound good. 

I was about to reach the top of the stairs when i heard a loud sound coming from downstairs and a rushing of people entering the home. I quickly turned around and ran down the stairs over to the other paramedics and the officer that was in grave condition. 

Coming up the stairs was a SWAT team in full gear. This wasn’t your average SWAT team, they looked like an FBI SWAT but none of them had the badge, every part of the body fully covered in different equipment and they carried Military grade weapons. 

When they reached the top They ordered us all downstairs and told us to leave the officer. The officer was bandaged but unresponsive due to blood loss. They asked me "where is it" sternly, as if they knew what they were about to face, and i pointed to the attic stairs.

They rushed the stairs leading to the attic with their weapons drawn and we went down the stairs. From the bottom floor we could hear screeching and gunfire coming from the attic, a lot of gunfire. 

We were ushered outside by more members of the swat team, by this time the sun was starting to rise and not only did the swat team arrive, but also what seemed to be government officials in suits. 

They pulled us aside and asked us questions. They asked us what we saw and who was all inside, we hadnt seen much so we told them the truth.

 I asked them "what was going on, what was inside", they didnt answer me and they told me to attend the people that theyll be bringing out. 

They brought out 7 bodies that day, 7 mangled bodies, none of them fully intact. From my understanding it seemed like they killed whatever was up there but I never got to see it.

What happened here? What did they shoot in the attic? What was i about to see in the attic had the SWAT team not arrived? I’ve researched on what it could’ve been but the weirdest part that still lingers the most in my mind, the people who just stood there like nothing was going on whilst clearly hearing the horror inside the house, I’ll never forget the screeching. Im just glad that i was wasnt one of those bodies.
