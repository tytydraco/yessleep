This isn’t my story, but my aunt’s, her name is Cassie.   
So anyways it started when she was a child. She lived in a large house on a property that looks like it came out of one of Mike Flanagan’s shows on Netflix. She said it was a large estate and her mom and grandma and herself lived there.   
She had many creepy stories in this house, and she documented it all in a notebook when she got older. She let me borrow the notebook a while back because I’m into paranormal things, so here are a few of the experiences she had.   
When she was super young think 7-8 her mom had a boyfriend who was into the occult. She said that one night she went into her mom’s room because she had a nightmare and she was trying to get her mom to wake up and she looked over and the boyfriend was staring at her, eye wide open, and they were solid black. She freaked out and ran back to bed… he later went on to “touch” her. But when she told her mom and grandma, the man “disappeared.”  She said he never came around and they never spoke of him anymore.   
She was a little older now and her mom had bought her a large teddy bear, think the Snuggles detergent bear. She had him around her all the time and she said she loved him. But then one day when she was at school the grandma was home alone with the bear.  
Cassie came home from school that day, her bear was in the fire pit outside burned to a crisp. When she asked her grandma what happened. She sat her down and told her… the bear started TALKING.   
She was in the kitchen making tea and she heard someone talking in the living room, so she thought that Cassie’s mom had come home or something. She walked into the room, and she looked over to couch and the bear was STANDING UP, TALKING about unaliving the whole family. So, Grandma said she grabbed him and took him outside and burnt him. She said he even screamed as she lit him on fire.   
On another night Cassie was in bed, and she said it was a few hours after she had gone to bed and she woke up and her whole room was blood red, and at the foot of the bed was a man, The Devil, smiling at her. She grabbed her bible and started reading until she fell back asleep.  She also mentions in the notebook that there was a spirit that walked the halls of the estate and drug chains around and another who was an old man who wore overhauls. She saw them many different times.   
When she was a teenager, she began dating my uncle and he came over one night, and they were hanging out. He saw the man with overhauls down the hallway and got freaked out and decided to go home when he got home, he swore that he was lying in bed and then THE BED BEGAN SHAKING!!!   
Her notebook was full of paranormal stories from her life, but these were some of the highlights about that house, the house mysteriously burned down, taking her Grandma with it,  and they never figured out what happened.  My aunt and uncle got married and were married 30 years, had 3 kids together but after the first child, a daughter, was born the hauntings picked back up again. when their daughter started complaining of "The Closet Man" They reached out to paranormal investigators who concluded that my aunt and Cousin has ESP and spirits or demons or whatever are drawn to the women in their family. They said they believe that The Boyfriend of her mom had attached something to her whether it be by the things he did to her or in the afterlife, but they said it seems like something is after her and her children. They then had a second girl and it got worse, after they had their 3rd it all stopped, he was a boy.   
She wanted to try and forget about it all, but my uncle was obsessed and continued to try and see what all would happen if he provoked it. So, after that the spirit started after my cousins, her daughters, IT would throw things at the girls and grab them and pushed them down. Finally, Cassie had enough and ended up divorcing my uncle and when paranormal stuff happens to her now, she just pretends it doesn’t…
