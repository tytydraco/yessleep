The cat before me looked more like a Pokémon than a real animal. “Is she-“ I began in a whisper. The tall woman in charge of the animal shelter corrected me, “He. He’s a he.” 



I looked back at the cat. His ears were long and large, like the ears of a lynx. Long, fluffy tufts of fur were sticking up from the tips of his ears. His eyes were large yellow orbs. Full of secrets and mischief. His fur coat was similar to a tabby, except his head and ears were covered in dark grey fur. His whiskers were long and fine. I held my hand out near the cage bars. The cat was sitting grooming himself near the back. He looked over at me as a I beckoned and I could swear I a sentient light flicker of recognition in his eyes – a connection between him and me. 



He let out a small meow and ran over. 



He licked at my fingers through the bars and my heart melted. He was the most adorable thing I’d ever seen. I stroked at his head through the bars and he was so soft and warm. “Oh my wow! He’s so friendly. Exactly what I need. What breed did you say he was?” The animal shelter employee looked noticeably surprised, “Oh my he’s normally shy with new owners. And we’re not entirely sure what breed he is. Got him about a month ago. He was found in a dumpster. He was tiny back then but he’s much bigger now and still growing.” She said, her voice soft. “Oh really? How many owners has he had? I wonder if he’s got a bit of maine coon in him? Or perhaps even mountain lion?” I said half-jokingly with a quiet laugh. The animal shelter employee broke eye contact with me. She said hesitantly, “Well, I’m not really supposed to say, but, we’ve tried giving this cat to a few family homes. And you know, these aren’t just random people. These are families who take cats from us regularly. He - he. Well. He bit the children. And was generally very - unfriendly.” She tried to make a joke and half-laughed. It faltered. My eyes were wide now. “So, he’s dangerous? But he seems so sweet.” I looked over at the adorable cat now gently nibbling  the tips of my fingers. “No no, not dangerous *per se*. Just needs the right environment. Sometimes the animals we get just aren’t well suited for children. Maybe as he gets older he’ll mellow out.” 



As he licked me with his sandpaper tongue I laughed “That tickles! Oh, I’m so taking him with me.” The employee smiled. This time genuinely. “Alrighty, I’ll get the paperwork together.” After a few minutes of signing forms and receiving copies of vaccination certificates I walked out the door with my new best friend tucked under my arm in her new cat-box. My smile was beaming as I walked toward my small green Toyota. As I got to my car I searched, one handed, for my keys. My smile fell slightly as I remembered why I had come to the animal shelter in the first place. 



I had just been through a really bad breakup. After years of our relationship slowly dissolving, my girlfriend of ten years had moved out and moved on. I was left alone in our old house. It was a large house out in the suburbs and it felt quite empty to be there all alone. To top it all off, since I’d come out as gay my super religious family had not really kept in touch with me. My mom sometimes answered my calls but my dad, sister and grandmother wanted nothing to do with me. It really hurt. We had always been close before, but because I liked girls and not boys they refused to acknowledge my existence.  Despite feeling horribly betrayed I tried my best to inform them about my life but I doubt they cared.  So I was feeling very alone at the moment



To add insult to injury, my sleep had been badly affected. Over the last week I experienced severe bouts of sleep paralysis. I now often wake up early in the morning. Completely frozen with panic and fear. I feel a horrible weight on my chest. Like my heart and lungs are filled with liquid lead. I hear strange noises and see horrendous shadow-shapes move about my room until I can finally sit upright and turn on the lights. I always hold my breath. 



Expecting something to appear in the light. 



Looming over my bed.  



But the shadows always retreat revealing nothing. 



Just my mind being an asshole. 



I was talking with my friends about it and they recommended I get a pet to have another heartbeat around the house. This would help me feel not so lonely while I get used to being single again. So, one Saturday I found the nearest animal shelter and drove on over. The rest is history.



As soon as I got home with my new companion I knew the first thing he’d need would be food and water. And a place to go to the toilet. Of course, I had already purchased these all from the store on my way back from the shelter. I set everything up and looked up the major dos and don’ts of introducing cats to a new home. 



A week went by and my adorable friend finally got a name. I had tried picking a name for him that whole week but nothing seemed to stick. Most of the names I tried I hated or he completely ignored, but sometimes when I offered up a name he really despised his large glowing yellow eyes would fix me with a disapproving stare. “Okay okay, I won’t call you Garfield. Well why don’t you give me some suggestions sometime?” I said at him as I felt his impatience leak into his stare. 



It was a Friday evening and he was sitting on my lap, kneading the way cats do when they want to get comfy. I was busy watching trash of some kind. I think it was a Steve Segal movie. Anyway, once it was over the next movie on the channel began. I lazily clicked the remote to check the title. On a blue banner that ran along the bottom of the TV screen, white letters spelled out: *Casper (1995).* I rolled my eyes. “Nah,” I said aloud as I put my now empty bowl of instant ramen on the table next to me. I switched off the TV. 



Suddenly I jumped from fright and yelped as the TV flicked back on. “What the?” I muttered. Then I noticed my cat was holding his one paw on the remote while glowering at me with his yellow eyes. They shone like beaming, double moons as if to say, “How dare you interrupt my TV time?”. “Sorry, okay,” I said at him, glaring back. I looked back at the TV to see the titular character on screen. 



My cat let out a small meow and jumped down. He ran over to stare at the screen. He held out a little paw and seemed to wave it at the ghost. He pointed and then he turned to look at me. 



Over the last few days I grew increasingly convinced he was preternaturally intelligent. Definitely sentient. What made me a bit uneasy was that he often got into rooms or places he could not possibly get into. It was almost like he could walk through walls. Or maybe he could pick locks? I chortled at this thought. I’m pretty sure he could clean up his own toilet if I gave him the tools and the time to learn. 



So, as he sat there looking at me while gesturing to the TV I knew intuitively what he was trying to say, “Casper? You want your name to be Casper?”, I said. He meowed loudly in the affirmative. I was struck by a sudden pleasant feeling that ran down from my ears into my heart. It was like warm syrup was leaking down my ear canals and into my blood. Hot and sweet. “Well, Casper, you are really just one surprise after another.” 



As time continued to fly by he grew steadily larger and larger. Most cats eventually stopped growing but he refused. Also, your average cat was a fussy eater. But not Casper. He ate with a voracious appetite that sent bits of cat food flying all over the kitchen floor. He was extremely fond of raw meat, including fish. Especially tuna. And he would often meow and beg loudly if I was handling raw chicken in the kitchen. Sometimes he would even break dishes if he didn’t get his way.



At first, he was happy to stay inside most of the time, but as he got older he started to scratch at windows more and more, begging me to let him out. Once I thought he was big enough I decided to trust him and let him roam. He had all his shots and had been neutered so I didn’t believe it was so bad to let him run around. All I hoped was that he came back of course. On that first day he went out I sat and waited by the window. My breathing fast and anxious. But by sundown he had returned and expected his dinner. 



Weeks quickly turned into months and Casper and I fell into a routine. Most mornings Casper would jump silently onto my bed and cuddle with me. Then when my alarm went off at 7:30am he would gently lick my nose until I got out of bed, giggling. He would dance between my feet as I walked groggily to the kitchen to prepare our breakfast. Then as I got ready for work he would sit and wait by the door to the back yard. As I got my makeup on and hunted for my keys I would walk over and let him out for the day. Then, after work I would return home and he would always be waiting for me by the front door. His yellow eyes would glow with happiness when he saw me. His bushy tail would stick up and he’d run up to me to give me rubs and purrs as I fumbled for my keys and opened the door. I would make us both dinner and we would cuddle together on the couch while I finished work or watched trash TV. 



Then just before bed he’d scratch at the door again. While I brushed my teeth I’d normally walk over to the door and let him out. Then I’d get ready for bed. Often, but not always, if I stayed up late in bed engrossed in a book I would hear Casper tap at the window, asking to be let back inside. On these nights I’d let him in and we’d cuddle in bed. His body would hum with loud purrs. Some people say cat’s purrs have healing properties. I can honestly understand why. Whenever we were all snuggled up in bed I swear I could feel his purrs slowly healing my soul. Leaching away my traumas and sadness. Like that meow he made sometimes that felt just like a rush of MDMA. His purrs were comforting and restorative.



When it came to guests Casper mostly ignored them and spent his time on my lap. However, there was one noticeable example where he jumped up and scratched one of my friend’s boyfriends because he had accidentally trodden on my foot. Besides that, Casper was a very easy-going cat.



The last few weeks with him had improved my mood hugely. All my friends and work colleagues, even my mom noticed the difference in my demeanor. I was smiling again, making jokes. I had even been out with my friends more in the last week than I had in the last year. 



Then one night everything changed.



I had had a stressful day at work. Teaching university level psychology is not easy and kids can be exhausting. But the work was very rewarding most of the time. However, the day had drained me so when I got home I was really looking forward to spending the evening vegging out with Casper. But when I arrived home and got out of my car he was not waiting for me on the front porch like normal. I frowned and walked over to the door. I called out for him a few times and looked around the perimeter of the house but found nothing. This was the third time now in the last week he’d not greeted me at the door. I wasn’t that worried about him but I was disappointed he’d not be around for cuddles. I’d probably only see him in the morning. He was very large now and I’m sure he could take care of himself. I was more worried about what he might be eating or hunting. I hope my neighbor’s Chihuahua is not on Casper’s menu. I chuckled as I made my way inside. 



After a dinner of cold leftover pizza, I decided to watch something light and go to bed early. As I sat in bed reading I decided to leave my window open. I’d done this the last few nights since Casper was out and I wanted him to be able to get in if he needed. “I really need to get that cat-door installed” I said to myself quietly as I got into bed with my book. 



When I awoke I knew something was very wrong. 



It must’ve been close to dawn. Early morning light poured through the window and made its way onto my carpeted bedroom floor. The dark outlines of the bushes and trees were stark against the grey, lightening sky. My limbs were frozen in place and I felt a strange tension and heaviness on my chest. My heart thumped loudly. I was having another episode of sleep paralysis. I tried my best to regulate my breathing and calm down when I saw a white, spider-like hand slowly emerge from the dark gap under my bed. 



If I could have screamed I would have.



Nothing but a muffled moan escaped me. 



My body tried to squirm but I remained helplessly locked in place. The pale, dawn-colored hand stretched out further. Then I could see another hand. And now arms. And now a masked face. Now a dark torso. Now legs. All emerging so slowly. So silently. Like a horrible insect carefully unfolding itself out of its lair. 



Soon a massive figure, all clothed in black, including a balaclava, loomed menacingly over me. My head filled with panic. *What the hell?* *Was this really happening? Was I dreaming?* I still couldn’t move. Then I saw the figure pull a knife from his belt. It was large and gleamed sickly in the morning light. “Hello there, little rabbit” said a soft male voice. 



It was at that moment that the paralysis finally wore off. I rolled like an armadillo across my bed and made it to my feet. 



Running to the door was suddenly all I could hold in my mind.



The door handle filled my vision. 



I ripped it open. 



I did not dare look behind me. 



I ran. My heart threatened to explode. 



As I approached my front door I felt a hand seize my hair and heave me back. I screamed in pain and horror as I felt myself fall to the ground, knocking over a dining room chair as I did. The masked figure bent over me now. The knife still gleaming. He was breathing heavily. “Rabbit can run. But not fast enough”. 



I held my hands in front my face, “Please, why are you doing this?” I yelled, tears streaming down my face. For a moment the man remained motionless. Then he crouched on his haunches. He peeled off his mask. I flinched and moved back slightly. The light of the dawn revealed him to be a handsome young man with bright blue eyes and fair hair. Couldn’t have been more than twenty years old. I think I even recognized him. Had he been a student of mine? “Why don’t you tell me. Why does anyone do anything?” his lip curled into a snarl and he held up the knife ready to plunge it into my stomach when suddenly we both heard a loud growl. The sound of it made me think of the zoo. And *Jurassic Park*. 



I heard the intruder yell with horror. Saw him leap to his feet as a shadow which grew behind me suddenly leapt into the air and pinned him to the ground. I heard the intruder scream in pain as whatever the thing was tore at him with its teeth and claws. Ripping chunks of meat and viscera. The screaming soon turned to gurgles and then was gone all together. For a long time, all that could be heard was the tearing of meat and tendons and the wet chewing of a carnivorous beast. I sat on the floor fixated by fear and shock. I felt like if I moved I would be next to die. I was cold and shivering.



The whole time my mind felt numb and blank. I felt like I’d swallowed TV static and it had filled up my brain and limbs. Every so often I would feel a warm fleck of blood or some other fluid hit my cheek as the beast continued to feast messily on the intruder. Soon all trace of the intruder was gone save a few bits of bone and uneaten entrails. 



As the light in the house grew brighter I could finally see the beast clearly. It was about twice the size of a tiger and had dark patterned fur. Its head was enormous, ears were long with tufts of fur sticking out. The snout was stained red with dried blood. It was busy licking its enormous clawed paws when it stood up and fixed gigantic yellow eyes on me. “C-Casper?” I said looking directly at the beast. It looked just like him. I mean, like he would look if he was a giant tiger. I felt my heart accelerate. The blood pumping faster and harder through my veins. 



Casper slowly stalked up to me. Those pale, glowing yellow eyes never breaking their gaze on me. Then, just when I thought I was going to die, he nuzzled his head against mine and began to lick at my scratched knees. I sighed massively with relief. Then Casper looked at me, and I felt words form in my mind that were not my own. “Yes. Yes. I Casper. I like this food best. More food. More like this. Presents. More presents like this. I can give you presents too. But I need more presents.” The words were gentle whispers but their sibilance was overly emphasized and sharp. It hurt to hear those words spoken like that. My head felt fuzzy. Was I really talking with a murderous beast that was somehow my cat? That had somehow eaten a psychotic intruder? Was this real? I blinked my eyes a few times and rubbed them hard. “Ummmm. Yea. Okay. Well let’s see. Oh, and thank you by the way.” I said sheepishly. Not sure what I should say in this kind of situation. 



After I’d smoked a cigarette and had some water I called the police. Casper wasn’t happy about the decision but by the time the officers arrived at the house he was back to looking like his regular old self. The cops took my statement (which of course carefully omits the part where my monster of a cat ate the bad guy) and I had to spend a few days at a hotel while they dusted, took photos and processed the crime scene. 



Despite finding blood and bone fragments they could not identify the assailant by his DNA alone. However, there had been break-ins and assaults in the neighborhood recently. The police also believed this man had been going around stealing but may have decided to, as they put it, “escalate the thrill”. They believed he may have got inside via my open window and had sneaked under my bed to wait. What they figure is he may have got injured in my house somehow and fled looking for medical attention. However, they had not been able to find any record of him at hospitals. For a short time, the police insisted on leaving a police detail by my house in case he returned. But after a few weeks of no leads and no more home invasions, they began to doubt he’d ever come back.



It’s been a month since that horrible evening and I’m sitting browsing the web with Casper. “What about this one?” I say to him pointing at the mug shot of a scrawny man with oversized glasses and a comb-over. “No. No, he’s too innocent. Must be evil. Very evil tastes better. Evil satisfies longer.” I sighed.  Since Casper had devoured that intruder he no longer ate his cat food at all. Instead he would beg for me to look for people he could – *play with*. At first, I refused. But then he reminded me about the presents he could give me if I helped him. That’s when I noticed I had been losing weight. My eyesight was improving. I found scars I’d had for years miraculously beginning to fade.

That’s when I knew. 



This was all real. 



Casper was no cat of course. He reminded me more of a mythical creature like a sphinx or a witch’s familiar. What I knew for sure was that he was now my friend and protector. All he asked for in return was a good meal every now and then. Also, there are plenty of people out there who are horrible and hurt others. Why shouldn’t we get rid of them? I’m actually doing the world a favor by doing this. And if I profit from it so what? Casper meowed loudly, that same warm meow that filled me with pleasure. Like a drug. 



“There. That one” I hear those foreign feline thoughts invade my mind. The sibilance like nails on a chalk board. My cursor hovers over the photo of a rather normal looking man with a buzz cut and dark brown eyes. “Mario Davenport”, I say aloud, reading his file. After a minute I close the publicly available database of child sex offenders, “Looks like we will be paying you a visit soon”.
