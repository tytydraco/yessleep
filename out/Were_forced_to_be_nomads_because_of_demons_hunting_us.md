My name's Pip. My wife, Ryn, and I live full-time in an old RV that's seen better decades. It's a massive, lumbering beast, the kind of vehicle that groans around corners and makes parking anywhere feel like a boss fight. Still, it's home; noisy, temperamental, but oddly comforting.

Best part? It keeps us mobile. Before we had the RV, we tried living out of our car. That didn't last. The RV may be finicky, but at least it gives us room to breathe, and a place to stretch out comfortably. We usually manage to stay in a place for two, maybe three weeks before things start getting complicated. People notice. The air shifts. It's hard to explain, but we've learned not to push our luck.

It's not just us we have to keep safe. We travel with four dogs, each with their own quirks. Nova is our sweet old labrador-terrier mix, slow and half blind but quick to sense danger. Kyra's a husky-wolf mix with an intense blue stare who loves everyone she meets. Aura, our pomeranian-husky mix, has heterochromia and nary a braincell to be found. And then there's Hela (yes, named after the Marvel goddess) a sharp-minded doberman who takes guarding the RV more seriously than most security systems.

One of the questions we hear the most is, "Why do you have so many dogs if you're always on the road?" And honestly, it's a fair one. Most people struggle with the nomadic life on their own. Throw four dogs into the mix, and it sounds like chaos. But there's a reason behind every pawprint.

Nova's been with me since she was a puppy. She's not just a pet, she's my retired service dog, my shadow, my anchor. These days she's almost sixteen and slower to get around, but she still insists on being wherever I am. Ryn's had Kyra since birth. At nine, Kyra's entering her elder years too, but she's still sharp and enjoys long walks.

Aura came along after we got the RV, back in 2022; a scrappy little furball with a big attitude. Hela joined the pack the following year. We took her in with the hope of training her to take over for Nova one day. She's got the brains for it (maybe too many brains, honestly) and a natural instinct for guarding.

We know traveling with dogs isn't easy, and we never take it lightly. Our pups are healthy, vaccinated, and absolutely spoiled rotten. They're protected too, not just physically, but spiritually. The wards we've placed keep the demons from touching them.

It's usually Hela who alerts us when something's wrong. She's fearless about things most dogs would avoid. The supernatural doesn't faze her. Balloons and vacuum cleaners? Those are another story entirely. But when the demons show up, Hela is the first to react. Last time it happened, one of them appeared right outside our bedroom window in the dead of night. Hela launched herself at the screen and tore it to pieces trying to get to him.

We know the names of the demons that follow us. They told us, whispered like rot slipping inside our skulls. But we don't say them. Not ever.

Names carry weight, and theirs carry consequence. Even the nicknames we use privately are too close for comfort. Just sharing all of this is a big risk. There's a thin line between silence and survival, and I'm treading it carefully.

So for your sake and ours, please don't try to figure out who they are. For simplicity, I'll call mine Blue, and the one that follows Ryn, Yellow.

I first encountered Blue in one of the worst ways imaginable; a moment that would scar anyone, let alone an eight-year-old.

I was in the shower, rinsing shampoo from my hair, when a heavy sense of dread settled over me. Something felt off.

I turned around, and he was there. Peering around the edge of the shower curtain, grinning.

His skin was dark gray-blue color, rough and uneven. Two dark, spiraled horns jutted from his skull. His eyes were the color of fresh blood. And his mouth... his mouth was the worst part. Full of jagged, sharp teeth, twisted into a predatory smile. The image is forever seared into my brain.

Naturally, I screamed my lungs out. My mom rushed in, wrapped me in a towel, and held me in her lap while I shook and sobbed.

I wasn't a timid kid. I played with snakes and spiders, and looked forward to Halloween more than my birthday. I used to imagine werewolves living under my bed, not to scare me, but to protect me. Monsters had always felt more like friends, until I met a real one.

That's how my mom knew something was really wrong. I wasn't the type to invent stories, especially not ones that left me shaking and speechless.

I'm lucky. She believed me.

A lot of parents unfairly dismiss their kids' fears outright. Mine didn't. And I think that saved me more than once.

The incident left me deeply traumatized. For months afterward, I couldn't shower alone. My mom had to sit in the bathroom while I washed, so I could be sure the demon wouldn't sneak up on me.

She told me that demons couldn't stand holy things, like how vampires hated garlic or sunlight. So I started sleeping with a Bible tucked beside me, hoping it would keep "Blue Face" away.

I really wish that had worked.

But these things don't play by the old rules. They're ancient and older than the stories.

I didn't see him face to face again for a long time, but he never left. Instead, he sank into the shadows around me and poisoned everyone I loved.

He never touched anyone else, not directly. But when I was near, something in them twisted. My parents began to fight constantly. The house filled with tension, then hatred, and finally silence. They divorced soon after. Both sides of the family were cruel in different ways. I was the scapegoat. The misfit. The easy target. My aunt Sharon even tried to kill me a couple of times, and it was lucky that my premonitions warned me.

At school, it wasn't any better. Students tormented me. Teachers turned cold and I was repeatedly in trouble. It wasn't just bullying. It was like something invisible about me made people recoil. Like they could sense I was different, and not in a good way. I felt cursed.

I wasn't a bad kid. Neurodivergent, sure. Quiet. Weird. But I followed the rules. I respected adults. I tried. And still, I was hated and punished.

One of the few who didn't treat me like a problem was my cousin Tommy. He was kind to me, protective, even. My best friend.

But then his dad, my uncle, snapped. He shot Tommy and then himself.

After that, I stopped letting people get so close. I had some other cousins I was and still am fond of; especially Jo, Logan and Nyx. But I was afraid they would eventually grow tired of me, or that something would happen to them.

So I surrounded myself with animals instead. I begged my mom to let me have more and more pets, until my room was practically a miniature zoo.

My animals didn't judge me. They didn't change when Blue was near, and they were the only place I felt safe.

Ryn had a much earlier start with Yellow than I did with Blue, although I now realize we were both inundated with them around the same time. She's just a few years younger than me.

Her mom was extremely neglectful and emotionally abusive. Ryn has always had the gift (though she'd correct me and call it a curse) to see ghosts and other entities with crystal clarity. As a child, she often struggled to tell whether someone was alive or dead unless they had visible trauma. That's how clearly she sees them.

Ryn has also always had insomnia (the complete opposite of my narcolepsy), so being awake very late was just part of her normal routine. At the time, her toddler bed was tucked behind the couch in the living room. The apartment she shared with her mom and adoptive dad was a cramped one-bedroom, one-bath, so she didn't have a room of her own. She was about three years old, trying to fall asleep, softly whispering to her giant stuffed panda bear. She'd made a little bed for it out of legos, lovingly placed beside her own.

At some point during the night, she watched, utterly fascinated, as a strange blue orb of light materialized above her and floated into the panda. She lay there, confused, wondering if she was dreaming, until the panda abruptly animated and began to violently kick her. Terrified, she ran to her parents' bedroom... only to realize neither of them were home. Sadly, this wasn't uncommon.

With no other options, she fled to the bathroom to hide. Everything seemed calm at first, until the same eerie blue orb appeared again, hovering above the bathtub. This time, it zipped straight down into the drain.

Frozen, hyperventilating, she watched in horror as something nightmarish began crawling out of the tub drain. She remembers it looked like a soaking-wet clown, but most of the other details are muddled by fear and time. Ryn was so scared that she suffered a severe asthma attack and passed out.

When her mom returned the next morning, Ryn tried to explain what had happened. Unlike my mom, Ryn's mother didn't believe her. She screamed at her for "lying" and "acting out for attention". But in a rare moment of compassion, her adoptive dad sat her down later that day and explained what it all meant. He told her that she had a gift, a way of seeing beyond the ordinary, and that dark things had already taken notice. He warned her to be careful what she interacted with, or she could end up in real danger.

To help her start navigating it, he took her to a haunted doll museum, so she could begin learning the differences between the living and the dead. There, she saw and spoke with two ghost children, her first friendly encounter. But to this day, she still doesn't trust dolls. And clowns? Those remain a full-blown phobia.

The next time she saw the blue orb, she was six years old. This time, it led to something much worse. Ryn fell into a pool and drowned, technically. She was completely unresponsive, not breathing, for over ten minutes. Everyone said it was a miracle she survived, and honestly, it was. But it wasn't without a price. She came back with an intense fear of water - anything deep enough to drown in became a trigger. To this day, she avoids it whenever she can, the same way that showers still make me nervous.

Ryn saw Yellow's actual face for the first time when she was seven. She and a friend were playing hide-and-seek in her new apartment. Ryn went to hide in the walk-in closet, and that's when she appeared. Those gleaming, yellow, animalistic eyes cut right through the darkness like teeth. That's the detail Ryn remembers the clearest. Not the rest of her face. Just the eyes. They're still a regular feature of her nightmares.

Yellow held her there, trapped in that closet for hours. Her so-called friend wasn't even looking for her. She just sat on the couch watching cartoons. No one came for Ryn until her mom got home late that night and found her, shaken and sobbing, still inside the closet.

It didn't stop there. Barely a week later, Yellow shoved Ryn down a flight of concrete steps. The fall left her with a scar running down her spine, a permanent reminder of just how real Yellow is.

After the next move, Yellow changed tactics. She began to mess with Ryn's life more subtly, but no less cruelly. Important items would vanish and turn up in strange places, if they ever turned up at all. Things Ryn knew she hadn't touched. Her mom thought she was just being careless and would scold her. Worse, people started accusing Ryn of stealing. It was humiliating and isolating.

Then Yellow began mimicking her. Not just her voice or movements, but her actual appearance. At first glance, you might think it was Ryn standing there... until you noticed the twisted, unnatural grin or the hateful yellow eyes. Unlike Blue, Yellow doesn't care if she is seen. She wants to be seen. Numerous people over the years have caught glimpses of her and were deeply unsettled.

Meanwhile, Blue was becoming more aggressive.

In my teenage years, he stopped lurking and started attacking. I was shoved off of furniture, scratched, bitten, struck in the face, and more than once, pushed from dangerous heights. I'm more durable than an ordinary human, but I stopped keeping pets after a while. As each beloved animal passed from old age, I couldn't bear to replace them. I was terrified Blue might start hurting them, too.

The only real peace ever came after moving. Every time my mom and I relocated, things would quiet down for a bit. That sliver of calm gave me the courage to get my first dog, Nova. Nova is sweet, loyal, and quickly proved herself an incredible warning system. Whenever something was off, she knew. Unfortunately, she was also terrified. When Blue came close, she'd try to wedge herself inside my hoodie to hide.

Then came the worst escalation yet.

After another move, this time across state lines to live with my mom and her boyfriend, Jim, things were peaceful for a while. Almost too peaceful, until Blue found us again. And he was livid. For the first time, he didn't just lash out at me. He possessed Jim.

It was horrifying. Jim went from perfectly normal to a murderous monster over the course of a day, baseball bat in hand, trying to kill both me and my mom. He was a massive man and used to work as a bouncer. There was no way we could physically fight him off. Instead, my mom tricked him into going outside and then locked him out. The next morning, Jim had no memory of what happened. None. He was confused, disoriented, and a little scared himself.

They broke up, and Jim went on to become some kind of traveling preacher, while me and my mom went back to scraping by and surviving however we could. But we learned something important: if we kept moving, Blue struggled to keep up. He was slower to find us. It wasn't a solution but it bought us time.

Yellow mirrored Blue in making people mistreat Ryn the same way they did to me. Her adoptive dad, who she believed was her real dad, started physically abusing and assaulting her. Ryn's mom didn't believe her and continued sending her over to him. She ran away once, and her mom didn't even notice she was gone. But despite the horror Yellow inflicted, Ryn found an ally in the most unexpected way. She was supposed to have had a twin brother, but he was absorbed in the womb. That can happen sometimes. That twin, Dannie, lives on inside her, and eventually, she was able to start communicating with him. He has a clear personality of his own, and they learned how to share bodily control.

Dannie became one of Ryn's greatest comforts. Anytime she needed a break from abuse or had to do something overwhelming (like swim), he'd take over. Unlike Ryn, Dannie loves the water. The only thing he's afraid of are spiders, which Ryn and I love, much to his dismay.

Ryn and I met on an online forum on Valentine's Day, 2017. It was ironic. We were immediately drawn to each other in a way neither of us had ever felt before. We were shocked by how much we had in common; real horror, genuine monsters, lives shaped by things most people wouldn't believe. We had a lot of rare abilities in common. It felt like fate.

She moved in with me and my family in August 2018, on my birthday, no less. (Best birthday gift I've ever gotten.) At first, it seemed like Blue and Yellow were going to be (im)mortal enemies. Honestly, we were delighted about that. We watched them become consumed with fighting each other, and for a while, they left us alone.

That didn't last long.

We were dismayed, though not particularly surprised when they eventually resolved their differences and teamed up. They still bicker like an old married couple, but now they work together. Yellow even appeared to my mom once, who mistook her for Ryn. When we explained that Ryn has a demon too... well, my mom started making plans for us all to move again. Blue and Yellow were both tormenting my grandma, and her health was starting to decline rapidly. We were afraid the demons were going to kill her.

The first place Ryn, my mom, and I moved into had the ghost of a young woman who'd recently died there. She wasn't hostile, just... sad. But within weeks, Blue and Yellow caught up to us.

Bye-bye, ghost.

Separately, they were bad enough. Together, they were absolutely menacing. My mom's health went into a tailspin. She ended up in the hospital, and it became clear that we had to split off. Ryn and I set out on our own, taking Kyra and Nova with us. After we left... both my mom and grandma made full recoveries.

Ryn and I moved several more times after that, only ever getting a few weeks of peace at a time. It was like Blue and Yellow were getting smarter, and working together to track us down faster each time.

In 2019, we made our biggest leap yet, from the thick humidity of the Florida panhandle to the dry, high-altitude dust of Wyoming's Wind River. For a while, it worked. Several whole months passed without incident, which was longer than either of them had ever taken to find us. We placed powerful protective wards around our new house, and it slowed them down further. But they retaliated in turn by targeting us at our jobs instead.

Ryn got shoved headfirst into a bucket of mop water at work and had a nasty reaction to the chemicals. I was partly shoved into a bubbling fry vat, hot oil licking the edge of my arm. Ryn almost got arrested when Yellow disappeared a bunch of cash out of her register till. Blue caused me to get a concussion. We lost multiple jobs, and even more friends, thanks to their antics.

On Ryn's final shift at one of those jobs, Blue tore open a literal portal in the back room, and a whole horde of demons came spilling out. One of them looked like a grotesque, malformed werewolf. Her coworker saw it. They evacuated the store and shut down early. We still don't know what that was all about. And frankly, we're not sure we want to.

After that, we left Wyoming entirely. We lived out of our car in Colorado through the dead of winter, nearly freezing our butts off. In 2022, we managed to get the RV. It's not perfect, but it's ours. We've traveled all over the country, but nowadays we float somewhere in the Rockies of Colorado.

We have a rule now, one we follow to the letter. We never stay in the same spot for more than two, maybe three weeks at most. The first signs that Blue and Yellow are catching up are always the same: a string of accidents that shouldn't be possible, one after another, getting worse until they finally show themselves. We've warded both the RV and our SUV against them, so they can't enter them, but that hasn't stopped them from wreaking havoc around us in other ways. We've lost seven generators and had to start warding those, too.

Still, we've fallen in love with the spot we're hiding in now. The mountain air is cool and crisp, even in the height of summer. The altitude makes everything feel lighter, quieter, almost like we belong here. I wish we could buy land somewhere nearby and finally settle down. We're getting so tired of always running.

We're nearing our time limit again. Hela has been restless at night, growling low and constant, unable to fully relax. Unfortunately, we can't move the RV right now. The only road out is buried under deep, soggy mud puddles that the RV can't safely traverse with its old tires. And at night... we've started to hear scratching along the sides and roof of the RV.

I really, really hate demons.
