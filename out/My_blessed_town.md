They say our town is blessed. Roses climb the fence, bread swells in every oven. Once a year Jubilee Jack arrives with bunting filled pockets, candy-bright shoes, and a pennywhistle. Children get peppermint drops. He bows. Luck follows.

This year he turns down our lane.

Father rests a hand on Davie’s hair. “It won’t be us,” he says, as if words could lock doors. Jubilee Jack taps his lollipop cane on the rail and sings our name into a rhyme.

Inside, he asks for a game. “Show-and-tell,” he chirps. The cane unscrews, beneath the lacquer glitters a steel hook. He flips his coat. The lining is butcher’s canvas, stitched with loops. A thin knife slips free.

The house convulses. Plates leap from shelves. The walls bow as if a giant breath presses them in. The hook touches Father’s chest and the sound is wrong… branch under wet snow. He crumples. Jubilee Jack sets a heel to his throat until it stills. Davie runs. Ribbon curls bite his ankles, he drops screaming. His head meets the post with a hollow melon sound. Blood threads the stairs like streamers in the rain.

“Last move is yours,” Jubilee Jack says, offering me the knife, smiling wide, the child under the paint showing. “Winner tags me out.”

I want to open him like he opened us. I want to pour him on the floor and spell Davie’s name in it. Heat climbs my arm, the handle hums with my pulse. He rams the edge under his own jaw, “Do it!” he screams, spit on my cheek. “Cut! Kill! Slice! Maim!” He drags my hand, the knife bites.

I breathe, like I taught dear Davie. I remember a swallow in my palms, its heart wild, the ache not to crush it. Mercy isn’t softness, it’s refusal to copy pain. If I cut him, I keep him. If I spare him, I end him.

I let the knife fall. “No.”

His grin gutters. He looks five and frightened of slammed doors. He presses his forehead to mine. “You’re it,” he whispers. Then he vanishes between heartbeats. The house loosens, the sugar-taste leaves the air.

Baskets pile at my door, their eyes lowered in gratitude. The mayor sets a velvet box in my hands: a black iron handbell, hairline-cracked. “Founders’ law, mercy earns choice. Toll once, and Jubilee Jack is gone forever.” His mouth tightens. “Toll twice, and some unspoken disaster strikes the town. Rumors say the ringer inherits Jack’s terrible powers.”

Only then I see the glasshouse: sermons on mercy, prizes for yielding, teachers praising silence over rage, Father’s fixed smile. I was the town’s lamb, dressed in mercy, slaughtered for their peace.

I stand in the square with the bell. My choice: forgive the hands that set me on the altar and toll once to keep him gone, or toll twice and pull the world down and wear his power like a crown of thorns.

I raise the bell. The town holds its breath. My breath gathers, fire seething under my ribs.
