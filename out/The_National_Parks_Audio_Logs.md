Audio Log #4: Day 4, July 11th, 2003

*\*"Hey Guys, I just noticed I forgot to log yesterday, but only because I saw something in the woods yesterday. I don't know how to explain it, and it's been driving me insane, It didn't look like a human or an animal, if that makes any sense, it had unaturally long limbs, and it was unhumanly pale. Without hesitation, I ran back to my campsite, and I think I understand why I'm the only person whos camping here. I'm leaving first thing tommorow, wether it was my imagination or not"\**

These Audio logs belong to \[REDACTED\] who was reported missing 2 days after the day \[REDACTED\] was supposed to return home, upon investgating their camp, the Federal Bureau Of Investigation found a tape recorder, pieces of shredded clothing, and streaks of blood on \[REDACTED'S\] Tent. There was no body to be found

The Victims family was told that \[REDACTED\] was attacked by an animal, to attempt to spare some greif, and \[REDACTED\] National Park was shut down due to "Wild animal attacks", The victims family does not believe the story, since they claim that we should have at least found bones.

The supposed "thing" that killed \[REDACTED\] has yet to be identified. But FBI investigators are considering the possibilty of a supernatural creature known as the Wendigo, that is native to these areas.
