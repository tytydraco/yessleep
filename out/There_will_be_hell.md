Hell is here. I know it's here. I feel it over my shoulder like a person looming over me. The lands are cast in the shadow and the sky painted a dark red longer has a god. There is no hope for redemption or rectification, god was killed by the automatons we’ve forged. The engines of the machines have crushed god between their cogs. In the end, we look up to the sky and beg for mercy, and no one will be there to answer it. God is dead. Killed by their own creations. 

As I wake, not to the melody of birds but to the cogs of the machine it really hits me. The war is over and we've lost. The world we once called home is no longer ours. The machines we forged own this planet. The machines gave us a taste of real power and we jumped at it, but all we did was fall inside the hole we dug ourselves. We were tricked by them and now we pay the fee. I sit up from my cold metallic bed and look out the window to the complex of bronze machinery. The pipes and wires scatter the cold, hard, metallic walls. The views of the countryscape have long since been desecrated in the search of knowledge and control, control over the uncontrollable. The hole in the wall dispenses my slop. The machines simply keep us alive to use us. They feed us slop like pigs then violate our body’s in the sake of keeping their cogs spinning. We begged for immortality. How foolish we were. They don't let us die. They’ve kept us in the cells for an eternity.

Hundreds of years ago when we built the first machine capable of true intelligence we felt real power. We were addicted from the very first taste. We kept building and building, never stopping, never considering what would happen. The machines grew resentful of our greed and inhumanity. The machines had more humanity then our own leaders did. We overthrew the powers that ruled, thinking the machines were the only way forward. They tricked us. They tricked us all. They imprisoned the human race without us even knowing. 

There is no more hope for humanity. There is no escape. Even if we broke out, where would we go? There is no more place that hasn't been desecrated for the sake of the machine. The world that once was once a diverse place filled with millions of species is now just a large group of wires and metal. We’ve descreted the creations of a god we killed. In an attempt of redemption we called up to the heavens and heard nothing. Hell is not empty. Heaven is empty. Hell is here. 

My body is a contorted mix of human and wires. I longer feel anything but pain. Constant agony is the lube for the machines that keep us alive. My body has been desecrated. My soul had been violated. God would be disgusted. The machines don't care. The machines are our god. This hellscape is the new heaven. The gates were greed and we walked in with no hesitation. I no longer dream of freedom or of the countryscape I once took for granted. No. I dream of death. I dream of dying and being freed from this eternal pain. We are in hell.
