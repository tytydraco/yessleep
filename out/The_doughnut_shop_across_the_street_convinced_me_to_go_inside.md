The first person to ever confess their love probably didn't understand their feelings.

Yet somehow, they conveyed the thoughts in their head. Love pushed through, and found a way to show itself. There are beautiful things in the world if you look for them.

You just have to look hard.

Maybe a little too hard.

Because maybe there isn't really enough beauty in the world.

[I've been staring at the doughnut shop all morning, wondering whether to go through with my plan.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/11g6swf/the_doughnut_shop_across_the_street_wants_me_to/) I kept convincing myself that entering at 1:00pm would be safe, but then I kept considering how everyone seems to ignore her. I wondered if everyone would also turn a blind eye to her killing me. Even if they noticed, what could somebody even do to stop it?

The time hit 1:00pm. I think deep down I had hoped something would happen in the time leading up, but nothing changed. As I approached Doughnut Be Alarmed, Lucia was still there, crying. Every step I took went against every rational thought in my mind, but my heart pulled me forward. Seeing the woman I love crying like this, illusion or not, it hurt me.

I pushed open the glass door. I was now closer to her than ever before. She didn't pay me any notice yet, she still sat staring through the window. For the first time, I could hear her sobbing, as the smell of doughnuts filled the air. I froze for a moment, but only a moment. Then, I approached the counter. It was busy and noisy inside, but the sounds of her cries still cut through it all.

"Could I get the Peanut Butter Delight, please?"

As he picked out my order and placed it in a small paper bag, I looked over my shoulder. Seeing her from behind meant I could now see her reflection, and it looked exactly like the real Lucia - Everything was flipped to be normal.

"Sir? Hello?"

"Oh, sorry."

I didn't need him to repeat the price, I had gotten this same order enough times before. I gave him the money and took my doughnut.

"Hey, how long has she been here?", I asked despite knowing the answer.

"Who?"

"Her, in the window."

"What do you mean? Someone outside the window?" He looked confused. He clearly could not see her.

"No, there's someone sat -- Nevermind."

I started to head out. It felt like a miracle I hadn't been killed, and I had all but confirmed my insanity. Nobody can see her, why would she be real? But as I pulled the door open, a whisper through the air seemed to pause me.

"Please, don't go."

She was looking right at me, our gazes locked. Hearing her voice again was beautiful. It's difficult to describe exactly how I felt at that moment. There's so much I wanted to say, but I couldn't find the words. Yet somehow, I managed to convey the thoughts in my head. I pushed through, and I summed up everything I wanted to say in as few words as possible...

"I'm here."

Her tears stopped, though she didn't look any happier. She looked broken, confused, and emotionally in pain. She spoke slowly, as if she didn't quite know her next words.

"What's happening to me?"

"I don't know, Lucia. I was hoping you could tell me."

I turned slightly and made eye contact with the owner at the counter. He looked concerned for me, although he immediately looked away when I noticed him.

"Lucia, come with me," I said, trying to get out of there so I didn't look crazy.

She got up, still holding her hot chocolate. It was dripping and mouldy. We walked across the street and I let her into my place. I know that sounds like a stupid decision, inviting her into my home, but she seemed innocent. She was scared - More scared than I was.

She wouldn't seem to let go of her hot chocolate, even as she sat down in her favourite spot. She tried to do a fake smile, the type you do after a long cry, to tell your body that it's over.

"I'm not Lucia, am I?"

I chose my words carefully. "I don't think so."

"What am I, then?"

"Well, what do you last remember?"

She thought for a moment. I don't know what was going through her head, but she really seemed to be really trying to focus. It was as if she was trying to pluck from a branch of memories that was just out of reach.

"I remember you. I remember us. I remember the things I love, and the things I do not. But I do not remember where I was before the doughnut shop."

Curiously, I asked, "Why did you stay there for so long?"

"Was it really that long? I just stayed for as long as I needed to."

"What about the other people? Why did nobody notice you?"

"Because I didn't want them to. Isn't that normal?"

I contemplated my choices here. I was sat with something that didn't even know what it was, and was only raising my questions with every answer it gave. I did ask one more thing, though.

"Did you post the leaflet for free food?"

"I didn't post anything. Whatever you saw, it wasn't real. It was because I wanted you to come visit me. I'm glad that you did."

Okay, this thing can cause hallucinations based on its own wants and needs? That's possible, apparently. I should stress that before all of this happened, I had no belief in any form of paranormal events. Now, I don't know what to believe. Whilst I was sat with her, a notification came through on my phone. Lucia, the real Lucia, had posted more photos of her holiday. I considered whether it would be wise to show her a picture of what was happening, but I don't know if that would help, or what it would entail.

I thought of ways I could cheer her up. "Do you want me to get you a doughnut?"

For the first time, she looked slightly happy. She wore a genuine, warm smile, although sadness still filled her eyes. "That would be nice. Thank you."

I didn't need to ask what she wanted. I know Lucia's favourites. I walked across the street alone and entered. The owner was cleaning up a hot chocolate spill where Lucia had been sat. It seems the hot chocolate was real, but nobody could notice it until she had left. I was going to stand at the back of the line, but there were 5 people ahead of me, and nobody could be served until the owner was back at the counter. I used that time to go to the bathroom.

Walking in, I only got halfway to the cubicles before I noticed something terrifying out of the corner of my eye. My reflection in the mirror was looking right at me. This was the third time in one day that something had stopped me dead in my tracks - Too common for comfort. I tried to act casual, as if I didn't notice. But the truth is that I was beyond scared, and I couldn't help but turn my head and look.

He smiled. No, he grinned. A sinister grin, one I didn't even know my face could do. I felt my lips to confirm that I was not doing such a thing. But when his hands didn't reach to feel his lips, I knew that this was not my reflection.

He stepped towards the mirror. Once he put one foot up on the counter and started to climb through, I ran. I ran faster than I probably ever have. I don't know what anyone thought as I ran through the main area of the shop, but I also don't care what anyone thought. Once home, I yelled at Lucia.

"Get the fuck out of my house."

She started crying again, choking on her tears as she tried to get words out, "What, why? What happened?"

I wasn't having any of it. I got her outside, and locked her out. I did not trust her anymore. She has been stood at my door sobbing ever since, and I can hear her anywhere I stand in my house.

I kept an eye on Doughnut Be Alarmed. There was no sign of a commotion. I suppose nothing had followed me out. Then again, apparently these things can just stop people noticing them, so maybe something had followed me. The fact I was alive, though, told me I was probably alone in the house.

I got a notification shortly after kicking her out of my house. I thought it would be more holiday pictures, but it was not. I had a text from an unknown number.

"I think you've met one of the Reflected. Lucia might be our answer."
