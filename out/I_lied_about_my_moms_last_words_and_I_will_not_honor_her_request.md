I lingered beside the safety of the campfire, unsure whether to tell Tim, the volatile ex-boxer, that I’d found his wife’s wedding ring [half-buried in a spool of wet intestines](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/12pb6fw/my_mom_died_last_night_i_lied_to_everyone_about/). While I agonized over the decision, Nance scolded him for pushing her over before.

Rather than apologize, he said, “C’mon, I’ll bet Tammy’s still close by. She might be able to hear us.”

My pulse spiked. Too much noise would only lead whatever tore her apart to us.

I rushed over and grabbed him by the arm. “You can’t.”

“And why the hell not?” he snorted.

I hesitated. I mean, how sure even was I those were Tammy’s guts? Maybe she just uncovered the gore of some predator’s fresh kill and scrambled away so fast that she dropped her ring.

“I heard…*something*. A voice.”

“Yeah, no shit you heard a voice. The others are still out their moron.”

“No. This sounded more like…a child.”

The others exchanged looks of confusion, then Nancy stepped forward. “You know, Darren, foxes can sound weirdly human.”

Tim shook me off. “Tell you what, if any foxes come charging out and try to nibble your ankle, I’ll protect you. TAMMMMMYYYY!”

Heart slamming against my chest, I said, “There’s something out there Tim. Think about it—why hasn’t Ulrich made it back yet? Mom and Tammy, sure, maybe they got lost, but Ulrich? He's a regular Bear Grylls.”

The big guy shouted down all the different ways I begged him to listen, then poked me in the chest, hard, and said, “Drop it already. Final warning.”

That intimidating glare poured cold water over the idea of a confession. In the end, I settled for keeping Liz by the fire, my left-hand clinging to the blade, while Tim and Nance circled the campsite, calling and calling.

Much as I wanted to get out of that damn forest, we needed to keep our wits about us. Like Mom always said. If we’d gone charging off, the wooden maze would have chewed us up and spat us out.

Each time Tim yelled his wife’s name, a pang of guilt stabbed me in the gut. He deserved to know what I’d found.

What did all this mean for Mom? She disappeared along with Tammy, after all…

Just then, her stern voice came echoing through my mind. *Never mind ME, what about your sister?*

Right. My emotional breakdown needed to wait. Keeping Liz safe was my main priority.

Our best chance at survival, so far as I could see, was sticking with Ulrich’s original plan: wait until dawn, then go find the cabin.

While I foraged for twigs to keep the fire alive, an anxious Liz asked, “Did you *really* hear a kid?”

Unsure what to say, I stared at her. “It was probably my imagination. Try and get some sleep. I’ll listen for Mom.”

All night, my nerves jumped at every shivering branch or hooting owl. What could have been the source of those voices? Maybe whatever it was didn't *have* physical form. Maybe it was a phantom, and that feeling of getting watched was actually invisible fingers running down my neck.

When her voice grew hoarse, Nancy joined us by the campfire. From the probing questions she asked about what happened to me out there, I suspected she knew I wasn’t being entirely truthful.

Although I trusted her, there was a risk Tim might have overheard a confession, so I kept my answers vague.

At dawn, I said to all the weary faces, “Time to go. If Ulrich was gonna make it back, he’d be here already."

Tim snorted. “Yeah, he's such a genius he got us into this fucking mess in the first place.”

“Look, whether you believe me or not, we can’t sit here until we starve. We’re on our own.”

“Just can’t wait to abandon your poor mother, can you?” he said, voice dripping with disgust.

Nancy said, “Now hold on a sec, maybe Darren’s got a point. This might be our best shot at rescuing everybody.”

“Do you even know which way it is?” Tim asked.

“Ulrich marked the map.” I unfolded the chart and pointed out a red circle highlighting the cabin.

“And how the fuck do you plan on finding the way?”

“I was in scouts for three years. It’s not rocket science.” Secretly hoping he’d stick around, I said, “You can do whatever you want, but I’m getting the fuck out of here.”

After collapsing the tents, I cannibalized Ulrich’s pack for anything useful: compass, med kit, lighter fluid. What did Mom always say about being prepared? *Better to have it and not need it, than need it and not have it…*

“Nancy, Liz, let’s go,” I said, as I strapped the knife holster around my waist. Then the three of us set off.

Less than ten steps from the clearing, Tim shouted, “Wait.”

We faced him.

“…I’m coming too.”

Damn.

An uneven trail carried us along where the foliage thinned out. We moved in uncomfortable silence, the only sounds the small cries of tiny animals. I drove everybody forward at a brutal pace, never stopping except for whenever I consulted the map. From the way Tim side-eyed me tracing it with my finger, you could tell he had zero faith we’d even set off in the right direction.

There was a mountain range Southwest of the cabin. If we could just reach that, I’d have been able to work out our rough position. However, the suffocating canopy blocked out the horizon and—most of—the sky.

Two hours into our march Nancy released a jutting branch which whipped back and hit Tim square in the mouth.

“Watch it.” He gave her a stiff shove.

The American squared up to him, her forehead barely reaching his chest. “Who the hell do you think you’re pushing?”

I rushed between the quarrelling pair and settled the dispute, but five minutes later Nance stepped into a hidden ditch and instinctively grabbed hold of the closest thing in the vicinity: Tim’s arm. Cue another pointless argument.

The way the former boxing champ spat raw fury over the slightest inconvenience made my guilt about keeping the ring secret dissolve.

By the time I’d negotiated their fifth peace treaty, I was craving a cigarette. Badly. My thoughts drifted back to Mom—to how she’d always nagged me to quit. *What happens if those things kill you, Darren? You won’t be happy ‘til you’ve put me in the grave…*

At midday, rain started falling, soft and steady. Wet leaves rustled as water funnelled in rivulets all around us. I hoped the fast-moving streams might wash away our tracks, no disturbed soil, no debris. That way, it’d be much harder for any potential crazy cultists living out there to follow us.

Emerging from the far side of a dense thicket, Liz skidded in a slippery patch of mud. My hands shot out and caught her at the very last second. “You okay?”

Rather than shake me off, in defiant younger sister fashion, she mumbled a weak, “Thanks.”

Stray hairs lay plastered against her forehead in sweaty tangles, and her lower half had acquired a thick coating of dirt. None of us had slept a wink in over 24-hours, and the muscles in my legs had been twanging for the past half-mile.

I sighed. “Let’s take a five-minute break.”

“Soooo generous of you,” Tim replied in a snide tone, as he collapsed against a nearby boulder.

Already half-asleep, I leaned against the closest trunk. Just a quick pitstop, that’s all we needed….

“There it is again.” Nancy’s urgent voice startled me awake. “Maybe there’s a cell tower close by? Quick, check whether you can get signal.”

“What’s going on?” I asked, confused.

“We heard a phone,” Liz said.

I joined the others in waving their mobiles overhead. No luck.

There came a faint *brrring! brrriiiiiiing!* It sounded like one of those indestructible Nokia bricks.

“Maybe it’s a park ranger?” Tim said, already charging across a slope engulfed with patchy grass. “IS SOMEONE THERE?”

The sun, where I could see it, was already high. And we’d been traveling slow, painfully slow. Whatever clawed Tammy apart might have been hot on our tails.

But then again, the sooner help arrived, the better.

Standing waist-deep in the foliage, Tim said, “The phones gotta be around her somewhere. Everyone spread out.”

Together, we followed him into the grove.

As my hands combed over patchy scrub, another chill ran along my spine. Once again, I felt eyes crawl all over us, yet couldn’t see anything beyond the green, unbroken canopy.

An image of a predator lurking beneath the cover slid into my brain, all razor-sharp fangs and long claws. I hovered over Liz like a cloud, despite Tim grumbling about how we’d cover more ground by splitting up. "Aww, Darren likes playing 'hero' when it's little Lizzie needing protecting. Wish I saw this courage when finding Tammy was a priority."

Ten minutes blitzed past. Twenty. Eager to press on, I pointed out how long our shadows had gotten.

Tim said, “Just fucking wait. It might ring again.”

From further into the endless forest, there came another, *Brrring! Brrriiiiiiing!*

A sweep of the area turned up nothing except woodlice crawling over petrified logs. Nancy and Liz agreed we should leave, however, the second we started back another ring went up, barely audible beneath the wet weather.

A dry cramp seized my throat. First the voices, now this? It all felt too convenient.

I grabbed Liz’s arm. “We’re leaving.”

“What’s wrong?” Nancy asked.

“Ignore that idiot,” the chief mutineer answered. “Come help me look.”

That ‘idiot’ remark made my already stretched-out nerves snap. I faced him. “You know what Tim, if you wanna stay here crawling around on your hands and knees, be my guest. I’m sure you’ll find the phone just as fast as you found Tammy.”

That was a mistake. The big guy marched up to me, neck veins bulging. “Wanna say that again?”

It looked like he expected me to take a swing at him. Hell, not expected—hoped. One shot from those bear paws, though, and I’d have been down for the count.

The ladies rushed to pry us apart, then Nancy said, “He’s got a point, Tim. This is getting us nowhere.”

That cooled him off some. “Fine.”

The second our journey resumed, another *Brrring! Brrriiiiiiing!* went up, closer than before.

“I knew we should have fucking waited,” Tim hissed.

As he disappeared into the marsh, my blood pressure climbed back down. At least now we only had monsters to worry about…

You can imagine my disappointment when, on the far side of a cluster of trees, the walking powder keg came jogging after us.

“What’s the matter, couldn’t find anything?” Nancy asked. Rather than respond, Tim shouldered past her.

Ready to unleash her full fury, she clenched her jaw tight.

Quickly I cut in with, “Please. We’ve got enough problems.”

With the faintest of nods, she followed him along the trail.

The odds of their truce holding out until we found civilization seemed low. Nerves were running high, everybody was filthy and sweaty and exhausted, and there was a long way still to go.

The forest threw up wall after wall of dense thornbushes and scratching bracken, dragging us off course until the path thinned out again. Twilight crept along so subtly I didn’t notice until visibility became limited to thirty yards ahead. In another hour we’d be feeling our way around blind.

Breathing the damp air mist, I took one final look at the map. Then, just as I contemplated climbing a pine tree for a better view, a tremendous splintering of wood rang out.

“What the hell was that?” Liz asked, her frightened eyes scanning all around.

“There,” Nancy said. Even squinting where she pointed all I could see was endless, suffocating undergrowth.

“What is it?” Liz asked.

“Ulrich, I think.”

“You sure it wasn’t a bird?” Tim asked.

As though offended by the question, she answered, “I dunno, do many birds wear fluorescent raincoats?”

“You know what—”

“I don’t like this,” I said, cutting Tim off.

“You still worried about the spooky voices?” He rolled his eyes and stepped into the dense bushes. “ULRICH!”

I grabbed Liz by the arm. “We’re leaving.”

There was thirty yards between us and Tim when Nancy screamed, “EVERYBODY STOP.”

Making her voice all soft, she said, “Now Darren, I know you’re freaked out, but I think you’ll agree our chances of surviving this mess would be much better with Ulrich, correct?”

I gave a reluctant nod.

“And Tim, regardless of whether or not you *think* Darren heard something last night, we can’t just run around out here until it gets so dark we can’t see past the ends of our noses, agreed?”

“…Agreed.”

“Good. So let’s check this out together. And if we haven’t found anything in fifteen minutes, we move on. Liz, what do you think?”

Liz glanced at me, back to Nancy, and then nodded.

The heavily wooded area sloped downward, and you couldn’t take five steps in any one direction without encountering *another* barrier of interlocked branches. Beyond that first labyrinth, Liz spotted a touch of blue off in the distance.

Tim cupped his mouth. “ULRICH SHOUT IF YOU CAN HEAR US!”

For a moment, there was only a patter of steady rain.

"Is someone there?"

“Ulrich!” everybody except me shouted. Oh sure, our guide sounded far off, but there was no mistaking *that* accent. “C’mon,” Tim said, as he pushed back low limbs.

A black wave of terror stabbed me in the gut. I'd seen this trick already. The previous night I could have sworn I heard Tammy, right up until I found those intestines…

But still, we’d *seen* Ulrich. Or his jacket, at least. I kept Liz within arm’s length, following at a short distance.

The rain tapered off as we bullied our way towards the outer edge of a huge, downward sloping gulch.

Tim said, “SAY SOMETHING YOU STUPID GERMAN PRICK.”

For a moment, the endless forest only breathed at us.

“Hello?”

Our guide sounded close. The others exchanged looks of relief, half-crying half-laughing.

“This way,” Tim said, his lower half engulfed by the greenery.

As a harsh breeze slapped my sweaty pours, pangs of unease ran along my spine. My gut knew we were in danger, even though my conscious mind hadn’t worked out why yet.

The warren of wooden fangs, claws and stingers closed like a vice grip, pressing tighter and tighter as we zigzagged further into the giant bowl.

Far below us, beyond a barrier of wooden spikes, a figure stood in place, barely visible inside a circle of trees huddled close together.

Tim said, “C’mon, the branches are too thick here. We’ll go around.”

With every step, the forest creaked in its various joints. Any of those sounds might have been a deadly creature, ready to pounce.

On the far side of a nestle of ferns, our new leader paused. The spot where Ulrich had been standing slipped beyond the point where we could see.

“Okay,” I said. “It’s been fifteen minutes. Can we please—"

A familiar voice came tumbling out of the gloom. “Tim? Is that you!”

“TAMMY.” Tim screamed, his eyes welling up with tears. “IT’S ME, WHERE ARE YOU?”

Oh fuck. Oh fuck no.

“STOP,” I screamed, loud enough that birds vacated the premises. My companions glanced around.

I swallowed a gulp. “It’s a trap.”

Tim groaned. “Not this shit again—TAMMMMMMMYYYY.”

“That’s not her.”

Confused, Liz said, “If it’s not Tammy and Ulrich, who is it?”

“Of course it’s fucking her, your brothers just a moron. TAMMY, ULRICH.”

“Then why are they so close?” I asked, keeping my voice low. For all the good it would do. “We’re miles from the campsite.”

Still trouncing further into the thicket, Tim said to the ladies, “I’ll tell you why, because Marco Polo here’s been leading us in fucking circles. We’re probably right back where we started.”

I said, “Think about it. You heard Tammy crying and charged straight into a pit, that phone kept moving further away, now this?”

“Is someone there?” Ulrich’s voice issued from within the gulch. He sounded close. Real close. We were in danger.

I rushed over and grabbed Tim by the arm. “Quiet.”

“Piss off,” he snapped, swatting me aside. “TAMMY YELL IF YOU CAN HEAR ME.”

Mom’s voice echoed through my mind. *Grab your sister and run!* That would have been the smart move, alright. However, watching Tim trounce along, it occurred to me the poor guy was delirious with joy over the fact he’d found his wife. Was he an asshole? No question. But he was also a loving husband in a shitty position. I couldn’t let the big guy go charging off to his own doom.

"Is someone there?"

“I’M HERE, WHERE ARE YOU?”

I clenched my fists. Here went nothing. “Tim that can’t be Tammy…because Tammy’s dead.”

All eyes landed on me. Even Tim’s. “What the FUCK are you talking about?”

Time to lay my cards out along the table. “Last night, I found her wedding ring. It was buried in a pile of guts. There was blood everywhere. I didn’t say anything because…because I didn’t want anybody freaking out.”

Nancy stepped in close. “Darren, if that’s not Tammy, who is it?”

“I don’t know,” I said, fumbling for an explanation. “Maybe it’s this place. Or somebody with a voice recorder. All I know is, we need to get the fuck out of here.”

Before I could grab Liz, Tim stepped between us, fists clenched. “Interesting theory, Darren. Now here’s mine. I don’t think you *want* to find the others.”

“Why wouldn’t I want to find them?” I asked. My fingertips hovered over the knife. We didn’t have time for this. If we started fighting, we’d be even more vulnerable.

“I dunno. Maybe you and your mom had another argument and you couldn’t handle it, so you did something stupid. Hell, I bet Tam saw the whole thing and you chased her off. Probably did the same to Ulrich.”

Nancy stepped in close. “Tim, listen to yoursel—"

With a single shove, he sent her careening back. Then, in the blink of an eye, he grabbed the scruff of my coat and reeled me in close. “I think you made up this bullshit story to scare us into leaving the others behind. How about it, am I close?”

For a moment, the only sound was the harsh pump of blood inside my skull. Then, almost in unison, Tim and my hands both went for the knife. His handed clamped around mine, tight. “Planning to kill me too, Darren boy?” he said with a grin.

Unable to twist free from his grasp, I threw myself at his midsection. Down the slope we went, tumbling and bouncing against the irregular sides, my hands fumbling wildly for any exposed roots.

Nancy and Liz came charging after us, screaming, “STOP.”

Directly outside the dense tree circle, Tim and I scrambled to our feet and charged at one another in a flurry of punches and kicks.

A clean shot to the left temple made my knees buckle. Through the haze, all I could see was Tim’s grinning face.

As he leaned in close, one hand clamped tight around my windpipe, the words, “You’re a rat, Darren,” echoed along as if shouted from the end of a very long tunnel. Tim’s rear fist pulled back. I squeezed my eyes shut. And when the finishing blow never arrived, I peeked my left eye open.

Nearby, my aggressor spun around with Nancy on his back biting down on his left ear, hard. Round and round they went, her nails raking across his face, back and forth.

In one smooth motion, he flipped her onto the ground. She landed with a solid thwump, then Tim droved his booted foot into her ribs, twice. The choked rasp that slid up her throat sounded a million times worse than any smoker’s cough I ever heard.

From a side angle, Liz lashed at Tim, but one flail of his giant arm sent her toppling backwards. She fell against crisscrossed branches and slid to the ground, and as she did, a gloved hand flopped out from beneath the leaves.

That called an immediate truce to the confrontation. Fighting the constant spin inside my skull, I sat up.

My sister scrambled away from the spot in reverse. Then slowly, Tim stepped over a gasping Nancy, took the largest branch in hand, and bent it up.

Beneath the leaves, propped in a T-pose by two strong branches, was Ulrich. Our tour guide was dead, very dead, and covered in dry, sticky blood. There was a huge cavity in his chest, through which you could see exposed rib, cartilage, and glistening muscle, and the legs tapered off above the knees, trailing nerves endings and bone.

Oh fuck. I was right—it *was* a trap. The corpse had been placed there to lure us in.

Just then, branches shivered and shook as something moved throughout the canopy, remaining unseen.

Immediately Tim barrelled towards the slope while Liz lay there, eyes locked on the corpse.

Still seeing two of everything, I forced myself up and raced over and grabbed Nancy. “C’mon, up,” I said.

“I can’t,” she sputtered, between choked rasps.

As I lifted her by the wrists, bones and joints popped. She couldn’t stand unsupported, so I threw her arm over my shoulder.

At a dazed Liz, I shouted, “COME ON.”

Her head whipped between me and Ulrich for almost five seconds before she snapped out of her trance, then the three of us thrashed for the trail, climbing the hill as fast as we possibly could.

What felt like every branch in the vicinity gouged and raked all the exposed skin they could latch onto. Meanwhile, Tim never got more than a dozen or so steps ahead, because he kept hitting dead ends which forced him to double back, unintentionally charting the course.

Each time we reached a bump or a mound, Nancy grimaced, hard. It felt like she doubled in weight every ten seconds. My lungs and throat were on fire—*What did I say about those cigarettes, Darren?*—but if I stopped we were dead.

Beyond the labyrinth of dead ends lay the flat stretch of ground engulfed by wild undergrowth, so dense you couldn’t see your own feet. Tim barrelled along at top speed, and he’d put thirty yards between us and him when, out of nowhere, he disappeared beneath the ocean of leaves.

As a pained howl shot up, we ground to a halt.

That howl tapered off, as though Tim was getting ripped away by a bungee cord. He resurfaced, briefly, about forty yards to our right, his face lobster red and shiny with blood. He shrieked and pleaded, arms flailing wildly, before disappearing again.

Without uttering a single word, Nancy, Liz, and I charged the opposite direction.

We were in deep trouble. Any second now, whatever got Tim and the others might have come back for us, and we wouldn’t even have seen it coming. Nancy couldn’t stand by herself.

And what’s worse, we had less [than an hour of daylight left…](https://www.reddit.com/r/thoughtindustry/comments/te0fum/welcome_i_hope_you_enjoy_your_stay/)
