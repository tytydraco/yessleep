My older sister and I always try and find deals on hotels and trips. Spending time together is the only break I get from the busy life I get. 

I received a call from ny sister a few days ago. 

"I just found the best deal on a cabin on Lake Tahoe!"

Lake Tahoe was our dream vacation. We had talked about going there since we were teenagers. 

I smiled. "Book the cabin!" 

"And done," She excitedly said into the phone. I was pumped for our first trip of the summer. And at my dream location too.

The trek up the mountain to the cabin was tough. Due to the steep hill it was situated on, you had to hike up to the cabin. Rocks crumbled beneath my feet as we made the long ascent up the mountain. I perched onto a tree. Relaxing for a second, my calf cramping. 

"Damn," my sister said. Her breath shallow from the intense climbing. But the cabin was worth the hike. It was sleek and luxurious. Polished wood columns lined the front. Two massive windows gave a view of the porch. 

We entered. The smell of honey and pine greeted our noses. This cabin was really nice. It was also so cheap. 

I made it up the grand staircase that was at the front door. The elegant wood carvings on the banister told me that a lot of effort was put into this home.

After having had a fun day on the lake. My sister and I dreaded the hike back to the cabin. 

"I don't think it's worth it," she said. 

"Haven't you wanted to start exercising? Think of it like a workout," she punched my shoulder. I was a little rude, but it was in a good spirit. 

I opened the car door and began the drive back to the cabin parking lot.

The hike to the cabin had me even more exhausted than I was before. I pulled myself up the intricate staircase. Angry at how long it was now. I threw myself into bed, shoes on, and went to bed. 

***

I woke up to a pounding on the cabin door. The door was a heavy wooden door. With iron beams on it. There was no way someone could make that kind of noise on it. 

I exited my room to find my sister. She looked concerned as well. I made my way down the staircase. My legs hurting even more than ever.

I reached the door when a familiar voice filled my ears.

"Jake? Is that you?" My mother's voice called out. I gasped. Why was she here? 

I turned to face my sister, her jaw was on the floor too.

"Why are you up here?" I asked, knowing no one could do the hike in the dark. 

"I heard you guys were here and I had to join!" Her distinctive southern accent popped out as she said that.

"Just one more question," I replied.

"Sure, what is it sweetie?" She asked.

"How'd you get out of your coffin?"

Silence.

Does anyone know of any creatures that impersonate loved ones? I don't know what that was outside the door. My sister and I left the next morning. I did a lot of research on the way home, but nothing came up.
