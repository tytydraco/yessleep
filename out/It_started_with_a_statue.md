It started with the statue.

It wasn’t put there overnight. It couldn’t have been. But it was just there—suddenly, standing in the middle of the square, and no one could remember when it had arrived. No one could even remember who had placed it.

At first glance, it looked like any other sculpture—an oversized, vaguely human figure, twisted in a way that made you look twice. But something about it was off. The face was too sharp, the mouth too wide, frozen in a grotesque, unnatural expression, like it had been caught in the middle of something wrong. The body was vaguely human, but it didn’t sit quite right. A statue meant to be observed, to be watched.

People shrugged it off. A new art piece. A weird tourist attraction. Who knew? Who cared?

But not me. I could feel it. I always felt it—watching.

And then the disappearances started.

The first was a woman, a mother of two, who had been walking her dog near the square. She was reported missing two days after the statue showed up. They said she went for a walk and never came back. No trace.

Then a man, just a few days later. He’d been sitting on a bench by the statue, reading a newspaper. One minute he was there, the next minute—gone.

The police looked into it. Of course, they did. But there was nothing. No leads. Just questions.

At first, people wrote it off. People go missing. It happens all the time.

But then there was more.

A couple. A teenager. A small child. More pets, too. All missing without a trace, all last seen at least a couple days before the statue appeared.

The police are completely baffled. But the rumors were spreading faster than the disappearances. Some people said it was a serial killer. Others said something else. Something more... off 

Really no one knew.

I should’ve listened to my instincts.

But that day, I didn’t. I don’t know why. Maybe I thought I was being paranoid, overreacting. Maybe I thought the statue was just an eyesore, something I could ignore.

I was walking toward the square when I saw it again. The statue stood in the center, like it had always been there. But this time, something was different. It wasn’t just the look of it, or the way it stood. It was the presence—the air felt thick, like something was pressing against my skin.

I pulled out my phone and took a picture, a reflex, just like everyone else had been doing. The image came out fine, crisp and clear. But when I looked at it

Something was wrong.

I zoomed in on the photo. The statue’s face wasn’t just twisted anymore. The expression was sharper. The angles had changed, just slightly. The eyes were darker. More… alive. It was as if it was no longer a static object, but something that saw me. That knew I was looking at it.

My skin prickled. The photo didn’t lie.

I looked up, and there it was again—the statue, staring back at me. Not in the same way as before. Its mouth, barely visible in the photo, seemed to be open. Just a crack.

I shoved my phone back in my pocket, my hands shaking. I turned away, walking briskly out of the square. But the feeling—like I was being watched, like something was moving just out of sight—it didn’t fade, I have never felt a fear like it.

I felt as though I was followed all the way home.

••

That night I couldn’t stop thinking about it.

The photo. The way the statue’s expression had shifted. The way its eyes seemed to follow me.

I didn’t want to be afraid. I didn’t want to believe it, but every time I closed my eyes, I could still see it—the statue’s face, distorted, watching.

That night, I sat on my bed, scrolling through the photo again. Every time I looked at it, something felt different. The face. The way the mouth had widened, just enough to make the statue look like it was smiling—grinning—like it had been waiting for me.

I couldn’t take my eyes off it.

And then I heard it.

A sound. Soft at first, like a knock at the door. But the knock didn’t stop. It came again, then again, faster now, like something was trying to get in.

My heart raced. The knock was too rhythmic, too deliberate. I jumped up, heart slamming against my ribcage, and rushed to the door, but no one was there.

I closed the door, but the knocking continued, the sound growing louder, as though it was coming from inside the walls.

I swallowed hard.

What was happening?

I turned back to the photo. I needed to see it again.

The face.

It was worse now. The mouth was wide open, gaping. The eyes—empty. Hollow. I had to squint to see it, but it was there, unmistakable.

Something was in the reflection. Something behind me.

I whipped around.

Nothing.

But the feeling was there. The same crawling sensation on the back of my neck. The feeling that something was too close, too near. Watching.
