The ad was brief, almost dismissive in its lack of detail, but it caught my eye. “Remote observatory in the mountains. Full-time watchman needed. Must stay alone. No distractions.” I didn’t think much of it, but something about the offer felt… magnetic. It promised peace, seclusion, and a job that only a select few could claim. What else was I doing? I had no attachments, no family, and no plans for anything other than the quiet solitude that had started to swallow me.

I sent my application, though I doubted anyone would take me seriously. The next week, my phone rang. I didn’t know how to react as the voice on the other end told me I’d been selected for the role. The job was mine, effective immediately.

It was a remote location—so remote that I almost had to take a separate plane and a long, winding bus ride to reach the base of the mountain. A ranger in a faded uniform met me at the foot of the mountain. His eyes were sunken, his movements slow and deliberate, as though he were still waking up from a deep sleep that hadn’t quite finished.

“Ready to climb?” he asked without a smile.

I nodded, and he handed me a heavy pack full of supplies.

The hike up was more arduous than I imagined. The trail was narrow, winding through dense trees that seemed to choke the air. At times, the path would disappear entirely, and I had to rely on the occasional marker tied to the trees, all while the mountain air grew colder and thinner.

By the time we reached the top, the sun was dipping below the horizon, casting the world in hues of orange and purple. I saw it then—the observatory. It stood on the edge of a jagged cliff, like an old forgotten monument, bathed in a deepening twilight. Its tall, rusted spire reached into the sky as if it were trying to pull something down from above.

“Don’t mind the view,” the ranger muttered, sensing my awe. “It gets lonely out here. Trust me. Once you’re up, you won’t want to come down.”

I didn’t understand what he meant at the time. It wasn’t until later that I would.

The climb up the narrow metal staircase of the observatory tower felt like an eternity. The metal groaned under my weight, the sound piercing the evening air with each step. When I finally reached the top and stepped through the trapdoor, a wave of vertigo hit me—I was alone. The observatory was nothing like I imagined. It was cold, sterile, as though no one had stepped inside in ages. But there was something about it. An energy. A presence.

The ranger briefed me on the basics of the job—check the equipment, keep the telescope aligned, and maintain the logs. But he never mentioned what the real job would entail. What would come next.

As the ranger prepared to leave, I stood at the edge of the observation deck, staring out at the dense forest below. The wind was picking up, and something about the way the trees swayed made my skin prickle. I didn’t know why I felt it, but something wasn’t right.

The ranger climbed back down the stairs without a word, his footsteps gradually fading as he descended into the darkness. The isolation had begun, and it felt heavier than I expected. I could only hear the wind, the creaking of metal, and the far-off cry of an owl.

That’s when it happened.

A small, seemingly harmless envelope appeared on the desk beside me. I had no idea how it got there. Who left it? There was no one else up here. I hadn’t heard the trapdoor open, and there were no footsteps. The envelope was plain—no name, no address.

I felt my pulse quicken as I reached for it. Inside, I found a folded sheet of paper. The handwriting was bold, yet elegant. Almost… too neat.

The letter simply read:

The Rules of the Watch:
	1.	Never look out the east window between 2:00 and 3:00 AM.
	2.	Always keep the radio on. If the static increases, stay inside.
	3.	If you hear knocks on the glass at night, do not respond. They’re not human.
	4.	Do not, under any circumstances, gaze into the telescope after midnight.
	5.	If you hear the sound of footsteps outside the observatory, do not look at the door. Lock it, and hide.
	6.	Never, ever, step outside during a starlight eclipse.

I read the words several times. What did this mean? Who wrote this? And why? It didn’t feel like a typical job instruction manual. It felt… urgent. Important.

I didn’t know what to make of it, but a creeping sense of unease began to coil in my stomach. I folded the letter back up and tucked it into my pocket, unsure of what to think. But I couldn’t shake the feeling. Something was already watching.

Night fell quickly, the sky above slowly blanketing with stars, but as I sat by the telescope, preparing to begin my first night shift, I noticed something strange. The shadows around me felt deeper than they should have, and the air in the observatory seemed to grow colder with each passing minute.

Then, the radio crackled.

A voice, distant and muffled, emerged from the static. It was hard to make out at first, but then I could hear it clearly:

“Are you watching?”

I froze.

The voice wasn’t familiar.

I grabbed the radio, fingers trembling, and spoke into it: “Who is this?”

But all I received in return was static.

I stared at the radio, the hairs on the back of my neck standing on end.

I sat in the silence of the observatory, the faint hum of the radio the only sound in the air. My eyes never left the blinking light on the radio. “Are you watching?” The voice seemed to hang in the air, vibrating with an energy that felt wrong. It wasn’t a voice that belonged in the vast, empty space of this mountaintop.

My hand shook as I placed the radio down. I tried to swallow the knot that had formed in my throat, but it was hard to ignore the growing sense that something was shifting. The air felt charged, like a storm was about to break, though the sky was clear and the stars sparkled without interruption.

The radio crackled again, as though it was trying to say something more, but no words emerged. Just static. I hesitated before reaching for the dials, adjusting the frequency slightly, trying to find a clearer signal. But nothing—just the eerie hum that seemed to fill the room.

I glanced at the window. The east window.

The letter’s rule about never looking out of that window between 2:00 and 3:00 AM echoed in my mind, and I instinctively looked down at my watch. It was 1:58 AM.

Was that why the voice had spoken? Had it been waiting for me to break the rules? I felt an odd mix of dread and curiosity, each pulling at me. The window… I didn’t want to look, yet I couldn’t shake the urge to understand what might be out there.

Why the east window? What was it about that particular view that made it dangerous?

But my thoughts were interrupted. The radio crackled again, now clearer, but with a strange, hollow tone. It wasn’t static, but a whisper.

“Look.”

I froze. My heart thudded painfully in my chest.

Whoever—whatever—was on the other side of the radio, it was speaking directly to me now. I felt a cold sweat bead on my forehead.

Without thinking, I turned. My eyes were drawn to the east window, the one that had been off-limits. I slowly stepped toward it, the wooden floor creaking underfoot.

I hesitated, staring at the glass. The night outside was dark and silent. Nothing seemed to move. No wind rustled the trees. The mountains were a massive shadow against the deep sky. Yet, something felt off.

Suddenly, my watch buzzed, snapping me out of my trance. 2:00 AM.

I froze.

The moment I heard the soft chime, my heart skipped. Something was wrong. The rules… the rules.

I stepped back, my breath quickening. That voice on the radio—had it been a warning?

I glanced down at the manual again, the paper now feeling heavier in my hands. The words had burned themselves into my mind:

Never look out the east window between 2:00 and 3:00 AM.

The radio crackled once more, and I swallowed hard. The cold feeling in my stomach only intensified. A rush of fear gripped me, but my curiosity—the need to know what was happening—was stronger.

Before I could act, I heard something. A faint sound, almost like… footsteps. But not from the stairs. These steps were lighter, quieter, yet they echoed in the stillness of the tower. The floor creaked again, but this time, it wasn’t from me moving. It came from the corner of the room.

I spun, my pulse racing. The room was empty. I was alone, as I had been when I arrived.

Or so I thought.

The footsteps came again, closer this time.

I instinctively took a step backward, feeling the weight of the cold wooden walls behind me. I should have locked the door. I should have done something—anything—but instead, I stood there frozen. Listening. Watching.

The footsteps stopped.

For a split second, there was nothing but silence.

And then—a knock.

A single, soft knock.

It came from the east window. Not the door. Not the trapdoor.

The window.

I froze. My blood ran cold, and my mouth went dry.

The letter’s rule raced through my mind. If you hear knocks on the glass at night, do not respond. They’re not human.

I didn’t know who or what could be out there in the dark, tapping against the glass, but every fiber of my being screamed for me to look.

But I didn’t. I wouldn’t.

Instead, I took a slow, trembling step back. I glanced at the trapdoor. I had to leave. I had to leave right now.

But before I could move, the whisper returned, soft and hollow, as though it were coming from inside the very walls themselves:

“You’re not supposed to leave.”

The voice was barely audible, distorted by static, but it sent a shiver of fear down my spine. I didn’t understand. Why would it say that?

I rushed to grab the flare gun from the cupboard. I had seen it earlier—an old, rusted thing with emergency flares inside. I wasn’t sure how it worked, but the rules mentioned using it if things went wrong. And at this point, I knew things were beyond wrong.

The knock came again. Louder. More insistent.

Don’t look. Don’t look.

I didn’t dare open the window. I didn’t even want to get close to it. But I needed to act fast. My hands were shaking, and I fumbled with the flare gun, nearly dropping it in the panic that was rising within me.

The radio crackled once more, and a voice—familiar but distorted—spoke through the static.

“You know the rules.”

I took a deep breath, trying to steady myself. This wasn’t a coincidence.

I had broken the first rule already. The knock, the voice, the footsteps—they weren’t random. This place had something in store for me. Something I wasn’t supposed to know. Something far worse than I could possibly imagine.

But the window, the knock, the whispers—they were only the beginning.

The clock ticked closer to 3:00 AM.

The seconds ticked by with agonizing slowness, each one making my heart pound faster. 2:59 AM. The air felt charged, as if the observatory itself was holding its breath. I stood there, flare gun in hand, sweat dripping down my face. The knocking had stopped, but the silence was deafening.

I couldn’t move. I couldn’t breathe.

The east window stared back at me, mocking my hesitation. I could feel the pull of it, an invisible force drawing me in, just as it had before. The rules, the letter, the voice on the radio—they were all warning me, yet I couldn’t help but feel the insatiable need to know what was outside.

What was out there?

The radio crackled again, breaking the eerie stillness.

“You can’t avoid it.”

The voice was clearer this time, its tone colder, more final. I flinched, almost dropping the flare gun. I needed answers. I had to know what was happening.

My gaze darted toward the east window once more. Don’t look. The voice echoed in my mind, but I couldn’t stop myself. The curiosity had gripped me too tightly.

With trembling hands, I took a step forward. The world seemed to blur around me as my feet moved on their own. My heart raced in my chest, a deep, primal fear sinking in with every step. The cold glass of the window was within reach now. I stopped just before touching it.

Then, a new sound reached my ears—a soft, almost imperceptible hum. It was coming from the forest below. The sound grew louder, vibrating through the ground beneath me. It wasn’t the wind, and it wasn’t an animal. It was something else. Something unnatural.

I placed my palm on the glass.

The hum grew louder, the ground beneath me seeming to pulse with it. The forest—once silent—was now alive with whispers, as if the trees themselves were communicating.

A chill ran down my spine as I pressed my face against the cold window. Through the darkness, a faint, unnatural glow began to take shape on the horizon.

At first, I thought it was a trick of the light, but then the glow intensified, growing larger, approaching the tower.

A light. A soft, floating orb of blue, moving toward the observatory, steadily, silently.

I jerked away from the window, stumbling back into the center of the room. The rules had said to never look at it. The manual had been clear. But I had looked.

The radio crackled once more, the voice now sounding almost amused.

“It’s too late.”

I wanted to scream. To run. But my body betrayed me, frozen in place. I felt the weight of the orb’s presence outside, its light growing brighter by the second, until it filled the entire room with an otherworldly glow.

The air thickened, pressing against me, making it hard to breathe. I staggered, clutching the flare gun tighter, my hands slick with sweat. The orb was almost at the base of the tower now. What was it? What did it want?

“Cover your eyes.”

The command came in a voice so cold, so final, that my instincts kicked in before I could think. I closed my eyes tightly and counted. I didn’t know if I could trust the voice, but the rules… the rules had been so specific.

One. Two. Three.

The glow behind my eyelids was overwhelming, as if the sun itself was pressing against me.

Ten. Eleven. Twelve.

I heard a faint sound outside the observatory, like a deep sigh. Was it gone?

I forced my eyes open. The light from the orb was still there, but it had changed. It was no longer just a light, but a shifting, amorphous mass, slowly floating up the side of the tower, inching closer to the window.

It wasn’t gone.

I quickly shut my eyes again, heart pounding in my chest. The panic surged again, and I counted, desperately.

Fifty. Fifty-one. Fifty-two.

When I opened my eyes this time, the light was gone. The room was dark again.

I let out a breath I hadn’t realized I was holding. It worked.

But I knew, deep down, that this wasn’t over. Not by a long shot.

I turned to the trapdoor, but the footsteps outside the tower—those steps, the ones I had ignored earlier—were back. Louder now, closer. A slow, deliberate march, as if whoever—or whatever—was coming toward me knew exactly what I was thinking.

I hesitated, staring at the trapdoor, wondering if I should try to escape. But the rules had been clear: Never open the door if there are footsteps. Lock it, and hide.

But could I really stay hidden? Was I even safe in here?

The footsteps stopped abruptly. Silence. But I wasn’t fooled. I knew the danger was far from over.

Then, a voice, faint but distinct, echoed in the back of my mind.

“You didn’t follow the rules.”

My heart skipped.

The voice was neither the same as the one on the radio, nor was it the eerie whisper from earlier. This voice felt more personal, more familiar.

I didn’t know why, but I felt as though I had known it before.

The trapdoor rattled.

I leapt back, my mind spinning.

“It’s too late.”

The knocking started again, louder this time, almost frantic. Who was on the other side? What was on the other side?

My breath quickened, my pulse hammering in my ears. It was almost 3:00 AM. The time was near.

I could hear something on the other side of the door. It was breathing.

And then, just before the last stroke of midnight, I heard the final whisper.

“You’ve already broken the first rule. You’ll never leave now.”

The air inside the observatory felt heavier now, suffocating, as if the very walls were closing in around me. The footsteps had stopped, but the knocking didn’t. It grew louder, more forceful, as if whatever was on the other side was trying to break in.

I had to make a decision. I had to do something. My mind raced with possibilities—escape, call for help, run down the narrow metal stairs—but I knew the rules.

Never open the door.

The voice on the radio had said it. The letter had said it. And now, with each echo of the knock, the weight of those rules bore down on me more heavily.

I looked around the room, my gaze darting between the walls, the windows, the trapdoor. My eyes settled on the telescope. The rules had said not to look into it after midnight, but I had already broken so many of them.

What if I looked?

I took a step toward the telescope. The urge to know what was outside, what was causing the knocks, what was waiting for me was overwhelming. Every fiber of my being screamed at me to look. I was alone. The clock was ticking, the footsteps had stopped, but that damn knocking, that persistent knocking—it was too much.

My heart hammered in my chest as I stood next to the telescope, the cold metal frame feeling unnervingly steady beneath my hands.

I felt like I was on the edge of a precipice. One wrong move, and I might tumble into the unknown.

The knocking stopped, replaced by a soft, almost imperceptible hum. The hum from before.

I turned the knob on the telescope, adjusting its aim toward the distant forest below. The stars above shone brighter now, their glow almost artificial. The mountains were hidden behind a blanket of fog that hadn’t been there when I first arrived. The trees, once still, now swayed with unnatural speed. The forest… was alive.

But that wasn’t all. In the distance, just beyond the trees, was a shape. A dark silhouette, far too large to be a person. It was moving, too, but not like anything I’d ever seen before.

I didn’t know what it was. It couldn’t be real.

I lifted my hand from the telescope, my mind racing to catch up with my own actions. What had I just seen?

A knock on the trapdoor—louder than before.

I froze. My heart dropped to my stomach. It wasn’t a person knocking anymore. This was something else. It was almost like… a demand. It wasn’t waiting anymore. It wanted in.

“You’ve seen it now.” The voice crackled over the radio again. This time, it was clearer, sharper, more… forceful.

I backed away from the telescope, my legs unsteady. I could feel the weight of whatever I had just witnessed lingering in my mind, like a shadow creeping over me, suffocating me. What was out there? What had I seen?

The knocking came again. I had to do something. I had no idea what was real anymore.

And then, as if the tower itself had a mind of its own, the trapdoor began to rattle. I spun around, my eyes wide in terror, my breath shallow.

No. Not now.

“You can’t leave,” the voice whispered, almost too quietly, as if it were coming from the walls themselves. It was no longer just a voice. It was everywhere.

I rushed to the door, my hands trembling as I grabbed the handle. I could hear the rumbling of something massive outside, but the trapdoor wouldn’t budge. I pulled harder, but it was locked. It was as if it had been sealed shut from the outside.

I couldn’t escape.

I turned back to the room. The windows were all shut, the darkness outside pressing against the glass. But something had changed. A soft, almost imperceptible glow began to form at the edges of the glass. It was a faint light, like the afterglow of the stars—but it was wrong.

I stepped closer, drawn to the light, my mind a blur of conflicting thoughts. I shouldn’t look. I shouldn’t even approach it.

But the curiosity—the curiosity—was all-consuming.

As I reached out to touch the window, the light exploded. It flooded the room, so bright that it almost blinded me. My hand jerked back in instinct, but it was too late. I had already seen it.

A figure.

It was standing outside the tower, at the base. It was tall, shrouded in shadow, but its outline was unmistakable—human, but not human. A twisted, grotesque version of a person, with long, thin limbs that stretched out unnaturally. Its face was blank, featureless—nothing but a smooth, pale surface that seemed to shift with every blink.

It was watching me.

Staring at me.

It wasn’t alone.

Behind it, a wave of shadowy figures emerged from the trees. They moved in unison, as though they were bound by a force greater than themselves. There were more of them now—hundreds, thousands, their faces as empty and devoid of life as the one in front of the tower.

I stepped back from the window, my knees shaking beneath me.

I wanted to scream, to run, but the rules had been clear: No one leaves. Not until the watch is over.

The radio crackled again, the voice soft, almost mocking.

“You can’t escape now.”

The door rattled harder, the sound of the unseen force pressing against it echoing through the tower. They were coming.

I didn’t know what to do. The rules had bound me here, and now I was trapped—trapped by my curiosity, trapped by the darkness outside, trapped by the things that were coming for me. There was no escape, no way out. The countdown had already begun. I had seen the light. I had seen the shadows. And now, they were waiting.

The knocking on the trapdoor grew louder, more desperate. Whatever was outside, whatever was waiting for me, it wasn’t going to stop until it had what it wanted.

I could hear the whispers again—faint at first, like the wind itself was trying to speak, but it quickly turned into a low, almost pleading murmur. “Let us in.” The words were familiar now, but the voice was not. It didn’t feel like a person. It didn’t feel like anything human.

I backed away from the window, stumbling as my feet hit the floor. The flare gun—the last shred of hope I had—was still clutched tightly in my hands, but the terror had paralyzed me. What good was it now? How could a flare stop… that?

The shadows outside moved closer, their forms stretching and distorting, like living nightmares, flickering at the edges of my vision. I couldn’t look away. I couldn’t stop staring. Their eyes—empty and hollow—reflected the stars, yet they didn’t belong to the stars. They didn’t belong to this world.

The radio crackled once again, sharp and clear, breaking the silence.

“You broke the rules.”

The voice sounded almost… disappointed. It was as though it had expected me to fail, expected me to succumb to the curiosity. To gaze into the forbidden light. To make that one last, fatal mistake.

I closed my eyes, trying to shut out the images that flooded my mind—the creatures, the glowing light, the whispers. I should have listened. I should have stayed inside the rules.

But it was too late.

I felt the room grow colder, colder than it had been before. The temperature dropped, and I could see my breath fogging the air. They were coming.

The trapdoor rattled again, this time accompanied by a groan, like something was pushing against it from the outside. I could almost hear their voices now, clearer than ever.

“You shouldn’t have opened the door.”

It was no longer a voice on the radio. It wasn’t the wind. It wasn’t static.

It was them. They were inside the tower.

I could hear them moving around the room, their footsteps impossibly silent but unmistakable. They were circling me. Watching me.

The door to the observatory rattled, and with a final, sickening creak, it swung open.

I couldn’t bring myself to look. I couldn’t face whatever was standing there, waiting.

But I heard it.

A soft, rasping breath, followed by a whisper that chilled me to my core:

“It’s time.”

Then, a figure stepped forward, tall and twisted, its face still featureless, still shifting and wrong.

I didn’t scream. I couldn’t. The words—those haunting words—had already been spoken. The rules had already been broken. I had already seen them.

But the horror wasn’t just in their appearance. It wasn’t in the fact that they were not human.

The horror was in the realization that they had always been there.

They were the watchers.

The ones who maintained the rules. The ones who ensured that those who were curious—those who wanted to know too much—would be brought to them. The ones who could never leave.

I stumbled back, my legs giving way beneath me, and fell to the cold floor. The creature’s face bent toward mine, its empty eyes staring deep into my soul.

And then, in a voice that wasn’t a voice at all, it spoke.

“You are one of us now.”

I could feel it. The moment it reached out to touch me, the air became thick and suffocating. The light dimmed, the stars flickering out one by one, swallowed by the eternal darkness.

The truth had been revealed.

There was no escape. There never had been.

I had become part of the watch. The Starlight Watchman.

And now, I would wait. Wait for the next fool to take my place.
