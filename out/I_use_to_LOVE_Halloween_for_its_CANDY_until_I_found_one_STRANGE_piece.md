When I was kid my favorite holiday was Halloween, it was a day I looked forward to all year round; unlike most kids that anticipated  gifts during Christmas all I could ever think about was the candy. To me it was something wondrous to be able walk to a strangers house and ask for a treat, the scary costumes where a just bonus; dressing up like my favorite super hero each year left me feeling deserving of such a delicious sweet. For the most part that wonderment didn't change, each year I would gather with my friends and scour the streets for as much candy as our Halloween containers could hold; usually my friends would get tired before me which I didn't mind, in fact, I figured I was better off without them; more candy for me after all. I would hit a few more houses before deciding to head home but this one particular night I felt a bit more determined, I told myself that if I could just get a few more pieces, that I would be set for the rest of year; the idea of eating the gluttonous treats for months practically made my mouth water so I did something I had never done before and that was, I left my usual neighborhood and visited the houses on the outskirts of town. I imagined unearthing a chest full of undiscovered houses as if I were some 18th century explorer searching for new corners of the earth.

My parents always told me to stay close to home, that the people that lived outside our neighborhood were different, that they didn't celebrate Halloween like we did, at the time I didn't give it much thought I just figured my parents were over exaggerating. So I ventured out into the darken roads that seemed to be desolated of any trick or treaters leaving me with the idea that there had to be more delicious unseen treasures all waiting for me to uncover them. I must of walked for about 10 minutes before seeing a house, at first glance I thought my parents were right, from what I saw the lights were off to the crumbling house; no decorations of any kind lay in the front yard; it was clear this house had no candy and for the most part the house seemed to be abandoned. I decided to walk a bit further hoping to find at least one house that was giving out candy; at this point my mind was no longer enthralled with trick or treating instead it was enchanted with the premise of being able to tell my classmates that I alone ventured into the unknown and having one treat would be the evidence that I needed to demonstrate my courage. 

As I continued my search the air became heavy, a slight fog skew my vision while the full menacing moon became my one guiding light as I turned corners through the empty dirt roads. My once excitement casually morphed into trepidation as the sounds of the night inundated the lonely space, my heart throbbed with intensity as I finally gave up my excursion and just wanted to go home; wishing I had heeded my parents words. My eyes filled with tears as my fear became overwhelming and I felt like falling over in defeat there in the middle of nowhere while weeping until day light. That's when I finally saw a dim light in the distance, it's dancing glow left me with only one answer, something that I recognized all to well being a Halloween enthusiast; it was from a candle. I slowly treaded closer following the burning flame as if it were my salvation, thinking the light would scare away the imaginary monsters that plagued my thoughts. I could hear the howls and hisses from the night critters that surrounded me only strengthen the closer I got to the burning light, my eyes fixated on providence and as I finally arrived I saw the light was coming from a pumpkin a pumpkin that lay in the middle of a yard in front of another decaying home. 

A hideous sight it was, the mouth outstretched in different angles across the face of the withering pumpkin as it's triangular carved eyes displayed absolute malice, the monstrosity was one of the largest pumpkins I've ever seen; it's height alone must of reached my eye level. At this point I wasn't too sure if the desolated night scared me more than the sinister beast that seemed to be smiling at me; I pondered if I should just run home or lay still in hopes that the pumpkin wouldn't magically come to life as I slept. Looking back at the path that I came all I could see was pure darkness a never ending void that journeyed to the deepest realms of emptiness but looking forward I saw hope in the flickering candle that lay still in the gaping mouth of the beast. I decided to curl up next to the ghastly creation as the continue howls from the night sky simmered around me and soon the sound of the gushing wind became a bit therapeutic; it cradling my mind into ease as my eyes seemed to be closing, I felt the land of slumber calling out to me and for that moment I felt comforted. Though that comfort would soon be interrupted as the whipping sound of wind became a bit more insidious and a faint growl mixed into the melancholy music that had been created. My eyes quickly shot open as I stood to my feet looking around for the source of the noise, but it was just more darkness, I grasped at the pumpkin as if it were my protector and soon the faint growl became more evident; whatever was creating the horrid sound was approaching. 

'grrrrrrrr, grrrrrrrr, grrrrr'

The wet sound of gurgling fluttered in the air as my eyes bounced from corner to corner trying to catch the beast in mid step; preparing myself to run. Finally the abandon home that laid in ruins sprung to life as the front door creaked open and to my horror that sound only became more vivid; it in fact was coming from some devilish entity.

"Cannnndyyyyyyyy" the demon shouted out.

A grey hand gripped the side of the door as it opened, I froze in place from terror not knowing what options did I really have, scream perhaps? Who would even hear me? So instead I stood in place thinking perhaps I wouldn't be visible to the beast at the angle I was standing, I did my best to steady my trembling body as I held the giant pumpkin even tighter. After several seconds the long pale body of the monster finally was visible, it's eyes seem to glow in the dark while piles of drool fell to the floor from it's frothing mouth. 

"Cannnnddyyyy"

I shut my eyes tightly pretending to fade away into the midnight sky like a drifting spirit returning to the afterlife to which it belonged to and counted backwards in my head trying to occupy my thoughts to ease the grinding of my teeth knowing the monster would only hear me.

"Cannnnddyyyy"

That's when I finally could make out what the devil was saying, it was calling out for 'candy'; the beast wanted candy. I could clearly hear the creature was sniffing the air, it's noise making the most grotesque sound as it hunted for it's treat. I lowered my arm from the withering pumpkins face and grasped at my bag of candy, the thing was smelling my treats. I stared at the pumpkins face for several seconds as the revelation of escape had finally manifested itself in my young mind, I was going to throw my bag as far as I could and then run hoping that beast only was really looking for candy. I breathed in with ambition as I exhaled all of my anxiety and by some divine miracle I gathered up the courage to put my plan into action, my small hands clenched the bag tightly as I quietly aimed it over my head and threw it as best I could in the opposite direction of where I stood. The monster acted quick and within seconds it chased after the noise or perhaps the scent as the thing became a mere blur from it's quickness and soon all I could hear were the breaking of branches as it hurled over to the candy. I didn't hesitate, I ran into the abyss that engulfed me hoping I didn't crash into anything, I scurried through the tree line doing my best to navigate through the thick fog. I could still hear the terrific sounds of grunts as I cried thinking how could the beast still be following me to only realize the whimpers were coming from me. I've must of ran for what felt like an hour, I still could hardly see anything, I didn't know what else to do; I was tired and scared. I didn't hear the monster anymore as my breathing calmed and with that I took the opportunity to rest only to fall asleep.

I awoke to the sun blaring down its light unto my face, I stood to my feet looking around for anything that seemed familiar; the fog had dissipated and the menacing trees from the night before looked a lot more lush and welcoming. I walked for a few yards and quickly came to the same house from last night, though in the darkness it was hard to make out all it's dismantled features but I was sure it was the same home. I thought I ran far away from it only to realize I must of been running in circles or maybe the home itself played with me like a cat tracking each step a mouse makes before it captures it in it's deadly claws; though now in the day light the abandon home seemed less horrifying and more pathetic. I could see the door was still ajar at the same position the monster had left it, I started to step away backwards thinking the beast might be close but then realized the giant pumpkin from last night was gone, it's inundating presence now was a mere memory. I scratched at my head of how that could be possible and I started to convince myself the whole ordeal was a dreadful nightmare I must of had. I walked around the yard looking for any traces of evidence and soon I stumbled upon the bag of candy I threw, it looked like it was rifled through; pieces of candy laid in disarray but that could of been due to the impact from me tossing it.

I then walked towards the horrid home and stepped unto the porch searching for something; anything to prove what I saw was real. On the porch I saw shredded wrappings from candy bars scattered across the porch leading into the darkness of the home, though one bar was left unopen and I bent over to pick up the small candy. The candy bar was a brand I've never seen before in fact the wrapper had no visible details or writing, no indication of the company that produced it nor any nutritional data it was just a brown wrapper that protected the mysterious chocolate. I then raised my head and looked inside the empty house and considered the idea of venturing in, but the thoughts of the possible evil that resided within crushed the idea immediately and instead I retreated off the porch placing the candy into my pocket. 

After that I walked for a few hours and eventually made it back to the main road, a passing motorist found me and took me back to my neighborhood where by this point the entire city was out in search of my where abouts. My parents were completely devastated but relieved when they saw that I was okay showering me in what seemed like endless affection. I told my story to several of my friends but as one could of guess they didn't believe me, no one ever did I had the chocolate bar as evidence but always felt reserved at showing anyone; perhaps what had happened to me needed to die with that horrific night. 

As time passed I hated Halloween but even more so my once sweet tooth vanished, I didn't participate in any of the festivities when it came to the spooky holiday. Instead I became the lonely weirdo that lived on the outskirts of town, I became a bit of a legend 'the scary old man that eats children during Halloween', the story makes me laugh but it doesn't bother me; I just keep to myself. That was until this October, I notice people are acting strange, they're not acting like themselves. More terrifying is that I've been finding those same brown wrappers around town, the mysterious candy no where to be seen but even more dire was this years Halloween decoration at our city hall; in the front yard of the building is a giant withering pumpkin, it's devilish smile sheltering a small candle. I think it's time for me to leave town or perhaps it's time for me to get back into the spirit of Halloween and save my community.
