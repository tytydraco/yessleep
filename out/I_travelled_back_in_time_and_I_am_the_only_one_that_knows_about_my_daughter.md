Yesterday, I was driving my car to my home after a bad day at work. My boss basically humiliated me in front of all of my coworkers because of something I did when I was 12 years old (It’s not relevant to the story). And that’s not all: After everyone at the office laughed at me, I got angry and went to the bathroom. When I entered the bathroom, I didn’t notice the “WET FLOOR” sign and I slipped and hurt my butt. Thankfully, nobody else saw me, but it was painful to seat on my chair for the next 2 hours. What a sh\*t Friday.  
  
When I got home, I relaxed knowing that nothing could go wrong with my family. I was wrong.  
  
I opened the door with my keys, and my daughter Lana came running from her bedroom. I thought she came to hug me, but instead she asked where was mom. I got annoyed by it, but the truth is that I didn’t knew either.   
  
I asked Lana why she couldn’t find mom if she was supposed to watch over her when I was at work, just like every other day. She responded me with: “I haven’t seen her since I woke up today”. Suddenly, I felt something weird in my stomach, I could feel something wasn’t right. Lana told me she thought she went to work with me that day or something like that.  
  
Despite being only 8 years old, Lana is a very mature and responsible girl. She told me that because mom wasn’t home, she made herself lunch and dinner with the food that was in the fridge.  
   
I was glad that Lana was okay, but I was worried about my wife. I picked up my phone and called her. No response. I texted her. No response. I started to REALLY worry. It was 10:30 p.m. and there was no sign of her.   
  
Before I freaked out and called the police, I decided to check if she somehow was still in the house. Lana was screaming “MOOOOM!” while I was checking every single room. We didn’t find her. We didn’t find her phone. Nothing gave me a hint of her current location.   
  
I messaged every relative that my wife and I had that I remembered. Nothing. I messaged her friends. Nothing. Nobody knew. She seemed to have disappeared from reality. I started to think the worst scenarios. Did she abandon us? Did someone kidnap her? But how could that be possible? Everything was in place and organized…  
  
  
  
It was midnight. I knew what I had to do. I called the police. After almost an hour they arrived at home and they started their investigation. I was so f\*cking tired. Yesterday couldn’t have been worse. I was anxious and somehow sleepy at the same time.   
  
The policemen told me to stay at home until they did some things that I don’t even remember. They also told me to stay awake so they could ask me questions if needed. I tried to. But when you are tired and you are sitting on a comfortable couch past midnight, there is only one thing that can happen.  
  
I fell asleep, even with all the stress that I had. I know that I should’ve stayed awake because it was important, but I was very tired. I expected the policemen to wake me up, but somehow, they didn’t.   
  
Today, it is Saturday, and I woke up at 1:00 p.m. I was feeling alright but I was still sad and confused about yesterday’s situation.  
  
After I got out of bed, I went downstairs to see where was Lana or the policemen. I could here someone in the kitchen. At first, I supposed it was Lana making herself a meal after she saw me asleep in the couch upstairs. When I entered the room, I couldn’t believe my eyes.  
  
It was my wife! Making some sandwiches! I was astonished. I hugged her (almost crying) and asked her where was she yesterday. She seemed a little bit confused. She told me that she went to work at 7:00 p.m. yesterday and stayed in the hospital until 4:00 a.m. of today. She then told me that she supposed that I already knew that because she told me she was going to work for a little longer on Friday.  
  
Then I asked her why didn’t she answer my calls. She told me that she thought she already told me that her phone was broken and it was basically useless.   
  
Then I was the one that looked confused and started to realize something. Work? She hasn’t worked since 2025, when she decided to stop working as a nurse to be with Lana as much as she could until she grew up. Why was she talking about the hospital again?   
  
I then walk away, confused, and went to Lana’s bedroom. When I entered the room, I noticed that it was filled with cardboard boxes and other old stuff. I REALLY started to freak out. I went running downstairs and asked my wife where was Lana.  
  
She looked very confused. Then she asked me: “Who’s Lana?”. I almost pass out. I told her that Lana is the FRICKING CHILD WE HAVE. She looked me with that face. You know that face. The face of: “What the hell is this guy talking about?”. I felt like I was going insane.   
  
I decided to take some fresh air and went to the local Mc’ Donald’s. I took a sit and tried to calm down. The place looked very different from what I remembered. I opened my phone gallery and scrolled through the photos. I didn’t see Lana in any of them.   
  
Then, out of desperation, I called my mother. I took a deep breath and prepared for the worst. She answered the call.

  
“Hi mom, do you remember when the quarantine started?”

 "The Coronavirus one? Yeah, I think it was March of 2020. Now that I think of it, wow! Already three years! Time flies, hehe. Anyway why do you need to know that son?"

I ended the call.

I confirmed my suspicions. I travelled to the past. I don’t know how. I don’t know why. I just know that I hate it. Now that I pay more attention, in my phone it says that we are in 2023. My body feels a little bit smaller. The scar in my arm disappeared . This is f*cking insane.  
  
All the memories that I had with Lana. They technically don’t exist anymore. I’m in a separate reality, one that I have already experienced 10 years ago. I will have to live this sh\*t again. I don’t even know if this can happen again in the future. Or in the past? I don’t even know anymore; this is so confusing. I am now afraid to fall asleep.  
  
I am losing my mind. This feels like a f\*cking movie. I don’t even know if I will have Lana now. Am I the only person in the world that remembers Lana? Her beautiful smile… Her black and long hair…  
  
She is now only part of my memory.
