I woke up in bed with all of my clothes on. It was almost noon. A pounding headache in my 18-year-old skull. The year was 2005, and I was horrifyingly hungover. 

I was in my own bed. I was alone. Both good. I couldn’t remember anything from the night before shortly after the drinks started flowing. Not good.

My cell phone kept ringing, that steady vibration. I didn’t know where it was. It could wait. Our lives didn’t revolve around our phones 20 years ago. Christ, that was 20 years ago now? 

My best friend, Lucy, was asleep on the couch out in the living, surrounded by empty bottles and cans. The house was a disaster. I only had one question for her…WHAT HAPPENED?

“I have no idea. I got just as drunk as you,” Lucy shot back at me. “I broke my phone at some point. I know that.”

Speaking of phones. Mine wouldn’t stop ringing. One call would follow the next. What the fuck? I let it go. I figured it was some mess I had to clean up and I wasn’t ready to face the day yet. I did check my calls though and I had dozens of missed calls from the same number. Either a spam call or some psycho dude I met the night before I was gonna want to ghost.

Brrrr…brrrr…brrr…my phone started to ring yet again. 

“LEAVE ME ALONE!” I rejected the call and threw my phone down. 

“Your phone won’t stop ringing either?” Lucy asked. 

She showed me her phone. Yes, the screen was cracked, but it still seemed to work and she showed it was actively getting a call as well. 

“I can’t even answer it if I wanted to,” Lucy said before she announced she was heading to the cell phone store to get it fixed and left. 

Brr…

AHHH! I raged so hard I accidentally threw up.

Brrr…brrr….brrr…the call kept coming in though.

Maybe it was that my body had just ejected everything in my gut, but I suddenly got cold when I saw the call come through this time. That same fucking number. My intuition told me to not answer it. I did see I had called it the night before. Still didn’t mean I was going to answer it. 

It was time to  just Google the number. This seems crazy to write now, but Googling something wasn’t as much of a no brainer back then as it is now. 

I got a hit. One of those revenge porn type college site forums where people posted pictures of people and talked shit. There was something about the number on the page for my college. 

The title of the post was rather discomforting: DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER! DO NOT ANSWER IF IT CALLS YOU!

The rest of the post went on to explain (the poster didn’t know how) but the phone number was cursed. If you called it, it would call you back until you answered, and you died if you answered it. 

How? Why? Who? Huh? There were no more answers. Just a warning.

Did I believe it? Enough to where I had a horrible realization. I had to find Lucy and stop her in case she was going to answer a call from that number. 

She had just come back from the cell phone store with a fixed screen and disappeared into her room to sleep off the hangover.

Brrr…brrr..brrr…

I could hear a phone ringing when I got back into the house. Lucy’s room. It was coming from Lucy’s room! I burst through Lucy’s bedroom door.

“DON’T ANSWER IT!”

I couldn’t see Lucy. Just her trashed bedroom. I screamed out to her, interrupted by the sound of…

Brrr…brrr….

I followed the sound of the phone. Oh no, she was in her bathroom. The phone buzzing was interrupted by the sound of a toilet flushing. 

“DON’T ANSWER!” I screamed again and the bathroom door started to open. 

Too late. I saw Lucy hit accept just as the door opened in my crazy face. 

“Dillon?” she answered with a groggy voice. 

The two of us locked eyes. She looked at me like I was insane. For a brief moment in time I thought it was all going to be okay. 

Then the screaming sound came out of Lucy’s phone, right next to her ear. Impossibly high, screeching, piercing, I thought my ears were going to explode. 

Then Lucy’s ear exploded. Blood erupted from her ear which was closest to the phone. She dropped the phone and I saw it hit the ground and burst into flames. She screamed out in the most horrible pain I’ve ever heard and dropped to the ground, gripping her skull. 

I moved to help her. The phone flamed up and burned at me. I had to watch as she retreated further into blinding pain and her other ear exploded with blood. Then her mouth. Then nose. Then eyes, and pretty soon my best friend was reduced to a blood washed dead body at my feet.
