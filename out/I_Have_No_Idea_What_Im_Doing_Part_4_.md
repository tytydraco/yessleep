I woke up to something tickling my nose. Something small and damp flicked across my nose. I reached out to wave it away but it would return within seconds.

I opened my eyes to see myself eye-to-eye with a snake. I instinctively jerked backwards and nearly tumbled off the toilet I’d fallen asleep on. After the initial shock of waking up face-to-face with a decently-sized snake wore off, I was able to redirect my focus from the snake to the man who was actually holding it. It was Psycho Jimmy.

After a rough night with very little sleep followed by a few hours of aimless wandering around Walmart, I had become dead-tired and locked myself in the bathroom stall to try and find a private place to take a nap.

Obviously, it wasn’t private enough as Psycho Jimmy had crawled under the stall door, somehow procured a snake and woke me up by holding it up to my face to let its tongue flick out across my nose.

Seeing I was awake, Psycho Jimmy thrust the snake further in my direction as if offering it to me. I waved a hand in a sign of refusal and he pulled the snake back and placed it in a pocket inside his jacket.

Having never been in a situation like this – locked in a bathroom stall with a man nicknamed ‘Psycho’ – I had no idea how to react, so I thanked him for waking me up as I had a big day ahead of me.

Psycho Jimmy nodded his head in acknowledgement, winked at me then left the way he came – by crawling out under the stall door. I waited until I heard him leave, then I waited another 10 minutes before I left the bathroom.

I had 3 missed calls and 2 unread text messages. The first of the text messages read, “Bro, I’m too High right now” the second message read, “Sorry Boss, that wasn’t for you.”

The text messages were obviously from Pedro. The calls were from Destiny.

I called Destiny back. She was understandably annoyed.

“You do realize what time it is, right?” I glanced at the clock for the first time that day, it was noon, “We have an appointment for 3pm and it's an hour drive if we don’t hit traffic. Are we doing this or not?”

I was embarrassed, “Ah shit, I’m sorry. I had a, uh, weird night. Look if yo-“

Destiny cut me off, “Oh, yeah, I get that. I figured that would happen when I saw that ghost in your bedroom yesterday. It didn’t seem, well, nice.”

“Look,” I continued, “I hate to be a burden, but do you think you could pick me up from Walmart?”

15 minutes later Destiny pulled into the Walmart parking lot driving a convertible Volkswagen beetle. “Boxers and a T-shirt at Walmart? You definitely had a rough night. Hop in.”

We stood on my doorstep and Destiny begged me to let her inside.

“Please let me go in with you, we need all the evidence we can find on this thing if we are going to figure out what it is and how to stop it.” She made a good point.

“That’s true,” I started my rebuttal, “but it might be dangerous.”

“If it’s dangerous then two is better than one” Damn. She had me beat.

“Alright, but I have no idea what we might see in there.” I turned the knob and pushed the door open.

Immediately the stench of cigarettes washed over us and I sprang into action running into the kitchen to grab a knife. I was so focused on getting a weapon in my hands that I didn’t even notice the source of the smell.

“Uh, so, what the hell is that?” Destiny asked, a finger pointing into the living room where Cynthia sat in an armchair. She was naked, cross-legged and held a smoldering cigarette in between two of her fingers. Her head was now screwed on correctly.

“That is…” I almost said ‘Cynthia’ and that would have made me look like a total perv, “something I’ve never seen before.” I walked over to Cynthia and took the cigarette out of her hand, extinguished it, then plunged the kitchen knife deep into her chest which accomplished exactly nothing.

“I’m going to brush my teeth and grab some clothes and we’ll get out of here, ok?”

“Ok,” Destiny replied, “Anything else? We’ll be gone most of the day.”

“Yeah,” I said back to her, “I’m going to call my intern.”

15 minutes later I was sitting shotgun in Destiny’s car as we drove to Pedro’s house to pick up my new employee. Cynthia was buckled up in the backseat. I had to beg Destiny to help me take it out of the house. She definitely didn’t believe me when I said I’d never seen her before. Which is fine, I didn’t believe her when she said her ghost dog, Hercules, was sitting in the backseat with Cynthia, although the car did smell like there was a dog in there with us. Maybe there really was a vengeful ghost dog with us.

We pulled up to Pedro’s house and again I had to convince Destiny to help me lug her out of the car and into the trash can.

“Will he be okay with this?” She asked.

“I’m his boss, he has to be.”

We tossed her in the can, but because of her weird robot-esque joints she didn’t fit too well and a leg poked out of the half-closed lid.

I sent Pedro a text and he came bounding out of his house like golden retriever but stopped dead in his tracks as soon as he saw the leg sticking out of his trash can, “Oh Shit!” he shouted, “You guys smoke somebody?” He looked nervous.

“Just a demon, Pedro. That’s just a demon. Hop in.”

“Oh, that’s dope dude,” Pedro hopped in, “Where are we going?”

“We’re going to the local college,” Destiny chirped.

“Ah shit. We don’t have to go to class, do we?” Pedro moaned.

We arrived 30 minutes before our meeting with Destiny’s old professor, Harold Potter. I shit you not, his name was Harry Potter, but apparently, he would get pretty upset if you called him anything other than Professor Potter.

The three of us sat across from Professor Potter in his shabby basement office surrounded on all sides by dusty books of various sizes and ages.

I pulled the leg we came to question him about out of my backpack and slid it across the table to him.

“Oh! It has a nipple! How exciting!” he exclaimed as he poked and prodded at the fake limb with a gloved finger.

“That’s a nipple?!” Pedro could hardly contain his excitement, “I thought that was a chocolate stain or something! Does this mean the leg is a girl?”

There was a beat of silence as we took a second to question if that really was the first thing Pedro sought to ask.

Destiny broke the silence, “Professor, we wanted to ask you what you could tell us about this leg. It is clearly bound in human skin, so you were the only person I could think of to consult. Any leads would be very helpful.”

“Let me start with a question of my own,” The professor was gently turning the leg over to examine it, “Where did you find it?”

Destiny and I both braced ourselves for whatever might come out of Pedro’s mouth, “My roommate Archie and I were at an illegal street race in Kansas City, Kansas and one of the cars crashed and blew up into a giant fireball”

Everyone in the room leaned in waiting for whatever insane nonsense followed, “And then?” Destiny nudged him.

“Then the police showed up and the law says that if the police use rubber bullets, then it’s okay to start looting.”

Harry Potter’s eyes were wide as saucers. I patted Pedro on the shoulder, “Keep going buddy.”

“I met a guy named Snake and we decided to loot a food truck that was parked nearby but none of the food inside was cooked, so we got a whole crew together and we flipped that bitch!”

“PEDRO. FOCUS.” Destiny was mortified about her favorite old professor associating her with a person as insanely stupid as Pedro, “Where did the leg come from?”

“Oh, I don’t know,” Pedro continued, “Archie had it at the end of the night when I met back up with him at the motel. He had a bunch of wine and a whole mess of these crackers with him too. They weren’t very good though”

“So, your friend robbed a church?” Destiny asked, red in the face.

“Oh, I don’t know,” Pedro said, smiling, just happy to be there.

“Well boys and girls,” Harry Potter said, “All I can tell you is that this leg certainly appears to be bound in human flesh. I cannot confirm for certain without rigorous testing, but the nipple on the reverse side certainly points toward human.”

“How common is the practice of binding books in human skin,” I asked, curious.

“Well certainly not as common as it once was,” Professor Potter said with a laugh, “In ancient times anthropodermic bibliopegy was much more common. Still quite rare, mind you, but common in comparison to today.” He rubbed his chin then continued, “The question of why people did it however remains a mystery. We have evidence it was sometimes done to honor the work, to show respect to the actual writing itself. There are times when the skin of criminals was used as sort of a novelty, to create a collector’s item so to say. There are also examples of anthropodermic bibliopegy which is when an author uses their own skin to bind their own book. I wish I could give you more information, but maybe you could ask some of the other professors? Try Professor McGonagall in Anthropology”

We ascended the stairs out of the basement office, “Professor McGonagall?” I asked, “What is this fucking Hogwarts?”

Professor McGonagall sent us to the Foreign Languages department, which sent us to the Religious Studies Department who then re-routed us back to the History department who referred us back to Professor Harry Potter.

“I can’t believe no one here can tell us anything about this leg,” Destiny lamented, “I thought for sure Professor Potter would be a bigger help”

Destiny and I sat in silence on a bench near the student union and watched as Pedro tried asking nearly every single girl who walked past him for their phone number. He approached a tall redhead who instead of entertaining the idea of a conversation with Pedro took off in a full sprint the other direction.

“It's okay, Pedro!” I shouted to him, “Maybe she thought you were so handsome she just had to go tell her friends about you!”

“You shouldn’t encourage him,” Destiny said to me in a low tone so Pedro wouldn’t hear.

“You’re probably right,” I replied, “Hey, did you see that Heart-shaped mark on the leg? If that’s human skin, then it’s a tattoo, right?”

“Yeah, so what”

“Well, where do the kids with lots of tattoos hangout? Maybe we can ask them if they’d seen it before or if they recognize the artist” It was the only idea I could think of to salvage the situation.

“Definitely the Art department”

“Let’s go there.”

We walked into the unsymmetrically lit room where a ring of art students surrounded a naked man on a pedestal. Some were sketching him with pencils, some with charcoal, and a few were painting. There were a lot of tattooed people in this crowd. Lots of eyeliner and spiked collars too.

Pedro was mortified at the naked man, “Dude, does no one else see the naked guy? This is disgusting, let’s get out of here.”

“Pedro. Just close your eyes.” Pedro was getting on Destiny’s last nerve, “As a matter of fact, go stand in the corner and don’t speak for the next 72 hours”

We waited on the periphery of the circle until the class ended, then we approached the teacher, a middle-aged man in skinny jeans, fedora, eyeliner and a spiked collar. His name was Indigo and he thought he looked far cooler than he actually did.

We presented the leg to Indigo and he instantly stood up from his desk, walked over to the door and locked it, “Where did you get that?” he asked.

“Hey, I still need to get out of here man.” said the model who was now putting on his clothes in the corner of the room. Everyone ignored him.

“You know what this leg is?” Destiny and I said in unison.

“I know what it is, what I’m asking is why do you have it and why did you bring it into my classroom?”

A voice called from the corner of the room opposite the model putting on his clothes. It was Pedro, “I was at an illegal street race in Kansas City and –“

“Shut up!” Destiny and I said in unison.

“We don’t know where it came from,” Destiny continued, pointing over to Pedro who was standing motionless and staring at a blank canvas, “That’s Pedro. The leg belonged to his roommate. We’re aren’t exactly sure of its origins”

Indigo furrowed his brow, clearly not happy with the origin story, “And why did you bring it to me?”

“Because we’ve gone to nearly every other department at this school and no one has any clue what it is. The Art Department was kind of a Hail Mary.” I explained, “Can you help us?”

“I can tell you what you need to know, but that is it” Indigo couldn’t tear his eyes away from the fake limb, “I don’t want any part of this. I don’t want that thing anywhere near me.”

“What is it?” I asked.

“It’s my mother-in-law” Indigo continued to stare at the flesh bound limb.

“You’re married…” I tried to put it together, “To this leg’s daughter?.... Son?”

Indigo finally peeled his eyes away from the leg and looked at me, “My mother-law created the leg with my late wife’s skin.” “How do we know you’re telling the truth?” I asked.

Indigo pointed to the ‘Mommy’s Home” tattoo on the cursed legs thigh, “You see that tattoo?” he asked. Before we could answer Indigo grabbed hold of his shirt collar with both hands and ripped his shirt clean off his body like he was a professional wrestler. Emblazoned across his chest was a massive tattoo of a heart, written across it were the words “Daddy’s Home”.

“Hell yeah! Hulkamania!” Shouted Pedro from across the room.

“I still need to get out of here. Can you please unlock the door?” Asked the model who was now standing next to the locked door.

Destiny and I looked at each other in disbelief, “What the hell was going on in your family?” was the only thing I could think to ask.

Indigo continued, “My wife died unexpectedly in a car accident while I was hiking the Appalachian trail, something I’d always wanted to do and something my wife encouraged me to conquer before I got too old. My mother-in-law, who was always deeply into the occult kept my wife’s death a secret. She told no one, not even her other children. Instead, she tried to resurrect her.”

Indigo walked around his desk that was cluttered with charcoal sketches and stacks of watercolor still life paintings. He sunk into his chair and ran his fingers through his sweaty hair before swiveling in his chair to regard a large portrait that hung above his desk. The painting was of a middle-aged woman in a gray sweatsuit. Brown, shoulder-length hair and dark circles under her eyes. She looked bored.

Indigo let loose a heavy sigh and without turning from the portrait picked up his story where he left off, “My wife wanted to be cremated. Instead, her body putrefied in a damp basement as her own mother performed ritual after ritual to call her back from the other side. Calling on Angels, Demons and the Old Gods alike, none answered her pleas. She tried to heat the blood and pump it fresh back into the body. She tried electric shocks to the heart and brain and she prayed day and night. None of it worked. She turned to other disciplines – Voodoo, Santeria, Palo Mayombe, Youtube tutorials; still none of it worked.”

I turned to look at Destiny who was enthralled. I glanced then at Pedro who was staring deeply into a blank canvas like it was the most interesting painting he’d ever seen.

“Then she did…this,” Indigo continued, pointing at the leg, “I don’t know what it is or how she did it. I assume she was trying to build her a new body. The only facts I know for sure are when I found my wife’s body it had large pieces of flesh removed and all that I could find of my mother-in-law was the notes she kept. I’m not sure if she died. Or was transported to another plane or if she’s contained within the leg itself. But I’m done with it.”

“I still need someon-,” the model started before I cut him off.

“Why are you giving up on this? Don’t you want to know what happened? Wouldn’t your wife want you to keep pushing?” I asked.

Indigo sat in silence for a moment, his chest heaving giving the impression that the heart tattoo across it was beating, “We tried to figure out what happened. We tried to destroy the leg. We tried to get rid of it for months and it just kept coming back. Eventually we gave it to a priest in Kansas City, Kansas for safe keeping and that seemed to work. I thought it was finally out of my life and now you idiots brought it right back to me. I want nothing to do with it. I'm done.”

“You’re saying ‘we’, who else tried to help you with this?” Destiny asked.

Indigo pointed up to the painting that hung above his office desk, “She did. That is my sister. She was helping get to the bottom of all of this. After a day's research she was spending the night at my house. I had fixed up an air mattress for her in my studio. When I came in to check on her the next morning, this painting was all I could find.”

“So, you’re saying she got turned into a painting? How do you know it’s her and not just, like, a painting of her?” Destiny questioned.

“It blinks sometimes,” Indigo answered.

His answer made my skin crawl. Not the fact that the painting could blink. I’d seen much worse stuff in the last 96 hours. What really twisted my stomach was thinking about his sister’s fate. If she could blink, she was still alive. She just couldn’t move, breathe, or communicate. A complete and total paralysis. Imagine locked-in syndrome on a much bigger scale. I’d rather be dead.

I took another glance at Pedro who was still engrossed in the blank white canvas he’d been staring at the entire time. He leaned in and licked it, smacked his lips and continued to stare at it like it was the most beautiful thing he’d ever seen.

“Someone please let me out, I have a class to get to,” the model pleaded.

“Shut up!” Destiny, Indigo and I all shouted at once - In hindsight we weren’t very nice to that guy. Defeated, the model walked over to look at some of the other canvases near Pedro.

Destiny asked another good question, “You said you guys were doing research on the leg, right? Did you find any way to destroy it?”

“Kind of,” Indigo cleared his throat before carrying on, “We spoke to a tattoo artist in Olathe named T-Bone. He was really into the occult and all that. He said, the only way to destroy something like this leg is to expose it to an act of true beauty or true love. We asked if he could be more specific or give an example of something like that, but he just told us he was late to do battle with a Warlock in Jefferson City. I assume he lost the battle, because I never saw him again.”

The three of us sat in quiet reflection trying to think of an example of “True” love or beauty. All I could think of were sappy rom-coms and, for some reason, a particular Melissa Ethridge song.

A loud THUD shook us from our brainstorm and Indigo, Destiny and I all turned towards the sound of the clatter. That side of the room was empty save for a few canvases and the gym bag the model had been carrying.

“Where’d Pedro go?” I asked.

Destiny pointed her finger towards a canvas, “There”

“God Damn it! Not Again!” Shouted Indigo.

I walked over and looked at the canvas, it was a painting of Pedro. Him standing solitary in a gray void, his hands in his pockets and his expression blank.

A few feet away another canvas contained the image of the model.

A pit grew in my stomach. The clock was officially ticking. We needed to snuff out this prosthetic leg before anyone else was killed, maimed or sucked into a painting.

Destiny tucked the painting of Pedro under her arm as we headed out of the classroom.

“Take the other one too!” Indigo shouted as we left, but we ignored him.

We walked to the car in silence, each of us thinking of the enormity of the situation we’d found ourselves in. All either of us did was answer an ad on the internet and, all of a sudden, we’d found ourselves locked in a battle with an entity from the other side of the veil. An entity we couldn’t touch or see, but now we’d realized it could see us, touch us and if it wants – kill us. Fuck the internet.

As our car pulled out of the university parking lot, we drove past a disheveled looking man on a park bench who seemed to be watching us. My heart skipped a few beats when I recognized him as Psycho Jimmy. Was he following me? It simply couldn’t be a coincidence. The man was showing up everywhere I went. Something told me he had a part to play in all of this.

I didn’t tell Destiny about Psycho Jimmy. We had enough on our minds already – chiefly what the fuck is a “True” act of beauty or love?
