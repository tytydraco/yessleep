Hello again. Here once more for advice.

I haven't slept. I haven't eaten. I haven't communicated with anyone in what feels like days. After taking my nap, I woke up even more sick than before somehow. I went to urgent care that morning, waited for what felt like hours, my head feeling like it was splitting open. Nothing compared to the tremors, though. I dropped my keys twice trying to lock my own door; it's like I've aged 80 years in one night. Every time I move, its just jolt, jolt, random side pain, jolt again. My neighbor offered to help, only to audibly gasp when she saw my face. Hell, even I haven't seen my face, but I know it isn't good. Once the PA finally got to me, she took my vitals and sent me for a CT of my head. She declared I was in withdrawal. I've taken my antidepressants every single day, and I don't smoke or drink. It can't be withdrawal, I know that much. Does anyone know what's happening to me? I refuse to pick up that damn diary anymore, I don't care if I feel better with it. It's not my fault it ended up in my backpack. I must've put it in there on accident, but I can't read more. I can't. I'm dumping it in the trash as soon as I get home. I have to. Thank you all for your help. I've left the rest of what I read a few nights ago below, for those curious.

With Al gone, my irritation finally gave way, my office doors clattering shut. I let my frustrations out, my headband taking most of the brunt as I skimmed it across the bloodstained floor. I thumped noisily back to my desk, bits of makeup leaking off of my sweat covered face like candle wax. To an outsider, my office would’ve looked like the aftermath of a graveyard fashion show, a trail of blood and contour forming a gruesome runway. A pool of crimson staring back at me from the recliner, I snapped my fingers dryly, the air leaving the already lifeless room.

“CATS!” I barked, malice on my lips. “Get your asses in here!”

My orders echoed in the office, the silence making my temples throb. After entirely too much time, the familiar pitter-patter of paws on hardwood filled the corners of the office. *They should be grateful they even get to come in here anymore*. The coiling muscles of my leg throbbed once more, creeping closer to a painful threshold as my knee buckled, my chair catching me uncertainly. Luckily, I had no mug holding me back, my hands able to massage my leg unencumbered. My eyes drifted back toward the bloodstains, a legion of black cats suddenly occupying the space, milling about aimlessly.

“About time, you freeloaders,” I spat. “Clean the floors, the chair, and my desk. And make sure the Overnighters are PROPERLY cleaned next time. Understand?”

About half of them fixed their wide yellow eyes at me, my tone clearly sending a message. The other half continued to mill about, one especially adventurous cat attempting to vault onto the back of the recliner. As graceless as, well, me, she clung to the leather lamely, eventually spilling back onto the ground with a *THUNK*. This sent the remaining cats scattering frantically around the office, tufts of fine hair floating around from the impromptu circus act. Head in my hands, I sighed audibly as my leg repositioned itself autonomously. *And to think, Vivi gets Dogs. I wonder if they actually listen.* Seeming to read my mind, I felt a nudge against my chair as one cat meowed monotonously. I glowered at it through my fingers, his yellow eyes shining out from a puddle of black fur. I grunted, my hands yanking open a desk drawer to procure a small package of treats. I tossed a piece to the cat, expecting an indifferent satisfaction at being fed. His eyes never left mine, surprisingly, as the treat rattled onto the floor next to him.

“Mrow.”

“I literally just gave you one, Cat. What more do you want?”

He cocked its head to one side, breaking eye contact as he glanced back to the center of the room. I followed his gaze, greeted by a team of other cats lapping up Al’s discarded viscera. Not all of them, sure, but at least they’ve mostly organized themselves. *I’ll take it; at least some of them listen.* Of everything I called my own, my Cats were on the border of being disowned. I promised myself that my pride can only be given to things that did their job, no exceptions. Bloody mistakes like Al never used to happen, but lately it seemed they were losing their precision, their grace. Normally I have a pretty good idea as to why things aren’t working or who’s causing what problems; the Cat problem, however, left me stumped. *Why can’t you just do your damn jobs. Talk to me guys – what changed?* Without warning, the same cat leapt into my lap, flicking the discarded treat further into the room. He pressed his tail into my blouse stiffly, a low purr buzzing out as he forced his head into my palm. My lap stiffened at its sudden occupant, my hand lightly scratching the cat’s ears as I swiftly put the treat bag away. He hummed contentedly, eventually settling his warm black body against my cold, pale thighs. 

“Sure, just come on up why don't cha,” I cooed, trying to sound annoyed. In reality, it was a welcome gesture, my hand mindlessly stroking his black coat from head to tail. My office was now dominated by the echoes of cat tongues, scarfing up blood from the mottled floorboards. Oddly, I felt a sense of peace, something my office normally dissuades. No, not peace; the numbness surrounding me simply morphed, almost imperceptibly. Instead of its usual indifference, it took on a sort of distilled emptiness, like a snapshot of frozen time. My mind drifted back to my numb foot from this morning, the quandary left unanswered. Was my foot numb from defeat, or from emptiness? I’m still not sure which is better; whichever it was, at least it was still there, I guess.

Peace wasn’t something I was granted, I knew that well enough.

I’m not sure how much time passed, my thoughts lulled by the feline concerto. I sat transfixed in my chair, the cat in my lap purring softly. In the distant corners of my muffled periphery, I heard another bout of meowing at my side. Sat at my flank was another cat, her stormy black fur caked with streaks of red. Her tail swayed hypnotically, patches of maroon staining her nose and whiskers. At her feet was my headband, paying for my previous rage with a fresh bloodstain soaking into the felt. All at once, I blinked away my haze, checking my phone in panic. The cat in my lap hardly stirred, though, too comfortable to care. My phone blinked back at me, a pale “0800” flickering brightly. Exhaling, I set my phone down, silently embarrassed at my sudden forgetfulness. *You do this every day, Mori. You’d think you’d remember how your own office works.* Steely determination welled up inside me, willing the day to move onward. I surveyed the office, half expecting the cats to be cleaning still. Surprisingly, the space was spotless, patches of the floor still glassy from cat spit. My recliner stood confidently, the pooling red ichor thoroughly removed. The cats all sat expectantly, all covered in varying degrees of drying blood.

“Hmph. Good. Dismissed.” 

Some groomed themselves, ears flicking at some imaginary noise. Others continued sitting, head cocked to one side. At my dismissal, though, the cat in my lap rose mechanically, hopping onto my desk. It ducked into a downward dog, shaking the sleep away before staring out at the clowder. In authority, it let out a shrill meow, licked its paw mindlessly, and hopped back onto the hardwood. It slinked away, moving to the corners of the room before disappearing. Eventually the others followed, the sound of paw pads on the floor shying away until the office returned to its normal, soundless crypt. I bent over and retrieved my headband, the groans of my chair cutting through the silence. Stained as it might be, at least it would keep the hair out of my face. 

“Hello?”

Sitting back up, I blinked rapidly, a new figure now standing in front of me in an instant. A woman this time; her sallow, wrinkled skin folded over itself around her face, small hazel eyes peering out from thick framed glasses. Her matted gray hair looked like cotton candy, finger-like strands caressing her skin flaked forehead. She wore a simple blue dress with white flowers on it, hiding her shriveled frame like a rescue blanket. A floral aroma radiated from her as well, a welcome change from the metallic smell Al brought with him. She bit her lip nervously, a sliver of lipstick coming off onto her jagged yellow teeth. Stiff as a board, her eyes tried to digest what she was looking at. I opened my mouth to greet her, my phone interjecting yet again, as if its patience wore thin with each Overnighter. 

“Hello! Overnight Profile #2:

“Hello Alberta. Have a seat for me.”

“Overnighter Jama Dalal Tabale: Complete!

Remaining: 82,924 ”

I slouched low in my chair, dabbing my sweat stained makeup with a handkerchief. Eyes clamped shut, I grit my teeth and allowed the lingering sensation of Jama’s Life to pass through me. At least there haven’t been as many today, but it's not something you can just get used to. The worst is when they’re back to back, too. *Great, of course I had to jinx myself*.

As the thought exited my mind, I opened my eyes to greet my next Overnighter. My eyes didn’t find anyone, however, my empty office looking back at me. I snatched up my phone, that same pale “0800” glowing back at me. *I was pretty sure I wasn’t done; then what gives?* Righting myself in the chair, I found the recliner occupied, my confusion turning to grim realization.

“Hello! Overnight Profile #55,282:

Name: James “Jimmy” Clancey

Age: 13 years, 4 months, 12 days

Nationality: American

Religion: None

COD: Asphyxiation ”

The boy sat awkwardly, his tear stained eyes scanning over me like a cornered animal. I hastily set my phone down before lacing my fingers together, inspecting him carefully. Unlike his grandfather, he was clean, a mud brown necklace of bruises being the only evidence of his journey here. His round face still had traces of childhood in it, bits of scraggly facial hair attempting to say otherwise. Shifting in the chair at my gaze, he tried to steele his jaw in stoicism, a thin air of defiance cloaking his unease. His leg bounced anxiously, his faded t-shirt bobbing at the hem in sync. 

“Hello Jimmy,” I said, pushing errant strands of hair from my face. 

“Hey,” he wheezed.

Silence.

“My name is Mori. It’s my job to get you processed befo–”

“What’s an Overnighter?”

I faltered. I shouldn’t be surprised at the question; it isn’t like I’ve never been asked. I’ve only ever been asked at the end of processing, though. I cocked my head to the side, my eyes trying to pierce through the boy’s thoughts. “Where have you heard that?”

He shrugged. “Your phone just said it, didn’t it?”

“It said ‘Overnight,’” I replied, squinting. “Not ‘Overnighter.’”

He rolled his eyes. “Not just now. Before. Like, right before this.”

My mouth fell open, confusion wrapping around me. How would he know that? Only one Overnighter should be in this room at a time, for exactly as long as is needed to process them. Not longer, not shorter. Yet, somehow, James Clancey heard my phone talking about Jama’s message.

Weird.

I closed my mouth again, my shock flowing through me like an electrical current. *Problems for later*. Composing myself, I pursed my lips, calculating how I would answer the boy. 

“R-Right,” I continued, “Of course. An Overnighter is a term for those who die while I’m asleep.”

“Oh. Are you Death?”

I shrug. “Sure. Kinda.”

“So that means I’m dead?” His tone never changed, his teenage aloof attitude attempting to hide his uncertainty.

“Yes James. You died last night, late.”

“. . . Oh.”

“Yep. D-Do you need to process that? I can give you a second if you need.”

Silence.

“Was it Tony?”

Unsure at the question, I unfolded my fingers, carefully reaching down to adjust my chair. “I can’t answer that, I’m sorry. You could talk it out, maybe?”

He shook his head violently, his face reddening even more, tears leaking from his cloudy eyes. I expected the familiar numbness to descend over me again, but it never arrived. Maybe it was the strangeness of his prescience, maybe it was his boyish figures springing forth as he softly cried; for whatever reason, though, I felt pity. Not numbness, not even a derivation of it. The realization shook me to my core, an invisible illness bubbling in my stomach. I haven’t felt anything this empathetic in a very, very long time. Something is wrong.

I swallowed hard. “Very well. In that case, we shou–”

“Tony is one of my friends,” James interrupted, his face leaking bitter tears. “Him and Francesco would take me out driving, help me talk to girls, stuff like that. I even had a date set up too, thanks to them. Frankie was gonna teach me how to shoot better next Friday, he promised!” A stream of tears dripped silently onto his pants, his boyish features accenting his tomato red face. He sat for a moment, blinking through the tears as his mind raced. “I… I finally had friends. I was happy, I think. Now I’m dead.” A realization dawned on him, echoing his grandfather’s panic from earlier. “I’m never going to be able to talk to Kenzie again, am I?”

*I have no clue, kid.* “It isn’t something I can control. My apologies, Jimmy.”

He snorted, bits of phlegm caught in his sobs. His gaze pulled up to meet mine, a streak of confusion interrupting his anguish. “W-Why not? I mean, you’re Death aren’t you? Can’t you just–”

“It isn’t like that, James,” I groaned, my own sense of foresight interrupting him. “I can’t control that. Plain and simple.”

He slouched further into his chair, a pout blooming at his lips. He seemed to deage in my chair, an infantile tantrum threatening to burst out from him. I steeled my own emotions, the wall of numbness returning to maintain order. James understood instinctually, a chorus of whimpers joining my breathing to fill the office. I straightened in my chair, yanked open a drawer of my desk, and removed a small pouch of tissues. I offered one to the boy, his glassy eyes probing it warily. He eventually accepted it, his nose dripping rhythmically onto my floor. *Why must the Clancey’s be so messy?*

“Now,” I continued, “we need to get you processed. Unless you have any other questions, I suggest we get going. Sound good?”

He nodded weakly, his well of tears running dry. “I-I do have some questions. Is that okay?”

“Depends on the questions. I’ll answer what I can, though.”

He sucked in a ragged breath. “O-Okay. How many do I get?”

“As many as I can tolerate.”

“Deal: where are we right now?”

“My office.”

“Right but, like, where is that?”

“I call it The Halfway. Don’t think it has an official name, though. At least, I wasn’t ever told.”

He nodded slightly, digesting my answer. “Are you alive?”

“Do I look alive?”

Silence.

“U-Um, do you know Jesus?”

“I thought you weren’t Christian?”

“I’m not,” he retorted, a twinge of indignance catching on his words. “I was just curious, ya know?”

“Sure, fair enough. I’ve heard of him, yeah.”

“Oh. That’s cool. . .”

“Anything else?”

“Um. . .” He wiped his face with the crook of his sleeve, an errant streak of snot pulled tight to his cheek. “Does everyone come here?”

“If they go somewhere else, I wouldn’t know.”

“Even Babe Ruth?”

“I’m sure she did come here, yeah.”

“Wild. . . So, I really am dead? I don’t feel dead, I guess. . .”

I breathed out sharply, twinges of leg pain ripping me out of the conversation. “Yeah James. You’re dead. You died from asphyxiation.” 

“That’s from getting choked right?”

“Okay, I’ve tolerated enough,” I rasped, annoyance seeping into me through my leg pain. “Time to get you processed. First: do you, James Clancey, affirm that you died on September 19th at 23:44?”

“Y-Yes, if you say so.”

“And do you, James Clancey, wish to pass on as a Christian?”

“Absolutely not.”

My eyes tried burrowed into the boy, unable to crack through his impermeable teenage ennui. *Please, kid. At least pick one.* I was caged by my directive, though, my dissuasive thoughts left unspoken. “Very well; do you wish to pass on with any religious affiliation, then?”

“No. If you can’t do anything to help me, then whoever your boss is must be a real piece of shit.”

I bit my lip reflexively, my eyebrows knit together in frustration. “Fine. Last question: do you wish to pass on your life’s experience in order to shape future generations.”

He sat for a moment, my words seeping into him as he blinked slowly. “My life’s experience. . . well I ain’t got much to share."

“Do you want to or not, James.”

Silence.

"Fine, whatever.”

*Of fucking course.* “Very well. To complete your processing, let me borrow your hand.”

James' eyes shifted with uncertainty, his air of indifference switching to fear in a single breath. Still reclining, he raised his arm toward me in trepidation. It was as if a vacuum formed a tight bubble around us, the air all at once sucked out of the space. I licked my lips dryly, his hand dangling limply a few inches above my desk. With firm determination, I willed myself forward, my chair releasing a dull creak into the airless chamber. Despite his current condition, his hands were warm, the heat seeping into my bark-like fingertips as I took his hand in mine. I pulled his hand to my lips, kissing the sweaty veins bulging on the back of his hand. The last thing my eyes caught before sinking into blackness were inky black veins spreading across Jimmy’s face, contorting his face into a pained scowl.
