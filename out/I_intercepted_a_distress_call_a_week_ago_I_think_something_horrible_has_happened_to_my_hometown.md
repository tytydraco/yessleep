Last week I had the bright idea to fish out my dad’s old radio from the attic. I somehow managed to intercept a distress call. Today, I tried to return home only to find the roads closed off.

I wiped off years of dust and slowly lowered it down the creaking steps. Pulling it into my living room I couldn’t help but marvel at the vintage wooden casing along with its intricate brass detailing. I made sure everything was still in working order as I turned the knobs hearing them click as they went. The radio crackled to life encasing the room in a warm, fuzzy sound.

I was ready to go, sifting through station after station. The usual came through at first, all sorts of music genres, ads, local news, and above all, the radio preachers. I kept at it for a few minutes remembering how my dad and I used to always do this on the weekends when he didn’t have work. I would be sitting right next to him listening in. It was our thing, every weekend without fail. I suppose the extra time I had today reminded me of it. It was almost comforting hearing the sound of static flooding my living room once I hit an empty channel.

At least I thought it was empty until a woman’s voice came through.

*This is Dr. Emily Davis, lead scientist of the research team stationed at Emerald Bay. We are broadcasting this message to hopefully warn at least a few people. Our comm system has gone dark. The situation is dire. I believe we have started something we can’t stop.*

It paused momentarily, overtaken again by static. I was questioning if what I just heard was real or not. I know that sometimes there are storytelling programs but her voice was so full of emotion, of fear. Not to mention Emerald Bay was a small island about thirty miles off the coast from my home. Just barely inside the range of this radio. I sat up to change the channel but before a could grab the dial her voice broke through again.

*Operation Starfall, it was a success. The Dimensional Displacement Engine worked as intended, but I believe our coordinates were off somehow. We have connected with some place that definitely isn’t the parallel Earth we came in contact with the first time. What we connected to this time seems to be a realm of complete darkness. There is another problem, upon breach into this other place, a shockwave swept throughout the facility which damaged our comms along with other electrical systems. Luckily the old broadcasting radio is still somewhat functional. If our contractors are listening we need assistance immediately. Something has tethered itself to the gate and is stopping the system from closing it. Our sensors have also been picking up additional movement beyond the gate for the last thirty minutes since it opened. We have been forced to recognize the idea that something may be trying to come through. With what we have available I fear we won’t be able to stop it.*

*We have decided that igniting the remaining fuel which will hopefully take the machine out along with it. This has to be done manually, and as the lead scientist, I will be the one to stay back to accomplish this task. The others have already loaded onto the boat and are heading back to shore. I’ve gathered the proper equipment needed and will proceed with igniting the–.”*

What cut her off was something I couldn’t even begin to describe. Some sort of low groan which even to me in my living room was deafening. Sweat was beading off my forehead, if this was indeed a radio show, it was one worthy of an oscar.

*Something has breached the gate! I repeat, the gate has been breached! Some kind of dark writhing mass is pulling its way out into the station. I’m going to ignite the fuel now. I–I’ve opened the valve to dump the remaining fuel out into the room.*

That same noise interrupted her again, louder this time. The noise settled deep into my bones, a primal fear erupting inside me causing me to instinctively backpedal from the radio.

*Jesus Christ! What the hell are you? If anyone's listening, please be prepared to evacuate the area. If our contractors can hear this, we need armed assistance, now! I don’t know if this will stop it! God help us.*

Her voice was coming from off in the distance this time, but as the last sentence escaped her lips a loud boom reverberated out through the speakers followed by the radio returning back to its original fuzzy crackle. This time I wasn’t greeted same comforting sense as before. Instead, I was left sitting all alone in my living room shaking from what I had just heard. As if on cue two large helicopters flew over my house and off into the distance.

I spent the next half hour trying to calm myself down. I don’t know what was worse, the anxiety that came from not knowing what happened, or the feeling of being a fool for letting some stupid radio show get me this worked up. I was praying it was the latter.

My afternoon was spent cleaning and doing odd jobs around my house. No matter how hard I scrubbed the dishes or how many windows I shined I couldn’t get her voice out of my head. What if it was real? What if she didn’t stop it and whatever crawled out of that abyss was making its way here right now? I knew I was just being paranoid, I had to be. The same thing happens when I spend too much time watching the news convincing myself Armageddon is upon us.

I needed a drink. An old bottle of scotch I had shoved to the back of the cabinet sufficed. Sitting down with a hefty glass and some old cartoons outta do the trick. Childish I know. I flipped mindlessly through the channels trying to find something when the local weather appeared.

I paused for a moment as I checked it. The headline was. *Freak Storm Forming Off \[Redacted\] Coast.* Then they showed the radar and I watched in horror as I realized where the storm came from. Smack right down in the center was a small green dot surrounded by blue.

Emerald Bay.

That was a week ago. I left my house as soon as I saw it. Sure enough, as I loaded into my rickety pickup just barely visible over the horizon there it was. A cloud so black it seemed to absorb the light around it. I don’t think I’ve ever driven that fast in my life.

Today I finally ran out of the emergency fund that was paying for my hotel room. I tried looking online to see if my home was safe to return to. The thing is, I couldn’t find a single article about my little coastal village. Like it had been wiped from existence. How do you get rid of an entire town's online presence in a week?

I had to go see for myself. I know it probably wasn’t the greatest idea but it was either that, or plan out how I was going to survive in my truck with a broken heater. I drove the hour stretch of road to get back to my home. Before I could reach it however I came upon a roadblock.

Blacked-out SUVs with no identifiable organization plastered on. Same with the people with rifles slung over their backs. I asked them if what was going on had anything to do with what I heard over the radio. They didn’t answer my question and told me a train car had derailed with dangerous chemicals onboard. Why does a chemical spill warrant soldiers with guns?

I asked if I could at least get my things from my home but I was denied. I had no choice but to turn away. As I was leaving I peered back through my mirror to see the soldiers pile into two of the three SUVs and tear out in the opposite direction. I got back to my hotel and launched myself onto my bed, defeated.

At least I don’t think I’ll have to worry about paying for another night at this hotel because just a few minutes ago I heard that same low thunderous groan I heard over the [radio.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SoullessHQ/)
