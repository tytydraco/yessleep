Hello my name is Jack and i am a big game hunter! One day I was hunting for reindeer in Canada. I was tracking a herd when I felt someone's cold hand touch my shoulder! It scared me so I screamed and scared off the herd of reindeer.

And when I turned around, I saw a muscular man with pale blue eyes. wearing a bear's fur and its skull had a crown. I told this man “What the fuck man don’t do that” the strange man told me in a thick Australian accent “sorry a just wanted to ask you if you would like to join me on a hunt”?

I looked at this strange man and asked, “what kind of hunt”? The man said to me “one that you’ll never forget”! Then he handed me a red piece of cloth. And said “tie this around your door that means you are coming”!

Before he walked through the forest with loud thundering stomps I could still hear! When I got back to my cabin I tied the red cloth around my door knob and went to sleep. When I woke up I wasn't in my cozy log cabin bedroom. I was in a hot iron claustrophobic room. that kept being slammed by something big as water dripped in!

When I opened my door I was in a far nicer hallway. It looked like one at a 5-star hotel. There I saw a woman. She had long brown hair, a muscular body and green eyes. I walked up to introduce myself. She looked confused she said “wait there are other people going on this hunt.”

To be honest I was kind of thinking the same thing! But then another guy came out of his room. He looked younger than us and was long and lanky with short brown hair and a chubby face and green eyes. He looked confused and annoyed to see us! He said to us “who the fuck are you people”?

I said “I’m jack” the woman said sheepishly “I’m Corey” then another man came out of his room. He was big and bald with a mix of fat and muscles and brown eyes. He said “I’m toad” we all turned at him and said “hi Toad.”

I then asked the lanky man “So who are you”? He said “I am butch”! After that we heard the sound of a horn. It was coming from up the stairs at the end of the hallway. We walked up the stairs to see that we were on a yacht! And I could see the man that scared me in the woods. Now wearing lion skin and a lion skull on his head. holding a conch shell blowing into it!

As soon as the man saw us he said “i see you sleeping beauties woke up” then butch said sternly “you said it was just going to be you and me” the strange man said “no i said would you join me for a hunt”! So that seemed to shut us up!

Then the man said “would you look at that we’ve almost arrived at dante’s island”! He pointed to a large island with a huge volcano that black smoke rose out from with a dead jungle!

The strange man then said “behold the cruel stillborn god on which we feast”! Corey then whispered to me “do you know what the fuck that meant”? The man said to me and Corey “you two have a lot of nerve to talk behind my back”!

That shocked me and corey! Then the man said “do you know who i am”? Toad said “um no because you never told us”! The strange man said, “I am the Animal King”!

When we got to the island. We were given boxes containing weapons! I got a sword, Corey got an ax, toad got a spear, and butch got a trident!

The Animal King then proclaimed “from now on you are no longer human beings but creatures sent here to eradicate all the animals on this island until all creatures are gone we will be here hunting”!

After that the yacht abandoned us here on Dante's island! We were walking through the dead jungle! Following the Animal King. Toad asked me “are you enjoying the hunt so far”? I told him “I feel kinda uncomfortable”!

Then the animal king turned towards me and said “this is Dante’s island the place god abandon from the world if you feel uncomfortable then you a fucking baby”! This kinda upset me but I didn't say anything. Because my gut was telling me not to mess with this guy.

And then the Animal King stopped and climbed up a tree! Butch then yelled “why are you up there”? The Animal king started counting from 10. As loud footsteps approached us!

When the Animal King got to 0 a fucking polar bear came right at us! I was tossed to a tree hurting my back. I saw butch throw his trident into the side of the polar bear causing it to maul butch but fortunately Toad destacted it by throwing his spear at one of its legs.

But now the polar bear was charging at Toad! He climbed up a tree but the polar bear started to try breaking the tree! I then saw Corey throw me her ax and she yelled “chop that tree down Jack”! So in one fell swoop. I cut down a tree making it fall onto the polar bear!

But that didn’t kill it because it tried to get free before the Animal king shot the bear in its head, slaying the beast! And blow into the conch shell.

He then jumped out of the tree as butch with a bleeding face yell “why the fuck didn’t you shot that thing sooner”? The Animal King said “to see if you people could survive the dangers of the island”!

After that we then set up a makeshift camp with what was in the jungle. Sure it wasn’t perfect but it was better than nothing!

Weil at the campfire the Animal King brought out the polar bear meat. Toad then said “hey guys isn’t it strange how there's a polar bear out in the jungle”? to be honest i don’t know why i didn’t think about that sooner!

The Animal king then said “I'll explain everything later”! Before then putting the meat on the fire as maggots fell out of it onto the fire! I fucking gagged at that. Causing the Animal King to say “is the meat not good enough for you princess”

Corey said “stop being such a dick dude” the Animal King said “then stop being such a bitch girl” that led to Corey and the animal king not talking for the rest of the night! Currently everyone but me and the Animal King are asleep.

Now it's the next day. I heard Corey scream “that son of a bitch abandoned us”! Me and the toad woke up and the toad asked “is it butch”? Butch then came out of his tent and said grumply “I don't abandon people”!

After that we found out that the Animal King took our supplies as well! I just yelled “god fucking damn it” so we knew we were siting ducks. Then we heard the conchs mighty roar across the jungle without a moment's hesitation. We ran towards the sound.

Weil we were traversing through the jungle we noticed a human skull! Butch said “they must have got him”! Toad said “it's far too old to be his”! Then we heard a growl. I picked up a sharp rock and said “get back”!

And a bloodhound ran out of the trees! Corey laughed and said “what's a dog doing here”? Toad said “I don't know between the polar bear and the bloodhound. I'd say that someone must have put them here”!

Then butch walked up to the dog and petted it! And suddenly we now have a dog! And as me and the other hunters and the dog arrived at the scene. we saw a beheaded zebra hanging up in a tall tree leading to the volcano! The pure image of this was cruel and fucked up even for me!

We heard another roar of the conch but this time we hesitated! But the dog ran towards the sound. And we chased after him! We came in contact with a rhino. It almost killed the dog until it saw us! The rhino charged in and stabbed the side of my chest! It felt like a piece of me was torn off. Luckily I survived .

As I crawled through the tall grass I could hear the other three fighting this beast. Just then I found a hole that looked big and deep. I stood up and felt a stinging pain but that didn’t matter. I yelled at the rhino that it turned and ran at me. But luckily I could make it out in time!

I heard the others come over. all four of us and the dog made it another day! But unfortunately I could see that Toad was missing his right arm! After that we avoid the constant roaring of the conch!

After a few days we made some makeshift weapons. and bonded with the dog who we now call Troy! And after we finished tying up a knot butch heard something!

It sounded like thunder! Toad said “guys i think the volcano is going to erupt soon”? Butch said “we have to get off this island before that”! And Corey said “we can’t leave until all the animals on the island are killed”! I said “we better start hunting in the morning”!

The next day we found a shark in a small pond. It was eating an alligator! Troy was about to run in but Butch catched him! We threw our spears and killed the shark! After a few more easy kills we set up camp.

That night Butch said “i think i should explain something to you guys” ? Toad ask “what do you mean Butch”? Butch said rather somberly “I just wanted to bring up why I have been a dick lately’!

After butch said this he told us “when I was young my mother abandoned me and my sister with her father and my sister died”. Corey said “holy shit I'm sorry Butch”! Then butch said “don’t be because it was my fault my sister died”!

Toad asked “how is it your fault”? Butch said "I killed her so grampa won’t hurt her anymore”! Troy walked up to butch and laid down as Butch petted him. Corey looked like she was about to say something but didn’t.

Then two nights later as we were cooking a moose we caught we heard the conch again! Troy was scared of that sound and hid next to Butch. We saw the Animal King this time holding the heads of many animals on his belt!

When the Animal King saw Troy. he grabbed him by the tail and slammed him onto a sharp rock! Cutting him in half. Butch grabbed his man made trident and yelled “why the fuck did you do that”? The Animal King said “we came here for meat not for pets”!

Butch was about to throw his trident into the Animal King! But then the Animal king said “if you want the boat to come i wouldn’t do that”! Butch dropped his trident and picked up Troy and buried him while holding his tears.

Then the Animal King proclaimed “I have almost killed all the animals on the island weil you pussy’s were taking the easy way out now there is one left” Corey said “what animal is it”?

The Animal King said “the one who rules them all is a creature of grace and carnage, something that I admire” Butch said while crying “just tell us the animal”! The Animal king yelled “shut the fuck up Butch now i see why your mother abandoned you”!

Corey stated crying! And after that nobody talked for the rest of the night. We are now currently waiting for tomorrow. I am glad to be done hunting with this lunatic soon.

When we woke up to the sound of the conch once more. But this time the Animal king was here holding the conch and his rifle! When we all woke up he said in a satisfied australian voice “I have kept you waiting long enough today we will hunt the last animal a king who lost his peasants the mighty lion”!

As we followed the Animal King towards the volcano! I noticed more dead animals in trees without their heads. It honestly made me want to be vegan from this sight! And then the Animal King pointed towards the lion on a cliff!

He looked defeated as if he knew what was about to happen. Toad asked “do we charge towards the lion”? The animal king said “no i will have Jack shot it” i thought oh fuck to myself. Then the animal king handed me his rifle and whispered  “don’t miss jack”

I pointed the rifle at the lion as the sun illuminated the beast. And bang the lion falls onto the ground we stand on! The animal king blew into the conch shell, grabbed the lion and said "that's all 100 of the beast of danta’s island”!

Toad asked “how do you know how many animals are here”? The Animal King said back rather bluntly “I put them here”. Butch yelled “you fucking did what”? The Animal King said “because there were no animals here before I came into this world i am their god"!

As we were making our way back to the beach it started to rain. The Animal King said “we are going to wait here for tomorrow”! Toad said “sir we can handle a little rain”! The Animal King shot back “I said we wait for tomorrow”!

As we set up camp Toad asked me “do you think the Animal King might leave us on the island”? I told Toad “I don't know”! As we settled into our beds the Animal king stood by the fire smiling as he ate the lion.

When we woke up we noticed that the Animal King was gone again. Toad said “guys the Animal King abandoned us”! Before we heard the conch roar again it was ever present. And as we followed the noise I noticed just how barrion the dead jungle was!

And when we got to the beach we saw the Animal King still blowing his conch. Before he then stopped and went on the ship. As we made our way onto the ship we waited for the ship to leave danta’s island!

But it took 1 hour for us to realize something was wrong. Toad said “guys i think we should check on the captain”! We walked up to the captains quarters! It had black tinted windows and the door was unlocked.

When Butch opened up the door we saw the captain hunched in his chair facing away from us! Toad asked the captain “is everything right sir”? No response Corey walked up to the captain and she almost gagged.

Toad cried out “what did you see Corey”? Corey then turned the chair around! And we saw the captain’s corpse with his head almost cut off!

Just then I felt the Animal King's cold hand on my shoulder. He said “I see you meet Piety, our former captain”! Before he then walked over to Piety and ripped his head off! Butch yelled “why the fuck did you kill him”?

The Animal King then proclaimed “because only one of us is getting out of this alive”. And then we knew just how fucked we are! Then the Animal King said with a grin “I told you all this hunt will be one you won’t forget”!

As we backed away from the Animal King he said “I'll give y’all a 2 day head start before the manhunt so you better start running”.

We all ran off the yacht and into the dead jungle to escape this lunatic! It's night time now if you're reading this I have probably survived! But the others might not. I am scared now that I know what it feels like to be prey. I hope to god I make it out!

It was the end of the first night of our head start. we started noticing more human bones. i guess the animal king must have been luring other hunters to this fucked up island. We tried to make it to the volcano at the other end of the island!

But because of our once ignored ailments it was difficult! But then as the sun was setting and we felt the tiredness come over us we set up camp. As we tried to stay awake we felt as if we were fighting the inevitable!

Then the sun began to rise as the conch roared! And we began to hear the thundering sound of the animal king marching towards us. We began to run towards the volcano because we had nowhere else to run to.

Unfortunately Toad was gunned down by the Animal King before he then blew into the conch and  cut Toads head off and his body skinned!When Butch Corey and I made it! The air smelt like rotten eggs.and then when we almost made it halfway up the Animal King stepped out of the tree!

He was wearing Toad like he wore the lion. He was about to shoot Corey! when Butch throwed his trident at the Animal Kings arm causing him to shoot Corey in her legs instead. Then Butch told us “I'll buy you some time”! Before he then ran towards the Animal king!

Before then being grabbed and thrown on the ground and stomped on! But there was no conch. As I carried a now legless Corey climb up the volcano! The Animal King followed suit with fire in his eyes!

When we reached the edge of the volcano's mouth we had nowhere left to go! And then Corey pointed to a rock and said exhaustedly “push that rock down Jack”! I crawled towards the boulder and tried to push on it. It felt like a hot char and I also gave up but it came loose!

As it fell towards the animal king it broke into pieces and  when it hit the Animal King! He lost his grip and fell onto the jungle floor as the rock shards fell onto him intombing the Animal King. as we felt relief, we heard the volcano rumble and the smell got worse!

I picked up Corey and ran down the volcano as the lava was rising! Luckley we made it off intime and as we were running in the dead jungle I heard the Animal King scream in pain. I guess he was still alive but not anymore!

As we were running the jungle caught on fire and we almost went to flames with it! But we found the beach although we had some slight burns. As we got on the Yacht we heard the Conch one last time!

As we wore out at sea Corey got worse! and I tried to save her life. Then one night she said to me “Jack I don't think I will make it, so can I tell you something”? I said while almost crying “sure”! Corey told me “i was Butch’s mom” i asked Corey “why did you abandon Butch”?

Corey said “I thought that I could trust my dad”! She then said “if i die i’ll allow you to eat me”! The next day I found Corey’s body and she killed herself with her ax! For the next few weeks I would not touch her body!

But the yacht ran out of food so I had to eat her to survive! After 2 months out at sea I ran out of her body. And after 2 more days I think I see land. but i might just have scurvy.
