Injured

Those days, I used to live near the mountains, surrounded by fog and mist. It was a testament to the Earth's remarkable geological activity that gives rise to such beautiful landscapes. Its ability to create through destruction made me realize that destruction may also bring hope.

There was a dirt road nearby. Its markings captured the movements of vehicles that time had once pushed forward, leaving behind not just tracks but memories. The road was still there, unchanged, reminding me of my father, with whom I had shared my last coffee on a Wednesday.

Then time happened, as it always does, and I lost him. Time won again, turning a happy, healthy man, whose voice once roared like a lion’s, into a mere memory. Time had become my enemy, transforming the physical into recollection, the solid into echoes.

My belief in God was never constant. One day I would argue for His existence, the next I would deny it. My father’s death wasn’t a small incident. It shook my entire life, even affecting my job. The void he left behind devoured everything, like a black hole consuming matter.

All I could think about was healing; spiritual healing; as a way to escape the mental agony. That’s when I remembered my friend Adrian, who lived in Brazil. He often posted about spiritual healing on Facebook and would frequently tag me. One post talked about how a timely meeting with a spiritual healer could change everything.

Adrian hadn’t become a healer by choice. He was made one; by time and by suffering. He lost his parents at the age of eight. Though he went on to live with his grandparents and uncle, the real shift came after his wife's death. He couldn't bear it. He withdrew for months, isolated and broken, until he met a spiritual healer who directed him towards the path to peace; the very path that not just heals but takes away the scars chiseled by time within us. And eventually he transformed into a spiritual healer himself. He once wrote, **"The 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami completely changed me. It showed me how fragile life is. My wife’s death was just one of the many tragedies this world endures."**

I wanted to reach out to him earlier, but I kept putting it off. And slowly, time triumphed again. It made me forget the roar, the laughter, the man himself. But the agony remained. Because time may take away what’s tangible, but it always leaves behind imprints.

A year later, on that same forgotten road; the one less traveled; I met with a terrible accident. I broke my neck and was temporarily unable to walk. The pain was twofold: physical and mental. And with that came the knocking of old memories; my father’s death, and all the comforting thoughts that had turned into haunting ones. It became threefold, more unbearable than ever.

A month passed, and I recovered. But the scars didn’t. Time is strange. It takes away moments, but never the scars. The imprints remain, carved into memory. And the worst part? Whether a memory is joyful or painful, it haunts just the same.

Eventually, things began to improve. A ray of hope pierced through the darkness. I started a small business. It turned out to be profitable, not just financially but spiritually. It cast a shadow over the wounds that time had left behind.

During this time, I recalled the moments I cherished with my father rather than his death. I was trying to look at the positive side of life, letting the scars left by time sob in ignorance.

But there’s only one thing that’s unchanging: change itself. And change is nothing but a synonym for challenge. With change comes a new challenge, and three months later, it did. Once again, time betrayed me.

I was diagnosed with a terminal illness. That news shattered me. It didn’t just hurt; it drained the life out of me. It was time's way of asserting dominance once again, its reminder of the prowess it carries.

The illness together with past traumas left me with no choice but to seek Adrian’s help. I was hopeful if not determined.

He was based in Brazil, about 50 miles from the Amazon rainforest. After a 12-hour flight, I finally met him. He looked troubled, as if something heavy weighed on his mind.

“You’re late. Too late, actually,” Adrian said, staring at me while puffing on a thick, black cigar.

“But why?” I asked, my voice shaking.

“You’re here because of your suffering, right? But you shouldn’t have come at its peak. Now, it’s not me who can help you. It’s **Zimazari**. Only he can.”

**“Zimazari?”** I repeated.

“Yes. The man who helped me with my pain. Just a month before the Indian Ocean tsunami, I met him. After that, my agony vanished.”

"He doesn't speak, but you'll hear him, he doesn't see but you'll feel his gaze, he doesn't hear, but he'll know what you want to talk about"

The cigar smoke made me cough.

“And where do I find him?” I asked.

“You don’t. Just head into the forest. Walk a mile in, then call his name. He’ll come running; naked. Shame, fame, money, lust; none of that matters to him. He’s risen above it all. So don’t be startled by how he appears.”

And so I left.

The forest was eerily silent, as if it were listening to my thoughts. After walking more than a mile, I shouted his name. Then I heard footsteps; someone running towards me.

**It was him. Tall and thin, with a beard that touched his navel. His eyes, gray and fiery, seemed to glow. His hair fell below his waist. His fingernails were long, curved, almost unnatural.**

He didn’t speak, but I heard him inside my head: “Follow me.”

We walked deeper into the jungle. Eventually, he stopped at a crater-like opening in the ground. Its bottom wasn’t visible; just a deep, dark void. It looked like a black hole. Vast and Terrifying. I screamed, but the echo was too loud to bear.

Zimazari lit a torch and closed his eyes. My eyes shut on their own. Then I heard his voice inside my head again, chanting something in an unfamiliar language. The chant continued for nearly an hour. I felt the weight of my suffering slowly lift, as though it were leaking out of me.

When I opened my eyes, Zimazari threw the torch into the hole, and the crater sealed itself.

**“Leave this place now,”** I heard once more in my head. Then he vanished.

I ran through the forest, shaken but strangely at peace. For the first time in years, I felt free, like all my grief had been washed away.

I returned to Brazil, then back home. Everything felt fine. Better than fine. I was happy.

But not for long.

**A month later, I heard about a devastating volcanic eruption that claimed thousands of lives. At first, I ignored it. But something about it nagged at me.**

And then I remembered what Adrian had told me. After he met Zimazari, the 2004 tsunami happened. And now this eruption.

Something wasn’t right.

I called Adrian.

“David,” he said as soon as he answered. “I know why you’re calling. The volcano…”

“You knew?” I asked.

“David, you’re free now, aren’t you? But freedom always comes with a cost. You felt the ground shake, didn’t you? That wasn’t just you."

“You never told me. I didn’t ask for this,” I said. “You may have become a monster, but I’m not. I know the tsunami was your fault. And now this… You became a healer just to atone for what you did.”

“David, I helped you,” he said, disturbingly calm."
"I didn’t want to tell you, David. I couldn’t. After the tsunami… I swore I’d never send anyone else to him. But you were drowning.” he ended.

I couldn’t breathe. The weight of this truth was crushing.

“I don’t want to live with this,” I said. “It’s suffocating.”

“This is how you create another agony,” Adrian replied. “More painful than the ones you’ve endured. What’s done can’t be undone. Learn to live with it.”

**It was in that moment I realized: Zimazari's healing reaches the the earth's core, creating strong vibrations that trigger catastrophic disasters.**

And it meant time never betrayed me. It wasn’t the enemy. I was. Time’s scars may never fade, but trying to undo them might leave you with even deeper ones, from which the pus of regret forever oozes.

And despite all the healing, I still remain **injured.**
