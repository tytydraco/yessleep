‘What’s wrong?’ cried the girl. 



‘It’s locked!’ I shouted. ‘Or rusted shut or—’



I leapt from the ladder, just barely missing the Brittle Man’s as it collided with the wall. A cloud of debris rushed over us. My hand found my mouth, suppressing a cough as the shadow of that decrepit monster wheeled about, this way and that, searching for its cornered prey in the haze of dust. 



And that’s when I spotted the light in the ceiling. 



It was bright, almost blinding, and all of it was pouring from the blown-open hatch. 



‘He smashed it apart!’ I said, triumphant. 



The boy gave my an encouraging thump on the back. ‘Now’s your chance. Don’t mess it up.’



I bit my lip. 



The ladder was broken, annihilated. And the ceiling hatch was far too high to reach without it. All that meant I had one option, and I couldn’t afford to contemplate the insanity of it. 



I bolted forward, into the smokescreen, into the jaws of certain death. 



My feet left the ground. I threw myself onto the Brittle Man’s back, clambering up his spine. He reached an arm around, that grotesque heart hissing and snarling, but I was too quick, my body supercharged with adrenaline. 



I leapt—reaching for the lip of the hatch. 



Caught it.



I pulled myself up with a grunt and a heave. The Brittle Man’s fingernails scraped the bottom of my boots as I lurched into the room, scrambling forward until I came up against a desk. 



My chest ached with panic. But I’d made it. 



I’d managed to squirrel myself up into the top of the lighthouse, to the heart of the nightmare itself. I squinted, shading my eyes. Countless lanterns lined the walls, each glowing with a a pale aura, each being fed by a tube from a center console. 



‘That’s the innocence. It’s where all our purity gets feed into the lighthouse, and distributed to help cage the Beast.’



I turned, shocked to see the boy standing before me in his shorts and t-shirt. 



 ‘How’d you make it up here? The ladder was blown apart.’



‘Didn’t need it,’ he said with a shrug. ‘Perks of being dead. Can go pretty much anywhere, just so long as it isn’t protected by magic. Or iron. And you managed to take care of of the wards, and the Brittle Man took care of that hatch. So now the whole lighthouse is fair game.’



He laughed, blinking out of existence before reappearing at my opposite side. ‘Kinda neat, huh?’



‘Quit messing around,’ snapped the girl, fizzing into view beside him. ‘This isn’t over yet. We still need to deal the finishing blow. Your rifle,’ she said, addressing me. ‘You’ll have to shoot the Beast. It’s up there. You see it?’



I swallowed, gazing at a platform overhead. There, a flame burned without a glow. It looked ordinary, but it felt cosmic, terrifying and unknowable, like something that had been caged for eons. It reminded me of a black hole. 



I nodded uneasily. 



‘What is this place?’ I croaked, looking around at walls lined with bookcases. ‘It doesn’t look like much of a prison. It looks more like a study.’



‘Two things can be true at once,’ said the girl. ‘This is where the Groundskeeper learned how to keep the Beast caged. Now end this. Shoot the damn thing.’



I rose, legs quivering as the Brittle Man slammed against the floorboards below. He was too big to get in—and for now at least, the structure was holding. I reached around my back for my rifle. 



Then paused. 



A red book caught my eye. It sat open on the desk, pages scribbled in looping handwriting. A journal. 



‘Was this his?’ I asked. 



The girl blocked my path, face a mask of defiance. ‘You can read it when you’re done.’



I frowned. 



‘I want to read it now.’



The floorboards rippled like a tsunami wave. The Brittle Man snarled. His arm erupted through the floor, yellowed nails sweeping this way and that, tearing apart a series of bookcases in a flurry of parchment. 



He’d get in before long. Maybe minutes. Maybe seconds. 



It didn’t matter—the children were still hiding something from me. I could feel it. Their story felt incomplete, with too many unanswered questions, too many missing details. 



‘Don’t worry,’ I said, brushing past the girl and snatching the journal. ‘I won’t be long.’



It was a risk, that much I knew. And not just for my life, but for my soul—and the souls of every last child hanging in this twisted wood, Charlie’s included. And that’s why I couldn’t cut corners. I had to know what I was dealing with here, what the true scope of this horror story was. 



But deeper than all of that was the fact that I recognized the journal. In some ways, it reminded me of my own. And so by the absent of the Beast’s flickering flame, I read a nightmare worse than any I could dream. 



\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



**182nd Day, 41st Year of Light**



*I have sinned.*



*My brother is dead. I killed him with a stone.*



*I was jealous, for the Stranger seemed to prefer him to me. My parents refuse to speak to me. I can not blame them, for now that the fire of rage has passed, I miss my brother dearly. I see now that he was a good man. A much better one than I.* 



**184th Day, 41st Year of Light**



*The Stranger has offered me penance.* 



*He says I may join him in his Garden, and serve as its Groundskeeper. He believes the purity of this place will help cleanse the darkness from my heart, the same way it once cleansed the darkness from his. He tells me we must forgive ourselves of our failures, but I fear a thousand years could not heal my heart.* 



*I miss my brother.*



*Abel is dead because of me.* 



\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



A deafening roar, and more floorboards collapsed beneath the Brittle Man’s assault. The girl’s face twisted with terror, with rage. ‘Hurry! Shoot the fucking Beast before that monster turns all of our souls inside out!’



And she was right. 



Even the boy, typically carefree to a fault, was pacing anxiously. The sensible thing seemed to be to unsling my rifle, to shatter that glass cage and put this horror behind us for good. But there wasn’t anything sensible about the Crooked Wood. 



And there wasn’t anything sensible about this journal. The way it beckoned to me, compelling me to turn the page, to lose myself in those words that felt familiar enough I could’ve written them myself. 



I had to know how this story began—how the Beast came to be. 



I had to know what became of the Stranger.



And how the Groundskeeper lost his life. 

**\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_**

  


**August 5th, 1942**



*I have done as I was asked.* 



*The lighthouse is built, though I question its workmanship. I am no carpenter. Still, the Stranger appears satisfied. I know this by the sketch he drew, the same way I know that he built the lighthouse not to illuminate the garden, but as a prison for a light that does not glow.* 



*I asked him what it was, this bizarre flame, and he told me it once belonged to him. He had carried it for eons. Yet he could no longer bear to suffer its weight, for it had made him weary, and full of wrath.* 



*‘How long,’ I asked, ‘must the Garden endure it while you rest?’*



*He did not answer. Merely turned, and walked back into the dark of the leaves.* 

  
  
  


**December 13th, 1952**



*I toss and turn, unable to find rest.* 



*It’s the lighthouse, I know it is. It’s that thing the Stranger sealed in the top of this tower. It haunts me while I sleep, constricting my heart of all hope and breathing hatred into my love.* 



*He calls it the Beast.* 



*It reminds me of the way I felt all those years ago, when I bashed Abel’s brains in with the stone. It reminds me of the emptiness I felt, then. The absence. I had no meaning, no joy, and no belonging. It was a feeling worse than death.*



*Now I taste it with my every breath.* 



**January 1st, 0001**



*It has been nearly a year since the Beast was chained. It whispers to me, at night. It whispers to the children too, and the guardian, and even the plants.* 



*I see it in the way the flowers wither, in the way the trees narrow and reach toward the skull-black sky. Even the Guardian, once an ageless titan of grace, has grown decrepit. His wings are now torn. His flaming sword, extinguished. He has grown sallow and long, his flesh mottled with rot, and the children have taken to calling him the Brittle Man behind his back.*



*I wonder what they will call me when the nightmare slithers beneath my skin.* 



**February 64th 2731**



*The Stranger will not answer my pleas for aid. I worry he is avoiding me, that he has abandoned his Garden to the Beast. There is something about this creature that unnerves him.* 



*Perhaps, even terrifies him.* 



***ENTRY 4242***



*The so-called Brittle Man is dead.* 



*I brought him to the lighthouse to destroy the Beast, but by the time he neared that cosmic nightmare, he’d already collapsed, his flesh atomizing to less than dust. He evaporated there, on the floor beneath that flame that does not glow, and I had no choice but to run.*



*Still, the Beast’s laughter echoes in my mind.*



**ENTRY# 4242**



*The Garden is a shell of itself. The Beast consumes more of its beauty each day, its influence leaking from the walls of that lighthouse like a virus. It devours light. It devours hope. It is the antithesis of life, and I fear it may soon reach beyond the Garden and bring all of creation to ruin.* 



*I must take matters into my own hands.* 



*There are tomes I have uncovered. Ancient ones. They are said to contain spells, witchcraft that might mutilate a soul just to think of, and yet I am without another option. The Brittle Man is dead. The Garden withers.* 



*It is up to me to stall the Beast until the Stranger returns.* 

  


**SUFFERINGSORROWGUILT**



*The books describe a ritual, one that might allow the creation of a new guardian—a new Brittle Man. It will take time, of course. And a willing vessel, but a child has agreed.* 



*I’ll hang her later this evening.* 



**KILLEDMYBROTHERWITHMYBAREHANDS**



*Already, the Beast has stolen the sun from the sky. Its horror leaks beyond the children’s corpses. It’s their heads, I think. His essence crawls through the leylines and spills out their eyes, their mouths, as these are doorways to the soul.* 



*To be safe, I will ensure tomorrow’s batch are hung without their heads.* 

  


***???????????***



*It worked! The Brittle Man has ripened, and not a moment too soon.* 



*I’ve found a means of protecting this one* *from the fate of its predecessor, too. The tomes referenced a coat of flesh, one sewn from the sinew of innocence. It won’t take long to thread. I need only harvest the children’s smiles.* 

  


**Bleeding, 3413**

 

*Hopeless.*



*It is hopeless.* 



*Not even the coat allowed the Brittle Man to get close enough to destroy the Beast. I’ve inspected the other children hanging from the vines, but none are ripening into fresh Brittle Men. Their corpses have begun to rot. Their souls, it seems, are being consumed by the Beast.* 



*I am too old, too tainted to become a Brittle Man. But perhaps my son. His light may yet be strong enough to ripen, though I would sooner lose the whole cosmos than my boy.* 

*\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_*



The lighthouse shuddered.



The floorboards splintered, cracking in a widening tapestry of destruction before collapsing entirely. Half the study crumbled into rubble below. I stood, staring over the edge of the desk as a monster with a butcher rasp wrenched itself upward, crawling up onto the remains of the hardwood floor. 



And there, in the light of those dimming lanterns, I saw the noose around the Brittle Man’s neck. 



No…



Not a noose, but a vine. It fed into his throat, an umbilical cord the Garden had used to pour its power into him, the Groundskeeper’s macabre attempt at creating a new guardian from the corpses of children, a being that might be powerful enough to stand against the Beast. 



The girl swept backwards, shrouding herself beneath shadow of a bookcase The boy stood petrified at my side. I thought for a moment about running, but where would I go? We were trapped, all of us, and yet it didn’t seem to matter.



The Brittle Man—Charlie—wasn’t focused on us. 



No, he was lurching toward that ghostly flame that cast no light. He stalked forward on all fours, his black heart rasping, tattered rabbit’s head hanging limp to the side. 



‘Jesus,’ I whispered. ‘He’s dying.’



And he was. 



Charlie kept moving, his limbs creaking louder, his breath becoming more ragged with each lumbering step. The decaying flesh beneath his coat of faces was already beginning to flake away, disintegrating behind him like a black snow. 



The Beast was killing him. Just like it’d killed the other Brittle Men. 



‘Charlie!’ I shouted, racing around the desk. ‘Don’t come any closer! You can’t—’



Crack. 



His right arm snapped beneath him, the bone no longer able to support his immense weight. He crashed to the floor. Gasping. Wheezing. Struggling to force himself upright, a tortured whine pouring from the heart throbbing behind his ribs. 



‘Save him,’ urged the girl. ‘Destroy the Beast. End this!’



Instinctively, I reached around for my rifle, but again something stopped me. It felt maddening. Insane. The girl had laid it all out for me, hadn’t she? Shatter the glass. Extinguish the flame. It seemed so simple, and maybe that’s why I felt such horrible suspicion. 



The journal. 



It spoke about the Beast being sealed, about the Groundskeeper’s attempts to destroy it failing time and time again. Something didn’t add up here. If stopping the Beast was as easy as taking potshots at its glass cage, then the Groundskeeper would have surely tried it. 



No. The only thing shooting that cage would do is…



‘So,’ I said, turning to face the children, my eyes darkening. ‘This is what it’s been about all along, isn’t it? You didn’t bring me here to destroy the Beast. You brought me here to free it.’



The boy did his trademark laugh. Tried to wave it away. But I could see by the tremor in his voice, by the stutter in his words that he was caught in another lie. I’d seen the Beast. I’d felt it as a boy, back when the Stranger showed Charlie and I the future that awaited us should it ever break free. 



‘All along,’ I snarled. ‘You’ve both been working for the Beast.’



‘Wrong again,’ said the girl, jabbing a finger at the journal. ‘Did you even read what it said? Children hanging from trees. Corpses rotting to nothing. It’s over, okay? All of it. The Beast has won. It’s going to escape this Garden whether we like it or not.’



The boy sighed. ‘Yeah. The Stranger couldn’t bottle the Beast. The Brittle Man couldn’t kill it. Not even the crazy magic the Groundskeeper found could keep it in check for very long.’ He gazed down at his feet, almost ashamed. ‘We failed, man. We lost.’



I shook my head, refusing to believe it. ‘No. There has to be another way.’



The Brittle Man gave a weak gasp. His yellowed fingernails dug into the hardwood, dragging him forward, even as its flesh fell away in a dark mist. His button-eye gaze was transfixed on the lightless flame. The Beast. 



Of course.



This was what he’d been made for. To stop the Beast. All along, he was only trying to kill us because he knew the children intended to free the abomination. Now that he was here, he wanted to try his hand at killing it himself. 



Only he was sorely outmatched. 



My friend—Charlie—was losing this fight.  



‘He wants to kill it,’ the boy said quietly. ‘Only he can’t. Nothing can.’



Tears welled in my eyes. 



My feet started forward. The girl shouted at me, warning me away, saying it was too dangerous and that if I died I’d ruin everything, but I didn’t give a damn. My knees hit the hardwood. I wrapped my arms around that coat of skin, hugging tight the monster that had once been my best friend in the entire world.  



‘I’m sorry,’ I told him, tears pushing from my eyes. ‘I’m so sorry...’



The boy placed a hand on my shoulder, oddly solemn. ‘You should be proud, really. He’s the last Brittle Man. The only one that managed to ripen after the Beast poisoned the rest of the harvest. But that means after him, it’s finished. There won’t be another. Once he goes, there’ll be nothing left in this Garden to stand against the Beast.’



I wiped at my eyes, rage and grief fighting in my voice. ‘Then why not just wait it out? Why go out of your way to set the bloody thing free?’



“Because we made a deal,” the girl said, not moving from the shadows. ‘With the Beast.’



I stared at her, too stunned to speak. 



‘I mean…’ said the boy, sauntering forward with flushed cheeks. ‘Technically it wasn’t us that made the deal. It was the Groundskeeper. He saw the writing on the wall—that the Stranger had fled, that the garden was all but dead, that we were down to our last Brittle Man. He figured the war was over. That we’d lost. The best we could hope for was to negotiate terms of surrender.’



‘Then the Groundskeeper was mad!’ I spat. ‘Or evil!’



Probably both.



The Brittle Man whimpered, his hand grasping upward, trying desperately to reach the Beast’s pale flame. It broke my heart. Charlie, even while turning to ashes, still wanted to stop that abomination, even if it meant losing his own life. 



That’s how I knew he was still in there—my old friend.



‘The Groundskeeper isn’t to blame,’ the girl said. ‘He was left an impossible task, and he did what he had to do—for all of us. All of humanity.’



I gave a short laugh, bitter and derisive. 



‘Don’t believe me?’ snapped the girl. ‘Then read it for yourself. It’s right there, all over the last page.’



I swallowed, looking down at the journal in my grip. 



Goosebumps dance across my skin. I opened it up, finding a page that looked different than the others. The ink on it looked fresh, like it was written mere hours ago, and the paper was speckled with what might have been tears. 



My eyes widened. 



The printing on this page, it was so much messier than the others. It looked haphazard, scribbled, like it’d been written by a man at the bottom of a bottle. 



It looked like my handwriting. 



‘What’s the matter?’ said the girl, advancing on me. ‘Read it. You said you wanted the truth, and there it is. Just don’t say I didn’t warn you.’



My stomach twisted with nausea, with guilt. I stared at the words, and all at once I was overcome with an inescapable feeling that somehow, someway, this whole ordeal was my fault. 



But the Charlie was dying. The stairwell below had been destroyed. There was nowhere for me to run, nowhere for me to hide, and so I pushed down my horror, and I read the last words the Groundskeeper wrote. 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



**January -3rd ????**

  
  


*The Stranger is hiding. Or dead.*



*To be honest, I no longer care, for he is a coward and a hypocrite. Long ago, he asked me to serve this Garden for the murder of my brother, but where is he now when that he has sinned? Where is his service?* 



*This Beast, this darkness… it belongs to him. It is his sin. Yet he leaves it to us to carry.* 



**MAKEITSTOPMAKEITSTOPMAKE**



*I saw him briefly, six months ago. The Stranger.*



*It was in the woods with my son, at the border between worlds. He saw my pain, just as he did when I murdered Abel. I know this because he did what he could to ease my son’s fear. It is the only reason I didn’t attack him, that I didn’t take the stone to him as I had my brother.* 



*But I wish I had.*



*For now my son is lost to me, another Brittle Man ripening upon the vine.* 



*The last guardian of this Crooked Wood.*



**June 66th, 6666**



*The end has come.* 



*My boy proved to be the most powerful of all the guardians, even the original who had been forged from the Stranger’s light. Yet even he has begun to crumble. The war is over. The Beast has won. It seems desperate to expand, to suffocate the cosmos, so I have offered it terms.* 



*I said I would set it free in exchange for a delay of execution—that when it smothers all light in this universe, it will come for humanity last of all.* 



*And it agreed.*



*Now I prepare to set out, to inform what children remain in this Crooked Wood that their souls will soon be released. They’ll be free to travel home. To earth. To find what joy they can before the light finally fades from creation for good.* 



*I only pray the Brittle Man will forgive me.*  



*\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_*



I frowned, re-reading the final passage. 



‘So that’s it then,’ I muttered. ‘The Groundskeeper signed away the whole of the universe to some eldritch god, and now it’s up to me to make good on his bargain.’



I tossed the journal aside, indignation boiling inside me. ‘How’s that fair? He should be the one pulling the trigger—not me. It isn’t fair, you hear me. I don’t care if the asshole’s dead. You can’t ask me to do this.’



‘Of course it’s fair,’ said the girl. 



My anger boiled over. ‘Oh, shut it. It’s not you pulling the trigger. That’s why you found me, isn’t it? Back there. At the edge of the wood. You saw my rifle and figured I was just what you needed to damn the whole fucking universe to complete annihilation, somebody who could shoulder the guilt while you sat and watched.’



‘Not exactly,’ said the boy.



I glared at him, seething. 



He sighed. ‘The Groundskeeper did just as he said he would. He set out through the trees, informing all the children that their souls would soon be set free. Only by the time he reached the edge of the Crooked Wood, he’d only found two souls remaining.’



Of course. The boy. The girl.



They were all that remained of Eden’s children. 



‘And the Groundskeeper? How’d he die?’



The boy rubbed his arm, uncomfortable. ‘Not sure. He sort of got lost on the way.’



‘Lost?’ I exclaimed. ‘How’s a bloody groundskeeper get lost on their own grounds?’



‘Woah, don’t blame me,’ the boy said, raising his hands defensively. ‘Blame the Beast. It darkens everything in this place. The Garden. The sky. Even our minds. The Groundskeeper negotiated it with it for hours, and even at a distance it still managed to turn his head into mush. By the time he’d made it to the edge of the Crooked Wood, his memory had gotten more scrambled than eggs.’



The girl’s eyes flashed, rounding on me. ‘That’s right. Hell, it was bad enough that he couldn’t even remember his name. Or that he’d ever been the Groundskeeper.’



I stumbled backward, heart thundering. It couldn’t be. The way she was talking, the thing she was implying…

There was no way. 



‘You said it yourself,’ the girl said. ‘Your friend met the Stranger the day the Brittle Man stole him. Charlie, that’s what you called him. Only you’re getting parts of your life confused. Going to prison for your friend’s murder? Never happened. You only went to prison for your brother’s murder—that is, if you can call this garden a prison.’



She kept stalking forward, her voice dripping with revelation. 



‘If I had to guess, your mind probably played a trick to spare you the overwhelming guilt of it all,’ she continued. ‘You brought Charlie here. Offered him to Eden. Charlie—the person you cared about more than anyone. It turned you into a raging drunk, you know. You’d drink yourself to sleep night after night, and it got so bad we weren’t sure if you were dying from the Beast, or the Booze.’



My back came up against a bookcase. The girl marched forward, cornering me, eyes blazing with contempt. Her finger stabbed against my chest. 



‘You told yourself Charlie died decades ago. That you were powerless to understand what happened to him. But he didn’t. He died six months ago, and it wasn’t the Brittle Man that carved off his head. It was you.’



I collapsed, shaking, gripping fistfuls of my hair in a horrified panic. 



No.



The word kept ricocheting around my skull. 



No. No. No. NO. 



The girl bent down, forcing me to meet her gaze. ‘Charlie wasn’t your friend, Cain. He was your *son*.’
