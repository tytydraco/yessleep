I’ve been a Cleaner at the Association for six years now, and in that time, I’ve seen my fair share of strange and horrifying things. I still can’t decide what’s worse—the half-decayed corpses of creatures that shouldn’t exist or the Wardens, walking around freely, who can transform into absolute monsters in the blink of an eye. But the strangest, most unsettling experience of my life didn’t involve blood or gore. It involved a series of conversations I’ll never forget.

It happened during my routine rounds on the containment floor. For those unfamiliar, the containment floor is where the Association keeps aberrations that can’t be destroyed—or at least, not easily. Some are there because they’re too valuable to eliminate, others because killing them would have consequences we’re not prepared to deal with. Cell 113 belonged to the latter category.

We don’t know what the thing in Cell 113 is, not exactly. It’s humanoid, but only vaguely. It sits at the center of its cell, shrouded in shadows that shouldn’t exist, and it never moves. Its containment protocols are strict: no direct contact, no more than three Cleaners in the vicinity at once, and under no circumstances are we allowed to stand in front of its viewing window for more than thirty seconds. The official reason is “prolonged exposure may lead to psychological contamination.”

Most Cleaners avoid Cell 113 altogether. I didn’t have that luxury. My job that day was to sanitize the hallway directly in front of its cell, which had been flagged for maintenance due to an unexplained dampness seeping from the walls. I tried to work quickly, scrubbing at the dark stains on the floor and muttering to myself to break the silence. That was my first mistake.

“You’re quite the chatterbox, aren’t you?”

The voice stopped me cold. It was deep and resonant, like it came from everywhere and nowhere at once. I turned my head toward the cell, my heart pounding. The thing in Cell 113 had never spoken before, as far as I knew. The viewing window was dark, and I couldn’t see anything beyond the faint outline of its hunched form.

“I’m not supposed to talk to you,” I said, breaking rule number one of containment: don’t engage.

“Ah, but you already are,” it replied, a hint of amusement in its tone. “Tell me, do they ever tell you why you’re not supposed to linger here?”

I didn’t answer. Instead, I focused on my work, scrubbing harder at a particularly stubborn stain. My hands were trembling, though, and I’m sure it noticed.

“They’re afraid of what you might hear,” it continued. “Of what I might tell you. They think ignorance will protect you.”

“It’s not my job to know anything,” I said, my voice barely above a whisper.

“Oh, but ignorance is such a fragile thing, isn’t it? So easily shattered.”

I should have walked away then. I should have dropped my mop and left the hallway without looking back. But something about its voice—smooth and almost hypnotic—rooted me in place. Against my better judgment, I glanced toward the viewing window.

The darkness inside seemed to shift, like the shadows were alive. And then I saw them: two pinpricks of light, faint and golden, like distant stars. Eyes. They were looking directly at me.

“You have questions,” it said, its tone softening. “I can feel them, pressing against your mind. Ask.”

I shook my head. “I don’t have questions. I just want to finish my job.”

“Liar,” it said, and for a moment, its voice was sharp enough to cut. “You wonder why they keep me here, why they’re so afraid of me. You wonder what I am.”

It was right, of course. But I didn’t dare admit it.

“Do you know what fear tastes like?” it asked, its voice dropping to a whisper. “Yours is bitter, but not unpleasant. You’re afraid of me, yes, but you’re more afraid of what your curiosity might cost you. A wise fear, but misplaced.”

My hands tightened around the mop handle. “I need to finish my work.”

“Of course you do. But before you go, a gift.”

I froze, dread pooling in my stomach. “I don’t want anything from you.”

The thing chuckled—a low, vibrating sound that seemed to rattle the walls. “Want has little to do with it. Gifts are obligations, Cleaner. And this one is… harmless. For now.”

Against my will, I found myself stepping closer to the cell, the mop still in my trembling hands. I wanted to stop, to turn and run, but my legs felt like they were moving on their own. The golden pinpricks of its eyes bore into me, and for a moment, I thought I saw shapes in the shadows—twisting, writhing forms that seemed to press against the glass.

“Look at the floor,” it murmured, its voice barely audible yet impossible to ignore.

I hesitated, then glanced down. There, at the base of the viewing window, was a small puddle of the same dark dampness I’d been cleaning. But this one was different. It wasn’t just water—it shimmered faintly, like oil on asphalt under the sun.

“What is this?” I asked, my voice trembling.

“A piece of me,” it said. “A token of our… conversation. Take it, or leave it. But know this: the choice you make will shape the path ahead.”

“No,” I whispered, taking a step back. “I’m not taking anything from you.”

The thing laughed again, louder this time, the sound echoing down the hallway. “Wise, perhaps. But wisdom does not always shield you from consequence.”

I turned and fled, leaving the mop and bucket behind. The shadows seemed to cling to me as I ran, stretching unnaturally long down the corridor. By the time I reached the elevator, my chest was heaving, and my hands were shaking so badly I could barely press the button to take me back up.

When I returned to the maintenance office, the supervisor gave me a funny look. “You didn’t finish the job?” he asked, glancing at the bucket in my hands, still full of dirty water.

“I… something came up,” I muttered, avoiding his gaze.

He frowned but didn’t press me. “Fine. But you’re on containment duty again tomorrow. Same area.”

My stomach dropped. I wanted to argue, to refuse, but I knew it would only draw more attention. And the last thing I needed was for anyone to know what had happened—or worse, what I’d heard.

That night, sleep refused to come. Every creak of my apartment seemed louder than usual, every shadow longer and darker than it had any right to be. The faint hum of the refrigerator felt oppressive, and I caught myself glancing at corners of the room like something might emerge from them. I told myself it was just my imagination, that the thing in Cell 113 wasn’t capable of reaching me outside its containment.

But the whisper lingered in my mind: *“The choice you make will shape the path ahead.”*

When my shift started the next day, I avoided the containment floor for as long as I could. I scrubbed bathrooms, took out trash, and even volunteered to clean the cafeteria—anything to keep me far away from that corridor. But eventually, my supervisor found me, clipboard in hand and a scowl on his face.

“Hall 6C,” he said. “You left it a mess yesterday, and you’re on containment duty. No excuses.”

I wanted to argue, to tell him to send someone else, but the words died in my throat. I nodded and grabbed my supplies, feeling like I was marching to my own execution.

The hallway was exactly as I’d left it: dark, damp, and humming with an unnatural stillness. The stains on the floor had spread slightly, and the air felt thick, heavy, like it was pressing against my chest. The corridor was silent except for the faint buzz of the overhead lights, but I could feel its presence, awake and watching.

I tried to work quickly, keeping my head down and my movements efficient. The rules were simple: don’t look into the cell, don’t engage. But then it spoke.

“You returned.”

Its voice stopped me in my tracks, smooth and resonant, echoing like it came from all directions at once. It wasn’t the kind of voice you could ignore—it reached into you, demanded attention.

I didn’t respond, gripping the mop tighter and focusing on scrubbing the floor.

“Silent today? That’s disappointing,” it said, with a hint of amusement. “I thought we were making progress.”

“I’m just here to do my job,” I muttered, keeping my eyes fixed on the tile.

“Ah, but that’s the thing about humans, isn’t it?” it said, its tone almost conversational. “You always reduce yourselves to your roles. Cleaner. Warden. Director. As if those labels are enough to hold your fragile minds together.”

I paused, my heart pounding in my chest. “I’m not supposed to talk to you.”

“And yet, here you are,” it said, a chuckle rumbling through the air. “Talking. Listening. *Lingering.* Tell me, Cleaner, do you enjoy this work? Scrubbing away filth, pretending not to see the stains that never truly leave?”

I hesitated, the mop trembling in my hands. “It’s just a job.”

“Is it?” it asked, its voice dropping to a whisper. “Or is it a distraction? A way to ignore the questions clawing at the edges of your mind? I can feel them, you know. The doubts. The little cracks in the veneer.”

I forced myself to keep scrubbing, but the words burrowed into me.

“They don’t tell you much, do they?” it continued. “They let you walk these halls, clean these cells, and expect you not to wonder. Not to question what’s locked behind these doors. What’s watching you from the dark.”

“I don’t need to know,” I said, though the words felt hollow.

Its laughter was low and mocking. “Humans are such poor liars. Your kind craves understanding, even when it destroys you. Especially when it destroys you.”

The shadows in the cell seemed to pulse, shifting and writhing like living things. Two faint pinpricks of light appeared in the darkness, golden and piercing. Eyes. They held me in place, drawing me closer without me realizing I’d taken a step forward.

“You want to know what I am,” it said, its tone soft and almost kind. “You want to know why they’re so afraid of me. Why they keep me hidden down here, in the dark.”

“I don’t,” I whispered, though my voice betrayed me.

“Oh, but you do,” it said. “And that’s the beautiful thing about your kind. Your curiosity is both your greatest strength and your undoing. It’s why you’ve conquered so much, why you’ve built empires. But it’s also why you destroy yourselves, over and over again. You can’t help it. You have to look. You have to know.”

The golden eyes seemed to grow brighter, and I felt an almost magnetic pull, like gravity itself was urging me closer to the cell. I tightened my grip on the mop handle, trying to ground myself.

“Tell me, Cleaner,” it said, its voice dropping to a whisper. “Do you ever wonder what lies behind the mask you wear? The role they’ve given you? Do you ever wonder who you *really* are?”

“I’m just a Cleaner,” I said, but the words sounded weak, even to me.

“Is that what they told you? That you’re just a cog in the machine, disposable and insignificant?” Its voice took on a sharper edge. “Or is that what you tell yourself, because it’s easier than asking the questions that matter?”

The air felt colder now, and I could see my breath in front of me. My heart was racing, and every instinct screamed at me to leave. But I couldn’t move.

“Come closer,” it said, its voice almost gentle now. “Ask the question you’re afraid to ask. Let me show you what they don’t want you to see.”

I shook my head, forcing my legs to move, backing away from the cell. “I’m not supposed to talk to you. I’m not supposed to—”

“Leave, then,” it said, cutting me off. “Run back to your small, safe world. But you’ll return. You always do. Humans are nothing if not predictable.”

I turned and stumbled down the hallway, my breath coming in short, ragged gasps. But as I walked away, its final words echoed in my mind:

“You can’t clean away the truth, Cleaner. Those stains always remain.”

For days, I couldn’t shake the aberration’s words. Its voice echoed in my mind like a song I couldn’t stop humming, and with each repetition, the meaning became heavier, darker. The thought of it festered, creeping into every part of my life. I started jumping at shadows, second-guessing the Wardens I’d once admired, even losing sleep as I turned its cryptic warnings over and over in my head.

I thought I could ignore it, that the feeling would pass. But it didn’t. It only grew worse, clawing at the edges of my sanity until I couldn’t take it anymore. I had to know the truth. Or at least, whatever version of the truth that thing was willing to give me.

Against every rule, every shred of common sense, I decided to visit Cell 113 one last time.

The hallway leading to the cell felt darker than usual, the fluorescent lights humming faintly overhead like a warning. My hand trembled as I swiped my keycard and stepped inside the observation chamber. The room was cold, unnaturally so, and the shadows in the cell seemed thicker than before, writhing like living things.

“You’ve come back,” the voice greeted me, smooth and amused. The golden pinpricks of light that I assumed were its eyes flared faintly in the dark. “I must admit, I didn’t expect you to last this long.”

I swallowed hard, trying to steady my nerves. “You’ve been in my head,” I said, my voice cracking slightly. “I need answers. I need to know why you’re here, why someone like you—something like you—is locked up.”

The aberration chuckled, the sound low and almost human, but not quite. “Locked up?” it repeated, savoring the words like a fine wine. “No, child. I am not contained. I am simply… waiting. Waiting, as I have for centuries.”

Its words sent a chill down my spine, but I forced myself to stay. “Waiting for what?” I asked, though I wasn’t sure I wanted to hear the answer.

“For your kind to understand what you truly are,” it said. “You humans are an amusing species. So quick to forget, so eager to believe you are the architects of your own fate. But your kind was never alone. When the dark pressed in and the beasts roamed free, you cried out—not to gods, but to things older and far hungrier. And we answered. We gave you what you needed to rise, to fight, to thrive.

But nothing is free. Your kind struck a bargain, one you cannot remember but are still bound to. The Guardians, the Wardens—they are not saviors. They are the remnants of a deal you no longer understand. And when the time comes, when your borrowed strength no longer satisfies the debt, those who gave it to you will return.”

I felt a lump rise in my throat. “What do you mean, return? Are you saying the Wardens can’t stop what’s coming?”

“The Wardens?” the aberration said with a low, guttural laugh, like the grinding of stone. “They are more than imperfect—they are fractured reflections of the pact your kind struck. There is an aberration in them, a monstrous side, clawing beneath their skin. That is why they need the Guardians. Without the bond, they would lose themselves to what they are, become the very things you fear. The pact binds them, keeps them tethered to what is left of their humanity. But even that is not enough, is it? Do you think they would protect you if they truly understood what they are? Or would they turn against you instead?”

Its words sank into me like hooks, dragging me down into a spiral of doubt and fear.I thought of the Wardens I’d worked with over the years—their quiet confidence, their unmatched strength. They always seemed so sure, so unwavering. But now, I couldn’t shake the images in my mind. The way their eyes gleamed too sharply in the heat of battle. The feral, almost predatory way they moved as they closed in on their prey. The Guardians, always so loyal, sometimes seemed to act with a purpose that didn’t belong to their Wardens at all. I started to wonder: were they truly protectors, or were they simply beasts held on a fraying leash? What if their strength wasn’t a gift, but a curse they barely kept in check?

I clenched my fists, my voice rising in frustration. “Why are you telling me this? What’s your angle? If you’re not locked up, if you’re just waiting, then why are you still here?”

The aberration’s eyes seemed to burn brighter, and I could feel its grin even though I couldn’t see its face. “Because I enjoy watching,” it said simply. “Watching your kind struggle to understand, to piece together the fragments of a truth that would shatter you if you ever grasped it. You’re like children playing with fire, so sure of your safety until the flames consume you.”

My heart was pounding, but I refused to back down. “Then who are you?” I asked, the question slipping out before I could stop myself. “What are you?”

For the first time, the aberration was silent. The golden lights of its eyes dimmed, and for a moment, I thought it wouldn’t answer. Then, it spoke, its voice quieter but somehow more menacing than before.

“I am what waits beyond the veil of your understanding, the crawling chaos that whispers in the void. Your kind once called us gods, but we are far older than your faiths, far older than your stars. You might call me a Great Old One, but even that name is a shadow of what I am. I am the hunger beneath your fragile reality, the storm that watches from the abyss. I am not your enemy, child. I am inevitability.”

I staggered back, the weight of its words pressing down on me like a physical force. My vision blurred, and the air felt too thin, too heavy. I didn’t know what to believe anymore, but one thing was certain: I couldn’t stay there any longer.

I turned and stumbled out of the observation chamber, my heart racing as I made my way back to the upper levels. The aberration’s laughter followed me, soft and mocking, like the echo of a nightmare I’d never fully wake from.

In the days that followed, its words burrowed deep into my mind, festering like an open wound. I couldn’t escape them, couldn’t stop replaying every cryptic sentence. I didn’t have access to the Association’s most sensitive records—Cleaners like me weren’t meant to question, only to follow orders. But even from the scraps I’d seen in passing, the whispers in the halls, and the fragmented stories shared by veterans, I started to piece together something horrifying—or rather, I started to notice what *wasn’t* there. There were no traces of rituals, no records of the Wardens’ origins, no mention of where their power came from. Just silence. As though it had all been scrubbed away, leaving only questions no one dared to ask. If what the entity in Cell 113 said was true, then humanity isn't fighting to win. We were just stalling. Holding back an inevitable tide that had been promised long before any of us were born.
