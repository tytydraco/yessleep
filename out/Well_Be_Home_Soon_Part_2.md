I don’t know how I managed to fall asleep with all of the noise but I did. It was only briefly, though, and still daylight when something crashed through the bedroom window. I screamed. Jodi put himself between me and the window. There was a rock on the floor surrounded by shards of glass. Another, smaller object thudded through the hole in the window. Jodi bent down to look at it and then jumped back.

“What is it?” I asked, leaning over.

“Don’t look,” he shouted. 

I’d never heard him raise his voice like that before or sound so freaked out. He kicked the thing away then threw an old t-shirt over it but I still caught a glimpse. I told myself I was seeing things but it looked like a finger with a cracked, gnawed nail. 

My fears were confirmed when a hand shot through the broken window, the arm slicing itself deeply against the shattered glass. The hand had four fingers and one fresh, red stump. 

“Open the door, Jodi,” came a singsong voice from the hallway that almost sounded like mom. “Be a good little boy and open the door.” 

The last three words came in a growl that didn’t sound anything like our mom. 

I screamed when more glass fell from the window. A second arm was reaching inside. A third arm appeared, and then a fourth, and then the window was full of arms. They squirmed like worms in a jar, pushing against each other and cutting themselves to the bone on broken glass. Thin rivers of red blood and black liquid dripped and puddled on the floor. Jodi sprang to the window, turning over the nightstand and using it to press back the arms. 

“Open the door,” said a deep voice from the hall. 

“Open it, open it, open it,” demanded another voice, this one high-pitched, almost hysterical. 

More voices joined in from both the doorway and outside of the window. Hands grabbed at Jodi, tearing his shirt and scratching his face. I was crying and shaking, huddled into a ball with my knees in my chest. Not knowing what else to do, I started to pray, a nonsense prayer that was half-nursery rhyme, half-whatever I could remember from the last time we went to church the past Christmas. 

Something laughed in the hallway but the hands pulled back and the knocking stopped. Jodi wedged the nightstand into the broken window, blocking off as much as possible. Then he began clogging it with dirty laundry, strips of torn curtains, and anything else he could find in the room. 

When he was finished and the window was as secure as he could make it, Jodi sat on the bed and sobbed. It was the first time I could ever remember hearing my brother cry. It was so shocking that I stopped crying and sat next to him, squeezing him in the tightest hug I could manage. 

“We’ll be home soon,” I said. “We’ll be home soon. Home. Home. Home.”

Jodi stopped crying almost immediately but didn’t move other than to return the hug. We sat there together for a long time watching the cracks of light that slipped through the window barrier darken and shrivel as the day crept from afternoon into dusk.

It sounded like the end of the world on the other side of the door. Mom and day continued their party after we barricaded ourselves in the bedroom. I heard them singing and stomping all over the cabin. Dad began alternating between laughing like a madman and howling. Mom would just sing over him, violently off-key. There was one moment when I heard one of them scream, I couldn’t tell which. The scream was loud enough to hurt my ears and sounded so full of pain and terror that I started sobbing into Jodi’s shoulder. Thankfully, the shrieking didn’t last long before the singing began again. 

Things got worse as the night went on. The noises coming from the rest of the cabin grew louder and spread out until mom and dad sounded like an entire crowd having a party. Music started playing; at first, I thought dad had charged the speaker but this music was too close, too blaring, and too big to be coming from a little device. If it wasn’t impossible, I would have thought there was a band playing. I heard flutes or pipes, violins and horns, and so, so many drums. Jodi and I had to plug our ears when the music and the party sounds got louder and louder. 

The drumming was so noisy it took me a long time to notice that someone was banging on our door. Banging and banging and banging hard enough to make the bed that was pushed against the door shake. 

Jodi held me while I cried. I cried for a long time, maybe hours. I cried for mom and dad and begged them to stop and sobbed until my throat was sore and my voice was gone. Then I cried just a little more. At some point, I might have fallen asleep for a few minutes but a new sound woke me up. Or, a lack of sound. 

The cabin had fallen silent. 

I looked at Jodi. He was staring at the door. 

“What’s going on?” I whispered. 

Jodi just shook his head. 

There was something heavy about the silence. I joined Jodi in watching the door and began to get the impression that someone was on the other side. Maybe a lot of someones. The image of a cabin full of people, absolutely stuffed wall-to-wall and floor-to-ceiling, came suddenly into my mind. I pictured them all smiling the same mad smile as the bronze bust, all staring at the bedroom, with mom and dad both pressed against the door by the flood of people-things. In my mind, my parents were smiling the widest of all.   

I would have screamed if my throat wasn’t too raw to let it out. Jodi held onto me until I stopped shaking. The silence dragged along like a body being pulled into a ditch. 

“Mommy,” I sobbed into Jodi’s chest, my voice a faint croak. “Daddy.”

“It’s okay,” Jodi promised, rubbing my back gently. “We’ll be home soon. It’s okay.”

I shuddered. “Mommy. Daddy. Mommy. Daddy. Mommydaddymommy.” 

“Hey, Cara-bear. Hey, you have to breathe, okay? Cara? Cara…first question: are you a person, a place, or a thing?” 

Jodi repeated the question until it finally broke through my sobbing. 

“I’m a place,” I rasped. “I’m anywhere but here.”

“Cara…you have to stop giving me answers before I ask. You’re terrible at this game.”

“You’re terrible,” I said, not quite smiling but nearly. 

We played twenty questions back-and-forth until the first gray light of sunrise came through the curtains. It stayed silent in the cabin the entire time. After I’d calmed down and was on the edge of sleep again, I finally released my grip on Jodi. 

“Cara, I’m going to open the door to-”

“No!”

He put a finger to his lips. I didn’t realize that I had shouted.

“I’m going to open the door, just a crack, to see what’s going on,” he said. “Help me slide the bed back but be ready to shove it back if I say so, okay?”

My hands were shaking when we moved the bed. Jodi took a deep breath, unlocked the door, and then opened it gently, silently. After a moment with no sounds from the other side, he pressed his eye to the opening. 

For the first time in my life, I heard my brother scream. Jodi jerked his head back, kicking the door closed. He shouldered the bed back into place on his own, then pawed for the door’s lock, fumbling several times before finally getting it to click. 

“Jodi?”

He sat with his back against the barricade, trembling. 

“Jodi, what is it? What did you see?”

My brother shook his head and didn’t answer. He was crying. I sat next to him and hugged him. Jodi hugged me back. It took almost ten minutes for him to stop shaking but when he did, his eyes were clear and he looked steady. 

“We have to leave,” he told me.

“But mom and dad-”

“Cara, we have to get out of the cabin. We will wait in the woods for Uncle Roy to get back. He should be here today, I’m guessing this morning since he’s an early riser when he’s fishing.”

“Can’t we just stay here and wait for him, then?”

“No. Because he might not be back until this afternoon. Or even tomorrow if the fishing is good. And we don’t want to be in this cabin another night. I can’t be in this place another night. Even with us locked in here, I’m sure it’s safer outside. Maybe we can grab the keys on the way out and hide in the car or, heck, I can even drive us away if it comes to that. We just have to leave. Do you trust me?”

“Always,” I said, immediately. 

Jodi smiled. “Okay. Here’s what we are going to do: you remember Blind Man’s Bluff, right?” I nodded. “Good. Before I open the door, you are going to close your eyes shut and keep them closed until I say you can open them.”

“I’ll trip.”

“No, I won’t let you fall. I’ll be right with you, holding your hand. Just follow me but, whatever you do, do not open your eyes until I say so, alright?” 

I tried to keep the tremor out of my voice and mostly succeeded. “Okay.” 

Jodi smiled and kissed the top of my head, then slowly began sliding the bed away from the door. 

“Cara, one more thing: if I say, ‘hide,’ you open your eyes and you run for the forest and you find the best hiding place you can, okay? And don’t come out for anyone but me or Uncle Roy.”

“How will you find me?” 

“Cara, did you forget? I’m the undefeated hide and seek champion. I’ll find you. I promise. But unless I tell you to hide, you need to-”

“Keep my eyes jammed shut,” I finished for him. 

“That’s right. Get ready.” 

I took a shaky breath and closed my eyes. Jodi slipped his hand into mine and gave me a comforting squeeze. 

“Steady,” he said.

I heard the scrape of the bed moving the rest of the distance out of our way, then the click of the lock opening. 

“Go,” Jodi whispered.

I followed his lead, holding his hand with a white-knuckle grip. We were barely three steps into the hallway when I heard dad. He sounded sick.

“Jodi. Cara.” 

Dad’s voice was breathless and gurgled slightly.

“Don’t. Look,” Jodi repeated, pulling me away.

“But dad-”

“We can’t help him. Just keep moving.”

“Jodi? Cara? Rachel?” Dad continued. “Where are you? I can’t…I can’t see. Where am I? Where? Where? Where?”

His voice made my stomach cramp. It was a mix of confused and sleepy. He sounded close, like he was in the hall with us. I stumbled over something on the hallway floor and put a hand to the wall to steady myself. My palm came back sticky and wet. I yelped but Jodi kept us moving, dragging me forward. 

“Don’t look,” he chanted. “Don’t look.” 

I wiped my hand on my shirt and tried not to picture what I might have touched. My first thought was of the black stains that we’d found all over the cabin, only much, much fresher. But there was something even stranger about the wall where I’d made contact. For a moment, it felt like my fingers had brushed against skin, cold and soggy, but unmistakably, skin. There were bumps and indents in whatever I touched. 

“Where? Where? Where is everyone?” Dad’s voice asked again. 

The sound of it was so close and clearly on my left, coming from about where I put my hand against the wall. 

“Daddy?” I asked, turning around and opening my eyes. 

I thought he might be hurt. That he might need us. Despite Jodi’s warning, I just couldn’t stop myself. I wish now, every day, that I had listened to my brother. 

Dad was almost gone. A few pieces of him–half of his face, an arm, a leg from the knee down–were still visible but most of his body had disappeared inside a giant, black stain on the hallway wall. What was left of him seemed to be dissolving, soaking into the logs in a greasy smear. His one remaining eye stared at me. 

“Where?” he asked again. “Where am I? Where’s my family? Where?”

Dad’s voice still sounded sleepy but I could see the perfect terror in his last blue eye. 

I screamed. And screamed. Something vast and gray squeezed my mind. I think, looking back, it was probably insanity looming over me like a wave. I would have let it crash down, too, if Jodi hadn’t been there to pick me up and turn me away from what used to be our dad. 

“It’s okay, I promise it’s okay,” he said, carrying me out of the hall. “Just close your eyes again. We’ll be home soon.” 

But I couldn’t close my eyes, could barely control my body at all. My mouth had gone sour and dry and the only reason I stopped screaming was because it was difficult to draw enough air. 

“Who’s there?” 

Mom’s voice coming from the living room. 

“Eyes closed,” Jodi said but my eyelids wouldn’t obey so I saw everything when he stepped out of the hallway still carrying me. 

Mom was sitting near the fireplace, the bronze bust with its head open was next to her. The statue’s face had changed again and now its smile was manic, a pointed tongue peeking through sharp metal teeth, and its eyes were tracking Jodi and I as we moved. Like dad, mom was falling apart, liquifying but still mostly solid. Her arms and legs and neck drooped; the joints were loose and dripping tar, straining with the weight of flesh still on her body. Dark stains covered her skin and everything about her seemed ready to melt like a forgotten candle left burning too long. 

While we watched, mom tried to lift up the bust to take another drink of the foul wine but it was too heavy. One of her arms burst and spilled black fluid across the floor. Mom just leaned down so she could drink directly from the open top of the container, lapping at it with a black tongue. She turned her head so she could watch us while she drank.

“Cara? Jodi? Are you you?” she croaked in a sleepy voice. “Where are we? Where am I? Are you you?”

Jodi slowly circled away from mom.

“Don’t leave!” she hissed, trying to stand up. “Dance with me! Both of you dance with me. Where’s your father? Dance. Dance, dance, dancedancedancedance.” 

The first step mom took toward us collapsed her leg and the fall ruptured most of the rest of her. Only her torso, minus one arm, stayed flesh. Everything else became another wet, black stain on the cabin floor.

“Mommy,” I moaned.

“Don’t look,” Jodi said again but with no energy behind it. Shock was settling in. 

Mom tried to drag herself across the floor but every inch caused more of her to dissolve. She stopped and lay face-up next to the couch. 

“Cara?” she asked. Her voice sounded like her again. “Jodi. Oh, Jodi. You have to take your sister. Take care of…take care of your sister. Take care of…I’m sorry. I don’t understand.” She flopped her head over to look at us. “Promise. Jodi. Promise. Safe. Jodi. Jodi?”

Tears were rolling down his cheeks but his voice was kind and steady. “Yes, mom?”

“Kill…kill me…please. Kill me. Please. Kill me. Please. Please. Please kill me.”

Jodi’s mouth was moving but no words were coming out. After a moment, he turned and carried me out of the cabin. He found a stump near the tree line and helped me sit down. 

“Stay right here and catch your breath,” he told me. “I’ll be right-”

“No! Don’t leave me.”

He put his forehead against mine. “I have to go back. Just for a second. Just to do something. And I need you to stay here, okay? I promise I will be right back, Cara-bear. I love you.” Jodi’s eyes were full of tears but his face was determined. “If I’m not back in ten minutes, I want you to hide in the woods. Hide, and don’t come out unless you see me, or Uncle Roy, or police. Do not come out if it’s mom or dad calling for you. Promise me.”

I did. Jodi ruffled my hair and took a deep, deep breath. He walked into the cabin. I’ve never asked him what he did or what else he saw that day. I sat on the stump and watched the open front door and I counted. After seven minutes and nine seconds, smoke began leaking out of the windows. At eight minutes and twenty seconds, Jodi came outside looking so pale I thought he might be sick. 

He came and sat next to me on the stump. It didn’t take long for the cabin to burn. Flames ate at the wood and danced across the roof. A pillar of black smoke taller than the highest tree in the forest rose into the sky. We didn’t speak for several minutes, we just watched the fire, holding each other. The cabin was smoldering ash in less than an hour. Whatever the stains were that soaked the walls and floors and ceilings, they must have been terribly flammable.

Jodi untangled himself long enough to approach the destruction, avoiding a few lingering flames. He wiped soot all over his clothes, arms, and face, then brought back a pile and did the same for me.

“Why?” I asked. 

Jodi squeezed my hand. “When Uncle Roy gets here, and the police and the firefighters, they’re going to have questions for us. A lot more than twenty questions. But just like twenty questions, we can’t tell them more than what they need to know, okay?”

“You mean lie?” I asked.

“Only as much as we need to. No one would believe what happened to mom and dad. They’d think we were crazy. They might try to take us away, to split us up.”

“No!”

"It’s okay, Cara, I would never let that happen. Never. But the best thing we can do is make them all understand that something terrible happened here, even if the details need to be…well, even if we have to fudge some of the details. Our stories have to be the same and we need to answer questions the same, alright? People will have seen the smoke. We should practice before anyone gets here.”

This is the story that we told our Uncle Roy when he drove in an hour later, jon boat bumping on its trailer because he was speeding down the dirt road when he saw the smoke:

The last two days were normal, we told him. We hiked. We explored the forest. We played cards at night by the fireplace. Everything was good. 

Then we woke up early on the third day to find the cabin on fire. We didn’t know how it started. Jodi and I ran out, barely able to see or breathe in all of the smoke. We thought mom and dad would be outside or right behind us. When they didn’t come out immediately, we tried to go back in but couldn’t. The flames were too high. The smoke was too thick. The door collapsed while we were on the porch and we had to back away. 

I added one detail that Jodi and I hadn’t rehearsed: I told Uncle Roy how Jodi had carried me out, how I wouldn’t have been able to keep going if he hadn’t been there, how he saved my life. Jodi gave me a look when I added that to the story. I knew he didn’t want credit for anything, that he didn’t feel like a hero, but my big brother did save me and, for all of the lies that we told that morning, I was determined to make sure that piece of truth slipped in. 

Uncle Roy believed us. He saw the state of our clothes, he heard the devastation in our voices. Our uncle held us both close and hugged me for a very long time. He hugged Jodi, too, and when he stepped away, he put a hand on my brother’s shoulder, and looked him in the eye, and said he’d never been more proud of Jodi, or of anyone, in his whole life. 

“Your parents would be so proud of you, too,” Uncle Roy said. 

Jodi cried then, hard sobs that shook his whole body. He calmed down when first park rangers, then fire fighters, and then, finally, police showed up. We repeated the story and answered questions, all ones Jodi expected. As far as anyone knew, it was a terrible but completely normal tragedy with only two small mysteries that never got solved.

The source of the fire was never confirmed. No one ever suggested arson. I asked Jodi about that, how no one was able to tell that a person started the fire. 

“I don’t know, Cara,” he admitted. “I always worried they’d catch that and start asking different questions but it had to be done. Maybe…maybe that was the one piece of luck that we got in the whole mess. The way the cabin went up, how fast and hot it burned, I guess it’s possible there wasn’t enough left to figure out it was intentional.” 

The second mystery involved our parents’ remains. There were remains, even a bone or two, but not much. Not enough to fill a shoebox, much less a coffin. Uncle Roy told us that the authorities believed the fire got hot enough somehow to burn almost everything to ash, including mom and dad. And I suppose it did, thanks to those flammable stains, but even if it had been a normal fire, I doubt we would have recovered much for the cemetery. At least we were able to get them nice headstones. I visit them nearly every weekend. 

Uncle Roy adopted us after the fire. He was kind, and patient, and always there when the nightmares ripped me out of sleep every night for the first six months. Jodi was there for me, too, and I tried to be there for him, but he changed after everything at the cabin. He stopped smiling, laughing, and he didn’t want to play games anymore. 

My brother was never short with me but he did radiate this new, cold anger all of the time. Jodi withdrew into himself, into his room, and into his research. His shelves became filled with books on ancient Greek and Roman mythology, legends, and folktales. Over the last three years, I’ve watched Jodi shrink and sharpen. He didn’t have time for school or friends or any normal teenage things. His focus was entirely on…well, I wasn’t sure exactly what the target of his new intensity was, not until last week. 

That’s when I woke up to find Jodi gone with a short note left for me on his desk. 

Cara,

I’ve found them, the ones responsible for mom and dad. It’s taken me a long time but I’m sure of it. We were all the victims of something old and terrible. I won’t let that be the end of it. I won’t let them get away with it. 

If you don’t hear from me again, know that I love you little sis, have always loved you, and will always love you. I’m sorry for how cold I’ve been the last few years, sorry that part of me never came back from the cabin. But my coldness was never because of you. All of the warmth in me just went out with the fire. Still…I am the undefeated hide and seek champion.

Remember me as that brother, not what’s left.

\-Jodi

I told Uncle Roy about Jodi running away but didn’t show him the note. That was only for me. 

Oh, Jodi. Jodi. Where did you go? Whatever revenge you want, whatever anger you are feeding, I know it’s because you feel guilty that you couldn’t help mom and dad. But you did everything you could, more than anyone could have asked for or expected, and you saved us both. 

Please come back to me in one piece. Come back like you used to be, alive and whole. If you can come back as that Jodi, we’ll finally, after everything, truly be home.
