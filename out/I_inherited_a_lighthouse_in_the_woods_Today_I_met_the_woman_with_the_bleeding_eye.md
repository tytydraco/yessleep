It's been awhile. I know.

I've been sending letters to an outside contact. A friend, or something close to it. Recently, they've made it clear that my ravens haven't been reaching them, that they've been getting intercepted by something, or someone. The Decrepit One, maybe. Or Wesley, my estranged, murderous brother. 

I don't know. 

I don't know who's trying to stop me from getting my story out, but I do know one thing: a lot's happened since I've gone quiet. More than I can say in a single post, so expect more frequent updates. Things aren't right in Gloomfall. They’re worse than I realized. 

Last we spoke, I told you about my encounter with the Stickman. My reunion with my sister. I told you about the storm that ravishes the Phantom Wood every night, and the beast that my mother’s apparently become. But there’s more to this story– much more. 

So let’s begin. 

____________________

I folded my arms, watching the Stickman vanish into the forest. “I don’t trust him.”

Harriet shifted at my side, uncomfortable. “That makes two of us. Still, we’re not exactly in a position to turn down help right now– creepy monsters or otherwise.” She paused. Bit her lip. “Besides, Jasper. I think he knows things, more than he’s said tonight.”

“What sort of things?”

Harriet leaned forward, she planted her elbows on the window sill and gazed toward the stabbing lightning above the Phantom Wood. “He helped me repair the lighthouse. After dad died… the light started to dim, and I was working around the clock trying to figure out how to get it burning bright again but…” Another pause. Another hesitant, shame-ridden sigh. “I couldn’t figure it out. He understood the mechanism though, the weird, ancient magic that powers it.”

I let her words digest in my mind. So the Stickman had helped Harriet repair the lighthouse. “That doesn’t make any sense,” I said at length. “Our family built this lighthouse generations ago. There’s never been anybody but us who’s worked on it. Even dad didn’t know much about that thing– that’s why he had us jot down that giant operating manual, remember? He was worried more knowledge would be lost.”

“Yeah, I remember,” Harriet said. “Look, I know it doesn’t make any sense, but neither does the rest of it, does it? Wesley coming back. Our mother being… being whatever the hell is making those storms. Nothing makes any sense, Jasper, so I think we’ve got to work with what we’ve got and sort out the details later.”

The way Harriet spoke told me she was done with the conversation. The lines on her face, the bags beneath her eyes told me she was done with the day– she looked exhausted. “Let’s just get some sleep,” she said with a shake of her head. She pulled the shutters closed to the storm. “We can talk about things tomorrow.”

“Is it safe? Shouldn’t one of us stand watch?”

Harriet stalked across my old bedroom, stopping by the door where her fingers drummed along the frame. ““The Stickman’s standing watch. He’ll let us know if the storm worsens, or the light dims, or…” Her words trailed off, her face paling, lips trembling with unspoken words. “Look, the point is– we’re safe. Now get some sleep because we’ve got work to do tomorrow.”

I opened my mouth to reply, to press her on what she meant to say– what she wasn’t telling me, but before I could get a word out the door was already groaning closed. Harriet had gone. Sighing, I stumbled onto my bed, laying back and trying to make heads or tails of what was going on here. 

One thing was certain: this wasn’t the Gloomfall I remembered. The place I abandoned had rules. Laws. This place? This place was coming undone, unraveling in all the most terrifying ways I could imagine. 

And some, much worse than that.

“Rise and shine.”

I blinked, blinded by daylight as Harriet thrust open my bedroom’s shutters. My head pounded. My limbs, battered and bruised from the night before, felt like lead weights dipped in acid. Every hurt. Everything felt weak. 

“Give me another hour,” I said. 

“No chance,” she told me flatly. “We’ve got work to do– and somebody to meet.”

“Who?”

She tossed me one of dad’s old shirts, a plaid button-down. Next came a pair of jeans. “Throw these on. Your clothes are soaked in blood and I’m pretty sure you pissed yourself running around last night.”

“Feel free to fuck off.”

“Feel free to hurry up. I’m not kidding. This isn’t the sort of visitor you want to leave waiting.” She stalked to the door, then stopped and looked back at me over her shoulder. “And Jasper?”

I grunted. 

“It’s good to see you again.”

After I finished getting dressed I stepped outside to find Harriet sitting on the grass outside the cabin. She was staring up at the lighthouse, its red brickwork gleaming in the autumn sun. In her hands was a knife and a sharpening stone. 

“Morning,” I grumbled.

She glanced back at me, hastily stuffing the knife into her denim jacket. “Hasn’t been morning for a couple hours now. How do you feel?”

“Like shit.”

“Join the club. Ready for a bit of socializing?”

I narrowed my eyes. Gloomfall didn’t have much of a population. Outside of our family– the Lichts, there were only four others scattered around the area. We tended to the lighthouse. The others acted as stewards to different structures on the land. None of the families were overly large, and none of them cared much for socializing. 

“Who are we meeting?” I asked.

Harriet nodded toward the creek. “See for yourself.”

I followed her across the yellowed grass, stalking toward the slow-rippling water that would soon become a rushing river come winter. I wondered if she’d managed to gather the families. It was such a colossal task that I’d only ever seen it done once in all my life– during our mother’s funeral. But maybe Harriet had convinced them of the Storm’s significance. 

I’d trust them over the Stickman, at any rate. 

“Go on,” Harriet said, stopping suddenly. “I’ll wait for you here.”

I’d been so lost in my thoughts that I nearly walked into her. I looked up, lamely looking across the creek toward the creeping branches of the Phantom Wood. There. Just at the edge of the property, sitting safely outside the Lighthouse’s glare was a hunch-backed woman drowning in robes. 

My heart pounded. Even from here, a dozen meters away I could feel her. Like an illness. Or a disease. The woman looked at me, face hidden beneath a hood, one over-large eye trickling blood down a wrinkled cheek. 

I turned to Harriet. “What is this?” I asked, voice shaking. 

“A contingency,” Harriet replied. “Against Wesely. And the Stickman. You didn’t think I’d trust them without a back-up plan, did you?” 

I shook my head, mouth moving wordlessly in disbelief. I wanted to tell her that no, this wasn’t a contingency– this was a deal with the devil. The Decrepit One wasn’t just another Haunt, it was the Haunt. The most vile creature to stalk the Phantom Wood. The most ancient. 

This was the monster our father had been speaking with before he died. 

And now, it wanted to talk to [me.](https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCryptid/comments/svvw3l/crooked_antlers_is_now_available_in_digital_and/)
