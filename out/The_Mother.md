To say that the Holloway family was plagued by misfortune would be a gross understatement. The Holloways, a beautiful and happy young couple, Genevieve and Victor, dated in secret due to their families vehemently disapproving of their relationship. With each hurdle they faced, their bond grew stronger, as if the odds against them fueled their romance. Perhaps they were right; it would explain Victor’s unwavering determination to remain by Genevieve’s side during their darkest moments.

On the night of their fifth year of dating, Victor knelt before Genevieve, and in a swirl of emotions, proposed to Genevieve. Her eyes sparkled with joy as she gladly accepted, sealing their love with an unbreakable bond. They chose to hold their wedding on the rugged coastline of Tarleg, overlooking the stormy gray sea that gave way to an even stormier sky. Rain poured down, a beautiful sign of luck for those who believe in such things as fate. Yet, the old gods don’t care for such superstition.

Following their blissful honeymoon, the couple settled in Orth, a small town nestled at the heart of Tarleg. Their new residence, nearly a mansion, whispered the promise of a tranquil life. The week after moving in, laughter filled the halls, evening dances warmed their souls, and the love making was tender and passionate. In those seven fleeting days, they experienced the height of peace that would elude them for the rest of their tragically short lives.

One afternoon, Victor decided to surprise his wife with lunch and departed from work early. As he excitedly entered the home, he immediately was met with the putrid stench of death and decay. He rushed through the house, panic rising in him. And there in the kitchen, he found Genevieve, her head slumped in her hands. Fear gripped his heart, but relief washed over him as he realized she was still breathing, though her tears flowed unceasingly.

“My beloved, why are you crying?” he asked with concern in his voice. His eyes searched her tear-stained face for answers. Genevieve gulped and wiped her swollen eyes, forcing a smile onto trembling lips.

 “Oh, it’s nothing, really,” she began and let out a dry chuckle. “It’s just these damned plants we keep buying. They wither and die almost as soon as we plant them. It’s just pushed me over the edge today, I’m afraid.” 

Victor wrapped his arms around Genevieve as she continued her ragged breaths, still trying to compose herself. As Victor lifted his eyes to meet hers, he caught sight of the lifeless plants. His brows furrowed in confusion, and he pushed himself up and away from his wife. Slowly, he walked nearer to the planters. The once vibrant greens were now a deep, ominous black, as if painted. The putrid odor emanating from the soil resembled the stench of a decaying corpse. When he turned his gaze, the crumpled leaves reflected the sunlight, casting ethereal shadows of light blue veins across their withered surface.

“Perhaps the soil has been tainted,” Victor suggested, his eyes still inspecting the vegetation. He leaned in closer and ran a hand along the cracked surface of the wilting leaves. “I can make a stop at the store after work today and bring back some replacements.”

 Genevieve’s expression faded into one of relief and gratitude as she smiled at her husband, her gaze lingering on the fading plants. The couple enjoyed their meal and spoke no more of the plants during their lunch. In fact, the thought of the plants wouldn’t even cross their mind until two weeks later.

That fateful night, as Victor drove along the cobbled streets of his neighborhood, he returned home to find the ominous presence of authorities awaiting his arrival. His hands trembled as he stepped out of the car, a knot of unease coiling in his stomach. “Good evening, officers. What seems to be the problem?”

Two imposing figures, tall yet slender, turned their attention to him. Genevieve stood behind them, tears streaking her face. The taller officer stepped forward and, with a serious expression, pointed to a spot on the ground in the front yard.

Victor followed the officer’s gesture, his eyes tracing the outline on the ground. Suddenly, the realization dawned upon him, and his stomach churned with horror. He nearly vomited at the sight. His blood ran cold, and pulse hastened. A mere yard away lay the lifeless body of a young boy with bright blue veins who was contorted and broken, as if twisted by the metal hands of a god. The reasoning became painfully apparent - dark black vines coiling around the child’s lifeless form.

After hours of intense interrogation, the bewildered couple was released to return home. In a state of pure shock, they drove home in silence and spoke no words the rest of the night. They changed mechanically, slipped under the covers, and fell into an uneasy sleep. When morning came, the corpse had vanished, much like their fragmented memory of the event.

Weeks passed, marked by sporadic incidents that would slip from their memory moments later. Genevieve grew increasingly cold and agitated but had no explanation for her actions. As the couple settled into their house, they attempted to bridge the divide between their families, extending an invitation to both sets of parents for a housewarming dinner. A light rain set the tone for the evening as both families arrived at the door to the Holloway house. Gwendolyn and Nathaniel, Genevieve’s parents, immediately started to bicker with Percival and Arabella, Victor’s parents. However, as soon as the door had been opened by their children, the nonsensical fighting ceased.

As the evening progressed, the families were civil but made no effort to connect. For Genevieve and Victor, this was a good start and a small win. When dinnertime approached, the six members all sat around the table, and ate in near silence. The food was delicious, and the couple felt happy.

Suddenly, a horrible guttural sound emitted from Arabella as she began to choke. Her rash-stricken hands grasped around her throat as she tried to gasp for air. Victor, Percival, and Genevieve all rushed to her side, attempting to help. The sound of her desperate gasps filled the room, mixing with the clattering of cutlery, and the faint ticking of the grandfather clock in the corner. Genevieve’s parents, unmoved, watched the unfolding chaos with unblinking eyes.

Victor’s mother collapsed face down onto the table before grabbing her knife and stabbing into her throat, causing a horrible gurgling sound to fill the air. The smooth metal pierced through flesh and sinew, releasing a sickening wet sound that reverberated through the room. The sharp tang of iron filled the air as blood spurted from the wound, staining the pristinely white tablecloth. The metallic scent mingled with the half-eaten food, creating a disturbing juxtaposition of smells. 

A floorboard quietly creaked as the three stood over her body in shock, their breaths shallow, as blood continued to pour out and pool onto the ground. Her lifeless eyes, wide and glassy, never broke contact with Genevieve’s parents as they watched on with unchanged expressions. Arabella expelled one last bubbling breath, before a haunting silence filled the room.

In the weeks that followed, a procession of officers made their way to the Holloway’s residence, seeking answers in the wake of Victor’s mother’s death. An examiner meticulously examined the body, their analysis concluding that no foul play was involved. With a heavy heart, the cause of death was declared as suicide. The verdict infuriated Victor, fueling his fury and directing his blame towards Genevieve’s parents.

As time passed, the memory of his mother’s death began to fade from the forefront of Victor’s mind. Yet, an elusive sensation gnawed at the edges of his mind, giving him the feeling  that he had forgotten something, but for the life of him he couldn’t remember. It drove him nearly to madness, and he had become a shell of her former self, spending his days sulking about.

In the aftermath of previous events his business faltered,  friends turned their backs on him, and then, in a cruel twist of fate, his father died. Just when despair threatened to consume him entirely, a glimmer of hope arose - a suggestion from Genevieve to start a family. To start anew. 

The prospect of a fresh chapter in life infused Victor with a newfound sense of purpose and life. He threw himself into the task of resurrecting his shattered existence. No longer would he spend his days in a pit of despair and melancholy; instead, they were filled with the relentless effort to resurrect his broken business and friendships. 

With the arrival of each evening, Victor would return home with anticipation. Their joy knew no bounds when Genevieve’s pregnancy was confirmed, and the two celebrated with elation the moment they discovered that they would soon be parents. 

However, fate was so unkind to the Holloways. Four months later, Victor came home to find a familiar sight. Genevieve sat in the kitchen with her head buried in her hands, her sobs quietly echoing in the room. Rushing to her side, Victor desperately wanted to comfort her, but she pushed him aside and ran upstairs to the bedroom. The resounding slam of the door shook the whole house and Victor stood motionless, and confused, in the kitchen.

That same evening, in a moment of heart-wrenching revelation, Victor discovered the source of his wife’s distress. In the toilet, he found the remains of the tiny, fragile fetus of the child that would’ve been his son. Overwhelmed with grief, he fell to his knees, tears streaming down his face. His anguished cries and curses filled the small bathroom. He felt like a spectator, watching his own life falling apart as he stood helpless, powerless.

I wish I could say that this was the last time the family would experience such a tragic loss, but that would be untruthful. In total, Genevieve experienced four more miscarriages, each one caused Genevieve to spiral more and more into an agitated and hateful state, oftentimes abusing substances to dull the pain until she would become paranoid and begin seeing visions of her dead children.

Through the pain and suffering, the couple still tried for a child, and finally the couple eventually had a successful birth. Happiness filled the couple the first moment they laid eyes on their newborn son, Silas. They poured their souls into nurturing Silas, savoring a brief pause from the trials that had plagued them. It was during this fleeting moment that the notion of another child took hold - an embodiment of their love and a lifelong companion for Silas. 

Experiencing much less difficulties this time, Genevieve became pregnant, and, within nine months, Silas did indeed have a lifelong friend: his little sister Evangeline. Unfortunately, not even two weeks after giving birth, Evangeline’s mother became uncharacteristically fearful of Evangeline and Silas.

A short time after that, she became engulfed in delusions and claimed to be seeing strange, ghastly figures floating above the children like ethereal sectors. Visions of her dead children, their skin always a milky white with bright blue veins snaking across their body, taunting her. Their disembodied voices telling her that *she* was the cause of their deaths. The terrors grew more frequent, and it didn’t take too long for her to begin resenting Silas and Evangeline. The tendrils of madness gripped her rightly, compelling her to attempt to harm her own children. 

One evening at dinner, Victor gathered his courage to speak on the matter, but his small thread of hope snapped. His words were met with a storm of violence as she lashed out, and in frenzy, she severed his left thumb. Stunned at her own actions, Genevieve froze in place, nearly comatose, as Victor’s thumb bled out and stained the wooden floor.

With haste, Victor received medical attention that same evening from a neighbor, a doctor who skillfully stitched his thumb shut. Returning home, dread engulfed him as he discovered Genevieve attempting to drown Evangeline in the bath, her tiny body thrashing against the relentless grasp of her mother. Powered by adrenaline and fear, Victor threw his wife to the ground and pulled Evangeline from the water. The child began to cry as if she knew that she was moments from her life being cut short.

Following the incident, Victor made a heart-wrenching decision. He locked his wife within the confines of their bedroom, and made it explicitly clear to his children that the door would only be opened when he took Genevieve meals, or when doctors came to check on her. And there were many, many doctors that came for the next two years who tried to cure the delusional mother with various “cures.” Though Victor was determined to see his wife healed and stay with her through the times of darkness, his hope began to fade as each doctor came to the same conclusion: there was no remedy.

Time wore on and, two years later, Genevieve was still imprisoned in the bedroom. Evangeline and Silas became more distant from their mother as every day passed. When the doctors told Victor that there was truly nothing more they could do to help his wife, he fell into a horrible and deep depression, leaving his two children to fend for themselves. Though it seemed that Victor would perpetually be in this state, fate had other ideas.

 One night, just as Evangeline and Silas were getting into bed, a pained wailing of torment came from within Genevieve’s locked bedroom. She screamed and hollered while pounding her fists onto the door. “She’s going to kill me too!” she screamed. “Help, please, somebody help!” she continued to cry.

The cacophony filled the entire house, and Silas rushed to cover his little sister’s ears. The horrifying, violent screams and pounding continued all through the night, as if an animal was being tortured. After seemingly endless hours of being a victim of the noise, it ceased. The moment the sun rose, the noises stopped, as if Genevieve ceased to exist.   

Evangeline and Silas, after a night of nearly no sleep, hid under their blankets as Victor went to check his wife’s status. As he slowly approached the lock door, he felt his heart pounding out of his chest. The closer he got to the locked bedroom, the more he fought back tears and horror. With a shaking hand, Victor pulled out the bedroom key and slowly turned the lock. A slight *click* emitted, and, with ragged breath, he opened the door.

The moment the door opened, he was hit with the stench of excrement, bile, and coppery blood. Though his nose had prepared him for what was in the room, he was still rocked to his core by what he saw. Genevieve, his once young and beautiful wife, sat kneeling in a mushy pile of feces, vomit, and blood. Her face was streaked with jagged cuts, and small beads of crimson blood dotted her face. Her breath was shallow and shaky. She was still alive. On the floor, written in blood, was a strange word - *K’yatharr*.

Victor, doing everything in his power not to vomit, held a hand to his mouth and quickly shut the door. In one swift motion, he locked the door, ran to the bathroom, and vomited. After he had composed himself, he made his way to his children’s room. He lightly knocked on the door before entering. The sight of his two children hiding under their covers broke his heart. He sat on the edge of Silas’ bed and cleared his throat, claiming the attention of both children.

“Your mother is very sick,” he began with a quavering voice. “I’m not sure what to do, at this point. There may not be anything we *can* do.” He looked at his children, both with tears forming in their eyes. Words failed him, and with a heavy heart he departed the bedroom, descending into his study. There, beneath the desk, he unlocked a safe to retrieve a revolver. He loaded the weapon with shaky hands, then positioned himself in the hallway between his insane wife, and terrified children. A brokenhearted sentinel. 

For an agonizing month, the night was tormented by the horrible and vile screams that ceased only in the morning light. Victor had become desperate, and thoughts of murder-suicide haunted him relentlessly. Finally, driven to the brink, Victor went to extremes. He sought out the aid of the secretive figure, Doctor Lucius Ravenscroft. Tales spoke of the doctor possessing knowledge of forbidden arts and remedies, capable of delving into the realms beyond what science could explain.

One dreary evening, Victor, Silas, and Evangeline had gathered in the downstairs study as Dr. Ravenscroft arrived at the Holloway residence under the veil of night. The Doctor rapped on the door, which was nearly drowned out by the howls of Genevieve. Victor quickly opened the door, beckoning Dr. Ravenscroft inside. Victor peered outside around his home, ensuring nosy eyes had paid no attention to the mysterious man.

Silas held the hand of Evangeline as they both stared in awe at Dr. Ravenscroft, who towered above them, and dressed in strange garb. He swiftly shed his black coat and hat, draping them over a chair. Grasped tightly in his left hand was a metal case, very reminiscent of a briefcase, that glinted in the dim light as it swayed with the doctor’s every move.

Victor approached Dr. Ravenscroft and slipped him an envelope of cash and the bedroom key. Without a word, Dr. Ravenscroft gave Victor a stiff nod of the head, and began to walk upstairs, unknowingly marching towards his own peril. With unwavering resolve and steady hand, he unlocked the door to Genevieve’s door.

Nausea washed over him as the sickening stench of decaying flesh, blood, and excrement assaulted Dr. Ravenscroft's senses. Peering into the darkness, he barely discerned the twisted form of Genevieve Holloway. Her once graceful figure had turned saggy and corpulent, every blue pulsating vein oozing with blackened blood. Sunken into her head, her emerald eyes had transformed into yellow marbles.

With razor-sharp teeth dripping with her own life's essence, Genevieve grinned at Dr. Ravenscroft. The room reverberated with a choking, guttural sound - her perverse laughter. Dr. Ravenscroft removed a smooth, jade amulet from his pocket and clasped it around his neck. He lightly traced a rune on the front of the amulet, causing a faint green glow to surround his body like misty armor.

In a swift motion, the doctor unlocked the case, retrieving a long stick of chalk and a handful of candles. He gripped the chalk tightly as he meticulously drew a massive triangle enclosed within a square. With precise movements, he positioned a lit candle on each corner of the geometric symbols, casting eerie shadows that danced upon the walls. From the case, he retrieved a strange device - a convergence of two metallic bars intersecting in the shape of a ‘T’, adorned with jagged shards of glass.

With closed eyes, Dr. Ravenscroft began to chant in a bizarre language under his breath. The flames of the candles swayed and flickered as invisible currents began to circle around the room. Genevieve’s yellow eyes watched intently as the flames danced. Her drooping mouth frowned and she grunted.

*“What sort of nonsensical charade is this, doctor?”* Genevieve asked, her wet, raspy breaths carrying a mix of confusion and malice.

Unwavering in his incantation, Dr. Ravenscroft raised the ‘T’ shaped device to the sky. The light of the flames began to reflect and refract off of the glass, shining a brilliant orange-yellow glow onto Genevieve’s monstrous form. As Dr. Ravenscroft opened his eyes, strange images flashed on the glass shards that faced him. 

In the reflection, Dr. Ravenscroft beheld the transformation of Genevieve’s fleshy form into a tall, dark figure with black flowing hair and yellow eyes. She towered over the coastline of Tarleg, as if ready to devour the land. A wicked smile parted her lips, revealing dagger-like teeth that tore into the water, releasing a billowing of green mist from the cracks.

 *“K’yatharr”* a deep, bone-chilling voice reverberated in the doctor’s head. At that moment, realization struck him. He looked into the creature’s eyes and drew a shallow breath before taking on a gravely serious expression.

“Why torment this woman?” he asked, while shifting the weight between legs, careful never to move outside of the chalk symbols or loosen his grasp on the device which showed him the truth. The monster’s eyes fluttered back in her head before glowing a brilliant amber. The smell of death grew stronger and shadows seemed to creep towards Dr. Ravenscroft.

*“Easy…to corrupt”* the creature slowly began. Each word sounded as if it was being choked out from the depths of her soul. *“Pain…is easy to manipulate. I need a body. Why not her? I need food. Why not the family? The fetuses?”*  she taunted.

Without hesitation, Dr. Ravenscroft cast the device to the ground, shattering the glass. Stomping out the candles, he disrupted the ethereal connection, unleashing a tempest within the confined space. Desperate, he fell to his knees and dug his fingernails into the floor, gripping for dear life to resist the chaotic force that sought to hurl him towards Genevieve’s monstrous form.

Upon hearing the noises from the upper floor, Victor mustered all his strength and raced up the stairs, flinging the door open with determination. However, the winds that filled the room immediately seized him, hurling him backwards into the hallway.

“What on earth is going on, Ravenscroft!?” Victor bellowed, barely audible amidst the howling of wind. Dr. Ravenscroft attempted to gesture for Victor to leave, but the moment he released his grip from the floor, he too was violently thrown against the wall.

Silas, also drawn by the commotion, arrived at the scene, eyes wide with alarm. He stood near his father, and both men looked at Dr. Ravenscroft with bewildered expressions. “You must stop her!” the doctor gasped, his voice strained against the screaming of currents. “K’yatharr…goddess of death…she possesses your wife!” he desperately tried to shout.

Victor and Silas stood paralyzed, their minds grappling with the horrifying reality that unfolded. Their gazes locked onto Dr. Ravenscroft as he drew a revolver and took aim towards Genevieve’s monstrous form. A thunderous blast echoed through the room, immediately followed by a sickening thud as the bullet flew through the air and buried itself into the wood, merely inches away from the doctor’s skull.

In an instant, the grotesque entity propelled herself across the room, her jaw unhinging unnaturally wide. She aimed for Dr. Ravenscroft but as her row of jagged teeth clenched down around his arm, she was propelled backwards. In a flash of bright green light, Dr. Ravenscroft shot backwards, through the wooden walls, and onto the wet grass outside before falling unconscious. The amulet that once hung from his neck laid in pieces next to him.

Genevieve’s monstrous form growled and chewed the small chunk of flesh she had ripped from the doctor. As the blood flowed down her fleshy body, she began to metamorphosize. The creature grew larger, sprouting extra limbs. With newfound mobility and strength, the creature hurled herself towards the door, knocking over Victor and Silas.

Before he could even realize what was happening, Silas was being ripped in half by the beast that once was his mother. The circular mouth of the monster began to chew at Silas’s exposed innards, and, with every bite, she grew larger and more monstrous. The sound of ripping, squelching flesh completely overwhelmed the screams that came from the child. 

Her maw opened, dropping the corpse of her dead son onto the ground with a wet, hollow *thunk.* Then, with a shudder that caused more veins to bulge, she turned her attention to Victor. Using her numerous bloated arms, she slowly crawled towards Victor as he quickly shuffled backwards, inching closer to the staircase. The creature let out a gurgling, choking sound and she crawled on top of the horrified man. Her nostrils flared and picked up the scent of blood and urine; Victor had soiled himself in fear. It would be his final act.

Victor opened his mouth to plead to the creature that used to be his wife but was immediately cut off as the creature’s maw clamped down upon his neck, severing his head from his body. A sickening, slurping sound followed as the rest of Victor’s body was sucked into the monster’s body, causing her to grow larger and sprout pudgy feet. She took waddling steps towards the staircase before falling down the flight of stairs.

With a piercing scream that shook the house, the abominable Genevieve creature painfully lifted herself up. She began to crawl towards the study where young Evangeline stood frozen in fear, tears streaming down her face as she squeezed her eyes shut. The grotesque version of her mother grew closer and closer, evoking a deepening sense of dread within the child. Each step from Genevieve’s form rattled the house and left bloody, pus-soaked footprints on the ground.

 When she finally made it to her horror-stricken daughter, Genevieve reached out a chubby, wet hand. It brushed across Evangeline’s face which caused the young child to cry louder and harder. *“Shhhh”* the creature choked out, its voice a mixture of familiarity and horror, causing Evangeline to shake violently. *“Evangeline…I will take care of you, daughter.”* 

Reluctantly, Evangeline slowly opened her eyes and found herself face-to-face with the monster that resembled her mother. Her chin trembled and she reached a hand out to touch her mother’s black, stringy hair.

“Mommy?” Evangeline whispered, her voice trembling with uncertainty. The monster, her mother, responded with a perverse smile. Her sharp teeth coated in the blood of their family.

*“Come here, baby. I will protect you”* Genevieve sputtered. She flopped her overweight and squishy body onto the ground, causing blood and mucus to slap onto the floor. Multiple appendaged extended towards Evangeline, beckoning her to come lay beside her mother. Evangeline slowly, reluctantly, obeyed. As Evangeline lay next to her mother, multiple arms descended upon her, stroking her hair in a parody of comfort. A constant, low shushing emitted from her mother as she kept her promise of protecting her daughter, eager to groom her for the role she would eventually play in her sick, cosmic plan.

The sound of the erupting room from the Holloway house, followed by the ejection of a man through the splintered wooden wall, caused alarm among those who lived nearby. The concerned citizens, unable to reach or catch sight of the family after such a violent event, contacted the authorities. In response, a pair of automaton officers were dispatched to investigate the house immediately. When they returned to the station with no new information, a full squad was mobilized within the hour. Genevieve slept peacefully.

After minutes of relentless knocking and demanding that the door be opened, the officers resorted to using force, crashing through the entrance in a shower of splintered wood. With revolvers drawn, the four officers spread out around the house, their voices echoing through the halls as they called out the names of those who were supposed to reside within the house.

As one of the officers cautiously entered the study, his eyes widened in disbelief and he nearly fainted. Before him lay a grotesque mass of stretched skin, blood, mucus, and bulging veins, accompanied by a tangle of protruding arms. It appeared to be sleeping. However, amidst this abomination, he noticed something that chilled him to his core - the body of a little girl, still alive.

The sound of unwelcome footsteps awoke Genevieve, her primal instincts kicking in. *“Youuu shouldn’t be hereeeee,”* Genevieve grumbled, her voice thick with malice, as she lifted herself up, exposing her complete monstrous form to the officer and leaving Evangeline vulnerable on the ground.

Reacting quickly, the officer released a barrage of six bullets into the horrifying figure looming in front of him. Instead of screams of pain, the monster emitted a wet, choking laugh. She lunged at the officer with a ferocious speed, tearing his leg from his body and showering her in his blood. He howled in pain, alerting the other officers to the location of the monster. The three all rushed to his aid, firing their weapons at the abomination.

Not even eighteen more bullets could take down the creature, and soon the four officers lay lifeless, their bodies becoming nutrients to the monster, who devoured and grew relentlessly, forgetting all about the little girl who lay right behind her.

Following her feast, Genevieve fell to the ground and sank into a deep slumber. She grunted and snored, spilling blood and mucus from all of her pores while she slumbered on her back. Standing over her mother’s repulsive form, Evangeline wept silently, mustering the strength to keep herself upright.

“I’m sorry, mommy,” she whispered before jumping on top of her mother’s writhing body.

Just as Genevieve began to awaken and comprehend the threat, Evangeline fought against her mother’s desperate attempt to throw her off. Digging her hands into the fleshy chest, Evangeline plunged deeper, relishing the warm, wet blood engulfing her arms.

Finally, she found her target - the pulsing, corrupted heart. Grasping firmly, she began to pull. A dozen of Genevieve’s arms coiled themselves around her, pushing upward, aligning perfectly with Evangeline’s hopes. The momentum of her upward thrust, gripping the monster’s heart, yanked it through her mother’s chest. Genevieve emitted a tormented, horrifying scream that shook the very foundations of the home. Evangeline threw the heart across the floor and as it skittered across the hall, she sprinted towards the front door, narrowly escaping before Genevieve unleashed another earth-shattering howl, causing the entire house to crumble, burying her beneath the rubble.

Breathing heavily and drenched in the blood of her deceased mother, Evangeline collapsed onto the grass next to Dr. Ravenscroft. She raised her gaze to the sky, unaware that the ancient deity that had possessed her mother had returned to the cosmic realm, its malevolence vanquished only for now. 

In the three, grueling years that Evangeline Holloway had been alive, she had experienced more horrors than one should see in a lifetime. Although she was merely a toddler, she had the sense that she had been freed from the grasp of the evil that had rooted itself within her home, but the misery of her life was just beginning.
