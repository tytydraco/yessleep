  
Kat and I have grown closer since her mother passed away five years ago. She even lived with my family for a few months afterwards while her father had a “discovery quest”, as she so aptly named it. Since moving in together as roommates on college campus we do pretty much everything together, except for my favorite time of year, Halloween. Every year since her mother’s passing she comes up with an excuse to bail on our Halloween get-togethers. The normal excuse is that she and her father are going to visit family. It’s an odd time to visit family if you ask me, but to each their own I guess.

“I suppose you’ll be off to see family again this Halloween?” I rolled my eyes. “You should really come hang out with us this year. It’ll just be us four from high school. You, me, Lisa, and Jen.” The Halloween party was a much bigger ordeal during our school days, but after the four of us went off to college it was important for me to keep the event going. It was tradition, not to mention that it personally gave me a sense of home.

“Okay Shelby. You win,” Kat sighed and bowed her head. Her eyes watered; the sadness was palpable.

“Are you okay? It’s not your family is it?”

“No, nothing like that. It’s just…nevermind, it’ll be fun,” Kat said, forcing a smile.

“Really? Kat you’re the best! I’ve got to tell Jen and Lisa the news!”

It was three days until we’d load up the car and head home for a night of scary fun. I was excited–and even more than normal because my best friend would be joining me this year.

On Halloween night the four of us drove the two hours back to the spot in the woods where we used to gather for the occasion. It was one of my favorite places; dark, scary, and isolated. I wished the trees could talk so that we could reminisce about our glory days. This place witnessed so many of our scary stories around the campfire and pranks over the years, it held a special place in my heart. The hay bales we dragged out years ago were still in the same place, a little worse for wear, but still familiar, like old friends at a high school reunion.  I felt at ease here, it was like home.

“Why don’t you two get the food and drinks out of the car while Kat and I go look for some wood for the fire,” I said to Jen and Lisa, doling out the necessary jobs to make this a successful night.

Jen smiled until it transformed into a loud laugh. She raised her eyebrows at Lisa and said, “Of course we’ll drink- er, I mean get the food and drinks from the car.” Lisa laughed and crept to the direction of where we left the car parked, and then took off in a dead sprint with Jen chasing.

“Get back here! That’s my booze!” Jen’s voice echoed through the woods as they disappeared behind the trees.

 It was just us four this year. The core of our friend-circle. The ones you could call on at 2 a.m. for a shoulder to cry on. The old days of a hundred or so kids out here were a lot of fun, but these three girls were my favorite people in the whole world. Kat and I left the other two girls behind and started scavenging into the heavy woods together.

We walked further in and one of the trees caught my attention. I pointed out the tree with an odd carving on it to Kat. 

“It looks like somebody else has been out here,” I said to Kat.

“Hey Shelby?” Kat’s voice shook.

“Yeah Kat?”

“Are you sure we should be out here? I mean, we could go to the movies or back to your house and hand out candy,” Kat said, looking for a way out.

“Oh Kat, you’ve never done this before. It’ll be a blast. You’ll see,” I reassured her.

She turned and frowned. Under her breath she sighed, “I tried.”

“What’s that?” I asked. I couldn’t make out exactly what she said, but something felt a little off about her. It was like hearing a song you knew the melody to but have forgotten the lyrics. You try different words, but something isn’t quite right. We gathered up enough sticks to get the fire started and walked back to the campsite. The Sun was setting behind the thick woods and we’d need to hurry if we were going to get a fire going before dark. Jen and Lisa were already sitting against the hay bales relaxing.

“Wake up girlies! Let’s get this fire started,” I said, while Kat and I plopped the wood down in the middle of the hay bales. She pulled out a lighter and lit the small pieces of kindling.

“Uh Kat? Why do you have a lighter?” I asked. She didn’t smoke and I couldn’t think of a reason she’d be carrying one around with her. If she’d taken up the nasty habit, wouldn’t she have let her best friend in on her little secret?

“Oh, uh. It’s Dad’s. He told me to bring it just in case,” she answered. 

It was the first time in all of our years together that I’d seen her with a lighter. I found it odd, but brushed it off and poked around at the sticks in an attempt to spread the flames. We coaxed the fire to a nice roar and each sat on a different hay bale. An hour passed and night fully cloaked the surrounding woods in darkness. The time had come for my favorite part.

“Okay, are you guys ready to get creeped out?” I asked, excited to hear what they’d come up with. Jen and Lisa sat up in anticipation, but Kat still didn’t look like she wanted to be there.

“Hey Kat, are you okay?” I asked. She got up and sat on the hay beside me. 

She leaned in and whispered in my ear, “We shouldn’t be here.”

“Geez, will you give it a rest? We’ve done this a hundred times. It’ll be fine,” I said, looking at Jen and Lisa to assess the mood. “Why don’t you start us off, Kat? Maybe it’ll make you forget about whatever’s bothering you.” 

Kat dropped her head, stood up, and walked back to her hay bale. She slowly turned back towards us–it gave me chills. I thought that she played perfectly into our night of telling scary stories. The flickering firelight lit up her face as she stood in front of us. Her expression changed, something more sinister was hiding behind her eyes. *Either this was going to be a fantastic story, or something weird is going on with her.* The nagging poked at me again. Something wasn’t right.

“Okay ladies, this is the first time I’ve ever done this, so be gentle with me. Have you heard the story about the old witch that used to live out in the woods near this very campsite?” Kat revealed a devilish sneer in the firelight.

“This is gonna be good!” Jen said, leaning in closer from her side of the fire.

Lisa turned to me with a jolt, her eyebrows raised and eyes wide, as if to say, *What is happening right now?* Apparently I wasn’t the only one to see the crazed look that Kat had manifested. 

“I’ll call this story, ‘The Mother’,” Kat said, continuing to radiate her newly found ominous aura. “It was Halloween night…,” she started.

“Just like now!” Jen interrupted, excitement getting the best of her.

“Shhh, Jen. Let her tell it,” I scowled. “Go ahead, Kat.”

“It was Halloween night nearly five years ago now. Four girls went deep into the forest for a night of partying and fun,” Kat said pointedly as she peered deep into our eyes, one set after the other. “They began their trek through the woods, none of them knowing it was the final time they’d see daylight. On the way out to look for a good place to camp, one of the girls noticed an odd symbol carved into a tree. At first the girls blew it off. It wasn’t the first time they’d seen a carving in a tree. But the deeper into the woods they went, the more symbols they noticed. They eventually settled on a nice, clear, flat spot surrounded by the dark woods. So, into the night they went, drinking and partying. After a while the girls agreed it would be a good time to tell ghost stories around the campfire. One of the girls stood up and began to tell the story of ‘The Mother’. As she started, the girls heard branches cracking in the dark woods behind them. There was one singular set of footsteps, and then a long silence. They figured it was probably just a deer or some other animal passing by. The story of ‘The Mother’ continued. The girls were enthralled; until they heard more footsteps behind them. This time closer.” Kat stopped.

“Kat? Hey Kat?” I got up and waved my hand over her eyes, but she didn’t respond. There was a far off look in her eyes. Physically, she was standing in front of me, but mentally, she was somewhere else.

***-Snap. Crunch. Crunch.***

The rhythmic sound of walking faintly sounded through the woods behind us.

“What is that? I’m freaking out right now Shelby. I want to go home!” Jen said as she put a vice grip on my arm and hid behind me.

“Kat! Wake up Kat!” I screamed. Nothing. She was in some sort of trance.

***-Crunch. Crunch. Crunch.***

The leaves beneath the footsteps were louder. We all stared into the darkness, begging our eyes to reveal this *thing* in the darkness. 

“These three lives the mother takes. The mother sleeps, the mother wakes,” Kat chanted. Her voice distorted and dropped two full octaves in tone. “These three lives the mother takes. The mother sleeps, the mother wakes,” the voice chanted again, this time a little louder than the first.

“Kat! Kat wake up!” I yelled, running around to see her face. Her eyes were completely white; no color, no iris, no pupil. “We have to get out of here! Jen, Lisa, come on, let’s go!” 

“These three lives the mother takes. The mother sleeps, the mother wakes. These three lives the mother takes. The mother sleeps, the mother wakes,” Kat continued louder in the demonic voice that had stolen her sound away.

***-Crunch. Snap. Crunch. Crunch.***

The footsteps were on top of us now.

“Girls? Girls! It’s me!” the familiar voice of Kat’s father echoed from the darkness as he emerged from the woods. “It’s gonna be okay. Let’s all just calm down.”

“These three lives the mother takes. The mother sleeps, the mother wakes!” Kat stretched out her arms to the sky, like a bird displaying its wingspan. Her feet slowly lifted and floated up from the ground. What were we witnessing? We were frozen in disbelief as Kat rose higher and higher, coming to a hover six feet above our heads.

***\~Shunk.***

Lisa looked at me in shock as blood seeped from the corners of her mouth and the light left her eyes.

“I’m sorry,” Kat’s father said, tears streaming down his cheeks. “I’m sorry. I’m sorry. I’m sorry.”

***\~Shunk.***

Before we could realize what was happening, Kat’s father stabbed his knife into Jen’s chest. “I’m sorry,” he sobbed, holding her limp body as he lowered it gently to the ground.

“Kat! Help us!” I yelled at the body of Kat hovering like a helicopter in the air.

***\~Shunk.*** 

The pain in my lower back was unbearable. I looked up at Kat as I felt warm blood stream down the back of my legs. 

“Kat! Why?” I yelled up to her as my balance gave and I fell to my knees.

***-Snap. Crunch. Crunch.*** 

New footsteps approached beyond the dark tree-line. Kat descended back to the earth below, color spread back into her eyes.

“Mom?” Kat yelled into the darkness of the woods. I picked my head up one last time before my world faded to black. 

The figure of a woman emerged from the darkness.   
“Mom!”
