I used to be a roadie for one of the more popular end bands. I won’t outright say their name, but I’m sure we all know who I’m talking about. Anyway, I had only recently started working for them. And it was definitely an honor. I mean, I got to see them live nearly every month, and I got to hold and clean their instruments. I drove them to each concert. Really, I was super grateful. It was just.. Well… we haven't really talked very much. A casual hello now and then, but I’ve never had a full on conversation with one of the band members.

After being with them for over a year, I started to get curious about things. For instance, I had always seen them leaving with one or two people from the concert. This wasn’t extremely unusual. I mean, every band has a group of people that follow them around concert to concert, and… well you know the rest. I try to stay out of it as much as possible, but as a roadie, I had to escort them to places. It can be uncomfortable at times, but I just try to make it to the next paycheck. We had reached a hotel, and I’m told to wait outside. I watch as all six members of the band walk inside with this group and I try to mind business.

From previous, let’s say, endeavors, I know this process normally takes a few hours. Sometimes the whole night. So I patiently wait in the bus. Sometimes I get a call, or a text from one of the members telling me to pick them up. So I wait in the buss until then. I typically distract myself by watching some videos on my phone, or calling home to talk to my daughter. She’s always jealous that I get to tour with her favorite band. But I’m off topic. 

So I’m waiting in the bus, and it’s nearly 4:00. Nothing out of the ordinary I guess, but one of them typically always sends a message by at least 3:45. It’s a hassle leaving one of these hotels when you’re famous. I try to get them out of there at the very latest 5:00. Before too many people get up and start their day. Before paparazzi take photos of the group leaving the hotel and more a whole ordeal. 

I decided to go ahead and warn them by shooting them a text message. Ten minutes later, no reply. I text one of the other members. Twenty minutes later, again, no reply. I assume they’ve fallen asleep. Against better judgment, I walk inside the hotel. I don’t want to be intrusive, but we haven’t much time left. It’s nearly 4:30 already. I talked to the lady behind the desk and asked if she knew what room they were in. She was very polite about it, but said that she isn't allowed to give that information out to people. And of course she would, I was just some stranger, she had no evidence that I actually knew these people. She said she could call the room for me instead. 

She pushes a few numbers, and the phone began to ring. No answer. She apologized and said “I wish there was more I could do.” I pause and think for a moment. “Could you ring them one more time? Please? Just one more time and I’ll be out of your way.” With a bit of hesitance she picked up the phone and pushed the same numbers. “*2 5 2*” I thought to myself. Which means it was the 52nd room on the second floor. I let it ring all the way through, I didn’t really expect an answer. 

“Actually, it’s okay. I’ll just wait a while longer.” I said as she put down the phone. I turned around and started walking towards the door. “Actually” I said turning back around, “Could you point me in the direction of the bathroom? It’s been a while since we last stopped.” She pointed politely down the hall. “Last door on your right” she said. “Thank you!” I said walking past the desk. I went all the way down the hall where she pointed. Until I saw the stairs. I took one look behind me to make sure she wasn’t looking then hit the stairs. “*Second floor, room 201. Great, all the way on the other side*” I thought to myself. I quickly walked past the doors, trying not to make too much noise. I reached the other end and quickly looked for room 201. I was hesitant to approach it. An eerie red glow, only faintly noticeable, came from beneath the door. My ear parallel to the door, I tried my best to discern the low voices coming from inside. I was paralyzed, too scared to knock on the door. Too frozen to move away. They must have sensed me, or heard me somehow, because all at once the mummering stopped. I backed away from the door, waiting for something to happen. Anything, but after a brief moment which felt like an eternity, nothing. I can't say what came over me, but I tried to open the door, only to find that it was locked. I tried budging it open. I hear light concerned whispers. I budge it once more with all of my strength. I didn’t know what was behind the door at the time, but my gut was telling me I couldn’t leave it there. 

The door flung open, and I saw all the members of the band. The lights were dim, red candles with a pentagram on the floor. I saw the group of ladies piled together in the middle, their bodies mangled and broken. I vividly remember one girls eye sockets open, and empty. I still have nightmares about it to this day.

I stumbled back in shock, The band members were all frantically panicking. Just as scared as me. I couldn’t  form a thought. “Oh Fuck! Oh Fuck! What is the roadie doing here??” one of the member shouted. “Quick get him!” another commanded. I quickly slammed the door. Running back down the hallway. I looked back watching as two of the five began to chase me. I’m surprised that none of the commotion had caused anyone to peer outside their rooms. It was as if we were alone on the floor. I ran all the way back to the stairs from which I had come from. I quickly surfed down the flight and rammed myself through the exit. I dared not look back, but I heard each of their footsteps, one after the other, coming down just as quickly as I had. I ran past the front counter, “Call the police!!” I shouted without a reply. “Anybody!” I shouted again. “*Was this hotel empty??”* I had thought.

The front counter was barren, the lady who had politely pointed me in the direction of the bathroom had disappeared. I look over my shoulder as I run into the lobby, they’re catching up, quickly at that. I lost my footing and tumbled onto the ground, but quickly got back on my feet. I heard them shouting at me, I can’t remember exactly what they had said, but I know it wasn’t exactly friendly. 

After I made it outside, I barely entered the tour bus before they grabbed me. I slammed the doors shut, and tried starting the engine, but the battery was giving out. I turn the key again ignoring they’re pleads to be let in.

“Come on man! Let us explain!”  
“It’s really not what you think!” the other screamed.

I turn the key again. And by the grace of God, the engine sputtered to life. I shifted into drive and got my ass out of there. I watched as they partly kept up as I drove away. Their faces slowly disappearing from the door window. I glanced every other second in the rearview, watching as they quickly got further and further away. Before I completely lost sight of them. After that, I obviously quit the job. It’s been nearly a month now, and I still get a little nervous whenever I hear my daughter playing their music. 

Anyways, I was hoping to see if anyone here had similar experiences? I think they might have my home address if they look back at my resume. I’m scared we’ll have to move out of state, or even the country.
