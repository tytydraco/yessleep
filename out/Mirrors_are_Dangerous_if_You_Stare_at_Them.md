I found out about the mirror dare from a close friend at school, Calvin. He was always amongst the upper echelon of students when it came to grades and stayed at the school library after hours to continue studying and completing his homework. That was also where we’d spend the most time together with our friends. He brought up the mirror dare during our 5th period calculus class but only mentioned the name, and promised he would explain more in the library. 

You’d never know it by a first impression, since he wore polo shirts and boot cut jeans and carried himself in an academically nerdy way, but Calvin was also really into scary and creepy stuff. He always wanted to talk about media like Resident Evil, the Saw movies, and campfire-esque stories. He’s actually the reason I found this subreddit, so thanks Calvin. 

I always loved to listen to him explain stories or universes he would read about or experience in a video game. A few days ago it seemed no different when he brought up the mirror dare. We were hanging out in the library with two other friends, Jamie and Sam, when Calvin pulled up on his phone some barebones forum from God only knows what grimey corner of the internet. He then read allowed the rules of the dare.

**Find any clean mirror you can stand 6 inches from.**

**Stare at yourself in the mirror.**

**Stand completely still.**

**See how long you can last.**

Sam, a friend of mine I’ve known since preschool, cutely laughed upon hearing the last rule. 

“That’s just bait to prove how shot our attention spans are. I bet you a boomer posted that out of spite for kids our age. It’s not our fault our childhoods are more entertaining than slapping mud with sticks and stones and listening to a radio.” She ranted

Sam’s wit was unmatched in my opinion. This was probably why I had a pretty big crush on her, which I hid, us being friends for so long and all. I don’t know why she hung out with our small socially inept group.

“No, no.” Jamie pitched in. “The dude's name is ‘SonicProMaster2017’, I’d believe he’s more likely to be 7 than 77, any day.” He said pointing at the username above the post.

“We could ask him.” I jokingly responded

“Hell naw, Luke. The people that post on here are weird. I don’t wanna be roped into any contact with those types.” Calvin rejected.

Sitting on a couch in the library we argued over who the poster of the mirror dare could be, whether he lived in his grandparents basement or in a public park bathroom, and whether or not we should try the mirror dare. Initially we all thought it was stupid and decided to share funny TikToks with each other until we got kicked out for not ‘using the library in an appropriate manner’. Calvin was a little pissed at this since he didn’t want to be barred from his favorite after school hangout spot. 

We were strolling down the halls until Sam made a proposal.

“Why don’t we just go to the bathroom and try it?”

It was easy enough to agree too. We didn’t have anything else to do, and so we decided to find one of the individual sized school restrooms with a lock and carry out the mirror dare. Or at least try. It was less of a full commitment to the dare and more of a bit we acted out. We made Jamie lean over the bathroom sink and stare at himself in the splotch stained and cracked mirror since he was the most apprehensive to volunteer.

As he stared at himself, Sam stuck her finger in her mouth, really marinating it, and gave Jamie a sopping wet willy. His concentration was decimated yet he tried again. The entire dare session consisted of tickling Jamie, us moaning from the stall, acting like there was a poltergeist in the bathroom, and also Calvin crunching chips loudly in Jamie’s ear refusing to give him any because ‘the mirror man said no’.

Jamie, reasonably, was done with his part in the mirror dare and we all decided to go our separate ways and head home.

I tried it again in my bedroom. I have a standing mirror, roughly 6 feet tall, tucked in between my dresser and computer desk. A persuasive curiosity grabbed a hold of me when I was playing games on my computer. I had a headache and took a break from any blue light or screens. But then, of course, I got bored just sitting around doing nothing. Maybe the forum boomer was right. 

I decided to do the mirror dare myself. At some point in the school bathroom we somehow managed to break every single rule. I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t horsing around because I was scared to some extent. Maybe the others were too. Except Jamie, he doesn’t have much going on up there.

But now I had the urge to do it right. So I stood there, a few inches away, and stared at myself. Initially it had the effects I was hoping for. My breathing had slowed down to a meditative pace. My mind felt clear. How much of that was owed to the dare or just because I wasn’t stimulating my brain, I don’t know. But it was undeniably calming. 

Ironically, as I kept staring at my features I’ve grown so familiar with, the more unfamiliar they became. It’s like when you think about a word for too long and notice how odd it’s spelled or pronounced. It just felt weird. 

I had never taken the time to actually look at myself in this analytical way. So close, so oddly personal, so unrecognizable. I know what I look like. I, like everyone else, see myself everyday when I brush my teeth and get ready for the day or when looking at a photo I’m in. I knew it was me I was looking at, but it didn’t just feel like me.

Yet, It wasn’t concerning. I assumed I just never had the chance to look at myself for so long and so intensely. What was concerning was when my face began to move on its own. Not any large super noticeable movements, but small ones that I wasn’t actively trying to make. Like micro twitches of the eye or the corner of my mouth. Enough to make me question if I was actually doing that.

At some point I began peering into my own eyes. Questions rose whether those were my eyes staring back at me. A primal sensation loomed over me. One that said I was allowing another person, a stranger, to watch me so closely. It emerged and disappeared just as quickly. It was silly to think that. It was just my reflection. Then my nose began bleeding.

That ended the dare for me then. It was just so sudden and unexpected that I reached for my face without thinking and broke my concentration. It wasn’t real. I wiped my fingers on my nose and there was nothing. Of course there wasn’t, ‘Just another psychologically explainable mind trick, I’m sure.’ I thought to myself. I looked back at my clock. 11:25pm. I had only stared for 9 minutes.

The following school day we were playing basketball in my P.E. class, starting with layup drills. We formed a line and would all run under the hoop and shoot a layup then circle around to the line. Since this was the first drill I assumed it would be the easiest. I would never find out how difficult the others were because when I jumped to layup my basketball something clocked me right in the nose.

It was a flicker of darkness followed by a numb bruising pain. The tip of my nose was shrieking where my skin was cut up. I didn’t know blood could gush from anyone's nostrils so fast. The gym coach immediately rushed to my aid and handed me a spare jersey to hold under my nose. He told me to skip the remainder of class and head to the nurse’s office.

I may be a bit dramatic, it wasn’t that bad. The blood stopped within the hour and my nose survived with only lingering irritation where a very thin layer of skin used to be. Thankfully that was my last class of the day and I could tell my friends what had happened in the library. Of course, the mirror dare was the first thing that came up.

“How long, Luke?” Jamie asked.

“Only 9 minutes. Didn’t feel that long, though.” I remarked while feeling my tender nose.

“Anything spooky happen? Did you see a ghost? Did Bloody Mary show up?” Sam butted in.

“No, dumbass. She only appears when you say her name three times.” Jamie said

“I didn’t see anything too weird or unexplainable. I guess the longer I looked the more my face felt like it was morphing or changing. Kinda felt strange. But I think that’s just because I was going brain dead staring for so long. Made me feel gullible for trying it.”

“You were brain dead before the dare.” Sam said before looking at me. “That’s a real schnozzer you got there, bud.”

Bud. That hurt more than the basketball.

“I got pelted in the face with an air ball at the gym. Asshole was shooting from the three-point during a layup drill. Ruined my shirt.” I said, unzipping my hoodie to show everyone my blood stained shirt collar. They all cringed at the sight. “It’s funny, I thought I had a nosebleed yesterday while looking in the mirror– which had freaked me out more than it actually did today. Otherwise I would’ve gotten farther than 9 minutes.”

Calvin glanced at me swiftly, seemingly an unconscious reaction. I only now noticed the bags under his eyes. Jamie and Sam and I sometimes questioned Calvin’s health when he wasn’t around to hear. We didn’t know much about his home life but assumed it wasn’t the best considering he always wanted to be at school. 

Sometimes he would show up looking drained, wearing the same clothes as he wore the previous day, but today he looked much more tired. You would’ve thought he was aggressively hungover if you didn’t know Calvin never even knew what alcohol tasted like.

“Wait, wait, wait.” Sam said abruptly. “You can’t just not put that together– am I the only one that thinks that’s weird?” 

“No, that's definitely weird. Luke, you idiot, you’re saying you saw your nose bleed during the dare and then it actually bled later on? You’re a fortune teller!” Jamie cheered.

I did feel dumb for not putting it together. But I also felt a sense of fear now that I realized the eerie connection. As Jamie and Sam laughed at the joke, Calvin stayed quiet. His gaze had never left me.

“I bet I can get the longest time tonight. Your 9 minutes are cooked, Luke!” Jamie spouted

And with that, we left the library with the plan to try the mirror dare once again. We all agreed. Some of us more excited than others. To rephrase, I decided not to do it that night. When they had brought up the whole bloody nose thing I began feeling an irrational fear similar to what a child would feel sleeping in a dark bedroom. I knew it was a silly thing to be scared of, yet I still felt afraid. 

I was so paranoid that when I had to use the toilet that night I entered the bathroom with my eyes closed and blasted hot water from the sink. When I was sure the mirror had fogged up, and when I couldn’t hold it anymore, I opened my eyes and entered to do my business. I was deeply fearful of my own reflection. It was embarrassing.

The next day Calvin was absent from our Calculus class. I tried texting him but he didn’t respond. That guy *never* missed school. 

“Calvin not responding to you guys either?” Sam asked as we all sat in the library.

Jamie and Sam had been calling him throughout the day with no response. We would’ve asked his parents where he was, but none of us had their numbers let alone even met them.

“You think he died? He looked like a Tim Burton character yesterday” Jamie said

“Jamie. Shut up.” Sam said disregarding him.

“You shut up. I bet I got a longer time than you.” He said in a snarky voice.

“36 minutes.” Sam dropped casually.

“3.” Jamie mumbled.

I couldn’t fathom looking in the mirror for that long. I thought that Sam must’ve had the patience of a monk. 

“I don’t wanna do it again.” She added. “It was like what Luke said; I felt like I didn’t recognize myself after a while. I thought it was silly at first, too, but then I got this numb feeling. Like I was comfortable just standing there and looking at myself. And more and more I felt like I was looking at someone else. Like someone else was bending over and staring back at my face. I got… scared. But it was like luring me in, you know?”

We both stared at her blankly. I tried processing what she was saying, how it was similar to what I had felt. But Jamie might’ve just thought she was crazy.

“But yeah. I’m done. Not for me.” Sam threw her arms up and shook her head.

“I’ll beat it.” I said unprompted.

The words just came out of my mouth. I wanted to impress Sam and in the moment I shoved down all the fear I suffered through two days before.

“Ooh, okay. You should FaceTime me so I can watch you do it. That way I know you’re not cheating.” Sam said, tapping my healing nose.

This was the first time Sam had asked for something like this. Something one on one. My fears were suddenly pushed aside, overwhelmed with a warm excitement. All I could think about now was our time spent alone together, even if it was just over a video chat.

Later at home, I called Sam and propped my phone on the dresser facing myself and the mirror. She answered immediately and her cheerful face appeared on the screen. Soon after I found myself staring at my own. 

“I wanna ask questions while you’re doing this so blink twice for yes and three times for no. Okay?” She said before starting the timer.

I blinked twice.

“Good.” She chuckled.

And so I began staring at myself. It didn’t really hit me what I was doing until I was looking deeply into my own eyes again. I could feel my heart racing until Sam spoke again.

“Do you really think you can beat my time?” She asked

I blinked twice.

“Well I’m not trying it anymore. So if you beat me the record is yours.” Sam said acting disappointed then following it up with more laughter.

I wanted to ask what my prize would be if I won. I almost broke my concentration to say it but stopped myself. It was probably best I didn't, too cheesy. Then the face twitching started again. I could feel the miniscule muscles in my cheeks clenching ever so slightly.

“You see your face twitching?” Sam asked.

I blinked twice.

“You at the point where you see any movements you can’t feel?”

I scanned my face carefully and noticed my lip had quivered– or might have, I wasn’t too sure. I guess that was enough to confirm it. I blinked twice.

“It’s so weird how that works. I don’t like thinking about my body moving on its own.” She said, her voice sounding more distant from her phone. 

Maybe she was off doing something while I stared at the mirror. That’s when I felt something different. Something… new, that I hadn’t felt last time. Gentle brushing on my face like a soft breeze was caressing my skin. Sam must’ve noticed my discomfort.

“You must be seeing something I can’t see 'cause from here everything still looks fine.”

I blinked three times.

“Well, you’re 10 minutes in now. Get it together.” She said.

That gave me a small boost of energy. However, it was quickly stripped away once I heard crunching. It was very audible, like she was chewing right by her phone. I began blinking slow and rhythmically hoping she would get the idea.

“Ah, sorry. I forgot. I’ll just mute myself until I’m done. Wanted to get popcorn for the show.” She apologized.

‘Thank God.’ I thought to myself. 

And then I noticed something weird as my mind was drawn away from her words. I was angry. Like, my face looked angry even though I didn’t feel angry. Eyebrows furrowed, chin and lips scrunched, full on mad. I was a little annoyed when Sam was crunching in my ear but now I looked cartoonishly enraged. It was extremely odd. 

My brain didn’t know what to do, seeing my expression so intense yet I felt no tension in my face. It felt like my brain was attempting to mimic a feeling of tension that should be there around my chin and nose and cheeks and brow.

The mix of witnessing this angry expression and being unfamiliar with the face before me, a sudden urge to help this man erupted. I wanted to talk with him, I wanted to know what made him so angry as to see if I could help him. I don’t mean to sound narcissistic or self pitying because that is not where this feeling came from, but I wanted to bond with this stranger in the mirror.

“I know you like me… and that you’re doing this for me.” Sam suddenly spoke.

Her voice surprised me, and that grim expression subtly morphed to that of a neutral one as if my brain was recorrecting what I was truly seeing. My chest fluttered with emotions at just that single sentence.

“Just sitting here… watching you… I realize how brave you are, Luke.” Her voice sprinkled all over me like a soft misty rain. “I notice you looking at me at school. The way you’ve always looked at me when you thought I didn’t see you.” She giggled.

It was at this moment I realized I could stand here forever. Forever looking into the mirror and hearing the voice of a girl I’ve known my whole life. Until an abrupt ‘ding’ erupted from my phone.

“I finished eating. Damn, I feel bloated.” She spoke candidly.

She had unmuted herself.

My heart wilted over and died at the sudden realization that the voice I heard speaking may have not been Sam’s. It felt so real. What I just heard had to be real. Her voice was so clearly audible from the phone’s speakers. This wasn’t just something that my brain could conjure up for me.

My breathing was on pace with my heartbeat. I could see my chest heaving and shuttering in the mirror. The thought of looking at my phone dashed through my head, but it just felt wrong. Like I wasn’t supposed to. Like if I looked away from the mirror I would be in trouble.

“Luke, are you Alright? Remember to blink for me, okay?” She said.

That’s right, maybe I could let her know something was wrong. I blinked three times for ‘no’. Sam didn’t acknowledge it. I tried it again. Still nothing.

“Is my phone frozen?” Her casual tone worried me even more.

I tried rapidly blinking. I saw flashes of my face interrupted by darkness. I blinked as hard and fast as I could just hoping she would say something.

“Your head’s still moving, you know. You’re not funny.”

She really couldn’t see me blinking. I had tried everything. So I stopped and kept my eyes open. My reflection continued to blink. If I already wasn’t able to move, that would’ve paralyzed me with the fear I felt. No man was supposed to see themselves with closed eyes. It felt like a stranger was invading my space and there was nothing I could do about it. 

I wanted to cry so bad, to feel the tears run down my cheeks. At least that was something I would’ve been able to control. But it didn't matter. I knew I wasn’t in control anymore. Whatever the mirror dare was, I had taken it too far. And there might be no return.

Then the mirror image of myself leaned back slowly, only centimeters a second. It leaned farther and farther and farther, falling into my mirrored dim bedroom. And then with a loose and limp neck, it swung its forehead at the mirror— at me. 

I heard the thump, the crack of the mirror, and I reflexively flinched away. I stood with my hands raised in front of my face, as if to shield myself, lowering them as I grew accustomed to the lack of intense focus I was just freed from. I could move again.

“Sam?” I pleaded.

She didn’t answer. I grabbed my phone on the dresser and was confused to find that it was dead. I had fully charged it when I got home from school, there was no way it was dead now. 

‘How long was I staring at myself?’ I had thought. I ran for the kitchen where I knew the stove had a clock on it. It was 1am. I had been staring at myself in the mirror for 8 hours. Far longer than what I expected. I just stood there staring at the clock as I had done with my reflection. 

“Luke, is that you? Where the Hell have you been? We've been trying to find you for the past hour.” My Dad said, barging into the kitchen and switching the lights on.

“I’ve been in my room.” I said. But my voice came out monotone and slow. I had felt like I took a nap that was hours longer than expected and had awoken in the middle of the night.

“Your Mom and I tried knocking on your door, calling, searching for your location on your phone, nothing was working! You can’t just ghost out on us like that!” He was becoming passionately angry. A caring parental wrath emerged within his voice. 

“My phone was dead. I’m sorry. I don’t know when it died.” I said. 

My Dad continued to lecture me on updating them on my whereabouts and always keeping my phone charged, but I was more worried about whatever the hell I had just experienced. When my Dad decided he was too tired to ramble on at me, I immediately returned to my room and threw my phone on the charger. Missed call notifications flooded in from Sam and my parents. Along with a few text messages from Sam.

*9:53pm - Dude, are you okay?*

*10:01pm - I can’t tell if you can hear me or not can you please respond?*

*10:05pm - I’m really close to calling 911 you’re scaring me.*

*12:16am - What you did was extremely rude and upsetting. I was so worried about you and after pleading with you for so long you just smile at me and the phone hangs up? Was I even FaceTiming you or was that just a video? If this is a prank you’re insane and need help. It’s like you don’t even consider me a friend.*

In a panic, I was about to call Sam back to apologize, to tell her I was okay, that I don’t remember doing any of that. I don’t know what I could have possibly said that didn’t make me seem crazy. I remember picturing her in my mind yelling to get my attention as I stared at myself blankly. I didn’t like thinking about what I was doing during that span of time where my memory seemingly disappeared. I decided to hold off on texting Sam. I had to call Calvin. He was the only person I could think of that possibly had any idea of what was happening to me.

He picked up immediately. The call was silent for a moment.

“Hello?” I said.

“Hi, Luke.” Calvin said, oddly energetic and confident sounding at the early hours of the AM.

I attempted telling him everything that had happened, minus the part that Sam was watching the whole thing. I was still embarrassed and scared about that and wasn’t ready to accept everything yet.

“You shouldn’t have stopped looking!” He screamed into the phone. His tone switched entirely from friendliness to pure rage.

He hung up immediately after that. I tried calling him. The ringer abruptly stopped and I was sent to voicemail. I just sat there full of confusion and fear. I had so many questions that I was afraid to have answered. I decided I was going to stay awake the entire night, partially on my phone and partially sitting in silence doing nothing. I didn’t want to be unconscious again.

There was a knock at my window. Booming and strong enough to jolt me out of my stagnant bed-rotting trance. I looked over at my white curtains. Another knock. My legs were shaking, not knowing if they should carry me to the window or keep me still and hidden. I decided not to move.

“I know you’re there.” A muffled yet familiar voice called from outside.

I don’t know if it was the fatigue or the come down from an adrenaline rush accumulated throughout the evening that lowered my guard, but I decided to investigate. I slowly crept up from my bedside and ran my hands down the curtain, pulling it slightly aside. A figure stood right below the window. His face barely revealed in the moonlight. It was Calvin.

“Let me in. Now.” Calvin said with a blank expression.

I had never seen him so serious. I almost forgot about the way he yelled at me over the phone just less than 2 hours ago. And now he was outside my room. I didn’t know exactly where Calvin lived, but I knew his home was two towns over. He had to have walked since he didn’t have a car.

“Calvin? What the hell are you doing here?” I groaned.

“Open the window. I need to help you.” He said.

Talking to him, I noticed he looked even more disheveled than I must have. Like he had followed through with staying up for more nights than I did. 

“Why didn’t you answer our calls yesterday, dude? We were worried about you.” I asked him.

He didn’t bother answering that, either. I was not going to let Calvin in. Something was off enough for me to realize, even with my mental fog and general grogginess, that whatever he was trying to do his intentions weren’t in my favor. He must’ve realized this when I just stood there behind the glass, because he was now trying to hoist the window up. I watched it lift upwards a few inches before realizing what was happening.

I immediately fought back, pushing the window down so I could lock it. But he reached his arm through and pulled hard on my shirt to lift himself up even more. He knocked me off balance and my face smushed into the window. When I steadied myself again, pushing against the glass, I saw that the window was open even more. He was about to get in, having lunged through the frame which his chest now rested on. 

I clawed and slammed my fists into his arm, but he kept his grip on me as he shoved the window open with the other hand. I tried reaching down and shoving the palm of my hand onto his face. That's when he grabbed my arm and pulled me. I was yanked down by his weight, my head knocking onto the bottom of the frame. He was still using me and the window to hoist himself up. 

Then everything went black as Calvin lost his footing on the side of my house, falling to the ground with one hand on me and the other on the wooden trim on top of the window pane. The window came down on my neck like a guillotine.

When I awoke at the hospital, a long process that consisted of waves where I dipped in and out of consciousness, everything above my chest was in severe pain. A nurse was present when I awoke, but I could barely speak let alone move my head to get her attention. 

I resorted to rapping the metal hospital bed frame with my knuckles. When she realized I was awake, she brought my parents. It was hard watching my Mom hold back tears, but my Dad reassured her and I that everything would be okay and the doctors told them I’d recover within a few months. 

It was explained to me at some point by the nurse and my parents that my neck was broken. Police were called and assumed I was fighting off an intruder due to the ripped shirt and bruised arms; signs of a struggle. I had to tell them what happened with the notes app on my phone, that Calvin had tried to break in and accidentally slammed the window on me, or at least I’d hoped it was an accident. I still try to believe that it was. When I told them what had happened, my parents assured me they would bring this information to the police.

Later that day, Sam and Jamie visited me. When they walked into my hospital room, they carried with them a box roughly the size of a milk crate. They sat by me, setting the box on a nearby table, and told me how glad they were that I was making a full recovery. I appreciated the sentiment of their visit, but was too tired to respond with my phone. I just smiled at them. Before they left, Sam told me something that brought back the fear I felt while I was staring at the mirror.

“Calvin gave us this at school during lunch. He mentioned he was sorry about what happened. Obviously we had no clue what he was talking about at the time, but he wanted to be sure that we gave you his present. Your parents told us what he did so I guess if you want us to throw it out we can.” She explained.

I blinked three times.

“Want us to open it for you?” Jamie asked.

I blinked twice.

Sam and I watched as Jamie tore open the cardboard box. Something shiny emerged from the packing peanuts and paper. Jamie lifted it. It was a mirror. They decided to leave it on the table facing away from where I lay, which was alright with me. Just glancing at the dark black screen of my phone when it’s turned off scared me enough to avoid typing this out. But I found resilience with enough time. It gets boring doing nothing all day but wishing you could move freely again. 

Knowing what I know now, I'm not sure how I can live a normal life. Brushing my teeth won't be a big deal, but shaving might be harder. I'm always gonna have to ask for second opinions on outfits and rely on others to tell me how I look. I just can't imagine myself being near a mirror and not thinking about what happened that night. What might happen again.

I wanted to share this as a warning. Do not emulate anything I did. Do not stare into mirrors too long. You will regret it.
