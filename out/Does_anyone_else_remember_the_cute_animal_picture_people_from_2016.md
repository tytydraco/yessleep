I've been using the internet since I was 14 and embraced the online world and the communities on it as somewhat of a second world whenever I'm bored or have free time. I first started using it through Google+ when Youtube required you to have a Google+ account and use its platform in order to keep up any conversation on a comment thread by turning the comments into posts. My parents never knew I owned it, so I just ended up using it in secret for years and interacting with the countless people and communities on that site and built and lost countless friendships and groups with me losing more after it shut down in 2019.

Now this isn't exactly a haunting experience for me personally, but I still can't wrap my mind around this and why it happened. I remember one night back in January of 2016 I was scrolling through the posts of an anime space I was in and I saw at least 30 different posts with the same user posting and captioning the same thing. A German Shepherd curled up on a bed and looking at the camera smiling. It was captioned with a link and a single phrase "what a cute dog picture!" and even the username was nice dog pic. I looked through his profile and he posted the same thing to maybe 20 different places and even tagging people with most accounts being like theirs, but at the same time there were plenty of normal looking accounts.

I decided to message him on Google Hangouts since you could message people from G+ using it asking why he was doing this at all since it made no sense to me. I knew trolls were a thing back then but none of the ones I knew went this far. 20 minutes later and I receive a few messages from the account mostly saying "hello" and "hi :D" so I just responded with hi back and asked him why he was spamming the dog picture everywhere. He texted me back 10 minutes later with "It's a cute dog, you should click the link and see more ;}". I honestly had no clue what that link was going to lead me to but I was never really taught that clicking random links can lead to some nasty things happening for you and your device. So, I clicked it and it took me to the safari browser and loaded up a website with the same dog picture only it had a caption that read "You got dogged! Share to ten more friends or random people or else I'll dog you again!". I was flabbergasted at what I had just experienced and honestly I had no idea how to react. It took me a few minutes to look at my phone only to see that I got 10 more messages from the guy. It was mostly him saying "LOLOL DOGGED I D OGGED YOU!" followed up by "Make sure to share this around, friend!" and then they blocked me. I looked on Google+ too and not only them but five other accounts had me blocked. Not knowing what to do I just turned off my phone, set it under my pillow, and drifted off to sleep.

I woke up around 11 A.M that morning and decided to check my phone for any missed texts or calls and I noticed something odd. After turning it on I noticed that the dog picture I had seen last night was set to be my wallpaper on my lock and home screen, and to make things more annoying my gallery was just filled with pictures of that damn dog. Literally just a normal German Shepherd, not cute or weird just average looking, staring at the camera and "smiling". I decided to just factory reset my phone after taking a second to figure out what to do and after doing so nothing was off or wrong with it. I managed to log back into my accounts and noticed that I had messages requests for maybe ten different people similar to the guy from last night. Most of it was just them asking if I liked the dog and wanted to see more of it or asking why I haven't shown it to other people, so I just ended up blocking all of the accounts and moving on with my day and doing other things like watch Youtube or play video games. I didn't really feel like being on Google+ that much after what I had just experienced overall and didn't really look at it until April of 2016. 

Over the span of a few months I forgot about the experience and I eventually started using Google+ and even made a new account, For awhile, I never experienced anything weird until September of 2016. I was talking to a friend on Hangouts when I noticed that I had two message requests from two users named "cuter dog photo 1" and ":cute deer photo". Now the deer in the deer guys pfp looked off. It looked like a normal deer but smiling? Deer can't really smile I think. It looked like an imitation smile where it's cheeks and the corners of it's mouth were forced to make the deer look like it was smiling or something like that. Nothing else, just a smiling deer. Now the dog guy didn't have the same dog but the same exact couch and set up. This time it was a Golden Retriever and both accounts were asking me if I liked the cute pictures and wanted to see more. I asked them both what they wanted and all they did was message a link ten times before blocking me. My still 14 year old brain though I would get answers and nope I didn't. They sent me to a website with both the new dog pic AND the deer pic up until the last two. Those two were odd. The last one for the deer guy was the deer in a living room (the same living room the dog pics were taken in) but it was standing on it's hind legs and it's front legs splayed apart to make it look like it was T-posing? That's the best way I can describe it. The dog picture was the same way but the dog looked more bloated than what it did in the first picture I saw of it. The coat wasn't nearly as shiny and the abdomen and even the muscles on it's hind limbs looked like they were gonna pop from either being too full or having to much straight. 

I ended up blocking both accounts and decided to not use google+ for the day day to catch up on some homework instead. That night another one of those accounts had requested to message me and instead of the usual hi, hello, or spamming me asking I had seen the dog or whatever it was it was someone named "WATCH ME DANCE" who had sent three videos and nothing else. I took screenshots and sent them to my friends asking what they thought it was and what I should do this I was starting to get a little scared. I ended up talking to a friend from school about this and he talked me into watching the videos with him. He even bought pizza and a few other snacks for us to munch on while we watched the videos. Now he could tell how uneasy it made me feel knowing we were gonna watch themsince I already told him about the deer pic guy, but he kept reassuruing me that there was nothing to worry about and that he was there for me incase it upset me or anything. When we got our snacks ready we decided to watch the videos and all I can say really is that they were really, really weird to the point it made me think it must be some elaborate joke I wasn't understanding and still don't. 

When we first started up the first video we saw the dog from the first dog picture I saw standing looking at the camera smiling. This continues for about 15 seconds until a hand is seen hitting the play button on a tape recorder saying "Hello, my name is Dimitri. I will now dance for you." My friend started laughing as low audible crunching is heard as the dog starts doing something like the hokey pokey only more slowly and it seems like its causing the dog quite a bit of distress. It went on for thirty seconds before the video ended, and my friends laughing kinda made me feel bad. I really felt this uncomfortable over a slightly weird and obviously edited video along with wasting his Friday night. I didn't even want to look at the second video since the first was so calm and tame so I thought I was paranoid over nothing. 

He pressured me into playing the next one and that was even weirder. It was the horse from the horse pic but it looked like a cheap, crudely worn suit made of it or the horse was in such a bad conidtion it just looked fake somehow. It's smile still looked forced and it's skin looked more like artificial leather or the leather you see on couches and jackets. It also looked like it's skin was sagging and it's rib cage was showing quite a bit. It was the same thing as the dog video but every now and then the video would cut to clip of it galloping in the field or neighing super close to the camera and snffing it. The clips I saw of it galloping just looked weird too since every time I used one of it's limbs to move it limped with that limb meaning it was just creating some weird struggling galloping motion to move around. The video lasted for around a minute and this point my friend could not stop laughing with how absurd this entire thing was. Tears were streaming down his face and his face was so red from laughter that I thought he was having trouble breathing. 

Once he's done laughing he tells me that this is just a troll and nothing past that. That all I was doing was feeding into some random person or groups game and that it would just stop if I stopped giving them attention. I kinda agreed but still wanted to watch the third video I had from the guy. My friend agreed and when it started it was the Golden Retriever from the last dog pic guy doing the same pose in the same living room with the same intro. This time the tape recording said "Hello, my name is Dimitri. Would you like to come dance?" followed by the dog struggling to do varioius dance moves because of howblated it was. It's belly extending and so full that it looked like it would burst at the next moment mixed with the crunching of bone and joints made me feel sick and I lost all appetite for the sancks we had. Then before the video ended the dog tried doing a backflip before failing mid air upside down and breaking it's neck. The camera pans around the living room to see both the deer and the orginal dog sitting on an opposite facing couch looking down at it. The bloated dog twitches before the video cuts off. My friend didn't laugh as much after this video and didn't find this one quite as funny. He just looked at me and my phone in disbelief before telling me to report it to the cops and Google+ and then block the guy. I blocked the person and reported them to Google+ and changed accounts again after I got a new phone two months later.

After that I never really thought about this until a few days ago while talking to an old friend I haven't spoken to in about six years, and we were talking about creepy things we found on Google+. Me personally I thought the cute animal picture thing would be big but apparently not. Neither he or any of my other G+ friends know what i was talking about. I've met one who claimed they knew what i was talking about but they said they blocked the accounts after figuring out they were probably hackers. Just wondering if anyone else had the same memories or answers? It for sure happened.
