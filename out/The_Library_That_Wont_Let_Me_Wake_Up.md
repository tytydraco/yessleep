I’ve had this one dream for as long as I can remember.

It’s always the same place – a library that stretches on forever in every direction. Stairs that can take you up at least several hundred stories (believe me, I tried). The floorboards creak like an old ship, and the air smells like saltwater. The light coming in from the windows makes it seem like it’s underwater.

People have told me that everyone has recurring dreams and that it’s nothing to be worried about. But I’ve never been able to *wake up* from mine. Not like I’m supposed to, at least. When I dream, I can’t pull myself out of it. The Library decides when I leave – sometimes, that’s after a few minutes. And sometimes, it feels like days.

I’ve tried to get help after some really long episodes. Psychologists, sleep specialists, even neurologists. But they all said that nothing’s wrong with me – I have no trauma or abnormalities that would disrupt my sleep. Just really, *really* vivid dreams. But that doesn’t explain how I’ve seen things in there that I couldn’t possibly know about.

There are nights where I’ll find a book that hasn’t been written yet. Sometimes I’ll open one and see real people – *real people*, as in standing, living and breathing *inside* the pages. And sometimes, I’ll see things that happen later. I once saw a storm roll across the Pacific, exactly as it happened a week later. Another time, I read about a facility flooding underground – and two days later, bam, it made the news.

But I’ve also read things that don’t show up on the news. Things that I hoped were only creations of my imagination. Whole books and shelves dedicated to monsters in the ocean. No, they weren’t fables or made-up stories, but detailed reports, pictures, events. Measurements, containment notes, names of people. One file described a creature the size of a mountain, sleeping under the Atlantic. Another talked about a colony of people who disappeared along the Argentinian coast after something came out of the water.

I used to think it was my subconscious making everything up – a vivid imagination as my psychologist used to say. But the names kept appearing, people kept disappearing, reports piled up. I’m not sure whether my mind could come up with the inexplicable things I’d read. Things I’d forgotten the moment I woke up, with only the feeling of remembering something.

For a while I wondered if what I’m seeing are actual memories – if the Library’s filled with every forgotten thing that ever happened. The more I dream, the more it feels like that place shouldn’t exist. *Does* it exist? I mean, in the physical world? Or am I the only one that can visit it, in my dreams?

And by “only one”, I mean me and this thing that I call the Guardian. The first time I saw it, I thought it was just another shelf extending to the never-ending top of the Library. A huge beast, always carrying a lantern that acts like a sun, always bringing light to the far aisles of the Library. Before the events of last night, it never once chased me, came close or hurt me. It didn’t even seem to notice me for a while – I was probably too small for it to even take me into consideration.

After that long monologue (sorry about that), it’s time to tell you what happened.

About two weeks ago, something changed in the Library. *Someone else* appeared.

At first, I thought it was just another one of those people I sometimes see moving inside the pages – just a flicker and fragment of someone there once *was*. But this one wasn’t inside a book. He was standing in the middle of an aisle, his clothes torn, soaked and trembling with his back turned to me.

“Who the hell are you?” I asked before I could stop myself. I would never – and I repeat, *never* – say anything like that to someone in real life, but I know I was safe inside the dream. I started to *enjoy* having these dreams where I could do anything, read about interesting things, learn. Although I never had a rational explanation for it all, I enjoyed being there.

So, those words escaped my mind before I could think it through. A dream character inside the library? The psychologist asked me whether I had any people with me, but apart from the Guardian, no one came to mind. And suddenly, he just shows up.

He slowly turned around and blinked at me like I’d startled him. “You can see me?”

“What kind of question is that? Of course I can see you.”

He looked around, dazed, like he just got to the Library. “Did you… just arrive?” He asked in a whisper.

“Arrive? I guess--”

“It’s different when you’re not here,” he interrupted. “It’s like I don’t… think. I don’t exist. But I *know* I do. But when you’re gone, I *stop* being.”

I looked at him quizzically, trying to keep my distance as he slowly approached.

“It’s dark. Quiet. Is this Heaven? Or Hell? Are you God? Or…”

I waved my hands to stop him from continuing. “Okay. That’s -- uh, that’s not creepy at all.”

He didn’t even seem to hear me. He pressed his palms against the nearest shelf, his eyes jumping from one book to another. “I remember water. I was with a woman… we were sent somewhere. We were trapped. My chest started collapsing, I couldn’t breathe, then--” he stopped, catching his breath. “Then nothing. Until now.”

I didn’t know what to say. I tried to gather my thoughts, but I didn’t have much time. His suddenly looked up, locking eyes with me. “You’re… you’re the Librarian.”

“What?” I bluntly asked, my voice commanding him to offer an explanation.

“That’s what they called you,” he said quickly, like he was afraid he’d forget. “The Order. They had files on you, on this place, on--”

“Stop,” I said, raising my hands. “I don’t know what you’re talking about. Honestly, *I* don’t even know what this place really is.”

He stared for a moment, and there was a hint of pity in his expression. “You don’t, huh?”

“Should I?” My voice cracked, and I could feel a sense of anxiety building up inside me.

He smiled faintly. “No. Maybe that’s why you’re still *you* and not *that*,” he said, pointing his finger behind me. I turned around, and saw the Guardian – this time, standing closer than it ever was, turned in our direction. I’m not sure whether it was looking at us, as its head was out of view, but I *knew* it was closer, and that frightened me. What if the appearance of the stranger will turn it hostile? What if the next time I come here, I will only find the remains of the stranger?

Before I could turn back, I blinked and woke up in a cold sweat.

And ever since then, he’s been in every one of my dreams.

Sometimes I can only stay for a few minutes before I wake up, but luckily, on the nights I spend literal days in the library, we talk all day long. He never remembers everything at once, because his thoughts come in waves. I’m not sure whether that’s the effect of the Library or the monster he escaped from.

He told me his name was Rennick. Just a few nights before, he was trapped, swallowed and dissolved by something called MOTHER. He said she could eat anything and *everything* you know about yourself – memories, faces, names – until there’s nothing left of you but a shell.

He proceeded to tell me about the Order. He called it the Thalassian Order, an organization that hunts – or *tries* to capture – things like MOTHER. He told me they’ve been trying to find me for years. Somewhere in their files, there’s my alias (The Librarian, which sounds a bit lame) under a category titled *Persons of Interest.*

Of course, at first I didn’t believe him – I hoped it was all made up by my mind. But he told me things I couldn’t have known – names of real people, real places and reports I found online that I had no recollection of seeing before. All of them *exactly* as he described them.

And the Guardian… it’s changed. As I said, it used to keep its distance, not even acknowledging me my entire life. But now that Rennick is here… not only is it getting closer, but it’s also stalking us. Searching for us, whenever we’re out of view.

Even when I’m not dreaming, I’ve started to notice things around me. The same van parked outside my building at night, but no one ever seems to get out of it. It leaves at 6 A.M. on the dot.

I keep telling myself that it’s paranoia – Rennick’s stories getting into my head. But what if isn’t? The Order might’ve finally found me and is now keeping tabs on me. Rennick said they’ll do anything – *“anything”,* he accentuated – to achieve what they want.

I’ve stopped sleeping regularly. I try to stay awake for as long as I can, drinking coffee, taking cold showers and going outside for a walk at 3 A.M. Of course, I knew this wouldn’t be sustainable.

And exactly three days ago, I gave in.

The moment I opened my eyes, I was already there – standing between the shelves, hearing a faint thump in the distance. I looked around, searching for Rennick but was unsuccessful.

I saw the Guardian in the not-so-far distance.

It was standing in the main aisle – somewhere I have never seen it before – its lantern swinging slowly in its massive hand. The shelves nearest to it looked warped (trick of the light, I suppose). But it wasn’t just wandering around anymore – it was actively *searching* for something. Or, as I quickly discovered, someone.

I saw movement between the aisles. It was Rennick, running like he hadn’t stopped for days. I noticed he was thinner, pale, and his face half-lit by the lantern. He looked my way and yelled something, but I couldn’t make it out. The Guardian turned.

The sound it made afterwards wasn’t something I can describe – maybe between a shriek and a roar. I heard books slamming on the ground around me, and I finally realized what Rennick was screaming.

“Wake up, Alice!”

I tried. God, I *really* did. But I couldn’t control it, I never could.

The Guardian’s lantern brightened, flooding the aisles with red light. Rennick ran toward me, ordering me to run and not turn back. I wanted to listen, but I was captivated by the movements of the Guardian.

The floorboards trembled with every step the monster took, and the shelves bent towards it – as if bowing.

“Run!” Rennick shouted one more time, and it finally got through to my brain. He grabbed my arm and pulled me into one of the side aisles just as a massive black hand tore through the wood, aiming directly for me.

“I can’t…” he tried to say, but couldn’t catch his breath. “I’ll explain… later…”

We continued running through corridors and aisles, jumping over piles of books – I thought I would remember the layout of the Library, but I just… couldn’t. It all changed. I was here every night for the past 21 years, and now? It’s like I’m in a completely different library.

Every time I looked back, I could see the giant beast following us, its lantern swinging with its movements.

After what felt like hours of running, we ducked behind a bigger pile of books, dripping with something that looked like ink. Rennick collapsed beside me, gasping for air.

“Okay… we may be safe for now,” I whispered, pressing my hand against my chest. I could feel my heart beating in every part of my body.

Rennick nodded and swallowed before speaking. “It got distracted. This happened a few times before you got here as well.”

“I thought you said everything *stops* when I’m not dreaming?”

“Not this time,” he continued. “Because you led them here.”

I blinked, confused by what he said. “Who? What are you talking about?”

“The Order,” he said, his voice filled with bitterness. “You didn’t mean to, but they found you. And every time you dream, every time you *read* something in here… it’s like you’re opening up a door. That’s why it’s angry.”

I stared at him, trying to make sense of it all but his eyes were fixed at something in the distance. “But you told me the Library decides when I wake up. Why wouldn’t it do it now?”

He snapped his eyes back at me. “It wants to *stop* you. Not just postpone your visit to the Library. *Completely* stop you.”

Before I could contemplate what he meant by “stop,” the shelves groaned around us. The light of the lantern returned, and we could hear that horrific shriek again.

“We have to move,” Rennick whispered.

But I didn’t. I just stood there, staring down at the floor with the flickering lights blurring my vision. “If I stay,” I said quietly, “Maybe it’ll stop. It’ll close itself off again.”

Rennick frowned. “What are you talking about?”

“If I’m the one who *opened* the door, maybe it’ll shut if I… if I don’t wake up again.”

He shook his head so fast it almost looked violent. “No, that’s not how it works.”

“You said they found me,” I insisted, my voice trembling with fear. “They’re using me to get here. If I die here, then maybe the Order loses its key. Maybe that thing--” I pointed towards the aisle where the Guardian was approaching from, “--wouldn't have to protect this place anymore.”

Rennick stepped closer, grabbing my shoulders with his cold hands. “Alice, listen to me. They’ve already been inside. Your useless self-sacrifice won’t stop them. Whatever connection they used to find this place, they’ll just replicate it – believe me, I worked for them.”

“Then how do I stop it?”

He hesitated. “I don’t know. But not like this.” He looked back over his shoulder, searching for the Guardian. “You can still wake up and try to figure something out,” he said. “I doubt the Library will keep you here for much longer. It’s all too chaotic. If you stay much longer, it’ll tear this entire place apart trying to reach you.”

I wanted to argue and demand an answer that makes sense – but the bookshelf next to us splintered apart. A massive shadow fell over the aisle. I didn’t dare look up, but I was sure that his face would be visible from this distance.

Rennick grabbed my wrist again, pulling me towards a staircase I’d never seen before. It led down – a spiral that seemed to go forever, vanishing into black. “Don’t ask. Just go!” he shouted.

“But where--”

“I’m not sure, but it’s better than here,” he interrupted.

I saw the Guardian’s hand move toward us with immense speed, and I had to make a split-second decision. Stay or go?

Rennick pushed me down the stairs before I could weigh the options.

“Wake up!” I heard him shout as I fell. “You need to *wake up!*”

Everything trembled around me as a bright light consumed everything.

And then--

Silence.

When I opened my eyes, I was back in my apartment.

The room was dark except for the glow of streetlights penetrating the windows. My muscles ached and my throat was dry. I reached for my phone and was partially blinded by its brightness.

14 hours.

I’d been asleep for fourteen hours straight.

For the first few minutes I couldn’t move. My hands were shaking and I was afraid that I could fall back into the Library any moment.

But the worst part wasn’t the fact that I’d slept that long. It was that, for the first time in 21 years, I *didn’t want to go back*.

The entire thought of that place filled me with dread. Every time I closed my eyes I could see the Guardian’s lantern swinging around.

I poured coffee until my hands hurt. I opened every window and kept all my lights on.

I’ve been awake for thirty-seven hours now. I can see things, hear noises, my walls are breathing – but that’s probably just exhaustion.

I looked it up: a human being can only live for eleven days without sleep. Eleven. *At most.* I keep repeating that number in my head. Repeating it keeps me awake. I can’t risk drifting off.

My body is already giving up. My eyes sting and my vision splits in half when I try to focus. I’ve started pinching my arm and biting my cheek to stay awake. I’m doing *anything I can* to prevent myself from falling asleep.

If I dream again, I’ll be back there. Back in the Library. And if Rennick was right, I don’t want to go back there. Not now, when things are still so unstable. I can’t let the Order catch me. Not here, in the real world, and not there, in the Library.

I’m not sure what I could do to stay awake for much longer. I want help. Please, someone. Anyone. Help me. I don’t care who, I don’t care what advice, just *please.* I *can’t* fall back asleep.
