I was told to reach out on this platform by my own intuitions and seeing through past experiences by others on this thread. So what the hell. 

My name is Emily and I’m writing this to battle my own paranoia and just to get tips on general in this situation, I figured this could be a place to get some answers to my problem. 

I currently attend a university I won’t say here but just know that for the sake of this story: during the week I go to my classes Monday through Friday and I go home on the weekend to spend time with my parents. My apartment I reside in, the building of which is right next to the university, is two stories with the front doors of each apartment immediately leading to outside, with no interior section of the building to speak of. 

I love my apartment, it’s really small but I’m never the type of person to shy away from making a place fit my interests and hobbies to a T. I was also always a cautious person, with my key ring also holding pepper spray, and the countless horror podcasts and horror movies I watch never helping. Living in an apartment alone however, was always worth it to just live in a world of my own. I write in my spare time but I’m mostly into crocheting whenever I had free time. It’s just something I never really seem to put down, and once I started a project I couldn’t seem to stop. Other than the noisy neighbors I have, I never complain. I can heard everything they say but it’s not their fault, the walls in between the apartments are paper thin. Even when they sit on their couches that share the same wall with my own, I can hear the back of the couch hit it with a “knock” sound. Annoying but tolerable.

The reason I’m even writing this to begin with started about 2 weeks ago from today, Monday. My shift was over at work and my only class for the day got moved over to Zoom. I was excited with this change in schedule because it gave me a good amount of time to get some cleaning done around my apartment and gave me some time to crochet. Once I was done cleaning, I sat down on my couch at around 7:00 pm, the sun not shining through my window in my living room any more. 

“Knock”. 

Looked like my neighbor was done for the day too. 

The next day, same routine. I am never the type of college kid to go out to parties and drink, but I had no issue with that, my parents always said, “as long as I’m happy with what I’m doing.”. Well that night I got too into what I was doing, taking very little breaks to look away from the crochet projects that I was working on, leaving to straining my eyes a lot. Around the time of 8:00 pm, something felt off. I felt creeped out, like I was being watched. I didn’t look up from my crochet, I couldn’t let them know I sensed them. 

“Knock”. 

Good my neighbor was home in case anything went wrong. 

Wednesday, same shit, different day. But this time, I had my later 6-9 class at night. I didn’t mind it, “History of Film”, never boring to me. I got back to my apartment and felt too tired to crochet for the night so I just went straight to bed. 

“Knock”. 

I’m going to fast forward to next Monday. The knocking from my neighbors came in two’s all of the sudden. 

“Knock knock”. 

I thought maybe he sat down then put his feet up, that made sense, sure. But that night when I was crocheting, it got weird. So the layout of my apartment from the point of view on my couch was that to my right, there was a corner, blocking me from seeing my bedroom door and bathroom but leaving me to still see my kitchen just enough. And to my left was just my window, front door and TV right in front of me. 

“Knock knock”. 

That feeling of being watched again. I got up and walked over to my window and pulled down the blinds to look to my right where my front door would be. Nothing. I also looked through the blinds and down at the parking lot below. My neighbor’s car, usually parked right next mine, wasn’t there. 

“Knock knock”

I walked over to the doors peephole to make sure someone was there knocking at my door, this was at 10:00 pm so it would have been weird if someone was knocking at that hour, especially since I didn’t personally know anyone that would. 

“Knock knock”. 

Nothing. 

“Knock knock”. 

My heart sank. I turned around with my blood running cold. I stared towards the end of my apartment at my bedroom door, wide open. And in the frame, appearing just so, was an eye staring back at me with their knuckle hitting the lower part of the door.

“Knock knock”.

There was no time to think. Luckily my phone was in my pocket and my keys were on the table right next to the door. When I bolted outside of my apartment and sprinted to my car, I didn’t hear any steps behind me. The wood from outside our doors on the second floor always makes noisy sounds with the planks making hollow sounds, but this time, nothing. 

I called the police then my mom and dad. The drive back home was silent. I usually always drove with music on to fill the silences of a 30 minute drive but not this time. I cried to my parents when I got home. I was tired and just wanted to hear what the police had to say about the person in my apartment. We always tried to be careful with me living alone to the best of our abilities and how that would affect me emotionally and mentally, but some things like this, there’s just no justifications. 

The next day the news came. The cops didn’t find anything in my apartment and they questioned my neighbors, most importantly, the one right behind my couch. He just got back to his apartment from a month-long vacation that morning. I couldn’t think after the cop delivered that news to me at my parents’ house. To be honest, it was all just a blur the more and more I thought about what it meant. 

I missed a lot of classes after that. I felt awful for my parents having to drive me back and forth for an hour all together every day. 30 minutes there, 30 minutes back. There was just so many days I never had the energy to focus to even go to any of my classes or even work. 

I didn’t want to go back to my apartment. My parents understood, and we all agreed the situation was exhausting on all of us. My parents paid half the rent towards my apartment, so of course they were upset about this whole thing for that fact as well, and rightfully so. 

Moving forward to now. My parents went out to dinner tonight with friends and left me to dog sit our two dogs for the night. The house has a better security system than my pepper spray with a locking sliding glass door and alarm that goes off whenever a door opens somewhere that’s not the garage door. It’s also spring break this whole week and at the end of break, I think I’m almost ready to go back to my apartment and we’ll obviously do a deep search when I come back. Which is why I’m here, if you guys any tips on what I should do when I get back please let me know at the bottom of this post. 

He’s at the screen door.
