I never saw his face. Not once. That fact alone haunts me more than anything else. His voice was always calm. Measured. Almost polite, which made it worse somehow. He never raised it. Never cursed. Just quiet instructions and the scent of bleach.

I remember the day he took me with unnerving clarity, like a scene scratched into the back of my eyes. It was raining hard. I’d just left the coffee shop near campus, umbrella forgotten at the counter. I remember fumbling with my phone to order a ride, then a gloved hand over my mouth. The sensation of cold metal pressing against my temple. My scream drowned in my throat.

When I woke up, I was lying on a thin mattress inside a windowless room painted entirely blue. Floor to ceiling. Blue walls, blue ceiling, blue sheets. A single light bulb buzzed above me. The air smelled stale and chemical, like old paint and something sour underneath. I was still in my jeans and hoodie, but my shoes were gone.

There was a door with no handle on the inside. A small camera in the corner blinked a red light at me. He watched. I knew it immediately. I stared at that lens for hours, waiting for something to happen. When I tried to scream, the sound felt swallowed by the blue around me.

The first time he spoke, it came through a speaker hidden somewhere in the ceiling.

You will not be harmed if you follow the rules.

His voice was neither old nor young. Just… blank. Like he’d stripped it of personality on purpose. I asked him who he was, what he wanted. I begged. Cursed. Promised him anything if he’d let me go. Silence. Then the voice again.

Rule one. Do not tamper with the door. Rule two. You will eat when the light turns green. Rule three. You will sleep when the light turns red.

The light never turned off entirely. Just changed color. When it glowed green, a tray slid through a narrow opening near the floor. Usually oatmeal, sometimes something that looked like meatloaf. It didn’t matter. I ate it. Hunger won every time.

The days blurred together. I lost track of time. There was no clock, no natural light. I started naming the cracks in the ceiling. Whispering stories to myself to remember the sound of my own voice.

But always, always, I watched that camera. Waiting.

The first time I broke the rules, I did it out of desperation. I waited until the light turned red and pretended to sleep. Then I pried at the edges of the tray slot with a piece of bent plastic from the food container. The slot was spring-loaded, and the metal cut my fingers. Still, I kept at it.

I don’t know how long passed before I felt the change in the air. Like a presence had filled the room. Then the voice returned, quiet but firm.

You have broken a rule.

Before I could react, the light turned white—blinding white. Pain shot through my head. I screamed, covering my face, but the light only grew brighter. My skin felt like it was burning. I curled into a ball and sobbed until it finally dimmed and turned red again.

You will not be warned again.

I didn’t touch the slot after that. Not for weeks.

But something shifted in me that day. He wanted obedience. He wanted routine. That was his mistake. If I could predict him, I could break him. So I watched. Every gesture, every meal, every color change. I memorized the timing. I counted seconds between the tray sliding in and the camera lens shifting focus. I noticed it turned off for three seconds each time he delivered food.

Three seconds. Not much. But just enough.

The next time the light turned green, I was ready.

I took the plastic fork from the tray and wedged it under the edge of the camera. My hands trembled as I worked fast, biting my lip so hard I tasted blood. I managed to snap the lens just before the red light blinked back on. I dropped the fork and backed into the corner, heart racing so hard I thought I’d pass out.

No voice. No punishment. Just silence.

The camera stayed dark.

The next day, no food came. No voice. No light change. Just endless, crushing blue.

That was the worst day of my life. Not because of hunger or fear, but because I realized he was punishing me by taking himself away. I’d begun to expect him, depend on his rhythm. Without it, I unraveled. He knew that. He wanted me to miss him.

I screamed then. I pounded on the door, clawed at the walls, sobbed until my throat bled. I begged him to come back. To talk. To do something.

That night, the light turned green. The tray returned. And the voice said,

Good.

He had broken me. But in breaking, I saw the cracks.

I changed after that. I pretended better. I followed the rules. Ate when I was told. Slept on command. I became obedient, quiet, predictable. I gave him what he wanted—until the day he made his first mistake.

It was small. Stupid, even. A noise behind the wall. Like a cough. It was human, and it didn’t belong.

I pressed my ear to the wall. Nothing. Then again, softer this time. A shuffle. A breath. Someone else was there.

I tapped on the wall, slow and rhythmic. Three knocks. Waited. Then it came back.

Three knocks.

I wasn’t alone.

Every day, we tapped. We developed a code. A crude alphabet based on numbers and taps. It took days, maybe weeks, but we began to talk. Her name was Lisa. She’d been there longer. Much longer. She warned me he liked games. Psychological ones. That he changed rooms. That no one stayed in the Blue Room forever.

That scared me more than anything.

The night the light turned red and didn’t change for hours, I knew something was coming. I didn’t sleep. I crouched near the tray slot with the bent fork hidden in my sleeve. My heart pounded so loud it drowned out everything.

Then I heard it.

The door. Clicking open.

He was coming in.

I lay still, pretending to sleep, barely breathing. I heard footsteps, slow and deliberate. A faint rustle. He was doing something with the camera. Replacing it. I could smell his cologne. Sharp and synthetic.

Then, without warning, I leapt.

I jammed the fork into the back of his thigh. He screamed—a real, raw scream—and I scrambled through his legs, bolting for the open door. He grabbed my ankle, but I kicked hard, adrenaline turning me into something wild and primal.

I ran down a narrow hallway lit by flickering bulbs. Doors lined each side, all painted different colors. Blue. Green. Yellow. Red. I passed them all. I heard him stumbling behind me, shouting now. Angry. The calm voice was gone. This was the real him.

I reached a metal staircase and flew up it, taking two steps at a time. My lungs burned. My bare feet slapped the stairs so hard they bled.

At the top—another door. This one had a keypad.

I froze.

Then I remembered Lisa’s taps. The numbers she gave me over the last few days. A date. Her son’s birthday.

One. Nine. Zero. Five.

The light turned green.

The door creaked open to a blinding light. Cold air rushed in, and I saw stars. Real stars, in a real sky. I ran into the night, into the dark forest beyond.

I didn’t stop.

Eventually, a trucker found me on the road, half-conscious and covered in dirt and blood. I told them everything. The police searched for weeks. They found the house. Empty. The rooms repainted. The cameras gone. No trace of him. No Lisa.

Just one thing left behind.

A single blue wall. And a message carved into it with something sharp.

You followed the rules.
You were fun.

I never saw his face. I never want to. But I know he’s still out there.

Watching.

Waiting.

Choosing his next color.
