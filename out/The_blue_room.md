Hello everyone, I am writing this to ask for help with something related to a dream I had a few nights ago that has left me deeply confused and somewhat disturbed. If anyone has any information about what it might mean, I would greatly appreciate it if you could share it with me.

Two nights ago, I had a nightmare. I was floating in a black void, not physically, but… just my mind, I don’t quite know how to explain it. In that black, mental void, I was navigating through a series of memories from my life—happy moments, sad ones, some that were exciting, etc. But, as if it were a roulette wheel that lands on a random prize, the memory of my daycare from when I was little came to me, and it began to materialize before me, as dreams often do. As the space formed around me, I started to feel my body; I was standing there in my daycare, but not as a child, instead, as a 20-year-old. There were children playing, running, and shouting all around me, and I was like a ghost wandering through it. I remembered every corner, many details, even some of the faces of the children.

My daycare was a single-story building. It was an enclosed space, but even though I was there with the body and height of an adult, it felt huge to me, as if I were still seeing it from the perspective I had when I was 3 years old. I felt a lot of nostalgia and joy being there, and I also started to remember small moments with my classmates. For a moment, I even felt that innocence and carefree spirit of early childhood again. But, this is a dream, and sometimes we think about things, and things happen just because they do. When I recalled that my daycare, to this day, was nothing more than an abandoned building in ruins… everything fell apart.

The scene around me changed completely. The children disappeared. The white walls, which used to be painted with clouds, a big yellow sun, rainbows, and images of Mickey Mouse and Donald, were now bare, gray, and dusty. The ceiling was a horrible dark green. I knew it wasn’t night, but it was an enclosed place, and everything was wrapped in shadows.

Shit... Look, my daycare had a peculiar layout; from the main entrance, you could practically see the whole place: A) the first play area, B) a long hallway with classrooms on both sides, C) at the end of the hallway, the second play area (even bigger than the first), and D) a room at the very end, "the back of the daycare," so to speak. Basically, the structure seemed designed so that the back of the daycare could be seen from the main entrance, passing through the hallway and the two play areas.

I was frozen in the first play area, near the entrance, facing the end of the hallway, toward that damn room at the back. I started to remember, that room was some sort of laundry area, a rustic cement laundry room, I think they also kept cleaning supplies there. A few times they had taken us there to teach us how to brush our teeth. I knew how to do it, but there were even younger kids than me who didn’t know how to brush their teeth yet. That room was kind of narrow and had light blue walls. The light in the room was weak and dim, so being there gave the sensation of being underwater. Remembering the shape of the room made me tremble and gave me chills.

I remained frozen, staring down at the end of the daycare, when suddenly, without making a single sound, the room began to move toward me slowly. I’m not just talking about the door—the entire room at the back of the daycare started to come closer, passing through the play area and down the hallway.

I felt panic and a horror that I couldn’t remember ever having felt before in my life, and all of that was multiplied a hundredfold when the room started talking to me. I repeat, in dreams, you just know things for no reason. That voice was heard inside my head, but I knew it was the voice of that room, which was getting closer and closer. "Enter the fishbowl, little fish, the eel will protect you," the voice said, once, then repeated it in a series of echoes.

I started to feel like my head was soaked with what I thought was a torrent of sweat from my panic and terror, but then I realized it was water. "The eel caught you, little fish. Swim, swim far away from here and don’t come back," the voice said. I felt a deep pain when it said that phrase, as if my heart was being taken and shoved into a ball of needles. The room was now just a few meters away from me, and I saw the door swing open abruptly. At that moment, I woke up screaming and drenched in sweat.

I cried for a long time, rocking back and forth in my bed, not even sure why, but still feeling the horror, the panic, the pain… everything was so intense that I couldn’t help but cry until my head started throbbing with pain and my eyes grew tired. A part of me wished my parents had heard my scream and my cries and would come in to comfort me, but my pride told me that I was an adult now and I had to face it alone. It was 4:17 AM, and I knew that trying to fall back asleep wasn’t an option, so I took my phone and tried to distract myself and calm down.

Look, I’ve had nightmares before, like anyone else, but they never really affected me much. I even remember that when I was 10, I suffered from night terrors. At most, they would wake me up with a scream, but after a while, I was able to fall back asleep. My parents told me I was always a very brave kid, but that it was best to take me to a specialist, who ended up putting me on medication, which helped a lot with the nightmares, and they gradually decreased... But none of that compares to this. This was, by far, the worst thing I’ve ever experienced in a dream.

I know I dreamed about the room again yesterday, but I don’t remember it well, as if my brain said "Nope, none of that, block activated," and it terrifies me to think about what I might have seen this time if my brain hadn’t protected me.

I’ve thought about telling my parents because there’s something about all this that worries me. It’s not normal for a nightmare to make you react so violently… Right? Well, I’ve heard about dreams that can reveal things from our past or relive traumatic moments... No, I’m becoming paranoid. I just hope I can sleep well tonight. If something new comes up, I’ll make an update.
