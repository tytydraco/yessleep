Everything feels foreign, it all feels smaller somehow, like the town shrunk in my absence. My hands tremble slightly on the steering wheel as I debated my next move. Melissa ‚Äì no, Missy ‚Äì was waiting, but the thought of seeing her again after all this time made my stomach twist into knots. The well could wait. It had waited this long.

I find myself driving aimlessly through the old neighborhood, each turn unleashing a flood of memories. The public library appeared around the corner, its brick facade weathered but unchanged. God, how many summer days had we wasted away in there? The four of us sprawled across those worn carpet squares, trading cards and dreaming up adventures. The memory hit me like a physical blow ‚Äì John's ridiculous laugh echoing through the stacks, Larry's serious face as he considered each trade, Missy's eyes lighting up when she found a book she loved. The ache in my chest was unlike anything else, a peculiar kind of pain that comes from touching something precious that's been lost forever. It's the kind of hurt that makes you want to curl up and disappear, but somehow keeps you coming back for more.

It‚Äôs raining, soft and steady. I‚Äôm going to smoke a cigarette and head on my way toward Missy's house. Funny, on my way here, in the distance, I saw my old house, and I thought about Dad, probably withering away just like Grandpa had in those final days. Sometimes I wonder if everything that happened all those years was just some collective nightmare ‚Äì if John and Larry simply vanished in the normal way people do, if Missy and I had just gotten caught up in something our minds couldn't process. But deep down, I know better.

I just pulled up to Missy's house, I need to focus. I can‚Äôt help but notice the garden her mom had always kept so pristine was overgrown now, roses fighting for space with weeds. Even the porch light seems dimmer, as if the house itself was tired. I'll update you after I talk to Missy. 

Words can‚Äôt describe what just happened but hell, I‚Äôll try my best. My heart was pounding so hard I could barely hear myself knock. When Missy's mom opened the door, the years hit me all at once. Her face had new lines, deep grooves carved by worry and grief. Recognition flickered in her eyes, followed by something darker. "Matthew?" Her voice was rough, like she didn't use it much anymore. "You've grown up. What do you want?"

"Missy called me, she wanted to see me."

The bitter smell of whiskey reached me just before her harsh laugh did. "This some kind of sick joke?"

"What do you mean?"

Her eyes drifted past me, focusing on something I couldn't see. "Missy's been gone a year now. Left a note about finding John..." Her voice cracked like thin ice. "Just like when you all found Larry."

‚ÄúI‚Äôm- Mrs. S, I‚Äôm sorry‚Äù

‚ÄúFuck you!‚Äù

What happened next was brutal in its rawness. She lunged at me, fists connecting with my chest, each blow punctuated by broken words. "Why? Why did you take her out there? Why did you-" She collapsed against me, grief pouring out in waves. I held her as she sobbed, this woman who had once been like a second mother to me, now reduced to fragments by the same darkness that had taken everything else. When she finally pulled away and disappeared inside, the slam of the door echoed through the empty street like a gunshot.

I‚Äôve been in my car for hours, alternating between screaming until my throat was raw and sitting in complete silence. My mind kept circling back to what I now think was our last conversation, about a year ago. Here‚Äôs the logs:

Missy: Hey stranger üôÇ Been thinking about you

Me: Missy! Long time no talk. How've you been?

Missy: Okay I guess. Been thinking about what happened all those years ago a lot lately

Me: Yeah... I get that. I'm so sorry about everything. I never meant for any of it to happen

Missy: I know. Sometimes I wonder though... isn't it weird? We got Larry back but lost John. Like some cosmic trade-off

Me: Try not to think about it that way. What happened to Larry after... he wasn't the same

Missy: What if we could fix it though? What if there was a way...

I dismissed her idea and the rest of the conversation faded into small talk and awkward attempts to bridge the gap that had grown between us. If I'd known it was the last time we'd speak, I would've said so much more. I would've told her that she was still the first person I thought of when something good happened, that I missed her laugh, that I'd never really stopped loving her. But that's the cruel joke of life, isn't it? We never know when our last chance is slipping through our fingers.

I came back thinking I could save her, convince her to leave this cursed place behind. But she was already gone, pulled back to the well by the same dark gravity that had claimed Larry and John. I should've known better ‚Äì Missy always had that streak of determination that bordered on stubbornness. Once she set her mind to something, there was no talking her out of it.

The writing feels pointless now. You'll all probably read it and dismiss it as fiction, as just another story to scroll past. That's why I won't name the town or give you directions to the well. Don't try to prove me wrong or right. Just know that somewhere, a small town somewhere has too many secrets to keep buried. 

I‚Äôm going to drive to my father's house. I pulled up and everything felt crooked, misaligned I guess? The empty house sits still before me, too quiet for comfort.

I‚Äôve been looking everywhere for that old bastard. He couldn't have gone far ‚Äì he could barely walk last I heard. I‚Äôm going to look around the property. Okay, I have no clue where he is, how we could‚Äôve gotten out of the house, but I know he‚Äôs gone, I found this in the barn:

"To whoever finds this, likely Matthew,

I've failed in ways I can never fully explain. The burden of knowledge and silence has become too heavy to bear. There are things about this town, about our family's role here, that I swore never to reveal. The well was meant to be your inheritance in a way, yours and Larry's, when you came of age. We changed the rules after that incident years ago ‚Äì  I think you know the one.

We serve something ancient, something that has no name. We call it The Room, though that's just our feeble attempt to contain something that can‚Äôt be described or put into words. After Larry's return, I knew. What came back wasn't him, not really. I was torn between protecting my children and honoring centuries of tradition.

The choice should have been simple, but nothing about this has ever been simple. Even if I had tried to end it, to disband the congregation, others would have stepped in. Some secrets demand to be kept.

Remember this, son: It wants you. You cannot fight what exists beyond death. Either run, run far and never look back, or accept your place in what we've protected all these years."

I know what I have to do, I‚Äôve been running in circles for my entire life, I have little left. The walk to the well felt different this time ‚Äì shorter, clearer, funny how children‚Äôs minds can distort things, right? I reached the clearing, it‚Äôs just an empty space, a void in the fabric of reality. The well had been filled in, buried like so many other secrets in this town.

I know there are other ways in. Other doors to whatever lies beneath this place. The rain has stopped, leaving behind a silence that feels like a held breath. Like the whole town is waiting to see what I'll do next.

I drove into town searching for the chapel, my last thread of hope unraveling when I found a quaint mom and pop shop where it used to stand. The sight of it felt wrong, like someone had painted over a crime scene. I've been poring over my old writings for hours now, desperate for any clue I might have missed. Something keeps nagging at me about Mrs. Shank's warning. It wasn't just the usual adult cautioning about dangerous woods. The way her voice shook, how her eyes wouldn't meet ours - she was terrified of even speaking about it. Like mentioning it might make it real somehow.

The library stood silent in the growing dusk. All the windows dark, reflecting my own desperate face back at me. 

I made a decision I can't take back, I broke into a library. The familiar smell of old books hit me as I climbed through, my flashlight beam dancing across walls. Finally, I collapsed in our old corner, memories washing over me - comic books scattered across the floor, trading cards, wild plans for adventures we'd never live to see. Now it's just me, alone with the dust and silence.

I‚Äôve been poking around for a bit and something caught my eye, the floor. The whole library has been renovated with hardwood, except this one corner, oddly enough the corner we use to hide in. They'd left the carpet here, probably for the kids' reading area. But something about it made my skin crawl. I pulled it back. Another hatch, just like the chapel's, its metal ring set so perfectly flush with the wood that no one would ever notice it unless they knew exactly what to look for.

The moment I touched it, every cell in my body screamed at me to run. To forget this madness and leave while I still could. But I can't. I owe them that much. As I stare down into that absolute darkness, reality feels thin, like tissue paper about to tear. I don't feel solid anymore, more like I'm dissolving at the edges, is that part of that primal fear I get all that time ago? This is for Larry, John, and Missy. I'm going in, I probably won‚Äôt make it out, I pray I can still get these logs posted and reveal the truth of whatever‚Äôs been haunting this town, my life. I might not write anything for a little bit, so don‚Äôt get confused if it sort of jumps around. 

I've been walking for... hours? Days? I honestly don‚Äôt know at this point, the tunnels have been twisting and branching endlessly, each turn looking exactly like the last. My flashlight beam seems weaker now than when I first entered. I thought I recognized where the bone pile was, but I think it's been filled in, smoothed over like it never existed. Just like the well, just like this entire fucking mystery. The cavern where I first saw The Room should be here somewhere, but everything's different. The walls feel alive, shifting when I'm not looking directly at them. I have no food, no water, and the silence is so complete I can hear my own heartbeat echoing off the stone.

My phone's screen is shattered, the time‚Äôs been frozen for god knows how long. I wonder how much time has passed. The isolation has been wearing me down faster than the hunger. Being alone has always been one of my deepest fears. Now the solitude is becoming a physical presence, something with weight and texture that wraps around me like a shroud. I catch myself talking to the shadows, just to hear a human voice. Any voice.

The tunnels keep going deeper. I swear they're changing behind me, sealing off my retreat. With my feet blistered, my shoes have filled with blood so I took them off, the further I walk the more they just become raw masses of torn flesh, every step an exercise in agony. The rocks beneath feel sharp, almost eager to slice into my skin. Sometimes I think I hear whispers, just at the edge of comprehension. Other times, I'm certain something is following me, always staying just beyond my light's reach. The darkness feels hungry.

The hunger has become a living thing in my gut, twisting and gnawing. I've started having conversations with Larry, Missy, and John in my head. Sometimes they answer. Sometimes they sit there and look at me disappointed. Sometimes they scream at me to run as fast as I can. I found a narrow tunnel to rest in, barely wide enough for my emaciated body. 

I had a passing thought, maybe this whole place is one massive organism, The Room, and it‚Äôs just slowly digesting me.

Dad's words have been echoing in my head, something he told me my mother used to say. "Life is like a tidal wave son, you either roll with the punches or fight it. Rolling with punches is usually easier right? I think so too, but sometimes when you love something, you fight with it and give it all you got.‚Äù Ironic coming from him.

I dragged myself out of that suffocating tunnel into another cavern, but this one's different. The air feels thick, almost liquid. My blood leaves perfect circles on the ground, too perfect, like the floor is drinking it in. The tunnels must stretch for hundreds of miles by now, a vast web beneath the country. What if this thing, whatever it is, has always been here? What if our cities, our whole civilization, is just built on top of its feeding grounds?

I can barely stand anymore. My bones feel hollow, ready to shatter at the slightest pressure. The skin on my feet hangs in strips, leaving crimson footprints that seem to glow in the dying flashlight beam. When I collapse, the ground feels warm, almost welcoming.

I can hear something. A whisper. Not from any direction I can point to, it seems to come from everywhere and nowhere, from inside my own thoughts.

"Pledge yourself, Matthew." The voice is like wet stones grinding together, like the sound decay would make if it could speak.

My own voice came out as a rasp, barely human. "Go to hell."

"I am not what you think." The darkness seems to pulse with each word.

"You took them from me!" Even my anger sounded weak, distant.

Silence answered me as I propped myself against the wall. The cavern... changed. Not suddenly, but like a dream shifting. The walls didn‚Äôt just move or simply shift - they unmade themselves, reality peeling back layer by layer. What emerges wasn‚Äôt the horror I remember, not the thing with too many legs, not my mother's twisted form. It's... wrong in a deeper way. Like looking at the space between stars given form, a shape that hurts to comprehend. Its edges bleed into forever, containing depths that couldn't exist in our universe. Looking at it feels like falling upward into an endless night.

"What... what are you?" My words felt small, meaningless.

I was met with silence. 

"Are you... divine? Infernal?"

Something I could only assume to be amusement rippled through the void of its form. "Your species dreams such small dreams. I am so much more ancient."

I searched for an escape, knowing there isn't one. "Why all of this? Why us?"

It shifted in ways that shouldn't be possible, its form suggesting geometries that have no place in our reality. The response, when it came, felt like ice forming in my brain. "You still ask the wrong questions."

"Then what do you want?!" Desperation made my voice crack. "Just end this!"

"End?" The concept seemed to amuse it. "Nothing ends. Nothing begins. All is cycle."

"I don't understand." I could feel tears streaming down my face but I ignored it. 

"You have faced the void. Walked alone through endless dark. Conquered it." Its form ripples like heat waves over asphalt. "Choose. Die here, empty and forgotten. Or pledge yourself. Join them in The Room."

"What are you talking about?"

"YOU KNOW!" The force of its response makes reality shudder, and for a moment I saw through the walls of the tunnel, through the space and time itself, into spaces that human minds were never meant to comprehend. "You have always known. Since the first time you looked down into the well and the well looked back."

I gave some thought to what I would do next, not like I had much to think it over, this is the part where you may think I made the wrong decision, go ahead and judge me, scrutinize me for taking part in what I‚Äôve been trying to protect you all from. But when a person has no other options you‚Äôd be surprised at the things they do to have any sort of semblance of control, security. I weakly moved my feeble body, my knees coming down to the floor, and raised my head down. Just as Missy explained in the drawing she saw at the mental hospital.

"I, Matthew [redacted], pledge myself to The Room. Show it to me."

"One more thing."

I snapped my head up, rage boiling beneath my skin. "What now?"

"To enter The Room, you must face your deepest fear‚Äîit's the gateway, so to speak." The voice seemed to echo from everywhere and nowhere. "Some who come here are bound by faith, terrified to walk through divine light. Others are paralyzed by the depths, forced to swim through crushing darkness until their lungs scream for mercy. Each seeker finds their own personal hell."

I swallowed hard, but before I could respond, the cavern transformed. The change wasn't gradual‚Äîone moment I was standing in cool darkness, the next I was surrounded by an inferno that seemed to breathe. Flames licked the stone walls, casting writhing shadows that danced like tortured souls. The heat hit me like a physical force, searing my exposed skin, forcing sweat to evaporate before it could even form.

That's when I saw it.

The creature before me bore only a passing resemblance to a goat, the way a corpse resembles the person it once was. Its fur was matted with something dark and wet, its eyes like molten brass coins sunk deep into its skull. The horns spiraled impossibly, seeming to bend in directions that hurt my mind to look at.

"What do you want?" My voice cracked, betraying the primal terror clawing at my insides.

"Go ahead, Matt." The words didn't come from its mouth‚Äîthey resonated inside my skull. "Don't you want to see your loved ones? Climb. In. To. The. Room." Each word was punctuated by a wet, meaty sound.

Then it began.

The transformation started with a single crack‚Äîlike a gunshot in the burning air. The creature's jaw began to split, but not cleanly. The skin stretched and tore, revealing layers of muscle and sinew that continued to expand, the flesh bubbling and reforming.

The sound was worst of all. It wasn't just the cracking of bones or the wet slithering of flesh‚Äîit was the thing's breathing, a rhythmic wheeze that sounded disturbingly like my name being whispered by a dozen voices I almost recognized.

When it finished its grotesque metamorphosis, the maw before me was large enough to swallow a car. The inside wasn't simply darkness‚Äîit was an absence, a void that seemed to pull at my very soul. The air around it rippled like heat waves, but it felt ice-cold against my blistered skin.

I took one last breath of scorching air and stepped in.

The jaws snapped shut with the finality of a coffin lid, and that's when the real horror began. It didn't simply bite down‚Äîit savored me. I felt each tooth pierce my flesh individually, like precise surgical instruments wielded by a sadistic doctor. My legs shattered not all at once, but bone by bone, joint by joint. I could feel each splinter, each fragment as it tore through muscle and skin.

My mind tried to shut down, to protect me from the overwhelming agony, but something wouldn't let it. Something forced me to stay conscious, to experience every excruciating second. When its back teeth finally reached my torso, they didn't crush‚Äîthey worked slowly, methodically, like a butcher taking apart a carcass. I felt my ribs crack one by one, felt my organs shift and rupture. My spine twisted into impossible angles, vertebrae popping like bubble wrap filled with blood.

The pain transcended physical sensation, becoming something almost metaphysical. I wasn't just being eaten‚ÄîI was being unmade, my very essence being pulled apart and reconstructed into something else.

Then, like a radio being switched off, everything stopped.

I found myself in a white room‚Äîno, The Room. Through the sterile brightness, I could make out three figures in the distance: Missy, Larry, and John. They were waving, beckoning me forward, their faces bearing those familiar smiles I'd missed so desperately.

I'm writing this now, though I'm not sure how, or where these words will go. Am I alive? Dead? Something in between? The tears on my face feel real enough, but then again, so did the pain of being devoured. The figures are still waving, still smiling, still waiting.

I'm going to walk toward them now. I have to know. But let me leave you with this warning: if you ever find a well in the woods, if you ever hear sounds that shouldn't exist echoing from its depths, run. Run until your lungs burn and your legs give out, then run some more. Never, ever go searching for The Room.

Because The Room is always searching for you.
