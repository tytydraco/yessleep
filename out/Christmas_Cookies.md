It was a cold winter night at my older cousin’s place when he told me that there was no such thing as Santa Claus. I was telling him about my Christmas list for Santa while he listened unamused and played PlayStation. He just said it so flatly, as if it were obvious. I of course couldn’t believe him.

“My parents wouldn’t lie to me. How else would you explain the presents?” I thought.

That’s when I hatched a plan to prove my cousin wrong. I would put Santa to the test and stay up late to catch him in the act.

The snow was still coming down in a flurry on Christmas Eve night. I waited until my parents had both gone to bed and the house seemed dead quiet. I crept through the dark house illuminated only by the colorful Christmas lights glowing from the pine wood Christmas tree. Even our golden retriever Fido was resting in his doggy bed by the tree near the empty fireplace with my red Christmas stocking hanging above. Outside the window was a desolate wasteland of snow.

All seemed silent and calm with no sign of Santa.

I ducked behind the couch to hide from Saint Nick as I fixed my eyes firmly on the chimney and waited patiently. I wasn’t used to being up past my bedtime, so I admit, I got a little sleepy but held my eyes open and jolted back awake each time I began to nod off.

Suddenly, I heard a horrible sound that grabbed my attention. The loud noise I heard was something violently making its way down the chimney. Next, I heard a terrible inhuman shriek. I watched on with curious anticipation from behind the couch.

What emerged from the fireplace was not Saint Nick. Perhaps just the opposite.

The dark form crawled from the stone mantel and stood to its feet. It was about 7 feet tall, a dark and looming figure. I saw it faintly at first by the light of the Christmas tree. I had no idea what it was or what it wanted. When the creature turned I saw its face. It had large glowing circular white eyes and a wide mouth of mangled teeth jutting out in every direction.

I was shaking and cowering in fear as I watched the unknown thing stalk around my home.

The tall and unnerving beast looked like some sort of freakish cross between an angler fish and a human shape. The skin, from what I could see, somewhat resembled the scaly body of a reptile like that of a dark snake, lizard, or alligator. Its haunting white eyes projected a glow of light wherever it faced. In some regards, it looked to be a specter as it hunched over and walked lurking throughout the house.

Finally, it made its way to the plate of cookies we left out for Santa on the table. It snatched them up and dumped them into its massive jaws, eating them all in one bite, before pouring the glass of milk down its throat as well.

Then the gruesome creature’s eyes darted around the room looking for something else before ultimately landing on Fido asleep by the tree. The disturbing beast stared at Fido hungrily before making its way over to the poor defenseless hound.

The creature lifted Fido up above it and emitted a dreadful spine-chilling shriek as it opened its mouth, slowly unhinged its jaw, and began to consume the dog as he fought and whimpered. Its massive jaws clamped down and started chewing until the dog’s noises ceased and it had swallowed the whole carcass with blood dripping from its large teeth.

At this point, I was in tears as I hid behind the couch traumatized by what I had just seen and in fear for my life that this monstrous thing would find my hiding spot and that I would be next. In its eyes, there was an unmistakable intelligence and a true dark malevolence I can’t quite explain or describe.

The shadowy abomination was silent for a moment, as it scanned its eyes across the room. Then with another loud ear-piercing shriek, it crawled back inside the chimney and made its way upwards. After a few moments, I could hear that it was gone.

Soon after, I ran back into my room and locked the door. I waited up until Christmas morning and didn’t leave my room again.

When my parents called for me, there were now presents all around the tree. My mom and dad were sitting there happily, not knowing what horrors I had witnessed last night. At one point my mother sheepishly asked me “You didn’t eat the cookies that were made for Santa Claus did you?”

After I denied that it was me, they asked if I’d seen Fido because they couldn’t find him. They never did find out what happened to him and eventually came to assume that Fido ran away that Christmas Eve. Only I knew what really occurred and I learned one lesson; on Christmas Eve, don’t wait up for Santa.

Of course, children grow up and their belief in Santa fades, but despite years of second-guessing myself, I could never shake the reality of the creature I saw. I’ve questioned if perhaps I had actually fallen asleep that night and just had a horrible vivid nightmare or if I instead had some sort of mental health episode. However, it wouldn’t explain where my childhood pet had gone or what happened to the Christmas cookies that even my parents noticed were eaten.

“If what I witnessed was truly real and physical, then why didn’t its shrieks wake Mom and Dad?” I’ve long wondered.

My advice for children on the night of Christmas Eve is this; keep your pets in a safe place and stay locked inside your room. Be asleep if you can be. No matter what happens or what you hear, don't go to check, because what you find just might be something else, something monstrous that certainly isn’t Santa Claus.
