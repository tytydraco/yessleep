I want to start this by giving a quick layout of my house. It's all one floor, three bedrooms two baths. The front door opens into the first living room and to the right is a small hallway that holds the guest bathroom as well as two bedrooms. One of them is mine. To the left is my parents' bedroom and the second living room right beside it. Across from that living room is the kitchen and the laundry room. 

We've been living here for quite some time now and I've really come to like it. It's tucked away in a small neighborhood that's filled with some nice people. Across the park is Miss Beatrice, a sweet old lady that I've passed a couple times on some walks. Just across the street is this couple, Natalie and Adam. Natalie is a nice woman, waves at us sometimes when she leaves for work. Adam is… a character. We've had a few cop cars come along because of him, an ambulance once or twice. Neighbors can't all be perfect. 

But this isn't really about the inhabitants of my neighborhood, no this is about something that I've been seeing every morning after I wake up. 

I think the first time I saw it was two weeks ago; I had just woken up and like always I had to take a piss. After using the light of my phone to find my glasses, I got up and made my way to the bathroom that was conveniently placed right beside my room.  

The hallway walls had these little light sensors that my dad placed because he knocked into the cat one too many times. I could see them turn on every now and then whenever I was getting ready for bed since our cat, who's called Hades by the way, likes to roam around the house when we're asleep. 

The lights flickered on once I stepped out of the bedroom, guiding me to the open bathroom door just a few steps away. The house was quiet aside from my mother's snores that echoed from their open bedroom door. They always kept it open for Hades since the litter box was in their bathroom, so like always I didn't give it much notice. I just went into the bathroom and did my business. 

I walked out after a few minutes only to stop in the doorway. I felt like I was being watched. Turning on the flashlight from my phone, I shined it into the living room just to see Hades perched on the carpet and staring into my soul. 

"Hades!" I chuckled, lowering the light so it wasn't shining directly in his face. "You little bastard, it's six in the morning. Dad'll be up in like twenty minutes to feed you." 

He didn't really like that answer, giving a loud meow in return before running off and around the corner to the kitchen. I rolled my eyes while watching him go, giving my parents room a glance before turning to head back to my bedroom. 

But I stopped. 

I had seen… *something.* 

It had only been a quick glance, but I swore I had seen something resembling a face before I had turned around. It was white, not purely but almost like old porcelain. It was right in the doorway of my parents' room, and I swore I could feel its eyes staring right into my back. I didn't know what to do, I just walked into my bedroom and shut the door because honestly, what the fuck could I do? 



After that it had been at least two days since I'd seen it, and I was thinking about it every minute. What could it have been? A spirit maybe? It wouldn't have been my first time seeing one of those, maybe the third of fourth time. A little gift I had picked up from my dad's side of the family. 

But even if it was, I had never seen a spirit like *that* before. Usually, they were pure black and almost shadowy, this one was white and seemed solid. Like it was a *real* person. 

I didn't tell my parents. They wouldn't have believed me anyway; they never do anymore. They would just humor me, act like they believed every word I would say until I eventually stopped bringing it up. And if I didn't? Well, they'd simply ignore me. Rinse and repeat. 

On the fifth day I saw something again. It was at the other end of the living room just like last time. It was still white, still standing. But it looked different now. More like a dog, those ones with the really long snout, except this one was more elongated. I could only see the front half since the other end was around the corner in the kitchen. Its nose drooped heavily and hovered just above the ground. I could see it twitching like it was sniffing at the hardwood in front of the recliner. 

It looked at me. 

I looked back. 

I saw it move one paw forward and immediately bolted back into my room, making sure to lock the door behind me. I didn't even risk going to the bathroom, I just stood in the middle of the room and held it in until I could hear my parents moving around the house for their usual morning routine. The worse part wasn't even that it made the move to get closer. 

It was that it already was. 



A week had passed before I brought up the courage to go to the bathroom early in the morning. Luckily, I didn't see that weird creature when I went out into the hallway, so I just went right in and sat myself down on the toilet. I must've been in there for not even three minutes when I suddenly heard Hades' meowing on the other end of the door. 

"Yes, I know you're there, Hades. I'll be out in a few minutes." I got another loud meow in response followed by his claws scraping lightly against the door. He would do this every couple of days when he wanted extra attention, and I didn't really mind it. I would just respond every couple of seconds to settle him down or make a 'pspsps' sound which he really liked. 

There was a slight gap underneath the door due to the elevated piece of wood in the doorway. It was a weird transitional piece to cut off the flooring between the inner parts of the house and every separate room. Hades liked to stick his paws or even his nose through the gap in an attempt to really draw me out. Just normal cat things. 

He meowed one more time, a little high pitched and drawn out which I knew meant that he was getting tired of waiting. "You're so impatient." I laughed, swiping at the mobile game on my phone as I listened to the familiar pat of his feet to indicate that he was walking away. Impatient indeed. 

I stood back up after maybe ten minutes, knocking the lid of the toilet down before flushing it then reaching for the sinks handle to wash my hands. But I stopped, because right before I could wrap my hand around the glass I heard a meow. 

But it wasn't Hades. 

It was deeper and more drawn out, like someone was mocking the way his voice sounded. But it wasn't mocking; It was imitating. Whatever was outside the bathroom meowed a second time, then a third. Each time it meowed it seemed to grow higher in pitch and shorter in length, almost like it was trying to perfect the way Hades sounded every morning when begging for food. 

Then came the scratching. The sniffing. 

It was trying to get through the gap. 

I hoisted myself onto the sink and pressed my back against the mirror as the sounds become louder. The doorknob twisted over and over in a desperate rattle; long claws came from underneath the door to leave scratch marks on the inside. The sound made me want to vomit, bouncing off the walls of my mind like a disgusting fly trying to find its way out. 

The meowing continued, loud and deep until it was practically screeching for me to come out. I covered my ears in an attempt to drown out the sound, but it was almost like a siren's song, getting lodged in my brain like a nasty tumor. 

Then suddenly, it stopped. At first, I thought that I'd gone deaf and honestly, I welcomed the idea. Anything was better than having to listen to that monster try to get into the one place I felt safe in that moment. But no, it retracted from the door completely. 

For about ten seconds. 

A claw began to scratch at the door as a long white snout with light gray whiskers pushed in from the gap, rising almost a foot in the air. The end twitched and I was forced to watch and listen as it sniffed around the room; bumping into the tub, the walls, the flooring. Like it was searching for something. For me. 

I tried to stay as quiet as possible, even as my eyes began to water and my legs began to cramp. I watched as it rose to full height, gave the room one big sniff, and then turn towards me. 

It found me. 

"Mama!" I shouted, body shaking like a leaf as I began to hit my fist against the wall to make as much noise as I could. I screamed, I sobbed, I didn't stop until it retreated to the hallway and out of sight. But even with it gone I didn't stop making noise, not until my mom ran across the house and began banging on the door to try and get in. 



I told her everything, I told them both. From the first time I saw it to the traumatizing encounter in the bathroom. 

"It was only a nightmare, baby... it wasn't real." My mother had repeated that phrase at least a dozen times in an attempt to calm me down but I knew better. I'd had plenty of nightmares over the years, I know when my mind is playing tricks on me. This? This was real. 

It's like I said, they didn't believe me. I was all on my own to deal with this… thing. I don't really know what to call it at this point. At first, I thought it was a spirit, but now it feels more like a demon.  

It's ten pm right now and I'm lying in bed with one of our kitchen knives tucked under my pillow. I really don't want to stay in this house anymore but if I'm going to be forced to, I'm at least going to have some kind of protection against that beast if it tries to come at me again. 

I'm having trouble sleeping, obviously. I put on a random TV show just so I'm not laying in complete darkness or silence. But even with the TV on I can hear every little sound coming from the rest of the world. The whirring of the heat turning on and off, the gentle patters of rain hitting the roof, the occasional blare of a train in the distance. One sound cut through it all. 

Footsteps. 

They were low, heavy. A slow process that traveled from the living room on the other end of the house to the hallway on the other side. 

The sensor flickered on. I can see shadows outside my door and hear Hades soft meow come up from the other side. 

But Hades is in my bed, curled up at my feet.
