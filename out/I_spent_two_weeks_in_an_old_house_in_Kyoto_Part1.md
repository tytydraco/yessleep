I’ve always lived in a quiet town in Portugal. Life was predictable—wake up, go to work, come home, eat, sleep. I never had many friends, and my days often felt like they blurred together. That all changed when my cousin, Beatriz (21), called me one evening with an idea.

"Hey!," she said with her voice full of excitement. "We both have a few weeks away from work. How about coming to Japan with me? Just for two weeks! We could go to Kyoto, see some temples, eat amazing food…"

I hesitated immediately. A city so big and so different from my tiny town felt overwhelming. Beatriz didn’t pressure me, though. She sent me links, photos of temples, streets, and the rustic house she had found. I spent **several days weighing the idea**, thinking about the cost, the travel, and leaving my comfort zone. In the end, something inside me stirred. I’ve always loved Japanese culture, the history, the art, the stories… and this felt like a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

"Okay," I finally said, my voice barely above a whisper. "Let’s do it!"

We started looking for hotels, but the prices were higher than we expected. I wasn’t ready to spend half my savings on just a bed for two nights. Beatriz, however, seemed unconcerned. She suggested we try something more adventurous—a small, old house on the outskirts of Kyoto, a little away from the city center.

When we arrived, a narrow path led us away from the busier streets. Small wooden signs pointed us toward the house. The air smelled faintly of pine and damp earth. I could see the roof from a distance, dark and slightly weathered, with smoke rising faintly from a chimney.

At the doorway, an elderly man appeared. He didn’t speak at first, only observed us silently as we approached. His eyes were sharp, almost piercing, and he studied our luggage and the way we carried ourselves.

Finally, he spoke, his voice low and deliberate. "You will be staying here?"

"Yes," Beatriz replied quickly. "It looks… very beautiful."

He gave a small nod and stepped aside, gesturing for us to enter. There was no formal greeting, no exaggerated politeness. He simply started showing us the rooms, opening doors slowly and pointing out features, as if letting the house speak for itself.

Inside, I was struck by how much it felt like stepping into another time. The floors were covered in tatami mats. Sliding doors divided the rooms, and low beds sat neatly in their corners. Decorations and ornaments were everywhere: delicate wooden carvings, small statues, and paintings of landscapes I could only vaguely recognize. It felt as if the house had been untouched for decades, like a samurai’s home frozen in time.

Then I noticed the symbols. Talismans hung from beams, walls, even on some of the furniture. Most were written in kanji, but some characters looked unfamiliar, almost archaic.

The old man guided us from room to room until he stopped in front of a particular door. On it were two signs, one in English and one in Japanese:

**"Do Not Enter!" / 「入るな！」**

He looked at us seriously. "This room is strictly forbidden. Do not enter under any circumstances. I am not responsible for what may happen if you do."

I swallowed hard. My pulse quickened. I wanted to ask why, but Beatriz, sensing my unease, gave me a reassuring smile.

Before leaving, he added casually, almost as if talking to himself, "It’s normal to hear noises at night. Just the wind… or animals. Nothing to worry about. Stay in your rooms."

He handed us the keys, muttered something in Japanese I couldn’t understand, and left.

We unpacked slowly. Every so often, I found myself glancing at the forbidden door. Each time, a shiver ran down my spine. Beatriz, however, seemed completely at ease, humming quietly as she organized her belongings.

Around late afternoon, Beatriz suggested we explore the nearby area and grab something to eat. The “store” was more like a tiny shop tucked into a narrow alley, with dim yellow lights and narrow aisles packed with food and household items. The smell of fried snacks mingled with the faint aroma of incense from a neighboring temple.

A middle-aged woman stood behind the counter, watching us carefully.

"Irasshaimase…" she said automatically, her eyes flicking between us and the shelves.

"Good evening!" Beatriz said, smiling brightly. "Are you open?"

The woman nodded slowly. "Hai… open. Tourists?"

"Yes, we’re from Portugal!" Beatriz said. "We’re here for two weeks."

She simply nodded and pointed down the aisles. "Choose quickly. We close early."

We wandered the cramped aisles, picking up instant noodles, fresh vegetables, rice, and a small fried chicken. The shop smelled of warmth and home, but something about the quiet, watchful woman made the air feel heavier.

At the counter, she suddenly leaned forward and asked softly, almost whispering, "You… stayed in that house?"

I glanced at Beatriz, feeling a wave of nervousness.  
"Yes," I said carefully. "It’s… very beautiful, very traditional."

She lowered her gaze and muttered, "Don’t open doors you shouldn’t!"

Beatriz chuckled nervously. "We’ll be careful," she said, though I could tell even she felt a little unsettled.

Back at the house, we cooked our simple meal and tried to relax. The wooden floorboards creaked as we moved around, and every little sound seemed amplified in the quiet house.

Later, we video-called our family.

"So, how was the trip?" my dad asked.  
"Everything went well!" Beatriz said, laughing. "The house is incredible, it feels like we’ve stepped back in time!"

My mom frowned. "Back in time? But isn’t it modern?"

"Not exactly…" I explained. "It’s old, decorated with symbols and talismans. Different from what we’re used to."

"Just… be careful, okay?" my mom said. "You know I worry."

"Don’t worry, auntie!" Beatriz said with a smile. "We’ll be fine."

After the call, I tried to sleep, but it was impossible. Every creak of the wooden floor, every distant rustle of the papers on the walls kept me awake. My mind kept returning to the old man’s warning and the forbidden door. I tossed and turned for what felt like hours, exhaustion tugging at me but sleep refusing to come.

Eventually, I must have drifted into a light, restless sleep.

I woke suddenly, my heart leaping into my throat. A sharp, metallic clanging echoed through the house. Not footsteps… not wind. My mind immediately flashed back to the old man’s warning. It couldn’t be the wind this time.

Shaking, I grabbed the small flashlight from my luggage. The beam cut through the darkness as I moved cautiously toward the source of the noise. The sounds grew louder, accompanied by a strange wind that made the papers with symbols flutter as if alive.

And then I saw it. The noise came from the forbidden room. Faint lights flickered through the cracks, almost like dancing flames, and a soft female voice whispered, barely audible, like a lullaby.

Every instinct screamed to run, but I couldn’t stop myself. Frozen with fear, I stepped closer to the door.

I reached out my hand…

And at that moment, I felt **another hand on my shoulder, coming from behind me**…
