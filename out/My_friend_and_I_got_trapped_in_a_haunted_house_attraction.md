   This happened last October about a week from Halloween. My friend invited me to go to a local haunted house run by a theatre company in our town. It was set up in a warehouse just outside of town and it ran every year for the month of October. We went in the evening and waited in the line of people at the doors. They only allowed one group at a time into the attraction but they had cool props and some of the actors scaring people while they waited in line. I’d been to a few haunted houses like this before and knew what to expect for the most part. Flashing lights, gory scenes, guys in masks jumping out of corners and stock screams played over loud speakers. I was really only interested in the props and set ups they might have since I liked horror films and things like that. 



   So we get to the doors and the guy tells us to wait a minute before we go in. He goes over the rules; no touching the actors or props, no flash photography, no alcohol or drugs, no weapons, etc. He gets the go ahead from his radio to send us in and we entered a dark room with a black light and fake spider webs on the walls. We both hesitated before going through the doors, goading each others to go first. I ended up going in and the first thing I noticed was how quiet it was inside. No music, no screams, no spooky atmosphere. I was actually impressed at first. They managed to surprise me right off the bat. The second thing I noticed was how dark it was. There was barely enough light to see a few feet in front of me and I had to move slowly to keep from running into anything. So far, this was going better than I expected. The walls were made of plywood and painted black, creating a maze through the open space of the warehouse. I was tense, expecting an actor to jump out at any moment, but one never did. My friend commented on how weird it was there were no lights, not even blacklights, and how dead silent the place was. We didn’t hear any sounds not even distant ones. I was starting to get a bit unnerved by it and pulled out my phone to use as a light. 



   That was when I noticed there were no props or decorations anywhere. We found some heavy concrete statues of gargoyles and angels but they were just sitting by themselves with nothing else around. We even found some of the props we’d seen outside piled up in a corner. My friend complained about how boring this was but I could tell he was just as disturbed by this as I was. The whole place looked like it was abandoned years ago. What kind of haunted house was this? I began to hurry through the maze of plywood walls until I found a gap that led out of the attraction behind the scenes. What we found was an empty warehouse with props wrapped in cellophane and chairs stacked up in rows. I called out to anyone but only heard my own voice echoing back. My friend was starting to panic. He ran back into the maze of walls and I hurried behind him until he reached the doors we’d come in by, only to find them locked. They weren't just locked, they were chained shut. I opened them just enough to look outside and saw it was day time. The line of people were gone and the booth the man had been sitting in was empty. Outside was an empty parking lot with nothing around for miles.



We went into full panic mode after this; kicking at the door, trying to find any other way out. The inside of the warehouse was getting hotter and the feeling of being trapped was overwhelming. After a few hours of screaming and banging on the doors we sat down against the plywood walls and just stared at each other. We didn’t know what to do. We were way outside of town in a warehouse that was only ever used once a year with no way of getting out. My friend pulled out his phone and was going to call his family when he froze, staring at the screen in shock. I asked him what was wrong and he turned the phone around to show me the lock screen. The time was 2:38 pm, which was odd because we’d gotten there at sundown. Then I noticed what he’d been shocked by. The date was May 23rd. It was October 24th when we came to this place. I remember because it was the day before my brother’s fall recital. This couldn’t be right. I looked at my phone and it said the same thing. May 23rd. We both stared at each other, unable to process what was happening. I called my parents and when they picked up, they couldn’t believe it was me. I could hear my Mom crying, asking where I’d been and what had happened to me. When I told them where I was they said they’d come out with the police to get me and my friend out. How had this happened? How had we lost 7 months of time? My friend’s family thought he’d run away with a girl. I had to get my job back and explain to my manager why I disappeared. I don’t know what happened to me. Where did that time go?
