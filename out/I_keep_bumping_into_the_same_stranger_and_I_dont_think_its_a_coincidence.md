People say the world is a small place, out of the many people on this planet, sometimes it feels like we keep bumping into the same ones. It happened to me sometimes, you meet a guy in middle school and after a couple of years you happen to find yourself sitting at the same diner, but this time it's different.

One day, as I was walking in a park near my neighborhood, I decided to sit on a bench, It's something of a morning ritual, I just sit down and experience the silence.
I usually go there in the morning before work, where nobody's around and there are just me and my thoughts, but that morning I wasn't alone. 

As I stood up from the bench, I realized someone was at my side. Naturally, as I didn't even heard him approaching me, I was shocked by his presence and I jumped back squealing. As I regained my composure I took a good look at him.

He was a lengthy, pale, wrinkly old man, probably in his early 70s, he wore a black raincoat and a black fedora, his eyes were covered by these small round glasses and his hand, covered by a pair of black leather gloves, held tightly onto a metal briefcase resting on his knees. 
He looked straight ahead, bearing a disgusted frown on his aged face. I wanted to apologize to him, but something about that man sent shiver down my spine. 

He looked, way too out of place, it was almost uncanny, it felt like he was devoid of all color, as if he came out of an old black and white movie, and his proportions were just slightly off putting. I'm not sure how to properly explain it, but it was as if his skin was slightly stretch upwards.

After the immediate scare I just ran as fast as I could and later that day I tried to brush it off as just some weirdo creeping people out, but the day after, things started to get weird.

The day after I went at a bar with a couple of friends after work, and sitting at a couple of table away from me, was the stranger. 

Naturally I felt a bit threatened and hid among my friends, but he didn't seem to have notice me, he just silently drank his coffee and reading a newspaper. I explained the situation to my friends and they assured me it was just a coincidence, so, once again I ignored the strange coincidence, but now I don't think I can ignore it any longer. 

Now I see him at least once a day wherever I go, at the hospital, at the office, at the airport, it doesn't matter where I am, somehow we always find each other.

Every time he acts indifferent, as if he doesn't even know that I'm there. I tried talking to him, but he simply ignores me, always parading that stoic, disgusted frown looking towards nothing as if he despises the world itself. 

I don't know what to do, I wanted to report the whole thing to the police, but I don't think it'll go anywhere, the guy barely even acknowledge me, it's almost as if I'm the one stalking him. If anyone has any idea of how to get rid of this "thing" or if you had similar experiences, please share them with me, I am out of options at this point, I can't turn a corner without thinking he might be there waiting for me. 

I only feel safe on my own when I'm at home, but is it gonna ast?
