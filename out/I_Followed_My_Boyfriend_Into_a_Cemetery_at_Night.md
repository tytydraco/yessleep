We weren’t supposed to be there.

That wasn’t part of the thrill for Evan. He just liked doing things he wasn’t supposed to do, especially when no one was around to tell him to stop. The cemetery was quiet, old, and fenced off after dark, which made it perfect in his eyes.

I followed him over the fence because I always did.

The gravel paths crunched under our shoes as we walked between the stones. Evan kicked a pebble ahead of him, laughing softly, like we were somewhere harmless. I kept my flashlight low, more focused on where I was stepping than on what surrounded us.

“Relax,” he said. “It’s just a bunch of rocks.”

I didn’t answer. I already regretted coming.

The air felt different farther in. Not colder, exactly—just heavier. The trees lining the cemetery pressed closer together, their branches tangling overhead. The wind moved through them in uneven bursts, stirring leaves and loose debris along the ground.

That was when I first heard it.

At first, it sounded like the wind catching in the stones. A thin, breathy sound that faded in and out. I ignored it. Cemeteries have a way of amplifying normal noises until they feel like something else.

But as we walked, it kept coming back.

Not loud. Not clear. Just close enough that I found myself listening for it.

“What?” Evan asked, when he noticed me slowing.

“Nothing,” I said. And I meant it. I didn’t have anything solid to point to.

We reached a section where the graves thinned, opening into a wider stretch of ground. At the far end stood a mausoleum—larger than the others, its stone pale and worn. The door wasn’t fully closed. Just slightly ajar.

Evan grinned when he saw it.

“Now that’s interesting.”

He walked up to it without hesitation, shining his light along the surface. I stayed back, telling myself it was just nerves. Just my imagination working overtime.

Up close, it was plain. No statues. No carvings worth mentioning. Just a family name etched above the doorway, the letters worn shallow with age.

Evan leaned toward the gap in the door, angling his flashlight inside.

“Doesn’t look like much,” he said.

I was about to agree when something caught my eye.

For a split second, I saw movement at the edge of the opening. Pale against the dark. Fingers curled over the stone.

A hand.

It twitched once, then slid back into the darkness.

I sucked in a breath. “Evan.”

He turned. “What?”

The doorway was empty again. Just shadow. Just stone.

“I—” I stopped. The words felt stupid the moment they reached my mouth. “Nothing. Never mind.”

He laughed it off. “You’re freaking yourself out.”

Maybe I was.

We moved on, but not far. The paths twisted and looped in ways that made it hard to tell where we were. More than once, I glanced back and saw the mausoleum again, closer than I expected.

“I thought we’d gone farther,” I said.

“All these rows look the same,” Evan replied. “You’re fine.”

Eventually, he drifted back toward it without saying it outright. When he stopped in front of the doorway again, something in my chest tightened.

“I’m just gonna take a quick look,” he said. “Two seconds.”

“Don’t,” I said.

He was already slipping inside.

The sound of him scraping against the stone vanished the moment he crossed the threshold.

“Evan?” I called.

No answer.

I waited. Called his name again. Louder.

Nothing.

The cemetery continued like nothing was wrong. Wind in the trees. Leaves shifting. Normal night sounds that should have been comforting.

They weren’t.

I stood there longer than I meant to, telling myself he was messing with me. That he’d pop out any second.

Then the wind shifted, brushing against my back instead of my face, carrying the dry, stale smell of old stone.

I stepped away from the doorway without realizing why.

That was when the whispers came back.

Not clear. Not loud. Just fragments, drifting around me instead of from any one place.

I called Evan’s name again.

The whispers stopped.

The silence that followed felt intentional.

I turned.

Evan was standing behind me.

Close enough that I startled.

“There you are,” I said, relief hitting me hard. “What the hell was that?”

“I’m here,” he said.

His voice sounded normal. Flat, maybe, but normal enough that I tried to calm down. I laughed shakily, already preparing to apologize for overreacting.

Then I really looked at him.

His jacket was dusty along one sleeve. His eyes were open a little wider than usual. He didn’t blink.

“Did you hear me calling you?” I asked.

He hesitated. “Yeah.”

“You didn’t answer.”

“I was farther in than I thought.”

Something about the way he said it made my stomach drop.

“You should come see,” he added. “It explains things.”

“No,” I said. “I want to leave.”

He stepped closer.

“You’re making this harder than it needs to be.”

I backed up. He adjusted with me, keeping the distance between us the same. His hand brushed my sleeve—cold, too firm.

I pulled away.

His grip closed around my wrist.

“You’re taking too long,” he said.

That was it.

I twisted free and ran.

I didn’t know where I was going. The cemetery blurred around me, stones flashing past in uneven rows. I didn’t hear footsteps behind me.

That was worse than being chased.

I stopped in a clearing where the graves stood farther apart. That’s where I saw them.

Figures between the stones. Too tall. Too narrow. Watching.

And near the mausoleum—

Evan.

Standing upright.

Too still.

My light rose.

Hands that weren’t his held him from behind, fingers sunk deep into his torso to keep him upright. His chest was open, ribs spread, empty inside. His throat was ruined. His eyes were open and dead.

The thing behind him lifted Evan’s arm.

And waved.

I ran.

I didn’t stop until the fence tore my hands and the streetlights burned my eyes.

No one followed me.

They let me leave.

  
I still don’t know why.
