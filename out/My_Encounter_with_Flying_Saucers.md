I have a good amount of stories that I could post here since I’ve had a few strange and weird experiences throughout my life despite only being 19 years old. But I don’t think I’ll ever forget this experience despite even convincing myself that this was me possibly having a fever or a realistic dream.. even if the experience felt very, very real. Truthfully I don’t fully believe that this had really happened but I could be wrong, that’s up to you to decide. This is a short story though.

When I was 7-8 years old, I lived in a small house (that got shot up not even a full week after we moved out) with my mom and my step father and step sister at the time. I had an irrationally strong fear of the dark and since my step father was quite cruel towards me, they liked to keep me paranoid and took away my opportunity to sleep easily by taking away my TV.. which was the only thing that helped me sleep. My mom agreed since she wanted me to get pasted my fear of the dark but I digress. 

One night, I remember being extra paranoid and scared so I slept in my sister’s room since she had a convenient bunk bed that I could sleep in sometimes. I slept on the top bunk that night and tried sleeping but alas, I was too paranoid even then. It was the middle of the night, if I had to guess what the time was then I’d say it was probably around 1 AM on a school night. I tried distracting myself most of the time until I passed out when I was younger so I tried the same thing that night. I remember seeing a strange light illuminate from the blinds and I immediately took interest.. I thought it was a car at that moment but I was scared of it being a possible stranger trying to stalk up.. since my step sister was in the room, I managed to pull myself together enough to peak through the blinds and see.. not a stranger, and definitely not a car. But a strange, flying saucer that fly nearby my house and above the house across the street. I remembered my eyes widening as I looked around more and saw.. another saucer not too far away from it, slowing floating to the right of my house and in the corner of my eye.. I remember seeing some large hover right above my house. I looked up completely and saw this mammoth of a saucer float over and above my house completely. I couldn’t even see it once it moved more but I remember it having almost a stereotypical light on the bottom of the ship but a strange darker color to the whole thing. One of the smaller ships followed with it and I remember being too scared to run to my moms house in fear that it would be aware of my presence or possibly make the ship provoked into taking me and my family away so they wouldn’t be discovered. 

So I slowly and hesitantly moved towards the living room to look outside the window to see if it was still around since it floated in said direction and.. it was gone. But our trash can outside had fell over and the sound of distant barking echo’s through the night. I didn’t know what to say or how to feel once it was over. I couldn’t tell even then if I had hallucinated that or if I was dreaming but, I was definitely left speechless at that moment, and I knew that if I told my mother that, she’d just laugh and say “Oh it was just your imagination”. I hadn’t told anybody this story before until now since I can’t sleep and it’s.. 6:30 AM. Despite how real it felt at that moment and how clearly I remember it, I still can’t bring myself to fully believe that happened because of its slight stereotypical look.. but remembering that event so clearly despite barely thinking about it for a few years has left me.. scratching my head again since if that was a dream, how come I didn’t remember any other dreams from when I was a kid? This really is up to Reddit and the people reading this story to guess with this really happened or not.
