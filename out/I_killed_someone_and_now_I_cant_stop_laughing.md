I’m not sure where else to turn so here it goes.

I'm hoping someone on here has experience with uncontrollable laughing because this is torture. My body aches. My head’s pounding from dehydration, my throat’s so raw it started bleeding, and I’ve cracked several ribs. I called 911 but they think it’s a prank. 

It started 5 days ago. 

My partner, Kate, and I pulled up to our last liquor store of the day before our shift ended. We work in Alcohol Beverage Control, and while it’s technically a law enforcement job and we carry weapons, I had never once in 12 years discharged my gun outside of a range. Until 5 days ago. 

It should have been a run-of-the-mill license check to make sure the store wasn’t selling anything they weren’t legally allowed to sell. I sensed something was off immediately, the Mexican lunch special I’d eaten a few hours earlier felt like it was staging a revolt in my stomach. 

We heard shouting as soon as we stepped out of the vehicle. 

“Should I call it in?” Kate asked. 

I shook my head, wanting to gauge the situation first. Fights are common enough in liquor stores, but it took a moment to figure out what was off about this one. 

Only one person was shouting. The other person was laughing. 

The sun was still bright enough overhead that I could only see reflections in the windows, but when I stepped into the shade of an old oak, the picture inside became clear. 

The laughing was coming from a man in a hoodie. He clutched his ribs with one hand, the other aiming what appeared to be a gun at the clerk. 

“Gun,” I hissed. “Call it.” 

Kate rushed to the car to radio for backup as I stooped lower, tasting acid and chimichanga as I crouched and crept closer. It wasn’t the situation that made me nauseous. It was the laugh. Even muffled through the door, it sounded unhinged. 

I could hear Kate on the radio, informing units in the area of a suspected armed robbery. The glint of the sunshine off the vehicle’s window must have caught the guy’s attention because he turned and looked outside. 

Aside from the patchy beard that was starting to fill in with stubble, the guy was a clean-cut white guy with blonde hair in his late 20s. It was hard to tell through the laughter, but he looked relieved – like he was glad we’d shown up. He made for the exit. 

Kate returned to my side, gun drawn as well, just as the guy stepped out. 

Without the glass buffer, it was so much worse.

His mouth hung open like a scream frozen in time. Tears streamed down his cheeks from eyes crimson with burst blood vessels. His skin looked sunburned it was so red from the strain. 

And that laugh. Not the way a drunk laughs, more like a dying clown’s giggle. It was shrill and wheezy, broken only by raspy gasps for breath. 

“Drop the weapon,” I yelled. 

He tilted his head like he couldn’t quite parse what I’d said. 

Kate whispered, “This is wrong. This is all wrong.” 

And it was. Nothing about the man suggested he was a killer. But the most dangerous people you ever encounter tend to be desperate. And this man was that in spades. 

He marched towards us, ignoring our orders to get down on the ground. Even in that moment, the thought crossed my mind – I don’t want this weighing on Kate’s conscience. So when the man raised his gun, I didn’t hesitate.

Everything went quiet except for the sound of my firearm. Before his body even hit the ground, something wriggled deep inside me, crawling up my throat until it forced its way out. 

The sick feeling from hearing the man’s laugh was only cousin to the disgust and self-loathing that surged in my chest. 

I giggled. 

An almost silly, light-headed laugh – like something popped open in my chest, releasing a burst of joy at the gruesome scene in front of me. 

I clamped my hand over my mouth, but it was too late to stuff it back down. 

Kate looked at me in horror. 

I regained my composure, but I could sense another wave coming on.

“Need… a moment,” I mumbled as I shuffled over to the vehicle and climbed in. I cackled for five minutes straight before the feeling finally passed. 

\*\*\*

By that point, backup had arrived, and I knew from the way she never took her eyes off me as she told the other officers what happened, that Kate was telling them everything. 

Which was probably for the best, since I couldn’t get two words out about the incident without giggling. 

At first it was only around others. Then it happened whenever I thought of him. His blue eyes made even bluer by the bright red of burst blood vessels surrounding his irises. *What was that look?* *I’d wondered at first.* By day two I knew what it was – terror and self-loathing mixed with pleading – begging for someone to make it stop by any means necessary. 

The department put me on leave. It’s standard after an event ends in death, but I could sense they had no plan to bring me back, even if Internal Affairs later determined the shooting was justified and followed procedure.

The psychiatrist they sent me to was sympathetic at first. 

“Odd reactions to trauma are common,” she said when I arrived for our first session, clearly having been informed of the circumstances. “What do you see when the reactions occur?” 

“His body,” I said, dreading the laugh building inside me. “His eyes…”

I howled for thirty minutes straight like I'd just heard the funniest thing in the world.

The psychiatrist didn’t bother asking more questions or scheduling a follow-up. The initial compassion in her voice had disappeared as she told me she was referring me to someone more equipped to treat me and prescribed me something to calm what she described as trauma-induced euphoria. 

The pills helped to suppress the laughs at first so long as I could go without speaking, which wasn’t hard to do since no one I reached out to from work wanted anything to do with me.

Even Kate had turned, though I think it was more out of the discomfort and the trauma of reliving the shooting than true disgust for me like everyone else. She seemed reluctant to buy into my theories of contagious laughter, but she did tell me the man’s name, which was enough for me to track down an address.

\*\*\*

On day three I knocked on his door. His wife opened it, eyes hollowed and puffy from grief. She had no clue who I was until I tried to speak and could only let out a weak giggle. 

“You’re the one who did it, then?” she said.

I hung my head in shame, unsure why I was even here or what she could possibly do to help. I felt selfish, like I was burdening someone to ease my own guilt, but I didn't know where else to go.

“Come in,” she said. 

I sat in her living room, silent, as she told me what she knew. About five days before he’d died, her husband came home from the bar at 4AM. The next morning she was pissed he’d driven and wondered why it took him two hours to get home after closing if they only lived fifteen minutes away. When he tried to explain, he started laughing. 

“He had to write it down,” she said. “That was the only way he could tell me.”

She handed me the piece of paper. The writing was shaky, clearly he’d laughed his whole way through the note, but it was legible. 

*I hit someone with my car but it wasn’t my fault. I wasn’t even drunk. He ran out of nowhere like he wanted to die. I don't know why this is happening.*

“I kicked him out. I didn’t believe him. Who would? The way he was acting. It felt like the most fucked up way to lie about cheating on your wife."

She lit a cigarette and took a long drag before continuing.

"I only spoke to him once more after. He called me from some cheap motel he was staying at. By that point I'd seen the news about a hit-and-run and knew he was telling the truth about that part."

She barely noticed as ash fell to the floor.

"He said it was a virus. Or a curse. He couldn't say much beyond that. Just started laughing again. Honestly, I figured he'd completely lost it until you showed up with the same thing. I- I didn't help him. Left him to deal with it alone."

She let out a soft laugh, then look embarrassed, like it was an unfair gesture to make in front of me.

"I just told him to turn himself in. I guess he did in a way.” 

I tried to ask a question but could only laugh. She handed me a pad and pen. 

*What motel?* I wrote. 

“The one off 11 near the truck stop.” 

I nodded my thanks.

*Sorry,* I wrote.

“Me too,” she said.

\*\*\*

I’d already run out of pills by the time I got to the motel. That much in such a short time span should have killed me, but somehow I felt nothing except the discomfort of laughing steadily again.

“Jesus, another one of you,” the manager said as I entered. “Y’all with some kind of weird circus or something?” 

I suppressed the laughs as best I could as I wrote out my request to see the room the man I killed had stayed in. The manager agreed so long as I paid the overdue bill. I did and he gave me a key. 

Inside the room there were pages scattered everywhere. He’d written nonstop, chasing down every connection he could find, trying to make sense of it just as I was.

He'd taped news clippings to the wall of three deaths prior to his own: the man he’d hit had been hiding after accidentally killing someone in a fist fight. That person had been involved in what was supposedly a deadly domestic dispute.

Three dead bodies, plus his now, and probably a lot more if you could follow the chain back far enough.

He’d even tried to end it without passing it on. If he couldn’t save himself, maybe he could save the next person. But his notes describe various failed attempts – the noose broke, the gun jammed, the pills came back up.

I'd told Kate I thought it was contagious, and my theory had been confirmed. But instead of feeling relief, I felt worse.

Knowing the truth was no help. There were no solutions. No answers. Only more questions. 

*What was it exactly? How far back did it go? And, most important, was there any way to stop it?* 

The only thing that seemed certain was that there were “always five days between hosts.” Which meant I had less than 48 hours to live if the pattern held.

His notes eventually became impossible to read aside from a word here or there. From what I pieced together, the whole thing became intolerable. By the final night he wasn’t sleeping at all.

\*\*\*

That’s the point I’m at now as I write this. The night after the motel, I managed to get tiny pockets of sleep, but instantly I’d dream of him and wake myself laughing. 

Last night, I didn’t sleep at all – his face is superimposed over my vision at this point. The laughter softens, but it never stops long enough for me to rest. 

Supposedly if you go without sleep for long enough, the brain shuts down and you die. I keep telling myself maybe I can push my body to that point and stop the chain. But I know now I'm not that strong, and judging from the motel notes, I doubt that would work anyway. 

This thing wants its next host. 

None of the news outlets had noticed the chain of deaths, so I sent what the man had found to the local paper and Kate. Maybe they’ll figure out a way to end it. Or at least have more empathy for the next person it claims. 

I wasted what little time I had left looking into anything that felt even remotely related.

\-School girls in the Northeast who’d started laughing one day and couldn’t stop. 

\-Whirling dervishes. 

\-Laughing cults. 

\-Contagious PTSD. 

\-The 1962 incident in Tanganyika. 

I wish I had come here sooner. When I Googled it, this place came up as somewhere with answers no one else seems to have. I wish I had come here sooner if for no other reason than it’s nice to have someone believe you. I didn’t want to put that burden on the man’s wife beyond the help she’d already given, but that meeting with her was my last moment of peace. 

I’m hoping someone here can help me. 

Because I tried 911 and they think I’m pranking them. They’ve threatened to send the police if I call again. And I know what happens then. 

So I’m turning to you, one final ditch effort, before I get to that point. 

But I’m so tired. 

So very, very tired.
