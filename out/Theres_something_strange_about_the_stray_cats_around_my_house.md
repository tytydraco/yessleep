Day 1

I've never been one to believe in the supernatural. Everything that happens has a logical explanation. At least, that's what I always thought until the cats appeared.

It started on an early autumn afternoon when I had just moved into this old house. The house is on the outskirts of town, where the air is always a bit colder, and the sunlight isn't strong enough to chase away the shadows among the trees. I chose this place for its tranquility, perfect for working from home without disturbances.

On the first day of moving in, I noticed a small black stray cat sitting on the doorstep. It just sat there, staring at me with bright, glistening eyes, as if observing my every move. I didn't pay much attention and simply nudged it away to carry my boxes inside.

That night, as I lay in bed, I heard strange noises outside. Soft scratching sounds, like someone testing the window or scratching the wood. I got up to check, but there was nothing except the darkness and silence of the night. When I returned to bed, I saw the black stray cat standing outside the window, its eyes glowing in the dark. I shivered but told myself it was just a cat, nothing to worry about.

Day 2

The next morning, I woke up with a strange feeling. My head was throbbing, and I had this sensation that I had been watched all night. When I stepped outside to get the newspaper, I noticed that the water bowl I had placed in the backyard had been overturned. There were cat paw prints around, but oddly, there were also small prints that resembled those of a child.

I didn't have much time to dwell on it, as work consumed me, and I got caught up in meeting deadlines. But in the evening, when I returned home, I felt like something had changed. The house, though undisturbed, felt different, as if someone had been there while I was gone. Small items were out of place, and there was a faint smudge on the bathroom mirror as if someone had touched it.

The cats began to appear more frequently, not just at night but also during the day. They sat on the fence, staring intently at my house, and every time I stepped outside, they wouldn't take their eyes off me. I felt like I was being watched, but not just by the cats. There was something behind their eyes, something that didn't belong to this world.

Day 3

Early in the morning, I woke up with a severe headache and a vague feeling that I had woken up several times during the night without realizing it. As I walked down the stairs, I saw a strange sight: the cats were gathered at the front door as if waiting for something. Their eyes glowed in the dawn light, and they didn't move as I approached. They just stood there, silent and watching me.

A cold shiver ran down my spine, but I decided to ignore them and went outside to check the mailbox. When I returned, I saw a small footprint on the step, but it wasn't from a cat. It looked like a child's footprint, but smaller, as if made by a cat's paw.

All day long, I couldn't concentrate on my work. The cats appeared everywhere, not just in the yard but also inside the house. They never stayed too far from me, always keeping a certain distance and watching my every move. I began to feel like there was another pair of eyes watching me, but I couldn't pinpoint the source.

That evening, I decided to thoroughly inspect the house. While cleaning the basement, I found an old chest securely locked. After some effort, I managed to break the lock and discovered an old, severely damaged journal inside. The pages were written in a firm, neat hand, recording the final days of the previous owner, a woman named Margaret. The journal described how she had raised the cats and used them in occult rituals to seek immortality. But the last pages became chaotic and unreadable, as if she had gone mad.

Day 4

I continued reading the journal in the morning and discovered that Margaret had mysteriously disappeared in 1962. The neighbors only found her cats wandering around the house, with no trace of her. But the strangest thing was that there were reports from locals who claimed to have seen Margaret's figure in the years following her disappearance, but no one dared to approach the house.

While I was reading, I noticed a faint smudge on the mirror in the living room, as if someone had just touched it. My heart raced, and I began to feel like I was no longer alone in this house. I tried to shake off the anxiety by going for a walk, but the cats followed me, not leaving me alone for a moment.

When night fell, I decided to lock all the windows and doors. But the cats started scratching at the doors, making eerie hissing sounds. I tried to sleep, but the strange noises outside kept waking me up. Every time I opened my eyes, I saw the silhouette of a black cat on the windowsill, staring at me.

Day 5

I woke up exhausted and extremely tense. As I descended to the ground floor, I was horrified by what I saw: all the walls in the house were marked with strange symbols, like ancient symbols I had never seen before. Cat footprints and small handprints of a child appeared everywhere, terrifying me to the point where I wanted to flee the house immediately.

I called a friend named David, an expert in the paranormal. David arrived that afternoon, and after inspecting the house, he exclaimed that the symbols might be a form of curse. He wasn't entirely sure of their origin but warned that I should leave the place immediately.

I wanted to heed David's advice and leave, but every time I tried, something stopped me. The first time, my car broke down in the middle of the road, forcing me to return. The second time, I felt a sharp pain in my chest as soon as I reached the gate. It was as if the house was trying to keep me there.

Day 6

I was becoming increasingly frantic. Every attempt to escape the house had failed. The cats grew bolder, not only scratching at the doors but also trying to break into the house. I began hearing strange voices in my head, whispers from an unknown source, but I knew they were coming from somewhere within the house.

I decided to delve deeper into the history of the house and discovered that Margaret had performed a ritual with her cats to seek immortality. But the ritual had failed, turning her into a creature that was part human, part cat, trapped between two worlds. The cats I had been seeing weren't just ordinary animals; they were fragments of her soul.

That night, I had a terrifying dream: I was standing in the middle of a circle of black cats, and in the center was Margaret with empty white eyes, her mouth open wide but making no sound. I woke up in a panic, realizing that the dream wasn't just a dream. Something in the house was manipulating my mind.

Day 7

All day long, I lived in an unshakable fear. I was losing control and could no longer distinguish between reality and illusion. David called me, concerned because I hadn't responded to his messages. I told him I couldn't leave the house, and he promised to come back to help.

As night fell, the cats began gathering in a larger group than ever before. I saw them moving in a line toward the forest behind the house. Despite knowing it could be dangerous, I decided to follow them. When I reached the forest, I found an old well surrounded by the cats. There, I saw Margaret, or at least her shadow. She stood silently, her empty eyes staring straight at me. Before I realized it, I was surrounded by the cats, and everything went black.

The Final Day

I woke up feeling as if I had been imprisoned in this house forever. I didn't know how long I'd been here, but everything around me remained the same. The cats were still there, still watching me with glowing eyes, as if waiting for me to do something. I knew I could no longer escape. There was no way out.

I decided to perform a reverse ritual to break Margaret's curse. I used what I had learned from her journal and prepared everything necessary. As the ritual began, the cats attacked me. I felt Margaret's fear and pain through them. I knew this ritual might fail, but it was my only hope.

In the final moments of the ritual, I saw Margaret disappear, and the cats slowly vanished into the air. But before everything ended, I felt a cold shiver down my spine, and I knew I had made a mistake. The curse hadn't been completely lifted; it had merely transferred from Margaret to me...
