BEGIN LOG>>>  
  
I don't have much time. The power has been fluctuating for hours now. Something is wrong with the mainframe. The readings from \[W.H.E.N\] ... they don't make sense.  
  
23:15 - First anomaly detected in Sector 7  
23:45 - Lost contact with security team  
00:12 - \[DATA CORRUPTED\]  
00:30 - They're in the vents. I can hear them moving.  
  
God help us. The experiment... we never should have pushed \[W.H.E.N\] this far. The frequencies we detected weren't just random noise. They were trying to communicate. And now...  
  
\[SYSTEM ERROR\]  
\[ATTEMPTING RECOVERY\]  
  
...blood everywhere. Dr. Chen is gone. The \[W.H.E.N\] containment field is failing. If anyone finds this, DO NOT ATTEMPT TO REPLICATE OUR WORK. The coordinates we found in the signal - they weren't meant to be decoded.  
  
I can hear it getting closer.  
  
This will be my final entry.

RECOVERY TEAM LOG>>>  
  
Day 1: Facility appears abandoned. Emergency power only. Blood traces confirm previous report. No bodies found.  
  
Day 2: Located Dr. Chen's keycard near quantum containment chamber. Chamber itself... empty. Walls show signs of... growth? Taking samples.  
  
Day 3: Team member Williams disappeared during night shift. Radio interference increasing. The same frequencies from original experiment detected, stronger now.  
  
Day 4: Found Williams. Or what's left of \[DATA CORRUPTED\]. The growth is spreading. It's not organic. It's... calculating something.  
  
URGENT: We've decoded more of the original signal. It wasn't a message. \[W.H.E.N\] was a blueprint. They weren't trying to communicate.  
  
They were trying to build something.  
  
\[SIGNAL LOST\]

PROJECT ECHO - Research Notes  
Dr. Sarah Chen  
  
The signal patterns we've detected in the quantum noise field are unlike anything previously documented. Initial analysis suggested random fluctuations, but there's structure here. Mathematical precision that defies natural occurrence.  
  
What's more concerning are the temporal anomalies. Equipment in the lab has been... behaving strangely. Last week, we found a computer that had been running calculations for three weeks, except the logs showed it had only been powered on for six hours.  
  
Dr. Miller insists we continue. The military implications of this discovery are too significant to ignore. But something about these patterns feels wrong. Like we're looking at something that's looking back.

INCIDENT REPORT #2189  
DATE: \[CLASSIFIED\]  
LOCATION: 50km exclusion zone around former Delta-9  
  
Aerial reconnaissance shows unusual geometric patterns forming in the vegetation surrounding ground zero. Satellite imagery attached.  
  
Analysis of recovered data suggests Dr. Chen's team may have inadvertently created a bridge. The question isn't where they made contact with.  
  
It's when.  
  
\[ATTACHMENT 2189-A: MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS\]  
The patterns appear to be growing in complexity. They're not random - they're rewriting themselves. The same way the signal rewrote our computers. The same way it rewrote \[DATA EXPUNGED\].  
  
PRIORITY ALERT: Multiple temporal anomalies detected within exclusion zone. Reports of "missing time" from nearby settlements. Local wildlife exhibiting unprecedented behavioral changes.  
  
RECOMMENDATION: Immediate expansion of quarantine zone to 100km radius. Implementation of Project TIMELOCK authorized.  
  
God help us if we're already too late.  
  
\[CONNECTION TERMINATED\]

INCIDENT REPORT #2190  
DATE: \[CLASSIFIED\]  
LOCATION: Temporal Observation Post Alpha  
  
We've detected another anomaly. The patterns aren't just growing - they're accelerating. Time dilation effects have increased exponentially within the exclusion zone.  
  
Field Agent Cooper reported spending 6 hours investigating a temporal distortion. When he returned to base, two weeks had passed. His watch showed only 6 hours. His body showed signs of two weeks without food.  
  
The implications are staggering.  
  
\[ATTACHMENT 2190-B: TEMPORAL ANALYSIS\]  
Time isn't just bending anymore. It's breaking. We're seeing fragments of events that haven't happened yet. Or happened already. Or both.  
  
The growth patterns Dr. Chen discovered... they're not just mathematical sequences. They're temporal coordinates. Each one a window to a different when.  
  
And something is using them to find its way here.  
  
\[WARNING: TEMPORAL BREACH DETECTED\]  
\[SYSTEM LOCKDOWN INITIATED\]  
  
They're coming through. God help us all.  
  
\[TRANSMISSION ENDS\]

INCIDENT REPORT #2192  
DATE: \[CLASSIFIED\]  
LOCATION: Temporal Containment Zone  
  
Multiple timeline collapses detected. Personnel reporting encounters with alternate versions of themselves. Dr. Chen's equations predicted this - the boundaries between realities are becoming permeable.  
  
\[OBSERVATION LOG\]  
\- Three simultaneous versions of Site Director Matthews observed in Sector 4  
\- Equipment showing wear patterns from decades of use despite being newly installed  
\- Research notes documenting events that haven't occurred yet  
  
\[W.H.E.N\] isn't just moving through our timeline anymore. It's merging them.  
  
\[END REPORT\]

INCIDENT REPORT #2193  
DATE: \[ERROR: TIMESTAMP INVALID\]  
LOCATION: \[MULTIPLE COORDINATES DETECTED\]  
  
Reality anchor points failing. Chronological stability at 15% and falling. The growth patterns have achieved consciousness.  
  
They're not just windows anymore. They're doors. And they're opening both ways.

INCIDENT REPORT #2194  
DATE: \[CLASSIFIED\]  
LOCATION: Research Facility Delta-9  
  
Panic is spreading through the facility as the growth patterns continue to manifest. The walls are closing in on us. Personnel are reporting hearing voices from the other side.  
  
\[FINAL LOG\]  
We must find a way to contain \[W.H.E.N\] or face the consequences.  
  
\[END REPORT\]

INCIDENT REPORT #2195  
DATE: \[CLASSIFIED\]  
LOCATION: Temporal Observation Post Beta  
  
The past is becoming as unstable as the future. We've initiated temporal containment protocols, but they are only delaying the inevitable. We've seen glimpses of our own fates.  
  
\[DATA RECOVERY ATTEMPT\]  
Attempts are proving futile.   
  
\[END REPORT\]

INCIDENT REPORT #2196  
DATE: \[CLASSIFIED\]  
LOCATION: Exclusion Zone Alpha  
  
We've lost control. Footage shows temporal rifts opening and closing at will. The growth has evolved. We cannot contain it anymore.  
  
\[EMERGENCY TRANSMISSION\]  
The nature of time is changing because of \[W.H.E.N\].  
  
\[END REPORT\]

INCIDENT REPORT #2197  
DATE: \[CLASSIFIED\]  
LOCATION: Transdimensional Research Hub  
  
We estimate the entity is feeding off the temporal instability. Our equipment is struggling to keep up. Surveillance has detected anomalies approaching the containment barriers.  
  
\[FINAL WARNING\]  
Containment breaches are imminent due to \[W.H.E.N\].

INCIDENT REPORT #2199  
DATE: \[CLASSIFIED\]  
LOCATION: Temporal Containment Zone  
  
We no longer control the timelines. \[W.H.E.N\] has taken on forms that merge realities. We're facing contradictions spanning existence.  
  
Stay vigilant - this will determine the fate of all dimensions.  
  
\[END REPORT\]

INCIDENT REPORT #2200  
DATE: \[TEMPORAL ERROR\]  
LOCATION: \[REDACTED\]  
  
Final transmission from Command. \[W.H.E.N\] has breached all containment protocols. Time itself is unraveling.  
  
Our last hope lies in Project OMEGA. We're going to attempt to seal the breach at its source - before it was ever opened.  
  
If you're reading this, we failed.
