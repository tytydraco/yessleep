I am writing this from a terminal I was never meant to touch. The room hums constantly and it is hard to tell whether the vibration is coming from the machinery or from inside my own body.

My name is Chloe. I am twenty two. I study biomedical science at the University of Kansas and I took a job underground because I could not afford to say no to it.

Marcus was my older cousin. He grew up two streets over. He taught me how to drive. He was the one who picked me up when my dad left and my mum stopped answering her phone. When he said he could help me, I believed him without hesitation.

He told me it was data moderation. Overnight work. Quiet. Isolated. He said a startup had rented space in one of the old salt mines outside Hutchinson and needed someone reliable to sit and watch screens. Forty five dollars an hour. Cash deposited weekly. No paperwork.

I remember laughing and asking if it was illegal.

He just said not illegal for you.

Every night at 9:40 he pulled up outside my apartment. Same car. Same hoodie. Same overwhelming vanilla smell that made my head hurt. He said it helped with the mine air. I never questioned it. He dropped me off at the access elevator, wished me luck, and told me he would be back at six.

I never once saw another employee.

The pod is six hundred feet down. A glass box bolted into the salt wall. A desk, a chair, and a bank of monitors showing scrambled forums, encrypted chat logs, live feeds that made no sense until you stared long enough. My instructions were simple. If something repeated incorrectly, if faces blinked out of sync, if audio looped without reason, I flagged it.

I worked there for almost three months.

Tonight I noticed the smell first.

No vanilla. Just metal and dampness, like blood diluted with water. I assumed the ventilation had failed. I climbed onto my chair and shone my phone light toward the ceiling grate.

Something was wedged inside.

At first I thought it was a mannequin head. Pale. Wrongly shaped. Then I recognized the mole above the left ear.

It was Marcus.

Not attached to a body. Just his head, fitted perfectly into the duct. His skull had been opened from the back and hollowed out. Cables ran through his mouth and eye sockets and disappeared into the salt behind the pod. His teeth clicked gently as air passed through.

I fell backward and hit the floor. My palms slid in something slick and cold. Clear fluid dripped steadily from the ceiling and soaked into my clothes.

Marcus had been driving me here every night.

I got back to the terminal and pulled up the employee handbook. Every page was blank except one sentence repeated again and again.

If you hear clicking do not look at the glass.

Something tapped from the other side.

Slow. Patient.

I looked.

The salt wall was no longer solid. It had turned translucent and pink and faintly veined. It moved when I breathed. The realization came quietly and completely.

This place was alive.

A message appeared on the screen.

The Marcus unit degraded rapidly. Emotional variance. Unnecessary speech.

You exhibit higher compatibility.

Integration is ongoing.

My chest hurt. Not sharp pain. Pressure. Like something pressing outward from behind my ribs. I could hear a faint buzzing sound that reminded me of my phone vibrating on a hard table.

The elevator arrived.

Marcus stepped out.

He looked almost right. Same clothes. Same posture. But his skin hung loosely, sagging at the joints. His eyes did not focus. They flickered softly like a buffering video.

He smiled at me.

Shift is over Chloe, he said. Let’s go home.

He placed his hand on the glass. The pressure made thin cracks bloom outward like ice on a windshield.

Then he unzipped his chest.

Inside was a screen.

On it was a live video feed of you reading this. Your face. Your room. The device you are holding.

A progress bar sat beneath the image.

Uploading host complete at ninety eight percent.

Marcus knocked once more.

He is not trying to get in.

He is waiting for me to come out and take his place.

If you feel heat in your chest right now, if your phone starts vibrating and you cannot tell where the sound is coming from, do not answer anyone knocking on your door.

Someone you trust has already learned how to drive you where you need to go.
