“Cmon loser! ” My supposed friend yelled at me as I tried to keep up on my 2-speed hand-me-down bicycle. I stared at the front tire of my bike as I peddled harder, wondering why I had decided to listen to my friend Adam. My tire wobbled as I peddled harder, my calves burning. Adam had just turned 14, and now that he was a year older than me by a couple of months he had decided he was more mature. “Dude it’s just a stupid clown, don’t be a pussy. ” He had said once we finished watching “IT” during our sleepover at my house last night. I wasn’t scared, not really, but the idea that a clown that eats children can live in the storm drains ignited my imagination.

“Jake, I’ll show you tomorrow that there is no such thing as sewer clowns. ” He had said as we lay there discussing the feasibility of clowns and drains. I looked up from my pedaling and upwards towards the sky. The sky is awfully dark for only 2: 00 pm. I was only about 20 feet behind Adam, but I peddled harder. I wanted to show him that I could be just as mature as he was. “I’ll show you tomorrow that nothing can live in the sewer little bro.

I found a way to get in last summer, but I never got the chance to explore it properly. It’s big, but not anything like the movie” Adam continued, obviously trying to show how brave and nonchalant he is. “Yeah, but what if there are homeless people, or criminals hiding down there. Those are real Adam, unlike Pennywise” I countered. Adam began laughing, probably at me. “Yeah dude, I met the ninja turtles down there last time. ” He began laughing at his own joke like it was the funniest thing he had ever heard.

I turned over and decided I had had enough. I wasn’t planning on hanging out with him again for a long time. Morning had come quickly, and like an annoying fly that wants your food, he just wouldn’t go home. Mom says that he has a rough home life, and that I should be more appreciative that he wants to spend so much time with me. Normally I love hanging out with Adam, but every year he pretends that he is so much more mature than me until my age catches up to him and he shuts up. “Watch out kid! ” Adam yelled as I looked down from the sky.

I had been lost in thought. I didn’t realize that Adam had come to a stop in front of me. We collided and we along with our bikes ended up in a tangled heap at the end of the dead-end street by Adam’s house. “Nice going Jake, Why can't you just be more mature? ” I rolled my eyes and began extracting myself from the pile of metal and limbs. We both stood and picked up our bikes. “It’s not that far, just over in that grass just off the road” Adam gestured vaguely at the abandoned lot we stood in front of.

A kind of eerie silence fell over the entire empty court. I looked back at the intersection we had just crossed. A car lazily drove by, and once its engine slowly faded away, Adam turned to look at me. I saw him shiver, but he tried to play it off like he didn’t feel the atmosphere that had settled around us now that we had stopped. We stood there for a minute longer before Adam spat on the ground. “You ready to see how wrong you were about all of this last night? ” Adam taunted trying to sound braver than I knew either of us was.

“Dude, let’s just go grab some pizza and go home, ” I said, and Adam just laughed and started walking his bike towards the field of grass. ” “Go home if you want pussy, I’m going down there because I know that it’s completely safe. I always knew you weren’t as mature as me. ” That last sentence drew me in just as it was intended to. “I'm only coming because if your dumbass gets kidnapped someone needs to get help. ” I could hear him scoff, but he said nothing. Maybe my words had begun to worm their way into his brain? Before I could continue, he laid his bike down in the grass and propped his leg up on the concrete protrusion coming up from the ground. “What’s that? ” was all I could ask before he started trying to lift a manhole cover off the cone-shaped concrete entry way.

“Help me lift this Jake” he grunted as he struggled trying to get a purchase on the metal lid. “Fine, whatever. Just a quick look around and we leave and grab some pizza, Adam. ” I said before begrudgingly moving to help him. Adam is much bigger than I even with only a 2-month gap between the two of us. Something he loves reminding me about all the time. This time was no exception, and as we both grunted and pulled, he made sure to remind me yet again. “Damn dude, you aren’t even lifting.

You gotta use your muscles like this. ” He said a she tried to appear like an action hero macho man. It was kinda funny, but I couldn’t laugh while I strained against the lid. It began to move slowly, and once a gap opened wide enough for us to grip properly it lifted rather easily. With a final heave we pushed the lid offthe concrete entryway, and watched as it rolled a few feet before coming to rest like a giant quarter dropped on the ground at the arcade I wished I was at. “Just a quick look around and that's it Adam” I tried to say sternly. “I want to get to the arcade and pizza parlor before I have to go home.”

Adam began climbing up the entrance and into the vacant hole. “Don’t worry Jake, I’ll make sure you get there and home safely. That’s the mature thing to do. ” I rolled my eyes as I watched him disappear into the darkness. He reached the bottom only 10 feet down and I saw him turn on his pocket flashlight. “See, it’s just a room with some tunnels going in different directions. Nobody is down here Jake. ” I sighed and hoisted myself up and over onto the bare metal ladder. The cold metal rungs bit into my hands as I climbed down. My feet hit the dry and dusty floor first.

As I stepped away from the ladder Iwas able to take in the sight around me in the dim glow of Adam’s flashlight. Adam was right, the room we stood in was much smaller than those in the movie. Maybe 6 feet high and 6 feet wide. The empty concrete rectangle we stood in ended about 40 feet in front of us. Behind us, a large and gaping maw stood. The circular entrance was only about 4 feet in diameter. At the other end of the tunnel sat 6 smaller entrances only about 2 feet or so around.

“Alright Adam, you proved your point, let’s get out of here and go get some pizza. ”Adam just laughed. “You can go home if you want Jake, but I’m going to explore this tunnel to show you just how much you being scared of that movie is immature. I wanted to reply but as I shuffled towards the ladder fully prepared to leave Adam down here my feet splashed a bit in some water on the floor we hadn’t noticed before. “Was this water here earlier? ” I asked Adam, but he had already climbed into the 4-foot hole and was making his way down the tunnel.

I looked up at the darkening sky through the small circle above me. “Asshole, ” I said to myself before turning and climbing into the tunnel behind him. I tried to crouch and walk so I could catch up to the now-fading orange glow coming from Adam’s fading form. “Wait up Adam! ” I yelled as I struggled to catch up. I noticed a small trickle ofwater flowing softly along the bottom of the tube we were in. Gross, poop water, was the only thing I could think of as I straddled the stream and followed Adam. “Have you been down this far before?”

 “Nah, just into the big room. I didn’t have a light with me. ”His reply echoing around us through the tunnel. I said nothing as I continued forward. We continued along for what felt like at least 20 minutes. Every so often we would pass a random pipe entering the main tunnel. Always about 2 feet in diameter.

Some had water trickling out of them and others were dry. “I wonder where these go? ” I said to Adam as we passed another one. “I think they connect to the holes in the sidewalk, no clown is gonna fit inside that. ” Was his reply. I said nothing thinking about that scene from the movie where Georgie is dragged to his death. “Yeah” was my only reply as I shuddered trying to push the image from my mind. Adam would never let me hear the end of it if he knew what I was thinking.

We passed another rectangular room with 4 large-diameter pipes connected into a single junction. The 4-foot pipe we had just exited, and the other same-sized holes one arch wall. Another ladder led up into the ceiling where I assumed we could exit like we had entered. “I'm leaving you here if you don’t leave with me. ” Not waiting for his reply I began climbing the ladder. Once I reached the manhole cover I pushed up against it.

It didn’t budge, I strained harder but even pushing up as hard as I could, the metal disk refused to give. “Watch out Jake, let me try. I'm a lot stronger than you. ” Adam said from below as he moved closer to the ladder waiting for me to descend. Before I could respond we heard an odd sound coming from every tunnel at once except the one we had just come from. “Wha... what is that? ” I asked gripping the ladder tightly. “It’s probably just a truck or something, don’t be a baby” Adam replied his light flicking between each of the entrances making the sound.

I began to climb down to investigate further and allow Adam to try andopen the cover. Before I even took a single step down another rung, water began to slowly trickle from the three tunnels we hadn’t come from. As Adam and I watched, the waterbegan to increase in volume quickly. “What is going on? ” I asked scared now, but the thought of clowns was far away. “I... I don’t know” was all Adam replied as he began to back away from the quickly growing flood of water that was now flowing rather quickly into the space. “Go up!”

 Adam said, the panic in his voice. “I don’t wanna get wet, climb up as highas you can Jake. ” I didn’t hesitate to make room for him on the ladder. There wasn’t any room for us to stand side by side in the narrow tunnel leading up to the manhole, but he was able to stand below me. “It’s filling up! ” I could hear the raw fear in his voice as the water began to lap at his sneakers. The water was now gushing from each tunnel as he tried to climb higher and push me up into the cold metal above. “Stop! You’re hurting me Adam” I said as he tried to force himself higher into the space I occupied. “Dude you have to move, I'm going to end up in the water if you don’t! ” He continued pushing up against me cramming me tighter into the enclosed entrance. I looked down and in the faint light of light I could seethe water up to his knees. “I can't move, the cover is stuck, and we both can't fit dumbass”I retorted, the fear evident in my voice now.

I felt him grab my leg and start pulling. “Move out of the way you idiot! ” Adam yelled as he now tried to pull me off the ladder completely. “Stop it! ” I yelled as the sound of rushing water grew louder. I locked my arms around the top rung and held on tightly as my friend tried to pull me off the ladder in panic. I closed myeyes and held on tighter. I never claimed to be mature.

I never wanted to come down here. I broke down crying. My eyes squeezed shut as I felt Adam trying to dislodge me from the ladder. I began sobbing as Adam cursed and pulled below me. “Jake, help me I’m scared! ”Was the last thing I heard while I felt one last pull on my leg followed by nothing.

I opened my eyes and only saw the darkness around me. “Adam! ” I yelled as loudly as I could. The waters noise was deafening. I heard no response as I clung to the ladder in pure darkness. I pushed upwards feebly one last time as I felt my socks begin to soak up water. “A... Adam? ” I whimpered as the water rose indifferently.
