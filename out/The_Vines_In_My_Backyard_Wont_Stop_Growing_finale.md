My breathing stopped. My dark little secret had been brought to the embarrassing light.  My face became flushed, and my back began to sweat in nervousness.

“How long did he know?” I thought anxiously to myself, “Did he know the whole time? Did he break in to catch a glimpse of the hole? How did he know I heard the kudzu growing when dug?”

The last question stuck out like a sore thumb. 

His face turned to mine, and I could see there were tears in his eyes. I had hoped that they were the tears of realizing that he was not alone, but they were the tears of pity. 

“I should've figured it had come to this. With all the barking at night, your shortness with me, and it looking like the life had been jus’ plucked from ya,” he said solemnly 

“How do you know I hear it grow?” I said hesitantly 

He looked at me, his eyes deep and dark, “I hear it too. I've seen the kudzu swaying at night, even when you can't see it.  You feel its presence creeping closer and closer in your mind until it swallows you.”

He paused and took a deep breath, “I've seen it. The being that stands amongst the shadows.  I know how his scent fills your soul with the sweetness of rotten fruit. Unlike you, I know exactly what that is. It's the smell of the flowers that bloom on those demon vines. The cruel beauty that is born from the kudzu's hunger.”

“But how?” I asked in desperation.

“A dark evil resides in the vines behind this house. One that craves everything that makes you a human. It wants to devour your being and suffocate it.” he looked away into the deep forest, “it used to stand by me always. It pursued me and tried to bribe me with many things I desired in my heart. But I knew once I started, I couldn't stop. The only way I could get it to stop pestering me throughout the night was by embracing the fireflies.  When I had them around me, it wouldn't dare to step towards me. The fireflies chased it back into the dark woods where it couldn't reach no one anymore. Or so i thought.” 

Finding myself overcome with emotion, I sat down near the edge of the hole, looking down into it. It felt like a mirror for my soul, empty, dark, and devoid of meaning.

“It gave me everything I ever wanted. Everything I ever needed. It made me into someone.”

“That's a load of bull, son. That thing can't make you more of what you are,” he said back, crouching down next to me. 

“But I can't just go back to what I was before. People know my name now. Women actually look at me. I can't just be a nobody again.”

“I don't know where that being will take you, but it won't be anywhere pretty. Just promise me, son,” he put his hand on my shoulder,” fill this hole in and stay close to the fireflies. You'll be alright if you stick with them.”

“Okay, I  promise I'll never dig again.”
The 
I knew in my heart that it wasn't true. 

As he left, I went up to my room and put my head on my pillow. The kudzu groaned and grew deep into the forest as I slept those nights. For the days after, I would fight the thoughts of digging. The lightning bugs came and stayed for a while. I hoped they would bring comfort, but they just left me in shame, illuminating my faults.

I couldn't find it in myself to fill the hole. Every time I stood over the moved earth, ready to undo my mysterious ritual, I would smell that sweet, flowery smell. It would make me think of the times when I was somebody, and I would lose hope that I could ever go back to who I was before. The logical part of my brain was urging me to fill it and move on with my little life, but deep in the primal part of my brain, I knew that I could never fill that hole and turn my back on what powers it gave me. It was as if my brain chemistry had changed.

 I would catch myself looking out my window, hoping to see the figure standing there. I saw only the damn hole. 

My life had turned from great and everything I could ever want to a sickly, unlucky version. worse than ever before. Worse of all, I lost Sarah. Those blue eyes no longer looked at me the same way. Andrew had filled my place, and she looked at him the same way she used to look at me. I hated the way it made me feel. I hated that i had a taste of what I wasn't.  I craved the blissful ignorance I had before I moved to the house and before I dug that hole.

The day I first spilled human blood was a mistake.  It happened so fast. I was driving home from work, my mind drifting to the hole, and I hit them. It was just outside, around the corner from my house. The tiny car crunched and squealed as mine slammed into the back. The sickening squelch of metal bending in ways that it had not been designed for. When I came to my senses, I heard a woman screaming. 

“No! God no!” she would beg, hoping for the inevitable to change. 

I leaped from my car, running to theirs. I could hear fluids rushing from underneath the wreckage. Then I saw what the woman was screaming about.

Her husband had been driving. His face had become caved over the steering wheel, where the airbags should have deployed. His teeth, facing the opposite direction, held back all manners of horrors from spilling out onto the dash. 

It was strange, I couldn't look away. I saw the hole. His face looked like the hole in my backyard

“This can't be possible,” my head spinning,” even now I can't help but see it. Begging me to come back.”
I had to force my eyes away from the image. I ran back to my car and hid. His wife's cries cut through my soul like ice. I sat there until the paramedics arrived and took the man's body away, and the woman left in a police cruiser behind them. Through the blur of people rushing around me, I saw the being standing in the shadows. Every crossing shadow formed into his shape, standing, watching. It had infected my soul, the hole. 

I had hoped to be taken away and locked far, far away from the source of my madness. Instead, I walked home and thought of that man's mangled face wrapped around the steering wheel. 

Why had they left me alone? Why had I not been pressed charges?  Why did it feel like the being was actively sabotaging my mind and saving me from any repercussions? 

These questions haunted me as I rounded the corner to my house. All of a sudden, as I saw the profile of my house pressed against the night, I had an idea.

“If I could just dig more, then this would all disappear. I would go back to the old me, and I could forget all about tonight.” The sweet sick thought swirled around my head as I stepped closer to my place. I tried my hardest to fight the ideas messing with my brain.

I was stuck. My car was gone, and I was stranded at my house. I tried to fight it. Hours seemed like years, and minutes seemed like lifetimes. I tried my hardest to avoid any thoughts of the hole. I shut the blinds, hoping to avoid any sort of trigger to my vice.  Then i began to hear it. I could hear the hole breathing. In and out. Inhale and exhale, like a metronome swinging perfectly in time. The breathing grew louder until I felt as though I could feel its hot breath against the back of my neck. I was frozen where I stood. I felt the vines creep up my legs and slither up my body, their damp tendrils leaving waves of goosebumps in their wake. The kudzu tenderly glided its way up to my head, where it plunged deep into my ear canals. I felt the leaves push hard against the walls of my ears as they drove themselves deeper and deeper. The vines hugged my brain as it wrapped itself around it.  It wasn't aggressive or abrasive; it was tender, a reminder. 

I shook and jumped when I fell out of this trance. I reached to pry the vines from my head, but when my hands clawed, they found nothing. There were no vines, and I could no longer hear any breathing. There was no evidence of anything tangible actually happening to me – except for the back door being cracked open, not by my doing.

Creed's warnings echoed in my head, fighting with the temptations, I decided to try to visit the old man to get my mind off of it. I hoped to see the clouds of lightning bugs sparkling as I walked down the street towards Creed's place. The night was dark and devoid of all sparkling.

His house was black when I walked up to his porch. This was the first time I had seen his house be dark. I rang and knocked many times to no response. 

“I guess the old man isn't home tonight. Maybe it's a sign that I really am supposed to return to the hole,” I rationalized with myself, twisting the circumstances to fit my plans.

I went to my backyard and entered through the side gate, closing it quietly behind me.

As I turned the corner I saw a mass of lightning bugs that I had hoped for earlier.  They wouldn't stop blinking around the dirt I had moved while digging. It was then that I realized  I hated the lightning bugs. I had missed the darkness of the night, and they were interrupting it. They wouldn't allow my dark to stay dark.

 I could feel it again—the presence of the being. Its familiar scent surrounded me. I saw it standing at the edge of the woods like all those times before. The sweet song of the kudzu growing accompanied it. I thought of how I had missed it watching over me, how I missed having something that completely understood me, and what I really wanted. 

I ran for my shovel, hoping to see the soil turn back into its malleable self. 

It had not. It was dry and hard just as it had been the days before. My shovel would be useless as it had been. Why had it visited me if not to dig more?

“Flesh”

I looked towards my companion in bewilderment. I saw it point its hands into the woods, and I followed. 

The kudzu made a path for me as I walked into those woods. The familiar churning and growing sounds accompanied me as I walked into the darkness. The ground was soft and moist as if the sun had never reached it. As we twisted through the woods, my mind raced, thinking of what horrors or joys I might find amongst the vines. I could see a small profile trashing in the shadows. My heart was cold as the kudzu led me to the thrashing.

As I approached, I began to make out what was happening. A small bird had been caught in the vines. The bird was ordinary. It wasn't a beautiful bluebird or a talented mockingbird; it was just a bird. It reminded me of me. It struggled and fought against the grasp of the vines wth no luck 

The being was close behind me now, standing behind me and almost whispering in my ear.

“Flesh” 

The thought of murdering this animal seemed cold in my head. It had felt like an icicle lodged between my eyes. I have never purposely killed anything bigger than a bug.  I began to walk back, hoping to see a way back to where I came from and who I used to be before this damn figure invaded my consciousness.  The being was closer to me now. I could feel its ethereal weight against the air surrounding it. Its darkness pressed its silhouette against the shadows of the moonlight. It followed my movements with what seemed to be its head. I could smell the flowers strongly now. Its arm reached out and placed itself on my shoulder; it was wet, heavy, and wrong. I began to see a vision.

I saw myself making everyone laugh at work. I saw awards and prizes on my desk and a phone full of messages and notifications. Most importantly, I saw Sarah. She was holding me closer than we had ever been before. Her eyes filled with admiration and lust. I could finally have her. The way I had always hoped. 

The being's hand left my shoulder, and I returned to the scene before me.

“Kill” 

The image of myself burned bright in my psyche as I found myself with a shovel in hand, standing over the bird.
“It's just a bird,” I told myself. “Don't we kill thousands of birds every day to keep us fed? How is this any different?” 

With a thud that gave me more pleasure than I would like to say, I ended that ordinary fowl’s existence.

The being standing close pointed back to where the hole was in my backyard. 
“Flesh.”

I picked up the body, knowing instinctively what I had to do. I carried the bird on my shoulder as I returned, the kudzu helping to propel me with every step. 

The hole looked warm and welcoming when I saw it. The being stood and pointed down into the hole, confirming my suspicions. I threw the corpse into the hole. The body didn't make a sound as it fell; it was as if the hole caught it and embraced it into its depths. The being faded, and the smile I noticed had returned.

Sick to my stomach, I looked away from the hole in shame at what I had just done. The lightning bugs returned, descending into the hole, illuminating the body of my victim. It looked as though they were trying to revive it from its current state. In fear of what I had become, I ran to my room and tried to sleep this nightmare away. As I finally fell asleep, I could hear the crunch of the bird's bones as I killed it. It replayed in my head throughout the night.

When I awoke the next morning, I ran to my window to see no evidence of the bird in the hole. The only evidence I could ascertain was the memories I held. 

As I drove to work, I noticed that there was no more traffic. The lights were always green. The closest space to the door of work was open. As I moved to my desk, it became obvious that I had returned to the form  I once had. My coworkers greeted me as I walked by, complimenting my clothes and physique as they had never done before. When I reached my desk, I found that someone was sitting in my chair. It was Sarah. She spun the chair, and I could smell her perfume filling my soul. I noticed her blouse was unbuttoned more than usual. She looked up at me with those dewy blue eyes.
“I've been waiting for you.”

My heart skipped a beat. Her voice was filled with more than just the friendly tone it had been before. It was filled with the honey flow of attraction and lust, just as my vision in the woods had shown me.  I knew in that moment I would give everything to keep her looking at me in this way.

My day continued with Sarah flirting and teasing me in a way that I had never experienced before. My heart raced as she walked by and stared at me. Not just me, the whole me. She would whisper in my ear about how she hoped we would be put on a project and have to work late into the night. I had never felt like this. The thrill of a woman's gaze had never been upon me until this moment.  I couldn't live without it.

Unfortunately, the work day came to an end, and I had to return home. When I returned home, I saw the kudzu had grown significantly. It began to rule over my backyard and descend deep into the hole. 
As night fell, I could hear the word again.
“Flesh.”  

I knew what had to be done 
A new path of kudzu had opened up, leading me into the dark forest. 
The being watched as I beckoned ot its call.
It led me to where a small squirrel was bound by the vines. 
It was swift and painless. I took and disposed of the body as I had done the night before. I carried less shame that night than I had the night before. As I returned to my room, I could hear the kudzu growing. 
The next days and the days after were similar. Every night, I heard the call and followed. The woods grew deeper with every night. Learned that I loved the night. The darker the better. The animals I slayed ranged from small birds to deer. I found the larger the kill and sacrifice, the more I was given by the hole and the being. As I slept those nights, the being was in my room, standing over me. 
Watching over me. 

I gained a new wealth after I killed a small rabbit. 

“Here, I think you deserve this,” my boss said the morning after. He had given me a substantial raise that I was surprised the company could even offer. 

Soon, I forgot about that car crash. I forgot almost everything. I had even forgotten about Creed. He didn't stop by anymore. His house was dark. Jasper still barked. I needed nothing except for what the being and the hole would give me. 

When I killed the deer and threw its body into the hole, Sarah had asked me out.

“Just come out and get drinks with me. Please?” she said with those marble eyes penetrating my soul.

Of course, i said yes.

I got home that night with butterflies in my stomach. I had to make sure everything was perfect for us that night.  

As I was getting ready, I smelled that sweet floral scent once more. The being, my friend, had returned. It stood, beckoning me into the woods. I knew I had no choice but to follow its command. 

I followed it deeper than I ever had before. My mind raced as I wondered if I would make it in time for my date with Sarah. The darkness felt different as I descended deeper. I felt like a goldfish swimming deep into the ocean. Tiny, insignificant, and stupid. The darkness I had once enjoyed felt heavy and thick. I could feel the shadows fill my lungs with each breath. The vines grew and groaned louder than I had heard before. 

Finally, I had reached the spot. The familiar mass of vines came into view. The being was no longer standing over the knotted, thrashing vines. It had never been as close to my victims as it had been then. The vines retreated, leaving only the ones needed to restrain my sacrifice. Then I locked eyes with my familiar offering.

It was a medium-sized dog with a familiar pattern of white and black fur. It barked the familiar tune that I used to sleep to. It was Jasper. Ice ran through my veins. Jasper's eyes searched mine for hope.

I had none to give.

 I knew that the bigger the prey, the more the being bestowed upon me. I couldn't risk my night with Sarah. I had become so twisted that I weighed the chance to get laid over the life of my ieghboors best friend. 

“I've never killed anything this personal before,” my thoughts took a dusigutingly hopeful tone, “The things it would bring me must be magical.”

My shovel was light in my hand. The bones of the dog crunched as it died. The crunch brought me much pleasure. I am ashamed to say I was happy as I dragged its body back to the hole. I was delighted as the hole swallowed it fully.

I arrived at the bar to be greeted by Sarah. She was radiant, and the night went exactly as I had hoped.

It was her idea to go back to her apartment. Her idea to go to her bedroom. Her clothes fell with ease, as did mine. We fell back into the sheets and did what I've only done in my dreams.

While we were intertwined, the being and the hole dominated my mind. It filled me. As our fornication reached its conclusion, I looked down, hoping to peer into those beautiful blue eyes. I saw the hole caved into her face where her eyes should have been. I could hear the word echo through my head, feeling like a chisel scraping against the inside of my skull,

“Flesh.” 

I jumped off and shook my head; her eyes returned to their normal brilliance. I needed to get home. I felt drawn back there as if alarms were blaring in my ears. Of course, Sarah didn't mind. Why would she? I was filled with the electricity that my earlier kill had given me. 

When I returned home, I found nothing. 

Not a single thing was out of place. I checked every lock and every door, and I saw nothing. 

Creed's house remained dark.

As I slept that night, I felt the vines embrace me. They held me as i slept. I awoke the next morning to that familiar scent. It was the first time I had smelled it during the day.  I looked outside to see the being there. In the light. Beckoning me into the forest once more. The kudzu was deafening as it guided me into the woods. I passed the spot where I had killed the first bird, and eventually, where I had killed Jasper. The sun had been completely blotted from the sky as I reached the new spot for me to spill blood. 

Once again, I saw the mass of vines squirming in its familiar fashion. Only this time it was much larger than before. 

A mass of blonde hair began to emerge from the vines as it loosed its grasp. A once again familiar form came from the vines. Its blue eyes began to lock onto mine. Sarah was my next victim.

I felt joy in knowing that I will become more than I could ever have dreamed if I gave the being her. I knew that I could have the world if I dropped my shovel into her temple like I had done so many times before with the various creatures. 

A rabbit gave me money. 

A deer gave me an opportunity with Sarah.

Jasper gave me Sarah.

Now what on earth would Sarah give me? 

I couldn't wait to find out. 

I kept my eyes open as I hit her with my shovel. I made sure it was fast; she didn't deserve to suffer. I dragged her body back to the house with a fever, eager to see the new blessings I had received. Twigs and dirt became trapped in her hair. Her skin, once radiant, now a dull white. She had turned from the thing I needed the most to the next stepping stone in my ascension. 

When I returned, I found that night had fallen.

Her body fell like the others. Silent and slow. The hole had received my payment, and I eagerly awaited my promised blessings. 

I ran to bed like a kid on Christmas Eve. My eyes were heavy, and as I fell asleep, I could see the being bending down to watch me drift off. Its form was covered in its horrific smile. 

I wasn't awoken by my normal sun on my face or my alarm clock, but by a vine shoving its way down my throat. My screams were covered by the vines, and my limbs were being dragged out of my house by the same. I fought and thrashed with all my might, but I had no luck. The vines dragged me for hours and hours. I felt the forest move as I descended deeper. My strength waning, I waited to see what the vines had in store for me. Surely the being would never hurt me. It only wanted to make me more than I was. 

The vines had stopped moving, and I felt them release their grip on me slightly. The sound of footsteps grew closer as I felt the web of vines loosen until only my limbs were bound tight. I looked and saw the being standing over me.

“See, I knew that it wouldn't hurt me,” I thought, relieved to see the thing I thought to be my savior.

The footsteps grew loud and close. I heard the familiar groan of the kudzu. From behind the being, I saw a new figure, one I was quite familiar with, step out. 

It was Creed.

Shovel in hand, he stood over me.  His eyes grew wide in recognition.


“No, I jus’ can't do it!” he yelled at the being,” this has gone way too far. Ya hear?”

The being raised its black shadow arm, and a breeze fell through the woods. On the breeze, we could hear the barks of Jasper. With every bark, I could see his defiance erode. 

“I'm sorry, son. I have ta’ get my boy back,” he said with solemn resolve. 

I knew I was going to die. I knew the calls of the kudzu had finally driven Creed into the woods. 

He stepped over me and held his shovel above my head just as I had done countless times before. I was just a pawn in the Being's master plan to seduce Creed into its viney grasp. 

His shovel fell with a crack as he killed me.

Creed was right.  

That thing can't make you more of what you are.

As I fell into the depths, the ancient evil that resided in the soil embraced my body. 


The lightning bugs would never shine again.
