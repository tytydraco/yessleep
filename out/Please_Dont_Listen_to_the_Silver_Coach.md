“Got any spare change?” He was in front of me in line and was eight cents short of a large fry. He looked like he needed all the calories he could get.



“Nah, but I’ll get it for you,” I said. I pressed the power button on my phone twice then extended my digital card to the reader before he could respond. I wasn’t really being a nice guy, I was just hungry and didn’t want to wait while he begged the rest of the line for pocket change.



“You’re a real brother!” He said, pulling me into his stained shirt that I *thought* might have been white in a past life. 



My hand reached instinctively to plug my nose, but I caught myself and brought my arm back to my side. “No worries,” I said.



“No, no, You gotta let me do something to repay you. I’ll be right back.”



“Really, don’t mention it,” I said. But he was already heading outside. 



Five minutes later I was walking out to my car with a brown bag filled with fresh nuggets and fries in one hand, and a large coke in the other. I was just shifting into reverse when I felt a buzz in my pocket. I put my car in park and checked my phone. Could’ve been that girl I’d just matched with on Tinder, ya know?



It’s funny how the smallest decisions can have the biggest consequences. I don’t even remember what the girl’s name was, but it wasn’t her anyway. It was from the gym that I’d *almost* signed up for. If I would’ve just driven straight home, everything would be different.

By the time I looked up, there he was, tapping on my window and grinning so wide that I thought he probably could have fit my whole head inside his mouth. A feat that would be made even easier by the fact that he had no teeth. He was holding the box of fries in one hand and they were still completely full.



“Hey,” I said as I rolled down the window. “Did you need something?”



“Just eight cents!” He said in an overjoyed voice. “But my good friend…” he gestured for me to fill in the blank.



“Steve.”



“My good friend Steve took care of that for me, so now I’m going to take care of you!”



“Huh?”



“You’re fucking fat, man.”



“What the fuck is wrong with you?” I wanted to open the door and take a swing at him.



 He must have sensed my intentions, because he took a step back and hit me with that smile again, somehow threatening and kind at the same time, like he was saying, “Hey, I just want to help ol’ brother, but if you mess with me I’m gonna mess with you, and you aren’t gonna like it.”



“Nothing’s wrong with me, but you my man… you’re gonna die by thirty-five at this rate. That’s in… how many years?”



“Wh-what?” My doctor had said the exact thing about a month prior. I’d be thirty-five in just four years, but I’d given up on trying to correct my course.



“Four years, huh. Well, I can see you’re getting a little upset. But believe it or not, I really am here to help. Here, take this. I call him the silver coach.” He handed me a small silver trophy, just like the ones I got in little league baseball. Only instead of a kid standing in his batting stance, this was a man standing mid-step on a treadmill.



“How did you–”



“Close your right eye,” he instructed.



When I did the trophy man went from average sized to fat, stomach turning into a bulging ball the size of my own stomach. As the man’s weight increased so did the realism of the trophy. I could see the fat on his neck and cheeks enlarge, and a tear seemed to well up in the figurine's eye. I reached forward to wipe it, but, no, of course, it was dry. *Trophies can’t cry.*



“Now your left,” he continued.



This time the man on the treadmill turned into a skinny but toned man. I could see the muscles in his calves, his jawline, and of course, his flat stomach underneath the tight compression shirt. He was now smiling—proud.



“This is crazy,” I said. “Where did you…”



“Trust me,” he interrupted. “It’ll help.”



He turned around and walked away before I could say anything else. It was weird as shit but at the end of the day he was just some weirdo at the local McDonald’s. I honestly figured it might have been a prank or something. Maybe the trophy was super expensive and I could get some money for it. Weren’t YouTubers always doing that kind of shit? Find a nice guy who’s willing to give them eight cents, and then all of a sudden they’re gifting the dude a car or a million dollars?



As I turned out of the parking lot I looked through my rearview mirror and saw the man one last time. He was on his knees and looking straight up into the sky. He held the McDonald’s box with both hands and dumped all of the fries into his mouth at once, not dropping a single one.



When I got back to my apartment I sat down on the couch and set the trophy and my bag of food down on the coffee table. I couldn’t help but stare at the trophy.



I closed my right eye. Fat, sad, and worthless, *That’s me.*



I closed my left eye. Fit, happy, and handsome. *That’s what I could be.* 



When I looked at the trophy with both eyes it was different than before. Its eyes were narrow and its lips were in a flat straight line. It seemed disappointed. 



*Trophies can’t be disappointed,* I thought. 



But either way that thought was enough to make me throw away the bag of McPoison. *Fuck it,* I thought. *I’ve always wanted to try intermittent fasting.* I decided I wouldn’t eat for the rest of the day, maybe even the whole weekend. 



I went online and finished signing up for the gym, then I went for a walk around my neighborhood. About midway through I walked past an elderly couple. They must have been in their seventies at least, but they walked swiftly and proudly—speed walking is what you’d call it—like they had somewhere to be. They matched each other’s strides with a degree of synchronicity that could only come from years of joint practice.



The man gave me a nod while his wife put up her hand in a shy “hello” gesture. There was a sort of respect in the way they looked at me. Like they were thinking to themselves, “Hey, he’s a fatso but at least he’s not like the other one’s. This one? No, he’s like us. He’s *active.*”



And I decided then that I would continue to be active. Maybe when I was seventy-years-old I’d been the one speed walking around the neighborhood, inspiring the fatso who had no idea that I used to be a fatso too.



When I got home I turned on an Apple Music playlist, “BEASTMODE” and did a “Twenty-Minute Six Pack Ab Workout” that I found on YouTube. I knew I wasn’t doing any of the exercises properly, and I had to rest much more often than the ripped and tatted guy on the video told me to, but when I finished the workout and laid on the floor to catch my breath, I was proud of myself for what might have been the first time in half a decade. I wasn’t even upset at not being able to do the workout properly. Even the fact that my stomach stopped me from reaching my feet for “toe-taps” didn’t bother me.



It wasn’t until I looked over at the coffee table that I felt any concern at all.



The trophy was no longer turned towards the couch. Instead it was facing directly toward me, above me on the table as I laid on the floor. My stomach dropped. I felt inferior, like I was being yelled at by a coach who wanted me to know that I wasn’t good enough for his team. 



I restarted the video and went again. I was lightheaded almost immediately. I nearly threw up mid-way through, but each time I thought about quitting I looked over at my trophy. That narrow gaze, and I had no choice but to keep going



By the time I finished the room was spinning. My back and abs burned with over-exertion, even my neck was sore. When I closed my eyes it was like I was on a merry-go-round cranked up a dozen notches too fast. I tried to stand up, but I only got to one knee before I sank and rolled onto my back.



Up on the table high above, like a king staring down at his people, the trophy was smiling at me. Satisfied.



*Trophies can’t be satisfied,* I told myself. 



It was half an hour before I felt well enough to get up. I drank a tall glass of water, but decided against eating anything. *That’ll make him happy,* I thought, then laughed at myself. *Trophies can’t be happy.*



Back in the living room the trophy was back to normal. No satisfaction, no disappointment. I knew that I’d imagined everything, but it was also obvious that the trophy was helping me. It was a representation of my inner coach, a physical depiction of my motivation.



“We did it, Coach! I said to the trophy. “Day one in the books,” I closed my left eye and looked at the handsome, toned man. Perhaps that was my future self. 



*Just an optical illusion,* I thought. *But super, super cool.* 



I put the trophy on my nightstand and settled into bed.



The next day I skipped breakfast and went to the gym first thing in the morning. I did an hour-long “pull day” workout that ChatGPT recommended to me, then I headed home with the idea of a well deserved treat on my mind.



But when I reached towards my freezer with the plan of pulling out an ice cream sandwich, I was suddenly screaming and jumping backwards, slamming against the wall and falling to the floor.



There, the trophy was sitting on the counter. Its eyes were cold, and its lips were as straight as a flatline on a heart monitor.



“Oh, god!” I cried as I sat frozen on the floor. 



“Who are you?” I asked. “What is going on? What do you want?”



It of course didn’t move. It never would, not in front of me. No, it wouldn’t give me the relief of ever being certain, of ever being able to trust my own eyes. It’s only purpose was to punish me, discipline me, and motivate me.



*But it’s doing this to help me,* I thought. What better coach than one that will not allow you to mess up? Who cares if it had to use unsavory tactics. That guy at the McDonald’s—he’d told me it was a gift, hadn’t he? He told me that it would help me. *That’s exactly what it’s doing.*



I didn’t get the ice cream sandwich; I continued with my fast. This time I saw my coach’s face shift into a proud smile. 



“I won’t ever disappoint you again,” I promised.



That afternoon I went for a walk as I nursed the rumbling in my stomach with black coffee. I’d checked with Coach before I left. “Zero calories,” I’d reasoned. “The internet says it’s good for curbing your appetite.” His proud smile never shifted, so I knew that he approved.



When I was just wrapping up I came across that old couple again. This time I smiled and waved. 



“Look at you staying consistent,” the old man called. “Keep it up!” 



I couldn’t help but feel that I’d been accepted into some sort of club. One that only the most committed athletes could be sworn into. 



Over the next few weeks I settled into a routine. I’d go to the gym early in the morning, then do an ab/cardio workout at home. I always checked with Coach to make sure I’d gone hard enough. If he gave me that look, I knew that I had to go again. If I wanted to eat something I checked with Coach first. Usually he said no, but I started to find that he would often say yes to vegetables and lean meats after I’d gone a day or so without eating.



It wasn’t easy. Sometimes I was late to work because Coach wouldn’t let me stop doing my workouts. I did get urges to eat bad food, but I quickly learned that Coach always knew when I messed up. One time I ate McDonald’s on my lunch break, and when I got home at the end of the day, he was waiting for me with that disapproving stare.



“I’m sorry,” I said, falling to my knees. “It won’t ever happen again.”



That night he made me do my workout so many times that I lost count. Every time I tried to give up he gave me that look. When I tried to ignore him his eyes filled with fiery anger. I didn’t want to know what would happen if I tested him, so I kept pushing until my body wouldn’t allow me to go any further. 



In the middle of yet another sixty second plank my arms gave out, and as my stomach hit the floor a stream of vomit came pouring out of my mouth. Within my green and yellow stomach bile there were the bits and pieces of french fries, a patty, and a bun. I laid my head down and rested in my own filth.



When I recovered enough I flipped onto my back and stared up at him. He was satisfied, but not happy and not proud. He looked down at me like I was a dog who’d finally learned to stop peeing inside the house. He’d broken me. I got up from the floor and cleaned the vomit, then brought him into the kitchen.



That night he did not permit me to eat even broccoli and grilled chicken. No, my punishment was not over. It was three days before he let me eat again.



But as hard as Coach was on me I knew that he was good for me. Two months after meeting him I was down a hundred pounds. According to a BMI calculator I was only fifty pounds away from being at a healthy weight. My friends at work were amazed, and my confidence was at an all time high. I was invited out to golf with some of the executives at my company, and a girl on Tinder even asked me out on a date.



But Coach was not happy as I stood in the kitchen telling him about my newfound social life. His eyes narrowed, his lips flatlined, and for the first time ever his fists clenched. I physically saw them close and I started trembling as I apologized almost involuntarily. 



“I won’t go,” I said. “I just thought… Maybe it’s time to celebrate? Do something to make myself happy? I don’t know. I’m being stupid.”



I canceled all of my plans, and that night Coach made me throw up again even though I hadn’t eaten all day. 



It was clear that fun was not a part of my training program. And, as it soon turned out, neither was work. Coach did not allow me to leave for work the next morning, nor the next two days. Instead it was constant intense workouts from the moment I woke up until the moment I went to bed. It was on a Friday morning that I got a voicemail telling me that I was fired.



“We aren’t going to be able to afford this place anymore,” I told Coach. “We’re gonna be homeless. How will I live? Where will I sleep? How will I afford to eat?”



He only smiled. 



During my walk that afternoon I saw the elderly couple again. This time they stopped to chat.



“Wow!” The man said. “You look amazing. How much weight have you lost?”



“Over 100 pounds in only two months,” I said proudly.



“What’s your secret?” He asked.



“A good coach.”



“Oh don’t sell yourself short,” the woman said. “A coach can only do so much. You’re the one who has to get the results. Be proud of yourself, and don’t forget to celebrate.”



“Celebrate?” I laughed. “I don’t think I’ve earned that quite yet. Coach would not be happy with that at all.”



“If you don’t mind me saying,” she continued. “My husband and I are both turning eighty next year and we’re in better shape than most people your age. Our secret? We don’t let fitness consume our lives. We eat cake, we drink wine, but we still go for our walk every day. It’s all a balance.”



“Sure,” I said as I  moved past them. *What do they know?*



“And get a new coach!” The man called. “This one sounds like an ass!”



My training continued for the next two months as my savings dwindled. There was no work, no fun, and only tiny bits of food when it was absolutely necessary. I finally reached a healthy BMI the same day that I received my eviction notice.



Coach didn’t care; the workouts continued. 



I found a cheaper apartment just across the street that didn’t ask to verify my employment, and I was set to move out the next day.



“When will you be happy?” I asked as I packed my bags. “I look fine, don’t I? If I lose any more weight I’ll probably just look weird. I mean, if we keep going like this I’ll be underweight in a couple weeks. Plus… I won’t be able to afford this new place forever. I can’t keep going if you make me workout all day every day. What’s your plan, Coach?”



He only clenched his fists. 



“I’m sorry,” I said. “I don’t know what’s getting into me. You know best. I trust you.”



He was generous enough to let me stop working out long enough to move into my new apartment.



After a month at my new place I weighed 135 pounds and my BMI was 17. Yeah, I could see my dick and my toes when I looked down, but I could also see my ribs and loose skin. I was pale and pimply, I looked sick, and people stared when they saw me out in public. I thought that I looked better back when I was fat, but I knew better than to tell Coach that.



I was out on a walk one day when I saw the couple again. I was tired and my feet were dragging. My heavy footsteps had me slumping from side to side as I struggled to keep my balance. I saw them when I was about thirty feet away. I waved and called out to them, but instead of returning my greeting they crossed the street and started walking faster. 



“Hey!” I called out as I crossed the street after them. “Why are you ignoring me?”



They ignored me again and started walking even faster, so I did too. “Hey!” I screamed. “Where’s my compliment? Do you know how much weight I lost?”



They started running and so did I. “I lost half of myself!” I yelled. “Half of my body weight! I was fat and now I barely weigh 100 pounds! Aren’t you going to congratulate me?”



I couldn’t keep up with them. I fell onto the concrete and rolled onto the soft grass of someone’s front yard. At some point someone came outside and started screaming at me, but I didn’t have the energy to move. All I could think was that Coach was going to be mad if I didn’t come home soon.



At some point I fell asleep, but then a police officer was nudging me with his foot and telling me to get lost, so I started walking home.



I must’ve taken a wrong turn because at some point I was walking up to a McDonald’s. God I needed something to eat. Coach wasn’t there was he? Who would stop me?



I walked up to the cashier and asked for a Big Mac and a large fry, and then I was digging through my pockets for whatever spare change I’d brought with me. 



*Fifty cents short.*



I turned and looked at the guy behind me. He must’ve been even fatter than I once was. “Hey, you got a couple quarters I could borrow?”



He did, and I’d never felt such appreciation. As far as I was concerned, he’d just saved my life. 



I kept trying to take a bite of the burger, but every time I did it was like Coach was there. I was so scared that I started crying. 



I left the food on the table and started running home with more energy than I’d had in so long. I ignored the fiery expression of anger on the trophy’s face as I picked it up and carried it toward the McDonald’s.



I thanked the man and I handed him the trophy. I told him to close his right eye, and then his left. I told him that there’s a balance and I told him to be careful. I said don’t let fitness control your life. You’re perfect how you are but please take care of yourself. Everything will be okay if you just take care of yourself. Please, don't listen to the silver coach.



I don’t know if he listened to a word I said, but I do know that he took the trophy. I know that I sat down and ate my food and enjoyed myself for the first time in a long time.



I don’t know if I can find a balance. I don’t know if I’ll ever be happy, but I’m so glad I got rid of that fucking trophy.
