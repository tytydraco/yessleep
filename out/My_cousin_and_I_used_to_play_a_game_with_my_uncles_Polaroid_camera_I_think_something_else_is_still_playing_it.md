When my uncle died, nobody knew what to do with his house.

He never married, never had kids. It was just him, his little two-story place on the edge of town, and his weird hobbies. He had been "the strange uncle" my whole life—the one who still used a landline, still collected VHS tapes, still had a paper TV Guide by the couch like it was 1998.

So when the lawyer told us he’d left the house to me, my first reaction was pure, selfish relief.

I was drowning in rent. I worked a crappy support job at a software company, taking calls from people who somehow managed to break things by turning them on. The idea of not having to split a one-bedroom with a stranger sounded like a miracle.

The house needed work, but it was structurally fine. Two bedrooms, a tiny kitchen, creaky wooden floors. It smelled like dust and old coffee. It felt… lonely, but not in a creepy way. At least, not at first.

We started cleaning it out the Saturday after the funeral. It was just me and my cousin Lily, who’d been closest to my uncle besides me.

“He really didn’t throw anything away, huh?” she said, holding up a cracked lava lamp.

“Maybe he just thought everything would come back in style,” I said.

We laughed a little. It felt good to laugh.

The Polaroid camera was in the hall closet, on the top shelf, just where I remembered it.

“Holy shit,” Lily said, reaching for it. “Remember this thing?”

I did. When we were kids and got stuck at his house during family gatherings, we’d play this elaborate game where one of us would hide and the other would try to sneak around with the camera and take a picture without the other noticing. You got a point if you caught the other kid on film without them seeing you. Bonus point if they looked really scared.

We thought we invented horror photography.

Lily turned the camera over in her hands. “God, I loved this stupid thing.”

“Does it still work?” I asked.

She popped open the compartment. “There’s film in it.”

“Twenty-year-old film? That can’t be good anymore.”

“Only one way to find out.” She lifted the camera, pointed it at me before I could protest, and clicked.

The camera whirred and hummed and spat out a square. The picture developed slowly, colors muddy and washed out, but it was there: me, standing in the dusty hallway, mid-blink.

“Still works,” she said, satisfied, and set it on the entry table.

We went back to sorting boxes.

It wasn’t until later, when Lily had gone home and I was alone, that I opened the hall closet again and saw the photos.

Hundreds of them.

Stacked in shoeboxes, pinned to corkboards, taped to the inside of the door. Polaroids, all of them. It was like opening the door of some strange, analog Instagram addiction.

Most were ordinary: pictures of my uncle’s living room, his old car, his garden, stacks of books. A few were of people I recognized—me and Lily as kids, my mom, my grandmother before she passed.

But the majority were… backs.

People’s backs. People standing at the sink, hunched over the coffee table, bending to tie their shoes. Sometimes you could see a sliver of face in a mirror or window reflection, but usually it was just the back of someone’s head, the line of a spine through a shirt, shoulders drawn up or slumped.

All of them were taken from behind. All of them looked like the subject had no idea they were being photographed.

A weird, uncomfortable chill ran through me.

I told myself it was just his idea of art. Street photographers did candid stuff all the time. Maybe this was just his version, but… domestic. Creepy, but not illegal.

Still, I closed the closet door and tried not to think about it.



I moved into the house a week later.

At first it was almost nice. Lonely, yeah, but I kind of liked it. The creaks and groans became familiar. My uncle’s old recliner was surprisingly comfortable. I bought a thrift-store lamp, a cheap rug, tried to make it feel like mine.

The first few nights, I slept with the TV on because the silence felt heavy. But nothing too weird happened.

Until I woke up on Wednesday and found the Polaroid on my kitchen table.

I was sure I’d left it on the entry table by the front door. That’s where Lily had set it down. I hadn’t touched it since.

I picked it up, frowning, and found a fresh photo underneath it.

It was me, obviously. Sitting on the couch the night before, laptop open, blue light reflecting off my face as I scrolled through emails.

The photo was taken from behind.

I was wearing the same sweatshirt, my hair in the same messy bun. The TV was on in front of me, a blurry wash of light.

I stared at it, trying to make sense of what I was seeing.

Okay. Okay, calm down.

There was a logical explanation.

I must have accidentally taken this. Maybe there was a timer function I messed with as a kid and forgot about. Maybe I somehow hit it while I was walking by and didn’t hear it over the TV. Maybe—

The rationalizations were flimsy even as I thought them.

“Lily,” I said out loud, relieved at the sudden possibility. She had a spare key. Maybe she was screwing with me. It was exactly the kind of shit she’d pull.

I texted her: **Very funny. You didn’t scare me, you just wasted old film.**

A minute later:  
**What are you talking about?**  
**The pic you took last night. Of me on the couch. Nice stalker vibes.**  
**I was at home last night? I worked a double, I was in bed by nine.**  
**You didn’t come by the house at all?**  
**No?? Why?**

I stared at the screen, my stomach twisting.

I sent her a photo of the Polaroid.

She took a minute to answer.

**Okay that’s actually creepy.**

**You really didn’t take this?**

**Dude, no. Why would that be my idea of a prank?? Burn that house lol**

I laughed, but it came out thin and shaky.

I put the Polaroid in a drawer, camera on top of it, and told myself that was the end of it.



The next one showed up two days later.

I was rushing to work, half-asleep, when I saw it on the small table by the front door: the Polaroid camera, and another photo underneath.

This one was me again, standing at the kitchen counter, pouring coffee into my travel mug. The angle was low, like whoever took it was crouched near the floor.

In the photo, my head was tipped slightly to the side. The back of my neck was exposed.

I ran my hand over that exact spot and felt goosebumps prickle on my skin.

I didn’t text Lily this time. I didn’t tell anyone.

Instead, I did the thing my uncle never would’ve done: I bought a security system.

By that weekend I had three motion-activated cameras set up—one by the front door, one pointing down the hallway toward the bedrooms, and one in the living room. I put the little yard sign out front: **PROTECTED BY SKYSHIELD SECURITY** like a charm against evil.

Just in case it wasn’t ghosts. Just in case some creep really was coming into my house at night.

The next night, I stayed up late on the couch pretending to watch TV while I kept one eye on the live feed from the cameras. Nothing. Just static, soft changes in light and shadow, the occasional flicker as the heater kicked on.

At 1:30 in the morning, my eyes burned. I finally gave up and went to bed.

I woke up at 3:12 AM.

Not because of a noise. Not because of a nightmare.

Because I suddenly felt… watched.

It was like someone had leaned over me while I slept. That suffocating awareness of another presence, inches away.

I lay perfectly still, heart pounding in my throat, and forced my eyes open.

The room was dark. The shadow of my dresser loomed against the wall, moonlight seeping through the edges of the curtains.

There was no one standing over me. No looming shape.

But the feeling didn’t go away.

I sat up slowly, flicked on the lamp, and scanned the room. Empty.

I slid out of bed, forced myself to walk down the hallway, past the dark bathroom and the empty second bedroom, into the living room.

The Polaroid camera was sitting on the coffee table, pointed directly at the hallway.

There was a new photo underneath it.

My hands were shaking as I picked it up.

It was me, asleep in bed, on my side, hair spilled across the pillow.

Taken from behind.

There was something else in the picture, too—something that made my stomach drop.

In the mirror of my closet door, you could see a sliver of the room. My back. The edge of my pillow.

And behind me, just at the limit of visibility, there was a suggestion of a shape. Darker than the rest of the shadows, a hint of height, a slight curve as if someone were bending over me.

I dropped the photo like it burned.

I grabbed my phone and opened the security app. My fingers fumbled with the password.

The hallway feed was empty. The living room feed, too. The time stamps ran smoothly, no gaps, no obvious glitches.

I rewound to 3:12 AM and watched myself on the bedroom camera (I’d put one in there too, after the first photo) roll over and sit up, then swing my legs out of bed and walk to the living room.

No one else. No shadows moving where they shouldn’t be.

And yet the photo existed.



I didn’t go to work the next day. I called in sick and spent the morning seriously considering booking a hotel and never coming back.

Instead, I did something stupider: I opened the closet with the shoeboxes again.

I don’t know what I was looking for. Confirmation that my uncle was just a weird artist. A note saying “lol got you” from beyond the grave.

What I found was a separate stack of photos, rubber-banded together, tucked behind the others.

They were all of the same person.

My uncle.

Sometimes he was sitting at the kitchen table with a newspaper. Sometimes he was in the recliner, head tilted back, mouth slightly open. Once he was brushing his teeth in the bathroom.

All of them were taken from behind.

Every single one.

In a few, you could see his reflection: a tired man with thinning hair, a worn face softened by age. In one photo, he was asleep in bed. In the mirror, behind him, there was the same suggestion of a shape in the shadows.

My hand went cold.

The last photo in the stack was different.

It was of the hallway, right outside the closet I was standing in. You could see the bedroom doors, the scuffed baseboards, the slightly crooked picture my uncle hung of a lighthouse.

It was empty.

Except for a pair of bare feet visible in the very bottom of the frame, heels turned outward, toes pointing directly toward the camera.

The skin on those feet looked wrong—too pale, veins like dark threads under parchment.

The angle was low, like the camera was on the floor.

Like something was lying on its stomach, looking up.

I shoved the photos back into the shoebox, hands shaking uncontrollably now.

I needed air. I needed light. I needed to not be inside these walls with… whatever this was.

I grabbed my keys and went to the front door.

The Polaroid camera was on the entry table, pointed at me.

There was a new photo underneath it.

I hadn’t heard it take anything.

I hadn’t seen the flash.

I forced myself to look.

It was me, standing in the hall closet, stacks of photos in my hands.

Taken from behind.



I didn’t leave the house.

I know how that sounds. I know every survival instinct should’ve had me sprinting down the street and never looking back.

But it felt like I’d already stepped too deep into someone else’s game. Like if I turned my back on the house now, something would crawl out of it and follow me.

Instead, I called Lily.

“Hey,” she answered, voice casual. “You alive?”

“I need you to come over,” I said. I hated how thin and brittle my voice sounded.

“You okay?”

“No.”

She didn’t ask more questions. “On my way.”

While I waited, I sat on the couch, the security feeds open on my phone, the Polaroid camera sitting on the coffee table between us like a third party in the conversation I wasn’t having.

Five minutes passed. Ten. Fifteen.

“Where are you?” I texted.

She didn’t answer.

Instead, I got a notification from the security app: **FRONT DOOR MOTION DETECTED.**

I switched to the live feed.

The porch was empty.

No Lily. No one.

My heart hammered.

Another notification: **HALLWAY MOTION DETECTED.**

The hallway camera feed clicked on.

The hallway was empty too.

The timestamp was live, the seconds ticking forward.

“Stop it,” I whispered, like I could scold the house into behaving.

My phone buzzed in my hand. New text from Lily: **Sorry, traffic’s insane, ten more minutes.**

A shutter sound made me flinch.

The Polaroid camera whirred.

My breath caught in my throat as it spat out a fresh square.

I didn’t touch it at first. I just watched the pale rectangle slowly darken, colors seeping in like blood through gauze.

When the image finally solidified, I almost dropped it.

It wasn’t the living room. It wasn’t me.

It was the front porch.

Taken from inside the house, through the peephole window in the door. I recognized the distorted ring of glass, the warped view of the street.

Lily was standing on the porch, one hand lifted mid-knock, her head turning as if she’d just heard something behind her.

The photo was taken from behind her shoulder.

I stared at the timestamp in the corner. My uncle had always loved writing on his Polaroids in that tiny, neat handwriting. The date on this one was scrawled in the border.

It was today.

Ten minutes from now.



I don’t remember making the decision. One moment I was staring at the photo; the next I was moving.

I put the Polaroid face-down on the coffee table. I grabbed my car keys and my phone. I dialed Lily as I shoved my feet into my shoes.

She picked up on the second ring. “Hey, I’m almost—”

“Don’t come to the house,” I said, already halfway down the hallway. “I’m leaving, I’ll meet you at the diner on Maple, okay? Right now. Just go there. Please, Lily, I’m serious.”

There was a pause. “Okay. Okay, yeah. You’re freaking me out a little.”

“I’ll explain everything there,” I said, and hung up before she could ask more questions.

I didn’t look at the security cameras. I didn’t look back down the hallway. I opened the front door and stepped out into the afternoon sun like I was surfacing from deep water.

Nothing grabbed me. Nothing whispered in my ear.

The air outside felt thin and too bright.

I locked the door behind me out of habit, sat in my car, and just… breathed.

I started the engine.

My phone buzzed with a notification.

Out of reflex, I glanced at the screen.

**New photo detected on Device: Hallway Cam.**

Against my better judgment, I opened the app.

The hallway feed snapped into view.

The door I’d just closed was there. The empty entry table. The closet door, shut.

And in the center of the hallway, just at the edge of the camera’s range, there was a shape.

Not a trick of shadows. Not a glitch.

Something tall. Bent at the waist in an impossible angle, like it was folding itself to fit inside the narrow hall. Its limbs were long and thin, hands resting on the floorboards like a person getting ready to crawl. Its head brushed the ceiling.

The frame froze.

The app crashed.

My phone went back to the home screen.

My reflection stared back at me from the black glass, pale and wide-eyed.

Something moved in the back seat.

Just a slight shift. The creak of old fabric.

I didn’t turn around.

I put the car in drive.

I backed out of the driveway, hands shaking so hard I could barely keep the wheel straight.

As I pulled onto the street, my phone buzzed again.

A text from an unknown number.

No message. Just a photo.

I opened it.

It was me, sitting in the car in front of the house, hands on the steering wheel, head turned slightly toward the phone.

Taken from behind.



I’m writing this from a motel two towns over.

Lily’s okay. We met at the diner. She thinks I’ve had some sort of breakdown. Maybe she’s right.

I told her some of it, the parts that sound the least insane. She made me promise to call a therapist. I promised. I don’t know if I’ll keep that promise.

The house is sitting there, empty, with all my stuff still inside. My uncle’s boxes. The shoeboxes of Polaroids. The camera.

I thought about calling a priest. A paranormal show. Burning it to the ground.

Instead, I just keep refreshing my phone.

Every few hours, another photo comes in from that unknown number.

Me at the gas station, putting the nozzle back.  
Me walking into the motel lobby.  
Me sitting on the bed, typing on my laptop.

Always taken from behind.

I checked the number once. No caller ID. No record.

It just says: **POLAROID**.

I don’t know who’s sending them.

I don’t know how far this game goes.

I only know one thing with absolute, cold certainty:

Wherever I go, I’m not the one holding the camera anymore
