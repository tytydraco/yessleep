Deep in the provinces, hidden beneath a canopy of towering trees and the illusions of peace, lies a little town called Pilar. To the outsider, it’s a picture of serenity, shimmering lakes that catch the sun like glass, hills draped in green, and wooden houses that creak softly in the breeze. But the silence here is thick, unnatural, like a breath held for way too long. The kind that comes before a scream.

Pilar is not what it seems. It’s a place that wears beauty like a mask, stretched thin over something feral and rotting underneath. I grew up in this town. Pilar is where I learned that some roots grow deeper than trees, and some things buried never stay dead. It’s where I lost my sister. Where the land itself seemed to open its maw and consumed her whole. And it’s where my family was gutted from the inside out, one savage piece at a time.

I have told the story about what happened to my sister, Joanne (See part 1: [My Hometown was a Paradise that Consumed my Family](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1k0n9r3/my_hometown_was_a_paradise_that_consumed_my_family/)). How it tore our family into shreds, sucking the soul out of our household, like marrow from bone.  But there was something else that happened after. Something worse. And for years I tried to forget it. But some memories, they rot slow. They fester. This is about Raffy.

Raffy was my best friend growing up in Pilar. We were inseparable, the kind of friends who made dumb rules for our own made-up games and got in trouble for laughing in class. When Joanne was taken, he was the only one who didn’t treat me like I was cursed. Everyone else looked at me like I was next, like whatever darkness had snatched my sister might still be clinging to my skin, like an unwanted musk. Like there was a dark storm cloud always hanging over my head, and nobody wanted to be a part of it.

But not Raffy. He never flinched, never buckled. He would gladly sink under the deluge of darkness with me without hesitation. He was always there, care-free and gleeful. He kept showing up. Like we didn’t live in a world where monsters lurked.

Every afternoon after class, like clockwork, he’d be there, wearing a cheeky smile. “Come on!,” he’d say, already halfway up the hill to our hut, “we’re not done playing yet, man. Catch up!” There we would play a game of hide-and-seek, just us two. In a small village, there are only few hiding spots a kid could think of, and you’ll quickly learn to know all of them. His favorite spot never changed.

Without fail, he’d hide under our house. See, our floor was made of thin bamboo slats, so I’d always see flashes of his body curled up in the dirt beneath as soon as I enter our home, his knees pulled to his chest, fingers covering his mouth to stifle giggles. I would play into it, of course, sometimes playfully roping my mother into the game. “Hey, Ma. Have you seen Raffy?” I would ask between chuckles.

I’d press my ear to the floor and he’d whisper, “I’m not down here,”and I would whisper back, “Alrighty then, guess I’d have to look elsewhere.” then we’d laugh. We did this almost every day of the week. Even when the rest of Pilar seemed to fall quieter. Losing Joanne carved something out of me, a chunk of my soul ripped clean, never to grow back. I walked around hollow, like some vital part of me had been scooped out and left to rot. But Raffy, what we had, what he gave me without even trying, it almost filled that void. Almost.

If I’d known what was coming for him, if I’d seen the signs, heard the warnings, if I could have done something. Maybe none of it would’ve happened. But I didn’t. And now all I have left is the echo of his laughter and this gnawing guilt that won’t let go. I’m sorry, Raf. God, I’m so sorry.

Things changed when death and misfortune began to drip into Raffy’s household. It was slow at first, like a leak no one noticed, until it turned into a flood.

It began with his mother. People said she was initially seen at dawn, wandering barefoot through the public market long before the vendors arrived, before even the roosters crowed. She walked in slow, deliberate circles, her eyes unfocused, staring through people as if they weren’t there. Her mouth never stopped moving. She was whispering something, chanting, but no one could make sense of it. Someone said it sounded like Latin, but no one in Pilar spoke Latin. Not even the TVs in town had Latin-speaking channels.

The next day, she came back. At the same hour. Same circles. Same whispers. But this time her hands were raw, nails chewed down , palms scraped and bleeding, like she’d been clawing at something only she could see. Then came the marks. It was only scratches first, shallow lines across her forearms, jagged and fresh. Then deeper wounds. Gashes along her collarbone and neck, like something had tried to peel her skin off, or like she was trying to claw something out. She kept saying it was the bugs. “They live under it,” she told a neighbor in a moment of lucidity, staring at the patch of skin just above her elbow. “They’re under my skin. I can feel their little legs, their claws. I can hear them moving.”

Their family tried to keep it quiet, hide this from the rest of the world. Raffy’s father stopped going to work. His face grew darker, an anguished wrath slowly boiling within him. There were rumors he tried to tie her to the bed at night, and lock her in a room just to keep her from scratching herself bloody in her sleep. But still, the wounds got worse. Raffy’s sister showed signs of a shared psychosis. She started walking behind their mother, silently mimicking the circles in the dirt, lips moving like she was learning the strange tongue by heart.

At some point, the shame started to weigh heavier than the grief. Some nights, Raffy would show up at my door with a busted lip or a bruise blooming purple beneath his eye. He would smile like nothing was wrong, like it didn’t hurt to laugh. But his smile wouldn’t reach his eyes. I knew the sound of rage echoing through thin walls, even from kilometers away.

I knew what it meant when a kid flinched at sudden movement. Grief has a messed up way it twists people. Sometimes it makes them cry. Sometimes it makes them violent. And somehow, Raffy had ended up on the wrong side of the grieving hands of his father. I never asked. He never told. But we both knew the truth, and we carried it in a shared silence.

A few days after the first whispers slithered through town, Raffy’s mother disappeared. They eventually found her near the edge of the lake. Well, what was left of her, anyway. Bloated and gray, tangled in water lilies like the lake itself had tried to keep her. She was almost unrecognizable. Her skin had turned the color of old burnt wax, fingers curled like claws, and her mouth was frozen wide open, a scream caught mid-escape. The town chief called it suicide. He stood at the town square, voice flat and sure, claiming it was fear or madness, or maybe both that drove her into the water.

But the whispers started almost immediately. They said she’d been touched. That something from the woods had crept into the crevices of her brain, curled up inside, and began to rot her mind from within.

Some accused Raffy’s father. Said grief makes men cruel, and maybe he’d finally gone too far. I couldn’t blame them. He had fury in his blood. I’ve seen how he made his rage known on Raffy’s face. A grotesque painting of fury.  But deep down, in the pit of my gut where instinct lives, I knew it wasn’t him. It was something older. Something watching.

Raffy wasn’t the same after his mother died. He still came around, but the spark in him was gone. He used to race me home after school, laughing so hard we’d literally be panting when we arrived, but now he walked, quiet, like his legs grew heavier. He didn’t want to play in the afternoons anymore. Just sat there, picking at the dirt, watery eyes fixed on the ground like he was trying to see through it. I wanted to reach him. I really did. But I didn’t know how.

That last week, Raffy’s sister started standing at the edge of the public market every night, staring up at the mango tree. She wouldn’t say anything. Just stood there barefoot, eyes glassy, mouth moving like she was whispering to someone only she could see. Every night the town patrol would fetch her, take her home, and scold their father for letting such a young child wander out into the dead of the night.

His sister then stopped showing up to school. His father, enraged and grief-stricken, would search endlessly, day and night for her. They eventually found her hanging from the old mango tree beside the public market, swaying gently above the muddy ground like a broken puppet. At first, people didn’t even realize what they were looking at. Just a shape, draped in morning mist, hidden in the maze of tangled leaves and branches. Then someone screamed. The rope, it wasn’t rope at all, it was her hair. Twisted and coiled into a thick braid, black and glistening, looped around her throat with impossible tension. Long strands had come loose, catching the breeze like spider silk, brushing softly against the leaves as if the tree itself was trying to hush the horror.

When the villagers finally cut her down, the braid didn’t unravel. It clung to her neck like it had grown there, sunken deep into the skin. They had to pry it away. And when they did, it peeled back layers of flesh with it. Her head lolled at an angle so sharp, it looked like the hair had tried to saw it clean off. There was no warning. Just that grim, silent offering in the middle of town, something so obscene it turned every child away from mangoes for months.

I didn’t see Raffy for a few days. I knew he would not be at their house, after all that’s happened to him. He grieved quietly, choosing to bear the duties of our world than sulk and rot by himself. One early evening, I saw him tending to their carabao. “Hey Raf.” I called. “I hadn’t seen you in a while man, are you okay?” “Tired” he muttered in monotone. There was an awkward silence between us. A shared grief.

I beckoned him to get out of the fields, so I can accompany him home. We walked up to his house, silently bonding. I’d gone with Raffy to check on the house, thinking maybe his father had locked himself in, grieving. When we opened their front door, something thick and wrong hit us almost immediately, like the air itself had rotted. A putrid, musky smell dominated the house. It was dim, the curtains drawn.

Pale moonlight peeked through the windows as the breeze gently swayed the curtains. But then that’s when we saw his father sprawled across the floor, naked and collapsed in a heap like discarded cloth. His skin was pale and puckered, peeled off in long strips like wet paper.

It looked like something had tried to hollow him out, split him open from the back and scoop his entrails until he was empty, but had given up halfway, as though it couldn’t figure out how to wear him properly. A wave of nausea overtook me, my legs turning into poles of jelly. A tingling sensation of fear claiming my spine, a whisper of darkness creeping into my mind.

Raffy didn’t scream. He just stared, anchored to the ground. Terror and anguish froze him for a moment. He started trembling violently, like something within him had broken completely. Before I succumbed to fear, I knew that at this very moment, I had to save what little innocence my only friend had. So I grabbed him and pulled him outside. His knees buckled. Collapsing into the ground.

I didn’t know how but he managed to cry without tears pouring from his eyes, just loud and painful gasps for air, like a fish out of water. We stayed outside their house for what felt like hours on end until the village authorities arrived and took us away.

We didn’t talk about it. After that, no one in Pilar spoke to Raffy. I came to the realization that he now shared the dark cloud that once loomed over me, only his was way larger. Looking back at it now, I was the lucky one among the two of us. I still had my parents, and I still had him.

Raffy moved to his distant uncle’s hut only a few houses down from ours. He came to my house a few nights later, eyes dull, the bags under his eyes dark and heavy. It looked like he had not slept in days. “They come to me at night,” he whispered. “They scratch the walls. They knock at my door.  They whisper from under the floor.” “What are you talking about, Raf?” I asked uncomfortably. “ They say my skin fits. That it’ll fit better than the last one.”

I wanted to laugh it off, but his hands trembled. Something in him twitched when he stood still for too long. I tried comforting him the best way I could. It felt as if he was about to crumble, to break down.

Then he was gone. Disappeared. No one searched for him. The village just locked their doors and muttered hollow prayers. Two nights later, I lay on the floor of our hut, crying in deep broken sobs. Grieving the loss of my one and only friend in the world. He was my last light, the last glimmer. An ember of a childhood that was already blackened on its edges, snuffed out. The one person who did not see a curse, or a freak. He only saw me as his friend.

That’s when I heard it, a gentle, drawn-out “Shhh.” My blood turned to ice. A frigid feeling strikes down my spine. I turned my head toward the bamboo slats. From the dark beneath the floorboards, a voice slithered up, close as breath: “I’m down here.” I stopped sleeping on the floor. Stopped walking barefoot. I whispered prayers before entering the house, even though I didn’t believe in anything anymore. Some nights, when it was quiet enough, I could hear the scrape of nails, the wet slide of something shifting beneath the bamboo. And sometimes, a laugh. Soft. Childlike.

I stayed in Pilar for a few more years. Long enough to finish high school. Long enough to watch my father die in his sleep during a thunderstorm, and long enough to watch my mother waste away quietly, staring at the floor as though something beneath it was speaking only to her. She never said it, but I think she heard it too. After she passed, the house felt too loud with silence. Too full of eyes I couldn’t see. I stopped going into my room. Slept on the fields. Ate outside.

I was the only one left, and somehow, I felt more watched than ever. So I left. Didn’t pack much, and didn’t look back. Just walked away from the house no matter how each step became heavier.

But I still dream about it. I still feel it sometimes, when the night gets too muted, and the skies are too inky. The creak of wood. The whisper of dirt shifting. The pull of something that’s never really let go of me.

And now, decades later, I’ve made the mistake of coming back. I didn’t imagine it would take away more from me. It was calling for me.
