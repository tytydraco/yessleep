500 miles from home, 500 miles from family and friends. Still 500 miles to go. Was it really worth it for a work trip? I made good money, yeah, but why do I specifically need to go to a conference in San Antonio. After I wrapped up that thought, I put out my cigarette, and entered the gas station. I grabbed some chips, gum and a coffee. I went up to the counter and got ready to check out.

>Cashier: "Hi! Find everything you need?"

>Me: "Uh, yeah, at least to get me through tonight."

She started ringing up my items

>Cashier: "You from around here?"

>Me: "No, I'm from out of town, Iowa, actually. I'm going to San Antonio for a business thing."

She handed me my receipt

>Cashier: "Just a word of advice, this town gets a bit abnormal at night. I wouldn't recommend driving until morning."

I grabbed my stuff and thanked her for the advice, but I'd be fine. As I exited the gas station, I realized how dark it was outside. I looked at my watch, and it was 10 minutes before 11. As I looked up, I swear I saw a person disappear into the dark of night. I shrugged it off, got in my car, and started my drive.

I lit up a cigarette and turned up the radio station I was listening to. I saw it again, that same guy, except I got a weird feeling. He was watching me from the side of the road,

I turned onto a long dirt road, and it was supposed to lead me to the freeway. After 10 minutes, I started to get confused. I glanced at my GPS, and it showed my car not moving. I sighed, just what I needed a damn broken GPS. I turned around, but another 5 minutes went by, and the surroundings never changed. I started to freak out a bit, but after a minute, I managed to calm myself down somewhat. What was weird though was there wasn't anything but forest and road. No wildlife, either.

"There's no way, I got lost on a fucking straight road," I thought. Then it appeared. I saw it first in my rearview mirror, A human like figure with long lanky arms, large void like eyes, with no mouth. It somehow stayed with my car, even though it's not moving. Almost like it is teleporting towards me. Its gaze made me look away, but it kept appearing in my head. The radio turned to static, and then I had to turn it off, after the screams started blaring through.

The figure, or entity, or whatever was still behind me. I was hoping to come across some kind of civilization, but I still had yet to see anything else but road, and the darkness of night. 2 hours went by, and I was starting to get tired. I was afraid to stop, because of that thing behind me. I tried to turn back on the radio again, but that was a mistake.

The screaming continued through, and I turned it off again. I started to cry, I was shaking and terrifies, I almost swerved off into darkness and I had to try to somewhat compose myself. I heard breathing in the backseat, and my blood ran ice-cold. I looked in my rearview mirror, nothing.I then realized, that thing behind me, must be fucking with me somehow.

I felt it watching me, analyzing even my tiniest movements I made. It's still in my head, I try and try, but I can't block it out. It's etched into my memory, probably for as long as I live. I still have yet to see civilization.

My eyes drew heavy, but I fought to keep them open. I drank the rest of my coffee and kept as much alertness as I could. That thing still trailing me

I decided to give that thing a name from now on. Might as well, since just calling it "that thing" gets kinda confusing. It will be referred to as "The tall stalker", from now on. The tall stalker, appeared in front of me. It tried to run me off the road, and I damn near did. I don't think it can get me if my car is moving. I thought about driving off-road, but there's too much risk I'd crash. There's a forest on both sides of the road.

I've been using voice to text to document my situation. Hopefully I can find a way out, if not my last resort is hoping someone somehow finds this, and posts it. If that happens, it is too late for me. My watch said 6 am, but nothing in my scenery changed. I noticed my car's tank.... was almost empty. "Shit, shit, shit" I thought. I glanced at the tall stalker in the rearview mirror, even though it had no mouth, I could tell it was happy. I couldn't stop shaking.

I should have taken that cashiers advise, did she know? How could she know? How could anyone? This feels like a nightmare, but I'm awake. I know I am. I heard the breathing in my backseat again, this time I didn't pay attention to it, and I think it got angry. It tried to run me off the road again, this time putting my brother in the middle of the road. I swerved, and nearly spun out.

My life flashed before my eyes. I knew I would never see my family or friends again. My town, or anything for that matter. All that has been my life for 7 hours is a road of complete darkness. I started to feel hopeless, and I started to accept everything. As scared as I was, what could I do?

The car started to slow down. Then it came to a complete stop, and I looked in my rearview mirror. The tall stalker was getting closer. Almost like it was taking its time, It seemingly confident I wouldn't escape. I'm going to try to make a run for it, maybe I can get out of this hell.
