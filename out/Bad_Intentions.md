Back in the 2000s, I walked home every night. No ride, no wheels. And I lived in the suburbs.

Every night at 7 p.m., I passed Robert Mills’ house—white vinyl siding, pewter asphalt shingles, and beige curtains drawn close, except for a narrow slit. By this time, the Mills family was already settled upstairs—husband, wife, and their 11-year-old daughter, Doreen. Each night, my eyes drifted, without thinking, to the gentle fluttering of that gap. It wasn’t spying. All I ever saw through the slit was a dimly lit oaken dining room stretching down a carpeted hallway to the kitchen.

But tonight was different.

The scraping of my soles against the asphalt stopped. I furrowed my brow and stood in silence.

Through the curtain’s narrow slit, I saw the silhouette of a child peeking out—looking straight at me. The thin gap revealed only one eye at a time, and I thought the child might have been smiling. From thirty feet away, I couldn’t tell if it was Doreen or someone else. Hell, I wasn’t even sure if it was a boy or a girl. Something about it unsettled me. I stepped closer, crossing the walkway. But halfway across, the child turned and disappeared.

My shoes made no sound as I climbed the steps and peered through the sidelight.

I looked inside. No one.

Just when I was about to leave, the wooden stairs inside rumbled with loud footsteps, like Roman war drums—possibly beaten by another curious middle-aged man.

Ah, shit. No point in running. That would only make it look worse, wouldn’t it? The front door made a couple of hasty clicks, followed by a sharp creak. It was the man of the house—neatly combed, mustached Robert in a checkered shirt—squinting at me with doubt, though he tucked it well under polite restraint.

“You, uh—need something, Mike? Saw you from upstairs, through the hallway.”

I answered quickly, trying not to look like a deer in the headlights.

“Oh, hey Robert. I thought I saw a kid by the window. It was, um, standing there, then took off.”

He turned and glanced into his ivory-and-oak home. Any kid knew better than to play hide-and-seek in a dining room too carefully arranged with fancy china and family photos.

“You saw… Doreen?”

“I don’t know. It was a kid.”

“Doreen’s upstairs, Mike.”

I swallowed dryly. “I just thought I saw a kid—came to let you know, that’s all.”

Robert paused, studying me. I looked away. Then he spoke in a firmer tone.

“Look, I’m sorry about what happened to Billy. You must be tired, Mike. Walking back from Costco every night. Get a car.”

“Yeah. I will.”

“Go home, Mike.”

The door slammed shut. A couple of locks clicked. Then footsteps fading away.

The next night, I left work a little late. By the time I passed Robert’s house, it was around 8:10 p.m. After yesterday’s embarrassment, I promised myself I’d go straight home. Old habits die hard. My eyes drifted again to the gap in the curtain.

I stiffened like a corpse. It was that kid again. The curtains had parted slightly wider than usual, revealing only a third of the child—who I now figured was a boy.

It wasn’t Billy. Nor Doreen.

It was a pale boy in overalls and a striped sweater, waving and smiling at me. His face was pressed against the glass, though most of it remained hidden behind the curtain. I knew I wasn’t dreaming. I quietly crossed the front porch, glancing up at the second-floor windows to make sure Robert wasn’t watching. Halfway across, the boy turned and vanished again.

The house was already dark. I fumbled for my phone, turned on the flashlight, and shone it through the sidelight. The white beam swept across the kitchen.

No luck.

Or bad luck, I should say—because Robert leaned backward in the kitchen doorway and stared straight at me.

Motherfucker… he was in the kitchen.

Ah, shit. Here we go. Here comes the rum-thump-thumping. Any second now… no chance for me.

“Mike? What the hell are you doing here?”

“Robert… look, I saw that same kid in the window. Not Billy. But it’s a boy.”

“Again, Mike? Why are you out here so late? Are you trynna break in?”

“Robert, I—I wouldn’t!” I furrowed my brows. His accusation stung.

“Mike, if I catch you again on my front porch, I’m gonna have to call the cops.”

Once again, the door slammed, the locks clicked, and then came the final clank of the sliding bolt.

The next night, I got off work on time. I told myself, *Nope. I’ll just hurry home.*

It was 7 p.m., and Robert was already staring out of Doreen’s bedroom window, his hands perched on the sill, watching me like a hawk.

Against my will, my gaze dropped to the fluttering curtain downstairs. My blood ran cold. I tried to move, but my legs stiffened like logs. I nearly fell.

The curtain had parted, revealing half the boy—rocking on his toes, clapping, and laughing like tomorrow promised an exciting trip. The other half remained hidden behind the fabric, though its fluttering teased glimpses now and then. From a distance, I could just barely make out the other side of his face.

It looked horribly crushed, as if he’d been in a violent car crash. His lips stretched into a wide, lipless cavern filled with crooked, disordered teeth, where a beastly tongue lay coiled inside. His skin had turned pitch black, like the wet asphalt beneath my feet—dull, without glint or shine. He looked as if he’d been terribly smashed—yet there he stood, laughing merrily.

“Don’t even think about it,” Robert’s frown seemed to say.

I went back home and fell asleep. A grotesque pageant of nightmares paraded through the rest of my night. The boy’s face—now bald and corpse-like—flashed in and out of the absolute darkness surrounding me. His skin was the color of spoiled milk, tinged with celadon rot, and his garnet eyes gleamed like bloodied stones buried in meat.

Beams of light shot from my eyes like car headlights, jittering with every blink. My mouth hung open, jaw locked in a silent scream. Every time I tried to speak, only the shrill blare of horns came out as I scuttled on all fours along an endless stretch of asphalt.

When I finally woke, the gainsboro sky nudged me with hints of dawn. Through my window, I saw Robert’s Equinox parked in the driveway. No sun. No sign of the boy at the curtains—or anywhere else. The Mills were loading bag after bag into the SUV for what looked like a long weekend trip.

The car doors were still open. The lady of the house sat in the front passenger seat, and Doreen was in the back, glued to her phone. Just as Robert was about to close the front door, the boy ducked his forearm and burst out—and how hideous he was! I finally saw his full body.

The side that had been hidden behind the curtain all this time looked like the aftermath of the worst car crash and burn injury combined. He limped, dragging his charred half toward the car as fast as he could. The leg on that blackened side was snapped and torn apart, the ankle scraping along the asphalt—yet I had never seen a child look so happy. Or, more curiously, excited.

The only time I’d seen a boy this thrilled was when he’d been told he was going to a PlayPlace.

His eyes locked onto the passenger seat next to Doreen, and with a final lurch, he hurled himself into it like a touchdown.

Nobody—nobody at all—noticed the child.

Not Robert, closing the door.

Not his wife, checking on Doreen.

Not even Doreen—right beside him.

As Robert settled into the driver’s seat and shut the door, the boy perched in the back seat, smiling as he looked at me through the rear window.

That was the last I ever saw of him—and of Robert’s family—as the Equinox drove off toward the interstate.

Years passed. I got a new job. I finally saved enough for a car.

But for the last decade, every single day, I’ve checked the back seat—just in case a limping boy tried to climb in.

Sometimes, I still walk home.

No matter how far.
