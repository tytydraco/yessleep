I'm a park ranger. I patrol the national forests of Kentucky. Today, I was called onto the scene. A valley, deep outside public trails, barely touched. Helicopter thought they saw an unmarked camp, so they sent me out on the ground. The scene was a bloodbath. Streaks of it, all over the ground. The bears started swarming soon after. This was recent. Looking around, I eventually found a notebook. Blood splatter all over, but still legible. I read the last entry as I walked around the camp. I have edited out several of the random asides and drug use, but I can't keep this inside anymore. I need someone to know.  
December 13th:  
I was in between houses. I guess that's a good way to put it. The job market had dried up in my little town, and when you're 3 months late on rent, you can understand why the landlord decides to show you the door.   
I never thought backpacking would be the answer, and I suppose it really isn't in the dead of winter, but here i was. All of my remaining possetions were on my back, and the national forest seemed as good a place as any to try and settle down. Up the side of a mountain, through an untouched forest, and 15 miles later, I found myself at the clearing. The ring of trees circled the valley, a small lake nestled in the middle. I thought this was it.  
I setup my home base, and through a few lines out. A few trout obliged my hooks, and with that, I had enough for the night. That night, the fire warmed my soul just enough, and the fire roasted fish filled my stomach. At this point in my life, it's the best I could've asked for.   
December 18th  
Then I saw the shadow. I first saw him a few days in. Breaking through the edge of the forest, beyond the lake, the dark figure just stood. I waved, expecting it to be another camper in a situation like mine, but it never moved. The corners of my vision had been failing me for many years, so I suspected it was a trick of the light. Whenever I wandered over there, it was gone. I'm in my 50's so I didn't think much of it. Maybe my body was taking much longer to adjust to the mountain air.   
December 20th  
He showed up in my camp. I was starting my fire for the day, the and as the ember grew to a blaze, I saw him sitting aross from me. I thought he might be trying to say hello, but the complete and utter stillness this thing had was unnerving. I yelled at him to get out of here, and he was gone. Whether I was insane in the mountain air, or something more sinister was afoot. I was never a strong believer in the supernatural, after all.  
The next day, I made my trek around the lake and through the woods, following the shadow man. No sign of him. I walked into the brush, cracking my way through a dense mesh of briar, or something close to it. I pushed through until I reached another, higher clearing. something felt wrong, though. The trees stopped growing, almost in a perfect circle, and in the center, a door.   
It wasn't a house door, closer to the wrought iron sides of a tank, shrouded in a deep layer of concrete, but poking out among the dead foliage surrounding it. I felt something, a twinge. My breathing had become long and wet. I chalked it up to the hike. I probably hit some alergen on the way up.   
A breeze washed through the valley, and I looked up at the door as it swung open, the shade sitting atop. That was it, I had to. I was in to this and I was going to see it through til the end. I shouldn't have gone down that hall. I don't know if it would've helped.  
December 21st  
I checked out the hall, but it was dark. Long staircase went down into the earth, and it was pitch black. I hooked up a lantern after dinner. Today, I'm going in.  
December 22nd.  
I've been trying to use the light I have to explore down there. I haven't seen the shade, though I guess he wouldn't look like much of anything down there. Man, I should have reapplied sunscreen. I am burning up out here. I'll try to stay out of the sun today. Won't have much of a problem with that. I went deep, down spiked hallways like nothing ive ever seen. The signs are kinda eerie, with symbols and stuff between english. Basic keep out stuff I'd expect to see on any cattle ranch in town.   
December 23rd  
I coughed up blood last night. I'm not feeling terrible, but I just have this terrible burn. I needed to go back, and I did. Further this time, I used a line hooked up to the door to lead me back, and I went all in. Nothing but dirt and more dirt. At the end of the halll, theres a little metal ball. I tried to touch it, but it was pretty hot. Must be one of those flukes. I'll come back tomorrow.  
December 24th  
Christmas Eve. What a joke. God gave me nothing, and we expect to worship that? No, I'm going in again. Last night, I woke up in excruciating pain in my hands. The skin had started to peel, and I saw bruising all over. This felt like more of a burn.   
December 25th  
My body is decaying. I woke up again. Hell, I didn't sleep. I felt a pain in my right index finger. My hand, it just went on instinct. I grabbed my finger, and like a wet sock, the blood squelched and my fingernail laid in my hand, blood dripping from the wound. I wrapped it up up in a bandage. I don't think I feel pain after that. The way I see it, I'm dying regardless. I might as well get that thing while I'm at it. This is my last message. If you find this, leave. You don't want this. I aint coming out of that cave. Learn from me.  
  
The final journal entry looked barely scrawled, penned ina  deep crimson tone. His blood had soaked through the last lines. He wrote what was on the walls. I knew I shouldn't. But I have to. I walked to the clearing, up through the briars, and I saw it. The door was there, the shade sitting on top. It was real. Part of me thought the old man had gone crazy, but I saw that thing as clear as day, or as clear as a shadow can be. I walked into the room, down the hallway, and saw it. A pool of blood. No, it was a man. Bones stuck out. Muscles fused, and the ungulating mass that used to be the man laid there, barely even human anymore.  
I turned my flashlight around, glanced at the page. The light had highlighted the pen ink under the blood. I read it, matching the text to the spattered english on the walls.  
This place is a message... pay attention to it.  
Sending this message was important to us. We considered ourselves to be a powerful culture.  
This place is not a place of hoor. No highly esteemed deed is commemorated here. Nothing valued in here.  
What is here is dangerous and repulsive. This is a message about danger.  
The danger is unleased only if you substantially disturb this place physically. this place is bessed shunned and left uninhabited.  
  
Something struck me about those lines. I had heard them somewherer before, but I couldn't put my finger on it. That changed, however, when I saw the symbol. The pinwheel, three prongs, emenating from a center.  
I ran. By the time I got back to the car, I was already covered in blisters, my face feeling the most intense burn it ever felt. I've been around forest fires, and that didn't feel like anything compared to this.  
When I got into town, I collapsed on the wheel. Doctor says I have a week left. I know I'm not gonna make it a day. Cancer.   
I don't know if this message is a goodbye. I don't know if I have the stomach to tie the rope, but I need to leave the world with something, anything. You don't need to explore those empty clearings in the mountains. They kill slow, but they kill all the same.
