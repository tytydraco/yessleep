Well that was the stupidest thing I’ve ever done. The wine and candy bar were poisoned, to put it simply. Almost immediately after I consumed some of both a searing pain started in my stomach. Blinding, disorienting shock-waves rolled through my bowels. I struggled to dial 9-1-1. Thankfully, they were at my apartment in less than ten minutes. I fought to stay conscious as the paramedics lifted me onto the gurney and I choked out my words to try to explain the situation. “W-wine…Poison…Ca…Candy t-too.” I groaned and reeled from the agony in my abdomen.



I blacked out and woke up in a hospital with a breathing tube under my nose. My throat was sore and dry. My stomach stung, but far less than the immense pain I felt in my apartment. The smell of sterilization and medical gloves was palpable. I felt a hand touch mine and I looked to my left. My older brother stood there with concern on his face. “Thank god you’re awake!”



“Ugh…How long have I been out?” I croaked with my raspy voice and rubbed my throat.



“Several hours. It’s the afternoon now. They had to pump your stomach, Aaron. What the hell did you eat?” He said, sternly. He always acted like another parent to me. Especially after mom left. Dad needed a lot of help. Then he died and it was just me and Ethan.



“It’s hard to explain, but some wine and candy.” I sat up in my bed, holding my stomach and wincing.



“That’s it? They said you had arsenic poisoning! Who gave you the wine and candy?” Ethan raised his voice a couple notches and a nurse popped her head in.



“Oh! You’re awake. Great! I’ll get to the doctor.” She chirped and dashed away in her blue scrubs.



Ethan and I were quiet for a moment, the television in the top corner of the room played an episode of The Price is Right. I rolled my eyes and leaned my head back when another set of footsteps came into the room. The doctor approached, checked my vitals, and asked me a bunch of probing questions. I couldn’t tell him about the game show or my pantry. They would certainly keep me for psych evaluation. No, instead I lied and said it was a gift from a friend who I verified would have no intention of poisoning me. In fact, that friend re-gifted them to me as a housewarming and couldn’t remember who gave it to them. There was no friend, of course. I didn’t have many after college. Everyone went their own way. The same could be said for any high school friends. It really was just me and Ethan.



The doctor finally looked satisfied and chalked it up to a freak accident. He discharged me with the knowledge that I had minor damage to my stomach lining and to lay off solid food for at least a day. Ethan offered for me to stay at his place for a few days while I heal and I called into work so I could relax, but how could I? I’m fucking pissed. That freakish host, whoever she is, with her freakish game show is going to explain or I’m going to drag her out myself. Then what? Jesus, I couldn’t call the cops. This is insane, I thought. No one can see or hear the game show. It only appears when I’m alone. So, I would have to deal with her alone. God help me. What a useless decision that was.



Let me just reassert that this game show is real. The host is real and I have another witness. Not a human witness, but someone else went in with me. After Ethan and I ate dinner--him a sandwich and some cold soup for me--he got me setup in the guest room and went to his room for the rest of the night. His tuxedo cat, Gatsby, snuck into my room at some point and startled me when he pounced on my bed. “Oh, hi little guy. Come to keep me company?” I pet him and he arched into my hand as he purred.



That’s when lights glowed from underneath the closet door and muffled fanfare called through the thick wood and paint. Gatsby’s ears perked up and he stared toward the door with me. “You can see it too?” I gawked. He was the first to hop off the bed and sniff at the space between the door and the carpet. I sighed, throwing the bed sheets off me, and pulling my pants back on. I was about to open the door when I thought to put my shoes on too and grab a steak knife from the kitchen. When I returned Gatsby still meowed and pawed at the closet. “Alright. Ready, buddy?” I stared down at him and he meowed at me. I’d like to think he did so to reassure me.



I opened the closet door and crossed the threshold. I was first met with a strange odor. Earthy, wet, and metallic in nature. The ground was no longer painted concrete, but plain dirt. Half the audience seating was unchanged, but the other half was wooden stumps and topiary bushes shaped like seats. The podium and main stage were unchanged save for the supports the lights hung from. Thick, strong branches extended from the darkness above us, but I could not see the tree they originated from. 



“What the hell?” I gasped, my throat still sore from the hospital.



“Aaron!” A male sounding voice boomed over a microphone. “Welcome back to Risk! Or! Reward! Did you enjoy your prizes from our last episodes?” The unseen audience cheered except this time a chorus of birds and forest mammals could be heard alongside the human cheers.



“What do you mean? You poisoned me! I nearly died. And didn’t you look--” I stared into his eyes. His handsome gaze and relentless smile coiled around my mind, choking it from forming a solid thought. “Wait, what was I doing again? Gatsby, we should--” I looked down at my side, but Gatsby was gone. I returned my sights to the host. He caressed Gatsby who had found his way over to the host’s podium and curled up, purring as happily as he did in bed with me a moment ago.



“Come, Aaron. Step up to the podium and complete your next request!” His boisterous bravado echoed into the vast void surrounding us and I was compelled to move forward. I couldn’t remember what I was going to do, but my stomach and throat hurt. Was this a game show? How did I get here? The dashing man in front of me wore an expensive, dark green suit. He must be the host. I carefully cleared my throat, rubbing it, and speaking into my mic. “Sure! I’ll play.”



“That’s the spirit! Nothing can keep you down, Aaron! Reveal his next request please!” The host gestured and the lights caught his gold plated name tag that read, “Lugh”. The red curtains slid aside and in place of the televisions was a white screen with a request projected onto it. A projector I hadn’t noticed beamed its image down from one of the support branches. “Donate two ounces of blood! That should be a simple task with that knife in your pocket. Will you claim your reward or walk away and risk it all? The choice is yours, Aaron!”



A knife? I reached into my pocket and wrapped my hand around a plastic handle. I pulled it up to my face. It was a steak knife. How did that get in my pocket? Did I grab it before or did he somehow sneak it on me?



The ground moaned and shook. A small sinkhole formed in the center of the stage. Tree roots extended coiled around a marble pillar. Atop the pillar was a glass measuring beaker. He wanted my blood? This was some fucked up game show or maybe I was dreaming? Either way, I needed to know what my prize would be. I walked over to the pillar, brought the knife to my palm, took a few deep breaths, and sliced. Sharp pain radiated through my hand and into my brain. “Ah! Fuck!” I tossed the knife aside and shakily squeezed my hand above the beaker measuring out two ounces of blood. 



“Wonderful! You have achieved your request and you deserve a reward! Show the man what he’s won!” The host clapped and Gatsby was startled, jumping off the podium and prancing toward me after stretching. The pillar retreated back into the earth only to arise a moment later with a small vial filled with a golden liquid that glowed brightly on its own. Under the stage lights it looked unmistakingly divine. “Go on! Drink and be well.” The host grinned, proud and unmoving. If there were any other emotions on his face, I could not read them. Even staring too long at his eyes overwhelmed me with mental fog and…infatuation?



I shook the fog out of my brain and used my other hand to retrieve the vial. I gently popped the little cork out of the neck, examined it for several seconds before downing its contents. It tasted like banana and honey crisp apples. Just then, I felt my cut hand start to itch. I looked down at it and watched as the blood clotted, tendons tightened, flesh connected, and smoothed out. Not even a scar was left behind. “How?” I breathed.



“Congratulations to our contestant! We’ll see you next time on RISK! OR! REWARD!” The host bellowed and clapped thunderously loud. I was once again cast in pitch black darkness. I felt around and found a cold metal knob, turning it. I stepped out of the guest room closet. That’s right. I thought. I was at my brother's house. Gatsby meowed and pounced back onto my bed, making biscuits on my sheets before sleepily curling into a ball.



A rolling headache started in the back of my skull suddenly. I clasped my head as I made my way to the restroom. I searched the medicine cabinet for pain killers, but dropped the bottle and its contents in the sink when the headache became too much. I sat on the ground as flashes of memories surged back into my mind. 



I was there before.



The host poisoned me with the wine and candy.



They looked and sounded different then the last times.



I was going to kill them, but I forgot. How? What the fuck was She? Or He? Or Them? Was I even dealing with something human? After a few minutes, the headache subsided and I stood to my feet. I captured my own gaze in the mirror. My nose was bleeding, but once I had rinsed off the blood and calmed down I noticed something. My throat no longer hurt and neither did my stomach. I cut my hand! I thought. I checked my palm and there was no sign of damage. Upon further inspection of my face I realized something that made my heart skip a beat. I was visibly younger. As if I was barely eighteen. Smoother skin, tired bags no longer forming under my eyes, and almost no facial stubble.



So now, here we are. I’m writing this from a park. I haven’t been able to sleep much the last couple of days and I’ve been avoiding any closets or pantries. So basically I've been sleeping in my car. I’m asking honestly, what the fuck do you all make of this? I know I’m not crazy…at least I hope I’m not. What am I supposed to do? Do I go back and play again or should I leave it alone? What if the next request is something worse? Something I can’t agree to? I can’t trust the host, obviously. So why did he heal me? I need to sleep on this.



My brother has been texting me several times a day and I tell him I’m fine, but he won’t let up. I can't tell him the truth. It wouldn’t amount to anything anyway. Oh great. There are lights and music coming from the service closet on the outside of the bathrooms. I’m putting my earbuds in to ignore it.
