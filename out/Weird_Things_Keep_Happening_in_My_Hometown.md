I'm bored af and between jobs rn so I'm just gonna start talking about weird shit that happens in my hometown.



When I was like 10 or 11 my dad went to buy a safe from a guy he met at a pawn shop. I didn’t have much to do that Saturday so I tagged along to help him load it into his truck. The man he was buying the safe from lived on the other side of town, just about out in the sticks. And when we saw the house, my dad started getting second thoughts about this whole thing. 



The place was a total dump, with a yard that hadn’t been mowed or water in ages and an old-ass muscle car left to rust in the front yard, and the porch was littered with plastic bins full of old toys and other shit. So we weaved through the narrow path through the mounds of water-damaged clutter to the door and gave the bell a ring. After hearing a muffled voice shout at someone, this big moon-faced kid answered the door. He looked to be in his late teens and I knew right away he wasn’t quite right. His eyes were far apart and he just stared at us for a second before the gears in his head started turning and he finally spoke.



“What’s up?”



My dad explained why we were here and the fat kid went back inside to get his dad; a tall, lanky guy in a faded Iron Maiden shirt and a thick pedo mustache. My dad talked with him for a bit and we were invited inside, and the interior of the house was even worse. If you’ve ever seen the show Hoarders, everywhere we looked, there were piles of old magazines and newspapers, hampers full of clothes, and those shitty appliances you see in those TV infomercials still in their boxes. We had to make our way through a narrow channel through all the junk, all the while trying not to let the everpresent stench of cigarette smoke and piss bother us. I heard a little dog bark at us but I never saw it.



When we reached the room with the safe, my dad was preoccupied enough for me to go exploring. Something about this place got my curiosity going, like a car crash. I went down the hall and into a room that looked like it might have belonged to a little kid once. There was an old pink crib full of old dolls in the corner and there was a little shelf full of kid’s books and old toys next to it. I was picking through some of the more interesting looking junk when I saw it. There was this little shoebox hidden in the very back of the top shelf, and being the curious little shit I was, I had to open it.



Inside was this little dried out husk wrapped in layer after layer of plastic. It took me a while to register what exactly I was looking at: It was a very young, mummified baby of all fucking things. It was tiny, probably premature, and curled up like it was sleeping. Its skin was leathery and brown and didn’t really stink as much as I’d have expected. Its little arms and legs were so thin and delicate I was afraid I was going to fuck up and break it. So for a while I just held the fucking thing in a state of shock, like my brain was trying its absolute hardest to convince me it was fake, just a doll or a prop or anything that wasn’t an actual dead baby in this disgusting house.



I put the thing back in the box and went back to my dad, we loaded the safe up in the back of his truck and we got the hell out of there. He and I talked for a bit about how nasty the place was when I realized something. While we were on the way out, I glanced in the mirror and I saw that fat kid who greeted us standing on the porch, glaring at me.



Did he know? I have never told my dad what I found.
