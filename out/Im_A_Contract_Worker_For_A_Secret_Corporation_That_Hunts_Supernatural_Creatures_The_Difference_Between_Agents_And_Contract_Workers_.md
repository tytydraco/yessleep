For once, I picked up a job that had no risk of getting eaten. It was a task no one wanted; therefore, it took a few days to complete. I spent nearly a week going through reports and paperwork in the office because I had a basic enough grasp of the common language supernatural creatures used to read the nonsense reports they filed. A great deal of outdated and useless reports were burned that week.   

I’ll admit, I did waste some time texting Ito and April instead of working as hard as I should have. Ito was fairly busy with real jobs so I couldn’t talk to him as much as I wanted. I was committed to properly asking him out. It needed to be in person though. My stomach sank when he asked if we could talk about something important the next time, we saw each other. My brain swam with what that could possibly mean. Not a lot of those ideas were overly positive.  

After the job was finished, I planned on relaxing for the rest of the day. All that paperwork hurt my eyes and wrist. Before I was able to leave, I was stopped by a person I would have liked to avoid.   

“Are you busy?” Lupa asked when he spotted me in the office hallway.  

Damn it. He must have been waiting for me. If I lied, he would know. I was stuck in this conversation.  

“Do you need something from me?” I asked a bit weary of him.  

“Have you ever considered becoming an Agent?” He said as if that was a normal question.  

Those words held a great deal of weight behind them. Not just anyone could become an Agent, certainly not a human. I’ve only heard of one or two humans being one. The rest worked in the office or did other duties for The Corporation. I have heard of humans being partners with Agents; however, they were acting more for emotional support instead of fighting monsters.   

“I think it's a bit out of my league.” I admitted.  

“I’m not certain of that. You have dealt with world-ending issues before and made it out alive.” Lupa pointed out.   

His smile wasn’t as charming as he thought it was. Yes, I had lived through a lot of nasty things working as a Contract Worker. The scariest situation I’ve ever found myself in was an Agent's daily life. I don’t think I could handle dealing with a world-ending threat every single day regardless of how well it paid. It wasn’t just world-ending threats. It went beyond that. The stronger Agents could be expected to deal with creatures that went beyond Eldritch Gods. The creatures I’ve come across were like ants compared to the real threats that were out there.  

“I was just lucky.” I shrugged hoping he would get the hint.  

“I think you have some talent. I think you’re suited for this, however the choice is not just u to myself. I require at least one more office supervisor to sign off before I officially offer the job. If that happens, we’ll give you a good signing bonus. I hear you have a debt. We can clear that for you.”  

His tone was overly sweet, and it got on my nerves. I bet if I took out a loan with The Corporation, I might be able to pay off my debt faster. I hated that idea. I was suffering because of the money I owed. The debt from medical costs after the botched job that killed my partner. I’m still here while she isn’t. Paying back the debt shouldn’t be easy for me.   

“I’ll keep the offer in mind.” I said and started to walk around him.  

His phone beeped and I thought he was distracted enough to let me go. Instead, he called out to get my attention.  

“Since you’re free I may have a job for you. You have worked with Agent Ito before, correct? It appears he and a few others are having difficulties at the moment.”  

My heart skipped a beat, and I spun on my heel.  

“Where are they?” I asked ready to run off to help.  

Lupa grinned and I hated how well I’d been played. If I did well on a job Agents struggled with, it gave others a reason to offer an Agent job. If I died today, then it just meant he used up a resource. Overall, I didn’t care about the games he was playing. I just cared about keeping Ito safe.   

Within the next two minutes, I had a short sword in my hand as I pushed past an injured Agent going through an open doorway. I might as well have walked into Hell itself.  

The air was so heavy and vile that it felt like walking into a wall. I nearly got sick seconds after stepping through the door. I lost my balance for a moment, my mind reeling from so many sensations at once. The floor felt soft and hard to walk on. Dark blue and purple light flicked distorting how the room appeared. It was as if the space was made up of sheets of flesh sown together, stuff with who knew what to make pillows and blankets. I forced myself to focus on the important facts of the situation.  

This had been a summoning attempt, or someone had tried to rip a hole between worlds. A word written in different languages was stitched into the fleshy walls and floors. Each word leaked pure dark magic that made my stomach turn. That word was one of the keys that fueled a possible rip appearing within the next few seconds. It was also providing power to the reason why the Agents were having so many issues.  

Large creatures stalked around, deformed yet powerful. One swipe of the stitched-together claws easily knocked an Agent aside. No matter how many times the creatures were cut down, they reformed ready to attack once more.   

Because all the Agents weren’t human, the vile air affected them more. Most could barely stand up in this space let alone fight. The air was knocked out of my lungs when my eyes landed on a lifeless body dressed in a suit. More than one Agent had already lost their life here. I scanned the faces of the ones who were still standing and understood why.  

All of them were either half-breeds or on the weaker side. This job required someone as strong as Lupa. And yet, the people here were only twice as strong as a human. Without a powerful ally, they were sent here to die. Rage in the pit of my stomach boiled over as I pushed aside the fear to try and do what I could to save the ones who were still fighting.  

A terrible sound rippled through the air. One I knew far too well. A rip between worlds started to form. We needed to destroy what was creating this spell and direct the foul magic before the tear became too large to handle.   

Next to where the tear had started was a person wrapped in a bundle of blankets. They weren’t dead but their eyes remained closed with all the activity around them. It stressed out my eyes, but I saw all the threads of magic leading to them. We either needed to remove all the words filled with magic, or what? Kill this person? No, maybe we just needed to ruin the text written in blood across their forehead.   

Sloth.   

I didn’t have a chance to get closer or warn anyone what was going to happen next. The tear opened; a blast of power shot across the room knocking everyone off their feet. It felt like everything happened in slow motion. I hadn’t hit the ground when I spotted Ito falling, his face cracked, and a distraught expression when he realized I was there.  

Another bout of power hit and it forced everyone to the ground so hard I thought I   

died. I was lucky. The full force didn’t reach the doorway. I forced my head up; my vision swam for a few seconds. Then dread filled my chest. The creatures and Agents who had been nearest to the tear had been crushed by the second blast.  

Time froze when my eyes landed on Ito. He was on his back, hand weakly raised, and half his face was missing. Cracked away leaving a dark empty hole behind. For a moment, I didn’t see him. I saw my old partner cold on the ground. Mentally I was back in a memory of two years ago. Broken, bloody, missing my legs. A scream started in my chest. Panic almost took over. I only didn’t break because I saw a flicker of magic within Ito’s chest. He was still alive. We both were.  

I shot to my feet and raced over to him. His body acted on reflex. His threads went to the rip trying to close it. I grabbed a hold of them pulling with all my weight feeling them cut into my hands. The tear closed an inch. We just weren’t strong enough to do much.  

Something came out of the rip between worlds. A pitch-black hand. After everything I’ve seen in my life, that human arm was the thing that shook me the most.  

Every living thing had magic. Even if it was the slightest flicker so small you may not even consider it was there. Each creature’s magic looks slightly different based on colors or the flow. This thing, whatever it was... I couldn’t explain it. The hand had power, but it was not magic as I knew it. The vile magic leaking from the stitched words was absorbed by the hand, turning it into something else I’d never seen before. Something that shouldn’t exist.  

And that hand was connected to something. If that full person, no creature, came through could anyone stop it? What power it held was so different I wasn’t sure if magic could harm it.   

I almost gave up. All hope quickly left my body. My sanity remained hanging by a single thread.  

I found myself looking down at Ito knowing if he didn’t get out of here within the next few minutes he would die. When I realized that I didn’t care what new horrors I faced. I refused to lose another person I loved.  

But how the hell could we get out of this? It was like a nightmare.  

Something clicked in my brain. I had a stupid idea. Oddly enough, I felt like it might work out.  

Some worlds are so dangerous that the ways to reach them are hidden behind complex rituals with strange requirements. It's to ensure someone messing around with magic can’t accidentally open a gateway to somewhere they can’t handle. Accidents do happen but I doubt the tear we were currently dealing with was opened by accident. If I could figure out the requirements and mess with them it would stop the flow of magic fueling the tear.   

My hands burned in pain. Ito’s threads hand sliced into my palms. I let go to find my phone inside my coat pocket. My heart raced as I prayed this would work. Another burst of power started to gather in the air. With shaking fingers, I turned up the volume and raised my phone above my head. If that force came down again, we would all be done for.  

A blaring alarm came from my hand echoing through the small room.  

A few Agents turned their heads confused about what was going on.   

The person wrapped in blankets shifted. Their eyes slowly opened as they raised their head. With a snap, the magic flowing to the rip was cut off. It backfired within the stitched words causing small bursts of magic ripping apart the floor nearby. The tear suddenly closed as the hand disappeared.  

In a flash the gruesome material the room had been made of fell apart. The place shifted to an abandoned warehouse with a handful of people questioning what happened.  

I let my arm drop feeling exhausted even though I barely did anything. I wasted no time begging an Agent to help me with Ito. I grabbed him under his arms, my heart dropping when his internal magic flickered. The others around me were stronger and faster. They took him from me and hauled ass to get through the doorway and to get medical care for the injured.  

I was dragged along, my brain a mess. I didn’t even realize they thought I also needed help until I ended up in the medical area of the Corporation office building. A slime nurse carefully took my hands trying to wrap them. I refused and kept telling them to help anyone else before me.  

Four Agents died that day. More were on bed rest. To make matters worse, there had been another big event that was the reason why the stronger Agents hadn’t been available. Within minutes the medical area became bursting with activity. That was never a good thing. I found myself unable to sit down. I offered my help and refused to take no for an answer.   

The next few hours were a blur. My hands were quickly wrapped so I could help the nurses with the other injured. From holding people down so their wounds could be treated to rushing over supplies to the ones who needed them. I saw a man that looked like Dr. Fillow arrive. It must be his brother who also worked as a doctor. Even with his help, it felt like there was simply not enough medical staff.  

When things finally died down, the slime nurses thanked me then two needed to drag me out of the room. They demanded I get some rest. I knew I needed it and yet I just couldn’t. I felt too buzzed to even think straight.  

They told me Ito had been treated elsewhere and by some miracle, he was already up and moving around. He needed a new suit, so I headed towards the front office, pacing as I waited.  

For the most part, it was quiet for a few minutes. The secretary flipped through a magazine clearly annoyed by the person making noise in front of her desk. Another person came down the hall making me pause.  

He was tall and wore grey sweats that didn’t suit him. His long black hair was tied back showing off slightly pointed ears. My heart nearly skipped a beat seeing his beautiful face. Each feature was perfect as if had been sculpted.   

“Ito!” I gasped and met him halfway.  

He was shocked I recognized him but also shocked by my appearance.   

“Are you hurt?” He asked, and his voice was deeper than before.  

I glanced down seeing blood over my clothing from helping in the medical area.  

“Oh, it’s not mine.” I commented trying to shake off an odd feeling settling on my shoulders. “Hey, the last text you sent mentioned you wanted to talk in person.”  

I wanted to not talk about what we had just gone through. My chest started to hurt in a way I didn’t understand. Ito raised a perfect eyebrow wondering why I would bring something like that up.  

“Where you that worried about-”  

“Yes.” I cut in a little embarrassed.  

He shuffled on the spot almost a little uncomfortable.  

“I met August the other day. We talked a little about you and... Is there something between you two?” He asked unable to make eye contact.  

I had no idea why he would ever ask such a thing. My confused expression made him keep talking,  

“He said that once I was done with you, he called dibs.” Ito admitted.  

I almost laughed. It was a nice feeling after the stress of what we just went through.  

“He just wanted to eat my brain.” I told him with a smile.  

“Oh, that’s a relief.” Ito sighed but then appeared uncomfortable again. “He also said you prefer women. If my core isn’t damaged, I can be transferred between different doll bodies. I did start as female before we met. If you would like I could-”  

I raised a hand to cut him off and shook my head.  

“What kind of body are you comfortable in? I’m not picky you know. I liked your cute personality. The fact you’re attractive is just a bonus.”  

He nodded and smiled in a way that made me fall even harder for him if that was even possible.  

“I do like being tall...” He said in a shy voice.  

My first relationship was with a mimic type of creature. I was younger and it happened around the same time my mother got sick. Since it was such a rough patch of my life, I didn’t let myself remember much about it. I knew my first partner changed parts about themselves to make me happy. I foolishly didn’t notice right away. I knew I hurt that person back then and I was glad Ito wouldn’t be going down the same path. There was nothing wrong with making changes you think your partner would like, but it had to be what you also wanted.  

My eyes landed on his hand, and I felt an urge to hold it. His magic hadn’t fully recovered and yet I selfishly wanted us to leave and spend the night together. I was seconds away from asking him to make our relationship official when he spoke again, this time sounding serious.  

“I also wanted to ask something very important. If possible, I don’t want us to work on the same jobs.”  

The words felt like a slap in the face, but I tried my best not to show it. I opened my mouth however the words never came.  

“I’m glad you arrived today. It saved us. I also know how close I came to dying. I’ve accepted everything that comes with this job aside from one thing. I cannot let you watch me die.”  

The words hurt because I understood them. I still couldn’t even think of my old partner’s name. I loved her, and she was gone. Ito didn’t know about her; he didn’t need to. He understood how it would be if he died in front of me, or the other way around. I saved him today. Tomorrow might be different.  

I knew that I couldn’t ask him for a deeper relationship after his request. At least, not right now.   

I didn’t respond for a minute, my eyes directed to the ground as a mixture of feelings rattled in my chest.  

“I'm sorry...” Ito started.  

I shook my head giving him the best smile I was able.  

“You’re an Agent. I knew that from the start.”  

Those words were painful. It felt like everything hurt at that moment. Until he leaned down to kiss my forehead. That small action made things a tad bit better.  

“Go home and get some rest. I need to head to the furnace to charge my magic a bit. I’ll text you late, alright?”  

I needed to change out of my dirty clothing. My hands started to tremble from a sudden coldness. Ito collected a new set of suits from the front desk. He refused to leave until I headed home first.   

My apartment felt too cold. And too silent. I felt dead tired and yet, I just couldn’t stay still. After quickly changing I grabbed a basket beside the front door and then headed outside. I had an urge to just keep moving.  

For the next hour, I spent in a dark park collecting trash. I didn’t care about the money at the moment.   

“Mr. Richmond?”  

A small voice pulled me from my thoughts. I suddenly realized how cold it was, and I hadn’t grabbed a jacket. The person who called for me wore a bundle of clothing with a fancy new wagon behind them.  

“Oh, you’re the trash collector,” I said and walked over. “Sorry, I never caught your name.”  

We haven’t spoken to each other since the hoarder's house. August had got him a new wagon which he used to collect trash. I wondered what he was doing in a park near where I lived.  

“Al.” He sounded a little bit shy.  

“Nice to see you again Allie.” I smiled hoping the nickname was all alright. “Have you been doing, ok?”   

He nodded, a slight blush on his face as he fidgeted with his clothing.  

“I was hoping to see you again. I haven’t been able to pay you back for helping me yet.”   

I’d forgotten all about that. I was never expecting to be paid back. I was glad that we arrived on time to save this small creature. I knew if I didn’t accept something from him, it would upset the poor thing.  

“You know that Agent who helped us? He gets magic from the fire you fuel with the trash you collect. He’s a friend of mine and got hurt today. Can we clean up the park together tonight?” I offered.  

His face lit up glad to accept that offer. It was a good deal. I had some company, and he could easily repay me. The strange shaky feeling I had in my chest went on the back burner as we worked into the night. Al appeared tired. Instead of letting him force himself to keep going, I said we should take a break. I asked if he needed a key to get home, but he shook his head saying he could just find a spot in the park for the night.  

I hated the idea that Al didn’t have a place to stay. I couldn’t let him sleep outside. He crumbled under peer pressure and followed me home. I wanted to warm up in a shower instead I let him take a bath. Since Al was small, my tub was a perfect size for him. I cooked some instant noodles. It wasn’t much but Al appreciated it. I’ve never been homeless, but I’ve been close. A hot meal, a safe place to sleep, and getting clean was something everyone needed. Before letting Al go to sleep, I let him take a spare key to my place. He wanted to refuse but I told him knowing he had a place to go at night would fully pay back whatever he owed me.  

Finally, I started the shower. My body hurt, I was tired as hell and my hands almost stopped working. Then, something else happened.  

My knees gave out. I felt too damn cold, then hot. It felt let a set of powerful hands were pressing down on my shoulders. My lungs refused to take in air. By some miracle, I made it to the toilet to empty my stomach. Tears started as tremors wracked my body. I didn’t know what was wrong.  

Images of my old partner then Ito’s cracked face flashed behind my eyes.  Was I having a heart attack? It felt like it. I left my cell phone outside the washroom. I wanted to call someone for help but who? I didn’t want to bother anyone. I simply couldn’t.  

My body curled into itself. After a long while, I calmed down enough to have a single terrible thought to clearly come through.  

What was the point?  

I bit down hard on the side of my mouth feeling bitter I let those words appear in my head. And I hated myself even more as I kept thinking.  

What was the point of all of this?   

My partner died two years ago. Ito nearly died today. August may lose the son he loved because Lucas was human. April lost her family and home because of humans' greed. My mother wanted more children. She could barely take care of me due to her work. Once you interact with supernatural creatures, that is it. It was nearly impossible to get away from this life.  

What was the point of humans and monsters being close?  

A pain came up from my bad leg. My head buzzed with terrible thoughts. Unaware of my actions, I started to dig my fingers into my flesh.  

A knock came to the door. It creaked open with a small figure peeking inside.  

“I need to pee.” Allie said in a small voice.  

The pain in my leg slowly faded. Guilt washed over me. Providing a safe space for someone like Al was the point of all of this. I don’t know what came over me.   

“Yeah, sorry.” I tried to stand up and yet my legs refused to work.  

“I can wait.” He said and turned away for a second. “It’s ok to have bad days.” He added.  

Deep down I knew that. And yet I wasn’t sure if I could forgive myself for some of the thoughts I just had. With some effort, I stood up and let Al use the washroom. After a shower, I finally collapsed in bed after a very, very long day.   

Al was already curled up inside his wagon asleep. He was so small and yet he worked hard every day against the same thoughts I struggled with. I wanted to be able to keep things together as well as he did.  

Right now, getting some rest is the most important thing I could do. I couldn’t help others if I kept pushing myself. A dull pain came from my hip again. It was hard to sleep no matter how much I wanted to. I’ll have to get it looked at shortly.  No matter how much I wanted to call Ito, I held back. He needed some distance if I had any hope of having a real relationship with him in the future.
