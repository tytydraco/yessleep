\*\*Summary\*\*

Mary, a young girl from the small, bleak town of Girdwood, Alaska, recounts the most horrifying experience of her life in a written monologue. She begins by describing her town as a cold, lifeless place where opportunities were scarce, and the winters, though harsh, brought some semblance of normalcy during the Christmas season. Her family, like many others, struggled financially, but her parents always managed to make Christmas special. However, the events of December 2006 would change Mary’s life forever.

Mary’s 13th birthday, on December 12th, was a modest affair. Her parents saved enough money to host a small gathering with pizza, drinks, and a cake. Mary spent the evening playing Mortal Kombat 3 on her old SNES with her friends, a console she frequently shared with her older brother Kevin. Kevin, a rock music enthusiast with a rebellious streak, had a tough exterior but was deeply caring. Tragically, this would be the last birthday Kevin would celebrate with her.

Later that night, Mary found Kevin’s lifeless body in the basement. His corpse bore gory scratches that no human could have made, and the police were unable to identify the culprit. Rumors spread quickly in their small town, with some attributing his death to supernatural causes like Krampus. Overwhelmed with grief, Mary withdrew from her usual activities, struggling to cope with the loss.

As Christmas approached, her father attempted to lift her spirits by promising her a PlayStation 3, though it was clear they could not afford such an extravagant gift. Mary resigned herself to another quiet Christmas until she woke on Christmas night to find a PS3 under the tree. Thrilled, she played Marvel: Ultimate Alliance on the console into the early hours of the morning, finding a moment of happiness for the first time since Kevin’s death.

But the joy was short-lived. A power outage forced her to venture into the basement to restore the electricity. Nervously, she descended into the dark, foreboding space, only to encounter a shocking sight: Santa Claus, sitting on an old mattress, his red suit soaked in blood, his eyes glowing ominously.

Terrified, Mary could barely whisper his name. Santa turned to her with a sinister smirk and acknowledged her Christmas letter, in which she jokingly wrote that she would trade her brother Kevin for a PS3. Santa revealed that he had granted her wish, gifting her the console in exchange for her brother. Horrified, Mary realized the gravity of her words and the eerie truth behind Kevin’s death.

Santa, in a chilling tone, reassured Mary that she would not meet the same fate as her brother but warned her to remember that she had brought this upon herself. He left through a hidden exit behind a bookshelf, bellowing a menacing "Ho Ho Ho!" as he disappeared.

Mary, traumatized, kept this encounter a secret for two years, knowing that no one would believe her. Even as she shares her story now, she expects skepticism, but she feels compelled to reveal the dark truth about the Christmas that changed her life FOREVER.
