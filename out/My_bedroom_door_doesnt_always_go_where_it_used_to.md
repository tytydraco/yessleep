Sometimes, my bedroom door doesn’t lead to the hallway. 

Usually, it does. On most nights, I can get out of bed, walk out the doorway, and go to the bathroom no problem. I can wake up, get dressed, and go to work without issue. Most of the time. 

But on March 2, 2011, I was rudely awakened by the howling of a pack of wolves that were prowling the forest outside my room. They didn’t come in, and I didn’t feel threatened by them, just … extremely confused. 

I smelled the sap of the trees and the rain-drenched dirt. I could feel the wind whipping between the branches and through the doorway. The wolves didn’t seem to notice me, and I blinked, rubbed my eyes groggily, and stared out into the hallway, dimly lit by the night light. 

I would have assumed I was dreaming or hallucinating were it not for the traces of damp dirt and leaves that had been carried into my bedroom by the wind. 

Anyway, it continued like that for a while. Some time in 2017, I got home after a long day at the office and trudged upstairs. I walked past the nightlight I’d long since outgrown and approached the doorway to my bedroom. The blazing sun beat down on me from the desert within. I sighed and went back downstairs. It had become passé at this point. I knew my room would come back eventually, so I just went to sleep on the couch. 

Sometimes it was worse than others. There was one night early in 2019 that I nearly drowned as my door suddenly led to the bottom of the sea. A torrent of briny water rushed in and swept me out of my bed. I heard sparks and shattering glass as the waves crashed over my nightstand, and I was barely able to take a deep breath before going under. Up was down, left was right - everything was chaos. 

And then I was back on the floor of my bedroom, peeling kelp and a starfish off my sopping forehead like some cartoon character. I couldn’t help but laugh at the absurdity. 

It went on like this for years. Every so often, my doorway just became some sort of portal to somewhere else. I was almost never in any sort of danger, and I never mapped out any sort of pattern to the timing or locations, so all I could do was hunker down and let it pass. It rarely lasted more than a few minutes. 

But last week, all of that changed. I was fast asleep, when suddenly an agonized scream pierced the air. I jumped to my feet in a cold sweat. I’d never heard anything like that before. 

My eyes slowly, hesitantly panned over to the doorway. I expected to see a mental asylum or triage operating room or something. Instead, what greeted my gaze was a vast, grey, craggy plain suspended over an abyss of blood red stars. Periodically, a star began to vibrate rapidly, then fold in on itself, emitting yet another impossibly pained scream. In its place was pure, inky blackness before eventually, this canvas of unreality appeared to “bleed” a new star into existence. 

With some trepidation, I stepped toward the doorway. I had no idea what this place was, but I felt it calling to me. 

Are you familiar with the “call of the void”? It’s a phenomenon where people standing over cliffs, balconies and the like suddenly feel an urge to jump, even if they’re not remotely suicidal, sometimes followed by an intense sense of panic and remorse. This felt similar - I had no desire to enter this hellish abyss, but I also felt myself inexorably drawn toward the entryway. I couldn’t stop my legs from walking closer and closer. My ears began to ring with a bizarre chittering noise, indistinct whispers that, frighteningly, almost made sense. I felt the hairs on my arms stand up. It was cold - colder than I’d ever felt before. It almost seemed like whatever unseen force was drawing me into the abyss was pulling all warmth and light out of my room. 

I shivered, and took another unwilling step. 

As I approached the door, an arm shot up from below my field of view. An emaciated hand gripped the bottom of the doorway and clawed desperately for purchase. Its muscles flexed as it attempted to pull its unseen body up. 

I froze. I had no idea who or what this creature was. I didn’t know if it was human, if it meant me harm, if it was a victim or a perpetrator or -

And before I had a chance to even process that, the door returned to normal. My standard hallway was back. The only evidence of that hell was the creature’s severed fingers lying at my feet, the grizzly sight dimly lit by the night light that had become my anchor to reality. 

Every other time the doorway shifted, it went to somewhere easily identifiable. I don’t know what’s causing it, or where these areas physically are, but they logically make sense as a space on this earth. But that … that place was an impossible nightmare realm.

I’ve talked to scientists. Priests. Professors. Psychics. The crazy old guy who runs the “curiosities shop” on Grand. No one seems to have the foggiest what’s going on, or why the phenomenon is isolated to my bedroom door. Almost none of them believed me to begin with. 

All I know is that I’ve signed the papers to sell the house, and it’s slated for demolition. At first it was a relief, but then it hit me. 

What happens if the phenomenon occurs again after the doorway is reduced to rubble?
