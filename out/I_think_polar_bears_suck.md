"I think polar bears kind of suck", that was the last text my friend Alex sent me before he went missing around 1 year ago. I think I agree with him.

There isn't much to say about the day leading up to his disappearance. We were both normal 19 year olds living with our parents in Taylorsville, Utah. It was a place in Utah like many others, not necessarily a full-on suburbia, but also not some kind of city or small town. If anything it was just a subsect of Salt Lake City that had less tall buildings, less fun activities, and more homeless people. It was still a Utahn area however, and of course that meant there was a church around every corner, and religious zealots trying to sell you on how to get out of poverty. Neither of us were religious, not at all. I even spent my early childhood and teen years being likely one of the most edgy atheists imaginable, and probably an annoyance to everyone around me. Alex was one of the few people who actually fucked with that sort of speech, and we vibed together being this pair of douchebags. I still look back on those days with a hint of embarrassment, but also longing for those days to return.

The day he disappeared, there was a deep, foggy blizzard. The snow had that obnoxious thickness unlike any other. It was the type of blizzard containing the type of snow that you just immediately understood was going to be tragically ass when you try and shovel it up. I obviously wasn't the praying type, but on these days I did pray to whatever was out there to compel my neighbor to drive his snowblower up the street and just ride around the driveway and sidewalk so that I didn't have to expect the responsibility of cleaning it all up.

It was 8:20 PM when I received the text out of nowhere. "I think polar bears kinda suck." To be honest with you, this confused me at the time. It was entirely brought up out of nowhere and I had no idea what it meant. I didn't reply, but I did think about that message all day. To me, it just came across as some random thought he sent to me for shits and giggles, but admittedly I should have replied.

3 days later, still having not heard from him, I learned that he had gone missing and that he was reported as such not even an hour since he sent that message. His parents thought he was in his bedroom, he was not. His window was wide open, and all his belongings besides his phone were left behind. This even includes his jacket. I get he was 19 and all, but that was such extremely odd behavior that even I understand why his parents called the cops so fast. It didn't matter though. He was gone, not a trace remained, not even any evidence that he had left footprints at any point. He opened his window and vanished, all in the middle of a blizzard.

There were search parties patrolling the whole of Utah for weeks. Each day they got smaller and smaller, until it was only his parents searching for him. I hear they still search for him now, though I quit searching a long time ago. The following time was brutal, and I remember the confusion of the polar bear text eventually built up into a serious stress and anxiety disorder. At some point multiple hairs of mine even turned white. That messed me up unlike anything I had ever experienced. I can't even imagine the strain this put on his parents. Honestly, what a nightmare.

I showed the police the text and they put out a warning to Taylorsville and the surrounding areas about a loose polar bear. Of course, there was never any evidence of a polar bear attack or any sort of struggle, but I think they just did it as an excuse to get his parents off their backs. Anyway, of course there was never a polar bear found.

Now, why does any of this matter?

I am pretty confident I have found myself in the exact same situation that Alex found himself in 1 year ago. It's 8:20 PM December 4th. There's a similar obnoxious blizzard.

I woke up from a nap I took after I got home from work and went to go talk with my dad about politics. I couldn't find him, same with my mom, same with my brother. They were gone. I look outside, nothing. There isn't even the faint sound of someone driving in the distance. No sounds of wildlife, nothing. I look at my phone and mind you, it's been at least 5 minutes since I last looked at the time. It is still 8:20.

This creeped me out to no end, but I just decided that I couldn't panic, not in a situation like this. My critical brain just sort of took over, and I entered testing mode. At this point, it should be noted that I study both psychology and astrophysics via two different colleges through online classes. I also plan on studying philosophy. When I get what I need from these colleges, I'm going to move out of the United States with the goal of avoiding the debt I accrue from these classes. Is it a stupid idea? Yeah, but I think I know how to cheat the system. Anyway, over the next hour and a half, I quickly confirmed that what was happening was paranormal, because of this I did some tests.

1. I watched the snow fall and found that it does not rise, there's a certain level at around 10 inches from any surface where the snow just disappears.
2. I learned that I don't feel pain even after holding a small amount of snow in my hands for an extended period of time.
3. I learned that I still feel some pain, as when I kicked my shin up against my parent's coffee table in order to test if I'd feel any pain. I wished I didn't.
4. The sun is still up. Despite it being 8:20, it's still bright outside.
5. At that point I hadn't seen a polar bear yet.
6. The internet still works but calling or texting people seems finicky at best.

Eventually I decided to wander Taylorsville to observe more of this strange issue. This hoe is abandoned. There isn't a soul in sight. The exact Jerrymandered border of Taylorsville is a void, and it looks like I could walk off the area as if I was jumping off the top of a waterfall. I raided a couple houses and found nothing of note except for extremely phallic paintings and... structures all over the walls of one of them.

There was also a shotgun... the shotgun has heavy, rubber, male reproduction organs hanging off the barrel, but nonetheless it's still a shotgun. I'm not any sort of gun nut or anything but it's a double barrel shotgun that looks like it's straight out of Call of Duty. I've never fired a shotgun before, but I figured it would be my best defense against a polar bear. The rubber nuts also helped to stabilize my aim when I was pointing it at various furniture. I thought about test firing it but... come on, there was probably a polar bear roaming around somewhere. I have 4 bullets without a clue on how to actually load the thing, but after looking down the barrel with a flashlight I'm pretty confident it's locked and loaded. 

I wandered around Taylorsville until reaching the place where my old high school used to be. Instead what I found was a roughly mile wide perfectly flat circle, and directly in the center of that circle stands a polar bear on its hind legs, staring directly at me with its snout pointed at the ground. One of its paws raised up in the air above its head, as if it was waving at me. Upon stepping on the circle I could hear a faint angellic choir off somewhere in the distance. Before listening to what they had to sing about I stepped off the circle and the sound ceased.

I've been writing this post in a house just outside of the circle. I can see the polar bear from my window. It has not moved. I am pretty confident that thing is some kind of god and if I get too close to it it's gonna rapture my stupid ass. Thinking about what Alex would have done in this situation, I know he probably walked to it. I already know the result on what happened as a result of that event. Another reason as to why I don't want to get close is just  because in general polar bears fucking suck.

I've since been debating on what to do with the shotgun because after hearing that choir, I doubt a shotgun shell or two is going to hurt that thing, and if it does, it's a polar bear. I thought about shooting myself but seeing as I actually feel pain when it's sharp and concentrated, I don't think that would do any good. I've thought about jumping off the edge but there's too many unknowns in that situation, I'm gonna have to do a lot of tests on what may happen to objects thrown in the void. Surviving here in the cold with the constant 8:20 is also an option, but I don't know.

That's pretty much the main reason on why I would even make a reddit post in this situation hoping that it just goes through without issue. I want some feedback. What should I do in this situation? I'll answer any questions as soon as I can.
