My parents had me when they were very young. Like very young, right out of high school. When you're that age, I guess it feels like everything matters and your choices will last the rest of your life. I just wish they'd lasted more than a few years. It wasn't until I was much older that I realized just how much they were children, unprepared for their own children... but here we are.

Mom especially wasn't. I had no idea how much she struggled every single day, why she always looked tired and sick whenever I saw her. Why she breathed funny and never showed her teeth when she smiled. I used to be mad at her for being so absent from my life. But now I understand just how hard she tried. Every single day. 

And my Dad, to keep me sheltered from seeing her at her worst. He'd take me and my teddy bear Nellie on these long drives late at night with the windows down, and I'd fall asleep in the backseat to the rumbling of the truck and the cool fresh air to drain out the stuffy smoke from the apartment. He did that so often I had no clue when I woke up one day when I was 5 and it was morning and we were still driving. He had one hand on the wheel and the other holding his phone to his head. I looked out to the bed of the truck and saw bags of stuff, mine and his. But not hers.

I overheard the last thing he said over the phone. "I'm glad you think so... It's what's best for her. And you... We'll see you when you can... I love you too."

He tapped off the phone and tossed it onto the passenger seat. Catching a glimpse of me in the rear view mirror. He looked over his shoulder, with a smile that didn't quite reach his eyes.  I was always struck with just how blue his eyes always were, bright and shiny, but today they were as red as the flannel shirt he always wore, like he hadn't gotten a wink of sleep. And I guess he didn't. When he grinned, his sharp canines poked out from under his lips. Like a Papa Bear. "Hey Kit-Kat. How you feeling?"

I rubbed my crusty eyes and hugged Nellie. "I'm hungry."

"We'll stop somewhere soon. We've only got a couple more hours to go."

I looked out the window to see miles of fields of wheat, rolling in the wind like a golden sea. I'd never been here before. "Where are we going?"

"You know how Mommy and Daddy always said we wanted to move to a farm?"

I remember a kids' book they read me all the time, about a farm and all these animals like cows and horses and ducks, that my Dad would do the best voices for. They'd read and Dad said we'd have one of our own some day with all the animals; all the cows, the horses, the chickens, the pigs, and ducks. I always insisted there'd be ducks. They'd say we'd grow all the food we could eat and have everything we ever needed. A real home for just us three. And the kind of thing I couldn't help but believe at that age.

He continued, "Well, Daddy found one. Way out in the country, away from that big, noisy, stinky town. We got the farm, sweetie."

I was so happy, but something was missing. "Where's Mommy?"

It took him a second to answer. "You know Mommy's really sick..."

"She's always sick." I was annoyed. I didn't understand.

"Well, she's finally starting to get better. Really better, for real this time. She just needs some time to be with friends who can make her better. And when she's better, we'll all be at the farm together. How's that sound, Katie?"

"Sounds awesome!"

"Yeah, does it sound awesome?"

"Yeah!"

"Oh yeah!"

He'd say that a lot in a deep funny voice I never got was the Kool-Aid Man. It just always made me laugh, and when I did, I saw his face in the rear-view mirror. This time he smiled for real.

I spent the next two hours talking his ear off, asking him every single animal I knew of that would or wouldn't be there. I barely noticed we were stopping by the time I got to the last, most important one.

"Will there be a dragon at the farm?"

"No, we can't have a dragon at the farm, sweetie."

"Why not??"

"Cuz they'd burn all the crops, and they'd scare away all the horses and cows."

I was devastated. I asked quieter, "Could we have a little dragon...?"

He stopped and took the keys out of the ignition, leaning over ans back to me in his seat. Dead serious.

"I'll tell you what. You get to keep any little dragon you find at this farm. But! You gotta clean up all the fire, all the ash, all the dragon poop. Got it?"

He held out what I thought was the biggest hand in the world for me to shake. I held out a pinky.

"Deal?" I offered.

His eyes flared with genuine concern for a second before he smirked and hooked his massive pinky against mine. "Deal. Now let's get inside."

I jumped outside and looked around. The most overwhelming feeling I had was disappointment in this old, barren farmstead that clearly hadn't been lived in for years. An old gray house, a brown, faded barn, and no animals in sight. "Where are they?"

Dad walked around the truck and stooped down to meet my eyeline. "The animals'll be here. We just gotta grow the food for them first. Just like -- " he scooped me up and sat me on his arm, " -- I gotta whip something up for you."

I could never help to share in his smile. His front teeth were a bit crooked, like one was always fighting to get in front of the other, and their constant fight led to a chip on the inside of the front one. I know that wasn't how it happened, but that's what my imagination dictated. I never found out the real reason they were like that, if there was any.

I looked out to the field of short, brown stalks of what must've been corn. Long out of any farmer's care, left to the rats and crows and the cruel elements of summer. We had a lot of work ahead of us to make this place livable again, for the animals. And then I saw it.

Out in the middle of the field of dead crops, tied and suspended up on it's post. A lonely scarecrow.

I don't think I had ever seen a scarecrow in real life, outside of Wizard of Oz and happy story picture books of farms. Dad always said that when I'd grow up, I'd look just like Dorothy, like my mom did. I loved Scarecrow the best. This one looked nothing like him.

Its clothes were a pair of denim overalls and a green plaid shirt,  dusty and weathered from however long it was left there. The straw that stuffed its insides poked out of its shirt collar and sleeves, as well as tears in its chest where the crows had pecked away at it. In place of its right hand was a long, rusty sickle that curved out from its wrist like an oversized pirate's hook. But its head... its head was a half-carved jack-o-lantern, but the sharp, triangular cuts that made the face were green and molded and round as flies came and went. It looked soft like no pumpkin should, starting to droop and slump over its shoulders and chest. It looked sad. But what I remember most is the long orange strings of pulp and seeds hanging from the eyes and mouth.

I hated that scarecrow. I hated to look at it, but I hated more having my back to it. And whenever I couldn't help but to look and see where it was, it was even harder to look away. I asked Dad so many times to please get rid of it. He'd look down and shake his head and tell me how much it creeped him out too before saying, "Kit-Kat, when we have more corn than we know what to with, crows are gonna and try and steal it from us. Mister Scarecrow's there to scare the crows away. Do you understand?"

I'd nod and pretend I did, only to pester him again after however long he was at work on the land, fixing up the house or the barn. I can't imagine now how much was on his mind, but he had days and days of work to distract himself with. All I had was my thoughts, Nellie, a creepy old farmhouse with too many rooms, and that goddamn scarecrow.

There wasn't a single room in the house that didn't have a window, and my Dad said I could have any one of them I wanted for my own bedroom, even up to the loft. I insisted on the ground floor, the one right next to his. Looking back, I know the one concession I could've given him was a room of his own I didn't sneak into every night when I got scared. But even with Nellie, and Dad in the very next room, I was scared every night.

Every night, when the moon and the stars were shining bright, and my room was lit with a soft blue glow, I'd look out my window into the field, and I'd see the silhouette of that pumpkinheaded scarecrow swaying slowly on its post whichever way the wind blew, its long hookhand shining in the moonlight. Every time I'd look at that rotting thing, it seemed to look back, swiveling on its post as if to turn slowly to wherever I was.

I'd hold Nellie as close to me as I could, breathing in her softness, and eventually, as always, my racing mind would run out, and my exhaustion would win over my fear. I'd always wish that in the morning, it'd be gone, replaced with a nicer one or just gone for good. But it was always the first thing I saw when I'd wake up too.

For weeks, it was like that, before my Dad's handiwork really started to take shape. One afternoon, he placed a space heater on the wall opposite my bed. In the storeroom, he found stuff for pumpkin pie and served it as dessert alongside a ham and a big bowl of applesauce. He was wearing his typical jeans and red flannel but his whole air was different, how happy he was.

Finally, sitting down to eat, he smiled his wonderful, crooked smile. "Do you know what's special about today?"

I genuinely didn't know. I shook my head.

"You are six years old today! And what's more is you get to learn a new word..."

I leaned forward to hear him better across the dinner table, while also basking in the scent of the pie. He leaned forward too, resting his arms on the table just behind his plate. "'Equinox.'"

I repeated the word, wondering what it meant.

"It means, 'equal night,' and it's when the sun and moon have have the exact same amount of time in the sky, down to the second. It's when summer ends, and fall begins. And that's when you were born, Kit-Kat. So... what do you want for your birthday?"

"Where's Mom?"

I don't think he expected that. He took a deep breath and fidgeted his hands, and looked back at me, "Mom's okay. She's still with friends, still getting better."

"Can we call her?" 

"I'm sorry, sweetie, not right now. But I promise we'll see her soon."

He always said that whenever I asked. The answer never changed, no matter how closer "soon" got. He never told me what was wrong, why we never talked about her, why she couldn't call. I was just so mad, I pushed my plate away and grabbed Nellie and ran to my room.

"Katie!" I heard him yell out behind me.

I slammed the door and stayed in, curled into a ball with Nellie on my bed, holding her as close as I could, watching the sun go down. The light from the hallway and the creaks of the wood told me that Dad was just outside my room, leaning against the door on silence. It was like that for a few quiet minutes, before he finally left. In the dying light, I saw him go into the barn, doing whatever last working calls of the day, and for the last time, I fell asleep to the sight of that scarecrow, staring, swaying back and forth, arms and sickle outstretched across its post.

I woke up in a cold sweat from a nightmare I didn't remember, and the warm air emanating from the space heater. I could think or feel in that moment was how unbelievably dry my throat was. I touched my feet to the cold woodboards and zombie marched to the bathroom. At end of the long hallway, the TV in the living room was glowing with whatever show and I saw my Dad's jeans and boots slumped into the recliner. I drank from the faucet for as long as I felt I could, and wiped the cold water from my chin, walking back to my room. I opened the door, and there was my bed, Nellie saving my place to sleep, the window, the bright full moon,  the field, and an empty post.

What I felt was like lightning inside of me, waking me up. I rubbed my eyes and ran onto the bed, hands against the cold window pane, fogging it with my hysterical deep breaths. It was gone! The fields were empty, completely empty except that lone post, like a cross with twine of rope hanging from its arms. I grabbed Nellie and ran out of the room, out of the hall, to the living room. Dad was asleep in his chair as static played on the TV. I shook his body and screamed, "Daddy, the scarecrow! The scarecrow's gone!"

He jolted awake, eyes wide at my screams. My throat stung again with just how loud I was, and my eyes did too as I felt tears welling in them. He rocked forward in his chair, rubbing his eyes and his head. He was still barely awake as I kept tugging at his sleeve. "Katie... what?"

"The scarecrow," I struggled to croak out of my dry throat, "He's missing... he's awake."

He took a deep breath as he lowered his head, running his hand through his hair. "Did you have a bad dream?"

"Daddy...!"

He looked up at me, eyes big and soft and blue. He stared at me a moment, and he steadied my shaking body placing both his hands on both my shoulders. I could see how exhausted he was, like he was every day, but he smiled. And he said, "Okay," groaning, standing up from his chair.

I followed close behind, shivering, as he walked down the hall, out of the static TV light. His footsteps clacked on the wood and he looked over his shoulder at me, calmly reminding me, "Keep her close, alright?"

Nellie had to be the only thing holding me upright, along with Dad's words, his reassurance. I was waiting for the punchline, for him to remember that he took it down after I fell asleep, something like that. I felt just how cold the air really was, in my lungs, on my lips, on my skin under my flower pajamas.

The door to my bedroom creaked open with just a nudge from my Dad and he reached in for the lightswitch. And he froze.

The light didn't come on and there was no flick of the switch. I stood by the side in the dark hall as my father towered over me, looking through the doorway. His eyes were wide and fixed on what he saw, his breath came out in shallow shudders. His hand came away slowly, almost imperceptibly, and returned to his side, shaking. Slowly I heard his breaths get deeper, heavier, and I could recognize the fear in them. The wide whites of his eyes were like moons all their own as he inched his steps out of the doorway. I couldn't help but move little by little away from him too, and whatever he saw.

And then I heard it. A single, silent tap from the inside of the bedroom, like a stick tapping a window. And then a long, metallic scraping sound that reminded me of nails on a chalkboard.

Suddenly, Dad snapped out of whatever trance he was in, his paralysis shifting to immediate action as he dashed to the side, scooping me up in his massive arms and sprinting with me down the end of the hallway. No sooner than that did I hear the distinct smash of breaking glass from inside my room, and something heavy rolling in and crashing onto the floor.

"Keep your eyes closed, Kit-Kat!!" Dad yelled fast and loud into my ears as I bounced in his arms with every bounding step. "It's okay!"

An even louder, inhuman shriek sounded from inside the bedroom before I heard the door slam open. It sounded like screams, as much as it did winds and croaking like old wood.

I squeezed my eyes shut as the dull glow of the TV came and went in less than a second. I clutched as much to my Dad as I did to Nellie. I heard the panicked jangling of keys, and felt the cold autumn air on the back of my neck and the jumping down of porch steps from wood to gravel to tell me we were outside. I heard the unlocked clicking and opening of the car door and my Dad depositing me into the front seat over the console. All the while, I heard him loudly whispering, "Okay, okay, okay..."

It's easy to realize now he was as much trying to calm himself down as he was me, and in the safety of the car, I thought now was finally okay to open my eyes. I saw him, panicked, scared, in the open driver door, the overhead light from the truck shining down. He was halfway inside, just looking at me, taking one second to make sure I was okay.

He said as much, "You're okay."

I remember the look on his face, a moment of calm and respite, looking at me. He had the look he always got before he was about to smile. I remember that... and I remember a long, curved glint of light that shimmered over his head for less than a second, before the rusty blade of a sickle erupted from his chest. I'll never forget his screams of pain, as he leaned forward over the seat, his blood pouring down and off the tip of red-stained blade.

And I could see it behind him. Its rotting face. The straw falling from its long arms. It looked at me with its hollow eyes, and as my Dad struggled to hold himself upright, it turned and pulled, pulling him with it. Its movements stiff and awkward like a puppet on strings, the thing walked back toward the house, dragging my Dad on the gravel behind it. I couldn't move from where I was no matter how much I wanted to, to do something, to do anything. I heard him groan as the sickle at the end of a long stick arm dragged him back. With one leg, it cleared the porch steps, but my Dad used one hand to grab onto the railing. All of his last strength.

The scarecrow struggled for a moment to get him up, to move him, and with the last pull of sickle, I saw its head fall from its shoulders, smashing onto the deck. Then headless, it dragged my Dad the rest of the way in, closing the door behind it.

It felt like I was frozen in that carseat forever, but it was still hours before the sun came up. Hours I spent running, walking, crying down the only road out of that place. A girl in her pajamas, barefoot, walking for her life on a dirt road, clinging to her teddy bear. I wandered onto some access road some time before the sun started to rise, when a car slowed to a stop next to me. A man, a woman, two kids, and their dog. A family on a road trip.

They asked a bunch of questions I was too tired, too scared, too weak to answer. They took to the nearest town and I spent the next few nights in a police station where they asked me all the same questions. With time, I was able to answer some, and even ask a few. Police went to the farm, and came back saying they found nothing. No dad, no blood, no pumpkin.

They asked me who my mom was and what number they could call. Then it was a social worker, telling me about somewhere new. Three nights in a police station and twelve years in the foster system. My only next of kin was considered unfit, and that's never really changed. Neither have I, for that matter, except for the worse. Every August with the start of the school year, in a new town, in a new school, with a new family, I'd always freeze and scream and shout at the sight of any pumpkin, any scarecrow. I'd throw whatever I could at the TV when someone had on Wizard of Oz. I'd never go out on Halloween and always be the shut-in freak to my so-called "siblings." I'd be the problem child who'd never outgrown her teddy bear to my pretend "parents." All six of them.

I couldn't have been out of the house faster the day I turned 18. Two days before the fall equinox this year and about as long a drive from Dad's old farm. I found it. And I thought about going back myself for a long, long time. Find what they missed, what was right in front of their eyes. Find *something,* I don't know... Or find nothing at all.

I used to have my own room in the old apartment, but I'd always wake up in the middle of the night, scared of the sounds I'd hear, the shadows I'd see, even if it was nothing. I'd sneak out of my bedroom into Mom and Dad's to sleep between them, and feel safe. But when Mom got worse, when I'd start to cough and complain of the smell in there room, one night I snuck down the hall to their bedroom door and opened it to see my Dad, kneeling down on the other side, waiting for me. Fully awake, fully prepared for me.

"Hey Kit-Kat."

"Hi Daddy."

"Can't sleep?"

"I'm scared. There's monsters in there."

"Oh yeah..." his understanding always warmed me. "Is that why you come to sleep in Mommy and Daddy's bed?"

"You and Mommy don't get scared. Monsters are scared of you. They don't come when I'm with you."

Even in the low light, I remember seeing him nod, leaning forward. "You know, I have someone to keep you safe..."

I hadn’t even noticed his hands where behind his back, so I look down to see, or mostly feel, a soft, plush, stuffed teddy bear, half my size in his hands. "This is for you," he whispered, "I gave her that special power Mommy and I have to keep the monsters away. You keep her close and take her to your room... and you sleep."

"But what if the monsters come for you?"

I felt his hand in my hair before he pulled me into a hug, squishing my new bear between us. "Don't you worry about us... what're you gonna name her?"

"What's Mommy's name?"

Nellie's never left my side, no matter what. I always took her with me to every house, every school, every field trip we weren’t allowed to bring our dolls -- I brought Nellie. The numbers of fights I got into with all those other girls who tried to take her away from me... It's actually the reason I carry a knife now.

It's surprisingly easy to not give a shit about others, even guardians, telling you you're too old for that kinda thing. When you've lived a life like mine, you grow to learn that what others call "superstition," you call "reason."

That's especially true when you find yourself driving up the same gravel road you ran for your life down so many years ago. I have a truck now, like he did, and I like driving like he did. I even think about my mom when I light a cigarette on the way up. Despite that, I *hate* stopping at gas stations, and I always keep six cans tied down in the bed. Nellie rides passenger, belted like always.

Before I know it, I'm face to face with that old, gray house I spent those sleepless nights in. The land, as desolate as it was when I left. No one's here. No one's lived here in years, no thanks to the police. I park and step out, and zip Nellie up into a blue backpack I sling over my shoulders. How ugly, and abandoned, and cold this place is.

I walk up to the turnaround, the very spot he was killed, and dragged into the night. Remembering a moment, exactly as it happened and where, with no trace left behind on the pure white ground. It's like looking at a ghost. I walk the same path he was dragged through, up the old creaky steps. I look on the deck at where the scarecrow's head fell off. Nothing.

The door gives way with no effort at all, and the house is as empty as ever. But I feel the heaviness in the air. The sharp, cold sting that keeps me from taking one more step inside. Only one last thing. One last place I've yet to look.

I'd imagined the moment I'd see it again, over and over, in my dreams. Wondered if it'd found some other molding jack-o-lantern to wear as a head. If I'd see my Dad's dried blood on its sickle-hand. I turn around the back of the house, and I see it. Sure enough, a thing on its post. Almost.

You never forget something like that. The rotting smile and eyes bleeding with pumpkin guts. Its overalls and green shirt. But that isn't what I see, any of it.  A red shirt and blue jeans, covered in dust, weathered and tattered with time. Straw seeps out of a gash in the center of his chest. The head is a cross-stitched sack of thatch with the eyes and mouth sewn shut. And little brown hat sits on his downturned head. The closer I get, the more I see just how tall he is, stretched out on the post. Crows pecking at his ears and rubber nose fly away at my approach.

I look up to see him facing down, one head length over me as I look. And the more I look, the more I *feel* what happened. More than remember, I still hear his screams. And mine. And that monster's. But it wasn't the same now. I look at his leathery face, and the stitches across its mouth, as something in me forces me to stay, to look closer. Part of me knew, but I needed more. I reach into my pocket and flip open my knife. One arm grabs onto his soft shoulder while the small blade wrenches into the scarecrow's mouth. Through the thatch, through the stitch-string and straw, I cut.

The crows caw, and the sky darkens. My grip tightens and I cut more frantically, breathing heavier with every sawing motion I make. The dark inside the scarecrow's head starts to give way. A black widow spider crawls out from the corner of his mouth.  I cut. I don't know what I'm thinking, but there has to be something I know there is. 

The low rumble of distant thunder, cut. More crows, cut. The creaking of the post, cut!

With the last slice of my pocket knife across the straw, the scarecrow's mouth hangs open, and I see it. Teeth.

Two canines a bit sharper than usual, and two crooked front teeth, like they were fighting for each other's place. I knew. All along, I knew this, I feared this, woke up in the night screaming of this. All those years, I never wanted to believe it. But now I see. Now I know. And that's enough.

Today's the day. The equinox. Whatever's special about this day, whatever makes it happen, it'll happen again tonight. Or rather, it would've. As the storm from miles away slowly rolls in, I split three cans evenly between the house and the field, and I watch it all burn. I remember that space heater my Dad put in my room for me, and I think of him. The sun hasn't set yet, and I see the rising flames start to crawl and spread along the four corners of that post, engulfing what's on it.

Then I finally put that place behind me. On the open road, I look in the rear-view mirror to see the black clouds of smoke rise in the sky, as if begging for the coming rain. I'm shaking now and I don't really know what to say.

I guess... I guess this has all been for you, Daddy. You loved me. And you saved me. And I miss you. I miss you so much...

And I pray to God that maybe I saved you too.
