Abel Fryst was dead. But now there was a new KrowdFundMe campaign called “Payback” with a goal of $782,000—the exact amount he’d been cheated out of.

I didn’t sleep the rest of the night. The next morning I showed the others the Payback KrowdFundMe. Somebody must know what we did. That meant one of the five of us must have told someone. My friends started to accuse each other. 

“Enough,” said Emily, “I’m done with all this. I want my share of the money right now. $156,400.”

Tristan hemmed and hawed. He gave some bullshit excuse about needing to talk to his dad's accountant first. But he was willing to give the others the same thing he’d given me. Each of the other three got $10,000.

With my tuition covered and my dad's newest round of bills covered, the pressure eased up on me. I could focus on studying. I didn’t have to work so many work study shifts. I could turn down the TaskRabbit jobs that kept popping up on my phone, reminding me I was poor. Things were easier, but I wasn’t happy.

I noticed the others started to buy things: new gaming laptops, designer handbags. Every time I saw Tristan, he was playing online poker on his phone, puffing on a diamond-studded vape. 

Colin and I were dating, now, I guess. He tried to cheer me up. Took me out to a fancy dinner with him. The food tasted like ashes in my mouth. 

Later that week, Emily and I were the last ones in the library. We were up late studying for our statistics midterm. 

I noticed that the library is freezing. I checked the thermostat. The heat was going full blast. It didn’t help. I pulled on my coat, but I still felt the chill in my bones. I could see my breath smoking now. Frost had formed in delicate fractal patterns on the window. Not on the outside of the window but the inside. The lights flickered. 

From the corner of my eye I saw someone step into the library. He wore a long ratty overcoat. A winter scarf was wrapped around his head, obscuring his features in shadow. All except his hands, which are black with frostbite. Every step he took sounded like ice cracking. 

With a flick, he unfolded a military entrenching tool. Its serrated blade glinted in the dim light. He was blocking the exit so Emily and I turned and fled the stacks.

In the claustrophobic labyrinth of shelves I somehow lost her. I came to a dead end. I was fumbling for my phone when I felt the cold on my back, like leaving the front door open in winter, and I knew he’d cornered me. I thought about pleading, about begging for my life, trying to explain the extenuating circumstances that led me to this point. But I knew it wouldn’t do any good. Not with him. 

Instead I reached into my bag and wrapped my fingers around the screwdriver I always kept handy for TaskRabbit jobs. I spun and with both hands I stabbed the screwdriver into his neck. 

The metal shaft easily sunk into his cold flesh all the way up to the handle. No blood spurted from the wound. I don’t think it hurt him. With a crackling sound his mouth curled into a smile. 

It bought me a split second. I squirmed past him and burst out a fire exit into the cold night beyond.

I raced across our snowy campus till I found a police officer and managed to get enough out to convince him it was an emergency. He pulled his gun and we both ran back the way I’d come.

We were a hundred yards from the library when I heard a crash high above. A window on the fifth floor of the stacks shattered sending a hail of broken glass down to the grass below. 

A half-second later, it was followed by Emily. She plummeted fifty feet to her death. I didn’t look away quick enough to not see it. 

The next few hours were a blur. The police searched the library and found no one. I was the only one who’d seen anyone else in the building. 

After awhile, from the way they were talking to me, I could tell they were treating it like a suicide. The cops left and eventually some sort of pyschologist came. She gave me hot chocolate. Told me I shouldn’t blame myself. We can never truly control the choices other people make. Unfortunately, at these fancy schools, it happens more than you’d think. 

The moment Emily hit the ground kept replaying in my head. My best friend was dead, but I didn’t have time to grieve, because I knew it wasn’t over. It was only just beginning. 

The next morning, I told the others what I was now afraid was the truth: Abel Fryst was back from the dead. He was coming for us and he wouldn’t stop until he got his money. 

I showed them what I’d found the night before as I was trying to find out more about the “Payback” KrowdFundMe, still at $0 of its $782,000 goal. 

I’d learned the campaign had a Rewards section—something for backers who gave a certain amount. For “Payback” there were two Rewards available, for two backers who each donated $156,400. The description of this reward was simply: “You Live”. 

“What the hell is this supposed to be?” asked Tristan. 

“$156,400 is one-fifth of the money,” I said. “Two people who donate their share will be spared. The other three are on the hook for the rest.”

“It’s for us,” said Colin to me. “You and I were the two who voted give him his money. It’s… He’s showing us mercy!”

I didn’t think it was mercy. 

“Regardless,” I said, “it’s clear that we just need to take everything from the first campaign—all $782,000—and put it into “Payback”. We give Abel Fryst what we owe him and this ends now.”

Tristan shook his head. “Look, I don’t even know why I have to explain this but when people die they don’t come back. It’s got to be a coincidence. Or a prank. Somebody messing with us.”

Colin and Genevieve were scared though. They believed me and they didn’t want to die.

“Look, it sucks that Emily killed herself or whatever,” said Tristan, “but I’m not going to let you all throw away three-quarters of a million dollars for some online troll extortion bullshit.”

Tristan wouldn’t budge. Colin couldn’t persuade him. Genevieve couldn’t either. In the end, she broke up with him right then and there. Tristan left without giving any of us a cent.

We didn’t know what to do. It felt like Abel Fryst might come for us any second. Unlike Tristan, none of the three of us were rich. We started to argue. 

“I don’t even understand what a dead guy wants with money,” said Colin with his face buried in his hands.

“I don’t think he wants the money,” I said. “I think he wants the money to break us.”
