Walking in on Sunday nights are always the worst, tonight especially. It was bitter cold to the point that even though it is short walk through the parking lot I was woefully unprepared for the weather. I never brought more than a jacket since I was always big, but since I lost the weight I really need to prepare for winter better. It was already getting hard to see, the visibility on the drive was bad but now I can barley see from my car to the front door, only a 120ft walk, and the snow was already starting to pile up. 

The winds were so strong it was deafening almost pushing me to the ground twice. It caused me to not notice the snow plow coming from behind until it was almost upon me forcing me to jump out of the way. The next thing I feel is myself coved in snow as the plow brushed by, the weight and speed of it knocking me over a few feet leaving only my chest and head exposed. “Yo, fucking be careful!” I screamed as it continued by, not even recognizing the tragedy. 

By the time I picked myself up it was too far gone to do anything, and I only had a couple of minutes until my handoff. I didn’t have time to go home and change as much snow off myself as I could and headed in. I knew we were going to have a huge snow storm tonight but didn’t realize how bad it was getting and I’m still annoyed that even thou I can work from home our boss insisted someone needed to be at the desk.

Passing through the revolving door I stomp my boots clearing them off. I give a wave to security not looking up as I swipe my badge and walk through the security gate no bigger than the ones on the subways with a glass panel instead of the rotating bars. Around the corner and up the stairs taking the same path I always do, through rows of open desks, couches, and computers empty as always on a Sunday night. 

First stop is the cantina as always to drop off my food and pour myself a cup of the shitty airline coffee they always have on stand-by. “God what I wouldn’t give for a Kurig” I thought to myself as I take a sip of the hot brew needing that little caffeine boost before another boring shift. 

Making my way to our corner of the second floor, light follows me as I walk and trigger the sensors illuminating the dark almost empty office. “Hey Mike, chilling in the dark again?” I chuckle as I always find him sitting in the dark on the weekends. “I guess I forgot to get up and walk for a while, am deep into a horror podcast.” He snickered back adjusting to the light suddenly thrust onto him. “What happened?” He points to remnants of snow on my damp pants. I groan “Be careful out there, the plow drivers are so oblivious today almost got hit in the parking lot. Anyway, give me the rundown so you can make it home before the roads get too bad.” 

Turnover was always quick he told me a couple of the flights he worked on and a few things to note during my shift but there wasn’t really anything for me to do tonight. Same as always during the off season but I came prepared as the boredom can be exhausting. Plopping into my seat I boot up my computer opening all the apps most of which will be sitting idle for the next 8 hours. 

By the time I sat down and Mike got up to leave a couple of the lights on the way out had already shut off, I don’t know how I noticed but out of the corner of my eye I see as he walked away they didn’t turn on like when I walked in. I shrugged off the thought as it could be several things, but little did I know that wasn’t the weirdest thing that was going to happen tonight and that was just the start.
 
The first three hours dragged by, you can only watch so many youtube videos and scroll on Instagram for so long before you need to move. Feeling a little puckish, I take an indirect route to the cantina getting a couple extra steps in along the way walking to the other side of the office. 

Looking around I see that now weather deteriorated even more, you can’t even see the ground from the second-floor and snow whipped across the view with almost a veracity. Moving along I can just feel how empty the office is, all the open desks void of people and life with the space feeling almost like being in open water. Usually there are one or two people on Sunday but today, nothing, maybe they got lucky enough to stay home as most of this floor doesn’t directly affect the operation. 

The blue light of monitor grabbed my attention as the rest of the computers have been off I don’t see anyone so it only holds my attention for a brief moment before it leaves my mind and I grab my snack.

Back at my desk I crack open my dip and celery letting the crunch fill the air. While eating I glance and barley see it before it disappears as an email notification only reading the first 3 words “NOTICE: NOTHING IS….” I open my email trying to find it but all three of my inboxes show all emails are read. 

Something compelled me to try and find that email. Spending the next 15 minutes going through spam folder, trash, and recently deleted trying to locate that email as It looked like it could affect one of our flights with no luck. 

I shoot a text to my boss seeing if he knew anything about it, hopping back to Instagram while I waited. A response from him never took too long even on the weekends he was always available for questions if we needed anything but when he didn’t respond for 2 hours that’s when things started really feeling off. There nothing else happening, no emails, no new flights to input, no documents to review so I try to call him. 

The ringing off the speaker was almost hypnotic as I keep my ear pressed to my phone finally breaking out of it as I hear “It’s Greg, sorry I couldn’t answer the phone please leave your name number and a message so I can get back to you as soon as I can.” The dull tone indicating me to start talking rung as I say, “Hey Greg, it’s Lou, I saw an email notification about a Notice but couldn’t find it in the actual application just wondering if you knew anything about it thanks.” 

I couldn’t help but feel like something was off, with it still in my hand I call my wife. I pray for her to answer as it rings in my ear each time getting louder and louder as my focus intensified before my stomach drops as I go to voicemail to her as well. I text her to call me as soon as she can so I can make sure she is ok at home with the snowstorm. 

While that was true, I was more focused on contacting anyone. Shooting off a couple more texts to friends and family I desperately wait for someone to respond. After an hour I give up and go look for someone else to see if I am the only person who can’t contact anyone. First I traverse the second floor going up and down each row of desks looking for even a hint someone is here. There are personal items scattered around but no computers on at all even in the area I saw that one on earlier. The quiet was starting to become louder and even my quiet steps on the carpet broke it violently with each step. 

With nothing on the second I make my way back down to the first, maybe someone at security will know what is going on. Rushing to the front desk desperate for something besides the silence, as I round the corner I am met with more of the same, nothing. The two seats always manned sit empty, I wait for 15 minutes seeing if anyone will come back I feel more and more anxious each minute passing with nothing breaking the tension. When no one still shows I start making my way back to my desk. 

On the second floor as I stride into the corner of the office, I am startled as cutting through the open air, which has been still for the last 4 hours, is the ringing of a desk phone.
