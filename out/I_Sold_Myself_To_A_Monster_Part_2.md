Overnight, an old-fashioned outlet and a phone charger appeared in my room. To my shock, they worked. I had internet, but I couldn’t call anyone. That was fine. I didn’t have anyone to call. I had only been in The Duke’s mansion for a short while; however, I was getting lonely. The beast that brought me here had no interest in hanging out. It was impossible to find him unless he wanted to be found.  

The deliveries had been delayed for one more day because of a massive storm. I found an old history book to keep me occupied for the day. When I got too bored, I walked around the mansion trying to map a mental map of the second floor. This place was so large I didn’t think I could explore it in a single day. I walked down the main stairway when the front door opened. After the vampire incident, I was scared another creature was after my blood.  

Duke walked inside shaking off the rain from his long cloak. My heart settled down seeing him. I made my way over to him to see what he was up to.  

“I have this.” He said and lifted his cloak.  

I took a step back seeing a person under it being protected from the rain. She came out appearing nervous. She was short, about half my height with shoulder-length light color hair that shone blue. She wore a simple white dress and no shoes. Thick braided bracelets hung from her small wrists. Her tan skin had countless dark spots across her face and along her arms. She was small but looked like an adult.   

“Did you go back to the auction?” I said looking between the pair. “I think she’s too small to be a bed warmer.” I commented.  

For a moment she appeared startled. Her eyes darted up and down over Duke’s body thinking the same thing I did when I first met him.  

“Please take care of her. I shall be in my room for the day.”  

We let him walk away and disappear into the shadows. I felt bad for the poor girl. I wondered if she had been kidnapped and sold against her will.  

“Duke won’t touch you. I won’t either. You're safe here.” I assured her. "Do you know English?” I asked when the thought came to me.   

“Yes. I lived near a human settlement. They taught me much about your kind. Though, I have never used a cellphone or anything related to such things.” She explained.  

That helped. I scratched the back of my neck wondering what to do now. Duke didn’t mention why he brought her here. Did he think I needed a friend? Or someone to tell me not to let in vampires?  

“What is your name?” She asked me.  

“Arven.” I replied feeling bad I didn’t ask first.  

“Avan.” She said.  

“Arven.” I gently corrected. “What about yours?”  

“Tolca.”  

“Toeca?” I joked.  

She smiled and I said her name properly. She glanced around taking in the size of the room. She didn’t appear as nervous as before. I wanted her to feel safe considering what she had just gone through.  

“Are you alright? I mean, did anyone force you into the auction? You don’t need to talk about what happened if it upsets you though.” I offered wondering what I could do to support her.  

“I’m fine. A drought hit the forest my family lives inside. We needed currency for water. I am the smallest adult. I cannot help much when it comes to hunting. I offered myself to be sold in order for the rest to get through the drought. I am aware of my size and know of the risk of certain people’s interest in that sort of thing. No matter what kind of disgusting act I may need to go through, I was mentally prepared to protect the ones I loved.”  

My stomach churned thinking of what could have happened to Tolca if she was brought by the wrong person. I hunched down to get on her level unsure if she might consider the action rude.  

“I don’t know why Duke bought you. It might have been on a whim. If you want to go home, I don’t think he’ll stop you.” I told her.  

Tolca mentally debated the idea.   

“That man paid a great deal to bring me here. Even if it was on a whim, it would be distasteful to leave without attempting to repay him. What did he buy you for?”  

My face dropped thinking back to the embarrassing exchange. I didn’t think I could bring myself to fully explain what happened.  

“I wasn’t suited for the purpose he wanted me for. I’m trying to clean the place until I can save enough to leave.”  

Even though I avoided the answer, she had her own ideas of what the reason was. I spoke again trying to distract her from those ideas.  

“You can pick whatever room you like. Can you help clean? Or is there something else you would like to do?”  

“I enjoy cooking.” She nodded. “However, I can help get this place in order.”  

I nodded glad to have another person with me. I just needed to get one more thing out of the way.  

“Would you like to be friends?”  

Her eyes grew wet at those words. She was strong enough to hold back her tears. I offered to give her a hug which she accepted. Tolca reminded me a little of my sister when she was in her teens. I swore that I would do whatever it took to make her comfortable here.   

“Oh, right. It seems like there are some monsters after Duke. I’ll do my best to protect you. As long as we don’t let in any vampires, we should be fine.”  

“Who would be stupid enough to let in a vampire?” She said and I didn’t reply.  

Instead, I focused on distracting her with chores. Tolca didn’t have any belongings, no spare clothing whatsoever. She picked out a bedroom next to mine. She requested a set of thread and needle to make a spare outfit with a blanket. We needed to wash it first. That snowballed us into cleaning the bathroom looking for fabric soap. One thing led to another. We spent hours washing blankets and sheets in a large bathtub and then putting them outside on a balcony railing to dry because it had finally stopped raining. For dinner, Tolca made warm meat and cheese sandwiches which was a step up from what I’d been eating.   

The sky started to grow dark making us decide to stop for the night. I gathered up the blankets dumping them on Tolca’s now clean bed. I shut the large window door to the balcony.  

“I’m dead tired. I’m going to head to bed. Do you need anything before I go?” I asked her.  

Tolca appeared like she wanted to ask something of me but she shook her head. I was sore from a full day of effort. It appeared like no matter how much work we did we didn’t make a dent in what still needed to be cleaned. It was nice having a second person who wanted to help.  

“Thank you for being kind to me. I’ve dealt with humans that either hate us or have strange tastes towards my kind.” Tolca said just before I left the room.  

She wasn’t human. I hadn’t considered if her kind hunted people. Most monsters in media tended to do that. I could also see why a person would be attracted to her. She was pretty but her height was a major turn-off for me. I could only imagine what kind of grief she needed to deal with around people who liked her for that reason.   

“Humans can be weird. I’m glad I’m not one of the odd ones.” I shrugged.  

“No, you are.” She disagreed.  

“Thanks for that. See you tomorrow morning.”  

I left to my room. I didn’t like the idea of being in a cold bed unable to sleep for a few hours. I took a shower first to get the grime off. The water ran grey for a few minutes. Cleaning was dirty work sometimes.  

As much as I was glad Tolca ended up here, I wasn’t too happy her sale supported the auction house. It seemed like they weren’t above taking advantage of people in tight spots. I was lucky that I got tricked into selling myself to someone who appeared mostly harmless. Tolca didn’t get the same kind of promise. That place didn’t care who bought their product. Sure, Tolca’s family wouldn’t starve, but what would happen to the next person? If I spoke with Duke I might ask him to not support that place any longer.  

I sat in bed with those thoughts going through my head. The wind finally died down outside with glimpses of the moon shining through the clouds. Glancing outside I thought I saw a dark shape in the night sky. Was that a bird? Did birds fly at night? Owls do, but what else? It appeared to be getting larger the longer I stared at it. When I realized the dark shape was barreling towards the mansion, I shot out of bed to race toward my door. By the time I pulled open Tolca’s door the massive shape had landed on her balcony. It forced its way through the balcony doors without any effort because I had forgotten to properly latch them.   

She ran into me. I took her wrist then we bolted down the hallway with the new beast hot on our heels. It ran on all fours with large bat wings tucked against its body. It wasn’t a vampire; it looked different from the one from yesterday. The monster looked more like a dog mixed with a bat. The mouth stretched from ear to ear, countless teeth shone in the moonlight.  

Tolca had shorter legs, but she ran faster than I did. She quickly opened a door and grabbed my sleeve to drag me inside. She made us slip behind the door. The monster followed us into the room, sliding a few feet unable to stop as suddenly as we did. We ran around the door and slammed it locking the beast in before it recovered. The massive body slammed against the door but it held for the moment.  

“Let me bite you!” Tolca said over her shoulder.  

We raced down the hallway trying to put more distance away from the threat. I didn’t understand why she made such a demand. I wasn’t in a position to ask questions. I put out my hand so her sharp teeth could painfully come down on it. She drew blood before I drew away.  

“Bite me next!” She ordered offering her hand.  

“Why-”  

The wind was suddenly knocked from my lungs. The beast crashed through the locked door breaking it in half. It stood on its back legs and took hold of the broken door before throwing it in our direction. It missed but the door bounced off the wall and hit me hard in the side. We had been running beside the wooden railing that overlooked the entrance. The force of the blow knocked me over and I hit the ground hard. Tolca jumped after me crying out my name.  

I couldn’t get up. My head swam with pain, and I thought I saw stars. Her hand was forced into my mouth and I tasted blood. I felt the impact of the monster landing near us. With some effort, I sat up to see it stand on its back legs. A menacing smile over its gruesome face.  

“How cute. I’ll enjoy ripping you apart.” It spoke in a raspy inhuman voice that was hard to understand.  

“How old are you?” Tolca asked me over her shoulder.  

The out-of-place question confused the monster enough for it to pause. I sputtered out my age. She nodded and turned her attention back toward the beast.  

“You’re my younger brother then. We shared blood. We’re family now. I’m not a strong fighter when it comes to my safety however I am fierce when I’m protecting my treasure.”  

I didn’t get a chance to speak. Tolca’s form quickly shifted before my eyes. In a split second, she had turned from a small woman to a huge, long animal. She looked like a light blue snow leopard with flaming blue spots. Her paws were larger than my head. Suddenly, this looked like a fair fight.  

The beast looked as shocked as I felt. It stood his ground for a second. It made a wise choice of turning tail to run. It wasn’t fast enough. Tolca fell on the creature, claws, and teeth easily ripping the body apart.   

I sat up watching the scene. I hurt too much to move. I reminded myself to never get on her bad side as I watched the gory scene. She devoured half of the monster's body and finally raised her head. The deep blue eyes landed in my direction nearly giving me a heart attack.   

She took a few steps closer. On instinct, I shuffled back. Her body transformed back however her clothing didn’t come with her. It remained shredded on the floor. I screamed and threw off my shirt for her to hear. She didn’t appear to notice my distress.  

Dark blood seeped through the clothing. Her body was covered with it. It would take forever to scrub it off the floor.   

“I heard a woman scream.” A new voice came from above us.  

Duke appeared from the shadows. His head moved between the half-eaten body of the monster and the two he had bought.   

“Are you two getting along?” He asked.  

We both nodded. Duke reached down to touch the creature's remains. He took a handful of flesh, blood dripping from his claws. A golden color spread from where he touched. The blood turned to small uncut gemstones and gold clattering to the floor.  

“These belong to you. It was your kill. Do you wish to send it to your family?”  

Tolca glanced at me. If she gave me the pile on the ground, I could leave and never risk my life being eaten by a monster.   

“Please give the funds to whoever can provide water to ones who need it.” Tolca said.  

Duke nodded. With a motion of his hand, the small fortune disappeared.   

“I am going to try and sleep tonight. Scream again if you require my assistance.” Duke said turning away, his normal monotone voice had a hint of humor.  

“You enjoy inviting threats inside this place?” Tolca asked the moment Duke left.  

“What?” I asked without a single idea why she would ever consider that.  

“You invited in a vampire before, right? And you didn’t lock the window properly because you wanted another creature to come inside. I don’t mind. At least it didn’t break down my door.”  

I kept my mouth shut. I didn’t know if it would be worse to admit I didn’t do either of those things on purpose. I gathered myself ready to get this day over with. Tolca held my hand the entire way. I wondered if this was it was like living with a younger sister. Even though she was older than me I couldn’t see her as a big sister. We stopped at my door. I waited for her to leave but she didn’t.  

“Would it bother you if I stayed in your room tonight? I normally sleep in a room with a few people...”  

I really didn’t mind that. She needed to wash the blood off first. I had found a spare large shirt that must have belonged to The Duke at some point. It reached her ankles, and she swam in frills. It was good enough. I thought I would have issues sharing a bed with someone. Turns out, I didn’t mind it too much. In fact, it was easier to fall asleep stealing body heat from Tolca. She wasn’t affected by the terrifying encounter that day. This may be a part of her daily life. I could leave this mansion at any time. I found myself thinking nearly dying every other day wasn’t too bad.
