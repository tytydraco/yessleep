I found it, I found the portal to hell, at least that's what I think it is. I was heading up to visit my family in northern Canada when I had to stop at a motel to rest after driving for 9 hours straight. After stopping I got out of my car and noticed a small hole forming in the parking lot, right next to where I parked my car. I didn’t figure it’d be a problem, it just looked like a pot-hole. I checked myself into the motel after talking to the clerk, and headed up to my room. After I got settled in I turned on the TV to have background noise as I read my book.

After a while I put my book down and turned on the news. It said the same stuff that it always has but I was looking for the weather. It is usual for Canada, it's going to be cold and snowy. Tonight it was going to be really snowy so I went outside and headed to a nearby 24 hour general store to get a windshield scraper for my car since I left mine at my house another 9 hours away. I grabbed one and a few Canadian snacks that I don't have in America. After that I went back to the motel and went to bed. I woke up around 7 in the morning and went outside to prepare my car for another drive.

When I got outside the hole that I didn’t bother to check had grown in size and now had swallowed almost half of my car. Outside was warm, like Florida warm. I questioned my own sanity before I saw the small crowd that had gathered around the hole. I asked any of them to help pull my car out, but to no avail. So I tried to do it myself and ended up just almost ripping my fender off.

I was left with few options so I chose to call a towing company and see if they could pull my car out but they thought I was  prank-calling them. I asked if anyone in the crowd if they had a tow truck to pull my car out. One man piped up that he had a tow truck but there was no way he could safely pull my car out but he would try. He left for 5 minutes and came back with his truck.

He hooked it up and started pulling when the ground gave out and my car fell, thankfully the man in the truck was fine, the hook had been taken with the car though. So here I am, sitting in the motel next to hell. I feel a strong computation to look inside the hole, maybe even jump in. I’ve been watching the hole and I’ve seen many people go into the hole. Many have been stopped, but others had no one to stop them. Right now the police are involved and it's only a matter of time before the government gets involved with this weird hell hole.

Speak of the devil and he shall answer, I’ve been ushered out of the motel by a Canadian soldier and within time I’ll either be sent to my family or back to America. I need to tell them my end of the story, then they’ll send me to a holding cell in a nearby jail for the time being. I am allowed my phone in here only because they have me in here because I was staying in a motel and they have nowhere else to put me. I have a feeling the men in the suits are here for me, and I don’t like it.
