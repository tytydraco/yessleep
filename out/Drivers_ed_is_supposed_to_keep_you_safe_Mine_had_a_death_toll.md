The town of Clearview took road safety seriously. That's why driver's education class was required for all juniors at Clearview High. But as far as classes went, this was one most students didn't mind. I mean, we got to drive a car. Better than math class, at least.

The class format was simple: an hour of in-class instruction followed by an hour of driving out on the course. We did this once a week for half a year, then we could take our driver's tests.

And our driver's-ed teacher was pretty cool. An old guy named "Mr. Busso," who had just the right mix of a sense of humor and not caring too much about his job. He spent just as much time joking around as he did teaching.

When we got around to actual work, he would have us read a section from the textbook and answer a series of multiple-choice questions at the end of the chapter. Then Mr. Busso would do this thing, which was funny at first, but got old quick.

Going over the questions, he would read out the correct answers for us to check our work. But he would add a little joke at the end.

"Number one… C, for 'cute'," and then he would give a wry smile to the class. "Like Busso."

"Number two… A, for 'awesome'… Like Busso."

Our laughs turned to moans as he took twice as long to check the answers because of his penchant for self-compliments.

One day, however, something was different. Once he made it through the first five questions, something shifted on his face. He looked confused at first. His eyes went wide, his mouth agape as if he were in a trance. He took a deep breath, and when he spoke, his voice was different. Deeper.

"Number six… A, for accident. Number seven… C, for catastrophe."

We laughed, happy that Mr. Busso was changing the bit around a little. But as he continued, it became apparent that this was something other than a joke.

"Number eight… B, for blood… so much blood… Number nine… D, for 'Don't get in the cars!'"

But then, like nothing had happened, he snapped back to his old self.

"Number ten… A, for 'adorable'… Like Busso."

The shift was so dramatic that one of the students interrupted him.

"Mr. Busso," she said. "Are you okay?"

He cocked his head and scrunched his brow.

"I'm fine. Though I'll be better when we get through all these questions."

And so we did. The class ended, and we nervously filed out of the room toward the driving course behind the building.

The whispers and chatter followed us all the way to the cars.

"What was that?"

"Was he joking?"

"Think it's safe to drive today?"

I felt what everyone else was feeling, but couldn't think of a way things could go wrong.

The driver's ed course was, for all intents and purposes, as safe as it could be. It was a large mock town, the size of a few football fields, with low buildings, various road signs and markings and parking situations. Atop a tall watchtower in the center of the course, stood Mr. Busso, overlooking the drivers below and radioing instructions and corrections.

We got into our cars, each car assigned a number, which was how we would be addressed over the radio, and started driving.

I was in car five.

Tensions were a little high as the cars pulled out of the parking area and made their way around the little town. I couldn't shake the nerves though, driving as carefully as possible, looking both ways twice before pulling out into an intersection.

Mr. Busso's quips helped ease the tension a bit.

"Car four, parallel park there… Car four, who taught you how to parallel park… Oh, me? Well…"

We drove around for twenty minutes until we heard another voice on the radio. It was a woman's; low and commanding.

"Car three, disregard that stop sign."

*What the…*

But before I could even process what I had heard, two cars collided in the intersection in front of me. The girl in car eight was slumped over the steering wheel, while the boy in car three was still gunning the gas, spinning his tires out as the front of the car began to smoke.

I looked up at the watchtower and saw Mr. Busso peering over the edge anxiously.

"Car seven, turn left now."

Another crash sounded in the distance.

All over, cars were disregarding traffic rules, going way too fast and colliding with each other and the stationary objects around them.

One girl had the idea to jump out of her car and make a run for the concrete barrier. I couldn't see what happened to her after she ran past a building. But a loud thud from that direction told me all I needed to know.

"Car five, put your car in park."

My mind said *no,* but with a shaking hand, I grabbed the gear selector and threw it into park.

"Car two, speed up."

I heard the sound of an engine roaring behind me, growing louder by the second. But I couldn't bring myself to move. I struggled with all my might to regain control of my body, but couldn't move a muscle.

Suddenly, the car door opened. Something wrapped around my waist and hurled me from the driver's seat just as my car was violently rear-ended. The car caught my leg as it lurched forward and tore a gash across my ankle.

Looking around, I couldn't see anyone or anything that could have been my rescuer. Just smoke, crumbling buildings and mangled cars.

I got to my feet and ran through the door of one of the mock buildings nearby.

Inside the hollow plywood building, I fell to the floor, grasping my wounded leg.

Had I chosen any other building…

The next thing I heard was the woman's voice once more, but not through car speakers anymore.

"Stand."

Despite the pain shooting through my ankle, I stood up. Did I tell my body to do that?

On the other side of the small building sat a woman behind a desk; a microphone and various electrical equipment arrayed before her.

I could hardly make her out in the darkness, her face only barely illuminated by the blinking lights and screens. Her dark hair covered most of her face, but a pair of glasses reflected the artificial light as she moved.

She also stood, holding a device up to her mouth as she spoke.

"Come."

Unable to speak, desiring only to run. I stepped toward her.

"Take this, please."

She held out a pistol. I watched my hand disobey every order my mind screamed at it.

*Don't take the gun!*

But despite my internal protests, I reached out and took it. My face was sweating, my breath coming in gasps. But I couldn't make a single move beyond what this woman's voice commanded.

"Hold it to your head."

I felt the barrel of the gun rest against my temple. My eyes were fixed on the shadowy woman, her white smile visible through the darkness. You notice strange things when you're staring death in the face. My eyes locked onto a small silver pin attached to the woman's dark blouse. She opened her mouth to speak.

And then I heard a gunshot.

The woman crumpled to the ground.

Finally free, I threw the gun to the floor and turned to the source of the noise.

Mr. Busso stood at the door, lowering his own pistol to his side.

"A, for always armed… like Busso."

He walked past me, surveying the woman, and the equipment set up on the table. He reached down and pulled the pin off of the woman's shirt, inspecting it in the light of the screens.

"HaleTech Industries…*"* he spat, throwing the pin across the plywood floor.
