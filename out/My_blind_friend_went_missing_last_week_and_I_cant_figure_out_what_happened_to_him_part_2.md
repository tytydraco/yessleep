When i was 10 i was an outcast, i was never liked or even acknowledged by any of my peers, there was always an air of disdain around me. As i moved forward i always felt unworthy of anybody, i was alone. Jonah was the first person in the world to ever care about me. At this point in my life i had developed a habit of rejecting others before they could do the same to me. Causing most people to give up on any relationship on me. I was an angry little kid, i don't know what Jonah saw in me. Even to this day i have no idea why he approached me, put in the herculean effort to become friends with me. 

So when he lost his eyesight i decided to stick with him like he stuck to me. I was the only one who did, as much as i felt bad for my friend, i felt my pride bolster even more as self importance took over. It was ME who stuck with Jonah, not anyone else. This was my shortcoming my reason for neglect. The reason i failed the only friend i had in this entire world, Jonah if you can somehow read this. I'm sorry, I'm beyond sorry, I didn't deserve a friend like you. 

As i sit here writing in the dark of a motel room on a shitty HP laptop, i thought once I got out i would feel joy like no other. All i feel is regret. Over my next few posts i will tell you all what happened to me over the last 10 months. All the mistakes i made all the people i killed. I feel i owe it to the people i asked for help on this forum almost a year ago. You deserve the truth.

Guess ill start where my last post left off. After i sent the post out to you guys i didn't want to wait for responses so i just drove back to Jonah's house to investigate. As i drove i thought of something unusual. *Jonah's backdoor wasn't broken* when the police where looking through his house they saw signs of a struggle but they never even considered a break in as a possibility. Neither did I. Everyone assumed they followed him into his house As i reached his house i walked in with purpose i searched every room in a fervor, every nook and cranny, i left no stone unturned. I began to curse as my searched turned nothing. No broken doors windows not even a knocked over vase. Jonah didn't like having glass objects in his house. 

After a while of looking i thought of something. *what was i gonna do if i ran into the pig thing*. The thought gave me pause. I realized i had no plan. From what i heard in the recording the thing was huge and strong. Not something i could face alone with no weapon. So i decided i would wait a second let my thoughts recollect and move forward with a calm mind.

I was always good at getting myself together.
