The staff at the gay conversion camp could never crack my brothers and I.  They did everything they could for the past two months.  Waterboarding, electrostatic therapy, the works.  Alpha and Charlie always stuck by my side, keeping me in one piece.  The staff were already growing impatient at our persistence.  Things were looking up for us.  We all thought they would have given up on us by that point.

Until they introduced us to “Project Muzzle.”

\---

The remaining uncured boys, my brothers and I included, all woke up strapped to metal chairs where muscular thugs with the build of Sasquatches stood in front.  They threw punch after punch until our faces were at the point of caving in.  Our veins and muscles were beaten until all the colors of a hideous rainbow tinted our hides.  Dull scratches throbbed from key lime green infections, inflammation burning us up from the inside out.

“Are they cured yet?” The headmaster bellowed from the back of the circular room.  As he strode towards the fluorescent lighting above our weary heads, he grabbed my chin and gave me an inspection.  His bright green eyes mirrored the deep machinations inside his head.

“Nope.  We’ve given them all we’ve got!  Should we give them another beating?” One of the goons said.

“Not this time.  I think it’s time we introduced them to ‘Project Muzzle.’  Bring out the serum!”

I frowned a bit, looking over at Alpha, who was in the seat next to me.  He gave a nod.  I feigned a snicker at the scientist, just as I Alpha taught me.  In reality, fear rattled down my bones, making my facial muscles weaken.

What exactly was “Project Muzzle?”

One of the nurses came over, her high heels clicking against the linoleum, holding white liquids in beakers.  She took each one of the blanched fluids, poured them into IV drips and stuck needles into our arms.  With the speed of a turtle in corn syrup, the concoctions slowly slunk down the plastic tubing and entered our veins.

“If the beatings won’t force you to convert…” The headmaster’s words slunk into my head with the viscosity of tar while my surroundings melted into a slush.

All at once, Alpha and Charlie slumped down in exhaustion and were lifted by the workers.  My eyelids grew heavy, and I fell asleep.

“…then true fear will.”

\---

The temperature of the cold tile woke us all up.  The rest of the boys stood in the middle of a four way intersection filled with a labyrinth of halls and doors.  Up above was a glass dome shielded by a metal cover.  Tables and chairs surrounded us in piles.

This wasn’t any area of the conversion camp I’d ever seen before.  It was wider, more spacious, and reeked of ammonia and other chemicals.

“Alpha!  Charlie!  You guys alright?” I asked.

“Yeah.  Just disoriented.”

CLICK!  In an eye blink, the lights flicked off.

Gunmetal flashlights clacked to the floor.  The other nurses retreated back into the darkness, the clacking of their feet being the only indication of their presence.  A door slammed from the back.  We all turned to the metal barrier, hearing the tumblers clink in place.

“The final test is simple: it ends when we think you’ve been cured.  If you crack, we free you.  Otherwise…” a voice croaked on an unseen intercom.

Alpha, Charlie and I felt our jaws involuntarily drop.  With one glance, we knew what we needed to do.  Our first instinct was to head straight, scanning our flashlights back and forth in a manner like that of a lighthouse.  Except for the pitter-pat of bare feet, all was quiet.

Alpha took the lead, putting his hands up in defense while Charlie guarded the back.  Rusty air-conditioning units clunked to the tune of their slowly rotating blades.  Their breathing was deafening compared to the dangerous silence that lingered through the hallways.

Pat, pat, pat…Footsteps from an unknown source.  We shone our lights in unison, waiting for whatever was lurking inside to pop up.

It never came out.  Alpha gave us a jolt to the side, signaling us to keep going.

A T intersection blocked our path.  Pressing our backs against the walls, we scanned the left and right.

“Which path should we take?” Charlie whispered.

I put a finger to my mouth.  Alpha and I stuck our thumbs in opposite directions.  To break the tie, we did a round of rock-paper-scissors.  My rock beat his scissors; right was my choice.  Charlie held his ground, holding the light down the left hallway.

Something swung open with a mighty clatter in front of us.  We froze in place, goosebumps forming on our sweaty skin.

“What was that?!” a kid shouted way off from the other side.

We rushed over to the source of the sound.  A cell greeted us on the left side.  Our flashlights couldn’t pierce the thick darkness on the inside.  The door was sealed shut like a fresh jar of peanut butter.  I touched the bars, feeling their cool surface, but backed in case if something was inside.  Rumbling slid through the cavernous room through the slits.

Peering our heads closer, a deep, distorted, repetitive gargling sound rumbled through the gates.  Tiny pale dots glanced back at us.  We fell back, getting away from the gate.

“No!  You don’t understand!  I’m cured!” a kid pleaded way off, hidden from our point of view.  The alien chatters and clicks grew louder.

The intercom spat out static followed by a frazzled voice on the other line.  “We don’t believe you.”

“Someone fucking help me!” the boy screamed in terror.  Squelching and tearing rippled through the hallways.  Our backs straightened in terror.  Turning around to the scuffling of something to the left, the door behind us somehow opened up without making a sound.  The armada of shuffling drew nearer, but nothing was there.  A shiver developed on my spine.

“Run,” Alpha whispered.

Bolting out like a bat out of hell, we ran down random paths without rhyme or reason, hoping that whatever was back there would lose us.  Charlie kept glancing behind us, still keeping his pace.  Various junk clattered everywhere in our escape.  Whatever was behind us was gaining on us meter, by meter, by meter, even though its presence wasn’t clear.

We hit another intersection where shuffling blocked our path.  Shadows peered out from a corner.  Thimble eyes beamed at us from the shadows.  We sprinted down the other path, hearing rustling down there, too.

My head wheeled around every which way.  I bit my lip.  Everywhere I looked, there was something lurking in each path.  Something reached out from the distance, scratching my elbow.  Alpha barged in the way, shoving us forward, away from whatever was in front of us.

“What are we going to do?!” I hissed.

Alpha pointed to some junk close by, a mass lurking not far away from it.  “Hide there.”

“There’s something out there!  We can’t just out run it!”

“Then we have to get creative.”  He dove towards the junk pile, frantically waving his hands.  Charlie and I reluctantly agree, following his orders and trying not to scream.  Alpha covers himself with a sheet, while Charlie hides under the cover of a cardboard box.  I cower inside a small box, leaving the open side facing the wall.

Moist hands clomped up to us; a shadow darker than a black hole overtook what little light was left in the passage.  I pursed my lips and clenched my jaw shut.  The guttural moans of whatever was outside resonated.  It gave one last snort before ambling away, its presence growing fainter and fainter.

We all waited for about five minutes.

The sound of a sheet flopping to the ground alerted us that the coast was clear.

The air grew heavier than lead all around me.  I didn’t even bother escaping my hiding place.  Everywhere around me, I could hear the sounds growing louder and louder.  I cover my head with my hands, hyperventilating.  My vision blurred.  Despite the box facing the wall, I could see visions behind me.  What if those monsters came back?  What if my brothers were going to abandon me?  Was their support all just a trick and they were only using me as bait?

“No, no, no, no, no…” I mumbled.  Alpha removes the box from behind me, holding his hands out sympathetically.

“Bravo?” He said, concerned.

All I had to do was shout that I’ve given up, and it would all be over.  No, I couldn’t bring attention to my brothers and leave them to die.  I folded my lips behind my teeth, trying to hold in my emotions like Atlas holding up the Earth.  My eyes clench tighter and tighter.

“WE GIVE UP-“Alpha covered my mouth with his hand, embracing me in a hug and silencing me.  My hot tears poured down his shoulder.

“Shh…It’s alright, I’ve got you…”

“I got you all into this mess…Mom and Dad wouldn’t have sent us to this hellhole if I weren’t an abomination!” I sobbed.

“That’s not true.  That’s not true at all.  You never were.  You’re perfectly fine and you always will be.”  He soothingly holds onto my clavicles.  “Listen.  You’ve got us by our side.  We all fought through the abuse at this nightmare of a place.  Remember what we are all fighting for?  Just hang in there!  We will all get out and everything will go back the way it once was.”

Wiping the last of my tears on my sleeve, I scrunched my brow and nod.

“Now let’s bust out of here.” Alpha said, shaking a fist encouragingly.

Charlie guided us forward, taking random turn after random turn.  A form stood right before us like a gray teratoma before vanishing into the night.

“Did you see that?” I said to Alpha, blinking a few times.  The phantasm blended in with the cover of darkness.  Alpha thrust his light into the area in front.

Nothing came up.

“Must have been your imagination.  We’ve got to find an exit.” He declared.

Although there wasn’t a presence in sight for nearly thirty minutes, we didn’t want to risk anything leaping out.  More gray specters formed here and there, popping out around corners.  The darkness distorted my vision too much.

Eventually, all three of us reached a corner, where a map of the facility was, left in paper.  Alpha beamed me a smile and we all embraced each other in a hug.  We were all one step closer to getting out of this facility.

I put my hand on my neck.  “Hey Alpha?”

“Yes?”

“You guys have always been there for me and now that the heat has died down a bit, I just want to thank you all for supporting me like this.  More than just defending me back there.  You helped me fight back and regain my willpower.  But I want to ask you all one thing: why have you been resisting my parent’s control after all this time?  Like I said, you wouldn’t even be in this mess if it wasn’t for me!”

Alpha and Charlie’s smiles drooped.  They each mouthed the word “yeah.”  Alpha reached out.  “Because I couldn’t stand watching you get hurt and be treated like trash.  As the oldest, it is my duty to help look out for you all.  If I just protected Charlie, then what kind of brother am I?”

“Yeah, our parents always favored you two.  I guess you’re a rare case of an apple falling far from the tree.” I snarked, grinning.

All three of us laughed.  Charlie chimed in.  “Remember all those stories I had told you about me being beat up in school by those jerks?”

“Yeah?”

“I knew what it felt like to suffer, and you’ve suffered far more than any of us.  It’s the worst feeling in the world.  I don’t want anyone to experience the pain that I went through.”

I thanked them for helping me get this far.  Wiping the dust off my pants, we took a sharp right.

SLAP!  It came from the floor, drawing our attention and dissolving the brotherly moment.  I spun around, seeing the horrid mangled body of a boy no older than fifteen.  His black hair was matted together with blood seeping down from his scalp like the glaze on a cherry frosted donut.  Every bone in his now frail and mutilated body was left in nothing but splinters that stuck out from his skin.  With each reach, his bones cracked even louder.

He futilely reached out to us, trying to hang on to life, screaming until his mouth was bleeding.  I double blinked in horror.  Charlie put his hand in front of us.

Then, he was gone.  I looked down into the distance, seeing if whatever was in the plaster labyrinth had seized him.  Back on the floor, there wasn’t a drop of blood.

No fingernail scratches, no broken bone pieces, not even a silhouette that indicated that the boy was even there in the first place.

It didn’t take us long to figure out what was up.

The fluid that the nurses gave us.  It had some hallucinogen in it.  This didn’t make any sense, though.  Some of the apparitions were real.  Where they?  The cage way back near our starting point was real.  I could feel its coolness against the palms of my hands.  And the scratch against my elbow.  That was real.

We looked back at the map.  All of the locations suddenly shifted around before our eyes as if we were in a maze straight out of a Dungeons and Dragons campaign.

“What are we going to do?” I asked Alpha.

My eldest brother crumples up the paper in frustration.  “Damn those fucking nurses!  We’re going to have to charge in blindly, using what we can of the map.  Hopefully, an exit is here somewhere.”

Just like that, we ran off.

\---

At first, it seemed simple, all we had to do was just remember what the map looked like before the visions clouded our retinas.  None of us could decipher the twisting ink on the paper that slithered around and wriggled in a snake-ish manner.

Praying for the best was the only option; taking an occasional turn here, another one there, and picking paths at random.  False pathways animated to life, only to disappear back in with the drywall.

The liquid darkness grew more virulent the longer we stood around.  I’d shine my flashlight around in a frenzy, hoping to catch any of the apparitions in the act but never succeeding.  Alpha constantly studied the map, hoping that none of the paths changed and that everyone was going the right way.  Hooks of fear dug into my veins, shredding them with every path we took.

And then, the exit stood before our eyes, just down the end of a long hallway.  A neon red sign hovered above a complex door I’ve only seen locking bank vaults.  We all rubbed our eyes, hoping it wasn’t another hallucinogen induced trick.  After standing there for minutes, exposing ourselves to whatever was inside, we got a closer look.

Not wanting to take any chances, Charlie checked if something was behind us.  Nothing was there.

He suddenly grew pale when he looked again, the aura around him colder than ice.

“What’s wrong?” I asked.  The only thing Charlie did was point his light at something off where the exit was.

Our heads craned back in unison.  The neon lights of the exit sign were snuffed out, hastily replaced with hundreds of white, pupilless eyes attached to an unseen form.

All of us screamed at the top of our lungs.  My brothers took off without a second thought.  Staring down at the beast, legs glued to the floor was the only thing I could think of.

I clenched my eyes again.  All it took was for me to crack and my brothers and I would be saved.  The black mass was still inside, staring directly at us.

Or I could just let myself die.

My skin froze at the hairs, the pores damping my skin.  Alpha grabbed onto my shoulders, shaking me out of my funk.

“Snap out of it!  We’re so close!  Don’t let our efforts all be for nothing!” He bellowed.

When his words hit my eardrums, my blood ran hot.  My nostrils flared with steam hotter than a Yellowstone geyser.

I couldn’t just let myself die right now.  They sacrificed their lives to protect me.

Now it was time for me to protect myself for their sake.

We blindly scampered from the apparition, moving towards the back where another beast came in, missing us by inches.  Still keeping track of where the exit was, we took an immediate right.  A false wall.  We keep running until our backs met against a dead end.  One of the pathways suddenly opened.  This time, it wasn’t fake.  To our luck, nothing blocked our path, but the beast was still behind us.  Alpha barged against the door before cranking the tumblers open.

It stopped for a bit.

“OPEN THE DOOR!” Charlie and I screamed.

Alpha strained against the stuck lever.  “It won’t budge!  Help me out!”

Following his command, we clenched at the handles, twisting it clockwise until we heard a click; we sped out the door, and slammed the heavy bastard shut.

The grass crunched against my bare feet, freezing the soles in the dead, starless night.  All of us flopped to the ground finally free of the nightmare.  All three of us sighed, letting all the stress pent up from our escape leave our bodies like steam rising from a boiling pot.

“I told you we would all make it out.” Alpha huffed.

I turned to my younger brother.  “Charlie? What say you?”

I blinked a few times and just like that, he was gone.  Scanning the nearby forest in front of the prison, he was nowhere to be found.  Slowly, I turned my head towards the outside of the cinderblock reinforced facility.

My heart sunk.  “Oh no…”  Without hesitating, I take off into the maze once more.  Something tugged on my arm.  Alpha.

“Bravo!  Don’t go back in there!  Let me save him!” He pleaded.

“I’m not letting you go in there without me!  Let’s get him together!”  All the fear left in me was now gone; it’d vanished like smoke in the wind.  In an instant, we pried open the door, running straight down, taking countless turn after countless turn.  We did everything we could to make sure we knew precisely where we were in the labyrinth.

Then, a scream echoed through the barren chambers from the west.  Right down the end of a corner was Charlie, squirming in the grasp of clawed bony hands.  Ebony skeletons, fused and packed tighter than tree rings, cracked and shifted under the pressure of each other, pressing and scratching away the chipping wall paint.

“You’ve helped me all my life.  Always been there for me.” I clenched a fist, charging right into the conglomerate’s form.  “Now it’s my turn to return the favor!”  I ripped my younger brother out of the clutches of the skeleton cluster, deep scratches from the bones cutting his arms.  He got up, brushing off the blood from his hands and extremities.  At the last second, a superficial slash from the claws of the beast went right across my chest.

This was not a fake.  That beast was the real deal.

We bolted for the door.  False walls passed by us, bony hands reached out and clawed at the ground and tore at the plaster.

The nurses’ tricks couldn’t fool us anymore.

The beast shrieked in rage as we forced the door shut, its spectral form pulsing back into the labyrinth.  It pounded against the reinforced door for several minutes, its anger venting through the forest as we ran through the deep brush lining the prison.

We continued running for several miles until our hips were at the point of shattering.  Soon, we finally come to a stop, running into a police station not too far from the edge of the woods.  Filing a police report was a no go, we could never get a name of that facility.  It had to be classified, somehow.

The police sent us to a hotel for us to stay for the night before we could collect our things at home.  For the rest of the night, we didn’t say a word to each other.  At one point, we gazed at our beaten faces, hoping we could find some joy in our faces.  All that showed up were looks of tiredness and worry.  And despite the luxury of the soft beds we slept on, nothing seemed right.  The only thing that brought me comfort was that we were all together and that I thought this nightmare would be all over.

\---

How wrong I was.  The first thing we did was sneak back into our house while our parents were asleep, reclaiming all our stuff and hitting the old dusty trail.  We ran off, far away from our parents’ house until we settled down at a homeless shelter.  But despite all the trauma we went through, we still stuck together.

All is not well, however.

If we stared off for a while, we could still see the shadow beasts still lurking right outside the outskirts of the city.  Whenever we went to investigate, there wouldn’t be a trace of their presence.  The only thing that brought me reassurance was that I knew that the true monster was still in the plaster labyrinth.  I did slam the door on it, preventing it from escaping, afterall.

Every now and then, my brothers would be right beside me, only to teleport to a location they weren’t in before.  Sometimes I even think that my brothers are still in the maze with the behemoth, possible even being murdered as I type this.

What did the nurses inject in me, anyway?

All I know is that it never left my body, and I don’t think it ever [will.](https://www.reddit.com/r/WeAreLegion/)
