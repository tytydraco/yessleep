In the summer leading up to my senior year of high school, I got my first job working at “Film Fanatics,” Clearview’s movie rental place.

It was a pretty sweet job. The work was simple, and you got a free rental every week. And besides re-shelving returns and checking people out at the front register, most of the “job” was just sitting around.

The only negative was that each shift only had one worker, so the downtime could get sort of boring.

A bonus was that, for the first month or so, things were pretty normal. That wasn’t a given in my town. The only thing that I found a little odd was the end cap that faced the register. It had a single shelf labeled “Ben Recommends,” and on the shelf sat two DVDs. Always two. Though the selection varied week to week.

Such a setup wouldn’t seem odd at a movie rental store if not for the fact that nobody named Ben worked at my store. I asked the workers who came in for the shift after mine, and they had no idea. I even asked Mr. Carson (whose name also isn’t Ben), the store’s owner. His answer was a little unsettling.

He leaned over and with a hushed voice said, “Best not to ask about that, Eliot.”

I didn’t know what to make of it, but it was such a small thing, I mostly forgot about it.

Still, since I basically had to stare at the shelf all day while I sat at the front desk, I couldn’t help but notice the titles on display.

And it was during our town’s annual 4th of July festival that I first noticed the connection between “Ben’s Recommendations” and the events going on around me.

I had volunteered to walk along the fire company’s float and throw candy out to the kids in the crowd. And as we were prepping everything before the parade, I overheard the fire chief talking to someone.

“It’s a shame we won’t be doing these anymore,” he said.

“What?” I interrupted.

“The mayor announced it earlier. Budget cuts. This will be the last parade.”

The two movies that were sitting on the shelf at Film Fanatics:

“Independence Day,” and “The Last Parade.”

I tried to justify it at first. Perhaps whoever was setting up the display just knew about the cancellation in advance.

But now that I was aware, the coincidences just kept happening.

A few weeks later, I was ringing up a customer and all of a sudden, the register died. No lights, nothing happened when I turned it off and back on, just *dead.* I finished the transaction in cash, logged the rental to enter it into the computer later and picked up the phone to call Mr. Carson. But as the phone was ringing, my eyes wandered over to the end-cap.

One of the movies on the shelf was titled: “Out of Order.”

Had that been there all day? I just didn’t remember.

Another time, I was checking out a particularly large customer. Despite the air conditioning, the man was sweating profusely, nearly soaking the movie jacket and the cash he handed me. It was pretty gross.

I was just finishing up with him when I looked over his shoulder and noticed the movie staring back at me:

“The Big One”

I let out a laugh.

“Excuse me?” the man said, looking offended.

I did my best to disguise it as a cough, apologized and prayed that he wouldn’t turn around and notice what I had seen.

Though it was funny, that particular instance was troubling, because I knew that movie had not been on the shelf earlier that day.

Still, what could I do about it? If anything, I thought, it could be helpful.

I didn’t know how right I was.

It was late September; the days were shorter, and because of school, all of my shifts were in the evening. I was taking over for Mr. Carson, who felt it necessary to tell me a little tidbit of news he had heard a few hours before. Someone had escaped from the state hospital. The police were out looking for him. It wasn’t comforting news at the beginning of a long, lonesome shift.

Within the first hour of work, a customer came in and immediately, I knew something was off. He was tall and thin—but not a healthy sort of thin. Veins pulsed in his neck as his eyes darted throughout the store. He was carrying one of those portable DVD players. This was the guy.

“Give me the best movie.” he said, his voice quavering

“What?”

“The best movie…”

I didn’t give much thought to his request. I really just wanted him gone. So I picked out *The Godfather,* and sent him on his way. I didn’t even check him out. I’d happily pay the cost to get him far away.

Happy to be done with that, I went on with my evening, uncomfortable and constantly checking out the front window. But, for the next four hours everything was fine. I finally started to relax a little.

It was just after nine, and I was sitting at the reception desk, leafing through a magazine waiting for the end of my shift. That’s when I heard something fall to the ground. Looking up, I noticed the “Ben Recommends” shelf only had one movie. The other had fallen to the floor, face down. I stood up and walked over to the fallen case, nerves churning in my stomach. Picking the movie off the floor, I finally saw the title:

“Run”

I didn’t think. I didn’t question it. I just bolted to the front door. But I was too late. The man from earlier was storming toward the entrance, his face full of crazed fury.

I scrambled back into the store when suddenly the lights went out.

The front door flew open, and the man unleashed a torrent of threats and swears.

“I’m going to kill you!” he screamed. “This was NOT the best movie!”

I ducked down between rows of movies, the dim glow from the exit sign painting everything a reddish hue. Trying to track the man’s location by his incessant screaming, I did my best to stay hidden, weaving between rows, working my way toward the exit.

But suddenly, the screaming stopped.

My heavy breathing sounded like a foghorn through the silence.

I tried desperately to keep quiet. To listen. But I couldn’t hear anything besides my own heartbeat and my ragged breaths, which just wouldn’t shut up.

I had to do something.

Slowly, I crept toward the end of an aisle and peeked around the corner.

A hand shot out and grabbed me by the throat.

The man hurled me to the ground and pinned me with his legs as both hands wrapped around my throat.

I tried to pull him off. I tried to punch and flail, but the man’s crazed strength was unlike anything I’d ever experienced. I couldn’t stop it.

My vision was fading along the periphery. And the last thing I would see is this man’s bulging eyes and manic grimace staring down at me.

Was this how I was going to die, because of a bad move recommendation?

Suddenly, the lights flashed on, and the burglar alarm sounded. Contrasted with the dark silence, this new state of things was jolting, even to me, who was in the process of having my life strangled away. The man shot his head up and loosened his grip. He looked around nervously, got up and rushed from the store.

I took a long moment to collect myself. I’m not too proud to say that I broke down in tears once I had registered everything. Fortunately, I had collected myself before the police cars appeared out front to investigate the alarm. The alarm that nobody had set off.

I reported what had happened to the police, and they stuck around as I locked up the store. As I was getting things together, I took another look at “Ben Recommends.” This time, there weren’t DVDs on the shelf at all. Instead, a solitary, unlabeled VHS tape.

I picked it up, threw it in my bag and headed home.

During my long discussion with my parents about what had happened, we got a call from a police officer reporting that the man who had attacked me had been apprehended. We all breathed easily.

But I wasn’t done thinking about all this. I dug our old VCR out of the basement and plugged it into the TV in my bedroom.

Nervously, I inserted the tape and watched the screen flicker to life.

It was footage from the security camera at work. It was me.

I saw myself restocking shelves, walking to and from the front desk. But then I saw someone else. Another guy around my age. At first, I thought it was a customer. But he too was organizing shelves. We were chatting. Laughing. At one point, the guy opened up a box of candy from the front register and shared some with me.

The only problem was, none of this ever happened. Or, at least I don’t remember it…

I watched myself working and interacting with this other guy in disbelief. Beyond my confusion, I was a little sad that I didn’t have a friend to spend those long shifts with.

After a while, the guy picked up a DVD from one of the shelves and walked over to the “Ben Recommends” end-cap. He placed the DVD on the shelf, turned to the camera with a big smile on his face and waved.

I could just make out the title of the movie.
