Weeks later I went to visit my parents. They lived at the other side of the country. I chose to drive. It’s very scenic, and I love the freedom it gives me.

 

While driving I thought of the blood donation. And how it hadn’t made big improvements to my dating life. More matches. But no dates. So it was definitely staying in the bio. But I was looking forward to trying my luck somewhere else in the country. Now I was going out of town anyway. How where the pictures of my abs not getting me more attention. My bio was also great. I had even found a natural way to sneak in how much money I was making. Who where the guys taking all my likes?

 

Cursing at the unfairness at display. I returned my focus too the driving.

 

The forests along the road where stunning. Driving through the mountainside made me smile. I thought about having a girl I could go for hikes with. That was the dream. Finding someone outdoorsy. I imagined walking uphill behind her. Looking at the vast expanses of trees and hills. I became rather blissful. Then another thought struck me. There must be very few gas stations out here. Looking at my dashboard I mumbled to myself.

 

“better safe than sorry..” I turned off the radio and comitted myself to finding the next gas station.

 

Taking my phone out from my pocket, I put it up infront of my face. I used voice commands to find the gps. I wasn’t getting into a wreck. That’s for damn sure. Once the application opened I put on my most robotic voice.

 

“gas station”

 

It repeated the sentiment back to me, in a pleasingly submissive tone. Assuring me it would find one close to me. A small line popped up on the screen.

 

“Start trip.” I commanded.

 

The screen zoomed in on the small arrow representing my car and I put my phone in it’s holder. Once again able to enjoy the scenery.

 

 

Pulling into the gas station I chose the pump closest to the main building. I wasn’t half way yet and I was already feeling dehydrated. The pump was self service. And for a moment I thought about avoiding the social interaction required to get a drink here. But as the tank was filling up I had a moment of quiet, and was forced to become aware of my body's needs. I chose to listen. I packed up and paid at the pump, turning towards the building.

 

Walking into the gas station I made quick eye contact with the cashier. Her eyes imidiatly flew off in some other direction. In retaliation I did the same. Walking to the fridges I cursed why all women had to be that same way. I picked a drink that advertised itself as full of vitamines. And shut the fridge door. The flourescent lights where tainting every product in the store. Even if any of it had been good quality, in here everything seemed like the bottom of the barrel. Even the floor seemed off. Maybe the lights where only here to mask how many teenagers had thrown up in the ailse. The acidic thaifood forever staining the interior and dooming the store to use air fresheners to mask the smell. I put my drink down at the counter. And went in my pockets to retive my credit card.

 

“Oh it is you!” I raised my head and met her gaze.

 

“Sorry I knew I recognised you when you walked in. How are you?” She picked up the drink and scanned it.

 

“Im fine thank you.” She looked at it’s label.

 

“Of cause you’re a health nut.” She quipped, and reestablished eye contact with me. I think my confusion was mistaken for something else, because she immediately dropped the smile from her face.

 

“Sorry. I didn’t, it was only stereotypical you know.” She put back the drink on the counter.

“nono It’s fine.” I laid my card on the chip reader.

 

“You just assume that nurses do whats best for them.” Now my confusion was total. The machine bibed.

 

“See you again next time.” Her smile returned. I picked up my drink.

 

“Yeah… Good day.” I turned and hurried for the exit. Who did she think I was?

 

Getting into my car I put the bottle in a holder and turned on the engine. Did I know her? I looked out the windshield into the gas station through the cheap one pane glass. I shook my head and pulled out from the gas station. Laying both it and the weird interaction behind me.

 

Much later I arrived at my parents place. I parked on the empty road in front of their house. Collecting my things I reached for the now empty bottle, reminding me of the interaction. I took it with me as I left the car.

Walking up to my parents front door a natural feeling of maturity hit me. I imagine childhood homes have that kind of effect on everyone. Reminding us how much we have grown. I rung the door bell. I could hear the chime through the door. I could hear my mothers voice from inside. I turned and looked out over the front garden. It’s so weird to me how people chose to have fruiting trees right next to the road. Enticing strangers and no doubt inviting trouble onto your doorstep.

 

I hear the door behind me. My father stands in the doorway, his reading glasses halfway down his nose. Newspaper still in hand.

 

“If it isn’t the man of the hour!” His wide mouth couldn’t hold back a smile. I was never sure if he found himself funny or important.

 

“Hey dad. What’s for dinner?” He stepped aside letting me come in.

 

“Ask your mother.” He turned away from the door.

“And close the door behind you.” He said while walking back towards the livingroom.

 

I did. After putting down my bag, I then untied my shoes and took the empty bottle with me to the kitchen.

 

“Hello Honey!” My mom was talking to me before I even turned into the kitchen. I swear the woman posseses omnipotence.

 

“Hi mom.” I went to the sink to throw out the bottle.

 

“Oh honey we got a new bin!”

“It’s over by the patio door.” She gestured with hands caked in some sort of… dough?

“I’m so glad to see you!” She used the opportunity to deliver a sincere message with eye contact. Something she knew I wasn’t that comfortable with.

“How was your trip?”

 

I walked towards the patio passing the door connecting kitchen and livingroom.

 

“It was long. I had to stop for some refreshments along the way.” I shook the empty bottle. She moved her head back to the food as I passed directly behind her. My father had once again returned to his recliner, where he found comfort behind his newspaper.

 

“Did you eat as well?” The question had a slightly mechanical sound to it. Like she was gaging my betrayal of her cooking abilities.

 

“Nono just staving of the dehydration.” I reached the metal monstrosity. It looked like something out of a warehouse. Stepping on the foot pedal I could see all the packaging from the food mom was preparing. I threw in the bottle.

 

“What’s for dinner?”

 

“Oh just a bunch of greens and a little bit of chicken. If I know you right, you aren’t eating as healthy as I would like you too.” She turned her head back towards me, a warm smile hiding motherly concern.

 

“People say I’m a health nut.” I smiled at her.

 

“HA!” Dad chimed in from the livingroom

“Who’s saying that?!”

 

“Matter of fact, the cashier from the gas station actually told me that today.” I replied authoritatively. Like she had been one of many.

 

“How would she know?” He put down the newspaper and looked into the kitchen at me and mom.

 

“She knew me from somewhere.” I simplified. Evidently unsatisfactory justification for both of them.

 

“Well where did she know you from?” The classic intrigue mom always had when I mentioned women.

 

“I’m not sure.”

 

“She was probably only saying it to get at some of your money son.” Dad haranged.

 

“Well you should have asked her. Then the mystery would have been solved already.” Mom ignored him.

 

“I just thought it was a bit… awkward.”

 

“You should go back there, maybe she’s sweet”

 

“What would he do with a girl working gas stations?”

 

“Well what where you doing with a bartender?” she turned to him with a death glare.

 

“That was different.” He muttered lifting his newspaper back up and disengaging from the conversation.

 

“How would I even know if she’s working?“

 

“Well if she’s around your age she’s probably working nights. Those are the most well paying hours and their often open schedules in the roster.” she had a small pause.

 

“Maybe she’s saving up for a trip or something explorative.” she winked at me. I joined dad in the livingroom. Contemplating the idea.

 

 

As the food was brought in form the kitchen me and dad went to sit at the dinner table. He was at the food before mom was even seated.

 

“So these are sweet potatoes with edamam beans, I’ve had the broccoli steamed before they joined the potatoes in the sauce…” I dosed of listening to the description of the food. She had placed herself behind dad, whom had stopped halfway through filling his plate. Her hands on his shoulders. She always insisted on presenting the meal. Even though everyone was hungry. I don’t know if dad put up with this every day.

 

“Who want’s to say grace?” She let go of his shoulders and went to her seat.

 

“Do we have too?” I asked.

 

“It’s tradition son.” Dad had put his elbows on the table and mom took her seat with hands already reaching out for ours. We locked hands, and she used her legs to push her chair closer to the table. Me and father met eyes before touching each other. The hand going to my mother was soft and inviting. The one to my father rough and strong.

 

Mom said grace, and we dug into the food.

 

“What have you been up too? We never here anything from our busy man.”

 

“Work’s been demanding. With all the data breaches and what not.”

 

“Keeping out the masses. Locking everything tight and making sure nothings stolen. Good job lad.” Dad interjected.

 

“I hope you aren’t working yourself too hard. Remember to take some breaks.” It was a retorical question.

“Speaking of! What else have you been up too.” She took a bite of her food. Leaving the air between us silent.

 

I scoured my brain for something that wasn’t tv or video games. I thought of the mess I had cleaned up weeks ago when donating blood.

 

“I’ve become a blood donor.”

 

“Ohh my little boy! Always helping others.”

 

“Don’t make him out to be some wus woman.”

 

“I did not!” She turned her attention to the man she married.

“Actually you could learn a thing or two from him. When did you last do something selfless?”

 

“I don’t have too. Simple as that.”  He continued eating. Stoic.

 

“I thought you where afraid of stuff like that..?” she ignored him. Returning to me.

 

“No mom.”

 

“Well think you know a fella.”

“How come you suddenly started doing that?”

 

I thought of the salesman.

 

“I saw an advertisement. Something about knowing your blood type and how much time it could save for surgeons working on you.”

 

“If you're afraid of getting into accidents you can always get some driving lessons from your old man.” He quipped. Laughing at his own joke.

 

“Donating doesn’t sound like such a bad choice now, huh dad.” Reacquiring his approval, we smiled at each other.

 

“I thought trauma surgeons always used universal blood..?” Moms questions left a silence in the air. I asked about the new trees in the front yard, and we finished eating.

 

As mom brought out the plates, dad retuned to his recliner and I went to my old room.

 

“There are some linenes on the bed, I thought you might want to do them yourself.”

 

“Thanks mom. See you guys tomorrow.” The food had made my system shut down completely. It must have been woefully ill-equipped to deal with so many fresh ingredients.

 

Making the bed I thought about how often I slept alone. And how lonely I felt doing it. How could such a necessary activity feel so shameful. I had many times wondered if people asked “did you sleep well?” Just too taunt me with the lack of women in my life.

Laying down in that room I thought of my highschool girlfriend. And how we never ended up doing anything. I thought of my mothers endorsement of the gas station girl. Maybe she was an outdoorsy type, like she had suggested. Tomorrow I would drive by the same station on my way home.
