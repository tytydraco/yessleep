The interior of the shack appeared slowly at first, its floor spinning and blurred. Weakly, I rose my head to find Samantha standing above my still unconscious father. She seemed strong, determined. Her frail, pale hand stretched, almost tenderly to the jaw furthest from her. In that moment, I foolishly thought that she had found forgiveness. Drawing her hand back and along his exposed neck, the thick red path that slowly followed the arrowhead pinched between her shaking fingers, brought reality into a screeching actuality.

I leapt from my seat and, cringing at the bronze thorns that bit into my hand, I brandished the Shear high above my head, prepared to bring it down upon the head of she who would murder my father.

Yet I was stopped by her expectant stare. Her eyes, not the same from their likeness that I stared at within my vision, met mine. Graceful, even while expecting an execution.

"What" I stuttered "What is it that you are doing?"

She faced me, waiting till my arm fell to my side. "It is thine father's fault."

"Need I remind you that he is thine also?"

"Thine or mine, it matters not" Her eyes held my own hostage. "Look what he, his father, and his father before hath done." She raised her arms weakly, allowing my gaze to fall upon the bloodbath that stank within my home. "The very people of this place walk lame and half-crazed, brainwashed by the visions of what is our inherited madness" Her voice remained calm, strong in its assuredness. "Hear you not the manic beatings your very door suffered not hours ago? It is you, it is he" she pointed to my gurgling father "It might have been me. That let them suffer, let them believe their pain is salvation, and not the appeasement of our forefather's visions."

My father's kicks grew near spastic and wild, anger flowed through the blood he held onto. "But" I whimpered "But these visions are shared not entirely through blood, but through the rosewater too. It is the two that allow us to peak at the devouring truth."

"Kenneth" She placed an arm on my shoulder, placing her visage in front of my dying father "I do not believe it so. Tell me that you do not see the odd, feel paranoia's grip, become infatuated with the peculiar and different."

I stared at the bloodied arrowhead, at the stove, at the space beneath my bed, and the space beneath my father's.

"That is hardly a diagnosis for the slipping of sanity, sister."

"Speak what you know to be true. Speak of what you realised last night, before you poisoned me and our father"

I felt my legs grow weak. We had distorted true gospel. I had known so much to be true, despite my years of hibernation within the contrary. "Father said, we made changes. Enough to save lives"

"Our family has tore those who shout for guidance, those who will return to your door, from the true path. from the path that is righteous" she inhaled, tears forming in her eyes. "My own mother defended our father's beliefs. Even as her head was slammed into the floorboards, and severed from her shoulders. She believed in Shearing. Believed that the pain she suffered, that I suffered, might bring paradise closer."

"It was the Scriptures that my father and I were taught too, we are not wholly to blame"

"Yet he taught you the very same he was taught, did he not?"

I gazed upon the quietening figure of my father, his jittering nearly unnoticeable. "Truth. He did"

"And his father too inherited his father's visions."

My father's eyes stared beyond me, toward the door, and as the seconds passed, I realised they did so unblinking.

"This rosewater. The same which you had me drink, the same with which you anointed me prior to my first vision"

"Yes?"

"May it be so that the visions conjured by it, was not so much caused by the same, but rather by its waters allowing us to explore our madness rather than resist it?"

"Speak plainly" I brushed her aside, and sat by my father's warm corpse.

"The rosewater, Kenneth. It is nothing. We trained ourselves to believe that it brought visions, when really it merely relaxed our guard enough that we might fully explore the nightmares of our fathers. Or perhaps it simply brought our attention to it?"

I took my father's hand from his throat, and intertwining his still moveable fingers with those on his other hand. Placed them across his chest. Dragging my fingers over his lids, so that his stare might cease.

"You speak as if you knew"

"Mother had not kept it a secret from me" Samantha answered. "She was proud of my father. Proud of the cloth that I had been cut from"

"I suffered no such vision until I drank from the Rosewater"

"I suffered none until you mixed a more concentrated anointment" Samantha exhaled "Mother stayed with me throughout the visions. I believe she had intentions of telling our father. Yet she always swore to the power of the anointment, of the Shearing. That it would allow the worthy to see beyond the veil"

"I know not what it be. Madness? Placebo? Hell on earth? I know not sister. For now, I only know that my father, and both of thine lie murdered."

There was a silence.

"What would you have us do?" I asked, my eyes blurry with tears.

"We cannot continue this Kenneth" Her voice was steadfast "The village cannot continue to believe in gospel based upon the insane."

I exhaled a pained breath "What is it that you suggest, sister?"
