Im sorry if this is rambling or a mess but im so tired.

I don't know how this is happening or what it means but I'm so scared. What if he finds me again? What if he gets me this time?

I have always had bad dreams. The first I remember was around 4 years old. I was being chased by a ball of scribbled and broken lines through a monopoly board. The houses nearly landing on me, the car running me over the thing ever getting closer.
   
   As the years went on the dreams got more elaborate and seemed to seep into the real world. I'd wake myself while running from this darkness only to find it at the foot of my bed. Sometimes it would be sitting like a person might, other times it spread and took up entire walls like it planned to swallow the whole room. 

When I reached my teen years things changed again. I started having nightmares in rotations. The first night I would be hiding from someone I knew was coming but I didn't know their names or really anything about them. Just that they scared me so bad I would eventually run away from my home and wake up right as I reached the forest near by. 

  The second night I would walk into my mothers room and she just told me "He's here." Over and over and over again while I screamed at her for answers. 

  The third night I would "wake up" in my bed and find my room door open. The hallway light on. I can hear noise down stairs, when I get to the hall all the other doors have been bricked over there is only the stairs left for me. When I get to the top if the stairs I am frozen. I can't move no matter how much I fight. The dark shadow slips round the bottom of the stairs. It turns to me slowly and asks "what is the number?". I can't answer. I can't speak. It takes a step up towards me. "What is the number?" I don't know! I try to think of any stupid number. Desperate to wake before that thing gets close but he takes another step. I scream in my mind and he runs at me. Like a flash he's up the stairs, hand on my throat squeezing as he growls. "What is the number?!" 

At that moment I would wake up sometimes I had simply woken up to repeat the nightmare again other times I had actually found consciousness. 

This series continued to repeat every night for months. I tried everything to avoid sleeping to avoid feeling his grip on my throat and that dead stare. 

By the time I was 17, lack of sleep and my experiments with substances, trying to stop dreaming, my mental health was bad. I ran away from home convinced the monster lived there and I would be safe anywhere else. 

I spent 3 years in bad situations but I did sleep. No monsters. No screaming. No dying over and over again. Just real flesh and bone monsters. I was rescued eventually from that but those stories are too many to add here.

All most as soon as I felt safe again the thing returned. This time it sent minions to hang me from butcherhooks for the roof or it would be in bed beside me listing all the ways it was looking forward to killing me. Or it had me trapped under a glass floor that slowly filled with the blood of my saviours as it murdered them one by one above me until I drowned. I would wake up so broken I couldn't move or speak. Just frozen in horror.

After a few months I found weed disruptes sleep and dreaming so I made it my mission to smoke enough every night that I didn't dream which has kept me safe for going on 15 years. 

However it came back last week. First it was trying to lure my child outside to it. Snatching at them everytime they went past a window or door. Then it would be waiting in the shadows whispering about how long it's been and how it missed the sound of my screams. 

  Today I woke from a nightmare I wasn't ready for.

 I had run away from home. And found myself in the middle of nowhere. Some random girl walked with me along country roads. We come across the ruins of a church theirs workers trying to restore it and I decide to have a look. At first everything was normal. A normal wooden structure, wooden pews and arcs. Some broken staind glass windows. We wonder around enjoying the sites when the shadows grab the girl and drag her away. I try to chase after her but a familiar paralysis has me. All I can hear are her screams echo. 

I can't do this. I dont want to sleep again. What does this thing want! I don't know what to do.
