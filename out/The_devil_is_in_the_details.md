\*\*\* The proof itself is in the anagram, after using this literary device for over a decade, I have come to learn that there are MANY misconceptions surrounding anagrams, the main one being that the "anagrammatist creates the anagram", which is not only false, but also creates the mental image that anagrams are mere linguistic feats of the imagination... If this is true then why, upon using the input for the anagram "Eleven plus two = Twelve plus one" into an anagram solver, that the same answers will appear time and time again? This effect can be viewed with every anagrammed word or phrase and it's because the results are literally imprinted within the anagrammatized input, meaning people don't just "create" anagrams, they are just searching for the correct combinations of what was already hidden beneath languages surface.

At age 6, as I were just about to turn seven, I had started my first couple of days at school, everything appeared to be moving on course at that age. I was in the habit of utilizing my time during school breaks and lunch times by simply laying down on the school yard and staring into that deep blue abyss up above, and in my imagination, I teetered on running the risks that one day I may fall into that very sky, crashing into it, to never return.

I remember being a happy child, and then, what appears to be one fated day, two other girls, along with myself, raised our hands to signal to the teacher that we needed to use the restroom. The teacher decided to allow all three of us to accompany each other as a small group, which must have seemed to be a smart idea to begin with, however, resulted in an everlasting upheaval in my own life.

We entered the restroom, and as I made my way to a cubicle I was interrupted by one of the young girls, who, without so much as a word, took me by my shoulders and started to vigorously shake me, this episode of shaking lasted long enough for the third girl in our group to use the toilet, wash her hands, then walk away. Stunned, I decided to forget using the lavatory and just make my way back to class.

Once again, the girl had come to disturb me during our yard break. She grabbed my shoulders and began shaking me all over again, but the final time she enacted this on me was at lunch time, on the school yard, all I remember of it was being too shy to call for help, and so, as that girl was shaking me and my head jolted back from the force she used to do so, all I remember is seeing the sky; inwardly, I politely parted ways with the sky that I used to ever so fervently imagine myself falling upwards into, before being swallowed into an unconscious state.

When I came to, I was trembling, I looked down at my hands and I couldn't understand what I was actually looking at, and I was drooling. A few seconds passed by, when I started to gather some of my bearings, realizing that something had gone drastically wrong, I ran inside of the school building, before the young girl could strike again, as I knew I needed some form of medical assistance.

When the teachers came back to me, saying that they would talk with that girl and prevent her from attacking me again, the tears ran hot from my eyes, because they didn't understand that I hadn't told them this to just "stop" her from doing this again, but because the damage had been done, and I needed help. Despite my protests, the teachers reassured me of the same thing. The following day, a teacher approached me and explained that the young girl who had attacked me was experiencing issues at home, and suggested we become friends, believing she had gotten two birds with one stone.

For the following couple of weeks, I could not decipher a single coherent thought within my mind, until, after I had turned seven, and that's when the voices began, and they never stopped, always whispering, "Yes, no, yes, no, yes, no, yes, no", as if they couldn't make their minds up. Life from then on, became overwhelmingly abysmal.

A year passes, the voices grew worse, and as the months went by, eventually, the voices came to a halt... There was a certain event in the world that passed by, whereby the more bloodthirsty voices stopped completely, as if those invisible forces -often a cause for tears- attacking my auditory senses were satiated.

In the wake of the violent voices' departure, a new, silent presence made itself known. Mere days after my eighth birthday, in the aftermath of 9/11, I settled into bed, ready for sleep. Yet, an uncanny sensation of being watched crept over me. As I sat up, I saw her—illuminated by the sickly orange glow of streetlights filtering through the slats of my partially open blinds.

A withered face, etched with excessive wrinkles, belonging to an ancient hag. My heart seized, blood turning to ice in my veins. This haggard apparition stood motionless at the foot of my bed, her very presence an affront to reality. I stared, transfixed with horror, silently willing her to vanish. But she remained, gesturing for me to follow with gnarled, spectral fingers. Summoning what little courage I possessed, I shook my head firmly before retreating beneath the covers.

I had hoped this nightmarish encounter would be an isolated incident. But she returned, night after relentless night, for an entire week. As her visits persisted, I felt my resolve, my ability to endure, begin to crumble under the weight of this supernatural siege.

Our nightly routine became a macabre dance—she would beckon, and I would defy, shaking my head before seeking refuge in the illusory safety of my blankets. This haunting ritual continued unabated for a year, each night a test of my sanity and fortitude.

Eventually, weary of this spectral standoff, I ceased waiting to feel her sunken eyes upon me. At bedtime, I would immediately burrow beneath the covers, refusing to acknowledge her ghastly form. Yet even unseen, her overwhelming presence consumed my bedroom, transforming my once-safe haven into a realm of perpetual dread.

Each night became an exercise in enduring terror. Sleep eluded me as I lay beneath the suffocating weight of my blankets, my own hot, panicked breath creating a stifling microclimate. Desperation eventually led to innovation—I began fashioning a small air tunnel along the wall, a lifeline to the cool, fresh air beyond my self-imposed prison.

I can't exactly remember how long I suffered under the gaze of the night hag, perhaps a year passed by before she no longer intruded during nocturnal hours... But I never did forget her, but more so, as I got older and gained access to the internet, I started searching the web for any sign of dream meanings relating to the old hag. Eventually I was granted a plethora of digitalized information, "Old Hag Syndrome", a form of sleep paralysis whereby many people, over the ages, spanning all coordinates of this Earth, had suffered under that old hag's gaze.

Soon enough, my symptoms of psychosis were flooding back in again, awarding me, after many months of professional observation, with a diagnosis of Schizophrenia, all because of a literary device that had, after over a decade of remaining under the radar of health professionals, seen to it that I would be caught out... Afterall, it had to happen eventually.

But with the diagnosis, came along a caveat of sorts, that despite my attempts to communicate, nobody would take me seriously, "delusional", "paranoid", "hallucinating", the positive group of symptoms have and I suspect, always will, held me back from reaching recognition from my peers.

And as for this literary device? Anagrams. There are many misconceptions surrounding the mysterious and esoteric nature of anagrammatism to this day, mainly held by people who have never sifted through the mountains of examples, or even tried their own hand at finding a clever result from anagrammatized input.

Sasha Nightingale = *sensing a hag, I halt.*

This anagram's specific wording holds eerie relevance. In sleep paralysis, victims typically sense the apparition before witnessing its form. The word "halt," meaning "a suspension of movement or activity," aptly describes the paralysis many experience during these visitations.
