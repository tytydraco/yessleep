March 13th, 2023.

We were trapped in our home eagerly awaiting what comes after. Maybe, just maybe, in another life, we could be free from this nightmare. 

We shivered and heard his deafening footsteps aching from outside the closet.

I peeked and saw his shadow, his monstrous shadow and his giant axe. We closed our eyes, footsteps continued, we heard the closet door creaking and opening.

And then…


-4 YEARS AGO-

24th of May, 2019. 

It was one hell of a day to be alive, I dropped my 9 year old sister off at school and it was our last day at school.

Finally, I could rest after academic hell and finally graduate soon, but little did I know, graduating would be the least of my worries.

The time was now 2:25 PM, and there was 5 minutes left until I finish school for good! But then, a power outage happened. 

I was the teacher’s pet and she sent me out in the halls to tell the principle the power was out in our class, but as soon as I went out the classroom, The door shut right behind me. The power then went off in the whole entire school.

-“Hey guys, open the door please! This isn’t funny!” I exclaimed. 

I heard something behind me and I looked back. Nothing was there.

I stepped towards the janitors closet where I heard the noise but then the door closed shut.

-“Is this some sort of prank?!” I said, this isn’t funny, I thought. I then looked at the window of the janitors closet to try and see if anything was inside then..

BAM!! I got scared when a hellish face appeared in the reflection, I bounced back.
What happened to my face?? Was that me or something from inside??!I touched my face to make sure nothing was there but then, I felt a surge of shock all over my body, I could swear I saw some goo coming from beneath the door but I blacked out.

I had a nightmare. I was in a hospital bed and saw some sort of goo creature smiling down at me, black goo. He wore a hat and held an axe.

His teeth looked like sharp bones, and his smile was wide. His jawline, very sharp.

He pulled out his axe and said “This is going to be so much fun!” And held it vertically facing my face and STRUCK IN MY LUNGS! I woke up in a cold sweat, I was inside a hospital, the doctors transported me to a surgery room.

I asked -“What happened? Why am I here”

The doctor said: “We’re gonna open your lungs!! They’re turning black!! You spat out some sort of black goo all over yourself!” 

I touched my face and it was a very slimy and gooey substance, black ofcourse. I realized, it was the man in my dream. He’s real. And he’s coming. 

-“Doctor, doctor, it’s a goo monster holding an axe!! I saw him in my dream!”

“Don’t be crazy!! This is serious, we don’t know what you took but we need to do this surgery now.”

-“Doctor, please believe me!! The lights went out and I saw him! In the janitors closet!! Search the janitors closet!”

“Listen kid, the power never went out, and the janitors closet door was open and nothing was in. You’re on some substance very obviously. We’re gonna insert some anesthesia now.”

-“WAIT NO!!! DON’T LEAVE ME WITH HIM! DON’T LEAVE ME WI….” Light faded from my eyes.

And there he was, once again.

“Hello, hello, hello. Looks like you survived that huh? I’ll make sure you never wake up again.”

He circled around the hospital bed with the pitch dark background surrounding him. 

“This time, i’ll make sure you die. How about an old fashioned chainsaw?”

-“ You don’t have to do this, please… What are you?!”

“I’m your worst nightmare. Now, don’t make this hard for me and try to stay silent. Or you’ll awake her. and trust me, you don’t wanna do that.”

-“Who is she?!”

“Get ready kid!! I’m going in!”

Slash. 

I woke up mid surgery, but couldn’t open my eyes. I only heard the doctors.

“Oh shit! He’s bleeding from his abdomen!! It’s like it was cut in half!! What the fuck happened to this kid! Holy shit I can’t take this!”

I blacked out once again. But this time, he wasn’t there. It was a beautiful woman, she looked like an angel, but she was made of black goo aswell.

She told me “hello sweetheart, sorry about him, he’s really mad about.. nothing, don’t worry about him. I’ve got good news and bad news, what do you want first?”

-“The good news”

“Alright, the good news is, i’m Alice, the Angel.
The bad news is, i’m a fucking devil.” Her hands transform into spikey claws and she digs in and feasts into my skin.

I wake up. The surgery was done.

The doctor said “Holy shit, this was quite the surgery, what the hell was up with this kid’s lungs and abdomen and chest?? Leaking black gooey stuff?”

I was taken in for questioning and ofcourse, nobody believed me and I was charged $2500 for possession of substances. Which I never had.

After that whole ordeal, I slept normally and nothing bad had happened. Until 1 day ago,

March 12th, 2023

My sister’s 13th birthday was tomorrow, it was gonna be a blast! I was preparing the party and I went to the grocery store to get balloons and everything. I walked in and something happened.

The power went out and the doors closed shut. Then, I saw a black goo leaking from the ceiling.

Oh shit.

Part2 coming soon.
