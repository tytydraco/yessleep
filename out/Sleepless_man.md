Lily had always been a bright, imaginative child, but lately, something had changed. It started one night when Diane awoke to her daughter’s terrified screams. She sprinted down the hall, heart pounding, and burst into Lily’s room.

Lily sat upright in bed, her tiny body trembling, eyes wide with terror. “Mommy,” she whispered, her voice shaking, “there’s a man in my room.”

Diane’s heart sank, but she forced a calm smile. “It was just a nightmare, sweetheart.” She checked under the bed, in the closet, and even secured the windows, though they’d been locked tight. “See? No one’s here. It was just your imagination.”

But Lily shook her head violently, her small fingers gripping the blanket. “He was here, Mommy. He just… stood there, in the corner. Watching me.”

Diane kissed her forehead and promised everything would be fine, but the next night, it happened again. And the night after that. Every night, Lily woke screaming about the man. Diane grew tired of the nightly routine, but what worried her more was the toll it was taking.

Within a week, Lily refused to sleep at all. She’d sit in her bed with bloodshot eyes, flinching at every creak in the house. The circles under her eyes darkened, her skin grew pale, and her hands shook constantly.

“Lily, this has to stop,” Diane snapped one morning after another sleepless night. “You’re making yourself sick. There’s no man.”

But Lily only whispered, “He’ll get me if I sleep.”

Diane didn’t know what to do. She tried warm baths, nightlights, even took Lily to a therapist, but nothing worked. The child was spiraling. Desperate and exhausted herself, Diane made a decision one night that she would regret for the rest of her life.

She crushed five sleeping pills into Lily’s warm milk, stirring until they dissolved. “Drink this, sweetie,” Diane said, forcing a smile. “It’ll help you feel better.”

Lily hesitated, staring at her mother with distrust, but the exhaustion finally won. She drank the milk slowly, her eyelids drooping almost immediately. Within minutes, she was asleep.

But she didn’t wake up.

The next morning, Diane shook her gently. “Lily, time to get up.” But there was no response. Panic rose in her chest. She called an ambulance, her hands trembling as paramedics examined her daughter.

“She’s in a mild coma,” the doctor later explained. “Her body’s fine, but… it’s like her mind is trapped somewhere else.”

Wracked with guilt, Diane brought Lily home after the hospital could do no more. She sat by her daughter’s bed day and night, whispering apologies, begging her to wake up.

But then, Diane started noticing things.

It began subtly—the feeling of being watched, the hairs on the back of her neck standing on end. She’d glance around the room, but no one was there. One night, as she dozed off in the chair beside Lily’s bed, she felt it: a cold presence, like ice in the room.

She opened her eyes.

In the corner of Lily’s room stood a man.

He was gaunt, his skin a sickly gray, with hollow, black eyes that seemed to suck in the light. He didn’t move. He just watched.

Diane’s breath caught in her throat. She flicked on the lamp, heart racing—but the corner was empty.

Shaking, she turned off the light again.

He was back. Closer this time.

Diane stopped sleeping. She couldn’t. Every time she closed her eyes, she saw him. Each night, he crept closer, until she could feel his cold breath on her skin. She started to understand the terror that had gripped Lily, but it was too late.

One night, as Diane sat beside her daughter’s still body, something changed. She felt a chill, colder than before. She turned to check the room, but the shadows felt heavier, like they were pressing down on her.

Then she noticed Lily’s eyes.

They were open.

At first, Diane felt relief—until she saw the emptiness in them. Lily’s eyes were wide, glassy, unblinking. And deep within that vacant stare, Diane saw him.

The man was inside her now. Watching Diane through Lily’s eyes.

Diane’s scream echoed through the empty house, but no one came.

Because the man had made sure no one would.
