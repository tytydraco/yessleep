Living on a farm in the middle of nowhere has plenty of advantages. During my life, I have seen tons of stealth bombers flying across the sky. I have always loved seeing these high-tech machines, until now.

Recently, the sky was full of strange, black dots floating really high, I could barely notice them. And these objects were just floating in one place. I had no idea what was happening, but they weren’t planes. One day, I counted 24 of them. 

Weeks went by like this, until one night, while I was working on the cornfield, I saw something falling from the sky. It looked like a small glowing ball. It fell near the house. 

I thought I was going crazy when I saw that fucking object. It was an eyeball. A yellow, glowing eyeball, around the size of an apple. And it was moving, it wasn’t connected to anything, but it fucking moved, and it was looking at me.

I questioned everything I knew before about the world as I tried to think of a logical explanation. Maybe it was just a remote-controlled drone or something…

It wasn’t. It was a fucking organic eyeball that was still alive despite it not being connected to any neural network or brain. After about half an hour of me standing there, I tried to somehow pick it up from the ground, but I couldn’t. It planted itself into the ground with some muscle strings, if that’s even possible. 

I was on the edge of fainting because of these unreal events, so I just went back to my farmhouse to sleep. It was a mistake. I should’ve destroyed that eye while I could.

When I went back to the same spot in the morning, there were more eyes there, at least a dozen of them. They grew out from the original eyeball, with a flesh-like string connecting them, forming a grotesque, horrifying web made out of eyes. All of them looked at me, with curious looks.

I spent all day on the internet trying to find any information about this thing, I hoped it was just some normal plant or animal, or strange parasite. Nothing. I didn’t find anything useful. I decided to talk about this with a professional the next time I visit the city. I also noticed that the floating things in the sky… drones, UFOs, spy balloons, or whatever they were, came closer…

That night while I was trying to sleep, I heard strange noises coming from outside. Some high-pitched static sound. And I think I saw green light from the window. 

The following morning, the entity or entities grew even larger. It reached my house and started to cover it like some kind of exotic plant from the rainforest. Hundreds of eyes… like an organic spy satellite from an alien world. Maybe those flying things in the sky are actually aliens, and they sent this eye-web entity to spy on me, I thought.

I took a few pictures of the thing, then drove to the city a few miles away. I visited the university to talk to a few professors there. 

I showed them the pictures, and they had the same reaction as me. They had never seen such a being before. One of them told me they had to inform some higher-ups about these discoveries, and they would send a team to the farm a few days later.

When I arrived back at the farm, it was already dark. As I expected, the entity grew even larger, covering half of the farmhouse. It was fucking terrifying, and those yellow, glowing eyes looked at me like I was stupid. 

I could barely open my door because of those fucking eyes covering it. I had a quick dinner, a shower, then I went to sleep. I kept thinking about these events for hours before I could fall asleep.

When I woke up around 4 AM, I froze immediately. The ceiling- the whole bedroom was full of these eyes. The web reached my bedroom, fucking hell, it was like a nightmare. 

Without thinking, I rushed out of the house. I had to kick the door a few times for it to open. The whole house was covered by this plant-like eyeball web. 

“Enough is enough,” I said. I grabbed my axe from the shed, then approached the house. The thousands of eyes were all looking at me as I walked closer with the axe in my hand. 

I raised the axe and started chopping the entity, cutting those flesh strings connecting the eyeballs together. The eyes started shaking, and they made a terrible screeching sound. Their yellow glow turned green. 

I guess it was a cry for help, as minutes after this, I could see the black objects floating in the sky coming closer and closer. They were huge. They were almost at ground level. Oh my god, they weren’t drones or spy balloons. They were something I couldn’t even imagine before.

They were big spheres, kinda looking like balloons, but were around the size of a small house. Each of them had around ten short but fat tentacles. And their body was full of apple-sized yellow eyes. The same eyes that grew on my house. 

One of those large creatures landed on my house, and destroyed it, along with the eye web that covered the building. 

I ran as fast as I could, as far away as I could. It took me about ten minutes to reach the edge of the forest. I had to kneel on the ground, I couldn’t run any further, I was out of breath. My phone rang.

“Hey, I’m \[REDACTED\] from the CIA,” the guy said on the phone. “The university notified me about a strange entity that you saw on your farm.”

“My house is destroyed,” I responded. “Those things from the sky… those things came down and destroyed everything.”

“I see, please calm down. We’ll take care of the incident.”

As soon as he said this, I heard a loud engine noise, then I saw six fighter jets flying across the sky with unreal speed.

“What will happen to me now? My home is destroyed.”

“Oh, you don’t have to worry about it anymore. We already tracked your location from your phone. I hope you understand, but this information can’t reach the public. A crew will be sent for you. Stay there.”

I knew I couldn’t stay. They wanted to kill me because I knew too much. I threw my phone at the ground, then ran even further. It was two days ago, and they still couldn’t find me. I managed to rent an apartment in the city. Now that I’m posting this, I’m sure they’ll find me. I don’t care anymore. I might die, but [everyone needs to know about this.](https://www.reddit.com/r/polgari/)
