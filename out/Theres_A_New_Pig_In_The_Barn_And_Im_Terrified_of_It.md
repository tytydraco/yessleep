I’ve never told anyone this before. Working at the slaughterhouse was awful. But what happened on the farm was much, much worse.

The work on the farm was always the same, but I remember those few days particularly well.
The blade slipped from my gloved hands, slick and red. It clattered on the solid dirt. I gripped the edges near my wrists and pulled them off like shed skin. The barn was hot. Sweat was dripping down my body and pooling on my palms, where the gloves used to be. The farm always smelled like ammonia and sweat and dirt. Sometimes after a fresh kill it smelled nearly sweet, like old pork. It was always unpleasant. I gagged when I thought of it.				
The pigs were really what made it so hot. Heat seeped from their large bodies in waves. I could feel it the second I entered the barn. They had thick skin, pale pink and covered in a thin layer of hair. Their eyes were black and shiny. They often held solid, intense emotion- fear, intelligence. I tried not to look at them too much. It made me uncomfortable.	

Farming wasn’t a violent business. Sure, I killed, but I wasn’t violent. Not like at the slaughterhouse. This job was different. Smaller demand and smaller supply meant time didn’t matter as much. I didn’t have to be so rough with the pigs if they didn’t cooperate. I didn’t get so mad, either.						 
My job was to take food to every pen, check their water, and help clean up. And when the time was right, when they needed to be sold, I would kill. I had been working at the farm for a while, when I found the fourth pig.

* * * 

That day, I came into the barn carrying a bucket of corn, soybeans, and barley. I balanced it against my chest and grunted. There were three pigs in every pen. There were forty-two pigs on the farm. Except today, in the pen looming ahead of me, there were four. I frowned. 		
At first I thought I had miscounted, but there was an extra pig here. Carefully, I set down the bucket. The first three I could recognize- if you could recognize a pig. Not that I knew them well, but simply that they were familiar and this fourth one was not.			
He was foul. He was looking directly at me. His body peeled with old skin and dried mud. Heat didn’t emit from him like the others. In fact, if only for a moment, I thought the air around him felt cold. He was large, and long, and his nose tilted downwards grotesquely. His eyes were black. They held no fear. It was a pig I had never seen before. 	

“I don’t think you’re supposed to be in here,” I murmured. The words were very slow when I said it. My tongue stuck to the roof of my mouth and I took a short breath. No pigs had been killed today, but I thought I could smell something sweet.	

Before I could empty the bucket, the fourth pig began to choke. He struggled with a noise in his throat. It wasn’t anything like what the pigs usually sounded like. I was used to hearing them, it was the only sound on the farm. I heard it so much I thought it must have been trapped in the barn walls, and in the clothes I wore to work, staining everything like smoke.	
I knew I would never forget it. The sighs, the squeals, the grunts those pigs made. But the sound I heard now was different from all of that. It sounded strained. It sounded like it hurt. It was a low pitched squeal followed by an organic scraping sound. It was hoarse and harsh, and reminded me of gagging.			 

I knew what a pig larynx looked like- I had dissected one in highschool, far before I knew I would end up killing them for a living. It’s wide, white meat. The vocal folds are narrow, slit-like, and not made for the kind of noise this pig was attempting to make. 		
A thought came to mind and I frowned. ‘This pig was trying to talk.’ The pig kept opening and closing his mouth so I could see the red and black gums inside. Saliva was falling between his crooked, yellowed teeth. I immediately looked away.  				
‘Maybe this pig was trying to talk.’ I dismissed the thought. I picked the bucket up again and made my way to a pen a few feet away. I could still hear the fourth pig making that sound. It was louder now. I could hear it above the rest of the pigs.

* * *

That night I thought of the slaughterhouse. I needed to know if I had seen something like it before. The fourth one in a pen for three. I needed to know if I had ever met a pig like that. Most of my memories of my old work were fuzzy- I had only been nineteen when I first took the job. 		
In the slaughterhouse there was only metal and blood. The air stank of warmth and iron. It stuck inside my lungs like an intruder. I could taste it. Even over all the bleach they were using, I could still smell it. 					

Everyone was in a hurry, and everyone was angry. A lot of them didn’t want to admit how angry they really were. They had to keep moving, there was all this pressure to get things done. The animals had to move. It didn’t matter what the workers did to make that happen. 
The pigs were lifted by their back legs. They would be trembling- they were always trembling. But then they were stunned with electricity and shot once in the head. And after all that, the pigs needed to be scalded. They were submerged in boiling water till everything turned soft. The skin, hair, and filth scraped off in loose chunks.
I quit my job at the slaughterhouse when a coworker killed his wife. He took her steam iron and struck her on the head. I didn’t know what happened after that. I didn’t know my coworkers' thoughts, or what he did when he was finished, or how long the trial took. But I knew the man had been too angry to stop there, and when the police came for him, she was only exposed meat.				 
I knew a violent place creates violent things. And I knew I had to leave.			

That’s why I didn’t work at the slaughterhouse anymore. That’s why I tried not to think about it too much, about what could have been, or why I was still killing pigs. The rest of my night was restless with unpleasant memories. But I knew for sure this was my first time seeing a pig like that.

* * * 

The next morning was too hot. My skin stung in the air, and sweat dripped down my back and forehead. The fourth pig was still there. He was looking at me when I entered the barn. He didn’t stop looking at me until I stood in front of the pen. And only then did I see the other pigs. 
They were in a pile in the corner. They were scrambling on top of each other like rats, and their high-pitched squeals clustered together like screams. They had pushed themselves against the wire fence, so it left dark red marks in their thick skin. They were trying to get away. They were terrified.					

Sweat fell down my back. I hated the sensation- it reminded me of spiders, or a person running their fingers down my spine. The feed bucket nearly slipped from my hands, but I caught it. I didn’t want to spend any more time here than I had to. I wanted to get far away from this pen, and the pig inside, as soon as possible.	

“You’re still here, huh?” I said. It was hard to say again. I didn’t want to talk too loudly. I told myself it was because I didn’t want the other workers to hear me, but truthfully, it was the way the pig was looking at me. That solid emotion was there, but it was different from the other pigs. He didn’t look afraid. 				
I didn’t want to talk to this animal. It made me feel uncomfortable. But I still lowered my eyes to the ground and murmured “I don’t think you’re supposed to be here.”		
I looked up again when the choking started. It was just like the day before, it was retching, opening its mouth wider and wider. It was making that noise again.
“What . . are . . . Y-ou?”

I jumped back. My wide eyes landed on the pig. The pig opened his mouth. The scraping noise was still coming from his throat. The voice was low and rasping, the rasp of a person who hasn’t talked in a long, long time.									The pig had spoken.

“What’s . . Wr-ong, farmer?” When the fourth pig talked it was horrible. The words were slow, and every syllable was drawn out. He took breaths between every word, deep and heavy. He kept pausing. I thought it was very difficult for him to speak. Sounds like that are not meant to be made by the larynx of a pig. 	
I wanted to believe I was dreaming. Or hallucinating. I thought to myself I’m dreaming, but the words got stuck in part of my brain and didn’t form right, like an unborn child. The thought died just as it began to live. 							
Something about this experience was too solid, it was here. The fourth pig was here, and I was in the barn, and that awful choking sound started again when the pig continued to speak.	
“You look afr . . afraid”			

I tried not to focus on what the pig said. I didn’t want to acknowledge it. I turned my head desperately and searched for the other workers. I wasn’t the only one on the farm. I couldn’t have been. But the barn was empty. 	
The other pigs in the pen screamed louder, and this sound quickly spiraled out into the other pens, until one after the other every pig in the barn was pushing against the wire fences and screaming. I could still hear the fourth pig talk. The noise from the other pigs would not save me.							 

I couldn’t hear anyone outside. There was work to be done, there should have been hammering and yelling and there should have been other workers. Where were the other workers?

I carefully took a step back. I peered through the barn doors but I couldn’t see anything except the dirt. I took another step. I had to find someone. If I took another worker back with me, I could say ‘Look, there are too many pigs in here. This fourth one has to go.’ And they could get rid of it. Or at least I would have a witness. I took another step back. I was trying to make distance between me and the pig.		

“Are you . . s-ure you want to leave . . me alone . . . with them?” The pig asked.

“What . . “ I stopped. I looked back at him, inside his deep black eyes. At the teeth jutting from beneath his snout. I hated talking to the pig. I didn’t feel like I should listen to him at all. “What do you mean?”				

“Aren’t . . . you sc- scared I’ll . . . I’ll leave the pen?” The pig replied in that deep, low rasp. “Aren’t . . . you sc- scared . . . of wh- wh-” The pig inhaled suddenly. It was a wet, guttural gasp. “Aren’t you scared . . of what I’ll do . . to the other pigs?”					

I froze. I could feel my heart beating. I couldn’t hear it above the rest of the pigs, but I knew it was beating awfully fast. It shook my entire body. I wanted to doubt. I wanted this all to feel far away, and hazy, like the dream it had to have been. But I didn’t feel any of that. All I felt was the uncanny realness of this pig in front of me. 
I flinched as a figure entered the barn. Her head was tilted low so the brim of her hat obscured her face. When she tilted it back up her eyes were narrowed. The other worker squinted at the pig pens with disgust and confusion.	

“Why are the pigs making that noise, Church?” She asked me. I looked at her. Then at the dirt, and back to the pig pen. I was trying to count the pigs inside but they were moving too quickly, it was just body after body. And it was too loud. The words wouldn’t stick in my head. But I had to count because I couldn’t tell if the fourth pig was there anymore, there was too much happening and I didn’t know if he was still in the pen.			

“I don’t . . I . .“ I started to speak but my words trailed off. If the pig had left, where did he go? How did he get out?		

“Are you . . okay?” The worker asked. She was looking at me with narrowed eyes, her eyes switching between me and the pig pens. 

I nodded.				

“You seem scared. So do the pigs. Did something happen? Was there some sort of predator in here? Fox or something?”			
“No,” I whispered, and didn’t say another word.						
“Oh . . . Okay.” The worker cleared her throat and looked away from the pig pens. “You seem pretty shaken up. You’re not sick, are you?” 							
I shook my head.			

“Huh. Well, how ‘bout you ask about going home for the day? Make sure you aren’t coming down with something.”					

I didn’t know what to say. I wanted to nod, or agree with her, but I couldn’t bring myself to say anything. I was too busy thinking about the pigs. I was too busy thinking about my own throat, and the way I talked. The fourth pig had known language. He knew words, he could form sentences. He shouldn’t have been able to. Me and the pig shared the same speech. 					
“Yes,” I finally murmured. “I’ll go home.”

* * *

That night, I thought of the slaughterhouse again. I didn’t mean to, but I couldn’t stop thinking about the fourth pig. About the way I talked, the way I moved, and the screaming of the other pigs in the barn. The screaming, and the panic, was what really got me thinking about it.				

Metal on metal is a horrible sound. The lights in the slaughterhouse were long and white, on high metal ceilings with towering metal beams. The walls were metal too. The floors were concrete. Pig meat hung in rows on sharp metal hooks. They were flayed- you could see red muscle and white fat, and the only way you could really tell it was a pig were the hooves at the end of the feet. They were only supposed to shoot the animals once, straight to the head. But sometimes that wasn’t the case. Pigs were always coming back mutilated. Shot too many times and bathed in blood. Snouts cut off, ears torn, skin hacked away in jagged pieces. The pigs had made the workers mad, and they couldn’t control themselves. Or maybe some of them did it just for fun. Just because they could.		

What I really believed is my coworkers did these things because it was encouraged. Violence everyday does bad things to a person. It becomes easier. What may have once been considered unthinkable might not seem so bad anymore.					 
I had asked a man I worked with why he hurt the pigs. I said: ‘Where’s your decency?’ And the man said: ‘There ain’t any room for it in a place like this.’

It was rough work- and not just for the pigs. People get into the meat industry because they’re desperate. There was no stopping in the slaughterhouse, not even if someone got hurt. There was too much pressure to get things done. 	The scene was common, I had seen it almost everyday- they needed the pigs to go faster because they were running out of time, but they kept slipping in their own blood, and in the blood of the ones there before them. Then the workers got angry in the pressure and the heat and the big metal walls, and bad things happened to the pigs or the people. There was meaning in metal and blood.

* * *

The next morning I was prepared. I couldn’t shake the horror that came with the pig, but this time I expected it. I was ready for it.		 
The barn was silent. The pigs stood still in their pens. They moved stiffly. Abnormally. They had moved too much the day before, screamed too loudly, and now their bodies were spent and their mouths could not make a sound. 	
I came to the pen with the fourth pig. But the other pigs inside were gone. Their absence made me uncomfortable. So did the silence. 

So I stepped closer and told the remaining pig, the last pig, “You’re behind the fence. What are you going to do?”			

“Nothing.” Replied the pig.		

“Yes,” I jeered. “Because you are behind the fence.”							

The more the pig talked, the more I realized he sounded like a sick person. I thought the pig must have felt his own throat scrape against itself, and the uncomfortable rawness it left behind.					 

“I’m not scared,” I said finally, because I wasn’t sure what else to say. My hands shook when I said this.				

“N-o?” Croaked the last pig. His black eyes were staring up at me. They were as dark and deep as the sea.					

“No. ‘Cause I’ve decided something.” I took a step towards him. Cold shed from the pig in waves. “You can’t be a pig. You’re something else.”					

“Oh ye . . yeah?”				

“Yeah. Pigs can’t talk.”					

“Is . . . that wh-at . . separates humans and animals? Speech?”						

“No.” I thought for a moment. But I wasn’t really thinking about the answer to the pig’s question. I was thinking about how me and the last pig spoke the same words. Our mouths built the same sounds. Our brains both knew the right noises to make, the right way to move teeth and tongue. We shared the same language, and this made me uncomfortable. 
“It’s intelligence. Emotion.”		

“Yes . . . but many animals are . . intelligent. Intelligent enough to love . . and to be afraid.” Then he had to stop. He took in deep, panting breaths. Each time he inhaled there was a quiet whistling noise. The pig opened his mouth, and only now did I realize thin blood was beginning to show on the pig’s teeth. 				
The pig inhaled, and said, “Intelligent enough to know what will happen to them here. So what really . . . separates you . . from them?”	

And I said, “Why do you keep saying them like you aren’t one?”

The last pig didn’t say anything after that. So I took a deep breath- when I did this I realized the smell in the barn had changed, it no longer smelled like blood or sweat or ammonia, but there was an overwhelming sweetness- and I asked “Where did they go? Where are the other three pigs?” 			

“. . I didn’t know you . . . cared about the pigs.”								
“I don’t.”					

“Then why . . . do you . . ask?”			

“Because this is wrong. Because something very bad has happened and . . .” I let my words trail off. I wouldn’t allow myself to talk more about the bad things, not to the pig. “It’s my job. I’m a farmer.”			

“Are you sure?”				

I looked down at my hands. I felt faint. I felt unnatural. My hands had begun to morph together into something tough and gray and abnormal. They looked like hooves. I shut my eyes. A wail grew in my throat but I swallowed it down, letting the sound dissolve behind my teeth. The sweet smell was choking me.						
I looked again and unfurled my hands from fists. That’s why they had looked like hooves to me, I was bending my fingers too tightly, I was clenching my hands into fists. This is what I told myself. I was going to leave work early. I went to the barn door and didn’t look back. I couldn't see the last pig anymore because he was too far away. He was just another animal now, in a sea of live, pink meat.	
But it wasn’t meat I was thinking about. It was the speech I shared with the pig. Language was once debated as an indication of humanity. Ancient people talked about a savage race with the heads of dogs. It was argued if they were considered human or not, because though their bodies were human, they only spoke in wails. 
	
“Will  y-ou kill me . . when the day comes?” The pig called out one last time. 

“Will you be able to, Farmer?” 

* * *

 I couldn’t stop thinking about it. The blood in the pig’s mouth, the things he said. The silence of the barn. Could I avoid going back to work tomorrow? Was there even a point if the pig would occupy my thoughts? If it would haunt me like an old ghost, if it stuck to me like the cries of the pigs I’d heard for years?				
I was sick from thinking about it. It made me sick. I needed something to take my mind off of it, so I sat down for dinner. I took a meal from my freezer- gray pork and diced carrots. My knife cut through it slowly, like rubber. Eating wasn’t heavy on my mind but my stomach was empty and my mind was disturbed. 				

I took a bite. I hated the way my teeth sank into it. My chewing was too loud. The more I ate, the more disgusting it became to me. I couldn’t stop thinking about the last pig.	 I imagined the meat pulsing like breath. Nausea grew in my stomach, so I chose to look at an empty spot on my plate instead. 

The surface of the plate produced a dull reflection. What gazed back was a barely visible picture. It was my own body, malformed and blurred and repulsive. This reflection, this wretched mirror of myself, revealed a long gray shape. Four limbs that ended with cloven points. It had large black eyes.					
This wasn’t my body. I looked down at my hands and my legs and saw that I was still the same. I didn’t bother to look at the reflection again, or at the meat on my plate.	

I stood from my chair. The movement was clumsy and stiff. Dull panic grew, spreading through my chest and paralyzing me. A new fear was born in me. It was born whole and alive. Maybe this was my fate, some horrific irony- I was turning into an animal. But not a pig. It wouldn’t be a pig.							

The rest of the night was a fog of unease and sleep. I dreamt about men with the heads of pigs, who only spoke in riddles and knew human language. I also thought about the slaughterhouse- I wished I was still there. 
Pigs never talked in the slaughterhouse.

* * *

The next morning I thought better about what to say. I thought I needed to confront it. Stand up to it. I wasn’t the same as a pig. I was above it. Wind stirred the dirt around the barn. I used to hear quiet sounds all the time, what could slip past the squeals of the pigs. 				
The faint, slow drag of hooves. The creaking of the old wood walls. The distant conversation of other workers. But it occurred to me I never heard any of that anymore. I should have. The pigs didn't cry. The entire barn held its breath.						
“H- How do . . you feel?” The pig asked once I had come to him. “The only one . . in the barn. The only w- worker among pigs. Do you feel big? Do you feel scared?”		

“I’m above you,” I told the pig. I stood in front of the pen, far emptier than it should have been. I thought I might feel better if I said it out loud. “You’re just an animal.”							
“So y- ou feel big, huh . . . ?” The last pig stared at me for a longer moment. The light glinted off his eyes. Then the pig opened his mouth, and there was a small scratching sound, and the pig said in that low, rasping voice:	
“If you’re s- so different from . . . the animals . . why did k- killing pigs make you . . . think you’d kill a person? Why did you quit the
s-laughterhouse, Church?”				 

The pig was looking at me with dark amusement. It dawned on me that the pig’s eyes made me think of something- beetles. The little black ones who came when the pigs died and the body wasn’t cleaned up quick enough. When the sweet smell began to stain the barn. Only there weren’t any beetles, and no pigs were killed, and the smell had been there for days.								
“You say you’re just a pig,” I began. After that I would raise my voice. Only if I could muster it, in that quietness. I was above him. “Well then, I dissected your kind in biology class. We opened your brain and cut your veins, and none of it mattered because you’re only an animal.”					
The pig stared back with his beetle eyes. “Yeah? Is . . . that right? What happens if one of these days something . . comes to you, something bigger than you, and . . . it decides you’re only an animal?” He began to gag, and that whistling noise got worse. The last pig opened his mouth again. There was blood on his teeth. It was dripping out his mouth in thin, wet strings.							
“I don’t think you should talk anymore,” I said.						
“S . . Sick of hearing . . . from me?” More blood fell. It stained his pink skin and crooked snout.								
“Your body isn’t built to make words. You aren’t supposed to speak.”				

“Well I . . . “ The pig took a breath. “Am.” 							

I grit my teeth. “You know what I think?” My body buzzed with an angry anxiety. I was clenching my fists again. I tried not to look at my hands too much. “I don’t think you are a pig. I’ve told you before, but I mean it. You’re not.”							
The pig made a noise. It was another choking sound, but higher pitched. I thought he was trying to laugh. “Is . . that right? Then tell me . . . Farmer. What am I?”		

“You’re one of those bigger things you talked about.”						

The pig looked at me and tried to laugh again. His large black eyes burned into mine, and his mouth turned up. It was almost a smile. Almost. “I . . am . . . a pig.”				

“No,” I growled. “You’re not. I don’t know if you’re something in the body of a pig, or just something that looks like one. But whatever you are, it’s not a pig. Tell me what you are.”							
“I’m a p- ig.” The last pig stuttered. His jaw made a clicking sound on the last word. I was worried the pig would keep talking until something bad happened to his body. Until more blood came or his throat was torn to shreds.							 
I wasn’t worried about the pig- in fact, I should rejoice if this awful thing fell apart in bloody, raw pieces. But I didn’t want to see it. I didn’t want to be the witness. I had killed pigs before, but I knew the sight of this pig’s death would be unbearable.
“Tell me what you are!” I repeated. I did not know what else to say.	

“I’m a pig!” The last pig cried out. 

“Tell me what you are!” I yelled. I was afraid. I was very, very afraid. But my mind was trapped in the idea of something wrong with this pig, because what kind of animal could learn to talk? What kind of thing would imitate an animal?

“I’m a pig!”					

I didn’t know what would happen once the pig answered, once he told me what he was. The idea was horrible to me, vile even. This wasn’t a question I wanted to ask. These weren’t answers I wanted to know. 			
Tell me what you are, I almost said it again. But I really couldn’t bring myself to. I was too scared to ask again, and I was too scared to get an answer. I didn’t want to talk to the pig anymore because speech belongs to humans. But violence- now, what is more present in nature? Violence is a trait for the animals.							
I raised my hand and hit the pig. My palm struck that crooked, downturned snout, and it made too loud of a sound. It rang out through the barn which was still silent. It hadn’t been silent in all the years I had worked there, but it was silent with the presence of the last pig.		
The voices of the others died when this animal learned to speak. But the barn wasn’t silent in that moment, because my hand against the skin of the last pig made too loud of a sound. When I hit the pig, it occurred to me that humans share this violence.			

The pig fell to the ground heavy, and it fell fast. It fell like something dead.	
In the place of the last pig was shapeless red meat. There was nothing left but slabs of raw pork. There was no animal, there was only gore. And the air had never smelled so sweet.								
A figure had entered the barn again. “Church?” The other worker called out. Her voice was strange. “Why are all the pigs so quiet, Church?”
