"No, I don't believe it's a ghost Garret.”

“Oswald thinks it's one, the guy who hanged himself has his fingerprints on a corpse that died much later than he did, exactly two days after his passing.”

“Who the hell is Oswald?”

“Just an interesting guy I met, was a bit thirsty so I headed down to a bar. A retired sailor, now a bartender but a bit cheeky, tried to sell me crack till I revealed I was a cop, I let it slide though.”

“Anyway I'm already in Wolverhampton and I'm meeting up with someone to hitch a ferry at Liverpool, I'll be in time for dinner when I get there.”

“Sure Arthur, I'll await you at the port.”

Many say Castletown was a peculiar place, though not much folk tales were spread around. I have heard of stories of ghosts and haunted spirits, yet those are usual in many places around the world.

Some say there are still the spirits of navy personnel whom have died to drowning, or despondent folks that succumbed to their harsh conditions and moved on, but thats the United Kingdom for you.

After I have stepped on the ferry the fog started to engulf the environment as we stray further from land, the waves crash on the hull whilst the soft rain pours on the deck, there were a plentiful of passengers, all looking woebegone and sickly, some of the women wearing cowls shivering from the cold whilst the men read their newspapers and huff on their cigarettes.

I meet the captain whom I have a connection with, a sixty something years old who’s close to having a beard that looks like snow.

“Arthur! Thought I left you at the port!” The old man wheezes after he glanced at me.

“Hey cap, glad you took my uncle’s call about the situation, this case was only apprised to me 3 days ago.”

“No worries, anyways why couldn't they just call their local investigators? Sure most can be dumb there due to the ocean sickness but not that dumb.”

“Apparently they believe in ghosts in that town, that's why my close co worker informed me about the situation and even recommended me to the local sheriff, since he knows Im anything but superstitious.”

“Oh yeah that new talk of the town, I've been hearing this story through my fellow skippers coming from Castletown.”

“What do you know about it, cap?”

“Well one of them, probably Jerry, told me that this ghost was a normal guy but totally a crackhead, only after his death did he crave the blood.” He scratched his beard for a while, and then fixed his brown ascot.

“It's something to do with his mental state, now the UK isn't exactly the most joyful place to be in, the gray skies, almost always rains, but that man was something else.”

“Damn that's rough, did he have any family, maybe friends?”

“Not that I know of.” he then slowly tilted his head to face me.

“You don't know what you’re going into Arthur my boy, it's better to leave things unexplained, than live with the repercussions of it.”

—------------------------------------------

“So Garret, anything?”

Garret takes the cider and tips the bartender. “I have learned that the ghost is named Emerson Woles, a local fisherman  who has a daughter that lives near Port Soderick, they lived in a slum, we could maybe find the culprit for the killings through her?”

“By asking if the corpse is somehow moving, Garret?”

“Arthur, stop being snarky about the ghost. All I’m saying is Emerson’s daughter might be the key to finding the guy who’s using Emerson’s name in vain to cover his.”

“All I know is, if this works Im paying for your next cider.”

We leave the bar, going to Port Soderick to find the ghost’s daughter. “Do we even know that the people we are investigating is alive?”

“We gotta try Arthur, the sheriff said someone has been tampering with the documents, probably trying to hide the bread crumbs.”

“Also is there a name for the first victim?”

“We can't even identify who it is, the body is so mangled up any traces of the victim’s face is next to nothing, it’s an unbelievable sight.”

Garret pulled out photos from the crime scene and it was really something, it almost didn't look like a body with it’s torso opened and limbs contorted.

“You should keep it for now.” I said to Garret.

—------------------------------------------

We leave the bus and step in an antiquated town, the dense fog still immersing the surroundings. Lanterns were the only thing bright that kept the passersby still able to see where they were heading, while it being the only warmth at the cold port.

“Here it is, Arthur.” Garret pulled a flashlight from his bag.

“What’s that for?”

“We’re heading down that alley.”

Rats swarm away as I step into a puddle dirtier than the streets of London, broken tents from the sides looked like it was lived on, and a strong, lingering smell can be traced to the wooden door that’s in front of us. “So Garret, shall I knock?”

“You go Arthur, maybe call in for backup?”

“Yeah that’s what I've been thinking.”

And to our true suspicions, the body of… some woman?

“What? This isn't Margaret. She doesn’t match the pictures at the station.”

“Backup is already coming.”

Gnarly sight it was, legs dark from the dry blood coming from the chops that went through the shins, her lifeless eyes staring at the open window, limbs twisted in several ways, and the moon light shining upon her hair.

“This body looks old Arthur.”

“Looks like it was done a day ago, not that old but certainly not fresh.”

“The fingerprints on the gun was herself, it’s most likely suicide.”

The sheriff waves the papers revealing the extracted fingerprints from the gun handle. “And you were right, it was possibly a day ago from the looks of it.”

“And we also found this.” The sheriff held out a half empty bag of coke, “We also analyzed it and it doesn't have fingerprints on it, must’ve faded away so it hasn't been touched in a long time as it was well hidden under the floorboards.”

“Did you identify the woman?”

“Daisy Imy, a housekeeper, daughter of Oswald Imy the bartender down Ronaldsway.”

—------------------------------------------

In the interrogation room was a clearly terrified Oswald, with the sheriff and Garret at the other side of the window.

“What? I didn't know anything about this!” Oswald was shook by the recent news, almost sobbing but pushed those tears back to look composed.

“I'm glad I met you much earlier Oswald, it was much easier to find you knowing where you were.” Said Garret.

“Now let's get straight to the point, what did your daughter have to do with the Woles?”

“My daughter has nothing to do with this, Woles’ daughter was dead already at that point!” Oswald was visibly outraged by our claim.

“What do you mean by that?”

“Woles lost her daughter at the age of twenty to suicide, that was like four or five months ago and he was nearing retirement age so he thought of selling his house in exchange for a retirement home, but I guess that didn’t work out after he hanged himself.” 

“You seem to know alot about the Woles, Oswald.”

“You are right, he’s a business partner I should say.”

“Thank you, Oswald, for taking your time.”

Out of the interrogation room I slammed the files down and said to Garret “This is not making any sense.”

“Yeah I know Arthur but we’ll find a lead it’ll make a clear picture after th-”

“Look Oswald is not telling the whole truth, half baked old fuck.” I grabbed the papers that the sheriff pulled from a file cabinet and saw a background check for Oswald.

“Distribution of drugs?” 

Oswald was a drug pusher, supplier of Castletown, and highly likely had Emerson Woles as one of those buyers. From their small home in the slums it's clear that the Woles family was poor and never had enough money to sustain themselves, let alone sustain an addiction.

Some point in time Woles ran out of money, but had his daughter, this may be a jump but there could have been some kind of “deal” they have made, Emerson with his daughter, and drugs, leading to her suicide.

Now with that on Oswald’s conscious he decides to buy off Emerson’s house to hide his acts together with his daughter Daisy, whom have now permanently stayed, and my educated guess was he recommended Emerson to stay in a retirement home because of how absurd the claim is that Emerson wants to be in that reeking place than his own home.

What Oswald was not expecting however, was Garret finding him and not knowing he'll be one of the detectives on the case.

It still doesn't explain the deaths, Daisy, she did not have any reason to kill herself, and the start of this whole investigation, the body with his fingerprints on it.

Days before he died, unless.

And just before I had to explain everything, we saw Oswald, head ripped clean off, with a staring husk of what formerly was Emerson Woles.
