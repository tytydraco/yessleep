Please, someone, help me. I am still determining where I am. It started when my friends and I were exploring this old abandoned building, just looking for something to do. Brandon and Adam were ahead of me, and we were making our way down a dark hallway.

Then, I felt my foot give way, and I fell through a hole in the ground. I landed hard on the concrete below, and when I looked up, God, I knew something was wrong. The walls were a pale yellow color, and the fluorescent lights flickered overhead. There was a constant hum in the air, like the sound of a million electrical currents running through the walls.

I called out to Brandon and Adam, but they didn't answer. I started to feel a growing sense of unease as I wandered through the endless maze of identical rooms. It was like I was in a nightmare, and I couldn't wake up.

Hours, or maybe it was days, passed as I wandered through these sickening yellow rooms., trying to find a way out. I didn't see anyone else, just the same yellow fucking walls and flickering lights. It was like a never-ending labyrinth, and I couldn't escape.

After what felt like a couple of days, I stumbled upon Brandon and Adam. They were just as confused as I was, and we stuck together, hoping to find a way out. As we explored, the feeling of unease grew stronger. It was like we were being watched, like something was following us.

We found a staircase that led us down to another level. This one was even darker and more moist than the last. It smelled like mildew and damp concrete.

And that's when we saw it. The creature. Fuck, it was nothing but a floating, horrifying toothy smile. It didn't have a body or a face, just that horrible smile. We froze, unable to move, as it floated closer to us.

Brandon and Adam tried to run, but it was too late. The creature was too fast. It enveloped them in its jaws, I could hear their screams as it devoured them. Each bone I heard a snap, and I could swear I heard it fucking giggle when it was done swallowing my friends. I'm probably going insane.

I don't know how I managed to escape, I just found a fire exit. When I went through it, I was back in the mono-yellow rooms. And now, I'm stuck here, lost in this endless maze. I found a small signal to post this, but I don't know if anyone will see it.

Please, if you're reading this, help me. I don't want to be stuck here forever, wandering these halls with that disturbing, smiling creature lurking around every corner. I don't know what to do, or how to get out. But I'm scared, and I need help, I can't take it anymore, I can’t even kill myself. I refuse to let the damn smiling demon thing kill me.

Update: My phone's clock is still frozen at 5:35 on May 5th, the day I fell into this wretched place. It feels like I've been trapped here for an eternity, but I know it can't be that long. It must only be a few days, maybe a week, at most. But time doesn't seem to work the same way in this place.

I've been wandering these halls for what feels like thousands of miles, but I haven't found anything. Just the same yellow walls, flickering lights, and the occasional disgusting gnawing noise of the smiling creature. Every time I hear it, I run. I don't want to face that thing again.

But there's one thing that's kept me going. I found a source of minty-flavored water in one of the rooms. It's the only thing that calms me down and fuels me. I stashed a lot of it in my backpack where I kept my spraypaint. I don't know where it's coming from or how it got here, but I'm grateful for it.

I've tried to mark my path with symbols and drawings, but it's hard to keep track of where I've been. Everything looks the same, and the longer I'm here, the more my memory starts to fade.

I don't know how much longer I can keep going like this. I'm tired, hungry, and scared. But I can't give up. I have to keep searching for a way out.

I hope someone finds this message, and if you do, please help me. I don't want to be stuck here forever.

Update 2: It's been a while since I posted my last update. I'm still lost in this endless maze, but I've made some discoveries.

I found a few rooms with purple lights, and sometimes, there are rooms with red lights. In those rooms, the carpet turns to epoxy concrete. It's strange, but at least it's a change from the endless yellow walls and flickering lights.

I also discovered something interesting about the yellow wallpaper. If I rip it away, I can harvest some of the paper to fold it up and create a somewhat comfortable place to sleep. It's not much, but it's better than sleeping on the hard concrete floor, or the damp reeking carpet. After a while, some faceless workers repair the wallpaper, but they do not speak or seem to acknowledge me.

I've been working on a plan to try and reach the ceiling tiles by stacking my wallpaper over time. I don't know if it'll work, but it's worth a shot. Maybe there are electrical wires I can use to power my phone, or maybe a stronger signal, anything that can help me get out of here.

But I'm running out of hope. Every day is the same, and I feel like I'm losing my mind. I try to remind myself that time works differently here, that it hasn't been as long as it feels, but it's hard to hold on to that idea.

If anyone is reading this, please help me. I don't want to be stuck in this place forever.

Update 3: It's been a while since I last updated this, but I wanted to conserve my phone's battery. I've been wandering for what seems like forever, and I finally found a door. It led me to an empty library, and at first, I was excited because it had a sign that said "The end is near." But my hopes were quickly crushed when I turned back and realized the side I came from was now endless. The sign was right all along.

The only thing in the room was a 90's looking computer on a wooden desk. I tried to turn it on, but it was stuck on a blue screen that said "The end is near" over and over. It was giving me the creeps, so I decided to check out the air vent in the ceiling. But before I did that, I had to look for more of the minty water. My supply was running low, and I only had two bottles left.

I searched for hours until I found a room with a few bottles of the water. I took them and headed back to the library. I stacked some books and climbed up to the vent, and luckily, it was big enough for me to crawl through. I've been crawling in the vents for hours now, and I have no idea where I am. I can hear the creature's gnawing sounds again, and it's making me nervous.

I don't know what to do. I feel like I've been here for months, but my phone's clock is still frozen at 5:35 on May 5th. I'm running out of options, and I'm starting to lose hope. If anyone is out there, please help me.

&#x200B;

Update 4: Okay, so, the air vent led me to a foggy field of tall grass that was just below my waist. I had no signal the entire time I was there, but I walked for what felt like months, saving every drop of the water I could.

After like 4 months, I stumbled upon a strange hilly place with houses that looked weirdly uncanny. They were like something out of a dream, but at least they were a change from the endless, sterile halls of the yellow maze. I decided to stay in one of the houses, hoping to find some answers.

Inside, I found a fridge full of the minty-flavored water that had sustained me for so long in the psychosis-inducing yellow rooms. It was a relief to have a steady supply, but at the same time, I couldn't shake the feeling that this was some kind of trap.

Despite my uneasiness, I continued to stay in the house, exploring the strange hilly landscape outside. The houses all looked the same, and there was no sign of life anywhere. I couldn't even tell if it was day or night despite the sun being out.

The longer I stay, the more uneasy I feel. It’s like the air is thin, like on top of a mountain. Every time I open the fridge to get a bottle of water, I feel like I'm being watched.

I don't know how long I've stayed here. Days? Weeks? Months? It all feels like a blur. All I know is that I have to get out of there before whatever was watching me decided to make its move. I have to find a way back to the real world, no matter what it takes.

&#x200B;

Update 5: It's been a while since I last updated. My phone was at 23%, and I had to conserve my battery. I was becoming increasingly uneasy with the feeling of constantly being watched. I wandered the vast town, searching for any signs of life or a way out.

That's when I stumbled upon a house with a red light seeping out of the windows. I hesitated before entering, but my curiosity got the best of me. Inside, I found myself in an abandoned hospital, with red lights and alarms blaring. I looked behind me to see four of the disgusting, smiling creatures levitating toward me. I ran through the hospital for what felt like at least three hours, dodging the creatures at every corner.

Finally, I entered a door at the end of a dead-end hall, which led me back into the original mono-yellow maze I was originally placed. I was furious; I had gone through all that trouble to end up back where I started. I can't help but feel like this place is mocking me like it's playing some twisted game with me.

I will keep searching for a way out, but I fear that I may be stuck here forever. The thought of never seeing my sister again is almost too much to bear. I think I’m beginning to hallucinate.

&#x200B;

Update 6:  It’s been maybe six months since I updated last, at least in your time. My phone is at 3%. I am writing this as my final goodbye. I am hearing my sister's voice, and it's driving me insane. I’ve looked everywhere, and I can't find the source. I give up. I’m ending it soon with nothing but a bottle cap, the same bottlecap from the unlabeled minty-flavored water that's kept me alive.

Goodbye, all,

Cody Leeman
