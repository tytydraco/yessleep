This is another one of my experiences with the paranormal. It happened in the same location as the last encounter I shared. Dustin's house. This time, we were hanging out in his garage. It was myself, Dustin, and two of our other closest friends. Brandon and Drew. 

The four of us were all gathered in Dustin's garage, simply hanging out and talking about all matter of high school problems. During the talk, Dustin had made his way to the opposite side of the garage, next to the garage door. The three of us hadn't noticed that this was strategic on Dustin's part. See, there was another light switch in the garage, right next to the garage door. 

Dustin had hatched a scheme to scare us by suddenly turning the lights out in the middle of our conversation. It was near midnight, and we were already wound up. It was guaranteed to leave us in complete darkness. However, this didn't go his way or our way either. None of us knew what was going to happen that night.

So, Dustin turned out the lights. It startled us at first, but we quickly realized it was Dustin trying to scare us. We asked multiple times for him to turn the lights back on. He responded with poorly acted confusion. He eventually turned them back on for us. The lights in his garage were very bright. We were blinded for a second and had to let our eyes adjust to the light. That's when we saw it.

For some strange reason, when the lights came back on, the three of us on the opposite side from Dustin were all facing the same way. We all faced the wall opposite the garage door. It was painted wait, so it made this very noticeable to us. We saw a black handprint that was slightly faded. Just this lone handprint. Now, that may seem like it's easily explainable. Which it definitely could be. However, what happened next, can't be. 

The three of us mumbled to each other for a second. All asking if we remembered seeing that handprint before the lights went out. We all agreed that we hadn't. Dustin asked what was going on, and we told him we saw a black handprint. He must have thought we were joking because he didn't take us seriously at all. He turned the lights out on us again. This time, we reacted with a little more anger, telling him to turn the lights back on. 

He tried to joke around with us, but we weren't in a joking mood. He caught the hint and turned the lights back on. When our eyes adjusted to the light again, we saw them. Multiple black handprints. All overlapping each other in a horizontal straight line. Leading from one wall to the next. Every wall in the garage now had a line of overlapped black handprints. They were surrounding us. It looked as though something or someone had been running on all fours, horizontally around us. Circling us. 

Dustin saw them as well. The feeling of terror and panic set in for all of us. We trampled over one another, trying to escape the garage. Drew pushed his hands and his head into my back, ramming me through the door into the house. The three of us spilled onto Dustin's living room floor. We couldn't catch our breath and kept shouting nonsense to each other, trying to make sense of what had just happened. We all had a hard time calming down. We tried to convince ourselves that it didn't even happen and that we only thought that we had seen the handprints. 

However, when we mustered the courage to check. We were greeted with the handprints still being there. The garage then became a restricted area for us when we all hung out. The only time we would go back in was to try and do our own investigating. We never cleaned the handprints off. I'm not sure if it was out of fear of angering whatever had left them or if it was a reminder that it did happen. Either way, it is still one of the craziest experiences I've ever had, and it will always stick with me.
