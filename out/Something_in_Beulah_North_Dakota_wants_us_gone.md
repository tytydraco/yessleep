Hey everyone, I know this may all sound outlandish, and I’m gonna keep this story relatively short, I don’t know how much time I have before they’re back at the door and I have to shut off all lights, even phone screens, so there is no chance of them seeing me here.

As a brief backstory, my fiance and our 6 year old daughter moved to North Dakota looking for work from Missouri.  We were used to the city life and thought the quiet change of pace would be nice.  We were told before we came by people who lived in the area that we may not be incredibly welcomed here.  Everyone was already set in their ways, and would find us to be outsiders.  This may be more important than I thought, but I digress.  We didn’t mind, we aren’t super social people anyway.  The town here is about ten years behind everywhere else I’ve lived, there are no real amenities, and it is SUPER boring.  But it works for a young family starting over.  At least, it did.  I’ve been here for 6 months and until very recently, things have been working just fine.  Until very recently..

Now, as I said, I knew people here weren’t known for their friendliness.  That much was obvious, and though small talk with strangers or even “friends” is non existent, you get used to it.  But now?  Now, someone is watching us..

It started 6 nights ago.  There’s a huge open field across from my apartment complex.  And there are hardly any people around, so it’s constantly full of everyone from coyotes to mountain lions to small rabbits.  I sit out on my balcony a lot at night and listen to nature.  It calls me down like no other.  Anyway, 6 nights ago, I’d just gotten my daughter down to bed and stepped out for a smoke and to wind down from a long day.  It didn’t take me long to notice the shadow in the tree line.  It was definitely human, but sort of slouched over, like a hunchback on steroids sort of posture.  I’m 5’11 and it looked slightly taller than me.  This was about 50 feet out in the dead of night though, so I can’t say for sure.  It never said a word or made any gesture, just sort of stood there swaying and watching the apartments.  I  watched for a couple of minutes before my daughter woke up from a coughing fit.  I ran into comfort her and honestly almost forgot about it for about 35 minutes.  By the time I remembered, it was nowhere in site.  I’m new here, I gave it the benefit of the doubt and thought maybe an old farmer was out in his field.  So I let it go and didn’t give it much thought.

Two nights later, I took about a ten minute walk to Dollar General for a few groceries.  I do this damn near weekly.  There’s a long, dark road that leads from the main road in front of the store down towards my apartment.  When I got down it, and turned towards my front door to walk up the small hill in the front yard, I heard a very faint cough from behind me, from the far end of the road.  At the top of it were three people.  Again, this is all in the dead of night, and there aren’t many stars out here, so I can only see their shadows.  I recognized the guy from the field a couple nights prior, being flanked by two other figures AT LEAST 6 inches taller than him.     As soon as I looked in their direction, they very, VERY slowly started walking down the hill in my direction.  I instantly felt so damn uneasy and turned and ran, locking my doors behind me and shutting off every light.  To my horror, as I watched from my living room window, they stopped and lined up directly in front of the apartment, all clearly looking up towards my window.  After a few seconds, as if something had spooked them, they turned simultaneously and ran into the field I had seen the man in the first night.  I did get law enforcement involved, but they did a VERY brief search with their flashlights and almost seemed dismissive.  Almost frustrated, telling me to call if I saw them again but to make sure they were truly a threat before I wasted “town resources and time.”  

Now, before tonight, the last few days had been mostly event less, as far as seeing anyone is concerned.  We have heard a few knocks we thought were on our door, and the doorbell has rang a few times to no one on the other side.  But I’m logical, and these are old apartments.  Maybe the wiring was faulty?  It didn’t seem like a big deal.  Not until about 20 minutes ago.

My daughter has been sick on and off the last few weeks, so she’s been sleeping a lot more and taking longer naps to make up for the energy that’s being drained with all the couching and vomiting.  She went down even earlier than usual tonight, so I figured I could get some house cleaning done.  I finished the kitchen and was getting ready to use the restroom when I heard the most God-awful screaming coming from her room.  I rushed in to find her terrified and shaking, tears streaming.  I picked her up in a hug to see what was wrong and she said “Daddy I don’t want you to go.”  I said, “what are you talking about?  You know Daddy’s never going anywhere.  Her reply stopped my heart.

“Daddy, I was having a bad dream and the mean people from the cornfield said they don’t want us here and that they’ve been trying to come take you with them to the field but you never answer the door.”

I  just got off the phone with the local police, who are again irritated and said to “stop calling this station if you don’t have a real reason to talk.”  I put all of my savings into getting us here, and am miles away from being able to afford a trip back home.  For the time being, I’m stuck here and doesn’t look like I’m gonna have any help until these “people from the cornfield” actually get to one of us and do something awful.  I’ll keep everyone updated in the coming nights, I just didn’t want to deal with the shit alone anymore..
