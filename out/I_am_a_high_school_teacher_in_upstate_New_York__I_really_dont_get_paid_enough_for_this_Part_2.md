It was the end of the school day, and the halls were finally quiet. Papers graded, lights off, another day done. Outside, the dark had settled in — that thick kind of dark that even a seasoned hunter has to squint through.

That damn comment from last night still lingered in the back of my head — something about running myself ragged, about instincts, and family interest. It shouldn’t have stuck with me, but it did. Maybe because they weren’t wrong.

I locked the door behind me and stepped out into the cold. My breath fogged under the parking lot lights, the only halos for miles. My Jeep waited, half-buried in snow, same spot as always. I gave the hood a small pat as I walked by — habit more than anything. Mom used to let me sit in the passenger seat when she drove this thing down back roads to track monsters. Back then, it felt like an adventure. Now it just feels like debt.

The heater coughed when I started the engine. I gripped the wheel, eyes half on the road, half on the thoughts I kept trying to bury. The city at night was mostly empty — snow-muted, pale streetlights bleeding into fog.

I told myself I was just driving home. That I wasn’t working tonight. But my bones said otherwise. Something under the skin wouldn’t sit still. It wasn’t nerves. It was older than that — the kind of warning your body knows before your brain catches up.

I rolled the window down a crack and leaned out. The air was sharp enough to sting my throat, but there was something beneath it — faint, familiar.

A scent.

My pulse quickened.

I knew it. That same stench — copper, fur, and something foully sweet — close to the one that had hung over my father’s body. It couldn’t be the same creature. I’d killed that thing. Or thought I had. But the scar on my side burned like it disagreed.

Without thinking, I turned the Jeep toward the smell, tires whispering against snow-slick asphalt. The scent led me into an alley behind the closed hardware store, where the streetlight hummed like a bad memory. I shut the engine off and got out, the night pressing close around me.

My dress shoes crunched through ice. I knelt, pulled my pant leg up, and slid the hunting knife free from its sheath around my ankle. The silver glinted dully, the edge worn but clean. I could feel my pulse in my palm, a low rhythm that wasn’t entirely human.

Then I saw it.

A shape hunched between two dumpsters — tall, broad, breathing slow. When it turned its head, the yellow of its eyes caught the light, and for a heartbeat, I thought I was staring into my own reflection through warped glass.

It stepped forward. Not lumbering — deliberate. Muscles rippling under coarse fur, the outline of a man buried beneath the beast.

A shifter. A werewolf.

And then it spoke.

“You shouldn’t smell like us,” it rasped. The voice was wet stone grinding against itself, human words pulled through an animal’s throat.

My hand tightened on the knife. “You shouldn’t be here.”

It tilted its head, almost curious. “Neither should you.”

Before I could answer, it lunged. I dodged sideways, boots skidding on ice. Its claws grazed my shoulder — fire lanced down my arm. I caught its forearm, slammed the blade into its ribs, and felt muscle give way. The creature roared, more in anger than pain, and threw me against the wall hard enough to rattle my teeth.

My knife clattered across the pavement.

The werewolf loomed, breath hot and reeking of iron. “You hunt what you are,” it growled. “Do you even know which side of the leash you’re on?”

Something deep in my chest answered with a sound I didn’t recognize — half a snarl, half a shiver. My vision blurred around the edges, senses flaring sharper. The world pulsed with scent and heat and movement. For a moment, I wanted to drop the human pretense — to meet its challenge with claws, not steel.

I forced my hands to stay human. Forced breath through my teeth.

When it lunged again, I rolled under, caught the knife, and drove it up into the joint of its shoulder. Silver hit bone, and the creature screamed — a sound that split the night like tearing fabric. It whipped around, slashing, catching my side. Hot blood spilled across my shirt.

I kicked its leg out and shoved it backward. It staggered, one arm limp, eyes flickering between hate and something close to pity.

“You can’t kill me,” it said quietly. “Not without killing yourself.”

The words hit deeper than the wound.

I didn’t answer. Just shoved the knife in again — deeper, until its breath hitched and stopped. It fell hard, heavy, leaving a wet smear across the alley.

For a long time, I just stood there, panting, listening to the faint ring in my ears. My side burned, and I pressed a hand to it — warm blood against cold skin.

When I looked down, the werewolf’s body was already starting to change. For thinning, bones are shifting. A man lay where the creature had fallen. His face was young. Too young.

The smell still lingered, though — that same copper tang. The same one that haunted me every time I dreamed of the forest.

I wiped the blade clean on my sleeve, sheathed it, and limped back toward the Jeep. My hand shook as I reached for the door handle. The reflection in the window looked off — the eyes too pale, the teeth too sharp.

I blinked. It was gone.

The scar on my side pulsed again, in time with the heartbeat that wasn’t entirely mine.


---

I was grinding my teeth by the time I pulled into the driveway, every muscle trembling. The adrenaline had burned off, leaving nothing but pain and that hollow ringing in my head. My side throbbed where the claws had hit — deep enough to make me lightheaded, but not deep enough to kill me.

I sat there for a while, staring at the steering wheel, watching the blood soak through my shirt. The smell of it made my stomach twist. When I finally pushed the door open, the cold hit like a slap. I stumbled up the stairs to my apartment, hands shaking, vision tunneling.

Flashes kept cutting through the haze — my father’s face, that creature’s eyes, the sound of its voice. It hadn’t looked that old. Hell, it could’ve been my age.

I slammed the apartment door behind me, not caring if the neighbors heard. The room was dark except for the weak yellow light bleeding in from the street. I grabbed the bottle of vodka off the counter, twisted the cap off, and drank. Hard. The burn kept me awake. Kept me from thinking too much about the blood still dripping onto the floor.

By the time the bottle was half-empty, the wound had started to close. The bleeding stopped first, then the edges of the gash drew together, slow but sure. I told myself it was a shock. Or luck. Anything but what it really was.

I’d done the right thing tonight. That’s what I kept telling myself. Over and over, until the words felt like sandpaper in my mouth.

But I’d seen its eyes at the end. The way it looked at me — scared, not monstrous. And I couldn’t shake the thought: what if it had a family? A wife? Kids waiting for someone who wasn’t coming home?

The lie cracked somewhere in the middle of that thought. My throat tightened, and before I knew it, I was crying — the kind of shaking, ugly crying that tears something loose inside you. It had been years since I’d let myself do that.

The empty bottle slipped from my hand and hit the floor, rolling under the couch. I wiped my face and stared at the ceiling until the shadows started to move on their own.

The scent of the wolf still lingered — in the room, in my clothes, under my skin. I knew it was connected to the first one. The one that killed my father. The one I killed.

Maybe this was its kin. Maybe I’d just finished what it started.

Either way, I’d destroyed another family tonight.

I lay down, still dressed, staring at the dark window. The city outside was silent. My heart wouldn’t slow down. My skin wouldn’t stop itching.

Another night without sleep.
