***\[Transcript Begins\]***

&#x200B;

**Young:** I’m ready to begin when you are, Mrs. Dee. Please, take your time.

&#x200B;

**Dee:** Thank you I… I’m sorry, this is just difficult to discuss. It’s still relatively fresh and I don’t… I’m still not sure how to properly explain it all.

&#x200B;

**Young:** That’s alright. You came to us regarding the death of your husband, right? Can you tell me about him?

&#x200B;

**Dee:** Yes… Wally was a good man. We were… we were married almost fifty years, you know. He was so sweet… even after all those years, he was very sweet on me. Every time I looked into his eyes, I could see the love in them. I could always see the love in his eyes whenever he looked at me. It always reminded me just how lucky I was to have him. Even after his memory started to go, he never lost that look in his eye. Have you ever lost someone you love to Alzheimer's, Miss Young?

&#x200B;

**Young:** Not to Alzheimer’s… no.

&#x200B;

**Dee:** But you have lost someone?

&#x200B;

**Young:** Yes. My mother. Cancer… I… I can’t imagine losing a spouse though.

&#x200B;

**Dee:** Pain is pain, Miss Young. Neither is greater or less. You understand, don’t you?

&#x200B;

**Young:** Yes… yeah, I do…

&#x200B;

**Dee:** You can probably imagine what it was like, watching him die slowly. Watching more and more of him fade away each and every day. Watching the man I loved crumble into something… else… still him in the ways that mattered, but not him in so many others. Looping conversations, memories that just weren’t there… and the day to day forgetfulness. 

&#x200B;

Every time I spoke to him, it was just another painful reminder of what he wasn’t, anymore… it was hard… and I wanted to help him so bad. I just wanted to find something to help him, something to bring him back to the way he was, something to stop the disease from taking any more of him away from me… it’s why I went to Magnuson.

&#x200B;

**Young:** Magnuson?

&#x200B;

**Dee:** Dr. Jeremiah Magnuson. I had heard of him online. People would sometimes claim he’d cured them of various conditions. I didn’t believe it at first, but as I grew… desperate… I started to look into it. I knew I was just grasping at straws, looking for something to believe in and I knew that Magnuson was probably at best just a snake oil salesman. But there comes a point where the desperation will drive you to just believe anything, no matter how stupid it might be. And when I started looking into him, Magnuson did seem… reputable. Unorthodox, but reputable.

&#x200B;

**Young:** Can you elaborate on that? What exactly did you find?

&#x200B;

**Dee:** Testimonials from former patients, claiming that his herbal medicine had cured them of serious conditions. Cancer, HIV even Alzheimer’s… there were quite a few of them. I brought it up with our son, and he said they were probably just paid ads… but there were so many of them from so many different people. It was hard to imagine he’d paid for all of these ads. Looking back, maybe that should have been my first warning sign. 

&#x200B;

Looking back, I do recall that the people giving those testimonies all had a similar demeanor to them… the same inflections… but I didn’t think about that at the time. I saw positive testimonials and no one speaking out against him. No one I could find called Dr. Magnuson a fraud. Everyone I saw online said he was legitimate and so… I reached out. There was a phone number on his website. I called it. A young woman took my information and told me that Dr. Magnuson would be in touch. 

&#x200B;

A week later, he called me back. I explained my situation to him and we did an online consultation. It was a video call. He looked exactly like his photograph. Tall, medium length dark hair, and a pleasant smile. He had a very kind, gentle voice. He listened as I explained everything to him and he told me he knew exactly how to help.

&#x200B;

**Young:** What exactly did he suggest?

&#x200B;

**Dee:** There was this medication he offered. He said we could try it free of charge. It was some herbal supplement or other… he did explain a bit about it to me, but I don’t recall exactly what he said. Something about how it only grew on some mountain in the Holy Land, and had some biblical connections or something… I’ve never been a religious woman, so I don’t know about all of that. All I know is that he promised me something and I was desperate enough to try it.

&#x200B;

**Young:** So this medication… he sent it to you?

&#x200B;

**Dee:** He did, and I gave it to Wally. Dr. Magnuson had promised that I would see results within a few days, but I was willing to give it even longer. I didn’t need to. Within three days, Wally was more like his old self than he’d been in years! His memory was still spotty, but it was better and he was energetic! He was up and about all the time! I could barely keep up with him! I almost got to thinking that this stuff had really worked.

&#x200B;

**Young:** I can see why… so… where did it all go wrong?

&#x200B;

**Dee:** Well it took some time… around a month. He’d been getting better, but his memory started to go again. He was still full of energy and enthusiasm, but he became quieter. When I spoke to him, he took longer to respond and the responses he gave slowly became less… coherent…

&#x200B;

**Young:** Coherent?

&#x200B;

**Dee:** I’d ask him what he wanted for supper, and after staring blankly into space for a while, he’d give me this confused look and go: *“Is it dinner or suppertime?”* as if he didn’t comprehend those were the same thing. He stopped sleeping too… I had to guide him to bed once after he’d been up for 48 hours straight. He’d just stared down at the mattress and asked me: *“Where have we gone now?”* He looked so confused, as if he didn’t even recognize what room he was in… he’d never been that bad before.

&#x200B;

**Young:** What did Dr. Magnuson have to say about all of this?

&#x200B;

**Dee:** When I called him, he seemed understandably concerned. He’d said to me that he’d heard of similar symptoms in patients with an advanced condition, and asked if I’d be willing to let him work more closely with Wally. I told him I would… and that’s when he arranged to bring him over to his clinic.

&#x200B;

**Young:** I see… this clinic, were you ever on site?

&#x200B;

**Dee:** A few times. It was far away. Somewhere in Oregon. We had to fly across the continent to get there. The building was old… made of stone. Historical, I think, but I don’t really know. I saw a number of other patients there but never really spoke to any of them. Dr. Magnuson did give me a brief tour of the patient faculties, and assured me Wally would be in good hands. 

&#x200B;

The facility did look nice… it was comfortable. And there were all sorts there. Adults of all ages, children. The place had a certain warmth to it. I saw a lot of the patients either reading, playing games, cards, board games, the like. They had a few televisions… and there were several large greenhouses out back. Dr. Magnuson said that he grew his supplements in some of them, and used the others for the patients to grow their own produce. He said it was part of the physical therapy for some of them. It seemed nice. 

&#x200B;

He told me I could speak to Wally nightly and visit as often as I’d liked… although he also told me he was not sure how long it would take to fully cure his condition. He said advanced cases like Wally’s could be tricky but he was still confident.

&#x200B;

**Young:** I see. Did you stay in Oregon long?

&#x200B;

**Dee:** I stayed for two weeks. I visited Wally daily, then. But, after those weeks were up I couldn’t afford to stay any longer. I had to go home. By then I was sure he was in good hands, but it still hurt to leave him. *\[Pause\]* Looking back… I was so stupid… there were signs, there had to be… I just couldn’t see them.

&#x200B;

**Young:** Signs?

**Dee:** That there was something wrong with that place! I just… I had to have seen them, I just don’t know what I missed. The other patients *were* quiet, I suppose. I don’t think I ever heard a single one of them speak during my visits, but I also never paid attention to them. The rest of the staff seemed polite, so if there were something off about them, I never noticed it. I just… *\[Pause\]* I don’t know…

&#x200B;

**Young:** You can’t blame yourself for what happened, Helen.

&#x200B;

**Dee:** Can’t I? I sent him there! I put him in touch with that man! I’m the reason he’s… God… the reason he’s dead…

&#x200B;

**Young:** You just wanted to save him.

&#x200B;

**Dee:** Did I? Look where that got him…

&#x200B;

**Young:** Let’s… talk a little more about the clinic. You said you didn’t find anything off about it when you were there the first time, right?

&#x200B;

**Dee:** Yes, that’s correct.

&#x200B;

**Young:** What changed your perception of the clinic?

&#x200B;

**Dee:** What I saw when I went back. It’d been about two months since I’d taken Wally there. Our son had helped me put together enough money to make it out there again. I would only be able to stay for a few days, but then I could at least see him. I hadn’t told Dr. Magnuson I’d be stopping by… I assumed he wouldn’t take any issue with it, since he had told me I could visit as often as I’d liked. 

&#x200B;

So, I took a flight out there, rented a car and drove down to the clinic. At a glance everything was the same as it had been before… but… *\[Pause\]*

&#x200B;

**Young:** Helen?

&#x200B;

**Dee:** I suppose when he knew he would be having company, Dr. Magnuson had taken care to hide a few things. When I drove up to the front gate, I found it locked. I’d buzzed in and told them I was there to see my husband, and they’d asked me if I had an appointment. 

&#x200B;

I asked them why I’d needed one, and whoever was working the gate said they couldn’t open it unless I had one. It was a whole pointless back and forth… and ended when I called Dr. Magnuson myself and told him I was there to see Wally. That got the gate open. He told me to meet him in the lobby, and that was exactly what I aimed to do. But as I was parking my car… well… I saw him.

&#x200B;

**Young:** Your husband?

&#x200B;

**Dee:** Yes. He was… he was leaving one of the greenhouses with several other patients. One of the staff was escorting them, leading them into one of the dormitory wings on the far side of the main building. It was Wally… I was sure of it. I would’ve recognized him anywhere… and so I went to go and say hello to him. To see him with my own eyes. 

&#x200B;

I called out to him as I walked toward the greenhouse, but he… he didn’t respond. The staff member saw me and tried to stop me from getting closer, but that was my husband! I had a right to see my own husband, didn’t I? And… I *did* see my husband… what… what was left of him…

&#x200B;

**Young:** Take your time, Mrs. Dee…

&#x200B;

**Dee:** He was… he was so pale… his eyes looked sunken and he’d lost weight as if he hadn’t… *\[pause\]* As if he hadn’t been eating… 

&#x200B;

*\[Laughter\]* 

&#x200B;

Oh… what a stupid fucking thing to say… as if he hadn’t been eating… how could he eat…? He didn’t have a jaw anymore. The bottom half of his face was just… gone. With ragged, torn, rotting flesh and exposed teeth where it used to be… and when he looked at me… when he looked at me there was *nothing* in his eyes! No recognition, no sign of the man I used to know, ***no love.*** That… that wasn’t my husband anymore… it was just his corpse.

&#x200B;

**Young:** Jesus…

&#x200B;

**Dee:** Of course that was the point when Dr. Magnuson came out, and tried to call out to me. I think he might have tried to make some halfhearted justification for what he’d done, but I didn’t want to hear it. The visage of my dead husband, standing in among those other dead eyed, walking corpses was burned into my mind. 

&#x200B;

Some of them had been in even worse shape than he was, you know… skin sloughing off their hands, eyes pale and sun bleached, bits of skull exposed… working zombies, growing his fucking herbal supplements. God… it was like something out of a nightmare. I ran… obviously I ran… running isn’t something I can do much of these days, but terror can do strange things to you. 

&#x200B;

I’m not sure what I was more afraid of, what Magnuson had done to my husband or what he might do to me now that I knew his secret. Either way I never wanted to find out. I ran for my car. I remember him pounding on the window as I started the engine, insisting that he could explain everything. 

&#x200B;

But I could see the rage in his eyes. His tone may have been even, but that rage told me everything I needed to know. If I stepped out of that car, then I was going to join those shambling corpses in his greenhouses. I knew it. So… I drove. He’d already closed the gate… but it didn’t stop me. 

&#x200B;

Enterprise was not very happy about what I did to their car, but I’m sure that they would’ve understood if I’d told them the truth.

&#x200B;

**Young:** I’m sure…

&#x200B;

**Dee:** I got on the first flight back home… and I’ve been trying to figure out what to do ever since. Nobody else seems to believe me. Although you… judging by that look in your eye, I can’t help but wonder if you’re different.

&#x200B;

**Young:** We deal with situations like this fairly often, Mrs. Dee. This exact one is a little new but… we’ll follow up on it.

&#x200B;

**Dee:** Please… if I can’t cure my husband, he at least deserves his rest. And as for Magnuson… I don’t care where he ends up. A prison cell… a grave…

&#x200B;

**Young:** I’ll keep you informed with what happens in the follow up, Mrs. Dee. I can promise you that much.

&#x200B;

**Dee:** Please… I would appreciate that. I don’t know how much help it will be, but I do have a few of the pills Wally was taking with me. You can do what you must with them… as well as the address of Dr. Magnuson’s clinic.

&#x200B;

**Young:** Of course. We’ll take a closer look at both during our follow up. I’ll… turn this off. Can I get you anything, water? Coffee?

&#x200B;

**Dee:** I’m fine… I just… I just need rest.

&#x200B;

*Copy of the FRB Department of Public Safetys After Action Report for the investigation of ‘Cure Health and Wellness Center’, in Oregon, USA.*

*Investigation carried out on July 13th, 2024 by DPS Officer Nina Valentine.*

&#x200B;

*This record is for internal use for the FRB only. Distributing this record to any party outside of authorized FRB personnel without the written consent of Director Robert Marsh constitutes breach of contract and will be punished accordingly.*

&#x200B;

**Background:** Following a statement issued to the FRB’s research division regarding a suspicious clinic operating out in Oregon, an investigation was ordered. I was assigned as the lead on this investigation by Director Milo Durand, and promptly consulted with Justice Young from the FRB’s research division to both review the interview transcript and go over the physical evidence provided by the witness.

&#x200B;

The witness had provided Miss Young with a half empty bottle full of approximately 23 green pills. Lab analysis determined that the pills contained high doses of an unidentified fungus. The working theory was that prolonged exposure to this fungus had brought about the state of ‘*living death*’ that the witness had described seeing at the clinic.

&#x200B;

As an aside note: Considering how I’ve personally seen a fucking undead zombie Arachne before - this tracked.

&#x200B;

On July 12th, I flew out to Oregon with Miss Young to conduct a full investigation of the address that the Witness had provided.

&#x200B;

**Incident:** At 8:12 AM on July 13th, I performed surveillance of the ‘Cure Health and Wellness Clinic’ from outside of the stone fence perimeter. I observed several patients entering the greenhouse on the far side of the property although I did not get a good enough look at them to determine if they were in the state of decay the witness had described.

&#x200B;

I did however take note of the uniform worn by all patients, which consisted of a plain white shirt and matching plain white pants. Upon leaving at 8:54, I purchased similar attire at a nearby store.

&#x200B;

At 12:02 PM, I returned to the ‘Cure Health and Wellness Clinic’ dressed in similar white attire to the patients. I had taken care to discreetly arm myself with my service pistol, a collapsible police baton that was concealed on my person and a folding pocket knife that was also concealed on my person.

&#x200B;

I gained access to the premises by climbing over the stone fence. There was minimal security, and I was able to blend in relatively easily.

&#x200B;

I immediately went toward the greenhouses, and was able to look in through the windows to see what was going on inside.

&#x200B;

I noticed several patients working on tending the *‘crop’* and up close, was able to determine that most if not all of them were unquestionably already dead, displaying some minor decay or other damage that should have impeded their work, but did not.

&#x200B;

The crop could only be described as some kind of mushroom growing in troughs of dirt and mold. In some of those troughs, I saw evidence of human remains inside, which suggests to me that they were using the patients who could no longer work in the greenhouses as fertilizer.

&#x200B;

I saw the same in the other 4 greenhouses on the property.

&#x200B;

Each greenhouse contained approximately one unarmed guard, wearing a breathing mask, who seemed to be there not for security, but for guidance. I did not engage any of these guards at this time. I did document my findings with my cell phone, and immediately shared the photos with Justice Young.

&#x200B;

Once the evidence was documented - I made the judgment call to immediately shut down this operation, as I believed that due to the low level of security, I would be capable of doing so without backup, although I was aware that Miss Young would be sending some operatives from the FRB’s Oregon Office to assist me shortly.

&#x200B;

I had noticed one of the guards stepping out of their greenhouse for a smoke break, and while they were distracted I took the opportunity to obtain their lighter. I accomplished this by beating them over the head with a police baton, stealing the lighter, and kicking them several times in the stomach for good measure.

&#x200B;

I then decided that the safest and most effective course of action would be to burn down the greenhouses. I will state for the record that I do understand that Arson is not always the answer. Arson is the question. The Answer is always Yes.

&#x200B;

Once again - I made a judgment call to burn down the greenhouses with the patients inside. I only made this decision after confirming that the ones inside of the greenhouses were already dead, and decided that this would be the most effective way to both destroy the contaminant that had likely infected/reanimated them and to grant them the basic dignity of staying fucking dead.

&#x200B;

Upon burning down the first two greenhouses, several members of the staff came out to try and stop me. Upon finding out that I was carrying a gun, they promptly reconsidered that course of action and stood back while I torched the rest of the greenhouses.

&#x200B;

While the fourth greenhouse was being burned to the ground, a man who matched the description of Dr. Jeremiah Magnuson emerged from the main building and ran toward me, attempting to physically stop me from burning down the last of the greenhouses.

&#x200B;

He did not seem concerned by the fact that I had a gun. I was initially reluctant to shoot him, since I was under the impression that he was still human… but he also turned people into mold zombies to make money, and that’s not really something you can come back from, morally speaking. So when he attempted to rip the lighter out of my hand, I grazed him with a bullet to drive him back.

&#x200B;

Dr. Magnuson only grew more agitated when I did that, and it was around that point that I noticed the strong smell of mold coming off of him. Looking at his wound, I noticed that his blood was significantly darker than it should have been, and realized that the stink of mold was coming from his wound. Dr. Magnuson seemed to become aware of what I had seen, and grew even more vicious in his efforts to attack me. I shot him three more times in the chest, before pushing him off of me. The smell of mold grew more intense, and Dr. Magnuson did not appear to suffer any ill effects from having just been shot several fucking times. He simply picked himself back up, and kept on coming for me in a blind rage.

&#x200B;

Even a headshot was not enough to kill him.

&#x200B;

I eventually resorted to bludgeoning him with my police baton to incapacitate him and breaking both of his legs before throwing him inside of the last greenhouse and burning it.

&#x200B;

This did not kill him either.

&#x200B;

Dr. Magnuson simply crawled out of the flames. One of his broken legs had completely separated from his body, but he kept on crawling for approximately six minutes before he stopped moving. It was unclear if he was dead at that time, or if his body was simply too charred to continue moving.

&#x200B;

By around 1:16, the operatives from the FRB’s Oregon office had arrived and been briefed. They were in the process of bringing in the surviving employees of the clinic for questioning, and ensuring that all biohazardous material was properly incinerated. I was promptly examined by a physician for any signs of infection, and after a clean blood test, left the scene with Miss Young at approximately 2:30 PM.

&#x200B;

**Follow Up:** I would recommend burning everything, but I already did that. You’re welcome.

&#x200B;

I’m not sure what the fuck he was growing in those greenhouses, and to be brutally honest I don’t particularly want to know. I suppose I do have some concerns about where the fungus came from, and if there’s more out there… but I’m sure the answer to that question will just fucking horrify me, so like I said, I don’t really *want* to know.

&#x200B;

For the sake of those who do - hopefully more information will be gleaned from the employees (amongst which there were no casualties aside from one concussion… and Dr. Magnuson, I guess. But I wasn’t counting him as an employee.)

&#x200B;

I’ll leave answering the questions to someone else. As far as I’m concerned my job here is done. Everyone who should be dead is dead. The person responsible is dead. All is right in the world.
