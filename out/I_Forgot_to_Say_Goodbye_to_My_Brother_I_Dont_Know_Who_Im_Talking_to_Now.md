I was 17 when my brother (Micah) died and 18 when we buried him. It was two days before my birthday when we got the call. He was drunk and driving my dad's truck down the interstate. He was going the speedlimit. He hit a deer. He overcorrected, flipped the truck into a ditch, wasn't wearing a seatbelt, and died when his head impacted with the windshield. 

I saw the photos. Gruesome is an understatement. I had no idea how much blood a body could hold until I saw it puddled on the spiderweb-cracked windshield. The funeral was closed casket. He was 16. 

We were all heartbroken of course, my mom especially. She stopped going to church and seeking out other coping mechanisms. She read a lot of books about the afterlife, trying to make sense of Micah's untimely passing. I didn't think much of it until I came home from work one day and saw a ouija board sitting on the kitchen table. 

"It won't work. I need you to help me," she pleaded. 

I reluctantly agreed, mostly because I didn't believe in the stuff. I thought maybe if it didn't work, she'd put the endless search for meaning in Micah's death away, bury it somewhere like the rest of us did. 

"It works better if you close your eyes, so you don't subconsciously push it towards anything," she told me. 

There was joy in her voice. Hope. I sat next to her and lightly placed my fingers on the edge of the planchette. She did several small circles, guiding my hands and her own around the board. 

"Micah, if you're here with us, please give us a sign", she said, "Close your eyes Eliza. Let him talk through us."

I rolled my eyes as I shut them. 

"Are you here with us Micah?"

No movement.

"Are you aware that you are dead?"

No movement. 

"Micah, mommy misses you," my mom said, a Crack in her voice threatening tears. 

No movement. 

I was about to open my eyes and remove my hand from the board when my mom's next question caught me off guard.  

"Micah, are you angry?" 

A soft pull on the tips of my fingers from the planchette stroke fear in my heart and my eyes snapped open. It moved to 'YES' on the board, slowly. I removed my fingers immediately, a shudder reaching through my body. 

My mom's smile fell from her face as her eyes snapped open. "Put your goddamn fingers back on the board."

My mom never swore, especially with the Lord's name. 

"Don't move that thing. This is weird," I told her. 

"I didn't move it. Your brother did. He's here. I feel him. Put your fingers back," she snapped at me. 

Reluctantly, I obliged. I was barely touching the thing, and I could see my mom's fingers alternating between hovering over it and lightly touching it. She closed her eyes again, I kept mine open. 

"Micah, why are you angry?" She asked in a sing-song tone.

No movement. 

"Micah, do you remember crashing the truck?" Mom asked, softer.

Slight movement towards the letter 'D'. Once it rested on 'D' it stopped. My mom opened her eyes.

"Were you drinking?" Mom asked. 

Slow movements to the letter 'E'. 

"Deer? Micah did you hit a deer?" 

Both of our eyes were now glued to the board as our fingers moved to 'YES' again. 

Tears spilled down my mom's cheeks. I could tell she was barely touching it, as was I. But, the subconscious is a powerful thing. I couldn't help but think she must be answering her own questions in some form or another. 

"Micah, Eliza is here with me. We miss you so much. Are you okay?"

The planchette picked up speed a bit as it moved to 'NO'. By this point my mom was bawling. 

"I've had enough," I said, standing from the table and wiping tears from my own cheeks. 

"This is sick, mom. Sick."

She begged me to stay, but I left the house and went to my boyfriends. After telling him the situation, he asked me if I said 'GOODBYE'. 

"What like, on the board?" I asked. 

"If you don't say 'GOODBYE' on the board it leaves the portal open," he told me. 

I rolled my eyes at him, "You sound as loony as my mom."

"Hey, I didn't say I believe in the stuff, but better safe than sorry right?" He replied. 

As much as I hated to admit it, I did still have an uneasy feeling in my gut. When I got home, mom had left a note saying she had run to the hippie shop to get some sage. The board still sat on the kitchen table next to a scratch pad. On the scratch pad my mom had frantically scribbed several words. 

'COLD'
'MOM'
'ELI'
'MAD'
'DEAD'
'ELI DEAD'
'NO GOODBYE'

Micah used to call me Eli. Tears welled in my eyes and spilled onto the board. I sobbed at the sight of my nickname written in my mother's handwriting. 

"Fuck you for dying Micah. Fuck. You!" I screamed into the empty house. 

The planchette had been left on 'GOODBYE'. After gathering myself,  I sat down at the board. I hesitated for a moment before placing my fingertips on it. I did the little circles, as my mom had done, and closed my eyes. 

"Micah, I miss you," I cried. 

No movement. 

"Micah are you here?" I gasped through choking sobs. 

Movement. Slow movement towards "NO'. 

Micah and I had a running joke of saying the opposite answer to any question asked. I let out a giggle through my sobs. 

"I love you so much Micah."

No movement. 

"If it is you, show me please. Show me your nickname." 

I had nicknamed Micah "Pudge" because he had been so chubby when we were kids. I closed my eyes and waited but the planchette remained on 'NO'. 

I sighed started moving my fingers towards 'GOODBYE' but just as I was about to reach it, the planchette pulled towards 'H', pausing for a moment Before moving to 'I'. 

"Hi! Hi! Oh my God hi!" I exclaimed. 

'E' 'L' 'I' came next, and I began to cry again. 

"Micah it really is you. I can't believe it. How are you doing this?"

'H' 'A' 'R' 'D'

"It's hard? Hard to move the piece?" I asked.

'YES' 

The planchette was moving faster now and I was sure I wasn't doing it myself. So sure that I was actually a bit terrified. 

"I can't believe I'm talking to you again. Where are you?"

'D' 'I' 'E' 

"Yes, you died. Two months ago. You crashed dad's truck on the interstate."

'D' 'E' 'R'

"Deer? Yes, you hit a deer." 

The planchette didn't move. 

"You said cold to mom. Are you cold?"

'NO' 'A' 'L' 'O' 'N' 'E'

Sadness raked my body. "You're not alone Pudge, I'm right here. 

'NO' 'A' 'L' 'O' 'N' 'E'

"I'm sorry Micah, I'm right here. You're not alone."

The planchette was moving faster now, almost with a sense of urgency. 

'NO' 'A' 'L' 'O' 'N' 'E'

"Can I help you? I'm sorry you feel alone," I told him earnestly. 

'NO' 'A' 'L' 'O' 'N' 'E'

'NO' 'A' 'L' 'O' 'N' 'E'

'NO' 'A' 'L' 'O' 'N' 'E'

The planchette was moving so fast now that I was scared. I went to remove my fingers when it moved again, circling 'GOODBYE' repeatedly.  

I pushed it to 'GOODBYE' and removed my fingers. The planchette stopped moving where I left it. In tears, I ran upstairs and threw up in the toilet. When my mom returned, she saged the house from top to bottom, making sure to open the windows so the bad energy could leave. I went to bed after she left my room. 

The next morning when I went downstairs, the board was gone. 

"What happened to it?" I asked my mom. 

"I don't think we need it," she said. 

After she left for work, I had a few hours to myself before my shift started. My dad was still on a business trip, so the house was mine. I thought about inviting my boyfriend over, but I wanted to talk to Micah again, as scared as I was. So I searched. In the back of mom's closet under the sewing machine, I found it. 

I laid it out on the kitchen table again. I did the small circles and placed my fingertips on top. 

"Hello, Micah, are you there?" 

'H' 'I' 'E' 'L' 'I'

"Hey Pudge. How are you?"

No movement.  

"You kind of freaked me out yesterday."

'H' 'A'

"It wasn't funny. You scared mom too. She saged the whole house."

No movement. 

"I'm sorry you feel alone. I wish I knew how to help."

'H' 'E' 'L' 'P' 

I sighed, frustrated. "How do I help you?"

No movement. 

"Help me help you. How can I help you?"

No movement. 

Once again tears threatened to spill over. 

"Pudge I--"

'NO' 'P' 'U' 'D' 'G' 'E'

Micah had hated the nickname, even when he hit puberty and wasn't pudgy anymore. 

"Fine, no Pudge. What do you want? What can I do?"

'D' 'I' 'E'

Taken aback, I removed my fingers from the planchette. I hurriedly put it away and left the house,  deciding to walk to work to clear my mind. After my shift, I returned home to find my mom sitting on the couch and watching 60 Minutes, her favorite Sunday program. 

She looked unusually pale and didn't even glance up at me when I walked in. 

"Hey mom, how was your day?" 

"Fine," she replied, no emotion in her voice. 

"You okay?" I asked. 

"Just tired," she answered. 

I shrugged it off and went to bed. That night, I had horrible dreams. Dreams of crashing into a deer going 90 miles an hour, dreams of being chased by some sort of monster. When I woke up, I didn't feel refreshed or even awake, I felt like a puddle of gray. 

The dreams continued for the next week and I slept so little that I took two days off of work. My mom noticed but figured it was just my seasonal depression. Between school and my job at the gas station,  I was worse than exhausted. I felt dead. 

"Did you say 'GOODBYE'" my boyfriend asked me after a week of the nightmares. That's when it hit me that no, I didn't after the last time. When I got home from his house,  I took the board out of my mom's room while she was at a restaurant with her girlfriends. 

After setting it on the kitchen table,  I did the little circles and then went straight to 'GOODBYE' . I lifted my fingers and went to put it away when the planchette moved on its own. 

'NO'

In a state of total shock and fear, I sat down again. 

"M...Micah?" I whispered. 

The planchette stayed on 'NO'. I placed my shaky fingertips on it. 

"Micah I can't do this anymore. I need to say goodbye. I can't talk to you anymore," I explained. 

The room was cold. Colder than it should have been. The planchette didn't move. 

"Please. It's hurting me. I miss you but I need to end this," I pleaded. 

Hairs stood on the back of my neck as I felt a cold, hollow finger drag its way down my spine. I screamed, whirling around to find nothing behind me. 

The planchette moved on its own again. 

'2' 'L' 'A' 'T' 'E'

"MICAH STOP!" I shouted at the ghost of my brother. 

'NO' 'M' 'I' 'C' 'A' 'H'
