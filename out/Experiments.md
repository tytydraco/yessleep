I stared into his red eyes while tears rolled down my cheeks
"I…I I'm so sorry!" I wimped
"It's ok it's not your fault as long as you love I will live along side you."
He tried to smile like he used to.
"Living without you is going to be hell" I muttered
"Hurry up we don't have all day!" The soldier shouted
"Goodbye I love and always will"
"I love you too." 
I raised my trembling hand above my head and plunged the knife into his heart.
He fell backwards off the rocky Cliff.

 The next week, I heard the doorbell ring as I was replying to my husband's family that I last saw him at a bar.
Yes he was delivered I thought.
I opened the door and took the package in.
I took out the hundreds of boxes containing his sweet blood.
Laughing at the thought of him loving me, I stared the straw into the drink like the knife and his heart.

Then I turned off the camera.
"Why….why did this happen I….I didn't want to kill him It wasn't my fault!"
Thoughts were running through my head.
I am I a killer?
Is this my fault?
Am I going to jail?
Why did I have to record it and act happy?


I sat on my sofa crying until I fell asleep.
I woke to hundreds of messages on my phone.
They were a bunch of random letters and some were upper case.
The first message said
KILLER KILLER YOU MURDERER
And it reaped until the last message
HELP ME AM ALIVE 402 APPLEPON STREET COME ALONE WITH WEAPONS CALL POLICE 4:30PM


I dropped my phone in horror. No way he could be alive?!
I grabbed my phone and swung it towards my face. The time was 3:00.
I ran towards the kitchen grabbing the biggest kitchen knife .As I sprinted off into the hallway, I grabbed the key from my pocket and swung open the gun cabinet.
My husband always kept guns in the house for protection but ever since the incident I wanted to get rid of all the guns even though it reminds me of him. I ran into the backyard grabbing the baseball bat.3:10pm.
I looked on YouTube for self defence it lasted till 4:00pm


I got in the car and drove off as soon as I could not thinking how idiotic this could have been.
It hit 4:29 as soon as I stepped out of my car barely making it in time. I walk for a few seconds when I saw something in a white van struggling.

I opened the door of the van to see my husband! I picked him up and ran to our car. I shoved him in and myself in shutting the door behind me.


Turns out when we were in the game he got swapped with a robot doll that would copy his every move and that is what I stabbed. They kidnapped him to run experiments on him and to make me harm myself for an experiment of depression and torture.
