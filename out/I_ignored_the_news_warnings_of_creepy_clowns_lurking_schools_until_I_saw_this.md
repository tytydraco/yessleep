Hi. My name is Michael, and I live in a mostly suburban part of a big city. I'm 14 and have a big interest in animals. My school is one of the larger, more populated high schools around here. I usually ride my bike to school, except sometimes when I'm late my dad drives me to school.

Lately, there has been some rumours about people dressing up in clown costumes lurking around parks and schools. But I don't buy it. It's just clowns, right? There have been dangerous people around here forever, and everything's been fine. But for some reason when those stupid people dress up like clowns, everyone freaks out.

This morning, I ride my bike to school, and I see nothing out of the ordinary other than a mean dog that bites the heck out of my tires. "get off!" I yell pushing the dog off my bike. But I try not to hurt it. After all, I love animals.

When I arrive at school today, I see Derek, my best friend, waiting for me at the entrance. He still has a cast on his arm from when he fell off his bike and broke it. "Dude! You still have to wear that thing? It's been months!" "Well, it's a pretty bad break, I fell hard man." Derek tells me as I open my locker, grabbing some books.

We have assembly this morning. We usually have assembly in the afternoon, but today it was urgent. Me and Derek put our stuff back since we wouldn't need it for assembly, then we headed over.

We all sat down, patiently waiting for the student council to announce the daily reminders. But instead we are met with the principal walking down the isle. He steps up and grabs a microphone tightly. "Hello everyone, I hope your all doing well. It has come to my attention that a series of well... incidents have been happening around town. Now, I think you all know what I'm talking about today. People dressed as clowns are being spotted carrying weapons and approaching children. I want everyone to be extra careful and stay safe."

Me and Derek glance at each other as if to say "this is so stupid." But I'm not exactly sure if Derek actually believes in this stuff. I don't think he does anyway.

3:24pm Me and Derek grab our bikes and as I'm about to leave, Derek glances at me, " Mike, do you believe all that stuff? About the... killer clowns?"
 "Nah. well...I mean, I believe in bad people dressing up as clowns. But not all the rumours about people getting hurt or anything." After that we head for home. Me and Derek live on seperate parts of town, so we go in different directions. We still live nearby though.

6:25pm dinner I sit down at the dinner table and wait patiently for my meal. My mom usually cooks the food. She isn't a chef or anything. But she definitely has talent. I open up my phone and whithout even searching anything, I see yet another news flash about the killer clowns stalking teens and adults. I close my phone as my mom places a bowl of spaghetti on the table. Dinner that night is pretty awkward my dad manages to break the silence, only to bring up the clown situation.

After dinner I head upstairs and just decide to sleep early. But this is we're something crazy happens. I hear something weird like a scraping sound, coming from my bedroom window. The wind howls. The window is closed but I can still hear the wind banging against the glass. I lift up the blind, and what I see leaves me dead silent. I see a short man in a yellow suit with blue streaks and rainbow hear with a horrifying skill painted on his face. When I look closer I see a small machete in his hand. He looks to be searching for something but I can't tell what, then he glared right at me.

I close the blind and jump into my bed. Maybe I was wrong maybe there is a danger. But no one got hurt yet, right?

7:56pm morning Today is Saturday, which is great. No school and no worries, except that there are crazy people dressed like clowns lurking around. Now that I think back to yesterday night, maybe it wasn't a human. I mean that's impossible.. maybe he just went all out on his costume. Idiots. Today I just plan on staying inside. Other than heading over to the comic store with Derek in the afternoon. I mean, now that I think about it, maybe the clowns only come out at night time.

3:40pm Ok, now I have to go over to the comic store. I text Derek before I head off. I think about telling him what I saw, but I guess I'll just tell him at the store. I grab my bike, look around and ride off. For some reason today feels a lot slower than yesterday, and it's definitely a lot hotter. I feel really tired, even though I got a good sleep last night. It seems like the way to the comic store is longer than it was before.

Eventually I start to pass by the local playground, weird. No kids are out and playing. It used to be packed with children a couple weeks ago, I gain focus on the road but then I look over to the bush on my right. I scream. I see two yellow eyes in the bush and a red nose, I almost don't believe it. But an arm grabs me me by the neck throwing me to the ground. A clown pops out of the bush, but it's definitely not a human. It's the same one I saw last night but with blood smeared on its mouth. "HELP!" I yell. But no one hears me. The clown pulls out a long machete and says, "it doesn't matter anymore, it'll only take a minute." He lifts the weapon, but I kick him on the stomach.

It seems to have done nothing to him. But it made him a whole lot angrier. I kick him in the face, right in his teeth. Long, white teeth. I run, forgetting my bike, I call my parents and they pick me up. I try to tell them what happened and they believe me for the most part. But the police never found the guy, or thing. I never forgot it, my whole life.
