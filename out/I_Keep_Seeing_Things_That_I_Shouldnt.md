Pre-Entry

I don't know if I want to even start this wreckage or should I say madness? I'm Mark Gray, I'm in my thirties and that's all you should need to know about me...

Excuse my attitude, this is something I've gained since the deep shift inside of me.. I've inherited a different version of myself. 

Chapter 1 

So here I am in the fields, it was a summer night out with the wind and stars in the sky, though they looked like skies to me. 

I saw skyscrapers and big coglomerate buildings filled with human flesh, a reddish smoke covered what I perceived as the atmosphere.

 A smell of old blood kept in a towel, It reeks of torture.
 
I close my eyes and a slow whisper shoves my ears to wildness,

"There's no escape of yourself or is there? But I'm sure we're always here with you".

And then in a choir theme, demonized voices started singing my name, 
"Mark..Mark..Mark.....". 

I couldn't identify the whereabouts of them with my eyes but they felt near like right in my head or heart.

I noticed my veins were on the verge of bursting so I let go of the pressure and found comfort in the asylum that I was in.

I had no idea where I was now or what was happening but I remained as resilient as ever even with the loud radios going off I kept smiling through.... something from a distance was staring at me

Though a glowing red silhouette emerged from the fields at the tip of my fingenails, I felt the boats of my heart shake and water filled them.

This presence was oddly familiar but I couldn't put my thumb on his face since shadows quickly took him away from the fields with maniacal laughters.

"Perhaps I'm going insane?" I still held her portrait in my hand tightly, whatever terrorises me I won't let go, I won't give my wife to these monsters. 

As time passed these choirs and skyscrapers slowly faded in the distance and nightingales fell on my lap. 

They kept singing me songs and I benefited more and more creepiness in my spine, truly what I want..-ed

Before I could finish my sentence I woke up in tears and sweat covering me and my bed sheets,

"Ugh, this happened to me again?" 
"I guess I'll never be free from this hellhole".
 I say to myself.

Perhaps I was right but that was one way of looking at the picture, finding a solution is another one.

Will I start to see more patterns in my daily life or simply when I'm not here? Time is a teller and a patient one, no wonder it controlls the clock I chuckle to myself.

Suddenly the same voices with blackness inside starts to tune in like an outro,
"Mark..Mark...Mark....".

Chapter 2

Days burn out like marshmallows on a stick, I barely look to walk as I proceed to live like a zombie. 

I'm in danger is what the bullet said to me, the gun just smoked itself out and lashed out on me.
 It may not be possible but it's what I saw.

And here I was yet again in the coast of nightmares, why did they keep pulling me with loud screams and twitching arms? I couldn't run away.

Then suddenly even louder screams were transmitted through a megaphone, in the midst of the screams I could hear between them a voice firmly calling my name out,
"Mark...Mark...Mark.." 

Then after a few moments of snow everywhere of which I found bizarre, everything stopped and a red figure appeared right in front of me.

For half a second I figured he had a coat, then my eyes went blind though my ears worked well to cover.
 
I was just going with it, i figured there was no point reasoning anything here.

What I perceived through my perception was that he was speaking to me, 

"May the grass be fire to your feet, mercy you shall not receive! He let out a deafening loud growl and so he went on, 

"What you did was wrong! I will put an end to those windows of yours with knocks and knives on the doors.
 You'll be food to the dead end, serve a purpose a soul couldn't."

What was he saying or referring to, I had no clue but I proceeded to remain silent.

And so he disappeared behind into the choir that formed and here I thought to myself,

"Ah this again" It wasn't even terror but irritation and annoyance, perhaps this was my sentence.

They not long after started their demonized songs of nonsensical and illogical text, 
"ez-ez-oz-oz, oz-oz-ez-ez*. This is what my fractured brain could decipher.

They became even louder and my body started to freeze, I couldn't feel myself anymore and then what felt likes ages. 

A scorching hot touch melted me into water drops, I couldn't even scream as it all happened so fast and a few moments later I was back to listening to ramblings of supposed "singers of hell".

I yelled "Let me Out!", they all stopped and started staring at me like I murdered their houses, their eyes grew wider and wider eyes.

I started to feel the tense up in my head, the urge to explode and be free from this hellfire but I couldn't.

I woke yet again to sweat and tears on my bed, changing sheets every night became normality.

When will this stop? Or when will my torture will ever be enough? 

What answers do they want? that I have that I don't know?.....these questions circulate like blood in me.

Will I ever find the answers? 

Chapter 3

Weeks passed and here I am debating whether I'm insane or from somewhere else. 

Why I was delusional or simply seeing something I shouldn't? I never had answers for.

I lost my appetite to even eat anything, just drinking water and restraining myself from sleep.

 Those dreams only made me worse, the choirs and the red silhouette man.

Ehh I don't want to think about that as the fear and terror rises again deep inside of me.

I turned to all sorts of psychologists and psychiatrist and even priests and witches, no solution or answer except that I'm not "okay mentally".

 I think I had that answer but I need one that explained what I saw in those skyscrapers, and why those corpses and these demons surrounding me amongst the fields.

It was really bothering me, I was getting more and more sleep deprived.
 
I knew I couldn't keep this for long, I guess I'll have to face it even without knowing what it is. 

What nags me the most is why they wanted to take me there? 

Perhaps I'll learn about it even if I'm on the edge of death by fear, I'm not the most courageous person though I tried my best to keep myself intact.

I'm writing all of this down on my phone and a notebook that I have on my desk for work that I have, I don't want people to think I killed myself. 

But I'm not dead, am I? 

Chapter 4

Having no choice but to indulge in taking out my own sanity, I decided to sleep without a timer waking me up after every 30 minutes or so.

As I settled in my sleep, a world started to form, this time I wasn't in any rural area.

I could smell the fuel in the area but I couldn't see it yet and then it became visible, I was on the streets of some big city.

I kept walking around and seeing broken cars and big buildings with shattered windows and overall burnt down places, there wasn't anyone.

I was skeptical and took a peak before walking each time I decided to go somewhere else.

As I kept walking I could hear something in the distance, I decided to get closer and I could finally heard a choir singing... I said to myself " not this again".

" ez-ez-oz-oz" and on repeat.

I was anticipating the red demon to appear out of nowhere but nothing came and there I was listening to this demonic song in a weird language that repeated the same words.

As I looked behind a broken car at the choir, I felt something grab my leg from behind, it's grip getting tighter and tighter. 

I turned around and saw it, I regret to this day turning around to see that..thing.
 I swear it wasn't like anything that I've ever seen before.

 Its eyes rapidly twitching and changing color with those black gloves of which had fingers that were changing shapes every second and its reddish coat.

I tried to fight it "Get off of me" It didn't speak as it attempted to slam me in the door of the car. 

I managed to break from its grip just in time to avoid it and ran...ran..ran until I noticed I wasn't being chased anymore.

I was exhausted and drained, even feared that whatever it is would appear out of the blue. 

Whilst running I never looked up, thinking I'd be at a disadvantage. Now that I've regained serenity I look up to see myself in the same field.....
" Ez-ez-oz-oz" demons with those black red eyes were staring at me, there were a crowd of them.

I turned pale, my body shaking from intense emotion of what felt like it was my end but I could see a piece of letter right in front of me.

They kept staring at me but I wasn't being approached, I thought they wanted me to read whatever the letter had. 

I cautiously got close to the letter, grabbed it and opened it.

I read it to myself "You can't avoid the truth, you can delay your fate" 

And then it started, they all rushed at me and before they reached me I woke up.

Another episode of the nightmare... though that face, it wasn't human and certainly is engraved in my head. 

To this day I haven't forgotten about it, those eyes and its hands, my god I hate myself sometimes but I know it's not my fault.

I decided to go for a walk and clear my head since that imagery of a face kept running inside my head on repeat.

Chapter 5

I'm still at the park with earbuds in my ears, though what I saw doesn't leave me.

 It's there constantly reminding me of something abnormal and inhumane. 

 I found myself shaking from these intense thoughts but I managed to snap out of it.

As I got up to leave the bench of where I sat, I felt watched like someone or something was out and about to tackle me from behind. 
I felt like I was being hunted.

I paced my eyes back and forth, left and right but nothing seemed out of place.

"Eh I should just not think" If you're wondering I talk to myself to ease the fear, since a young age whenever something would scared me I'd talk myself out of it.

Anyways I walked home, on my road to there, I had an odd thought that stuck to me like a spider, 
"Think about your parents, where are they?" 

I could sense something, in reality I never knew where my parents went. 
They just disappeared one day when I was still a teenager.

I grew up by myself, perhaps finding them had all the answers? Maybe they're causing these nightmares? 

Are they calling out to me? I was also cautious about something using my parents as bait to lure me in and then god knows what they'll do to me.

I kept stumbling on the ground as I walked, though I eventually got home.

I decided to revisit the same old nightmarish chaos,
"Maybe, just maybe I'll get a hint?" 
I proceed to hug the pillow with worry on my mind of what's to come.

Chapter 6

I entered this world again, where I was aware that anything and anyone could appear at any time. 

This time I was in a rainforest and a path followed by footprints on the ground that led somewhere, "Hmm, interesting" I said to myself.

Following the path, in the distance I could see a cabin with a window. During the walk there I kept seeing red eyes in the bushes and trees around the path.

I just ignored them and kept slowing speeding, when I got to the front of the cabin, I could see a few bloody axes, shattered portraits, knives of all sizes and a rope. 

I grabbed one of the portraits, 
There I was with my parents, my dad and my mom, emotions started to flow, as a few watery tears fell from my eyes.

Something started moving around violently inside the cabin, I rushed to the side of the building. Hoping that whatever it was, it wouldn't see me. 

It stopped making noise and broke the window and grabbed me by my throat..."but wait there wasn't a window there" something wasn't right.

It was the red coat demon from last time...I closed my eyes right after seeing the coat, I didn't even want to look at that thing.

The demon slowly started to fade and the choir started playing in the background with growing intensity each time "
" Ez-ez-oz-oz" .

Heck, what is happening!? I need answers I yelled out but was unfortunate to find no replies from anyone.

I woke up to the same old sweat and nightmare sensation... life's a pain.

Time passed and with the help of psychiatry, I managed to get out of my sleep deprivation and stopped experiencing these " nightmares".

Though I never got the answers to who or what caused them, I guess it's for the best.
*I chuckled*

*Suddenly the same demonic choir with blackness inside starts to tune in like an outro*
"Mark..Mark...Mark....".
