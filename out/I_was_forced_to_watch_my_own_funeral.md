I need to write this down before my hands fade completely. The marks on my skin spread a little more each hour, and the mirror shows less of my face every time I look. My friends think I came back from Hollow Hills Cemetery unchanged. They have no idea they’ve been talking to something wearing my skin.

The cheap clock behind Mickey’s Diner counter read eleven fifteen when everything went wrong. Rain pelted the windows, turning the neon signs outside into blurry halos. My friends and I huddled in our usual booth, the torn leather seats sticky against my legs. The place smelled like burnt coffee and yesterday’s grease, but it beat going home to an empty house.

My coffee had long gone cold, and a half-eaten plate of fries sat forgotten between us. Chris dominated the conversation as usual, his varsity jacket taking up too much space in the booth. He lived for these late-night sessions, swapping urban legends between bites of food he never paid for.

Chris asked, “You guys ever hear about the Forgotten Ritual?”

The fluorescent light above our booth flickered, casting strange shadows across his face.

“Not this again,” Megan said. She pulled her sleeve over a fresh bruise on her arm—another gift from her stepdad.

Chris leaned forward. “No, listen. My cousin’s friend went out to Hollow Hills Cemetery last month. He never came back right.”

The jukebox in the corner skipped, repeating the same three notes of an old country song.

“What do you mean, never came back right?” I asked.

“Old man Peters found him wandering the grounds at dawn,” Chris said. “The guy kept talking about empty coffins and funeral setups appearing out of nowhere. Said the chairs were filled with things wearing people suits.”

My stomach twisted. “Things?” I asked.

Megan said, “Faceless things. My sister told me about this. The ritual calls people in at midnight. They find this creepy funeral, and then...”

“And then what?” I asked.

“They become part of the audience,” Chris said. “Every time someone new walks in, the chairs are filled with these faceless creatures in rotting funeral clothes. But there’s always one empty chair, waiting for the next idiot who doesn’t listen to the warnings.”

Thunder cracked outside. The diner’s lights dimmed for a moment, and my reflection in the window looked odd.

“You’re making this up,” I said. A drop of cold sweat ran down my back.

Chris pulled out his phone. “Peters swears he’s found fresh funeral setups out there. Look at these pictures. Empty coffins just sitting in the grass, surrounded by all these old wooden chairs.”

The photos on his phone showed blurry shapes in the darkness. Black flowers scattered on wet grass. Something that might have been a coffin.

“Those could be anything,” I said. But my hands shook as I pushed his phone away.

Chris said, “Prove us wrong, then. Go out there tonight. Take some better pictures.”

The diner’s ancient heating system groaned. Cold air leaked through the windows, and goosebumps rose on my arms.

“I’ll do it,” I said. The words left my mouth before I could stop them.

“Jacob, we were just messing around. Don’t be stupid,” Megan said.

I stood up from the booth. “No, you want proof? I’ll get it.” The linoleum floor seemed to tilt under my feet.

“Some stories should stay stories,” Megan said.

Chris reached for my arm. His face had lost its usual smirk. “Seriously, man. I was just talking shit. Don’t go out there.”

I yanked away from him. “Text me the directions. I’ll show you there’s nothing in that cemetery except old graves and your crazy stories.”

The bell above the diner door chimed as I pushed outside. Rain soaked through my jacket immediately. The moon hung low and bloated in the sky, surrounded by clouds that looked like grasping hands.

A dog howled somewhere in the distance. The sound echoed off empty streets and dark houses, mixing with the rain.

I had no idea I’d just accepted an invitation to my own funeral.

The rain pounded against my windshield as I drove down Miller Road. My phone’s GPS kept losing signal, the screen flickering between Chris’s texted directions and static. The streetlights ended at the town limits, leaving only my headlights to cut through the darkness.

My hands gripped the steering wheel tighter at each turn. The radio picked up nothing but white noise, a strange buzz that rose and fell like whispered voices. Even turning it off didn’t help—the sound continued through my car’s speakers, growing louder as I approached Hollow Hills.

A rusted sign marked the turnoff to the cemetery. The metal had corroded into strange patterns, but the warning remained clear: NO ENTRY AFTER DARK. My headlights caught something moving behind the sign. A shadow darted into the trees, too quick to identify.

“Just a deer,” I said. My voice sounded shrill in the confined space of my car.

The dirt road wound through dense woods. Branches scraped against my car’s roof like fingernails on metal. Each curve revealed more warning signs, their messages growing stranger, like: “TURN BACK,” “THEY ARE WAITING,” and “THE RITUAL MUST BE FED.”

The clock on my dashboard read eleven forty-five. The numbers flickered, sometimes showing different times. My phone died despite being fully charged at the diner.

An old church appeared through the trees, its steeple askew and windows dark. The stone walls had turned black with age and something else—strange symbols carved into every surface. My headlights swept across the entrance, illuminating a figure in the doorway. It wore what might have been a priest’s collar, but its face...

I blinked and the figure vanished. The church sat empty, though the doorway seemed darker than the surrounding night.

“This is stupid,” I said. My breath fogged the windshield in strange patterns.

The cemetery gates rose ahead, wrought iron twisted into shapes that hurt my eyes. The main entrance stood open, hinges creaking in a wind I couldn’t feel. My headlights caught rows of tombstones, their surfaces writhing with shadows.

A group of crows perched on a nearby mausoleum. Their heads turned in unison to watch my car pass, but their bodies remained perfectly still. One opened its beak in a silent scream.

The service road ended at a circular parking area. Gravel crunched under my tires as I pulled in, the sound too loud in the unnatural silence. Other tire tracks marked the gravel, but they all led in. None led out.

I grabbed my flashlight from the glove compartment. The beam looked weak against the darkness, barely reaching the nearest headstones. Names and dates blurred together on the stones, sometimes changing when I looked back at them.

My phone vibrated in my pocket. Impossible—it had died minutes ago. The screen showed a message from an unknown number:

“Welcome to your funeral. Please be seated.”

The clock struck eleven fifty-five. From deeper in the cemetery came the sound of chairs being arranged and a coffin lid creaking open.

The beam of my flashlight trembled across weathered headstones. My footsteps crunched on dead leaves, each sound echoing longer than it should have. The path ahead wound between ancient oak trees, their branches forming a tunnel that blocked out what little moonlight remained.

A crow called from somewhere in the darkness. The sound repeated from different directions, multiplying until it surrounded me. The birds remained invisible, but their wings brushed against my face and neck. My flashlight beam caught only empty branches.

The path opened into a circular clearing. My light swept across rows of wooden chairs arranged in a semi-circle, their surfaces black with age and rot. Dead flowers covered the ground—roses and lilies turned the color of old blood. Their petals spread out in precise patterns, forming symbols I recognized from the church walls.

In the center of it all sat the coffin.

The wood gleamed as if freshly polished, reflecting my flashlight beam. Brass handles lined its sides, each one carved with faces frozen in screams. The lid sat slightly ajar, a thin line of darkness beckoning.

“This isn’t real,” I said. My words hung in the air like frost.

A chair creaked behind me. I spun around, but the seats remained empty. Another creak came from the opposite side. Then another. The sounds moved through the semicircle as if invisible people were taking their seats.

The temperature dropped. My breath clouded in front of my face, forming shapes that looked almost like words. The flashlight flickered, its beam growing weaker.

My feet carried me toward the coffin against my will. Each step brought me closer to that thin gap between lid and base. A sweet, cloying smell rose from inside—like funeral flowers mixed with decay.

The lid moved on its own, opening wider. My flashlight beam caught something inside, and I stumbled back. My own face stared up at me, pale and peaceful as if in sleep. The body wore a black suit I’d never owned, hands folded over its chest.

“This is impossible,” I said. 

My voice cracked.

The thing in the coffin opened its eyes.

Its head turned toward me with a motion too smooth to be natural. My own eyes stared back. But they were too dark, too deep, like holes leading somewhere else. Its lips pulled back in a smile that stretched too wide for a human face.

Movement caught my attention. The empty chairs weren’t empty anymore. Figures sat in each one, wearing moth-eaten funeral clothes from different eras. Their heads turned in unison to watch me, but where their faces should have been... nothing. Just smooth, blank skin stretched over skull-like features.

“Welcome to your funeral,” the thing with my face said. Its voice matched mine exactly.

My flashlight died. The moon emerged from behind the clouds, casting everything in a sickly blue light. The faceless audience leaned forward in their chairs.

The copy of me sat up in the coffin, its movements jerky like a puppet on strings. Its suit remained perfectly pressed despite the motion. A drop of something dark rolled down its chin.

“The ritual requires a trade,” it said. “A fair exchange of flesh and memory.”

My legs wouldn’t move. The faceless figures rose from their chairs, their bodies twitching and bending. They formed a circle around me and the coffin, their blank faces somehow conveying hunger.

“Your seat awaits,” my double said. It pointed to the one empty chair in the circle.

The faceless ones reached for me with too-long fingers. Their touch burned cold through my clothes. They began to sing in voices that sounded like static and screaming combined.

The coffin lid opened wider, a rectangle of absolute darkness against the night. My double’s smile stretched until it split its face, revealing rows of teeth that glinted like polished bone.

“Time to take your place in the audience,” it said.

The faceless ones pulled me toward the coffin. Their grips tightened until I could feel bone grinding against bone. The copy of me stood up, its movements becoming more natural with each passing second as mine grew stiffer.

In the distance, a clock began to strike midnight. With each chime, another piece of my reflection faded in my double’s eyes, replaced by something ancient and hungry.

The ritual had begun.

The faceless ones dragged me toward the coffin. Their fingers burned like ice through my clothes, leaving trails of numbness across my skin. My muscles refused to obey as my body grew stiffer with each passing second.

My double stepped out of the coffin with unnatural grace. Each movement became more fluid, more natural—more like mine. It straightened its black suit and ran its fingers through its hair in a perfect mirror of my own habit.

“The transition has already begun,” my copy said. Its voice had changed, gaining warmth and personality while mine grew hollow.

The faceless audience swayed in their circle around us. Their blank faces twisted and rippled as if something moved beneath the skin. A low hum rose from their throats, discordant notes that made my teeth ache.

“Stop fighting,” my double said. Blood trickled from the corner of its mouth. “Each struggle only feeds the ritual.”

The moon cast strange shadows through the trees. My reflection in the coffin’s polished surface grew fainter as my copy’s image grew stronger. The numbness spread up my arms and into my chest.

One of the faceless ones pressed something into my hand—a small book bound in what looked like human skin. The pages fell open to reveal spidery text written in dried blood:

“The chosen must surrender flesh and form. The audience must grow. The pattern must continue.”

“Give in,” my double said. Its smile revealed teeth filed to points. “The empty chair awaits.”

The faceless ones pulled me closer to the chair. Their bodies bent, heads twisting completely around to watch with their blank faces. The wood creaked under their grip, the surface writhing with carved symbols.

A crow landed on the chair’s back. Its eyes glowed red in the moonlight, and its beak opened to reveal human teeth.

“Your seat has been prepared,” the bird said in a voice like grinding bones.

My copy walked around the circle, touching each faceless one on their blank features. Where its fingers passed, the skin rippled and faces began to form—all of them mine, from different ages and times.

“Past versions,” my double said. “Each one thought they could resist. Each one became part of the pattern.”

The numbness reached my neck. My voice came out distorted. “Why me?”

My copy’s face split into that too-wide grin. “The ritual chooses those who will make the best audience. The ones who understand the perfect horror of watching others fall into the same trap.”

The faceless ones pushed me into the chair. Wood groaned beneath me as the carved symbols began to glow with a sickly green light. Roots burst from the ground, wrapping around my legs and arms.

“The process has begun,” my double said. It pulled out my phone—my phone—and checked the screen. “Your friends will be missing you soon. I should get back to the diner.”

The roots tightened, pulling me deeper into the chair. My skin began to ripple and stretch, turning blank and smooth like the others. Memories flashed behind my eyes—my life, my family, my identity all being stripped away.

My copy straightened its tie and cleared its throat. It spoke in my voice, practicing: “Sorry guys, nothing out there. Just old graves and stories.”

The faceless ones swayed faster, their humming growing louder. Each note tore away another piece of my humanity. The book in my hand grew warm, its pages filling with my own story written in fresh blood.

The last chime of midnight echoed through the cemetery. My double walked away, its movements a perfect copy of mine. It would go back to my life, live in my skin, while I...

I became part of the audience. The perfect witness to the horror. The ritual had claimed another observer for its eternal pattern.

And somewhere in the distance, I could already hear the next victim approaching through the cemetery gates.

The roots burrowed deeper into my flesh. Each tendril carved new patterns under my skin, rewriting me from the inside out. The chair creaked as it absorbed me into its ancient wood. My bones shifted and cracked, rearranging themselves into a new shape.

My double paused at the edge of the clearing. Its footsteps crunched on dead flowers as it turned back to watch my transformation. The moonlight caught its face—my face—but the features had already begun to change. Its skin looked fresher, younger. The dark circles under its eyes faded while mine deepened into hollow pits.

“The change will be complete by dawn,” my copy said. A crow landed on its shoulder, talons digging into the suit jacket. “Your friends won’t notice the difference. They never do.”

The faceless audience pressed closer. Their blank features rippled with remembered agony. One reached out and pressed its palm against my cheek. Images flooded my mind—memories of other transformations, other victims, other nights in this clearing.

“Let me show you what you’ll become,” the thing wearing my face said.

The world twisted. Reality peeled back like old wallpaper, revealing the truth beneath. I watched my double return to the diner in my car. The scene played out like a movie:

Chris looked up from his phone. “Find anything out there?”

“Nothing but old graves,” my copy said. It slid into the booth with perfect casualness. “You guys were just trying to scare me.”

Megan’s eyes narrowed. Something in her recognized the oddness, but the thought slipped away before it could form.

The vision shifted. Days passed in seconds. I watched my double take over my life, speak with my voice, smile with my face. But small things changed. Its movements grew more predatory. Its eyes gleamed with ancient hunger when no one looked directly at it.

More victims came to the clearing. My copy guided them here with whispered stories and subtle manipulations. The audience grew. The pattern continued.

Back in the clearing, my skin had begun to smooth over. My features melted like wax, leaving behind a blank canvas. The roots pulsed with each beat of my fading heart.

“Your turn approaches,” my double said. Its grin stretched wider than human bones should allow. “The next one comes tonight. A girl who heard stories of the cemetery. She’ll need a proper audience.”

The faceless ones swayed in their eternal dance. Their bodies bent and twisted with immortal patience. I tried to scream but my mouth had already sealed over, leaving only smooth skin.

My phone lay in the dead flowers where my copy had dropped it. The screen lit up with a text from Megan:

“Something’s wrong with the Jacob who came back.”

But her realization came too late. The roots claimed the last of my humanity. My bones settled into their new configuration—an eternal witness trapped in this clearing. My body fused with the chair as my mind expanded to join the others.

The crow spread its wings and screamed a human scream. Dawn crept over the horizon, painting the cemetery in shades of blood. My double walked away wearing my life like a new suit, leaving me to wait in the audience.

The book of skin and blood dropped from my nerveless fingers. Its pages filled with my story, adding to the record of all who had come before. The ritual had claimed another observer, another piece of its growing pattern.

In the distance, a car’s headlights swept the cemetery gates. A new victim approached, drawn by whispered stories and midnight dares. The audience stirred in their chairs, blank faces turning toward the sound.

The show was about to begin again.

Time moved differently in the clearing. Each night stretched into an eternity of waiting. Our chairs creaked in perfect unison as new victims approached. The audience never tired, never aged, never looked away. We existed only to witness.

A year passed in the world outside. My double lived my life with inhuman precision. It wore my skin and spoke with my voice, but small changes crept in. My friends drifted away one by one. Their instincts warned them something was off even as their minds refused to understand.

Megan lasted the longest. Her text messages to my old phone grew more desperate:

“You’ve changed.”

“This isn’t you anymore.”

“What happened in the cemetery?”

The thing wearing my face deleted each message with a smile. Its fingers left frost on the phone screen.

Our clearing drew more victims. A teenage boy on a dare. A woman investigating local legends. A paranormal researcher with cameras and equipment. Each one found the funeral waiting. Each one joined our ranks.

The transformations grew more elaborate. The ritual learned from each victim, refined its methods. The roots dug deeper. The pattern expanded.

I memorized every detail of our prison. The chairs arranged in a perfect circle, each one carved from wood older than human civilization. The symbols hidden in the grain shifted and changed with each viewing. Dead flowers covered the ground in patterns similar to the ones etched into our bones.

My double returned on the anniversary of my transformation. Frost spread across the grass with each step as it entered our clearing. Its movements had grown more fluid, more predatory. My old face had become a mask it wore with practiced ease.

“The pattern grows stronger,” it said. Its voice echoed with the sounds of other stolen lives. “Each witness adds to our collection.”

The faceless audience turned as one to watch it pass. Our blank features rippled with shared memory. The thing wearing my skin touched each chair, trailing ice crystals in its wake.

“Your contributions have been invaluable,” my copy said. “The horror in their eyes when they recognize a friend in the audience... exquisite.”

A new victim’s car pulled into the cemetery. Headlights swept across ancient tombstones as tires crunched on gravel. The engine died with a final sputter.

“Right on schedule,” my double said. A crow landed on its shoulder, its beak filled with human teeth. “She’s been asking questions about her missing brother—the paranormal researcher who joined you last month.”

The audience straightened in their chairs. Our bodies creaked and contorted as we prepared for the show. The ritual demanded perfect witnesses.

My copy adjusted its tie and smiled. “I’ll leave you to your duties. The pattern must be maintained.”

It walked away, frost melting in its footsteps. The crow spread its wings and screamed with my original voice—the last piece of humanity the ritual had stripped away.

Footsteps approached through the cemetery. A flashlight beam bounced between headstones, drawing closer to our clearing. The coffin lid creaked open as roots stirred beneath the earth.

The book of skin and blood appeared in my lap. Its pages turned by themselves, making space for a new story. The audience leaned forward in their chairs, blank faces eager for the next performance.

A young woman stepped into our clearing. Her flashlight beam caught the funeral setup, the waiting coffin, the circle of faceless watchers. Recognition dawned in her eyes as she stared at my chair.

“Jacob?” she asked. “Is that you?”

But I couldn’t answer. None of us could. We only watched, eternal witnesses to the pattern’s growing power. Our blank faces reflected her horror as the roots began to stir.

The ritual had begun again. The audience settled in for another show.

And somewhere in the darkness, the thing wearing my face smiled and began planning its next [collection](https://www.reddit.com/user/NekroLore/comments/1hon9u5/hello_dreadites_dying_for_more/).
