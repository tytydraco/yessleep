Hey, Reddit, I'm back again because a few things happened after I posted about the disappearances yesterday. The first thing is probably the "best." Not really. For anyone who's finding this just now, the first post is a day old.

I got two packages sent to my house yesterday. One was absolutely normal, just materials to make a gift for Marie. (I make dolls in my spare time and wanted to make three, two for her to keep and one to bury. They're going to look like her and Calla's favorite characters). The other package was just plain eerie.

Two trail-cam photos of girls. One was Mitzy Hollinger (twenty), the other was Charity Albright. Mitzy's picture is too disturbing to describe first, so we're getting the other events of yesterday first. Sorry to everyone who wanted the weird crap, y'all have to wait a second.

So, as soon as I got the photos, I went to the cops and wasn't the only one there. Mrs. Albright was reporting the disappearances of her daughters, Charity (thirteen) and Valentine (five). She and her husband had to go to a real estate convention two days ago, so they hired Mitzy to watch over the girls. She was a college student with a good head on her shoulders from what I've heard. Studious and helpful, never one to hurt others. She was the valedictorian in high school. That type of person.

Mrs. Albright was screaming at the police chief, Howard, screaming that he couldn't understand her loss and agony because he wasn't a parent. I'm not going to write what she said because it was terrible. I just sat on the l'il folding chair while waiting for her to finish up, and it felt like it had taken forever. When she finally was done, I showed Howard the pictures, and he asked to keep them. I actually photocopied them before, and I'm staring at them as I type this up.

When Mrs. Albright saw me, she asked if my dad could help out (he's a retired cop, thirty years on the force). I said, "I'm sorry, but there's not much he could do. What happened, though?" She showed me the videos on her phone, and I almost wish she hadn't.

Mitzy showed up shortly after the Albrights left, and Charity had talked to her on the porch for a few minutes about what they were going to do that night. It was almost all fine and dandy, but Mitzy looked....so wholly wrong. Like, she looked like a bloated corpse at times and nothing but bones at others. Charity didn't seem to notice because she let her in, and everything seemed fine for a few hours.

At around 8PM, the girls left. Valentine was happy and talking in a singsong voice. At one point, she said, "Alice, Alice! We're off to see Alice!" Charity held her hand and told her to be quiet, all while nervously looking at Mitzy. I wonder if she saw the same thing I did.

Mitzy returned to the house at 3AM, but it was too dark to see much else. Despite that, I know there was blood on her.

Now, back to the trail-cam photos. Charity's photo consists of her running past the trees, and there was some blood on the skirt of her nightgown. I recognized the location because the trail-cams belonged to my family. (I used to be scared of the animals that live in the woods, so my dad put them up). That one was taken at 1:35AM.

As for Mitzy's photo, I'll do my best to describe it. She's walking past the camera, head held high and eyes alert on something in front of her. There's some blood on her hands and in her hair, just enough to tell what it is. Her body looks so horribly wrong. Her left leg is just ribbon-like flesh clinging to something that isn't even bone, too oddly shaped and the entire wrong color. I don't even know what color it is. The nails on her right hand were long and black, curled up a bit at the ends. Her right leg looks more like a hoof. The time showed 1:20AM.

I didn't want to show them to Mrs. Albright at first, but I felt compelled to. I wish I hadn't. The wail that escaped her was so terrible and animalistic, I can never wish that sound on anyone. I haven't showed them to my parents yet, but I will soon.

Thanks to everyone who read my first post. I'm going to do more research while waiting for the dolls to dry. o7

I just got a text from Marie as I'm finishing this up. She wants to meet me this weekend and hang out like old times. I'll report back with how it goes.

Edit: I'm never playing RE4R ever again. My dad and I were sitting on the couch and playing it not even ten minutes ago when my mom got a text in the neighborhood group-chat that Mrs. Moore died. Apparently, she had a heart attack from the sight of her missing daughter. If anyone wants to buy the Moore's horse to help them out, HMU.

Jesus Christ, I don't know what to say.

Some of you seem to be skeptical of Marie, so I'll find a way to let y'all know I'm still me every update. Thanks again for the concern, Nola signing off.
