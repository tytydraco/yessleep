My mother was a lonely woman.

She wasn’t perpetually sad. She didn’t drag around the house in the same pajamas for days on end, I didn’t see any tears day-to-day.

But sometimes at night I could hear her crying in her room.

I could hear her whispering pleas to God, asking for a man.

When she was sad, she worked in our garden a lot. We had fresh flowers, vegetables, even pumpkins sometimes.

I would help her too, and I had asked her why she liked to garden. She said it was therapeutic, like she could get in the dirt and bury all her problems and bad feelings away. Then they become something beautiful.

“It’s good for the soul.”, she would say with a sad smile.

My dad wasn’t in the picture from even before I was born, and I think Mom was worried about me not having a strong male figure in my life. That it would stunt my emotional growth, or cause me to have issues later on in relationships.

My mom was pretty too, especially when I was younger. I would see the other moms give her a narrow stare when she came to get me from school, and how the dads would offer to come over to “fix” anything at the house we needed.

My mom would always smile politely and say no thank you, but that didn’t stop the moms from their jealousy.

I knew she would go on dates. She would tell me when she would. She was always happy for a while after the date, and then one day she would be sad again. When I would ask about it, she would just say the same thing.

“Sometimes things don’t work out, but we all deserve love. I promise I won’t ever give up on love.”

I would wish that she could meet a nice guy who maybe worked at a toy store, or an ice cream shop. Then they could get married and I would make out like a bandit. But as the years went on, no new guy seemed to stick around.

When I was about 8, the crying at night stopped again.

She had been on a date the night before, and I had a sitter from the neighborhood watching me. When I woke up the next morning, mom was smiling and humming in the kitchen.

“Are you making pancakes?”, I asked excitedly. 

When she turned to me, she looked like she was glowing from the inside out.

“Yes I am, do you want chocolate chips?”, she asked me, pouring a spoonful of batter onto the hot skillet.

“Yes!”, I cheered, pulling out my chair at our kitchen table.

When we were eating, I asked her if her date was fun.

She took a small sip of her coffee, and smiled into the mug.

“It was so fun, we talked all about you. He was also a gentleman and made sure I made it home safe. That’s very important.”, she responded, stars dancing in her eyes.

“Is he nice? Can I meet him? Does he own a toy store? Does he have a dog? I want a dog! Does he-“

“Woah, woah!”, my mom interrupted me laughing, “Maybe all that sugar was a bad idea! He is very nice, and I’m sure you can meet him soon.”

“How soon?”, I asked, eyes wide.

She seemed to choose her words carefully.

“I suppose whenever the time is right.”, she answered, passing the maple syrup to me.

I was ecstatic. My mom looked so happy, and I thought that maybe if I met him, he would want to marry my mom and live with us!

The crying at night stopped immediately, but was replaced with low voices talking. A man and a woman.

I couldn’t hear what they were saying, but it sounded like the woman was upset.

The next morning, I asked her who she was talking to the night before in her room.

“Hmm?”, she asked, pouring her coffee from the pot.

“I heard a man in your room, it sounded like you were mad.”, I clarified.

She snorted and shook her head.

“No honey, that’s my audiobook. My doctor said listening to them before going to sleep would help me relax. I even listen to them when I take baths sometimes, they’re very soothing. Remember when we went to check them out at the library together?”, she asked me.

I did remember, she got a few different sets and they were in hard cases. 

“Oh, okay. Did they help?”, I asked her.

She nodded.

“I think so, I’ve never slept better.”, she said with a smile.

The next few nights, the voices in her room continued, but they seemed quieter. Like she turned the volume lower so she wouldn’t disturb me again.

Several weeks went by, and every morning she would glow. She would make the best breakfasts, every night was movie night, and I knew it was because of her new boyfriend.

As far as I knew though, she hadn’t seen him again in person besides their first date.

“Do you talk on the phone with him?”, I asked her.

She laughed softly.

“Yes, we talk frequently, why do you ask?”, she responded, turning towards me.

“You haven’t gone out at night again, the babysitter hasn’t come back.”, I explained.

“Ahhhh, I see. I do see him when you’re at school. We like to eat lunch together, which is easy for me since I work from home.”, she explained, smiling warmly at me.

“When can I meet him?”, I asked her.

“Soon, baby. Hopefully soon. I know he will just love you.”, she told me, pulling me into a hug.

“Can I know his name?”, I said into her shirt.

“Tim, his name is Tim.”, she responded.

I couldn’t believe it. I was getting everything I never thought I would have. I began to dream of family road trips, matching Halloween costumes, Christmas morning. Even though I didn’t have a clear vision of his face yet, I knew he would be handsome and kind. Exactly what my mom needed.

I just had to be patient.

A few weeks later, mom let me pick a scary movie to watch for our movie night. She warned me that it would keep me up all night, but I assured her I wasn’t scared. She reluctantly sighed and put it on, settling into the couch with a glass of red wine.

In the opening scene, there was a scary man in the house, and the teenage girl screamed and just backed up into a corner.

“Why doesn’t she call the police?”, I asked my mom.

My mom snorted.

“In real life she would, but this is a movie so it’s all pretend.”, she explained.

30 minutes later, I was holding a pillow in front of my face, shaking at the terrifying man that filled our screen.

“Okay, Mom you were right. I’m scared..”, I whimpered. When I turned towards her, I saw she was fast asleep on the couch beside me, snoring softly. Her now empty wine glass still in her hand.

I flicked the tv off, cloaking the room in darkness, before covering her with a blanket and moving the glass to the coffee table.

“Goodnight, I love you.”, I whispered, kissing her cheek.

I went to my room and tucked myself into my bed, nightlight on its brightest setting, but I was restless.

I tossed and turned, imagining my jacket hanging over my chair as a monster crouched low.

The curtains became a billowing ghost.

The hum from the heater sounded like a growl.

I sat up, sweating.

I put my hands over my eyes, and sighed deeply.

Then I remembered my mother’s audiobooks, and how the dull conversations did sound soothing.

I was sure she wouldn’t mind if I borrowed some for the night, since she was sleeping so soundly in the living room.

I leapt from my bed, and walked carefully down the hall to her room, quietly clicking the door open so I wouldn’t wake her up.

Her room had a soft glow, as she left her lamp on next to the bed.

I reached her nightstand, looking for the small tape player she thrifted a few years ago, but it was nowhere to be seen.

“Where is it..”, I whispered, gently moving books and jewelry boxes around her room looking for the black box.

“Maybe she left it in the bathroom..?”, I pondered out loud, opening the door to the wide space and flicking on the light.

And I wasn’t prepared for what I saw.

Some nights, it’s all I can see.

A grown man stood in the shower wearing a pair of what seemed to be basketball shorts, with chains around his ankles and wrists. Bruises crowded his face and visible body, and deep cuts ranging from fresh to mostly healed.

When I flicked the light on, he jolted, and his gaze snapped up to me. His eyes were filled with hate, venom. To this day, no one has ever looked at me with such disdain.

I was waiting for him to scream, or yell curse words at me, but I only heard muffled sounds.

I realized his mouth was duct taped.

I gasped, stumbling backwards into the towel rack.

“What are you doing in my mom’s bathroom? Who are you?”, I shrieked.

His eyes filled with panic, and he seemed like he was trying to speak to me but I couldn’t make out any words.

I could feel my heart racing like I was in my own scary movie, and then I remembered what my mom said.

“I’m calling the police!”, I yelled, running to my mom’s phone plugged in on her nightstand.

I picked up the phone and quickly dialed 9-1-1.

“911, what is your emergency?”

“There’s a man in my house… He looks scary, and I don’t know him.”

“Okay sweetie, are you home alone?”, the voice asked, and I heard typing in the background.

“No, my mom is on the couch sleeping. We were watching a scary movie but she had wine and she said that makes her sleep more.”, I responded.

“Okay, police are on the way to you, how old are you?”, the lady asked me.

“I’m 8..”, I cried softly, I could hear the chains rattling against the glass shower door in the bathroom.

“Sweetie don’t cry, I’m going to stay with you, can you find somewhere to hide? Stay on the phone with m-“

The cell phone was snatched out of my hands, and in a blur I saw it smash into the wall.

I covered my face with my hands, waiting for the scary man from the shower to grab me and do the same.

“What are you doing, my love?”, a familiar voice asked me.

I slowly moved my hands, and my mother stood before me, her head tilted slightly waiting for my answer.

“Mommy.. There’s a man in your bathroom, he looks scary like the guy in the movie. I didn’t want him to hurt you!”, I began to openly cry, big sobs that shook my small shoulders.

“Oh, my baby..”, my mom cooed, wrapping both arms around me.

“Is the man gone? I called the police.. Like you said..”, I started to explain, and through our embrace I felt her stiffen.

“Did you tell them where we lived?”, she asked calmly.

I shook my head into her pajamas, I sensed her relax.

“What did you tell them?”, she asked.

“I told them there was a scary man in our house, and you fell asleep when we were watching our scary movie..”, I told her.

She laughed softly, kissing my head.

“That’s perfect, they will just think it’s a prank or a sugar-high kid. Good job, my baby.”, she said into my hair.

“What do you mean, Mom? There is a man in your shower, and he’s scary!”, I cried.

“Oh he isn’t scary.. You just weren’t properly introduced…”, she said, softly leading me to back to the bathroom. The sounds of rattling chains growing louder as we moved closer.

When we got back to the bathroom, my mom left me by the door and stepped towards the shower. When her gaze fell on the man, her eyes lit up in a dreamlike way.

“Honey… Meet Tim, he’s going to be your new Daddy.”, she said with a joyful expression.

“T-Tim? Your boyfriend?”, I asked.

The man’s face contorted in pain as my mom took a closer step to him, she reached up her hand and softly stroked his face.

“Of course, we’ve been seeing each other for months now. We eat lunch together every day, and we have amazing conversations, he’s a great listener. I wasn’t expecting you to meet like this, but he’s lasted so much longer than the others. I knew he was a keeper.”, she smiles fondly at him, and looks at me.

Others? Were there other men in my house?

“Come say hello..”, she said sweetly.

I shook my head, and took a step back.

“N-No. Mom, I’m scared.”, I whimpered.

“Oh, don’t be. We are going to be a family now. The three of us, just like you always wanted, my baby.”, she told me, reaching out her hand.

I still didn’t move.

The man’s eyes were locked on me, a pleading expression filled his face.

Her face grew a puzzled expression as she crossed the room to me, and knelt down to look me in the eye.

“I don’t understand, this is what you wanted. You should be happy.”, she said flatly, grabbing my arm and holding it a little too tight.

“Mom, stop. That hurts.”, I whimpered.

Her grip didn’t stop as she looked at me expectantly.

“Mom…”, I whimpered.

Just then, a loud banging sounded across the house, and the doorbell started to ring.

All three of our heads snapped toward the sound.

“I thought you didn’t tell them where we lived…”, my mother said coldly, turning back to look at me.

Her grip grew tighter and tighter, I saw my arm turn white under her grasp.

“Mommy! Stop! I didn’t tell them!!”, I cried out.

“POLICE, OPEN UP!”, a booming voice sounded through the walls.

The loud voice distracted my mother long enough for me to bite down on her hand, which finally released me as I ran to the front door.

My mom screamed in pain and began to chase me.

“DO NOT OPEN THAT DOOR!”, she shrieked.

Just as we reached the foyer, the door bursted open. Two police officers stormed in but stopped when they saw me and my mom.

“We got a call about an intruder, and a child potentially in danger.”, the male cop stated.

“Oh..”, my mom laughed weakly, “Just an overactive imagination, I’m sorry for the trouble. It’s my fault for agreeing to a scary movie!”.

She tried to laugh loudly, but it sounded flat.

The male cop’s expression didn’t change.

“Why did we get a report about a man in your house then?”, he asked my mom.

“Well.. My boyfriend is over, and I think that’s what it is.. They hadn’t met yet, so, a little embarrassing for me.. But not a stranger!”, she clarified, wrapping her arms around herself tightly.

“Uh-huh.. Well let me clear this up and speak to your boyfriend, and we will be on our way.”, he told her.

“No! I mean, no, he’s in the shower. Probably won’t be out for a while, but you have my word.”, she stammered, wiping her hands on her pants.

“We can wait, it’s no trouble.”, the cop challenged.

The other cop was a female, and she knelt down to me with a nice smile.

“Hey kiddo, you said the man was scary, did you see the scary man on tv? Or was he in your house?”, she asked me.

“He’s in our house..”, I whispered.

“Mhm, and what about him is scary?”, she asked gently.

“He had bruises and scrapes all over him, and his mouth has tape over it.. Mom is right though, she said he’s her boyfriend..”, I answered, looking at my feet.

The room was silent for a moment.

The first one to talk was my mom, who laughed.

“Oh honey! Oh, this is a misunderstanding. The man has a bruise and it’s now a huge deal. I promise he’s fine!”, she said quickly, her voice growing in volume.

“Be that as it may, we are still going to talk to him.. This way?”, the female officer asked, gesturing towards the hallway.

It was silent again for a beat, before my mom exploded.

She began to shriek, and lunged at the female officer. She reached her hands up, trying to scratch her face.

She knocked the female officer over and climbed on top of her screaming.

“You can’t have him! You can’t take him from me!”, she shrieked, trying to put her hands around the officer’s neck while the male officer was trying to pull her off by her shoulders.

As I watched my mom get slammed to the ground and handcuffed, I felt my heart break. This wasn’t my mom, she was doing so good lately, we were going to be a happy family! She promised!

More police officers showed up, and another female cop sat next to me while they went through our house.

A few minutes after they arrived, the man from the shower was wheeled out on a gurney.

We locked eyes for a second, and a single tear just ran down his face.

“We called your aunt, she’s coming to get you..”, the officer told me softly.

I nodded, but then remembered.

“What about the others?”, I asked.

The officer looked at me with confusion.

“What do you mean, sweetheart?”, she asked me.

“Mom said he did better than the others, does that mean there are other men in my house?”, I asked.

Her face turned white, and she glanced up to a passing officer.

“Give me one second, I’ll be right back.”, she said gently, rushing to say something quietly to the first officer who came into the house.

He listened to her before his eyes widened and he looked my way, walking over quickly.

“Hey kiddo, how are you doing?”, he asked.

I shrugged.

“Yeah, I bet. So what did your mom mean by others? Did you ever see any other men in your house?”, I he asked.

I shook my head.

“No. But she said Tim was here for months, and she’s been happy for months. So maybe the others were her other boyfriends.”, I said softly.

The officer nodded.

“Was your mom happy a lot?”, he asked me.

“Um.. Sometimes. Sometimes she would be happy for a while, and then sad again. And then happy for a while, then sad again.”, I explained,

“And what did she do when she was sad?”, he asked me.

“Oh! She said gardening helped soothe her soul because it felt like she could bury her problems.”, I responded, smiling sadly.

The female officer from before quickly walked away, I heard her asking for people to search the backyard.

The male officer just stared at me, his eyes glassy.

The expression made my stomach hurt.

“Is my mom a bad person?”, I asked him.

He didn’t answer for a moment, and then he finally responded.

“I don’t know, but I know she loves you a lot. Before she left in the car she made me promise I would look after you.”, he explained.

The tears came again, and the officer wrapped me in a tight hug.

And later, when the bodies were dug up from the yard, and the trials began and went for a long time.. I was starting to realize I would never see my mother again.

But I heard my aunt whispering into the phone about the last day of my mom’s trial.

As she was found guilty of 6 murders, they asked her why she did it, they asked her to give a reason to the family’s affected for closure.

Apparently she nodded, turned towards the courtroom, and said in a clear voice.

“Because we all deserve love, and I promised to never give up.”
