It’s quite true, what they say – you only miss something once it is taken from you.

On October 3^(rd), 2003, I stopped hearing laughter.

It happened at Frank’s barbecue party. Frank was my closest friend, and he loved nothing more than to drink, sing…and laugh. He was the heart of every gathering.

It was a beautiful day. The backyard smelled of freshly cut grass and smoky sausages. I could hear birds chirping above, meat sizzling on the grill. A soft breeze gently shook the trees and whistled past me.

We were all huddled in a circle, beers in hand, exchanging the small, forgettable details of our lives. Fred was swamped with hospital work. Rob’s three noisy kids occupied most of his time. John told us about his recent divorce, and his newfound hatred towards his ex-wife. I think that soured the mood a little.

Frank, being himself, decided to break up the awkward silence with a joke. I don’t recall exactly what he said. At that moment, I was busy pondering empty words of comfort for John. Whatever it was, Frank’s joke must have been extremely funny, because everyone laughed. At least, that’s what I thought they were doing.

In perfect harmony, my friends opened their mouths. Their faces contorted with glee, bodies trembling in excitement, shoulders bouncing up and down. Their smiles twisted and they shook like puppets on invisible strings. But no sound came out.

I could feel my entire body tighten. A violent chill ran down my back.

It felt like an eternity. All I could do was watch in dread, as my friends convulsed silently in front of me. Meanwhile, the birds kept chirping. The sausages kept sizzling. Frank was the first to break the silence.

“Tom?” Frank’s smile faded. “Are you alright?” he asked.

I mumbled some excuse and said I should be going home. They were sad to see me leave, albeit somewhat confused. As I walked to my car, I heard Frank tell another joke. I didn’t hear a reaction.

That night, I told my wife, Sarah, what happened. She raised an eyebrow.

“You’re saying…you can’t hear people laugh?” Sarah asked, grinning.

“Yes. Exactly. I see them laugh but hear nothing.” I replied, completely serious.

Sarah gently shook her shoulders and smiled wide. I assumed it was a chuckle.

“It’s late. You’re tired. Why don’t we get some sleep and see if you hear anything tomorrow?”

With that, we went to bed. But the next day, the laughter did not return. Nor the day after. Or the day after that.

Over the next few weeks, I became obsessed with my condition. I would watch comedy performances online, entranced by the eerie silence of the audience. I would eavesdrop on Sarah’s phone calls with her friends, noting the occasional awkward gaps in conversation that followed a joke.

Sarah grew increasingly concerned. The worst incident occurred at her birthday dinner, in her favorite restaurant. My mind was strangely at peace, and I was happy to simply sit there and enjoy everyone’s company. Sarah’s sister was telling some ridiculous story about her son misbehaving at school. Then suddenly, everyone at the table burst into motion. The room went silent. My heart got stuck in my throat. I knew what was happening.

 I watched my wife throw her head back, mouth open wide in a huge smile. She shook as though something was alive inside her, clawing and clambering to get out. Her face crinkled with delight.

Tremoring hysterically, Sarah’s sister smacked the table with one arm, clutching her chest with the other. All I could hear was the thud of her arm landing on wood. Tears began to stream from everyone’s eyes, as they convulsed all around me, their laughter silent as the void.

I should have been laughing with them. Instead, I sat there, frozen in horror. The joyous occasion had turned into a hellish nightmare.

That was the last time I saw Sarah smile. You see, when something disappears, however small, it can leave a bottomless pit in your world. A deep, gaping hole that will never be filled by anything else. If the hole is big enough, other things will begin to fall inside. That’s how I lost my family. My friends. My wife. They all fell into the abyss that was left behind by the sound of laughter.

Sarah called me crazy. She wept, trying with all her heart to understand what was wrong with me. I couldn’t stand the sight of her. I kept replaying scenes in my head, where at her happiest moments, she looked like a monster. The love of my life, someone who once felt so warm and safe, suddenly made me shudder and freeze over with terror.

Loneliness fell over me like a ghostly cloak. I lost contact with everyone. I learned to despise myself, to blame my fragile mind for dragging my life into ruin. I told myself that if I had simply tolerated these isolated incidents of laughter, I would still have my dearest people close to me. Of course, deep inside, I knew this was impossible. I could not bear to look upon any of them again. All I could see was their sinister trembling. Their shaking shoulders and their red, strained eyes. For years, I could never understand what was wrong with me. Then there came a day when I stopped trying to.

I started telling you this story in the afternoon. Now, as I finish, night has fallen. This night is darker than usual; I peer out my window and am confronted with black, endless void. My house is awfully still. I hear nothing but my occasional ragged breathing. I’ve grown old, and with each day I can feel my body turning on me. One of these days, I hope, morning would come, and I wouldn’t wake. I would finally be free from my curse.

However, retelling my story brought me immense relief. I felt young again. I remembered my family, my friends, my wife. Their laughter. Perhaps I needed to get it off my chest.

I’m tired now. My eyes are growing heavy. The world is about to fade into a dream.

But then I hear it.

A noise, from somewhere on the other end of the house.

I jolt awake. My heart thuds in my chest. My mind is racing.

I listen again. There it is. A sound, around the corner and down the hall. In the darkness. A deep, guttural sound. A sound I hadn’t heard in decades.

 

A laugh.

 

Thin. Raspy. Breathless. It grows louder. Closer.

 

They say you only miss something once it's taken from you.

 

Sometimes it's better not to get it back.
