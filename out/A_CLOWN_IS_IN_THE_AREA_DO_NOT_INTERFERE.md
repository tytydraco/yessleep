Thats what I heard from the news... 

but to give you context.. we have to go back 30 or so years in the past...

1992/03/18: I was six at the time and I was just your average boy just playing outside with friends and getting some ice cream but then out of nowhere a guy came up to us enthusiastically and asked us 



"Hey Kids! You wanna go to Runky and Friends World?"



To which some of my friends decided they wanna go there, I hesitated but then I decided to ask my parents for days and then after days of telling I would do my chores or anything just to go they finally had enough and they calmed down and looked at me and said



 "Fine... we can go to Runky and Friends World, But! on one condition, You will have to do extra chores for a week, Ok?"

  
"Yes Yes Yes!!! I promise I will do them!"

  
And then the next day as I got up I brushed my teeth, took a shower but then... I saw a weird looking silhouette and when I checked it was... no one.. weird.

  
So I then got dressed and packed up and then we drove and as soon as we got there... I suddenly felt... weird...

  
I thought it was nothing and we went inside and got our tickets but then... Runky the Clown came and I hugged him the second I saw him.. But he just pushed me aside saying that I could hug him later...

  
That was weird... But it gets worse

  
I then saw runky just being a huge asshole towards kids and adults and he even said death threats... yes.. *Death Threats*... and I was 6 years old and then after some rides and eating some weird pizza it was time and as I went to runky again I hugged him and his behavior changed...

 he was way nicer and he led me to a place and I sat with the other children... 



**But I'll never forget what he's done...**

  
He then got something and I thought it might be a trick and it was you regular "I will cut this woman in half" sort of thing..

  
I sighed as this was a bit boring... but then he took a chainsaw and just went for it... and the woman was screaming as if it wasn't staged and 6 year old me thought of stopping him but.. what could a child do against a man who's maybe more than 6ft tall...

  
But the children just watched with... *joy...* and that was very creepy as even the adults were amused as if its not something horrifying... but then a girl asked me

  
"Hey! are you ok?"

  
I turned to her and turned back... but the woman wasn't bleeding but it looked like if it was the normal thing... and even when I was a kid my parents would swear and I was pretty smart and I said in my mind

  
"What. The. Fuck"

  
And the second trick was a man and he was tied up to a wheel and he didn't have anything on.. and the kids and adults were again amused but... as I rubbed my eyes runky was inches away from my face and he asked in a somewhat sinister way

  
"Why aren't you watching the show? Is there something in your eye? here... let me help"

  
"No thank you sir!"



and it was still the same thing... the man soon turned out to be dead... and there was blood on the wheel... I had to get out... but I couldn't...

  
I saw many of his "Tricks" and "Stunts" and every single one of them was horrifying than the last... I wished I wanted to make it seem like a horror joke but... I wished I never saw that

  
I wished I never got Coulrophobia...

  
I wished I didn't see it...

  
But its too late...

  
and today Runky is on the loose...

  
DO NOT let your kids out, not in any circumstances..

  
He's a clown that's hungry for blood...

  
The Clown that always hunts for prey...

  
The Clown thats a devil in disguise..

  
Its been 30 years since I went there and it has been 21 years since I saw the news..

  
He's still there.. watching and waiting to hunt and kill you..

  
NEVER go to Runky and Friends world
