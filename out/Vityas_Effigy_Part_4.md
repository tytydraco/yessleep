Curly insisted on riding in the ambulance with Alice, while Victor and I tailed behind it en route to the hospital.  The twins stayed behind to talk to the responding officers.  I don’t know how long we sat in the waiting room.  Well, I should say Victor and I sat.  Curly paced back and forth, gnawing at his fingernails, his eyes boring into the tile floor.

Victor fiddled with the head of his cane, and I replayed the events of the last several hours.  When the police had shown up after Andrew called them, they cordoned off the apartment and declared it an active crime scene.  However, I overheard one of them telling another that he hadn't found any fingerprints on anything besides those belongings to the victim.  It was bizarre.  There was simply no way one person could cut a hole in her own stomach and run cello strings through her own vocal cords before wiring them into her lower jaw.  It just wasn't possible.  She would have passed out way before finishing.

“Mr. Canton?”  All three of us looked up as a doctor approached, looking grim.  Curly stopped pacing.

“That's me,” he said.  The doctor approached and shook his hand.

“I'm Dr. Grant,” she said, by way of an introduction.  “You came in with Alice Beckett, correct?”

“Yeah, I did.  Please tell me she's gonna be okay,” Curly said, fidgeting his hands together.  Dr. Grant looked down at the floor for a moment.

“Good news is, she's going to live.  We were able to do a skin-muscle graft to repair her abdomen, as well as remove the strings without causing a hemorrhage.  The bad news…”  She shook her head.  “The damage to her vocal cords was extensive.  We did what we could, but there is a very high probability that she will be mute for the rest of her life.”  Curly breathed a sigh of relief.  Evidently he was willing to accept a silent Alice over no Alice at all.  Frankly, I agreed with him.

“So uh…when can I see her?” he asked.  

“Are you family?” asked Dr. Grant, narrowing her eyes.  

“No, no, I'm her uh–”  Curly cleared his throat.  “I'm a friend,” he said finally.  

“Alice's parents passed years ago,” Victor interrupted, standing.  “She has an aunt up in Montpelier; I'm sure the police will reach out to her soon.”  Dr. Grant folded her arms.

“Well…I suppose there's no harm in letting you sit with her, Mr. Canton.  She is still unconscious, mind you.” 

“That's all right, I'd like to…she oughta have someone be there when she wakes up.”  Dr. Grant nodded.

“Hey, Curly, do you want us to stick around?” I asked.  He shook his head, forcing a watery smile onto his face.  

“Nah, I'll manage.  You two can go on home if you want…I'll call ya if I need ya.”  We told him to pass on our well-wishes to Alice when she did wake up before heading home.

Victor spent the night in his studio again.

In fact, he spent the next few nights in his studio, not coming to bed until at least four or five in the morning, if he came to bed at all.  The few times I went to check on him, he was talking to himself, sometimes in Ukrainian, and I could only catch a few things here and there.  One phrase I managed to catch bothered me intensely:  “She must have more; she is starving.”  Who was ‘she’?  Victor didn’t really hang out with any other women besides me and occasionally my roommate when he came over to my place.  I wrote it down in one of my notebooks and filed it away for later.

In addition to his renewed nocturnal habits, I noticed something else; his limp was getting worse again.  Victor had never told me what was actually wrong with his leg; when I asked, all he would say was that it “just didn’t work right”.  I stopped asking after a while, since I could tell the subject was very touchy for him.  Whenever he did come to bed, I would get a hot water bottle for his hip and make sure the pillow under his knee was adjusted just right.  

One night, I’d finally managed to convince him to go to bed at around midnight, a total miracle on my part.  He’d never expressly forbidden me from going into his studio when he wasn’t there, it was just something I refrained from doing out of respect.  The only thing he’d asked was that I didn’t go around touching everything.  This time, however, I was too curious.  I needed to see what he was working on so fervently.

I padded down the hall and down the stairs leading to the studio, slowly pushing the door open to avoid it creaking.  The studio didn’t look anything out of the ordinary, a few clay models here and there and tools scattered in organized chaos on the workbenches.  But in the middle of the room I saw it: Victor’s latest masterpiece.  It was life-size, carved out of granite, and depicted a young man clawing at one of his legs, unnaturally sharp fingernails digging into the flesh and leaving deep, jagged trenches, almost as if he were trying to rip it off altogether.  I moved a little closer, peering up at it and shuddering at the expression of unadulterated rage and loathing on its face, when I suddenly realized I recognized it.  

It was Victor’s face.  I stumbled back, shaking my head in disbelief.  When I looked back up, all the features I loved were still there:  the sunken eyes, the untamable curls, the chiseled jaw…it was all him, but twisted into a mask of pure hatred.

“What are you doing down here?”  I spun around.  Victor stood on the steps, dressed in his working clothes.  

“I-I’m sorry,” I stammered.  “I was just curious to see what you were working on.”  Victor ran a hand through his hair, hobbling down the steps and towards the statue, waving me aside.

“Wha–It’s not even finished yet, why would you want to see it like this?” he groused, picking up a hammer and chisel and chipping off a few stray chunks of jagged rock.  I stepped back, giving him room to work.

“Why does it look like you?” I asked.  He shrugged, not looking at me.

“It just does.”

“Vic, this isn’t healthy.  You’re going to work yourself to exhaustion, a-and is this how you see yourself?  Why do you hate yourself?”

“I don’t hate *myself,* I just hate this stupid thing,” he snapped, laying down the chisel for a moment to slap at his bad leg.  “It’s disgusting, it doesn’t work properly; I mean, who in their right mind wants to be around a cripple?”  

“Hey!  I’m standing right here, pal.”  I was about to go hug him when he picked up the chisel again, and I moved back a bit, not wanting rock shrapnel in my face.  “I don’t really care whether your leg works right or not; it’s not like I want to run marathons and expect you to go with me.  Why obsess over something you can’t really change?”  The hammer and chisel paused.  

“It’s not enough,” he said, hanging his head for a moment.  I wanted to say something, anything to comfort him, when I noticed a dark splotch appearing on his jeans, around his upper thigh.  Dark…and red.

“Victor,” I said softly, “Vitya…you’re bleeding.”  He looked down at his leg, shrugging once more.  

“It’s nothing,” he said, and would have gone on working had he not suddenly swayed, lost his balance, and crumpled to the floor at the feet of his own effigy.  I managed to catch him before he hit his head on the corner of the granite, and he let out a groan of pain.  With a great amount of effort, I hauled him back up the stairs and into the kitchen, leveraging him into a chair.  “What are you doing?” he mumbled, reaching out for me as I went to grab my phone.

“I’m calling an ambulance.”

“*Kokhanyy* (darling), you don’t need to, I’ll be fine.”  He tried to stand, but I pushed him back down.

“Uh-uh, you’re staying right where you are, Victor Levchenko.  You are bleeding profusely, and last I checked, blood is supposed to stay *inside* your body.”  He let out a short chuckle, resting his head on his hand.  

“Stubborn,” he teased.  

An ambulance soon arrived, and we wound up at the same hospital we’d accompanied Alice to just a few weeks prior.  I sat in the waiting room for a long time before someone came to speak to me.  It wasn’t the same doctor we’d talked to last time, but an older man with round glasses and a kind face who introduced himself as Dr. Finch.

“How is he?”

“Resting at the moment.  We had to sedate him for his own safety.  You'll be able to see him shortly, but I'd like to keep him for a couple of days for observation.”  I frowned.

“Why?  What was causing the bleeding?”  Dr. Finch took off his glasses and folded them, sticking them in his pocket.

“I think it's best if I just show you,” he said.  “If you'll follow me.”  Dr. Finch led me down the hall and into a room.  Victor lay in a hospital bed, asleep.  He was pale, his face gaunt and sickly.  I rubbed his arm for a moment before Dr. Finch cleared his throat.  “Miss Song, this is likely going to be disturbing for you,” he warned.

“I've seen worse.” 

“Very well.”  Dr. Finch cleared his throat again.  “Miss Song, do you know what a cilice is?”  I wrinkled my nose.

“Can't say I do, no.”  The doctor removed a white cloth from a metal tray, revealing what looked like a narrow panel of chainmail, over a foot long, with small spikes protruding from the rings.  Upon closer inspection, I saw that the spikes were covered in blood.  “Oh my God…”

“Do you know if Mr. Levchenko holds any particularly extreme religious beliefs?” Dr. Finch asked.  

“Not really.  Neither of us are very religious in the first place.”  Dr. Finch rubbed his chin.

“The cilice is a device used by a number of devout Catholics, mostly highly conservative sects like Opus Dei,” he explained.  “It’s meant to cause discomfort in the wearer in order to achieve penance for sins, similar to fasting.  Early models were made of animal hair.  Either way, they were not designed to cause severe pain or bleeding.  That's why I'd like to keep Mr. Levchenko for a couple of days.  This is concerning behavior that might suggest some psychological issues.”  I looked back over to Victor, so pale and fragile-looking now.

“He'll be all right, though…won't he?”  Dr. Finch patted my arm.

“Only time will tell.  But I will do my best.”  He smiled, trying to reassure me.  “You are welcome to stick around as long as you like; the hospital cafeteria is open if you're hungry.”  I was a little bit hungry.  Dr. Finch left to tend to other patients, and I sat with Victor until the rumbling in my stomach grew too loud to ignore.

It didn't take me long to find the hospital cafeteria, and with it, I found a familiar face.

“Curly?”  He looked up from his sandwich, smiling when he saw me.  There were dark circles under his eyes.

“Evenin’, Miss Livy,” he said, waving.  “How's things?”  I told him about Victor, and he sucked in a breath through his teeth, shaking his head.

“I'll be damned,” he said.  “Guess the whole thing with Sandra really got to all of us after a while.”

“How’s Alice?”

“Better than she was yesterday, which is the best I can ask for.  Her stomach is healin’ well, and she doesn't seem too bothered by not bein’ able to talk.  If she needs to say something, she has a notepad she can write on.  Speakin’ of…does the phrase ‘White Lady’ mean anythin’ to you?”  I shook my head.

“Not really.”  Curly took a sip of coffee and grimaced.  

“She's been writin’ that a few times.  Seems to really upset her that nobody knows what it means.”  He shrugged.  “But, hey, they're talkin’ about letting her out in another week or two!”  I sat down across from him with my own food.

“What are you going to do then?” 

“Go home.”  Curly set his hat on the table next to him.  “My dad's fixin’ to retire soon, and I told him I'd be willing to take over the ranch.  And I'm takin' Alice with me.  We've gotten real close over the last few months, and I wanna be able to keep takin' care of her.  I think the fresh air oughta be good for her.”  I leaned my chin on my hand.

“Sounds like a good plan.”  He nodded.

“We just gotta get outta this town, Miss Livy.  Somethin’ wrong about it.”  He took a large bite of his sandwich before pointing at me with it.  “You should get out of here too while you still can, both of ya…’fore somebody else gets hurt.”  After a moment of silence, he wrapped the rest of his sandwich up in a napkin.  “Listen…you think V would mind if I dropped by and visited him before I head out for the night?”  

“I don’t know if he’s awake yet, but I don’t see how it would hurt anything.”  

By the time we made it back to Victor’s room, he was just starting to wake up, blinking slowly.  

“Ouch,” he mumbled, before his eyes managed to focus a bit and he saw who was standing at the end of his bed.  “Curly…?”  

“Hey, buddy.  Figured I’d drop by for a sec and see how you’re holdin’ up,” Curly said, circling around to the side of the bed and patting Victor’s shoulder.  Victor let out a whine, reaching up and briefly resting a hand over his.  

“Not so good…I think I went a little stir-crazy for a minute.”  The two of them talked for a bit before Curly had to head out, tipping his hat to me as he left.  Victor sighed, letting his head flop back against the pillow.  “I’m sorry,” he said after a while, grabbing my hand.  

“For what?”

“Causing such a fuss…I didn’t mean to upset you, I…”  He sighed, rubbing his eyes with his free hand.  “She’s in my head, Livy.  I can feel her in there, gnawing at everything, and I don’t think she’ll stop until only the hurt is left.”  He shivered, staring up at the ceiling.

“The statue?”  I could only assume that’s who he was talking about.  His head snapped over to face me, eyes wide.

“How do you know about that?” he demanded, trying to sit up but being too weak to do so.  

“Whoa whoa whoa, hey, it’s okay, just stay there.  You lost a lot of blood, big guy.”  I fluffed up his pillow a bit and ruffled his hair.  “I um…I may have come to the gallery early one night and seen it.  I wanted to ask you about it sooner, but I didn’t want you to freak out.”  Victor sighed, closing his eyes for a moment.  

“She’s not a statue,” he said finally.  “The statue is just a representation of her.”  

“Who is she?  Madame Blanc?”  

“Nonono, Madame Blanc only works for her.  Has for a long time.”  He shivered again, and I tucked the blanket around him a bit more.  “We don’t know what she is, but if we continue to create things for her, she’ll help us in exchange.”  I frowned.  This sounded an awful lot like some weird cult bullshit.

“What kind of help?”  Part of me was debating whether to call Andrew or call a priest, the other part just wanted to make sure Madame Blanc and all the other creepy crawlies associated with the Inferno Gallery stayed far away from my boyfriend.  I’d do it myself if I had to, I just didn’t know *what* to do.

“The usual kind,” Victor said.  “Money, fame, success, inspiration, just about anything an artist could wish for.  Well…almost anything.”  A wry smile crossed his face.  “Even a saint couldn’t make someone as good as you fall in love with me.”  I rolled my eyes, pecking his cheek.

“You’re such a dork, Vic.”

“Well, yeah, but I’m *your* dork, right?”  

“Yeah, you’re right.”  All of a sudden, I remembered something Curly had said earlier.  “Hey, Vic?”

“Hm?”

“Does the phrase ‘White Lady’ mean anything to you?”  He scooted up a bit in the bed.

“Why do you ask?”  I absent-mindedly chewed on a hangnail that had been bothering me for a while.

“When I ran into Curly in the cafeteria, he told me Alice has been writing it down for a while, and she gets really frustrated because nobody understands what it means.”  I sat there for a moment in silence, gnawing at the hangnail until a sharp pain ran through my finger.  Glancing down, I realized I’d bitten it so hard that I’d made it bleed, a single crimson drop running down my finger and landing on the hospital sheets below.  Victor grabbed a tissue from the bedside table and wrapped it around my finger, holding it.

“I keep telling you, baby, you’ve got to quit chewing on your fingers.  If you needed something to bite, I’m right here,” he teased.  Ordinarily, I would have laughed and smacked him for being so forward, but right now I was preoccupied with the red splotch on the blank white sheet.  Blank…Blanc.  I felt so stupid right then.

“Madame Blanc,” I whispered.  Victor raised an eyebrow.

“What?”  I looked up at him, eyes wide.

“Haven’t you stopped to wonder why Madame Blanc hasn’t been around lately?  Ever since the gallery closed, she’s completely disappeared.  She hasn’t come to visit Alice at all, as far as I know.  Very suspicious for someone who is your ‘mysterious benefactress’.”  Victor’s brow furrowed, though he couldn’t stifle a brief smile at my imitation of his accent.

“I had noticed that, now that you mention it.  But why is it so important?” he remarked, still holding the tissue around my finger.  I was practically bouncing up and down in my chair.

“Victor, don’t you see?  Alice kept writing the words ‘White Lady’ because she was trying to warn us about Madame Blanc!  Maybe Madame Blanc is the one who attacked her!”

“But the police didn’t find any fingerprints at the apartment other than Alice’s,” Victor said.  “And I can’t imagine Madame Blanc would be capable of doing such a thing, she’s so old and small.  But…”  He trailed off.

“What?  What is it?”  Victor turned to me, his face draining of all color.

“No fingerprints…every time I’ve seen her, Madame Blanc is always wearing gloves.”  All of a sudden, he made a crab-claw motion towards his clothes, which had been neatly folded on a nearby counter.  “Phone.  Please.”  I handed him his phone, and he frantically dialed before punching the speakerphone button.  

“Howdy,” came Curly’s voice through the phone.

“Curly?  It’s Victor.  Don’t go home tonight, stay in a motel.”

“Why, what’s happenin’?” Curly asked.  I could hear a rumbling in the background; he must still be on the road, I thought.  Victor briefly explained the situation.

“That’s why Alice kept writing ‘White Lady’,” I chimed in, leaning forward so Curly could hear me better.  I heard the brief *ding* of a turn signal.

“I swear, I’m gonna marry that girl, she’s so damn smart,” Curly said.  “I mean, I was just pullin’ up to my house now…”  He suddenly trailed off, and I heard him mutter “What in tarnation?” before a sudden loud *thunk* was heard and he screamed.  

“Curly!  What’s happening?”  For a few agonizing minutes, we heard nothing but the squealing of tires and Curly throwing out every profanity in the book (excluding racial slurs).  Finally, the squealing evened out to a low rumble.

“She was…she was in my house,” Curly finally said in a bewildered tone.  “She came chargin’ outta the front door like a crashed-out bull, and then she was jumpin’ on the windshield, it’s a miracle I managed to shake her off…she’s just a sweet lil’ old lady, how did she do that?”

“We don’t know.  But obviously it’s not safe for any of us to be at home right now,” Victor said, seeming a bit calmer now that Curly was out of immediate danger.

“Yeah, no foolin–what in the name of marmalade!”  Curly had apparently stepped on the gas as the rumble grew louder.  “What the hell, jumpin’ Jehoshaphat, she’s followin’ my truck!  Gimme a sec, Imma see if I can lose her.  Then I’m drivin’ back to the hospital.”

“For goodness’ sake, Curly, be *careful,”* Victor warned.  

“Roger that.  I’m gonna hang up now, need both hands on the wheel for this one.  It’s just like herdin’ cattle, just, you know, other way around.  I better not get a speedin’ ticket, I swear to Sam Houston–anyway, I’ll see you when I get back, I ain’t too far away.  Catch up to this, ya old heifer–YEEHAW!”  And with an exuberant whoop, Curly hung up the phone.  

“That crazy cowboy had better know what he’s doing,” Victor muttered, tossing the phone onto the bed.  I, meanwhile, grabbed my own phone and frantically texted Andrew.

*-You need to get to the hospital right now.*

*-What?*

*-It’s Madame Blanc.  We think she’s behind the attacks.  She was in Curly’s house, we just got off the phone with him.*

*-Well, shit.*

*-YEAH.  Please hurry.  Curly’s on his way back here, but we think Alice is in danger.  Victor too.*

*-Wait, y are u and Victor at the hospital?*

*-I’ll explain later, just get here NOW.*

*-Omw.*

Andrew arrived at the hospital first, if the blaring of sirens was any indication.  When he found the room Victor and I were in, I explained the whole situation.  

“We can’t leave Alice by herself, and I don’t know when Curly’s going to be here.  Last we heard, Madame Blanc was following him somehow and he was trying to shake her off.”  Andrew swore under his breath.  

“All right, I’ll go check on Alice, you stay here.”  I knew I was going to have to tell him about the statue after this.  There were so many questions in this situation that I didn’t even know where to begin.  Before I could ask Victor what the hell was happening, there was a noise from outside.  

The room had a singular window looking out on the parking lot, and the blinds were currently open.  All of a sudden, the glow of the lampposts was blocked out by something dark and sticky, the mass leaving trails of viscous fluid down the window.  Victor and I stared at the shape for a moment before it suddenly contorted, and a face popped into view, ghoulish and grinning, the face sagging from the skull.  A long, slender tongue wormed its way out of the creature’s mouth, rubbing up and down the window as if trying to taste something through the glass.   Victor let out a cry of shock, pushed me behind him as best he could, and started fervently chanting something in Ukrainian.  

Before I could ask him what was wrong, footsteps thundered down the hall, and soon the panting, sweating form of Curly burst through the door.  

“I made it back–aw, shit.  She beat me here.”  Fumbling around in his jacket, he pulled out a small black cylinder and aimed it at the window.  There was a bright flash of light, and the creature let out a deafening shriek that sounded like it came from a thousand voices simultaneously before scuttling away.  Curly bent over, resting his hands on his knees.  “Damn,” he said, panting.  “She musta figured out where I was goin’ and decided to just come here anyway.”  He held up the cylinder, and I recognized it as one of those high-powered “tactical” flashlights I was always seeing ads for on TV.  “Good thing I always carry this on me, she don’t like the lights.”

“How do you know?”  He grinned.  

“I may be a hick, but I ain’t stupid, Miss Livy.  All the time I was drivin’, I noticed she kept avoidin’ the streetlights, my headlights, every source of illumination there was.  Figured this would keep her away if she came at me when I got out of the truck.”  All of a sudden, he glanced over his shoulder.  “Alice–”

“Andrew’s with her,” I said.  “And he literally *just* got off-duty when I texted him, so he’s got his gun on him.”

“Thank every god that exists and answers prayers,” said Curly, putting a hand to his forehead.  “She’ll definitely try to get inside,” he said after a moment.  “But, if you think your cop buddy’s got everything under control, I reckon I’ll stay here and look after you two.”  I nodded, grateful for the extra company.  Not that I thought Victor wasn’t capable of protecting me on an average day, but he was injured at the moment and still pretty weak.

“Thank you, Curly,” I said.  He smiled and took the other chair in the room.

“Don’t mention it.  That’s just what friends ought to do.”  I pulled out my phone and texted Andrew, letting him know what Curly had said about Madame Blanc avoiding the lights.  That was good to know, just in case she did get in, even if the hospital lights were very bright.

Of course, as my luck would have it, just as I had that thought, there was a loud pop and *fizzzz* noise from above us.

And all the lights went out.
