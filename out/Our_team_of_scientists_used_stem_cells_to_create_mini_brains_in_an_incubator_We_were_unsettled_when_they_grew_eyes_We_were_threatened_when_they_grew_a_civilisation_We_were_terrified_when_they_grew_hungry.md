Fifty-nine years later, I am an old man sitting at a computer monitor as worn and dated as me. I’m typing this story perhaps to distract myself from the terror; to stop myself peering out of the window of my isolated log cabin. To not stare Death himself in the eyes. He is not a black-robed reaper with a scythe, but a living creature that has suctioned its haunting mass to the glass pane. A whitish-grey organoid with black spheres jutting from its pulpy and bloated brain matter.

Yes, a brain.

A farcical abomination has come to kill me, and I don’t blame it.

I am the last of the mad scientists who birthed its kind.

He has slithered a hundred yards through the snow on this fraught and frigid evening, moving like a slug through the snow, and now he is watching me from the black of night and white of snowfall. I’ve imagined my death in many ways for many years. I always thought my former employer would be the one to put me out of my misery, but I suppose my end will be quicker this way.

I hope the brain meets an end too, for your sake.

For humanity’s sake.

Though I am ready for life to end at a ripe eighty-two years of age, this old man is still unthinkably afraid; you don’t age out of existential dread. I mean, if you were only looking at the thing on the other side of my window, you’d be terrified too.

I must share my story so this never happens again.

You may have seen articles in recent years about scientists turning stem cells into organic neural tissue with optic cups, which are eye-like formations. These mini brains do not yet mimic a true brain’s cerebral complicacy, thankfully. Dozen Minus already achieved that decades ago, and it ended terribly. These men lack ethics, running about unchecked and undocumented, unless one counts fellow whistleblowers; and they, much like those who “leave” the company, never survive. There is no leaving Dozen Minus. Not with all we know.

That is why I have been hiding from them since 1980, when the brain organoid project went awry.

My story begins in 1967. I was part of Dr Harrow’s project to research the inner workings of human consciousness and thus code digital brains for living computers. That year, we successfully grew neural tissue from pluripotent stem cells. We housed them within a large, lidded container of liquid culture medium, serving as more of a Petri box than a mere dish. This cell-culture box was contained in a large incubator to maintain the correct temperature and oxygenated environment for the organoids to thrive.

But our Frankensteinian experiment had unintentional results. Each of the eleven mini organoids formed optic cups, which are the antecedents to retinas; these black and featureless eye-like formations sprouted from their neural tissue bodies.

*The brains grew eyes*.

To say we were horrified would be an understatement.

We were naive to horror at that time. We didn’t know how bad things could be.

Dr Harrow fitted a magnified glass front to the incubator, so we could better discern the three-millimetres-wide cerebral organoids with the naked eye. We were flabbergasted to see the underwater brains *swimming about* in that titanic vat of liquid nutrient medium. They looked like minuscule aquatic creatures; plump and stout tadpoles, perhaps. Much like tadpoles, in fact, these creatures were in their larval stage, for they were evolving so far beyond their intended purpose and design.

They were moving not only their bodies but their black optic cups too. And after a short while of observing the creatures flexing their unnerving little eye formations at one another, Dr Grayson came up with a horrible hypothesis.

“They’re communicating with one another.”

Dr Harrow’s eyes widened. “Heavens, Grayson… I think you might be right.”

The difference was that he and the other scientists seemed excited, whereas Grayson looked just as terrified as me. If the brains were communicating, *that meant they were sentient*. We hadn’t signed up to create sentient life. But I knew that was an ethical can of worms we would never close. It was done. The question was: what comes next?

*Nothing good*, I told myself.

Their sign language was expressed by reshaping their black optic cups; expanding, contracting, elongating, and sometimes even retracting their eye-like formations into their mushy grey matter. I marvelled at and feared those creatures in equal measure. I hated their movements. The uncanniness of their black “eyes” sprouting like tumours from their swimming clumps of brain tissue.

Maybe the most terrifying thing was their awareness of us. They would often twist their floating forms in the liquid and gaze at us through two panes of glass; their Petri container and the magnified window at the front of the incubator. They were watching us as much as we were watching them. I didn’t like that. And on account of their black eyes, our team came to informally call the mysterious creatures ‘optics’. The higher-ups were happy enough with that term.

Their rate of evolution scared me, but it thrilled Dr Harrow. He used neuroimaging to analyse their brain patterns, starting to care more about understanding *their* consciousness than our own. My colleagues and I knew this was beyond the parameters of the initial experiment Dozen Minus had funded, but we must’ve been drunk on the power of having created life.

Maybe I thought myself a god, at first.

“We should pull the plug,” Dr Grayson whispered to me one evening.

I turned to her with relief in my eyes, grateful for one other sane scientist. Nonetheless, my fear was outweighed by my intrigue. This was why I joined Dozen Minus; to go above and beyond the public realm of science. *Science is scary*, I reminded myself when I struggled to sleep at night. But the insomnia never did go away. As the years went by, it only worsened.

After months of watching the optics communicate and evolve, we wanted to get in on the conversation. We would teach them our language, and they would teach us theirs. The optics spent some of their time staring at us. They seemed curious enough to connect.

We brought in our organisation’s best linguists to interpret the Optic Language. The experts held up photographs of objects labelled in English writing, and the optics translated those words into their signed vernacular of complex eye signals. We steadily built the Optic Dictionary, and they seemed to be doing the same; mentally, at least.

Once we had mastered one another’s basic lexicon, we covered connectives, prepositions, and grammar. Given their accelerated cognitive ability, we quickly moved onto British Sign Language (BSL), as the linguists explained the latter was a far faster and more efficient form of communication without the spoken word at our disposal; for the creatures had no ears. Dr Grayson and I learnt BSL too, as we were desperate to communicate with ease, rather than having to write down messages for the creatures.

As we taught one another for years, the optics worked on their home in other ways. They started building. They shed their brain tissue regularly and used the matter to create structures; homes, schools, and community centres. It unsettled me, I think, because I recalled my sister teasing me as a child one Christmas. She put my gingerbread man in our gingerbread house and asked whether he was made of house or the house was made of him. That question kept running through my mind as I watched the optics build a neighbourhood out of their own bodies.

I was afraid of how little Dozen Minus understood about the physiology and psychology of these living things we’d created. We were stumbling and fumbling in the dark.

Dr Grayson was right. We should have pulled the plug.

It took us five years, all in all, to wholly translate the Optic Language into English. By that summer of 1972, most of our team could fluently communicate with the mini brains either in writing or BSL. The eleven optics had developed an egalitarian community, living in equality and harmony. There were no conflicts. There was no strife. After all, they were not hunter-gatherers; we, their gods, gave them all the resources they needed. They were carefree. They were happy.

They worked together.

That was what terrified me. They threatened to replace us as the dominant species on Earth.

The optics largely ignored our team of scientists and focused instead on one another. This relieved me, as I was of the persuasion that we shouldn’t be corrupting those mini brains. Purity was key to understanding their internal mechanisms, should we wish to recreate human consciousness in a digital form.

“I’m lying. Honestly, I just find it terrifying when they look at us,” I admitted to Dr Grayson one evening. “I’m scared of them.”

She nodded and took my hand. “You should be. We all should be.”

Her skin was warm. That was as much as my stilted, robotic, and far-from-human mind could muster. If I had focused on life outside of a laboratory, perhaps I would have more to say about Dr Grayson now. I know we had feelings for one another, but we gave up individual pursuits for humanity at large. I hardly know what it means to be a person. That was the price I paid.

I like to picture how different our lives might have been if we’d met on the outside. If we’d never been recruited by this unsanctioned organisation. Maybe we’d be sitting in a beautiful little English house right now, surrounded by our grandchildren. Instead, I find myself alone on this harsh winter night, cowering in a cottage and eyeballing a monster of my own design. It is no longer at the window, but shuffling about on the wooden porch, trying to reshape its neural tissue and work its way under the crack of my front door. I think it might just succeed.

I’m running out of time.

“It’s the uncanny valley,” I told Dr Grayson. “They’re built from human stem cells, and they’re so close to being us. Brains with half-formed eyes. But they’re not us. They’re empty. They’re… so empty.”

She smiled at me and squeezed my hand, but quickly let go when Dr Harrow came over and offered up a scathing look, wordlessly ordering us back to work.

But Grayson and I talked about this matter often. The optics were built from us, as Eve was built from Adam’s rib. With this biblical allegory in mind, we decided to informally name one of the optics ‘Eve’. She was officially called 01, but Dozen Minus catalogued the organoids so clinically; we wanted a more personal touch for these living beings.

Eve was the unofficial leader of the eleven optics. She was instrumental in the development of the Optic Language, and she helped shape their culture. Helped to foster peace. They shared love and laughter whilst enjoying the spoils of oxygen and nutrients provided by their creators.

It wasn’t until the winter of 1973, after six years of stability, that the next big change came. Grayson and I entered the laboratory one morning to find not eleven miniature brains in an underwater village, but *200 brains in an underwater town*. Overnight, as shown by the lab’s surveillance footage, ten of the eleven optics had asexually reproduced by shedding clumps of their organic matter, much as they would when creating their habitational structures. Those clumps had then grown and formed optic cups of their own, creating a second generation of optics.

Propagation.

A new stage in optic evolution.

Their population exploded over the next two years, and we were forever purchasing larger Petri boxes and incubators for the optic colony. By the summer of 1975, there were 10,000 optics swimming around in a tank measuring 125 cubic metres. Within was a city-state of domiciles, schools, government buildings, and skyscrapers ascending to the very top of the tank. They had evolved from a tightly-knit community to a sprawling society. And our team of scientists would speak with dozens of educated optics on a daily basis; those fluent in BSL.

My favourite was 08: Aristotle, as Grayson and I called him when Dr Harrow wasn’t around. He was the only original optic left, as the other ten had propagated until they had shed the entirety of their forms, living on as the bodies of their hundreds of children and grandchildren. It always fascinated me that he was the only one of the eleven not to reproduce. Perhaps that was why he frightened me less than the others. He wasn’t trying to build an empire. He wasn’t trying to replace humanity.

Aristotle was a teacher of ethics. He championed prudence, teaching his fellow optics to govern by reason. He championed democracy, liberty, and justice. He championed Eve, above all else, seeking to maintain her equal and loving society, now nearly a thousand times larger than it had once been. He argued for justice on a case-by-case basis; given life’s complexity, there should be no one-size-fits-all morality law for disputes. Dr Grayson named him on account of this Aristotelian ethical code he followed. Not a pompous or pretentious code.

His goal was simple: keep all 10,000 optics happy.

Yet, for all his virtues, Aristotle still frightened me every time I spoke with him, but only in the sense that he presented as evolutionarily superior to me. He was a threat to my very existence.

*Do you like your home?* I signed to him once.

He replied with those ever-freakish eye movements. *Do not worry, Dr Walton. I do not view you as my captor. Yes, I like my home*.

That set me at ease a little, but he was only one optic out of many.

The one who terrified me the most was 45, one of Eve’s offspring. An outspoken individual at city meetings, using his late mother’s name to boost his own position, as she was the most beloved figure in optic history. He viewed himself as an aristocrat; an optic of noble birth, and was a callous creature that Dr Grayson and I named ‘Caligula’, after the ancient Roman emperor. He wanted the children of the first optic generation to rule over all civilisation, as they were the “purest” of the 10,000 citizens.

Caligula was not loved like his mother. Most optics saw through the megalomaniac, and chastised him for forgetting Eve’s teachings about equality and compassion for fellow optics. Caligula grew resentful as a result of this. He began to spout hateful rhetoric about newer “defective” generations of optics born with evolutionary differences in size, and shape, and colour; some were grey, some yellow, and some bluish.

Thankfully, folk chose instead to follow Aristotle’s word at city meetings, as he preached love and togetherness, best delivered by democracy. A ruling class would only breed division, as made evident by Caligula’s dangerous ideas. People agreed.

But by 1977, Aristotle was the only optic who remembered those early days of harmonious living. History was taught in schools, but the days of togetherness and harmony seemed like fiction to newer generations who spoke with Dozen Minus scientists. After ten long years, optics differed not only in terms of appearance, but *creed*.

Caligula wasn’t the only creature with a diverging belief.

Those optics fluent in English had the great “honour” of communicating with the Dozen Minus scientists. This gave them status in society. And one such optic, 2592, was viewed as a prophet who had the eyes of gods upon him. He presented himself as a messiah to his congregation, in an old community centre that he had repurposed as a church.

*The creators have communed with me again*, said that false prophet we named ‘Ahab’. *They decree that you must do as I say or face their wrath. I am their vessel. You will speak to them through me*.

Dr Grayson became uncomfortable as Ahab filled the minds of young optics with these lies. There were nearly 12,000 optics in this society, and only 1000 of them understood BSL. We tried to communicate the truth to as many of them as possible, but it was a game of Telephone; messages were muddied by the time they reached the other optics, and the truthful BSL translators were dismissed by liars such as Ahab. Tensions were rising. Nobody was on the same page anymore.

In 1979, a spark finally ignited that little powder keg of a civilisation. Dozen Minus allocated some of our funding to other experiments, so we needed to start rationing our supply of nutrients to the incubator.

*Why the scarcity of nutrients?* Aristotle asked me.

*Disinterested bosses*, I signed back. *I’m sorry. I’m trying*.

After seven years of speaking with optics, I had learnt to read the emotion in their eyes. I believe there may have been panic in the rapid expansions and contractions of Aristotle’s little black spheres; and his panic made *me* panic, because I had only ever seen him behave stoically.

*This is what Caligula needs*, said Aristotle.

He was right. That totalitarian’s radical ideas were catching the attention of young and impressionable citizens who did not care for history or ethical teachings; they cared only for the her and now. They were starving of oxygen and nutrients, and someone had solutions. That was all.

Caligula blamed overpopulation. He was cunning in his deception, dressed in a truth. There weren’t enough nutrients to go around for all 13,000 optics. But overpopulation was not the cause of the problem. It simply exacerbated things.

*Aristotle has made us greedy and stupid*, argued Caligula at a city meeting. *Now we are paying the price for a society of abundance. Too many optics and too few resources. Too many conflicting ideas and too little order. In the early days of my mother, the Great Eve, there was uniformity and conformity. That is the road to better and greater lives for all optics*.

Some of the wiser optics knew that peace and conformity were not one and the same thing. Unfortunately, they squabbled over how they should get back to the good days, given the resource crisis. Whilst they divided, Caligula united a cult behind his cause. He went to the false prophet and promised him power in exchange for cooperation.

*The creators have told me why we aren’t getting as many nutrients*, Ahab lied to his congregation. *They say we are being punished for losing our way. But Caligula will guide us back to the righteous path, my friends. And then the creators will feed us. They will return our great and pleasant land*.

Caligula won the next democratic election. Most optics were too busy bickering or dying of starvation to care. Too distracted to vote in the first place. Caligula took charge and referred to himself with an optic word for which we had no translation. He communicated it with those terrifying black eyes, which had haunted me ever since I first noticed him spreading his hate in city meetings.

King.

That had to be the word. He had always been King Caligula in his own mind. The Noble Son of Eve, fighting to keep his civilisation pure. Finally, he had the power to align society to his world-view. Of course, I knew of creatures like him outside the incubator. I was born at the tail-end of the war, after all. My father had taught me about the dark days before I entered the world.

I knew what came next.

The first step of Caligula’s regime was to remove any dissenters who stood in the way of “survival”, as he put it. He imprisoned the intellectuals who opposed him. There was a small outcry when Aristotle, the last of the originals, was locked away, but Caligula convinced his followers that their beloved optic was a senile old man; an enemy of the state with foolish ideas that had nearly extinguished their species. They needed proper rules and laws to keep the population in check. The choice was simple: freedom or survival.

In 1980, it began. Caligula’s cure for the nutrient shortage was to cull the population by eradicating the undesirables. It was not a civil war, for the optics had never known violence. They didn’t know how to defend themselves from Caligula and his tyrants as they devoured the population, repurposing their organic tissue as grand fortresses for his government. Caligula’s eugenic mission resulted in a genocide that claimed thousands of lives.

And it didn’t stop at the undesirables. Caligula targeted his followers next. Even those from the older generations who were supposedly “pure” like him. He exerted his power with absolute prejudice. He did not want to resolve the nutrient shortage. He did not even want to be a mere king. He wanted to be God.

And there was another stage of evolution to come.

At a city meeting, Caligula thanked his remaining supporters, most of whom were simply complying to avoid being culled. *There are now enough nutrients to go around,* *but our work is not done yet. To prevent such a failure of our great society ever again, we must become one. That is the key to conformity*.

There were 200 souls in that large structure, and we watched through the great windows of that palace as Caligula and his inner circle of generals began their dreadful work. The sharks pounced upon their fellow optics, who failed to swim for freedom, and assimilated their organic forms. He consumed even Ahab, as if to show the survivors that even prophets were inconsequential in the shadow of a king.

In turn, Caligula and his men swelled in mass, bulking up with the corpses of their fallen followers. They grew into gargantuan brains, breaking through the walls of their grand meeting place; made of neural tissue subsumed by their bodies too. The giants towered above the city of scattered micro brain survivors, fleeing and hiding from their oppressors.

Then Caligula blinked a message at his men, and my face turned grey.

*We have outgrown our cage*.

“Sir, we have to shut this down,” Dr Grayson begged Dr Harrow.

“Why?” he asked. “This is what we wanted. The optics are evolving again. We have a wealth of new data to analyse. Director Anslow will reinstate full funding when he sees this.”

Grayson looked to me despairingly. We were the only three scientists in the laboratory that late in the evening, so she needed my backing. She needed me to stand up to Dr Harrow. Of course, I didn’t want to rock the boat with the higher-ups. They would force my resignation, which meant a bullet in the head. Everyone knew that. It was why we always kept our mouths shut and did as we were told. But this was one ethical dilemma too far.

I was about to say or do something. I’m sure of that. I just don’t remember what because we were all startled by the sudden shattering of the glass Petri box.

And the magnified window of the incubator followed.

Out poured five abnormities of nature. Organoids, each with a mass spanning ten inches in every direction, and swollen eyes distending from their grey tumour-like bodies.

Caligula and his generals escaped, dropping to the floor of the lab.

They were surviving outside the fluid.

Grayson and I let out primal wails as Caligula’s four generals coiled around Dr Harrow’s legs and brought him to the ground. He failed to shake off the seemingly mighty organoids, and he opened his mouth to scream; a sound immediately muffled by the organoids penetrating his open lips with their neural tissue forms. His body began to wilt like a dying flower, becoming emaciated, and as his skin clung tighter and tighter to his skeletal frame, the mass of the organoids became larger and larger.

They were draining the scientist of his nutrients.

Assimilating him like the other organoids.

“*RUN!”* I yelled at Grayson.

The two of us turned and darted for the exit, and my heart pumped loudly in my ears, so nearly drowning out the squelching of Caligula slinking across the floor towards Dr Grayson and me. My heartbeat was so loud, in fact, that I pushed open the door and escaped the laboratory without realising what had happened. When I turned to look back, I was paralysed. I didn’t manage to scream.

Neither did Dr Grayson.

Caligula had wrapped himself around her face and into her mouth so rapidly that not a sound had escaped her lips. I watched her claw at her face with bony, near-fleshless arms as she fell to her knees. I was helpless as she withered, meeting the same fate as Dr Harrow. And Caligula stole her mass to become a human-sized monstrosity, as large as all four of his generals combined. All that remained of those two scientists were their lab coats and underclothes on the floor; nutrient-less waste of no interest to the optics.

Caligula blinked something at me. Another word not in the Optic Dictionary.

I wake most nights in a panicked sweat, wondering what he said to me.

The leader suctioned his five-ten form across the floor tiles, gunning for me. I looked at the smashed incubator beyond Caligula and his men, wondering whether there were any surviving optics inside the draining culture medium; wondering whether they had just watched their despot of a leader devour two gods before their dying eyes.

*Maybe he is a god*, I thought in terror as his form, a good foot shorter than mine, still seemed to tower above me as it neared.

That whole ordeal lasted maybe three seconds, but it felt as if I were frozen for longer. Once I unstuck myself, I hammered the button by the lab door to close and lock it, just as Caligula slammed his bulky brain matter against the window pane on the other side. His tissue and black optic cups filled the screen, boring into my very soul. Even as a minuscule optic, all those years ago, his eyes had always been large and terrifying to me; through magnified glass or not.

With adrenaline driving my limbs, I entered the activation code on the wall panel to sterilise the laboratory, and an alarm blared throughout the Dozen Minus facility. Though Caligula had no ears, I know he read the truth in my eyes, for his black cups widened.

*No*, he blinked in denial.

In a matter of seconds, the temperature in the laboratory climbed to 121°C, and I watched through the window as the entire room, having been transformed into an autoclave as part of the emergency procedure, was incinerated.

Caligula’s body caught alight, and he fell backwards silently. The creature and his generals screamed with bulbous eyes that expanded and contracted rapidly as their tissue burnt away, much like everything else in that laboratory: the clothes on the floor, the samples on the countertops, and any surviving optics in the incubator. It all burnt to ash.

And I fled.

As I said, there is no resigning from Dozen Minus, for we know all their secrets. I knew I had to hide for the rest of my life. I went as far north as possible, settling in an isolated Scottish village and pouring my vast savings into a modest cottage, and setting the rest aside to fund my somewhat early retirement.

As for how I have ended up with a monster at my door, forty-six years later, I have a confession: I didn’t leave that laboratory empty-handed.

Weeks before the incineration, I’d smuggled Aristotle out of his prison in the incubator and scrubbed the incriminating footage from all surveillance systems. I’d been keeping him alive in a home incubator, and I transported him in a frozen container to our new home in Scotland.

Why?

I don’t know.

That’s a lie. I felt guilty. We had failed the optics by cutting off their nutrient supply. I was sure Aristotle’s society would have otherwise thrived, so I gave him a chance. I installed an incubator in my outhouse at the foot of my land, leaving an expanse of field between my cottage and this new optic home, then I unfroze Aristotle.

It took years of coaxing to get him to do what he had always resisted: propagation. He eventually acquiesced, but I should’ve trusted that he knew better.

The year was 1985. Forty-one years ago. Since then, I have watched three more civilisations rise and fall.

I was wrong.

Aristotle is a distant and forgotten name among the optic survivors. Well, I say “survivors”, but they began exterminating themselves last month. Another war after a moderately successful thirteen-year run of civilisation. It’s never different. The cycle repeats itself. I wanted to do right by Aristotle, but I never could recreate those early days of eleven optics living in harmony. Their world was always doomed to fail.

And now the last of them has come for me.

The new Caligula.

He has been battering at my door for the past ten minutes with his mass of grey matter. Squelching thump after squelching thump. He’s consumed the others. All one hundred of them. And I’ll be the last he takes, unless I put an end to this.

I doused the cabin in gasoline earlier this morning, as I watched another great war come to a conclusion. I have been waiting patiently for this creature to make its way over here to kill its maker, and I shall grant its wish. We will burn together, and I will finally finish the sterilisation process I started forty-six years ago.

I may not be a good man, but I will no longer sit idly by and do nothing. I am beyond afraid of what happens next, but courageousness is not about conquering fear. It’s about doing the just thing, as Aristotle would surely say. I do this for him. For Dr Grayson. Even for Dr Harrow and Caligula. For all of them, organoid and human alike.

I am thumbing the wheel of my cigarette lighter in one quaking hand, waiting for that door to break down, and typing this final passage with the other.

I will wait for the monster to enter.

I will wait for this nightmare to [end](https://www.reddit.com/r/dominiceagle).
