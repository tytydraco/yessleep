This is something I experienced years ago. It resurfaced and decided to haunt me again. I'm not someone who believes in religions or spirits, but whatever this is, I pray it leaves me again, hopefully this time it's for good.

I was 12 years old when this happened. My family and I visited the Philippines, specifically Baguio. We were there to enjoy the place and have a good time.

We went to many restaurants, watched some of the local events, and even participated in a few. 

It was the final week before we go back, so I wanted to explore some places by my own.
One evening, around 6pm, I asked my family if 
I could take a night stroll by myself. 

They agreed, you may call them irresponsible, but they trusted me, I was taught self defense and was armed that time.

So I went to the carantes forest alone to take a peaceful night walk. I remember walking for an hour, I was deep into the forest when I saw smoke coming from a certain direction.

As a 12 year old, naturally, I was curious about the smoke, so I followed it. It took less than 10 minutes when I found its source.

I saw a makeshift campfire, it was using both large and small sticks as fuel, it wasn't set standing like those you'd see in movies. It was just piled together.

But I noticed people around it, a good amount of them. I counted around 16? Maybe 17? It was night, so I couldn't get a proper view.

They were dressed in black and red cloth, and they were chanting something. I think it was Ilocano? I'm not sure, but it was akin to Filipino.

Anyway, I knew they were a cult. There was no way they couldn't be. So I watched them for a few minutes. They then brought out a huge plastic bag horizontally lined.

I'm not sure what it was, but something told that it was a sacrifice. Just as they were about to toss it in the fire, one of them noticed me.

They started shouting and pointed at me, I ran. I ran back to the direction I came from at full speed without looking back. It took around 20 minutes of running before I made it back to the forest entrance where I saw the guards.

I tried to tell them what I saw, but they just told me that it was probably just campers and I didn't see them properly. They didn't believe me.

So I just left, I made my way back to the place my family was staying in. On my way back, an old man held my arm. He spoke in Filipino, although I wasn't good in it, I knew a bit.

He said that I'm an unfortunate kid. It caught my eye and is watching me. I thought he was just trying to scare me, so I just brushed it off and decided to head back.

After heading back, I tried to tell my family what I saw. My siblings said I'm probably just trying to scare them while my parents thought that my mind was just trying to scare me.

Once we got home, I felt like something was watching me in each corner. I tried to ignore it, I really did. But even in public places, I felt something around the corner watching me even when nothing was there.

It went on for 2 years, I tried to seek help, the therapist said it's probably just from a traumatic event. Nobody would believe me. So I couldn't handle it anymore and tried to kill myself by taking a lot of iron medicine.

My attempt to kill myself failed since I just woke up at the hospital, but the gaze left. I couldn't feel it anymore.

Years passed without it and it led me to where I am now. I tried to kill myself a few days ago by cutting myself on the artery of my right wrist.

I was depressed and couldn't handle my life, so many things happened, my life was at the lowest of lows. But I somehow survived, and people reached out to me, trying to help me.

I was thankful, really. But that was until today. The same feeling that haunted me years ago came back. And this time I fear it's no longer just gonna be a gaze.
