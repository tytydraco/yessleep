First was the calm. An eerie calm, hairs standing on end protesting against the drowsiness I tried to force. A thousand sheep counted but to no avail as the fear of what was to come rose in a panicked crescendo. 

Sleep. Please. I don’t want to be here when it starts. 

A twisted blood eagle, every rib pulled from my chest as the wings of the damned. Flipped over, holding on desperately to the bed as if there was something I could do to regain control of my thrashing

Short silence. Still, the weight of the situation is such that I’m constrained to the most animal of movements. Have to be down, I can’t fall. I stagger as they find me but they don’t stay. The ground rushes up as I plead for help. The bed frame again. Every ounce of strength left to grasp on. To hold. To die easier. 

Another moment of calm, the shakes think they can be controlled but they cannot. Only one man governs my limbs, and makes sure to remind me with bulging tendons and flailing arms. 

I can’t take it. Survive. No one will come. I scream out into nothing, desperate for an end. I called a name but the words are lost, no one to hear. 

 His amusement gives way to a cold gray as my grip is removed with barbaric precision in preparation for what is coming. Levels of agony that I never knew were possible begin. The pain grows shallow and deep. My nerves are lit with fire, every ember burning hotter the harder I fight. 

I am in his hands now. I am no longer alive. Darkness would be comforting, as would light, but outside of time there is nothing but gray. I can’t scream anymore, my ribs are violently returned as weight piles onto my body and lays me onto my back. 

Distraction. He seeks only pain and will make allowances if I can create more pain. Grinding bloody angels wings into abrasive carpet brings him a great joy and makes me think less about the crushing weight on my body. We are no longer alone, voices try to lift me to safety. Don’t do it. He hasn’t noticed yet, my knuckles torn to shreds keep him occupied but any rescue attempt will certainly catch his attention. I can’t take any more pain. Please don’t make it hurt worse. I don’t know if i actually stopped screaming or if I just can no longer recognize myself. Choking on my own blood and cotton I try to explain why they can’t lift me but they won’t listen and keep trying. I really am screaming now, or trying, managing only a strangled cry to make them stop. 

They want to lift my head, it won’t work without help. I need to satisfy the man enough to lift my head slightly, so I need more pain. I can’t take the pain but it’s the only way. Even at the edge of time sacrifice and torment abound. The cruel, bloody wings grow darker, the faster I sacrifice the more distracted he gets. He still hasn’t noticed. They try to take my hands away from me but I scream even louder, and I’m doing so I am able to lift my head. They give me a pillow and despite my cries of protest sit me up. My body had started to decay and melted into the floor, with no time and no other options I am torn from my skin itself. 

It worked. The man didn’t see us until it was too late. Meaningless gray gives way to a deep black void 

An eternity spent in black, eons inside a day. 

A return, borrowed time paid back with gasping breath
