Day 1

Today I was presented with an interesting subject.
Male, late twenties, admitted voluntarily. Initial complaint: persistent insomnia.

At first glance, the signs matched the report: slack posture, dark crescents under the eyes, the faint tremor of a hand that’s forgotten rest. But body language only tells half the story. The way he spoke of the events during his insomnia—that was something else entirely.

He described it plainly, as if reporting a series of observations. No embellishment, no poetry. Just: “When I lie down, my room changes.”

I asked him to elaborate. He said that when he closes his eyes, the silence in his apartment rearranges itself into patterns, as if the walls breathe. He hears the ticking of his clock slow to a crawl, then stop. In that suspended quiet, he claims he feels another presence sitting at the edge of his bed.

“Male or female?” I asked.

“Neither,” he said. “Or both. Sometimes it feels like it changes depending on what I expect.”

He smiled when he said this—not nervously, but as though it were a fact I should already know.

During the intake, I observed something peculiar: though his words were bizarre, his tone was lucid. No derailment, no pressured speech, no flight of ideas. If anything, he was composed.

I pressed further. Had he tried medication? Yes—over-the-counter antihistamines, then something stronger prescribed by a GP. No effect. He said he didn’t feel tired exactly. He felt as if his nights belonged to someone else.

That phrase stuck with me.

When I asked what he meant, he leaned forward. His pupils dilated, though the lighting in my office hadn’t changed.

“They’re not my nights,” he said. “They’re his.”

“Whose?”

He tilted his head, as if listening to something I couldn’t hear. Then: “The man who waits.”


At this point, I should note: insomnia patients often anthropomorphize their condition. They speak of “the monster of sleeplessness,” or “the thief of rest.” This could be metaphor. But there was no irony in his voice.

He pulled something from his pocket. A small cloth bag, frayed at the corners, knotted with string. He set it carefully on the desk between us.

“This keeps him calm,” he said. “As long as I keep it close, he doesn’t climb all the way inside.”

Inside?

I asked to examine it. He refused at first, clutching the bag to his chest like a child protecting a toy. Eventually, reluctantly, he slid it back across the desk.

The cloth smelled faintly of smoke. I untied the knot.

Inside was a talisman—at least, that’s the only word I can use. A smooth stone, dark as obsidian, etched with shallow lines I didn’t recognize. Not letters. Not numbers. Something older.

When I touched it, a faint warmth lingered on my fingertips, as if it had been resting in the sun.

The patient watched me intently. His breathing shallowed. “Don’t keep it too long,” he said.

I asked him where he found it.

He laughed softly, almost kindly. “I didn’t find it. He gave it to me. Said it was rent.”

“Rent for what?”

“For using my body.”


I returned the stone to the bag, knotted it tightly, and handed it back. He relaxed instantly, shoulders dropping, eyes softening.

We spoke of his past—no significant trauma disclosed, though he avoided questions about family. No history of substance abuse. No obvious stressors beyond the insomnia itself.

Yet every time I tried to steer him toward ordinary explanations, he circled back to the man who waits.

“He doesn’t want me rested,” he explained. “He wants me worn thin. Easier to climb inside when I’m brittle.”

I asked what would happen if he succeeded.

The patient shrugged. “Then I’ll be the one waiting. And he’ll be the one speaking.”


After the session, I documented everything with clinical detachment, but I admit: something about him unsettled me. Not the words themselves, but the calm certainty with which he spoke them. Delusions are usually messy, frantic, desperate. This was measured. Almost practiced.

I am reminded of something an old mentor once told me: “Psychosis has edges. If you run your hand along it carefully, you can tell where reality ends and fantasy begins.”

But in this case, the edge is too smooth. I can’t feel where one ends and the other starts.

I carried on with the rest of my day—meetings, paperwork, calls. Yet when I returned to my office that evening, the smell of smoke lingered faintly, as if the talisman had left something behind.

For the first time in years, I hesitated before locking my office door. The shadows in the corner seemed thicker, as though waiting.


Tonight, I will file this under Observation: Psychotic Features, Differential Diagnosis Pending.

But in the privacy of this journal, I’ll write what I can’t submit officially:

When I touched that stone, my skin burned long after I let go. And when I closed my eyes in bed, I could have sworn I felt the mattress dip.

As if someone else had sat down beside me.
