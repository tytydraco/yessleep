[\[Part 34\]](https://www.reddit.com/user/RandomAppalachian468/comments/1jen20y/the_call_of_the_breach_part_34/)

Stars danced before my eyes, the lack of oxygen made me dizzy, and I fought to hang on to consciousness as the cruel rain drenched me. With all the strength I could muster beneath the wrapping of vines, I swiveled my head to ward off the creeping tendrils and thrashed against the roots tangled in my hair.

“What’s this?” Vecitorak hissed with sadistic glee, and as he looked down at me, the roots stopped just below my face.

Surprised at his curiosity, I made the mistake of going still myself and realized what he’d seen.

*No.*

With the book tucked into his mold-covered robes, Vecitorak slid clammy fingers of his intact hand under my chin to rip Madison’s necklace from my throat.

My skin crawled at his touch, the chilly flesh somehow even more disgusting than the alien plant life, but nothing could overshadow the abject defeat that threatened to crush me as he took the necklace away. I thought I would have a chance at least, some kind of shot at rescuing Madison from this nightmare, but instead I’d walked right into his trap. Vecitorak had always been two steps ahead of us all, and like a naïve fool, I’d believed I could beat him at his own game.

While I couldn’t see his face in the darkness, I felt the excitement in Vecitorak’s raspy tone as he held the simple bit of jewelry up to gaze upon it in the flashes of the storm. “Ah, I see now. You thought you could free her, did you? Stealing the sacred to save the damned . . . and yet it led you right back to me, all the same.”

Wheezing to drag in another gulp of air, I could do little more than stare at him, my eyes flicking around to look for something, anything to help me. The echoes of battle raged outside the shrine of the Oak Walker’s burst chest, but it may as well have been a million miles away for all I could do.

*If I could just reach my radio mic.*

“You are as blind as she was.” Vecitorak sighed and turned the necklace over in his hand. “You see us as monsters, demons, heretics, and yet the Nameless One calls to you regardless. Everything you cling to, everything you hold up as a shield to the inevitable tide, is a *lie.*”

I noted that the vines around me remained still, as if waiting for permission to resume their march up my neck and managed to draw a sufficient breath to choke out a few words. “Tarren . . . free . . . you promised . . .”

Vecitorak cocked his hooded head to one side, and let slide a low chuckle, one that almost rang with something like amusement. “So I did.”

He lifted the decayed, skeletal hand from his robes, and the snaking tendrils on the altar convulsed in response.

A grey corpse slumped to the platform with a wet *plop*. Tarren’s jaw hung limp, her eyes staring sightless, but something dark rippled over her swollen tongue.

My stomach threatened to revolt as I sucked in a gasp of disgusted terror.

Pulling themselves over one another in a tangled knot, a lump of black, greasy roots the size of a baseball tugged themselves free of Tarren’s throat and flopped onto the interwoven growth of the platform. As they left her, the grayness of the girl’s skin receded, her hair turned from moldy black to a frizzy brown, and the white film on her eyes gave way to their old cocoa brown. Black gore flowed from her wounds, and when the last droplets of rotten sludge left, they sealed behind them as if the cuts were never there at all. It reminded me eerily of the Lantern Rose nectar that Eve’s people made, except there was no vial, no substance; only Vecitorak’s arcane will.

Tarren’s face registered a brief glimmer of recognition, but then she slid into another unconscious slump, her little chest rising and falling under the filthy T-shirt. She was rain-soaked, covered in grime, but otherwise healthy as could be.

*So, it is possible to reverse this process. Madison can be saved. But how do I get us out of this?*

“A life for a life.” Towering over me, Vecitorak held the wooden dagger out so the rain dripped off the stained edges of the blade, and seemed to examine it in contemplation. “A pitiful fate for her, to be excluded from the Master’s triumph. You will see, once you take up her place, how you have so cruelly deprived her.”

Able to draw more prolonged breaths now, as if the growth entrapping me was as distracted as its priest, I dared to stall for time, my voice shaky and afraid in the cold wind. “Why are you doing this? You used to be human. You were just like us.”

Vecitorak laughed at that and held out his good hand for me to see the dead flesh. “Look at it, child. See what weakness lies in the thin meat of the old world. It flourishes only for a while, grows fat and old, then turns to dust inside a metal box kept out of reach of the worms. A meaningless flutter in the eyes of the Void, before whatever spirit you have passes on to oblivion in the vain offering to a false god.”

Kneeling in front of me, Vecitorak leaned so close our faces should have been inches apart, but in the dark, I could only smell his horrid, fermenting breath. “Our god call us to a different fate. Servitude through pain, strength through blood, hacking and gnawing until the husk of the corrupted self is cut away. With every life given, we gain a thousand more, and they will bask in the Master’s paradise, free of the poisons that cloud your minds.”

“Poisons?” Conscious of how close the dreaded oaken blade was to my body, I worked to loosen the constraints on my wrists behind my back and tried not to gag on how foul the air tasted.

“Lights that were not made to shine.” His bony fingers worked under the vines entangling me to pull a spare flashlight from my belt and held it up in front of my nose. “Voices not made to talk, wings not meant to fly, yet they do, guided by your obscene lust for ease and leisure. Your machines make you weak, your creations sap any true potential, an entire world designed to keep you docile and tame. You look upon us as monsters, but your kind are far more dangerous.”

“That’s a lie.” Finding it impossible to pick at the roots on my hands, I glowered back at his abyssal hood.

“Is it?” His gravelly voice dropped a threatening octave, and Vecitorak’s neck vertebrae crunched audibly under his cloak. “Then tell me, Hannah; what do you plan to do with your rockets?”

*He . . . he knows?*

My blood went cold as ice, and he seemed to appreciate my shock with a slight nod.

“You humans are all the same.” Vecitorak tossed my flashlight aside and strode back to the altar. “You’d burn millions of your own with the power of the sun, all to avoid the embrace of true freedom. Freedom from doubt over your choices, freedom from guilt in your failures, freedom from the burden of your own will, all in loving service to the Master. A selfish, stupid race, not worthy of what you’ve been given. Thanks to you, that ends tonight.”

Drawing himself up before the bloody spectacle, Vecitorak opened his book, and began to read in the strange, alien language I could not understand. It almost sounded like the silvery Latin I’d been able to decipher thanks to my mutations, but this was harsher, sharper, colder, as though someone had dipped each syllable in venom. The entire macabre world seemed to hold its breath as Vecitorak recited what struck me as bizarre, otherworldly names similar to his own.

*“. . . suen karuk Nazroc . . . suen dagos Uktar . . . suen moltel Koraxes . . .”*

In his grasp, the pages of the journal started to glow like red coals, the necklace lying atop it, and Vecitorak flexed his grip on the jagged wooden dagger in preparation for my death. Excited murmurs went through the Puppets as they looked on, and the bodies hanging from the vines writhed in slow-motion jerks of torment as the roots burrowed deeper into their sacrifices.

Static rose in my ears, strange whispers in my head, and I screwed my eyes shut as the growth holding me in place slithered upward once more, almost cresting the end of my chin. Terrifying images materialized inside my brain without my bidding, inky shapes that coincided with the abyssal names to peer into my very soul. Inhuman eyes of malicious fire leered at me, disembodied voices echoed from an endless expanse of blackness, and a rush of primal fear went through my bones deeper than my own understanding. All pretense of this being something simple, scientific, or rational flew out of my petrified mind as I found myself examined like a bug on a card by a gargantuan presence that hung just beyond my sight. It watched me with hungry patience, and while I struggled to pry my consciousness away from it, the enormous shadow crushed me under a barrage of cruel voices.

*Let yourself go . . . why cling to an old husk? It’s so warm in the rain . . . in the trees . . . in the dark. Just let go.*

Beneath the evil growth, I shook with unabashed terror, and in one final desperate attempt, I searched my own failing memories for something, anything, to hang on to.

Through the murky curtain of the storm inside my head, a pair of silver irises appeared, and with nowhere else to turn, I made a silent cry.

*Please help me.*

Tiny shoots fanned out over my left cheek, poised to dive into my ear, but another voice floated into my subconscious, kind and soft, as clear as if he’d been right beside me.

*Look closer, filia mea.*

With monumental effort, I forced my eyes open and squinted at the morbid scene. All I could make out in the shifting curtains of the inky night were the glowing red runes on Vecitorak’s book. But what good did that do me? I couldn’t move to get to him, or the book, and didn’t know what to do with it if I did. How could the book be my clue?

*Your fear is trying to stop you.*

Roots poked at the entrance to my ear canals, and tugged at the corners of my mouth, but a strange sense of calm eased my panic, and for a moment, my eyes drifted to Madison’s gray face. She continued to move her lips, reciting the same utterance over and over, and something inside my brain clicked.

*Her soul longs for a kindred spirit, another who can release her from the embrace of the Sacred Grove.*

All at once, the words made sense, and a new-found hope kindled within me as I scanned the other bodies caught in the vines. Vecitorak had been hunting people, particularly girls, because he’d been trying to release Madison by a similar spirit. That’s why he’d gone after Tarren, why he’d been frustrated at his efforts failing time and time again, why he seemed overjoyed at me falling into his hands. The victims were offerings meant not only to resurrect the Oak Walker, but to remove once and for all the lingering soul of Madison. Every single one of them had failed, and now it was my turn.

However, even as Vecitorak continued his incantation, I noticed that something felt off. The bodies in the vines squirmed in torment, the book glowed, but nothing else came to pass. Madison’s corpse remained where it was, and she continued her incessant mumbling over and over, despite the vines that attempted to choke out her efforts. As she did, it seemed the flickering glow of Vecitorak’s journal weakened, murmurs began to pass between the Puppet onlookers, and I noticed Vecitorak’s shoulders twitch under the faded cloth of his poncho.

*It’s not working. Somethings gone wrong. Why isn’t it working?*

Snapping the journal shut with a burst of frustration, Vecitorak whirled on me, and leveled his wooden dagger at my eyes. “What did you do?”

Again, the growth that had half-encased the right side of my face went still, as if the sentient plant life was every bit as confused and frightened as I was. Stunned, I couldn’t think of anything to say or do, as I hadn’t expected this to happen at all. I hadn’t done *anything*.

My silence only fueled his anger, and the mold king lunged at me, his grip on my throat tight as a vise.

With one hard jerk, Vecitorak ripped me from the vines, my legs kicking free in the cold wind. He snarled with deep, seething hatred as he shook me so hard that my teeth clacked together. “You tainted it! You ruined the offering! *What did you do, you filthy little thief?*”

My vision grew hazy, and the few scraps of vine that remained clung to both hands, keeping me from grasping at my weapons. I gasped for air and kicked to find purchase but couldn’t touch the ground. Vecitorak was strong, stronger than any normal person could have been, and his arm never wavered for a moment despite my fierce movements. His greasy flesh stank of rot, I could feel small things crawling off his sleeve to wander over the skin of my neck, and pain flared in my windpipe from the crush of his fingers. This couldn’t continue, I would suffocate in a matter of seconds.

The wooden blade rose, and I tried to kick him with my boots, only for the weak gesture to land a muted low on his fetid torso.

*Boom.*

A bright flash engulfed the morbid shrine, and the shockwave tore me from Vecitorak’s clutches, both of us hurtling end-over-end down the platform.

Heat licked over my chilled flesh, and as I tumbled through the air, I caught glimpses of the Puppets in a similar plight, their bodies flying like rag dolls. Broken chunks of concrete rained down alongside burning sections of vine, orange light blazed into the darkness from multiple smaller fires, and acrid smoke clouded over everything in a thick, salty fog. Tiny bits of flying debris zipped through the air, and they stung like hornets as the shrapnel cut into the unarmored portions of my flesh.

*Wham.*

I bounced off the small ramp of twisted growth, and felt the last oily roots clawed off my frame by the impact.

*Thwack.*

Sharp pain pulsed in my cheek as my face skimmed the rough bark of the platform, and I curled all four limbs into a ball out of reflex. Everything blurred into a kaleidoscope of rolling colors, and I couldn’t stop my rapid descent into the marsh below.

*Clank.*

A thick branch rammed into the steel of my cuirass, and brought me to a sudden, painful halt.

Coughing, I gritted my teeth against the soreness from various new wounds and rolled onto my side. Not far away, Vecitorak slowly moved to do the same, perhaps stunned, despite his immortality. A sparkle of silver glittered in the mess of writhing vines between us, and my eyes locked onto the turquoise stone.

*It’s now or never.*

On my belly I wriggled toward it, reached out with grimy fingers to snatch the necklace from the lethargic vines and gripped it tight in my cold palm.

High shrieks of rage burst through the ringing in my ears, and I looked up to see a flood of gray-skinned fiends boil out of a hole in the cement tower. The gap lay wreathed in flames, and yet they charged through it, over the burning walls of the shrine and down the rampway toward me. There were too many, I knew it in my gut, even as I groped with clumsy fingers for my Type 9. They would be on me in seconds, before I could even get a shot off.

*Bawooo.*

A hunting horn blared in the night, steel tank tracks clattered, and the Puppets on the edges of the shrine scrambled for their primitive weapons. Several were thrown from their perches atop the growth, bullets and arrows tearing into their gray skin, and the rumble of engines filled the air. Alarmed screams erupted from the mutants, but these were matched by others and at the base of the long ramp leading up to the platform, I caught the light blue glow of LED headlamps on drawn blades.

A loud war cry, an ancient one spoken with human tongues, rang into the night.

*“Deus Vault!”*

With a great crashing of metal on bone, silhouettes clad in painted steel charged up the ramp straight into the teeth of the Puppet guards, longswords cleaving a deadly harvest among the mutants. The nearest mutants crumpled to the ground, and my heart leapt as a wave of projectiles soared over me into the ranks of the enemy. A grenade detonated somewhere nearby, the night lit up with the *whoosh* of a flamethrower, and the Puppets screeched as they caught fire. Boots thundered on the ramp behind me, and two hands wound under my arms to drag me back from the fighting.

“We found her!” Someone hauled me to my feet, pulled my left arm over their shoulder, and a lock of bleach-blonde hair whipped against my bruised face.

Another figure did the same on my right, and I could barely catch his reply over the chatter of machine guns. “Almost dropped the bloody tower on her.”

I blinked, and stumbled into Chris’s arms as Jamie and Peter released me, my legs unsteady from shock. At the end of the ramp, the four of us were enclosed by a wall of Ark River and ELSAR troopers who fought viciously to keep the waves of Puppets back. Three MRAVs and one of the Abrams tanks formed a barricade around the base of the tower, firing outwards as our infantry tried to clear the complex itself. The rest of our troops remained in their circled formation at the center of the field, but judging by the sheer volume of fire going in every direction, I didn’t think they could reach us. Our foes were everywhere, both inside and outside our meager cordon, and there were noticeably less men and vehicles than ten minutes prior. No shortage of the enemy seemed forthcoming, the hordes of gray demons that hurled themselves from the forest like a never-ending tide, an ocean of teeth, spears, and death.

“Hannah!” Chris’s hard shake brough me back to my senses, and his wide blue eyes searched my bloodied face for a reaction. “Talk to me, are you alright? What happened?”

I glanced at the shrine and saw that Vecitorak was gone, a tall, hooded shadow swooping into the gap in the side of the tower just out of my sight. Behind him, he dragged a small figure by the hair, and I recognized Tarren’s pale face still gripped in unconsciousness. The other gray corpses were either burning or shattered by the explosion, but strangely enough, Madison’s body remained untouched by the chaos, her lips moving in their quiet mantra.

A shift rippled in my brain, the same odd sensation as when I’d read those foreign letters above the underground library in the resistance’s Castle, and I let *the focus* sharpen my eyes so I could see her peeling lips.

*She shrieks a name, over and over.*

As if guided by an unseen hand, cascades of memory tumbled into place. The visions of another person helping Madison through the dark, his voice calling for her to run. The photographs on the memorial wall in New Wilderness. The lost ranger from the earliest accounts. It was right there, the answer, the key to what I’d been searching for. I’d been so distracted over the necklace, the book, and the mutations that the truth had eluded me all this time. A truth that hadn’t answered to Vecitorak’s fervent utterances because it couldn’t; it wasn’t meant for him to use.

*There’s still a chance, we can still pull this off; I just need to get higher.*

My eyes drifted up to the cement tower, its leaning visage tangled with burning vines as the fire spread, but some of the windows at the top visible from where I stood. “I have to get inside.”

As I attempted to pull free of his embrace, Chris caught my arm, his face set in a bewildered, obstinate frown. “What are you talking about? The whole thing could come down any minute! We need an exit plan.”

Adam appeared by his side, battle armor smeared with ebony Puppet blood, his rifle empty and smoking. “Ammunition’s running out, sir. We brought one of the winged beasts down, but we can’t hold them for long. Where’s Vecitorak?”

“Where’s the beacon?” Without time to explain, I glanced around the jumbled chaos of our cordon.

“Here.” From the press of bodies, Colonel Riken stepped forward and dragged a sling-bag off his back to reveal the black plastic box inside. “But we need to get higher. The signal’s too weak from down here, and the radiation’s cooking the battery.”

“Highest place is up there.” Jamie pointed to the tower, her mask long gone, and few seemed to question her presence now that things had truly broken down.

Peter slapped another magazine into his rifle and shook his head. “That’s where the mold-king is. He won’t let us just waltz in and set up shop. If the tank shell didn’t kill him, then what are we supposed to do?”

“I can fix this.” They stared at me, my shout almost inaudible over the constant gunfire, but I could tell from their surprise the others had heard me. “I know how to kill the Oak Walker, and Vecitorak, but I have to get to the top of the tower. Once I’m there, I can plant the beacon, I just need time.”

Chris scowled and waved his arm at the carnage around us. “What time? They’re going to overrun us if we stay here, we need to fall back. I can’t let you—”

“He’s got Tarren.” I met his gaze, saw the fear in Chris’s eyes, and felt it deep in my own heart. “I can’t leave her, Chris, not to him. I need you to trust me.”

We were buried hilt-deep in this place, the lowest, darkest form of hell I could ever know, and every second brought us closer to death. The next arrow, spear, or axe could seal our fate, but we couldn’t give up, not now, not when victory was so close.

For a moment, his expression wavered, but then Chris’s mouth drew into a hard line, and he hefted the rifle that hung from his neck as he called over his shoulder to the others. “We’re going in! Jamie, Peter, Adam, on me! Colonel, keep them off us!”

At that, Colonel Riken tossed me the box and did his best to shout above the din. “There’s a spring-loaded tripod under the box liner that will let you spike it in place. Get it set up on the tripod and push the green button on the side panel. Do not push the button before deploying the tripod; it will automatically activate in five seconds, and you’ll get fried. Once you push it the right way, you’ve got ten seconds to clear the area.”

With that, he turned to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with his men, a light machine gun in his gloved hands. The colonel didn’t shy away from the flood of mutants but faced them with his weapon firing at full cyclic rate, the barrel glowing purple as it spat brass casings and steel links into the mud. Belt after belt he sprayed into the enemy, and even as they closed in, Colonel Riken never showed an ounce of hesitation. At his side, I saw Aleph, Adam’s second in command leading the Ark River warriors in their zealous rage against their evil kinsmen. Many fired until their weapons ran dry and resorted to their medieval weaponry, bone met with steel, teeth with fire, gray and gold slugging it out in the final battle of their great crusade. For a split second as I shoved the box into my own assault pack, I remembered how Professor Carheim had described these odd newcomers to our world, angles and demons of eons past, locked in a colossal struggle for our future.

*It will be on our soil that the gods of old test their strength.*

“Rangers . . . advance!” Chris shouted above the din, and at his word, I sprinted up the gore-spattered ramp. Jamie ran to my right, Chris on my left, Adam and Peter flanking them. Our guns blazed a trail before us, and with nothing more than our headlamps to light the way, we plunged into the shadowy bowels of the tower.

Chaos awaited us, our headlamps illuminating more Puppets that crawled through the darkness to leap at us from every turn. I fought alongside the others to gun them down as our small team advanced on the spiraling stairs, both terrified and gripped by a strange sense of déjà vu. Madison’s memories plagued my mind even as I followed Chris upward, and I ground my teeth against the whispers that lingered in my ears.

Atop the first landing in the stairwell, our team paused to reload as the battle continued on the ground floor below, more of our men pouring into the gap.

Something rustled in the window behind me, and barely had I turned, before a dark silhouette pulled itself through.

I brought my submachine gun up, but as the beam of my weapon light fell on the shape, my lungs twitched in a gasp of disbelief.

*Impossible.*

Moving faster than any of us could react, the figure was on his feet in an instant, the long barrel of a flintlock pistol leveled at my face. His clothes were torn, his hands covered in mud and oil from where I guess he’d clung to the underframe of one of our trucks on the drive in, and his broad hat was long gone. On one hip, he boasted the shining rapier I’d seen in his cabin on the *Harper’s Vengeance*, and in his free hand, he clutched his own cutlass. Wounds on his face and hands dripped blood, some from thorny vines he’d climbed to scale the side of the tower, others from blades no doubt wielded by countless Puppets he’d cut through. A deeper gouge in his left side leaked pools of crimson over his old-fashioned white button-down shirt, and a black arrow shaft stuck out of his skin by a few inches. Despite the obvious pain he was in, the wild-eyed man in front of me didn’t seem to notice as he thumbed back the replica weapon’s hammer with a definitive *click.*

His dark eyes locked on mine, Captain Grapeshot hissed between teeth that hadn’t been brushed in days, his hand shaking in manic frenzy as it held the gun to my face. “*Where is she?*”
