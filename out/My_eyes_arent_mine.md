Ever since I was younger I knew something was wrong with my body. I knew there was something off about it. But just recently in the past few weeks I realised my eyes aren't mine. 

Yes I was born with them but they never belonged to me they were a separate part of my body. 

I don't know how to explain this it's like a broken bone you don't know how your bones feel normally but when they break you can feel a unending pain jolting through your body. You know that your in pain but to anyone that's never broken a bone before it's almost indescribable. Your stuck in a limbo of knowing your in pain but you can't do anything about it. If you could just explain to someone it could be over. You can be treated but you can't. No one understands my pain. I didn't either at first. I just knew something was off. It was like that fact people used to tell me as a child. Your immune system doesn't know about your eyes. If it did it would attack them and you would go blind. However my immune system has always known they were there they just can't do anything about it. 

BuÂ  family members always felt the need to complement me on my beautiful blue eyes just constantly antagonising me about them and I had to laugh it off Just a slight bit of embarrassment creeping up me every time they said it. 

When ever I was talking to someone I would stare directly into their eyes just wishing I could take them for myself. It wouldn't be selfish of me. They have such beautiful green or brown eyes. Their wasting them. Taking them for granted. Their all so selfish. Taking them for granted. They don't understand my pain. They don't understand why I threw away every mirror in my house so that I don't have to see my fucking eyes. 

But I understand now sure the contacts I bought were fine for a while but they just kept getting noticed. People would always ask "Hey what happened to your eyes They used to be blue didn't they? Why are they green?" They don't stop reminding me now even when I have them in I can't look at myself. I'm just reminded that I'm lying they keep reminding me. They keep mocking me they say that I "look so much worse". Or that I should just "accept that I have blue eyes" 

So I took some. For the first time in my life I took matters into my own hands. I found a homeless man with the most beautiful brown eyes that were being wasted away on such an ungrateful person. I offered him a place to stay a good meal in exchange for a favour. He accepted without hesitation. He was so desperate. So when he fell asleep in my apartment. I took them. Finally my eyes. I had no need my old ones I couldn't use my new eyes of course but just having them. To hold to feel. I couldn't look at them anymore which is a shame but it was worth the trade-off. Now I have my own pair of eyes all to my self and none can take them away from me.
