Me and Rowan had only been in the new house for three weeks, a quiet somewhat secluded house in the mountains. Just in time to celebrate our first Christmas together. The boxes weren’t all unpacked, and the heat ran a little too long before kicking in, but we were determined to make it feel like home. I hung warm lights inside every window, set up our first tree, and lit a cinnamon candle on the coffee table.

The tree had already started dropping pine needles, but that’s what comes with a real tree I told myself. And considering the price, we got very lucky. Not the most normal purchase I have made, from an elderly man outside his falling apart farm house. It seemed to be the only one he was selling. But considering it was a week from Christmas, I happily took it off his hands.

“Cozy,” Rowan said.

“Almost,” I replied, rubbing my arms. “It’s colder tonight.”

Rowan nodded, glancing toward the hallway. “Yeah. Feels like a draft.”

I didn’t mention that I’d thought she saw something move there, just a small shape, low to the ground, like someone crouched too close to the floor. A trick of the lights, I told myself.

We spent the evening watching Christmas movies, but neither of us could fully relax. I kept feeling watched from the kitchen doorway. I didn’t see anything, never long enough to be sure, but every time I turned my head, I caught the tail end of motion, just slipping out of sight.

We went to bed early. The house felt too busy, even with just the two of us, it felt like someone, or something was always just out of sight. Just after midnight, I woke to the quietest, most deliberate creak. I lifted my head. Rowan was asleep beside me.

Another creak.

Closer this time.

Right outside their door.

My breath caught. I could feel something on the other side, crouched, waiting. I didn’t dare wake Rowan any movement felt like an invitation. Eventually the pressure faded and the sense of being watched slipped away. I eventually fell asleep to the sound of the wind, telling myself it had only been the house settling.

Morning came, I tried to shake it off.

We planned to wrap presents and we laughed about “new house paranoia.”

But on the floor outside the bedroom door, Rowan noticed something on the floor right outside the bedroom door, pine needles. A whole cluster of them.

We went downstairs and I immediately noticed it, the tree, which yesterday was tucked neatly into the corner, was now almost a foot or two away from the wall, leaving a big gap behind it. Well, we were very tired last night, it couldn’t have been anything else but simple misremembering. I hoped. I didn’t mention it.

We stayed up late, trying to act normal. We played music, made popcorn, talked about which ornaments to buy next year. But the house felt different, too still, too expectant.

Sometime around midnight, the lights flickered. Not the whole house just the strings in the living room and hallway. They dimmed and brightened in a slow pulse, like the house was breathing.

Rowan’s voice was tight. “Did you see that?”

I nodded. “Maybe old wiring.” Desperate to prove that our new house that we worked so hard for, didn’t turn out to be haunted

“Maybe,” Rowan said. But he was staring at the dark corner behind the tree, just to the right of where I was sat, just out of m peripheral “Jamie… do you feel like something is in here with us?”

I did. I had all evening, a prickling sense that someone was just behind my chair, leaning in close, so close they could see the pattern of my Pjs. Every time I turned, nothing was there. But the feeling snapped back the moment i looked away.

Around one in the morning, Rowan went to brush his teeth, but he didn’t come back.

I waited.

Five minutes.

Ten.

Finally, I got up.

“Rowan?” I called softly.

Movement answered.

Not Rowan’s voice just a quick shuffle, like feet … or hands scurrying across the tiles.

I stepped into the hallway. The lights were low, dimmed as though something pressed its weight against the wiring. The bathroom door was open. Inside, Rowan stood frozen at the sink, toothbrush in hand, eyes locked on the mirror. I followed his gaze.

There was nothing in the reflection behind Rowan… but the ceiling above the doorway looked wrong, just a shade darker than it should be, like something was pressed flat against it, clinging there, head angled down watching Rowan from above, trying to be out of sight, almost afraid of being seen.

I blinked. The dark patch dissolved, retreating fast into the corner where the light didn’t quite reach. Rowan whispered, “We need to leave.”

We packed nothing. Just grabbed coats and headed for the front door, but as we reached the living room, we stopped dead. The tree was no longer upright It was bent, almost bowed, its top angled down as if something heavy had been perched on it, pine needles, far too many to make sense, were scattered across the floor in a trail leading to the hallway.

I swallowed hard. “Go. Now.”

We moved fast. Rowan reached for the door but it opened before they touched it. We ran out the house, and didn’t stop running until we reached the car. Breathing rapid and shallow he reversed out, swerving and setting off down the road.

Rowan tore down the icy road, hands shaking, headlights slicing through the dark. I pressed a hand to her chest, trying to breathe.

“We’re almost out,” Rowan whispered. “We’re almost—”

A sudden chill swept through the car. Not from outside but from the back seat. I felt a gentle brush of cold air, like something had leaned close. Rowan noticed this and dared to look in the rear view mirror.

“Jamie, do not turn around”

My breath caught in my throat and I knew what It was before I saw it, it was the creature. it had followed them, I saw it clearly now, almost under a spotlight with each passing streetlight. It was curled up on their back seat, its head slowly looked up to make eye contact and I screamed. Rowan swerved in a panic, and the car skidded into a soft snowbank at the edge of the woods. The impact was mild, just enough to shake loose a dusting of snow from the branches overhead.

Me and Rowan were slightly dazed, but shared a quick glance with each other before turning our heads to see into the backseat. The creature wasn’t curled up now. It sat upright, its long, wooden limbs folded neatly. Pine needles drifted from its twig-like hair. Its dark eyes weren’t hungry… just ancient. Watching.

I gasped, but the creature didn’t move. We both winced and prepared for an attack of some sort, our hearts ripped out or even our heads removed. We just hoped it would be quick. With almost a minute past and we still had our heads, a small noise made us open our eyes. The creature lifted one hand and pointed out the window. I cautiously followed the gesture.

An old, half-rotted sign stood crooked in the snow

**GUARDIANS OF THE ROOTED HILL**

**HONOR THE WOOD**

**RESPECT THE TREE TAKEN**

Rowan whispered, “Guardians…?”

I froze, and then it hit me.

“The Christmas tree,” I murmured. “The one from the old farm estate…this is where we got it from, the old man said it was ‘from special land.’ We thought they meant organic.”

Rowan swallowed. “You think… it was cut from here?”

The creature blinked once, slowly, like a nod.

Then it pressed one twig-finger gently to its own chest and motioned to the land they had gotten the tree from. I felt my stomach twist. “It was part of them.” Not the creature itself, but its forest. Its family. Its home.

The creature blinked softly, and my eyes softened. Rowan’s grip on the wheel loosened, we had been running from something we never tried to understand. It never even tried to hurt us, or even scare us. In fact, it tried to do the opposite, tried to stay out of sight, it was us always looking for it in the corner of our eyes.

I turned fully toward the creature. “You followed us because the tree is a part of you?”

The creature nodded. Rowan’s voice cracked. “And now we are your guardians.” He said as a statement more than a question, the creature seemed to become less terrifying by the second. A warmth spread through the car not heat, but relief. The oppressive fear lifted, replaced with something calmer, older, rooted, I reached out a trembling hand.

The creature leaned forward and, very gently, touched my fingers with its wooden ones. Its touch was cold, but not frightening. A thank you. Or a greeting.

Rowan exhaled. “We took it without meaning harm. We didn’t know.”

The creature tilted its head, as if listening, and then pointed back down the snowy road toward their home. I smiled sympathetically. The creature’s eyes glowed faintly, like embers warming in the dark, and its face began to look more human. I saw movement in the back window and tried to focus my eyes. Figures emerged from the trees, dozens of them. Not menacing, just watching, curious, hopeful. Their shapes were gentle, like a stray kitten approaching a human for the first time. I looked at my husband and we smiled,

Rowan placed a hand on my knee.

“Let’s go home,” he whispered.

The creatures parted, forming a quiet path back toward the house. Guiding us, not forcing us, and we felt like we were part of something bigger, more important. As Guardians. I wondered how many of them were out there.

Me and Rowan stepped out into the snow, hands intertwined, the creature padding beside us like a silent guardian of its own. And for the first time, the night didn’t feel cold, all three of us, finally felt safe.
