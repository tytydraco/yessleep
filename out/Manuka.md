He answered our prayers during the dust bowl. Our town suffered as most did in Kansas. My parents moved out here when they found out I was on the way: caught up in the great wave of folks beckoned by the cheap land. My dad staked ours, set up a shack to live in, and cleared our families path. Not long after they found themselves a schedule: he would get up at 4am every morning, have coffee at the diner until 6, work in the fields for 12 hours, then rest. Mom did everything else. And that’s how life went on, not even tripped up when I was born. The dirty thirties; however, laid us flat.

It's known how the story of the dust bowl goes. Farmers over cultivated their lands with unhealthy practices, in the hopes they’d have enough product to compensate for the depression. Our town was no different, and in retaliation, fate dwindled our crops and gutted the yield. The plants were sad and sickly: dwarfen corn on brittle brown stalks, stingy soy and pinto beans. We seemed to harvest as much rotten produce as the salvageable stuff. The fowl piles grew in multiplicity and stature, too much at one time to prepare for composting.

We prayed every lull in time we came across. On days when dad had to come in from the field early: dust caked into every nook in his face, an involuntary moment of silence came over us. There was a storm that lasted for days, with an occasional forty-five minutes until the next wave would barrel towards us. The night that it ended, it was an hour after dusk when it just fizzled away. Its tirade evidenced by our half buried porch, orange film on our windows, a ramp over the neighbors cattle fence, and him. 

We were in the living room, a light, silent celebration of the break in the storm. That’s where we felt him. It was like taking a step with no stairs to catch our foot. At the drop of a pin something fell through us, a physical hollowing in our bodies, but also an emotional longing to fill that void. It beckoned us to look outside.

The crimson moon, bloodshot from the dust laced sky, permitted and reduced our witnessing of his only visit. The transit told of his appearance: the lighting, too inadequate to reveal greater details. What could be seen is his overzealous height. Emphasis given to the two visible, spindly appendages that made up three quarters of his body. He lumbered slowly towards us, the joints connecting the limps to the torso judged out drastically with every step: like popping an arm in and out of its socket. His torso dipped down between the limbs for a short distance before ending at an amputated stump. The core of the torso being vase shaped, bottled necking, then stretching into a thin plateau. If the plateau was a head, it laid flat like a crocodiles: structures branched out of either side, with a privity in sprawling upwards. The thick trunks closest to the body, wisping out into oblivion as its girth frittered. 

Moonlight shown through momentary vacancies in his body, blips of light that would flicker within his shadow, promptly filling back in. A hazy, hardly rendered web of flowing tendrils trailed off his center mass, riding along the thinning air. It could’ve been our bodies giving into our minds desire to watch, neglecting our increasing need for air, but it felt as though the room became a vacuum in his wake. The whistle of the late storm's wind as it channeled through the ill fitted wood: had long since died down, now non-existent. Nothing made a sound in his presence.

He stood between our furthest fields, among the numerous and now embarrassing rot piles. A shameful representation of our inadequacies, laid out beneath him. From behind him rose two appendages, two obscure sticks, manifesting into tangible structures once they swung over his body. Their additional height now doubled his, but just for a moment, before they collapsed: buckingly halfway up, the heavy top coming down fast. 

They didn’t meet the ground with a thud, instead a hydraulic, slow approach. Long thin rods hoisted up by beams no thicker, resting on either side of the neck. The ends met our filth piles, he began to draw them in. The limbs, like two chopsticks, squeezing towards each other. When they rose again, a wad of cultivated death was held in their grasp. It swung back over his body, and disappeared behind his shadow.

It’s as if the moon turned down the lights as he left, obscured to the point of his form being nothing more than an afterimage. As he dwindled away, the rest of the world returned, all except for the storms. We heard the wind, gentle and whispering, the crickets, then our breath. 

 Not a word was said that night, not out of bewilderment; it would’ve been unnecessary to do so. Words would be needed for someone who didn’t see him: we felt our explanation. Once the spell was lifted it felt like we had gained fifty-pounds; an intense exhaustion followed. Although I don’t imagine any of us slept; a part of us still watching from the window. We didn’t talk at breakfast either, our faces may have worn an expression commonplace in the 30s, but our eyes were coated with a photographic cataract, a picture of him. The first word spoken that day was from my father when his distant howler, and footsteps grew louder, puttering in the dustfall that still blanketed our land. Mom and I, cleaning the grime off our porch, looked up to see a traditionally silent and unenergetic man: waving, panting, and yelling about something in the field.

We took off in his direction, when we met him, his breathless gasps couldn’t carry any words, so he turned and ran back the way he came. When we made it to the scene, he hunched over his knees, spitting and coughing: the sounds of an aging man using his body in a way he hadn’t in years. His fit became an afterthought when we made sense of the display. Where a graveyard of rotten plants stood days before, no longer had a trace of the useless matter. In its spot were numerous perfectly bundled stacks of: corn, soybeans, and wheat. They were radiant, nearly a manufactured perfection: large ears, vibrant colors, a sweet aroma. All the piles were like this, and they would be for every day to come, as long as we left something in exchange.
