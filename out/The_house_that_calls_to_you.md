My little brother Danny disappeared ten days ago.

He’s thirteen. Still drinks chocolate milk with dinner. Still falls asleep during movies. That night, he said he was walking home from school.

He never made it back.

The police found nothing. Except that his phone pinged once—briefly—right in front of 41 Cypress Lane.

That house.

Crooked porch. Dead lawn. Always empty. Always wrong.

They wouldn’t go in. Said it was condemned.

So we waited.

Until last night, when Danny came back.

I found him on the front porch at 2:00 AM. Barefoot. Blank-eyed. Swaying slightly.

“I got lost,” he whispered. “Can I come in?”

He doesn’t eat. Doesn’t blink enough. Paces at night. Stares at mirrors like he’s listening to something on the other side.

When I ask where he went, he says, “I don’t remember.” But I’ve heard him talk in his sleep.

“She sings in the floorboards.”
“There’s too many stairs down there.”
“I can’t hear my name anymore.”

Last night, I followed him.

I knew he’d try to go back. Around 3:15 AM, he slipped out the front door again and started walking down Cypress Lane. I didn’t call out. I just followed—barefoot, heart pounding, trying not to think.

He walked right up to 41.

The front door was open.

The light inside was… wrong. Faint and yellow, like candlelight filtered through fog.

Danny stepped in without a pause.

I stood on the porch for a second. I told myself I was going in to bring him back. I stepped through.

And everything changed.

The house is not empty.

It isn’t even a house. Not really.

The inside stretches too far. The walls bend away when you reach for them. The wallpaper breathes. The floorboards sigh when you walk.

And the air smells like rot and something sweeter underneath.

I called Danny’s name. No answer. Only silence.

And then… a laugh.

High and soft. Childlike. Coming from upstairs.

I ran toward it.

The staircase twisted as I climbed, like I was walking in circles. There were too many steps.

At the top, I found a hallway that shouldn’t exist.

All the doors were open except one.

From inside, I heard my mother’s voice.

“It’s time for dinner, sweetheart.”

Then Danny’s voice:
“Okay, Mom.”

But my mother isn’t here.

I opened the door.

Inside was a perfectly normal room. Kitchen table. Warm light. Mom standing at the stove.

Danny sitting at the table. Smiling.

He looked up at me.

“You made it.”

I stepped back.

His smile didn’t change, but his eyes did.

They turned completely black.

Everything started flickering.

The room melted.

The walls pulsed and throbbed, bleeding shadow. The kitchen collapsed inward, and behind it—I saw them.

Other Dannys.

Hundreds of them. All identical. Standing still in rows in the dark, facing forward. All with that same black-eyed smile.

Behind them, something taller rose. Thin. Boneless. Its mouth a circle, stretched wide. Singing in a voice that sounded like my brother’s laugh warped through a drainpipe.

I ran.

I don’t know how long. The house shifted, floors turning into stairs, doors leading to brick walls, lights flickering with no source.

I kept running.

I think it let me.

I burst out the front door just as the sun cracked over the rooftops. My lungs burned. My feet were bleeding.

I didn’t stop until I reached my front yard.

Danny isn’t here anymore.

Not the thing that wore him.

There’s just silence. And my mom crying.

We filed a report again. The police said I must’ve had some kind of episode. Stress. Grief. Hallucinations.

But I know what I saw.

That wasn’t my brother.

Edit:
I went back today. Just to see.

The house is still there.

Empty. Dark. Windows blank.

But as I turned to leave, I glanced up.

Second-story window.

Danny was there.

Smiling.

He mouthed something I couldn’t hear—but I knew what he said.

“Come back.”

I won’t.

Because that thing isn’t him.

My brother is dead.

The house is just wearing him now.

And it’s still hungry.
