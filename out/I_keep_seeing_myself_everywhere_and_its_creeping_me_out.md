It started when I was out with my mates in the park. We were playing tennis and we decided to take a break. We scattered, some of us went to the water taps, some to the bathrooms, and some to the benches. I drank some water to cool down, adjusted my hat, and started walking back over to the court. I noticed my friend had already been sitting on the floor, just staring off into the distance. “Hey, Vin, you ready to get your ass beat again?” I yelled, with a wide grin across my face. As I walked closer, I noticed that he started looking less… Vin-like. I mean, when did he get that hat? Why does his hair look different? I squinted my eyes and jolted back when I realised. It wasn’t Vin who I was looking at, it was me. I saw myself sitting on that court. A chill ran down my spine, it didn’t make sense. “Sam!”, I heard, before swiftly turning my head, “Who are you talking to?” It was Vin— for real this time, and the rest of our mates. I slowly turned my head back towards the court to see that “I”, or the fake me, had disappeared. It was a strange sight, but I reckoned that the heat must’ve been getting to me. After all, it was a hot summer day. 

After that first encounter, nothing happened for a good couple of months. I almost forgot about it until Easter. We had a small gathering at my house arranged by my parents. For the kids, they hid a couple of chocolate eggs to keep them busy. I was helping my little brother dig up a few eggs until my shovel broke. Expected, considering that it was an old toy shovel, the kind that comes with those sandcastle buckets. I went to the garden shed to get a better shovel. I browsed the cobweb-filled shelves. There were hammers, wrenches, bags of soil, but not a single shovel in sight. I sighed and turned back. Just as I was about to close the shed door behind me, I saw it again. I saw myself with my brother. Same clothes, same haircut, same birthmark on the back of my neck. “I” was just sitting there, in the same place I was before, digging with the broken shovel. I stared in shock until I felt a bristle on my arm. I jumped at the sight of a spider crawling along my elbow, flinging it onto the floor. I looked back up, and to no surprise, “I” disappeared again. At this point, my brother was calling out to me so I had no choice but to brush it off and continue on with my day, but I barely got a wink of sleep that night.

Easter turned into Halloween, Halloween turned into Christmas. I thought it was finally over, until one night. I woke up in the middle of the night, desperately needing the bathroom. I got up and walked to the door. Something was telling me to just go back to bed, but I was practically about to burst. I quickly did my business and washed my hands before going back to my room. Everything was fine until my vision adjusted, something— no, someone was in my bed. I stood in the doorway, confused, until it hit me. My heart dropped when I spotted the familiar strands of hair and the blue plaid pyjamas. It was me, for the third time now. My hands shuffled towards the light switch as I began to lose my breath. When the light finally turned on, it was gone. My bed looked the exact way I left it when I got up, empty. Not a single pillow out of place. I started sleeping on the couch for the rest of that month and I stopped going to the bathroom during the night, I no longer felt safe otherwise.

From that day on, I lived in fear. I still couldn’t figure out if it was my imagination or not. I started dreaming about it and I would wake up drenched in sweat and tears. Some days I found myself in bed all day, afraid to even leave the room in fear of it coming back. On days that I’d actually go out, which was rare, the sight of someone who even remotely resembled me from the back would make me freeze. I longed for the feeling of security once again and for all of it to be over. Friends slowly stopped talking to me, mainly because I would always cancel our plans, my parents were worried, my grades were dropping. Soon enough, I started seeing myself everywhere. In my car, through the window of my classroom, at the dinner table, even in the shower while I brushed my teeth. It became so frequent that it was almost like a routine.

Today, I decided I would watch some TV to wind down. While I was watching, I got thirsty so I paused my show and got up to go and get a drink. I headed over to the kitchen and poured a glass of cola for myself. I slowly walked back to the lounge room, peeking over the corner hesitantly. To my surprise, it was empty. I let out a sigh of relief and sat down. I sipped my ice cold cola while I continued to watch my show and leaned back in my chair. About ten minutes later, I heard slow and cautious steps approaching from the kitchen. At first I thought it was my brother, but I remembered that I was home alone. Upon realising this, I was too scared to look back so I looked at the reflection on the TV instead, and there it was. Myself, standing behind me. But this time it was a bit different, he was actually turned towards me for once and I could see his face. He looked terrified and even dropped his glass of cola. He slowly looked back up and his expression turned into more of a confused look, as if I had just disappeared.
