My daughter, Casey, had been begging me for a pet for years. Ever since her best friend down the street had gotten a hamster at age five it had been almost a weekly discussion. Until now I was able to get away with the excuse of “when you're older”, but my little girl was eight and it was getting harder and harder to justify not getting her a pet. So, when she brought it up again recently I finally said yes. She screamed with delight, gave me the biggest hug, and I knew I had made the right decision. I just had no idea how much this decision would change our lives.

It took quite a bit of back and forth with her to decide on what *kind* of pet to get. Casey didn't want a hamster like her friend anymore. In her opinion, she was a big girl and ready for a better, more involved pet. Hamsters were, apparently, a little kid’s pet.

The two of us lived in a little two story condo and didn't have the yard for a dog. I was allergic to cats, so that was out. Fish were entirely too uninteresting as they couldn't be played with or cuddled. Any type of reptile wasn't cute enough, and Casey was afraid of birds after an unfortunate incident at our local zoo.

After lots of discussion we finally agreed that a rabbit was the perfect pet. Rabbits are small, cute, and, according to Google, can be litter trained. Perfect starter pet for my perfect little girl.

I immediately started looking at rabbit breeders in our area and by the weekend we were heading to the pet store for all the supplies needed for a happy, healthy rabbit. We got a cute little cage, pine shaving bedding, food and water dispensers, hay, and rabbit pellets. Then we were off to the breeder to pick up our new fuzzy family member.

Casey was beside herself with excitement by the time we pulled up to the breeder’s house. She chattered endlessly as the breeder took us to see the litter of rabbits he had available for purchase, rattling off rabbit facts and talking about all the fun memories she would make with her new pet rabbit.

The breeder’s rabbit hutch was attached to a large outdoor run that the eight or so rabbits meandered around in, happily foraging and grooming themselves. Casey squealed with excitement and rushed in to get a closer look, barely giving the breeder a chance to open the door fully before darting into the rabbit run. She fawned over the litter of rabbits, petting each one and trying to choose the best of the bunch. I tried to keep an eye on her but the breeder would not stop talking about rabbits and rabbit care.

"You know, these aren't the best for children."

"They can live up to 12 years, it's quite the commitment."

"You have to change their bedding every day."

“They need constant access to fresh food–hay and vegetables–not just pellets.”

I tried to assure him we had done our research, had a nice corner of our living room for the cage, and that everything would be fine, but he just kept going. On and on he talked until I finally tuned him out, focusing instead on how happy my daughter was amongst the rabbits.

The odd phrase still stuck out as I watched Casey. "...not just a pet…" yada yada, "...loyal servant…" blah blah, "...intelligent companion…".

"Daddy, I want this one!"

Casey broke through the droning and was pointing excitedly at one of the rabbits. It was fluffy, like all the others, with big brown splotches on its white fur.

"Alrighty, darling. If you're sure."

I paid the breeder far more than anyone should for a rabbit, but he insisted all of his rabbits were already litter trained and I was grateful to avoid any household accidents. He loaded the rabbit into a travel box and we set off for home, the box riding on Casey's lap in the front seat the entire way.

Patches became the little rabbit's name and Casey bonded with him immediately. She set up his cage with all the furnishings we had bought at the pet store and made sure he had plenty of food and water. Then she spent hours petting him, trying to hold him, and taking endless pictures on her phone to send to her friends.

Things were normal for about a week. Every day after school, Casey would burst in through the front door, run to Patches' cage, and let him out to play. He was adjusting to his new life in our home far better than I had hoped. There hadn’t been a single accident and Casey had even taught him a few tricks, something I didn't know you could do with rabbits.

"Dad, look at this! Patches, fetch!" The little rabbit dashed across the room to pick up the toy she had thrown.

"Good Patches!" She exclaimed when he returned it to her, and she gave him a little treat.

"Speak!" Patches let out a soft, sneezy ***chuff***.

"Good Patches!" She gave him another treat.

"That's amazing, darling!” I told her, marveling at how much she was able to train him in such a short amount of time. “What's that you're feeding him?"

"It's cheese," she replied casually, giving Patches scratches between his two long ears.

I thought for a moment. "Sweetheart, I'm not sure if cheese is good for rabbits."

"He really likes it! He wanted some of my string cheese the other day and has been asking for it ever since."

Her response puzzled me, but I figured a little cheese couldn't hurt and left the two of them to continue bonding while I started dinner.

The next odd thing happened when I came home for lunch the following day. I had just sat down at the dining room table with my sandwich when I heard a small noise from the living room. I paused and listened.

***Chuff.***

I went in to check on Patches and there he was, little front paws on the bars of the cage door in apparent supplication.

"Aw, you want out little buddy?"

***Chuff.***

Chuckling to myself, I opened the cage door. Patches leapt out nimbly and bounded for the dining room. I quickly followed and found him waiting expectantly at the foot of the chair I had been sitting in before being interrupted. Stepping carefully around the rabbit, I reclaimed my seat at the table and started on my lunch.

There was an impatient ***chuff*** from under the table. I looked down and Patches carefully and deliberately placed two fluffy paws on my leg, begging.

“I don’t think sandwiches are good for rabbits,” I replied.

Patches sneezed and shook his head.

One bite would be fine, I thought, and I lowered my sandwich to offer him a nibble.

In a flash, Patches snapped at the sandwich and wrenched the entire thing from my grip, quickly dragging it out of my reach. I watched in fascination as he devoured the entire thing in less than 30 seconds.

“Casey must not be feeding you enough,” I muttered doubtfully. I knew for a fact that she always gave him fresh hay, a bowl of produce, and kept his rabbit pellets topped off.

Patches licked his paws and cleaned his crumb covered face while I studied him. Now that I looked at him properly, he did seem a lot bigger than I remembered. When we bought him I thought the breeder had said his litter was full grown.

My watch beeped, breaking me from my thoughts, and I saw that my lunch was almost over. Carefully, I scooped Patches off the floor and carried him back to his cage. He was much stronger than I expected and squirmed wildly, letting out what almost sounded like a growl as I shut his cage door again. I was surprised at the outburst, he was usually so calm when Casey handled him.

I watched Patches more carefully after that. Every day he seemed to be a little bigger and I found myself digging through Casey’s phone for pictures of when we first brought him home. The little guy was definitely growing and *fast*.

Casey’s relationship with Patches was also growing. She started keeping him out of his cage any time she was home, even going as far as to sleep with him. It was quite a shock the first time I went to kiss her goodnight to find the rabbit, now as large as a medium sized dog, curled up beside her in bed.

I tried to make boundaries but she begged me not to, saying Patches “got mad” when left in his cage. Arguing with her got us nowhere and simply resulted in her crying so I almost dropped the matter entirely.

It all came to a head one night when I walked into the dining room to find Casey and Patches seated at the table, each enjoying their own bowls of ice cream.

“Casey, enough is enough! Patches is a rabbit; he doesn’t belong at the table and he definitely shouldn’t be eating ice cream!”

I grabbed Patches by the scruff and hauled him back to his cage in the living room. Casey wailed in protest and Patches hissed and snarled at me the entire way. Getting him back into the cage was a struggle as he was nearly too big for it now and he kicked the door of the cage repeatedly as I shut it behind him. I sent Casey to her room in tears, telling her we’d talk in the morning about the rabbit situation when we had all calmed down.

That night I woke up in a cold sweat. Groaning, I rolled over to check the clock, its display angrily reading out 3 am. It took me a few breaths to determine what had woken me, but it finally registered. There was a strange sound coming from downstairs. My mind immediately flashed to a possible home invasion and I quietly crept out of bed and grabbed the first weapon I could find, a wooden back scratcher.

The sound was practically constant, an odd, metallic groaning sound, and it grew louder as I carefully made my way down the stairs. I tracked it to the living room and snapped on the light, holding the back scratcher high as I prepared to swing.

The room was empty. I breathed a sigh of relief and looked around for the source of the sound. It didn’t take long to find it. In the corner of the room was Patches’ cage, now bowing outwards on all sides as the rabbit’s enormous body pressed against it. He must have tripled in size since I had put him in there a few hours ago and now the cheap, powder coated aluminum was struggling to keep his massive size contained.

The metal groaned again and there came a sharp snapping noise as a couple bars began to give way under the pressure. I watched in horror as Patches’ bulk pushed against the sides and more bars snapped, faster and faster, before the top of the cage finally ripped free.

Patches shook himself from the mangled debris. He rose to his hind legs, standing almost as tall as Casey now, and turned his head to one side to fix one bulging eye on me. A gurgling noise issued from his throat as spittle tumbled from behind his buck teeth and dripped to the floor.

I let out an involuntary gasp of terror as Patches took a lurching step forward. He reached a paw–now the size of a child’s hand–towards me, toes splayed and claws extended.

“Mmmmm…eeerrr…” The sound slid out of Patches’ mouth with another eruption of slobber.

I turned and bolted up the stairs, screaming for Casey. I burst into her bedroom, slamming and locking the door behind me, and ripped her out of bed. I was working on opening the window when the pounding and scratching began on the bedroom door, quickly followed by the sound of splintering wood. The door failed and Patches came squirming through the gap and into the bedroom.

“Stay back!” I screamed, placing myself between Patches and Casey, back scratcher raised above my head threateningly.

The nightmare that had once been a normal rabbit halted and stood before us on its hind legs, wobbling slightly as it seemed to struggle to keep its balance. It leaned to one side to get a better look at Casey.

“Caaaaaaa….C-caaaa…SSSSSEEEEEE,” the thing grunted, struggling with the syllables.

My jaw dropped in surprise and my grip on the back scratcher faltered.

Casey peeked out behind me. “P-patches?”

The creature turned its attention to me and took another, cautious step forward, ears dropping submissively. “M-maa…ssssssstterr?”

I was frozen in place, completely dumbstruck.

Casey weaseled her way out from behind me and carefully approached the thing standing before us, putting a hand out to it. It closed its eyes, leaned forward to meet her touch with its head, and nuzzled her hand. She glanced back at me and smiled.

“It’s still Patches.”

. . . . .

Things have changed a lot since that terrifying night. I now have two growing mouths to feed and have had to learn to alter clothing to fit a less than human form, but Patches has been learning more every day and his loyalty is unmatched. He is especially close with Casey and the two of them have become almost like siblings. They’re practically inseparable, constantly playing or doing their chores together, making blanket forts, or working on homework.

It’s been difficult of course, but life is about adapting. You have to be grateful for what you have because you never know what new changes will come your way. After all, isn’t that how the saying goes?
