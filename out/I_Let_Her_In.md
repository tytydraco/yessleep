Now:
I made the mistake of believing she was my mother.
She wasn't. 
Now I'm hiding in the attic hearing her screaming from below, her hurried footsteps reverberating through the house as she ran through the house searching for her prey.
I had no way to let anyone know I was safe. 
Well safe for now. 

I was sitting directly on top of the hatch to the attic hoping my weight would hold her off if she found me.
My heart was pounding and i felt sweaty and sick from dread.
The inhuman screeching made me shiver involuntarily and it seemed to come closer and closer to where i was.
I could hear thumps, smashing, and tearing sounds as my mother's double wreaked havoc and destruction.

Before:
 My mother was on business and called me to say her trip got cut short because her investment company made the deal earlier than expected.
It was plausible enough to not cause any suspicion and nothing in her voice made me suspect she wasn't my mother, there was no nuances or different inflection.
I cleaned the house and cooked a meal for her arrival and waited in anticipation for the knock at the door.

The loud thump should've been the first red flag that it wasn't my mother as her knocks were softer and more considered. 
But i just assumed she was impatient to be home but i even hesitated and peered through the key hole.  
 I saw my mother looking back through the hole smiling.
I flung open the door and instantly knew i made a horrible mistake. 

Mum's face instantly changed into something hard and cold.
Unfamiliar.
I recoiled in shock and dismay. 
This wasn't my mother. 
She was the carbon copy of her physically. 
But there was nothing else that made her my Mom. 
"Hello Grace", Mom said mechanically as if i was a passing acquaintance.
She pushed past me sharply enough to make me wince.
I saw the empty front doorstep and felt my stomach drop like a stone.
No luggage. 
The confirmation was enough to make me freeze in fear.

My mother slowly turned to stare at me.
But she was actually staring *right through me*.
A vicious smirk played about her lips as if she could sense i was terrified.
I had to act fast.
I needed to run as fast i could to somewhere safe. 
Almost as if she could read my mind my mother ran at lightening speed to the front door and slammed it shut with a loud howl that made me jump back in horror. 
Thinking fast i made to run to the back door with my mother fast on my heels and i quickly veered to the right up the stairs and ran as fast i could to my room. 
I locked the door just as my mother tried to open it and quickly pulled down the attic stairs and climbed up as fast as i could.
 I quickly pulled up the ladder and slammed the hatch door shut and laid on it, my body shaking with adrenaline.
I could hear my mother banging on my door as hard as she could to break it down but it was holding for now.

Now:  
I must've fallen asleep because i woke up to a sickening giggle coming from behind me. I jolted awake the hair on the back of my neck tingling   
I turned very slowly, my heart thumping so loud i felt faint. 
What i saw made me scream as loud as i could. 
In the little attic window was my mother hanging upside down staring at me.
Her head was completely twisted around and her yellow eyes and black teeth were glinting in the moonlight. 
I knew that i had to get back down the attic stairs and escape for my life because any minute now my mother would smash her way through the window. I could hear and see the glass splintering as she rapped her large talon like claws against the glass.
