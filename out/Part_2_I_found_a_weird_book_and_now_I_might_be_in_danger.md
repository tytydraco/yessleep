Alright. Last night, I ended up not taking my dog’s initiative and simply went to work. About an hour later, I was home, and Scout had been asleep, or at least, I assumed. She trotted from my room to greet me when I came in. I had left the living room light on, as I always did when I left for work late at night since I didn’t want to come home to darkness, but this time…I don’t know. The book commanding me—or to whomever it was directed—to keep some sort of light on stuck with me. Scout seemed fine. She was wagging her tail, and when I looked over to my roommate’s bedroom, the door was closed, and her light was on. She must’ve come home while I was at work.

A part of me was relieved.

I swapped my clothes for pajamas and got ready for bed. On my bedside table, I have this squishy unicorn light that changes colors. I turned it on before shutting the living room light off.

Even on my way back to my bedroom, I felt that eerie sensation of being watched… I kept the unicorn light on all night.

Thirty minutes after I shut my door and tucked myself into bed, I heard creaking of the floorboards, like someone was walking around. I tried to convince myself it was my roommate. She’s a night owl. But even that was no use. No lights turned on. My roommate wouldn’t walk around the house in the dark…

I wished that thought hadn’t crossed my mind. It made me nauseous.

I clenched my eyes shut, repeated “It’s nothing” like a mantra, and almost fell asleep until another creak, right outside my room, was too loud to ignore.

Scout started to growl and moved from under the comforter. Her eyes locked on the door, and I fought the urge to follow her gaze. I barely got any sleep. Every sound woke me up, and Scout was on high alert. At one point, she turned her attention to the window, and I had to just cover my head with the blanket to pretend she wasn’t doing what she was doing.

The immense weight off my shoulders when the sun finally rose was immeasurable; however, my body was strangely fatigued. It wasn’t terrible, but my limbs were sore, heavy, as if I had gone to the gym for hours the day before. I was light-headed, almost dizzy… I’ve missed many nights of sleep in my college days and from being immersed in video games, but I had never been this tired. My mental capacity from whatever was going on must’ve been at an all-time low. Thankfully, I had the day off from my full-time job and only had a few pet sits later in the afternoon. I tried to keep my mind off yesterday and spelled out the chores I wanted to get done.

This happened about forty minutes ago.

I decided to do laundry. The machines are in the basement. No big deal. There are plenty of lights, including one that hangs above the machines. 

I put in a load and made my way back upstairs. I flipped the light switch off, but as I turned around to shut the door, I glimpsed the foot of the staircase. There was a silhouette standing there.

I didn’t allow myself any time to take it in. A gasp caught in my throat, and I turned the light on faster than I registered what I was even seeing. When the light shone, the figure was gone, like it was never there.

A featureless human figure doused in black. A shadow distinct enough against the darkness to drown me in a cold stillness. I left the light on after that.

I sat on my couch, collecting my thoughts, still plagued with that intense exhaustion from a no-good night’s rest. That stupid book was in front of me, opened to page six—exactly where I had left it—but I was stupid enough to keep reading. Why, I can’t tell you. Morbid curiosity? The will to make myself believe it’s just a book and nothing more? 

Well, I don’t know whether this is a sick joke, an actual horror story someone wrote to mimic a child’s tale, or what…

*When it has caught you, praying won’t help.*

*You’ll never see the light of day again.*

I had so many questions.

What’s the “it” the book refers to? Why does it seem like it’s speaking to me? I’ve never read a story like this, but each page is formatted the same as the last. There are fifteen pages altogether.

*There’s nothing you can do to get away.*

*There’s nowhere to go that it won’t follow.*

__

*The shadow will remain in yours.*

*The closer it creeps, the weaker you’ll become.*

Scout barked then.

I looked over at her, and she was just staring at the basement door, peering through the gap between it and the floor.

I left the light on. I did. I swear to whatever higher being there might be that I left that damn light on.

If I was so sure of myself, why was it so hard for me to move from my seat? Why did I feel anchored to the couch, willing my dog to *just stop!*

But she didn’t. She growled and sniffed and whined. She even glanced at me as if urging me to check.

I stood and warily walked over. Scout’s head was on a swivel, going back and forth between me and the basement.

I left the light on. I did. I had nothing to worry about. Why was I so scared? There couldn’t be anything down there. It was just a basement. I was down there not long ago doing laundry, like any other day.

I turned the knob, a terrible, paralyzing shiver coursing through me, and opened the door.

The moment there was enough space to fit through, Scout darted through the threshold and down the steps.

If there’s one thing anyone should know about me, besides my extreme love for zombie fiction, it’s that I’d do anything for my dog, regardless of the circumstance.

I chased after her without so much as a second thought, despite fear nipping at my skin, though it was subdued once I realized I did, in fact, leave the light on.

I was in the main space that doubled as the garage.

Now, the light isn’t the brightest by any means, but it gets the job done, or so I thought anyway. Before any of this started.

I called for Scout, made kissing noises. All I could hear was the washing machine’s spin cycle. After another attempt at recalling my dog, she came running from the back room, tail tucked, ears flat. She ran right past me, up the stairs with no acknowledgement of me whatsoever.

The back room wasn’t used for anything. It was full of cobwebs, dust, and old kitchen appliances my landlord discarded there for “safe keeping.” It was also the only room in the basement whose light didn’t work.

I couldn’t see anything beyond the doorless entrance, but I felt like a child terrified of the monsters in the dark, monsters our parents insisted weren’t real—the ones in the closet, under our bed, in the corner of the room the glow from the night light couldn’t reach…

A few moments later, I let out a breath. Nothing was there. Monsters aren’t real.

I pivoted to make my way back to the staircase, only for three soft knocks to stop me in my tracks.

I looked over my shoulder, waited, bit my lip…

There were three more knocks, undeniably coming from the back room.

I didn’t wait a second longer. I ran upstairs faster than the warmth drained from my cheeks and slammed the door.

I’m currently sitting against that door, knees up to my chest, typing on my phone. Scout’s on the couch, hiding under a throw blanket. The knocking won’t stop. Sets of three with a pause between each, just like yesterday.

Monsters aren’t real. That stupid book is just getting to me. Like a horror movie that leaves you too afraid to go to the bathroom because the entire house is dark, the jump scares got you every time, and you’re convinced there’s a killer behind your shower curtain.

Monsters aren’t real. They aren’t.

Right?
