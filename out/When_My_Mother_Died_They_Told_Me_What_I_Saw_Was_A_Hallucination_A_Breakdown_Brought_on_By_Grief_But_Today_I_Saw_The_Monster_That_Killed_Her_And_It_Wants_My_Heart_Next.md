When I was fourteen, my mother was diagnosed with breast cancer. Terminal. Long hours working two jobs plus looking after me hadn’t granted her the time to look after herself. So, by the time it’d been caught. It was already too late.

She was the only person I really had. I never knew my father. I didn’t have that many friends. And what family I did have, while I had a decent relationship with them, they lived too far away for me to truly know them. So, the fact I was now losing my mom just about destroyed me. My grades fell from mostly As to being lucky getting a C. I pushed away what friends I did have, isolating myself in my nightmare. I lost all passion for drawing, for playing games, for everything. But I think the worst part about all of that was… I didn’t care. I couldn’t find the will to give a shit that I was losing everything. I was just numb.

My final day with my mother was miserable for more reasons than one. The night before I had a terrible nightmare, though when I woke, I couldn’t remember much about it. All I could recall was the end. The image of a shadowy figure with burning eyes standing above my mother as she laid in her hospital bed. The figure looked at me and I was suddenly surrounded by a deafening deluge of ravens’ cries that seemed to burrow into my skull, wrenching me from the darkness of sleep covered in sweat and with my heart hammering in my chest. It wasn’t the first time I’d had that nightmare, in fact, I usually had it every other time I slept in the hospital room with her.

It didn’t even have the decency to rain. Just clear skies and beaming sun. Like my world wasn’t crumbling apart around me. Like reality wasn’t collapsing in on itself.

It was a Saturday. I sat at her bedside all morning watching as the white lilies on the nightstand wilted, despite her encouragements to go out and see the friends I hadn’t spoken to for almost a month. But I couldn’t leave her. She struggled to stay awake for long periods so I wanted to steal back as much time with her as I could.

She was so weak by that point. Skinny. Frail. Her hair was gone and her skin was pale. She looked like she was already dead.

I only left once to go to the vending machine and get us both some snacks. She didn’t have the energy to eat much, but chocolate was one of the only pleasures she had left.

As I rummaged through the pockets of my jeans for change, I felt an icy wind wash over my back. Brushing away the hair that’d blown into my face, I looked over my shoulder, thinking it odd to feel such a strong breeze while indoors. A surprised squeak escaped me when I met the shadowy eyes of an old woman standing directly behind me.

“Oh, I’m sorry dear. I didn’t mean to startle you” she chuckled, her voice deep and raspy as if her throat was painfully dry. She was shorter than me, her skin sagging from old age, her curly hair was a blended mix of dark gray and black. She wore a long baggy raincoat that draped from her shoulders like a tarp. But it was her eyes that had me swallowing with nervousness. They were sunken, with dark shadows around them. Her irises were so dark I struggled to pick out the pupils. But the twitchy way she analyzed me when she cocked her head, the way her gaze flicked up and down my body, her lips spreading in a crooked toothy grin. There was just something about it that made muscles constrict.

I took a breath, my hand hovering over my thumping heart. “It’s okay. I think I’m just a little on edge today” I replied as I turned back to the vending machine, struggling to inject any lightness into my voice.

The woman remained behind me, presumably waiting in line for the same machine, the hairs on the back of my neck standing and hand trembling a little as I pushed coins into the slot. I didn’t know why I was so freaked out. It wasn’t from the old woman, no matter how odd I found her. It had been from the moment I woke up. Something dark pecking at my mind. Like a bird picking at carrion.

“Are you a patient here?” the old woman asked, pulling my attention back to her and almost making me jump again.

“Oh, no” I answered breathlessly. “My mother is.”

“Cancer?” she pressed, tilting the corners of her mouth downwards in a pastiche of sympathy. I nodded and she tutted her tongue. “And look at you. Being such a brave young lady” she said, gently brushing the backs of her fingers against my chin. Her skin was cold enough to make me shiver. “But don’t worry sweetie. You don’t have to be brave for much longer.”

I frowned at that, the saccharine way the sound slipped from her dark tongue making my skin prickle. The words settled into me and my eyes started to burn with their implication, my throat closing up as I turned back to the vending machine, wanting to get away from her as quickly as I could.

I grabbed my chips and chocolate and stepped away. “It’s all y-” I began, but when I turned to her, she was gone.

Returning to my mother’s room, I found the doctor at her bed speaking with her. I responded to his greeting with a polite nod and curled up on the chair in the corner, out of the way, pulling on my headphones so I didn’t have to hear whatever it was they were discussing. It’s hard to keep denial reinforced while listening to dispassionate truth, and the words of the old lady were still scratching at my insides causing the heat of my anxiety to put my blood on simmer.

I wanted to make my mother smile, since I couldn’t remember the last time I’d seen it. While the doctor spoke with her, I got out the pad I hadn’t touched in a long time and began to draw. I wanted to create something happy, but I struggled to find enough of the emotion to channel through my pencil.

As I tried to remember what it was like to be cheerful, I began to hear something outside the room, through the music blasting in my ears. A deep swooshing sound, like the noise of a bird’s wings. I pulled one side of my headphones off and listened. It was hard to discern at first with all the general noise of the hospital. But as I heard it again and again, growing steadily louder, I noticed it.

With each swoosh a rippling chill rolled through my veins. Each terrible beat slicing through every other sound around me demanding my attention, until something else stole it away.

“Constance?” My mother’s name. The doctor’s voice. The concern painting the syllables making my heart sink.

My gaze snapped to my mother as she lay in her bed, her eyelids fluttering meekly as she tried to speak, the words unable to find the strength to leave her lips. With the clinical stoicism I’d come to despise, the doctor marched to the doorway and called in some nurses. They rushed to my mother and began working on her, speaking too quickly for me to understand.

After rising from my seat, I took a few steps forward, my clenched jaw making my pulse throb in my temples. I had to remoisten my mouth, but before I could ask what was happening, a shadow passed over the doorway.

I looked as a large black beak emerged from the doorway’s right corner, the sterile fluorescent light limning the caked dirt and jagged cracks that bedecked the keratin surface. As it dipped downwards, a marble size red eye looking like magma peeked inside. I choked on my question as my breath caught in my throat. I stumbled backwards, my lips moving and eyes searing as the creature’s head craned further into the room, the feathers atop its skull grazing the top of the doorframe. A loud scraping noise sounded as it hoisted a leg into view, the long-curved talons of its scaly avian foot dragging along the floor. Its chest was that of a woman’s with gray wrinkled dead skin, its breasts and stomach sagging low. A shroud of jet-black feathers covered its shoulders and neck, cascading down its back and ending in a large pluming tail behind it. It brought its skeletal arm inside, half wing with an array of feathers lining the limb to the elbow, half hand with a set of sharp claws that braced against the doorframe. Its head twitched as it surveyed the room, clicking its beak before letting out a sharp raspy corvidesque caw.

The pressure building in my chest finally burst and a scream tore from my throat. My outburst surprised the doctor and nurses who looked at me as I fell backwards into the soft pillowed chair I’d been sat in before, pointing at the monster, unable to put my terror into words.

The doctor and nurses looked to the doorway but had no reaction. One smoldering ruby eye snapped to me as the creature cocked its head, analyzing me curiously for a few moments, its stare piercing through me to the deepest parts of my soul.

One nurse moved towards me, kneeling down and taking hold of my arm attempting to comfort me. I wrenched myself from her grip, scrambling backwards into the corner. “No! Get away! Get it away!” I screamed, still pointing at the monster, but when the nurse looked, again, she didn’t react, returning her gaze to me with confusion on her face.

The monster stepped fully into the room, snapping its beak and scraping its claws, its stature so tall it had to crouch to get through the door, the plume of feathers on its hunchback flicking out as it rose almost to its full height.

The doctor calmly muttered something to the second nurse who then hurried towards the monster. I tried to scream not to go near it, but before I could make my yells into words, the nurse reached the monster, passing straight through it like it was made of air.

I screamed louder, curling into a ball, my vision completely blurred by the tears in my eyes. The nurse beside me tried to grab me again, her voice drowning in the sound of my own fear. The monster moved farther into the room, each rattling thump of its talons and foot hitting the ground making my heart jump in my chest. But then I realized it was approaching my mother as she laid helpless in her bed, her eyes closed and breath labored as the doctor hovered over her.

“NO!” I cried out as I attempted to rush forward, but the nurse beside me grabbed me. I tried to push her off, I tried to get to my mother. I didn’t know what I was going to do, how I would defend her, I just needed to try. I couldn’t just let it take her.

But the nurse was stronger than me, pulling me back. Before I knew it, the other nurse, along with two others came rushing into the room, one moving to aid the doctor with my mother and the other two helping restrain me. I screamed and screamed until I could feel the strain of my vocal cords almost tearing, the monster traipsing closer to my mother’s bed.

I began to kick and fight with the nurses, scrambling inch by inch to get closer to my mother’s bed, to do something other than watch helplessly. “Don’t let it get her!” I yelled at the nurses. “Please! Please don’t let it-”

Eventually, the doctor, after looking back and seeing the state I was in, left my mother’s side to approach me. He crouched down and began to plead with me to calm down, plead with me to let him do his job, whispering that it was okay, things would be okay. But I couldn’t hear the lies. My attention, no matter how much I desperately didn’t want to see, couldn’t be pulled from the monster as it loomed over my mother, its head twitching and beak snapping.

With the nurses restraining me, my face coated with tears and snot, all I could do was watch and beg. “Please… please no…”

The monster reared its head up, its feathers fluttering as its muscles rippled, before plunging its beak through my mother’s chest.

“NO!” I cried out again as the heart monitor went silent, the gasp of my mother’s final breath somehow clear to me through the cacophony of noise. The monster ripped its head back, holding my mother’s heart in the tip of its beak. I expected blood, but saw none. No wound was visible on my mother’s chest, as if she had never been touched, as if she’d simply slipped away instead of being brutalized.

The doctor looked back, cursing under his breath before rushing to my mother again to help the nurse trying in vain to save her.

My body fell limp in the restraining hold of the other nurses, futile pleas dripping from my lips. I watched as the monster jerked its head back to throw my mother’s heart down its gullet, its beak clacking as it snapped shut, a sickening finality in the note of the sound.

"No... no... no.... please no... please..." I just laid my head on the ground, sobbing as the doctor and nurse worked on my now lifeless mother. “It killed her” I whimpered. “It killed her…”

The monster, its movements slow but jittery, moved backwards toward the door. Before leaving, it turned to observe me one last time. There was something in its red soulless eyes. Curiosity? Confusion? Worry? I’m not sure.

Then it walked out, past the doctors, past the nurses, past other patients. It just left, with my mother’s heart. No one saying a word, no one seeing it, no one doing anything. The loud swooshing sound of its wings, a sound I still hear in the darkness while trying to sleep, echoing down the sterile halls, growing quieter and quieter until it finally disappeared.

It’s been a decade since that day. And I know now that it wasn’t real. The monster isn’t real.

It took years to truly realize that. Years of drugs in little white bottles. Years of therapy in cold emotionless rooms. Years of living as an inpatient in a place that was not my home. But I understand it now. It was all in my head. Part of a breakdown that’d been building since finding out my mother was going to die. Some hallucination brought on by the grief and denial. I know that now.

Today I saw my own doctor, heard those same words my mother must’ve heard when I was fourteen. Luckily, I’ve caught it much earlier than she did, and my chances are much better, but with the diagnosis the hollow feeling came rushing back, the dread came rushing back.

I barely remember what else was said, what treatment plan the doctor had concocted. I was a ghost until I reached the bus stop again. Until the old woman pulled me from the depths of my thoughts.

“Excuse me dear?” It took a moment for the words to break through the ringing in my ears, my empty gaze turning to the old lady that had sat down beside me, her large raincoat crinkling as she leaned towards me. “Are you okay? You seem… down.” A veil of concern filled her dark irises, the wrinkles embedded in her sagging skin growing deeper as her lips quirked.

A long sigh flowed from my nostrils, my head resting back on the cold glass of the bus stop. “I just got some bad news” I murmured, visions of my mother’s frail bedridden body flitting through my mind. “I might die.”

The old woman’s face pinched with condolence. “Oh dear. That’s terrible. I’m sorry to hear that.”

I shrugged.

Silence echoed around us for a while, the old lady fidgeting with the collection of flowers in her withered hands. A bouquet of white lilies.

“Those are some beautiful flowers” I remarked, jutting my chin in lieu of pointing. “Are they for somebody?”

Dark dimples appeared in the woman’s cheeks as she smiled. “Oh, yes. I am seeing an old friend” she answered.

Silence reclaimed us and I sank back into my thoughts, trying to figure out how I would break the news to the people in my life.

“If it’s any consolation, dear.” The old woman’s voice tugged me back to the present. “Death is not something that should be feared. Perhaps it is a blessing. A chance for you to serve a greater purpose, placing your heart in the right place.”

My brows furrowed and I turned to her. “What?”

But she was gone.

I returned home and began the systematic process of calling the people in my life to tell them the news. The support I received from my partner and friends, the lovely things they told me and the encouragement I almost drowned in, the doctor’s statement of my chances being good found ground to settle. And I began to feel quite optimistic in spite of things.

Then, while preparing for bed, I glanced out the window, and there it was. Standing across the street, illuminated in the sickly orange glow of the streetlamp, watching me with its beady burning red eyes.

It was exactly how I remembered it. Standing tall, a cloak of feathers as dark as the night sky over its shoulders and humpback. A long thick cracked beak protruding from its face. Talons on its scaled feet that dug into the concrete of the sidewalk.

It’s real. The Raven Mocker has come back. And I don’t know how to stop it.
