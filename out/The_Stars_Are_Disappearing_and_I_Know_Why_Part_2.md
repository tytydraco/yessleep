I bolted upright in my chair, feeling as if the room was closing in around me, and swallowed hard. My eyes remained fixed on the single word glowing on the monitor.

*HELLO.*

It was impossible. There was no way it could have sent that message. I must have been hallucinating — sleep-deprived and jittery after days without rest. But as I stared at the screen, my fingers hung over the keyboard, trembling.

“Hello?” I whispered. I typed the word into the command line and hit ‘Enter,’ then waited.

For a long, agonizing moment, nothing happened. The screen remained blank except for the word that shouldn’t have been there. Then, slowly, letter by letter, a new message appeared beneath it.

*WHY DO YOU WATCH?*

A shiver ran down my spine. My hand jerked back from the keyboard as if it were a viper. I glanced around the empty room, half-expecting to see something lurking in the shadows. But it was just me, the quiet hum of the computers, and the distant rumble of the observatory’s ventilation system.

It was trying to communicate.

My pulse pounded in my ears. Every rational part of me screamed to shut it down, to sever the connection and destroy every piece of data we had gathered. This was beyond science — it was *madness*. Yet, somewhere deep inside, curiosity burned brighter than fear.

Because I didn’t just want to know *what* it was.

I wanted to know *why*.

“What are you doing here?” I typed hesitantly, the keys clacking loud in the silence.

The response came faster this time, the letters appearing almost instantly.

*FEEDING.*

The words sent a chill through me, but I forced myself to continue. “Feeding on stars?”

*YES.*

“Why?”

*TO LIVE. TO GROW.*

The simplicity of its answer unsettled me. There was no malice, no grand cosmic agenda. Just the cold, indifferent instinct of a voracious predator. But something about the way it responded… it was almost conversational, as if it wanted me to understand. As if it craved interaction.

“Are you alive?” I asked, my hands sweating.

The reply was immediate.

*NOT AS YOU UNDERSTAND IT.*

My mind reeled. I leaned forward, incredulous. What was I dealing with? A creature? An intelligence? Something that existed outside the boundaries of life as we knew it? I swallowed hard, glancing at the data feeds on the other screens.

“Why did you reach out to us?”

This time, the pause stretched on for several seconds. When it answered, the response was chillingly simple.

*I AM HUNGRY.*

I stared at the screen. *Hungry*. I had already known that it was feeding on the star, but what if that wasn’t the whole story? What if the star was just… a means to an end? A lure, a way to attract attention?

“What do you want?” I typed slowly.

The response made my blood run cold.

*TO BE SEEN.*

My mind raced, piecing together the implications. *To be seen*. It wasn’t just feeding on the star. It was broadcasting. It *wanted* to be observed. And I had fallen right into its trap. My obsession, my relentless need to understand… I had given it exactly what it wanted.

I was its prey.

I shoved back from the desk, gasping. I had to stop. I had to cut the connection, destroy every trace of this nightmare, before it—

The monitor flickered, and a new message appeared, freezing me in place.

*IT IS TOO LATE.*

I felt the blood drain from my face. Too late? What did it mean? Had I already triggered something, set some chain of events in motion that couldn’t be undone? My thoughts were spiraling, panic clawing at my chest. I scrambled to shut down the systems, but the keyboard was unresponsive, the screens locked on that single, damning phrase.

Then, in one heart-stopping moment, all the monitors blinked off, plunging the room into darkness.

I spun around. The entire observatory was silent. The computers were dead, the data feeds blank. I fumbled for the power switch, but it wouldn’t turn on. The backup generators didn’t kick in. Every system was down — as if the entire network had been… *consumed*.

“No, no, no!” I muttered, slamming my hand against the desk. This couldn’t be happening. I had to get the data back, I had to—

A low hum filled the room, vibrating through the walls. I froze. It was the signal — the same rhythmic pulse we’d picked up from the Feeder. Only now it wasn’t coming through the telescope.

It was coming from inside the observatory.

The floor trembled beneath my feet, the sound growing louder, deeper. I stumbled toward the door, my legs shaking. I needed to get out — to warn the others — but as I reached the exit, the hum stopped.

Silence fell.

I stood there, waiting for something — *anything* — to happen. The seconds stretched on, each one more agonizing than the last. Then, slowly, the monitors flickered back to life.

But they weren’t showing data anymore.

They were showing stars.

My blood ran cold as I stared at the screens. A field of stars, glittering brightly against the backdrop of deep space. And there, at the center of the image, was a cluster of stars formerly neighboring HD 1284, tiny pinpricks of light suspended in an inky void.

But something was wrong. The lights were flickering, as if something was distorting them— something between us and the stars. I squinted, leaning closer, and then I saw it.

A shadow, vast and serpentine, obstructing the faint glow of the distant suns.

And it was moving.

“Oh, God,” I cried. It was impossible — it was just light-years away. There was no way it could have traversed such a vast expanse so quickly. But there it was, twisting and writhing, its form swelling and swelling until it blotted out the entire screen. It felt as if the darkness itself were reaching for me, extending its tendrils through the monitors, through the cables and wires, right into—

*My mind*.

The darkness seemed to *pulse*, a ripple of shadow that echoed through my skull. This wasn’t real — it *couldn’t* be real. I was looking at a screen, and yet… I *felt* it. Inside me, smothering my very consciousness. It was like a dream, a half-formed nightmare, but sharper. More vivid.

And then, suddenly, I was falling.

The observatory seemed to blur, the walls warping and shifting. I gasped, clutching the desk, but it was like trying to grasp smoke. The floor beneath me buckled, and I stumbled forward, the darkness swallowing everything.

*No, no, no*, I cried.

The Feeder’s shadow engulfed me, enveloping my thoughts, squeezing tighter. Sharp, searing pain lanced through me. I screamed, the sound swallowed by the void.

*YOU LOOKED.*

The words penetrated my skull, soft and mocking, no longer confined to a screen. The Feeder wasn’t here — not physically. Not yet, at least–it didn’t need to be. It was in my head, projecting itself through the signal, hijacking my inner monologue. I was trapped, lost in the dark, a prisoner in my own mind.

*NOW I FEED.*

The pain erupted, a white-hot flash that tore through my central nervous system. I thrashed in protest, but the darkness pressed tighter, suffocating. It was tearing me apart, unraveling my sanity, my identity.

And then, abruptly, it released me.

I collapsed to the floor, my head spinning. Slowly the darkness receded, the world blurring back into focus. I peered at the nearby screens; they were still blank.

But the hunger remained.

I was back in the observatory — the real, physical observatory — but my body and mind felt wrong, *violated*. As if the boundaries between what was real and what was imagined had begun to fray.

Somewhere in the core of my being, a nagging, incessant sensation persisted. My thoughts were jumbled, fragmented. The Feeder had been inside me–that I was sure of–but it had done more than just explore. It had *tasted* me.

And it wasn’t finished yet.

Before I had a chance to so much as consider the implications, I was interrupted.

“Timothy?” a voice whispered.

I looked up, blinking through the haze of pain. Sarah was standing in the doorway, her face ashen and haggard. Cautiously, she took a step forward, her eyes first darting to the screens, then to me, and back again. I saw her lips move, but the words were muffled, as if I were hearing them through a layer of thick glass.

“What… what happened?” she asked.

“I—” My voice was hoarse, barely more than a rasp. I struggled to my feet, clutching the edge of the desk for support. “It’s… it’s inside the signal. It— It found a way to—” I broke off, shaking my head violently. None of it made sense. How could I explain what I’d just experienced? How could I make her understand that I wasn’t going insane, that the entity wasn’t just something out there in the depths of space?

It was *here*. And it was feeding on *us* now, using the same signal I had obsessed over for days.

“We have to shut it down,” I said finally, my voice trembling. “All of it. The observatory, the servers — *everything*. It’s using the equipment as a gateway. We’re making it stronger.”

Sarah’s face tightened, a flicker of anger sparking in her eyes. “You did this,” she whispered, taking a step back. “You kept pushing, kept digging. I told you to stop, but you wouldn’t listen. And now…”

“I’m sorry,” I choked out. “Please, Sarah, I— I didn’t know.”

But even as I spoke, I realized that wasn’t entirely true. I *had* known. On some level, I had *wanted* this — wanted to make contact, to pierce the veil between observer and observed. I had ignored the warnings and dismissed the fear, because the hunger for knowledge had been stronger.

And now we were paying the price.

“We have to go,” I insisted, pushing past the pain and the lingering sensation of the Feeder’s presence in my mind. “We have to get out of here, before—”

A loud crack echoed through the observatory, cutting me off. The floor shuddered, the walls vibrating. I stood, paralyzed, as the monitors flickered back to life. The same image appeared on every screen: the former location of HD 1284, now engulfed by the vast, coiling darkness of the Feeder.

But the entity’s form was different now.

Its shape was warping, rippling like a mirage. Tendrils of shadow stretched outward, twisting and curling in impossible patterns. It wasn’t just reacting to the telescope’s gaze anymore. It was… mirroring something.

Mirroring *me*.

“What the hell is it doing?!” Sarah cried, taking another step back.

“I don’t know,” I whispered, staring in horrified fascination as the entity continued to shift and writhe. It was mimicking my movements, echoing every twitch of my hands, every shift of my weight. And then, as I watched, it began to solidify, coalescing into a darker, denser shape.

A *humanoid* shape.

“Oh God,” I blurted out, stumbling backward. It couldn’t be real — it was just an image on a screen, a trick of light and shadow. But as I stared, I felt the presence in my mind pulse, a sharp, invasive pressure that made my skull throb. It wasn’t just copying me. It was trying to *become* me.

“What *are* you?” I whispered, not even sure who I was speaking to — the Feeder, the shadow on the screen, or the echo of its voice still whispering in the corners of my mind.

The response came–a soft, mocking murmur that seemed to vibrate through the air itself.

*YOU KNOW.*

I recoiled. It wasn’t a voice, not really — more like an impression, a sense of meaning that bypassed language entirely. And in that moment, I understood.

The Feeder wasn’t just a predator. It consumed not just matter and energy, but the very essence of those it encountered. It had fed on innumerable stars, countless worlds, and now it was feeding on me. Using the signal as a conduit, it was attempting to mimic, overwrite, and replace me, the same way it had consumed the light and mass of HD 1284.

And if it succeeded, it wouldn’t stop with me.

“What—what does it want?” Sarah asked, her voice thin and strained. “What is it doing?”

“It’s trying to come through,” I whispered. “It’s— It’s using the signal, the telescope— It’s—”

The words died in my throat as the image on the screen moved. The shadowy form of the Feeder twisted— and then, impossibly, one of its tendrils pressed against the inside of the monitor’s glass.

“No,” I cried, taking a step back. “No, it can’t—”

The glass began to bulge, the surface warping outward as if something were pressing against it from the other side. A faint crack appeared at the edge of the monitor, spreading in a jagged line across the screen. I stumbled backward, shaking my head violently.

“It’s not real!” I whispered frantically. “It’s just a projection! Just a—”

The glass shattered.

I screamed, the sound swallowed by the deafening roar of static that filled the room. Darkness erupted from the broken monitor, a writhing mass of shadow and smoke. It swirled around me, cold and suffocating, coiling around my arms, legs, and throat.

*LET ME IN.*

The voice was everywhere, a desperate, ravenous whisper that clawed at my mind. I thrashed wildly, but it was like being smothered in frigid ash. Tighter still it pressed, the pressure building in my skull—

And then, suddenly, it *stopped*.

I blinked, gasping, and realized I was on the floor again, the monitors dark and lifeless. The broken glass had vanished without a trace. The darkness was gone.

Beside me, Sarah stared, wide-eyed, a look of pure horror on her face.

“Timothy,” she whispered, her voice shaking. “What… what just happened?”

I looked down at my hands — at the faint, dark tendrils that still lingered around my fingertips, fading like wisps of smoke.

The Feeder hadn’t broken through.

But it had left a part of itself inside me.

“I—” I began, but the words caught in my throat. What could I even say? It all seemed futile, pointless.

Across from me, the monitors lit up once more. I cast a glance at them, and nearly choked.

The distant stars were still blinking out. All of them, one by one, with increasing rapidity.

And I knew, with a sickening certainty, that it wasn’t just the Feeder anymore. There were *others*. Untold others, drifting through the void, drawn to the beacon I had unwittingly activated.

They were coming.

And they were all hungry.

**Part V**

The observatory was silent except for the hum, that deep, rhythmic vibration that pulsed in the walls, the floor, my chest. It wasn’t merely mechanical; it was *alive*. Like the heartbeat of a vast, unknowable predator, it thrummed with a life all its own.

I stood frozen, staring at the monitors, at Sarah’s wide, terrified eyes, and at the void where the stars had been. My mind churned with anxiety. We had to do something — but every instinct told me that it was already too late. The Feeder itself had told me as much. What position was I in to question something so vast and powerful?

“Timothy,” Sarah whispered, clutching my arm. Her voice was trembling, her nails digging into my skin. “They’re coming, aren’t they?”

“No,” I said, my voice hollow. “They’re already here.” I didn’t need to look back at the screens to know it. The Feeder and its kind had crossed whatever incomprehensible distance separated us, drawn by the signal I had foolishly amplified. I had lured them, beckoned them with my obsession, and now we were being hunted.

My thoughts spiraled. Every possible action felt useless. They weren’t creatures that could be fought or reasoned with. They weren’t even bound by the same rules of existence. They were a heartless, calculating force of nature.

And yet, some desperate part of me refused to give in.

“We have to sever the signal,” I said suddenly, turning toward the central console. My voice was sharp now, a forced steadiness cutting through the rising panic. “If we can break the connection, maybe—”

“Maybe *what*?!” Sarah snapped, her fear giving way to anger. “Maybe they’ll leave? Maybe they’ll just forget about us? You don’t even know if that’s possible!”

“No, I don’t,” I admitted, meeting her gaze. “But I have to try. You saw what they did to the star. If they make it here—” I swallowed hard. “It’s not just us, Sarah. It’s *everyone*. *Everything*.”

She hesitated, her anger fading as the weight of my words sank in. Then, reluctantly, she nodded.

We worked quickly, moving through the observatory with an urgency that bordered on hysteria. Every monitor showed the same terrible image: the void, vast and all-consuming, coiling and writhing as the Feeder’s shadow spread. It was no longer just one entity; faint outlines in the darkness hinted at others, distant but closing in.

The hum grew louder as we shut down systems one by one, each click of a switch a small victory against the mounting dread. But the deeper we went, the more the Feeder pushed back. The monitors flickered and flared, the images distorting into grotesque shapes that seemed to writhe and twist in mockery of human forms. The hum became a roar, vibrating through my skull, and I felt the presence in my mind again.

*YOU CANNOT HIDE.*

The words weren’t spoken; they were *felt*, a resonant force pulsing through my being. I staggered, clutching the console for support, my vision swimming. Sarah shouted something, but her voice was drowned out by the roar. The darkness on the monitors swelled, the tendrils approaching the edges of the screens, and I realized with dawning horror that it wasn’t just an image.

It was *here*.

“Timothy!” Sarah’s voice cut through the din, sharp and panicked. “We’ve lost control of the main system. The signal’s still broadcasting!”

“No!” I gasped, stumbling toward the central terminal. My hands shook as I typed, but the commands were ignored. The console’s lights flickered wildly, the hum growing deeper, louder. The Feeder was in the system, entwined with the signal itself, and no matter how many systems we shut down, the connection remained.

“Timothy, we have to leave!” Sarah grabbed my arm, trying to pull me away, but I shook her off.

“There’s one more thing we can try!” I said, my voice a desperate rasp. “The antenna array. If we can destroy the transmitter—”

“Destroy it?” she interrupted, her eyes wide. “You can’t be serious. That’s millions of dollars in—”

“Sarah, listen to me!” I shouted, rounding on her. “It doesn’t matter anymore! If we don’t stop the signal, they’ll keep coming. You’ve seen what they are, what they do! Do you think money means anything to them?”

She hesitated, her expression torn between fear and determination. Then, finally, she nodded.

The wind howled as we stepped out onto the observatory’s rooftop, the cold biting through my jacket. Above us, the sky was black — not the soft, star-dappled black of a normal night, but an impenetrable void. The stars were gone, eclipsed by the approaching shadows. I couldn’t see them, but I could *feel* them.

The antenna tower loomed ahead, its skeletal frame silhouetted against the darkness. It was the heart of the observatory’s transmission system, the link between Earth and the cosmos. If we could destroy it, we might sever the signal. It was a long shot, but it was all we had.

“Hurry!” Sarah urged, her voice tight. She was carrying the toolbox we’d grabbed on our way up, her hands trembling as she fumbled for the cutters. “We don’t have much time.”

I didn’t respond. My focus was on the antenna, on the cables that snaked down its length. Each one was a lifeline to the telescope, a thread that needed to be cut. I reached for the first cable, but my hands were shaking so badly that I could barely grip it.

“Let me,” Sarah said, stepping in. She worked quickly, cutting through the thick insulation with a precision that belied her fear. One by one, the cables fell away, the hum from the observatory fading with each severed connection.

But it wasn’t enough.

As Sarah reached for the final cable, the roar returned, louder than ever. The air around us seemed to vibrate, the darkness above swirling furiously. I staggered back, clutching my head as the Feeder’s presence surged through me.

*THERE IS NO ESCAPE.*

The voice was deafening, a cacophony of whispers and screams that filled my mind. My vision blurred, the world tilting as the Feeder’s shadow pressed nearer. Dark tendrils coiled toward us, reaching down from the void, and I realized with sickening clarity that it wasn’t just here for the signal.

It was here for *me*.

“Sarah!” I shouted, forcing myself to stand. “Cut it! Cut the last cable!”

She hesitated, looking at me with wide, terrified eyes. “What about you?”

“Just do it!” I screamed.

She nodded, tears streaming down her face, and swung the cutters. The final cable snapped with a sharp crack, and the hum stopped. The roar faded, the air stilling as the transmission was silenced.

For a moment, there was nothing but silence.

And then the darkness exploded.

Shadowy tendrils surged in my direction, enveloping me in an instant, cutting off my air and blinding me. I screamed, the pressure crushing me. I felt the Feeder’s presence inside me again, tearing through my thoughts and unraveling my identity. Piece by piece it consumed me, and I couldn’t stop it.

But I could feel something else, too — the connection weakening, the Feeder’s grip faltering. The severed signal had disrupted its hold, breaking the link that had allowed it to reach us. I clung to that thought, to the faint hope that I might still escape.

With a final, desperate scream, I tore myself free.

The tendrils recoiled, the darkness retreating. I collapsed onto the rooftop, struggling to breathe, my body trembling. The sky above was still black, but the hum was gone, and the presence in my mind had faded.

“Timothy!” Sarah’s voice was distant. She knelt beside me, panic-stricken, her hands on my shoulders, and shook me. “Are you okay? Say something!”

“I… I think it worked,” I whispered, my voice barely audible. “The signal’s gone. We stopped it.”

But as I looked up at the sky, at the impenetrable void where the stars had been, I felt no relief. The Feeder was still out there, and it wasn’t alone. I could feel them, faint and distant, watching, *waiting*.

**Part VI**

We sat in the wreckage of the observatory, surrounded by the silence we had fought so hard to reclaim. The droning sounds were gone, and the oppressive presence of the Feeder had retreated — but the stars above remained conspicuously absent.

The rooftop was littered with severed cables and shards of broken equipment. The antenna tower stood silent, its purpose rendered obsolete by our sabotage. Sarah sat beside me, her face streaked with tears. Neither of us spoke.

It wasn’t over. I could feel it.

The Feeder’s shadow had left a mark — not just on the observatory, but on me. My mind felt fractured, haunted by its intrusions. When I closed my eyes, I could still see the tendrils, and feel the horrifying extent of its hunger. It hadn’t fully consumed me, but it had taken something. Something invaluable I couldn’t quite name–and which I might never get back.

“Timothy,” Sarah said softly, breaking the silence. Her voice was raw, hoarse from screaming. “Do you think… do you think it’s really gone?”

I opened my mouth to answer, but no words came. I didn’t know. The Feeder wasn’t like anything we had ever encountered. It wasn’t bound by the same rules or logic. It didn’t need the signal to reach us. The signal had been a convenience, a draw. Now that it knew we existed, what would stop it from returning?

“I don’t know,” I admitted finally, my voice hollow. “But… I don’t think it matters.”

She turned to me, her brow furrowed. “What do you mean?”

I gestured to the sky, to the emptiness where the stars should have been. “Look at it. It’s not just the Feeder. There are others out there. We saw them. They’re coming.”

She followed my gaze, her face pale in the dim light. The endless expanse of space seemed sinister now, as if the absence of stars were a harbinger of something far worse.

“How do you know?” she whispered.

“I can feel them,” I said, my voice trembling. “Ever since the Feeder… got inside me. It’s like they left a door open. And now—” I broke off, struggling to find the words. “They’re watching us. Biding their time.”

Sarah shivered, wrapping her arms around herself. “Then what was the point?” she asked bitterly. “If they’re still coming, if we’re all just… just prey to them, then why did we even fight?”

“Because we had to,” I said, though the words felt hollow even as I spoke them. “Because… because maybe we bought ourselves time. Maybe that’s all we can do.”

She didn’t respond, and for a long while we did nothing but sit in silence. I wanted to comfort her, to tell her that everything would be okay, but I couldn’t bring myself to lie. Not after what we had witnessed.

\* \* \* \* \* \*

By morning, the authorities had arrived. The observatory was swarmed with technicians, scientists, and government agents, their faces grim as they surveyed the damage. I watched from the sidelines as they examined the severed cables, the destroyed equipment, the shattered monitors. Sarah stood beside me, her expression unreadable.

“What do we tell them?” she asked quietly.

“The truth,” I said, though the words felt like a lead weight in my mouth. “We tell them what we saw. What we did.”

She glanced at me, her eyes searching. “And you think they’ll believe us?”

I didn’t answer. I didn’t need to. We both knew the truth: they wouldn’t believe us. Not really. They’d write it off as a technical malfunction, a breakdown in protocol. The idea of something like the Feeder — something vast, predatory, and intelligent — was too terrifying to accept. They’d bury it, just like they’d buried every other unexplainable event in human history.

But it wouldn’t matter. Not in the end.

I gave my report to a man in a dark suit with a face that betrayed nothing. He asked questions, taking notes in a black leather-bound book, his pen scratching softly against the paper. I told him everything: the discovery of the anomaly, the signals, the Feeder’s presence. I described the way it had invaded my mind, the way it had reached through the signal to make contact. I told him about the other shadows we had seen, the countless shapes moving in the void.

When I finished, he closed the notebook and stared at me for a long moment. His expression was unreadable, his eyes cold.

“And you’re certain of this?” he asked finally.

“Yes,” I said, though my voice wavered. “I know how it sounds, but… but you have to believe me. They’re coming. They’re—”

“That will be all, Dr. Cole,” he interrupted, his tone flat. “We’ll take it from here.”

I wanted to argue, to plead, but I knew it wouldn’t make a difference. They didn’t want to understand what we were facing. And in the end, it didn’t matter. The Feeder and its kind would come, whether humanity was ready or not.

Sarah and I left the observatory together, walking down the winding road that led into the valley below. The air was crisp and cold, the sky above still empty. I stared at the horizon, my mind heavy with thoughts of what lay beyond it. The stars were still gone. Would they ever return? Or had we already lost the night sky to the shadows that lurked beyond it?

I realized it wouldn’t be long before everyone else noticed. They had to.

Then, there would be global panic. Questions and no answers. Lies and cover-ups, official explanations.  Then there would be unrest, violence, and terror, and finally, perhaps–as reality reared its ugly head, cold and stark–acceptance of humanity’s *true* position in the Universe.

“Timothy,” Sarah said softly, breaking the silence. “Do you think they’ll come for us?”

“Yes,” I said, not looking at her. “Maybe not today. Maybe not tomorrow. But they’ll come.”

She didn’t respond, and for a long time, we walked in silence. The wind whispered through the trees, carrying with it a faint, distant hum that sent a shiver down my spine. I knew it wasn’t real. It was a product of my mind, forever haunted by what I’d experienced. But that didn’t make it any less terrifying.

The Feeder had left its mark, and I would carry it with me for the rest of my life.

That night, I stood outside my home, doing my best to process everything that had transpired.

Somewhere out there, in the vast, infinite expanse of our galaxy, a predator, ravenous beyond measure, lied in wait, indifferent to the desires of man.

I did the only thing I could think of in that moment.

Staring at the empty, starless sky, I mourned the loss of everything I had held dear, and everyone I had ever loved, and [I](https://www.creepypastastories.com/authors/craig-groshek/) [wept.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RM9kqK1wVts)
