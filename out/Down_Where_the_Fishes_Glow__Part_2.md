The fish hung there, staring at me, as if to say “Well, isn’t this what you wanted?”

And it was what I wanted, definitely, but I’d not been prepared to find a cave - the cave - right here, right now. I needed to go back and get the rest of my gear.

I rushed back, barely chancing a look at the sea life and coral that had amazed me moments earlier, and surfaced huffing and out of breath. Youssouf was waiting with his feet dipped off the side of the boat. He smiled when he saw me peeking out the water but that smile quickly vanished as I scrambled aboard. I met his pleasant inquiries with silence. I didn’t want to tell him about the beauty I had just witnessed. I didn’t want him - or anyone - to know about the majesty that lay just below the surface here. It wasn’t just that it was all so unbelievable, I wanted it all to myself.

I collected my equipment for the dive hastily; a guideline, a specialised underwater radio, and another air tank to make a twinset. The extra air would give me about an hour and a half of dive time, accounting for the air spent on my first outing. I could have easily stopped to pick up another fresh tank but a little voice told me to leave it and just go.

I got back in the water as fast as possible and swam back out to the edge. I spun around to gaze upon the view that had greeted me. I took it all in, every last detail. I told myself to think of that image whenever I felt afraid or confused. I held it in mind and made it my own. I told myself I was one of them. I was just a fish - a big one - swimming into a place that was made for me. It felt right. My breathing started to slow and my heart began to settle. I found my mind at peace.

I made my way down to the cave entrance once more, almost expecting it to have vanished, all a part of some bizarre fever dream. However, I spotted the piercing blue glow of the little fish in the veil of darkness and, just as before, the closer I got to it the more it softened and mellowed. There it was, motionless as ever, like it was waiting for my return.

I gazed inside. Surprisingly, the inside was not as dark as I had imagined. There seemed to be faint light beckoning from deeper within. It created an eerie effect which turned my stomach. I felt like a pauper in arm's reach of the king's jewels.

With a kick of my fin, I crossed the threshold to the inner realm of the cave. I tried to look back to my little blue guide but there was nothing to be found, only the blackness of the empty ocean. I returned my gaze forward and knew it was time for the true journey to begin. I pushed onwards.

The mouth led directly into a tunnel with flora sporadically lining either side of the walls. I remember being surprised at how large the space was. What was noteworthy too was the clarity of the water. Although I had my torch, it wasn't really required at that moment. I put this down to the light source down the way, which was now growing steadily bigger and brighter and I made my way through.

That initial tunnel went on for about 100 meters. The flora swishing ever so slightly from side to side gave me a sense of serenity as I drifted slowly past it. It was remarkably clean-looking. There weren’t many loose stones or much dirt. I started to feel foolish for my earlier panic. Despite the tranquillity of the scene, there was a palpable tension in anticipation for what was to come next. The light at the other end grew increasingly brighter as I went towards it.

Suddenly, when it appeared almost as bright as day, I emerged from the opposite end of the tunnel and into what appeared to be the crevice of a river bed. Although it was just barely wider than the tunnel itself, it stretched straight ahead, further than the eye could see. The floor, that had been there so reliably, completely disappeared into nothingness beneath me. I was now hovering, suspended in a giant chasm that seemed to reach down from the surface of the land all the way to the centre of the Earth.

Looking up, I found the source of the light that had guided me thus far. It was none other than the Sun itself, now warming my face with its gentle rays.

I struggled to rationalise that the tunnel must have been slanted upwards. I must have ascended without realising, too taken up in the moment to have even noticed. A simple look back into the cave all but dispelled this idea - the tunnel was as level as a country road. In what was beginning to be a habit, I simply shrugged off the illogical and put it down to being a trick of the light.

I considered for a second seeing how far the chasm stretched forward, but there was no way of telling and I didn't want to waste any precious time and O2. After all, I hadn't come all this way to swim the length of a river. Instead I made a mental note to investigate the river the next day and continued downwards; into the depths below.

What greeted me was a rippling reflection off of very smooth stone that looked like highland hills of black marble, overlapping into the distance. As I got deeper into the chasm and the sun's light faded, the light of my torch became accentuated and shone off the barren rocks with a beautiful sheen.

I felt so very, very small and the weight of my isolation could have felt crushing. Yet, in this cave, I did not feel alone. I felt both comfort and just the slightest sense of unease.

I looked down again, and was surprised to see the bottom of the chasm at last. It was sloped towards me. My eyes followed the path until they fell on the dim reflection of an opening directly below me. It was as though this entire chasm was built like a giant sink, and it seemed like my destination was its drain.

Upon reaching the opening, I found that it was definitely large enough for me to get through - around 3 metres from wall to wall. I had a wave of optimism at this point and the thought started to tantalise my brain.

I signalled Youssouf on radio, 23 minutes had passed. Now at a depth of 25 meters, already the signal was getting spotty. I told him I was going down and he let me know all was well up there. Again, I could detect the worry in his voice. He knew that something had overtaken me but also knew better than to open his mouth about it. I didn’t care. There was only the adventure, nothing else mattered. Going into the tunnel wasn’t the best idea, practically speaking. The logical thing would have been to come back another time, more prepared and with pre-staged air tanks set up. I knew that, but it did not stop me. I was compelled forwards. I took position in front of the opening, and pushed forward into the space.

All at once I was confined, in the dark and truly alone. I found myself marvelling at the space around me like a child with a glimmer in its eye.

The inside of this tunnel was full of the same wave-like rocks that lined the cavern above. Their reflective quality was only more pronounced in the confined solace, which meant my little torch could light up the inside nicely. I caught myself trying to determine what kind of rock this actually was but quickly decided it was a job for geologists. Still though, I had never seen stone quite like this. As I said before, they appeared perfectly smooth, almost hand-carved to perfection. When I stopped to feel one of the many arches, my hand glided along it with ease. It was as though they were from a perfectly sterile pond, without a hint of mould or slime. That, compounded with the lack of flora and the total absence of even the smallest of cavefish, told me that natural life must have had a hard time thriving down there.

The tunnel had a lot of twists and turns. One minute I was angled down, then there was a turn to the right, and next there was a sharp incline which led me back upwards. It went on and on like that. As far as I could tell, there were no offshoots from this path. There were two directions, forward and back.

All the time I was acutely aware of my oxygen reserves. I kept a constant eye on the time to make sure I had enough time to turn back. To be safe, I would need at least an hour to get back. That meant I only had about 30 minutes to explore this winding tunnel.

As I swam onwards and onwards, making too many turns to count, I noticed the walls of the cave starting to get closer and closer. It was a slow process, but it felt very sudden when, upon taking yet another left turn, both of my shoulders scraped against the sides of the tunnels at the same time.

My stomach dropped. I knew that I was rapidly coming to a very difficult decision. If I continued through this tunnel, there was the very real possibility of getting stuck. Not only that, but a routine check of the time told me I was just about approaching the 30-minute mark.

I thought about chancing it. Although I knew I shouldn’t, my mind wanted to pull me forward into the space. There were too many unknowns, though, between my air levels and simply getting stuck. As one-track as my thinking was at that time, even I could see there was no way pushing forward would end well.

For the first time since I had started planning this trip, my logical side won me over. I could clearly see the walls of the tunnel converge sharply ahead of me, and I didn't like that sign. As much as I wanted to take the plunge, I just couldn’t do it without knowing what was behind around the next corner. No, at that time I knew the right decision was to just turn around and head back.

Disappointed, but hopeful for the next day, I began the arduous process of shifting myself backwards. There wasn't nearly enough space to turn my body around, so my only option was to reverse slowly and carefully all the way back down the winding tunnel. With the notion of defeat heavy on my shoulders, I decided to take a look at my dive computer one last time.

25 metres. No change. It was like some sick joke. All of that winding around, and it had gotten me to the point I had started. With a silent sigh, I switched to my second air tank and started shuffling backwards.

I used my fins to carefully feel along the walls. I didn't have a clue where any of the turns were since I had already gone through so many. The task was laborious and frustrated me to no end, but I did my best to keep a cool head.

After not too long, my fins brushed up against the top of the tunnel unexpectedly. It’s confusing, feeling a wall where you don’t expect one. My face an invisible scowl behind my mask, I felt around blindly with my heel. This tunnel was a long, massive cone. It was meant to be getting wider. Although I was confused, I shook the feeling off and continued reversing. It wasn't like I had much of a choice.

My foot hit into the bottom of the tunnel this time, right on the ridge of the arches I had thought were so beautiful. I let out a grunt in pain. I had hit it hard, and it hurt like hell. I started cursing the cave, letting my annoyance seep out of me and into the water.

I hit the top again. Then the bottom, and then the top once more. I was beginning to doubt myself. For a moment, I even wondered if I had somehow got turned around; maybe forwards was back the other way? I stopped moving and tried to get my bearings.

Then the noise started. It was a horrible, crunching sound. It was loud – louder than a jet engine and far more intense. It was like a monstrous machine grinding down on the rock all around me. My head pulsed with anguish, and it made me clutch and squeeze my head as though that would make it stop. Then, I felt the cool touch of the tunnel walls as they started to squeeze in on both my legs. It was collapsing behind me.

I lurched forward immediately, moving as fast as I could in the tight space. It was my worst nightmare, being crushed to death at the bottom of a forgotten cave. I was outright panicking, but I tried to focus on the tunnel ahead. After not very long I could see where I had got to before, right by the sharp corner.

I kicked my fins as hard as I could and shot right into the opening. However, I was knocked back hard. I was too big.

I had a sinking feeling like nothing I could even describe. I thought for sure I was dead, destined to be spaghettified and then squashed to a pulp. But I did have one more mad idea just then.

Acting on only reflex, I hastily unhooked my air tanks. At this point I knew I was dead if I didn’t act. At least I had a chance this way, however slim. With my body smaller and lighter, I pushed forward into the opening, with my arms stretched ahead like a torpedo.

I felt my arms grind on the walls as I hooked my body around the bend before breaking through to the other side. It was tight, but I made it. However, I was still in immediate danger and kept swimming as hard as I could. There was barely enough space to kick my feet in this section, and I could feel the space getting smaller as I went. The space behind me was quickly shrinking and constricting. I focused on keeping my body as contained as possible and powering ahead, with the threat of certain death as my driving force.

Within a couple of seconds, the space behind me became too small to even kick. I had to use my hands to drag myself through by finding purchase on some of the taller rock arches. I was no longer swimming but pulling myself along as fast as my arms would work. At some point, one of my fins got caught in the closing tunnel, so I quickly kicked it off and continued pulling. I left it there as food for the hungry cave.

Just when I thought my arms could not carry me anymore and I thought all hope was lost, my outstretched arm burst through the surface of the water and was met with open air. I scrambled to find some purchase to pull myself out of the tunnel, and, astonishingly and with only seconds to spare, my hand found a solid piece of rock to grab hold of. I pulled as hard as my buckling arms would allow me, burst from the opening and crumpled in a pile on the floor.

Then, I just lay there for a while with my eyes closed and my chest heaving for the oxygen which it was so grateful for. I was attempting to absorb what had just happened. I knew when I opened my eyes again, I would need to face the horror of my position. I just wasn't ready for that yet. So, there I lay. When I did eventually open my eyes again, nothing could have prepared me for what I saw.
