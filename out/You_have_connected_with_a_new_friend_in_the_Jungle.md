*You have connected with a new friend in the Jungle.*

An arrow appeared at the top of my phone’s screen.  Above it was a username:  *Eddie_Jokes*.  Below, a distance as the arrow bobbed with my motion to keep pointing at this funny guy Eddie.  *4m*.

I looked down the train car and saw an older, heavyset man with a long, black and grey beard sitting further down on the opposite side.  He didn’t look like he was that jolly—in fact he looked kind of ill-tempered and morose—but he had earbuds in and the arrow and distance were right, so it must be him.  Turning back to my phone, I hit play.

My ears were suddenly filled with the bright sounds of k-pop and I burst out laughing.

**** 

“So what’s it called?”

I shrugged as I took a bite of sandwich.  “Share Jungle.  It’s weird but kind of cool.” 

Mari looked over her salad at me skeptically.  “It sounds weird and dumb.  Meeting creepers and their creeper stuff.”

Laughing, I rolled my eyes at her.  “You’re so dramatic.  It’s not like that.  It’s just this app that like…so like if you’re listening to some streaming app or whatever, if you have Share Jungle on, other people that are close by will get a pop up that you’re near and they can click play to hear what you’re listening to.  It’s like a weird social experiment way of finding new music and learning about people.”  I smirked.  “Or if you see a cute guy you can use it as a conversation starter or something.”

She grimaced.  “I guess.  But what, the app just listens to whatever you’re doing on your phone?”  

I shook my head.  “Nah, you have to log in to your streaming apps and give permission.  They have some beta feature where you can share media files on your phone if they aren’t copyrighted, but I didn’t turn that on.  It’s not like it’s listening to your phone calls or something.”

Mari pulled out her phone and poked at it skeptically.  “Eh, I don’t know.  I’m going to be in the airport for hours today, so maybe it’ll be funny.”  She shot me a dark look.  “But if I get hacked or something, you’re buying me a new phone.”

**** 

I groaned as my phone started chiming in the dark of my bedroom.  Picking it up, I saw it was 4 in the morning, but I also saw it was Mari.  She had only been in London for three days but I could tell things weren’t going great with her father.  The trip was supposed to last another two weeks, but I wondered if she’d last that long.  Wiping at my eye, I answered the call.

“Bitch, you do know it’s still the middle of the night here, right?”

“I…I know, I’m sorry, but I really needed to talk to you.”

Sitting up, I felt instantly awake.  I’d been friends with her since we were twelve and I’d only heard her sound scared like this a couple of times.

“What’s wrong?  Are you okay?”

There was a pause and her voice was trembling when she spoke again.  “I don’t know.  I think I may be in danger?  But it may just be me being an idiot too.”

Working to keep the frustration out of my voice, I tried again.  “Just calm down and tell me what happened.”

**** 

So…well, things with Dad have been…about like I figured.  It’s okay, but when he suggested I get out and explore some yesterday, I took him up on it.  Got on one of those big red tourist buses?  The double-decker like in Harry Potter or something.  It was cool.  And London is pretty neat.  I haven’t been here since I was like eight so it’s all pretty new to me.

But I made the mistake of picking the long tour.  After the first hour I still had another hour to go, and I was getting kind of bored.  I didn’t want to get off because it was pricey, but I also started fiddling with my phone more.  Decided to listen to some music while I looked at the scenery.  

I told you I installed that Share Jungle app, and it was kind of fun using it in Atlanta and Gatwick.  I didn’t know if I’d have any luck on the bus or like how many people even had it over here, but I picked up a couple.  Their music was shit, so I kept going, but it did make me feel a little less lonely sitting up on that bus by myself.

Then I got a new notification.  A new user, his name was The_Path, came on.  And the notification was different than the others.  It said “Personal Media Files” under the name.  I almost didn’t click it, but then I did.

At first, I almost busted out laughing.  I thought I was listening to a porno or something.  I could hear this woman screaming and…well, I figured some dude had started watching porn and forgot he had Share Jungle on.  

But it wasn’t that.  I started hearing banging—it sounded like someone beating on a wall or…maybe breaking through a door.  And then the woman was screaming louder and begging.  This wasn’t some roleplay either—she was really scared.  And then the stabbing sounds started.

It’s weird.  I’ve never seen someone get stabbed or even get really badly hurt.  But as soon as I heard those sounds I knew what it was.  My mind hadn’t even had a chance to go there yet, but I knew.

**** 

My heart was pounding now and I couldn’t help but cut in.  “Maybe it was just a horror movie or something.  I know it says it won’t stream stuff from your phone that’s copyrighted, but half the time that shit doesn’t work right.  Could it have been something like that?”

I could feel her thinking on the other end of the line.  “It’s possible, but I don’t think so.  The woman…the sounds she started making when they were killing her…”  I could tell she was crying now.  “I’ve never heard any movie that sounded like that.”

Letting out a shaky breath, I nodded to the empty room.  “Okay.  Sorry.  What did you do?”


**** 

I didn’t know *what* to do.  We were at a stop light when I started listening, so I’d hoped the distance would go up when we started forward again, but it didn’t.  Whoever it was, they weren’t on the street nearby.  They were on the bus with me.

At first, I just turned it off and put my phone away.  I didn’t want to act strange or anything—draw their attention, you know.  So I just sat there, terrified, staring out at whatever we were passing by.  When we got to the next stop, I got off the bus and walked a couple of blocks.  Went into a coffee shop and just sat there for awhile, trying to calm down and give the bus time to get far away.

It wasn’t until I pulled back out my phone that I realized I’d accidently starting playing my own music when I’d put it up on the bus.  And I had a notification on the top of my screen.

*You have connected with a new friend in the Jungle.  Josie08 is listening to your sick beats!*

I…I’d never had someone connect to mine before, so I didn’t know.  Or at least didn’t think about it. When someone listens to your stuff, you get notified too.  You get the same arrow and distance they do, and you see their username. 

Whoever was on that bus with me…they knew I’d heard.  And if they were paying attention, they knew I was on the bus with them and that the distance got further away when I got off.

It freaked me out.  Of course it did.  Even though it was expensive, I called a taxi and waited until it got there before I went back outside.  I even had it take a weird route to get back to my Dad’s, just in case someone was trying to follow me.

I know this all sounds overdramatic probably.  Honestly, I was starting to feel silly by the time I woke up this morning.  Freaking myself out over some dumb thing I heard when no one had bothered me and it probably *was* a porno or horror movie or something after all.  Telling myself it was to just show I wasn’t scared anymore, I made myself open Share Jungle again.  One nearby user popped up right away.

The_Path.

Jesse, they were only 30 meters away!  They were outside my Dad’s fucking house!  I…I don’t know what to do.  I don’t have anything to tell cops or something, and if I tell Dad he’ll just think I’m being stupid.  But I know something is wrong.  There’s no way that’s a coincidence.  Somehow they followed me here.  And you’re the only one that’ll believe me.

**** 

“Jesus.  I mean, yeah I believe you.  It doesn’t mean you’re in real danger, but who knows?  People are crazy and you can’t take a chance with that.  I think you should talk to your Dad about it anyway.  He might know someone at the police station that can look into it, or at least be on the look out if someone is creeping around.”

She sighed.  “Yeah, maybe.  I just don’t know that it’ll do any good.”

I felt myself growing irritated.  “If he won’t listen, then fuck him.  Come on back home.”

Mari gave a little laugh.  “Yeah, maybe I will.  He’s at a meeting right now, but when he gets home this afternoon I’ll talk to him about it.  You…just go back to sleep.  I’ll text you later.”

“You sure?  We can talk more if you need to.”

“No, I’m okay now.  Talking to you made me feel a little better.  Night night.”

And then she was gone.

I had trouble going back to sleep, finally getting up at six and heading on into work.  I kept checking my phone throughout the morning, and when I didn’t hear anything from her by noon, I called her.  No answer.  I tried again a couple of hours later and then a few minutes after that.  The last time, her father picked up.

He told me that the police were there with him and let him answer the call when I called back again so soon.  That he’d gotten home an hour earlier to find that the house had been broken into.  He started crying then, his words barely comprehensible islands of meaning in between his racking sobs.  

He had found Mari on the stairs.  Someone had stabbed her to death.

**** 

That was over a month ago.  In some ways it seems like that time has stretched on forever, while in others it seems like it just happened.  I’ve tried to be there for Mari’s mother and little sister, but it’s been hard.  Not just because I miss her so much, but because I feel like I’m to blame.  If I had given her better advice, if I’d made her call the police right then, if I’d not told her about that fucking app.

Funny thing is, I still have it on my phone.  Much as I hate it now, I can’t quite make myself get rid of it.  I think a part of me feels like I deserve the punishment of being reminded every time it pops up a notification or I see it on my home screen.  I haven’t really used it since then though.  I don’t want to be around anyone, much less connecting to random strangers.

Until yesterday.

I forced myself to get out of the house and walk around, and before long I found myself back at the same sandwich shop that me and Mari used to always go to.  My chest felt like it was going to cave in as I picked the same outside table we’d sat at when I first told her about the app.

I managed to hold off until I’d ordered—not my usual, but this weird club sandwich that Mari used to always get.  Then I took out my phone and opened Share Jungle.  If I was going to open my wounds, I needed to get the salt in deep.

The search icon spun for a second and then found one connection.  Reading it, I dropped the phone to the table like it was hot.  That couldn’t be right.

*The_Path*.

Fighting for breath, I started looking all around.  There were people on both sides of the street, but no one that stood out.  Glancing back at my phone, I saw that the arrow was pointing down the street and said the distance was about 200 meters.  

I didn’t know what to do.  Should I go look for them?  How would I find them, and if I did, what would I do?  Get myself killed, most likely.  And I could call 911, but did I have enough to tell them that they could help?  Would they even take me seriously?

Blood pounding in my ears, I fished around in my bag for headphones.  Finally finding them, I connected to the phone.  I half-hoped the name and arrow would be gone now, but it was still there.

*The_Path.  Personal Media Files.  201m.*

I hit play.  My head was suddenly filled with screams of pain and terror as my gorge began to rise and my eyes filled with tears.  That motherfucker.  That mother fucking…

It was Mari.  I was listening to Mari getting murdered.

Ripping out the earphones, I jumped up from the table and ran in the direction the arrow pointed.  I didn’t care anymore.  Any fear or worry had been replaced with blind rage, and I just wanted the compass to guide me to the thing that did that to her so I could tear it apart.

*160m.*

*115m.*

*92m.*

And then it was gone.

**** 
I went to the police and after waiting an hour, I talked to a detective that listened attentively before politely pointing out that I had no recording to play for them and no leads for them to investigate.  He said that even examining my phone wouldn’t amount to anything, as they didn’t have a way of tracking the app users without a search warrant to the company, and I didn’t have enough for them to get one.

I left there last night angry and depressed, wondering what else I could do until The_Path found me again.  When I got home, I checked every room thoroughly and locked myself in the bedroom—steak knife in one hand and phone in the other.  I was finally falling asleep when my phone chimed.

*You have connected with an old friend in the Jungle.*  

My heard sped up.  The Path.

Putting in my headphones, my hands were shaking so bad I had to hit the play button twice before I could get it to start.  When it did, I felt my brain shudder as a wave of déjà vu passed through me.  It was two people talking and I recognized the voices.  It was me and Mari.

“…it called?”

“Share Jungle.  It’s weird but kind of cool.”

“It sounds weird and dumb.  Meeting creepers and their creeper stuff.”

Vision swimming, I looked toward the window and then back down at my phone.

*The_Path.  Personal Media Files.  45m.*

*41m.*
