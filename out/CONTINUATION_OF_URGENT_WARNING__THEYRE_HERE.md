To those who found my first message,

If you’re reading this, then I pray it’s not too late. I’ve been in hiding since I sent out my first warning, moving from place to place as I evade those who have been searching for me, both human and otherwise. I must tell you what has happened since the breach of the Obsidian Pyramid in Antarctica. The consequences have already begun to manifest, and they’re being misinterpreted as mere coincidences or unexplained phenomena.

January 2022: The Hunga Tonga Eruption

Just days after we disturbed the Obsidian Pyramid, the Hunga Tonga volcano in the Pacific Ocean erupted with unprecedented force. The blast was so powerful that it triggered tsunamis, sent shockwaves around the globe, and released ash into the stratosphere. While scientists attributed the eruption to natural causes, I believe it was the first sign of the world destabilizing. The pyramid’s pulse may have triggered seismic activity on a scale we hadn’t anticipated.

March 2022: The Surge of Mysterious Lights

Reports began to flood in from around the world about strange lights in the skies, globes of light hovering silently, zigzagging across the sky, and then vanishing. These lights were seen over remote locations as well as populated cities. Many dismissed them as drones or atmospheric phenomena, but I knew better. These lights were reconnaissance probes sent by the beings we awakened, scouting out our world for their invasion.

October 2022: The Global Power Surge

One night, in mid-October, a massive power surge knocked out grids across several continents. Cities were plunged into darkness, and chaos ensued. Official reports cited failures in infrastructure or cyberattacks, but the truth is more chilling. The pulses from the Obsidian Pyramid had reached a critical threshold, disrupting the electromagnetic field of the Earth. The surge was a precursor, a test by the entities to weaken our defenses.

June 2023: The Mass Animal Deaths

Starting in mid-2023, reports of mass animal deaths began to surface, thousands of birds falling from the sky, fish washing up dead on shores, and entire herds of livestock found lifeless in their fields. While experts scrambled for explanations, the truth was clear to those of us who knew. These deaths were a result of the entities’ probes affecting life forms on Earth, testing the limits of their abilities before they moved on to their true targets—us.

November 2023: The Disturbance in Antarctica

Satellite images from November 2023 revealed something that sent a shiver down my spine, the ice around the location of the Obsidian Pyramid had begun to melt at an alarming rate, despite the frigid temperatures. The pyramid itself was emitting a low-frequency hum, now detectable even from orbit. This was no ordinary melt. The pyramid was waking up, and with it, the ancient beings within.

February 2024: The Disappearances

Over the past few months, an alarming number of disappearances have been reported worldwide. Entire villages in remote regions have gone silent, with no signs of struggle or violence, just emptiness, as if the people were simply erased from existence. Local authorities are baffled, attributing it to anything from cult activity to natural disasters, but those of us who know the truth are terrified. The entities are here, and they are taking people, either for experimentation or as the first step in their invasion.

August 2024: The Message from the Void

Just last week, on August 10th, 2024, a message was intercepted by multiple deep-space listening stations around the world. It was a garbled transmission, barely intelligible, but what little could be deciphered was chilling. The message was in no known language, yet every linguist who analyzed it came to the same conclusion, it was a warning. A warning that the entities we awakened are on their way, and nothing can stop them.

  
**My Final Warning**

If you are still out there, listening, know that this is just the beginning. The events of the past two years are not isolated incidents, they are part of a larger pattern, one that leads to our eventual extinction. The entities from the Obsidian Pyramid are beyond anything we can comprehend, and they are moving closer to reclaim what they believe is theirs.

I don’t know how much time we have left. I don’t know if there’s anything we can do to stop them. But if there’s one thing I’ve learned, it’s that the truth must be known. Prepare yourself, and tell as many people as you can. Maybe, just maybe, we can find a way to survive what’s coming.

Stay vigilant. Stay alive.
