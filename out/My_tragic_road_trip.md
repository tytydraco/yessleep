Introduction:

Two groups of five high school classmates were planning a road trip, but both groups rejected me, Max, the guy who doesnâ€™t have many friends. The third group accepted me, making them seem generous, though their true intentions would soon change my mind.

The three groups left in their cars, heading to a specific meeting location.

My group consisted of Kane (the leader), his girlfriend Sarah, John (Kane's best friend), John's girlfriend Karen, and me. Kane and John are both spoiled teens since their dads are successful businessmen, which makes them feel like they can do anything.

The Story Begins:

The road trip had started. Kane was driving the car with Sarah beside him. In the backseat, John and Karen were touching each other while I quietly looked out the window at the passing scenery.

John got excited and wanted to make out with Karen. They didn't mind Kane and Sarah seeing since they'd done this many times before. However, they wanted me to move to the trunk of the car so they could be more intimate.

I refused initially, but Kane manipulated me by promising it would be quick. Trusting Kane as a big brother figure, I reluctantly agreed and climbed into the trunk.

Half an hour passed, but the car hadn't stopped. I started to feel anxious as it became hot and hard to breathe. I began calling out, "Kane! I can't breathe! Please open the trunk! Get me out, please!"

Kane responded by turning up the volume of the music to drown out my pleas.

After a few moments, my cries stopped. John noticed and told Kane to stop the car to check on me.

They pulled over and opened the trunk to find that I was almost unconscious. I was still able to hear the conversations.

John asked, "Is he dead?"

Kane checked, "No, he still has a pulse."

John suggested, "Alright, where should we dump him then?"

Karen pointed to a nearby river, "Probably the river over there."

Kane disagreed, "No, we shouldn't kill him. We could win a court case, but dealing with court is annoying."

Sarah, concerned, said, "Guys, we shouldn't do this."

Kane reassured her, "It's alright. He didn't fit in our group anyway. John, help me pick up his body."

They threw me into an abandoned hut beside the highway. Before leaving, I halfly opened my eyes to witness Sarah looking at me, secretly feeling bad for me.

They left without a second thought. A few hours later, I woke up confused. I slowly remembered what had happened.

My phone had no signal since I was in the middle of nowhere. I thought they went to roam around until I regained consciousness.

I believed Kane would come back for me and waited for two more hours until midnight. It was dark, and I could only see with my phone's flashlight. I decided to go back home, which was 10 km away. I was tired and knew walking 10 km at midnight wasn't safe.

I saw a car approaching and hopelessly asked for a lift, despite knowing it was unlikely anyone would stop for a stranger at midnight in the middle of nowhere.

Surprisingly, the car stopped. The driver was a mysterious-looking man in his mid-30s, wearing goggles and a coat. He agreed to give me a lift home.

I thanked the stranger and entered the backseat.

The stranger asked, "What were you doing out there at such a time?"

I explained what had happened.

The stranger, with a pitying look, said, "The word 'friend' has a very high value, and you shouldn't give it to just anyone."

"Anyway, what do you do, kid?" he asked.

"I'm a high school student. What about you?" I replied.

"I'm a hitman," he said without hesitation.

Nervously, I asked, "For real?"

The stranger smiled and nodded, saying, "I don't kill anyone for money, though."

"What do you mean by that?" I asked.

"I mean, I don't blindly assassinate anyone. Only those who've done something terrible in the past. You see, I'm like karma for them."

I was speechless as the stranger continued.

"I thoroughly research my targets to ensure they deserve what's coming to them," he explained.

The stranger stopped the car, looked at me, and said, "Don't you want to go home?"

I looked out the window and saw my house. I couldn't believe my eyes that I was in the same car as a hitman. I quickly opened the car door and rushed home.

The next day, while watching TV, I saw news about Kane and John. They had both committed suicide by hanging. I was so shocked and traumatized that I fainted on the spot.

While I was unconscious, I saw a dream..... in a dimly lit room, the same hitman I met the previous night sat in front of a computer screen. A notification popped up, and he read the text message: "$10,000 received from Sarah." A slow, sinister smile spread across his face, revealing a hint of satisfaction behind his mysterious eyes.
