Lies. She had to be lying. 

Running, hiding was pointless, as it turned out. A sick joke. I had a lovely little tracker inside me the whole time. That’s how Michelle found me. Well, not Michelle. Her name was Nichole. There never was a Michelle. Elizabeth LaFleur never had a cousin named Michelle. That’s what she told me. She told me a lot of things, but none of it can be true. Can it?

The moment I recognized her voice, my whole body went rigid. The full spectrum of human emotion spiraled through me and landed on fear. 
“I knew you would freak out when you saw me, so I had to take precautions,” her voice was still low and had a tinge of impatience. “I am sorry, Liz. This isn’t how things should have turned out. I am not the one who attacked you the night you ran. It was my stand-in.”

What? What on earth does that mean? I thought skeptically. I couldn’t speak as her hand was still firmly clamped on my mouth. 

“If I let go, will you stay quiet? Hear me out? I swear I am not going to hurt you,” she asked. What the hell was I supposed to do? I nodded. She hesitated, then her grip slackened. I slipped away from her, trying to see the door through the sea of black within the room. There was a click and the sudden light from the lamp burned through my eyes and stung inside my skull. I was disoriented as my eyes adjusted. I could see the door. Michelle must have predicted my actions and darted between me and the exit. She was too fast. Her face wore a determined scowl, and she pointed to the bed, “Sit down, Liz. Damnit. It’s like trying to talk sense into an anxiety ridden squirrel!” 

I sat. Even through everything, the small nip of petty indignation I felt at being called an anxious squirrel bubbled its way up to the surface, and Michelle smirked at me for a split second. She remained in front of the door but took a step toward me, back in business mode. 

“I know you don’t trust me. You shouldn’t. But I need you to take a leap of faith, Liz. Just one. And then I will tell you what I know. It’s not everything. It might not even be more than you have guessed, but I’ll tell you.”

I remained silent but looked at her expectantly. She cleared her throat and started pacing.
“Ok. So, I guess the first thing I should tell you is that you have a tracker implanted in you. They have known where you were since before you left the facility,” she began. I started to interrupt, but she held up a finger, “There’s a lot, just let me finish.” She sighed and stopped pacing. There was a heavy chair in the corner of the room, she dragged it to a spot between me and the door, still guarding.

“Also, I am not Michelle. There never was a Michelle. My name is Nichole. My job was to oversee your transition and assimilation into society. I don’t know the details of the program…just that it was military, and it started with memory implantation, turned into a pseudo cloning project.” She said all of this almost robotically. The last of what she said barely reached my ears. There never was a Michelle. Those words ricocheted in my head like a pinball. I felt a panic attack starting in my chest, the weight was heavy in my bones, threatening to crush me. Michelle…Nichole snapped her fingers at me, “Hey. You with me? We don’t have much time. I gotta get through this. And then we have to get the tracker out of you.”

Wait.

“Hold on. Tracker out? They want it out? Why?” I interjected.

“They don’t. I do. I want to help you,” she said, delicately, her face sheepish. My knee-jerk reaction was Bull shit. This is a trick. She knew me too well, and, in reading my face, she said “I am not trying to deceive you… Not anymore. They threatened me, my family. I had no choice. Please believe me.”

This plea for trust, for faith, for belief was ludicrous. “How can I EVER believe anything from you? Not only were you working for the people that ruined my life and stole five YEARS from me – not to mention I don’t even know who ME is! – but you were my family. You were my best friend, and it was ALL A LIE!” I was fuming. Hot, angry tears pricked at the corners of my eyes. I stood and stared at her defiantly, “I HATE YOU!” The last three words I filled with all the venom and vitriol within me, but as I said them, I felt like a petulant teenager screaming at her parents. Some of the contempt I felt left me as I saw she was crying. The tears flowed down her face freely. She was not sobbing, and she made no attempt to wipe them away.

“I…I am so deeply sorry. You have no idea. I refused to subdue you that night. They knew I slipped up and you were on to me. I refused. They couldn’t let the project fail. They wouldn’t allow me to fail,” the professional tone broke and her voice cracked as she this last thing. She took a shuddering breath, then continued, trying to resume a matter-of-fact cadence. “So, they sent in my double. She is much more…enthusiastic about her role. Plus, she was bitter they chose me to be your babysitter and not her.”

Her double. HER double? No. Bull shit. I made a sharp movement, itching to launch myself at this woman, this imposter – double or not. But before I could do more than twitch, Nichole warned me. “Liz. Stay seated. I don’t want to hurt you. Don’t make me.” That was when I saw the gun and all the air evaporated from my lungs. A lead weight slid into my stomach, and I let out a small whimper in spite of myself. She seemed to pull the damn thing from thin air. One second, she was just sitting in that rickety chair, hands clasped together on her lap, the next there is a gun gripped tightly in her right fist. The way she shifted from raw, emotional, to menacing was unnerving. I could feel the blood surging in my ears, my breath was shallow and quick. My whole body trembled and ached from the attempt to keep calm. I kept my eyes fixed on the dull metal in her hand, fully aware that this person before me held all the cards. But she said she was there to help me. She said she had answers. Fear, anger, recklessness, and caution were battling inside, and my body was held together now by sheer will.

“Why. The. FUCK. Do YOU have a …double?” I asked angrily, trying to maintain control of every syllable. “And WHY should I believe that you right now aren’t some carbon copy of the bitch I killed in my apartment?” My fingers were painfully digging into my legs as I suppressed the rage boiling up inside me. “How STUPID do you think I am?!” I swallowed hard as these words spewed out of me, terrified I had gone too far.

Nichole’s head dipped down, while gripping the gun more tightly. She seemed to be struggling to decide what to say next.

“I worked for the DOD. I was transferred to a special research project. Everyone on the team was given a double. It was phase three of their experiment. You were phase four. Taking civilians and doubling them. And phase five. Sending them back out to see what worked. You weren’t the first success in phase four, but you were to be the first in phase five.”

My head was spinning. This was insanity. Despite the things I had seen, the things I already knew, I still could not wrap my mind around this. I slumped forward, elbows on my knees, hands on my face, forgetting Nichole and her gun entirely for a brief moment. I couldn’t know anymore. My brain was full. How much – if any – was true? And the question I had been longing to find an answer to finally passed my lips. In barely more than a whisper, I asked, “Am I really Elizabeth LaFleur?” I looked up at Nichole, eager to see the answer in her expression or body language before it came from her mouth. 

She shifted uncomfortably, her eyebrows pulled together, and her eyes narrowed, preparing for bad news. 

She relaxed her hand with the gun, took a deep breath, and said, “I don’t know.”
