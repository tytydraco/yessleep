I lost my mom to cancer 3 weeks ago. She was always a mysterious woman. She battled it for a long time, so her death was expected. I feel like I am evil for saying this but I have to admit that I was kinda hoping she’d die sooner for the inheritance. As an only child growing up without a father, my mother and I had an extremely close relationship. That was until my teenage years. When I was a little boy she’d repeat the same sentence to me every day: “You are the best thing that has happened to me, Michael.” And every day after she said that sentence I reminded her that I knew that and she could stop repeating that if she wanted to. And she did, as soon as I hit high school. The mother I was used to, changed. She was diagnosed with a series of medical problems, and though she had a stable income and was able to pay off her medical bills, she didn’t appreciate life like she used to. She stopped showing me affection. In fact, she often lashed out at me and resorted to beating me over little things like finding clothing on the floor of my room.  
  
By the time I was 22 I had started courses to become a private investigator, this meant that I would be able to leave my once enjoyable childhood home for a couple of years and leave some distance between me and my mother. The course took a swift three years. Just two weeks after finishing, she had been diagnosed with cancer and needed full-time medical attention.  
  
Armed with my newly acquired investigative skills, I sought out cases that provided a much-needed escape from the complexities of my relationship with my mother. However, beneath the surface, guilt tugged at my conscience. The mix of lingering resentment and love for her created an internal conflict that seemed inescapable.  
  
As her health declined, I found myself taking on the role of her primary caregiver, a duty I reluctantly shouldered. The weight of responsibility bore down on me, both emotionally and financially. I couldn't help but wonder if my strained relationship with my mother had contributed to her declining health.  
  
One investigation stuck out to me in particular. The man I was investigating held a similar lifestyle to me. Supporting an abusive mother that was riddled with diseases, soon to inherit a portion of her money and full ownership of her house, as he had no father and only had one other sibling. However, this man brought himself to something inhumane. He had smothered his mother with a pillow to dodge the costs of medical treatments and inherit her finances sooner. But with a solid income, the only thing that would bring me to taking my mother’s life was the time I had given up on my job, sitting next to her in a shitty hospital room instead.  
  
At that moment, I weighed the negative and positive qualities she had and decided to change my mind. I don’t know why I even spent time with her, this lady neglected and abused me throughout my teenage years, bringing nothing but trauma to the years of my childhood that were meant to be the most memorable ones. I told the nurses watching over her at that moment that I wanted to spend some time alone with her. I locked the door to the room once they left and gazed at her for a moment as she slept silently. Looking around and seeing no security camera, I quickly picked up the pillow beside her and forcefully wrapped it around her face. But she didn’t move.  
  
As the minutes passed, it almost felt like something was preventing her death. She didn’t wake up, just slept there silently as if the pillow that was supposed to be suffocating her was invisible. Suddenly, her eyes lit up. They glowed so fiercely I was able to see them through the pillow. Pulling the pillow back towards me, I saw something that didn’t look like my mother. A huge grin spread across her face. Her teeth looked sharper than an animal’s and her skin color was turning paler with each passing second.  I jumped back in horror, as she laid there facing the ceiling with that massive, unnaturally wide grin. Stumbling over myself while getting up, her face was extremely still but her eyes were following my every step. I crept back to the door and slowly tried to open it, but it wouldn’t move. Goosebumps ran down my body. My hands were trembling as I reached for the doorknob to unlock it. I couldn’t look back at the door, paralyzed in fear as my eyes were completely focused on my mother. I felt for the lock but there was nothing there.   
  
Knowing I had to look at the door, I thought taking my eyes off my mother for just a second wouldn’t give her enough time to get out of her bed, as she was old and weak. I quickly turned around and looked down, my stomach dropping upon gazing at what my hand was clutching and I quickly pulled my hands back, covering my mouth to block out the noise of my screams. Attached to the door was a collection of severed fingers perfectly shaped to resemble a door handle.  I was paralyzed in fear. I almost forgot that my mother was behind me, and knew I had to turn back around. But as much as I tried I just couldn’t. I felt the presence of my mother just inches behind me as her cold breath ran down my neck.   
  
My hands clenched together to form a fist as I finally built up the courage to turn around and fight whatever was behind me, but upon turning around, I saw my mother sound asleep in her bed, with no unnaturally wide grin, sharp teeth, or glowing eyes covering her face. But the pillow I used to smother her was in the same position that I left it in. And attached to the door was the regular knob that I had locked before. I heard my mother's raspy voice start laughing hysterically behind me. She laughed so hard she coughed, all while repeating the same words over and over again: “You are the best thing that has happened to me, Michael.”  
  
I stood frozen in the doorway, my heart pounding in my chest as I tried to comprehend the horrifying scene before me. Was I losing my mind? Has the stress and guilt finally taken their toll on me? I couldn't trust my senses anymore. My mother's laughter continued to echo in the room, each cackle sending chills down my spine. I mustered the courage to speak, my voice barely above a whisper. "Mom... What's happening? What is this?" The laughter abruptly stopped, replaced by an eerie silence that hung in the air like a heavy fog. My mother's eyes met mine, devoid of the glow I had witnessed moments ago.   
  
Her expression softened, and a faint smile curved her lips. "Michael, my dear, it seems you have caught a glimpse of something you were not meant to see," she said in a voice that sounded both familiar and otherworldly. Confusion and fear mingled within me, my emotions teetering on the edge of hysteria. "What... What do you mean? What was that?" She motioned for me to come closer, her frail hand trembling. Reluctantly, I took a step forward, drawn by an unexplainable force that compelled me to listen. As I stood beside her bed, she spoke in a low, raspy whisper:  
“Wonder why I only had one child? I mean, with a job like mine I could’ve easily supported a family of 4, but I was only told to have one, Michael. He told me I could only have you.”  
  
Her words sent a chill down my spine. A wave of nausea washed over me. I struggled to comprehend the meaning behind her cryptic statement. "Who told you that, Mom? What are you talking about?" I asked, my voice trembling with both fear and confusion. My mom muttered under her breath, with a slight grin coming back. “Be patient my dear, you’ll see.” At that very moment, her heart monitor started to flatline and I sprinted out of the room. The lights in the hospital hall flickered and every second I ran felt like hours. I got into my car and sped off, unaware of where I was headed.  
  
I woke up in a cold sweat, my heart pounding in my chest as the nightmare still lingered in my mind. The image of my mother's wide grin and her words haunted me. It took a moment to realize that it was just a dream, but the lingering discomfort remained. That morning, I received a call from the hospital; my mother had passed away in her sleep. Days turned into weeks, and I found myself inheriting my childhood home, a place that held both cherished memories and deep scars. The house stood as a silent witness to the relationship I had with my mother. As an only child without any close relatives, I decided against holding a funeral for her. It seemed fitting, considering the complicated bond we shared.   
  
After exploring the house for the first time in 5 years, things felt off. The toilet seat was up. My mother was the only person inside her house since I was gone, and it being the bathroom that was connected to her room, it wouldn’t make any sense for the toilet seat to be up. She couldn’t have put it up to clean it, since it was dirty. As a private investigator, I had a habit of overthinking little details like this. I decided to take a closer look. Feeling along the edges of the seat, it felt bumpy; like something was carved into it. I rubbed my eyes and looked again. The toilet was covered in messages with sloppy handwriting carved into it; all of them reading the same thing. “You are the best thing that has ever happened to me, Michael.”
