Hello, It's me, Thomas Baker, and I am still turning into an insect.

Thank you, Kind stranger, I have taken your advice into account, and have begun watching my muscle growth as I continue to change.

My skin is turning yellow-ish green, and my eyes have begun to warp, My vision is degrading, But my senses are growing.

Just yesterday, I could smell the vomit of a fellow inmate multiple rooms away from me, and I could faintly hear the footsteps of a guard coming from miles away.

My mouth has also begun to... deform, My lower jaw is slitting in half, slowly and painfully, giving me a pair of humanoid mandibles, eating was hard for a few days before my new teeth came in.

Oh, and I grew 2 antannae-like protrusions on my head, though I would consider that far less important.

Regardless, I have gotten much stronger, and while I would say my transformation is about 25% complete, I think I am strong enough to break out now.

Today, once I was certain that none of the guards were near the door, I stood, and ran for the door.

I slammed my shoulder against it, And it already cracked from my weight, I pounded my fists against it with the ferocity of a vicious animal, And the nails popped and gave, the door broke down.

I saw a guard turn around the corner, perfect, I had a target for my anger.

Without mercy, I jumped on the armored soldier and tackled him to the ground with my budding strength.

I punched him a few times, but before I could do more than mere dents in his armor, I felt a pinprick sensation in my shoulder.

It was a dart.

I felt myself collapsing to the ground, and losing consciousness, and the last thing I heard before passing out was:

"...He's changing faster than we thought, Ready the main holding cell."

I awoke in a way larger cell, with a metal sliding door, locked with a padlock, almost like the kind you would see in a mall, And there was a large, circular bed in the middle of the room, Also an outlet, they didn't take my charger and phone either, But I think it might have gotten a small crack due to the scuffle, nothing severe.

Also, they don't come into my room anymore, and I am fed lumpy piles of meat via a tube, also laced with the gunk that is changing me.

...If I could barely overpower one guard, who knows what they would do if I stopped now?

So I ate.

And I change.

My teeth are getting bigger and sharper, my strength, and body are both growing, I have started to tear holes in my shirt, On the bright side, I have a six-pack now!

...Or is that just my carapace growing over my skin? Can hardly tell with this.

Right now, I lay in my bed typing this out, I may have started to grow a bit too large to use a phone, so I will need to find a different way to communicate with you guys.

But as we speak, I can feel my human traits regressing, and I can feel myself getting hungrier, I'm changing, And I can't stop it.

This isn't about saving my human side anymore, it's about regaining my freedom.

Please help.
