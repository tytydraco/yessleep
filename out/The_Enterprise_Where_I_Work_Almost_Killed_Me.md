I never gave a damn about the monsters in the region, just because I had never seen any of them, even though this is the city with the highest number of occurrences in the world. We're living in a time when these events are becoming common. We don't even know their origin. Their behavior gives nightmares to the greatest specialist in exotic creatures in the world. They don’t follow any pattern, so it’s almost impossible to locate their burrows. I’ve never seen a report from a survivor — almost as if there weren’t any.

That’s why I’m writing this report. This is my story with one of those terrifying creatures.

It was a Monday. Gray clouds were covering the sky, and it was cold. I didn't care. I changed my clothes and started making a cup of coffee to fully wake up. Everything was fine. I put on an overcoat, grabbed my umbrella, suitcase, and lucky fountain pen (it's a long story, which is not important now), and placed my hat on my head. Only then did I head to work.

When I arrived at BioCorps, I immediately noticed that something was off. The building was completely empty, and the air was filled with a horrible smell. Normally, it would be bustling with people at that hour. “Or am I late?” I checked my watch. It was really dark inside of the building, but I could see it was 7 a.m. Some lights were flickering. I looked at a wall. A dark liquid was smeared across it. “Is it…”, I thought, connecting the dots with the smell, “Is it… blood?" I ran through Corridor 13 of Sector A, where my office is located, but before I could enter, I noticed something strange: my supervisor’s door was open.

It was unusual to see Dr. Smith’s door open. He was very reserved with his employees. Over the past month, he’d been showing up to work really messy — hair uncombed, suit wrinkled, and a haunted expression on his face. My natural curiosity overcame my fear. I had to know what was going on.

I stepped inside his office.

“It’s rare to see anyone passing by,” said my colleague and best friend, Walter, who was hiding under the desk and staring at Dr. Smith’s chalkboard. “Good to see you’re alive, Gregory.”Something was off about him. He was unnervingly calm — too calm. I think he was traumatized.

"Walter, are you okay? Are you hurt? I saw blood on the walls, and—" I began, but Walter slowly raised his index finger to his lips, signaling for silence, and pointed behind me.

I felt a chill run through my body as something sniffed the back of my neck. Slowly, I turned around.

That’s when I saw a terrifying pair of eyes. Fuck, I can’t forget those eyes.

They belonged to a giant red-scaled lizard, with shreds of flesh hanging from its bloody jaws. It had threatening wings like a bat. As it sniffed, it exhaled smoke through its nostrils. I could hear it smelling. When it turned its head and saw us, it roared — unleashing a blast of pure fire.

Only then did I realize it was the source of both the smell and the silence. I wanted to scream, to cry, but I was frozen.

“He can hear us,” Walter gestured silently. I was so deceiving I barely noticed I had crouched under the desk beside him.

Then I looked at the chalkboard. Genetic sequences covered it. Tables tracked numbers of “failures” and “successes,” with questions like “wrong sequence?” and “wrong machines?”

But that wasn’t what caught my attention. Repeated over and over again were the words:

“I WOULD HAVE THE NOBEL.”

Horrified, I watched as the creature left the room. After I was certain it was far away, I said:

“We need to get out of here, Walter!”

“What? Are you nuts?” he nearly shouted. “That monster will kill us both if we leave this room! We’re safer here!”

“That’s exactly why we need to get out—”

The creature suddenly appeared.

For a few horrifying moments, the silence nearly killed me. Then, the creature left again.

“‘Secure,’ huh?” I muttered. “Look, if you want to stay, stay. I won’t stop you. But I’m leaving.”

“Good luck,” he said, looking at me.

I nodded back at him.

I ran through all of Sector A until I reached the reception door.

The door to my freedom.

Of course, I had to run to it—but the scaled freak appeared again, stopping me in my tracks. It didn’t move. It just stared at me. Unblinking. Minutes passed.

Then it approached.

Its tail stood erect, its medium-length arms extended toward me. Down the metal corridor, the creature’s low growls echoed. And I, like a complete idiot, just listened—frozen, unreactive.

Then, it started walking.

But the monster’s nose appeared just behind my neck. It opened its mouth, revealing rows of sharp, glistening teeth. At that moment, I had nothing to gain and everything to lose.

I slammed the button.

A blaring, ear-piercing alarm echoed through the corridor, distracting the creature. It worked — the monster turned away, trying to locate the source of the terrible, deafening melody. And that same noise announced something else: it was my chance to escape.

I ran down the corridor with everything I had.

But it saw me.

Those terrible, piercing red eyes locked onto mine and froze me in place. I realized then — this could be the end.

Think about it: would a six-foot-tall man stand a chance in a fight against an eight-foot-tall monster that literally breathes fire?

No? You’re absolutely right.

I was hurled against the wall and blacked out for a few seconds.

When I came to, I felt a deep cut in my abdomen and saw blood smeared on the wall beside me. My lucky fountain pen was lying on the floor. I needed a plan B.

I grabbed the pen, stood up, and ran straight at the monster — despite the excruciating pain in my side. Then, I stabbed his left red-orange eye with the pen. The monster yelled, and threw up a lot of fire. It was struggling from pain, and I lost my pen in the restless head of it.

The next thing I saw was terrifying. I saw the BioCorps's logo tattooed on the creature’s scaled neck.

Now everything makes sense.

It was Dr. Smith to command the creation of the monsters. He was trying to perform the creation of a creature, and he has been creating all of the monsters. That’s why we never saw a burrow of them, just because there isn't. The creatures are created in the labs and they are killed briefly after being born. Dr. Smith failed most of the time, so he went crazy. That’s why he left his door closed, to cover his secrets, and…

BLAM!

I didn't notice its claw, big enough to keep me on the ground. It growled. I was stuck. The creature lifted me with its claw and launched me across the corridor. I blacked out for a minute, I think.

The only eye remaining in the creature’s head looked at me. I knew I was fucked up. I tried to get up with all my strength. No success. My abdomen was severely hurt.

"ARGH", I yelled from pain, "Help!"

The monster approached. 

"Help!"

"Hey, you freak!", it was... Walter? "I bet you taste like chicken!", if you looked at him, you could see he was taken by the fear.

RAAAAR!, the monster turned to Walter, who was holding a curtain holster.

"Walter.", my voice was so weak, and I was bleeding. I was losing consciousness.

The last thing I remember was that they started to fight. Walter was hurled against the wall and the monster started eating his intestines. I heard the sound of sirens from out of the building. After that, darkness.

I woke up in an ambulance. I gasped.

"Help..."

"Hey, hey, calm down.", a paramedic put a inhaler in my face and I went out.

When I woke up again, I was in a hospital room. A medic was administering morphine for me.

"Where... Where is Walter?", I asked.

"Walter?", he didn't understand. 

"The other guy, who was fighting the creature."

The medic's face became dark.

"Huh... The police killed that reptile... We could save you, but the other mas didn't have this luck. We tried to save him, but he was fatally harmed by the creature."

I think I was pale at this moment.

"But, hey...", he tried to smile, "You're alive. This is good news, a survivor of these attacks. Maybe you could help to end this cycle. Do you know the origin of this monster?"

"It was BioCorps.", I said.

His face was dark again.

"What?"

"Biocorps created the monsters. It had the BioCorps's logo on its neck."

The doctor smiled.

"Have some rest. This story is over."

He didn't believe in me. Probably, he thought I was having some hallucination, or PTSD. I don’t know and don’t give a fuck.

This is the truth. The painful truth.

Walter was my best friend. Biocorps, the enterprise where we worked, killed him and gave me scars forever. My supervisor's obsession caused it. Speaking about the devil, he is missing. But, now, I know my mission. I'll find him.

I'll have my revenge.
