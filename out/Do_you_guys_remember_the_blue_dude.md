Hey r/nosleep I was wondering if you guys could help me out a little here. So the other day I was talking to my friends right, and one of them is a big Spongebob fan. Like this motherfucker can name all of the episodes in the first few seasons.

My other friends also have watched a decent amount of Spongebob and the conversation just kind of naturally went there. And eventually it came up that I had never really watched Spongebob as a kid. Yknow and they were all like “why?”.

So I told them that I was always really freaked out by the blue man who shows up in the intro. Yknow the blue silhouette around 30 seconds. I think spongebob is like reassembling himself at that point, it’s been a while since I watched the intro clip tbh. But like broad strokes, blue background, blue man, smile(?) I don’t really remember his face too well.

But yeah that guy would always scare the hell out of me, like it was bad my man. I was a little dude myself right so seeing that blue silhouette pop up for like one or two frames would cause me to goddamn shit myself in fright. Like it was at the point where I would hallucinate this blue asshole standing in the corner of the room when I tried to sleep.

And I mean it’s funny to think about now yknow. Because it was scary to me as a kid for sure, but it was just a blue dude. Actually kinda fuckin funny right. Deeply traumatizing but kind of funny yknow.

And as I was telling them this they looked at me like I was fuckin high yknow. Like it kinda hurt. Not too much but like, still.

When I tried to find the clip on youtube to show them I couldn’t find it so like I am wondering if it was like a prank for an episode or two. Maybe a producer slipped it in to scare some kids or something idk.

But yeah I hear that you guys are good with like knowing about spooky stuff so I was wondering if any of you have seen the blue dude? Please let me know so I can prove to my friends that I am not insane. Gracias!

Edit: Fuck there’s a word requirement. Shit man. That’s what I get for not knowing much about this subreddit I guess lmao. Whatever I am still going to post here, rules be damned! I need answers not bureaucracy.

But like having had more time to think about it I actually saw him a lot as a kid.

Like I’ve seen around 5 or 6 episodes of spongebob and he was in the intro of everyone yknow. 

And like, I mean I am not like prone to hallucinations right, I just had a little kid imagination, but like I hallucinated him a lot back in the day.

I would often see him as I was getting ready to go to bed, peeking his head out of my closet door. I would stare at him and he would stare back, it was some scary shit for a little kid to imagine. And when I hid my head under my blanket I knew that he was above me, waiting for me to peek my head out. I spent entire nights holding my breath under the blanket, praying for the sun to rise again.

Thinking back this really fucked me up as a kid. Like I don’t want to make a big deal out of it and sue, but god damn some closure would be nice. Why would Nickolodeon allow that to air?

AND WHY THE HELL DOES NO ONE ELSE REMEMBER THIS MOTHERFUCKER. I stg that shit has me more fucked up than anything else.

Not even any google search results like what the hell man. I know what I fuckin saw. HE WAS THERE HE WAS THERE HE WAS THERE

Sorry for the small rant there, but yeah once again, if any of you guys have seen the blue dude let me  know.
