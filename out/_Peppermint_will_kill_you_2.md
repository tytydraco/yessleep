The next morning, I woke up to cinnamon footprints leading straight to my porch. They weren’t subtle. They didn’t meander. These things were purposeful, like the cryptid had a GPS.

‍

Now, most people would take this as a sign to leave. I took it as a sign to make pancakes. If cinnamon was going to invade my life, I might as well lean into the theme.

‍

The day passed without incident, but as the sun set, I got that feeling. You know, the one where you’re alone in the woods and start hearing noises that absolutely didn’t exist five minutes ago. This time, it wasn’t clinking. It was crunching. Like boots stomping on fresh snow.

“Great,” I muttered, shoving the last bite of pancake into my mouth. “My cinnamon buddy’s back, and he brought snacks.”

I went to the window and peered out. And there it was. Not Cinnamon Guy, though. This one was new.

‍

Standing just at the edge of the treeline was a creature made entirely of peppermint. Its body was striped red and white, its eyes swirled like those candies you suck on when you’re trying not to cough in public, and it carried a comically large candy cane over its shoulder like a baseball bat.

‍

“Really?” I groaned. “You brought a weapon? What are you, a peppermint mafia enforcer?”

The demon raised the candy cane and pointed it at me. Then, in a voice that sounded like a mix between wind chimes and a sugar rush, it bellowed, “YOU HAVE BEEN SUMMONED.”

I blinked. “Summoned? For what? An elf-on-elf cage match? A gingerbread heist?”

The demon stomped closer, the crunching of snow getting louder with each step. It stopped just short of my porch and announced, “YOU MUST FACE THE JUDGMENT OF THE SWEETS.”

“Judgment?” I shouted back. “Buddy, I’m not even allowed back in the mall’s food court. What makes you think I care about your sugary tribunal?”

This was clearly not the response it expected. The demon hesitated, its peppermint swirls spinning slower. Then, almost awkwardly, it tapped its candy cane bat on the ground and said, “DO YOU... ACCEPT?”

At this point, I was mostly curious. “Accept what? A bake-off? A cavity inspection? Be specific, dude.”

The demon didn’t answer. Instead, it stepped onto my porch, leaving sticky red and white footprints behind. I noticed the candy cane bat up close—it wasn’t even sharp. It looked like the kind you’d buy in a Christmas clearance sale.

So, in a move that was probably the dumbest thing I’ve ever done, I snatched the bat out of its hands. Or... candy limbs.

“Let’s make this fair,” I said. Then I turned around, walked inside, and came back with a broom. I handed it to the demon like we were about to duel in a parking lot.

“Okay, Peppermint Pal,” I said, holding the candy cane bat like a baseball player ready to hit a home run. “You want judgment? Batter up.”

What happened next is a bit of a blur. Let’s just say I learned two things that night:

1. Peppermint Demons are surprisingly bad at hand-to-hand combat.
2. My backswing is *fantastic*.

‍

By the end of it, the demon was in pieces—literally. Its legs were over by the porch steps, its torso was stuck in a snowbank, and its head was rolling gently toward the treeline like the world’s worst Christmas ornament.

I leaned on the candy cane bat, panting, and looked down at the disassembled demon. “Judgment served,” I muttered.

And then it spoke. Just the head. Its swirly eyes spun one last time as it rasped, “THIS IS NOT OVER. THE SWEETS WILL RISE.”

I picked up the head, tossed it into the snow, and shouted, “Tell the Sweets to bring cookies next time!”

‍

As I walked back inside, I realized two things. One, I now owned a candy cane bat. And two, I probably should’ve saved the demon’s head for evidence.

Oh well. At least I had pancakes.
