\---

I took one step outside my door and shrieked. A man was knelt, bent at the waist with his legs tucked under him, his hands flat on the ground. As he rose to his knees, I realized it was Eli.

"Jesus Christ, Eli," I laughed, "you scared the shit out of me."

He looked exhausted. I'd never seen him looking so earnest before, and when he didn't smirk and respond 'You can just call me Eli' like normal, I started to get nervous.

"I'm sorry, Piper."

"Ah, it's okay. What for?" Eli was the smuggest, most secretive person I knew. For him to be kneeling to me, I was sure he'd promised my life away or something.

"I never thought Moira would do something like this. I put you in real danger. I've already dealt with her."

Ah. I'd done a job for Eli recently, looking into a rat in the infrastructure of Evans Arcade, a gaming center in our town. The owner, Moira, had stuffed me in some kind of misery box when I'd returned for something she'd [taken from me](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/zkrm0e/i_do_it_for_the_supernatural_this_is_why_you/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).

I'd escaped, but I'd gotten the implication that I wasn't supposed to. Monica, a...witch(?) that I'd done [some work for](https://www.reddit.com/r/foxtales/comments/zhhexr/i_do_it_for_the_supernatural_today_i_loaned_out_a/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) another time had saved me, yanking me out of the box. In my line of work, as long as I survive, it's hard to hold grudges.

Plus, Eli had put me in worse situations than that, so I was confused as to why this time was so different. At the end of the day, I was the one who agreed to work with him, so my skin was my own business.

I awkwardly patted his shoulder, grabbing his elbow to help him to his feet. Seeing him in this position was weird, I wanted him to go back to his snarky self.

"I'll put it on your tab," I grinned, hoping to spark a bicker.

He just sighed.

"Dude, you're kind of freaking me out," I told him.

"You're on the radar now. I had hoped to keep you off of it for at least a bit."

I laughed.

"Is that all? Dude, [Keith](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/za4iq5/i_do_tech_support_for_the_supernatutural_today_i/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) has been texting me stock suggestions ever since I set up his new computer for him. I think he's in love with me," I wiggled my eyebrows goofily, "You think I should take him up on it? He is loaded, I'd probably be better off with him than you. Although, my dry cleaning bills would go through the roof," I finished, tapping my finger on my chin in mock contemplation.

I would very much like to be a stone wall, but I just couldn't deal with the heartbroken look on his face.

"I promise, dude. I'm okay. Besides, Monica is the one you should be talking to. She's the one who dragged me out of there."

He flinched at that.

"Monica?" he asked, one brow lifted.

"Yeah, the woman from Sparks? The building with the hard 6pm curfew?"

I shuddered remembering how the building had simply shifted out of existence, having hauled my ass out of there in the nick of time.

"Ah," he said, rubbing his chin with his hand, "What does she look like?"

"Ah, tall, pink nails, black hair. Very slick. Mommy vibes," I grinned at him, glad he was back to his conniving self.

"I see."

With this, he spun on a heel and strode away, his hands in his pockets.

"Ah, okay, nice to see you, I guess," I said to his retreating back.

After returning from buying delicious food with almost no nutritional value, I plopped on the couch and turned on the TV to find something to watch while eating. Content absorbed while eating is of the utmost importance.

Before I could find something, though, my phone dinged and I fished it out of my pocket to find a text from Eli.

*Urgent case, please report immediately. Find address enclosed.*

I grumbled. He was just here and he couldn't just tell me in person? He probably didn't want to deal with my many questions in person, thinking in his guilt he would reveal, oh I don't know, anything at all.

After scarfing down my tacos, I changed into a neutral colored outfit and slung my bag over my shoulder, glad I kept it packed for these exact situations.

The client turned out to be Mona's Flower Boutique. I figured it would be a printer issue, or maybe a wifi slowness. I wasn't sure what else a flower shop would need computers for.

I felt a little lift in spirit as I walked in, the beautiful smells and sights filling me with serenity.

There were pastel rainbows of Hydrangeas, dazzling yellow sunflowers, and the soothing muted tones of Peonies and tulips.

I wandered up to one of the rows of sweet pink roses, leaning in to get a hearty whiff of light aroma.

"Rose petals used to be used in confetti, praised for their elegance and delicacy."

"Oh!" I exclaimed. I hadn't heard her come up behind me, she seemed to materialize, a short, beautiful woman with whiskey eyes and waifish brunette hair. She had her hands clasped in front of her, and I noticed a variety of dainty pink rings adorning her delicate fingers.

"Hi," I couldn't help but smile at her sunny disposition, "I'm called Piper. Eli sent me to help with a tech issue?"

"I am called Iris. I run Mona's with my sisters, Bunny and Melody."

"Oh, cool!" I responded, "So who's Mona then?"

"Mona is our grandmother. She left us this shop about 10 years ago and we've been fulfilling her legacy ever since."

Her smile was truly dazzling. I know I talk about women a lot in these retellings, but I'm into men, too, I swear. I just happen to be running into a huge amount of stunning women these days. Not the worst problem to have.

"Well, it looks like you guys are doing a great job, it's magical in here," I cleared my throat, "So, how can I help?"

"This way."

She led me back through the staff door, into a hallway decorated in jewel tones, pearl and emerald hues shining from the art and the furniture.

We wound up in a break room decorated in the same fashion, and she nodded towards an apricot colored couch.

"Tea?" she asked.

"Ah, my palette is closer to that of a 6 year old," I laughed, "I'm okay."

Her eyes sparkled, and she lowered her chin.

"You're cute, do you know that?" she asked.

I assume I flushed beet red from how hot my face got.

"How about hot chocolate?" she asked, swinging open a cupboard and retrieving two mugs.

I perked up like the 6 year old I just claimed to be.

"I'd take a hot chocolate," I smiled. I assumed this was like some sort of ritual or custom, so I didn't want to offend her. Plus, she had just called me cute and half of my brain cells were otherwise occupied.

I swear to god my weakness for cute women is going to kill me.

I woke up completely immobile. I was in some sort of metal trap, all four limbs held tightly in place. I was standing in the human shaped cage, suspended over a marble table topped with a pristine piece of parchment and a fancy looking plume in an ink bottle.

"Don't worry, sweetheart. This won't hurt."

I swiveled my head around sluggishly, trying to get a look at my kidnappers. They didn't seem to be trying to hide. There were once again three women in front of me.

"Charmed?" I mumbled, almost too groggy to see straight.

The tallest one laughed. She had snow white hair and blood red lips. A heavy scar decorated her temple, streaking it's way down her left cheek.

A dark-haired woman to her left gazed up at me with affection, and my muddled brain recognized Iris, the woman who had clearly drugged me. And to the left of her was a redhead, in a blue summer dress. This one held a dagger, long and wicked.

She strode up to me and took my hand gently in hers through the bars. She nicked my finger, letting the blood drip unceremoniously onto the parchment. They were right, though, I felt no pain.

I jerked upright from bed, clutching my chest. I was in my childhood bedroom, the walls decorated with anime posters and my own artwork.

As my heartbeat slowed down, I tried to shake off the weirdest dream ever. I looked over to the mirror on my dresser, taking in my shock of pink hair and slept in makeup.

Wait, I thought, a wave of dizziness hitting me. Didn't my parents sell this house? They live in...Wisconsin, now? A pang of pain streaked through my head and I dropped it into my hands, when I heard a shrill scream.

I leapt out of bed, tripping over my discarded dress on the floor before sprinting into the next room where the screams were still ripping from.

I froze. The information in my brain was all mixed up, giving me double vision. I tried to take in what was happening in front of me.

My parents, my aunts and uncles. My best friends from high school. My two cousins, one of which had been dead by now, all of them screaming my name.

Even had I not been scared shitless, I couldn't have moved. I felt every muscle in my body seize up. My muscles constricted painfully, closing in on my lungs, and I didn't take a breath until it was over, collapsing to my hands and knees.

For minutes, I stood there stricken, as giant forms in brown hooded cloaks ripped everyone I loved to shreds. They'd pull off fingers, break ankles, slice torsos until fat cased sausages and organs slid all over the linoleum floor.

I felt the need to throw up several times, but simply stood, locked in horror. I couldn't even move my hands to cover my mouth or clutch my chest, I felt like I was vibrating with panic.

It felt like an hour that I stood there, watching everyone I'd ever loved be tortured to death. They weren't spared any pain, death was a mercy only given once the bloody bag of flesh under them could no longer be called a human being.

Nathan, a kid I'd looked after for a few hours, blinked in and was torn to shreds by the closest three hooded men. He screamed my name, tears streaking down his face as he tried to suck in precious oxygen.

Once he was quiet, once everyone was quiet, the beings turned towards me and I almost laughed.

They all had my face. How cliche, my frozen brain spat out bitterly.

As I fell to my hands and knees, a screaming sob finally escaping my lips, I seemed to melt through the floor. I felt the hard linoleum give way like a softening pile of mud, and I slipped through.

I landed somewhere almost more familiar than my childhood bedroom. It was a basic child's bedroom from the 90's, I'd guess. I'd spent a month here inside the torture cube that Moira had put me in. I giggled maniacally, shockily wondering which one of these was worse to be stuck in. At least here, the nightmares were only at night.

But before I could even drag myself up from the floor, I felt the floor become that familiar mud sensation. I slipped through once more into what looked like a small bathroom.

I looked around, trying to get my bearings, and my heart dropped. I knew where I was. I was in my old apartment. An apartment I'd shared with a girl named Beatrice.

I couldn't bring myself to look over, but after a moment, my head turned without my consent. I lost control of my body and simply watched in dread.

Beatrice leaned over the tub, her head leaned on her shoulder.

"Pipes. You always make me feel better. I'm feeling a lot better. Would you please go get me some orange chicken? You know it's the only thing that charges me back up," her smile was so sweet, so sad.

She's lying! I screamed at myself. Don't go, you worthless piece of shit, just stay with her, just don't leave!

But I felt myself rise, despite putting every ounce of willpower into staying seated.

"Of course, Bea! I'll be right back."

Tears poured out, I couldn't breathe. My throat was raw from the screams it wouldn't let me release.

"Please, please, please, please. I can't do this again. Please don't make me do this," I sobbed.

Pleas leaked from my lips, heard apparently only by me. Beatrice didn't react, simply stayed perched on the tub, looking at me as though all were right with the world.

I walked out the door and right back into the bathroom, except this time covered in blood.

It wasn't like this the first time. The first time, she'd slit her wrists deep and there was a lot of blood, but it was all in the tub. It wasn't sprayed on the walls, all over the toilet, macabre decorations on the mirror.

I just sighed, my breath catching, staring at her porcelain body lifelessly folded in the tub.

"Why are you doing this to me?" I pleaded limply. I could already feel the mud on the floor and wondered how many levels I was going to sink through.

Was this hell? Was hell just reliving all the worst parts of your life over and over again? How many times had I gone through this cycle? Maybe I was having my memory wiped each time, sentenced to eternal misery and terror. How would I even know? Time was a joke of a memory here.

I slid through the muck and landed in the backseat of an SUV.

I looked over at my cousin, Tiara. I knew what was coming now, I'd bartered for this particular memory back, I thought bitterly. Maybe if I'd just left it alone, I wouldn't be here.

Leona, my other cousin, sat to my right, munching on cheddar popcorn we'd bought at the zoo.

"Hey, Piper?" she asked, swinging her bright brown eyes in my direction.

"Yes?" I asked against my will, through gritted teeth.

She didn't seem to notice.

"If you really are non-binary, does that mean you don't like dudes?"

I flinched, even back then. My aunt didn't know, and for good reason.

"Oh, I don't even know if I am-" I started, tears streaming down my cheeks. I wasn't crying back then, but if I'd known what I know now, I would have been.

"Oh my fucking god, Piper," my aunt slurred, snapping her head around to aim that glare at me.

"Aunt Claire, please watch the road," I begged.

"Don't interrupt me, you ingrate. Non-binary. Everyone has to feel special nowadays, don't they? It's not good enough to just be a man or a woman like God made you."

As she spoke, she swerved all over the road, narrowly missing a fire hydrant and a cyclist.

"Aunt Claire, please, I'm sorry, I'm not-"

I was cut short by a screaming blast, that I would later find out was my aunt running a red light and smashing into the side of a semi-truck.

Tiara didn't make it out, and Leona has never been the same. She thinks it's her fault, and nothing I've said has been able to dissuade her. She also broke her arm in the accident, losing a scholarship to a private school. It's a giant crack in my timeline, separating the moment hope was sucked out of my life.

As I lolled in pain, waiting for the next nightmare scenario to suck me down into it, Tiara's bloody face filled my view.

"Why couldn't you just be normal, Piper? I'd still be here. Leona wouldn't be so alone right now. What's wrong with you?"

I just kept repeating, "I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm so sorry."

I awoke back in the metal cage, sobbing. As I came back to myself, I noticed hands on my face and looked up to find Iris holding my face, and to my surprise, also sobbing.

She unlocked the cage with shaking hands, letting my body slump into her arms.

"I'm so sorry," she parroted at me.

I was inclined to believe her because she had tears streaking down her face, and I could feel her trembling as she held my face to the crook of her neck.

I couldn't stop shaking, gazing up at the two other women in the room. The white-haired woman looked furious, hands clenched at the end of her arms. The red-haired woman looked resigned but gazed at me with sympathy, her arms crossed across her chest.

Iris pulled back and stroked my face, but I was feeling sushi raw, so I pulled back, trying to wipe the mess from my face with my sleeves.

"I don't even want to know," I said shakily, trying to shove my way to my feet. I was going to fucking kill Eli. He apologizes for putting me in danger and then sends me to the lion den? I swore as my knees buckled and I ended up flat on my ass again.

"Oh, but you need to. Listen, I-I can't give you the name of the person who did this to you. It's in our contract. But we put a loophole in for this exact situation. This is the number of the person who ordered the SlamScroll for you. Please believe me, we'll be dealing with them as well, but you deserve to know. They'll be blacklisted in the Fae community."

I was exhausted, I felt like I'd been clenching every muscle for a day and a half. But my curiosity got the better of me, so I took the number.

"Okay. What's a SlamScroll?"

"It's a fantasy package," the redhead said softly.

"Or it's supposed to be," said the blonde, "You may call me Melody. This is my sister, Bunny. We run a service that provides a taste of the users wildest fantasy," she hesitated, "Friends will often request this service, but we only permit those approved by the council to request on behalf of another. Whoever requested your package must have cheated the system somehow. Be sure, we will discover and punish the culprit. Nobody uses Mona's as their own personal torture chamber."

Her eyes were cool but I felt red-hot power emanating from her. I was glad I wasn't on the receiving end of it.

"I swear I checked the scroll," Bunny said apologetically, "It must have been powerful magic to switch the package from Mystic Fantasy to The Devil's Gambit without me noticing."

"Oh," she continued at my puzzled look, "The devil's Gambit package is the trifecta. Fear, Despair," her look gentled and she squatted to my eye level, tucking a piece of hair behind my ear, "and shame."

"I know it wasn't my fault," I spat bitterly in response to their pitying looks.

"Do you?" Melody asked, staring at me intently.

I struggled to my feet, swatting away their worrying hands.

"I got it, you've done enough."

Iris teared up again, looking like I struck her.

I sighed, "It's not your fault, Iris. I'm sorry. I just feel like shit. I'm sure I'll feel better after I make a call."

I crumpled the number in my fist.

Eli was going to have to do more than kneel [this time](https://www.reddit.com/r/foxtales/).
