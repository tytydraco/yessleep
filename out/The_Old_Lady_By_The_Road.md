My name is Maria, i am a college student from Colorado, i had planned a road trip with my friend Jess, this is what happened on that road trip…

The road trip had been my idea. Jess had just come out of a messy breakup, and I was drowning in assignments. We needed a break—something far enough from campus to feel like an escape. So, a three-day drive through the mountains, with plans to stay at a friend’s cabin by the coast, sounded perfect. I had everything planned down to the playlists and coffee stops. We left campus at dawn, the sun barely peeking over the horizon as we drove out of town.

The first few hours were bliss. We laughed about the lousy food on campus, ranted about professors who loved to pile on work, and blasted music from our high school days. The air was fresh, the sky a clear, sharp blue, and we had no clue what was coming. Looking back, I almost envy how naive we were then.

As the afternoon dragged on, the landscape around us grew more remote. The trees became denser, towering and twisted, leaning over the road like they were trying to close in around us. Jess had dozed off in the passenger seat, her face pressed against the window, her breathing soft and even. I was getting a little sleepy myself, lulled by the rhythmic sound of tires against pavement. But then I noticed something strange.

Ahead, just off the side of the road, a figure stood motionless by the trees. As we drew closer, I realized it was an old woman. She wore a long, faded dress and a tattered scarf wrapped tightly around her head, hiding most of her face. Her posture was unnaturally stiff, her arms hanging limply at her sides as she stood perfectly still, her eyes fixed on the road.

Something about her felt… wrong. My instincts prickled, the hair on the back of my neck standing up. I tried to shake it off, telling myself it was just the sight of someone in such an isolated area, but a weird feeling had settled in my stomach.

We drove past her slowly, and I couldn’t help but glance back in the rearview mirror. She hadn’t moved, hadn’t turned her head—just stayed there, watching us disappear down the road.

I didn’t wake Jess. I kept driving, brushing off the encounter as some eerie coincidence. Maybe she was a local, waiting for someone, or just… lost. But as the minutes passed, I couldn’t shake the image of her still figure, standing so perfectly still, as though she’d been carved out of stone.

The road stretched on, winding through a seemingly endless forest. The trees grew closer together, casting heavy shadows across the pavement. It felt like we’d been driving for hours, but when I checked the GPS, our location barely seemed to have changed. The blue dot was creeping along at a snail’s pace, and our arrival time was now an hour later than I’d estimated. I checked the clock, frowning. Had we been driving that slowly?

Jess finally stirred beside me, stretching and blinking herself awake. She looked out the window, squinting at the dense forest around us.

"Are we almost there?" she asked, stifling a yawn.

"Not quite," I said, trying to keep my voice casual. "We’re making slower progress than I thought."

She shrugged, turning to gaze out the window, but a look of unease settled on her face as she took in the unfamiliar landscape. The mood in the car shifted, the easygoing vibe from earlier replaced with something tense and uneasy. We sat in silence for a while, the only sound the hum of the engine and the low buzz of static from the radio.

That’s when I saw her again.

I almost missed her, half-hidden by a cluster of trees just ahead. But there she was, the same old woman, standing by the roadside in that faded dress and scarf. Her posture was identical, her arms at her sides, her eyes locked on us. My heart pounded as we drove past, and this time Jess saw her too.

“Whoa… Did you see her?” Jess asked, her voice low and wary. “Isn’t that… the same woman?”

I nodded, gripping the steering wheel tighter. “Yeah. I thought it was just me.”

Jess leaned back, chewing her lip. “How would she get here? There’s no town for miles.”

I didn’t have an answer, and I didn’t want to speculate. The uneasy feeling in my gut had turned into something heavier, a creeping dread that I couldn’t ignore. But as unsettling as it was, I tried to tell myself that there was some reasonable explanation. Maybe she had a car parked nearby, or a house hidden in the woods. Maybe we were just imagining things.

But as we drove on, I couldn’t shake the feeling that we were being watched, that somehow, her gaze had followed us long after we’d passed her by.

Night began to fall, the trees casting long, dark shadows across the road. The headlights seemed to barely pierce the thickening darkness, and the silence around us grew almost oppressive. I tried turning on the radio, but only static crackled through the speakers. Even my phone had no signal, the bars stubbornly refusing to budge.

We drove in silence, both of us on edge, the tension thickening with every passing mile. Finally, Jess spoke up, her voice barely more than a whisper.

"Do you… feel like we’re being followed?"

I glanced at her, and for a moment, I considered laughing it off. But the fear in her eyes mirrored my own, and I couldn’t deny it any longer.

"Yeah," I admitted, my voice barely steady. "I feel it too."

We kept driving, the silence between us stretching taut, both of us too scared to say anything more. As night fully fell, we passed no other cars, no houses, no signs of life—just an unbroken wall of trees pressing in on either side. The road felt endless, stretching out in front of us like it went on forever, leading us deeper and deeper into the darkness.

Finally, after what felt like hours, a dim light appeared in the distance—a small, flickering neon sign on the roof of a rundown motel. Relief flooded through me as I pulled into the gravel lot, the headlights illuminating the faded, peeling paint and grimy windows.

Jess and I hurried inside, booking a room without a second glance at the front desk. The clerk, a wiry man with sunken eyes, barely looked up as he handed us the keys, his gaze fixed somewhere behind us, as though he’d seen something lurking just beyond the glass doors.

The room was sparse and cold, the walls yellowed and cracked. Jess locked the door behind us, checking the window to make sure it was secure. Neither of us spoke about what we’d seen on the road, but the tension was palpable, a silent understanding that we’d experienced something we couldn’t explain.

As I lay in bed, staring up at the cracked ceiling, I couldn’t shake the image of her—the old woman, standing by the roadside, watching us with that blank, empty stare. I felt her presence lingering in the back of my mind, like a shadow that wouldn’t fade. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw her face, obscured by the scarf, her gaze piercing through the darkness.

Hours passed, but sleep wouldn’t come. And in the silence of that tiny, dilapidated motel room, I could have sworn I heard footsteps outside the door. Slow, shuffling steps, moving back and forth, as though someone was pacing, waiting for something—or someone.

I didn’t dare move, didn’t dare look. I lay frozen in bed, listening to the quiet, steady footsteps until they faded into the night, leaving me lying there, wide-eyed and trembling, waiting for dawn to come.

I woke up early, my body stiff and tense. I couldn’t shake the feeling of being watched, even as sunlight crept through the thin, yellowed curtains of our motel room. I sat up, trying to push away the fog of sleeplessness and to brush off the memory of that woman standing by the road. But when I looked over at Jess, her face was pale, her eyes red-rimmed from a restless night, and I knew she’d felt it too.

We packed up in silence, trying to shake off the strange heaviness that lingered from the day before. After a quick stop for coffee, we got back on the road, hoping that a few hours of clear driving would lift the tension that seemed to follow us. But when Jess plugged in the GPS, a chill went down my spine. The screen blinked a few times, showing the same route from yesterday.

"Are you sure that’s the right way?" I asked, trying to keep my voice steady. Jess frowned, tapping at the screen.

"Yeah… I mean, I think so," she said, glancing at the map. "It’s weird, though. It’s like the same road… even though I swear I picked a different route today."

I laughed nervously. “Maybe it’s just a bad signal.”

She nodded, but her eyes didn’t leave the screen. I could tell she was just as uneasy as I was. Finally, she shrugged, trying to sound casual. “Whatever. Let’s just get going.”

We pulled out of the motel lot and started driving, the road stretching out in front of us in a long, unbroken line. The forest seemed darker than yesterday, the trees pressing in on either side of us, their twisted branches reaching across the road like bony fingers. Shadows pooled under the thick canopy, and every now and then, I’d catch a glimpse of something moving at the edge of my vision—just a flicker, gone before I could turn my head to see it clearly.

After an hour or so, Jess turned to me, her face pale. “Is it just me, or does it feel like… like we’re not getting anywhere?”

I checked the clock, frowning. We’d been driving for well over an hour, but the GPS showed only a few miles of progress. I double-checked the fuel gauge. We had plenty of gas, and there was no reason we should be moving this slowly.

“It’s like… the road’s stretching out,” I murmured, trying to make sense of it. But my words hung in the air, unanswered, because how do you explain something like that?

The radio crackled with static, and I turned it off, unwilling to break the tense silence that had settled between us. We drove on, mile after mile, the road twisting through the endless forest like a coiled snake. The sun had barely moved in the sky, stuck in that eerie, pre-noon brightness, casting long shadows that seemed to follow us.

And then we saw her again.

The old woman stood by the side of the road, in the exact same spot as yesterday. She was dressed the same way, her faded dress and frayed scarf stirring in the faint breeze. This time, though, her posture was different—more alert, more… attentive. She stood with one hand raised, palm out, as though signaling us to stop.

My heart pounded in my chest, and I felt Jess’s hand grip my arm, her fingers cold and tight. “No… No way,” she whispered, her voice barely audible. “How is she here? She can’t… she can’t be here.”

I forced myself to keep driving, but I couldn’t tear my eyes away from the rearview mirror. The woman’s face was still obscured by the scarf, but I could feel her eyes on us, following us even as we passed her by. The skin on the back of my neck prickled, and a cold shiver ran down my spine as we left her behind.

Neither of us spoke for a long time after that. Jess sat with her knees drawn up, her arms wrapped tightly around herself as though trying to ward off a chill. I kept my eyes on the road, refusing to look back, afraid of what I might see.

After another hour of silent driving, the road finally seemed to open up a bit. I felt a strange sense of relief, like we’d escaped something that had been closing in on us. We hadn’t seen any signs of life—not a single car, house, or gas station—since leaving the motel, but finally, a small, weathered sign appeared on the side of the road: “Gas, 10 miles.”

I sped up, eager to reach some sign of civilization, even if it was just a rundown gas station in the middle of nowhere.

When we finally reached it, I pulled in, the tires crunching on the gravel as I parked by one of the ancient-looking pumps. The place was eerily quiet, and a sense of unease washed over me as I climbed out of the car. I glanced around, but the station seemed deserted. The windows were covered in grime, and the only sound was the faint, shivering wind rustling through the trees.

Jess stayed in the car, staring at the dashboard as though afraid to look up. I could feel her anxiety from where I stood, but I didn’t blame her. I was barely keeping it together myself.

As I filled the tank, a figure appeared in the doorway of the gas station. I jumped, almost spilling gas on the ground. It was a man, his face obscured by the shadow of his hat, his clothes worn and stained. He watched me for a moment, then stepped out onto the porch, his movements slow and deliberate.

“Headed somewhere?” he asked, his voice rough and low, barely audible over the wind.

I nodded, forcing a smile. “Yeah… just passing through.”

He tilted his head, his eyes narrowing slightly as he looked me over. “Be careful out there. Roads don’t always lead where you think they do.”

I felt a chill at his words, but I didn’t know how to respond. He watched me in silence for a moment, then turned and disappeared back into the shadows of the gas station. I hurried back to the car, my heart pounding as I slid into the driver’s seat.

Jess looked at me, her eyes wide. “Did he… did he say anything to you?”

I shook my head, lying without really knowing why. “Nothing important. Let’s just go.”

We drove in silence, both of us on edge, the tension between us thick and oppressive. The road stretched out in front of us, twisting and turning through the endless forest. Every mile felt like a lifetime, and the shadows around us grew darker, thicker, as though something was closing in.

I don’t know how long we drove—time felt meaningless, slipping away in the endless monotony of the road. But as evening began to fall, the light fading into a murky twilight, I saw something ahead that made my heart stop.

The old woman.

She was standing in the same spot as before, her back straight, her gaze fixed on us. Her hand was raised again, palm out, as though warning us to stop. This time, though, her face was turned directly toward us, and I could finally see her eyes.

They were pale and empty, like glass, staring into me with a cold intensity that made my blood run cold. I looked away, unable to hold her gaze, and kept driving, my hands shaking on the wheel.

As we passed her, Jess grabbed my arm, her voice tight with fear. “Stop. Just stop the car.”

I didn’t want to, every instinct telling me to keep going, to leave her behind and never look back. But something in Jess’s voice—the sheer terror—made me pull over to the side of the road, my hands white-knuckling the wheel as I forced myself to breathe.

We sat there in silence, neither of us moving, both of us staring straight ahead, too afraid to look back. The air was thick, suffocating, as though the forest around us was closing in.

Finally, Jess broke the silence, her voice barely more than a whisper. “What… what does she want from us?”

I didn’t have an answer. All I knew was that we were trapped on this road, caught in some nightmare that refused to end. The woman was a constant, a silent watcher, appearing at every turn, always waiting, always watching.

As darkness fell, the shadows grew deeper, swallowing the road and everything around us. I started the car again, my hands shaking, and drove on, the headlights barely piercing the darkness.

But as we left her behind, I couldn’t shake the feeling that she was still there, her empty eyes fixed on us, following us into the night.

 

I woke up feeling more drained than I had on any morning before. The room was dim, the curtains drawn tight against a sun that barely seemed to rise, casting only a weak, grayish light through the cracks. Jess was still asleep, her face tense even in slumber, and for a brief moment, I considered not waking her at all. Maybe she’d be better off staying in bed, far from whatever waited for us on the road.

But as much as I wanted to believe we could simply turn back, a sick, crawling feeling told me that no matter which direction we drove, we would end up on the same road—stuck in some terrible loop that we hadn’t meant to enter.

With a heavy heart, I roused Jess, and we packed up in silence. She avoided my gaze, her lips pressed into a thin, tight line. It felt like we were going to our own funeral.

After a quick, silent breakfast, we loaded up the car and set out. The world outside seemed grayer, the trees bare and twisted, as though drained of life. I felt a cold dread seep into my bones as we pulled back onto the road. The GPS flickered, blinking uncertainly for a moment before settling back onto the same route—the road that had held us captive for two days. I barely felt surprised; I knew by now there was no escape.

Jess sat beside me, her arms crossed tightly over her chest, her eyes fixed on the road ahead. Neither of us spoke as we drove through the thickening mist, the forest around us looming like a dark, shadowy tunnel, closing in on us as we went.

Hours passed, but the landscape never changed. The trees all looked the same, stretching endlessly on either side, their branches twisted and gnarled. The silence in the car was deafening, pressing in on us, as though the very air had thickened. Every now and then, I’d catch a movement out of the corner of my eye, a flicker in the trees that vanished as soon as I turned my head.

And then, around midday, we saw her again.

The old woman was standing by the roadside, her figure barely visible through the thick fog that had settled over the road. She wore the same faded dress, the same frayed scarf, but something about her was different. Her posture was more rigid, her head tilted slightly to one side, as though she were waiting for us.

I felt Jess’s grip on my arm tighten, her nails digging into my skin. “Don’t stop,” she whispered, her voice barely audible. “Just keep driving. Please.”

But as we drew closer, I felt an overwhelming urge to stop. It was like some invisible force was tugging at me, urging me to pull over, to get out of the car and walk toward her. My foot hovered over the brake, my hands tightening on the wheel as I struggled to resist.

“She’s just… there,” I said, more to myself than to Jess, my voice hollow. “She’s just… waiting.”

The woman raised her hand, her pale, bony fingers outstretched, beckoning us forward. Her eyes, cold and empty, fixed on me with a piercing intensity that made my skin crawl.

Jess’s voice shook. “Just go, please… don’t look at her. Just go.”

I forced myself to keep driving, my eyes locked on the road ahead, refusing to look back. I could feel her gaze on us, though—burning into the back of my head as we passed her by. It was like a weight, pressing down on me, growing heavier and heavier until I could barely breathe.

Minutes stretched into hours, and still, we drove. The road seemed endless, a looping, unchanging nightmare that refused to release us. The forest grew darker, the fog thickening until I could barely see a few feet in front of us. Shadows seemed to dance in the corners of my vision, and every time I glanced at the GPS, it showed the same unchanging coordinates.

Jess was silent, her face pale, her eyes glazed over with fear. I felt a strange sense of detachment, like I was watching everything from a distance, my mind slipping further and further away from reality.

And then, just as the sun was beginning to set, the car began to sputter.

I looked down, panic rising in my chest as the fuel gauge dipped suddenly, the needle plunging toward empty. My foot pressed harder on the gas, but the engine choked and sputtered, slowing down until the car rolled to a stop.

“No,” I whispered, my heart pounding. “This can’t be happening. We just filled up this morning. We can’t be out of gas.”

But the car was dead, the engine silent and unresponsive. I looked at Jess, panic clawing at my chest. She was staring out the window, her face frozen in terror.

“She’s here,” Jess whispered, her voice barely audible. “She’s coming.”

I looked up, and my heart dropped into my stomach.

The old woman was standing in the middle of the road, just a few feet away, her figure barely visible through the fog. Her hand was raised, beckoning us forward, her eyes fixed on me with an unblinking stare.

I felt a chill seep into my bones, freezing me in place. I wanted to move, to get out of the car and run, but I couldn’t. It was like I was rooted to the spot, trapped by her gaze.

Jess grabbed my arm, her voice shaking. “Don’t go… please, don’t go.”

But something inside me was pulling me forward, an irresistible force that I couldn’t ignore. I opened the car door, stepping out into the cold, damp air. The fog clung to my skin, thick and suffocating, as I took a step toward her.

The woman turned and began to walk into the trees, her figure disappearing into the mist. Without thinking, I followed, my legs moving of their own accord, my mind a hazy blur. Jess’s voice faded behind me, her pleas lost in the fog as I followed the woman into the darkness.

She led me deeper into the forest, her footsteps silent on the moss-covered ground. The trees closed in around us, their twisted branches reaching down like skeletal hands, brushing against my skin as I walked. I could hear whispers in the shadows, faint voices murmuring just out of reach, but I couldn’t make out what they were saying.

Finally, we emerged into a small clearing, and I stopped, my breath catching in my throat.

There was a house in the middle of the clearing, a dilapidated, crumbling structure that looked like it had been abandoned for decades. The windows were shattered, the walls covered in moss and ivy, and the door hung crookedly on its hinges. But the woman walked up to the door, turning to look at me with that same, unblinking stare.

“Come inside,” she said, her voice a raspy whisper that sent a shiver down my spine.

I hesitated, every instinct screaming at me to run, to turn back and find Jess. But something held me in place, a strange, overpowering compulsion that I couldn’t resist. I took a step forward, then another, until I was standing on the threshold, staring into the dark, empty interior.

The woman gestured for me to enter, her face obscured in the shadows. I took a deep breath, stepping over the threshold and into the darkness.

Inside, the air was thick and stale, the walls covered in dust and cobwebs. The floor creaked beneath my feet, and I could barely see anything in the dim light. I turned to look at the woman, but she was gone, vanished into the shadows.

A cold dread settled over me as I realized I was alone.

I tried to back out, but the door had disappeared, the walls around me shifting and warping until I couldn’t tell where I’d entered. Panic surged in my chest, and I stumbled through the dark, my hands brushing against cold, damp walls that seemed to close in around me.

And then I heard it—the faint sound of footsteps, slow and deliberate, echoing through the darkness. I froze, my heart pounding in my chest as the footsteps grew closer, closer, until they were right behind me.

I turned, my breath hitching as I saw her standing in the shadows, her empty eyes fixed on me, her face twisted into a cold, cruel smile.

“You shouldn’t have come here,” she whispered, her voice echoing through the empty house. “You don’t belong here.”

The world around me began to blur, the walls twisting and melting until I was surrounded by darkness. The last thing I saw was her face, looming over me, her eyes cold and empty, pulling me into the shadows.

And then, everything went [black](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIXrbqKdBs).
