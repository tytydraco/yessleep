So, a lot of important stuff has happened.

Sorry about the complete lack of posting, I (Ollie) have just been bumming around and being a lazy fuck the last few days. I moved into a new house, so I'm dealing with that.

And one more thing; I lied a bit in the previous post. This isn't the final part. However, the next one will be. Life stuff makes it difficult to write but I'm sure what's in this part will suffice for the next few days.

Part Eight coming soon, hopefully.

Before I tell you about the events that transpired from the days of July Eighth to July Twelfth.

Hey, it’s Clyde. We got a radio for the store because it’s kind of boring just working in silence all day. Oh, yeah, apparently Ollie came in earlier this morning and the walls were made of pulsating flesh speaking German, so there’s that.

Anyways, our phones have been acting really weird lately, so the radio actually proved to be a good idea. All I see when I open up my phone is a countdown for the next 3 days.

I was allowed to have the radio playing while I worked. The signal unfortunately didn’t go far enough to reach any quality stations, so we were stuck with Fallscean Radio.

The station was run by Robert Reilly, a local radio host. It played music from the 80’s to the 2020’s, so I had a lot to listen to.

Robert’s “80’s throwback hour” had just ended. This bummed me out because he played some really good music. He ended the session with a message.

“Well, I hope you folks enjoyed that. Thanks for letting bless the rains down in Fallscean, ha—ha! Now, let’s see… Clyde? Did you enjoy it?”

What the hell? He talked directly to me. I had to figure out what was going on.

“A—are you talkin’ to me, man?”

“Must be real boring sitting at that register all day. You HAVE to have better things to do, man.”

Well, it was obvious now.

“Wh—where the fuck are you?! How the hell are you talking to me?!”

“How? I just know where you are. I’ve—” he trailed off. I couldn’t completely understand what he said, but a name did slip out that caught my attention.

“Mortis.” Robert said that this Mortis guy has “eyes everywhere”. I guess that’d explain how he knew where I was.

“Clyde. There are things in this town that want to hurt you. The Reaper, the cultists. Hell, even the Crooked Children if you feel like going to that house.”

“What the hell? What are you saying?!”

“Okay folks, let’s segue into the 90’s now. You ready? Cuz I am! I’m your host, Robert Reilly, and this is Fallscean Radio!”

When it ended, I went to turn off the radio. Robert spoke to me again.

“Leaving so soon? Okay. Hope you’re ready for what’s coming.”

I turned it off.

When I got home, my phone started working again so I texted Ollie about what happened.

C: Yo dude, WEIRD fucking shit happened on the radio tonight. This Robert Reilly guy, radio host, was talking to me! Said that this ‘Mortis’ guy had eyes everywhere. Fuckin WEIRD dude.

O: Hey Clyde, are you sure you’re not crazy?

C: Huh? No, why?

O: Just googled it, Robert Reilly died in 2006, but he was originally a co-owner of the town roller rink. That’s the only record I found of him.

If that was the case, then who the hell was I talking to?

It’s Ollie again. I’m not going to beat around the bush because this shit is serious. The cultists came back. Some of them must have survived the werewolf incident when Clyde and I were kidnapped.

July Eighth to July Twelfth were likely some of the craziest days of my life, so buckle the hell in, it’s a wild ride.

July Eighth, 2025.

It’s 3 PM, I’ve just come in for my afternoon/evening shift and literally EVERYONE is here. Normally, we have at least one person out, so this was a little odd. I knew something was off, so I went up to Spike to get some answers.

“Hey dude, what gives? Everybody’s here. Some kind of event happening?”

His response shocked me, which means everything considering what I’ve seen so far.

“Yeah dude, weird shit. Y’know the cultists who kidnapped you and Clyde?”

I feared his next words. “Don’t tell me…”

“Yeah. The werewolves didn’t do enough, left a few alive. They’ve been recruiting new members under our noses this entire time.”

I tried to hold my tongue, but everything just came out all at once.

“FUCK! GOD FUCKING DAMMIT! WHY IN THE HELL ARE THEY STILL AROUND? *SHIT!*”

Spike let me get all of my anger out and was ready to continue the conversation when I was done.

“Yeah man, it’s not good.” Even Spike was nervous.

“How? I mean, this town isn’t huge but expecting to be able to do EVERYTHING on foot is ludicrous.”

“Clyde’s got a theory.”

“Okay. Let’s go talk to him then.”

Spike and I went over to Clyde, who was fiddling with the radio.

“Clyde? How?”

He looked up.

“Radio Frequencies. I think they’re using the moniker of Fallscean Radio to cover up the actual station they’re at. And the frequency is scrambling people’s brains so they’ll join.”

If we were literally anywhere else, I’d think him crazy, but I believed him. But things weren’t over yet. We still needed to discuss courses of action with the others.

We’ve dealt with these sons of bitches before, so we can damn sure do it again just fine.

At least I thought we’d be able to.

Clyde was the first to speak up.

“Well, we DO have the werewolves. The only problem is that we don’t exactly know where to find them. Other than that, we’re tight.”

Clyde made a good point, but he was wrong about one thing; we had the number of the werewolves. We could call them.

I mentioned that and we then began to look at more options.

If we wanted any chance of succeeding, we’d need everything we could get. There was no telling what the cultists had up their sleeves.

If the strength of the wolves wasn’t enough, maybe their unfettered hatred for the cultists would be.

Lily was the second to chime in.

“I’d say that anyone who hasn’t already tried to murder us would work.”

I completely agreed, as did everyone else. The only problem was… was there a single thing we’ve encountered that didn’t hold ill feelings for us?

“Oh!” I exclaimed. “The Carpenter Goblins! And maybe Santa’s Elves? Spike?”

He looked at me. “Maybe dude, I don’t know how to contact them, though.”

“You think the north pole uses email?” I asked, going outside because we still couldn’t use our phones in the store.

“Try it!” Spike yelled from inside.

I wrote out the email, and I personally think it was really good.

From: [0liversm1th@gmail.com](mailto:0liversm1th@gmail.com)

To: [Santaclaus@northpole.com](mailto:Santaclaus@northpole.com)

*Dear Santa (and the elves).*

*You may recall that my friend Spike helped you out last Christmas. A group of individuals who we thought we had rid ourselves of have turned up again. It’s affecting the whole town now. If you can manage it, please help us.*

*May this letter find you well.*

*-Oliver (Spike’s friend ;D)*

I personally thought it was pretty good.

I sent it and we waited.

While that was happening, we came up with our next plan.

Operation S-O-L (Operation Spike-Ollie-Lily).

The plan was simple; the three of us were to go to different, economically varying parts of town and talk to people to determine how far the activities of the cultists reached.

The Revival Cult, as I’ll be calling it from now on, was only getting larger and larger.

We just didn’t see it until now.

The store was closed down, Clyde, Joshua and Kent all stayed behind to keep watch while Operation S-O-L was executed.

July Ninth, 2025.

I’ve segmented our experiences into three different parts in order of; Me>Spike>Lily.

All of these were compiled using the laptop in the back.

*My Investigation.*

I decided that my best course of action would be to look around the general area of Fallscean High School.

Surely the cultists wouldn’t stoop to convincing 15–18-year-olds to join their cause, right?

Just across the street and to what would be the left if you were facing the school, was a small convenience store.

It helped out with getting energized via caffeinated drinks in the morning or getting something to eat after the school day ended.

I just knew I’d find something here.

I was right.

Before I even walked in, I heard a male voice from inside. It was manic and high pitched, like whoever it belonged to was way too excited to be talking.

“NO! It’s not a cult! It’s a COMMUNE! This town is rotten, a shackle on the ankle of our world! And we want to be free! You smelling what I’m cooking?”

Yeah, the commune also wanted to hurt people but I’m sure that was a bit harder to sell in a positive light.

I walked into the store without any commotion. I took off my FM uniform as to not stand out.

I placed myself in front of the Slushee machine and began to fill up multiple cups with the sugary drink.

This was merely a distraction as opposed to anything else, I don’t like slushees.

I tried really hard to make it seem like I wasn’t eavesdropping, even though I was. I made myself look like a tool but it ended up working out.

The cashier began to ask some questions.

“So, are there actually any benefits to this thing or like? Cuz I’m not huge on it if there aren’t.

“Of course! In joining us, you’ll let go of your earthly desires and become one with the land! Your needs will be met and you’ll want for nothing!”

“So, will I have to still pay taxes?”

“Not if you don’t want to!”

“Okay, count me in!”

I nearly crushed the blue drink in my hand when I heard it. This son of a bitch actually managed to convince someone to join.

Of course, this meant that the store was going to close.

“Hey, kiddo.” The cashier said, looking at me. “Closin’ time. You gotta find somewhere else to go.”

As they walked off, the cultist said something that rubbed me the wrong way.

“Mortis will be pleased by this.”

Mortis means death in Latin.

I’ll have to get back to the store.

*Spike’s Investigation.*

Ollie decided to investigate the high school area, so I chose one of the more urban areas in town. A place where drifters and vagrants mingled.

This was the perfect ground for someone like a cultist to come and spew their dogmatic ramblings of an ideal life.

I went to a small area with a few shacks and some abandoned buildings. God, I never realized just how much of a shithole this town is.

A few homeless men sat outside of a shack, smoking. I walked up to them.

“You gentlemen mind if I ask you a couple things?”

“Go right ahead.” Replied one of the men, who was wearing a cap.

I’ll refer to him as such.

“You guys seen anyone walking through here? Like, dudes in robes? I’m looking for them and I’m wondering if you’ve seen any of them.”

Cap looked up at me with surprise in his eyes.

“Y—yeah, actually. What are you here for?”

“Do you remember hearing of a cult shutting down a few months back? They were pretty notorious, but a full moon in May shut shit down right quick.”

“I think? Maybe.”

“Well, regardless, they’re back, and trying to recruit the entire town no less. And I’m here to make sure that doesn’t happen.”

“Well, actually, one did come through here earlier. He was talking some bullshit, like, ‘Mortis will come for all who don’t obey’. Weird if you ask me.”

“Mortis? That’s Latin, right?”

“Look at me, kid. Fuck if I know. I’m a goddamned vagrant. Look it up or something.”

Death, it means death. Something is wrong, really wrong.

Onto the next man. He was wearing a beanie, so I’ll call him Bean (because the alternative is kind of offensive).

“Did you see anything?”

“Me?” He asked while smoking a cigarette.

“Yes. Have you seen any of what I described to your buddy in the baseball cap?” I replied, thumbing over to Cap.

“Actually, yeah. I tend to frequent the pharmacy and buy painkillers with any change I manage to scrounge up. I typically see some guy in robes every time I’m there. I’m a nosy bastard so of course I have to look at what he buys.”

“And that is?”

“Valium.”

Fuck, these guys meant business.

“Okay, that helps a lot.” I replied. I gave both of them $50 from my wallet, they earned it.

Lastly, I moved on to the bald drinker, who I’ll aptly name Baldy.

“Hey. What have YOU seen?”

“Ain’t seen nothing. Nd’ if I did? Who cares.”

Okay, a bit nonchalant for my liking but hey, nobody’s perfect.

“What? Are you drunk?”

“No, just using my head. Those cultist guys are probably doing some good for the world. Better than you hippie co-op fucks, anyways.”

The hell?

“Hey man, don’t be like that. Why are you butterin’ up the cultists so much anyways?”

“Why? They promise a better life than the shitshow I have to call mine. Look at me, man. I’m a depressed, fucked up drunkard drifting from mattress to mattress. Not to mention, I’m bald as fuck. This is good for me.”

I nearly sympathized with him until I saw what he was wearing.

Tattered white robes.

“Hey, Cap and Bean, you two get up and go. This asshole’s one of them!”

They stood up and got behind me.

“How d’you know?”

“Pattern recognition, but he also completely gave himself away.”

As I said this, the cultist got up and looked at us.

“Ah, fuck. FUCK THIS! WE DIDN’T WANT YOU ANYWAYS! I’M OUTTA HERE!”

“HEY!” I yelled, “NOT YET!”

He stopped and looked at me.

“Oh, what? Big hero wants to make a speech? Well go the FUCK ahead, I’m WAITNG!”

“I’m not a hero, I just can’t stand seeing you people try to infect others with your cult ideals, because that’s what it is, a cult right?”

“NO! IT IS A COMMUNE! WE THRIVE AND HELP PEOPLE!”

“NO! You help people avoid their reality. It’s all bullshit and you know it. You’re just trying to create a group big enough for the consequences of your actions to not matter.”

“You’ll see. YOU’LL ALL SEE! Mortis is coming, and he is going to kill all who oppose us.”

And then, he actually left.

I don’t know what is going to happen next. All I can hope for is that Ollie and Lily found something of help to us as well.

*Lily’s Investigation.*

I decided to hit up the local pizza joint.

It was summer, kids had nothing to do and it would have to house at least a FEW customers.

As I entered Fallscean Pizza, the smell of Italian cuisine enveloped me and the heat of the store wrapped me in what felt like a warm hug, which would’ve been nice if it wasn’t July.

I went to a booth where a couple kids were hanging out. I had to take this chance.

“Hey, you two,” I said, plopping down on the seat across from them, “I got some questions I want to ask you. Don’t worry, I can pay for myself.”

They let me sit with them.

When the food came, we started talking. I started it off.

“So, have you guys seen any men and women in white robes?”

They looked at each other and back at me.

“Don’t think so!”

“Okay. Your parents talk about anything like that? Have you overheard them talking about it?”

The boy spoke up.

“Well, yeah, actually. I’ve heard mom and dad talking about it. They only do it at night when they think I can’t hear them. Dad says to mom that ‘men have been walking into his work wearing white robes lately’. Is that what you mean?”

“Yeah, you got any more?”

“He’s getting sick of it.”

“Okay, thanks.”

I turned to the girl, but I didn’t have to initiate anything.

“My mom works at the salon. She told me a guy wearing those clothes came in for a full head shave the other day. Said he’d pay for it by allowing her into the ‘group’ he was in.”

“Their commune.” I responded.

“He ran out without paying after she rejected the offer.”

“Okay, thank you both. Don’t worry about paying, call it even.”

I paid for their meal and left. It was expensive as hell but they deserved it.

Those kids may have just helped us save the town.

It was finally time to take what we'd learned back to the others at the market. 

We had no idea what we were in for, but the only way to finish this would have been to get through it. 

To be continued...
