I am writing this down because I feel I am going crazy, I feel like I have nowhere else to go to talk about this.  My friends don’t believe me, my family, even though they won’t say it, they think I’ve lost it.  I just need someone else to indulge in this madness with me for a bit.  You read that title right.  There is a clown in the desert outside and at night I swear I hear him calling my name.
Let me start from the beginning, I live in Southern Arizona, near the Tucson area specifically towards the east side.  If you live near there you know what it looks like, beautiful mountains, good houses, pretty decent school districts, and for my outdoor enthusiasts reading this, large open desert plains filled with mostly just shrubs and various species of cacti.  I grew up in this area my whole life, went away for college to get away from the heat but came back and got a job as a teacher at my elementary school as a third grade teacher.  I do think I love it here, you know it's hard to have an objective look through all the nostalgia and all that.  
Things get weird in the desert sometimes.  Not often but sometimes at night things get loud.  I don’t really know how to explain it, just loud.  Sometimes it’s a comprehensible noise like random birds outside making a cacophony of caws and calls, sometimes it howling winds.  But sometimes it sounds closer. 

 I remember two nights in highschool where the noises became too much.  On the first night I heard howls and cries outside, I think it was coyotes, their noises like a child screaming mixed with an injured dog's yelps, I didn’t get much sleep that night.  

Then the next night I remember the coyotes were gone, searching for food somewhere else in the desert.  I thought, I probably could’ve had a good night’s sleep that night until the scraping, the noise of something sharp against my bedroom wall and window, the window that led to my house's backyard, like nails on glass.  I froze in my bed thinking someone was just mere feet from me, the only barrier between us being my window.  It went for only a few minutes but in my panicked mind it felt to me like an eternity.  When the scratching finished I remember the other sounds even more clearly.  Cracking snapping noises like chicken bones being broken in half and dripping, not dripping like rain off a roof but like a low dulcet random few drops hitting my rocky backyard just outside my window. Then it just stopped.  As soon as it started it was finished.  The only thing to fill the silence was my ceiling fan and my own thoughts.  I didn’t sleep that night either.

The next morning in my tired state and the bright morning sun I found there was no sign of any scratch marks on my wall or window.  All I found was a spot on the rocks that was a little darker like some liquid that was once there had already mostly evaporated, and a small piece of what looked like latex, like a little piece of a purple balloon after it popped.  I think I threw it away.  Just a piece of trash that blew in at some point.  Had to have been.
I don’t think it was just a piece of trash anymore, not after what’s been happening lately.  I hear it.  In the sand out there.  He calls me.  He calls my name.

It started a few weeks ago, I was woken up by it.  Saturday, roughly around 2 A.M. outside my apartment window I heard it.  Something now one would like to hear in the middle of the night.  Deep slow laughing.  My eyes snapped open when I realized what it was.  

“Creepy,” I thought.  But there’s a wash, or for people who didn’t grow up here it means a dry riverbed, next to my apartment behind a wire fence and some shrubs and my area has a problem with homeless people sometimes so maybe one of them was in there doing the fentanyl flop or something.  I thought it was creepy and weird but mostly all I felt annoyed. 

I was up now thanks to the laughing, I was up after a long day of trying to teach kids about the damn water cycle and I was mad.  In my anger I may have opened my window and shouted.

“Hey, shut the fuck up!” I shouted out my window, not my best moment but I was tired and had the protection of being up on the second floor. 

 I kept my head out the window for a few seconds after shouting, moving it around to try and angle my eyeline the right way to see around the bush and see this freak that was laughing so early in the morning.  It took a few seconds for the laughing to stop, after it stopped I pulled my head back into my room keeping my eyes glued to the wash, or at least what I could see of it.  I hadn’t closed the window yet when I heard it, something shuffling through the bushes and walking slowly away from my complex, and I mean slowly, this guy out there was moving at a snail's pace.  That’s when I saw it, the thing that changed this from a shitty night to one that sent ice through my veins.  Something floated up past the bushes.  Just barely cresting the foliage.  It was black or at least some dark color that blended into the night of the desert, it was shiny and bobbed up and down curiously.  

“What the hell?” I thought, “A balloon?”  I followed it with my eyes for what felt like ten minutes, tracing the bushes outside my apartment complex until it went around a corner and down the rest of the length of the gate that led to a more open area of desert. 

It was freaky and I had definitely gotten a little more spooked by the balloon coming out of nowhere.  I remember putting on YouTube to help calm my nerves and go back to sleep after something akin to a hourish of staying awake scrolling through Twitter.

I live alone and the thought of some freak with a balloon outside my apartment having a grand laugh was kind of funny but something about it freaked me out.  Why hadn’t anyone else woken up and told them to leave?  Why did I even wake up in the first place?  I’m normally such a heavy sleeper that something that was such a low noise could have woken me up was odd.  But nevertheless the mix of random gaming news on twitter mixed up a heavy dissection of the Alan Wake games on my TV eventually lulled me back to sleep.  

Things went back to normal for a few days, the weekend came and went.  I saw some friends, drove the thirty some minutes it takes to see my parents, the memory of the guy out my window came and passed and eventually was a memory completely forgotten to the work week starting up.

It was Thursday night when something weird happened again.  I wasn’t sleeping this time, actually I was late coming home, sometime between eleven and eleven thirty, I was watching a movie with my friends and coming home from my buddy Patrick’s house I was a little late.  Parking and walking to my apartment were fine, I don’t get freaked out in parking lots at night like some people, I’m a tall white guy, six foot six; so I’ve never had to be afraid of walking or jogging at night.  The only thing that really freaked me out was outside my apartment door, below the apartment number Room A23 and my door handle I found puddles, puddles of some clear liquid slowly seeping into the concrete outside my door.  

My neighbor must have dropped their water bottle leading to a spill.  Must have been, needed to be.  Seeing it sent me back to that night back in high school.  Filled my head with the scraping noises, echoing around my skull growing louder within the bone acoustics until that was all I could think about.  All leading to a faster heartbeat and a racing mind. 

“You're overthinking yourself into a panic attack.  Calm down and breathe.” I said to myself before unlocking my door. 

I must need sleep, long night, middle of the week, the kids are tiring me out.  Has to be.  I hadn’t thought about that night in highschool for years, I had gone to college, graduated, gotten a career, why is that awful night all I could think about now, so many years later.

I quickly reheated some dinner from last night, scarfed it down and ran to my bed to try and forget about this night.  Once again videos on my TV became a shelter from the amount of thoughts bouncing around my head that night.  

Just as I was getting ready to actually try and sleep I felt a compulsion.  The need to look out my window.  Back to those bushes, just beyond my little safety of the parking lot, the fence, and the bushes.  I fought the compulsion, I was being stupid, my night being side tracked by just a single coincidence.

But I thought about it more, why would my neighbor have spilled right in front of my door and number plate?  That didn’t make any sense, and it was only a few drops, things that anyone aside from me probably would have just skipped past without a second thought.  

The need was too strong.  I needed to move my blinds and look out there.  I would have to if I wanted to sleep at all tonight, just for peace of mind.

Opening the window there it was.  I sank in my bed at what it was in the parking lot staring up at me.  A clown, a fucking clown looking up at me from the parking lot.  

Blotchy smeared greasepaint covered his skin, it was beginning to crack and chip on parts of the clown’s fat bloated head.  The clown was a large man, he looked like he barely fit into his shiny perfectly clean rainbow bodysuit, buttons trying their best to hold his immense shape.  His hair a shitty dye job of red that left it all frazzled and dried out going every direction but up, as the top of his head had no hair, just white painted cracking skin.  In one hand held the strings of a few balloons.  One red, two yellow and one that made this all the worse.  One Purple.

His other hand pointed up to my window, I had just barely pulled the blinds away enough to look out there, his hand was already raised when I looked out there, he had been like this for some time.  

All of this just being accented by his grotesque face.  Plump cheeks like a baby that looked wrong on someone who had to be pushing late fifties early sixties, bright yellow eyes bulging out of his rounded face.  He looked like he was laughing, his body shaking and rocking back and forth with the movement of his silent laughter,  he wasn’t making any noise from his mouth.  His horrible mouth… he had no lips, no lips to hide his horrible rotten teeth, nor to stop his rampant spittle from going across the parking lot.  His lipless mouth had curled back and in on itself making it look like the clown wouldn’t be able to hide his teeth even if he closed his mouth.  

I sat there for what must have been hours.  Frozen in fear, I couldn’t move, I couldn't break my stare with the clown.  His silent laughing hadn’t stopped and he showed no sign of stopping until a headlight turned into the parking lot and illuminated the clown's body.  He didn’t react to the sudden light, he just moved back away from my window out of the way of the car but clearly within sight.  His hand pointing at me curled into a beckoning motion, his finger curled a few times, showing me his disgustingly long nails.  Then after the few come here motions he turned around and crawled the fence with surprising speed for such a rotund man, he was gone.  

I sat there for hours, my heart beating in my chest like a steel drum.  I was shaking and panicky.  What the hell was that, what the fuck just happened?  That couldn’t have been real, no way there’s some clown in the wash next to my apartment, this can’t be real.

I sat there racking my brain when sunlight began to peek through the horizon.  It was morning, I had no sleep, was not okay and very much so not in the mindset to go to work,  I had to call out.  But most importantly I needed to find someone with answers.
 
My neighbor.  I remembered the car driven by a shitty little clunker with an umbrella corporation sticker on the back window. I knew exactly who it belonged to, my downstairs neighbor Jerome.  When I finally got my exhausted body into some real clothes and down the stairs I accidentally knocked too loud on her door making more of a slamming noise then the knocks I intended.  He came to the door in a pair of boxers and a tank top with a look of confusion and mild anger/annoyance on his face. 

“Hey man what’s up?  You need something?”  He said, I could tell I had woken him up.  

“Yeah, um this is gonna sound crazy.  Did you see a clown last night in the parking lot?”  I knew it sounded crazy but that clown last night looked so weird of course he saw it, it was the thing of nightmares.  

He gave me a look of utter confusion.  “What?” he said.

“Did you see a clown last night, yes or no?” I said more frantically, turning into a bit of a mad shout at the end.

“No jesus, look man I’m trying to sleep so can you like, go?  If I see anything weird like that I’ll let you know okay?”

I nodded, the shame of what I was asking overtaking me. Maybe I was just going crazy, I mean schizophrenia can form around twenty four right?  I think I read that somewhere.  The scratching noise was in my brain again as I lurched my way back up to my apartment.

I spent the next two weeks with no nightly interruptions, just my own fear of what could happen if he, it, came back.  He clearly knew where I lived, I had told my sister, she didn’t believe me, called me batshit crazy, and my friends just thought I was messing around or the stress of being a teacher had finally broken my brain.  I just have this feeling that something is gonna happen and he’s going to come back.  All of this got confirmed tonight, after a long day of grading papers and parent teacher conferences I got home to find an envelope on my table, hanging from it was a purple balloon.  I didn’t get my mail today and no one else has a key to my apartment.  The envelope was a manilla color and kind of crumbled or wrinkly.  There was no return address but I knew there wouldn’t be.  I couldn’t help myself, so I opened it.

The letter read as follows:
Dearest James,

I’m so glad to have finally been able to find you.  You really are oh so good at hide and seek, I was beginning to think that maybe I would lose the game but no I did indeed find you.  Congrats on lasting the longest anyone has.  Now we can be friends again, I know you missed hanging out with your bestest friend you ever did have.  You are a very special boy.  I’ll come see you again real soon.

With Love, 
Mr. Lipsy

The page looked like they had been dried and I could see what were definitely marks from where I imagined his saliva had dripped on the page.  The letters were scratchy like it was written in a hurry by some with frantic shaky hands.  How did he know my name?  What did he mean we can be friends AGAIN.  What the hell is happening.  

Please if you have any suggestions on what I should be doing in this situation, literally anything at all I need help.  Ever since I read that letter the scratching noise hasn’t left my head.
