My wife is the best woman in the world. She has every quality a woman can have. She's beautiful, with a slender body, pale skin, blonde hair and beautiful blue eyes. She's the embodiment of the perfect woman. Our two kids, a boy and a girl, have (thankfully) inherited her beauty, and have even been in a toy commercial when they were younger. This is honestly the perfect life and I could not wish for anything more.

We met 12 years ago and have really hit it off really quick. 1 year into dating we got married and after 2 years we already had kids. It just shows how much I love her. Well, she has her quirks, but it's just how people are, we all have our little thing. Our first share of troubles started about 2 years ago, when we got into a car accident. My wife was heavily injured with a punctured lung and a pretty huge concussion. I prayed day and night for her safety, and miraculously, she made it out alive! It took about 3 weeks for her to be discharged and we went back to being a happy family.

Now, this is where it gets a bit weird, so I'm going to need your advice. I've put up with it for a while since I thought it might have been the after-effects of the accident but.. she doesn't really talk much anymore. I don't understand why, since she actually used to be the talkative type. She's very lazy and doesn't do any chores, hell, I even have to feed and wash her myself. I don't want to take her to a doctor since I know they'll try to keep her there, like at the time with the accident. My 2 kids started to grow an attitude, calling me all sorts of names and even trying to run away from home! (Lucky I keep the doors locked at night, so they didn't really manage to do anything). I was really disappointed so as a punishment I locked them in their rooms. They we're really fucking vocal at first but with time they probably got used to it. My wife gives them food and water so they aren't starving or any of that bullshit (I know some of you were just eager to call me an abuser). Well, I digress. The thing that made me want to write this post and helped me figure out something weird is going on is that she started to fucking smell. Like, it's hard to even make love to her because of the smell. I wash her EVERY. FUCKING. DAY. to the point where there are now small scratches on her skin from the almost constant rubbing. If you want to call me an asshole for that, you can, but I care a lot about my wife's hygiene. Even if she's in this state now, I'm doing my best to help and take care of her. I know she's gonna come back and be back to her smiley, great self, but it's painful to see her like that.

Any advice?
