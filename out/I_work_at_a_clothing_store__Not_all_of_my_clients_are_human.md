I work at a clothing store. It’s one of those high-end, spend $100 for a t-shirt type place. We cater to people from many walks of life, but mostly, rich assholes who think they know everything. I honestly wasn’t sure why I was accepted when they hired me. My last job was working at a dog groomer before the pandemic. I had absolutely no knowledge of fashion, yet the manager, Daniel, seemed to really like my personality and offered me the position after only two interviews.

&#x200B;

“This position is part time,” he explained, “so most of the people we’ve had have moved on after a few months, whether it be for college or out of boredom. It isn’t the most exciting line of work, but I think you would really thrive in a shop like this!”

&#x200B;

This made sense at the time, and his enthusiasm soothed my worries. Looking back, I now see why it is almost impossible to find someone willing to put up with our more eccentric clientele.

&#x200B;

When I first started, it seemed like the perfect job for me. I genuinely love customer service (I know, it’s weird), and helping people find clothing that makes them comfortable and confident always made me feel a sense of pride, even if they were pretentious and scoffed at the clothes I wore. However, there were some red flags that, in retrospect, should have been a clear sign as to what our shop really does. First, we don’t really have a lot of products in-store. Most of our pieces are marketed as “limited edition” or “exclusive,” so there really isn’t a whole lot of options, but people *love* finding something only they can have. For some of my clients, I am able to build outfits for them and they can leave with arms full of bags, like your typical shopping spree. The weird part is, we have an entire custom clothing service. We have everything you’d need to get fully measured, different fabric swatches (that I wasn’t allowed to touch or even look at) to pick from, and an entire system for ordering specialty items and sizes. I didn’t really understand why we had all of these tailoring tools in our shop at first, since I had never seen anyone come in for anything custom, and I assumed the biggest draw to our shop was the exclusivity and branding.

&#x200B;

The other very odd business decision is our location. The shop is on the 3rd floor of a nine story building, so we are a bit secluded compared to your average retail store. I always thought this was a strange choice for a store to make, since the very bottom floor of the building is empty, and we would get much more traffic if we moved down. My manager assured me that this was the best spot for us, and I didn’t argue because, well, I don’t care. We get a good amount of people in the store, and word of mouth is an incredible marketing tool. Speaking of marketing, we don’t have any commercials, advertisements on the street, or even a sign on our building. We don’t have a website, and our location on Google maps says “permanently closed.” (I’ve brought this up to Daniel multiple times, but, in his words, ‘it’s safer that way.’) On my first day, I could barely find the shop. Word of mouth really is the only way people are able to find us, unless they are willing to walk into a strange building and ride a tiny elevator up to the third floor out of pure curiosity (which honestly happens more than you’d think). Despite actually having an elevator, my coworkers and I aren’t allowed to use it. I always assumed it was some weird company policy to make us seem more professional, and since Daniel said the elevator automatically locks when we’re closed, I never really thought about it.

&#x200B;

That was until about my second month on the job.

&#x200B;

I was closing a little later than usual with Daniel, when I heard the elevator doors open. Our shop closes at 7 p.m., so I thought someone had caught the elevator before it locked. This had never happened before, but with the type of people we cater to, I wasn’t surprised they would do something like this. I quietly groaned to myself and looked at Daniel, who I assumed would share my annoyance. Instead, his face completely drained, and he started sweating.

&#x200B;

“Get in the office,” he hissed at me, “Lock the door. Don’t come back out until I say.”

&#x200B;

This caught me off guard, as Daniel had always been a super easy-going guy. I’d never heard him panic, even in the biggest of rushes, and he’d certainly never spoken to me so sharply. In my moment of hesitation, I heard the front doors open, and he quickly shoved me in the back and closed the curtain separating the tiny stockroom from the floor.

&#x200B;

My first thought was we were being robbed. I ran into the back office, quietly closed the door, and pulled out my phone to call the police. Before I could even start dialing, I heard my manager’s cheery customer service voice:

&#x200B;

“Hello, sir! Great to see you again. How can I help you this evening?”

&#x200B;

I paused, waiting for some sort of response, but only heard my own heart pounding in my chest.

&#x200B;

“Absolutely! We just got some new fabrics in that I think you’ll totally love. Let me grab the swatches for you.”

&#x200B;

I heard Daniel walk to the stockroom, rustle around in some boxes I assumed was the newest shipment of swatches I wasn't allowed to touch, then quickly walk back. I decided against calling the police, as I was still new and didn’t want to risk making a scene, since Daniel seemed unphased by this visitor. After about an hour of listening to him having a seemingly one-sided conversation, I finally heard him say goodbye and lock the front doors. He came back and opened the office door, clearly exhausted and still wearing the tailor’s tape around his neck.

&#x200B;

“I’m so sorry about that,” he sighed defeatedly. “I didn’t mean to snap at you. You are an amazing employee, but I don’t think you’re ready to get into the custom side of the business yet. I don’t want to scare you off.”

&#x200B;

I didn’t know what to say, and seeing my manager so thoroughly drained, I decided to save my questions for tomorrow. I said it was fine, clocked out, made my way down the 3 flights of stairs as quickly as I could, basically sprinting to the bus stop.

&#x200B;

The next morning, I got in to see that Daniel had done all of my opening tasks for me. Surprised, I walked into the back office to find him holding a coffee for me as well. I didn’t know him well enough yet to tell him I can’t stand coffee, so I took it and thanked him, taking a small, bitter sip to not seem ungrateful.

&#x200B;

“I guess I have some explaining to do,” he started, and took a large gulp of his own drink.

&#x200B;

“This store is extremely special. We help a lot of people find clothes that might not be able to otherwise.” (This statement confused me, as I always assumed the people I helped were well-off and just wanted to spend some money, but I decided not to interrupt.) “As you now know, we also make custom clothing for those with… unusual needs.”

&#x200B;

He paused to take another sip, and I felt myself holding my breath for some reason.

&#x200B;

“Tonight, after we close, I would like you to stay and work the off hours with me.”

&#x200B;

I must have been visibly confused, because he hesitated a moment before continuing. “The shop closes at seven o’clock. But, from seven to ten, we are open for our custom services. We offer this to our more *unique* customers who don’t fit into the typical sizing of retail clothing,” he said slowly. “We have an appointment tonight at 7:30 with one of my regular clients. He is the gentleman that came by last night. I wasn’t expecting a surprise visit from him, but he managed to sneak past the barrier before the elevator locked. He has an appointment tonight to finish up his measurements and finalize his purchase. I want you to shadow me so you can learn the basics.”

&#x200B;

He took one last swig of his coffee before tossing the cup in the trash and standing up. “Also, you don’t happen to understand sign language, do you?”

&#x200B;

If I wasn’t already stressed enough about starting a new job, I was completely shaken after my conversation with Daniel. I had more questions than I knew what to do with, so I decided to just keep my mouth shut and see what would happen. At 7:25, I was basically numb with anxiety, just waiting for whoever this person was to show up so we could get this over with. I was aware I’d be getting overtime pay for this, which was the only thing keeping me from fleeing, but I couldn’t shake the feeling something extremely horrifying was about to walk through the doors. Of course, I was right. At 7:30 on the dot, I heard the elevator doors open. Daniel rushed out from the back and gave me a reassuring but nervous look before turning to the front doors as they opened.

&#x200B;

“Koro! It’s great to see you again, sir! I’d like you to meet our newest employee, Harper.”

&#x200B;

Daniel had talked me through some basics of what was about to happen, how to measure 'irregular' body types, and explained how it was imperative that I was extremely polite, but nothing he said could have prepared me for what I was about to see. When I turned to face the client who had entered the shop, I screamed louder than I have ever screamed before, and instantly blacked out.

&#x200B;

Now look, I am no stranger to horror. There is nothing I love more than curling up on the couch on a rainy day and watching a good scary movie, but I am also an *extremely scared* person. For every horror movie I watch, I need to watch at least twice as many cartoons, or old Pixar movies, or random YouTube videos to calm my mind. I am terrified of the dark, and still sleep with a nightlight (and I’m not ashamed of it!!). I love scary things, but being scared? Absolutely not. So when I came to and saw ‘Koro’ standing over me, I almost passed out again. This creature seemed to stand at least eight feet tall, had almost translucent skin, and no face. And I don’t mean like Slenderman-type where there are indents where a nose and eyes should be, I mean flat as paper, nothing was ever meant to be there. Weirdest of all, despite having no distinct features at all, he seemed to have human ears. These, unlike the rest of his too-smooth face, were horribly misshapen, almost as if they had been severely burned or crudely cut off and sewn back on. He was wearing a navy suit that was just as translucent as his skin, and the way the light filtered through his entire body made my head spin again. I couldn’t comprehend what I was seeing. He turned his head slightly when he noticed me staring, as if he was studying me, but Daniel’s face quickly blocked my view and brought me back to reality. In a daze, I felt him carry me into the office and carefully lay me on the chair before writing a quick note and closing the door. I sat for a moment with my eyes closed, trying to comprehend what I had just seen. I almost convinced myself it was in my head, until I saw the note Daniel had left me:

&#x200B;

*I should have warned you, I’m so sorry. Please stay here until he leaves. I am worried you have offended him. Don’t worry, we are old friends, so you are safe. I will come back with some coffee once he’s left.*

&#x200B;

Great, more coffee, I thought, as I leaned against the back of the chair. A moment passed, then I fully processed what I had just read, and instantly felt fear knot in my stomach. What did he mean by ‘*you are safe*’? Was there a chance I wouldn’t be safe? I felt myself getting lightheaded again, so I pushed the thought aside, rubbing my head that had slammed into the hardwood floor.

&#x200B;

After another anxious hour of hearing my manager have a one sided conversation with ‘Koro,’ he softly knocked on the office door and peaked it, holding a white coffee cup as a peace offering. I took it silently and allowed him to sit down across from me. He once again looked completely exhausted. It seemed like working with this particular “client” really took it out of him.

&#x200B;

“I’m really sorry for what happened back there,” he started, but I cut him off.

&#x200B;

“Daniel, what the FUCK did I just see? How could you not tell me about this?!” I yelled, a little too loud. He looked slightly hurt, and I immediately felt guilty.

&#x200B;

“That’s fair, I deserve that,” he sighed and rubbed his forehead. “I didn’t know how to properly explain this to you. The last person I tried to warn before getting into custom thought it was a joke and… well, they really upset a client that isn’t as forgiving as Koro.”

&#x200B;

I felt myself start to panic, wondering what he meant by that and remembering his note, but he quickly moved on, trying to cover up what he had just said.

&#x200B;

“I understand that this won’t work for you anymore, and you are more than welcome to use me as a reference on your resume. I promise to only give you glowing recommendations.”

&#x200B;

“Wait, are you firing me??” I couldn’t believe what I was hearing, and I felt myself start to panic. “I’m sorry I swore at you, I didn’t mean to yell, I really do love this job and I’m sorry I offended your… friend, I just didn’t know what to expect, I’ll do better next time-”

&#x200B;

Daniel held up his hand to stop me.

&#x200B;

“Wait, you’re not quitting?” He looked genuinely shocked.

&#x200B;

“In this economy? Fuck no,” I said quickly, and cringed at myself for once again swearing in front of my manager.

&#x200B;

He let out a deep laugh, and looked at me with what seemed to be both respect and pity.

&#x200B;

“Well, we won’t do any more customs for you for a bit, but if you are going to stay here, you’ll have to do them eventually. It’s a big part of the job.”

&#x200B;

I thought about this for a moment, and decided that I had overreacted to what I saw. Maybe I was gaslighting myself, but after an hour of hearing my manager talk to himself, I was pretty convinced I hadn’t actually seen what I thought. Besides, I *had* hit my head pretty hard on the floor.

&#x200B;

“Let me try again tomorrow,” I said, way more confidently than I felt. “I can do this. Is Koro coming back?”

&#x200B;

“He won’t be back until next week when his new suit arrives,” he said gently. “Why don’t we try again then?”

&#x200B;

I was kind of disappointed that I wouldn’t be able to prove myself for another week, and thought about arguing that I could shadow him with other clients, but I decided to let Daniel call the shots here. I didn’t want to embarrass myself again, or possibly suffer another concussion.

&#x200B;

This is where you might be thinking, "Why do you feel like you need to prove yourself to a boss that introduced you to a monster? Why didn't you run away? What the fuck is wrong with you?" etc. Look, I don't have the answers to those questions. I like to be viewed as capable, and having to be physically carried away from a client (albeit the scariest client I had ever seen) by my manager was humiliating. I desperately wanted another chance to show I can do this job.

&#x200B;

The next week went by extremely slowly, and dealing with the everyday pretentious client started to drive me crazy. When the day finally arrived that I would work the custom shift, I was actually excited. I had fully convinced myself that I had imagined everything the week before, and I was looking forward to trying my hand at custom fitting. I’m not super passionate about clothing at all, but getting to do something besides helping entitled people find an outfit for their next date was extremely enticing. After we had closed, Daniel sat me down and gave me more of an explanation.

&#x200B;

“Koro is an extremely kind being, if you respect him. Do not look him in the eyes, or where his eyes should be, I guess. Don't stare at him, either. It isn't good for your eyes. He cannot speak, but he can understand us. He uses sign language to communicate, so I hope you’ve been practicing.”

&#x200B;

I took sign language as my mandatory language in high school, and actually retained quite a bit. I had been brushing up over the last week per Daniel’s advice. I nodded, and he continued.

&#x200B;

“Do not ask him any personal questions about himself, and please don't tell him anything personal about yourself. I don’t know what he is exactly, but I have been working with him for over 5 years, and as long as I respect his boundaries, he is extremely pleasant. He’s even kind of funny!”

&#x200B;

He tried to sound cheery, but his little talk had brought back my anxiety ten-fold, as I realized I had, in fact, seen exactly what I thought that first night. I had no time to process this, though, as we heard the elevator doors open.

&#x200B;

“Let’s do this!”

&#x200B;

Daniel patted my knee and plastered his customer service smile on his face as I heard the front doors open. He gave his classic greeting, and I took a deep breath before turning around.

&#x200B;

Standing before me was Koro, exactly as I remembered, although he wasn’t as tall as I had thought, standing maybe six and a half feet. This didn’t help with my very primal fear, as I quickly had to avert my gaze when I noticed the lights glistening through his skin, and tried to hide my shaking

&#x200B;

“Koro, I’d like you to meet Harper. Again.”

&#x200B;

He chuckled uncomfortably, and looked at me as if you say *don’t be fucking rude.*

&#x200B;

“Hello sir,” I said, swallowing hard. “I apologize for our previous meeting. I wasn’t feeling very well…”

&#x200B;

I didn’t have any excuse prepared, really, as I didn’t think this creature with no eyes would have such an intense stare. He seemed pleased enough with this answer, though, and quickly signed something to me. Daniel laughed nervously, but it was too fast for me to understand.

&#x200B;

“What did he say?”

&#x200B;

Daniel hesitated. “He said ‘It’s alright, I supposed I can forgive you, just this once.’”

&#x200B;

I felt my face pale, and Koro signed something else. He looked at Daniel expectantly when I didn’t understand.

&#x200B;

“He says it's time to see what you can do. Your new suit is set up for you in the fitting room, sir.”

&#x200B;

I felt Koro glance at me one last time before stepping into the fitting room, and Daniel closed the curtain for him.

&#x200B;

“He really is a very nice person, once you get used to him,” he whispered. ”Just give him a chance.”

&#x200B;

He then walked back to the fitting room to make one-sided small talk through the curtain, which I assumed was a habit he couldn’t drop after eight hours of working with clients who did nothing but talk. I took a deep breath to steady myself, and joined Daniel by the mirror.

&#x200B;

When Koro came out, he was wearing a suit I can only describe as void of color. It wasn’t black, it was blacker than black. It was like the paint that guy invented that looks like a black hole, only darker. My brain physically couldn’t comprehend it, and mixed with the translucent figure in front of me, it seemed like I was looking at a shadow cast by nothing, and I had steady myself on the couch. Daniel was busy fussing over the suit.

&#x200B;

“Well, how does it feel?”

&#x200B;

Koro signed his response, and I was able to catch a few things, like ‘too long’ and ‘you think?’. Daniel reassured him that the sleeves were a good length, and thought it fit beautifully. Koro seemed to be satisfied, but turned to me and signed, much slower, “What do you think?” I glanced at Daniel, who nodded, and I stepped around Koro, inspecting the suit. I made sure to avoid looking at his face, even though I could tell him was eyeing me carefully.

&#x200B;

“I think it fits really well. I wouldn’t mess with the sleeves anymore, you don’t want them to be too short.”

&#x200B;

Koro signed something a little too fast, and before Daniel could translate, he put up his hand and tried again, slower.

&#x200B;

“Thank you for your input. You have a good eye for this. I hope you stick around longer than the last one.”

&#x200B;

I felt a chill down my spine as he said this, and turned to Daniel, hoping he would take over.

&#x200B;

“Well, I’m glad you’re happy! You can go ahead and change back, and I’ll get this wrapped up for you.”

&#x200B;

On the bus ride home, I still hadn’t fully comprehended what I had just seen. I knew this would completely change who I was forever, and I really was considering finding another job. However, I now had a big draw to stay: Daniel had offered me a promotion. I guess Koro’s positive opinion of me and my composure during the custom was enough to make him believe I could really handle this, and the pay raise was way more than I’d make anywhere else. Obviously, I ended up deciding to stay, and not just for the sake of my bank account. I thought it would be good for me to step out of my comfort zone and not be afraid of being afraid anymore.

&#x200B;

After a year at this job, one thing is for sure: I will never not be afraid.
