So, I live in Lake Tahoe, and there’s a hangout spot that a lot of people our age hang out at, called Angora Ridge. It’s just a simple road that juts out on a hillside and overlooks the lake and the town. It’s a great spot, but my friends and I have also experienced really paranormal activity up there and haven’t been back since early September. 

First Encounter: So late one night, after work, my buddy and his girlfriend picked me up and we headed up to the ridge to hang out. After a few minutes of talking, they went up the road out of view to talk while I just sat in the back of her truck and looked at the full moon. After a few minutes, I decided to go see what they were up to, as they weren’t answering when I was calling their names. I started walking down the road, and briefly stopped to look at a notification on my phone, and when I looked back up, there was a figure in the road. 

It looked identical to my buddy I was with. So naturally I started laughing and said “Alright man, you got me.” But this thing didn’t move. It just stood in the center of the road in the moonlight, staring at me. I kept saying stuff like “Ok man, joke’s over” or “Dude seriously, it’s not funny anymore”. I then called his name, and he replied with a simple “Yeah?” Keeping my eyes on locked on whatever this was, I then asked him “Is that you about 50 yards up the road staring at me?” I expected a laugh and a “Ok yeah man it’s me”. Instead, what I got was him sprinting towards me from wherever he was and screaming in a panicked voice “No!”

I immediately took off down the road, and eventually my buddy caught up to me and we briefly talked about what had just happened. Whatever it was was now gone. That’s when we heard his girlfriend scream from the forest. I told him I was fine, and to go help her. He took off, and I jumped into the truck. Eventually, they both came back and we got out of there fast. On the way home, he told me he saw whatever it was in the road, but it vanished before either of us could tell what it was. And when it vanished, neither of us could hear footsteps or crunching leaves or anything. We all got home safe that night, and barely any of us could sleep. 

Second Encounter: Me, him, and another one of our buddies went back about a week after that first night. Me and him were paranoid enough, while our other buddy was skeptical. We got out, and just explored the area for a good hour. A couple abandoned sheds, the rest of the road leading to a hiking trail, and just the forest area all around us, while also explaining to our buddy everything that happened the first time.

Eventually, very similar to the first encounter we had, I ended up separating from them briefly. They were talking about how uneventful the night had been. As they were saying this, I glanced up at the shed, and saw two glowing eyes. I laughed and thought to myself “No way”. But it was clear as day. Two glowing eyes in one of the windows, looking down at us. I turned and started running to the car, not saying anything but “RUN!” 

My buddy (who was there the first time), stayed still to look, while I and my other buddy jumped into the car. As he was backing up, he suddenly screamed bloody murder and floored it, stopping to grab our buddy before leaving. As we floored it back into town, he explained that while he was backing up, he saw a face in the bushes through the backup camera. We decided to not go back there until further notice, we would not be going back, and to this day we still haven’t.
