god lacks love. Thick water

 I wake in a cold barren room with what I can only make out as **Brutalist architecture**

I'm laying what looks like an old stained red blanket stained with red creating an almost pleasant design.

the blanket is laying on freezing concrete doing almost nothing to shield me from the cold. I feel something tugging on my leg

I close my eyes in horrifying ignorance.

It tugs harder. 

A tear falls down my face.

I feel a long wet something moving from one eye to the next.

My tear was absorbed and replaced.

It felt like thick water. 

As I laid on the bare dry cement paralyzed I tried to remember how I had gotten there.

Nothing

The only thing that lingered in my mind were two words

Thick water

I have dysphagia 

This was the first memory I could draw from my barren mind.

For a moment I felt ready to face whatever lied in this cell with me. 

I opened my left eye 

Nothing

“How could this be?” I wondered.

I could've sworn to you I saw the room just a second before this.

this wasn't the case anymore.

I hear something scurry in the room with me 

I am now to afraid to open either of my from what I can tell not functioning eyes 

A second memory pops into my head

This time it was my mothers voice singing me a lullaby. I felt tubes and wires sticking out of me from almost every angle. I saw nothing.

I hear something or someone.

I keep my eyes shut tight sure as to not make a peep or they may realize imp awake

The tugging on my leg begins again, almost pulling me off the thin blanket I lay unwillingly conscious on.

My leg was pulled and pulled but my body stopped moving now it was like I was pulling it 

As I laid there petrified and naïve as to what was moving up my leg now up to my knee.

I hear loud wet pops like fire crackers in the rain.

Another memory now of what I could only imagine to be my mother and father arguing.  
Both blissfully ignorant of me

“I cant keep this up Sharron I- WERE FALLING APART.” the man yelled. 

I hear a pop 

“Don't you ever yell at me like that.” The woman said with much more authority than the man.

“Yes ma’am.” the man wept

“Just how do you expect her to run around or play with friends?” what I'm now sure is my father added

“Does it matter when we’ll love her all the same?” The woman who by proxy had to be my mother now balling replied.

“I'm sorry Sharron. I- I just can't.” My father answered, now in tears as well.

I snap back to reality the something moving up my leg was now at my upper thigh from what I could tell. The feeling in my leg was pretty much gone and I began to worry.

Then the something stopped and started to move back down my now soaked and numb leg.

“Where the hell am I” I finally snapped not planning taking anymore of this

I would figure out where the hell I am and what that thing on my leg was and where-

My leg was gone.

This reality didn't set in for quite a while

I opened my eyes

nothing.

I was fully blind too. This thought bounced through the empty confines of my mind 

The word too especially what did I mean by too?

The Finally building up enough courage I tried to stand.

Next thing I remember was a weird lack of balance and wind hitting my face as I fell knocking myself unconscious on the hard concrete.

end of part 1? (this is mainly a test post to see how this'll do and if I want to continue writing horror. This is only my second piece of literature I've ever wrote of my own accord.)
