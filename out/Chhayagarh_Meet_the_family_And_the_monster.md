Freshly out of some context? Maybe you missed [my last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1fnobi9/i_have_reached_the_village_its_worse_than_i/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). If you have simply zero idea what I’m yapping about, though, you should really [start at the beginning](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1fmnzez/i_am_the_new_landlord_of_a_village_something/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button).

I’ve decided to clean up the titles a bit and formalize them so people can keep track of these posts better. Nothing doing about the previous entries; I’m not sure even an entire estate’s worth of money can convince the Reddit overlords to allow us to edit titles. Also, a lot is happening here. A lot. I’ll write stuff up as and when I can, but these instalments are going to get a little spaced out. On the brighter side, as long as I’m writing, I’m still alive.

It was a while until I mustered up the courage to leave the encounter site with the Spirals. Yes, I’ve decided to call those things Spirals, on account of the, you know, spiral faces. The star-eyes driver guy had given me zero idea as to how long his ‘protection’ would last, but when my skin began to crawl with the unmistakable sense of a predator watching me, I figured it was time to grab my luggage and go.

Taking his advice, I got off the roads and ducked into the alleys, weaving in and out occasionally as some paths ran into dead ends or particularly aggressive-looking cows. I did not initially think I would actually be able to navigate the village properly, given that I was literally a child the last time I saw it, but some sort of deep-seated subconscious memories must have resurfaced, because the dense semi-urban sprawl soon began to dissolve back into large fields and imposing farmhouses.

Unlike the fields at the edge of the settlement, these belonged to the richer farmers, and were much better kept and maintained. That meant I was getting closer to the manor, because these were estate lands that had been leased out for farming. A paved stone road ran straight through the fields and towards the house, but there was no way to be certain that this section was not also included in the ‘avoid roads’ titbit. Instead, I opted to trample through the fields.

I regretted that decision as soon as my foot touched the soil. The fields had been watered recently, turning them into a sopping, muddy mess that clung to my shoes and then my legs as I painstakingly trudged my way through. Some places looked dry, promising safety, but were, in actuality, congealed lumps of sludge that definitely did not send me skidding and faceplanting into the ground more than a couple of times. Mercifully, however, no massive mud monster or living tendrils of paddy rose up to attack me again. Mr. Star seemed to have been right; whatever wanted to kill me had not counted on me going off the beaten path (no, I haven’t settled on a name for the guy yet; please help me pick).

Soon, I could see the manor house looming in the distance, which meant that the estate boundaries were not far. Given that I was almost at my destination, I decided that it was safe to return to the convenience of the approach road before I had a few more close encounters with dirt. It was then that I encountered my first villager. Well, the first after my ride got eaten.

Imagine, if you can, gentle reader, that you are walking down the street near your house in the middle of the day, going pleasantly about your business. Then, a dishevelled man comes clambering out of the corner of your vision, caked in mud and lugging two dirty suitcases, armed with a knife jammed hastily into his pocket, sporting a thousand-yard stare and an irritated scowl. Then he locks eyes with you and begins sprinting in your direction.

Some of you may be braver than I am, but as for me, I would very much prefer to be wearing brown pants at the time.

As such, I could not truly blame the poor farmer for taking one look at me, clutching his *lungi* in his hands, and running full tilt in the opposite direction. To add to his woes, he was running in the direction of the estate, so I had little choice but to pursue him. In hindsight, my loud shouts to slow down, accompanied by wild gesticulation, may have done nothing to alleviate his fear.

It took no more than another minute or two of running and shouting before the road bent slightly downwards, sloping towards the estate’s hefty stone boundary wall. The cobbled road continued through the boundary and into our private lands beyond, but the way was barred by a massive iron gate guarded by two bare-chested guards with thick *lathis*. The farmer ran straight to one of them and grabbed his arm, pointing wildly at my demonic form galloping close behind, the sun at my back casting a suitably fearsome silhouette. The two of them looked at me, looked at each other, and quickly raised their sticks, brandishing them warily as they approached me. The villager cowered behind their bulk for protection.

Sensing that I was about two seconds away from getting my dome cracked, I slowed to a walk, holding up my hands (and the luggage in them) in a placating gesture.

As they got closer, they must have noticed that I was at least human, because their gaze slightly softened. Slightly. One of the men jerked his head up in the universal gesture: *“What do you want?”*

I wiped some of the sweat and dust off my face, hoping it would help my case. “Wait, wait, I’m just here to meet the lawyer!”

“What lawyer?” one of them barked.

“The estate lawyer. The one that dropped in a few days ago. Look, I’m Rajendra Thakur’s son. Birendra Thakur’s grandson? Apparently, I’ve sort of inherited this place now, so… Just calm down, okay? Don’t hit me.”

It wasn’t the best speech in history, but this did seem to give the guards some pause. They hesitantly lowered their *lathis*. “Rajendra *babu’s* son? Why should we believe you?”

“Hold on.” I knelt on the ground, opening one of the suitcases and extracting the inheritance letter. “Here you go.”

One of the guards took the envelope and pulled out the letter. “This is in English. I can’t read it.”

The other one, older, with a few greying hairs, slowly came closer and squinted at my face. “Wait… It’s him! It’s really him!”

“Are you sure?”

“Yes! Yes! I remember his face, though it has been so long! The young master! The *Chhote Thakur* is here!” He dropped his *lathi* and folded his hands together. “Forgive us, my lord, we could not recognize you like this.”

The other guard decided to trust him and folded his hands as well, bowing slightly. “*Thakur*, why are you covered in mud? Did something happen?”

“Oh, never mind that! He obviously ran into trouble on the way!” The older one waved at him dismissively, practically chasing him off. “Go to the house! Inform the family! Bring the palanquin!”

I raised a hand. “No palanquin, thank you. I’ll walk.”

“He’ll walk! Why didn’t you inform us you were coming, *Thakur*? We could have escorted you here.” He leaned in a little. “The village is not safe nowadays.”

I touched the edges of my face, where the skin was still dry and torn. “I’m aware. About that… there’s a dead body. Near the panchayat office. We were attacked.”

I expected some kind of reaction, but he only nodded solemnly. “Who?”

“Ramu. The—”

“The shopkeeper’s son.” He nodded again, before turning to the other guard. “You’re still here? Go!”

As he ran off, the farmer slowly came out of hiding, bowing. “*Thakur*! I could not recognize you. Otherwise, I would never have run!”

I stopped him before he could touch my feet. This seemed to be becoming a pattern. “I understand.”

“I should have helped you. I should have seen who it was.” He folded his hands. “There are strange people roaming around nowadays. Strange things, too. Not the ones we are used to. Others. I just did not want to die. I have a family.”

“Strange things?”

“The family will explain all, *Thakur*.” The guard motioned to the gate. “Please come with me. It is not safe outside the walls. And you! Go to the village and alert the others! Tell Ramu’s father too. We need to recover the body.”

“Yes, sir.” The farmer bowed again and ran off.

“Come with me, *Thakur*.”

As he took us through the gate, I noticed for the first time that the metal had been engraved with minute designs and writing. The wall was also similarly painted over with a variety of icons and pictures, some of which I recognized as religious. Most of them, however, held no meaning for me. There were also a variety of charms and trinkets hanging from ropes at regular intervals, but I barely had time to inspect them before I was ushered through to the other side.

Beyond the gate, the open fields fell away to a garden running along the inside of the wall. No, not a manicured lawn-and-flowerbeds kind of garden. A real garden, shadowy and tastefully overgrown. The road broke into a number of meandering paths, lit by open torches every few paces. Trees and shrubbery rose overhead, carefully curated into an intertwining canopy that provided shade on hot afternoons like this one. Flowers, weeds, creepers, and herbs all tangled with each other in the undergrowth, creating a dense carpet that seethed with constant movement from critters. Here and there, mushrooms poked through the green. Despite the look of abandonment, it was obviously maintained, given the number of freshly used gardening tools and watering cans. I can only assume it is an aesthetic choice of the family. As for me, I was too busy wondering if something would jump out of the darkness and try to eat my face again.

A wrought iron fence marked the edge of the garden, and through its gates, the rest of the estate could be accessed. The family property was truly massive, now that I looked at it through the eyes of an adult: sheds and buildings of every description, vegetable gardens and orchards, lakes and ponds with fishing piers and stone waterfronts, statues and sculptures, shrines and grottoes, and cobbled roads running in every direction through clipped meadows. As a child, I had barely left the manor proper, and only with my mother on short errands. I had not had time to appreciate just how unwieldy the place was, or just how many people it took to keep it in shape. Now, my eyes watered just thinking of the costs. Costs that I would have to bear.

“*Thakur*, shall I call ahead to the house and get a car for you? Or would you prefer a horse? Our stables still have a few riding stallions.” The guard looked absolutely sincere.

“A horse?” I stuttered. “Uh, no, no, that’s fine. The house is not too far, right?”

“No, sir, not very far. It is right in the centre of the property.”

I elected to walk. To be honest, despite all the kowtowing, I still felt like an outsider here. I had never even seen a map of this place, much less known or managed it. What had my grandfather been thinking, leaving it to me?

Yes, yes. I know. There must always be a lord. Whatever. But why me? My uncles had all lived on the property forever. They knew it inside and out. Hell, why not my grandmother? She was still alive. Instead, now the entire family had to deal with a city hotshot showing up and ordering them around. I would not make it worse by asking for a horse.

Thankfully, I was a fast walker. It wasn’t long before the boundary walls of the house itself came into view. These were not as thick as the estate’s, but still pretty hefty, standing almost ten feet tall and similarly festooned with drawings and trinkets. Beyond the gate was the front courtyard of the house. There were people waiting for me.

As I slinked through, my grandmother was the first to move, running up and grabbing my face with both hands.

“He is here! Finally, my grandson is here!” she laughed, kissing my face all over. “How long has it been?”

“Years.” I tried to smile, despite the circumstances. “I heard about Grandpa. How are you holding up?”

“Years? More like a decade.” My eldest uncle sauntered up, his usual easy grin just a little more strained than usual. “What’s wrong? The *Thakur* is too proud to ask for our blessings now?”

“Nice to see you too.” I tried to smile, bending down and touching my grandmother’s feet.

“Live long, live long.” She grabbed my shoulders. “Oh, finally, the prodigal son has returned home. Everything will be all right now.”

“Ma’am, should I—” the guard called.

“What? Yes, yes. Go back to the gate. Don’t want to let any of those characters in from outside.” She turned back and called into the house, “Bhanu! Bhanu! Come here! Quickly!”

A manservant came rushing in through the doorway. I recognized him from the vision. He had the same neat moustache and the same coarse *gamcha*. He twisted it nervously again, staring at me and my grandmother.

“*Bibii ji*?”

“Bhanu, this is Biren’s grandson. He will be the new *babu*.” She turned to me. “You remember Ram Lal? The manservant? Bhanu is his son.”

“Oh?” I raised an eyebrow. “What happened to Ram Lal?”

“He got old, so your grandfather let him retire,” my uncle said. “He lives in the village now. Bhanu lives in a house on the estate.”

“Bhanu.” My grandmother gestured at the bags. “Take these to his room now, and prepare some water. Look at him, he’s filthy! He will take a bath.”

“Yes, what happened to you?” my uncle asked. “Were you wrestling?”

“Something like that.” I filled them in on what had occurred.

My grandmother covered her mouth. “Ramu? Oh, he was such a sweet boy. Came here every few days to give us a hand.”

My uncle had a different concern, grimacing. “Those things, huh? They’re new. We haven’t had them in the village before. They showed up with those strange people.”

“Strange people?” Everyone had been talking about these ‘strange people’.

“Never mind that now!” Grandma grabbed my arm. “The poor boy just got here, and he already had such a scary experience. Don’t worry, darling. The estate is safe from those things. Just relax, take a bath, have lunch. Get accustomed. Work can wait.” She waved at Bhanu again, who silently picked up the suitcases and disappeared into the house.

My uncle nodded. “I agree. I’ll fill you in later. Once you’ve rested up, you’ll also need to talk to that lawyer bloke.”

“He’s been staying here? With… all this?”

“For a few days. Don’t worry, he’s been working with us for a while now. He can handle himself. I’ll ask him to see you in the study this evening.”

“Come now.”’ My grandmother led me away from the conversation, and into the house. The stone and marble interiors were cool and comfortable, opening onto a minimally decorated sitting room. Stairs to the right led upwards to the outer rooms, while a short hall in the back opened onto the inner courtyard and living spaces.

“I hope you don’t mind that I didn’t put you in the master bedroom, darling. Your grandfather and I have been living there for so many years. The memories… I just couldn’t bear to give it up.” Her lip trembled a little.

I covered her hand with my own. “Take as long as you need, Grandma. I’m one man, anyway. What would I even do with that cavernous thing?”

“Thank you, dear.” She smiled up at me again, before pointing down one of the hallways. “That is the way to your grandfather’s study. Do you remember how you used to tease him, sneaking in whenever you could? He always used to chase you out, but you did it anyway.”

As I looked at where she was pointing, my blood froze in my veins. Though it was markedly brighter in the daylight, it was the same exact hallway I had seen in my vision, down to the last, minute details, like the displays and trinkets on the cabinets or the paintings on the walls. This, more than anything else, drove the point home. What I saw had not been a dream. Somehow, I had come here that night. The night my grandfather died.

And there, waiting in the same exact spot as last time, was the tall man in the cloak, his broad-brimmed hat tilted down to cover his face. He stood as still as a statue, only his head turning smoothly to face me as my grandmother led me towards the stairs to the bedrooms.

A cold sweat broke out on my forehead, and my muscles began to seize and freeze up. Last time, I had chalked it up to surprise, but it was unmistakable now. This was not just normal fear, though he was plenty scary on his own. Somehow, the man radiated an aura of pure terror and dread. It was like looking at your own brutal death, played a thousandfold in your mind’s eye.

My grandmother must have noticed my faltering gait, because she looked up again with concern. “Are you alright? Did you hurt yourself badly?”

“What?” I forced myself to look away, though the acrid feeling of death continued to press into my nape. “No, no, I’m fine.”

“What were you looking at?”

“Nothing, nothing.” I looked back, though my teeth were beginning to chatter. He was still standing there, looking straight at me. Waiting. “Just… reminiscing, I suppose. Grandma, would you mind if I… explored a little… on my own? Just wanted to see how much everything has changed.”

She hesitated for a moment, before smiling lightly. “Of course. This is your house now, dear. Go wherever you please, but stick to the renovated wing, please. The old wings are dangerous. They can collapse at any time, or you may… see something you shouldn’t have.”

I glanced back at the looming creature. Yeah, I think I had the last one covered already. “Of course. Thanks, Grandma. For making me feel welcome, even after… everything.”

She caressed my face again. “Your grandfather loved you more than anything else in the world, and so do I. Though it took his own death to do it, he would have been happy to see you here. Back in your element, where you belong.”

“Are you doing alright?” I asked again. “After the… How did you find out?”

She sighed, looking at the floor.

“Sorry. I shouldn’t have asked.”

“No, no. You should know. One night, he went off into the forest, alone. Wouldn’t take a *lathial*, wouldn’t take the hounds or the trackers, not even a villager. Just him, his gun, and his bag of tricks, mumbling something about having to do something. He never made himself clear to anyone. He did not return that night. Or the day after. It was only after a week that his corpse appeared at the edge of the forest.” She used her *sari* to cover her face, eyes welling with tears. “One of the servants found him there. It was… horrible. They wouldn’t let me see him, but your uncles told me he had been… eaten. Very little was left.”

“I’m so sorry, Grandma.” I put my arm around her.

She sniffled, trying to smile again. “It’s fine. He always told me that he would never peacefully in bed. His family did not have that luxury. He had been telling me since the day we were married. The *Thakurs* of Chhayagarh have, almost to a man, died before their time, and died badly. They did what was necessary anyway. I’m sure you will, too. But try to avoid the dying part, please. My heart cannot take it again. Not after your father.”

“I’ll do my best.” I had to say that, though I have no idea how I’m going to keep that promise.

She kissed my forehead. “Your bedroom is upstairs. Bhanu will have put your luggage in there. Don’t take too long. Lunch should be almost ready.”

I waited until she was out of earshot. Then, I slowly turned, my legs threatening to shut down again, and made my way over to the cloaked figure. He did not remove his hat this time, but as I got close, I could see his smile under the brim.

“Waiting for something to happen, little lord?” the garbled voice hit my mind like a sledgehammer, blunt and heavy.

“Are you going to eat me again?”

Yes, I know. Stupid thing to ask. But you try stringing together a sentence when standing before a faceless man who has cannibalized you once before and tell me how it goes.

“Hmm… No. You are where you should be. I do hope it did not hurt too much. I chewed gently.”

“Right.” I tried to force myself to remain calm, mentally grounding my feet to avoid toppling over.

“You were attacked.”

“I was. The things I saw… that day… that night. That really happened, didn’t it? It was that night.”

“The night the *Thakur* died.” The voice rumbled a little deeper at that statement, almost as if it was pained.

“You promised you would help me. So, help me. How do I get out of this?”

“I promised I would help you. And I will. In what way I can. But I cannot tell you too much. It would attract attention. There are things on this land even I am powerless against, and that includes what hunts you.”

“Is it the Spirals?”

“No.” He seemed to know of what I spoke, despite me never sharing my nickname with him. My guess was he did not exactly listen to my words. He listened to something else. “They are symptoms. Not the cause.”

“Well, what is the cause?” I blurted out, despite the feeling of doom settling heavily into my chest. “I remember you being much more helpful with my grandfather.”

The man paused, and then reached up and removed his hat, letting me gaze upon his bulbous, white head. The feeling of fear grew overpowering, and my knees finally gave up. I toppled, somehow managing to land into a kneeling posture. All the while, my eyes remained locked on the spot where his should have been.

“Little lord, in our world, a world that is soon the be yours as well, help is never just help. It is an expression of support, and of allegiance. I thought you would have learned that, with what the ferryman told you, but evidently not. I helped your grandfather because he was your grandfather. He commanded their respect, and when he could not, he commanded their fear. I gave him my help, my alliance, my allegiance because his, in turn, could protect me. You cannot protect me.”

He took a step closer, bending to loom over me. As he got closer, his aura gained weight, pressing down on me like a boulder. “You are weak, ignorant, and inexperienced. If not for my promise, I would have killed you myself, the moment you set foot upon this land. We cannot have a weak lord. For all your incompetence, you have great power and greater potential to harm. Your grandfather knew that. That is why he did his best to smooth your way. Personally, I would not have bothered. Better no lord than a useless one.”

The weight was oppressive now, driving me almost prone. Yet, my eyes would not leave that one spot, rooted in place by some unseen force. A few seconds later, the presence withdrew, as the man stood straight again. His hand emerged from his cloak once more, replacing the hat.

“Speak softly here, little lord. Anger is in my nature, and of many others of my ilk. We are quick to it. But most cannot control it as well as I do.” He paused for a moment. “Seek the servant.”

“Bhanu?” I managed to stammer, though my throat was drier than a desert, threatening to collapse in on itself.

“The old servant. Your grandfather’s faithful. Seek him. He may help you.” Like a badly edited video transition, he began to sink into the floor. “That is all I may say. Already, I feel its eye upon me.”

Ram Lal. He meant Ram Lal. I managed to bring my legs under me, finally tottering to my feet.

“I wish you luck. Though I have no faith in you, the *Thakur* did. For his sake, you must succeed.” Only his head remained above ground. “Be careful. Trust no wall or border. Nowhere is safe from him.”

“Him? Not it?”

In hindsight, I probably shouldn’t have asked that question. His head popped like a blister, spraying black sludge over my shoes and the carpet. That, too, dissolved within a second. He was gone.

Did he die? Did the thing he was talking about kill him, because he revealed too much? Or was that merely the way he peaced out of conversations he didn’t like?

Once his presence disappeared, I was able to move freely once more. Going to the bedroom and unpacking was a daze, as was taking a bath in the well-fitted bathroom and descending for lunch. Even as I inhaled my grandmother’s excellent cooking, my mind was spinning with these questions and many more.

I’m going to take a short nap after I finish writing this. Wrestling with supernatural entities is pretty tiring even without the heavy food. I’ll need my wits about me when I take the handover from the estate lawyer, and what better way for a Bengali to relax than an afternoon siesta? The tall man said nowhere was safe, but so far, nothing has materialized on the estate. Just in case, I’ve been keeping Ramu’s knife within arm’s reach. I don’t know if the Spirals were just weak to weapons in general or if the knife had some special properties, but I’m not taking any chances.

I now have two possible leads: the items my grandfather left me, and Ram Lal. Either way, that’s a problem for future me. Bhanu just came by and gave me a gold-plated set of toiletries. Apparently, they just have that lying around. This place constantly seems to promise wealth and power. Both of which, according to all evidence so far, I am far from deserving of. But for better or for worse, my grandfather thought it should be mine. They always say not to argue with one’s elders, but still…

I can already feel something shifting, inside me. Like roots reaching into my core, anchoring me to the earth. I can’t explain how, but I know: somehow, the land is claiming me. It hugs me to its bosom, and won’t let go. Like a stone, it is planting a truth deep in my belly. I belong here.

If I don’t leave now, I may never leave at all. Not really.

And if that happens, one way or another, I will die here. But if I leave, it’s clear that something is going to go horribly wrong here. The signs are clear. I can taste it in the air, like an insurance lawyer can hear sirens all the way on the other side of the city. Chhayagarh is overdue for a disaster.

What do you guys think? Should I go back to the city? While there’s still a chance?
