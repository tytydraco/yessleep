My name is liam and something bad is happening at my school. I’m a freshman at berea college and ive really been enjoying it so far, these first two weeks have been fun. 

I made friends with most of the guys in my dorm hall pretty quick, with the excitement of starting our new lives as adults, and my roommate is really cool too. The nights have been hard though.

I sleep just fine but since last week the guys in the hall have been acting really strange and its starting to scare me, and i cant relax anymore. When it started i thought they were all just playing a joke on me, but they insist that its ‘not them’ doing it, and that i’m acting crazy. I dont really try to bring it up anymore, but i feel like i have no choice now.

The first night was the easiest. About a week ago me and my roommate trevor were playing dark souls together, taking turns trying to beat Dancer, one of the bosses (if you guys know what that is). It was pretty normal for us, and we were eating some leftover food from our dining hall. 

Anyway, trevor got up to use the bathroom at 11pm (theyre shared in my hall, and its right across from our room) and as soon as he shut the door, all the lights in the hallway went dark. I barely made any note of it because our RA turns them off every night, it just seemed a bit later than normal. I continued fighting dancer like normal until about a minute after the lights went out someone started pounding on my door. Our doors autolock so i figured trevor had just forgotten his key or something.

“I’ll get it in a sec trev she’s at half health”

But then the pounding got louder. And they wouldnt stop. It was rythmic and booming, when i would have expected it to be more frantic if trevor was trying to fuck with me. I decided i would probably die anyway and i hated the pounding, so i got up to let him in.

“Alright bro, damn you’re impatient”

As i reached for the door handle i had a creeping sensation wash over me. The pounding was like a metronome, too accurate. I figured his arm would have gotten tired by now or something. At least a little.

I decided on mostly a whim, to check the peephole. It was dark and i couldnt see much at first. As my eyes adjusted slowly i started to make out a silhouette. Two little white lights on a large circular object were getting slammed, repeatedly, into our door. Then suddenly the pounding stopped and in one fluid motion the circles snapped straight to me, as if they could see me through the peephole. 

As my eyes adjusted further, i could vaguely make out trevor staring at me through the door, with his white eyes. His lips looked dry and his hair was much messier than when he had left a few minutes prior. I could also make out someone else, standing behind him, also staring into the same exact spot. Slowly and mechanically, trevor turned away from the peephole and started hitting his head against the door, maintaining the same rhythm as the pounding from before. 

“What the fuck are you doing” i called out playfully, thinking they were playing a prank. 

Then the pounding stopped again, and trevor just stared at the door.

“Just let us in man what the fuck are you waiting for?”

It sounded totally normal. Just like a happy trevor. Thats when i started to take this a bit more seriously. Trevor wasnt the sharpest knife in the drawer and i knew if he was just trying to scare me he wouldnt be able to act this normal. 

“Ok you win im kinda freaked out can yall cut it our now please?”

As i said it the lights turned back on in the hallway, allowing me to see them clearly, including the guy behind trevor who I now recognized as one of our next door neighbors, quincy.

They looked just how i would expect. Almost.

It was as if a sculpting expert had made wax statues of them, and brought them to life. I can’t explain it very well, but it was like the features on their faces were slightly off. Trevor’s nose was a little too low. Qunicy’s eyes just a few centimeters too far apart. Both of them looked a little too pale, and their lips were insanely cracked. 

“Let us in Liam” quincy said, in a joking tone, like he was restraining a laugh.

They wouldnt take their eyes off of the door. They just stood there. I didn’t really know what to do but i felt like letting them in was probably a terrible fucking idea, so i tried to call our RA. 

I leaned against the door just to make sure they couldnt come in. The RA picked up immediately. Phone didnt even ring. 

“Hey jeremy sorry to bother you this late but uhhhh quincy and trevor are acting strange and kinda freaking me out, i was hoping you could come out and talk to them.”

He paused for a little while, obviously in the middle of trying to fall asleep 

“Uhhhhhhh yeah. Ok sure im coming” he croaked. 

I watched him walk down the hallway through the peephole, trevor and quincy not even looking over.

“Hey guys time to wrap up whatever the fuck this is. Everyone is still new here so try not to scare th-“

The lights cut out, silencing jeremy mid sentence. They were only off for a split second, and when they turned back on jeremy was standing next to quincy, with one earlobe drooping just a bit lower than the other. He stared at the door.

At this point I was terrified and also really had to pee.

“Hey, liam its cool man they just wanna come in and hang out. Also you cant keep your roommate locked out.” Jeremy called, unflinching. 

I backed away from the door slowly, and propped up a chair against it.

“I dont know if this is a just a weird fucking joke but you took it too far so uh. Trevor you can go sleep in quincy’s room. I dont wanna deal with whatever you’re doing”

I crawled into my lofted bed and just sat there staring at the door. Thats when the pounding started again. It was faster this time, and harder too. It rattled everything in the room. i could feel each hit reverberate off of my eardrums. It gave me a headache.

“Please stop” I yelled out, desperate for them to be playing a joke. Why doesnt anyone else in the hall hear this? Are they all in on it?

The pounding got a little faster staying consistent and perfect.

BOOM
BOOM
BOOM

I just layed there covering my ears and squeezing my eyes shut..




It’s been night time for a long time now, which is why I decided to write this.

I checked the peephole again about an hour ago. At least thats what it felt like, my clock has said 11:06pm for as long as I can remember pretty much.

There are so many more of them outside now. It seems like the whole hall is out there. I cant bear to look at them either. Some of their mouths hang open. One of them is missing eyelids. And they all just keep staring at the door.

Ive been too scared to look anymore but they keep calling out to me, asking me and begging me to let them in.

Please help me
