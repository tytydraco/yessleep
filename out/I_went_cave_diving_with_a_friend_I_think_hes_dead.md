My name’s Quinton, I’m a cave diver. No matter what people say, it's not as bad as people make it out to be, as long as you do your research and bring the right supplies. The reason there’s so many scary stories about caving is because most people are unprepared and untrained. Most caves haven’t really been mapped out, that’s what brings me to them. I wanna be the Christopher Columbus of the caving world, without all the colonization and taking land that’s not mine.

Long story short, my buddy Jake found a cave. Unmapped and untouched. We geared up, made sure people knew our location and made a trek to the cave. It wasn’t far from where we lived, just a small town in the middle of Massachusetts.

I met Jake there sometime near 2pm, we both took our own cars. He had a top a’ the line Jeep, could get through any terrain, I had a beat up Camry.

“Hey J you ready?”
“Am I ready??? I was BORN ready”
“Yeah okay okay” I chuckled a bit. 

Jake has been a good friend of mine since highschool, I met him at the Mcdonalds I worked at.

“I’m assuming you packed everything like normal?”

He gave me a weird look.

“THE GEAR, THE SAFETY GEAR!”

I didn’t wanna get so angry but I called off work for today and I’m not missing more time when it’s gonna rain later tonight.

“OHHH yeah yeah, no, I got the gear don’t worry.”

He gave me one of those awkward smiles in an attempt to reassure me. I was a little uneasy about it but I can’t lie and say it didn’t work cause I stopped asking. It was around half a mile to the cave from where we parked so it should be near 10 minutes to get there since we were walking, we grabbed our packs and made the walk.

Around 5 minutes in I noticed a skinny but 4ft tall rock with an arrow facing the direction we came from.

“Jake what the hell, I thought you said this place was unexplored?”
“Sorry man, I must'a missed it…what do you think it means?”

“I can only assume where to leave. Lets just go check it out anyways”

5 minutes later we ended up at the cave entrance. It was no different than any other cave I’ve seen in terms of the surroundings, except for one thing, right above the cave hole was an arrow pointing up. I was still so pissed at Jake for thinking the cave was unexplored that when he attempted to bring up the arrow I ignored him.

“OK, I’ll head in first then.” As I watched him go down first my excitement of the cave diminished, I followed suit anyways.

Like every cave, this one was jaggy, the edges of the wall would scratch your skin like a cat's claw if you weren’t careful. It’s the only reason we’re wearing leather down here.

The cave went down like a slope on a graph, it went on like that till we hit a small tunnel. It was definitely the smallest space I ever went through. I had to push, no RAM, my bag through it, I didn’t think it was gonna get through all the way with the sides of the tunnel squeezing me in its rocky hands.

“JAKE	…I’m having some trouble getting through, I’m gonna need you to pull on my bag….”

Silence, I didn’t even realize I couldn’t hear his muffled scuffling in front of me. How far ahead did he get if I couldn’t hear him right in front of me?

“Jake?...”

I waited there for what felt like hours, it wasn’t till I heard Jake scream at me that I realized it had only been a few minutes.

“QUINTON BACK UP AND LEAVE, NOW!”

He wasn’t close at all, his voice echoed from what sounded like the bottom of the cave, I barely even heard him.

“WHAT'S WRONG?...JAKE…JAKE CAN YOU HEAR ME?” 

I got no response and right after I yelled back at him the cave rumbled. A gust of wind blew into my face from the sides of my pack in front of me, I felt the cave yelling at me and I wasn’t the type of fool to ignore it. I scuffled as fast as I could in reverse, I didn’t even grab my bag. As I was retracing my actions, my helmet somehow got stuck. I was so terrified that I just undid the strap and left it. The cave kept rumbling louder and louder as if the earth itself was imploding.
 
I barely made it out the tunnel before I watched it completely close and I don’t mean it collapsed, it CLOSED. I don’t even know how to explain it, the rocks GREW TOGETHER. I didn’t have time to worry about Jake. I crawled up the slope, faster and faster and faster till I got to the entrance. As I threw myself out I looked at the entrance, I noticed the arrow changed directions, it was facing left, right where we came from.

I didn’t think anything was chasing me, but I ran and ran for what seemed like an eternity until I saw the rock we passed, the arrow pointing left. 

I couldn’t stop, I wouldn’t stop. That was until I saw the rock again, it was point right, I ran right.

I came across it another time, it pointed straight, I went straight. Then I saw the cave and the arrow pointed down.

I blinked and realized…I never left the tunnel, let alone the cave.

But I got out of the cave again and I followed the arrows again, I’m stuck here. If you're reading this then my message got out of this loop I’m in and means there's a connection between here and the real world.
