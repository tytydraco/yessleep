I want to be up front and honest that there is most likely an reasonable explanation for what happened but still I want to share my story. 

When I was in the seventh grade I had gym for my class period and during this time we were practicing for the mile run that was required by the state which off topic I think it is stupid. Why does me going to the eight grade depend on me running a mile under 15 minutes.  I am by no means out of shape and can run a mile within 8 minutes! Nothing to brag about but I just thought it was stupid. 

Because it was just practice my friend Brandon and I decided to lollygag. My middle school was surrounded by a circle drive so we were just walking in a circle. Our gyn teacher including students who had finished where in the back of the school. 

We were on our second to last lap when we saw the person in front of us cut the corner. Not really paying attention to it I continued talking to my friend. When we cut the same corner we could see where our gym teacher and others should have been, but no one was there. 

My first thought was that they forgotten us and had already gone inside.  I asked Brandon what we should do and he said "Let's just finish this lap and go in through the front." It wasn't uncommon for either Brandon or myself to be forgotten. We were nerds and outcast so we tend to stay out of the way.

So we did. Now you can't just walk into the middle school. The doors are always locked and can only be unlocked by the lady who sits in the receptionist office who has to verify who you are and then unlocks the door for the person to enter. 

When we got to the door we found the door was unlocked which Brandon found just as weird as I did. We walked in but the lady who sat at the reception desk wasn't there. We walked to the gym and found no one there. 

I am naturally a paranoid person so I was really confused on what was going on! We checked outside again and still no one was there. I asked Brandon "Should we go to the main office?" He said "Yeah, lets do that!" 

As we walked to the main office it hit me that the school was quiet. Like too quiet! Class was in session but it was still common to hear students from the classrooms or a teacher to be walking the hallways.  

When we got to the main office no one was there. We checked the office's and no one. 

We decided to go back outside through the main entrance. We walked the road again towards the back and to our surprise and relief our peers were there. Not to our spurries no one noticed we were gone. I did ask another friend Jordan where everyone went too and he just gave me a weird questioning look.

After that Brandon and I decided it would be best to not mention it to other. This was a little over 10 years ago and I recognize that there is a likely explanation but why could we not find anyone? If anyone has had a similar experience let me know.
