I never understood why some people leave their doors slightly open. Maybe it’s carelessness. Maybe it’s some weird kind of trust in the world.

Or maybe, just maybe, it’s a trap.

I work as a bike courier in a big city. I mostly deliver food, but sometimes it's small packages or documents. Usually, it’s simple—show up, knock, hand over the package, leave. But last week, I got an order that still keeps me up at night.

It was late, almost 10 PM, when the app sent me to an older apartment complex. The building was run-down—graffiti on the walls, flickering hallway lights. I climbed the stairs to apartment 4B, where I was supposed to deliver the package.

The door was already open.

Not fully, just a crack. Just enough to see that the light was on inside.

I hate when customers do this. So I knocked and called out, "Hello? Delivery for you!"

No answer.

I called out again, louder this time. Nothing. I thought about just leaving, but then I noticed something strange: Right next to the door, on the floor, was a pair of shoes—perfectly aligned, as if someone had placed them with a ruler and a spirit level.

I don’t know why, but that unsettled me more than the open door.

A weird feeling crept into my stomach. I should’ve just left. But instead, I stepped closer and knocked again, this time directly on the door.

It slowly swung open.

The apartment was unsettlingly sterile. No decorations, no personal belongings. The furniture was old and worn, but everything was perfectly arranged. The walls were bare—no pictures, no shelves. And directly across from the door, in the hallway, stood a camera on a tripod.

The lens was pointed at me.

I felt my neck tense up.

“Hello?” My voice sounded too loud. Too foreign.

Nothing.

I thought about just setting the package down and getting the hell out of there.

Then I heard it—a faint scraping sound from somewhere inside the apartment.

Someone was in there.

My instincts screamed at me to leave. But my feet didn’t move. I strained to listen. The sound came from the bedroom.

And then I noticed something even more disturbing: The apartment didn’t smell like anything. No perfume, no food, no human scent. Just sterile, empty air.

The scraping got louder. I took a step back, my eyes darting around the room—

And that’s when I saw it.

The bathroom door was slightly ajar.

Through the tiny gap, I could see an eye.

Someone was standing there, completely still, watching me.

My breath caught in my throat.

Then—

A sharp creak behind me.

I spun around.

The apartment door, which I had left open, was now shut.

I didn’t think. I grabbed the handle, yanked it open, and ran. I bolted down the stairs, heart pounding, head spinning. I didn’t stop until I was on my bike, pedaling away as fast as I could.

Only when I was a few blocks away did I dare to look back.

In the window of apartment 4B, a figure stood motionless, staring down at me.

I never reported it to the police. I wouldn’t even know what to say.

But ever since that night, I feel like someone’s watching me.

Always.
