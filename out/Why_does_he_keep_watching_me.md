I always take two buses to go from my home to work and vice versa

It’s part of my daily routine, something that has become second nature by now

Every morning, every evening, every day but the weekends

It’s the same path, the same timing, the same transfer point between buses,i usually don’t even think about it anymore. My body just moves while my mind wanders elsewhere

The neighborhood where I switch buses is usually quiet, especially in the afternoon

It's the kind of place where the streets feel abandoned, and the only signs of life come from the movement of shadows behind closed curtains.

Most days, I don’t see a single soul as walking from one stop to other

Till last week

It was Tuesday, i was walking my usual route to the second bus stop when I caught something strange out of the corner of my eye

There’s a small building I pass every day, it’s been up for sale for months, nothing remarkable about it, really, just another empty property with a sun-bleached “For Sale” sign

But this time, there was someone on the roof

I only saw a silhouette at first. The sun was low in the sky, so his figure was darkened by the bright light behind him

I couldn’t make out any features, just the shape of someone standing perfectly still

He seemed to be facing me

Just watching

My first thought was that maybe he was the owner, checking on the property, or maybe someone interested in buying it. It didn’t strike me as too strange at first

But the next day, he was there again, same position, same stillness

He didn’t move, didn’t wave, didn’t say a word

He was there Wednesday, too, and Thursday, and Friday

Every day that week, I saw him. Standing silently on the roof, just watching. I tried not to let it get to me, but I’d be lying if I said it didn’t give me chills

By Friday, I couldn’t help myself

I tried to be discreet, but I took a photo with my phone, i had to prove to myself that I wasn’t imagining things (The file is at the end of the archive.)

When the weekend finally came, I was relieved not to have to pass by that place. I stayed home most of the time, trying not to think about it

Monday came around again. Back to work. Back to the routine, as I walked past the building, I couldn’t help but glance up, even though I tried not to. But this time... no one was there. The roof was empty

I felt an overwhelming sense of relief. Maybe it was over. Maybe it was nothing

But when I got off the second bus that evening and walked home, something happened. I opened the gate to my house, ready to close it behind me. I don’t even know why I looked back

But I did

And there he was

Across the street

Watching me again
