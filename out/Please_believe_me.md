Ghosts are real. I saw one when I was a little girl. Please believe me. I need someone to finally believe me. Nothing dangerous happened to me yet but I know what I keep on seeing isn’t normal.

For this story, I will be referring to myself as ‘M’. I live in a 2 story house with my mother, father, and brother \[L\] and it was winter break \[19/12/2014 was the exact date\]. I was 8 when this happened. I’m 19 now. My memory isn’t perfect, but I tried to recall what happened to me as accurately as I could.

One winter night I walked downstairs to the kitchen to get a glass of water. The white tiled floor was always clean. Plates and potted plants lined each counter. Me and my brother’s drawings were hanged on the fridge. There was a table in the centre of the room. And in the very corner of the room was a glass backdoor.

I had my phone with me and turned on its flashlight. I carefully stepped downstairs. When I finally arrived, I immediately noticed a white pair of dots from the other side of the backdoor.

Hesitant, I directed my flashlight to the door. That was probably a stupid idea, if it didn’t see me before it did now, but I was 8. I was curious. I had to see it for myself. What did I see- you may be asking?

A dog.

It was staring right at me with its pure white eyes. No pupils. It had grey fur and looked like it was being starved. I froze, confused on what to do. If I looked away, would it change? If I directed my light away from it, would it disappear? Could it break inside? As all these questions flooded my mind- the dog started to smile.

Its teeth were squarish and aligned perfectly, they were surprisingly clean too! But that’s not the point. It’s smile grew wider, wider, and wider. I don’t know how to describe it exactly- but the smile couldn’t fit on its head. It outgrew it. I was horrified- of course. But at the same time, I couldn’t help but feel bad. It looked painful.

I slowly started to step back, keeping my distance. But the minute I started to move, the dog started to raise it’s paw.

Knock, knock, knock.

It kept its eyes on me, waiting to be let in.

I ran.

I ran back upstairs as fast as I could, rushing straight towards my parents’ room. I banged on their door, begging them to come out. Soon enough my mom wakes up. **“M, why are you up so late, did you have a nightmare?”** She asked me. Her tone was soft, but she was clearly tired.

I hugged her, too frantic to describe things clearly enough. **“I saw something! Something in the kitchen! There’s something there!”** I think that’s what I said, it’s what my mom understood.

My mom held my hand and walked downstairs with me. She flicked on the light switch, I gestured to the backdoor and hid behind her. We saw nothing there. **“See dear? Nothing is there. Now go back to bed!”** My mother reassured me. For a moment, I believed her.

I went back to bed and stared up at my ceiling. I saw it, it looked real. I heard it, it sounded real. But it’s not there anymore. It left. Maybe I was just imagining things. That’s what my mom said on the way back upstairs, and I believed it for a short while.

The next day I went back downstairs, back to the backdoor. I didn’t notice it at first, but there was a pawprint on the door. It was faint, translucent, but it was there. I told my mom about it again, but she dismissed me. **“I told you M, it was just your imagination.”** Was what she said to me. But it was there. I had proof it was there.

I asked to go outside, my brother was sent with me.

Like I said earlier, it was winter. I thought I could find its pawprints in the snow. The tall spruce trees were coated in snow, icicles lined up the edge of our roof, and our windows got foggy. I stepped out onto the wooden patio with my older brother behind me. He didn’t say much, we never really spoke to each other a lot.

**“There was a dog here!”** I told him whilst running off into the snow, looking for anything other clues. He didn’t respond. I kept on walking forward, hoping to find something! Yet nothing was ahead. I turned right, nothing there either. I walked closer to the forest behind my house, looking inside the dark woods.

For a moment I thought nothing was there. **“Let’s just go back inside, M. There’s nothing here.”** My brother shouted out to me, I didn’t reply. I saw something in the snow.

It wasn’t that faraway, yet I still ran towards it. A pawprint was there. One single pawprint was engraved in the snow. It pointed towards my house, yet there was nothing behind it. There was no trail. It was just one pawprint left all alone. **“L! Look! There’s a pawprint! A dog** ***was*** **here!”** I yelled back, taking a photo of what I found. Looking deep inside the woods, I stepped closer. Something had to have been there.

My brother ran after me. **“M! What are you doing? You can’t go there!”** He grabbed my arm and started pulling me back.

**“I told you- a dog was here!”**

**“It’s a forest. There’s a bunch of animals in there!”** He yelled at me, bringing me closer to the backdoor.

I tried to pull myself away from him. **“But it wasn’t just a dog! It didn’t have pupils and its smile was-!”**

**“Dogs can smile! Believe it or not. It’s not a big deal.”** My brother interrupted me again. **“I’m not going to get in trouble because** ***you*** **were being dramatic!”** I continued trying to explain things to him, but he didn’t listen.

I told my dad about it later; he didn’t believe me either. I told my friends about it and they thought it was a joke. None believed me. Not my family, not my friends, at times I wonder if I can even believe myself.

Maybe that dog I saw outside was never actually there. Maybe that pawprint in the snow was from some random normal dog, and maybe the rest of its pawprint trail just happened to disappear for perfectly normal reasons. And maybe it was just pure coincidence that pawprint pointed straight towards her house.

But how did that pawprint appear on my door?

Why does it keep on coming back?

When I was 12 years old- I saw it again. I was home alone, walked into the kitchen- and saw it again. At this point I almost moved on. It was *exactly* 6 years since the incident, not once did I see it again. I really did start to believe I just made things up and that nothing was there. But it came back.

I walked pass by the backdoor and look outside. The same skinny grey dog with glowing white pupils is standing in the woods. It stares at me, walks behind a tree, and once again disappears for 5 years straight. And once again, none believed me.

The next time I saw it was when I was 16 years old on the day 19/12/2022. Me and my parents were all sitting in the living room and we were watching a movie before suddenly we hear a knock on the door. Not the front door, back door.

Me and my dad head to the kitchen together, and just like last time, none was there. My dad wanted to look outside but my gut feeling told me not to. **“Let’s go look tomorrow instead! It’s late.”** I didn’t expect my dad to listen to me, he usually listens to himself first, but thankfully he did. He moved towards the living room and I followed him. But right before I left the room- I turned back.

Those eyes were still there, staring right back at me before running away once again. I grabbed my dad’s arm. **“I saw it. I saw who knocked”** I stated.

**“Huh? Really?”**

**“It was the dog- the dog knocked I saw it.”**

My dad just looked at me and stood still for a split second. His expression seemed blank, almost lifeless. That was until he started to smile. **“The dog?! You’re still talking about that dog?!”** He laughed at me. **“Oh come on M! Let it go- it can’t be a dog.”** He walks away, still chuckling.

**“I saw it.”**

**“Yea sure you did.”**

**“We heard it-“**

He interrupted me. **“We’ll check it tomorrow M just like you said! Cmon Ms you’re 20 you’re too old to be making up ghost stories.”** My dad didn’t even bother to turn to look at me. He just left me in that room. It was cold, it was quiet, it was lonely. My dad heard it- and yet he didn’t believe me. Neither did my mom.

Anyways I check it out the next day and it seems the Dog didn’t forget to hide its tracks this time! Character development! There wasn’t a single pawprint this time, and there weren’t any normal footprints too.  

We all heard that knock. We all heard something from the backdoor. Yet not a single footprint was found in the snow. I thought that’d convince my parents that something was wrong- but they just assumed that all 3 of us collectively hallucinated the same noise. Because that’s normal.

I saw it when I was 8, told my family, none believed me.

I saw it when I was 12, told my family, none believed me.

I saw it when I was 16, told my family, none believed me.

They heard it this time and they *still* doubt me. It keeps on coming back and they *still* think I’m crazy. I had proof and they ignored it- something came to our house in the winter, left NO footprints behind, and they don’t care at all.

If it happened once, I would have ignored it. If it happened to me twice then maybe I was just being paranoid! But no, it happened 3 times. 3 times is too many times to be a coincidence.

Something is haunting me- or maybe something is haunting my house. I don’t know! But there’s some dog ghost out there. Or a dog demon. Like I said, I don’t know! How can I? Whenever I do see it- it just looks at me and then runs away! And for some reason only I see it I think! Maybe someone in my family *did* see it and just chose to ignore it- but I don’t know! Whenever I tried talking to them about it they dismiss me. I don’t know why they never believe me.

I hoped maybe my friends at my university would at least have some faith for me- but no. They either awkwardly agreed with me, thought I was joking, or called me stupid. I showed them the pictures too. Some of them thought it was weird but even they brushed it off.

None believes me.

I know a bunch of people here talk about their haunted phenomenon, so I was hoping that if I shared it here someone would finally believe me. I know on their own- none of these events seem haunting. But I know something is out there and I just want someone- literally anyone- to believe me.

I know what I saw was real.
