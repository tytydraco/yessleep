I found an envelope in my mailbox one afternoon. Plain white, no return address, no name, nothing. Inside was a single key, the kind that might open a padlock.

I asked around the neighborhood. Posted in our community Facebook group. Nobody knew anything about it. I tossed it in my junk drawer and moved on with my life.

Three weeks later, another envelope arrived. Same as before. Blank, anonymous. This time it contained a single sheet of paper with an address written in black ink.

That's when the unease started creeping in. I called friends, texted others, even asked my wife if this was some elaborate joke. Everyone looked at me like I was losing it. Nobody had sent me anything.

The feeling settled into my chest. That prickling sensation of being watched. I started checking over my shoulder. Scanning faces in crowds. Looking for patterns that weren't there.

I had to know what the address meant. Google Maps pulled up a self-storage facility across town. I'd never rented a unit in my life. I didn't own enough stuff to need one. Still, I got in my truck and drove over.

The place was ordinary. Rows of orange doors, some indoor units, some outdoor. No mysterious figure waiting for me. No answers. I sat in the parking lot feeling stupid, then drove home.

My mind wouldn't let it go. Was this drug-related? Had someone gotten the wrong address? Were they using my name for something illegal? The possibilities multiplied in the silence.

More weeks passed. 

Then the third envelope came.

The anger hit first, then the fear. Why wouldn't they stop? What did they want from me? My imagination spiraled. Cartels, witness protection gone wrong, elaborate revenge plots. I knew I was being irrational, but knowing didn't help.

I stood in my kitchen, staring at the envelope for twenty minutes before I opened it.

Inside was another sheet of paper. Just a number this time: 52.

Fifty-two? I turned it over in my mind. I was thirty-eight. Nobody I knew was fifty-two. It wasn't a date, it wasn't a house number or apartment number I recognized. Just fifty-two.

Then it clicked. The storage facility. The key. Unit 52.

I thought about calling the police. My mind always goes to the worst place, but this had to be a prank, right? I'd open that unit and find something ridiculous, and whoever was behind this would have their laugh.

I drove back to the facility that evening. Waited for someone to trigger the automated gate and slipped in behind them. Found unit 52 in the back corner.

The key turned smoothly.

The lock opened. 

I pulled up the door.

A teddy bear. A Nintendo Entertainment System cartridge, Super Mario Bros. 3. A big pile of mismatched socks. A photo of my girlfriend from high school. My Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles sleeping bag. My grandfather's watch, the one he pressed into my palm before he died, the one I'd torn my apartment apart looking for 5 years ago. It was all of the things I had ever lost. 

Everything. All of it. Waiting for me in the dark.

I stood there as the overhead light flickered, trying to understand what I was looking at, trying to understand who would do this, trying to understand what it meant.

I still don't know.
