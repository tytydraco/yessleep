I’m just an ordinary guy. Dead-end job, no friends or family worth mentioning, and a life that’s been going nowhere. But everything changed a year ago, and I’ve never been the same since.

It was a normal Friday evening, and I was on my way home from work when I hit a roadblock—literally. Roadworks forced me to take a detour, and just my luck, I got a flat tire. After a long, stressful week, I thought, Great. Just what I needed. I pulled over, popped the trunk, and started changing the tire.

That’s when I saw it—a glint of light catching the edge of something shiny. At first, I thought it was just some piece of trash, but when I looked closer, I saw it was a key. Old-fashioned, with a simple brass finish, no markings. It looked out of place.

I picked it up, slipped it in my pocket, and went about finishing the tire. The rest of the evening was uneventful. I got home, had a quick dinner, and went to bed, but that key stuck with me.

The next day, I woke up around noon—late, but that was nothing new. I poured a cup of coffee and sat at the kitchen table, absentmindedly picking up the key. I turned it over in my hands. It was heavy, almost too solid for something so old. It didn’t look like it belonged to anything familiar.

Out of curiosity, I decided to see if I could figure out who it belonged to. But as I looked closer, I saw no identifying marks. So, I shrugged, set it down, and finished my coffee.

Later that afternoon, boredom got the best of me. I was pacing around the house when I passed the basement door. I don’t know why, but I stuck the key in the lock, just to see what would happen. To my surprise, the lock clicked open.

I froze. That wasn’t supposed to happen. Was this some kind of prank? But I had to see what was behind the door. So I opened it.

What I saw… I can’t explain it. It was a city—a city that looked like mine but wasn’t. The skyline was similar, but the buildings were off, and the streets felt subtly wrong. I stepped into the doorway, heart pounding, and looked around.

I’ll admit it—if you had a chance to step into a whole new world, wouldn’t you? I walked out onto the street, and no one seemed to notice me at first. I stopped a passerby and asked, “Where am I?”

They stared at me like I’d lost my mind. I must’ve looked crazy. I repeated myself, but they just brushed me off and walked away. I felt a surge of panic. Am I losing it?

I tried to calm myself. This is just a weird version of my city, I thought. It can’t be real.

I found a newspaper stand and picked up a local paper. My eyes scanned the front page, and my stomach dropped. This was my city, yes, but everything in the paper was off. Shops I’d never heard of. Buildings I didn’t recognize. It didn’t make sense.

My first instinct was to get home. I knew my city well enough to navigate it by heart, even if something felt… wrong. But as I walked through the streets, I started to notice even stranger things—roads that didn’t exist, signs in languages I didn’t recognize.

Eventually, I found my street. My house. Or, I thought it was. I didn’t have my keys on me. When I had gone through the basement door, I’d forgotten to bring them. Great, I thought. I’m locked out of my own house in a city that doesn’t make sense.

Luckily, I got along well with my neighbor. I knocked on their door, hoping they’d have a spare key. But when a stranger answered, I froze.

“I’m sorry, can I speak to the owner?” I asked. “I’ve locked myself out.”

The person eyed me warily. “I’ve lived here for thirty years. The guy who lives next door is an old man. He’s never looked anything like you. Now leave, or I’ll call the cops.”

My heart sank. Something’s wrong. Really wrong.

I backed away, thinking. Then I remembered the key. It had gotten me here, so maybe it could get me home. I turned and made my way back to the city, to the door. I found it again, hidden on a quiet corner, and inserted the key.

But before I turned it, something caught my eye—a TV screen in a store window. The president was on the screen, giving a speech. But it wasn’t my president. The man on the screen wasn’t anyone I recognized.

I turned the key anyway, and stepped back through the door.

I felt a wave of relief, then disbelief. The door had led me back… but not to my house. Instead, I was in a store, surrounded by people staring at me. I looked around, but nothing made sense. The room I’d come through was gone, replaced by a sterile, unfamiliar store.

Panic surged. I turned around and spotted a bathroom. I needed to gather myself. But when I stepped inside and took out the key again, something happened. I inserted it into the bathroom door—and on the other side? A landscape. Not a store. A vast, open field.

Confused, I pulled back, but then something clicked in my mind. The key… it’s not just opening doors. It’s opening… worlds.

I tried again, and each time I opened the door, I saw a different place. A living room. A crowded mall. Then, one time, I opened the door to a dark room, a room with no windows or doors.

I turned around to see a man in a black suit standing in the center of the room. But he wasn’t human. His face was… static. It was like watching a TV with no signal—flickering and fuzzy. The figure advanced toward me.

“You’ve been meddling with things you don’t understand,” it said, its voice like a thousand voices tangled together. “Tell me everything you know about the key. Now.”

Fear clamped down on me. The thing wasn’t human, but it was something else—something ancient. And I knew I couldn’t escape unless I played along.

I answered as best as I could, my mind racing. I can’t let it know that I don’t know anything. I need to get out of here.

In my pocket, the key was still there, untouched. I felt a surge of hope. Maybe it was the only way out. But before I could think clearly, the thing lunged at me, pulling out a strange device. It looked like a knife, but it had lights and a display, like some kind of technology from another world.

It stabbed me, twice, once across my left arm. I screamed, adrenaline rushing through my veins. I grabbed the knife and plunged it into the creature’s face, shattering its flickering visage.

I ran.

I don’t know how many dimensions I passed through, but each time I opened a door, I was further away from that thing. I didn’t stop running until my body was covered in sweat, blood dripping from my arm.

When I finally stopped, I found myself in a tiny village. The people looked… strange. Like they didn’t understand the concept of hunger. When I asked where I could get food, they stared at me blankly, as if the question made no sense.

Then, one of them laughed—a cruel, echoing laugh. “You’re confused, child,” she said. “Let me show you how we get our energy.”

She looked to the sky, and her face split open, revealing a giant flower inside.

I recoiled in horror, but then, from the corner of my eye, I saw it again.

The thing.

It was following me.

I ran.

I quickly opened a door and ran through when I was hit with an intense heat like I’d stepped into the heart of a furnace. I was inside a small, unfamiliar room, sweat pouring from me, my breaths shallow with fear. I had to move. The creature, that thing I’d barely escaped, was coming through the door again. I fumbled for the key in my pocket, but before I could reach it, the door creaked open, revealing nothing but darkness on the other side.

I ran.

The other side of the room had a second door—no keyhole, just a plain wooden surface. Panic surged through me. I threw myself at it, pushing it open, and found myself in what seemed like an abandoned warehouse. The heat was stifling here too, but I barely noticed it as I scanned the vast, empty space. I couldn’t stop now. I had to find a way out before the thing found me.

I darted toward a large opening on the far side of the building, the world outside tinged with an eerie, unnatural red. It took a moment for my brain to register what I was seeing—fires, everywhere. The horizon was nothing but smoke and burning wreckage. Buildings, trees, bodies. The acrid scent of burning flesh and wood filled the air, and I had to fight the urge to collapse, to vomit. Adrenaline kept my legs moving, but the terror in my chest made every step feel heavier.

I didn’t know how long I walked. Hours, maybe. Every place I found that looked like a possible door was either burned to the ground or too dangerous to approach. The world felt endless, a suffocating nightmare, and the heat—always the heat—was making it harder to breathe. When I finally saw movement in the distance, people, my heart leapt. I staggered toward them, barely able to speak when I got close enough. All I could manage before blacking out was one word: “Water.”

I woke up tied to a chair, surrounded by people in black robes. They had their backs turned, speaking in low, harsh tones, their voices thick with purpose. Panic gripped me as I tried to understand what was happening. My body ached, my wounds still fresh from my previous encounter with the creature, but I forced myself to focus.

I asked, my voice weak, “What’s happening? Why am I tied up?”

One of them turned toward me, a figure that looked almost human, but something about the face was wrong. Too still, too cold. He stepped closer, and his whisper crawled across my skin. “Child of God, what is it you believe?”

I didn’t understand. “What? Who are you? Why am I—”

“Answer me,” he hissed, eyes flashing with a strange intensity. “What do you believe?”

I repeated my question, trying to sound more confident, though my voice shook. “What’s going on here?”

The figure took a deep breath, as if savoring the moment, before his face twisted into a sneer. “We, the sons of Lucifer, demand your faith. You will no longer be a child of God. We are as one, and we will bring about the rise of our father once more.”

I froze, not knowing what to say. I wasn’t religious—I didn’t know how to respond to something like this. But I knew I had to say something to get them to stop. “I’ll do whatever you want,” I said, my voice barely a whisper.

They laughed. A deep, mocking laugh, and the man who had spoken before shouted, “Blasphemer!”

The others repeated it, over and over, a chant that wore me down, each word digging deeper into my chest. They taunted me, called me every name under the sun, and as they did, one of them muttered in a language I didn’t recognize—Latin, maybe? I only knew English, but the sound of the words made my skin crawl.

I didn’t care anymore. I wanted out. I was exhausted—mentally, physically—and I wasn’t sure how much longer I could hold on. I pulled at my restraints, desperate to free myself, but the pain of my wounds made it almost impossible. At some point, I passed out.

I woke again to a sound—a massive crash that shook the room. The chanting had stopped. I opened my eyes, heart pounding, but the room was empty. My restraints were still in place, but the robed figures were gone. The silence was suffocating.

Another crash, closer this time, followed by a series of loud, heavy footsteps. The floor trembled under each step. My mind raced, my pulse quickening as I realized what was coming. I had to get out, had to move. I pulled at the ropes, harder now, desperation fueling me.

The sound stopped. My breath caught in my throat as I looked to my left and froze.

A monster stood there.

It was humanoid, its massive form towering over me. Dark, like a shadow, with claws long enough to tear through steel. Its teeth were jagged, gleaming, but it was its eyes that paralyzed me—black, infinite, staring into me like they could see every dark thought I’d ever had. I couldn’t look away. A rush of cold dread washed over me.

I froze.

The creature raised its hand, and with one swift motion, it slashed at my abdomen. Pain exploded across my body. Blood poured down my legs, pooling beneath me. I screamed, vision blurring, but then… nothing. The creature raised its hand again, preparing for a final blow.

I closed my eyes. There was no escape.

But nothing came.

I opened my eyes.

I was back in the same room. The same sterile, oppressive space, tied to the same damn chair. The wounds on my abdomen were gone, healed, as though they’d never been there. My mind reeled. What was happening?

And then I saw it.

A figure, standing in the corner, unmoving. The static-faced thing. The creature I had hoped to never see again.

I started crying, not out of fear but exhaustion. I had nothing left to give.

The creature’s voice, mechanical and cold, sliced through the air. “You are telling the truth, aren’t you?”

I could barely speak, my throat dry, my voice hoarse. “Yes… I’m done. I don’t care anymore. Just kill me.”

The creature didn’t move, but the voice came again, calmer now. “What would you do to get out of this alive?”

I looked up at it, disbelief flooding my veins. “What? You want me to beg? You want me to… please, just… kill me.”

There was a long pause before the creature spoke again, its voice surprisingly softer now. “I can do that. But first, I need to show you something.”

It stepped forward, and with a slow, deliberate motion, reached up to its own face. The static flickered and twisted, pulling away like a mask, revealing… me.

Another version of me.

I staggered back, mouth agape. “What the hell…?”

The other me smiled, or at least, something resembling a smile. “This is what I am,” it said. “And what I want. I want every single version of us. These cages…” It gestured around the room, and I saw them then—dozens, hundreds of cages, each containing a person in a jumpsuit and a metal mask. “These are all you, from different dimensions. And I want every one of you.”

I barely heard the rest of what it said, something about choices and freedom. The words felt like they were slipping through my fingers, fading into nothing.

“You have a choice,” the other me said, its voice cold, calculating. “You can join me and become part of my collection, or you can help me gather the others.”

A lump formed in my throat. I knew what I had to do. “I’ll help you.”

The creature nodded, pleased. “Good. You’ll use the key. Find the others, and once you do, use this.” It handed me a small device, pressing a button on it. “This will signal me. And I’ll come for them.”

I wanted to scream, to break free, but I couldn’t. “One more thing,” it said, its voice darkening. “Don’t try to run. If you do, I’ll drop you in a dimension far worse than this one.”

It opened a door, and I stepped through. A new world. A new Earth.

And now, I’m here, writing this. You need to know the truth. The creature, the other me—it’s coming for you. It’s already found my version here. I’m leaving this story behind, hoping that someone, somewhere, will listen. It’s not too late. You have to fight.

The key is the only way to stop this. You need to find it before it finds you.
