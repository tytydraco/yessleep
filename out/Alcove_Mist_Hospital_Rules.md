  

So, you have decided to work as a doctor here in Alcove Mist Hospital, I believe that the administration had already briefed you of the basics, but they did not specify about the *things* going on in here. You will receive this letter as soon as any weird occurrence has happened to you. I mean, I would know, as I received the same letter years ago when I first started working here. If you however, received this letter before any weird has happened to you, I’m sorry but you have to file a resignation immediately and never come back to this place again. The hospital did not choose you, and you do not want to know what happens if you force your stay.

If you, however, did receive this after any weird incidence took place, then follow these rules to ensure your safety and sanity within this hospital.

1. The patients admitted here are always meant to die, the *treatments* provided here are… well, let’s just say it helps to ensure that the dead would remain dead. If you see a patient trying to get out of the premises, tell security immediately and they will handle the rest. Do not let any patient out under any circumstances.

2. All patients within the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) follow the same routine on their last days “alive”:

   2.1. On the first 5 days of their stay, a reddish-brown liquid, resembling a mixture of phlegm and feces will always appear on their bedsheets. It is imperative to put these sheets away and replace them immediately whenever you see them, even if the patient is not within your rounds or even if you have already checked out for the day/night. Breaking this rule would not result to anything drastic, but it does keep the hospital from smelling too bad.

   2.2. For the next 3 days, patients would start to hallucinate, even if they are in a vegetative state. They would speak in gibberish, but staff noted that it sounds like a combination of Latin and German, though no coherent words can be understood. If you are in a room with a patient that started to speak in tongues, cover your ears immediately. Do not listen to anything that they are saying, no matter how enticing it sounds. The last doctor who listened was next to be admitted in this hospital.

  2.3. Patients always die on the 10th day, if by any means that the patient is still alive by 12:00 midnight of the 11th day, shoot the patient in the head using the designated firearm on the lowermost drawer of their bedside cabinet. Report to the nurses immediately after this. Do not let any patient survive after the 10th day, just… do not.

   2.4. If any patient did not follow these same steps, report to Dr. Halley immediately, assist her in handling the patient and do whatever she asks you to do.

3. Each hallway is named after a letter in the alphabet, if you stumble upon a hallway bearing a different name other than a letter in the alphabet, or a hallway with no name at all, stay still and close your eyes for 15 seconds, count in your head if you must. After 15 seconds, open your eyes and check for the hallway’s name.

   3.1. If it is a letter-named hallway, proceed wherever you need to go. But do it immediately, you wouldn’t want to stay for too long here if these happens.

   3.2. If it is a named hallway but not from the alphabet, go inside any room. There would be at least one open room in any hallway, force your way in if necessary. Once inside, close all lights and hide. Page the nurses about where you are, wait for them to find you, and remember to set a password for them to know that they are really the ones knocking on your door. Whenever someone asks for you to open the door, ask them for your password, if they say anything other than your password, respectfully decline to open the door. They will get insistent, but do not falter, keep waiting until the nurses arrive and escort you out of the hallway.

   3.3. If it’s a blank hallway, turn back and run as fast as you can. Run until you reach a letter-named hallway. Do not however, go outside of the hospital vicinity, you are not where you think you are.

4. Dr. Evans is the chief doctor of this hospital, you will only see him in the cafeteria though. Interact with him, he is quite nice to new faces in the hospital. If he likes you, he will give you a coin, always keep that coin in your person, it will provide protection in some way that I cannot really explain. If he didn’t like you however, he will cut you off in the conversation and walk away, do not follow him and never go to the cafeteria ever again.

5. At 3:00 A.M. the speakers would always play a prayer. This prayer does not belong to any known religion and would always sound intelligible. Once you hear these sounds coming from the speakers, stand still and bow your head. Your environment might seem to shift but do not pay it any attention, they will try their best to distract you and make you look up. If you looked up while this is happening, strengthen your mind as you will need it for what you are about to see.

6. The 3rd floor is out of bounds, under no circumstance must you bring yourself on that floor. Skip the room that you were designated from this floor, continue to refuse even if the staff gets mad at you or if the administration threatens to terminate your contract, they will eventually reassign the room to another doctor. But do not tell the newly assigned doctor about the 3rd floor, everyone should know that it is out of bounds. Saying anything about the 3rd floor to another doctor would make the administration force you to take the room on that floor, good luck if that happens.

7. Once every 16 months, an event called \[REDACTED\] occurs in the hospital. Whenever this happens, the hospital will go on a lockdown, and everyone inside must stay for at least \[REDACTED\] hours after the event initiates. Locate the nearest \[REDACTED\] and hide there for the duration of the event, ignore all sounds coming from outside. Do not look outside. Do not go outside. 

8. If you ever encounter an individual named “Dr. Luis” or “Dr. Landon” he will ask you for someone:

   8.1. If he asked for a patient, direct them to the correct room. Let him walk in front of you, do not turn your back away from him. Do not break your line of sight with him until he goes in the room and closes the door. Do not enter in the room with him. Do not investigate what he will do to the patient. 

   8.2. If he asked for another doctor, direct him outside of the hospital. Do not tell him that you are escorting him out, though. Try to make it look like you are directing him to the correct room, run in circles if necessary as long as you could get him out of the hospital. Let him walk in front of you, and do not break your line of sight with him until he leaves the hospital’s premises. Once he’s out, lock the hospital doors, he might try to come back in but try your best to stop him. You do not want him to come back in again.

   8.3. If he asked for Dr. Evans, tell him that he is in the cafeteria. He would thank you and go on his way. Get out of the hospital immediately.

   8.4. If he asked for anyone else other than those three mentioned above, run away as fast as you can. Do not look back at him, just run until you can’t hear his ungodly screams anymore.

9. Always take the elevators in the morning, and the stairs at night. Never use them in a different time, you will be transported somewhere far from this world. Do not break this rule as it takes an enormous amount of effort and resources to locate individuals who have wandered there to the point that the administration just stopped trying to find them. If you find yourself using the stairs in the morning, or the elevators at night, then you are as good as dead.

10. If you break the first rule, burn the whole hospital to the ground. I know it sounds difficult and tedious, but please, end our suffering.

That’s it, this pretty much sums up everything that you need to know to work here in Alcove Mist Hospital, even with its bizarre rules, it is quite nice working here (and the pay sure is good too). I hope I see you around as a doctor still, it is always such a pain to see newcomers turn into one of the patients in the beds.
