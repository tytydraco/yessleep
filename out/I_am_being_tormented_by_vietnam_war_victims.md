I am a Vietnam war fanatic. Although I am not american, I feel a strange awe when learning about the Vietnam war. My country did participate in the war, since I am Australian but I do not feel any patriotic sentiments about it. I grew up watching Platoon and Apocalypse Now but even then I don't feel like my obsession with Vietnam boils down to my liking of movies. I don't know how to describe it, a compulsion to learn? To know about the land? To know about the  many lifes that were lost in those wars? Now, I just accept it: my fate is in those lands. My destiny is to be consumed by matters of the past, even when I wasn't even there. The french, the vietnamese, every single people who roamed those lands I feel connected to. But I am not those people and I wasn't there.

When I announced that I was going to Vietnam for a trip to my mother three years ago she reacted like I was actually going to the war itself. What would me - a 28 year old who owns a small business in  western Australia - do in Vietnam? Is what they asked, but they did not see all my posters in my room. They didn't see me watching countless hours of documentaries, read hundreds of books and my time researching into the topic. I needed to go there. I needed to see the place that haunted me, that made me feel alive. "The war in Vietnam was unlike any other wars" I would say in response to them. "It was a war that was fought in the humid jungles, like a blistering inferno of blaze and water. Like when you want to get a sip of the water right in front of you but you cannot taste it."

 Inferno it was indeed. But not my trip to Vietnam. That was enjoyable, I was having the time of my life i would even say. It was like finally seeing that girl you always dreamed of and you had her in your mind your entire life but now she is with you. I never had a romantic experience like that but Vietnam was that for me. It was my dream and I was there. I went to all the historical locations near Ho Chi Minh City (Saigon) and traveled for a couple of locations near it. I bought a lot of souvenirs. Some related to the war and some not. But they were real. I didn't buy any of the plastic crap a normal tourist would buy. I went to the villages and bought it off the people. Because I wanted Vietnam to go home back with me.

I returned home after three weeks of travel with a bag of items that now decorated my room. It did a lot of things for me. I was finally happy, complete. But my obsession did not stop. I went out looking for Vietnam. It became an addiction. It is probably hard to explain this to someone who doesn't have an obsession but I was it. Just like Shakespeare was poetry and Da Vinci was painting, I was Vietnam. But now, now I wish I wasn't. A lot of time passed since my visit to Vietnam. My mother died during that time by the way. Not that it is important but I thought I should mention it. Oh and I moved houses. Anyway, what really matters and is the reason as to why i am writing this is that about two month ago I started seeing them figures.

It all started when I began to wake everyday at 4 o'clock in the morning. Sometimes 4:15, 4:12, 4:10 but always around that time. It was almost like my body would wake itself up around that time. I never had any nightmares and dreams, I just woke up. And one night, I saw a girl in my bed. She was not a girl, more like a woman. Like in a state between the two you know? Not a teenager either, I am just saying that she was both of it. A woman and a girl, with those eyes of innocence but the body of adulthood. She was standing in my bedroom door. Not very close, far away in the dark but I could see her. I stood up and failed to recognize her at first, when I saw her figure I went straight to the light. But in a calm manner. Yes, my heart was fast but I didn't feel any fear or ansgt. When I flickered the light she was gone like I was hallucinating it all along. She would come back to me a few times that week, sometimes during the day at broad daylight.

 But I really started having doubts about my sanity when I saw a man in my kitchen the day after the bed incident. He had village clothes and a normal body but his behavior is what made me fearful. He hid after my oven. I thought I was beginning to show signs of schizophrenia. I told my friends they did not help in anyway. I went out for a doctor in Perth and he gave me some pills thankfully but they did not stop appearing. There was now a whole group of them. There was the sweet girl, the man who hid, the man who has a beard, the old man who wears a thong, the small infant girl and of course the mother. 

You must imagine that it must be pretty bad having these sightings, seeing actual dead people, right? Well, not considering that I don't actually see them. They are actually drilled into my head, inside of my mind, reading my thoughts and appearing towards me like a daydream and a nightmare combined with physical reality. No, it is not that bad. Because they do not actually do anything, they do not talk and some of them even have a conforting presence (like the girl from the bed encounter). But then I started seeing her, mother. She screams, she is not like the others. I think she is in hell. I lock my door so that I do not see her and I beg my friends to sleep at their houses but even then I sleep alone so it is not that confortable because she can appear. She moans, she yells and she drags that "thing" with her. 

I call her mother, because she has a baby still stuck with an unbilical cord into her uterus and it is dead. She carries it, its corpse. Sometimes with her hands, sometimes with none of her hands. She is naked and burned. One time she appeared next to me in bed. Handing her baby towards my legs. And just staring until I woke up. When I woke up she screamed and I fought with her.  I escaped and she disappeared. Couldn't sleep for the rest of the night and had to go for a pub somewhere. 

I saw her yesterday, when I was driving around town. I felt sorry for her, I feel sorry for them all. She was carrying her baby in the crosswalk and into the wilderness. Like she was searching for something. 

Today, I write this. I write it because I can't do it anymore. I tried everything. I got rid of all the Vietnam stuff. I go to church. I pray. I took those damn pills and I still do. But nothing happens. They won't go. Maybe I am paying for my sins. For being obsessed with history, with the bloody war. For being interested in violence in a purely historical viewpoint. 

I must end it all for I saw a new one a couple of hours ago. It was an european dressed in white ropes, not vietnamese like the others. What if he is an american? What if he talks? It could be one of the french but I have never been so afraid. They all look so sad. Some of them have scars, wounds, but others are completely intact. Like they are in heaven, but sad. God, if I end it all will they welcome me? Will I become just like them? Or should I just wait it out, but then what if another "mother" comes along? I must end the suffering at once. That was my destiny.
