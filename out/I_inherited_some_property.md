Reaching over I opened my glove box. Fishing out a pack of battered and stale Marlboro Reds I placed one between my lips and lit it. 

I inhaled the toxic chemical concoction. It soothed my nerves and tickled that part of my brain that craved nicotine despite more or less quitting a year prior. 

The rifle felt good in my hands, heavy and solid. .308 if I wasn’t mistaken, 20 round magazine with 13 shots left. Not great but it would have to do. Having finished my cigarette I tried the ignition. To my surprise the truck started. 

I put it in gear and continued down the mountain road. I knew the noise might attract more of those things but I wanted to reach [Lucy’s](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/BB8OdcJo9v) car as fast as possible. She had already been out all night alone and who knew if those things had found her. 

The trucks four flat tires made navigating the rough road as difficult as riding a unicycle down a cobblestone path in the ice. 

With two hands firmly gripping the wheel I turned a particularly sharp corner and nearly hit Lucy’s car. The truck stopped in a cloud of sweet smelling steam. The engine had developed a fatal knock this time. 

With the truck turned off I listened carefully before exiting the false security of the cab. Birds sang in the trees around me, the sun was out and welcoming. Save for the hiss of my overheated truck one could convince themselves that all was fine. 

Knowing better I went to Lucy’s car. The white Audi looked entirely unharmed. I noted the open driver’s door, no damage though. Lucy had left the vehicle willingly, or at least it appeared so. 

Inside was another story, the drivers seat had a large amount of mud on it. The interior stank horribly. The keys were in the cup holder. I pressed the start button and the engine came to life with a quiet purr. 

I turned it back off, right behind the Audi lay a mid sized tree. With enough momentum the car might be able to get over it but there was no guarantees it would survive. I decided that would be a problem for later, first I needed to find Lucy. 

Now I’m no tracker, I hunted some as a teenager but nothing that would have prepared me for something like this. 

Luck happened to be on my side, the wet ground had clear boot prints leading into the woods heading in a northern direction. Even a novice like me could tell by the spacing that Lucy had been running when she left her car. 

Tall ferns grew under the towering evergreens obscuring my line of sight. The air filled with their scent as I pushed my way through. The constant cracking of dead branches under my boots had me in edge, anything within a dozen yards would hear me coming. 

Lucy’s trail grew hard to follow after just a couple minutes, the soft blanket of pine needles left no foot prints. With nothing more then broken stems and kicked up soil I felt like I was doing little more than guessing. 

I had been traveling for an hour before I got solid confirmation. A small log lay half submerged in moss, on the far side of it were two distinct hands prints in the dirt. Lucy had tripped over the camouflaged trunk in the night and had fallen to her hands and knees. 

With renewed hope I pressed on. An unforeseen annoyance was all the spider webs. They hung invisible waiting to snare my face in their sticky tendrils. 

As mid day approached I was once again doubting myself. It was when I paused to assess my position that I heard the trickle of nearby water. I took my knife and marked the trunk of the nearest tree so I could find where I left off. 

I needed a drink desperately, I hadn’t realized until now just how long it had been since I had eaten or drank. I followed the sound, a small brook flowed down hill nearby. The water was clear and crisp. 

After drinking my fill I was about to rise when the feeling of being watched came over me. I scanned the forest, my crouched position didn’t give me a decent view but I didn’t want to stand up just yet. 

My leg twitched and I felt a cramp coming on, so much for holding still. I slowly rose, my hands gripping the rifle firmly. The sun peeked out from behind the heavy clouds illuminating the forest floor. 

Something in the distance hissed loudly, I heard the snapping of branches and pig like grunting. I had the rifle butted up to my shoulder instantly. I scanned the area I thought the sound came from. 

Nothing moved, the woods were still. The birds had vanished along with any insects. The only sound was that of the gurgling brook behind me. The hair on the back of my neck prickled. I wanted something to happen, anything to break this stalemate between me and the unknown entity in the trees. 

Sweat began stinging my eye, I didn’t dare lift my hand from the rifle to wipe my brow. Ever so cautiously I took a step backwards. I followed it with another, I didn’t care when my boot filled with water from the brook. 

Only when it had been twenty minutes without another sound and I had gained a decent distance between myself and the brook did I breath easy. 

In my mind I had known the woods were dangerous, but the uneventful morning had caused me to drop my guard. That would not happen again. 

But now I had lost Lucy’s trail, I would have to cross the brook again in order to find it once more. Not willing to make things easy for the beasts I walked down the mountain a ways before cutting across. It didn’t take me long to find the trail again as I had my previous tracks to follow as well. 

Once again I began the painstakingly slow process of deciphering where Lucy had gone. I would have to constantly back track after missing a tiny detail. I was so focused on my job at hand and on looking out for any hostile animals that I didn’t notice I was circling back towards the road. 

I was in a virgin area, I hadn’t walked through there before but I was definitely facing towards the road now. My self doubt started to grow, had I involuntarily turned around? Or had Lucy made a big circle in hopes of returning to her car? 

Having no other easily discernable choice I pushed onward. I soon found myself walking along a jagged gully, the earthen crack was too wide and too deep to be crossed without a lot of difficulty. Unfortunately the ground alongside it was hard packed dirt and rock. 

I followed it north for a distance but found no signs Lucy had gone that way. Turning around I went south an equal distance without any luck. I knew it was a hail Mary but the road was to the north so I started in that direction once again. To my elation I found a clear boot print in the dirt just a few yards past where I had turned around previously. 

In the back of my mind I was very aware of the sun’s trajectory. I needed to pick up the pace or else I would be spending the night out here. And that was not an option. 

I knew moving at a brisk walk would be risky, I might pass up a vital clue. But I was not willing to end up as monster chow. The increased speed seemed to play directly into my growing paranoia, I felt watched. I thought I heard the scuff of nails on rock. 

My body wanted me to run, to escape the unseen danger. I willed myself not to. I had to concentrate on remaining calm, my heart rate had already grown and I was sweating again. 

This was not a good place, it was then that I noticed the lack of animals. No squirrels or birds. Just an awful odor rising up from the gully. An odor reminiscent of a wet dog and carrion. 

My resolve to find Lucy was weakening, what good would I do her dead? I had my doubts as to the honesty of the sheriff’s department. Would they even report her missing if I didn’t? Would I be doing more good leaving the area and getting a large group of people to help search? 

Leaving was easy to justify, it was logical even.  Rain began to softly patter onto the ground. The cool liquid running down my back was a welcome discomfort. The clouds that brought the rain darkened the air considerably. It felt much nearer to dusk than I liked. 

I paused, my eyes attracted to the possible movement ahead. Brush obscured my line of sight but… no there it was again! Something was moving, it was a pale tan. Instinctively I dropped to a crouch. 

There was a gap between two trees in the direction the thing was traveling. I raised the rifle into a ready position. 

The thing was moving slowly and deliberately, it was silent as I tracked its cautious progress. The tiniest glimpses of color were all I had to go off of. It approached the gap, I readied myself for my first chance to see one of these things clearly. 

It paused at the gap, almost as if sensing my presence. A small patch of color was visible through the ferns. I debated putting a round into it while I still could. It shifted and I lost my visual. 

A bit of brown hair crept past the tree, it was nearly five feet off the ground. I hesitated, something wasn’t right. I lowered the rifle just as pale human face turned in my direction. 

I made direct eye contact with her, Lucy looked at me with disbelief. She stepped out from behind the tree. The once white button up she wore was soiled with dirt and green streaks. Her jeans were torn at the knees, she looked like she had gone through hell. 

She waved me over unwilling to leave the cover of the trees. I glanced in each direction before jogging to her. We both crouched low, Lucy whispered cautiously, “Clint what are you doing here? And how did you get a gun? You’re on probation!” 

I didn’t have time to be annoyed, the sun was getting low and with it the temperature was dropping. Neither of us were dressed for a night in the woods, especially not now that our clothes were soaked in rain water. 

“Really? That’s what you’re worried about? It doesn’t matter, you called and I’m here. Now let’s get off this mountain before dark”. 

The direction the road lay in was thick and uneven. I wasn’t willing to linger any longer, brushing the wet leaves aside I moved forward. 

Lucy stayed close, her sneakers nearly silent compared to my own steps. She pressed a hand onto my back, I glanced back. Lucy wiped the wet hair from her face then pointed to a game trail I had missed. She spoke in a low yet clear whisper, “we’re being too loud. Let’s gets out of the undergrowth”. 

Her logic was sound, we replaced the cracking of sticks with the squelching of mud. I had to bend low as the brambles above pulled at my clothing. The thought of how easy it would be for something to reach out and drag one of us to our deaths crept into my mind. 

I tried to clear my head, something I couldn’t ignore was the lack of light. I was able to convince myself for a while that it was just the foliage blocking out the sun but I couldn’t ignore how hard it was becoming to see. 

I could feel Lucy shivering behind me and I knew I would be joining her soon. The rain had slowed to scattered showers but the icy droplets were sapping away our body heat. 

I didn’t know our exact location, we had to be a few miles from the vehicles. Even reaching them would only give us some shelter, they would not guarantee escape. 

The cabin and the barn had to be somewhere to our left, it could be closer than the cars but I was not sure of their location in relation to our own. I paused, we had gone down in elevation quite a bit. The buildings were likely farther away than I thought.

The gully was now more of a rock wall, the jagged stones stuck out at random angles. But in the midst of the rocks lay a black abyss. A cave of unknown depth sat a dozen yards to our left. 

The thought of staying the night gave me the creeps, but I could feel my flesh stiffening with the cold. Lucy was likely worse off than I was. I looked back at her, she stood there shaking, her head hung low. 

The cave was barely visible, the rain had begun again and with it came a cold wind. 

I took Lucy by the arm and led her to the shelter, I would have killed for a decent flashlight. The cave floor was dry dirt, it smelled like a damp crawlspace. The top hung too low to stand under but it appeared to grow higher as it drew a bit deeper. 

Using the light on my phone I explored a bit farther, large piles of dead leaves lined a wall undoubtedly blown in by the wind. I felt that warmth was our biggest priority. 

Using my fingers like a rake I scraped together a pile of leaves and twigs, there were a few larger branches but not a lot. I gathered what I could then held the flame of my lighter to the pile. The little spark of warmth licked greedily at the dry fuel.

Blowing and seeing the embers glow gave me some hope, gently I fed the little flame. Little by little I increased the size of the fuel until I had something that produced heat. 

Lucy dropped a bundle of sticks next to my fire, I hadn’t even noticed her absence. The rain outside turned into a torrent, the wind whipping it to and fro. 

Lucy sat in silence just staring into the fire, the way her hair was plastered to her head and the slump of her shoulders made her appear tiny and lost. 

I didn’t know what to say so I said nothing. Steam rose from our clothing, for the first time that day I felt comfortable. I shouldn’t have let my guard down. 

Movement caught my eye just as something charged through the caves mouth and slammed into me! It was slippery from the rain, I could feel its tense muscles flex and move as it crushed me into the cave floor. 

I lost my grip on the rifle as I was rolled onto my back by the mound of murderous flesh. The animal was enormous, it’s skin was covered in tiny prickly black hairs that poked into my skin as I beat at the beast. 

Claws sank deep into my side, I screamed as the tips grazed my ribs. Pain exploded inside me muffling the bang of a rifle. The beast pulled itself free and dashed back into the night. 

Lucy stood with the rifle in hand, her dark silhouette in stark contrast to the lighting lit sky behind her. 

Liquid fire coursed through my body, each puncture wound the origin of new found torment. I writhed in agony on the cave floor.

I had lost control of my body. It moved about of its own will. Lucy stood above me motionless. Terror filled me as I saw a creature not of this earth rise up behind her. Its jaw unhinged like that of a snake. 

It was as if a life like mannequin had replaced Lucy, she stood unnaturally still. Water flew from the beast as it struck, its movement faster than the eye could comprehend. Lucy’s entire head down to her chest was inside its mouth. 

My body felt as though it were submerged in a thick rubber. My every move was slow and laborious. I could only watch in horror as the creature bit down. 

Lucy kicked her legs as she was lifted from the ground. Teeth too blunt to easily pierce flesh sank into her. She screamed as her collar bone snapped, the white glinting in the fire light as the ends burst through her skin. 

The grinding of teeth filled the cave. Her screams echoed back. 

I felt as if time had stopped, Lucy’s head was all but severed. Yet she screamed unimpeded. I would never forgive myself if I was wrong about this. But I knew the feeling all to well to ignore it.

My phone was not in my pocket so I tried to count. I couldn’t get the numbers in the proper sequence. 

I needed to wake up. This wasn’t real.

My eyes focused and the world came rushing back to me. Lucy had a tight grip on the collar of my shirt, the rifle in her other hand. She was pulling me deeper into the cave. “Come on Clint! I can’t drag your ass and shoot!” 

My wound still hurt but my head was growing more clear with each passing minute. I got to my feet, Lucy shoved the rifle into my arms. “Let’s go, I feel like those things are going to come back”. All I could muster was a weak nod in reply. 

The cave spun slightly but I made do. Lucy led the way. Like the hands of tormented souls roots reached out and tore at our clothes. The floor was hard yet covered with a thin layer of sand. Occasionally an icy drip of water would fall down the back of my neck. Thick damp dirt clung to our clothes as we brushed the walls.

“What happened back there?” Lucy asked without looking towards me. I was hunched over now as the ceiling had grown lower. “They have a toxin on their claws. At least that’s what the deputy told me. It’s a hell of a drug”. 

Lucy stopped abruptly nearly causing me to run into her, “and how would they about that?” she asked. I shrugged, “I got the feeling they knew about these things already”. I told her about my encounter the day before. 

“That doesn’t make any sense, you’re acting like they knew these things were up here”. Her voice was laced with disbelief. As I was about to reply I cracked my head on a low hanging rock, “damnit, yeah they knew. Or at least some did”. 

Lucy shook her head, “that doesn’t make any sense”. She stopped, with her back still to me she asked, “are they dead?” 

I couldn’t read her body language, something had changed in her demeanor but I couldn’t tell what. 

“I’m not sure” I answered honestly, “two of them went after the sheriff’s and the other two last I saw were in the barn waiting for backup”. 

“That’s suspiciously convenient. If their bodies turn up you could easily blame the creatures. And now you have the last loose end secluded in a cave”. I didn’t like the turn this conversation had taken. 

“Hey you asked me to come out here, you called me saying you needed help”. Lucy turned to face me, her eyes lit up with anger. “Don’t you try and gaslight me Clint. I never asked you to come out here, I called you because you had half the sheriff’s department at your house just a couple miles from me. I called everyone’s phones but it just so happens only you were able to get my message!” 

I was dumbfounded. It had not occurred to me just how suspicious this all must have looked from the outside. It was fantastical in reality, I had just accepted it because I needed to in order to survive. But Lucy hadn’t seen everything I had. 

She continued her rant, “I don’t know you Clint, why would I tell a stranger to come help me? That I’m alone in the woods without cell service? I thought you would tell the deputies and they would come, but then you just so happen to find me way out in the woods and there’s no deputies in sight”. 

She had an excellent point. I rubbed the welt on my head and sighed, “ok. I get it. I don’t have any nefarious intentions, I assumed more than I should have. I’m sorry, I know words can’t make you trust me but that’s all I have to offer”. 

It didn't look like she believed me at all. But she didn’t say anything else, rather she continued deeper into the cave. I followed at a bit more of a distance, my mind swaying between feeling insulted and feeling guilty. 

My shoulders began to brush the sides of the cave, I felt the weight of the earth above us as we pushed farther in. Lucy let out a pained yelp, “what is it?” I asked while trying to catch up. 

“It goes up, straight up there”. I couldn’t see what she was pointing to. With no hesitation Lucy climbed what I could now see was a ladder imbedded into the cave wall. 

A followed close behind, I ignored the dirt from her shoes falling onto me. I didn’t want her to get too far ahead. 

The narrow passage led into a large room. Lucy gagged at the smell permeating the area. It was nauseating, it felt thick. 

Lucy held her phone high shining the light, its pale white beam illuminated the setting of any sane person’s nightmare. Along the edge of the room lay piles of cloth and nests of bones. 

The smell was not coming from the rotting flesh though. No it came from the dozen or so dog sized creatures watching us. 

They had a dark brown skin with a small amount of black hair. Similar to what you would find on a pig. Their snouts were short, even as adolescents they had mouths filled with teeth including canines that hung from their jaws. Each hand like paw had four fingers, each of which ended in a hooked talon. 

They growled deeply at us. Some of the braver ones drawing closer. Lucy stomped her foot and yelled causing them to all scurrying back to their grotesque nests. 

But something else yelled back, it was down what I could now see was at least a dozen much larger tunnels. Lucy’s face turned white at the sound as I’m sure did mine. 

The ladder continued up, I could see a wooden hatch above us. I threw the rifle into Lucy’s hands then climbed the ladder. The rungs were made of rusty rebar that dug into my hands. 

Reaching the top I slammed my fist into the hatch. It was a solid piece of wood with no give. I tried again and again, below me gun shots rang out. Suddenly there was a cacophony of screams and growls from every tunnel. 

Lucy looked up at me terror written across her face. She sent a few more rounds down the tunnels, one of which elicited a pained scream.

Planting my shoulder against the hatch I pressed with all my might. I prayed the rung I stood on would hold. The wood creaked in protest for a couple inches before popping open fully. I nearly flew through the opening. 

Below me Lucy fired off the last shot in the rifle. She threw the gun to the side and leapt for the ladder. She climbed with a terror fueled speed to the top. I slammed the hatch shut. 

We were in my cabin, those things had been living under my cabin! 

They were not happy, I took Lucy’s hand and drug her out of the cabin just as the hatch began to bounce from the impacts. 

“We can’t stay here!” I yelled as I ran for the barn. The barn door swung open, Zane held it in place as we rushed inside. 

As I crossed the threshold my eyes struggled to adjust to the dark interior. Slivers of dust filled sunlight streaked throughout the barn illuminating someone at the back. Right then my skull exploded in pain, my knees dug into the soft dirt that made up the barn floor. 

In the distance I heard the muffled screams of Lucy. I pushed up from the dirt, my vision reduced to a small circle directly in front of me. Everything sounded muffled, another blow struck my head. 

I lay with my face against the earth smelling the old straw and moist soil. 

I opened my eyes to find my arms painfully tied to the rough log posts that held up the barn. A coppery taste filled my mouth. My brain pulsed painfully against my forehead with each beat of my heart.

Nearby, garbled and incoherent voices were speaking. My thoughts slipped from my mind like the creek bottom mud I played with as a kid. As they slid between my mental fingers they left a residue, a hint. 

The woods, I had been in the woods. I was in my barn! I had been hit, by who? Where was Lucy? 

The voices behind me grew discernable, Lucy was speaking. It sounded like she was trying to talk through sobs. Fear. She was scared. 

Zane was speaking as well, “it’s ok, it’s ok. Everything is ok, calm down Lucy”. 

The only reply he got was more sobs, something was definitely not ok. A boot kicked my leg, “about time you wake up asshole”. I looked up into the smug face of sheriff Les Carlyle.

His portly cheeks bore fresh cuts and he was missing his hat and glasses. He spoke again, “you really messed up. The big boys are involved now, they don’t like having to come up here. You’re going to wish you had packed up and left on day one”. 

I didn’t know what he meant, but I felt like I wouldn’t survive it. He walked behind me to where the other had to have been standing. “Would you shut that bitch up? god she’s annoying, put a cock in it before I put a bullet between her eyes”. 

While crude he seemed to have gotten his point across as Lucy quieted herself. 

I gritted my teeth, it was going to be painful but I needed to be free from the ropes tied to my wrists. 

Wrapping my fingers around my thumbs I applied pressure, I continued to apply pressure ignoring the explosion of pain. With an audible pop my thumbs dislocated from their sockets. 

I held in a gasp of agony. I pulled at the ropes, they cut into my skin. The blood acted as a lubricant and the wet bonds fell to the ground. 

I cradled my hands against myself, praying I had enough time to recover. With my joints in their proper locations I turned and rose to my feet. 

What I saw before my broke reality. He stood double my height, his appearance that of someone robbed but somehow I knew he wore no clothes. His arms had a disproportionate length to them. They ended in a small hand with which three thick yet sharp fingers sprouted. 

Two of the fingers on his left hand were buried to their knuckles in Lucy’s eye sockets. Blood and a white fluid leaked from the vacant holes onto the third finger that had parted her once vibrant lips and pierced the roof of her mouth. 

The man creature screamed although I don’t know how for it’s pale blank face had no mouth. With a flick of its backwards facing elbow it threw the limp body of Lucy across the barn. Her corpse struck the back wall and fell to the ground in a life less pile. 

I had only a second to take in the scene, a creature not from this world charging towards me. A fat sheriff laughing at Lucy’s demise, Murdock looking up from tending to a wounded Anderson. Zane, mouth open in horror. Johnson to my left reaching for his rifle. 

I caught the barrel of Johnson’s rifle as it lined up with my head. With a twist of my torso I simultaneously removed my head from the impact zone and yanked the rifle from Johnson’s grip. 

The idiot had been gripping the trigger though, as I pulled the rifle he fired off a round. The explosion directly next to my head felt like a fist full of needles being driven directly into my inner ear. 

The barn grew silent, the humanoid abomination wobbled before collapsing to the floor. 

I drove the butt of the rifle into Johnson’s face, his nose erupting with chunky bits of cartilage and blood. He stumbled backwards and I struck him again, this time harder. His head snapped back and he didn’t recover. 

With the rifle against my shoulder I swept it back and forth across the remaining four men. The Sheriff’s face had gone from red with mirth to pale and back to red but this time colored by rage. 

“You stupid cow diddling son of a whore! You’ve ruined it!” He took a step towards me and I let loose a warning shot, it was closer then I had intended. The bullet clipped his ear and he stopped in his tracks. 

“You killed her! You stood by and let her die!” I yelled at them. The Sheriff scoffed, “that’s not on us boy, she never would have been up here if you hadn’t started all that trouble. But that’s just par for the course isn’t is Sonny? A dishonorable discharge, felony assault with a deadly weapon. And all that money wasted on IVF? You’ve always been a worthless mess up, what’s one more mistake in a lifetime of failure?” 

It caught me off guard, he had done his research. But it wasn’t enough for me to miss him going for his sidearm. The recoil of the rifle was easily manageable, almost as if on instinct I placed two rounds into the center of his chest and a third between his eyes. 

The fat bastard wobbled for a moment before collapsing. Zane threw his hands up letting his own rifle fall, “I don’t want none Walker! I’m out!” 

His life was saved by Murdock reaching towards the Sheriff’s pistol. I dumped four rounds center mass and in the ensuing chaos ducked out the door. 

There was movement in the house but I had no intention of investigating. I was done with this place, the hell with all of it. 

The wet road was slick beneath my feet, I welcomed the rain though. I felt it washing the blood from head wound, lightning cracked across the sky and with it came sheets of water. 

I feared those subterranean creatures would be close behind. Sooner them expected I came across the mangled remains of the police cruisers. An idea sprouted, I would need to work fast. 

Going to the car sitting on it’s side I fired a round into it’s exposed gas tank. The smelly liquid poured out of the hole. 

It was raining but this was still California and the woods had a dryness to them. I did my best to spread the fuel, I felt as though I was being watched. It didn’t matter if the eyes on me were human or not as nothing on this mountain wanted me to remain alive. 

Satisfied with my work I took my trusty lighter and held it’s tiny flame to the trail I had created. It leapt to ignite the gasoline, with a whoosh both cars were enveloped in flame. As I had hoped the nearby brush caught as well. 

I fled leaving my handiwork, behind me the flames grew higher than the horizon. It was no doubt my imagination but I like to think I heard the screams of those things burning alive. 

I made it off the mountain, I shaved my beard and have been on the run since. The official story is that I lured Lucy out to the property and when the police arrived I opened fire on them. A stay bullet started a forest fire and I managed to escape. 

It took awhile to get somewhere that I felt safe enough to post this. So I as I sit here with a plate of tacos and a bottle of tequila I warn you, stay away from Mount Shasta.
