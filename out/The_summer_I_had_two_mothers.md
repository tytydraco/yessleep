I don’t know if writing this is a good idea. I’ve gone over it in my head a thousand times, and every single time, I come to the same conclusion: telling people will just make me sound crazy. But the alternative, keeping it locked inside me forever, feels like it’s starting to corrode me from the inside out. It’s been twenty-five years, and I’m afraid. I’m afraid I’m starting to forget the details that matter, and worse, I’m afraid I’m starting to be pulled back.

My name is Emma. I’m 34 years old, I have a decent job in accounting, a small apartment in the city, and what most people would consider a very normal, very boring life. I like it that way. I’ve worked hard for boring.

But for the past few months, the nightmares have come back. They’re always the same. I’m standing in a field of wheat, the stalks taller than I am, golden and dry under a searingly white sun. The air is dead still, not a single breeze. And in the distance, I can see the house. The old farmhouse. My childhood home. I know in the dream, with a certainty that freezes my blood, that I have to go back inside. I always wake up just as my hand touches the peeling paint of the front door.

I’m writing this because the pull isn’t just in my dreams anymore. It’s a waking urge, a constant hum in the back of my mind. A little voice that tells me I need to go back to that house in rural Kansas. I need to see it one more time. I feel like if I don’t, something terrible will happen. But I feel like if I do, it’ll be even worse. So, I’m making a record. Just in case. If I go, and I don’t come back, I want someone to know why. I want someone to know what happened in that house.

I was born there. Lived there until I was sixteen with my mother. My father was never in the picture; Mom said he was a “brief and regrettable chapter” and that was the end of it. It was always just the two of us. And the house.

It was a classic American farmhouse, two stories with a wraparound porch and white paint that had been surrendering to the elements for decades. It stood alone on a hundred acres of land, most of it wheat fields that my mom leased to a bigger commercial farm. Our closest neighbor was two miles down a gravel road. The isolation was absolute. At night, the only light came from our windows and the moon. The only sounds were the wind whistling through the eaves and the chirping of a million cicadas.

Even as a very little kid, I knew something was wrong with the house. It wasn't just the normal childhood fears of monsters under the bed, though I had those too. It was something deeper. A feeling. Like the air was thicker in certain rooms. Like the shadows in the corners of your eyes weren’t just tricks of the light. I used to think the house was breathing. I could feel a slow, ancient rhythm in the floorboards, a quiet exhale in the sigh of the settling foundation.

Looking back now, as a well-adjusted, rational adult, I try to explain it away. The house was old and big, and I was a lonely kid with an overactive imagination. Of course I was scared. The long, dark hallway upstairs was a terrifying gauntlet to get to the bathroom at night. The cellar, with its damp, earthy smell and single dangling lightbulb, felt like the mouth to another world. Normal stuff, right?

But then I remember the specifics, and the rationality crumbles. I remember sitting in the living room, playing with my dolls, and hearing a floorboard creak in the empty bedroom directly above me, a slow, heavy sound, like someone was pacing. I’d freeze, my heart pounding in my tiny chest, and listen. One step. A long pause. Another step. My mom would be in the kitchen, humming to herself as she cooked, oblivious. I’d run to her and she’d tell me it was just the house settling. Houses make noises, Emma-bear. But it didn't sound like settling. It sounded deliberate.

It all came to a head the summer I turned nine. That was the summer things went from vaguely unsettling to concretely, undeniably terrifying. That was the summer my mom got a roommate.

It started on a Tuesday morning in July. The heat was already thick and suffocating, the kind that makes the air shimmer above the gravel road. I was in the kitchen, eating a bowl of cereal, watching my mom make pancakes. She was humming, same as always, a tune I didn't recognize. Her blonde hair was pulled back in a messy bun, and she was wearing her favorite floral apron over a simple t-shirt and jeans. I remember thinking how pretty she was, how the morning sun coming through the window made her look like an angel.

“More juice, sweetie?” she asked, turning to smile at me. Her smile was the safest thing in the world.

“No, thank you,” I said, my mouth full of soggy cornflakes.

I finished my cereal, put the bowl in the sink, and went to the living room to watch cartoons. The television was in the corner, an old boxy thing with rabbit-ear antennas. I fiddled with them until the picture was mostly clear, then plopped down on the braided rug. A few minutes passed. Then I heard my mom’s voice from the doorway.

“Pancakes are ready, Emma-bear.”

I turned, and my blood went cold. My mom was standing in the archway between the living room and the dining room. She was wearing her floral apron. Her hair was in a messy bun. She was smiling her safe, familiar smile.

I was paralyzed for a second. My nine-year-old brain was trying to connect two pieces of information that simply didn’t fit. “But… you were just in the kitchen,” I stammered.

She tilted her head, her smile faltering slightly into a look of confusion. “No, honey. I’ve been upstairs making the beds. Come on, they’ll get cold.”

My heart hammered against my ribs. A cold sweat broke out on my forehead. Before I could say another word, my other mom—the mom I had just seen at the stove—walked in from the kitchen, holding a plate of pancakes.

“Here we are,” she said cheerfully. “Fresh off the griddle.”

She stopped when she saw the mom in the doorway. The two of them stood there for a moment, looking at each other. Neither one seemed surprised. Neither one seemed scared. The one with the pancakes just smiled, a little wider this time.

“Oh, good,” she said. “You can help me set the table.”

I couldn’t breathe. They were identical. Perfectly, flawlessly identical. Same height, same build, same faded t-shirt, same worn-out jeans. Same little mole just above the left eyebrow. They moved into the kitchen together, their movements fluid and coordinated, as if they’d been doing this their entire lives.

I stayed on the floor, hidden from their view by the big floral armchair. I was shaking. My mind was screaming. This isn't real. This is a dream. Wake up. Wake up.

But I didn't wake up. I sat there and listened to them in the kitchen. I heard two sets of footsteps on the linoleum. Two identical voices chatting about the weather, about needing to mow the lawn. I heard the clink of two sets of plates being set on the table, two sets of forks, two knives.

Eventually, one of them called for me. “Emma? Breakfast!”

I forced my legs to move. I walked into the kitchen on shaky limbs. They were both sitting at the small wooden table, a plate of pancakes in front of each of them, and a third plate waiting for me. They both looked up at me and smiled the exact same smile at the exact same time.

“There you are, sleepyhead,” said the one on the left.

“We were about to send out a search party,” said the one on the right.

I stared at them, my mouth hanging open. I pointed a trembling finger from one to the other. “Why… why are there two of you?” I whispered.

They looked at each other, then back at me. They chuckled. It wasn't a mean laugh, it was a warm, motherly laugh, but hearing it in perfect, overlapping unison made my skin crawl.

“Oh, Emma-bear,” said Left Mom. “What a silly question.”

“You have such a wonderful imagination,” said Right Mom, reaching out to ruffle my hair. I flinched away from her touch.

They acted as if everything was normal. They pushed the plate towards my empty chair, and when I didn’t move, they just started eating, continuing their placid conversation. I couldn’t eat. I couldn’t speak. I just stood there and watched as my world fractured into a million pieces.

I spent the rest of the day in my room, trying to make sense of it. I kept expecting to wake up, or for one of them to disappear, for the prank or the dream or whatever this was to be over. It never was.

For the next few weeks, I lived with two mothers. They were inseparable. They finished each other’s sentences. They’d be in different rooms and start humming the same tune simultaneously. They cooked together, cleaned together, gardened together. They shared everything, even a bed. Our house only had two bedrooms, mine and my mom’s. I’d hear them at night through the thin walls, whispering and laughing together before falling silent. It was a perfectly mirrored, perfectly synchronized life, and I was the only one who saw it as a nightmare.

My every attempt to address the situation was met with gentle, patronizing dismissal.

“Which one of you is my real mom?” I’d ask, my voice small and pleading.

“We’re both your real mom, sweetie,” one of them would say, not missing a beat as she folded laundry.

“But you can’t be!” I’d insist, tears welling in my eyes. “One of you has to be fake!”

They would stop what they were doing and kneel down to my level. Two identical pairs of concerned blue eyes would fix on me. “It sounds like someone is feeling a little left out,” one would coo. “Do you need some extra snuggle time today?” the other would ask.

They were gaslighting a nine-year-old child, and they were experts at it. After a while, I stopped asking. It was useless. It was like shouting at a brick wall that smiled and offered you cookies. I tried to find differences between them. A freckle, a scar, a habit. There were none. They were perfect copies. I took to calling them The Original and The Other, but I secretly had no idea which was which.

The idyllic, creepy harmony of it all started to fray about a month in. One of them began to act… strangely. Or, stranger than the baseline of existing as a duplicate of my mother.

It was The Other. I decided one of them had to be The Other, and I picked the one who now seemed slightly out of sync. It was tiny things at first. The Original would be reading in the living room, and The Other would be in the kitchen, just standing by the sink, staring out the window at the endless wheat. For minutes on end. Completely still. Or I’d see The Other in the garden, holding a trowel but not digging, just watching the bees move from flower to flower with an intensity that was unsettling.

Then, she started watching me.

I’d wake up in the middle of the night with that feeling you get, the one that tells you you’re not alone. My heart would pound, and I’d slowly, carefully open my eyes. In the faint moonlight filtering through my window, I’d see her. Standing in my open doorway. Perfectly still. Just a silhouette.

She never came in. She never said anything. She just stood there and watched me sleep. I’d squeeze my eyes shut and pretend to be asleep, my body rigid with terror, until I heard the faint creak of the floorboards as she moved away.

This happened almost every night. I started wedging a chair under my doorknob, but in the morning, the chair would be back in its spot by my desk and the door would be slightly ajar.

I tried to tell The Original. I cornered her one afternoon when The Other was outside, staring at the wheat fields again.

“Mom,” I whispered, tugging on her sleeve. “The other one… she watches me sleep.”

The Original put her book down. The smile she gave me didn’t have any warmth in it. It was thin and tight. “We’re just making sure you’re safe, Emma-bear. There’s nothing to be afraid of.”

Her response terrified me more than the watching itself. It meant she knew. It meant they were in on it together. I was completely and utterly alone in this.

The climax arrived on a hot, stormy night in late August. A classic Kansas thunderstorm was rolling in, the kind where the sky turns a sickly green and the air tastes like electricity. The wind was howling outside, rattling the window frames. I was in bed, covers pulled up to my chin, listening to the thunder grumble in the distance. I’d wedged the chair under the doorknob, a futile, pathetic ritual.

Around midnight, a deafening crack of thunder shook the entire house. It sounded like the sky was being ripped in half right above us. The power flickered, then died, plunging my room into absolute darkness. I cried out, a small yelp of fear.

Then I heard it. A noise from downstairs. It wasn't the storm. It was a sound I’d never heard before, and hope I never hear again. It was a wet, tearing sound. A thick, gulping, slurping noise.

My fear of the dark was suddenly replaced by a much more primal, specific terror. I had to know what that sound was. I crept out of bed, my feet silent on the old wooden floor. I removed the chair from the doorknob, my hands shaking so badly I could barely get a grip.

I crept down the hall, every creak of the house magnified by the storm outside. The sound was coming from the living room. It was louder now, accompanied by a low, vibrating hum. I peeked around the corner of the doorway, my body hidden, only my left eye visible.

The living room was lit in frantic, strobing flashes from the lightning outside.

Flash. The first thing I saw was The Original. She was standing in the middle of the room, her back to me. She was perfectly still.

Flash. The second thing I saw was The Other. She was on her knees on the floor in front of The Original. Her head was tilted back, her mouth open in a silent ‘O’. But her face… it was blurry. Shimmering, like a heat haze on a summer road.

Flash. The Original’s hands were on The Other’s shoulders. But they were sinking in. Not like into flesh, but like pushing your hands into a bucket of thick mud. Tendrils of The Other—of her hair, the fabric of her t-shirt, her very skin—were snaking upwards, like smoke in reverse. They were flowing into The Original’s mouth and nose.

Flash. The gulping, slurping sound was coming from The Original. She was absorbing The Other. Swallowing her whole. The Other was dissolving, her form becoming less and less distinct with every lightning strike, a river of shimmering matter flowing upwards. Her nightgown rippled and sank into the skin of the woman who was devouring her. She made no sound. No scream. No struggle. There was just the storm, and that terrible, wet noise of consumption.

I was frozen. I couldn’t scream. I couldn’t move. I could only watch the horror in stroboscopic snapshots.

Flash. The Other was almost gone. Just a pair of legs, flickering and transparent.

Flash. Only her feet remained on the rug.

Flash. There was only one woman in the room.

My mother.

She stood there for a long moment, her whole body vibrating with that low hum. Then, slowly, she turned around. In the next flash of lightning, she looked directly at me. Her face was pale, her cheeks wet with tears. But her eyes… her eyes were glowing with a triumphant, terrifying light. She saw me. I know she did. Then the light in her eyes faded, and a single tear traced a path down her cheek.

The hum stopped. She blinked, as if waking from a dream. The next thunderclap finally broke my paralysis. I turned and scrambled back to my room, silent as a mouse, my heart trying to beat its way out of my chest. I got into bed and pulled the covers over my head, and I did not move until the sun came up.

The next morning, the power was still out. The storm had passed, leaving behind a world washed clean and bright. I crept downstairs, my stomach in knots.

My mother was in the kitchen, lighting the gas stove with a match. There was only one of her. She was humming that same tune, wearing her floral apron.

“Morning, Emma-bear,” she said cheerfully, as if nothing had happened. “I’m making pancakes.”

I stared at her, at the empty space where the other one should have been. The kitchen felt impossibly large and quiet.

“Where is she?” I whispered.

My mother stopped what she was doing. She turned to me, her face a perfect mask of confusion. “Where is who, sweetie?”

“The other one,” I said, my voice shaking. “The other mom.”

Her expression hardened. It was the quickest, most terrifying shift in mood I’ve ever witnessed. The warmth vanished, replaced by something cold and sharp.

“Emma,” she said, her voice low and firm. “We do not talk about our bad dreams at the breakfast table. It’s impolite.”

And that was it. She never spoke of it again. We never spoke of it again. The subject was forbidden. Any time I tried to bring it up, she would get that same cold look in her eye and change the subject. Life went on. We were just Emma and Mom again. But the question has haunted me every single day since: which one survived? Did I end up with The Original? Or did I spend the rest of my childhood with The Other, the thing that watched me sleep and then consumed her double in the middle of a thunderstorm? Is the woman I call my mother… my mother at all? Or is she a copy that won?

That’s the question that has brought the nightmares back. That’s the question that’s pulling me back to that house. Mom sold it years ago, after I moved out for college. She lives in a retirement community in Arizona now. She’s old and frail, and still refuses to ever talk about that summer. The house is empty. Some real estate company owns the land now, but they’ve never torn the house down. It just sits there, surrounded by wheat. Waiting.

I feel like the answer is in there. I know it’s crazy. I know it’s probably dangerous. But I have to go back. I have to know.

So, I’m asking you. I’m a stranger on the internet, and I sound like I’ve lost my mind, I know. But if you believe even a tiny piece of this, what should I do? Should I go? Should I just try to forget again, and live with the nightmares? What would you do if you were me?
