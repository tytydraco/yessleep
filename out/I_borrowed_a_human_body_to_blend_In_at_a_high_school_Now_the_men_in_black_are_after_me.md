I’m Zee. Or at least, that’s what you’d call me. My actual name is an untranslatable sequence of vibrations, so Zee will do. I’m an alien—yes, a real one—and last night, I made a terrible decision.

I went to high school.

Why? Long story short: boredom. My job was supposed to be cutting-edge research, studying Earth’s organisms and ecosystems. But after a few rotations, “cutting-edge” started to feel like cutting into my sanity. To make matters worse, my clearance gives me unrestricted access to your internet and television, and trust me—once you fall into a late-night binge of your teen dramas, you’re done for.

That’s how I got the idea. High school seemed like the pinnacle of human experience, where all the angst, growth, and self-discovery happened. So, naturally, I had to try it. But I didn’t want to observe. I wanted in.

That’s where Hughie came in.

Hughie is a local teenager who was unlucky enough to walk past my cloaked ship last night. He seemed like the perfect candidate: a gangly frame, shaggy hair, and a backpack stuffed with last years crumpled homework. Typical high schooler. I beamed him aboard, put him into a deep stasis (don’t worry, he’s fine), and scanned his DNA. With the help of morphanite—a substance my species uses for scientific exploration—I took on Hughie’s form, right down to his favorite band t-shirt.

Before you panic, know this: Hughie will wake up in 24 hours, perfectly healthy. In fact, I’m giving him a bonus. I’ve mapped out his genetic structure and fixed everything from minor cellular damage to a potential heart condition. He’ll have a clean bill of health for the next hundred years. Think of it as a thank-you gift for lending me his life for a day.

With Hughie safely resting in my ship, I flew to the high school and parked in a remote corner of the campus at 3 a.m. The cloaking field shimmered over the hull, rendering it invisible. I stepped out, Hughie’s sneakers squeaking against the damp pavement, and stared up at the looming entrance.

This was it. My first day of high school.

And I had no idea what I was doing.

That’s when I realized: I was super early.

I guess it was just my nerves, wanting to make sure everything went to plan. Can’t help it—I’m an anxious alien. Always trying to pre-plan, overthinking every detail. What if someone noticed the ship, even though it was cloaked? What if Hughie’s stasis broke? What if I forgot how to human?

Since I had nothing else to do, I decided to sneak inside. The school was dark and eerily quiet, the faint smell of industrial cleaners lingering in the air. I slipped into the bathroom closest to the main entrance, locked myself in a stall, and waited.

When the bell finally rang, I felt a strange mix of excitement and dread. My first class was physics. I double-checked the schedule I’d memorized from the school’s website and headed to the room, doing my best to blend in with the flow of students.

It was all going fine—until I walked in.

The teacher wasn’t who I’d researched.

Instead of the bespectacled middle-aged woman I’d seen in staff photos, there was a massive substitute at the front of the room. He had to be at least 6’5, bald, and almost entirely hairless, save for faint stubble around his jawline. He was dressed sharply, but his movements were unsettlingly precise, his posture rigid. The air around him practically screamed danger.

I froze.

I knew exactly what he was.

We call them the Wardens. Humans call them “Men in Black.” Whatever the name, their purpose is the same: hunt down rogue aliens who interfere with human society. They’re not government agents, not exactly. They’re part of a shadowy partnership between humans and my species, a cooperation designed to maintain order.

My stomach—or the human equivalent—lurched. He wasn’t just a substitute. He was here for me.

“Alright,” he said, his voice deep and cold as vacuum space. “Your teacher couldn’t make it today. I’m Mr. Ward. Now, let’s start with introductions. Three things about you—name, where you’re from, and something you’re interested in.”

My brain short-circuited. I barely heard the first few students. I ran through every possible scenario, analyzing how I could mess this up. Then, too quickly, it was my turn.

I stood awkwardly, my borrowed human limbs suddenly too long and too heavy. “I—I’m Hughie,” I stammered. My voice cracked. Perfect. “Uh, I’m from… far away.” My hands were sweaty. “I like quantum physics and, um… toaster strudels?”

The entire class turned to look at me.

The Warden’s steely gaze locked onto me, unblinking. I braced myself for the moment he’d blow my cover. But then…

“Okay,” he said, clearly thrown off by my weird energy. He gestured to the next student. “You.”

The Warden moved on, but I could feel him studying me out of the corner of his eye. Then, something wild happened: he zeroed in on an unsuspecting kid in the second row.

“You,” he barked, pointing at a scrawny boy. “What’s your favorite celestial body?”

The kid blinked. “Uh, the moon?”

“What about it? Be specific.”

The kid looked around, his voice shaking. “Uh… it’s… round?”

The class burst into laughter.

“Interesting,” Mr. Ward said, narrowing his eyes. “Do you prefer daytime or nighttime? Think carefully.”

“Daytime?” the kid answered, his voice cracking.

“Why?”

“Because… the sun’s out?”

More laughter. Students started whispering to each other, and I could see the tension break. Whatever the Warden was looking for, he wasn’t finding it.

For now, I was safe.

But I could feel his eyes flicking back to me every now and then. This was far from over.
