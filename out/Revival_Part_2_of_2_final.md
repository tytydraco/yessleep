Track 5 

First I started noticing that her skin was losing its normal color turning into a more grayish tone but she was still breathing so I tried to wake her up but got no response from her it seems like she was in a very deep sleep and the problem now was that I couldn't carry her all the way to the town so I considered if I should just leave Her there and try to get help but what if she woke up and I was not going to be here to help Her. 

Not more than half an hour had passed when she started to move like she was having convulsions but  her eyes were closed and she continued like this for some minutes until her mouth opened and this liquid started to come out, it was red but not as full red as blood and also she was not vomiting because there was no violence in his movements but it was just her mouth opened up a little bit to let this liquid come out and I felt ashamed as the smell was so bad I couldn't stay close to her, I got some shirts out from my luggage and try to clean her up but it wouldn't stop coming out so I put her head up so she wouldn't suffocate but all of a sudden she woke up and started to scream, she said she couldn't move her arms and she also perceive the smell and soon enough the pain started so she continued to scream as loud as she could until she fainted probably out of pain, I started to feel the coldness of her arms and they where extremely cold and turning black and there was nothing I could do about it but just stay there with Her but then the thought came out into my brain that if  “She would had stayed for me?” and I knew the answer was that  She would have probably left by now so I was tempted to do the same but for some reason that I don't know what I was as always I didn't.

Not that much time passed when I saw that her legs started to have the same effect as her arms so I laid down in the floor not knowing what to do but decided to just wait for something to happen, the legs where turning also gray and  this slime substance started to come out from the superior part of the legs just in the area where they join to the rest of the body and I could see how the skin started to erode with this liquid slowly separating from the rest of the body even though I knew how catastrophic this was for her I was hypnotized by this effect of slowly seen how the skin opened and separated until the legs just felt down and just like with the liquid coming out of her mouth the smell was unbearable, she was still unconscious and I believe that at that point she had no pain so I covered her and decided to go to find a doctor but before leaving I checked before and she was still breathing.

I didn't wanted to leave her body this exposed so I went back inside and I could see her eyes were open but didn't seem to acknowledge anything going on around her and after some time she finally moved her head and looked at me and again started to scream, she looked like she wanted to say something but the only thing she could do was scream and I could see the fear in his eyes. I couldn't leave her body here but it was too heavy to try and bring it with me so I decided to take her down into the basement and there she would be safe, I could lock the door and nothing could go inside but I had to do it now because I didn't want it to get dark outside so I started carrying her but her head was not stable, her eyes were open but she wasn't able to keep her head up and with precaution I brought here down to the basement were light was coming through a window and it seem like a good dry and clean place to leave her, I set her in the floor and took a blanket out to cover her when I noticed that her skin under her shirt looked different so I took her shirt off and realized her skin was getting purple and her veins were extremely marked all over her body just like if they were getting asphyxiated from the inside. 

I have to accept that a part of me felt trapped because she was not going to survive but what if she did?  What if the doctor was able to get her to survive and what was my obligation to her?, did she even want to live like this? Should I still consider bringing a doctor? After what she did to me during all our time together and all the different ways she had humiliated me over all these years and right there I felt relief and I could finally breathe. 

I left the basement and continue with the idea of going to the town and bring a doctor but as soon as I was about to exit the cabin the reality of the situation hit me and I realized I and only I had to take care of this for her and also for me, so I took the shovel and went back to the basement.

track 6

When I was going down the stairs to the basement an idea hit me, never in my life was I hit like that by an idea and it was like if the whole world had stopped while I was processing it, Why do I always have to accelerate when I had to make a decision? Why do I always fail to see the opportunities in my problems?, and the answer for the first time was clear, what if this is exactly what I needed in my life? I have never seen an insect like this, something I could claim as my discovery and her skin was changing so quickly that there was definitely going to be a change in her. What was she transforming too?. I thought that the smartest thing to do was to collect blood samples or tissue, something I could bring to be analyzed later because it was definitely going to be worth something.

I opened the door and I could see her body just where I left her at the other side of the room but something was different because all her skin looked almost completely gray now and something inside appeared to be moving so I got closer and could see the body in a sitting position occasionally moving to every side like if something was hitting her from the inside, there was a clicking noise coming from there so I got closer and I thought maybe she was going to speak again bot nothing came out just her eyes where opened but it didn't appear to be looking at nothing so I made some quick movements but she was not reacting to them and her movements continued. 

I could see how the middle of her face was getting slowly pushed out like if something was growing on the inside and couldn't fit anymore and was pushing itself to try to get out and more and more you could see her eyes, forehead,mouth just moving outwards like if a balloon was being inflated and I could hear the cracking of the bones as it was getting more and more filled and after some time I could now see the skin ripping in different places like the forehead was now open and I could see the whiteness of the bones already separated and getting out of the head continuing with the nose being ripped in half and the mouth giving up and ripping in a horizontal way, a second push put almost everything completely out and now I could see like if the inside of the body was coming out and another push finally ripped the head apart completely breaking all he bones and skin in the head and revealing this round “insect” covered in blood coming out from her head walking directly to me and before I could do any movement I could feel something pinching me and I looked down and there it was that black tube connected to my hand and almost instantly I started to feel some liquid coming into my body, I looked straight at the face of the thing covered completely in blood but I was sure I could distinguish her face in it. I stayed quiet and allowed her to complete what she was doing to me.

For a moment I thought we were communicating, his black inexpressive eyes fixed on me and I wondered if she wanted to hurt me or if it was just unconscious animal behavior, I manage to pull this thing out of me ran out of the basement and lock the door. The same transformation that happened to my wife will now happen to me and I couldn't allow this to continue because I didn't want to go through it myself so I picked up the fire fluid and went down the basement with the intention of ending it all. 

track 7

I opened the door and saw this thing just standing there without any movement that it almost looked like it was afraid, It looked so passive that I didn't thought it could move fast enough to be a real treat anymore and I kept thinking that this could still be my wife and I shouldn't just leave her like that alone down here so I closed the door and decided to burn the whole cabin, is for the best. I will burn the cabin and I will lock the basement door and have my own transformation in here next to her. 

I recorded this tape to explain what happened to me and my wife. I will now put it in the steel box you found it and ask you to carefully come down to the basement and pick what is left of us.
