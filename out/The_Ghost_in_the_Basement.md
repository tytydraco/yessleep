**This is a true story.**

This is something happening to my friend, not me. She came to me for advice, but I'm at a loss after saging didn't work.

It started all the way back in 2011. My friend, we'll call her M, was having a sleepover for her 8th birthday. I was there, along with a handful of other girls. Her house was quite small, so the only room that would accomodate all of us was their finished basement. The night went well, but when we woke up one of the other girls noticed her digital camera had a new picture on it.

It was a picture of all of us sleeping on our air mattresses. *Everyone* was accounted for in the picture, even M's mom. The only other people in the house were M's father, who wouldn't have done this, and M's younger sisters, who were not even old enought to know what a prank was.

After that, it all seemed quiet for years, until very recently.

M and I were on a video call when she jumped, feeling like she'd been punched in the arm. Sure enough, a bruise started to form in the exact spot she'd been hit. It was 12:08am.

Two months later, we were yet again on a call when she suddenly looked down and noticed she was bleeding from two small punctures on the same arm. That was at 11:33pm.

So, naturally, we convinced our other friend, E, to buy a Oujia board. We went to E's house to play it, and the story it told linked to everything happening in the basement. If we're to believe the board, we were communicating with the woman who lived in the house before M's family. She said her son, Zanny, had died in the house, and that she had killed him. She wouldn't give us any information as to why, or how to get rid of him.

Not long after that, came the part that haunts me the most. We were on a video call again, as we do most nights, and she had eaten one of those CBD gummies earlier in the night. We'd watched a horror movie, and she was getting spooked as it was time to call it for the night. She said she heard something udner the bed, so humored her and told her to put her phone under the bed so I could check for monsters. I was planning on making a joke out of it, until I actually saw what was under there.

I only saw it for a split second, but I can still picture it clearly. You know when someone puts their fingers in their mouths to stretch their smile? It looked like that, only there weren't any hands. It's face was just like that. I told her to pull me back up, and then told her what I saw.

And now, just last month, I woke up to a picture she had sent the previous night. I know how this is going to sound, but she swears up and down that this was real. It was a picture of her computer screen open to our Instagram chat. In here message bar, unsent, was "I'm Rea\[-"

She saged yesterday, but the activity has only gotten worse. Any advice you have will be appreciated.
