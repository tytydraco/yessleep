I'm a 22 year old man with a job at Nevada test and training range, or as the public call it, Area 51. The big house with all the bad aliens or whatever. My job is mainly to watch the monitors of a few rooms and do an inspection every week. I wasn't allowed to talk in the cells due to some of the abnormalities that could possibly be provoked with sound. So I simply walk in, check if anything needs to be cleaned, refilled or tested. After that I submit my report, watch the cameras again for a few hours, then go home. 

“Alright, it's the end of my shift, whatever is left of the paperwork I can do tomorrow, Kay?” I told my Co-worker, Kimberly. She was the worry wart of the team, I hated working with her.

“What?! It's just two more pages to fill out!” She glares at me, holding out my clipboard to me as I grab my coat.

“Oh my god can't you do it? I could check on that new cell as I'm heading out and text you if it needs anything, Deal?” 

She sighs and rolls her eyes but puts the clipboard down on her desk. “Fine, but don't make this a habit, I don't like paperwork.” 

I shrug as I grabbed the keys for my car and the pair for the cell then left. I walked down the hall, it was always loud. Not just with the A/C but with all the other machines beeping and scanning to keep this place stable. I made it to the door of the new room and walked in, closing the door right behind me. I looked around, seeing nothing but a mirror inside. 

I glanced at it and scoffed softly. ‘Did they seriously have a cheap looking mirror locked up? Where did they even find it? What could it do to be such a threat it ended up here?’ I thought to myself as I looked around the room. Nothing dirty, no food, and no water. I was thinking of texting Kimberly about it but stopped myself. It was a damn mirror, it didn't need any supplies besides windex and a paper towel. So like any sane person I didn't text my coworker to feed a mirror.

I turn to actually look in the mirror, maybe that was the anomaly? A strange reflection? Nope. Nothing. All I saw was myself, tired and a little annoyed. I had to waste my time with this when I could've easily just left my car. But whatever, I can't change the past, only deal with the future. 

I turned away from the mirror to head out the room, as I left I heard something, banging as well as a muffled scream. I quickly turned around, I saw nothing but the mirror and my face a bit panicked in the reflection.

“Get it together John.” I mutter to myself as I leave the room, shutting and locking the door.
I was back in the hallway, however it wasn't super loud. The beeping of machines wasn't as obnoxious as a few minutes ago. I shrugged it off and just made the excuse of me being tired as the reason and got in my car. 

I drove for about half an hour when I looked in my rear view mirror, checking if any cars were behind me. However what I saw wasn't a car, it was a shadowed figure. Someone…or someTHING was on the side door of my car.

“It's probably a bird or something, Nothing to worry about” I say to myself as I continued driving, Every now and then I would glance back and it was still there, as if latched onto the door handle. It creeped me out but what could I have done? Pull over and grab my pocket knife to stab a bird? That's the stupidest idea I've ever heard of. So I kept driving until I finally was parked outside my home. 

I looked at the mirror one final time and saw nothing. Whatever was holding on to the door was gone and left not a single scratch or dent. 

“I knew I was paranoid over nothing.” I yawn as I lock my car door and walk to my house, as I turn the key and open the door I glance at the doors window, the glass on it had that same shadowy figure in replacement of my reflection. I quickly closed it back to double check what my eyes just caught in my  peripheral. All I saw was myself. I hesitated and walked into my home, shutting the door and locked it. I put my keys on the counter and yawned again. “I just need sleep, that's all it is.” I repeated to myself as I went to the bathroom to wash up. I showered and brushed my teeth, looking at the mirror again, seeing the figure staring back at me, directly, all I could see were eyes, piercing white eyes. I screamed and backed up, tossing my tooth brush to the mirror, the figure was still there.

“S-Stay back! Get away!” I yelled as I ran out of the bathroom. I quickly ran to my bedroom, looking at anything that could give a reflection and turned them around. Picture frames, flat on the table. the tv on my desk, I turned it around to the wall. At the window, I closed the curtains. My room was reflection free, that THING couldn't get close to me anymore. Content with that thought I closed my eyes and forced myself to go to sleep.

I was woken up by the sound of my phone. I sat up and looked at the caller's name, it was my boss. I groan softly and answer it.
“Hello?”

“John, where are you?? You haven't clocked in yet? Not to mention Kimberly said you left YOUR paperwork to her yesterday!”

God damn it Kim.

I turned to the clock, it was later in the afternoon which was a surprise to me, I didn't expect to sleep in this late. I stood up and looked around my room, remembering the events from the previous night. 
“Boss, I don't really think I should come in today, I'm kind of…seeing things.”

I hear a loud sigh on the other line then a scoff “If you don't get down to the office, you can kiss your job goodbye. I'm not letting you slide with another one of your excuses to miss work. Get down here, now.” He then hung up. 

I looked around a bit on edge as I got dressed and walked to grab my keys. I looked at the door, worried about the window, I quickly shut my eyes and opened it, locking the door without looking at my reflection. I walked to my car, in the window reflection I saw the figure again, but this time it was distant, then slowly walked closer. I didn't bother waiting til It got to me, I jumped into the seat and quickly drove out of my driveway, heading straight for work.

I got to work and noticed a few more cars in the parking lot than usual, I walked into the building and spotted my boss talking with a few coworkers, his eyes then landed on me. His face changed from calm to pissed off. He walked to me, tossing a packet of papers to me.

“Since you wanna skip out on your job, I found a few worksheets that need to be done by tonight. It's not as much since that room with the cracked mirror isn't getting any paperwork til next week.”

“Yeah yeah i got-” I paused and turned to him “...The…cracked mirror?”

“Yes, the new anomaly, it's files aren't here yet so no one's supposed to go in there until we get the data”

My blood ran cold. That mirror was far from cracked when I saw it last night, it looked like it was recently bought, how could it be cracked? I definitely couldn't tell him that though or I would definitely be fired. Kimberly should've told me not to go in that room if she knew they didn't want anyone in there, I never would've offered to go in her stead! I sigh and take a deep breath, I hug the papers and walk to my office, taking a quick glance at the room with the now cracked mirror, the being in my reflection was still in the window … but it wasn't in the mirror. I paused and then looked at it closely. The mirror only had me, despite the cracks it was clear that I was the only thing that showed up, not some creepy silhouette. 

My night went long, seconds felt like hours as I continued to finish my paperwork, still thinking about that mirror, my curiosity was killing me. As I was halfway done I took a break. Walking straight to that room, I know I was told not to go in, but I went in once and I'm still alive. Maybe that shadow figure is from this mirror. If I can figure out how it worked then I would be done feeling paranoid by looking at anything that could reflect.

I opened the door and closed it, walked up to the mirror and looked around. I squatted down in front of it and noticed there were a few big pieces of glass on the floor, about 3 of them, and yet I could tell one of the shards were missing. Besides that detail there was nothing else significant about it. My watch beeps signaling the end of my break, I quickly turned it off, remembering my boss said the mirror reacts to sound. I waited…nothing happened.

“It's just a dumb mirror” 

I then felt a sharp pain in my back, a few more followed, my white shirt turning a crimson red. I was stabbed. I glanced up at the mirror and spotted something behind me. It stood beneath the light bulb, making it hard to clearly see what or who it was. All I could see was that last glass shards in its hand, covered in my blood. I felt dizzy and the being kicked me into the mirror, literally. The last thing I heard being 

“Lets see how you like it in there”

Turns out that mirror was some wormhole in disguise. No wonder we didn't have any data from it, we don't touch our subjects so how could we know this one wasn't just a sound based anomaly. I sat up, looking around. The black void of the mirror was all I could see. Minutes passed, then hours, the pain in my back was killing me, the stab wounds hurt badly but somehow I wasn't dead. Soon I saw something, a mirror, then another. Then many other ones, one of the mirrors spawned right beside me.

I looked through it and spotted him, that shadowy figure, with my clothes on on the other side as if he was mocking me. I slowly walked towards the mirror. I tapped it, trying to get his attention, then glared and banged on the mirror, yelling at him 
“Let me out!! You can't do this to me!!”

I then looked around and spotted a mirror that had my car's reflection. I quickly walked towards it and looked through it. I looked through it, seeing the impersonating anomaly driving MY car, I glared and thought of banging but didn't. The last thing I needed was for it to crash my car. So I waited, looking through the many windows of the world I've been replaced in. I tried getting its attention once it went back to my home. In the door, the mirror in the bathroom, I tried everything, but it ignored me. 

I looked around the void of mirrors and huff, The last thing I haven't tried, breaking one of them. I went to the one that was at my job since I didn't feel like breaking anything from my home. I took a few steps back and used my body to slam into the mirror, over and over until I finally was able to be freed from that prison. I looked around then at myself, My body seemed tinted, as if the void was trying to bring me back. I then looked outside the room, noticing all the workers. I hid behind the door and waited. 

I waited until I saw the door swing open, that thing was in here. Squat down in my clothes, looking at the mirror I escaped from. I stood up slowly, grabbing one of the four glass shards.

I stabbed it. I stabbed it multiple times, glaring down as I saw it grovel in pain. As it turns around my body froze. I was looking at myself, this monster turned into me. Trying to live my life, I was furious then looked at the mirror then back at him. 

“Lets see how you like it in there”

I shoved him in the mirror, my body returned to normal and even my back wounds closed up. I quickly got out of there and back to my office, spotting Kimberly there, I sat down and noticed I had two pages left…odd. There's some serious deja vu I'm feeling.

Time went on, I didn't want to finish my paperwork so I agreed that I'd visit a room to check up while she did the last pages. My stomach felt weird, my body felt like its done this before. I went to the new room, my eyes widened as I recognized the subject. A mirror.

“...Its not broken…” I quickly looked around but didn't see anything odd and attempted to leave, but as I did something in my body told me to look again, I turned fast and spotted it.

There's someone in my reflection.
