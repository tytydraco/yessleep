Hi, my name is Sarah (15). Now here me out: Since recently I am getting more and more weird and creepy hallucinations and I'm starting to believe they're real. So it all started a week ago.

It was a Monday I was sitting alone on my table in school. We had math at that moment and I was very tired cause of the party on Sunday. As I was thinking about other things like my boyfriend when my math teacher suddenly screamed at me. This happens very often cause I always zoom out and they never understand it. But this time. He didn't just go on with the lesson. He came to my table and started to talk about how I never focus and such but I wasn't paying attention to him. One of my classmates started to scratch his arm. At first, it was slow and soft. But it got faster and harder until I could see his own flesh getting ripped of his arm. But he didn't stop, no he kept going, on and on. No screams, no pain nothing. I didn't even understand how he scratched it so hard. I was in complete fear and confusing. I screamed: "Stop it ryan!" But when he looked behind me. His wound... Gone. Completely. Nothing on his hands nothing on his arm. A short quiet second passed and everyone was looking at me. I was never so confused and scared in my entire life. That's when the teacher got so angry. I don't even remember what he said but I know he screamed at the top of his lungs cause almost everyone in the school was looking trough the windows from the hallway. I also got detention afterwards.

That wasn't the only time. The next day I walk around with my friends and we talk a bit. I told them about what happend on Monday but the moment I said something they immediately interupped me. I tried again and again but they either ignored it or again interupped me. Until they all stopped. Silens filled the streets as the wind stopped.

I couldn't see their faces but at that moment. I heard something. A giggle so wicked and evil the fear flew down my body. I heard it all around me. I wanted to run but I couldn't move a single part of my body. Nothing, the fear glued me right to the place I was standing. As I looked to my friends I immediately regretted that decision. All of them were looking at me. Smiling with reddish eyes and black liquid all over their bodys. They walked to me as their smile became bigger and the giggling got louder. Finally, I ran. I ran as far as I could leaving everything behind. My backpack, my phone I dropped and my keys. I look behind me a last time as I see my friends standing there in complete confusion. Again I was fooled by my own mind.

This went on and on like that and the hallucination appeared more often and felt realer. I thought it couldn't go worse after I broke my arm when running as fast as I can into a tree which I haven't seen in my hallucination. But then, Sunday night at the hospital. I laid in my bed and couldn't sleep the whole time. The fear of having another hallucination kept me up all night. 

Speaking of the devil I hear a knock. Not 3 or 4 just one. One single strong knock at my door. I was staring at the door. Not blinking at all. That went on for 2 minutes until I finally blinked. And that... Was a mistake. That single blink was enough for the demonic thing behind the door to come in. There it was, standing right in front of my bed. I didn't look at it but I heard it's screeching breath. That's all I remember from that point. 

After that day, I never had any hallucinations again but sometimes. I still hear the screeching breath right behind me. Since then, no one wants to talk or look at me. I don't know why, even my parents are like that. They fear me. Everytime they accidentally look at me they scream and immediately send me to my room. Everyone is like that. They run or attack me. So most of the days I sit in my room and only come out if my parents are gone or I have to go to the toilet. Since they go away often I can atleast eat something. 

I don't know what to do at this point anymore. 

2 Weeks have passed now. I wanted to post this but I kinda forgot. But I have some updates about the situation. The screeching breath I sometimes hear is now always next to me. It has gotten worse, far worse. I'm a dangerous target for the police which is after me. I don't know why, I haven't killed or hurt anyone. But I'm on the run. 

To get my phone charged up I hide in the mass of people and charge it at a public charger. I have a mask and sunglasses at all times but I don't know how long I can hide from the security and all the people continuously looking for me. If they find me they won't hesitate to shoot me. Defently not. 

This breathing is like a second person. It's sometimes talking to me. Helping me run away. I don't know what it is but it could be why everyone is scared of me so I try to get rid of it. But the thing is. I can't get rid of something I don't even see or know. I don't even know at which part of my body it is. But it surely has to be seen somewhere on my body or the people wouldn't run away when seeing me. I tried to feel it by touching my face but there was nothing I felt. It all felt normal like I would be a normal person. This is getting out of hand and the more I am alone the more it talkes to me. Sometimes it even tells me to hurt others. 

When I try to look into the camera or any reflection of me the thing what reflects gets destroyed or disappears (Mirrors break, Camera doesn't work, puddles dissapear etc.). I avoid to see my reflection at all costs cause first of all. A mirror or a window at night breaking out of nowhere would draw the attention to me which is very bad. Secondly I could get hurt ot destroy something very big cause it reflects everywhere. 

All I can eat is some bread I buy through begging at the streets. This is not where I should be. I wanted to be a happy girl living in a big house with my boyfriend. But that's not my situation. My boyfriend even tried to kill me once. Just like my parents and mostly everyone who has seen my face.

I want to live my normal life as a school girl. I don't want this to end with me dying trough police or anyone else. Does someone have any idea for me? If someone could just help me or know that I mean no harm I would be more happy then ever. 

If do not reply I am probably dead. So I want to say this to everyone I have known. My parents, my ex, my friends and my teacher:

 I will "never" forgive you.

Update:

11 Days have passed, For the ones who didn't know: I tried to get help from the church but that was one of my stupid ideas. 

They locked me up in a empty room with just a dirty old bed and a chair, nothing else and all they said was: "Wait".

Every morning two armed soldiers and one priest with a cross and a blindfold came into my room. They gave me foul soup and the dirtiest water I have ever drank. I couldn't possibly escape, they would instantly kill me if I would. I had my phone for  at least 3h until it ran out of power so I had nothing to do in all these days. 

I went insane

But every time it would escalate something made me go unconscious. I don't know what it was but it at least calmed down. 

This went on like this for the next 3-4 Days I can't even remember but one day, out of nowhere, I'm in a big room enchaned on a chair. Idk if they got me when I was sleeping but looking around I saw at least 12 Priests. The didn't have any blindfolds on this time no, they even looked at me. 

Now that was something completely new in the last weeks. Someone looking at me without screaming, running etc? However the longest one of them looked was maybe 2 seconds until they looked away of fear. 

Some minutes pass like this in silence and finally, one of them grabs a book while all the others circle around me. 

They started to draw a red circle around me and the  one with the book started chanting in a probably holy language or something like that but as he was chanting the now completed red circle started glowing

I don't know what I saw, what happened after that but what I remember perfectly is the ùï°ùïíùïöùïü. 

It was everywhere, on my eyes, on my skin and even inside of me. I've seen so many hallucinations, all so fricking disturbing with again this demonic figure which haunted me in the hospital. It was screeching and screaming but this time, of pain. 

It felt the same pain I did, finally. 

Well, I wake up in a church themed hospital so I knew I was defently still in the church. There was a nun smiling at me telling me: "You're awake, finally".
But wait, he was smiling while looking at me??? 

There was a small mirror in the room so I naturally went to it and you won't believe it but, I could see me again, without the mirror breaking. 

My face was like I remembered, completely untouched. That was the best day of my life. 

I thanked the church and I could actually walk around outside without my face completely hidden, no one screamed, no one attacked me or called the police when seeing my face. 

I definitely wanted to finally go home, after all this stress. Take a shover and sleep in a finally comfortable bed. I didn't look at my parents even ones when entering the house and just went straight to my room. Fortunately they were understanding so I could be alone for a while. 

My live went back to normal, well I did get traumatized and all my classmates were asking me questions all the time, I mostly ignored them or said please leave me alone, not even my friends could know about this. If one of my classmates reads this then please do not spread it, thank you.

u/oomten I am so thankful for your idea with the church, you're a live saver
