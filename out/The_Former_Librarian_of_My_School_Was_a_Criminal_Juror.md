I work in a school library. Before, it was quite far from home, requiring two buses and a part of the journey was on a highway. However, this year, a position opened up in one much closer to my home. It seemed like the perfect job: a quiet place, close to home, and with a welcoming atmosphere. I could walk less than 10 minutes, and I would be there.

On my first day, I looked at the school (which, incidentally, was from my neighborhood and where I had attended as a student). Not much had changed, a large courtyard in front, with trees and some play equipment. I entered, and after introducing myself to the team, I went to my station. The library was a separate building, a small yellow structure with some wooden furniture. I went to my chair in front of the computer and found a letter left by the former librarian, a kind woman I'll refer to as "M." In the letter, she described her love for the library but confessed she could no longer continue. She said the library deserved "someone better," and she wished me luck, leaving two candies on my computer table as a welcoming gesture.

Excited, I started organizing the paperwork left by her. Initially, it was book receipts, reminders of late returns for children's agendas, labels, and so on. Then I came across an academic paper, something about mental health and psychological disorders. I flipped through the pages while reading. It was a well-done paper. I assumed M was a psychology student and had forgotten this old work here.

I interrupted my snooping when the principal called me to do other tasks. We were in the week before classes resumed, and, while the students were not there, we were to use the time to organize as much as possible. So, I put it aside and went to help. The weekend passed quickly, as always, and yesterday the students returned. Amidst laughter, tears from little ones not yet used to being away from their parents, and shouts of children playing and swinging, I returned to organize the papers on my table.

Among some real estate ads and regional council bills, I found a pile of sheets, stapled together. It wasn't an academic paper. I opened it slightly just to be startled by what was inside: the image of a corpse. I jumped back in shock as my heart seemed to leap out of my mouth. It wasn't special effects or anything like that. The document was a report sent to all jurors in a investigated homicide case. The image was grotesque: the body had already started to react as expected - swollen, eyes large and bulging. There was a red line under the chin, presumably a cut, and on the right side of the neck, the plastic handle of a knife was still sticking out. She was naked from the waist down. The librarian was a juror in a murder case and received the paper with screenshots, camera images, and the corpse. Intrigued and scared, I started reading the details of the reports, realizing that there were two more. The crimes were violent, sinister, and brutal, and somehow seemed to be connected.

After the initial shock of coming across the graphic details of the cases, an unease began to grow within me. This kind of thing is like a drug; it harms you, but you want to see more. I picked up, between one library class and another, the reports to read them again. I realized that all three victims were women (maybe M was involved in networks supporting women victims of violence/femicide? Or perhaps a social reflection?). All were victims of qualified homicides. The reports described macabre scenarios marked by extreme violence and signs of torture.

The documents contained details of the investigations, from the victim's conversations with family members to phone call transcriptions from the accused with possible accomplices. I will transcribe the main facts, emphasizing that the names of people and institutions here are not real.

**1 - Case of Camila - Qualified Homicide Report**

**Location**: Camila's House

Victim:

Name: **Camila** \[Last Name\]

Age: **36 years**

Occupation: **University student/Homemaker**

Last Residence: \[Address\]

**Background:**

Camila was a homemaker who recently became a dedicated student, enrolled in the Pedagogy course at the University of Campo Bellum. The investigation revealed that she was involved in a complicated love triangle with a classmate, Sofia \[Last Name\], causing jealousy in her husband, Lucas \[Last Name\].

**Chronology of Events:**

\-**Conversation Screenshots:**

The messages exchanged between Camila and Lucas indicated a tumultuous relationship. Jealousy, arguments, and threats were evident in the conversations. Lucas expressed possessiveness and dissatisfaction with the supposed closeness between Camila and Sofia.

A crucial message was found: "*You will regret leaving me, Camila. I would do anything for you.*"

\-**Camera Images:**

Security cameras at the university recorded tense moments between the three involved: on one occasion, Sofia pushed Lucas away from Camila when things got heated. Images showed furtive encounters in the hallways and isolated areas between Camila and Sofia.

On the night of the crime, Camila was seen leaving the university library, followed by Sofia. The images indicated a heated argument before entering a darker, more secluded area on campus.

\-**Crime Description:**

In the early hours of the next day, Camila's body was discovered in an isolated area on the university campus. She showed signs of strangulation and wounds caused by a blade. The crime was meticulously planned, suggesting prior knowledge of the victim's routines.

**Suspects:**

**Lucas** \[Last Name\]:

**Motive**: Jealousy and possessiveness.

**Alibi**: Claims to be at home at the time of the crime, but inconsistencies were noted in his statement.

**Sofia** \[Last Name\]:

**Motive**: Involvement in the love triangle.

**Alibi**: Claims no involvement in the murder, but her presence in the camera images raises doubts.

**Preliminary Conclusions**:

The murder of Camila appears to be the result of a distorted and obsessive passion, fueled by conflicts in the love triangle. The collected evidence, including conversation screenshots and camera images, points to two suspects, Lucas and Sofia. The investigation continues as we seek to gather more information to present to the court.

The images left me nauseous again; this had been the first one I saw, and now it wouldn't leave my mind. I proceeded to the second:

**2 - Judicial Process - Isabela Marques Case**

**Summary of Facts**:

Isabela Marques, a renowned psychologist and resident in the city, was found lifeless in a motel located on the outskirts of town. The body showed clear signs of strangulation, indicating a violent death. The case was immediately sent for investigation due to the unusual nature of the murder.

**Investigation**:

\-**Conversation Screenshots**:

The screenshots recovered from Isabela Marques' phone revealed an intense and disturbing interaction with a patient identified as André Silva. The messages indicated a complex relationship, with André expressing an unhealthy fixation on the psychologist. Excerpts from the messages suggested that Isabela was aware of André's obsessive behavior but hesitated to end therapy, fearing retaliation.

André: "*You are the only one who truly understands my deepest self, Isabela. I can't live without you.*"

Isabela: "*We need to end therapy, André. It's the best for both of us*."

André: "*You can't abandon me, Isabela. I would do anything for you*."

\-**Camera Images**:

The images captured by the motel's security cameras provided additional insights into the events leading up to the tragedy. Isabela arrived at the location accompanied by André Silva, apparently coercing her. The images showed a charged atmosphere, suggesting tension between the two, and a closer analysis revealed that he was threatening her with a weapon under his coat, managing to get her into the motel with him.

At one point, the images revealed a heated argument between Isabela and André in the elevator. Aggressive gestures from André indicated an outburst of anger that would later culminate in the fatal strangulation of Isabela. The body was left in the room, making the housekeeper the next day come across the scene.

\-**Autopsy**:

The autopsy confirmed the cause of death as mechanical asphyxia due to strangulation. No signs of defense were found on the victim, suggesting that the attack was sudden and brutal. Additionally, bruises and abrasions were identified on Isabela's body, indicating a physical confrontation before the strangulation.

**Preliminary Conclusions**:

Based on the evidence collected so far, Isabela Marques' case seems to be a clear example of a distorted and obsessive passion. André Silva, the patient, is the only indicated defendant, having manifested his fixation on the victim in conversations and finally committing the violent act that resulted in Isabela's death.

The investigation continues to gather more details about André's background, his possible accomplices, and to clarify the reasons that led to such a sick passion, culminating in a heinous crime.

The atmosphere in the library seemed to have subtly changed since I began sifting through the documents. A heavy silence hung in the air, contrasting with the laughter and playfulness outside. The school hallways were empty, and the dim light in the library cast shadows that danced on the dusty shelves.

I decided to proceed with the third victim, trying to ignore the growing sense of unease within me.

**3- Judicial Process - Marta's Case**

**Summary of Facts:**

Marta, a dedicated nurse and single mother, was found dead in her residence. The crime occurred during the night, and the body showed signs of torture, indicating an extremely violent death. The brutal nature of the homicide caught the attention of authorities, and the investigation was immediately initiated.

**Investigation:**

\-**Conversation Screenshots:**

Screenshots recovered from Marta's phone revealed a series of threatening and obsessive messages from a sender identified here as "X." The messages detailed intimate information about Marta's life, indicating that the killer had detailed knowledge of her daily movements. Marta never responded to the messages, but the last ones indicated a growing intensity in the observer's obsession.

X: "*You look so lovely sleeping; maybe I should keep you company.*"

This last message led Marta to file a complaint with the local police. However, due to the inability to trace the number, the case was archived until the time of the murder.

\-**Camera Images:**

Security cameras near Marta's residence captured suspicious movements in the nights leading up to the crime. An unknown person seemed to be lurking around the house, suggesting constant surveillance. In the last images before the crime, a hooded figure was seen entering Marta's house.

\-**Crime Description:**

Marta's body was discovered in the living room of her house, tied to a chair. Signs of torture were evident on her body, indicating a prolonged and sadistic attack. However, the method of execution was not revealed by the forensics.

**Preliminary Conclusions:**

Marta Oliveira's case exhibits characteristics of a murder motivated by a sick obsession. X, whose identity remains uncertain, seems to have closely followed Marta, invading her privacy and ultimately committing a brutal crime. The investigation continues to identify X and gather more information about the motivation behind this terrible act.

As I delved into the details of Marta's case, the atmosphere in the library became even more oppressive. The faint whisper of the wind mixed with the occasional rustling of leaves outside, creating an unsettling symphony. The local alarm beep made me jump. Something happened to it, and now it emits that sound constantly...

I returned to the table, realizing that the bullets left by M were still there, silent witnesses to the unfolding events. Among the documents, I found a transcript of a phone conversation related to Marta's case.

\-**Phone Transcript - X**

**\[Transcription Start\]**

Voice 1 (Unknown): "*Are you sure you want to do this?*"

Voice 2 (Unknown): "*Yes, but we need to be careful. We can't leave traces*."

Voice 1: "*Alright, make sure you do it right; I'll check on the police movement around here*."

Voice 2: "*She... looks so beautiful. You know,  I would do anything for her.*"

**\[Transcription End\]**

The conversation raised more questions than answers. I assumed that one of these voices was X's. Fear began to seep into my thoughts, and a sense of paranoia enveloped me. I looked around the library, half expecting to find eyes watching me from the corners.

The next revelation was in the correspondence between Marta and her lawyer, documented in the following pages, revealing a tumultuous history of domestic abuse and a custody battle for her child. This discovery added another layer of complexity to the case. Another crime of passion?

As I delved deeper into the investigation, the library, which initially seemed welcoming, turned into a sinister setting. The sound of the wind gained an almost eerie melody, and dancing shadows seemed to twist along the walls. Finally, my closing time arrived, and I could leave, leaving that deafening beep behind. You see, I leave at the last hour, so when the alarm trouble began, there was no one to notify, so I decided to deal with it the next day.

The night dragged on slowly as I tried to process the disturbing information I had uncovered in the library. Every shadow, every creak in the house felt like an imminent threat. I attempted to sleep, but my mind was filled with gruesome images from the cases I had read. When sleep finally reached me, it was interrupted by vivid nightmares.

The next day, I woke up exhausted and still disturbed by the events of the previous night. Looking in the mirror, I noticed deep bags under my eyes, visible evidence of the insomnia I had endured. As I prepared to leave, I was confronted by an angry neighbor. He claimed to have seen me the previous night, walking down the street with a friend, causing a commotion and peering through windows. Confusion spread among the residents, especially those with children who would be frightened by the noise, sleep poorly, and be disrupted at school. As an education professional, I should have been aware of these consequences.

I tried to explain that I hadn't left the house the night before, but my words fell on deaf ears. Paranoia grew, and I found myself isolated, even suspicious among neighbors who had barely noticed my existence before.

Upon arriving at the school, I encountered the principal, who cast a curious glance at my worn-out state. I tried to disguise it, but something in my demeanor betrayed internal agony. I entered the library, and the heavy atmosphere seemed even more intense in the daylight. I decided to proceed with my work, hoping that normalcy could dispel the tension that hung in the air. However, when I reached my desk, what I saw made my heart race uncontrollably.

The case files were there, meticulously arranged on the table. Grotesque photos of the victims were scattered, each in its own row, like a macabre gallery. In the center of it all, however, was the worst: a photo of me, taken while I slept the night before. And on the photo, a small candy.

Panic enveloped me like a cold shadow. I looked around, half expecting to find eyes watching me again. Paranoia grew, and the line between reality and nightmare seemed to blur. I felt my throat constrict as my heart pumped blood slowly through my veins. I could swear that, through the window, I saw someone moving outside... but... well... the school is crowded, couldn't it be a staff member? I don't know... I felt something... threatening, a dark feeling, a negative aura, call it whatever you want. My gaze alternated between the window and my desk.

After a moment of hesitation, I gathered the courage to flip through the case files again. But something had changed. Detailed information about the cases was smeared with dark ink, rendering them illegible. The threat was clear: "You've meddled where you shouldn't have." The alarm beep snapped me out of my trance and made me jump in fear. It was becoming annoying, actually. I marched to the coordination office to inquire about the issue.

"Excuse me, R (principal), I have a problem in the library."

"Go on."

"Well, the alarm next to the door is beeping every few seconds, and..."

"Oh yes," the vice-principal interrupted. "That's because we're without signal."

"Without signal?" I asked.

"Yes, it seems that one of the communication wires broke yesterday afternoon; a branch fell on it. We're somewhat incommunicado for now, but I think there's nothing to worry about."

"Oh, of course, yes. Thank you very much."

I left as soon as I realized what had happened. Without signal. In other words, the alarm is unusable. If someone entered, it wouldn't even alert...

The beep continues, along with the ticking of the clock. There's 1 hour and a half left for everyone to leave and leave me here alone for another hour. I look at my sleeping photo and wonder what kind of game is happening here, and what fate M had, and if I'm destined for a similar ending...
