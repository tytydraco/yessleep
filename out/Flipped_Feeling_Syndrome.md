“You remember Mr Jones? The guy who used to live next door?”, my dad asked me as I shovelled pancakes into my mouth during the family gathering.

“Of course I do, is he still around?”, I asked. Although it had been ten years since I thought about him, I could remember him all the same. He was a bit of a loner, always keeping to himself. And as much as it sounds mean, there was something… off about him the few times I did chat with him. While I couldn’t really pin it down, if I had to hazard a guess, it would be that his facial expressions were quite odd and different.  No wonder all the neighbourhood kids made fun of him!

“No.”, Dad sighed, “He passed away a week or so ago. He doesn’t have any family ‘round here, so the lady down the road decided to pay for his funeral.”

I remembered her too. Mrs Woodsmith, who lived a couple houses down the road from us, was always nice to Mr Jones despite all of our misgivings about him and helped him out quite a bit. He didn’t seem to have a family or any relatives, and most certainly no friends around him.

“Oh. And when’s that?”, I enquired casually. I didn't really expect to go but wanted to know just in case.

“Tomorrow”, he replied, “Since you’re still gonna be here, you might as well come.”

Well, he was right. Maybe I could at least meet up with my old neighbours who still lived here if nothing else.

The next day, I woke up early in the morning. I wore my best dark clothes and headed down to the funeral hall, as I promised my dad. As I walked through the large doors, a flood of my childhood memories unleashed upon me. All the old neighbours I knew were still there, so far as I could see in the sparse crowd occupying the hall, even after all this time.

I then walked up to Mrs Woodsmith. “Good morning”, I greeted her. She turned around and with the widest smile on her face, greeted me in return. “Good morning, Will! It’s so nice to see you here!”. 

“It’s so nice of you to arrange this funeral for him”, I responded, attempting to continue the conversation. 

“Yeah, he didn’t really have any family around him. First, his wife and kids were killed, and the rest were driven away by his condition…”, she trailed off.

“Condition? What condition?”, I asked with intrigue. Now that was something I hadn’t heard about him before!

In response, she hastily glanced left and right, before ushering me to a quieter corner of the hall. Then, she began elaborating.

“Don’t go spreading this around, but he had a one-in-a-million hormonal condition called Flipped Feeling Syndrome. Because of it, his reactions were basically flipped. He laughed when he felt the saddest and cried when he felt happy.”

“Wait, really? And how did you know that?”, I asked. The idea seemed ludicrous at first thought, because what the hell kind of condition was that?

“Of course I would know, I helped drive him to and from his medical appointments!”, she replied in frustration. 

“Well, that certainly does explain his various quirks.”, I responded. I still didn’t buy it, but he didn’t seem very normal nonetheless. As I mulled over it for the rest of the funeral service, I realised that she might have been right about it. She did, of course, spend the most time with him given that most of the aforementioned ‘relatives’ weren’t really around.

Leaving the service, the conversation continued playing in my head. And that’s when I remembered an old memory.

Back when I was 7 (around 30 years ago), I fancied myself as some sort of miniature Sherlock Holmes or James Bond. I used to hide in my neighbours’ bushes and spy on their conversations, them mowing the lawn, anything really. And this was one such time, late at night when most of the neighbourhood was finishing dinner and winding down.

When I was hiding in the bushes separating his and my house, two police officers from the nearby station knocked on his door. A minute or so later, he hastily slammed open the door and gruffly asked, “What is it?”. One of the officers enquired, “Is this Mr Jones Krowitz?” in response to which he nodded.

My seven-year-old self did not expect what came next. Heads slightly bowed in sympathy, the officer mournfully stated, “Sir, the remains of your wife and daughter were found in pieces left by the side of the highway. I’m sorry for your loss. Can you please accompany us to the police station so that we can record your statement?”. The news seemed to have hit him hard, as he immediately broke down and began sobbing loudly while the police began comforting him and ushering him out.

Of course, I immediately ran home instead of witnessing the aftermath and stopped doing these spying activities afterwards. The incident I witnessed was… traumatising, to say the least, and rather depressing. Worse, it wasn’t meant for my eyes to begin with. I generally forgot about it, until now.

Now that I think about it, I see the memory in a whole new light. If Mrs Woodsmith was right…

Wouldn’t Mr Jones actually be overjoyed at the brutal murder of his family?
