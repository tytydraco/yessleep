I was part of the search and rescue team that found the remains of Emma Finch in Chequamegon-Nicolet National Forest. She was badly decomposed and wouldn’t be identified until months later by her dental records. A short distance away from her body, roughly shoved into a rotted hole in a tree, I found a small journal sealed in a ziploc bag. I put it in my pocket without thinking and didn’t remember it when the police asked if we had found anything on or near the body.

Emma’s death was officially declared to be either exposure or a bear attack (or some combination of the two) and the journal stayed with me. It stayed in a lock box under my bed for more than a year after the cause of death was determined. Reading someone’s diary–even the diary of a dead woman–felt morally wrong. It wasn’t until I randomly heard a podcast talking about all the unexplained deaths in state parks that I finally worked up the nerve (after a few stiff shots) to crack it open. 

I decided to transcribe the whole thing here because it’s…it’s something. This site seems pretty open-minded on bizarre stuff so I’m hoping you can help me make sense of this and tell me what I should do. 

I’ll be changing names for the privacy of their families but everything else will be exactly as it’s written in the journal. The beginning is a little slow, but I don’t want to leave out anything in case it proves to be important.

June 18th

My name is Emma and I have anxiety. 

I know that’s a pretty weird way to start a journal, but it’s an important part of who I am. I envy people who are able to just…do things without spending days agonizing over everything that could go wrong. How can you just decide to do things and then do them?

I don’t like going on adventures; adventures are for people without anxiety. I’d rather stay at home and read about adventures or watch other people have adventures on tv. Home is the only place where I can manage my anxiety. I know my home is safe because I’ve made sure of it and I can double-check as many times as I want without someone looking at me funny. 

My cat may judge me as I make my fourth trip to the door to make sure it’s locked, but I know he won’t tell anyone.

My best friend Angie loves adventures and she always manages to drag me into going on them with her no matter how many times I tell her I’ll be miserable the whole time. This time it was camping. She made it sound so nice over the phone.

“It’s a national forest, Emma!” she chirped over the phone. Angie always chirps when she's trying to get me to do something I don't want to do. “It’ll just be us and nature. We’ll hike around for a while and camp for one night, two tops! It’ll be fun and super tame!”

It did sound tame. Tame enough that I might actually manage to enjoy myself. And, Angie had called well enough in advance that I had plenty of time to prepare for the trip, instead of calling the day before like she normally does. I was actually a little excited for this adventure.

But when Angie pulled into my driveway with three other people I had never met before any good feelings I might have had went away. And when I had to squeeze into the middle seat between two strangers and hold both of my bags because they wouldn’t fit in the trunk I wished I had said no. And when the two hour trip was nothing but conversations about things I didn’t know about and inside jokes I didn’t understand…I wished they would leave me on the side of the road to die. 

I’ll leave the finer details of the trip to your imagination, but suffice to say it was awful for me and fun for everyone else, and by the time we were heading off down the first trail I was on my third mental breakdown of the day and it was only ten in the morning. 

The trails were nice enough, I guess. If I hadn’t already been in such a lousy mood (and if it had just been me and Angie like I originally thought) I probably would’ve enjoyed myself. 



I think we had been walking for about two hours when we found the first one. I had finally managed to relax a little and was talking with one of Angie’s friends–Candace, I think–when one of the boys yelled from up ahead. They found something.

I smelled it before I saw it. That awful roadkill smell that sticks to the inside of your nose and won’t leave. Angie and the two boys–Luke and Travis–were huddled around it when Candace and I caught up. 

A dead moose, or rather, a big pile of gore with a moose pelt thrown over it like a cartoon character trying to hide a bunch of trash under a rug and a moose head sitting proudly on top of the mess. 

“Poachers?” Luke asked.

“Nah,” Travis said, “poachers wouldn’t leave the antlers. Probably wolves.”

“If it was wolves wouldn’t it be…eaten?” I asked and both of the guys stared at me. I think they forgot I was there. “Predators usually eat organs and stuff first, right? That–” I pointed at the pink ropes of entrails leaking out of the pile of moose parts– “looks like it has all its organs.”

“Could have been a disease,” Candace offered, “that would explain why nothing has been eating it. But–”

“Guys can we please get away from this thing?!” Angie covered her nose and mouth with the collar of her shirt and gagged. 

Candace snapped a picture of the moose with her phone and we moved on. Luke and Travis talked amongst themselves about why the rangers hadn’t moved the moose off the trail while Angie desperately tried to change the subject and rubbed vanilla sugar cookie hand sanitizer under her nose.

I stayed in the back with Candace who was still staring at the picture of the dead moose on her phone with a confused frown. “If it died of disease something else must have moved its body,” she muttered mostly to herself, “That’s the only way the head would be…but that doesn’t make any sense…why move it into the trail where people would see it?”



We saw more dead animals after that. Three deer, another moose, a bobcat and what looked like a black bear but I couldn’t be sure. All of them were in the middle of the trail and arranged like the first moose had been. All of their guts and bones in a pile with the pelt thrown over them like a blanket and the head perched on top (with the exception of the bear, its head was missing). 

Candace wanted to go back but Angie wouldn’t hear it. “If we turn back now we’ll be walking in the dark,” she said, “it’ll be safer to set up camp and make a fire.”

We were forced to agree and moved a little ways off the trail to make camp in a clearing. Luke and Travis dug a huge pit for a fire while Angie, Candace, and I snapped branches off of nearby trees.

I’ll admit I felt safer with a fire going but I still jumped at every little noise and conversation was muted no matter how much Angie tried to get everyone’s spirits up. 

No one wanted to let the fire die down but no one wanted to stay outside either. Travis finally made the call and kicked dirt over the last embers and we all retreated into our tents for the night.



I woke up to Candace shaking me. Her face looked naked without her glasses. Her eyes were huge and she held a finger to her lips. 

I thought it was Angie snoring at first but her eyes were wide open and her hands were clamped tightly over her mouth.

Something was snuffling around outside the tent. Something big and lumbering with heavy footfalls and a stench that put the dead animals on the trail to shame. The cloth wall of our tent caved dangerously as whatever it was leaned against it, almost touching Candace’s shoulder. She fumbled away from it as best she could, almost climbing in my lap, and shakily put on her glasses.

Bear? I mouthed when she looked at me again. 

She frowned and shook her head. 

Too big, she mouthed back. 

Then it roared. I’ll never forget that sound. Books like to use the word ‘blood-curdling’ to describe a scream. I guarantee you don’t know what that really means. It’s impossible to know what ‘blood-curdling’ means until you’ve heard something blood-curdling. That thing’s roar was blood-curdling; a roar like the biggest lion in the world that rose into an all too human-sounding scream that turned my stomach to ice.

And then it left. The ground shook with the force of its gait as it thundered away after some other prey and left the forest around us unnaturally silent save for the ringing in my ears. 

It took ten agonizing minutes before any of us could work up the nerve to open the tent flap and peek outside. Across from us the boys were doing the same thing and after an intense, whispered debate, Angie, Candace, and I piled into the boys tent. It was a tight squeeze, but the prey animal need to be with the herd canceled out any discomfort or awkwardness we might have felt. 



We found pawprints around our camp in the morning. They circled our tents several times before disappearing towards the trail.

“Plantigrade front paws, digitigrade hind paws,” Candace muttered, snapping a picture of the tracks, “But then when it runs away….”

I saw it too. “Two of the prints disappear,” I said and Candace nodded.

“It was walking on all fours while it was sniffing around our tents and then stood up on two feet to run off.”

“Do you know of any animals that do that?”

Candace shook her head, “Definitely not any that live in Wisconsin.”



It was Luke who decided we should go off the trail. “I remember the map we looked at back at the entrance,” he said, “this’ll get us back to the parking area faster.”

After four hours of walking, more than a few switchbacks and progressively more heated arguments, Travis announced that we were lost. 

Angie cried and insisted we turn back, Luke and Travis said we should stay put and wait for rangers to find us, while Candace and I…well Candace was still looking at the pictures on her phone and I was thinking about how much better everything would have been if I had just told Angie no. 

Eventually we ended up doing what no-one had suggested and kept trudging forward, except this time Travis started making little marks on the trees with his pocket knife every few hundred feet to mark our trail in case we were going in circles. But pretty soon the sun was setting and we were facing another night in the forest. 

We only set up one tent this time and made an even bigger fire than yesterday. 

We actually talked a little this time. Candace talked about how she was going to college to become a vet and how she volunteered at her local animal shelter. Luke was only a season away from going pro in football, and Travis was celebrating six months clean from meth. I even got to talk a little about myself; my anxiety and how hard it is for me to do simple things sometimes. They surprised me with their understanding and I thought that maybe, when all of this was over, I could stay friends with these people.



Candace didn’t have to shake me awake this time. I could hear it loud and clear, snuffling and grunting around the edge of the tent like a giant pig. The smell of mold and rot was so bad I had to cover my nose with my sleeve to keep from retching. Everyone was sitting up and listening. I could feel Angie’s breath on the side of my face and Travis was clutching his pocket knife. 

Slowly, painfully slowly, the animal made its way to the front of the tent and, presumably, was checking out the fire pit. 

I almost didn’t notice Candace reaching for the tent zipper. I grabbed her wrist so hard and fast our hands made a slapping sound when they smacked together and the beast outside grunted in surprise. We held our breath for a full minute before it started poking around the fire pit again and we could all breathe a silent sigh of relief. 

I knew what Candace wanted to do, I knew from the phone clutched tightly in her hand, and there was nothing I could do to stop her. She pulled the zipper down, just far enough to stick the hand holding her phone out.

I could see the flash and my stomach dropped. 

The beast was silent.

And then Candace was dragged out of the tent. It happened so fast we didn’t have time to scream. But Candace did. And her screams faded into the distance terrifyingly fast.

And it was silent again.

That was an hour ago. The regular nighttime noises haven’t come back yet and everyone is too scared to move, even to try to close the hole in the tent. Angie is still crying and I think Luke and Travis are too. I’ve just been writing this all down. I have to do something with my hands or I think I would go crazy. It’s dark and I don’t know if my writing will be legible, but it’s all I have. Maybe it’ll be a warning to others or something.

I can see Candace’s phone on the ground outside the tent. If I’m still alive tomorrow I’ll see if she actually got a good picture of the thing. I hope so. She deserves it.

If anyone is reading this, please remember Candace Marie Edwards from Rhinelander, Wisconsin. She was a nice woman with brown hair and big round glasses. She wanted to be a vet and volunteered at the animal shelter. 

Tell her parents she died doing what she loved: learning about animals.
