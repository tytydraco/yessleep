Part 1.

”I’ve had a lot of “firsts” in my life. First car. First heartbreak. First apartment. First funeral. But I only ever had one first kiss.

And I still think about him. Almost every day.

⸻

I met Eli when I was nine. We lived two streets apart, and our moms worked at the same hospital. Some nights, when they had overlapping shifts, I’d go to his house and we’d play Nintendo 64 on this clunky old TV that had to be smacked on the side to work.

He was the weird, quiet boy with a cowlick and oversized glasses. I was the loud, overly emotional girl with scraped knees and paint-stained hands. We couldn’t have been more different. But it worked.

He was my best friend. The kind of friend who’d help you bury your dead goldfish because you were too sad to do it yourself. The kind of friend who’d walk home with you every day even though it meant missing his favorite cartoon.

He used to tell me I was brave. I used to tell him he smiled like a secret.

God, I used to write his name in the margins of my notebooks like some obsessed lunatic. ELI. ELI. ELI.

But like most childhood things, it didn’t last.

⸻

We drifted sometime in middle school. He stopped showing up to class as often. Started wearing a hoodie even in summer.

Rumors spread. People whispered about “stuff going on at home,” but I never asked. And honestly, I was too caught up in my own world to reach out.

When I finally did — sophomore year, I think — he barely looked me in the eye. Just said, “Hey,” and walked off.

That was the last time I saw him.

Or so I thought.

⸻

I walked out to the mall. But before i entered i noticed something kinda weird. I saw a guy standing in the parking lot taking pictures at me. I didn’t think much about it and went inside.

Fate, as it turns out, is weirdly theatrical. Last fall, I was walking through the mall after work. Just killing time. I stopped in front of the food court, scrolling through my phone, when I heard someone say my name.

Not “hey.” Not “excuse me.” But my actual name. Like a prayer someone forgot they still remembered.

“Melissa?”

I turned — and there he was.

Eli.

But not the skinny, shy boy I remembered. He looked… older, obviously. Taller. But also — cuter. So stupidly cute.

Like one of those boys on sad indie movie posters. Sharp jaw. Crooked smile. Eyes that looked tired but kind.

He had this lopsided haircut that didn’t quite suit him, but somehow made him more attractive. And when I smiled, he smiled back — wide and real, and I swear to god my heart skipped.

⸻

We talked for hours that night. Sat in the corner of the food court with two half-eaten slices of pizza and cups of flat soda.

We talked about school. Life. Childhood. He told me he was working part-time at a bookstore downtown.

“I like the quiet,” he said.

I told him I was finishing up college. That I was still painting. That I had thought I’d outgrow that phase, but hadn’t.

He asked if I remembered the time I climbed his garage roof and refused to come down until he swore on his Nintendo cartridge that we’d be friends forever.

I told him of course I remembered. He said he never broke the promise.

And just like that, everything that had felt dead and gone cracked open like sunlight through blinds. It was warm again. Easy again.

By the time the mall closed, I didn’t want to leave. And judging by the way he walked me to my car — neither did he.

We exchanged numbers. And he hugged me. Tight. Like he meant it.

That night, I laid in bed staring at the ceiling and smiling like a goddamn idiot. I hadn’t felt that happy in years.

⸻

Over the next few weeks, we talked constantly. Texts. Late-night calls. Spontaneous meet-ups.

We’d go for walks through the park, talk about books, music, stupid memories from middle school. He’d bring me coffee at work. I’d leave sticky notes on his bike with bad doodles and inside jokes.

It felt like falling. Not just in love — but backwards, into something soft and familiar.

And then, one night…

He kissed me.

It was after a movie. We were sitting in his car in the parking lot, wrapped in silence and shared glances. He leaned in — slow, hesitant. I met him halfway.

It wasn’t perfect. Our noses bumped. My lip gloss stuck to his mouth.

But I didn’t care.

Because it was him.

On my way home though, i noticed this black Sedan driving past me. For a moment i thought i saw someone in the driving seat holding a camera.

⸻

Anyways. The week after that was magic. I floated through days like I was dreaming.

I painted more. Ate more. Slept better. Everything felt lighter.

Until the texts stopped.

⸻

It was a Thursday. I remember because we’d planned to meet after his shift at the bookstore. I texted: “Still on for 8?” No reply.

Then I tried again. And again.

Nothing.

I assumed maybe his phone died. Maybe he got called into work. Maybe — maybe — he just forgot.

The next day, still nothing. No texts. No calls. His phone went straight to voicemail.

I drove to the bookstore. The guy behind the counter told me Eli hadn’t shown up in three days. Didn’t call. Didn’t answer when they knocked at his door.

My stomach sank.

Something was wrong.

⸻

The funeral was small. Closed casket. Lots of whispered voices. Too many tissues and not enough answers.

He had taken his own life. Hung himself in the apartment above the bookstore. No note.

Just… gone.

I sat in the back row, clutching a tissue I never used, staring at the framed photo of him at the front of the chapel. Smiling. Eyes too tired for someone so young.

His mom spoke. So did his old friend Julian. But I couldn’t get up. I couldn’t speak. I didn’t even cry.

I just kept thinking:

“Why now?” Why after we found each other again? Why after we finally kissed?

⸻

A week later, I received a package. No return address. Just my name in his handwriting.

Inside was a sketchbook.

The first few pages were blank. Then came small pencil sketches. Of me.

Smiling. Sleeping. Sitting on his couch.

Then, written across one page in the center:

“You made the dark feel far away. I wish I could’ve stayed longer.”

⸻

People always talk about their first kisses like fairy tales. Like some glittering milestone in a life full of bright moments.

Mine ended with a funeral. A sketchbook. And a silence that still hasn’t left.

⸻

Sometimes, I dream about him. We’re sitting in the food court again, eating cold pizza and laughing. He reaches out to touch my hand. And I whisper, “You promised you’d never leave.”

He smiles.

But this time, he doesn’t say anything.

And when I wake up… I’m always crying.

This text could have ended like that, but im afraid it didnt.

A few days ago, I found something else.

An old letter Eli wrote me. It had been tucked inside a book he loaned me years ago — one I never returned.

His handwriting was messy but soft. Loopy. Familiar. It made me cry just looking at it.

And that’s when I remembered the sketchbook.

I pulled it out again. Flipped to the page with the message — “You made the dark feel far away. I wish I could’ve stayed longer.”

I compared them.

And my blood went cold.

It wasn’t the same handwriting. Not even close.

The loops were too sharp. The pressure too heavy. The slant was reversed. Whoever wrote that note…

Eli hadn’t written this.

I don’t know who did. Or what did. Or why they’d pretend to be him.

But the more I think about it — the cameras in the parking lot, the car that followed me, the drawings of me sleeping — the less this feels like a goodbye…

And the more it feels like a warning.
