The call to prayer sounds in the background as I roll. Recently, I've been making my way back to God. The obscene juxtaposition of these events is not lost on me. The guilt is overbearing, but my cravings take control. 

Click. 
Tsk.
Click-click. 
Click.

I light up in the bathroom and tilt my head back. 

Puff.

The smoke rises and begins to fill my abysmally small bathroom. 

Puff.

I fan the tainted air towards the window in my bathroom. Outside, I can see the sky turn purple.

Puff.

It's been a rough day. As many days have been. All I need is to be numb. All I need is to turn off the deafening sound of the cacophony of voices in my head. 

Mistakes. Flashbacks. Regrets. 

Puff.

My wife's voice note plays over in my head. “I'm not getting what I want from this marriage. Do you even care that I'm not around anymore?”

God knows I've been trying to be better. God knows I've been praying on it.

Puff. Puff.

A quick nap will help me feel better. It always does. I just need to shut off my brain.

Puff. Puff. 

My throat starts to burn. My hands are shaking. “Probably cancer,” I say flippantly, fully aware that if a disease or, I don't know, reckless driver took me out, I'd just be thankful. 

Puff.

With a final drag, I flush the filter and head out to lie on my bed. I sink onto my side out of habit and routine. I turn to her side. Perfectly made. Untouched. I dare not ruin it. I expect her to come back. 

Sigh. 

I close my eyes and stare into the darkness of my eyelids. I stare and fall deeper into nothingness, till I see zigzag patterns in the dark. The accelerating high encourages fascination. I nestle in more comfortably into bed, throwing a blanket over my body, trying to make sense of the patterns. 

That's when I see it.

A circle? No. But it is. A circle…surrounded by an oval…with…hair?

But I'm staring at darkness. I'm used to seeing patterns. 

This is new.

My closed eyes focus on the object they're seeing. The blackness seems to deepen, giving way to whatever clarity darkness can afford. The shape becomes more vivid. 

An eye.

But…how? 

How, on the dark canvas of my closed eyelids, could I be seeing an eye, clear as day? 

Puzzled, I glance farther into the pitch black, and the eye seems to gaze back at me.

“Look closely,” says a voice from inside of me.

I stare back at the singular eye. It stares back. Suddenly, it shifts. 

It takes turns being manic, then sad. Tired. Exhausted. Vengeful. 

I wonder if it's my own eye. But I seem to have irked it.

It vaguely morphs into a face. I can't make out its features, but the rage on its dark visage is unmistakable. 

The mouth, hollow and open, transforms into a blood curdling smile. It seems like it is yelling. No, shrieking. I begin to hear shrieks in my head. 

Suddenly, I hear a whisper from outside the confines of my mind. A quick, “I'm here,” and an unmistakable tug at the foot of the blanket haphazardly covering my body. The shock jolts me awake.

Am I hallucinating? 

Intrigued and, admittedly terrified, I lie back down, eyes wide open. I'm not ready to see it again.

I know it'll be there when I close my eyes.
