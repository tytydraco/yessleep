"Look man, I don't mind trip sitting for you, you've done it for me before and probably will again but you gotta stop with this weird shit! It's starting to really freak me out, okay? How much did you even take?" said Josh.

"I'm not fucking around, dude I swear I just saw it again!" Hank said, his nose practically touching the window glaring out into the pitch black backyard.

"What the fuck are you talking about, okay? It's 3am, there's nobody out there, and even if there was you wouldn't be able to see anything with how dark it is. Just calm down and get a glass of water. This isn't funny and I'm starting to get tired and pissed off." Said an annoyed Josh, starting towards the chord of the blinds to close them.

"Dude, I swear, I'm being serious, there's someone outside." He said with a concerned expression pulling Josh right up next to him.

Josh squinted in an attempt to see anything through the dark window but saw nothing but the faint glow of the moon on the rusty swing set at the park in the distance.

"Sigh.. SEE? There's nothing out there you're just tripping. Come on dude, let's go to bed already." He pulled the chord of the blinds shut.

For one quick moment, as the blinds descended, Josh spotted something crawling on all fours very quickly through the blackness of the park, but it disappeared almost as fast as it had appeared.

"THERE, did you see that?" Hank ejected upright. "You had to have seen it! Come on, Josh I know you did!" He said with a shaking voice.

"Come on man, it was just an animal, you do realize there are animals that only come out at night right? You're just freaked out and tripping. You sound crazy. We're going to bed" Josh said definitively.

The two walked into the bedroom and Josh helped the still shaken Hank into the rapidly deflating air mattress on the floor of the room.

"You know man, I think you need to take a break from this stuff for a while. You're really bugging out tonight." Said a concerned Josh. "Look, I'll go get you some water and a snack. Just try to close your eyes and breathe."

Josh started to the kitchen when suddenly, four very loud consecutive bumps sounded on the bedroom wall.

"What the hell was that? Jesus, I hate living in an apartment. It's 3am for fuck's sake." He said.

"Josh, did you hear that? I think that thing saw me looking at it. It's coming for me." Hank whimpered from the bedroom.

"Calm down, it was just the neighbor! Besides we're on the 3rd floor, it's not like that fox from the park could get up here even if it tried." He replied, in an attempt to calm his hyperventilating friend.

"That wasn't a fox. I swear... it looked like a *person."* Hank said after a pause, assuredly.

Josh scoffed and decided he would no longer entertain this bad trip fueled paranoia and poured a glass of water and grabbed the half eaten bag of Cheetos from the cabinet.

Suddenly, another deafening bang sounded, this time sounding like it came from within the apartment.

Josh heard Hank scream in horror as all the lights simultaneously went out. He dropped the glass of water and chips onto the floor and ran in the darkness towards the bedroom.

As the lights flickered on, Josh saw no sign of his distraught friend.

But someone else was there.

Sitting, clutching the broken in windowsill on all fours was a pale man with pitch black eyes wearing nothing but a wicked smile of brown, decaying teeth staring at him.
