*In  1991, during the deposition of Willard Kranz in connection with the  StrategicEdge Capital Management security fraud trial, the following  transcript emerged. Although initially deemed inadmissible on the  grounds of hearsay, recent developments concerning the discovery of  multiple human remains at an abandoned agricultural property in Cascade  Meadows have thrust this testimony into the public spotlight.*

*Significantly,  it is imperative to emphasize that all parties implicated have  vehemently refuted the accuracy of this particular testimony.*

**Section One:**

Your wife told me about the invitation.

Now  don’t be upset. She may be an alcoholic and an embarrassment but she  truly loves you. And love… love is something most people don’t  appreciate until it’s too late.

And  she’s afraid too. No surprises there, she’s heard the rumors about the  Nedzner Festival. She knows what could happen once the two of you and  your children board that private jet to Cartagena.

In  my day families didn’t get involved with ways of the Old Deck. It was  just a gathering of greedy fools in spartan conditions, not some  entertainment complex on a private island. Of course, there were more  cards in the Old Deck back then and it wasn’t called the Nedzner  Festival, it was called the Poelzeg Experience.

That’s  right, the Poelzeg experience. You can research it all you want, and  look through all the libraries, newspapers, and websites but you won’t  find a single word written about it. But just like the nightmare you’re  about to blunder into for thirty years, it was where fortunes were made  and legacies were lost. It was an exclusive, gathering of the elite. You  had to be affluent, powerful, and a gambler to gain entry.

I  was fifty-five years old when I found the mysterious, green and yellow  envelope on my bedside table. Whoever had left it there must have  bypassed my security with incredible ease. Most people would have thrown  away the envelope out of fear or simply not knowing, but I knew exactly  what this meant—this was something I had been anticipating for some  time.

One week later, I found  myself in Idaho. Upon my arrival at the airport, a private car awaited  me just outside. The driver, who appeared to be in their sixties, had a  bald head and wore a tuxedo reminiscent of the classic 1920s style. They  were referred to as "Attendants," a title that still felt fitting; I  couldn't picture calling them anything else. The vehicle I was guided  towards was a Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost. When the Attendant offered to  handle my luggage, I willingly passed over my suitcase but I clung  tightly to the weighty metal attache case with my right hand. It had  remained by my side throughout the entire journey, and my arms were  starting to ache from its heft.

The  Attendant had the radio playing as they drove. Since it was a Sunday  morning Casey Kasem was on the radio working his way through the Top 40  hits. I tuned it out for most of the journey but once ‘Wildfire’ started  playing I told the Attendant to switch it off. The song was trash. I  knew trash when I heard it. With the radio silent, I had the chance to  reflect on what I knew and didn't know about the Old Deck and the  Engines of Creation.

I had a scrap  of paper tucked into my jacket pocket, scrawled onto it were the  opening lines of the third chapter of the Nine Rebel Sermons;

*”In  that dread and harrowing moment, Ezerhodden, the Behemoth of Tishrei,  didst inscribe twelve eldritch runes, each bearing the name of one of  the twelve Barishamada- Xyrlith, Zyvrathul, Ithryndra, Korvylar,  Thranok, Grythar, Vyraska, Astrylith, Nyxeros, Drak'mor, Sylthara and  Yorvithar. Once, their eldritch dance held dominion over the Engines of  Creation, but these hallowed glyphs condemned them to the abyss of the  Screaming Nowhere, a realm where their voices echoed with prophecy and  genesis.…”*

"After half an  hour, we departed from the highway, onto a rugged dirt road, flanked by  forsaken farmhouses and slanting silos. Every other tree bore a  no-trespassing sign. Another half hour elapsed before we ascended a  winding driveway that ultimately unveiled a spacious barn. Its fresh  coat of paint gleamed, encircled by diesel-fuel generators, casting  light from every window.

To the  left of the barn, a cluster of modest Airstream trailers huddled  together, while to the right, a sizable yellow tent stood proudly.  Strings of green lights adorned its exterior, endowing it with the  allure of a traveling circus or a county fair.

The  Attendant parked our car Rolls-Royce alongside a dozen other similar  vehicles and opened the door for me. They offered to carry my suitcase  but I refused.

“Just tell me where to go,” I said.

“You’ll  be in trailer 29.” The Attendant handed me a key and pointed to the row  of identical trailers. So, that’s where I went. It was just like Marvin  described it, high stakes gambling in a low-cost environment. There  were differences, of course, there were always differences. His  invitation to the Poelzig Experience had brought him via chartered  helicopter to an abandoned resort in the Catskill mountains. The guests  however had been left sleeping in whatever rooms hadn’t been given over  to wildlife and the elements. Every night shared his lodgings with the  CEO of a fast-food franchise. Marvin had recounted that with every gust  of wind cascading down the peak of Black Dome Mountain, the CEO had  emitted soft, quivering whimpers

Naturally,  the way Marvin spun the tale, it sounded comical; he insisted they were  "roughing it." Just thinking of him always brought a smile to my face. I  reminisced about the bars we'd shut down and the casinos we'd  outwitted. Two middle-aged billionaires, hopping from Las Vegas to Monte  Carlo, then off to Costa Rica and back again. Regrettably, these  memories led me to ponder how it had all come to an end for him—gun in  hand, and his thoughts splattered across the opulent walls of a  five-star hotel room in Singapore.

The  big black digits on trailer 29's door made it easy to find.  I unlocked  it and went inside, and what greeted me was nothing more than a bed,  hallway, and bathroom. A transistor radio sat on the windowsill,  emitting only static. There was no off switch, volume control, or tuning  dial. That didn’t bother me, as far as I was concerned it was the best  the radio had sounded to me in years. I set my overnight bag and  nightmarishly heavy briefcase on the bedspread and glanced out of the  window at the setting sun.

Marvin  had warned me there would be a lot of waiting around so I shuffled  through old memories, old dreams, and old songs. After forty minutes of  waiting the static on the radio was replaced by a feminine voice with a  heavy Boston accent. ”The Yellow Tent is now open," she said. "Cashiers  can be found on the right and the complimentary buffet is located on the  left."

I joined the well-dressed crowd that had formed a line outside the Yellow Tent. A cloud of tobacco smoke hung overhead.

Everyone  in the line had a briefcase of their own, and the variety was striking.  Some were sleek and made of polished metal, while others were crafted  from fine leather and bulged.

Attendants  in tuxedos hurried about, efficiently managing supplies and making  final preparations for the Yellow Tent's lighting and sound systems.  Their poised demeanor and attire contrasted sharply with the casual  crowd. Not one of them looked younger than retirement age.

A Smug High Ranking Offical was standing beside me, he leaned in close, “Are you the woman from Harmony Records?”

“Yes.” I bristled, ever so slightly. I was the Chief Executive officer and he damn well knew it.

“What are you going to ask for?”

“None of your business.”

He took a drag on his cigarillo, “Going to cash out early? No shame in that. Take the money and run.”

Eventually,  I made my way through the canvas alcove that separated the cashiers  from the interior of the Yellow tent. I hefted my briefcase onto the oak  desk a pair of Attendants were sitting behind. I opened it and they  made a quick show of smiling toothlessly at the gold bars it contained.  Then they handed me a tray holding two hundred and fifty thousand  dollars worth of chips. Each of them was engraved with its value on one  side and the current year on the other - 1975. One way or another, when  this was over I would leave these behind. Anyone trying to pocket a  souvenir of the Poelzig Experience would suffer accordingly.

Carrying  my chips I made my way to the tent’s interior. The light was blinding,  clusters of stage lamps were lashed to the top of each of the  ten-foot-high tent poles. The complimentary buffet counter and wine bar  occupied one side of the structure. A trio of Attendants had been posted  to watch over the buffet and they eagerly served the few guests that  decided to partake in the heaping amounts of pork tenderloin and fresh  vegetables on display.

The rest of  the tent was occupied with tables for baccarat, blackjack, craps, and  poker, each one sporting an elderly Attendant standing at the ready.  Naturally, I gravitated to the Baccarat table, I’d been in love with the  game for over ten years. Before that, I’d preferred the craps but ever  since a bad run of luck in Vegas, I’d sworn off dice.

Marvin  on the other hand had excelled at poker. No surprises there, he had  been a slippery-tongued grifter with an uncanny ability to read people.  He could lie to you without saying a word, his eyes betraying nothing of  the devious thoughts behind them. Those skills weren't just limited to  the poker table. Despite looking like a legitimate businessman he was  the master of small-time cons and high-stakes scams. He could spot an  opportunity in any situation and had the quick wit and smooth talking  needed to take advantage of it.

We  started as rivals. He had outsmarted me in a real estate venture in  Luxembourg, but two years later, I turned the tables with a movie  investment that left him empty-handed. Then, a crisis in Portugal forced  both of us to run for our lives. For years, our paths didn't cross, and  during that time, our interests shifted toward more legitimate  money-making opportunities.

It was at a financial conference in France, where we both found ourselves as someone else's plus one.

Even  now, I shake my head at the absurdity of our first night together.  Perhaps it was the enchanting view of Paris, the lines of cocaine we  indulged in, or the realization that even the most selfish and greedy  people crave someone to confide in. From that moment on, we each pursued  our separate paths, but we never drifted too far apart.

I  pushed the memories aside as I strolled toward an empty table and took a  seat. The Attendant's raspy voice interrupted my thoughts, informing me  that the minimum bid to play was five hundred dollars. Without  hesitation, I doubled the amount and waited for a response. A heavy  silence descended, filling the air. Nothing happened. The Self-Made  Millionaire and Trust Fund Baby sitting on either side of me exchanged  perplexed glances. I glanced around the room and noticed that all the  dealers were waiting, and the atmosphere became uncomfortably still. At a  nearby blackjack table, someone requested to be dealt some cards, but  the Attendant raised a white-gloved, quivering finger in a gesture that  pleaded for a moment's patience.

A  flap in the rear of the tent opened, and a trio of Attendants walked  in, carrying a flagpole. They struggled for a few minutes to set it up  in the center of the gaming tables. Then, a fourth wizened figure  entered, bearing a triangle of green cloth. Slowly, they unfolded it and  ran it up the flagpole. Another Attendant placed a heavy-duty fan  beneath it and switched it on. Embroidered onto the flag was a pattern  reminiscent of a spiral, evoking thoughts of a lamprey's mouth. It was  the symbol of the Veilweaver, as depicted on the lost third suit of the  Old Deck.

Suddenly, all of the  dealers began talking at once. The games had begun. What followed was  some of the most intense gambling of my life. Charles Poelzig's dealers  might have looked like escapees from a nursing home, but they played  fast and smart. A good number of my fellow guests saw their chips  dwindle at a frightening speed. The Trust Fund Baby who had been sitting  to my right retreated to the complimentary buffet, cringing as she  gorged herself on free ham and wine. Things went better for me; I made  thirty thousand dollars, but it wasn't without effort.

Typically,  I relished a challenge, but the air was heavy with heat radiating from  the stage lights and the cloying odor of overcooked pork from the buffet  that had been sitting out for too long. The baccarat table's dealer had  a blank, unchanging expression; his smile seemed carved into his aging  face. I considered moving to another table or trying my luck at  blackjack, but all the dealers wore similar expressions of vacant  joyfulness.

At some point during  the night, I became aware of a subtle rasping noise so faint it was  almost maddening. At first, I thought it might be the nearby generators  or fans, but this was a separate sound. It almost seemed to be coming  from beneath us.

Three hours after  the games had begun, they came to an end. Someone, somewhere switched  off the fan centered on the flagpole, and someone else dimmed the  lights. Hidden speakers crackled to life, and a feminine voice with a  Boston accent said, 'The tables are now closed. Please return to your  trailers and enjoy a good rest. Tomorrow, the Experience will continue.”

I  picked up my tray of chips, only to have a liver-spotted hand push it  back down. “No need, the Attendant said. “They will be here when you  return.”

What else could I do but  shrug? I made my way out of the tent and, after a moment to orient  myself, started walking. Then I thought better of it and paused in the  shadows to have a smoke. I contemplated my winnings again and felt a  little pleased with myself.

"When  the cigarette was half-gone, a Smartly-Dressed Movie Star approached me  and asked if I had another. I gladly shared it and congratulated him on  his recent box-office success. He ignored the compliment and said, “I'm  out ten grand. I was on a hot streak, and then the dice turned cold on  me.”

Exhaling smoke, I nodded understandingly. “Dice can be fickle,” I replied. “You should try cards. You have more control.”

"I  came here to turn things around," he said, finishing his first  cigarette in record time and asking for a second. "I'm going  bankrupt—ex-wives, accountants, you know how it is. If things get any  worse, I may have to take part in a television movie. Can you imagine?  Me? On television?"

I could  imagine but didn't say so. "I have a few good investment ideas I could  share with you. Some companies that are gearing up to make it big."

"Oh yeah, and what's in it for you?" he inquired.

"I  help you, you help me," I replied. "I represent some artists who would  love soundtrack work. Nothing top 40 quality, but they have some good  filler songs that would..." My voice trailed off as a trio of Attendants  approached us.

"You need your rest," one of them interjected, toothlessly.

Another  one of the Attendants held out an ashtray. We stabbed out our smokes  and allowed ourselves to be led away. As I reached trailer 29, I found  the Attendant who had brought me here waiting. They sat beside the  trailer in a folding chair that listed ever so slightly to one side. I  asked, "Is there something wrong?"

"Not  at all," the Attendant stood up slowly. They opened the trailer door  and waited for me to step inside. "If there is anything you need, be it  food, sundries, or even narcotics, you need only ask. I will be right  here."

Then the Attendant sat back down in the chair and waited for me to close the door.

After  closing and locking the door, a feeling of being trapped washed over  me. I opened the refrigerator door to find several cans of off-brand  soda pop, a few candy bars, and a freshly made pork sandwich. It looked a  thousand times more appetizing than anything the buffet had to offer,  so I downed two of each. I let it all settle in my stomach and peered  out the front window of the trailer. Sure enough, the Attendant was  still there. They turned and looked my way. Their grin hadn’t faltered.

I backed away from the window, lay down on the lumpy bed, and slept in my clothes that night.

**Section Two:**

I  was jolted from my sleep by the stifling heat that filled the trailer. I  strained to recall my fading dreams but quickly gave up. A moment ago  they had been vivid and disturbing but now they were gone. I sat up,  shaking my head. I was never the type of person superstitious enough to  read meaning into my dreams or romantic enough to consider them worthy  of remembering.

The door was hot  against my fingers as I tugged it open and walked out into the scorching  sunshine. A new Attendant waited outside. He stood eagerly and spoke  before I could get a word in. “Can I help you?” they asked.

“No, I’m just heading out.”

“Oh no. Things won’t be ready until this evening. Whatever you need, I can fetch for you.”

“I was just going to get breakfast.”

They smiled gummily, 'I’ll bring you something to eat then.'

“Can’t I just get some fresh air?”

They cocked their head, “Are your windows stuck? I can help.”

So  I spent the day in the little trailer, a veritable prisoner. They  brought me Pop-Tarts for breakfast and a TV dinner for lunch.

Shortly  after sunset, there was a knock at the door. I opened it to see another  Attendant, this one handed me a card with a seat number on it and a  white carnation. I joined the crowd heading for the old Yellow Tent.  There was another long line to get inside and plenty of small talk-  politics, scandals, and musings about the stock market. I could hear the  Trust Fund baby berating a member of Disgraced Nobility over their  views on the American bombing of Cambodia. His only response was to make  fun of her for being too young during that time--only fifteen years  old- and thus, unable to comprehend the complexities of global politics.

When  it was my turn to pass through the entryway, I paused to take in the  remarkable renovations done to the inside of the Yellow Tent. Years  spent in the music industry had made me an expert at identifying a  poorly put-together venue, no matter how big or small, and this one was  like a miniature version of Madison Square Garden.

I  found my seat in the second row on the right. The stage was barren and  only held a grand piano equipped with a microphone stand beside it. To  either side of the stage, there were two Attendants sitting on folding  chairs with stacks of placards resting on their laps.

Ten  minutes passed, just long enough for all of us to get uncomfortable  with waiting. Then the lights brightened and a green flag unrolled from  somewhere at the top of the stage. It was dark green and stitched into  it was an abstract design resembling stars interwoven into a coiled  chain. This was the sigil of the Blighted Shadow, symbolized in the  seventh suit of the Old Deck.

A  woman walked out onto the stage, she wore a dress of the same shade of  green as the flag. There was something about her that made me think of  busy offices and overdue paperwork. We all clapped for her but she  shushed us and in a voice heavy with a Boston accent introduced herself  as the Mistress of Ceremonies. She instructed us to save our applause  for our host. She then seated herself at the piano and began to play.

As soon as I heard the opening three notes of the song, I recognized it and someone started singing offstage. *“It’s not unusual to be loved by anyone. It's not unusual to have fun with anyone…”*

A  man strode out onto the stage, he wore a glittering shirt and Cuban  heels. His hair was dyed jet black and greased into a pompadour. He held  a microphone in his left hand that sparkled like it was made of  diamonds and knowing how rich Charles Poelzig was it very well might  have been.

I thought I would be  ready for this part of the Experience but it took every ounce of my  concentration to keep from cringing. I’m sure everyone in the family has  told you that in my youth I wanted to be a singer, I think I said that  before, but I just want you to understand that I didn’t just come to  realize I was mediocre all by myself. Countless talent agents and  producers had to tell me that over and over until it finally sunk in.  I'm thankful for it now, there's more money to be made behind the  scenes.

No one had ever been brave  enough to stop Charles Poelzig from doing whatever he wanted. He was  too wealthy, too powerful, and too strange for anyone to dare say “No”  to him. Especially since he'd acquired the Old Deck.

And  while he would never have a song featured on America’s Top 40 or  perform on the Johnny Carson Show, every equinox Charles Poelzig played  to a packed house filled with the wealthiest and most powerful people in  the world.

Two hours dragged by,  two hours of Easy Listening standards punctuated with a bit of soft shoe  dancing. Any time there was a pause of more than a few seconds the  Attendants on the left and right side of the stage would raise their  placards to expose the word **’APPLAUSE’** in tall white letters on a black background.

I  played along with everyone else in the audience until our host launched  into his warbling version of Michael Martin Murphey’s signature song.

*“She comes down from Yellow Mountain. On a dark, flat land she rides. On a pony she named Wildfire…”*

That  song. That damned song. I felt a giggle rising and did my best to choke  it down. The people seated on either side of me watched in horror as I  buried my face in my hands. An absurd man was singing an even more  absurd song in an absurd setting. What else could I do? It wasn’t until  the end of the song that I managed to get myself under control.

Two  encores later, the audience tossed their carnations to the stage and  then were led out row by row. No one would make eye contact with me. It  was a perfectly understandable reaction. Like all petty dictators,  Charles Polzeig was as dangerous as he was absurd.

The  Attendant that led me back to my trailer was the broken-nosed one. The  friendly glitter in their eyes was gone. I tried to make small talk but  my words didn’t even elicit a grunt of acknowledgement.

There  were more Attendants waiting for me in the trailer. "Before I could  react I was shoved through the doorway. Two of them grabbed my arms and  spun me around. I struggled but they were all surprisingly strong. One  punched me in the kidneys, and another hit me in the stomach. They hit  me again and again until I begged them to stop. When my knees buckled  they held me up, when I begged them to stop they didn’t listen.  Throughout it all they never landed a single blow on my face.

Eventually, I threw up all over myself, then everything went dark.

**Section Three**

When I woke, my head was full of a grinding mechanical ache.

I  found I had been stripped down to my underwear and put to bed. They had  cleaned the blood from my face, and the puke from the floor and tucked  me into bed with care. Everything hurt but thankfully one of the  Attendants had left some high-quality painkillers and a bottle of my  favorite brand of Scotch sitting on the kitchen counter. As I waited for  sunset I finished both.

When an  Attendant came to lead me back to the Yellow Tent I eyed them  suspiciously. Was this one of the ones that had attacked me? There was  no way to tell for sure, my trailer had been dark, and aside from the  broken-nosed one, all of Poelzig’s strange little servants looked alike  to me. I tried to put the whole thing out of my head, I had a long night  of Baccarat to worry about.

The  line to get into the Yellow tent was quieter than before, no one talked  about inflation or the end of the war in Vietnam. No one smoked or  laughed or flirted. I could see the movie star up ahead of me, he was  staring at his shoes, his hands clenching and unclenching into fists.  Once I was inside and had gotten my winnings back I noticed the new flag  bore a single eye-like shape, with beams radiating out from its center.  That was from the eighth suit of the Old Deck, the sign of the  Shivering Deciever.

Don’t worry if  you don't understand; despite my studies, I still barely grasp its  meaning. Marvin had been the real expert, he’d done so much research in  anticipation of the Experience. Before the end, he would speak about how  each of the suits of the Old Deck symbolized the scared name of one of  the twelve Barishamada.

And about how the name Barishamada meant ‘Candle Barons’ in the witch language of Ezzerhoden.

And  about how Korvylar and Nyxeros “…engaged in unholy copulation amidst  the fervent tumult of the forsaken abyss to birth Calignox the Lord Of  Masks.”

And finally, in the end, how all that information meant nothing when he sat down across the table from Poelzeg.

Then  I started to notice the smell, which was sharp and sickeningly sweet  all at once. I glanced over at the buffet and saw that everything left  over from that had been left to rot. The vegetables had shriveled and  turned brown, and the pork tenderloin writhed with maggots. The trio of  Attendants that had been in charge of the buffet were still there; they  watched the grubs as they seethed up over the counter to drop onto the  floor with great interest.

I lit  up a cigarette to mask the odor of decay and made my way back to the  baccarat table where my winnings from two nights ago were waiting for  me.

The games began. I played  conservatively. No one else seemed to be playing it safe; they were all  making desperate bets and taking chances. At the poker table, a Smug  High-Ranking Official was cursing wildly, and a Woman in Expensive Furs  had begun to complain that there simply must be something wrong with the  dice. But it wasn't the dice, nor was it luck. They just weren't giving  those wizened and toothless Attendants enough credit.

I  slowly built up one stack of gold chips, then a second, and finally, a  third. The man to my right, the Owner of a Regional Supermarket Chain,  went completely broke and started to cry. Part of me wanted to slip him a  few chips out of pity.

But that  simply wasn’t done. When you were out, you were out. No favors from  other players, no calls to bankers or friends. Another rule of the  Poelzig Experience.

One of the  Attendants approached the unlucky man, pulled a green handkerchief from  the pocket of their tuxedo, and handed it over. The Attendant let him  dry his eyes before leading him away. He was only the first. Over the  next two hours, five more people lost the fortunes they had brought with  them. Most allowed themselves to be escorted out of the tent  peacefully. One tall man with an oversized nose and narrow chin made a  scene. It was almost funny, watching him being swarmed by elderly people  in tuxedos, hearing him curse and wheedle. They carried him out like a  child having a tantrum.

After  that, my luck started to turn, but I held out, bleeding chips and then  recouping some of what I’d lost a hand or two later. "Don't get greedy,"  I told myself. "Remember what you’re here for." But there was a  perverse thrill to it all, risking so much for so little. I wondered if  this is how skydivers felt when they jumped out of a perfectly good  plane.

By the time things closed  down for the night, I was ahead of where I started. Judging by the faces  of the people filing out of the Yellow Tent alongside me, I was  probably one of a select few.
