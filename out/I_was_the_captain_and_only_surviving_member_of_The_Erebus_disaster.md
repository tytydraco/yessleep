The cavernous blackness loomed before us, a gaping maw, hungrily waiting for whatever fool dared to venture into its depths.  Although all light was lost only a few inches in, shards of broken coral and shell rimmed its opening, refracting the headlights of our vessel in a strange pattern of splintered rainbows across the sea floor.  Anyone else would see a wicked, jagged-toothed sneer.  A warning to turn back.  But those of us aboard The Erebus only saw promise.  

The Erebus was an experimental deep-sea lab designed to carry a multinational research team to the depths of the Mariana Trench to study extremophile life and tectonic activity.  Aboard we had a xenobiologist, a geologist, a technician and systems operator, a navy lieutenant acting as our military liaison and security, and myself – the captain.  And on our third day at the bottom of the ocean, just east of a subset of islands near Guam, I stationed us at the lip of the deepest known point of Earth’s seabed.  All we had to do was cross that barrier of never-ending dark and plummet forth to the small, slot-shaped valley on the trench’s floor.  All we had to do was breach Challenger Deep.

“Are we ready, folks?”  Of course I knew they were ready.  These people, except for maybe the lieutenant, had been preparing for this for years.  So, after looking each of them in the eye and detecting not anxious apprehension at facing an unknown few men had ever braved before, but instead an unwavering resolve, I began our descent.

Deeper and deeper The Erebus crawled.  Natalia Reyes, the technician,  steadily worked the knobs and dials on the console in front of her.  She was equalizing the pressure and monitoring the SONAR system while I guided us through the void.  The plan was to settle on the floor of the ‘Deep – 11,000 meters below the surface – and spend whatever time we needed mapping not only the topography, but the *life*.  Not just the extremophile microscopic organisms that thrived in extreme environments or the angler fish of nightmares.  Dr. Patricia Voss, the xenobiologist, had some grandiose desire to find *sentience*.  Through her research, however harebrained other experts perceived her to be, she believed she had discovered the capacity for free thought in the depths of the ocean and this mission was her chance to prove it.  Maybe she was right, but I think all those thoughts swirling in that big brain of hers with nowhere to go gave her a God complex.

We were following a rough topographical sketch of the trench that Don Walsh and Jaques Piccard had laid out following their first voyage to the bottom with the Trieste.  Dr. Nils Halberd, the geologist, had it laid out before him and assured us as we descended that everything we were seeing matched up with what had been recorded.  Lieutenant Wade Harker stoically gazed at Natalia, who was doing just what she needed to in order to keep things steady.  And Dr. Voss was pouring over her notebooks and charts, muttering to herself about who knows what.  

But as we neared the 11,000th meter, a rumble from below shook the Erebus just enough to get us all to notice.  Normally, this wouldn’t have been anything to worry about.  The Maraiana Trench region is known to have its fair share of geological activity of varying intensities – active volcanoes, earthquakes, hydrothermal vent systems, things like that.  It was the creaking of tectonic plates shifting and separating that worried us.

Natalia and I did our best to keep the sea-lab on the straight and narrow, following our original trajectory, but the activity below us forced our hand.  We looked out the sheath of inches-thick glass in front of us and beheld a fissure cracking open the ocean floor.  It started as a hairline fracture along the silty bottom of the valley of the trench, almost imperceptible beneath the crushing obscurity of the dark oblivion.  Then, with a deep, seismic groan, as if the Earth was taking its first exhale after holding its breath for eons, it widened.  Sediment billowed up in plumes as the crevice tore through the seabed like wet tissue paper.  Superheated gases bubbled up in frantic bursts, rising from the void as brittle coral formations crumbled and drifted into it.  The surrounding terrain gave one final, terrible tremble, and then all settled, leaving a yawning rift in its wake.

“What the hell is that?” Natalia breathed in an awe-struck whisper, craning her neck to get a better view.  “Nils, do you know what could have caused that?”

The geologist had a look of terror on his face that told me he had no idea, but still he responded: “I mean, it had to have been some sort of earthquake; maybe too much pressure built up in a vent over time and it finally just…burst…”

He continued on, rattling off a multitude of explanations while the rest of the crew listened with rapt attention.  Well, all except for one.  The rest of them may not have seen, but I did.  Dr. Voss was still hunched over her notes, still muttering, but now there was a broad grin plastered on her face.  I never got a clear answer as to why she was so pleased, and she’s not around any longer to tell, but as our days above that newly-formed fissure progressed, I started to think that maybe her muttering had something to do with its creation.

As the dust settled and the shock of watching a natural phenomenon happen before our eyes wore off, a discussion of what to do next ensued.  Did we continue with the original plan?  Or now that we were faced with this great, profound wonder, did we take what fate had gifted us and explore further?  I don’t think myself or the Lieutenant were all too excited to veer off course, but the three big brains on board saw no other option.  We would dock the Erebus on the floor of Challenger Deep, but rather than explore the valley that surrounded us, we would dive deeper than any man had ever dreamed to venture.

On that first day, we decided to send out a small, exploratory vessel that sent a live feed of what it was seeing back to us.  Natalia and myself would be in charge of guiding it while Dr. Halberd mapped what he saw.  Voss would get her chance when we took a water sample or if Halberd found any living thing as he watched the live feed, but until then she just got to sit back and watch the magic.

We led the little pod, aptly named the Noctis Rover, into the split and found ourselves surrounded not by the basalt walls of the Earth’s crust, but instead in a cavernous opening, as if this trench-within-a-trench had always existed and we had merely cracked its shell.  We were beyond the hadal zone – we were in a world that was utterly alien.  At first, it appeared lifeless, nothing more than a grotto of fine, gray silt and jagged rock formations.  But the further the Rover went, the more we noticed.  There were strange, translucent creatures drifting slowly in front of its mechanical eyes.  Not unlike sea cucumbers, the pale and gelatinous forms moved in sluggish waves.  Noctis continued its extensive dive and witnessed soft, flabby bodies with the vacant expressions of deep-sea blindness hovering just above the surfaces of jutting outcrops littering the walls in staccatoed succession.  Improbable life was clinging to every facade – fields of tube worms, microbial mats with a faint, bioluminescent glow nourished only by chemicals released from the depths of the Earth rather than sunlight – and in its quiet stillness, it was easy to believe we were the first to ever see it.  We had stumbled upon the end of the world, or perhaps the beginning of one.

And then, amongst the awesomeness of unknowable, teeming life, we saw it.  The Noctis Rover had caught something massive in its sights, hewn from roughly shaped stones stuck together without the help of any type of mortar – a cyclopean structure.  It was almost castle-like, something pulled straight from the legends of giants and eldritch gods.  It rose from the inky blackness not as if it were built, but as if it had grown from some ancient impulse in the stone itself.  It defied the laws of all familiar geometry and physics, with impossibly large blocks each the size of a small house, so precisely aligned that not even the thinnest blade could slip between its cracks.  Its walls leaned at unnatural angles, tilting inward and outward, enmeshed with one another in a jaunty dance.  And their surfaces, weathered and pitted, were etched with symbols whose meaning had long since decayed.  The architecture of this place did not follow the logic of human design.  

It took an incredulous gasp from Natalia to snap us all back to reality.

“What is it?”  Harker asked, still not taking his eyes off of what the screen in front of us was displaying.

“The SONAR…it’s picking up a frequency.  It’s extremely low and it's being emitted by that…thing.  That structure.”

This was the point when Dr. Voss decided to leave her notes and speak up.  “We should take the Erebus down there, y’know where Noctis is.  That’s where we should dock.”

“Are you insane?” Harker scoffed.  “We have no idea what’s down there or if it’s safe.  I know you scientists are all about discovery and new frontiers and all of that, but I think this is where I draw the line, don’t you think Captain?”  He looked to me expectantly.

“I mean, I think that, while I am just along for the ride and here to take you folks wherever you need to go, I don’t know what kind of pressure we’re looking at down there and –”

Before I could finish, Natalia cut me off, assuring us all that she could handle it.  That the Erebus could handle it.  Drs. Voss and Halberd nodded along emphatically.  If you ask me, I think the science side of their brains took over the logical side, if those two can be separated from one another in the first place.  They were just too damn excited to be more than *researchers*.  They were on the cusp of becoming *discoverers*.  

So, the rest of day one was spent with Natalia and myself guiding the ship down, down down into that sunken grotto beneath the sea floor and carefully perching ourselves atop one of the outcroppings that got us as eye-level with the structure as we could be.  

With how quickly things progressed on that first day, it should have come as no surprise to any of us that by day two, the three scientists were bordering on obsessed.  Natalia had set about trying to figure out what kind of thing could be creating that sound while Nils attempted to decode how on earth something like this could have even been formed in the first place.  And of course, Voss was back to her muttering and scribbling, leaving Harker and myself with lots of spare time and little to talk about.

We had already rifled through the usual topics of conversation one opens themselves up to when stumbling upon the absurd and we surely couldn’t deign to talk about something as inconsequential as the weather.  

“What do you think she’s always whispering to herself about?” Harker questioned, casting a sidelong glance to Dr. Voss.

“Beats me, but I don’t like it.  It comes across as fanaticism, don’t you think?  That sort of thing festers.  And what festers can spread.  I don’t want that kind of attitude infecting the other two.”

“I’ll keep an eye out.  Whatever it is, I’m with you, buddy.  I won’t let things get out of hand.”

I didn’t know what he necessarily meant by that or what a trained military official who had been sent as our “security” on a deep-sea research expedition was capable of, but I sure didn’t want to find out.  I trusted that Harker would keep the best interests of the group at the forefront and I had to let that be that, otherwise the implications could drive me crazy.  Looking back, I suppose I didn’t have to worry about that for too long, because on the eve of day three, shit hit the fan.  By day four, they were all dead.

I awoke that next morning to find Dr. Halberd wildly flitting through pages of notes, eyes bloodshot and voice hoarse.  

“Nils, is everything alright?” I asked slowly, calmly.

“I’ve almost got it, almost got it, almost got it…” His voice trailed off.  “Patricia told me this would happen.  She knew I would be the perfect one for the job.”

“Patricia…You mean Dr. Voss?  What job, Nils?”

“Figuring it out!”

“Figuring what out, Dr. Halberd?” I addressed him by his proper title.  Maybe showing him that respect would remind him of his position.

“The architecture, my boy, the architecture!  The symbols!  The message to open the gate!  You see, it’s not sleeping.  It’s trapped – trapped in a prison of pressure and stone, bound by an ancient and extinct civilization who believed they understood the cost of its freedom.  But they were wrong.  Wrong!”

I had no idea what he was talking about, but I knew it was the ramblings of a man who had gone batty.  And it sounded to me like Voss had something to do with it.  For the moment, I left Nils to his rifling and gathered the Lieutenant and Natalia to tell them about the scene that had just unfolded before me.

Natalia seemed worried, but Wade again assured me that he wouldn’t let things get out of hand.

“He’s just some crackpot who’s gotten all wrapped up in his research.  We’ve only got a few more days down here until we’re meant to ascend, so let him and Voss keep spewing their mumbo-jumbo.  There’s no harm in it as long as they keep it to themselves.  How are you feeling, Reyes?  You gonna go crazy on us, too?”

Other than myself, Natalia was the last person I expected to go crazy on anyone.  She was mild-mannered and even-tempered, and always seemed to have a solid voice of reason.

She shook her head no and scoffed.  “You couldn’t pay me to get in on the kind of research those two have been talking about.  I think the dark and the quiet are getting to them, but I think you’re right, Lieutenant.  As long as the three of us keep calm, we can stick out the final few days.”

We didn’t last longer than twelve more hours.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

A caterwaul broke through the silence of sleep.  I ran to the ship’s hub to find Natalia, slack-jawed and stunned, standing over the body of Lieutenant Wade Harker.  She was trying not to cry, but the glassy sheen to her eyes told me it wouldn’t be too much longer until the floodgates opened.  Nils was pounding a clenched fist clutched around a bloody scalpel against our only window into the beyond.  Behind it, the masonic marvel was still towering and the hum of the sound only detectable by SONAR was stronger now, causing the water in its vicinity to ripple out from its walls in vibrating waves.

Nils was saying something – the words were quick, deliberate, yet still incoherent.  It sounded like “ee-zhoth-eer”, but even that wasn’t right.

“Natalia, Nils, what’s happening?” I questioned.

“I…I don’t know.  I heard banging and came out here and Wade was just…down and Nils was just…like that.”

“What’s he saying?”

“I don’t know, but…the more I listen, it’s kind of…pretty, isn’t it?  It sounds…like music.”

“Natalia, what are you –”

And before I could react, Natalia started in with Nils.

“Y’zhqoth-irr.  Y’zhqoth-irr.  Y’zhqoth-irr.  Y’zhqoth-irr.  Y’zhqoth-irr.”

“Beautiful, isn’t it?”  Dr. Voss intoned from behind me.

“Patricia, what do you know?  What is this?”

“They’re speaking the name of The Seed Beneath the Root of Time, a god – well, not in the traditional sense, more of an intelligence, really – that precedes causality.  She lives coiled in the folds of forgotten dimensions, looping endlessly, waiting for Her followers to speak Her name.  It’s a ripple in the loom of reality – can’t you feel it?  Your bones itching beneath your skin with patterns of unfamiliar geometry?  Those symbols were designed to contain Her, to keep Her locked in the threads between dimensions.  But we’ve figured out how to set Her free, and for that She will grant me eternity.”  

What the fuck was this woman talking about?  Gods, intelligence, forgotten dimensions?  It was too much for me to handle.  I needed to get Natalia and Nils to snap out of whatever trance Voss had put them in and get them the hell out of here.  I didn’t care what happened to The Good Doctor, but I did care that myself and my compatriots got our asses onto the life egress vehicle attached to the back of the Erebus and got ourselves to the surface.

I took the subtlest step towards them that I could, when all of a sudden Nils stopped his rhythmic chanting.  Natalia continued on, but there was something grievously wrong with Nils.  His eyes rolled back into his head, exposing the inflamed veins flecking the whites.  He was clearly fighting against something, and in a heartbeat, it won.

Fleshy nodules began to appear all over his body, like swollen insect bites, bulbous and sickening.  They strained his skin until it shined, taut and waxy.  Clustered across his back, neck, arms, some remained the peachy-pink of skin with fine tendrils suspended just below their surface like nerves or mycelium, while others darkened into a deep, mottled purple or a livid, burning red.  As they formed, they twitched and shifted, as if all of the muscles and tendons beneath were rearranging themselves to make way for this anatomical anomaly.  They began to seep a clear, viscous fluid as thick as resin that left them coated in a slick, glistening sheen that made them twitch at their exposure to air.

He began beating the glass harder and harder, slamming his entire body into it, thin vein-like cracks beginning to bristle out from his point of impact.  Natalia continued letting her words flow over one another like silk.  And Voss laughed and laughed.  They were going to die here, but I wasn’t.  I got into the L.E.V. and programmed its mechanics as quickly as possible.   

As I began my ascent to the surface, I took one final fleeting glance at the ruin I was leaving behind.  I don’t know how Nils’s body was still whole, but there it was, suspended in the water with arms outstretched like Christ himself, sporting that same bioluminescent glow as all of the symbiotes of the deep.  The fleshy nodules that had littered his form began to pulse, as if something inside were pushing, writhing, impatient to emerge.  And then, the flesh around them tightened, drawing inward in slow, throbbing contractions.  One by one, they sank, slipping beneath the surface of his skin, melting into it.  The surrounding tissue rippled gently, like water disturbed by a submerged hand, before settling smooth again.  

The sickly blue-green aura around Nils blazed, and with that his skin split.  The nodules had not disappeared, they had gone deeper, only to burst forth from ruptured mounds leaving shallow, red-cratered sockets rimmed with torn dermis and twitching muscle behind.  And from each of these grotesque holes slithered a glistening, veined orb, slick with amniotic fluid. 

The eyeballs continued to shoot out of poor Nils, each one with pearl-gray sclera and irises that swirled a luminescent black like an oil slick.  They trailed long, fine, rootlike nerves that drifted in their wake like the tendrils of some freakish jellyfish.  The filaments writhed in an obscene manner, as though they were tasting their new environment, sensitive and searching.

They did not stay still.  They dangled, unmoving for mere seconds, until at once, in one grand, sweeping, synchronous movement, they turned their focus to the movement of my pod.  It was a monstrous choreography of awareness, blooming from the realization of newly-found sentience.  And it was in that moment I knew that whatever god Dr. Voss had been searching for from the very beginning had been freed, with the ocean itself its new body, a flood of madness spreading through the seas.

I made it out because I didn’t let myself fall down the claustrophobic, labyrinthine tunnel of discovery.  You see, in those few short days 11,000 meters deep, I learned that the unknowable vastness of the ocean can be both a sanctuary and a prison.  It stretches in every direction, promising depth and revelation.  It has no floor, only layers and currents and truths buried so far below the surface that reaching them may drown you.  The deeper you go, the higher the pressure mounts, the more the light fades.  And this is where the pursuit of understanding, once infinite and thrilling, becomes a tunnel – tight, spiraling, recursive.  And while it is a place where mystery still breathes, it is also a place of isolation, obsession, and descent.  Not everything that is buried is meant to be unearthed, and down there, in that cold pressure of the dark, you must ask yourself:  *Do I still want answers?  Or do I just want to find the bottom and rest?*
