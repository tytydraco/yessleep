I awake. Again.

I check the clock on the wall.
01:07, AM maybe. Feels like it.

I look at the table, at the lost surrounding it.
The room smells like sulphur. I think it's my favorite smell. 
I know it is. 

It's time. Again. 
Three live, three blank.
Fifty-fifty.

It racks.
I smile and whimper.

It's my turn.

I pick it up.
I look at the one to my left. 
I don't know them.
I look at the one to my right. 
I do know them, from the parking lot.
Or maybe the bathroom.

01:08

My cell phone rings.
I flip it open.
Static. I hear it, then I listen to it.
Then I know. Third live. 
That's one live that isn't currently racked.
Probability says a blank is most likely chambered.

I like probability. It's safe. 

I look back at the one from the bathroom. 
Or the balcony.

I point it at myself. 
I feel fear. Feels good.
I tickle the trigger as a tear reaches my grin.

Then they laugh. The one from the balcony.
Or maybe…

Wait. 

Is it me they’re laughing at?

I flip it around.

My grin grows wider. So does theirs.

The bass coming from the rotted out speakers upstairs don't sound muffled as they should. Every note comes in clear, surrounding my mind almost as if originating from inside of it.
I love it. I loved it from the moment it wormed its way into my head.

How long have I been thinking about this? 

01:08

They laugh again and the music gets louder.
I don't ask if they're ready because I don't need to. 

I pull the trigger. 

Click.

3 live, 2 blank and 2 away from a live.

I flip the gun around and hand it to the spared.
Their eyes change, deepen. The control is theirs now and I think they like it.

They rack the slide and hesitate little. They point it at the third one. 

They pull the trigger.

A fireball spews from the muzzle as a deafening boom bites my eardrums.

I wipe the third one off my face as their decapitated torso bleeds out onto the table.
I feel like it should bother me.

The one who remains hands it back to me. 

2 live, 2 blank, 1 away from a live. 

I rack it. 

Probability says if I point it at myself I won't win. 

01:08

Fuck probability.

I put the muzzle in my mouth and bite.
I glance over at the other. I hold them in suspense. Just for fun.

I tap the trigger. Then again. Once more.
They're getting impatient. They can’t stand it.
They love it.

I pull it.

Click.

My turn again.

I rack it.

I point it at them. My eyes and smile soften saying all that need be known.

They start crying, laughing. Pleading. Pleading that they might play again.

The music is everywhere. Their ears bleed.

The light hanging over the table flickers more violently than usual.

It’s over. I win.

I pull it.

Their hysterical moans cease.

The light goes out.

The music stops.

I sit in the pitch black, in silence.

Then I feel it. A cold hand on each shoulder.

A static in my ear.

You may leave.

The door I came in so long ago opens. I get up and approach it. I go through it and make my way up the stairs, to the balcony then to the exit. 

A breeze kisses my forehead. I see the sun’s crest emerging in the distance.

I can go.

I turn around and look back inside.

I can go.

But I don’t wanna.

I lick my lips.

I don’t go back downstairs. I don’t need to. I’m already there. Here.

I never left.

I check the clock on the wall.

01:07

AM, maybe.

Feels like it.
