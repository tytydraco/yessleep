Do you remember that feeling we all had as kids? The one that sucks the air from your lungs as you lunge for your bed after turning the lights? The one that tells you undoubtedly that ‘there’s somebody behind you, RUN!’ ? If you’re most people, you’re lucky and outgrow this for the most part. But I have lived on a constant edge of terror since the night something chased my best friend and myself up the boardwalk through the woods. 

I made it out; Charlie didn’t.

Like most teenagers that grow up in this town, we frequently walked down to the beach to smoke weed. It was generally left alone because we weren’t loud, we were the only ones down there, and we weren’t driving anywhere. 

The most dangerous part of the endeavor was really just picking your way down the boardwalk at night. Again, not that we really needed to sneak down there, but it did make us feel generally better about it to not disturb the neighbors with our phone’s bright ass flashlights. So we used our phone screens on a dark background to light just the few boards ahead of each step. It helped too that I had grown up here and Charlie has been coming down here with me for years; you walk on it enough in the dark and you get to know where every step, creak and turn is.

The only thing that stands out in my mind’s memory of that night was feeling more consciously aware of the animal noises than normal. It was eerily quiet most of the way down, but toward the end by the last bench I remember hearing two animals run opposite directions, one heading our way. Didn’t really seem worth a second thought, I had just happened to notice because generally they tend to scatter in the same general direction; away from the intruders.

The walk itself is pretty quick, usually takes about 4 minutes to walk down and about 7 to get back up. Factor in that we’re both… less than athletic and stoned, it takes us about 7 minutes to get down and 20 to get back up- the gradual incline is a bitch. The night Charlie disappeared it felt like we’d spent 3 hours running up that boardwalk. I’m never going to feel safe in the dark again.

Our joint passed in much the usual fashion, tossing some rocks in the water, chatting and making each other laugh. But Charlie seemed kind of unsettled the whole time, he kept asking if I heard or saw something moving up in the woods behind us. I looked. I listened. But there was nothing out of place as far as I could tell.

So once he said it a third time I realized he was more paranoid than his words let on and suggested we head back up. His relief was palpable as I watched his nervous energy focus to motivated movement to the staircase that led back into the darkness. 

The first point of ‘fuck I don’t like this’ in the paranoid stoner’s journey back up the boardwalk is after the second flight of stairs. At the top the angle changes just enough to obscure everything but the water and a few steps in you’re cut off from what little light the beach had offered. The trees create a sort of tunnel with only patches of the dark clouded sky peaking through. But it’s not a picturesque tunnel no matter the time of year. Even with the maples and oaks high above waving gentle green flags of comfort the sandy bluffs support more desolate, sparse, dead and creaking dune plants. The shell decorations on them look sweet in the day and equally as menacing at night. It all just… makes you pick up the pace a bit. Not quite hurrying, just not lollygagging as one might normally after a joint.

It was maybe 3 yards past that point that I started to feel the same unease Charlie was still clearly being bothered by. It was really just like that feeling that you know somebody is watching you and you want to whip your head in all directions to find the eyes you feel on you but some instinct leads you lock dead ahead for fear of what eye contact might bring out of the darkness- I can’t see you, you can’t see me- hide and seek rules; plain and simple. It’s easy to rely on childhood logic and insist to yourself that the eyes on the back of your neck are just that of an owl and your red and glassy eyes wouldn’t be able to pick it out of the dark anyways- so why bother to look?

Without having to verbalize our intensifying discomfort, we both picked up the pace just to the point of breathing a little heavier. It sort of helped really, the louder our breathing the less we could hear the creaks and groans of the woods spooking ourselves for no reason. It established an unspoken agreement that we were going to seriously hustle as we approached the second section of boardwalk that really reinforces that feeling, “fuck, I really really don’t like this”. The boardwalk makes a 90 degree left turn in such pitch black darkness that you’d think the boardwalk just ended if you didn’t know to make the turn.

It was just after that turn that Charlie’s footsteps skidded to a dead stop like he was trying not to run into something. He told me to hold up a sec because he was taking a picture on night mode- something we regularly did on these walks back up when we wanted to reassure ourselves there was no boogeyman hiding in the dark. He only gasped out a whisper of disbelief, “oh FUCK!”.

When I looked back I was blinded by the flash from his iphone, the iconic ‘click’ of a photo being taken as Charlie gasped. I asked him what the hell he was doing and he sounded like my kid brother when he choked out “I’m scared Bethany, did you see that?” It was so dark and my eyes hadn’t readjusted from the flash and I was telling that to Charlie as I took out my phone to snap a picture with the flash of him so he could see how it felt. I thought he was just high and spooked- it wouldn’t have been the first time it happened to us and I was annoyed at him for getting me scared with him and then blinding me. If I'm being honest, I really thought he was just screwing with me or I wouldn't have blinded him back with the camera flash. But as I looked down at the photo my stomach dropped and I could feel the blood leave my face pale in cold fear. The last picture I ever took of Charlie was the most terrified, distorted face choking on a scream that I will never unhear. His scream was so guttural it scraped the inside of my skull as it raced down my spine to settle in my rock bottom stomach. I didn’t know if I was going to throw up or cry when I spun around with my flashlight and didn’t see Charlie. He was just… gone. I froze, unsure how to help my friend much less myself as I heard him struggling, then heard him being dragged deeper into the woods away from what little light made the boardwalk feel safe. 

As I sucked in as much air as humanly possible to let out a shriek of my own when I heard Charlie moaning in agony, the last words he would ever say to me: “Beth, rrRRRrruuuuuuuun”. I regret that I didn’t think twice before taking off, but I couldn’t see Charlie or anything else out in the woods for that matter. I just knew I had to run for help. I couldn’t see anything outside the reach of my flashlight but I could hear something rustling the leaves moving fast toward the boardwalk- toward me and my light. I ran for the last few flights of stairs like my life depended on it, begging for the sweet relief of the streetlamp at the top and the false safety it promised if I could just run fast enough to get to the gates. I was tripping and falling as my legs propelled me forward of their own accord. I could feel the blood dripping down my legs where they caught sharp pieces of wood climbing on all fours trying to pull my body up the stairs like an rabid animal outrunning certain death. I could hear someone breathing behind me and the muscles in my back tightened at the notion that whatever it was it was gaining on me.

It almost felt like a bad dream that I was waking up from I was so relieved to see the gate come into view. I felt like I could fly I ran so hard and fast at that gate. My arms out in front of me I threw the gate open and shut behind me so hard the clang of metal when it didn’t click shut was loud enough for a neighboring porch light to come on to see what all the ruckus was. I was stumbling backward crying and pointing when they asked me what happened. They told me I was babbling about the gate and how we had locked it and demanding to know who had unlocked it. And I sobbed as I told them that something got Charlie. The reality of it all came crashing down on me and the last thing I remembered was the start of a panic attack before I blacked out and woke up in the ambulance.

I was checked over and physically and mentally as okay as could be expected. The final diagnosis was PTSD due to a marijuana induced psychosis. See, they never did find Charlie. Or any trace that he or anyone else had been there. There were no footprints. There were no disturbances in the leaves indicating a teenage boy had been dragged through here. They insist I'm mistaken about the gate being locked behind me and I still insist, that gate automatically locks and is only unlocked when there is a key in the mechanism. And most troubling, his location according to his phone, was and had been at home all night. 

Charlie wasn’t at home though, and they eventually chalked it up to a runaway and my psychotic break was part of how my brain on drugs decided to cope with Charlie’s disappearance. They honestly believe I was alone in the woods that night. And now I can’t stand to be alone, much less in the dark. But I need to know what happened to my friend all those years ago. I don’t think I’ll ever know for sure. Or if I really am okay. 

When I went back for the first time at night, I knew I would not be able to go any further than the safety of the streetlight at the top. As I faced the gate to take a picture, honoring Charlie in my own way, the picture was out of focus and obscured by the streetlight. Keeping my body and face in the yellow pool of flickering light, I reached my arms into the shadow toward the boardwalk and held my breath as the seconds ticked by forming one of our traditional night-mode-safety-check photos. When I opened the result, I was sure I’d made a mistake. But the time stamp read correctly; 

The picture that popped up was taken from inside the boardwalks gate.
