The truck smelled like old pine and dust. The kind of smell that came from many hours up and down forest trails. Samantha drove with one hand on the wheel, the other arm rested casually in the window frame. Noah sat behind her, eyes stuck to a rugged tablet with a thick case that looked like it had been dropped more times than it had been updated. Chris rode in the back seat behind me, watching the treeline slide past. Some country music was lightly playing over the radio as we rode along.

The city thinned out fast. Concrete became scarce as we headed out of town and up the old mountain roadways. We passed a few areas that had signs designating state trails, heading further into the wild.

Cell service faded somewhere behind us, unnoticed except by Noah, who muttered something about buffering as he tapped the screen frustratingly with his stylus.

“So,” I said finally, breaking the steady hum of the tires. “What exactly are we doing today?”

Chris glanced at me. “Field checks. Couple of weak spots flagged overnight.”

“Weak spots?” I repeated.

He smirked. “Openings in the Veil.”

That word stuck. “Openings in what?”

Noah snorted softly without looking up. “Here we go.”

“That’s just what Chris calls it,” Samantha said. “Poetic I guess.”

Chris shrugged. “Sounded more interesting than Harmonic Anomaly. The boss liked it, but didn't change it on the paperwork.”

I turned slightly in my seat. “Harmonic Anomaly? What is that?”

Samantha spoke up. “Its a tear in reality. Most are hairline cracks. Others are open wider. Occasionally they collapse on their own, without us intervening. Others…” She trailed off, eyes still on the road.

“Others don’t?” I finished.

“Others don’t,” she agreed.

I thought about the tunnel. The encounter with that thing. It couldn't be a coincidence it was there.  

“And if something comes through?”

Chris didn’t answer.

Noah didn’t either.

Samantha said it plainly. “Then we deal with it.”

The foothills rose ahead of us, dark green against the bright sky. Pines crowded in, the canopy shading us the deeper we went. The road narrowed into something that barely deserved to be called one before Samantha finally pulled off near a weathered trailhead sign. Our first site.

We hiked in single file. The air smelled dry, rich with pollen and pine needles. Birds chirped overhead, but their echoes sounded... off. Not wrong enough to alarm you. Just wrong enough that you noticed if you were listening.

Noah stopped near a shallow clearing, eyes locked on his tablet. “This is it.”

I didn’t see anything.

Chris knelt, setting down a thick case and popping it open. Inside were devices that looked like they were built with what was leftover from an old Radio Shack. The first looked like a combined sub woofer inside a small satellite dish that was shoved into a cube shaped housing. Almost seemed like some tool a surveyor would set up, but we weren't marking measurements.

He placed one carefully on the ground, adjusting its angle atop a tripod that unfolded from the bottom. Samantha set up another just as quickly on the opposite side.

“Neat, huh? These open the Veil,” he said, nodding to the device. “Makes the distortion visible.”

“And the other?” I asked.

Chris held up something cylindrical, about the size of a thermos, reminded me of a mortar shell as he loaded it into the end of what looked like a child sized bazooka. This clearly wasn't a kids toy, however.

“This one convinces it to close.”

Noah tapped a command. The ground devices emitted a low, vibrating sound, like you would feel from the deep base of a huge stereo speaker. They blasted the noise where their aim synced.

The air pressure changed.

It didn't move, but shifted. Light bent strangely in front of us, like heat over asphalt. Sound warped too. My boots crunching on dead leaves came back at me sharper but from the wrong direction. At the center was a thin line like a crack in the air that refracted light like a prism.

“There,” Noah said. “Veil’s open.”

Chris armed the second device and launched it forth with a slight arc towards the distortion. It vanished mid-air.

A heartbeat later, a low-frequency thump rolled through the clearing, more felt than heard. Like a depth charge detonating underwater.

The distortion collapsed in on itself. The forest snapped back into place.

Birds resumed singing.

Noah checked the tablet. “Signal’s gone. Resonance is clear.”

Chris already had the case closed. “Good job. Let’s move on to the next one.”

"Is that it?" I thought to myself

I stood there a second longer, staring at the empty space where reality had just cracked, then we fixed it, like we were some sort of cosmic window repairmen.  

We did it again. And again.

One site barely registered. Noah waved it off. “Not worth touching. It’ll collapse on its own.”

Others got the same treatment. Open, disrupt, closed. Somewhere in the middle of the day we paused briefly for a lunch, Noah handing us all sandwiches from a cooler in the back like we were on a picnic.

Through the casual chit chat I learned there were several other teams like ours. Each set of teams took an eight hour shift on rotation, closing openings in the veil, investigating reports of disturbances or "events" as the monitoring system flagged them. I guessed these were where things or people slipped through the cracks.

By the third one, it was beginning to feel like just another day at the office.

The fifth, however, held a surprise for us that I wasn't entirely sure I was ready to face yet.

As we were nearing the last site, Noah hands me a small tablet with the same signal program loaded. The screen folded together to close it.

"Fancy." I remarked, "New cellphone?"

"Yup. Just finished getting it set up, Spyglass app ready to go," he lowered his voice slightly "and my personal VPN encryption."

"Thank you." I said , sliding the device into my inner coat pocket.

"Unfortunately," he added "it also comes with your first task. The system noted a couple of GPS signals nearby that didn't leave the area, so we'll need to check that out and see if we can find anything."

"Time to go to work, detective." Samantha added.

I nodded in agreement. my first assignment. Familiar, but with new angles.

The old rock quarry sat like a scar in the earth. Gray stone walls dropping away into a wide bowl, water pooled at the bottom so clear you could almost make out the bottom. The far side of the bowl sloped down for where the trucks could drive in and get their loads. A part of the wall had collapsed leaving a scattered field of granite boulders.

A chain link fence with holes, missing panels and no trespassing signs falling off once was a deterrent for trespassers but over time just became part of the landscape.

We parked the truck and got out. Noah stayed in his seat claiming that the signal was not stable so he needed to pinpoint the opening.

Chris stayed with him while Samantha and I moved on through the broken chain link fence heading down the incline to the flatter bottom of the quarry. The whole area had been trespassed on and used over the years so there was all manner of litter, old tires and the remains of campfires that had long smoldered out. I stopped just back from a littered area that had seen a lot of traffic, then crouched down to study the terrain.

Samantha stepped up beside me. 

"Hard to tell anything with all the garbage around." she said.

"The story is right here," I noted, "you just have to know how to read it." Then I pointed out in front of me.

"See what's left of that fire over there? The charcoal isn't dull and faded, it's newly burnt. See the less faded beer cans laying around it?"

She followed as I pointed.

 "They're not buried into the soil from wind and rain, they're resting on top of the ground. Recently dropped. The shoe prints in the soil press in deeper there than the others. Fresher, not covered over by time."

I adjusted my hat, "I would say at least two people were here, probably late last night."

She checked the tracking timestamp on her own phone, then chuckled. "Impressive," she said, "two cell signals stopped at 11:20 pm. We'll mark it as a confirmation."

I stood up as she began to walk off towards Noah and Chris who are now making their way down the hill.

"We're going to send in an anonymous tip or..?" I asked suggestively

"No." She said flatly. "We have more important things to do here."

The way she said that made my temper flare up.

"More important than two lives lost out in nowhere? Families broken by loss and grief?"

She turned back to me, a look of sympathy on her face but her eyes were focused and determined, like she'd asked the same question once before.

"If we don't do our job, and we fail to get this under control, it only breaks further and the threat scales higher and higher."

She looked me in the eye, "Then everyone could end up like Paul." 

That cut deeper than I wanted.

Noah slowed before he even reached the bottom of the ramp. “This one’s live.”

“How bad?” Samantha asked.

He swallowed. “Active. Resonance just Spiked.”

The air suddenly felt heavy. Sound carried wrong too. Our voices echoed, but only once. No decay. No fade.

This one was visible before we affected anything. Same refractory crack in mid air, only this one branched out with more legs and a larger gap at the center.

Chris’s jaw tightened. “Alright. Same drill. We gotta move quick.”

They barely got the first device powered before it happened.

This time there was no subtlety. All sound froze in an instant with a change in air pressure as the fissure began to expand at the center.

The veil opened.

Something pushed through.

It sprung out into the daylight, like a lion leaping out from the brush. Its skin was pale, stretched tight over the bone. Sharp bristles emerged in ridges along its body and limbs. Oval shaped head with a mouth full of razor teeth and pitch black eyes. Its shriek was a terrible noise that reverberated with both heavy and sharp tones together, like broken glass rolling into the heavy strum of a bass guitar. 

I raised the revolver on instinct. A slight waver in my hands as I steadied myself.

“So that’s what it looks like,” I breathed.

Samantha fired first.

The thing recoiled and bounded for the scattered mound of boulders on the other side of the bank where the wall had toppeled in.

She took off after it, Chris right behind her with his own weapon drawn. I hesitated only for a moment and followed the chase.

"We can't let it escape!" She shouted as she fired another shot, richocheing off a rock as the creature dove into the small field of stones. We heard her, but her voice fell flat in the distortion.

We circled the area, eyes trained on every corner and shadow. It emerged again, leaping up onto a high boulder near me and flaring at me with a raspy hiss. Its bristles seemed to vibrate with its posturing.

I aimed down sight and sent two shots straight at it. The rounds punched harder than I anticipated. No time for target practice.

It leapt back when I fired, one shot missing and the other hit its thigh. It screeched in pain as it fell behind the stone. As I circled back it was gone, scurried off into another vantage.

As I looped back around I caught sight of Chris emerging from between some boulders, he gave me a quick nod and then headed down another center line between the stones. I followed him through at a distance.

Just a short ways in the creature reappeared, this time right between us and it had its sights set on Chris. Too close to fire so I shouted as I rushed it. Just in range, I kicked my foot as hard and fast as it began to pounce and my boot connected with its ribs.

I thought I was strong but I really didn't expect how brittle it felt despite its speed and strength. I felt bones crack and snap and the impact of my kick sent it into the stone, crunching again when it collided. Just for good measure, I raised my revolver and gave it 3 last rounds to finish the job. It felt somewhat cruel... but that last shot was for Paul.

Samantha caught up to us at this point. She took her place beside us as we watched the creature twitch weakly on the ground.

"You got it." she said, voice clear next to us.

Finally just at the last exhale that this creature would breathe, it just began to dissolve. It didn't melt away, as if some acid was poured on it but more like if you lit a paper towel and the small trail of fire eats away the paper leaving flakes of ash. It only took a moment and then the threat that was present before was suddenly gone, nothing but a small bit of ash left where it once rested.

It was then that we noticed that the sound had returned and the air pressure had lightened back to the normal comfort it was before. Noah walked up to us, carrying the launcher for the closing device.

"I got it guys, veil is closed now." He said then noticed the small ash layer on the ground. "Oh, you killed it."

I was still trying to process what I saw.

"Okay... can somebody explain to me what just happened?"

"Ill give it a try," Chris began, "you see, atoms and molecules all vibrate at certain frequencies. So you could say we are 'tuned' to our world, but those creatures dont belong here. Thats why theres the issues with sound when they come through. The two differing frequencies are fighting each other, then if it dies..."

He looked down "Whats keeps it stable gives up. Its structure breaks down back to the basic elements. At least, thats my theory."

Somehow closing cracks in reality felt a little easier to handle than something disintegrating right in front of me. We stood around in a circle for a moment longer before Samantha spoke up next.

"Well, this was our last stop for the day. Our shift is going to be up soon. We should get back and give our final report to the Cheif for the next shift."

We made our way back to the headquarters. Gave our reports and findings for Ward and the analysts, and we "clocked out". No actual punch clock, just off our rotation.

The guys insisted on celebrating my first day on the job and my first creature takedown. 

I knew just the place.

The pub hadn’t changed. The same soft lighting. Same epoxy coated oak bar top. Same spot down at the far end where the bartender saved me a seat and a glass ready to serve. I may have worn down the surface of the counter there just a little over the years.

Samantha took the stool beside me without hesitation, like she’d been here a hundred times before, even though I knew she hadn’t. Chris and Noah slid into a booth behind us, menus already in hand. Noah ordered a soda. Chris asked about the cocktail list like he was killing time, not monsters.

Two scotches on the rocks hit the bar in front of us.

I lifted mine. Let the ice settle.

"To your first day on the job." She said as our glasses softly clinked together.

We sat there for a minute, watching the room. A couple arguing quietly in a corner. Someone laughing too loud near the dartboard. Life continuing on like it always did.

Finally, I spoke again.

"So, Miss Hale," I began and she cut me off, not rudely

"Please, call me Sam. You've earned that today."

"Alright, Sam then." I said cracking a smile. “I've been meaning to ask...The last guy, The one before me.”

Her gaze fell to the glass. Just rolled it once between her fingers.

“Yeah,” she said. “It was personal.”

I nodded. I had suspected it was for someone on the team.

“He was my fiancé,” she said. No crack in her voice. Just a fact, like a case detail. “We were both FBI. Both stubborn. Both bad at letting things go.”

I looked to her eyes then. She still hadn’t looked back.

“We started seeing patterns,” she went on. “Disappearances. Reports that didn’t line up. Things supervisors didn’t want to touch.” A breath. “When we pushed, we were told we were seeing things. Stress. Burnout.”

She paused.

"Robert was sharp, like you," she continued "we followed a similar path you did, ran into an ANCR team mid-op in Arizona, tracking a creature through some town in the middle of nowhere. We took it down. They gave us a peak behind the curtain, and we joined immediately."

She took a breathe and exhaled, "Fast forward eight months, and we're down south in Florida. Same job, different day. Another creature hunt. We got it, but... Robert didn't make it."

I didn’t say I was sorry. Didn’t say anything at all.

She took a drink instead.

“This world,” she said, staring into the amber like it might answer back, “takes a lot from you when you get too close to its secrets.”

The words settled heavy between us.

"But," she stated "someone has got to patch the holes and keep the world spinning, right?"

I nodded in agreement. She had made her point clear back at the Quarry.

She glanced sideways. “You got anyone? Any people?”

“Had,” I said. "A friend, young man named Ethan. Good guy. He became my last case... Then my partner Paul."

I took a sip "Both gone now." My turn to stare at my reflection in the glass.

"I think he was transfered over to me as a punishment. For him. Stuck with the old Wolf on the backwoods trails. He didn't deserve... he was a good cop. A good partner." 

She waited.

“And there’s Gabs,” I added. “Back at the department.”

That earned a small nod, beckoning me to continue.

"She's charming. Works in Forensics. Loves her work, and apples." I chuckled "and she makes me laugh." 

She smiled warmly, then finished her drink in one last swallow and set the glass down with emphasis.

“Well then. Don’t hesitate,” she said. “If something matters, don’t let it disappear while you’re waiting to be sure.”

She stood, and pushed her stool back in place.

"Oh, by the way... Me and Noah pulled a few threads. The new ending of your last story."

She waved her hand in front of her, "Detective Wolfe, honored for excellence in the line of duty. Granted early retirement with full pension."

Suddenly my glass felt like it gained twenty pounds.

"I... Thank you... How?"

She winked "FBI, remember? I still have a few tricks. Its a better ending than most of us got before joining. Definitely beats our hazard pay."

She turned to leave.

“See you tomorrow, Wolfe. Happy retirement."

And then she was gone, the door swinging shut behind her, letting in a wash of cold night air before sealing it out again.

I felt eyes on the back of my head and turned to see Chris and Noah studying me. Not staring. Just that professional gaze when you measure out someones performance on the job. Chris nodded in approval.

He lifted his glass.

“You gonna stay welded to that barstool all night, or would you like some company?”

I hesitated. The stool felt familiar. Like my safe little island off the bar table peninsula. But I slid off it anyway and joined them at the booth.

Noah glanced up from the menu. “What’s good here?”

I laughed. “No idea. I don’t come here for the food.”

He stared at me expectantly.

“Chicken wings?”

“Perfect,” he replied, like I’d just solved a riddle.

"A good meal for a good days work" Chris added.

The wings showed up fast, steaming hot and coated in sauce. We didn’t bother with plates. Just tore into them like we hadn't eaten all day.

Chris wiped his hands on a napkin and leaned back. 

“So. You asked earlier about backgrounds.”

“Figured I would,” I said. “Seems fair.”

“Search and rescue,” he said. “A good SAR team from the west coast that went everywhere. Floods, fires, mountains. Lost a few people. Always tried to find a few more.” A shrug. “Used some grant money to go back to school. Archaeology.”

I raised an eyebrow. “That’s a pivot.”

He grinned. “Thought it’d be a good excuse to travel. Dig in the dirt. Find some cool artifacts.”

The smile faded just a touch. “Turns out old things don’t always stay buried.”

Noah went quiet.

“I had theories,” Chris went on. “Portals. Doorways. Not the whole conspiracy thing outright, but it seemed like there were ancient places out there built around some connection we couldn't see.” He laughed softly. “Everyone thought I was nuts.”

“Until you weren’t,” I said.

“Best and worst day of my life,” he agreed. “Middle East. Old ruins that clearly looked like some kind of doorway. It was, turns out. Something big came through it. Bigger than what we saw today."

His eyes unfocused for a second. “I'm quick on my feet, but it nearly tore the whole structure down chasing after me. ANCR pulled me out before it finished the job.”

I nodded slowly.

I turned to Noah. “Alright. Let me guess. You’re secretly an assassin.”

He barked a laugh. “Please. My aim is terrible.”

“So what’s your deal?”

“Computers,” he said. “Coding and software development. I wanted something in demand with an easy paycheck. It's just so darn boring.”

“I Disagree,” I said “My friend Gabs is great with computers. She once digitally reconstructed someones face with only a skull for reference. Exact match.” I said proudly.

"Yeah, thats not creepy at all." He smiled. “Storm chasing, though, that’s where I got my adrenaline. Anchored to the road, inside the funnel of a massive tornado. Whole world screaming around you while you hang on.” He said gesturing with both hands.

Chris winced. “You’ve told this part before.”

“Yeah, well, he hasn’t heard it yet.” Noah’s voice lowered. “Something dropped into the funnel. Right on top of us. It was big.”

The booth went quiet.

“The 'official' story,” Noah said, “was an F5 tore through a small town in the midwest and vanished. Truth was something massive stomped its way through my town.” 

He tried to sound casual, but his hands were trembling. “I was the only one who made it out of the car. The town was flattened. I didn't have anywhere left to go.”

I leaned back, processing.

“ANCR found you,” I said.

“Eventually, after fixing the Veil.” He replied. “Turns out anomalies have a signature. They need people who are good with tech to keep track of things. So now I'm working the early alert system of a different storm.”

Chris lifted his glass again. “Guess that makes us the lucky ones.”

I clinked mine against it.

“Lucky,” I repeated, not entirely convinced.

But sitting there, wings gone, drinks thinning down, the noise of the pub carrying on around us, I realized something had shifted.

I wasn’t just a tag-along. I was part of the crew. We were a part of something else. The links in the chain of an anchor nobody knew was keeping things steady. Just what kind of storm we were holding against I hadn't decided yet.

The guy's testimony told me something though. This has been going on longer than I knew, and more widespread. My little city in the woods was no exception to strangeness. Just another place where the cracks opened up, drawing in the ANCR.

I wondered just how big this operation really was. Small detachments like us couldn't be the only ones out there if there were things that could wipe whole towns off the map. For now though, my mind was settled in that I now have a new job, with a new perspective from the other side of the coin. My bank account has been padded, thanks to Sam. And I've got myself what appears to be a capable team, a merry band of misfits if I've ever seen one 

Maybe this isn't all for nothing. Maybe we really can close up the Veil here and keep more unfortunate souls from slipping through the cracks. Going from recovery to prevention is a nice change of pace from spinning my wheels on dead ends. Who knows, maybe I'll take Sam's advice too. For the first time in a while now, things are starting to look a bit brighter in this bleak little city.
