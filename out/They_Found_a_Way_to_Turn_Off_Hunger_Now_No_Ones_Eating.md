I was there the day we found the switch.

The moment humanity doomed itself.

We didn’t know that at the time, of course. Back then it felt like triumph, like we had cracked open the lockbox of evolution and found a cheat code. We were supposed to be saving the world.

The project was funded as a hunger initiative. My team had been mapping neural clusters in the hypothalamus, tiny circuits evolution carved into us to regulate the most basic drives: thirst, sex, sleep, hunger. It was never about obesity, never about dieting. It was about famine. Ending it forever.

The first breakthrough was so small it felt like nothing. A weak electrical current delivered into the lateral hypothalamic area, and the subject’s hunger stopped. Just, gone. He described it as if someone had reached inside and switched off a faucet. *"Like flipping a light switch,"* he said.

It was beautiful. Clean. No cravings, no gnawing stomach, no obsessive thoughts about food. Just peace.

We were giddy. We thought we’d just solved starvation. No more hollow-bellied children. No more famine zones. No more billions spent on food aid. Hunger itself, conquered.

The papers called it the last diet you’ll ever need. Charities called it the cure for poverty. Politicians called it the end of famine.

I called it a miracle.

The first months were promising. Volunteers reported unprecedented self-control. No binges. No cravings. No midnight raids on the fridge. Cafeterias got quieter. Supermarkets reported less waste. Everyone congratulated us.

But then we noticed something strange.

They weren’t eating enough.

We thought it was just enthusiasm, patients excited about their new freedom. But weeks went by, and the weight loss didn’t stop. Some dropped twenty, thirty pounds. And when we urged them to eat, they only smiled, embarrassed.

*"I just forget,"* one said. *"Food feels… pointless now."*

At first, it seemed harmless. So they ate less, wasn’t that the point?

But then came the hospitalizations.

By month two, several volunteers were admitted with malnutrition. Skin loose, hair thinning, lips cracked and dry. They should have been miserable. But they weren’t.

They smiled through chapped lips. They told us they felt fine. That they were grateful. That they had finally escaped the prison of hunger.

That was when we realized something horrifying.

It wasn’t a switch. It was a fuse.

Once we shut hunger off, it never came back.

We tried reversing the stimulation. Tried higher voltages, lower voltages. Hormone injections. Ghrelin drips. Even electrical shocks. Nothing reignited the drive.

The hunger circuitry wasn’t dormant. It was burned out.

We hadn’t silenced hunger. We had destroyed it.

By month three, half the group was wasting away. Some were kept alive on feeding tubes, but many pulled them out in the night. Not violently, not in protest. Calmly, smiling, like children removing an itchy bandage.

One man whispered to me as he faded, *"It’s better this way. So quiet inside."*

Hospitals filled with patients who refused to eat. Not because of trauma or fear. But because they didn’t care. Nurses begged, families pleaded. Food was left on trays to rot.

And the strangest thing? The patients looked serene. Rows of skeletal bodies humming softly, eyes half-closed, lips curved into faint smiles. Like monks in some final meditation.

We tried to contain the technology. We failed.

It was too simple, too cheap. A few electrodes, a battery, a wire. Bootleg clinics popped up everywhere. In back alleys, in strip malls, in rural villages. People paid cash to get the switch flipped.

They walked out smiling. And then, slowly, they stopped eating.

Governments knew. Of course they knew. And they didn’t stop it. Why would they? A world without hunger meant no riots over food shortages. No bloated aid budgets. No revolutions sparked by famine.

They called it progress. They called it choice.

But they were killing us. Quietly.

The world is different now.

Restaurants close one by one. Grocery stores shutter. Farms go untended. I walk past markets where vendors used to shout over each other, and now only the flies buzz over unsold produce.

Playgrounds are empty. Children’s faces are hollow, eyes ringed in purple. Parents did it to them, thinking it was mercy. They couldn’t afford food, and the switch made the need vanish.

Cities are quieter. Streets once filled with food stalls now reek of rot. People drift like shadows, bones jutting through thin clothes, smiling faintly as they waste away.

It’s not famine. Famine is desperate, violent, loud. This is worse. This is famine without fear. A starvation so peaceful, no one fights it.

I still eat. Or at least, I try.

But sometimes I sit in front of a plate for hours and realize I never took a bite. Sometimes I forget entire days of meals.

I tell myself I’m fine because I still feel my stomach growl. But the more I think about it, the less sure I am.

What if that’s not hunger? What if it’s just a memory of hunger? What if the fuse burned out in me, too, and I just haven’t noticed yet?

My hands look thinner than yesterday. Or maybe that’s my imagination. I can’t remember the last time I ate a full meal.

And the worst part?

I don’t want to.
