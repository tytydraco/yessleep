I want to warn that there are descriptions of animals dying in this. I am a 23-year-old living in the Midwest with my wife. I started dating my wife a couple of years ago and that’s where my mother's spiral began. She had always been kind of unhinged. My father died when I was 18 it was quick. Brain cancer, the kind that once it’s discovered it's too late. Even as my father turned into a ghost of himself, I never saw my mother cry. She would sit by his side knitting and talking about the inanest things. I swear most of the conversations she had with my dying father were about the masked singer. He died while I was there, but my mother was at the farmer’s market. He held my hand as he left and I waited until after his eyes closed to let the grief leak from my eyes. She showed up about 20 minutes after with a tote bag carrying assorted vegetables.

“I think I am going to make a casserole tonight what do you think.” She set her bag down on the hospital chair, pulled out her phone, and started dialing. “Yeah, I am going to be late tonight to bridge.” Her voice sounded even but I swore I caught a hint of glee. I heard her friend swearing on the other side, but I couldn’t make out her words. “No, yeah Jim died, yeah, yeah, thank you please let Kelsey know she needs to bring more food and not any of her experiments either afterward I got food poisoning for a month.” She chuckled as she said it and I am sure the same hallow laughter was echoed from her friend on the phone. “So, what do you think tuna casserole?” Those words stuck in my head and sometimes I still wake up in a cold sweat with the taste of tuna casserole suffocating me.

I decided to put off college to stay home with my mom. Her joy was obvious, and she made no attempt to act like the grieving widow, just a mother overjoyed at more time with her child. Those months went by in kind of a blur. The only thing that sticks out is the one night I stumbled onto my mother’s bridge group.

My mother was hosting, and she made it clear that she wanted me out of the house. I had left to hang out with some friends and planned to stay over with one of them. (This friend would later turn out to be my partner but that’s a longer happier story that doesn’t belong next to the gloom of my mother. Me and my friends first went out to eat and then planned to go out to a local bar that treated fake ID’s like the norm. I had been drinking there since I was 15 years old. While at Dinner I realized that I had forgotten my wallet and after my friend awkwardly paid for me I had them bring me home to retrieve it. Sarah and Thomas waited inside as I headed towards the door.

I turned my key as quietly as I could and was in the process of going to my room when I smelled smoke. My first instinct was to yell but something held me back. I slowly inched towards the living room. My eyes saw the source of the smoke. On the center of my coffee table sat a little Bunsen burner illuminating the otherwise shadowy room with its blue hue. My mother and most of the other members of her “Bridge” Club were gathered hand in hand in a circle around the tiny flame. Kelsey the woman known for her grave kitchen mistakes held what looked like a little cutlet from an unknown animal. Her varicose finger clutched the fatty meat firmly as she held it over the burner. Now I know what you're thinking, and my mind made the same leap. This is some fucking cult thing, isn’t it? I thought the same, but it was so hard to put the reality next to these middle-aged women not dressed in dark cloaks but in enough khaki and plaid to outfit the entire PTO.

Almost in response to my mental jab, Kelsey's eyes met mine peering from around the corner. “Hey there are you hungry?” Her tone was pleasant, but her eyes were venomous and I left quickly knocking over a fruit bowl as I fled. I made a halfhearted attempt to pick up some pomegranates from the ground but decided an explanation later was better than more time in that house.

I skipped the bar and slept over at my friend's house that night. In the morning, I expected to return to lamb’s blood splattering the photos in the hallway. Instead, I was greeted by the smell of bacon and my mother’s convincing smile.

“Hey honey,” her eyes were honey and she pulled out a chair for me. “I hope you’re hungry.” She heaved a large helping of bacon on my plate nestled between some scrambled eggs and toast.”

“Uh sure,” I gave a halfhearted response and sat down. My stomach felt unsettled, but I decided eating was preferable to talking and started to dig in.

“Did you have a good time with your friends last night?” She said sitting too close to me for comfort. “I am sure that Clancy’s missed your patronage last night.” Her mouth was turned up at the corners as she pulled my fake ID from her wallet and placed it on the table next to me.

“Oh yeah, we decided to stay in instead,” I said in between mouthfuls hoping my chewing masked my discomfort.

“Well, if I had known I would’ve invited Sarah and Thomas inside you know how us girls love to see how the young people are doing.” I didn’t think about this until later but I don’t know how she knew who brought me home. I had been out with a lot of friends any of which could’ve brought me back and I made Thomas burn rubber as soon as I had gotten to the car.

“Yeah, it looked like you guys were busy I decided not to bother you.”

“Oh yeah, Kelsey got it in her head to try hibachi or Korean barbecue or some shit.” She lifted my empty plate from the table and started washing it. “I swear I envy your father taking the quick way out Kelsey's cooking is killing me slowly.” She hadn’t really mentioned my father since his death and the nonchalant way she talked about it felt inappropriate. I know, however, that people grieve in all sorts of ways.

We never talked about the event again and like most things with my mother, it was just another thing that went unsaid. As time went on I started staying away longer and spending more time with my now wife Sarah. My mom made her displeasure known in her usual onslaught of passive aggression.

“I wish you could’ve tried this casserole fresh.” She’d say after a night away.

“I watched Conan last night it’s not as funny without you there.”  She always had humor in her voice but left just enough room between words and sentences to make me feel like shit. Eventually, my mother asked me to bring over my “little lady” Sarah took no convincing in fact she basically convinced me.

“I know things with your mom are weird but it’s better to deal with this shit believe me I know.” And I knew that she did know. Sarah’s parents had no contact with her when she began her transition a year ago. She had so much anger for them but I still saw the sadness in her eyes when the anger faded.

We went over on a Friday night for what my mother assured me would be a meal to remember. As we sat down my mother's eye’s lingered on Sarah.

“Can I take your friend's coat?” She asked refusing to acknowledge my relationship. She also made the intentional effort to mess up her pronoun’s every third sentence.

“How did you meet him?” She asked always busying herself when she let her bitchiness show. Unable to face the angry look in my eyes. I corrected her every time but Sarah would clutch my hand every time to assure me. When she could see I had enough she quietly whispered in my ear.

“She is making an effort it’s ok I can handle myself.” I nodded quietly and my mother paused and looked deeply at Sarah.


“Nothing,” Sarah replied, “You know my family actually used to go to the same church as you.” Sarah’s voice was beautiful and made my breath catch in my throat every tim.

“What the fuck did you just say to my son.” Her words were bombs hurled at us from across the oak dining table.

“Mom,” I said attempting to cut her off but she already had too much steam.

“We don’t tell secrets in this house so either tell me or get the fuck out.” Sarah was calm having endured far worse from her parents I’m sure.

“It wasn’t a secre…”

“GET OUT!” My mother cut her off and slammed her fists on the table narrowly avoiding the mashed potatoes. I stood up ready to yell or fight but Sarah took my arm and said loudly enough for my mother to hear this time.

“It seems you guys have some stuff to talk about I’ll wait in the car.” She went to grab her coat.

“No,” I said calmly “Mom Sarah is a part of my life now and she can either be a part of yours too or my whole life can be separate.” The words hung in the air like Damocles's sword. My mother still had fury in her eyes but seemed on the verge of tears.

“I made you!” My mom replied. “I sacrificed my life for you. My parents fucking beat me, and you act like this where do you get the fucking nerve you selfish brat.” A favorite tactic of my mother. Bringing up her trauma to erase mine. It normally worked too I am ashamed to say. This time I settled into a weird sense of resolve either because of Sarah’s presence or finally having enough.

“Mom I am going to leave now with Sarah and if you decide you want to talk tomorrow let me know.” I grabbed Sarah’s hand and started walking towards the door. My mom was glued to her spot but yelled after me.

“Sure leave everybody fucking leaves me just like your fucking father.” Hearing that made me turn for a second and made me feel actual pity. Maybe my mom was worse off than she let on. This time Sarah did leave letting her hand fall from mine but smiling on the way out. I heard the car door close before I chose to talk.

“Mom if you want to talk about dad I know his death was a shock and it hit me really hard you know how much I loved him.” My vision became cloudy with tears as I inched closer towards my mother. Her expression turned stone faced.

“He left me months before his fucking brain exploded.” Sharp and cold like ice her words left impacts in my skin. “He fucking cheated on me with that skank Suzanne. This man you loved got what was coming to him and so did that fucking bitch.” I couldn’t believe what she was saying. Suzanne was my father’s old secretary who had died in a car accident not long after my father. Too blank to process that additional grief at the time but Suzanne had always been nice to me.

“Even so he… they didn’t deserve to die Mom.”

“Apparently,” Her eyes met mine. “They did.” I left right after that. Feeling hollow and dark inside. Longing for the fragile peace from before that conversation. No matter how much I hated my mother I still did feel bad for her. Her texts the following day went from sweet to violent in a steady back and forth.

“Honey I am sorry about last night please come over to talk.” Sent at 7:00 A.M.

“You know that fucking bitch had it coming.” Sent at 7:12 A.M.

“I am sorry honey I will even talk to her if you want.” Sent at 7:15 A.M. The last message I read before blocking her was sent at 10:00 A.M. that morning.

“You can’t outrun a mother’s love.” Blocking her filled me with guilt but I couldn’t face it. I was honestly worried she would find the right thing to bring me back. Sarah comforted me through the whole thing, all too familiar with the territory.

I never went back for things. I moved in with Sarah switched to my own insurance and got a delivery job that paid well. Sarah got a great job, and we were able to move to a better place a couple of hours away from my mom. I didn’t block my mom on Facebook and she quickly took to messaging me. I didn’t respond or even look but I would occasionally browse her page and saw how she had started posting transphobic memes almost immediately after our fallout. My mom who never held a single political opinion before at least I never saw her express it. Now seemed to spend a large part of her day as a troll. The echo chamber in her comments was all too enthusiastic to support her ignorance. I noticed every comment had her entire bridge club hyping her up.

“So, fucking true you are mother.” Kelsey would always comment some variation of this that my mother would like. When I posted my engagement photos my mother commented mere seconds after.

“Gods will burn that sinner don’t let her come with you.” My heart felt heavy replacing joy with sadness as I deleted the comment and blocked her from everything I could think of.

My wedding day was beautiful, even the absence of my mother couldn’t stop me and Sarah from having the times of our life. We were surrounded by the family we chose the one that also chose us regardless of anything. The only sour note on the day was the doves.

Secretly I had organized for doves to be released after the ceremony. I planned the whole thing as a surprise for her. As we met for a kiss I heard an attendant open the box behind us. I looked to the sky but saw no doves. I glanced backward at the box. All of the white doves lay in the box their feathers-stained crimson their wings and legs stretched in unnatural positions. The attendant flashed me a shrug and looked on the verge of being sick. I motioned for him to cover the box and I never told Sarah about the surprise. When I inquired with the company, I got vague answers and a refund that left me mostly satisfied if not disturbed.

Married life was amazing. We had already lived together so long that the piece of paper only solidified what me and Sarah already had. Now to the present and I apologize for the long preamble. I am pretty sure my mother cursed me. The first night that led me to this was when I woke up to the familiar taste of tuna casserole. I sprang up from a bad dream I didn’t remember. Sarah slept like the dead as I crept out of bed to go to the bathroom. I pissed and splashed some water on my face. When I looked in the mirror, I noticed the way the shadows behind me seemed to stretch and move even with the steadiness of the light source. Cool water dripped down my face as I saw one shadow seemingly creeping over to my wife. No not creeping and not exactly moving. It was just a concentration of darkness that was barely perceptible against the blackness of the room.

I couldn’t move I was frozen to the spot my throat trying to yell out felt like hot lead had been poured into it. The shadow stretched out a limb or whatever it was towards me and Sarah’s wedding photo on her bedside table. Dark fingers swirling around the frame seeming to intensify it’s ink fighting against the bathroom light and the full moon hanging in the window. A crashing sound at the window woke up Sarah and caused me to jump. I looked and then ran to the window and as I did the shadow evaporated.

“What the fuck was that?” Sarah said, turning on the lamp by her side. I was standing in front of the window now peering into the night. The brightness of the moon made my backyard look like a perfectly lit stage ready for some great tragedy to unfold. My eyes scanned the ground and quickly found the source of the noise.

“Some bird flew into the window and broke its neck.” My stomach lulled as I saw the strange bird with perfect clarity. The way it lay reminded me of the doves from my wedding. This time it was grey feathers that obscured the blood and grotesque limbs.

“Oh no, I’ll deal with it tomorrow babe.” Sarah’s words were comforting especially since she knew my problem with blood and death. “Come back to bed.” I did as she flicked the light back off. She laid her head on my chest so she could feel the hammering of my heart as it retreated to a normal rhythm. I was nowhere near sleep but teetering on contentment when I looked back at her bedside table. The picture was gone from its usual spot. I slid out from underneath Sarah and looked at the floor beside her. It was lying there, the glass of the frame shattered. Only over the face of my wife.

The next morning, I left early for work attempting to rationalize what I saw. Every time I watch a horror movie, I laugh at the stupidity of the main character wondering how they are able to pretend like everything is ok. They go back into the house they enter the basement. But the brain is great at tricking itself and it’s easier to doubt yourself than try to expand the world you live in.

I had transferred to another delivery branch when I and Sarah had moved. I went all over the state managing to avoid ever getting too close to home. The nearest I got was a town about 45 minutes away. It was small and mostly farmland known as a drive-through town. I had a podcast playing using their words to drown out my internal monologue.

I turned the corner around a familiar bend letting myself drift into road blindness. My eyes were on the road but my lack of sleep from the night before gave me enough of a blind spot that I almost missed it. A fucking cow was standing directly in front of me. A large spotted cow was all the detail I saw before my instincts caused me to swerve to the other side of the road.

As soon as I avoided the bovine obstacle, I was staring down the headlights of an 18-wheeler about ten feet in front of me. The truck’s horn sounded so loud it shook me to my core. I swerved into the side of the road barely keeping my vehicle upright as my tires switched from asphalt to dirt. The truck continued to sound its horn but left me in a cloud of dust and sweat. I sat there for a minute that felt like an eternity before my heart started to settle. My podcast continued to blather the laughter coming from it mocked me.

I exited my vehicle ready to tell off a farmer for their carelessness when I noticed where I was. The fields I had been traveling through were replaced by the welcome sign to my hometown. Not far from my childhood home that housed my past and her. I looked around for the cow that had tried to kill me but there was nothing only trees on either side breaking about a mile ahead for the houses and businesses of home.

The rest of the day passed without any event as I went back to my regular route. I am writing this at home waiting for my wife to arrive and give me some semblance of peace. These events separated from each other might not stab at me like this but together so close I can’t shake this feeling and my whole fucking house smells like tuna casserole.
