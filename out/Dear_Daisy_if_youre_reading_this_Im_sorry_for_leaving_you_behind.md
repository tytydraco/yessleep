Dear Daisy, Im sorry for leaving you behind

Five years ago I was in a really bad place. 
No home. No friends, going through a breakup. Parents that hated me. I felt alone.
So I decided to kill myself 

Afters days of thinking and thinking I decided to go to a small forest on my area. I used to play there a lot when I was a kid. I evend gave my first kiss there. It was with thos girl, Miranda, who kissed me first and then started spreading the word at school that I liked girls. 


Maybe thay was the beggining of my loneliness.
So I went to this forest with a switchblade my ex had given to me and I planned to cut my wrists near the lake, where I had sex for the first time. It was Miranda again. Don't ask.

It was mid autumm. The leaves were orange and faing down. The sun was bright but not hot.
It was a really nice afternoon.
I parked my car near the road, just next to the woods and I begin to walk, playing with the little knife with my hands. 


I would love to say that the moment I stepped on those woods I felt something off. That there was something wrong, anything. But truth is I was so caught up in my own feelings to notice anything.
I didn't even realize I was being followed until a few hours later.


It was maybe 3:00 pm when I first heard her. Soft steps, shy steps. 
I let her follow me, I didn't really cared what happened to me. I was there to end my life after all, wans't I?
So I kept walking till she finally revealed to me.
Her name was Daisy and she was a fragile looking girl with long brown hair, glasses and deep brown eyes. Nothing outstanding about her. She ways 20, maybe 21. Couldn't be older than that.


She was carryung a big sleeping bag and she told me she was lost and was following me to find the way back to the main road.
I could instantly tell she was lying. She was scared. But more than that she was really sad. I knew she was there for the same reason than me. 
I let her follow me  but I tried to have some distance. 
She didn't take the hint.

Daisy liked to talk. And to talk a lot. In less than an hour I find out she lived with both her parents, that she had a cat named Dog (she found this really funny for a reason) and that she was an acuarious.

I didn't tell her much about me besides my name.
It was getting late so we decide to camp. Daisy offered me to sleep with her and I acepted.
A few minutes later after we fell asleep I  began to hear the noise.
It was like static. A horrible, irritaiting static.
I woke up and I found Daisy crying. 

I didn't ask her what was going on. Instead I ask her if she wanted to acompany me to the lake the next day. She wiped her tears and said "sure". Then she smiled a gorgeous smile.


The next day we found a Man. He was sitting on the floor, his eyes closed and a smile on her face. We planned to avoid him, bit he opened his eyes before we could.
He looked at us and said "Do you hear it? Such a beautiful voice" 

I could tell by Daisy face that she was about to approach him to check if he was fine. I grab her by the wrist and just shook my head, saying no.
We continue our walk.

After and hour I realized that something wasn't okay. At this point we should have aleready reached the lake. But we were still between the trees.

Daisy was gettin worried and kept asking me where the lake was. I talked back to her, in not a so gently tone and I could se her body shaking and her eyes getting watery. I let out a sigh and apologize to her.
Then we saw the Woman. And I swear she wasn't there a minute ago.

One moment there was only Daisy and me on the woods and the next there was a full ass woman sitting a few meters to us.
She smiled and said "He has such a beautiful voice, doesn't he?"
I grabbed Daisy by the hand and we run the fuck away from there.
And we ran. And ran. But there was no lake, nor main road. Just the same old dirty woods.
I began to freak out at this point.
So did Daisy.
We cried our lungs out.
Then it was night again.

Im gonma spare some details; we were like this for seven days straight. No one ever came looking for us. The firts three nights we kept hearing the static. And by that third nigth I could swear that noice almost sounded like words. 

And the random people kept showing up. Always sitting on the floor. The first days they were smiling, repeating the "such a beautiful voice" crap. 

Then, the fourth day another man appeared from nowhere, but he was crying. And he said "please close the door" before dissapearing again.

That day we found three other persons two of them crying, one of them screaming. All of them saying stuff along the lines of "close the door" , "we shouldn't have opened it" and "I can't stop hearing his voice, make him shut up"

That night Daisy told me she told her parents she was gonna go camping. 
But she was gonna kill herself I already knew that, but  I acted surprised.
And I realized something, yeah, we were trapped in these woods, but we both came to kills ourselves anyway. So maybe that way we could escape.

But wathever reason we couldn't bring ourselves to do it. We decided to die on our terms. To find the lake.
We had nightmares. And in those nightmares we began to hear his voice. It was still the static, but it made sense. He was whispering horrible things to us. Letting us hear screams of the place where he came from. 

The next day, the 5th day, the wasn't random people appearing out of nowhere. There were just their dead bodies. 
Some were intact except for their empty eye sockets and little bites ( and for the love of god, if theres one, I can't figure out what caused those bites. They looked like nothing I've seen before) in ther bodies. They were naked too.
Other bodies were completly ripped apart though. Destroyed. Like if big claws had toyed with them. One of them, a kid, no older than 15, had no skin on him, except for the one on his face.

Daisy cried and nearly kills herself right there. I should have let her do it. I shouldn't have stopped her.
But I did. The body was gone agaim in a glitch and I hold this fragile broken  girl on my arms. After she calm down she told me that her ex girlfriend died because of her. A car accident. 

She felt guilty. The parents of the girl blamed her, and her own parents did their best to ignore her.
I told her about my life too. 

We sleep early that day and this time we dreamt about a big black nothing. Just and empty void, or at least it looked empty until you looked to close. We see his true form  but i dont remember it. I just rememeber waking up to Daisy hugging me tight.
The 6th day we found their home. Where this people used to lived. And we found out what happened. Kinda.

They brought this thing to our world, he killed them as fun. And now he was playin with us. Like a kid with ants. We also found that he couldn't stay here for too long. He had a day left, maybe two.

We continue to walk until we began seeing something different. A different path. New trees amd finally, the lake.
We hugged each other and she kissed me.
I kissed her back.

Were we still gonna kill ourselves? Were we gonns get out of there? Was i gonna take her out on a date? We would never know, because the moment we let hope slip through our hearts, the static began to ring again, and this time angrier and louder than ever. And it kept going all night.

She grabbed my hand and we cried. We run to the lake and try to scape the sound coverinh ourselves with water. It worked.

Its time must have been running out.
I looked at Daisy buy she was beyond sad. His voice had really messed her up. So she told me that we should go as planned, to kill ourselves as the voice told her there was nothing for her out there.
I agree.

We came out of the water and got ready to face him and die on our terms, but something was different. The voice had told me things too. He show me visions of a better life. Off happiness. 


I realize now that he was lying. He just wanted me to let Daisy alone, so she would be all sad and in dispair for him.
And I did just that. 


As Diasy began cutting her wrist I got up and I ran. I stopped for a moment and for a second, just a second I saw her face. It was the look of pure loneliness.
Of someone who has just felt love and hope , someone who was ready to die at peace but was treasoned in the last moment.
I saw that look on her eyes just before she dissapeared in a glitch like the other.


I runned and eventually found my car. 
In the world outside the woods just a day had gone by.

No one came looking for me or asked where I was.
But everyone was worried about Daisy.
Despite everything, her parents looked for her, her friends too.

Eventually they gave her for dead.
I went to her house once. Acting like an old friend. I met her cat. He was cute.

I was still alone. And with nightmares.
At first of being trapped in the forest again.
Them about the god, and I have no doubts that this is what he is. A god.

And I've been dreaming with her. Daisy in the void, her beautiful long hair floating in the emptiness. Her deep brown eyes being eaten away by some insects from another place.
 Her soul being tortured by an infant god who only wished pain and suffering.
So I'm coming back. Back to her, to go through my initial suicide plan. I know she's angry. The static tells me she's angry in my dreams.
I deserve her hate.
So Im gonna take her place. Or try at least.
Im gonna do the exact same rite those guys at thw wood did and I'm gonna talk to the god in the beyond. 
And she's gonna come back and realize she was worth it. That people missed her. Dog misses her. She's gonna read this and realize I'm really sorry for what happened.
And I'm not gonna be alone anymore.
I will have thousands of little creatures living in me.
So that't the end
Dear Daisy, if you're reading this, I'm sorry for leaving you behind.
