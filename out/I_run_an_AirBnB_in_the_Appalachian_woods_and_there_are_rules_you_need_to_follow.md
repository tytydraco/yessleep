I inherited my grandfather’s cabin after he passed away. I would never sell it, because quite frankly, I don’t want to be haunted by his angry ghost. I live in Pittsburgh and I’ve never really been much of a great outdoors kind of person. I spent a few weekends of my childhood at my grandfather’s cabin, because my dad always said it’s good to get out of a city and get a change of scenery. 

I always figured it was just an excuse for my dad to be able to grab a few beers and relive the days of his reckless youth with his buddies because he was always hungover when we came home.

We always had a good time visiting grandpa as kids. There’s plenty to keep you occupied, but if I’m honest, the place always scared me a little. My granddad used to tell my brother and I these stories growing up, and I always figured they were just tall tales and ghost stories used to keep us from wandering at night. 

I know better now.  

Don’t get me wrong, it’s a cozy cabin and makes for an excellent weekend away. Grandpa took a lot of pride in making it as homey as possible and I’ve done my best to uphold that. It wasn’t perfect, by any means and since his passing, there’s been a few adjustments. There’s no longer any mold in the bathroom, and the gutters have been cleaned for the first time in about a decade. The shower’s decent and we even installed one of those fancy wooden hot tubs outback, because I hear people like those. 

There’s a fireplace in the living room and a few fluffy rugs. We removed the deer hides that used to cover the floors, because my wife thought it might come off as a little too macabre for the more sensitive soul and I guess she’s right. 

There’s even a fire pit outside for toasting marshmallows, making smores and what have you. 

I’ll be honest, I didn’t think we’d get any interest when we first put up on AirBnB because it’s pretty remote. Pittsburgh is the nearest city but it’s about 4 hour drive and then a bit of an offroad adventure into the woods. The place ain’t exactly located on any maps, but the local ranger station does know about us. 

We only got access to the cellphone hotspot a few weeks ago, because we figured people would want to stay connected even though that kinda defeats the point of a getaway. 

Now this ain’t no 5 star hotel. It’s comfortable, but it’s also practical. There’s a sofa bed in the living room and then two single beds in the bedroom. The kitchen is small, but practical and will have everything you need. Although the gas stove can be a little temperamental at times. 

Okay, I think those are the practical bits out of the way.

Remember those stories my grandpa would tell us? The ones that I used to think weren’t real? I’m afraid I have some bad news -  they’re real. I learned that the hard way when we began the refurbishment before turning into an AirBnB. 

I wish I was kidding, but I’m not and I need you to listen very carefully. Your life depends on it. 

If by the end of this, you still don’t believe me, well don’t say I didn’t warn you and don’t come asking me for a refund.  

1. **Announce yourself when you arrive**

This was something grandpa always did that I used to think was a bit weird, but now it makes sense. Before you unlock the door, put your bags down and turn around so that you are facing the woods. Then, without screaming, but loud enough so that your voice carries, say these words. 

*“My name is (your full name) and I’m staying here until (the exact date you plan on checking out). I mean you no harm and I ask that you leave me alone.”* 

Honestly, I can’t guarantee that this works, but manners maketh man and whatnot. 

1. **If you hear a baby - no you didn’t**

This is Appalachia 101. There will be times when you are outside, maybe chilling in that nice hot tub and you’ll hear what sounds like a bob cat. You’ll probably think “it’s probably just a bobcat”, but I need you to really listen to me here. 

It isn’t a bobcat. 

Nor is it a baby .

Whatever you do, don’t try to find the source of the sound. Just ignore it and it \*might\* ignore you. 

1. **Always keep the porchlight on**

Just as you walk inside, there’s a little lightswitch on the left side of the door. You wanna flick it to turn on the front porch upon arrival. No, it doesn’t matter if it’s still broad daylight, the light always has to be left on. 

I once had a guest tell me they kept the light off to preserve energy. All through the night they heard footsteps on the porch and knocking on the door. It wasn’t until they turned the porchlight back on that it stopped. 

1. **Pull the curtains at night**

I mean, this one is really just a bit of friendly advice, but I definitely wouldn’t want to turn around in the middle of the night to a face staring at me. 

1. **If you hear whistling, don’t whistle back.**

When I was around 10 years old and was out here for a weekend. Grandpa was out sorting firewood and I was left to my own devices. I decided to go exploring and as kids do, wandered off. At one point, I heard whistling that I thought sounded exactly like the way grandpa whistles and so I replied with the same whistling, because it was a game we used to play. 

I found grandpa chopping wood and when I told him about the whistling, his face turned pale. He scolded me for doing something so reckless and I was confused. I thought he’d been the one whistling. He picked me up and we ran inside. He locked the doors and shut the windows. We heard the whistling outside the cabin as if someone was circling around it and for weeks, I heard it in my dreams. 

1. **Whatever the old man says, he isn’t Mr Miller**

We don’t have many neighbors out here, but I always remembered Mr Miller. His cabin is technically the one closest to Grandpas. He used to have this sweet old Nova Scotia Retriever called Dewey he used to let us borrow. Dewey was the same age in dog years to Mr Miller’s human age, but with a puppyish soul. He was born with a bit of a limp, but that didn’t stop him from chasing chipmunks to his heart’s content. 

I’ll never forget the time Mr Miller knocked on the front door, barely able to hold it together, asking Grandpa if he’d seen Dewey and that he’d run off chasing something in the woods, but never came back. 

Grandpa and Mr Miller searched for Dewey for three days without a trace. On the fourth day, Mr Miller said he found Dewey’s body ripped apart at the back of his cabin, as if something had done that to him. 

Two days later, grandpa went to check on Mr Miller and found him in his rocking chair, shotgun in one hand a hole through his head. 

So when you open the door to an old man who looks and sounds like Mr Miller, with a dog that looks just like Dewey, asking if he can just have a glass of water or use the bathroom before he’s on his merry way, I am telling you - it ain’t Mr Miller.

And it sure as hell ain’t Dewey. 

1. **If the radio starts playing blues music, hide.**

There’s an old fashioned radio in the kitchen. It has access to a couple of stations nearby, we usually think it’s a good idea to listen to for the sake of an accurate weather forecast, because it gets unpredictable out here. 

If the radio starts playing music, especially that one really old song “me and the devil was walking side by side”, by what’s his name ...Robert Johnson! Yeah that one. If you hear that song coming out the radio, you need to hide as if your whole entire life depends on it (because it does) and don’t even try to look even if somebody’s walking around the cabin. I’ve never gotten a look at him myself, but according to the wife of one of our guests, her husband still has nightmares. 

1. **Ignore the woman crying by the stream**

 Don’t stop. Don’t ask her if she’s okay. Don’t offer to help. Don’t look her in the eyes. Don’t talk to her. Just walk on by. She’ll be gone by the time you are on your way back to the cabin. I don’t know exactly what she is, but my dad says it might be a remnant of some kind of Swedish forest nymph. I read up about it some time ago, but apparently according to legend, they seduce men into sleeping with them. 

There weren’t a huge number of Scandinavian settlers in Appalachia, but some of them found their way here. They worked with logging and lumber and probably brought some of their stories with them from Scandinavia. 

1. **Leave a tiny shot of whisky on the bottom step every night**

We keep a bottle of Gleglassaugh Single Malt in the liquor cabinet. That’s the really good stuff, bought directly from a distillery in Scotland. It is specifically for being left out. If you forget or if you decide not to, don’t come crying to me Argentina when you find out that all your socks have been cut into a million pieces and there’s mice shit in your suitcases. 

It gets angry.  
I warned ya. 

1. **When you leave, be sure to announce your departure**

Just like when you check in, this one is more for your own safety. Lock the door. Put away the key, turn around facing the woods and say *“Thank you for having me, please stay here and don’t follow me back”.* 

9/10 times, it works. 

Right. I think that’s it. Well at least the most important ones that’ll probably keep you alive throughout your stay. I have a tonne of stories growing up here, but I need to get some shut eye. Let me know if you want to hear them.

Ah shit, I forgot to warn you about the cult. Oh well, they’re mostly harmless.
