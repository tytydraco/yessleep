My name is Bethany Barker, and I'm a semiprofessional assassin. 

I say semiprofessional because my skill set is extremely small, and I can only kill men. 

Let me explain. 

The way I kill my targets is a little non traditional and maybe a little scandalous. You see, I was born with what some may call a curse, but I have come to see it as a blessing.

Pretty much, anyone I sleep with dies. Your heard that right. Talk about fatal attraction. 

I first realized this special skill of mine on the night of my senior prom. Reggie and I had been dating for about 6 months and I was an excited 18 year old girl, ready to live out my first time fantasies. The night had been great. Reggie picked me up and took me to Texas Roadhouse (the epitome of romance to my 18 year old, virgin self). We danced the night away and at the end of the night we went to his car. We did the deed (a little disappointing I might add). That's when everything went wrong. 

Reggie began to convulse, and before I knew it, he was dead.

Oops. But honestly, how was I to know? 

I still didn't know that I was the one who caused Reggie's demise. The doctors simply said his heart had stopped. 

It took a few more dead boyfriends before I realized that I was in fact the cause of all of their untimely deaths. 

So just like that I was 21 years old and now I knew I would never be able to have an intimate relationship again. After a little break down I came up with a scheme. What if I could use this curse for good? I had the power to kill anyone I could seduce. 

That's when my career began. Some may call it slutty, but I think it's empowering. 

I began searching for targets. It's appalling how easy it was to find sickos. I would search the dark web and find pedophile sites. These are still my favorite victims. I would lure them into meeting with me by threatening to expose their sick secrets. When they would meet up with me I would tell them that all they had to do was sleep with me and they would never hear from me again. 

Now, maybe this is a little sick, but can you blame me? These people were hurting children. 

They assumed I just had a weird kink and would go along with it. Within 20 minutes these predators would be dead. It was a satisfaction that I can't describe. I was like a seductress version of Robin Hood. 

It has now been 3 years and I am still at it. I have taken down all sorts of bad men, and I will continue to do so. I hope you all don't judge me. I promise I only use my skills for good and only ever kill bad men. 

Goodbye for now, I will try to keep you updated with all of my future endeavors. and if you're a creeper, remember to be careful who you sleep with. Toodles!
