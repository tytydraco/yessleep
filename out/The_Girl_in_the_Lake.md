I was fourteen when I went to camp. It was a simple getaway off in the woods, north of where I lived. It was quiet up there. There’s a certain kind of calm you get when you’re just deep enough into the wilderness. It can be so isolating. You feel like you’re in the middle of nowhere and the rest of the world is a whole planet away, even if it’s only a quick fifteen minute drive back to civilization. My guess as to why we were there was to learn about nature, pick up some camping skills, and not trouble our parents for a while. For me, it was a chance to meet some new friends.

For a bit of background, growing up I was a kid with a fair share of problems. I was always a tad socially inept, and I lacked that kind of confidence every child should have. I didn’t have many friends, and I spent most of my time in my room on the computer, or reading books. Maybe that’s why my parents sent me off to summer camp. Things weren’t always the best at home. I cried back then. I cried a lot, even at little things. Things that scared me, things that upset me. I was always unpopular amongst my peers. Not hated nor bullied by any means, but more so, ignored. That’s who I was. At camp though, it was a fresh start, and no one knew me before I arrived. Perhaps that’s why I was able to make two good friends. Their names were Jack and Amy.

I met Jack first. He was my age, in fact we were born in the same month of the same year, but we couldn’t have been more different. Jack was on the short side and had a wiry build. He wore the standard issue neon shorts and t-shirt, and always had a couple mystery bruises on him. He had a wide smile that never seemed to fade and was always ready to take on the nearest challenge. He was a good kid.

Amy was more reserved in comparison. It was Jack who introduced her to me. They were childhood friends and came here together. I don’t remember exactly what she looked like, but I remember how I felt when I saw her. I had a crush on Amy. I couldn’t even tell you why. I thought she was pretty and she was nice to me. I think that’s all it took back then. She was always the type to reassure you and hear you out no matter what you might be dealing with. She was a kind person. Far too kind. They both were. Maybe that’s why they put up with me. They treated me like we had known each other our entire lives. To the others, we must have seemed inseparable.

And so, that was my life at the camp. We did a lot of things out there. Hiked up and down the trails. Went to the fire pit and shared campfire stories. Got stung when I accidentally stepped on a hornet’s nest. And then, there was the lake, only a short walk away from the campgrounds. A small lake, I’m sure, but from the shore you couldn’t see the ends of it as it curved out of view. It was a place for the kids to come and tire themselves out.

The other kids were always excited to go, but I always dreaded it a little. You see, I was a pretty overweight kid growing up. I’m still on the heavier side, but back then I didn’t even feel that comfortable taking off my shirt around others. I remember privately asking a counselor if it’d be okay if I kept my shirt on, and them telling me it’d be okay and to not worry about it. In spite of all this, I was actually a great swimmer. I think I did swimming because at my size, doing much running around just beats your body up after a while. Still, I always felt a bit out of place next to Jack. He also played a sport. I think it was soccer, or maybe track. Next to each other, we must have looked like David and Goliath. Not only was I heavier than Jack, I was a good few inches taller than him too. He’d always make jokes about how strong I must have been. I think he said that just to make me feel better.

But back to the lake. We’d go out there almost every day during camp. Late in the afternoon when it had cooled down a bit, the counselors would walk us all out there and let us play and fool around for an hour or so. We were told to not go out too far, so they could keep an eye on us, but they were pretty lax about it. The lake was always calm and there were no rushing currents nor wildlife to worry about. They must have had a good amount of trust in us. I wonder if they still let kids out on that lake now.

It was the second to last day of camp that it happened. Like so many days before we were out there on the lake, and it was me, Jack and Amy. I don’t know why I did it. No, I do. I was with Jack and Amy, and I had an idea. The day was winding down to an end. The sun was almost setting and with the orange blur of the sky overhead I turned and shot Jack a challenge.

“Why don’t we see who can swim out as far as possible underwater? We can find out who can get farther, and Amy can stay back and judge who wins.” It was a childish thing to do. It was a game I knew I would win and that Jack wouldn’t turn down. I could hold my breath for a good two minutes, and was obviously the better swimmer, but Jack didn’t care; He thought it sounded fun and probably just wanted to see how far he could go. In hindsight, I think what he really wanted was to see how far I could go. He was that kind of friend.

With that, and an enthusiastic nod from Jack, we both dove under the water, and prepared to launch ourselves off the soft silt of the lake bed. As I plunged into the world below me, I hesitated when I saw what was waiting down there. None of us swim goggles or anything of the like, and I wasn’t used to opening my eyes directly in water, so it was the first time I had actually seen the bottom of the lake.

It was vast, eerily still, and so much deeper than I ever imagined. Near the shore where we were, the lake was no more than five or six feet deep, but where the sandy floor dropped off, it appeared to be at least double in depth. Its true depth was impossible to tell because of two things. For one, a sickening green smog of algae and mud clouded the water, like a heavy morning fog. Secondly, the bottom of the lake was totally obscured by a graveyard of immense fallen trees. It was as if the forest around the lake had continued to grow right where water was, and then been knocked down by some unstoppable force. The trees were no smaller than those that were still standing. Each log was tens of feet in length like the broken wooden bones of a great dead beast.

My temporary shock was erased as I saw Jack in the corner of my eye already gliding through the water, driving himself ahead of me. I shook the feeling of uneasiness and pushed off the pillowy sand and into the open water. I knew how to swim underwater. In fact you may not know this, but if you know how, you are often much faster under the water than on the surface. I extended my arms in front of me and stacked my hands to form a streamlined arrow. Vigorously undulating my body with a steady rhythm, I propelled myself trying to keep as tight and narrow of a position as possible. As a result, my head was firmly stuck facing down, facing the lakebed, totally oblivious to my surroundings. I could only watch as the ground smoothly drifted down my vision.

I thrashed forward, eager to close the distance with Jack. However, I quickly realized how foolish I was being. This wasn’t a race. It didn’t matter who came up first, only who got farther. I slowed myself down and tried to be more careful to conserve my energy. As I did, my mind became more at ease, and I was able to begin to appreciate the sight which at first frightened me. It was so quiet down there. To my surprise, I didn’t see any movement. There wasn’t a fish, or bug, or even a weed in sight, and aside from the logs and broken twigs I couldn’t find a single sign of life. It was an almost serene kind of solitude. As my thoughts were given time to wander, I began to forget about the race, or Jack, and it was just me, alone, swimming along the bottom of a lake.

Time flies by when you’re in that state. I’m not sure if it’s the same with running or biking, but when you swim and you hear nothing except the churning of water and your own beating heart, you are only left to think. No distractions, not even anything interesting to look at most of the time. After a while of focusing on maintaining an easy, steady pace, I eventually had the thought that quite some time had passed.

I was so lost in my own world, I hadn’t realized how far from the shore I had gone. I loosened my body and let my head gently rise as I took a glance of my surroundings. I was far. The corpse of the forest I saw at a distance, I was now in the belly of. In all directions, I could only see that musty green haze and festering logs. I couldn’t even see the other kids back at shore. My initial reaction was a sense of accomplishment at the distance I had crossed. I also noticed that in orienting myself with the bottom of the lake, as it dropped down I had followed it. As a result, I was far below the surface, much deeper than any pool would allow and I had ever gone. This feat surprised even myself, but then I began to worry. I believed that I might have gone so far that Amy wouldn’t be able to see me when I did eventually surface. Then, there would be no proof that I had beaten Jack at all.

Jack. That’s right. I should try to find Jack. I looked around in all directions and only saw more of the same. I was alone. For some reason, that thought was no longer so comforting. As I glanced around, everything seemed so foreign. It was as if I had unknowingly slipped into some other world on my trip across the lake. I needed to get air soon, I thought to myself. I bet Jack had surfaced a long time ago, and that’s why I couldn’t find him. I should go back. I sank to the bottom of the lake and placed my feet against one of the logs, ready to push myself back to the air. I reminded myself to be sure to wave my hands and yell when I reached the top so Amy could find me, even if it was far away. It was then, right as I was going to tilt my head back to the world above and leave that cold, dark place, I saw her.

She was no more than a few yards away from me. I had looked all around myself only a few seconds before and yet I had somehow missed her. She looked a few years older than me and was completely naked. She had pale white skin which was tainted by the brown-green hues of the environment around her. Long jet black hair that fanned out in the water like some kind of net partially obscured her face, but I could barely make out a blank expression looking back at me with focused intent.

I froze in place. I didn’t move a single muscle. I was so surprised by the sudden presence, I could hardly react at all. At first, I almost went to shut my eyes and look away out of respect for her nude appearance, but the sheer absurdity of the situation prevented me from doing so. Next, I blinked my eyes to be sure of what I was seeing. She was still there, looking right back at me. A million questions raced through my mind, but the water that enveloped me blocked my ability to vocalize a single one of them. All I could do was sit there and gawk in utter confusion. I started to move my hands as if to communicate a thought, but I realized nothing I wanted to say could be conveyed in such a primitive manner.

That’s when she slowly drifted towards me, brushing her hair to the side, and I saw her face more clearly for the first time. That dead expression I had seen only an instant ago was gone and instead I saw an elegant girl with a curious stare looking back at me. She smiled at me and seemed to giggle with a whimsical playfulness, and then reached out her hand, beckoning me to take it. As she did, she pulled closer with an unnatural level of grace. It was as if she wasn’t swimming at all but instead floating through the water, commanding her body to move by some invisible force.

I looked her up and down, only now taking in the full extent of her beauty. I had never seen anything like her. Something about her overshadowed any incredible sight my eyes had ever had the fortune of setting themselves upon. To my young mind, it must have melted all logic or reason that remained. I must have believed that I was having one of those experiences that people at church or on TV would talk about. How god would appear before them or an angel would descend to bestow them with a wonder words cannot describe.

I hesitated still, but some part of myself I had not previously known made me reach out and take a hold of her hand. In a swift, gentle motion, she pulled me in closer. I was dragged so much closer than I had ever been to a girl my age, and she took my face and put it in her hands. Her face was now inches away from mine, and it was like she was seeing into my very soul, but the way she looked at me made all of the tension in my body leave me. As she looked at me, I saw her lips open and she spoke clearly, in a soft, soothing voice, three short words. I love you.

I was so taken by the statement, that I did not even bother to question how she was able to speak like that underwater. Tears began to uselessly well up in my eyes. That phrase was something I never heard enough. I lowered my head as she lovingly pulled me into a hug, pressing my face against her chest. I held onto her tight softly sobbing and reaching my arms around her. I struggled to process the emotions that washed over me but in that instant I learned of warmth I have not experienced since. Time seemed to come to pause as I let her take a hold of me. Then, I felt something with my hand. It was something round, rough and taut. Still enamored by the girl I was embracing, I slowly wrapped my hand around the object without thinking. It was cylindrical and covered in a film of slime, like the body of an eel. I traced my fingers around it in an attempt to find its origin. It was coming out of her back.

I opened my eyes in a stunned daze and pulled my head around her body to see what was behind her. I saw a long black stalk, like some kind of gargantuan vine, growing straight out of her and ending somewhere in the ground away from us where I could not clearly see. It was almost like the rod of some kind of bizarre, organic fishing rod. I glanced up to the face of the girl I was still holding onto, and saw a pair of cold, black hateful eyes staring back at me.

I yanked myself away without a second thought. I knew in that instant that whatever I had just given myself to was decidedly not human, and I did not wish to remain a second longer down here with it. I didn’t even look back as I began flailing every limb on my body desperately clawing my way back to return to the air I had since abandoned. Reaching the surface seemed like an eternity even though it could only have been a few seconds. I refused to look anywhere but up as I rose but I could imagine the horrid sight of some *thing* following me as I went. Its arms reaching out for me, ready to grab my ankle and yank me back to the deepest parts of the lake. My lungs burned as I finally broke the surface of the lake. I gasped and tried to cry out for help, desperate to make any audible sound as loudly as I could. In my haste, I attempted to draw in air too early and choked instead, only managing to make a feeble croak. I swiveled my head around, attempting to get my bearings. I only saw the trees of the forest and everything looked terrifyingly unfamiliar from my position. Tears and snot were streaming from my face as I began to cry, when I saw the tiny specks of other people in the distance.

I was in a state of panic, and began to frantically throw myself towards the shore. Even though it slowed me down, I kept my head lifted awkwardly, both in a continued effort to call for help and to avoid looking at whatever presence might be right below me. I couldn’t have been underwater for any longer than a minute, but it looked like I was a whole football field away from where I started. I eventually gave up on attempting to call out. It was too far for them to hear, and I could barely make a sound between my gasps for air. So, I plunged my face back down into the water to speed my retreat. As I did, I foolishly let my own curiosity take a hold of me and kept my eyes held wide open, glancing back to where she was. Right out of view, barely visible through the vile cloud of bog I saw her. Upright, floating in the water, suspended by a black cord that disappeared into complete darkness. Her face was once again cold and empty as she motionlessly watched me from below. The sight only terrified me further. I forced myself to look away and commanded every fiber in my body to focus on pulling me forward. I needed to get away and I yearned for nothing more than the sanctuary of solid ground beneath my feet.

I don’t know how long it took me to return to shore but in my memory it stretched for miles. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. I only then realized how agonizingly slow you move in water. Even at a full sprint in the water, you move hardly faster than a person casually walking at a brisk pace. The entire time my mind filled with dread knowing something impossibly faster than myself could be following below, something I would be defenseless against if it did decide to attack.

Thankfully, that never happened. As I finally did draw close enough to hear the voices of other real breathing people, I could feel my body was already giving out and I struggled to lift my arms out of the water to take each and every stroke. My muscles flared with sharp pain and I was violently gasping for air to fuel my panicked escape. When the water did become shallow enough to stand in, I dropped my legs down and slammed my feet into the loose ground and began to run. I ignored everything else as I single-mindedly thought of nothing but to escape the clutch of the lake. In one final push, I clumsily stumbled out of the water and came crashing down on the sand. It wasn’t enough and fear still kept me going. I started to crawl. I picked myself up and threw my body further and further away from that horrid lake until I finally slammed into the hard gravel, where the soft beach ended and the trail began. I couldn’t even move at this point. I had nothing left in me, and I just gasped for air as I could only listen to the deafening sound of my racing heartbeat. I felt a reach out and hand grab my shoulder and I screamed in horror, cowering ready to face death itself.

I looked up and saw one of the counselors looking at me with a look of concern. I slowly began to return to reality as tears streamed down my face. I struggled to form words but could only manage to sputter a mess of garbled syllables. The man knelt down and tried to talk to me with his questions and words of comfort falling upon deaf ears. I struggled to even breathe. Every sense I had was both dialed up to such an extreme sensitivity and yet I was unable to process anything around. When I finally did gain enough sense to speak, I could only think to blurt one stuttered phrase.

“In the lake. There’s something in the lake!” I shouted as I stumbled to my feet and pointed back to the water. Salty tears were forming rivers down my face and a blob of snot hung from one of my nostrils. I choked and sobbed trying to regain a semblance of composure as terror still held a tight grip upon me. I parted my lips again to speak again and looked to the counselor for reassurance when I was frozen by their stunned look of confusion. I glanced around and only saw more of the same. Their expressions communicated a complete lack of understanding from my statement. My brain rattled trying to form the right words to say when I realized how manic I must have looked. Who in their right mind would believe anything I had to say?

“The… the lake…” I whispered. All of the fear in me had evaporated and was being gradually filled by shame and embarrassment. I sat down and began to cry once again. I just curled up into a little ball on the ground trying to make myself smaller, in hopes that I would shrink down into nothing and disappear. I wanted to cover myself with a towel. I wanted to go back to get back to my cabin and change. I wanted to go home. I could feel the kids all watching me trying to figure out what to make of the scene. I looked up and met eyes with Amy. She had the same stupefied look of concern the rest of the kids and counselors did. She was as befuddled as everyone else. But then, I saw her face shift. Both of ours did as we had the same realization.

“Wh-Where’s Jack?” I asked.

The rest of the evening was a blur. I remember a lot of calls being made. I remember the counselors running about in a frenzy. I remember officers pulling up in their dust-covered cars. We were made to stay at the campgrounds. They asked me a lot of questions but gave up when they realized I had little to say of use. I told them about our little dare and that I didn’t see him once I started swimming. I didn’t say a word about the girl I had seen in the lake. When asked about why I came back all terrified, I just said the big open lake scared me and that was all. Our parents were called and they were going to pick us up as soon as they could.

For the rest of the evening I stayed in my bunk. The rest of the kids left me alone. They could tell something was eating me up inside, and most likely assumed I was worried about Jack. I got the occasional word of sympathy, but mostly people asked me if I was doing alright. Whenever they asked, I always said the same thing.

“I’m okay.”

I was okay. I was alive and back on dry land. I didn’t know if Jack was.

That night, I wandered out of my cabin. With all the counselors out looking for Jack, they weren’t keeping a tight watch on us. I simply got up and walked outside. I wasn’t getting any sleep anyway. I went up the hill to the bathrooms, and came to the top looking over all of the cabins. I sat down on the ground and looked up at the night sky. It was so beautiful. Without the lights of humanity blotting it out, the twinkling aurora of the stars were plainly in view, and the moon hung amongst them like a dim spotlight. After a while, I saw Amy come up the path, and without a word sit herself down next to me. I looked at her and could tell she couldn’t sleep either. I tried to give her a smile, but I couldn’t manage it. I saw in her face something that I had been desperately longing for: a hint of understanding. She didn’t know what I saw down in that lake, but she knew something down there had shaken me to my core. I had seen something so deeply terrifying that I will never forget. She looked back up at the sky, and then back to me.

“It’s pretty isn’t it,” she said. She had a feigned look of appreciation upon her.

“Yeah. It is.” I replied.

We sat together for a while, wordlessly sharing a view of that grand cosmic canvas of colors and lights. Then, when she was ready to leave, she leaned over to me, reaching her arms around me, and gripped me in a tight hug. At first, I was stunned and didn’t know what to do, until I felt her tears soaking into my shirt. I put my arms around her and hugged her back. After that, she got up, said goodbye, and I saw as she walked back down to her cabin. I grimaced as she did. Of the many emotions washed over me in that moment, the strongest one of them all was guilt. I felt guilt over how happy that hug made me feel. I looked back to the stars one last time, and thought of Jack. Then, I went back down the hill and tried to find some semblance of rest for the night.

I never spoke to Amy again after that, and they never found Jack. I went home with my parents that morning, slipping away without a word. I still swim on occasions. Never on the open water of course. Always in a pool, and never alone. After all, I am still good at it, and it keeps me in shape. However, whenever I go, I always have a little ritual I have to do first, without exceptions. I go up to the edge of the pool, dive into the water feet first, exhale all the air in me, and let myself sink right to the bottom. Then, I sit at the bottom of the pool and take a moment to think. Not for long, only a couple seconds or so. It’s a calming experience you see, only the sound of churning water in your ears, and a chance to be sure there’s nothing else down there with you.
