The last time it happened, I remember looking out the window and seeing blinding white light pouring in, covering the sky and all the surrounding buildings. I started to scream, dropping my coffee cup on the ground, but I could hear nothing except a ringing in my ears. It grew louder and louder, until I thought my head might split apart. Then, in an instant, it all stopped. The light and the ringing went away. I blinked my tear-filled eyes rapidly, looking around in confusion. Had I just had a stroke? Or was it a nuke going off a hundred miles away? Maybe a meteor exploding in mid-air, like in Tunguska? I had no idea, but my mind raced through more and more implausible circumstances.



And then I looked outside. I expected to see the view I had seen a million times before- the concrete apartment buildings surrounding the cul-de-sac and a thick green forest stretching out towards the horizon behind it. It was a fairly beautiful place to live, with many nearby hiking trails and lakes. But I knew looking out the window now that I would find no trails or lakes here.



The apartment building across the street, normally a four-story brownstone flat, now looked like a bombed-out husk of its former self. Only the first floor still stood at all, and most of the walls had collapsed, forming jagged, tooth-like peaks in the fractured stone of the building. On the sidewalk outside, I saw a human skeleton with tendrils of rotted hair still attached to its scalp. Pieces of rancid flesh hung to the bones, and one of the eyes still remained in the decaying face. It looked bloated and sickly, but I could still see the blue hue of the iris staring back at me. 



Huge black birds, as large as a Labrador with long, serrated beaks, pecked at the bones and gore on the skeleton. They snapped at each other, extending their curved necks and biting the others if they got too close to their side of the meal. 



The forest had also undergone an immense transformation. The lush green leaves of the trees had all disappeared. The trees themselves looked dead. Strands of black vines ran all over the forest floor, looking shiny and slick like the skin of a poisonous snake. They covered the trees and the road, protruding from the cracked, heaving concrete in hundreds of places. As I looked closer, I could see them moving, writhing. The vines twitched and jumped as something ran through them, and as this material passed through, they contracted and expanded like intestines. In certain places, a thick, black goo leaked from the vines, creating huge puddles whose surface shimmered with rainbows like oil spots under a bright sun.



Staring into the writhing mass of vines and the skeletons of dead trees, I saw something moving deeper in the forest. I couldn’t exactly make it out, but I could see its silhouette. Whatever it was, it looked absolutely massive, towering nearly as high as the trees themselves. It smashed its way through in a deafening cacophony of snapping trunks and falling limbs. And then I heard a scream start from the back room of my apartment, where my father slept- and had been sleeping for six months.

My father had worked in a prison for the better part of five years. The last time I saw him before the catastrophe, he was walking out the door in his black correctional officer uniform, his lunchbox in hand, looking back at me and smiling, telling me he loved me as he said goodbye.



At the time, I was only a twelve-year-old boy, an only child living with my mother and father in an old, rural farmhouse they had bought for cheap. The place had required a lot of work, but my father knew some plumbing, roofing, flooring and other skills, so he figured he could do a lot of it himself over time and restore the house to its pristine condition, or at least as much as possible.



But at the time, none of the projects had begun. My father seemed to work endlessly. He claimed the prison was understaffed, and they regularly forced him to work overtime and extra days. He looked tired and drawn-out as time went on, the bags under his eyes becoming more pronounced.



I had the day off from school. I sat in front of the TV, watching Looney Tunes and eating popcorn. After an hour or so, the phone rang. My mother answered it with a quiet voice, then I heard the phone crash to the ground. She started crying. I got up, going to the kitchen. The smell of freshly-brewed coffee filled the room. I saw my mother sitting at a chair at the round table in the center of the room, holding her face in her hands, crying. A cup of black coffee sat next to her, untouched.



“What is it?” I said, going over to her quickly. “Momma, what’s wrong?”



“It’s your father, honey,” she said. “He’s been stabbed. They don’t know if he’s going to make it.” All of a sudden, everything around me felt unreal, cartoonish. I couldn’t believe this was happening. I had just seen my father an hour or two ago, smiling and waving.



But that was just the beginning of the nightmare. Little did I know how much worse it would get before the end.



\***



As I stared out the window into the ruins outside, the creature crashing through the dead trees revealed itself. A massive canine face appeared through the trees, drooling long, thin strands of saliva onto the cracked pavement below. Chewing on something, it spit out a pile of bones, splintered and broken but still recognizably human. It stood on two muscular legs, with dark gray fur turning to black near its chest. Its eyes, glowing red, stared with rabid fury and bloodlust at everything around itself. Then it looked directly through the window at me.



From the back of the apartment, my father’s weak voice continued to call for me. I hadn’t heard that voice in twenty years, but I knew it instantly. I turned and ran from the window. Behind me, the ground shook as that huge, wolf-like beast began sprinting forward, its sharp claws digging into the loose dirt and ruined pavement beneath its heavy paws.



“Danny,” my father said, his voice hoarse, grating and weak. “Oh Danny, is that you?” I opened his bedroom, seeing the hospital bed, the machinery and tubes running into his body. His eyes, sunken in his thin face, stared at me. They had none of their gleam or happiness they used to contain. They looked like the last bit of cloudy water at the bottom of a deep well.



“You’re awake!” I said, my heart thundering in my chest. I had feared this day would come, staying up late, night after night, worrying about it. I had considered every way out. Twenty years ago, my mother and I had tried to pull the plug, to give him peace and rest at the end. But instead of dying in his sleep, he had woken up, leading to endless death and destruction, and I had never tried it again.



Teams of doctors had studied his brain. They said that, somewhere inside, he must be conscious. The scans showed activity, as if he were simply dreaming rather than in an endless coma. I had tried to find a doctor who might euthanize him, but since I didn’t live in Oregon, no physician would risk breaking the law by performing a euthanasia or assisted suicide.



“I’m awake,” my father croaked, his voice sounding hoarse and dry. I grabbed a bottle of water from the bedside table and put it to his lips, letting him take small sips. He kept his eyes open, staring at me. Those green eyes, which had once been bright and happy, now looked haunted and dead.



“Do you know what…” I began to say in a wavering voice, but then the building shook. I heard shattering glass and falling bricks. Furniture and dishware all over the apartments shattered. Above me, I heard my neighbors shrieking in mortal terror. A baby started crying, and then its mother started pleading in a high, panicked voice.



I heard more crashing, and it sounded like the front of the building had collapsed. Suddenly, the family above my apartment went silent. I snuck quietly to the front of my apartment, where I saw the door smashed in, piles of bricks and insulation littering the entire front entrance and living room. And I saw the back of those paws, each as tall as a child, as the wolf creature walked off with something in its hands, chewing and spitting out pieces of bones and gore. I froze, feeling tired and numb. A part of me wanted to crawl into bed and pretend none of this was happening. Perhaps when I woke up, everything would have returned to normal.



“What year is it?” my father said in a tired voice.



“2019,” I said.


“So this is just like before?” His eyes looked watery and sick, like an old dog about to be euthanized. The whites had turned into a off-yellow jelly. I sighed.



“Just like before,” I agreed. “1999, the last time you woke up. When mom died…”



\***



After being stabbed twenty times by a member of Los Solidos in prison, my father had lost an enormous amount of blood. The doctors told us that he had lost the maximum amount a person could lose and still survive.



“But his brain,” they said, “likely suffered irreparable damage. We don’t know if he will ever wake up. The scans show some activity, but without him being conscious, there is no way to tell the extent of the neurological damage.” We had moved him into the house with my mother and me. My mother took care of him constantly, turning him to prevent bedsores and trying to keep him alive. On multiple occasions, I wanted to ask her why. I had no hope he would ever wake up, and if he did, I assumed, he would not be my father. Perhaps he would be a vegetable, or a drooling, bed-bound invalid, but he would certainly not be the same man who I had seen leave the house that last morning, holding his lunchbox and smiling at me with pure love and acceptance.



And yet, he did wake up. In that old, rickety farmhouse on the edge of town, surrounded by ancient pines and oaks, the first apocalypse had started the moment he opened his eyes.



My mother ran down the stairs, taking them two at a time. I had never seen an old woman move so fast in my life. I feared she would trip and break her leg or smash her skull against the polished banister.



“Oh God, oh God,” she said like a mantra, her eyes unfocused with terror. She looked right through me. Her head flicked left and right, and then she stared out the window, her mouth open, aghast.



I looked over and saw what she saw. My heart skipped a beat. Someone stood outside the window, smiling widely. It looked like a man, but his skin had been torn off. His muscles glistened with blood under the dim autumn sun. His straight, white teeth looked out of place, grinning in the sickly red skull under his pure black eyes. In one hand, he held a large butcher's knife, soaked with clotted blood.




I grabbed my mother’s hand, pulling her towards me. She felt like a statue, frozen in place. The basement door stood only a few feet away, and with all my strength, I carried her along, lifting her up off her feet when she resisted and slinging her over my shoulder. I ran into the basement stairs and turned, locking the door behind me.



At that moment, I heard windows shattering all over the first floor, then heavy footsteps.



“We have to save your father,” my mother said to me. “He is alone, bed-bound. We have to go help him!” I shook my head, putting a hand on her shoulder.



“We need a plan,” I said, thinking as fast as I could. I looked out the basement window and saw a changed world. The trees outside now oozed thick drops of blood, and the grass had turned white and dead. Strange, skinless people walked outside, holding knives and laughing in strange, guttural tones.



“No, what we really need is a weapon,” I said, thinking. My mother seemed to have gone mostly catatonic. She didn’t respond. Her eyes stared a thousand miles away, and I knew, at that moment, that she would be no help. I would have to figure out a way to survive by myself.
