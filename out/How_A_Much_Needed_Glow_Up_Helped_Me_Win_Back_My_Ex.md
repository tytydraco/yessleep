When my boyfriend dumped me, I thought I was going to die.

I went home and cried myself to sleep. He was everything to me. I couldn’t go on living without him.
When I woke up, I decided I would do anything to get it him back.

--

First of all, I hit the gym.

I put on my yoga pants and sneakers and put *hours* in on the elliptical and in the Yoga studio. I worked on my diet too, cutting out fats and living off wheat toast.

But, it wasn’t enough. I needed results, and *fast*

So I hit up one of the girls at the gym for appetite suppressants. And they were *good*. Sometimes I
didn’t have to eat for an entire day. Sure I felt woozy, but I’d generally have enough energy to just about make it through.

Next came the hair.

I bought two bottles of strong peroxide and soaked my head in a bath of it for like a half hour.
I must have zoned out a little, because the next thing I knew my scalp was burning like hell! It was all red and sore as I was combing it out, and little teeth kept ripping out big clumps of hair, but it was the exact colour I wanted.

*Platinum* blonde.

After the hair came something a little more – drastic.

I’d always hated my face. How my eyes were too narrow and my mouth was too small. I had these big, goofy ears too that used to stick out if I brushed my hair behind them. 

They looked so *ugly*.

So I took something from the kitchen drawer and made some – changes.

I sliced off my eyelids. I carved into the corners of my mouth. I filed down my teeth too, a little pointy, but straight. 

And I cut off my big, stupid ears, to make myself *pretty*.

Now I was perfect.

It was time to take back *my man*.

--

It was the dead of night when I arrived at my boyfriend’s house.

I wanted to make it a surprise for him, so I didn’t ring the doorbell. I went around back where I knew they kept a spare key hidden.

But he wasn’t alone.

I wasn’t mad though. Because when his new girl saw me – she *screamed*. She screamed because she knew she couldn’t compete.

She ran from the house.

For a moment, my boyfriend just stared at me in confusion. His mouth was opening and closing like a fish out of water.

I knew he didn’t recognise me.

So I told him it was me, that I’d *fixed* myself for him. Then he started to cry.

I shushed him, stroking his hair softly as he wept.

I just held him for a moment. Seeing the blue and red lights flashing in the window, feeling the plastic
handle of the kitchen knife still in my grip…

…and told him it’d all be okay…

*…we’d be together –* **forever…**
