It's been a year since this has happened but I've been too traumatised from this experience to talk about it.

Before she went missing I had a dog called Molly, she was a good dog, very friendly, would like to cuddle up with me and would never hurt anyone.

It was like this until one day I came home from work and went to let Molly in as I always kept her out in the back garden when I was at work, only she wasn't there.

I called her name about five times before going out to check for her and she wasn't there, I went to check with my neighbours to see if they had seen her, but none of them had.

I was extremely worried and went out to look for her but could find her, I returned home late that night and didn't eat or sleep I was too worried to.

The next day I called into work sick so I could take the time to look for her, but I never found her.

I barely slept that night again.

For the next 2 months I was only getting three to four hours of sleep a night, eventually I went to therapy and talked to a therapist about this, I went to therapy for the next year.

It was eight months later and I thought it was all over me, I came home from work one day and saw something out the back...was that Molly.

It was sure a dog and it looked like Molly, same fur, breed, even collar, but there was some kind of red substance on her paws, still I went out to give her a hug as I was glad she was back but she growled at me, she had never done this before, something was off about her, I decided to leave the back door open incase she wanted to come in at some point.

I made my dinner, she came in the house when she realised there was chicken, now this was a second red flag for me as Molly had always disliked chicken, she would always turn her nose up at it.

After cleaning up I went into the living room to watch the tv, I left both the living room and kitchen door open incase she wanted to come is (she usually does this) after watching tv for about one hour Molly came in but it was odd I never saw her come in, and when she did she just stood on the carpet looking at me with an unsettling stare, it was odd.

Three hours later I decided to go to bed after all it was ten o'clock about my normal time.

I got into bed and fell fast asleep as I was happy Molly was home again.

It was around two in the morning when I woke up and was feeling faint, I looked down to see a chunk of my skin missing and my bed sheets covered in blood, I screamed so loud the neighbours could probably hear me, I then looked to my left and saw Molly chewing on something, I went to see what she was chewing on when she snapped her head around and growled at me except this time she looked different, her beard was soaked in blood, her teeth were razor sharp nearly like a sharks and her eyes had been rolled back I to her head showing just the whites of them, I managed to get a look at what she was chewing and it was the missing chunk of my skin.

I felt sick to my stomach and immediately got up and sprinted for the kitchen to get a piece of cloth and some tape to hopefully seal off the womb enough until I managed to get to the hospital. Molly was following me more aggressive than ever.

I managed to escape her and get into my car and went to drive to the hospital nearly blacking out on the way, I pulled up in the hospital car park feeling extremely faint.

I went over to the reception area, "help please my dog has bit a chunk of my skin off I'm feeling fai-", it was at this point I blacked out.

I woke up in a hospital bed hooked up to an iv drip and my arm bandaged up, then a nurse came in, "Your finally awake it's been three days, we were able to get you bandaged up, your lucky you didn't die from the amount of blood you lost", the nurse left my room at this point.

I turned on the tv in my room, I was just in time to catch the news, "wild flesh hungry dog on the loose, what ever you do don't let it into your house" to the left of the news reporter was a picture of that thing that I thought was Molly.
