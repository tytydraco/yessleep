It feels impossible to get out of bed. I'm not tied down or injured, not that I can tell. I've even dreamed I stood up, that I made myself my first meal in months. I wake up staring at the ceiling every time. 

It's not like I get bored, or that I'm in any real danger. I think my metabolism slowed downâ€”maybe it's from all the sleeping. I took a nap last week and woke up today, still feeling like I had a bee's nest where my brain should be. I looked it up, and the longest you're supposed to go without water is just a few days. I had a water bottle at some point, but I drank it all in the first month or so. Never came out the other end, either, so that's a plus. My phone's plugged in and there's no signs of it wearing down any time soon, so I have all the internet I could ever need. Honestly, I could see myself living like this for the rest of my life. Barely waking up, dreaming of standing, then returning to sleep for another week or month or year.

I do have some regrets, though. If anyone lives in near the University of Michigan, could you check around for a little black and white tabby? I found him as a stray, back when I could still get up and walk, and he put his trust in me. He begged me to feed him. I stopped hearing from him after the last time I slept. I hope he got out somehow. He deserved better.

I'm feeling quite tired now. I closed my eyes, just for a moment, and I thought I was still awake. I imagined that I was getting up, grasping the doorknob as the blood drained from my head and everything went all faint and white, and I dreamed that when I opened my eyes again I was still standing. I knew it wasn't real when I saw him curled up by the kitchen, still waiting by his food bowl. It's an old pie tin, because I never expected to bring a little one into my life and I didn't have the time for anything more. In the dream, he wakes up when I walk in the room and he forgives me, or does not even know there is anything to forgive. He purrs when he sees me, that unconditional love and trust in his eyes as he twines himself around my ankles. And I crack open a tin of food and he laps it up, tail swishing in joy, and for just a moment I can imagine that he is still alive.

I just opened my eyes again. He's gone, of course. The house is closed. The air is stale and still. If I get up and look around, I will see where he has collapsed, weakly, betrayed, hiding his illness from predators. From monsters. From me.

I think I'm going back to [sleep.](https://www.reddit.com/r/bubblewriters/comments/1hzfv05/orchard_masterpost/)
