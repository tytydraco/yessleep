The first thing I remember was the same old smell I had at my old apartment. It smelled like a smoker on high heat. It didn’t smell very good but I had gotten used to it. The smell made me remember the feeling of being safe and at home. Now I just feel empty and full of an endless void. I decided to go on a drive. I pulled into an abandoned parking lot and decided to just relax. Minutes later a car pulls in next to me. I looked over but the tint was too dark to see. The car was a shaggy white gray color with a damaged hood and bumpers. On the back bumper was a sticker but I couldn’t read it as it was facing away from me. I rolled down my window to see if I could find out who it was in the car. The car just started again and sped off. 
     

I followed it closely because of a gut feeling I had in me. The car took a turn and went straight into the woods. It looked as if the car fazed right through the trees. As I pull off the edge of the forest I stop the car and get out to investigate. I can hear the sound of the wind in the trees. The car sounds seemed to have gotten too far away to hear. I walk closer to the trees and realized that the trees were way too close together to drive through. Sitting bewildered I realized it was dark out and decided to head home. 
     

When I woke up the next morning I couldn’t help but think about how that car was able to fit through there, so I made a plan to go back to the parking lot at the same time tonight. When I got there it felt like I was reliving the same experience. But there was no car. I sat and waited for something to happen but nothing did. Right before I left the lot the same beat-up car drove up to me. I got out of my car to knock on the door of the other car to hopefully get answers from the driver. When I knocked nothing happened. It felt as if there wasn’t a driver. The car sped off again and I got in my car and followed. This time I was much closer and could hopefully get to see how the car went through the woods. 
     

The car got up to the woods and didn’t stop. It just kept moving through. I decided I should try it too because maybe it would work for me. My car crashed right into the tree that the previous car went right through. I woke up in the hospital and they asked me if I was drinking at all last night. I told them everything but they looked at me like I was crazy. I decided since I had very minor injuries I would go back out and investigate again tonight. The same car pulled in and left. As I followed this time it felt like something was different about it. The sticker on the back was torn in half and the bumper was more damaged. I followed it to the edge of the forest again but instead of running into a tree, I decided to follow on foot. The car was really fast but I could hear it in the distance. As I walked I realized the car left no mark of its being there and seemed to just faze through all the trees. 
     

The car sound vanished in the distance. I realized that I was lost and tried to decide whether head back or not. I ultimately did because I didn’t want to starve since I brought limited snacks and water. I tracked back through the woods and started to hear weird sounds. They sounded odd and eerily familiar. I had the feeling of being watched and the hairs on my back began to stick up. At first, they sounded far away but as a walked, they got closer and closer. I decided to stop because I was tired and nervous from approaching the weird sounds. As I sat the sound finally started to sound as if they were getting farther away again. But just as I started to relax they sound as if they were right next to me. I felt breath on the back of my neck and I tried not to panic. I remember a friend telling me to never panic if I feel threatened because that gives whatever it is power when you are afraid. 
     

I slowly turned my head and there was nothing. I fell asleep after I put together a quick fire. About an hour later I awoke to the sounds again. But this time they sounded more like the scratching on a blackboard and an inhuman screeching. As soon as the sound ended I heard whistling. The whistling sounded creepy and it made my skin crawl. I don’t know why but I needed to Whistle back for some reason. I started hearing rustling in the distance. It sounded like heavy footsteps. And they were getting closer! The footsteps turned into a jog and then a full inhuman-sounding sprint. 
     

I ran as fast as I could in the other direction. I turned to my side to see a shadow with glowing eyes following close behind. I started to panic and tripped into a tree root. The creature came up to me and stood over me. It seemed to smile at me. But the smile was not friendly at all. It spread across his face making it look inhuman. The creature opened its huge mouth and it had giant teeth with drool dripping out of its mouth. The last I remember was it biting my arm off.
