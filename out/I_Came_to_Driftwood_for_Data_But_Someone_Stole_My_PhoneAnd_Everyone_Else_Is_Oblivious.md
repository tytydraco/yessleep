I didn’t come to Driftwood for the beach. I came for the data. This town is a petri dish of human vanity, and I have three months of social mapping on my phone—the hidden debts, the fake net worths, the actual connections between the people who think they run this coast. In a place where reputation is the only currency, that phone is a nuclear device.

At 10:00 AM, the outlier appeared on the boardwalk. While everyone jogged, posed, or status-climbed, a man in a charcoal blazer stood perfectly still. He was a dead signal in a sea of high-frequency noise. Watching him, I tripped over a warped plank, nearly face-planting into a trash can. I coughed and straightened my shirt. No one noticed. In Driftwood, if you aren’t a mirror, you’re invisible.

I retreated to the pier café, the place I call the Control Room. Here, the currency changes from vanity to information. Finn, the barista, pulled espresso shots like he was arming warheads while Missy sat in the far corner. She was the town’s information broker, harvesting secrets from the nerds to sell back to the elites at the Crescent. Her eyes lingered on my pocket. She knew my phone held the only copy of my mapping.

Lunch was a theater of the absurd at the Runway. Pierce performed success for a group of interns while Margot fussed over the energy of the table settings. I sat at the edge, a ghost in the machinery. Every gesture felt calibrated, every laugh a performance, every glance a transaction. I sipped my water and made mental notes, watching the social currents flow toward the wealthy.

Then the Man in Charcoal moved. He didn’t just walk; he intercepted. As he brushed past my table, his sleeve caught the back of my chair.

“Excuse me.” His voice was a cold, professional rasp.

I jumped. My hand jerked sideways, knocking my silver fork to the floor with a metallic clatter. For three seconds, the entire Runway stopped. I wasn’t the observer anymore. I was a smudge on their map. From the café entrance, Missy caught my eye and smiled. It was the only honest expression in the room.

As I followed the Man in Charcoal with my eyes, Missy passed behind him, walking with deliberate grace. She didn’t acknowledge him, didn’t break stride, but I saw it—something dark and wet sloshing at her feet, like a half-forgotten meal… or worse. She stepped over it effortlessly, didn’t flinch, didn’t bring it up.

I froze. Everyone else seemed oblivious. The boardwalk carried on, joggers and tourists acting normal. My stomach rolled. My brain refused to label it. She didn’t acknowledge the mess. Didn’t even glance down. And she smiled at me, calm, polite, as if nothing had happened. I couldn’t tell if it was control or madness. It was a small thing, but it said everything.

The Man in Charcoal lingered near the railing, surveying the crowd with sharp, deliberate eyes. He looked out of place in the shorts and linen around him, overdressed and hyper-aware. He was either testing me or marking me. Either way, I couldn’t look away.

By evening, the sunset ritual began. White linen and forced laughter filled the air, while lanterns lined the shore and soft fabrics draped every surface. The town drifted into a state of restless obsession. I leaned back, letting the thrill and unease wash over me. Driftwood Bay looked charming, peaceful, and utterly ridiculous. It was a perfect, fragile facade.

I reached into my bag to check my messages. Empty fabric.

My heart did a slow, sickening roll. My phone was gone.

I looked toward the parking lot. The Man in Charcoal sat in the driver’s seat of a black SUV, engine idling. He wasn’t looking at the road. He was looking at the café door, where Missy stepped out. She didn’t look surprised; she looked like she was waiting for a ride.

She caught my gaze and tapped her pocket.

I had no idea if I wanted to chase them or let the game begin.
