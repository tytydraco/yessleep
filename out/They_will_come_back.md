I’m a patient in a psychiatric ward, every now and then I can still feel the shadows creeping up on me. They were always there, lurking in the corners of my mind, tormenting me with their presence. I was never able to control my thoughts or actions because they were always there, whispering to me, urging me to do things I didn't want to do.

At first, I thought it was just my imagination playing tricks on me. I would see things out of the corner of my eye, a fleeting glimpse of a dark figure moving in the shadows. But as time went on, the shadows became more and more real. They would whisper to me in the dead of night, telling me to do unspeakable things. They could move objects, hurt people.

I tried to ignore them, to shut them out, but they were always there, lurking in the dark corners. And then one night, they finally took control. I don't remember much of what happened, but when I woke up the next morning, I was covered in blood. 

My nurse tried to tell me that it was just a nightmare, that I had imagined everything, but I knew the truth. The shadows had taken control, and I was just a puppet, dancing to their tune.

After that, they put me in isolation, locked me away in a small, windowless room. I thought that would be the end of it, that the shadows would finally leave me alone. But I was wrong. They were still there, whispering to me through the walls, calling out to me in the darkness.

Days turned into weeks, weeks turned into months, and I began to lose track of time. I was trapped in that room, tormented by the shadows that would never leave me alone.

And then one day, I woke up to find that the door to my room was open. I don't know how it happened, but I knew it was a trap. The shadows were luring me out, tempting me with the promise of freedom.

But I couldn't resist. I stumbled out of my room, my heart pounding in my chest. The hallway was dark, and I could hear the whispers of the shadows echoing through the walls.

I tried to run, but my legs felt like lead. The shadows were closing in on me, suffocating me with their darkness. And then I saw it, a figure standing at the end of the hallway, its eyes glowing with an otherworldly light. It stepped forward with the nurse dead beside them.

I tried to turn back, but it was too late. The figure stepped toward me, and I felt a cold, clammy hand close around my neck. And then it went black.

When I woke up, I was back in my room, but something was different. The shadows were gone, and I felt a sense of peace that I had never experienced before.  I don't know what happened that night, but I do know one thing. The shadows are real, and they will never stop. Not until they get me.
