The advertisement droned on as I zoned out once again. But for a slight moment, my interest was peaked. All I wanted was to feel better, To feel lighter. I struggled to get up from the couch but once I did I stumbled outside to my car. It shook and swayed as I stuffed myself inside. Leaving home was humiliating but maybe this Hall-O stuff could help. The ad was full of husky guys like me and if it saved them maybe it could save me. 

It took a while to get to town since I lived out in the middle of bumblefuck nowhere. That was another reason to test out these meds, I lived so far from town that if I needed help from first responders id be fucked. I finally arrived at the drugstore after 40 minutes. The people in the store gave me no problems but I could sense their shame and disgust.

“Will this be all sir”

“Ye-Yes” I responded quickly. 

“Have a lovely day.”

I shimmed outside and back to my car quickly. *WiLl tHiS bE AlL SiR.* Her mockery played over in my head as I tried to get in my car. Will this be all or do you want a burger with that you fat pig? Who does that bitch think she is. My blood was boiling.        

I refused to wait till I got home I immediately took a handful of the pills and swallowed. I didn't feel anything I understood this would probably be a process that took place over time but I wanted results. No, I needed results. Society hated me because of who I was and if I could lose half these pounds like the people in the ad I'd finally be accepted. I took even more when I got home and when I went to bed that night. But once I woke up no results. 

I lumbered to the couch before washing my sorrows down with a 12 liter of soda. Then I felt horrible. Only after a few moments on the couch, did I feel a burning pain I'd never once experienced in my life. It felt like molten glass was sloshing around in my stomach. I rushed as fast as I could to the bathroom. I bent over the toilet and emptied my guts into it. I sat next to the toilet for hours on end. I sat by the toilet throwing up until the sunset. My entire day was unadulterated torment.

It finally stopped and I got up shacking. I didn't feel any lighter just like a sweating mess. I made my way to my bedroom to lie down, another day wasted away but rather than rotting on the sofa, I vomited nonstop. I couldn't tell you what it was I was throwing up. It was some gross pinkish-whitish gooey liquid but that shit was behind me now. I took more meds before I went to bed praying that it would finally help me.

When I woke up the next morning I did feel different. I felt like a new man. I hadn't decreased in volume, the fatty folds were still present but I wasn't heavy. I could move around like a normal person. I was in pure bliss. I went out around noon. I didn't want to go anywhere in particular I just wanted the world to see the new me. I was free of my bodily restraints. Hall-O had saved my life and couldn't have been more grateful.  

Once I got home I sat down on the couch. This time however I wasn't just sitting on a dirty loveseat I found in the dump. I was a king resting on his throne I was in my glory and I couldn't be happier. 

Then I felt it again, the burning in my stomach.  I slowly made my way to the bathroom but I wasn't able to make it however. I fell to my knees and began to puke. It was not the same stuff as last time though. It was some type of small silverfish-looking insect. They poured out of me like a faucet. And when I finally could catch my breath I felt that pitter-patter of tiny feet making their way back down my throat. I watched as the ones I had expelled scoured around the floor hiding in cracks and going up walls. Some tried to crawl onto me but I hastily brushed them off.

I didn't know what to do. I was terrified and began to cry. Once I finished crying I took more meds and went to bed. Because feeling good is just the beginning.
