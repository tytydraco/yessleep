**Day 6 – Digging up ruins and problems – UTC: 10:32 AM – Transcribed video log.**

(Video is filmed in a 16:9 smartphone ratio. Filming from a selfie perspective. Hector is wearing a yellow hazmat suit and gasmask with blue lenses. The background is a light forested landscape with tall, teal grass, and deep blue, cedar-looking trees with black trunks. There are 5 buggies behind Hector. There is the sound of light wind in the background and the weather is overcast.)

**Lieutenant Hector:** Mornin’ guys, reporting from the field and we’ve got video this time\~. Today we’re exploring that floating, buried structure I told you guys about.

(Hector switches the camera to film forward and he affixes it to a head mount.)

(Hector is walking towards the slightly dug out structure, hovering 3 meters off the ground. Some of the foliage concealing it has been cut away. There is a tented off, biohazard exclusion, mobile staircase leading up to and connecting to the structure; the stairs are about 4 meters tall. There are 12 other people wearing yellow hazard suits and gas masks, like Hector’s. Some are wearing backpacks.)

**Lieutenant Hector:** Here with Dr. Gram, Head Archeologist, and Lin again.

(Two of the people turn to look. Presumably Dr. Gram and the shorter, thinner one, with a backpack being Lin.)

**Junior AB Lin:** Hello\~.

(The shorter one that said “hello” waves.)

**Lieutenant Hector:** Dr. Gram, got anything to say to the people back on earth?

**Dr. Gram:** Aliens are real. It looks like they’re extinct but, we found aliens\~.

(Everyone laughs softly.)

**Lieutenant Hector:** Before we enter, care to explain these hazmat suits for the folks back on earth?

**Dr. Gram:** Sure. First thing to know, this is actually quite odd what we’re looking at. This large, 37 meter tall structure; 40 if you include the hovering. It’s entirely covered in dirt and grass. However, structures this tall, no matter HOW MUCH time passes, will never be buried in dirt unless the entire ground level rises… Sure, there’d be plants growing all around it, it’d be horribly overgrown on the sides but, dirt doesn’t climb walls… So…

(Dr. Gram opens his arms and then claps his hands together.)

**Dr. Gram:** We’ve got several questions... One of them being, “What’s been trapped and fermenting inside this castle and is it safe to breathe?” Hence, the protective suits.

But uh… Yeah, for now we’re all coming up blank here on how dirt got all over it.

… Oh and, it’s floating.

(A few people, including Hector, laugh a little.)

**Dr. Gram:** Alright, we good Hector?

**Lieutenant Hector:** All set, doctor\~.

(Dr. Gram nods and waves a hand towards the buried structure. Hector, Lin, Dr. Gram, and the 10 other archeologists all begin to walk towards the tented off stairs. Some are carrying floodlight poles, some other equipment, and a field laptop. Hector jogs ahead and is the first to start climbing the stairs.)

(After a brief ascent, Hector, Dr. Gram, and the other archeologists come into a large antechamber. There are 2 doors to the left and 2 to the right of the long room, and a door towards the end of the room. Two floodlights are set up as light is dim inside, and the field laptop is placed on a small table and opened by one of the archeologists sitting on the floor.)

**Dr. Gram:** Careful when looking around, especially on stairs. False stair spike traps remain functional, regardless of how much time passes.

(The archeologist at the field laptop waves.)

**Archeologist 1:** Suit trackers are online. If you get lost, radio in and I can guide you back from here.

**Dr. Gram:** Excellent.

(Hector begins looking around at everyone. A couple of archeologists walk through the door on the left side.)

**Lieutenant Hector:** Where is…?

(Hector walks back towards the entrance into the tented off stairs and looks down. Lin is at the bottom of the stairs on the 2^(nd) or 3^(rd) step, holding onto the rails with both hands.)

**Lieutenant Hector:** Dr. Gram, I’ll be right back.

**Dr. Gram:** Alright.

(Hector descends the stairs. Once he approaches the bottom, he raises a hand to wave hello.)

**Lieutenant Hector:** Hey Lin.

**Junior AB Lin:** Hi. Sorry, I-I got this.

(Lin takes a single stiff and quick step up and stops moving again.)

**Lieutenant Hector:** Here, how about this? ‘Scuse me.

(Lin steps back down as Hector descends past her and positions himself behind her.)

**Lieutenant Hector:** If something happens, I’m RIGHT here to catch you. Sound good?

(Lin nods and starts to climb the stairs again, a little more confidently.)

**Lieutenant Hector:** Once you’ve done this a few times, you’ll be going up and down stairs like this like it’s nothing. You got this\~.

**Junior AB Lin:** Yeah…

(Lin nods slowly, clearly focused on climbing. She’s still using both hands to hold onto each rail.)

(During the climb, one of the archeologists peers down from the top of the steps. Hector raises his hand, the archeologist nods, and goes back into the structure. It takes about 2 minutes but, Lin is able to get to the top of the stairs.)

(There’s only Dr. Gram and the archeologist at the laptop. Dr. Gram turns to look at Hector and Lin.)

**Dr. Gram:** Ah, Lin. Are we alright?

**Junior AB Lin:** Yes, Dr. Gram. Pardon the delay.

**Dr. Gram:** It’s alright, you and the Lieutenant are with me.

**Lieutenant Hector and Lin:** Yes.

**Dr. Gram:** You gonna be fine here by yourself?

(The Archeologist seated on the floor with his laptop gives a thumbs up.)

**Archeologist 1:** No problem.

**Dr. Gram:** Excellent. Let’s go\~.

(Dr. Gram, Hector, and Lin walk towards the middle door at the end of the antechamber. Lin is looking up at it’s high ceiling as the three walk.)

(Dr. Gram grabs the handle and slowly pushes the door open.)

(The door leads to what appears to be a dining room with a long table.)

(All 3 of them pull out and turn on flashlights, as natural light becomes weaker as they go deeper into the structure.)

(Everything, aside from being dusty, is perfectly neat. The table cloth is set and all chairs are pushed in, except the one at the end of the table. The chair looks as though the last person who sat in it got up, and didn’t bother to push the chair back.)

(There is another door at the end of the room.)

(Hector walks along the right side and Dr. Gram on the left side of the table, observing the surroundings. Lin is following behind Hector. Dr. Gram briefly runs two fingers along the table, a very clear trail is left in the thick layer of dust.)

(Once the three reach the end of the room, Dr. Gram once again opens the door. This time it leads to a kitchen.)

(The walls are lined with cooking stations and a large island table at the center. On it is an empty bowl.)

**Dr. Gram:** … Hey, bring the camera over here. See that?

(Hector looks into the bowl, it looks to have a dark color in the middle that fades to white on the edges.)

**Dr. Gram:** Pretty sure this is whatever’s left of the food that used to be in here.

**Lieutenant Hector:** Huh, really? Figured that was a design coloring.

**Dr. Gram:** I think that’s food so ancient, that it corroded into nearly nothing and the remains made a stain on the bowl. This place must’ve been abandoned for… At least 200 years. Lin, mind putting this bowl into a sample bag?

**Junior AB Lin:** Yes, doctor.

(Lin pulls out a sealable bag from her backpack, places the bowl into it, and puts it back into her backpack.)

(Dr. Gram is looking through an open doorway into the next room.)

(Dr. Gram motions the 2 to come by waving his hand and they follow.)

(Hector enters into a large, 25m x 25m, stone room with a spiral staircase in the middle. Shining their lights around, the space appears to be entirely empty except for the stairs.)

(After a brief walk, Hector is directly under the staircase, looking up. He shines his flashlight up the stairwell, revealing it goes up 5 floors.)

**Lieutenant Hector:** You good Lin?

**Junior AB Lin:** Yeah, I’m fine with these indoor, stone stairs. They look more…

(Lin waves her open palms at the stairs.)

**Junior AB Lin:** Sturdy.

(Hector nods.)

**Lieutenant Hector:** There’s another door to the left here. Are we checking that out or going up first?

**Dr. Gram:** I’d like to see the upper floors.

**Lieutenant Hector:** Right, I’ll go first.

(Hector climbs 8 steps, when a sudden and audible gust of wind blows past him from behind. It appears to be strong enough that Hector is pushed forward slightly and has to crouch down.)

**Lieutenant Hector:** Whoawwwww…

(A door can be heard slamming shut.)

(Hector looks towards the door they came into the room from and sees it’s now closed. Lin leans in the direction of the door… and begins to jog towards it.)

(Hector climbs back down the stairs as Lin gets to the door… and pushes it open. She sighs, sounding relieved.)

**Dr. Gram:** It’s alright, just a draft shutting the door. Probably the opening at the main entrance.

**Lieutenant Hector:** Wait, what about the hazard tent? Isn’t that sealing this place?

**Dr. Gram:** Oh… Right…

(Dr. Gram pulls out his radio and presses a switch.)

**Dr. Gram:** This is Dr. Gram, has anyone made an opening in this place?

…

**Archeologist 2 (radio):** No. I’m near some windows right now but, all I see is the dirt covering them.

**Dr. Gram:** So, everything’s still sealed?

…

**Archeologist 3 (radio):** Yeah, unless someone got a digging crane out here, I doubt anyone could’ve made an opening. Why, what’s up?

**Dr. Gram:** Just had a pretty harsh gust of wind blow past us. Figured someone left a door open but, this place is totally sealed.

…

**Dr. Gram:** It’s probably fine though. I mean, this place floats. There could be all sorts of weird physics working here that we haven’t discovered.

(Hector and Lin nod a few times.)

**Lieutenant Hector:** Hmh, makes sense.

**Dr. Gram:** Continue searching this place and documenting what you find.

**Archeologist 3 (radio):** Yes sir.

(Dr. Gram puts his radio away. … He flicks his thumb up towards the stairs and begins ascending.)

(Hector begins climbing as well, followed by Lin.)

(As they reach the 2^(nd) floor, it’s another empty, 25m x 25m room. Sunlight is almost nonexistent here and the 2^(nd) floor is extremely dark. There is one door at the back, positioned in the direction the kitchen door would be on the ground floor.)

(Dr. Gram swings his flashlight around and sees a window positioned opposite the door, covered in the dirt from outside.

(Dr. Gram shrugs and continues up.)

(Reaching the 3^(rd) floor, they find what appears to be a dense library. There are some ladders around, for reaching higher book shelves. The landing of the 3^(rd) floor has a few tables and chairs surrounding it.)

**Dr. Gram:** Ohhhhhh my… Hhhhhhahahahahah\~.

(Dr. Gram looks around briefly before picking a book out gently and setting it on one of the wooden tables.)

(Hector shines his light on it as Dr. Gram opens the book with both hands. It’s contents are written in an unknown language.)

**Dr. Gram:** Ah, right. Can’t read any of this… But this is huge, they had language and books.

Lin, get out some field sample bags. Let’s take some of these home with us, we’ll hand’em off to the linguists.

(Hector looks up to see Lin already perusing some of the books and picking them off shelves. She’s bouncing in place a little, appearing to be excited. She looks at Dr. Gram and nods quickly.)

**Junior AB Lin:** Yeah, yeah\~.

(Dr. Gram gets up and starts picking out a few books and placing them on the table. Lin places each book into a sealed bag and stores them in her backpack.)

(Hector’s camera view suddenly spins around towards the stairs, shining his light on them.)

…

**Dr. Gram:** What is it?

**Lieutenant Hector:** Wait.

(The sound of the doctor’s walking and Lin placing books into bags has ceased. Presumably they’ve stopped moving to listen.)

…

(There’s a distant sound of footsteps, it sounds like it’s coming from a higher floor.)

**Lieutenant Hector:** (Sigh)… Must be one of the others. Sorry about that.

**Dr. Gram:** No problem. Lin, get these stored and follow us up. Gonna say hi to whoever’s up there.

**Junior AB Lin:** Will do\~.

**Dr. Gram:** Coming Lieutenant?

(Hector looks at Lin. She nods once.)

**Lieutenant Hector:** Yeah, let’s go.

(Dr. Gram and Hector both walk up the stairs to the 4^(th) floor. The sound of footsteps is slightly louder and a flashlight beam can be seen from the 5^(th) floor, cutting through the pitch blackness and panning along its floor. The light is coming from the right and panning slowly.)

**Dr. Gram:** Hello up there\~! You guys find anything good? We got a library down here!

…

(Dr. Gram and Hector continue climbing past the 4^(th) floor. Hector quickly waves his flashlight around the floor. It appears to be an emptier library.)

**Dr. Gram:** Helloooo?

(The flashlight beam from the 5^(th) floor recedes as they’re halfway between the 4^(th) and 5^(th) floor.)

(As they come up to the 5^(th) floor, Hector and Dr. Gram both look to the right, where the light came from… It’s another empty, 25m x 25m room, aside from a single, wooden table. There’s 2 closed doors on each end of the room and no further floors going up.)

**Dr. Gram:** … Hello?

…

(Hector and Dr. Gram exchange a look briefly.)

…

(Hector begins walking towards the door that’s in roughly the same direction the flashlight beam was pointing from.)

**Lieutenant Hector:** Maybe whoever that was left through this door.

Hey, someone there?!

(Hector tries to open the door, but it’s locked. As he removes his hand, he leaves a clear handprint on the heavily dusty handle. He shakes his head and looks back at Dr. Gram.)

**Lieutenant Hector:** Locked.

(Hector wipes his hands together, getting dust off of them. He does this while walking back to Dr. Gram, who is still at the 5^(th) floor landing.)

**Lieutenant Hector:** Judging by the dust, that door handle’s gone untouched as long as the rest of this place.

… Dr. Gram, I think we should go. I don’t like this. And I still don’t like that we had wind blowing through an entirely enclosed structure.

**Dr. Gram:** I… agree… It’s dark, we’re getting a bit spooked, we just need some fresh air to calm our nerves.

(Hector nods.)

(As the 2 descend, Dr. Gram pulls out his radio.)

**Dr. Gram:** Hey, this is Gram. Has anyone made it to the 5^(th) floor?

…

**Dr. Gram:** This is Dr. Gram. Has anyone made it to the 5^(th) floor?

…

**Dr. Gram:** Try your radio, maybe something’s wrong with mine.

(Hector pulls his radio out.)

**Lieutenant Hector:** This is Hector, I need everyone to check in with your name and what floor you’re on.

…

(Dr. Gram and Hector come to the 3^(rd) floor where Lin has finished packing, is holding her radio, and is looking in the direction of the two. Hector calls out to lin-)

**Lieutenant Hector:** Lin, c’mon, we’re going.

**Junior AB Lin:** C-coming.

(Lin pockets her radio, hikes her bag up onto her back and follows as they continue down the stairs. Hector briefly slows down for Lin to catch up. Dr. Gram is leading, followed by Hector, then Lin at the back.)

(Hector talks into his radio again.)

**Lieutenant Hector:** This is Hector, I need everyone to call in, **now.**

…

**Lieutenant Hector:** The radio’s definitely transmitting, I’m hearing my voice from the radios in your pockets.

**Junior AB Lin:** What happened?

**Lieutenant Hector:** … We saw light from a flashlight up there. Figured it was one of the team who’d found another way up. We get to the top and it’s a dead end with nobody there.

So… we’re gonna step outside for a minute, clear our heads.

**Junior AB Lin:** O-oh…

(The three make it to the ground floor and begin walking back towards the kitchen.)

(Hector looks back and points his flashlight at the stairs while walking. Lin also looks back when Hector does, then turns back to face him.)

**Junior AB Lin:** What is it?

**Lieutenant Hector:** Just watching our backs.

(Hector slows down heavily and lets Lin pass him, still watching the stairs.)

**Lieutenant Hector:** I’ll take the rear, go on.

(Hector turns around to see that while Dr. Gram has continued to walk ahead into the kitchen, Lin has slowed down to wait for him.)

(Hector waves his hand towards the door, gesturing Lin to keep walking.)

(There is another sudden gust of wind blowing towards them and the door shuts, separating Dr. Gram from the other two.)

(Lin audibly yelps. Hector walks to the door quickly and pushes on the handle. It doesn’t open.)

(There is the sound of the door being pulled from the other side, presumably Dr. Gram also trying to open the door.)

**Dr. Gram (muffled):** Hector, Lin!

**Lieutenant Hector:** We’re ok.

(Hector jiggles the handle briefly but, it doesn’t open the door.)

**Lieutenant Hector:** Just locked… Locking mechanism might’ve slipped into place when the door got slammed by the wind…

(The door handle jiggles from the other end.)

**Dr. Gram (muffled):** Wait, this lock is stuck. How did…? … We’ve got a fire axe in one of the buggies, I’m gonna go get it and cut this door down.

**Lieutenant Hector:** Thank you, Lin and I will try to look for another way out while you do that.

**Dr. Gram (muffled):** Ok, I’ll keep in radio contact. You two stay safe.

**Lieutenant Hector:** You too, doc.

(Dr. Gram is heard walking away from the door.)

(Hector turns to look at Lin. She’s visibly shaking and wrapping her arms around her stomach.)

**Lieutenant Hector:** Hey, it’s ok… Just a little delay, that’s all\~.

(Lin nods, still shaking.)

(Hector pulls out a black, 9mm pistol and shakes it slightly.)

**Lieutenant Hector:** Does this help? Somethin’ tries to come at us, pow\~.

(Lin sputters out a little laugh… and nods.)

(Hector holsters his gun.)

**Lieutenant Hector:** Alright, before we go searching for an alternate exit… Since this is a push door on our end…

(Hector takes a step back, takes a deep breathe, lunges forward and launches his foot to the right of the door, near the handle.)

**Lieutenant Hector:** HMPH!

\*THUD!\*

(Hector’s knee bends up and he leans into the door a bit, before pulling his foot away and shaking it.)

**Lieutenant Hector:** Agh…

(Hector tries to kick the door down 2 more times, to no success.)

**Lieutenant Hector:** This wood looks ancient. I don’t... THINK it should be this sturdy.

(Hector looks down at his sidearm… Then feels the edge of the door around the nob.)

**Lieutenant Hector:** Metal trim on the door and it’s tightly sealed… Can’t shoot out the lock either. Yeah, guess we gotta look for a way out.

(Hector jogs over to the door on the left of the room and tries pushing and pulling the handle… It’s also locked.)

**Lieutenant Hector:** Locked and this one’s a pull door on our end so, can’t kick this one.

(Hector walks towards the stairs in the middle of the room, Lin following.)

(The two begin to climb up the stairs, Hector still leading the way.)

**Lieutenant Hector:** Let’s try the 2^(nd) floor’s door. It goes in the same direction the kitchen would take us.

(The two ascend to the 2^(nd) floor. Once at the 2^(nd) floor landing, Lin starts walking towards the door and Hector hangs back briefly, looking up the spiral staircase. … Nothing.)

**Junior AB Lin:** Hector?

**Lieutenant Hector:** Coming, just checking the rear again. Still clear.

(The two of them walk across the room to the door. Hector touches the handle… Takes a deep breathe… Pushes the door handle... and it opens.)

(Hector and Lin both sigh.)

(This room appears to be an armory. There are racks of weapons and a few wooden, storage boxes.)

(Hector and Lin shine their lights around and spot a door at the middle of each wall. This deep into the castle, it’s entirely **pitch black** aside from their flashlights.)

(Hector points his flashlight to the door at the other end of the room.)

**Lieutenant Hector:** Down the middle.

**Junior AB Lin:** R-right.

(While the two walk through the armory, Hector slows down near a sword rack and picks one up.)

**Lieutenant Hector:** Hmh…

(Hector raises the sword to his side for a swing, but as he begins to swing the blade snaps off at the handle and it clatters to the ground… loudly.)

(Even Hector shudders a little at this.)

…

(Both Hector and Lin’s flashlights are pointed at the snapped off blade.)

(Hector quietly places the handle back on the rack and nudges the broken blade towards the rack with his boot.)

**Lieutenant Hector (Whisper):** Sorry…

(Lin raises a hand and waves it up and down a few times. Signaling “it’s ok…”)

(The two proceed without further incident through the door and into a 12 meter long hallway that forks into a right and a left path. There are a couple doors on each side, but the two ignore them.)

(Once the two reach the fork, Hector turns to Lin and says-)

**Lieutenant Hector:** I’ll go right, you check left. There should be some other stairs around here.

**Junior AB Lin:** W-wait… Can we stay together?

**Lieutenant Hector:** Oh... Of course. C’mon, let’s both check the right first.

(Lin nods and the two both go down the right path.)

(Opening the first door on the left, Hector pans his flashlight around to see a lavish looking working space. An ornate desk, shelves, ink well, and some papers are on the desk.)

(Hector looks back out into the hall. Left… Then right…)

**Lieutenant Hector:** Where is everyone…? Think we’d at least here some of the other team walking around but, it’s quiet-

(Hector’s radio crackles to life… he pulls it out and talks into it.)

**Lieutenant Hector:** This is Hector, what’s up?                    

**Radio: (…static…)**

(Hector begins walking towards the next door quickly, still listening to the radio.)

(It’s still emitting static.)

**Lieutenant Hector:** Uh… Hello?

…

(Hector swings open the door. It’s another work space and there’s no more doors down this way.)

(The static stops.)

(Lin’s breathing is becoming audible, although still very quiet.)

…

(Hector’s camera spins around and is pointing his flashlight down the hall he just came from.)

(Lin follows suit after seeing Hector do it.)

**Lieutenant Hector:** Wait…

…

(There is the sound of footsteps in the distance. But this isn’t the sound of security or work boots. The footsteps sound metallic.)

(Hector pushes Lin’s flashlight down and lowers his own flashlight, as to not appear around the corner of the main hall that leads to the forking path. Hector slowly walks back towards the other, left fork in the path. Once they reach it-)

**Lieutenant Hector (whisper):** Hold up.

(Hector stops and looks around the corner without using his flashlight… ... There is the sound of the distant, metallic footsteps, but nothing is visible through the dark.)

**Lieutenant Hector (whisper):** C’mon, stay close to me.

(The two walk down the left fork now and Hector pushes a door on the right open. The room is empty except for 5 chairs all pointing towards the center.)

(Hector shudders slightly, closes the door firmly and quietly, and keeps walking to the next door. The sound of metallic footsteps can still be heard. The frequency of the steps getting faster at some points and slower at others.)

**Junior AB Lin (whisper):** H-Hector, wh-what is that?

**Lieutenant Hector (whisper):** Don’t know, just focus on finding a way out.

(Lin’s breathing is still quiet, but it sounds as though she is having a hard time keeping it quiet.)

(Opening the 2^(nd) door on the right, there is a collapsed staircase that leads down to the first floor. There is some dim, bluish light coming in from the right side; indicating the weather outside is still overcast. There is a pile of stone bricks at the bottom, likely the collapsed stairs.

**Junior AB Lin (whisper):** W-what do we do?

**Lieutenant Hector (whisper):** Hold on… I think…

(Hector is carefully scanning the walls of the collapsed stairwell.)

**Lieutenant Hector (whisper):** Yeah, there’s enough brick hanging off the walls. I can parkour this.

(Lin’s breathing becomes more audible.)

**Junior AB Lin (whisper):** Bu- Wh-what am I supposed to do?

**Lieutenant Hector (whisper):** It’s ok, I’m not leaving you here\~. Watch what I do and when I tell you to go, repeat my moves exactly, alright?

**Junior AB Lin (whisper):** I-I’ve never parkoured before though.

**Lieutenant Hector (whisper):** Trust me, you’ll be alright. Just gotta really throw yourself at it, ok? And if you slip, I’m down there to catch you. That’s why I’m going first.

(The metallic footsteps are getting slightly louder. Lin is shaking and crying is starting to become just barely audible from her.)

**Lieutenant Hector (whisper):** Hey hey, c’mon, it’s ok. Just do as I say and you’ll be alright.

**Junior AB Lin (whisper):** (Sniff) Ok.

**Lieutenant Hector (whisper):** That’s it. Now watch what I do.

(Hector turns to the collapsed stair well… Leaps to a large brick hanging out of the wall, drops down to one just below it, and leaps off one more time to a clear spot on the ground below.)

(Hector quickly looks up and positions himself under Lin.)

**Lieutenant Hector (loud whisper):** Ok, your turn. I’m RIGHT under you.

(Lin takes a deep breathe… … … and leaps across like Hector did, landing safely. Hector is quickly repositioning to stay right under Lin.)

**Lieutenant Hector (loud whisper):** Good girl, GOOD girl. This part’s easy, y’just drop to the brick below.

(Lin nods and looks down…)

**Lieutenant Hector (loud whisper):** Feel it out with one foot, then drop down with both feet together. Both feet need to land at the same time.

(Lin is leaning one foot over the edge, to line it up with the next drop…)

(A piece of the brick right underneath her foot breaks off and she falls with a sharp inhale.)

**Lieutenant Hector:** SPREAD!

(Lin quickly extends her arms and legs…)

(Hector catches her, bridal style, and his view suddenly shifts down.)

**Lieutenant Hector:** MMMPH.

(Hector’s view slowly raises back to his normal height. This was presumably Hector’s knees bending in order to help absorb the force of Lin’s fall and catch her.)

(To the right of Hector is a doorway leading to the main entrance, where the light is coming from.)

(Hector straightens Lin and slowly sets her on her feet.)

**Lieutenant Hector:** You alright?

(Hector keeps an arm close to Lin’s shoulder and looks up... The metallic footsteps are getting louder, but are still a ways off.)

**Junior AB Lin:** Huff… Y-yeah. Thank y- HECTOR!!!

(There is the sound of rapidly approaching footsteps and a shadow blocks what little light is in the room; it’s coming from the door on the right. Hector swings his head to the right, passing by a view of Lin pointing in the direction of what’s casting the shadow and keeps turning his head to see what is approaching.)

(One of the archeology team members is holding a bloody fire axe in one hand and rushing towards him with the axe raised over his head.)

(The archeologist in the hazmat suit brings the axe down towards Hector, but he pushes aside the arm holding the axe. Letting the momentum follow through, Hector grips the assailant’s arm with one hand, his chest with the other, and throws the assailant into the wall behind him.)

**Lieutenant Hector:** RRRAH!!!

(Lin can be seen quickly running behind Hector.)

(Hector draws his black pistol and locks it on the rogue archeologist, who is collapsed on the ground.)

**Lieutenant Hector:** FREEZE!!!

(The rogue archeologist gets back up, swiftly, axe raised. Hector fires a shot into the assailant’s head and 2 shots into the chest.)

(The archeologist is pushed back against the wall from the shots and drops to the floor, limp.)

(Hector looks back at Lin. She’s still on her feet but, is shaking again.)

(Hector looks back at the body… After the camera re-focuses, it becomes clear that the rogue archeologist has a large slash across his throat; blood leaking from the wound cakes the archeologist’s chest.)

**Lieutenant Hector:** What th…?

(The sound of metallic footsteps can be heard even closer now.)

(Hector shakes his head.)

**Lieutenant Hector:** C’mon Lin, we’re going.

(Hector quickly walks out the door that exits the stair well; it leads right to the main antechamber.)

(He looks around the corner, checking left and right. The field laptop and flood lights are still there, but there are no other archeologists.)

(There is the sound of ruffling clothes and Hector begins moving towards the main entrance hazard stairs. This was presumably Hector reaching his arm back and waving for Lin to follow.)

(The two enter the biohazard exclusion stairs and descend, exiting back onto the staging area. They begin walking towards the parked buggies; all 5 are still there.)

**Lieutenant Hector:** Wait… Lin, do you have any keys?

**Junior AB Lin:** N-no?

**Lieutenant Hector:** Uhh… Can you hotwire a car?

**Junior AB Lin:** I’m sorry, no…

**Lieutenant Hector:** No, it’s fine. I’m the one who’s supposed to know how to do stuff like that.

Ahhh… OH.

(Hector begins jogging to the buggies.)

**Lieutenant Hector:** There should be some spares in the buggies! Help me look!

(Hector runs to the closest buggie and jumps into the passenger seat.)

(He begins searching the glove box when he hears a frightened shout from Lin. He snaps up to look at Lin, who is halfway between his and the next buggie over. She’s looking at something on the ground, between the 2 buggies.)

(Hector climbs over to the left side drivers seat and looks down… to see Dr. Gram’s body. He has a large gash in between his neck and his shoulder. The cut goes well through the trapezius muscle, his collar bone, and into his chest. He’s lying on his back on the ground, and there is a large pool of blood around the wound.)

**Junior AB Lin:** No… No, no…

**Lieutenant Hector:** Lin, focus on finding the keys. Don’t look at it.

(Hector gets back to his searching… He searches the center console, glove box, cup holder, he gets on his knees on the seat and looks under the seat, under the floor mats… This searching continues for 30 seconds when-)

**Junior AB Lin:** Hector.

(Hector looks up to see Lin putting keys into her buggie’s ignition and turning the vehicle on.)

**Lieutenant Hector:** Well done, Lin\~.

(Hector gets up and jumps from his buggie, to the passenger seat of Lin’s buggie. As he is kneeling down to sit, someone’s right arm reaches across Hector’s neck and pulls him back.)

**Lieutenant Hector:** PFFFF-GH!

(Hector falls backwards out of the buggie and onto the ground, his view looking up at the overcast sky.)

**Junior AB Lin:** HECTOR!

(Hector raises his left arm up, then slams his elbow backwards, striking his assailant, and using his right hand to pry off the assailant’s hand. He continues to elbow his assailant.)

**Lieutenant Hector:** GHH! Rrrgh!

(From the left of Hector’s view, a hand wielding a survival knife comes down, stabbing Hector somewhere in his left side, around the ribs.)

**Lieutenant Hector:** Guhhh…!

(The knife raises up again for another strike on Hector, but he catches it with both of his hands and is holding the arm in place. The assailant’s right hand begins clawing at where Hector’s eyes would be on his gas mask.)

**Lieutenant Hector:** Nnnnngh!

(Hector’s view is shaking hard. His gas mask provides him protection from the clawing fingers, but this is likely him shaking his head to avoid getting his eye gouged should the mask come off.)

(Lin appears over Hector.)

**Lieutenant Hector:** Pull his hand off my face!

(Lin grabs the assailant’s right arm and pulls it with her whole body, only barely being able to get it off. Hector pries the assailant’s knife out of his left hand and quickly spins around. Hector sits on the assailant’s stomach and uses his left hand to pin the assailant’s left hand.)

(The assailant is Dr. Gram. His split open shoulder and collar bone injury becoming more exacerbated with the struggle. The grievous injury is not slowing his thrashing and struggling.)

**Lieutenant Hector:** WHAT?

(Hector thrusts the knife down, breaking the gas mask visor and plunging the knife into Dr. Gram’s left eye and into his brain.)

(The doctor seizes before going limp.)

**Lieutenant Hector:** Huff… Hufffff…

**Junior AB Lin:** H-Hector! Y- Are you ok? He…-

(Lin gestures around her chest.)

(Hector pats his chest.)

**Lieutenant Hector:** It’s ok… Huff… Body armor\~. Knife didn’t get through.

(Lin sighs with relief.)

**Junior AB Lin:** Thank goodness…

(Hector nods.)

**Lieutenant Hector:** C’mon, let’s go.

…

(Lin is looking at Dr. Gram’s body.)

**Lieutenant Hector:** Hey, I told you to stop looking at corpses. It’s not good for you.

**Junior AB Lin:** Right, sorry.

(Hector gets up and walks over the 2^(nd) buggie’s passenger seat and into the left side driver’s seat. Lin gets into the passenger seat, tucks her backpack between her legs on the floor, and buckles her seatbelt.)

(As they do this, the already overcast weather appears to suddenly become darker, prompting Hector to turn on his headlights. While not pitch black, visibility is that of a late evening night, despite the time in the footage reading **“11:03 AM”**.)

**Lieutenant Hector:** Ohhhhhhhhh balls.

(Hector shifts the car into drive.)

**Junior AB Lin: Hector.**

(Lin is pointing at the ruined structure… At the bottom of the biohazard stairs is a tall, dark figure, about 2.8m tall; barely visible against the dark. The camera doesn’t seem to be able to focus on the figure, but it appears to be vaguely humanoid in shape.)

(Hector peels off, turning right and away from the overgrown ruins and driving off towards a forest path.)

(As Hector’s headlights swing past the figure as he is turning right, the camera is still unable to focus on what the figure is, still appearing as a tall, dark, humanoid. Just before his view turns away from the figure, it appears to flicker a red light a few times from it’s “head.”)

**Lieutenant Hector:** GHH!

(Hector suddenly grabs the right side of his own neck with his right hand and holds it there. The vehicle swerves a little, but he regains control and continues to drive away.)

**Lieutenant Hector:** Augh…

(Hector pulls his right hand out to look at it. His palm is covered in blood. He goes back to holding his neck. There is the sound of a light, wet, pressing sound.)

**Lieutenant Hector:** MMMMmmmm…

**Junior AB Lin:** Hector, your neck!

(Hector drives into a forest path with many vehicle tracks. This was likely the way the archeology team came when they first drove in.)

**Lieutenant Hector:** It’s ok, it’s a shallow cut. That thing at the bottom of the stairs, whatever it did, it must’ve missed.

(Hector quickly looks over his shoulder behind him, then back to watch the road.)

**Junior AB Lin:** Ah- Hey, you’re gonna exacerbate the cut if you twist your neck around like that. Just tell me if you need to look behind you.

**Lieutenant Hector:** Yeah, you’re probably right.

(There is the sound of the glovebox opening on the right.)

**Lieutenant Hector:** Whatcha doin’ there?

**Junior AB Lin:** Gonna get a towel to wipe your neck and at LEAST apply some alcohol to the cut. This doesn’t need too steady a hand so, please keep driving.

**Lieutenant Hector:** It’s alright Lin, just a small cut-

**Junior AB Lin:** Alright NOTHING, you’re bleeding from the NECK. At least let me clean it, please…

(Hector nods.)

**Lieutenant Hector:** Okay.

(As Hector continues to drive, the lighting reverts to it’s previous overcast, daytime lighting.)

**Lieutenant Hector:** Oh.

(Hector looks up briefly, removes his hand from his neck, and looks to the right a little to see Lin pulling down his hazmat hood and exposing his neck. There is the sound of a dry towel wiping flesh.)

**Junior AB Lin:** Alright, this is gonna sting.

(Hector is looking at the road, but the view shudders to the left slightly. This was presumably Lin applying an alcohol wipe and Hector flinching away from the pain.)

**Junior AB Lin:** I’m sorry, hold still please.

…

(Hector looks to the right a little again, Lin is reaching for his neck with a roll of gauze now.)

(Lin’s right hand can be seen passing the lower part of Hector’s view a few times, as she wraps the gauze around his neck.)

**Junior AB Lin:** (Sigh) Done… Better, right?

(Hector runs his right hand along the gauze around his neck.)

**Lieutenant Hector:** Thanks, Lin…

**Junior AB Lin:** Pfft, I should be thanking YOU. You took on 2 guys back there.

**Lieutenant Hector:** Hmhmh…

(Hector raises his hand to head height then balls it into a fist.)

**Junior AB Lin:** But, I still don’t get how Dr. Gram was able to attack us… I don’t even think that was him. The amount of blood he’d lost when we found him, his chest wound… He was dead, he HAD to have been. You don’t just get back up after you’ve lost over a liter of blood and still bleeding.

(Hector nods a few times.)

**Lieutenant Hector:** We should report this to Chief Grove and Captain Suyf.

**Junior AB Lin:** Yeah.

(Hector pulls out his radio, presses a few buttons, and waits…)

**Chief Grove (radio):** This is Grove, you’re on the emergency line.

**Lieutenant Hector:** Grove, it’s me, Hector. Security code, \[REDACTED FOR SECURITY PURPOSES.\] We’ve got an emergency.

**Chief Grove (radio):** What’s happened?

**Lieutenant Hector:** The archeology team at dig site A, we were attacked by something. We’ve got 2 confirmed killed, 9 missing, with only myself and Lin escaping.

**Chief Grove (radio):** What attacked you?

**Lieutenant Hector:** … The first hostile I made contact with was one of the archeologists, came at me and Lin with an axe. I don’t think he was a traitor though. His neck had been slit open and his whole chest covered in his own blood… He was moving way too fast for someone who’d had his neck cut and had presumably been bleeding for a while. He should’ve been dead from that wound.

**Chief Grove (radio):** Are you telling me a… zombie attacked you?

(Chief Grove’s voice indicates he is asking this sincerely.)

**Lieutenant Hector:** Maybe… There was something else too, some tall guy, definitely not part of the team. Couldn’t get a good look at him. I’ve got my head mounted camera to prove it. Had it on the whole time.

**Chief Grove (radio):** I believe you but, yeah, some video evidence would be helpful.

**Lieutenant Hector:** There were other things in those ruins, too. Feels like Lin and I escaped without seeing the worst of it… Chief, I recommend putting the Forager and Colony base security on high alert. I’ll be reporting to Captain Suyf when I return.

**Chief Grove (radio):** Agreed, I’ll let the Captain know there’s something urgent he needs to see on the lower floor meeting room. The one near the cafeteria, we’ll meet you there.

**Lieutenant Hector:** Alright, we’re on our way.

**Chief Grove (radio):** Wait, where are you now?

**Lieutenant Hector:** Driving back to the Forager. We’re well away from the dig site.

**Chief Grove (radio):** Good man. Get home safe… Over and out.

**Lieutenant Hector:** Yes, Chief.

(Hector hangs up the radio.)

…

**Junior AB Lin:** I’m surprised he believed you so readily.

**Lieutenant Hector:** Grove and I have known each other for about 15 years. If it was someone else, he’d have probably assumed it was a dumb prank. But, he knows when I’m being serious.

**Junior AB Lin:** I see…

(Recording cuts.)
