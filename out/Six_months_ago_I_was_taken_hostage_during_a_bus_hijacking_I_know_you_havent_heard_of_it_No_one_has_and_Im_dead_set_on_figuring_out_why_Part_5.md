Within the darkness, Alma’s hand cradled the back of my skull and gracefully lowered my head onto a pillow. I was able to do the rest. I brought my legs up, shifted my torso, and laid my aching calves on to what I assumed was a mattress.

My breathing calmed. My heartbeat slowed. Alma draped a blanket over me.

*“Goodnight, Elena. Don’t get up. I’ll come get you when it’s time.”*

I didn’t hear her walk away, but it felt like she had. I can’t tell you why.

I thought about reaching out from under the blanket, over the side of the mattress, and down to the floor.

*Would it feel like stone or like a tongue?* I contemplated.

Ultimately, I decided against it, and I closed my eyes. At least, I think I did. It was hard to tell for sure, because my vision didn’t change. In the embrace of a perfect darkness, is there even a difference between having your eyes open or closed?

The last thought I had before I drifted off into a dreamless sleep was an important one.

*Alma hadn’t called me Meghan. She didn’t use my alias.*

*She called me Elena.*

*Alma knew I wasn’t who I claimed to be.*

*If that was even Alma at all.*

*It could have been Alma, or someone pretending to be Alma, or no one at all. An illusion created by a broken mind.*

*In the embrace of a perfect darkness, did it even matter?*

It sort of goes without saying, but I’d never been resurrected before entering that chapel. Regardless, what I experienced waking up in the black catacombs was pretty damn close to being reborn, I’d imagine.

Sound returned first, humble scraps of noise fluttering around my dormant body: wisps of conversations, quiet shuffling of feet, distant clattering of pots and pans. A swirling symphony of the mundane. It reminded me of sleeping in late on Christmas morning at my parent’s house, eventually stirring to the sounds of activity by family members who hadn’t gotten blisteringly drunk the night before.

My eyes felt exceptionally dry as their lids creaked open. Two wrinkled grapes drained of moisture. Although initially blurry, my vision quickly sharpened.

My mind was the last system to reboot. When I came to, I was staring at a ceiling fan attached to a white spackled ceiling, my absent gaze tracking the blades endlessly revolve.

Conscious thought came back in dribs and drabs. Disconnected insights swam unassumingly through my mind until their gradual accumulation jolted me back to reality.

*I’m so groggy.*

*That isn’t my ceiling fan. This isn’t my bedroom ceiling. I recognize them, but from where?*

*Where’s Nia?*

*More to the point, where am I?*

*What was I doing before I fell asleep?*

The stained-glass mosaic of Jeremiah and his thousand mutated children flashed through my head like the burst of light that heralds the explosion of a hydrogen bomb.

I sprang up, my heart slamming against the back of my throat. A sharp, stabbing pain resonated through my right hand. I brought the throbbing extremity to my face. By the looks of it, someone had attended to my battered knuckles while I was out cold, first and middle finger wrapped in thick layers of white gauze. I spun my head around and examined my surroundings. Ultimately, I had a hard time comprehending what I was seeing.

Somehow, I'd woken up in my old office, back when I was a salaried journalist. Same lazy ceiling fan that failed to keep me cool during the summer, same shit spackling job that had resulted in tiny flakes of drywall seasoning my lunchtime meals for years on end.

But, of course, that couldn’t be true.

Six months earlier, my boss had fired me from that long-held position for pushing to get my op-ed on the bus hijacking published. Not only that, but I sure as shit didn’t have some random box spring mattress awkwardly positioned in the middle of my office. My career was all-consuming, yes, but even I drew the line at sleeping over at the tribune.

Upright in the bed, I found myself oriented toward the exterior wall, where a small window offered an elevated view of Tucson’s city center, though it didn’t look quite right. It took me a moment to ascertain *exactly* what was amiss, other than the devastatingly obvious, but as my eyes drifted beneath the window, down onto the navy-colored carpet below, the alarming peculiarity became more evident.

The sun was shining high in the sky. I could see it. And yet, there was no shadow on the floor from the vinyl windowpane.

I twisted my body and swung my legs off of the mattress. Tingles of potent nostalgia electrified the soles of my bare feet as they touched down on the rough fabric, a sensation so familiar that it seemed to course with static energy. Weak, wobbly-legged, and still abnormally groggy, I stood up and continued to inspect the room.

No desk. None of my diplomas on the walls. No humming mini-fridge that I’d fought tooth-and-nail to get installed. Just another lonely looking cot a few feet away from the one I’d woken up in, with the only difference being that it was neatly made and person-less.

Even the door was identical to my old office, with its familiar smooth oaken finish and rusty metal hinges, but the person standing in the ajar doorway was not familiar. Recognizable, but not familiar.

*“Glad to see you up and acclimating to the catacombs, Sister Elena. Or would you still prefer to go by Meghan?”* The Monsignor purred, apparently unbothered by the poor attempt at concealing my identity.

At that point, I’d interacted with two (for lack of a better word) *versions* of the Monsignor. The younger version, with his dark brown eyes and hair bathed in the scarlet light radiating from the stained glass, and the older version, a liver-spotted husk who had let me leave the chapel to smoke, nearly being killed by Eileithyia a few minutes later. Right then, I was facing the younger of the two versions.

I racked my brain. Tried to come up with something pithy to say, or at least a good question to ask.

*Nothing* came to mind. I was critically, inexorably overwhelmed.

I mean, where would I even start? The Monsignor’s shifting age? Or Eileithyia and her reproducing shadows outside the chapel, inflicting me with the smallest flicker of Godhood? My abrupt withdrawal from said Godhood, provoking me to mangle my knuckles against the lobby's stubborn tile floor? Jeremiah? Apollo and his ticking device? Nia’s voice in the darkness? My infinite-feeling pilgrimage through the darkness that directly led up to that moment? Or maybe the fact that it appeared like I was in my old office, for fuck’s sake?

My nervous system short-circuited. I stood in front of the man, motionless, slack-jawed, and broken.

To my surprise, some small words did manage to find their way over my lips to form a question, although it was hardly the most pertinent inquiry, and it certainly didn’t address the fact that he knew about my alias.

Still, it was a start.

*“Why the hell does this place look like my old office?”* I slurred.

The Monsignor chuckled.

*“Your old office? Is that so? Well, that’s a new one.”*

I stared at him, dumbfounded.

He saw my confusion and smiled, adopting a mischievous glint behind his eyes. It was the grin of a magician, savoring bewilderment while being acutely aware of how the trick worked.

Eventually, he tired of my confusion and beckoned me forward, extending an open palm, encouraging me to take his hand.

For some reason, *that’s* the behavior that really bothered me.

I pawed his hand away.

*“Just show me what you want to show me, man,”* I said with resignation.

He put both arms up in a mock “*don’t shoot me”* pose and tilted his body in the doorway so I could walk through.

When I exited my office at the tribune, I’d arrive in the so-called bullpen, a large, central space that housed an aggregate of cubicles belonging to the less experienced journalists. That was *sort of* what I encountered when I stepped forward, past a still smiling Monsignor.

Compared to my office, though, the bullpen was more obviously fake.

The dimensions were *way* off. The bullpen was a fairly expansive, open room, sure, but this place was downright cavernous: football field sized with a vaulted ceiling thirty feet above the floor. At the same time, it did *look* like the bullpen, with its unmistakably drab beige walls and dark blue carpet. It was as if my memory of the room was superimposed onto a blank canvas. The surface was, at its core, identical to how I remembered the bullpen, but it had been stretched and contorted to fit over this new set of proportions.

The cubicles were notably absent from this reinterpretation, as well. Instead, there was a massive wooden table, something you’d only associate with a medieval banquet hall, covered in ochre-colored sigils, swirls and markings from some character-based written language I did not recognize. A crowd of people were setting the table for a meal, but I couldn’t see their details. They were faceless, unclothed, skin-toned blurs molded into vaguely human shapes. Their frames shifted as I observed them. Taller, then shorter. Wider, then narrower. Semi-solid, ameboid constructs buzzing across the room like worker bees, laughing and chatting through mouths I couldn’t appreciate.

*“You must have really adored your work, Elena,”* he whispered as I stepped out into the mirage.

*“Well…I…”* my voice trailed off.

*“Let me provide you with some clarity, dear girl.”*

The Monsignor paced into view.

*“I’m confident that you’re smart enough to have already figured this out, but you are not currently in your old office.”*

*“Oh, huh, you don’t say…”* I replied flatly, tone laced with acrid sarcasm. The circumstances I found myself in had become so utterly insane that some of my existential terror had melted into black-hearted amusement. I was miles and miles out of my depth and completely stripped of control - might as well laugh about it.

He ignored my comment and continued.

*“You’re still in the lightless catacombs under the cathedral. Objectively, we have all been swallowed by its darkness. What you’re witnessing now is a self-imposed illusion. Your mind is seeing without your eyes. You’ve digested the catacombs and made them navigable through the memory of something comfortable, familiar. That said, I certainly don't see your office. We all visualize this space differently. And yet, paradoxically, we are all* ***seeing*** *the same thing.”*

His voice swelled, gaining bravado and momentum.

*“That’s the singular beauty of this sanctuary, dear girl. Think of Jeremiah: his cyclopean and cataracted eye, his placental maw. He was blind, and yet he could see farther and with more clarity than any other man in history. He couldn’t consume, and yet he carried unfathomable powers of creation, effortlessly imprinting his wayward miracle on the landscape with divine abandon.”*

The blurry figures had ceased their buzzing. From what I could discern, they were all transfixed on the Monsignor and his proselytizing. On the opposite side of the table, my eyes briefly drifted to someone who wasn’t featureless like the rest of the drones: a woman with two sad hazel eyes behind a pair of newly repaired glasses.

Alma.

*“In these catacombs, Elena, we are all saints. Blessed fixtures dilating our Godhood, honing our birthright. You will bear witness to a tiny sliver of His grace. Sister Alma, through her devotion, has been deemed worthy. After tonight's sessions, I will take her even deeper below the Chapel. She will be allowed to embrace the cherub seed.”*

“*Her barren womb will be adorned with Jeremiah’s wayward miracle, and she will give birth to twins in less than three days’ time.”*

The faceless crowd applauded the announcement, but no sound came from their clapping.

A fitting allegory for the situation at hand.

Silent praise for a hollow miracle,

A pyrrhic victory for a fruitless womb.
