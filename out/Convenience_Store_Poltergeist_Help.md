I work at a chain convenience store that you're most likely familiar with, but I'll save the name for reasons of not doxxing myself.  For the first while I was working there, the first month or three, everything was absolutely normal, but obviously I wouldn't be coming to you guys for advice if it stayed that way.  The first thing I can think of that happened was probably the most frightening, and everything that happened since hasn't been quite so alarming but it has been happening with greater frequency, so, really, any help at all is appreciated.

So, it started when I was alone (of course) and working the afternoon shift.  My manager had left, my help had left, and it was a solid two or three hours before the next person came in to relieve me.  I was bored as Hell, so I began to whistle.  Probably Drunken Sailors, as it's usually what I whistle when I'm bored, but on this occasion I heard a gruff male voice like a rusty grate snap at me to "quit whistlin'" and I freaked out.  The light in the backroom was off (it's motion activated) so I knew no one was back there, and I took about three trips down each aisle and even into the cooler to satisfy my need to know that no one was there.  The doorbell never went off, so I know no one ever came in or left at any point, and I was quite alarmed, but I finished out my shift as I was reasonably sure that as long as I stayed behind the counter where customers could come in and see me I'd be fine.  

Now, since then, and leading up to this next event, I would hear the swinging lid of the trash can by the counter start creaking whenever I was away from it for a certain amount of time.  Again, a little unnerving, but not even really inconvenient once I got used to it.  I learned not to whistle pretty quickly, so that wasn't much of an issue.  One day, while I had my manager and another coworker there with me, maybe a month or two ago, I heard some banging around in the back room, as if someone was moving around some drink bibs.  My coworker was too old and frail to move them, so I assumed it was my manager, and didn't think of it until I saw him going in and out of the cooler.  I started saying something to my coworker, just to be certain, but she brushed it off as rats.  If it weren't for the fact that these drink bibs were a couple gallons heavy, and it didn't sound like someone was lifting and dropping them, I might have brushed it off as well, but I dropped it so I didn't sound crazy.  

Most recently, it has resorted to an act of sabotage.  I was on my own, and it was about nine in the morning, maybe just a little earlier, when I saw a shadow pass the store window from the corner of my eye.  I turned to look, and there was no one there despite that it was coming towards the door to come in.  Odd, but I get up pretty early for work so I brushed it off as just being tired for a few minutes until I realized the receipt machine had been switched off, and that even after turning it back on it was not working properly.  It turns out that the roll of paper inside of it had been rolled neatly back up, and flipped to face the opposite way.  In between the last time a receipt printed and this happened, shadow and all, I had not left the counter once.  I wasn't frightened, again, more mildly annoyed, so I called it something I can't politely type out here and resumed my work.

I know many of you are going to suggest carbon monoxide poisoning, or even coÂ² poisoning, as that is a hazard in my line of work, but I am way ahead of you.  We have a working (assumedly, anyways, because you know how corporate loves to cut costs at employee expense) detector, and it did save my life before in a case of my coworkers being negligent.  It didn't go off, but I was able to notice that the numbers were way too high and acted accordingly to avert crisis.  I keep watch on that machine like a hawk, now, and despite that these events are becoming more and more frequent (it's mostly the swinging lid, which, again, is more annoying than anything) the levels have been safe.  

I guess what I'm trying to get at is that I can show all the bravado I please to, but I can't help but feel it is a bit misguided.  I don't know how to handle ghosts, but I believe in them, and I firmly believe that something supernatural is happening here.  It has been getting progressively less frightening, but is that something I should be frightened of in it's own right?  How do I deal with this?  Is there any way that I can?  Thanks in advance for your help, guys, and I hope I can get some good answers before something happens that does get out of hand.
