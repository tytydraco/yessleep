It started about three months ago. My daughter, Lily, had just turned four and had developed the habit of talking to someone when she was alone in her room. At first, I thought nothing of it. Every kid has an imaginary friend, right? I assumed it was just part of her growing imagination.

She called him **Milo.**

Milo, according to her, was a “nice man” who sat by the window and told her funny stories. It was harmless. Until it wasn’t.

# The First Red Flag

One night, while tucking her into bed, she looked up at me with those big, innocent eyes and whispered:

**“Milo says you shouldn’t lock the front door. He can’t come inside if you do.”**

I blinked, caught off guard. “Why does Milo want to come inside?”

She just giggled and shrugged. **“He likes watching us sleep.”**

That one sent a chill down my spine, but I laughed it off. Kids say creepy things all the time, don’t they? It was just her overactive imagination. But that night, for the first time in years, I double-checked every lock before going to bed.

I didn’t sleep well.

# The Whispering in the Walls

A few days later, I overheard her talking to Milo again. Only this time, her voice was hushed, like she didn’t want me to hear. I leaned against the doorway and listened.

**“No, I can’t. Mommy would get mad.”**  
(Pause)  
**“Because she says I have to stay inside at night.”**  
(Pause)  
**“Okay, but only for a little bit.”**

That got my attention. I stepped into the room and asked, “Lily, who are you talking to?”

She looked startled, as if she had forgotten I existed for a moment. “Milo,” she said quietly.

I forced a smile. “What did Milo say?”

She fidgeted with the hem of her blanket and murmured, **“He wants me to open my window at night so he can talk to me better.”**

I felt a lump in my throat. “Lily, you can’t open your window at night. It’s dangerous.”

She pouted but nodded. “I told him that, too.”

I kissed her forehead, turned off the lights, and left the room. But something felt **wrong**.

That night, I put a chair under the doorknob of the front door before I went to sleep. Just in case.

# Footsteps in the Snow

Then, two nights ago, it escalated.

I woke up around 2 AM to a **soft tapping sound.** It was rhythmic, light, almost like fingernails drumming against wood. I sat up, listening.

And then, from the darkness beside me, Lily whispered, **“Mommy… Milo’s mad at you.”**

My blood turned ice cold. “Why, baby?”

She didn’t answer.

I got out of bed and turned on the hallway light. She was standing there, barefoot in her nightgown, her eyes wide.

**“He told me to tell you to check the front porch.”**

Every part of me screamed *DON’T DO IT*, but I forced myself to move forward. I turned on the porch light, hesitated, then unlocked the door and peeked outside.

The first thing I saw was **footprints.**

They led from the woods behind our house **directly to our front door.**

But here’s the thing—there were **no footprints leading away.**

Whoever—or whatever—made them **never left.**

# The Window Was Unlocked

I slammed the door shut and locked it again, my heart pounding in my ears. When I turned back, Lily was already walking toward her room, as if nothing was wrong.

I followed her.

And that’s when I noticed her **bedroom window was open.**

The locks were still in place, but the window was slightly ajar. Just enough for someone—or something—to whisper through.

I checked every corner of the room, every inch of the closet, under the bed. Nothing. But I couldn’t shake the feeling that something had been there.

Or worse.

**Something was still watching.**

# Milo is Patient

Last night, I didn’t sleep at all. I kept every light in the house on and made sure every door and window was locked. Lily didn’t seem fazed at all.

Before she went to bed, she turned to me and said, **“Milo is patient.”**

I don’t know what that means. But I know one thing for sure.

I’m never leaving Lily alone in her room again.
