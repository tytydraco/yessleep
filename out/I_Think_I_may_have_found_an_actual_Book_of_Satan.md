For Starters, I’m not talking about the satanic Bible or anything written by humans, I’m a goth atheist and in the past even experimented in laveyan satanism. I met a girl about two weeks ago, she was pretty, messy dark hair, pale skin, makeup, goth like me and had a punk look to her. She introduced herself as Kaiya and we had met at my job. We hit it off quickly and agreed to go on a date, everything went well but after being intimate for the first time. Kaiya confessed she just wanted a more friends with benefits style relationship which I accepted despite some disappointment as I liked her. Kaiya was a little odd at times, she would respond immediately to texts or not for hours, she didn’t like eating in public and seemed to always want to do something that would stir up drama. Of course, these things are pretty normal and I just thought she was kinda quirky, but I then realized a few things about Kaiya, I had never seen her eat outside of snacks, her tattoos always seemed slightly off as in they seemed different each time, and would always avoid people in public. It was disturbing but it was conceivable that she was just antisocial and had a eating disorder or something, I called her a couple times but she never answered and I was about to call the cops when texted me this 

“Don’t stop being a wolf, you’ll find it under the tree with two crows nest in the graveyard. I’m sorry, you’ll never see me again, I know you love my horns.”


She stopped responding after that.

I went to the graveyard and found two trees that matched the description but only one had clear signs of being dug up, so I dug some and found a wooden box. Inside the box, were three things. A vial of blood, a bottle of vodka, and a locked diary with a three digit combination lock. On the Cover of the book was Hail The Devil, written in Swedish. I was creeped out and still trying to reach Kaiya, but nothing too scary yet, I tried to pry the lock off but I couldn’t and then something really freaky happened. I hadn’t been paying attention to the tree and when I realized it had a grave on the other side of it, I checked the grave because I felt guilty about disturbing the dead and what I saw was haunting. The grave was old and weathered, it had what looked like a deer skull lying in front of it. Before I could really see anything, a baby crow fell out of the tree and hit the ground hard in front of the grave, its neck snapped.

Which is when I saw that the grave’s name was Kaiya Smith, born 1876, died 1912. Which is when the second baby crow fell to its death. 

I brought the box home and I’m freaked out, It’s been a day and I haven’t been able to get the lock off the notebook. I’m honestly starting to wonder if Kaiya was some sort of demon or ghost or something. All I know is that I’ve been looking for answers or some sign of Kaiya and theirs nothing. I’ll keep updating if I manage to get the lock off.
