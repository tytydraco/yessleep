This is my comeuppance for not heeding the warnings of the books. I can feel myself starting to pass out. Even thought the room is filled with lights and the blinds are closed, I’m not making the night. There are Legit minutes where I go blind from the lack of sleep.


I die tonight. It will not be gentle nor will it be quick. I will suffer endlessly. I just hope that no one does the same as me.
