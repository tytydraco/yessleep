In 2023, while on a spring break vacation with her friends and boyfriend in Punta Cana, my sister, Bianca, went missing the day before their flight home. The prior night was spent slamming tequila-and-lime shots at a tiki bar before their friend, Craig, took the stage to serenade his girlfriend, Kiara, with slurred karaoke at 2:05 am. At 2:07 am, her boyfriend, Theo, wandered off to take a piss, with Bianca supposedly following him seconds after.

2:10 am— Theo returns, Bianca does not, and her lack of presence is claimed not to have been noticed by others until 2:26, before she’s finally reported missing at 3:04 am. When the news reached my smallish town, the gossip spread like an infection. News vans camped outside of our house, and drinks were dumped on us by deranged conspiracy theorists.

My family was cracking under the weight, and the final straw was when one morning, our mailbox was overflowing with letters— ranging from supposed ransom notes claiming to be Bianca’s captor and asking for thousands of dollars, to sexual fantasies that churned my stomach to even recall.

This girl, who would braid my hair by the pool before pushing me in and buying me liquor with her fake ID for sleepovers, was not only gone but being smeared into fodder of every form. Even if we shut our doors and boarded our windows, it invaded every crevice of our lives as the police search drew longer and closer to failure.

After the influx to our mailbox, my parents were on the brink of listing the house for sale, but I refused. Her height was still marked in crayon across the doorframe; her room stood still, as if it were a world of its own that had ceased to spin. Memories weren’t enough; it was like clawing at smoke.

Through thunderous screaming matches, we finally reached an agreement. I was financially stable and old enough to live in the house, but my parents couldn’t bear to live in the same state anymore, mind that home. A month later, there were now two empty bedrooms, and every hall had never been quieter, yet my brain had never been louder.

While my parents moved on in Florida, I rotted in Massachusetts, obsessed with my sister's case and the undeniable nonsense of it. Most of the info I’d obtained about the case wasn’t even from the police, but from the forums of the same people who were besmirching her and our family’s name.

Her disappearance was plucked apart and dissected by a handful of true crime subreddits, some even dedicated to her entirely. Hundreds of complete strangers spent their time theorizing, analyzing security footage, and arguing about witness testimonies while pointing the finger at who they claim is the “killer,” as if our lives and the one she lost were some round of Clue.

Yet, with confliction yet irresistible determination, I found myself as one of those people, gradually feeling like a stranger as well. The voyeurs prying into our lives and the case had more information and stronger possible conclusions than the police did.

Through seemingly illegal tactics, users had obtained security footage from their night at the tiki bar. I’d scrubbed through every pixel of the grainy black-and-white video that captured her final moments. Her arm around Theo as Craig serenades the small crowd, she leans close to his ear and whispers something. His back stiffens under her before he stumbles off to pee.

Facing away from the camera with her thin, chestnut hair curtaining her profile, she followed behind him. When I first came across the video, my fourth glass of wine in hand, I’d rewound that moment over and over— her walking out of frame, walking out of our lives, never to return. And when Theo returns alone, he has a full drink in hand.

*What could’ve possibly happened in 3 minutes? What is someone capable of in that time?*

Toward the end of the footage, as the bar empties, the trio containing Theo, Craig, and his girlfriend Kiara huddle at a table. Their conversation is unintelligible, as the footage is void of audio, but their expressions appeared serious and afraid, as if something was looming over their shoulders.

Eventually, they leave, and the video dissolves to static. When it was posted, the subreddit ignited with theories and baseless accusations like, “Theo’s been cheating on her with Kiara, but they couldn’t be together till she was out of the picture for good. Tale as old as time.”

All this talk around her friends had me wondering where they’d been since the media frenzy around her disappearance, so I began a deep dive. Craig had remained on social media with minimal posts and private accounts that he still allowed me access to; from what I could infer, he and Kiara had broken up.

Speaking of Kiara— I was met with a brick wall upon searching for her socials while logged into my accounts, as I was blocked on every single one possible. The last time I’d seen Kiara was in a mall food court, after she’d gone MIA for nearly three months after Bianca’s disappearance. It was a moment of fate equivalent to hot and cold air dancing in the right place at the right time to form a tornado.

To put it simply, I caused a scene. I just wanted answers, and she was one of the only three people who could possibly have any. After drawing the attention of everyone across the mall, she’d attempted to disengage when I grabbed her wrist and asked her why it took till 3 am to call the police, prompting her to backhand me. Then, she said she’d “drown” me if I ever attempted contact again.

So, it wasn’t much of a surprise to see I’d been blocked as far as Venmo, but I wasn’t able to settle on stopping there. After recalling a wine-and-charcuterie night where Bianca had passingly mentioned she “uses the same password for everything, ‘cause who has the brain capacity to remember them all,” I managed to access her social media accounts.

“Remembering” was permanently etched above her Instagram handle, a digital gravestone; it was always surreal to see. Through her profile, I navigated to Kiara’s, which only had two old photos of her, with every picture of her and Bianca wiped away. I could understand how the pressure of all the attention got to them; it tore my family apart, but how could anyone just act like she never existed? Like she didn’t matter, and still does?

People are supposed to live on in other ways after they die, yet it felt like the world was trying to massacre every facet of her existence— her memory, her identity, her reputation. Even the version of her in my heart felt tainted and distorted; rotting like the body we didn’t even get the grace of burying.

In my internet perusing, I finally pried into Theo, who— prior to their trip in 2023— had no further online presence. No social media accounts, no work profiles, no criminal record, no obituary, nothing. I even dumped a White Pages subscription onto a credit card, only to be met with 54-year-old men in Kansas who had the same name. He could’ve been out of the country for all I knew. But who runs so far unless something’s chasing them?

Eventually, my investigations began to circle in a numbing loop. I was gaining zero new information, yet I was unable to stop dissecting what I’d had. I’d watch the security footage like it was a home video, hallucinating her face in the dark, returning into frame before dissolving to static. She was my own sister, yet I felt no different than the parasitic internet sleuths I’d despised.

One night, while on the subreddit for her case, I filtered the posts by “new,” and something posted twelve minutes prior had caught my eye.

“Is this some kind of AI or DeepFake? I don’t have the funds to subscribe, but it sure looks like her.”

I expanded the post, and the thumbnail of an attached OnlyFans link filled my screen. The closest I could describe the feeling of seeing the girl was “uncanny valley.” It was Bianca— every thread of her blue eyes, every acne scar from high school, her two bottom-front teeth curving in when she smiled— it was her. 

But instead of her wavy maple hair, ginger curls sprouted from her head, and from what I could see of her torso, she was wearing a neon pink sports tank top.

*She… hated anything neon; said it made you look like a Sharpie. And she was about as athletic as a sloth… Is this some kind of sick joke?*

Curiosity practically magnetized my face to the monitor as I clicked the link. “@BendWithBianca” was the account's username, next to a small profile picture of the photo I’d seen prior.

“Professional exercise instructor. Videos include yoga, weightlifting, pilates, and more! Until the 21st, get 33% off a 3-month subscription!”

*Did she… run off? Start a new life?*

I didn’t know how to make sense of what I was seeing. On the account, there was only one post so far, and it was locked behind the twenty-dollars-a-month paywall. Gnawing at my lip till it bled, I hesitantly yet eagerly made an account and paid for a subscription. Once the charge went through, the blurred video revealed itself, the thumbnail depicting her in a pin-straight tree pose in Lululemon leggings.

The mouse hovering over the play button, my fingers trembled against the trackpad.

*This could all just be one big coincidence… Grief does weird things to the brain.*

With a tight chest, I pressed play.

“Hey, guys, gals, and all kinds of pals! Welcome back to another week of Bend with Bianca!”

My blood was slow, jagged ice in my veins. Anybody can resemble someone, but that was her voice. The slight rasp she got from our mother that’d exacerbate when she was sick or sleepy. The voice that whispered secrets in pillow forts, and called me a bitch when I borrowed her clothes was now teaching me how to properly perform a downward dog with a tinge of a valley girl accent.

Buffering through every frame, nothing appeared out of the ordinary, aside from the obvious. On a navy blue mat in a sterile grey room, she displayed multiple yoga poses. Something about the extreme cleanliness was more unnerving than if she were in a rusted cage. Then, at the end of the video, she was face-to-face with the camera again, sweat glistening on her skin.

“Hope you guys enjoyed, learned something new, or improved on what you already knew! See you next time!”

With a numb stare of confusion, the sounds of my slow, wheezy breaths filled my ears before I replayed the video again. And again. And again.

Every time her eyes met the lens, goosebumps sprouted across my skin; it felt like she could actually see me. After a dozen viewings, I circled back to the Reddit post that led me to the video. Comments had already flooded in, so many two cents thrown in I could’ve bought a Mercedes.

“Another scam artist. Pfft. All Gen Z’ers want is attention.”

“No way it’s real. I’ve got a bridge to sell you guys.”

“Idk man. Looks pretty legit to me. Is this some kind of trafficking? Selling incognito snuff? Yadda yadda rule 34 yadda yadda.”

“Whatever. I’ll just wait for the leak.”

It boiled my blood watching people so confidently speak on someone they’ve never met and mean nothing to them outside of parasocial entertainment. But the other half of me was grateful that they’d even brought this account to my attention in the first place; it was an exhausting push-and-pull.

After taking two ibuprofen with a swig of wine to tame my headache, I screen-recorded the video and posted it onto the subreddit for everyone to chime in. Chomping my nails to the skin, I barely blinked as I waited for replies to roll in.

“Not her, she wasn’t that fat lol.”

“Certified girl here— that is definitely not a wig, unless her lace is invisible.”

“AI can do anything nowadays. Probably just someone trying to get a quick buck.”

“Thank you for being the idiot to take one for the team and pay for this.”

I stepped away from the computer with a frustrated sigh. I don’t know why I expected internet strangers to be kind or helpful. I was spiraling into desperation. After a nearly sleepless night, my eyes shot open at the blaring of my 7 am alarm. Hunched at my desk, I did my job remotely, which I was granted after Bianca’s disappearance. The routine became cozy and offered me more free time, so I never returned in person.

While formatting an email to a colleague, my computer chirped with a Reddit notification. Instantly sidelining my work task, I navigated to the subreddit to check out the new post.

“New Bianca OF video. I guess she’s rebranding.”

The link attached displayed an up-close photo of Bianca, her chin tipped downward as she stared piercingly into the camera with a foam mic at her lips. Her hair was raven black and slicked into a tight ponytail. The room was dim, except for two warm, multicolored lamps that paralleled both sides of her. When I clicked the link, it led me to a new account— “@BiancaBedtimeASMR.”

“Can’t sleep? Bad insomnia? Come unwind with me.”

*What the… ?*

Like last time, there was one video, locked behind a thirty-dollar paywall this time. Flinching as I nibbled my raw lip, I paid the fee to access the new account. Doing so unlocked the video titled “Itchy at the Dentist — Roleplay ASMR.”

In the thumbnail, she adorned a dentist's scrubs while smirking with a spurting numbing needle in her raised grip. Behind her was a fully decked-out dentist's office, fittingly pearly white with a sea blue chair at its center. Too deep down the rabbit hole to crawl out, I held my breath and clicked play.

“Hello, hello, hello…” Her velvety whispers circled the microphone.

“Do you have an appointment with us today?” She enunciated the word, hissing delicately into the mic.

Nothing stuck out to me in the first half of the video, although seeing her as the subject of an ASMR video felt ironic, as I’d recalled her mentioning that she found them “grating.” As she scraped the sides of the camera with a curette, I noticed her continuously shifting her jaw, her brows furrowing with discomfort before swiftly loosening.

For four minutes of the twenty-six-minute video, this persisted, till she suddenly dropped her hand with a frustrated heft.

“Sorry, guys, I just…” Her tone broke character, but her volume didn’t. “I have this… this weird itch.”

Then, she slipped her pointer finger under her upper lip, grazing it across her gum, the microphone picking up every slosh. Eventually, she rested her fingertip on her front teeth before pressing her thumb on the back of the tooth. 

“One moment… I could just edit this out.”

With a squelchy crunch, she pierced her nails into her gum line, blood oozing as she attempted to hook into the tooth. My eyes bulged but remained attentive as I watched her nonchalantly shimmy the tooth out of its socket. Once it was out, it dangled from stringy flesh and nerve endings, blood pooling around her tongue.

“C’mon, don’t put up a fuss…” She yanked the tooth, snapping every pulpy binding with ease as if it were a tag off a shirt.

As my gut churned with horror, she placed the tooth down somewhere off-camera before lowering her jaw and ramming her hooked finger into the gushy scarlet crater before digging around as if she were searching for gold.

“Ahhh, that’s the stuff…” Her eyes rolled with satisfaction like casino slots in her head, blood spilling down her finger as she excavated the innards of the socket.

Bile swarming up my throat, I clasped my hand over my mouth as I slammed my laptop shut and ran to the bathroom. I’d barely lifted the toilet lid before dropping to my knees and vomiting into the bowl. I was petrified to close my eyes; the sight of her ravaging her gore-ridden mouth was imprinted on the back of my eyelids.

*Jesus Christ, that couldn’t have been real… right? Who the hell would do something like this?*

Even rhetorically, the question felt redundant— who wouldn’t? I’d seen grown adults criss-cross applesauce on sofas with a steaming matcha in hand, gleefully recalling my sister's case as if it were a campfire story. All to cap it off with an advertisement for BetterHelp… pockets full of fucking blood money. And I’d just provided $50 to their demented fantasy. 

After emptying my guts till my vision grew fuzzy, I sobbed against the cold tile. Nothing was worse than being overwhelmed with so much pain that you shrink back to a child again. I just wanted my Mommy and Daddy, except neither of them wanted to hear me ring the phone.

That night, I only slept due to the wringer the day had drained me through. The next morning, I almost felt hungover, a migraine blooming behind my eyes. It felt like I had food poisoning in my skull from consuming the videos. Groggily, I completed my workday before curling up in bed and staring aimlessly. 

I didn’t want my computer, I didn’t want my phone— they call it the worldwide web, not because it's connected, but because it's full of venomous spiders, especially ones with microphones that label themselves “journalists.” For hours, I stared till my eyes dried and grew bloodshot like crimson lightning.

When my phone vibrated next to me, I nearly screeched from fear. Y’know, when you typically assume the worst, but this time the outcome actually was the worst? This was one of those moments.
