Me and my family love Thanksgiving. We have a strange tradition that nobody would ever fully understand why we do it but, it's what my parents have always done since me and my brother were little. 

My mom loves decorating the house with the "fall" theme. Everything just feels so snug and homey. It evens smells like fall, if that makes sense. I love the candles and little baskets of potpourri everywhere around the house. 

My dad always helps my mom cook everything. Me and my brother are now old enough (he's 16 & I'm 18f) to drive to the store and pick up the main course which is the "turkey" we did wait until last minute since we wanted it to be fresh for tonight. I know any stores that *are* open today are going to be extra packed since everyone always does last minute shopping. The stores are just now opening so hopefully we get there before the rush.

We got to the store parking lot and of course no parking spaces, I told my brother to just park in the front of the store and wait in the car while I go get our special turkey. I'm a bit nervous since it'll be my first time getting the turkey now that I'm 18 my mom thinks I'm ready, since she's usually the one bringing them back home.

I go in and walk through every aisle looking for a perfect size so we can have left overs. i went to the candy aisle since I have a sweet tooth I couldn't resist. I saw the cutest guy right there, he was perfect. Tall and thick. I had to invite him over for dinner tonight. I hyped myself up and went up to him

"Hey I'm Kayla, what's your name?" I said smiling

"Oh hi, my names Mat" he said with a surprised face expression. 

"What are your thanksgiving plans for tonight?" 

"Im actually not doing anything, I'm just going to make myself dinner and watch a movie with my dog" he said jokingly 

He was perfect I thought to myself.

"I know this is pretty straight forward & we just met but would you like to come over my house ? My family would love to have *you* for dinner"

"Uhhh... that was unexpected but you seem pretty nice and I have no human company. I'd love to go. What time?"

"My family likes to start our thanksgiving early with games and what not. Can you come with us now?"

"Okay umm.. this is weird but I'm feeling spontaneous I guess. Can I ride with you? I caught the bus here."

This couldn't be anymore perfect. He's cute and a perfect size, has no plans & is riding with us too. My parents are going to be proud of me. 

"That's perfect, my brother is actually waiting for me in the front"

We got in the car and I introduce them to one another. My brother and I made eye contact like if he also knew he was perfect. I was so excited and felt an adrenaline rush. We pulled up to our house driveway and my parents were waiting at the front door. They had a smile on their face when they saw him. 

"Hi I'm Kaylas mother Ana, nice to meet you"

"Thank you for having me over, I really appreciate it."

We all went inside and right away my parents had to start preparing the food. I took Mat downstairs to where we had laid out plastic drop cloths everywhere. We already knew he was going to be terrified by the site of it so we let him go down first so he couldn't escape. he looked at me with a shocked shaken expression. I was too excited for this and his scared, sad little face was too cute. He tried pleading and pushing me out the way I just hushed him and said 

"everything is going to be okay. Don't you believe in reincarnation? You'll be back anyway." 

"You crazy b\*tch, why are you doing this to me"

"Its nothing personal, it was just right place, right time sort of thing"

My brother pushes him to a wooden chair we have set up in the middle of the basement and slit his throat like a turkey. Hung him up by his feet and left him there to dry up so in a couple hours he'll be ready for cleaning and preping. 

Listen I know it might sound crazy but its only once a year and you'd be surprised how much better YOU taste than a dry ass turkey. 

Happy Thanksgiving Everybody <3
