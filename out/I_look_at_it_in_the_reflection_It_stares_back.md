So there I was. Standing in my room. Sage burning on the floor. My eyes glossy with tears. The thing was gone but I didn't feel relieved. Because deep down I knew it was still here. But then something worse happened. My mom walked in.

She immediately realized something was wrong. Mom took in my shaking figure, saw the big forming bruise on my hand. She cupped my face looking me straight in the eyes. 

"Who did this?"

I couldn't utter a word. I knew what she thought about the worst thing that could happen to a child.

"No. Mom. You..."

"You know you can trust me, right?"

"Mom, please. I just..."

She hugged me and I winced. I felt her tense. She turned me around and saw blood. 

"It's ... just paint mom"

At that moment I knew that with every word truth or lie I would break the trust I had with my mum more and more. I felt immense guilt building inside. I couldn't bear the thought of looking at her distraught face.

"I'm sorry..."

Mom just said nothing in return. She walked me in the bathroom, took my T-shirt off and started to patch me up. I knew she was trying to keep herself together. But I heard her labored breaths and few sobs. I wanted to hug her to thank her to reassure her but as I tried to face her she stopped me with a shaking gentle touch and I left the bathroom not looking back. The door closed quietly behind me and I heard the sink running.

Guilt. Guilt was consuming me. Eating at my existence. I walked inside my room and layed on the bed. I didn't notice the reflection or presence near my bed appearing. I really didn't care about what happened to me next. So I waited until it was quiet in my home and I started packing my things. It was irrational but at the moment it felt like the only right decision. But only for the moment. 

"Sis?"

My sister was standing at the door looking sleepy and confused. 

"I'm just searching for something. Go to sleep."

"Do you know why mom was crying?"

"I... I don't know."

I looked away and saw Alex in the reflection. It was within the reach distance of my sister. Its blurred form was stretching towards my little sister's head. 

"Don't leave." I heard two voices whispering. 

I panicked. I rushed to my sister and grabbed her in a tight embrace trying to cover her from Alex. With the tears in my eyes, I started to chant.

"I won't. I would never leave. I promise. Please. I would never..."

I closed my eyes trying to stop the tears. The fear of losing my little sister just paralyzed my mind. 

"You are going to crush meeee."

Before letting her go I looked at the window. It was in it's usual place. I shakily breathed out and smiled.

"Now get back to sleep. Okay?"

She nodded and walked away looking back at me a couple of times before closing the door as I sat on the floor. 

At that point, I felt like losing my mind. All the fear, anger, confusion and guilt that had been building inside of me for months bursted out. 

I started crying then laughing then laughter turned into silent cries. I was crumbling on the floor. I felt Alex staring intently.

"W-what do you even want from me?" I whispered weakly.

It didn't move.

"Alex!" 

"I will free you..." it whispered again.

"I don't need that! Please leave. What does that even mean?"

The room was filled with silence. Then I felt the piercing touch on the skin again.

"No! Nononono..." 

I jumped immediately and rushed to the corner pressing my bloody back to the wall. It was in front of me glowing with the same terrifying expression. I closed my eyes but I still saw its gaze peering into my chest.

So here I am now. I haven't left the house since and it is already more than three weeks. I am too afraid it will do something to my family the moment I step outside. I didn't try to talk to it either. Because every time I tried I decided to claw its way inside my spine. My mom thinks something horrible happened and so does my father. But they don't try and talk to me about that. I guess they think I need space. The burn on the floor caused by the sage was found but not questioned. I don't look at Alex. I don't acknowledge Alex. I don't draw Alex. But Alex is all that is on my mind. It doesn't matter what Alex is really. A demon, ghost from the cemetery, spirit trapped on my property, an imaginary friend turned real or maybe all of them.

I feel like I am sitting on a mine. And the wrong move will just...

My birthday will be on the 1st of May. I was waiting for it. But I dread it now. Maybe I have until then. Maybe this is the last story I will ever tell. I don't really know. I don't want to be remembered as a mutulated corpse in the news or a crazy daughter. But I am afraid of what will happen after. I am afraid of my own screams. And i hope nothing comes next after my death.
