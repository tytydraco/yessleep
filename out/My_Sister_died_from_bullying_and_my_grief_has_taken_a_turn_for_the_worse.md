I lost my sister, Hana, to bullying two months ago. She had been attacked by bullies in the bathroom. They hit her, kicked her, left her in a state of disarray. Her clothes were bloodied, stained red. I can vividly remember when she came home that day and silently went upstairs, her lips, clothes, shoes, and nose bright red. That day, she hung herself in her room using a bathroom towel.

Hana was always a bright girl, and the best older sister one could have. She was my best friend. She cared for me when my parents were at work. She was the one who fed me, she tended to my injuries, she comforted me at my lowest lows. Before she died, she had a bright future ahead of her. She had been accepted into NYU, and she had planned to be a doctor. But those bullies took that away from her, and now she's dead. During her funeral, I was forced to watch as her body laid inside a oak casket, her hands resting on her stomach, her eyes closed. She looked so peaceful, and I felt that she was finally happy in heaven, no longer suffering.

These last few weeks have been torture for me. My dad's been drinking nonstop now. Our house, once clean, is now a mess. My mom locked Hana's room, and none of us are allowed to enter. Our neighbors have been sending us our condolences, but their condolences won't bring back Hana.

School's horrible as well. I've been bullied nonstop by those same bullies that killed Hana. They're happy that she's dead. Now that she's dead they have something to bully me about. Every day I come home with a battered lip or bloody nose, but I don't say anything.

However, this past week the bullying's only been getting worse. More and more people have joined in teasing me about my sister's death. I've had mud thrown at me, I've been beaten senseless, yet I just endure it. Who cares anyway? No one gives ten shits about me. My parents were grieving, and I'm pretty sure they wouldn't care if I died. Hana was always the golden child, and I was the one in the goddamn corner, ignored by my parents.

My thoughts have been tainted with thoughts of revenge, suicide, and murder. I just want to avenge them, make them suffer the way Hana did when they beat her senseless. I just want to kill them, make them pay for what they've done

Yesterday, I bought myself earmuffs and a tub of gasoline from the gas station. The attendant raised an eyebrow.

"What's the gasoline for?" The attendant asked. I pointed to the car parked outside. But that wasn't my car, that was Hana's. Even before she died, my parents forbade me from driving it, but that day I secretly used it while my parents were at work.

"Couldn't you have just used one of the filling stations?" The attendant asked.

"It's just in case my car breaks down in the middle of nowhere," I said, which, of course, was a complete lie. The attendant rang up the total, which turned out to be $30.00. I paid, then walked outside. After going home, I grabbed my dad's lighter and put that on my desk, followed by the tub of gasoline, the earmuffs, and a pair of glasses. Sitting behind all those items was my dad's Glock 26. Small pistol, semi auto, 10 round capacity. I had learned how to use a gun during the summer, and tomorrow was the perfect time to practice my skills.

This morning, I poured the tub of gasoline all over my house and lit the house on fire. My parents were still inside, but there were two kitchen knives plunged into their heads, so no one would hear them scream anyway. I drove to my school, loading my Glock on the way, and stuffed it in my pocket. Today was the day that I would get revenge on everyone who killed my sister and bullied me senseless, and I was going to make sure none of my sister's tormentors left the building.
