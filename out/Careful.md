As a change of pace, I want to tell you all the funniest ghost story that I’ve ever been a part of. It started some months back when I started being able to hear what sounded like the voices of people around me, even though no one was speaking. It was always short fragments of thoughts, and usually they lined up loosely with that person’s actions. 

At first, it was only in person. Stuff like “don’t.” Followed by a yawn. Or a “cute.” followed by a friend sharing a pleasant story about their spouse. Or even “yogurt.” As a coworker reaches into their lunchbox to retrieve that very item.

It was kind of fun at first, getting little insights into the minds of the people around me; there was really no other explanation for what it was. If it ever got to be too much, I just had to leave the room. A person’s voice never left the room they were in. Then, one day, I chimed in. 

I was talking to a coworker, one who I didn’t particularly like. She had a way of weaving together a string of half related fabricated events with enough true information to craft a narrative in which you were the villain of events you were never even a part of, and she was the tragic heroine. Worst part was, by the time she was done, you may have actually believed her. She started as she always did, with an anecdote she knew I was already privy to. By the two minute mark, it had already drifted into a fictitious, if mundane, alternate telling of it and I had already begun to lose focus.

“Careful.” 

The voice catches me off guard. It sounds like my own, difficult to distinguish from my own thoughts. It enters my mind unprompted and retreats just as readily. 

“And meanwhile, she’s always saying how you never have anything done on time. Now, I want you to know it’s not your fault, and…” Thankfully, the voice pulls me back into the moment, and I tune back in as she lays her trap. 

“I know.” With an overly pleasant smile, I return to my work. Moments later her voice is in my mind. “Porn.” She signals that she’s going on break.

As I drive down the backroads that lead toward my house the next evening, the song in the stereo hitches.  I glance down at it, my eyes drawn to it like a spider drawn to movement on her web.
“Careful.”
My attention snaps back to the road just as the deer jumps from the shrubs by the side of the road. I just narrowly avoid a costly repair service. 

Each time the voice appears, it’s to warn me of some impending danger, and each day, it seems there’s more and more to be careful of. If these are my own intrusive thoughts, then I must be getting awfully paranoid. Everyone else seems to have a lot more on their mind than avoiding the next catastrophe, although their minds seem to be quieting down of late. 

I use the term “catastrophe” lightly. I assume so, at least. Most of the warning are over seemingly innocuous moments of self reflection. I reconsider myself with caution, usually pleased to find I can come to a better conclusion. It helped. It doesn’t help. 

I can barely hear anyone other than myself these days. Each bite of cereal has become an exercise in patience as I time careful spoonfuls between careful warnings. I’m becoming almost mute at work. Each time I open my mouth it feels like a life or death struggle to find a correct series of words. I don’t know how serious the consequences of ignoring any given warning is or how far reaching. I don’t dare find out.

“Careful.”

“OF WHAT?!?!” The room is empty. I sit alone at my no longer cluttered desk in my well lit bedroom. The doors are locked. The windows closed. Not a danger in sight. The voice is outside of my head now, still mine, coming from just beside my ear.

“Me.”
