Back in the 90s, when the internet was still the wild west with barely any rules, there was this website.  
Its domain was gibberish—I can’t recall it now. But I wrote it down in a notebook so I could return to it from time to time.

The site was a graveyard of horrors.  
Hardcore gore, war scenes, factory accidents, corpses—stuff no one should ever look at. I knew it wasn’t good for me, but I couldn’t stop. Every visit lasted longer, each session rotting my brain a little more.

The site had an owner, a man who called himself **Camera Man**.  
He wasn’t just an anonymous admin; he wrote blog posts, strange, cryptic messages only a few could make sense of. He described himself as an observer, someone who *recorded* the worst things humanity did and displayed them for anyone to see. He didn’t care what the footage was—if violence stood before his camera, he would capture it.

No one knew who he was. Few ever managed to contact him. But everyone understood his obsession with gore. Some called him insane. I didn’t care. He had content, and I consumed it.

I regret that now.  
Sometimes when I close my eyes at night, the old images still come back. I was just a stupid kid. But back then, I couldn’t stop.

Then came the day Camera Man announced his “masterpiece.”

He wrote about it in one of his deranged blog posts. The text was messy, frantic, like he was having some kind of episode while typing. But all I cared about was the promise of something new.

The video was simple.  
A man’s severed head, jammed into a toilet. The person behind the camera—Camera Man himself, I’m sure of it—muttered words that weren’t real. Nonsense syllables, twisted sounds that made my skin crawl.

It was different from his usual uploads. Before, he just *collected* footage. This was the first time he had made something himself. And that terrified me.  
How had he gotten that head? Some said cartels, others whispered worse. For the first time, even I felt he had gone too far.

Not long after, the site vanished. The domain was pulled down, and because it was gibberish, no one ever bought it back. I thought that was the end of Camera Man.

Years passed.  
I grew up. I buried that part of myself, hid it so well that no one in my life ever knew.

Until the day I went to my brother’s house for a barbecue.

His young son was playing with an iPad. And on that screen, I froze.  
The image was unmistakable: a man’s head rising from a toilet, babbling gibberish.

My stomach turned cold.

Later that night, I tore through my attic, ripping open boxes until I found the old notebook, buried under dust. There it was. The name of the site, written in my own shaky handwriting all those years ago.

**skibidi .com**

I typed the word into a search engine.

And I found them. Hundreds—no, thousands—of videos. All the same: a head emerging from a toilet, spitting nonsense. What I had once thought was Camera Man’s one-time “masterpiece” had multiplied, spreading like a virus.

The worst part? No one sees it for what it is. Children watch these videos every day. They laugh. They dance. They share them without realizing what’s behind them.

And I know now.  
It can only be him. Camera Man is still out there. And this time, he’s not just showing us violence. He’s reaching children.

So if you ever see a kid staring at *Skibidi Toilet* videos on their tablet…  
Don’t let them watch. Don’t let them hear.

Because the Camera is still rolling.
