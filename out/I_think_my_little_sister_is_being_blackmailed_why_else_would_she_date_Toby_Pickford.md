Series: [Part Two](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1euitqs/i_think_my_little_sister_is_being_blackmailed_why/)

When I had first heard they were dating I thought it was a joke.

Mum had been the one to tell me. We had been on the phone for nearly forty minutes whilst I roamed up and down my small bedroom packing away my things into a suitcase. My three years at university studying Animation and Computer Design were over. I was set to be picked up by Mum the following morning.

"Oh," said Mum, "Your sister has a new boyfriend."

This wasn't particularly hot news. Leigh had lots of boyfriends all throughout secondary school.

"You remember Toby, don't you?" Mum said.

"No," I said, honestly.

It had been years since I had last seen him and I hadn't thought about what had happened on my sixteenth birthday. Perhaps it was harder to remember Toby because I hadn't told anyone about what I had caught him doing that day.

"Toby...Pickford?" I said.

"Yeah," said Mum.

"Toby who was at my birthday party years back?" I said.

"Yes," said Mum, "Don't you remember inviting him?"

I did remember. Toby was a year younger than me and I had known him back when I was a member of the Maywell Scouts. Back then I had seen a lot of Toby but had never gotten to know him much on a personal level. He had been energetic, but also shy; very introverted. I could vividly remember all us little scouts dressed in our gray uniforms with the red scarfs around our necks. One of the scout leaders would fill up plastic cups with diluted orange juice and then we would each receive a biscuit.

Toby liked to dip his biscuit into the juice.

It was those memories of knowing Toby from scouts which had prompted me to invite him to my sixteenth birthday party. A handful of my close friends were going, as well as some relatives. Although it was my sixteenth, I wasn't interested in making it into something big. I had been on my way home from school walking down Hallworth Road when I spotted Toby waiting for the bus. He looked lonely, standing on his own not talking with anyone. Whenever I saw him in school he was always alone, or at the fringe of groups. Anyone could tell he was very shy and the type that had difficulty making friends.

I had stopped to get myself a bag of chips from the nearby chip shop. Without thinking too much about it I had gone over to Toby and started a conversation with him.

"Chip?" I had said to him.

He looked at me as if very confused for a second and then he accepted the chip.

"How have you been?" I said, "Remember when we were in scouts together?"

"Yeah," said Toby, tentatively smiling whilst he chewed the chip and then picked another from the bag.

"You know," he said, "I saw your drawing in the art building. The drawing of the samurai. It's amazing."

"Thanks, man," I said.

I was used to compliments over my drawings. I loved drawing manga-style art specifically and found I had a talent for it. At fifteen years of age I could draw almost to the same technical level as the professional manga-ka I admired.

"I've started to draw manga myself," said Toby.

Unprompted, though I didn't mind, Toby took off his rucksack (which looked big on him because he was quite small, even compared to me), and opened up a drawing pad.

Toby's art was mediocre but showed promise. There were still plenty of circles with the usual criss-cross lines drawn around them in an effort to create the head of the character he had drawn.

The drawings!

I had forgotten what Leigh had mentioned to me once. She was in one of his classes once. She had sat behind him. Over the course of several weeks Toby had seen to drawing pictures of Leigh in a manga style. He showed them to her and she politely acknowledged the drawings.

Months later Leigh had made a Facebook post in which she made it clear she thought Toby was a pervert. The post itself was a picture of all different types of stick figure people; each one showed a stick figure doing something like reading, or swimming, or singing, and so on. The idea was to tag your friends so they could be delighted by being tagged as 'the smart one', or 'the best friend'. Leigh had tagged Toby as 'The Pervert'.

"Toby's a pervert? Really?" one of Leigh's friends had posted.

"Yeah!" Leigh had replied, but didn't elaborate.

I had seen the post on Facebook and had asked Leigh about why she thought Toby was a pervert, and she explained about the drawings. I had asked her if there was anything particularly perverted about the drawings themselves and she said she just thought it was weird that he thought it was okay to draw her during class each week.

If I had known this about Toby at the time, plus all the other odd (but harmless seeming) things he had gotten up to in and outside of school, then I might have re-thought inviting him to my birthday party.

Toby looked at me with awe and bewilderment when I mentioned about my birthday party that was happening the next day (Saturday) and that he was welcome to come by if he wanted to.

"Sure!" he said, eagerly.

He then got on the bus and went home. The next day on my birthday he turned up early and sat on the sofa whilst I opened my presents. Leigh was there and had been shocked to see Toby was in our home.

"What's he doing here?" she said to me when we were alone in the kitchen after I was done opening my presents.

"Who? Toby?" I said.

"Yeah," said Leigh, "He's so weird."

"Nah," I said, "He's just shy."

Leigh rolled her eyes.

Leigh was the complete opposite to Toby in a lot of ways. Naturally very pretty, outgoing, Queen Bee of her friendship group.

I returned to the party and spent a few hours hanging out with my friends. We shared a six pack of beers out in the back garden whilst my parents and other relatives stayed in the  living room. Leigh stayed with Mum and Dad in the living room because, although she didn't dislike my friends, they were all a bunch of weebs like myself and she just didn't have any common interests to talk to them about.

It was around 5pm when I noticed I hadn't seen Toby in a while. He was easy to overlook so I glanced around the back garden and through what I could see in the house but I couldn't spot him. Casually I got up and decided to see how he was doing. I ventured through the house to the living room. He wasn't among my relatives either.

Maybe he was using the bathroom? I waited around for ten minutes chatting with my relatives and then decided it had been long enough to go upstairs to check on Toby. I didn't know if he actually was upstairs, for all I knew he might have gone home without telling anyone. I walked down the hall  and for a moment I wondered if he was doing something creepy in my sister's room. I walked casually to the first room on the first floor of the house; my sister's room. I peered inside and found the room was empty.

Had I really expected to find Toby in there doing something weird? I had probably just let Leigh's misguided opinion about Toby play in my mind too much. Josh had mentioned he wanted to borrow a CD of mine (an Iron Maiden album) so I decided to go grab it since I had come all the way upstairs and would likely forget if I didn't grab it there and then.

I went into my room, whistling to myself, and that's when I caught Toby in the act. He was kneeling next to my underwear draw and had one of my socks in his hand pressed against his nose. He was taking a big sniff of my socks. His other hand rested on the open drawer. Toby opened his eyes and looked at me in horror. He dropped the sock, stood up, and went almost as red as a tomato.

"What are you doing?" I said.

My words were tinged with bewilderment as well as anger.

"I'm sorry," Toby said.

I could see he was utterly mortified by what I had caught him doing.

"I wasn't..." he began, as if attempting to explain why he had been taking a big old sniff of my sock. He seemed to give up before he could try for an explanation. He rushed out of the room like a frightened mouse.

Strangely, he didn't leave my house for another hour. He stayed whilst everyone sang happy birthday. I tried to pretend like he wasn't there. After the cake was cut and everyone was handed their slice on a paper plate I noticed Toby slipping out the front door.

I had seen him more or less everyday at school here and there after that incident. I had even spoken to him a few times (he had tried to show me more of his drawings) but I kept the conversations with him short and didn't stick around to give him hope of us hanging out again. I had been tempted to tell at least one person about what I had caught Toby doing in my room but somehow I just never got round to it.

In a way I felt bad for Toby who was already getting tagged in Facebook posts for being a pervert. Me spreading a truthful rumour about him sniffing my socks would be the final nail in the coffin to any kind of social life he had. What's more, I didn't much like the idea of being associated forever as the guy who had his socks sniffed. I hadn't been close friends with him before so it wasn't a big deal pretending like he didn't exist after the incident.

"Could you send me a picture?" I asked Mum whilst still on the phone.

She had to go but she sent me the requested pic a few minutes later. The picture showed Leigh sat beside Toby on the sofa; they were holding hands but had a hands width of distance between them. Leigh had her usual duckface-style pose on for the photo and Toby smiled sheepishly. The thing was, Toby hadn't undergone a major transformation. He was just older, taller, still had his baby face; and the same shy demeanor.

The more I tried to picture Leigh and Toby as an item the more confused I felt. It was only the pure logic that I might not be able to understand what made their budding relationship work, or at the very least have potential, that prevented me from taking any kind of action, like calling up Leigh and asking her what the heck she was thinking dating Toby of all people.

Mum arrived at 11am to pick me up. As her little white car eased to a stop I noticed Leigh was sitting in the passenger seat. She was smiling and waving at me as I neared the car with my luggage.

Mum got out of the car and helped me pack my stuff into the boot and the remainder (things like pillows and the duvet) onto the backseat. When we were done I gave one last look to the house I had stayed with my flatmates for two years (the first had been spent in a campus dorm room) and then we drove off.

I sat in the backseat among all the stuff I was bringing home with me whilst Leigh, ever the thoughtful sister, remained sat where she was in the passenger seat.

I noticed she was dressed in a top that was more revealing than usual; didn't Mum care Leigh was dressing like this? I told myself that Leigh was just making a particularly bad fashion choice and to maybe bring it up with her later in a way that wasn't going to feel too confrontational. 

I managed all of five minutes after we set off before asking Leigh about Toby.

"Are you both really together?" I said.

Leigh shot Mum a look.

"You told him?" said Leigh.

"It just kind of happened," she said, "He's actually really kind of okay."

"Okay," I said, "So, how did you even start talking?"

"I'm not talking about this right now," said Leigh.

"I mean I'm sure he's a nice guy," I said, trying to be diplomatic, "But-"

"-oh, I know he's a total weirdo," said Leigh, "I know, but, like, he's also kind of cute, okay?"

"So this isn't some kind of prank?" I said, "You're really dating Toby Pickford?"

"Yes," said Leigh, getting annoyed, "What's, like, your problem?"

"No problem," I said.

I didn't say any more on the matter for the rest of the hour car journey back home. That sense of dread I had eased up and completely went away by the time we reached the front door. I busied myself taking all of the things to my bedroom, Mum helped; she wouldn't leave me until she saw everything was unpacked.

I ate dinner with Mum, Dad, and Leigh and everything seemed fine. I avoided mentioning Toby again but it was Mum who brought him up.

"When are you seeing Toby next?" said Mum.

"Um, probably tomorrow. Is it okay if he comes over?" said Leigh.

"Of course," said Mum, "Just remember to keep your door open, keep the lights on, you know the rules when boys are in the house."

"Okay," said Leigh, and she took her dirty plate into the kitchen with her.

When I entered the kitchen I saw Leigh was standing at the sink staring out of the window. It was dark out so the window was no more than a black veil. The soapy water in the sink had reached its limit and had started to overflow, spilling onto the tiled floor.

"Leigh," I said, to get her attention.

She continued to stare at the window, remaining very still.

"Leigh!" I said again, louder the second time.

She snapped out of her reverie and gave a 'eep!' of surprise at the overflowing water. She turned the tap off and shoved her hand down the sink, pulling the plug and letting most of the water drain. She then saw to mop up the water that had spilled on the floor.

"What's going on with you?" I said to Leigh when the mess was cleared up.

"Nothing," she said, "I was just thinking."

"About what?" I said.

"You've been acting really weird," she said.

"I've been acting weird?" I said, "Don't you remember what you used to think about--"

Leigh raised her hand, and said, "Hey, he's my boyfriend now. Can you stop trying to make a problem for us?"

"I'm sorry," I said.

I didn't know what more to say. I could tell if I pushed the issue any harder it would upset Leigh even more. It started to settle in that she might, somehow, for some strange reason unbeknownst to me, actually have feelings for sock sniffing Toby.

I said, "I'm sorry," a second time, and then gave Leigh a big hug.

I went upstairs soon after and went to bed.

The following morning I woke up to the sound of Leigh giggling downstairs. I made my way down to the dining room.

Then I saw him. Toby. Sat beside Leigh at the dinner table. The immediate vibe I got from both of them sitting together was that they were genuinely enjoying each other's company. My brain had to adjust to seeing the older, slightly bigger and broader (but still mostly baby faced and altogether average) Toby that was before me.

"Hey," he said, looking in my direction for a moment very casually and then fixing his attention back to Leigh.

She was wearing the same tank top as yesterday and was sitting leaning against Toby. Toby had a look on his face, a kind of amazed wonder, as if he were even more surprised than me at the kind of treatment he was receiving from my sister. Toby drew himself back.

"We shouldn't," he said, "We need to behave."

"Oh fine," said Leigh, and she sat back in her seat.

I didn't see much of either of them for the rest of the day. They stayed in Leigh's room with the door open. I came and went from my bedroom to downstairs and back several times for different reasons, but most of all to keep an eye on what they were up to.

Toby seemed awkward and sat on her bed. Leigh moved around a lot, doing most of the talking. By this point I'd had enough of trying to guess what was going on. Whatever it was didn't seem like that big a deal so I went to my room and spent the day relaxing, reading manga, and doing some drawing.

After drawing for an hour listening to music I decided to go make myself a cup of tea. It was as I made my way down the hall towards the stairs that I heard Leigh and Toby having a heated discussion.

"You're going to keep your mouth shut," said Leigh, whispering what she was saying, "I'm not going to have you ruining this for me. Do you understand?"

"Okay," said Toby, meekly, "But what if they find out?"

"They won't," said Leigh, "Not if you act normal. The only problem here is you so just be cool and I'll let you stay around. I don't have to be nice to you like this, you know that right?"

"Yeah," said Toby, "I'm sorry."

"It's fine," said Leigh, "Just do as I say from now on, okay?"

Toby must have nodded that he was going to continue to do whatever it was Leigh was asking him to do. It was strange hearing Leigh speaking so intensely to Toby of all people. What exactly was she asking him to do? To not act strange or was there something else going on that demanded Toby swear himself to secrecy?

I retraced my steps back to my bedroom door and closed the door hard. Toby stayed until 10pm. Leigh had taken a shower and had just stepped out of the bathroom into the hallway when I stood in her way. 

"Hey," I said, "Can we talk?"

Leigh nodded, hugging the towel around her tighter.

"I heard what you said to Toby earlier," I said.

Leigh's eyes went wide as if I had just stabbed her in the stomach.

"You did?" she said.

I realised then that she thought I already knew what she and Toby were up to, what they were trying to keep a secret. I hadn't planned to do so but I continued to talk to her as if their secret was known to me.

"Why, Leigh?" I said, "Just tell me why?"

"I didn't intend for it to happen," she said, "It just did. I'm trying to make the best out of the situation."

A renewed sense of dread was taking hold of me. What was it that she and Toby were hiding that had her so distressed? I was close to finding out what it was.

"What does Toby have to do with this?" I said.

Leigh's concerned expression changed, becoming stoic.

"Nothing," she said, "Leave him out of this."

Leigh started to move away but I grabbed her shoulder.

"Ow," she whimpered, "You're hurting me."

"I'll let you go if you tell me what's going on right now."

Leigh's eyes widened and I could see how frightened she was. She put a hand to my cheek and forced a smile.

"Everything is going to be okay," she said, "Trust me."

"How can I trust you if you don't tell me what you're hiding?"

Leigh's lips firmed up.

"There's nothing you, or I, or anyone else can do about this. It's better you don't know. Now please let me go."

I didn't let go. I couldn't. I felt like grabbing her by the shoulders and shaking her until she told  me everything. I felt like a monster even holding her arm as tight as I was but it was all I could do; it was a weak threat I hoped she didn't see through.

"Let me go or I'll scream," she said.

I didn't let go and then Leigh sucked in a big breath. I slapped my hand over her mouth and her eyes went wide. I felt her tongue tickle my palm and I let go of her mouth and her arm. Leigh giggled and pranced back to her bedroom.

Enough was enough. I had to talk to Mum and Dad about what was going on. If I couldn't get through to Leigh then maybe they could. I went downstairs and told Mum and Dad about all of my concerns, and I also told them about Toby sniffing my socks in my room on my birthday. Mum and Dad listened attentively and quickly shared the same level of concern as me.

Dad shot up from the sofa.

"What are you doing?" said Mum, standing up and hurrying to Dad's side, grabbing his wrist gently to stop him from thundering upstairs.

"I'm going to find out what she's up to," said Dad, "None of this sounds right."

"I know, I know," said Mum, "That boy clearly isn't good for her. But don't go up there shouting and demanding things. Please let me talk to her first, okay?"

Dad looked to the stairs for a few moments before relaxing a little.

"Okay," he said, "Talk to her tonight. If she starts messing you around then I'll step in."

I went to bed that night unable to sleep. At around four in the morning I noticed a light coming from downstairs. I got up and crept my way to the stairs and made my way down as silently as possible, doing my best to avoid the steps I knew creaked.

I spotted Mum and Leigh sitting at the dinner table. They were whispering very quietly.

"Maybe Dad will get through to you," Mum said, sounding as if she were at the end of her patience.

"Don't," said Leigh, whining, "There's nothing going on. I swear."

"Stop lying to me," said Mum, "You think I can't tell how different you've been acting? It's Toby, isn't it? He's blackmailing you, isn't he?"

"No," said Leigh, whining even more, on the verge of tears, "He isn't."

"Then tell me," said Mum, "Tell me everything right now or else I'll let Dad handle things his way."

Leigh shot up suddenly and slapped Mum's phone off the table.

"Bitch," she said, and then Leigh ran towards the stairs. She froze when she reached the first step, spotting me. She then renewed her effort to climb the stairs, passing me by. She hurried to her bedroom and shut the door behind her.

Mum picked up her phone, placed it on the table, and then started to weep into her hands. I made my way down to her and gave Mum a hug. She was surprised to see me but simply held me close.

"I tried," she said, "She's not listening. Dad will have to sort her out."

I stayed with Mum for another ten minutes and then we both went up to bed. I hated how things seemed to be getting worse, how Leigh was passing by every opportunity to explain her situation so we could help.

I thought world war III would start when Mum gave Dad the all clear to go nuclear on Leigh after last night. But nothing happened. Mum made breakfast and Leigh stayed in her room and Dad went to work as usual. I wasn't eager to set off any dramas myself (more than I already had at least) so I decided to make plans to see my friends instead. I spent the whole day catching up with my friends who I had only seen here and there on visits back home from university. I didn't mention anything of what had been going on to them but word of Leigh dating Toby had gotten around. My friends were just as perplexed (and a little repulsed) at the idea of Toby and Leigh being an item as I had been.

I returned home just after dinnertime and found Mum and Dad and Leigh sat in the living room. Things felt far from normal because there was some tension in the air, but there wasn't any arguing or tears like I expected. After making some small talk with Mum and Dad (Leigh just sat and watched TV with her closed fist resting against her temple), I took an opportunity to speak with Mum alone in the kitchen.

"Did you tell Dad to step in?" I said.

"No," said Mum, "I spoke with Leigh some more about things and there's nothing going on after all. She's just being a bratty teen."

"Wait, what?" I said, confused, "She's clearly up to something with Toby. I heard them. I pretty much got a confession about it from her I just don't know exactly what it is she's up to."

Mum looked impatient all of a sudden.

"She's in love," she said, "And you're being a protective big brother. I'm so proud of you for caring so much about your sister. But there's nothing the matter."

I couldn't keep the disbelief from my face. Last night I had been so sure Mum was going to bring Dad into this but now she was acting as if everything was okay? What had she found out from Leigh to make her change her mind to this degree?

"Mum, is it blackmail?" I said, "Does Toby have something over Leigh?"

"That's enough," said Mum, crossly, pointing a finger at me, "I'm telling you as your mother to drop this right now. No more. Do you hear me?"

None of this made sense. None of it. I didn't know what to say or do so I simply nodded.

"Good boy," said Mum, and she cupped her hand to my cheek and caressed it, and then she embraced me in a hug. I felt numb, and angry, and I knew I had only one option left: to tell Dad about my concerns. But with Mum changing her tune on Leigh and Toby I no longer felt as sure of myself that something was wrong. What if it was all in my mind and there really was no problem? What if I was the problem? It was a horrible feeling to not be able to trust my own intuition anymore.

Leigh went out to see Toby, which gave Dad an opportunity to check in with Mum regarding everything that had been discussed yesterday. I stood in the dining room listening into Mum and Dad's conversation in the living room. Mum repeatedly said the same things she had said to me earlier to assuage any concerns my Dad had.

"Nothing's the matter," she said, "In fact, I think Mike is the one stirring trouble."

Mum's words were like a slap to the face.

"Really?" said Dad.

"Do you really believe that story Mike told us about Toby sniffing his socks?" said Mum, derisively, "He's just jealous that another boy has taken up his little sister's attention."

I clenched my fists and wondered for a moment if I was about to storm into the living room and yell at Mum. I decided against it, realising there was nothing I could say against someone gaslighting me so much; my own mother no-less.

"I should probably speak with Leigh just in case," said Dad.

"If you like," said Mum, "But it's all a worry over nothing."

Things went quiet and then I heard the sound of kissing.

"What's gotten into you?" said Dad, unused to Mum's sudden assertiveness.

Mum didn't say anything and the sound of kissing resumed. I walked off to the kitchen and went out to the back garden for some fresh air and to get away from the sounds of what my parents were doing.

I left a half hour later to hang out with my friends. I wanted to tell them everything that was happening at home but I couldn't bring myself to do it for fear that I was the one making everything up in my head. I was sure something was wrong, things just weren't adding up; but there was always the awful possibility I was wrong about it all.

Over the next few days the previous drama involving Mum and Leigh was as if they never happened at all. Leigh stopped bringing Toby over and went out to see him instead. Mum and Dad continued on with things as usual. On the Sunday morning I had been passing by Mum and Dad's bedroom and I could hear them talking in bed.

Unexpectedly I noticed the conversation was getting heated.

"Nothing is wrong," said Mum, "Why won't you let things be?"

"Stop lying to me," said Dad, "I can tell something is off. Mike can too. I've kept my concerns to myself but you can't keep covering up for Leigh. What are you two up to?"

"Nothing," said Mum, "Please, you're scaring me."

There was the sound of kissing but it stopped quickly.

"Get off me," said Dad, "You've been like a rabbit in heat all weak. I'm exhausted with it."

"You love it," said Mum, "Come here..."

I heard the slap from Dad which followed.

"Don't touch me again," said Dad, "I mean it."

I felt a strong urge to race to Mum's defense. Whatever was going on she didn't deserve to be slapped by Dad like that. I stopped myself however because a part of me was relieved that Dad wasn't going to let Mum bury our concerns under the rug any longer. Not only was Leigh acting strange, but so was Mum. I listened for a while longer but the talk had stopped.

Dad got up and took a shower. Mum wasn't making a sound.

I was strangely excited to speak with Dad whilst I waited for him to come downstairs after his shower. Together we would be able to get to the bottom of things.

Mum came downstairs first. She had a redness on her cheek from where Dad had slapped her.

"I fell," said Mum, spotting my concerned look, "Silly me."

Dad came downstairs and, strangely, he was whistling.

"Morning," he said and he slapped Mum on the behind and then pulled up a seat at the dinner table.

"Breakfast," he said, "Get to it."

Mum fixed him with a dirty look. He met her look with a casual one of his own and smiled. Then Mum began to smile as if genuinely amused.

"Fine," she said, "Coming right up."

What?! I thought. Nothing they were saying or doing made any sense.

"Did you speak with Mum about Leigh?" I said.

"Oh yeah," said Dad, "It's all fine. Just girls being girls."

The knot that was in my stomach felt like it became several times tighter all of a sudden. I wanted to cry. Dad was fixing me with a look that was far too casual for what was going on. He had hit Mum, something he had never done as far as I knew, and he had come downstairs whistling and then he had told her to make breakfast like an order. That simply wasn't the kind of man Dad was.

"So that's it, Dad?" I said, "You've changed your mind too?"

Dad looked at me as if confused.

"Everything's fine," he said. He reached forward and ruffled my hair as I were half my age.

"You're overthinking things."

Dad sat back and started to drum his fingers on the table.

"How about you drop this behaviour from now on, okay?" said Dad, "Fretting over nothing is only going to make things worse. You don't want things to get worse, do you?"

"No," I said.

Dad nodded, "Good," he said, "Everything is taken care of. Just enjoy the free time you have right now. You'll have to start the job search soon, won't you?"

I nodded. I was talking to my Dad but I wasn't at the same time. He was talking to me and I had to listen. It was the same feeling I got from Leigh and Mum. I was being spoken to and nothing I said was going to make them admit to what was going on.

I tried my absolute best to pretend like nothing was amiss. Toby started coming over everyday and Mum and Dad stopped having a problem with it. I kept an ear out for any more hushed conversations; I wasn't sure if they stopped or if they were simply able to talk about whatever they were hiding without me catching onto it.

Three weeks passed and the sense of everything feeling off didn't go away. Over and over again I tried to convince myself that it was all in my imagination, only to catch a strange look from Mum, or Dad, or Leigh. Mum and Leigh had been talking about going shopping and I had listened whilst I sat back and watched TV on the adjacent sofa. I had glanced over at them talking and had caught them both looking at me in such a way that I was sure their entire conversation had been a kind of act.

This got so bad I was painfully aware at all times that Mum, Dad, and Leigh were always acting as if everything were fine and were always checking from the corners of their eyes to see if I was buying into it.

I didn't know what to do. It was easy enough to go with the flow and have conversations with any of them. I tried to pretend like everything was okay. For all I knew I was becoming mentally ill, or already was, and that they really were doing their best to appease me as if I were really the one causing the feeling of disharmony in the household.

My friends noticed how stressed I had become but I decided not to continue seeing them for a while because I was sure if I did I would tell them about my concerns. I simply was too afraid to tell anyone else about what was going on for fear that they would also act concerned initially, only to turn about and act as if all my concerns were just my imagination. I dodged concerned texts from my friends with messages explaining I was working hard on finding my first big job after uni and couldn't spare the time to hang out with them.

One thing kept occuring more and more. Mum, Dad, and Leigh mentioned Toby in some way in pretty much every conversation they had around me. 

"Toby would love to watch you draw sometime," Mum had said. 

"Toby and Leigh were thinking of going for a walk round the lake, want to come?" Dad had said. 

"Toby was wondering if you would like to hang out and play a video game or something sometime?" Leigh had said. 

I had said no to all of these things and many others. It was obvious I didn't want to spend a single second around Toby, not with all this going on, and I couldn't understand why they wanted me to hang out with him so much. What was so special about him? 

The constant stress of dealing with my family's strange behavior wore me down. I started to take lots of stress naps to deal with the anxiety of it all. After yet more invites to hang out with Toby not so subtly suggested to me throughout the day I went to bed and crashed. 

I woke up sometime in the night feeling a sharp pain in my groin. At first I thought it was a need to pee but the pain got worse as if I were literally having something stabbed against my crotch to the point of bleeding. My eyes struggled to open and my body felt incredibly heavy even as I tried to sit up. 

I couldn't move much. Something was weighing down my arms and chest. My eyes adjusted to the near pitch dark of the room to make out the faces of Mum, Dad, and Leigh looming over me. Mum and Dad were on either side of my bed and were pinning me down. Even Mum's strength was enough to pin my left arm down onto the bed. Dad had one hand pressing down on my chest and the other gripping my right forearm so tightly the skin felt like it was burning from the friction. 

Leigh was the one pressing something against my groin. The pain made me want to thrash wildly about. Every alarm bell was going off in my mind that if she pressed even just a little bit harder irreversible damage would be done to my crotch. 

Worse than them holding me down, worse than whatever sharp metallic object was being pushed deeper into my crotch, was the looks on the faces of my family. 

Their faces though hard to make out in the dark weren't the faces of maniacs or emotionless serial killers. No, their faces were twisted with anguish almost as if they didn't want to be doing this to me, as if each of them wanted to scream into my face how sorry they were. 

"You're making us do this," Mum whispered into my ear. Her voice was trembling. 

"The next time we invite you to spend time with Toby you say yes," she said, "You will always say yes. Do you understand?" 

I understood but I was trembling so hard it was as if I were dunked into ice cold water. 

If I tremble any harder it'll piece the skin, I thought, mad with fear. I could only imagine the look on my face; like some barn animal that knows it's about to be slaughtered but too dumb to comprehend why and how. 

Hot tears streamed down my cheeks and made the room harder to see. I blinked as hard as I could to clear up my vision. 

"Promise!" Mum yelled into my face. 

Hearing my mother shout into my face the way she did, with such barely controlled venom, was the worst sound I had ever heard in my life. 

"I promise," I said, saying the words as if each syllable were foreign to me. I could hardly speak from the fear gripping me. 

"Please, please, don't hurt me," I said as loud as I dared. 

"This is your only warning," said Dad, "You're making us do this. Everything will be fine so long as you are nice to Toby and all of us. Now we're going to let you go and you're going to lay still and not move an inch until the sun comes up. Is that understood?" 

"Yes," I choked out. 

For a horrible second I felt warmth at my crotch. She's pierced it, I thought. A moment later however I realised I had wet myself in fear, hot pee soaking into the mattress. 

Leigh pulled her hand away and whatever it was she was holding. The horrible stabbing pain stopped but the residual ache of having something sharp having been pressed there remained. 

Like shadows, each member of my family melted into the darkness. 

They left the bedroom door open. 

I sobbed in the dark and didn't move except for the trembling which I couldn't stop. 

Bit by bit the sun rose and a hard orange glow filled my bedroom which stank of urine. 

It had laid trembling in bed for around three hours before the sun came up. I eventually found the will to get out of bed. I grabbed a change of clothes and took a shower and then put the urine-drenched clothes into the hamper. 

I felt emotionally and physically exhausted and burnt out from the fear of what had happened. I could hear them talking downstairs as if all was fine with the world, the smell of bacon and eggs rising up to the first floor of the house.

I was starving. 

I made my way downstairs and saw Mum, Dad, and Leigh sat eating breakfast. 

"Morning," said Mum, "I heard you get up so I made you a cup of tea." 

She slid the freshly brewed cup of tea over to me and I sat down at the dinner table. 

The others ate and made small talk whilst I stared at the cup of tea as if it were some alien object. My hand continued to tremble as I gripped the handle and brought the cup to my lips and drank. My parched throat enjoyed the taste of the tea immensely. 

"So Dad," said Leigh, casually, "I was wondering if Toby could come over today?" 

It was almost comical how much tea I spilt on my lap when Leigh spoke up. My lap burned from the scolding tea. 

"Oh dear," said Mum, and she fretted about dabbing a cloth on my lap to handle the worst of the mess. I barely even registered the pain of the tea because I was fixated on what Dad was going to say to Leigh. 

"Should be fine," said Dad. And he pretended a novel idea just occurred to him. 

"You know," he said, pinching a slice of toast from his plate and biting into it, "I think Mike and Toby should hang out today too. What do you think?" 

"Sure," said Leigh, "I think Toby would like that." 

None of them made any particular look towards me but I could tell they were waiting on my response. Of course they were. I hadn't dreamed they were threatening me three hours ago, had I? Had I? They acted so casually nibbling at their breakfast despite everything that had happened a part of me still doubted myself. 

"S-sure," I choked out. 

"Good man," said Dad, slapping me on the back. 

"Great," said Leigh, cheerfully. She started typing on her phone, "I'll let Toby know." 

I heard a clunk near me on the table. Mum had just put down a fork I hadn't seen her holding before. She smelled of orange juice and biscuits.
