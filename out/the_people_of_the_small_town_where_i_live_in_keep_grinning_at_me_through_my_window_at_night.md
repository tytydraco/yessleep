so, i think i have some explaining to do.
frankly i had a well paying job. but i left my work to do a start up. it did really well, and i dont want to bore you with financial jargon just now.

basically, i hit a jackpot. life was going really, really good. so i decided to move from the busy city life and settle down in a small town for some time before marrying my girlfriend. if it all went well, i was even thinking we would settle in the town i was about to go to.

as the car passed the notice board of the town(i wish to not say the name for obvious reasons) i noticed weird things. at first i thought it was just my imagination, but something really was going on here.

the houses i passed by had people- and kids all around the entire town block. many of the kids were jumping around, with a lollipop. some even waved at me, but their parents shushed them and dragged them away from me.

okay. rude.

there is this coffee house near my home, just a few meters away-i usually go there to clear my thoughts. there would be this guy there who i liked. his name was john. we always used to talk about the town- even he himself felt that something was wrong here. he had been staying here for a long while- he also said to keep my windows shut.

i did not know what that meant until i decided to not close my curtains one night.

i awoke hearing taps on my bedroom window- slow but constant. opening my eyes and looking at the window, the first damn thing i see is mr.johnson, with his mouth open wide, really, really wide. he was paler than i had seen him infront of his house a few weeks ago, and his pupils were completely dilated. he kept tapping on the window. 

the damn thing just would not stop looking at me.

he had left a certain space from where he was looking into my window, so i could see some of my backyard he wasn't covering with that terrifying face.

there were more.

of them.

mrs. prewett, ms.rodriguez, mr. pascal and even kids, all lined up through my backyard, mouths wide open, pupils dilated as wide as possible-no, this was not humanly possible.

the next day (i dont even know how i slept that night i couldnt bring myself to close the curtains because i was so scared) they were gone.

i walked around town and the first thing i noticed differently from before was that now they were acting friendlier to me. like due to some reason i finally fit in.

neighbors in this town usually shushed me or dragged their children away from me. now, they smiled at me, and would talk to me longer than 10 seconds.

so i thought, they just got used to me. cant keep pretending i dont exist anymore. 
then i noticed some changes in john.
he started smiling involuntarily, and he would freak out anytime he did. he was always thinking about something anytime we talked, and sometimes.. just for a moment, i would see his eyes getting dilated.

i thought not to point this out to him, obviously because i did not want to freak him out, 
but i was finally beginning to put the pieces together.
i wanted to bolt the fuck out of that town, and i did, i took my car and bolted it out of there, and just as i got past the road sign, i felt a voice in my head, not mine, an outside voice, saying,
"Don't leave."
"Stay, with us."
and as stupid as it sounds, i believed them.

a few days later, i stopped seeing john completely in the cafe, when i asked the owner he just stared at me and did stuff on his calculator.

so now, im still here in this god damned town. but something happened yesterday that made me want to write this story, because this might be the last moment i will be sane, maybe.

i forgot to close the curtains that day when i went to sleep. i never forgot, but i guess i forgot yesterday. what i saw made me fear for my life.

i saw john.
grinning. 
tapping on the window.
pupils completley dilated.

today when i slept after the tapping stopped and i rechecked the backyard for the umpteenth time for a sign of a person, i randomly felt both my cheeks twitch and my eyes started to move all funny. 

my hands are liyerally twitching as i type ths. thsi may be the laste mark i ever make on the internet.
