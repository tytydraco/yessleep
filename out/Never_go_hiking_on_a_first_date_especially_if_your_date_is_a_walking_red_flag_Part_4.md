As some of you in the comments of my last post has pointed out; maybe Moira is a shapeshifter, or maybe she is protecting me from this entity inside my house... or perhaps both could be true. I hope this part will bring you the answers you seek.

Against my better judgment, I decided to go up into my attic. The dripping stain on my dining room ceiling was all the evidence I needed to convince me that it wasn’t just inside my head. Maybe if the cause of the dripping was really just a leaky pipe, it would confirm that my paranoia had blown this situation way out of proportion.

I climbed into the attic using a flimsy folding ladder. As soon as I pushed open the hatch to the crawlspace, a foul stench hit me like a punch to the nose. It was the rancid smell of a wet neck brace, amplified tenfold. I slammed the hatch shut and nearly vomited from the top of the ladder. Swallowing back the nausea, I forced myself to open it again and cautiously peaked my head inside, aware of the tense stiffness in my neck.

The cracks in the ceiling were golden with sunlight, tracing golden lines along the dusty wooden beams. The space was dim, but I could still make out my surroundings. My eyes watered from the stench, but I braced myself and climbed inside, pushing forward through the thick, rotten air.

I tried to straighten up, but my head smacked against a wooden beam. Hunching over, I painfully realized I was too tall to stand properly. My field of view was restricted to the dusty floorboards beneath me. Despite my limited vision, I pressed on. Dusty boxes and abandoned cobwebs crowded the space around my feet. The boxes were filled with things I had no memory of, but that was not what I was looking for.

Something near the entrance caught my eye, I almost mistook it for a wine-stained wedding dress, crumpled and forgotten. But as I reached out, my fingers met something hard and smooth, nothing like fabric. It felt brittle, like the shell of some massive insect. A husk abandoned and left to dry out, stitched together in a shape that shouldn’t exist. Only a faint, musty scent clung to it, I knew it wasn't the source of the stain or the smell. That came from above the dining room, at the end of the hallway. So I pushed deeper, and the smell intensified. My stomach was in knots at this point. My heartbeat forced its way up my tight throat and pounded against my head. That's when I saw it, the source of the smell.

It looked like a pile of dirty laundry, but it wasn't clothes. It was skin, an unmistakable pile of skin. It was lying there like a fleshy rotten egg yolk in the middle of a puddle of white ooze. I couldn't bring myself to come near it, but I swear I saw something familiar. A birthmark of an unfinished butterfly.

A sudden sense of dread filled me. The neck brace held my head down like a deer grazing, and I can only describe the feeling I had as a deer picking up a sign of bloodlust before getting pounced on by a lion. I had to get out, but more importantly, I had to see what was around me. The doctors warned me of the consequences of removing the neck brace too early but at that point, it felt like life or death.

My hands fumbled at the straps, tearing at the fastenings with frantic urgency. The brace came loose, and the weight of my own head crashed down like a bowling ball. A blinding pain shot through my neck, sending a wave of nausea rolling over me. My vision swam, but I didn’t care, I had to see for myself. My plan had the opposite effect. As soon as I removed the brace I could feel my vision fading, but that only sharpened my hearing.

From the far corner of the room, I could hear the familiar clattering of keys on a typewriter. It was quickly approaching.

I spun around on my heels and made a desperate and painful break for the hatch. The sound behind me matched my pace perfectly as if some unseen narrator was typing out my every step. My foot scrambled to find purchase on the flimsy ladder while my head rolled frantically on my shoulders, searching for whatever was chasing me. But it remained out of sight, lurking in the dark spots of my vision.

Before I could begin my careful descent, gravity yanked me down. Perhaps my foot failed to find the ladder, or the ladder couldn't support my sudden weight. Either way, the ground found me all the same, its unbearable hardness threatening to support the weight of the world. Pain exploded through me. My leg popped, and my head cracked against the wall. As I lay sprawled across the hallway floor, the last thing I saw before the pain swallowed me was a row of eight cold, curious eyes peering at me from the hole in my ceiling.

I woke up once again in a dark haze. For a moment, I thought I was back in the hospital. The all-too-familiar sensation of IV tubes wrapped around my arms and, strangely, my legs too. The heavy blanket draped over me wasn’t coarse anymore. Everything felt soft, damp, and sticky against my skin.

I opened my eyes and was met with a dark room, my room. No fluorescent lights or humming of hospital machines, the only sound was a distant dripping. The sterile smell of the hospital was replaced by a pungent stench that clung to the thick air, a musk of mildew and the sour-sweet scent of decay.

I tried to move, but the pain was instant and overwhelming. The dull ache in my neck was now accompanied by something sharper, a searing pain that shot up my leg, through my hip, and up my spine, colliding with the raw throbbing in my skull. I wasn’t moving. I couldn’t.

The weight of my neck brace was the last thing I noticed. I had grown so accustomed to it that it felt like an extension of my brittle body. But something was different. Thick strands of silk had been carefully woven around it, reinforcing its grip… or perhaps ensuring I couldn’t reach the buckle again. But the patch of silk stretched tightly over my mouth had only one purpose: to stifle my cries.

Then, from somewhere in the darkness, a voice… soft and tender.

"You shouldn’t struggle."

Panicked muffles erupted from my mouth but were caught by the silk mask. I recognized the voice as the old lady from the hospital. Had my dream visitor finally come to visit me again?

The woman stood next to my bed, and slowly, she reached over and turned on the bed lamp. She wanted me to see her. She walked over to the foot of my bed, and when she turned around, I could see her face in the pale light.

It was the face of Moira, she looked impossibly aged and tired. Her beautifully brown ember eyes were now glazed with a cataract grey, clouded and distant. The sight of her filled me with a strange mix of calm and confusion. She could see it on my face.

“I don't have long, and I can't answer any of your questions. But it’s time for me to be honest with you.” Her voice sounded remorseful and sincere, despite being rushed.

“I know I must look hideous, but this brittle form is the best I could do to help ease you into the realization of what I truly am.”

While she was speaking, I noticed her slowly undressing. Flashes of memories from the waterfall rushed into my mind, and like a spot-the-difference puzzle, I was forced to examine the ways in which her body had aged. At that moment, I didn’t care how she looked, she was still beautiful to me. I wish I could have told her that, but more importantly, I wish I could say the same about what happened next. She wanted to say more, but all she could let out was a woeful, tragic shriek as she fell onto her hands and knees.

I almost jolted out of bed to console her, but the pain kept me rooted. I was carefully suspended in a half-sitting, half-laying position against my headrest. I couldn't do anything except watch in horror as the woman of my dreams transformed into the creature that haunted my nightmares.

It started with a noise, a disgusting popping and crackling that reminded me of twigs in a campfire. The back of her spine bulged and pushed out against her wrinkled skin. Her face was looking down, but I could still see the pain plastered across it. As painful as this was to watch, I could not imagine the feeling of experiencing it firsthand. At least, that was what I thought, until the woman in front of me slowly tore open like a wet paper bag. Then it became clear to me that what I had considered to be “Moira” was merely a decorative shell for the creature inside her. 

The tear began in the middle of her back. It started as a subtle bulge that immediately exploded into four large, bony tentacles that ruptured outward, connected by wet, rotating joints where her ribs should have been. The four legs were covered in some kind of thick, slimy mucus, dripping onto the ground as they took root and quickly lifted her body. Her arms and legs elongated and stretched to the same impossible length before Moira expelled the remaining limbs from her back with a pained cry, like a mother giving birth. Her arms and legs deflated and fell flat on the ground like empty, wet tube socks. I’m not sure how, but from somewhere inside, a swollen abdomen appeared, much larger than the rest of her body.

Now, the only part still wearing Moira’s skin was its head. It dragged itself up by the foot of the bed, and I watched in horror as Moira’s mouth opened and, from inside, two smaller legs carefully protruded outward, like fingers feeling in the darkness; they pushed from within, and without any semblance of grace, her face fell onto my lap like a wet mask. Revealing behind it the same tightly stretched face I knew all too well, smooth and glistening

I was horrified by the scene before me, and yet I couldn’t look away. Something was compelling me, tugging at my mind like the tide yielding to the moon. I felt paralyzed by its unblinking stare, my eyes wide and locked on its gaze. I recognized the darkness behind those pitch-black opals immediately. I had visited it before, more times than I could remember.

It wasn't easy, but I managed to lower my head and break eye contact. I couldn’t bear to look into those eyes again, though I could still feel them burrowing into my skull, sifting through my thoughts. My mind was a messy blur, my vision just a smudge on a blank canvas. But as it slowly came back into focus, I saw the familiar shape—what I had first thought were butterfly wings was instead a blood-red hourglass, painted across the pale white canvas of the creature’s abdomen. Could this still be the same Moira from before.

Then she spoke, almost mimicking the same voice as earlier. The first few words were noticeably distorted before finding the right cadence and pitch..

It was her voice. Moira’s voice was perfectly clear and as gentle as I remembered.

“The silk spun is meant to savor the taste. Instead, you are wrapped up for your own protection.”

There was a long pause as if she wanted her words to take their course and sink in before she continued.

“Tonight is the first time you see me hunger for blood, but I will not harm you.”

I could feel the panic rising in my body. I didn't know what she meant, and my arms and legs started to punch and kick involuntarily. The struggle was equal parts painful and fruitless.

“I asked you not to struggle. Can’t you make this easier on me?”

My struggle ceased when I heard a painful inflection in her voice.

“There, there. Stay calm. I have to leave you for now, but I’ll be back. The way you remember me…”

She took another long pause, choosing her words carefully.

“I’m sorry for what I have done and what I am yet to do. I can't control the hunger. It is consuming me.”

And with that, she slowly turned away and quietly retreated into the hallway.

I sat there in my silky prison for the rest of the night, not daring to fall asleep. I was dreading Moira’s return, my mind raced to make sense of those cryptic words she left me with.

Morning came sooner than expected.

It was still dark out, but I could hear the birds waking up. Along with their peaceful chirping, I heard the sound of Joshua’s car pulling up to my driveway. A fleeting spark of hope filled me before I realized the literal spider’s den he was about to walk into.

Before I could even process it, Joshua was already climbing the old wooden steps.

For a split second, I considered screaming, forcing out any sound I could despite the silk smothering my mouth.

But then I hesitated, my breath catching in my throat.

If I stayed quiet, maybe, just maybe, he would leave. Maybe he’d think I wasn’t home…

My frantic thoughts were cut short by three loud thuds on the front door.

"Hey, man! Open up! Moira called… she asked me to check on you. It sounded important”

My heart sank as I processed his words. Moira had called him over. For what reason? Her cryptic apology was beginning to make sense.

“C’mon, man! I know you’re home!” he said in his typical self-assured tone.

“…You’re always home,” he added, his voice softer this time, almost like his inner thoughts had slipped out.

He knocked again, but silence was the only response.

Through the door, I heard him sigh, his voice dropping into a frustrated mumble as he stepped away.

"Where the hell did that old bat put the spare key… the square rock, or was it the round one? Ugh…"

I had no clue what he was talking about. Old bat? Did he mean Moira? Did he know about her illness?

From outside the window, I heard the faint sound of rock scraping against rock, followed by a brief celebratory exclamation.

“Aha! Gotcha.”

Moments later a sharp clink echoed down the hall.

A key… There was a spare key outside? I couldn’t remember that, but Joshua sure did.

At this point, my silence had boiled over into a muffled symphony of frantic screaming, pleading for Joshua to leave before it was too late. In the end, my noises only served to guide him deeper toward his demise.

As he entered my dark room, he quickly flicked on the light, and the sudden brightness blinded me for a second. Just as my eyes adjusted, I saw her. She was nestled in the once-dark corner of my room, right above the doorway where Joshua had just walked in. I don’t even want to think about how long she had been sitting there, just watching me.

When I saw Joshua standing in the doorway with Moira looming over him, I was filled with an overwhelming sense of dread — but in the back of my mind, there was a faint glimmer of hope. Compared to Joshua, Moira didn’t actually seem as big as I had thought.

I half expected him to come waltzing in like he owned the place and crack a joke about how the ladies love silk sheets or something, but as soon as he saw the panic in my eyes, his usually playful demeanor instantly shifted into one of deep, serious concern.

Joshua quickly made his way to my bedside, clearly confused by the situation I was in. He placed his hands on the thick fibers, trying to tear off a piece. It clung to his hand as he inspected it.

 “What the hell is going on? Is this silk?”

As he clawed desperately at the webbing, Moira started moving — slow and deliberate. I stared at her, my eyes bulging while I whipped my head up and down as much as the brace would allow, hoping my expression would guide Joshua to see what I was seeing. 

He didn’t. His eyes were fixed on me. His hands searched frantically for a grip on the strands covering my mouth. I knew it was pointless; the webbing was too thick, and the time was too short.

It all happened so fast. She had closed the distance between herself and Joshua and was now on the ceiling, directly above him.

Her eyes pinned me in place more than her webs ever could. My body gave up the struggle, all I could feel was Joshua shaking my limp body, as if trying to wake me from a terrible nightmare.

Slowly, the two round mandibles, which once seemed almost human in the way they moved when she spoke, broke apart. From behind them, two needle-sharp fangs gleamed in the light, their blackened tips glistening with dewdrops of venom. One by one, the droplets fell right down onto him.

Blissfully unaware of the dripping, his face lit up with an idea. "Stay here, I’m going to get a knife," he said, shaking his head as he realized the irony of telling me to stay put.

He quickly spun around and ran off toward the kitchen. Moira followed him like a shadow. All I heard were the sounds of Joshua rummaging through drawers, their slamming followed by a frustrated grunt. Then I heard Joshua say something that made me tremble with fear as I let out a desperate, muffled scream:

“Man, you weren’t kidding about this dripping. It’s so annoying.” I could hear the frustration building in his voice.

I heard the sound of metal clanging as he flung open the last drawer, followed by a brief silence, shattered by a scream that sliced through the house.

Joshua had always been my knight in shining armor, and I was just the helpless princess. I guess that made Moira the dragon in this twisted fairytale. The thing is, I never thought Joshua feared anything… until I heard his scream.

It wasn’t just fear; it was raw, primal terror, so violent that the sound echoed even after he hit the floor. Thud. A loud crash, followed by skittering, a pained yell, and a hellish screech.

I had almost lost hope, but before I knew it, Joshua was standing in my room again. He had shut the door behind him and leaned against it for a moment. As soon as he moved away, I saw the bloodstain smeared across the door.

“It bit me, that fucking thing bit me! But I still managed to get in a good gash before it ran off. Fucking coward.” His face was a mix of anger and determination, and then I noticed the kitchen knife gleaming in his bloody hand.

Its blade was stained with a strange black ooze. I know it sounds insane, but in that moment, I couldn’t help but feel strangely concerned if Moira was okay. It was an intrusive thought, one that made me immediately feel guilty for even thinking it. Joshua stumbled over to my bedside and with one quick, careful motion, sliced through the mask covering my mouth.

I took in a deep, panicked breath before explaining: “That thing is Moira. She used me as bait to lead you here! You have to get the fuck out of here!”

"I don't care who you think that thing is, I'm not leaving you here with it."

"I don’t think she’ll hurt me, but you aren’t safe here." I pleaded with him to leave

But Joshua wasn’t listening. The whole time I had been begging him to leave, he stayed focused on the task of cutting me loose. He would’ve carried me out even if I begged him to leave without me.

Suddenly, the cutting slowed down to a crawl, and I was still far from free. Joshua only managed to get one arm loose.

“Why are you slowing down?” I asked.

“I… I can’t feel my legs.” he said, his speech beginning to slur.

Suddenly, Joshua slumped onto his knees, his arms falling limp onto my bed. He looked me dead in the eyes, and as I struggled to keep him upright with my one free arm, he whispered something.

"Under the… pil..."

His words were cut off as his jaw slackened, dropping with the rest of his head. He was just lying there, staring at me, completely paralyzed. I just stared back in disbelief. In the helpless silence that followed, I heard the quiet fumbling of the door handle. It took a few tries, but eventually, the door slowly swung open. The rest of the room was a blur to me; all I could focus on was Joshua’s cold arctic eyes staring up at me, holding back a wave of tears. I stayed fixed on his gaze as Moira’s figure patiently entered the room. Tears pooled up in my eyes as Joshua slowly closed his. The wave he had tried to hold back washed over me, and I was drowning in tears. I whispered quiet lies, promising that he’d be okay.

Joshua’s body slid off the bed, my hand still gripping his limp fingers. I tried my best to hold on, but I knew Moira wouldn’t allow it. I watched through my tears as she carefully wrapped him up and dragged him out into the hallway. I didn’t hear anything else but the faint creak of the attic door opening and closing like an old sore. The smell hit me for a second before dispersing into a faint rotting undertone.

I spent the whole day typing this out with my free hand, my laptop carefully perched on my nightstand. I can’t shake the feeling that Moira will come for me next, but then again, I’m not sure if it will be her or the memory loss that gets to me first. My memories feel like drops of water in the palm of my hand. Every moment of my past feels fleeting; I have to hold on to something, anything, even if it’s just this journal.

I’m fighting through my exhaustion just to get this written down. I don't know if I’ll wake up tomorrow or if this will be my last coherent thought, but as long as I’m alive, I’ll keep writing. I can't rely on my own memory anymore.
