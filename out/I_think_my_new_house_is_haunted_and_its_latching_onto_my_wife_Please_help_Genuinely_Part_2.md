Well, let me just start off with the news that will get me crucified by every white knight on here - no, I haven’t moved the brick yet.

What’s more, so many people were not reading my responses, so let me make several things clear: I am the only one who works, because my wife has her sickness. We have two carbon monoxide detectors. I am trying my best, and it’s not helpful to call me names because I slip up a time or two. 

Next, I’m not “forcing my poor wife” to take pills, or do anything like that. She wants to see the doctors too. Could I be more involved with her health? Yes. But I work a very taxing job in order to pay for our lifestyle, so apologies if sometimes, things get away from me.

My wife and I are very different people. We married pretty quickly back when I thought I was going to be a father with her (as I mentioned in a comment, that didn’t work out). I’m a traditional, no-nonsense guy, so I’m not going to leave her, but I’m also not going to leave this very beautiful, very expensive home.

OKAY, to the actual update. More freaky stuff happened. Two freaky things, actually, and one maybe not freaky thing. Let me tell you what has happened since I last posted.

I didn’t get to bed until way later than usual because I was up reading all the comments and suggestions. I also was looking up priests and “witches” in my area, if you can believe. I saw that there was a local shop that sold smudging sticks only a few miles away, so I made a mental note to wake up early before work, buy some, and bring them back home.

My wife was really upset with me. She barely spoke and her face was really puffy from crying. She was basically unrecognizable. We went to bed at the same time without saying a word. 

I got barely any sleep because I had to wake up and get to the stupid store to buy sage or smudging sticks or whatever I purchased. When I got there, I realized the store was a *gas station* that just happened to sell a lot of woo-ey stuff. The cashier was, um, not sober even though it was the break of dawn, but he was able to point me in the right direction with what to purchase. I never thought I would be caught dead in the kind of establishment that sells posters of the Mona Lisa with a bong, but the things we do in dire times, I guess.

So I bought a lot of kinds of smudging sticks because apparently many kinds of plants work, which felt like a money grab, but I did not care. I was also instructed to buy a few rocks, one is definitely amethyst (I’m not a total moron), the others are pure black, silver, and totally clear. I was going to buy just that when the guy at the front said, “We have a stone that is reaaaaally good for getting rid of the bad stuff in life.”

1, I’m shocked that with whatever he was on, he was still being a sales guy, 2, tell me why a lumpy green rock in an acryllic box cost me $50 alone?! I hope this proves that I genuinely care, because I am NOT the kind of guy who would have ever spent this much money at a gas station spiritual store before (or hopefully ever again).

I got home in a rush, and I was shocked to see my wife was already up and sitting quietly at the kitchen table. She told me we needed to talk, and I told her I needed to get ready for work, but that I had gifts for her. I handed her the bag from the gas station. The black rock and the silver rocks just got looks of confusion from her. She glossed right over the clear one, I think. She slightly smiled when she saw the amethyst and said something about it “being her birthstone” which I had no idea about, but I went along with. The sage/smudging/whatever sticks did not go down well. 

“Why did you get me an ugly rock in a box?” was what she said when she finally got to the $50 weird green lump. This is a fair question to ask, but I was super tired and running around the kitchen at this point trying to find my water bottle for work.

“Because the man at the store said that it, and everything else I bought with my hard-earned money, could help you with that ghost problem,” was my response, and yes, that was not a nice way to put it, I KNOW. Really could have left out the “hard-earned money” part, but you spend that much money at a woo shop that early in the morning and try not to feel upset when it gets questioned.

She didn’t speak for the rest of the morning, and I went to work. Everything was uneventful until a little after 3pm, when I got a text.

Her: “What am I supposed to do with the sticks of leaves?”

Me: “I think you have to light it on fire on one end and then waft it around.”

Her, after a few minutes: “Can I open a window? It smells very strong.”

Me: “Sure.”

Her, a few minutes later: “She’s out the window.”

Me: “Did you mean “it’s” out the window? Like the smoke?”

Her: “She’s outside the window now.”

At this point, I was getting behind at work and just put my phone on silent. That was the slightly freaky thing that happened, but honestly, at the time, I just thought, “Great, at least she’s not on the inside of the window now.”

When I turned my phone off of silent at the end of the day, I had these texts from her.

“Why the green, lumpy rock? Lol”

“Would you like to know her name?”

“We need to talk when you get home.” 

“I think we know a solution to this.”

“Please move the brick. I’m sorry I was so mad, but please move it.”

“You’re not gonna move the brick.”

“Why won’t you move the brick? You’ll buy things to get rid of her, but not move the brick like we asked. Why is that?”

“Did the man say that the green rock was ok to touch”

“The brick has to fo” (I think she meant “go” here, and she doesn’t usually make spelling mistakes, so I think by this point she was probably pretty angry/emotional/etc).

With each text I read, I was pretty understandably pissed off. By the end of it, I just sent her back, “My day at work was fine, thanks for asking.”

I put my phone back on silent and drove home in just bitter anger. I guess I was wallowing, and I shouldn’t have, but I was. As I approached the property, one of the actually freaky things happened.

From the long drive down our driveway, I realised that maybe if you squint, you could maaaaaaybe make out a brick in the eaves. This had me feeling a lot better, and I was actually trying to convince myself that maybe this was the entire reason my wife knew of it, and she actually was having some sort of break in her mental status.

I’m shaking my head writing this, it is giving me chills. For a split second, while looking at the roof and driving towards it, I caught something in the corner of my eye, coming from the bedroom window on the second floor. A woman’s head, sticking far out, staring at the direction of the car. I almost drove right off the driveway. By the time I looked at it directly, it/she had ducked back inside the house. 

I thought it was just my wife playing tricks on me, so I parked the car quickly next to the house and just ran inside. My wife was laying down on the couch.

“DO NOT do that again,” I said. She looked at me extremely calmly.

“I don’t know what you mean by that.”

“You could have fallen out of that window.”

“What window?”

“Don’t do this. I just saw you peaking out of our bedroom window at the car. Your head was stuck out way too far. You could have hurt yourself.”

She just looked down at the floor and then closed her eyes. “I told you, she can get outside the window now.”

I lost it. Screamed some words I’m not proud of. Told her this was not how I wanted my marriage or my adult life to go (both true). She did not react. Just laid on the couch and calmly absorbed it.

I ended up running upstairs and yelling at the ghost instead. Basically told her where to go, that she needed to leave my house, she isn’t welcome and I’ll be getting a priest in. There was no response and it was basically yelling at thin air, so by the end I felt pretty dumb.

I went back downstairs and told my wife, “I’m going to just take a nap in the car. I cannot stand to be in this house right now.”

“Will you take down the brick?”

I responded with swearing again. Shouldn’t have. I know. I just headed out to my car and screamed in the cabin until I eventually fell asleep. When I woke up, it was pitch black and windy as all hell, so that’s why the brick is still up. I don’t have some secret agenda, I just don’t want to get blown off of my ladder right now to be completely honest.

Okay, so the second truly freaky thing that happened.

(Wow, okay, I had to pause writing this. It just happened again, but behind me in the kitchen. I am not proud of the girlish squeal I just let out.)

When I went back in the home from the car, my wife was asleep upstairs in the bedroom. She had left me a text on my phone that just said, “Can we talk at least sometime this week?” which made me feel a bit bad, honestly.

I sat down in the living room on the couch and lit up some of the sage/smudging sticks that were on the living room table (I did note that one of the sticks had been burned previously, which confirms she did actually do it today while I was gone). I just left the sticks smoking on this mirrored serving tray that we have, because I don’t want to hold them the entire time but also, fire-safety, and then went to look on Reddit to see if you geniuses might have any more great suggestions like “burn some leaves” or “talk to thin air”.

It was pretty windy outside, but from outside the window of the living room, I heard what sounded like a knock on the glass. Not that scary, things are blown around in the wind all the time.

But in the quiet time in between wind gusts, I swear on my life I heard some woman outside say either “Eave” or “Leave”.

I nearly jumped out of my skin. I am not joking. I TASTED the adrenaline - didn’t know that could even happen. I ran to the window and looked out, but yeah, as you could guess, nothing. I checked on my wife, she was asleep in her room, yada yada.

And it just happened again, as I previously wrote. A stern female voice saying “eave” (referring to the brick maybe?) or “leave”, up against the glass. It sounds so close to the glass that if this were a real person doing it, I feel like they’d leave lip-prints against it.

So, here’s my current plan, and please (kindly, though,) tell me what to do if you can think of any other advice.

1. Buy a third carbon monoxide detector, but a different brand, just to make sure.

2. Bite the bullet and hire a priest, even if it makes me feel dumb.

3. Take my wife to get a full psych work up.

4. Seance? Ouija board? Find a way to communicate with this thing if possible and tell it to get the HELL away from us?

Thankful for any advice, but I’ve saved you from a comment if you’re just gonna tell me I’m a jerk husband who deserves a good haunting, thanks. Real comments are very appreciated. I’ll keep you updated. This feels so stupid but also so real. I just want my home back.
