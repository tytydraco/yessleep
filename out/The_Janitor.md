 

I clean an office building at night. It's an ok job, but I think I’ll have to quit soon. I can't keep this up for eternity. I had a coworker until the other building we cleaned together downsized and she was let go. We had such a good time cleaning together, talking nonstop for as long as the buildings took to clean each night.  

The first shift alone was ok. I’d been cleaning the building for 6 months, so I knew my way around and the familiar sounds of the building, the way the bathroom stall doors would bounce against the lock twice when you walked in and let them close on their own.  

Occasionally, people that worked in the office or attached warehouse would stay late to use the workout room or finish up some work. One man I'd see pretty often working out and we’d exchange pleasantries. I valued those interactions during lonely late shifts more than he knew but after a few weeks, he started going in the morning.  

The only downsides of the job were the bleach stains that covered my work jacket and the girl in the mirror. At first I thought it was a trick of the light or my own reflection. If I was cleaning the sink in the bathroom attached to the kitchenette, I'd catch a glimpse of her in the stall behind me. Just a flicker in the mirror, a flash of black hair seen through the crack between the stall doors. I assumed it was just me getting scared of my own reflection, my hair flicking behind me or something.. until the day I heard my coworker yelling for me from that bathroom.  

Stella didn’t really fuck around about most things. She was one of the most honest and straightforward people I'd ever met, though she wasn’t always the most levelheaded or mentally stable. She could talk for hours, and I could listen for hours, so we quickly got close with each other.  

I walked from the other side of the building and found her sitting outside the bathroom, breathing hard and looking scared. I crossed my arms over my chest and rolled my eyes.  

“Seriously, how many times am I gonna have to kill a water bug for you? Just stomp it.”  

She shook her head and looked up at me. Her eyes were bloodshot, of course she was high.  

“Nah, no bug, I just get a really bad vibe from this bathroom, wanna switch and I’ll mop today?” 

I could tell she was holding something back from me, she hated mopping.  

“Did you see something in there?”  

She looked up at me and nodded.  

“Yeah...this is gonna sound crazy.”  

She explained that she'd seen the reflection of the girl in the stall too. I decided I’d just get the job done if she couldn't, and from then on, I was the one who cleaned that bathroom.  

There were a few other incidents that we ignored. Footsteps in the opposite hall when no one else was in the building but us, motion triggered lights that flicked on in rooms we weren't in. We talked about it a couple of times during our smoke breaks in her car, but the conversations usually ended with us agreeing that it wasn’t worth worrying about since we were making money, and we could finish the building together in about an hour most nights.  

After she got laid off, it took a bit longer for me to clean the building. I’d grown accustomed to the odd occurrences that happened in the building and most of it was tuned out. I just wanted to get in, make some money, and get out. I didn’t ever consider quitting the job because of the odd things that happened. None of it felt malicious to me and I really didn’t want to go back to applying to shitty fast-food chains around town and getting denied. Just like everything else in my life, I ignored it until it became a real problem.  

About a month ago, there was some big executive coming in to tour the building and the boss had recently called my boss to complain that the place wasn’t as clean as it used to be, so I figured I’d try and do an excellent job that night and do all of the extra stuff, make the place shine or whatever. I was scrubbing a toilet, listening to music through my headphones that was loud enough to drown out the breathing I’d been hearing in the stall next to me for the past few minutes. I’d almost forgotten about the quiet breaths when I glanced over at the stall. I saw a pair of legs and a pair of shoes. Whoever it was wasn’t sitting on the toilet, they were facing me, and guessing from the size of their shoes, they were about 10 years old. I tried to play it cool, quickly wiping down the toilet seat with my rag and walking to the door of the bathroom. I glanced down at the gap between the stall and the floor again. The kid had turned to continue facing me as I made my way out, the little black shoes pointing right towards me. As I left the bathroom, I heard the voice of a little girl, coming from the second stall.  

“I’ve missed you”  

I finished up the rest of the cleaning I needed to do. I told myself it was probably someone's kid they brought to work, even though that made no sense. Like I said, nothing about any of these incidents felt malicious, even if it did feel distinctly supernatural.  

I don’t know why I did it, maybe because I've always taken on a bit of a parental role around children. Maybe because I was still thinking about what the girl said to me. I grabbed my keys and jacket from the janitor’s closet and walked to the door. With my hand poised to push the door open to the parking lot, I spoke quietly.  

“Goodbye...” 

I drove home, watching the trees lining the two-lane road whiz by as I disregarded the signs suggesting I go 45mph.  

“I’ve missed you” It played over and over in my head. The more I tried to ignore it, the more I thought about it.  

Our little interactions continued for a few days. I started doing the bathrooms first so that there was still a bit of daylight when I finished with them. I’d check the stall the girl would occasionally show up in, but it was never used. I knew because I would always leave the seat of the toilet up when I was done cleaning them. A ring from the water had started to form in the toilet of her stall since it hadn’t been flushed or used in a few days. I couldn't help but wonder if the people who worked in the office knew about the girl. 

 I saw her a couple times in those few days. Never anything more than her shoes facing me in the stall next to me. She didn’t speak to me again, but I could always hear her breathing when I saw her, and I would always say goodbye before I left for the night.  

A few weeks went by where I didn’t see her. I continued to say my goodbye before I left, mostly out of habit. Then, a week ago, she started talking to me again. I saw her shoes under the stall again and was surprised when I felt excited to see her. Despite my excitement, I jumped a bit when I heard her speak. Her voice was quiet, so I took a breath to steady my nerves and removed the one headphone I almost always had in.  

“I’ve missed you. Did you miss me?”  

I stared into the toilet bowl in front of me, my heart racing. The bleach almost never bothers me since I’m so used to it, but in that moment, I felt it in my nose and eyes, stinging and making me feel dizzy. I cleared my throat and responded like an idiot.  

“I.. I guess I did.” 

I admitted. I hadn’t really thought about it, but her presence had become something I cherished. It made me feel like I was helping her in some way by being there. On some level I couldn’t understand, I felt protective of her.  

I looked over at the small black shoes under the stall. She’d moved close enough for her shoes to be encroaching into the stall I was in. 

“When are you coming home?”

She sounded sad, which surprised me. I was about to respond to her when I heard knocking on the bathroom door. I whipped around and exited the stall, opening the door to the man I’d seen working out a few times. I tried to pretend that I wasn’t just talking to some little ghost girl and collected myself. He looked past me into the bathroom and I prayed the girl was hidden or gone. That would be a bit too hard to explain.  

“Your car lights are on. I was about to leave but I figured I’d let you know so that your battery doesn't die.” 

I thanked him and grabbed my keys off the janitorial cart, walking out to the parking lot and opening my car. I hadn’t realized that the man was following behind me, being distracted by my short conversation with the girl.  

“You saw her?” 

I spun around as I realized he was standing by my car. I looked at him and considered my options for a second before nodding.  

“Just her shoes. And her hair a few times in the mirror...who or...What is she?”  

He just looked at me for a few seconds. A few seconds feels like such a long time when you’re standing outside at night in the cold.  

“I heard you saying goodbye the other day. Don’t talk to her. I don’t care how lonely your job is, don’t talk to her.” 

I expected any other emotion than the one he was portraying. He sounded annoyed at me. Before I could respond, he was unlocking his car and hopping in. I watched him start up the car and back out of the parking spot. As he took a left turn out of the lot, what I saw made all the blood drain from my face. I felt my stomach drop and my heart pounding in my chest as I watched his taillights get smaller and smaller. I was sure of what I saw, and I was terrified of it. As he had taken that turn, I caught a glimpse of his silhouette. He was facing me, dark horns protruding from his head and a sickening snarl pulling at his features. Nothing about him looked human or kind in that moment, but a strange familiarity swirled around in my psyche.  

I figured the building was as clean as it was going to get that night and hopped in my car, locking the doors and checking my back seat. The drive home was reckless and paranoid. Fortunately, I knew the way home by feel alone, so my eyes stayed glued almost the whole drive on my rear view. I didn’t sleep that night and told my boss the next day that I was sick. I was “sick” for a few more days, unable to stop the memory of that thing the man had turned into from replaying in my mind.  

Yesterday, I went in to work again. I hardly put any effort into cleaning most of the building. When I got to the bathroom that the girl stayed in, I took a deep breath. I was sleep deprived and armed with just a bottle of bleach, but it had to be done. I had to know who this girl was.  

As I stood outside the stall I’d seen those little shoes poking out of however many times, I felt numb. I just wanted to know what I had gotten myself into. I pushed open the door and looked down.  

There she stood, little black shoes pointing towards me, head tilted back to look at me. I looked at her and steeled my nerves. I did the first thing I could think of and squatted down so that I was eye to eye with her.  

“Lemme guess, you missed me.” She smiled at me and I smiled back.  

“Do you have a name?” 

The smile disappeared from her face. She looked so hurt. I watched as tears welled in her eyes and her face scrunched up.  

“You know my name, Momma. How could you forget my name?”  

I looked at her and felt my heart drop. She buried her face in her hands, and I saw the wound on the back of her head. Pieces of her skull stuck out from the back of her head, dripping with blood down onto the baby blue ruffles of her collar. 

Memories that weren’t mine flooded into my brain. A family, a daughter, a plane crash, and a deal with the devil. The world felt like it was spinning, and a splitting headache made me squint my eyes. I put my hands over my eyes and a scream ripped from my lungs. I could feel the wounds from the crash reforming, something in the back of my neck making a wet crunching sound and ripping through me, my ribs breaking and a piercing pain shooting through my lungs.  

After a few minutes of lying on the floor, I was able to sit up, the injuries fading away with the memories. I pulled my daughter close to me and sobbed into her dark hair. I felt the cold hand of a shadow on my shoulder, and I knew it was time to get back to work. Back to a fabricated life I chose so selfishly to save myself from His realm.
