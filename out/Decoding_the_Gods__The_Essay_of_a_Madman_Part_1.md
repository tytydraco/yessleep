I’m writing this after only recently finding myself coherent enough to form sentences, let alone commanding the presence of mind to type them out. I beg forgiveness, dear reader, if my language is flitting and disconnected as it goes. I trust my previous published essays and works will lend credence to my usual disposition, my learned background, my competence in my fields, and that, though this – perhaps my final piece – may seem akin to the erratic ramblings of a lunatic, it is not. 

I am sound of mind and faculties, if not somewhat weakened in both departments. 

I am sane. 

I am aware. 

I am no more lost in lucidity than you the moment this sentence is absorbed in your ever-flowing stream of logic. Please do not dismiss me as an excitable spiritualist, or a lost-cause doomsayer. I wish that were the case, but, my discovery stems directly from logic and learning; meaning it carries with it the symptoms of constrictive objectivity.

Would that it didn’t.

I should count myself lucky that none who read this can look upon me in my current state. For certain, my appearance would offer contest to my claims of normalcy – whatever that word may mean. Though my hair be matted, dishevelled and whipping here in clumps of grease and there in frayed ends at which I’ve ripped; though my eyes - home to a furious thunderstorm of filament red veins - are sunken deep and harrowed in the purple pools of exhaustion; though my teeth chatter like a laughing skull, and the rest of my hunched body contorts withered and hellish to a skeletal frame, a beast emerged from the styx, merely covered in loose, pallid, dusty, unwashed flesh… My environment is no better than my person. I beg you believe me. 

I beg you.

I’ve been completely consumed by work of late; pouring over reams of research, striding the length of my looming study, peering at scribblings and links I’ve made over the years, riffling through papers scattered here and there - cross-referenced, folded and crumpled, discarded in frustration only later to be retrieved upon a new discovery. No piece has been saved from my feral scribbling – even the older, delicate books that I procured at great personal cost and effort, have had their brittle, yellow pages frittering away to the dust of history from whence they spawned. My bookcases, usually organised and uniform, are now lurching towers of gaps and haphazardly thrown back books, looking for all the world like the remnants of a war-torn, literary metropolis. My desk is a dumpster of empty coffee mugs, cracked pencils and empty pens, coagulating microwave meal trays from the rare day I remembered to eat, and strands of hair – ripped from stress, or fallen from growing despair.

I hope this writing does not taint my previous academic oeuvre. Please note, as a disclaimer, that this article is not one of a studious nature – but rather something bewildering and devastating. If you wish to learn about languages, communication and how it has been knit from the first amoeba to the latest computer chip, then stop now. The rest is not for you.

I will explain how I got to this piece: I trust most, if not all of you, have been completely absorbed by a project. Usually, they’re the ones you’re not supposed to be working on. Ones that you do, in your chosen field, for fun. Because we know the corporate world, be it anywhere from the sciences to creative work, manages to constrict the passion out of talents, in order to capitalise on it, transmute the natural aptitude into monetary worth. A stroke of an artist’s brush, to them, is a declaration of love. To another, it is quantified and judged of worth – bought and sold as if only a prop for a price tag, so swiftly victim to the plague of commerce.

Our defence, often, to that, is to sell our souls until financial demands are met, and then whatever is left, we pluck out a special interest. We shield it from the world, we take it under our wing, nurture it, feed our love into it, in a way that says “This is mine. This is truth that my passion is not for sale.” The elmbazoned doodle in the corner of a textbook, our flare in an extinguished realm.

What care I if the current institute of learning paying for my patronage has forced me to steamroll forward, wanting to pave some enlightenment in the origins of the Devbhasha language, or to procure some truth in the existence of the Adamic tongue? When, the freedom their pay offers me free-reign in my chosen obsession? When I can neatly hand in the essays and studies, knowing that my current fascination of ocean floor creatures communicating, cross-species, via bioluminescence, will continue unperturbed?  I will whore my mind out to those who need the help – and will pay for it - if it means I can sustain my way of life and my own research. 

That is the crux of capitalism, which I feel is important to say, as it is the very fulcrum of my intensity to the chosen passion. We must need prioritise our servitude, before we enjoy the world as we see fit. And, because of that sacrifice, we give our all to the secret passion, to the beloved project, upon which we approach with such a devout pride, that we can almost understand the fervid attachment of the holy to the pious. Because the *meaning* is what we need, the *meaning* – a reason to be – is what validates us in this dreary globe. The absence of that is our biggest fear. For all. We all desire to mean something.

Ha!

Though we may think of drowning, burning, suffocating to be the heights of horror, we all know that to have our inconsequence displayed unto us, proffered on a platter of vapidity, would be worse – because we would realise, no matter the method of our demise… everything that preceded it was null. Void. 

And my god, I fear that may be the truth.

Let me not get ahead. Forcing my thoughts to anchor on my words is a soothing effect; I can feel the catharsis that transferring through to an easy and palatable lexis is having on me. I’m able to hold back the dam of existential terror, and word by word, allow a trickle through. But, I’m no fool. This will overwhelm me. But, not before I share it.

That thought process – in which we give our all to our chosen obsession - is what led me to this discovery, and I think it’s important I approach it slowly. I already feel myself wishing to avoid putting the concept into words; for how mammoth a task it may prove, for the ridicule it is bound to invite upon my previous achievements. Yet, for the sake of veracity, I will push on as best I can.

For those who have not read any of my work, or followed my career, please permit me to lay out a swift trajectory, purely to understand how I draw conclusions. 

 

**\~An Overview of Communication\~**

**\~Intro\~**

I started my career as a linguist. Though I’m mute and dyslexic, my aptitude for how languages work is, indisputably, (if not ironically,) prodigious. I’ve won more awards regarding the dissection of communication than any individual or establishment in the field before me, and though I hate to assume, I believe it will take a miracle to be deposed of that accolade in the future. Not only have I managed to shed new light on already established extensive research, but I’ve elevated it to levels no linguistic predecessor could even comprehend. This is not a matter of boast, it is objective. 

There is a joke in my circles, that fate saw fit to strike the champion polyglot, the gifted linguist, as a mute with severe dyslexia – but, I laugh at that despite the jag, because I believe the freedom in which I look at written communication dismantles the rigidity others face. I see the pieces shifting and swimming in their immense freedom of meaning – though undoubtedly an obstacle, (which may shine truer here than my previous work, as I plan to post this with no proof-reading or collaboration amongst my contemporaries), it is one in which I stumble and veer off-course, only to find something unique that others following the beaten path often miss. Others will follow the beaten path to find the fruit tree they heard of, I will venture beneath the canopy and the shrubs, over tangles and through bogs, and find a whole orchard – untouched and free to exlore.

 

**\~Flexibility of Written Conveyance\~**

There are, purportedly, 7,100 languages. That is not taking into account off-shoots of dialects, and further still, colloquialisms. Should you spend your time learning Japanese, and then take it on yourself to have a conversation with a Tokyo citizen, and a resident of Osaka, you will be either amused or perplexed to find that their languages differ somewhat – and that is a rather mild example. Let us look, quickly, at the first sentence of this paragraph. You read the numbers amongst the letters without pause – yet, they’re from completely different bodies of thought – one is literary, the other is numerical. Yet, you read the 2 of them- the two of them- both of them- each of them- both- each- you read them, and your mind creates the meaning for you to understand. That is all language is – a conveyance of information, from one to another, with the intention of linking two or more minds; stitch a tear of understanding with threads of information.

The reason I lay this down, though rudimentarily, is because I must push understanding that pertains to the research. Lest the opening be in vain, and you resolve to disregard me as a rambling madman.

From the above example alone, you may have clasped something you already knew, in that language and communication is so free-flowing, that so long as meaning is conveyed, communication is complete. You would also be aware, in our technological modernity, that language is evolving as rapidly as the world around it demands. No doubt you have stumbled upon the format of a familiar meme, in which you’ve seen it so often, that it no longer needs any written words to indicate meaning, but rather can be posted below some vague statement, and you can deduce the context intended by the meme. That is an example of an image wrapping itself in modern thought so often, that your mind instantly identifies it as substance and meaning. You are evidence of language’s propensity for volatile and spontaneous evolution! As well as evidence, you are the cause.

This rings true in the use of emoticons, and/or emojis. It is a fascinating phenomenon, that we should see the colon ‘:’ and understand its uses within a sentence. As well as a closing bracket ‘)’ and, likewise, across the globe agree upon its meaning. But, to place them together, ‘:)’, though objective nonsense, it has become so well-accepted as a ‘smiley face’, that not only has it become a programmed command ‘J’ but we also have developed an entire system around it. The average reader may look upon hieroglyphics, and find it beyond comprehension what those stone-etched symbols may dictate, but your own language has developed to a level that one single emoji can create a whole and complicit reply to a sentence.

For instance:

**Sender:** Hey, you still on for meeting tomorrow? I’m going to rush in straight after work, but if you’re there before me, would you be good with grabbing a table? Give me the table number and I’ll order drinks when I’m near.

**Response:** 👍 

This of course is a cheat, as the thumbs up was already well accepted as a response of affirmation – but the fact there is a text equivalent is the very proof of the evolution of language. It is this evolution, and the variables within, that I must beg you wrap your mind around before I continue, because the language I have discovered is complex – far beyond what we have seen or known, but that doesn’t render it null. Let us look at the example below.

A favourite quote of mine:

*“Our doubts are traitors, and make us lose the good we oft might win, by fearing to attempt.” –* William Shakespeare, Measure for Measure\*.\*

Profound and concise. Written (as generally accepted) in 1603 or sixteen-four (was the switch from numerical to alphabetical jarring there?) but still very much readable and resonant today. The same message could be conveyed with: “Won’t know if you never try.” “You’re your own worst enemy.” “Fortune favours the audacious.” They’re all different tastes of the same sentence.

But let me bore you, just a little more, before I get to the crux of this short paper. And the intention here, if it please you, dear reader, is to drive home the malleability of language and communication. Consider the above, modernised:

*Ex. 1 - “Doubting yourself will pretty much be the reason you don’t try.”* 

*Ex. 2- “R doubts r tr8ors n make us lose the gud we often mite win by fearin attempt.”*

*Ex. 3 - “Dowtin urself will p much b the reason u dnt try.”*

*Ex 4. - “If u dowt yrself, u wont even try.”*

All of the above examples are, of course, bastardised versions of the Bard’s infamous quote, but the crux is, the reasoning, the meaning behind the sentence, remains. It matters not that the language shifts, the communication remains. 

Grant me freedom to make a quick note, more in an excuse to sweep over it, than to delve into it. That very quote, can be translated into any language, and though the direct translation may differ, as the general tonality in languages differ greatly, the meaning will remain. For example, Farsi is a language in which intensity is greater than that of the English language – the highs are immense and euphoric, the lows are despairing, utter nadir, tragedy – and in this, their thinking and worldview may differ than that of other cultures. Yet, the quote can be read and understood in its form. This is true to all the modern languages, and let me make quick reference to the modern alphabets; the Latin, Arabic, and Bengali alphabet, Chinese characters and Devanagari – most of what we know around the world all full under these umbrella forms of communication, yet, they are but simple filters in which we, as a unified race, process and perceive the world. Nothing more, nothing less.

And this is where I would like to segway into our next step, in which we approach the discovery.

**\~Body Language and Visual Understanding\~**

Body language is an entirely different form of communication. A nod or shake of the head, though not vastly different in their manner, quite literally mean the opposite in communication. A wince and a grimace indicates one is not feeling well. A hand on the tummy and an exhalation can mean, depending on context, that you’ve ate your fill and can’t finish another bite, or that you’ve exercised too much, and need some respite, or that you’re feeling ill – potentially about to vomit. A shuffling gait and slumped shoulders conveys to even complete strangers that you’ve had a long day and you’re tired. A furtive glance across a bar can indicate attraction. A wide-shoulders, puffed-out chest – whether natural or enforced – almost always indicates confidence. Even something so much as hands behind the back gives an air of authority, a hand on the chin is deep thought, frantic gesticulating expresses excitement, or anxiety, or a stressed-disposition – mostly defined by the facial features and tone that goes with them.

Even on top of that, fashion is an extension of communication. Someone wearing a suit naturally gives off an officious air, whereas a police uniform (in direct intention) displays authority. This very communication, as if plucked directly from certain species in the animal kingdom (which is the next step), is so intrinsic in our understanding, that should we see two men standing side by side, naked, only their stance and body language can give us hint of what personality is within. Yet, place those same two people side by side, but one is donned in a flowing black gown, bench wig and gavel, whilst the other is wearing a bright orange jumpsuit, perhaps with hands bound – the status of the two, in a glimpse, is easily identifiable.

That is language. That is how different it can be.

We are so in tune with these signals that we barely recognise it as a language at all. There is an entire sub-conscious in most of our brains that read, with avarice, the social cues of others. You can see your colleague, pre-coffee, is irritated and know not to approach. It is infused in your reading of the world and its inhabitants.

I will make one last point, as I fear reverting to my educational roots is but a form of procrastination. Consider all the above, in which we have, ever so swiftly, swept over the fact that communication can be vastly different. We accept that over myriad centuries, language in its very essence evolves. We have accepted that even of all the modern languages, and their immense differences, the core concept of each being used to funnel human understanding is the prime goal. We have also spoken about communication in gesture and body language, and even as far as attire – and what message it plants in our minds. 

All of this, though vast and worthy of the limitless studies and books, is but a fraction of the languages in today’s world. Putting aside our understanding of ancient languages, and the insights they’ve opened of civilisations long wiped out and extinct. Putting aside tools such as the Rosetta stone, and the wealth of primers around the globe, and even the methods of understanding numbers. Putting aside bizarre methods (to a modern eye, no matter where they are in the world) such a quipu, in which information is recorded in a series of coloured strings and knots. Put all that aside, as, ultimately, that is *human* language.

 

**\~The Animal Kingdom\~**

When we delve into that of the animal kingdom, and entirely new universe opens to us. Elephants that communicate on a frequency so low (20 hertz), which can reach their kin up to six miles away, but ultimately cannot be heard – though often felt – by the likes of us. Rodents, such as the Tarsiers, which on the opposite end of the scale, give off screeches at such a high-frequency (70-90k hertz), that all we can perceive is open-mouthed silence – yet others of their species can easily prick up their ears and hear one another above the jungle melody. 

There are hippos that communicate, almost exclusively, through their excrement. Cephalopods that give off dire warnings with the ever-changing camouflage, whereas other, more social sub-species that travel and hunt together, can not only use their shifting colours to organise and direct one another, but have been seen to give off warning with one side of their body to fend off foes, whilst simultaneously using their other side to indicate welcome/approach/encourage allies. (Think of a school crossing patrol officer holding that ‘lollipop staff’ up to approaching cars, whilst winding their arm for the children to cross the road.) There are species of whales that communicate in the unknown depths via tragically beautiful cries and almost alien coda (clicks), that upon observation, we have discovered something akin to accents between whales of the same species – but originating from different packs.

Prairie dogs have been observed loosing cries at different frequencies to indicate various warnings. An eagle, a hyena, a lion, a scorpion, a human – so on, and so forth. They have been observed to alter their cries based on the threat, or bounty respectively. And not only that, but there have been studies in which these wonderful little critters are known to be incredibly descriptive in their cries; a study in which humans repeatedly approached a single colony, but in different coloured shirts was undertaken, and the findings showed they would alternate their cries based on the colour of shirts.

Mole rats are known to thud at their tunnels to communicate sub-terra. Endless insects communicate with pheromones; simple smells that give detailed information from one to another; similar to dogs leaving urine to mark territory. Grasshoppers rub wings together, to create a song for their potential mates or to fend off rivals. Butterflies spread their wings and colourings in certain patterns that convey information from one to the other, (and as a bonus educational titbit, there are colours within their wings that we can’t see, but other butterflies can – so that boring monochromed insect fluttering about that petal may look mundane compared to others you have seen, but its own species can detect a world of colour that you cannot). Honeybees dance, birds sing and tweet, lions roar, dolphins click, cats meow, fireflies pulse their glow like Morse Code, amoebas break down molecules, so on, so forth.

Each of these forms of communication have been a hot topic for the sciences since well before recorded human history, and though we are in a time that we understand infinitely more than we have known hitherto now, there is still much and more. And as well-versed as I am in all forms of communications, in codes, in cyphers and elevating the study of communication to well beyond what others have achieved, there is only one of me.

And I wish that weren’t the case, for I need someone of my brilliance to challenge me, to work against me, to offer an antithesis, and debunk the discovery I am to share.

**\~End of Lesson\~**

\* 

If you read the lesson, I trust you now understand when I say languages and communication are infinite, there is never a definite when it comes to even the most established tongue or mode, and across all the species in the animal kingdom – and those that live on the outskirts of it – the method of conveying information is so malleable, that what makes perfect sense to one, is almost alien to another. 

And thus, we must finally approach the point.

Part 2 shall be shared tomorrow, in which I disclose the discovery,
