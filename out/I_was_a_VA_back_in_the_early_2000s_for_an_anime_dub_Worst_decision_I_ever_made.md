I'd always wanted to be a voice actor. 

For cartoons, especially. 

I didn't get my big break until I was given a titular role, the English dub of a well known and beloved face. 

I grew up watching the original, so you can bet I jumped at the chance of becoming part of such a well known and extremely popular voice. Cartoon voices are hard to perfect. Because cartoons are not real people, and can be twisted and moulded into quite literally anything. When I started voicing, I had a lot of fun. 

The original didn't take himself too seriously, so I could let loose and channel a lot of myself into him. I remember having a bizarre first day. The producers told me to get a real sense of the world, immersing myself in the source material. 

Before heading into the studio, I had some time to relax in my car and listen to the radio. I was getting in the zone, trying to psyche myself up, when someone banged on my window. I looked up from the pages spread out on my dashboard. 

There was a guy standing outside, slamming his fists into the window. 

Dressed in a trench coat over filthy jeans and t-shirt, a grin stretched across his lips, this kid looked out of his fucking mind. I pretended not to see the loose bandages poking from underneath his baseball cap, loose dark hair falling in half lidded eyes. There were strange markings across his forehead, like he'd been wearing a really tight baseball cap. 

Damn, this kid was going through it. 

I thought I could ignore him, sipping my coffee and pretending not to see him. But he just pounded harder. 

Eventually, I rolled up the window, poking my head out. 

He stumbled back, eyes widening, like the kid wasn't expecting me to react to him trying to break my fucking windows. 

"You good?" I said, after waiting for him to say something. He didn’t, just staring at me, wide eyed. I think this was the first time someone had genuinely freaked me out. I don't know what it was about this guy. He was college aged, maybe, a few years younger than me. But his eyes were dark. Hollow. They had aged way beyond his mid-twenties. I noticed he was bouncing on his heels, unable to keep still. He played with his hands, tangling his fingers together like they were a puzzle, his frenzied gaze flicking from me, and then behind him. 

"Hey," I softened my tone, and he jumped. "Do you need help, man?" 

Immediately, he shook his head. But he did pull something out of his pocket, a crumpled scrap of paper, spreading it out on the window. I leaned forward to read it. The writing was barely decipherable, a manic scribble I had to squint to make out. 

"You need to RUN."

He had underlined **RUN** three times. 

I nodded slowly, cranking down the volume on the radio. "Right," I said. "Run from what?" 

I wasn't expecting him to pull out a pen, and scribble an answer on the paper. 

"THERE." 

He turned and pointed to the studio, and an involuntary shiver crept its way down my spine. It never really hit me that he could have worked there. The guy straightened up, stabbing his index finger into his throat, shaking his head. 

"You can't speak?" 

*No*, he mouthed. The boy stabbed at his Adam's apple. *They took my--*

He started writing again, and I noticed his hands were trembling. 

It was 8:30am. I was barely awake, already nervous. 

Before he could finish, though, I was done. I politely told him I needed to go. Then I wound the windows down and drove three times around the block.

When I got back to the studio, the guy was gone. I figured he was on drugs, or maybe a salty rejection. I didn't think about him again until I was maybe two or three months into my gig. The role was definitely challenging, but fun too. There was a certain line I had to scream, like REALLY scream. Like I said, cartoons and animated characters can do pretty much anything. Luckily, unlike some of my colleagues, my character was just a regular Joe. Ish. What they wanted out of me was a scream. A fucking ripping, gun wrenching thing that I couldn't perfect, no matter how hard I tried. 

The problem was, or what I tried to get across, was the scream wasn't human. 

The original subbed voice actor did an insane job. Something I couldn't replicate. 

It came right from the gut, wrangling it's up like a tendril wrapped around my spinal cord, my spine, and then leeching to my brain. I tried changing my voice, going deeper to try and express anger, and then higher for a more comedic effect. I even tried drinking to loosen myself up a bit, and some method acting, when the producer started getting impatient. "Punch him in the face," the guy reading lines with me was told.

My colleague looked taken aback, hiding behind his mic stand. He did, after I reassured him that if being in pain was what it took to finally get this right, then so be it. Method acting at its finest. He punched me so hard my nose bled for five minutes. This guy had a mean right hook. I was still scratching dried flakes of blood off of my script hours later, when I was home. 

But still, my voice wasn't good enough. 

I was fired, I thought. They needed someone who could take their voice across that barrier, from human, to something else entirely. They wanted someone to really embody the  confusion and fury in this voice. That wasn't me. Still though, I was willing to try pretty much anything. We had been talking about bringing in a voice coach, so I was excited to see if it worked out. 

I walked into my usual session, script in hand, when I found myself face to face with my voice coach, an ancient old man in a black suit. He held a briefcase, and something twisted in the root of my gut. 

Behind him was what I thought was a Halloween decoration; a reclining rubber chair with velcro straps attached. 

But it was fucking July.

Why would they have this in July? 

All I had to do was glance at my colleagues standing with varying shades of horror on their faces, for me to know that it was for me. My voice coach stepped forward with a wide smile, and I was already stumbling back. "No." I was looking at the straps on the bed, and the stained headrest. I could still see blood ingrained into rough plastic. Whoever this psycho was, he had other clients. 

The crazy kid's expression hit me, suddenly. 

He couldn't speak. 

*They took my--*

I stared at the head straps hanging from the chair. 

You've gotta be fucking kidding me. 

A lot of things were running through my head at that moment. 

But I didn't get a chance to question it. It was just  another form of voice acting. That is what my voice coach told me when I tried to kick him in the face, only for my legs to be strapped down. Then my arms. The lights were dimmed, and my script was brought in front of me. 

Method acting, I thought dizzily, when my voice coach stepped in front of me, snapping on two pairs of rubber gloves. The tips were stained sharp red, a detail he made clear, taking his time to slip them onto his hands. It was to incite real fear, was what he told me calmly. 

And it did. I screamed, real and raw, a proper cry clawing from my throat. 

He opened up his briefcase, skimming his index down a silver of sharp blades, all in different sizes. Picking one up, my voice coach delicately pricked the edge. There was a slowness he seemed to thrive in, moving like the world had come to a standstill. Every movement jolted my body pinned to the chair. 

I understood the importance of method acting. 

But… *this?* 

My own thoughts were barely comprehensible, as I struggled against tough restraints. This was another level of method acting. The script was in front of me, my lines written in block letters. But I couldn't… read them. Register them. Understand them. They resembled nothing, words with no meaning, directions with no real body. 

"I would like you to scream for me," My voice coach murmured into my ear. 

I stubbornly kept my mouth shut, until his fingers wound around the scruff of my scalp. "I was given strict instructions," the man hummed. "I was told to make you scream. Which is what I am good at."

I wasn't paying attention to what he was doing until I felt it, silver teeth scaring across my scalp. Initially, he teased, before pressing real pressure. 

Something hot and wet trickled down the back of my neck, and just the feeling of it contorted my throat, a screech volleying to tear from my lips.

He started with the bone saw, cutting deep down, until I could no longer think– and when I did think, my thoughts were nothing. 

When that wasn't enough, he started inserting fingers. 

At first, I barely felt it because of the shock, my body numb, my gaze stuck to the ceiling. There was no fight or flight response. My head lolled to the side. My first reaction was a pained whimper, which got them excited. 

It was raw, *agonising*. 

Exactly what they wanted. 

I could feel his gloved hands reaching into the cavern in my skull. The bandages clumsily wrapped around my head. His finger prodded at the raw bone, and I screamed again, my body jolting, and then lunging forwards. I felt it like a feral hunger, a desperation, to escape.

"Keep going," the voice came from across the room, and something inside me snapped. They stood around me, a crowd of shadowy faces watching me flail and cry like a child. They still wanted that scream. Movement in the doorway. Liam. 

He had just been hired. His eyes were wide, unseeing, his phone pressed to his ear. His lips moved into what I thought was, *I'm getting help* before a hand wound its way around his mouth. He was yanked back, and I was alone, my body, my lungs, being moulded into a machine. 

"**Keep going**," the voices ordered, gruffer this time. 

"Fuck you." was all I managed to sputter. 

**Rage.**

I felt it bubbling up inside me, and I knew that is exactly what they wanted.

They wanted rage. Agony. They wanted my voice to not just find my own inner turmoil, but *his*, too. Spitting out a mouthful of blood, mulling the tinge of rusted metal, I squeezed my eyes shut. 

*If I say the line, maybe he'll stop.* 

It was a naive thought, a desperate attempt at reassuring myself that a time would exist in the future– where I wouldn't be in that chair, strapped down like an animal, while some psychotic fuck dug around in my skull. This time he pressed two fingers, calmly letting me know that he was almost through to my brain, and would begin threading his index through surface tissue, until I gave them the scream they wanted. It wasn't just his actions. It was his words.

The way he spoke, revelling in every word. Every connotation of his voice. 

Shifting in the chair, I sensed the microphone inches from my mouth, the shield grazing my lips. I started to say my lines, at first, dull, with no emotion, until the man inserted more fingers, and calmly let me know he was ready to use a scalpel. The thought of it sent me into full, numb panic. His presence, his words, had already moulded me into nothing. 

It was when he stroked the blade across the back of my head, dragging the point across my scalp and teasing it near the insertion point— that was when I screamed. I screamed until my throat was ignited, my lungs were on fire, and my body was no longer my own, rattling, convulsing, beneath me. 

I screamed. I don't even think they were my lines. They were gibberish. Words. 

Words, spluttering from my mouth in sharp rivulets of red pooling down my chin. 

I was still screaming, my mind numb, when a voice rang out, and the blade was withdrawn from my skull. But I couldn't see. I couldn't see until cool hands were grasping hold of my face, as I tried to blink through fog, trying to find a face. Liam. His eyes were hollowed out, hands shaking on my restraints, trying and failing to free me. 

The sound tech and producer were smiling, telling me I did a great job. 

When Liam barfed suddenly, violently heaving up his guts and dropping to his knees, he was attended to, ironically, better than me. While I choked on blood, the back of my fucking skull gaping open, my colleague was treated like a kicked puppy on the side of the road. 

They told me it was over. 

But I was still screaming, thrashing side to side. At some point, I bit him. I slammed my head into a faceless shadow who came at me with a shot. 

*The kid who tried to warn me*, was all I could think. 

He tried to tell me... 

*That they had ripped out his voice.*

"I think we've got it!" a voice splintered through my cries. 

Needless to say, I quit the next day. I did such a *great* job, the bastards didn't cut out my voice, like the other victims. I had to sign a lot of fucking paperwork to keep my mouth shut. But hey, the gag order runs out this week. 

So, I can say whatever I want.
