I’ve walked the same trail every Sunday for the past two years of my life.

It’s not some epic or unnaturally beautiful place, neither is it a very popular tourist destination – just a quiet, forested path tucked behind an old maintenance road near the edge of town. The kind of place that’s not marked on a map, but everyone seems to know about it.

I guess most people might call it boring and repetitive after a while – no one visits it more than twice due to the predictability of the place. To me, that’s kind of the point.

Sometimes I’ll pass a jogger or someone walking their dog, but more often than not, it’s just me and the trees. There’s a rhythm to it – a wooden sign at the trailhead, the curve of the hill at the two-mile mark, and the clearing with the flat boulder that catches late-morning sun. I could probably walk it with my eyes closed by now.

That’s why it was so strange when everything abruptly changed.

I started around 10 A.M., like always. Weather was overcast but calm – the kind of gray sky that never quite becomes rain. The air smelled like moss and old bark, soft and a little sweet. Everything looked… perfectly normal at first.

But by the time I hit the first fork in the trail, I noticed the slight differences. Like the trees were a little too dense. The undergrowth off the path looked higher than usual. Subtle things that are easy to dismiss – and so I did. “Whatever”, I thought to myself. Wish I would’ve listened to my gut from the start.

Then I passed the creek and didn’t hear it.

It was there; I could see the water moving – but the sound was off. It was muted, like it was farther away than it looked. I stopped for a second, trying to figure out if I’m going deaf, and listened to the wind. Then I realized there *wasn’t* any wind.

Everything was still.

Not peaceful, “forest morning” still, but deafening silence, uncomfortable still.

The feeling passed after a few minutes and I kept on walking. I knew this trail better than my own neighborhood and I’ll be damned if I give up before reaching the boulder.

That’s why I noticed it immediately when the clearing was gone.

There used to be a spot just before the three-mile marker where the trail opened up. Wide, grassy, shaped like a hollow bowl. I always stopped there for water. Sat on the flat gray boulder and listened to the birds, watched the trees sway with the wind.

This time, the trail just… kept going.

The trees were too close together, like someone had dragged the forest inward while I wasn’t looking. I didn’t see the boulder, there was no sunlight, no birds and no wind. Just dense, unbroken wood.

I stopped – this time finally realizing something was wrong. Checked my GPS which showed I was exactly where I should be.

But the trail ahead wasn’t familiar anymore.

And the trail behind looked darker than before.

I stood there longer than I should’ve, staring at where the clearing was supposed to be. I mumbled something under my breath about how this can’t be possible.

Eventually, I took a few steps forward and tried to come up with rational explanations for all this. I told myself I was remembering wrong, although that seemed impossible due to how frequently I come here. Maybe the maintenance crew rerouted something – though I didn’t recall any signs of recent work. The undergrowth still lingered in my mind. Could it be erosion?

It made no sense. Especially when I saw the new trail markers.

I saw the first one nailed into a pine about five minutes later. A wooden plaque, cracked down the middle, with peeling orange paint and coordinates carved by hand (not stamped – carved). They were shaky lines, as if someone had been in a hurry.

I’d never seen it before, I would’ve remembered.

I checked the GPS again, just to make sure I wasn’t going crazy. Same location. Still on my regular path. And yet, nothing on the screen matched what I was seeing.

The stillness and unnatural silence persisted – it began making me anxious. 

*Where am I?*

I slowly turned around, looking back the way I’d come, expecting comfort from the familiarity. But the trail behind me changed – the undergrowth was too thick, the trunks even closer together. It looked… older, like no one had walked it in years.

But that couldn’t be. I had just come through there.

I stood still for a moment, my heart beating a little faster that I wanted to admit. I turned toward the path ahead, and while it didn’t look much better, it still looked like a *trail*. Sort of.

I made a decision.

If something was wrong with the woods, or if someone had messed with the markers or rerouted the trail for some reason, I needed to find where the two paths split. Maybe someone set up new signage and I’d gotten turned around somewhere.

I’d keep walking for another fifteen minutes at most. If I didn’t find a familiar bend, structure or marker, I’d turn around and retrace my steps. That felt reasonable – though maybe I just wanted to prove I wasn’t going insane.

Five minutes passed. Then ten. And fifteen.

Nothing I remembered. No bends, fences, signs – just the same overgrowth, same uneven slope. And distant voices.

They were faint, just up ahead – too soft to make out, but loud enough for me to know there was someone here. “Hello?” I called out, which broke the silence around me.

The voices stopped.  

Not faded, but abruptly seized.

I stood still for a while, listening and waiting for footsteps, rustling, anything.

But there was nothing.

I turned in a slow circle, thinking about what to do next – my mind blanked.

But I noticed another path – one leading to a clearing ahead that looked unnatural. It was way too circular and clean for it to be in this forest. The trees arched inward around it like ribs.

It felt more intentional than natural. It had to be man-made.

I should’ve walked away, but part of me wanted answers. I told myself from there I could get a better look, maybe spot a trail I missed.

I stepped into the clearing.

It took more than a moment for me to realize the light had shifted.

The sun was still out, but the shadows had changed. They were all pointing *toward me.* Every single one.

I took a step back – behind me, I heard a creak.

It came from underneath – like branches were moving inside the ground, making room for me.

I turned around and the trail back was gone. The way I’d come from was now a solid wall of trees – thick, old and impassable.

As I moved, the shadows moved with me, not giving me room to breathe. Behind the shadows, I saw something. Not a person or a creature, but trees. Trees that were turning toward me. Their trunks didn’t move, but their faces did – faces that were shaped in the bark in slow, pulsing knots. Patterns formed around them: perfect spirals, slits and knots.

Dozens of them.

*Eyes*. None blinked, but all were facing me now.

Watching.

I ran.

I didn’t plan it or pick a direction – just moved forward.

Although the trees were dense, I slipped between them, tearing branches off. The shadows followed, their gazes not leaving me.

I needed distance. But how do you run away of something you’re inside of?

The forest resisted – the trees shifted behind me, the undergrowth rose higher, roots tripped at my heels. But I kept running.

Branches whipped my arms, something snapped past my ear – could’ve been a branch or a whisper, I’m not sure. I didn’t look back because I didn’t want to know what was behind me.

The light changed. It was brighter for a moment, then it suddenly disappeared as if someone covered the sun up.

I pushed through a narrow gap in the trees, heart thudding and my lungs burning. Another clearing.

No, not another. It was the same clearing, identical to the one I just ran from.

I didn’t move. I didn’t breathe. The shadows around me, still following, leaned closer in anticipation.

Then, from somewhere behind me, I heard something. A quiet chirping. Birdsong.

Soft, fragile and, unironically, music to my ears. After all that silence, it truly felt like oxygen. I *needed* it.

I turned toward it and ran.

Again, the eyes of the forest followed, trying to capture me. The ground moved beneath my feet, making an effort to slow me. Still, I pushed through brush and shadow, following that single sound like it was the only thing left in the world – and in that moment, it really was.

Then suddenly, the trees thinned out.

No grand exit or “light at the end of the forest”. They just… stopped being dense.

And I stumbled out onto the trailhead. Gravel scraped my hand as I caught myself. But I knew where I was – the wooden sign I pass every week. The tree with “F + P” carved into it. It was finally all so familiar to me.

I stood up and turned around.

The trail I’d come through was still there. It was silent, unmoving. The quietest part of the entire forest.

I don’t know how I escaped. Maybe it let me go. Maybe I wasn’t worth keeping. Maybe I got lucky.

Either way, I haven’t been back since.

And sometimes, I wonder if I ever really left.

Because that part of the forest – the one that shouldn’t exist – I still see it sometimes. Just beyond the real trails.
