*This sordid tale deserves a trigger warning, as it involves euthanasia, and multiple deaths of extremely vulnerable patients due to compliance with government policies. There is also child death, but it's not by abuse. Survivors of Hurricane Katrina should take extra care when reading this.*

 &nbsp; 


God help me. I can’t handle the grief, terror, and suffering any longer. I have to confess to my unforgivable transgressions. I’m the worst type of person out there - a murderer whose weapon is medical malpractice. How could I? It was my life dream to *help* people, not hurt them! When I chose to become a doctor, I did so with the intention to save lives. I took an official oath to do no harm. My life centered around that oath for fifteen years. It was a code to live by. It was the epitome of my existence in some ways. But everything changed in September of 2017. 

 &nbsp; 

At the time, I was working at a Puerto Rican hospital by the name of Hospital Junto Al Mar (*English: Oceanside Hospital*). It was a large facility, with 900 beds, that provided every medical service for both acute and long-term care. We had a level 1 trauma center. Surgeons and nurses were always available. Of course, just because it was built to tend to every dire need a person might have, doesn’t mean that this care was necessarily good. Hospital Junto Al Mar was a government hospital, funded by politicians that like to be “frugal,” to put it kindly. But I digress… 

 &nbsp; 

Sadly, Hospital Junto Al Mar doesn’t exist anymore. Hurricane Maria obliterated it. The storm ravaged us. The death toll was 3,059. Buildings were reduced to cracked foundations. The winds tore off rooftops, and they blew away in a similar manner to dandelion seeds being carried away in a summer breeze. The entire territory went dark, and quiet. We had no power, and in our hospital at least, the backup generator had failed. This might sound familiar to you, especially with the older generations. That’s because it was history repeating itself. 

 &nbsp; 

Twelve years prior, New Orleans Memorial Hospital found themselves in a similar horrific scenario during Hurricane Katrina. When the levees broke, New Orleans Memorial Hospital was stranded for five days without rescue, until finally being retrieved by a rescue mission that would not save everyone. Everyone had to be out by midnight. Those that weren’t evacuated in time would be left behind. The doctors were so terrified about the potentially cruel deaths awaiting those they’d be leaving behind, they decided to hasten their deaths with a lethal injection to spare them such a fate. 


 &nbsp; 

It was a source of controversy. Some considered it murder, others considered it mercy. Criminal charges were filed that were then later dropped. When the criminal charges fell through, the lawsuits began. The doctors who hastened their dying patients’ deaths were slammed by an endless barrage of civil lawsuits. They had to face the medical board, and potentially lose their license. It was a tragic situation that was faced with severe punishment for the people that had been left to fend for themselves in such hopeless circumstances. I’m sure you are beginning to realize the severity of the consternation that was approaching when I say that history was repeating itself. 

 &nbsp; 

In 2017, this current hospital disaster was beginning to draw an eerie parallel line to such a terrifying situation. Even the lack of US aid was the same! We didn’t see FEMA for weeks. The world saw the carnage on the cameras, featuring we, the victims who were enduring it. This was not enough to convince the government to lend a sorely needed helping hand. Our country had forsaken us. Help was not coming, or if it did, it would not come in time. Towards the end, were one hundred upright medical workers, who were handling both the pre-existing patients, and the dramatic influx of patients that had been maimed and displaced from the storm. 

 &nbsp; 

Here’s where the story begins… 

 &nbsp; 

When the hurricane hit our hospital, we knew this was going to be a difficult ride. The wind was uprooting half-century old trees, tearing off the concrete and clay roofs from the houses that were built to weather the worst of storms, and the rain was coming up to our waists. Our Level 1 Trauma center was overflowing with brutally injured people. I even saw one patient with a muddy metal rod protruding from his abdomen. Somehow, he survived. Despite the calamity, the beginning was certainly an uneasy situation, but not catastrophic. We relied on our backup generators, and simply rationed the medicine until rescue came. 

 &nbsp; 

It wasn’t ideal. It was especially felt in the psych ward, when we had to start giving the severely psychotic patients half of their medicine. Even with this setback, we were still standing. It certainly wasn’t a situation that we *wanted* to put our patients in, but it was doable. With all of the carnage going on, we could see that it might be a day or two before rescue came. That was okay. We had backup generators and a system for administering medicine, which meant that we could still hold our own in some fashion. 

 &nbsp; 

* But then day 2 became day 3. 

* Day 3 became day 4. 

* **Day 5 was when the backup generators failed, meaning there weren’t enough staff to keep everyone alive.** 

* Day 5 became day 7, when we could no longer just ration the medicine. 

* Day 9 involved more people dying than living. 

* Day 10 was the day of rescue, which only ended in cruel and unjustified deaths. 

 &nbsp; 

During the first four days of the storm, spirits were somewhat dampened, but were lifted with the unexpected company of a few furry friends. In the chaos, we somehow ended up being a safe haven for house pets as well. A veterinary hospital sent them our way. Many of them were friendly, and they helped lighten the mood. My favorite was an orange tabby cat that I named “Louisa.” She’d sit on my lap while I looked at my charts, and followed me about when I was doing my rounds. It was nice to have a furry friendly face during such a dreadful storm. 

 &nbsp; 

The patients enjoyed the other pets as well. It was essentially an unexpected therapy animal visit that lasted longer than a few hours. There were animals that were too hostile, and we had to leave them in their cages. It certainly made for an interesting beginning to an unpleasant week. Like I said, the first four days were antsy, but we were still holding our own. It was tiresome to constantly check the backup generators, make sure to feed the animals, and figure out a plan for aftercare for the patients whose health we were about to damage due to the rationing. We wrote sticky notes in the charts with reminders to write referrals once we got through this dreadful affair. 

 &nbsp; 

**Then came day five.** 

 &nbsp; 

Day five was the beginning of the end. The backup generators failed. A hospital without electricity isn’t merely a situation where the lights were out… it’s impending death for those who rely on electric-charged medical machinery. Comatose patients on a respirator machine can’t afford a black out. When the machine dies out, you need oxygen masks, breathing tubes, and a manual resuscitator bag that has to be used by hand. Medical personnel has to do the breathing for them. 

 &nbsp; 

The second the lights went out for good, the eighty patients in our coma ward began to asphyxiate. The ideal nurse to patient ratio is 1:4. We were an underfunded hospital in the middle of one of the deadliest hurricanes to hit us in years. We had a nurse to patient ratio of 1:7. In other words, we had eleven nurses that were available to save the lives of eighty patients. It just wasn’t possible. 

 &nbsp; 

They wheezed, gasped, and gurgled, until they went quiet. Roughly fifteen minutes later, the pitch dark ward, which was usually filled with the sound of beeping machines and soft inhales and exhales from unconscious patients, was dead silent. Eighty people lay dead in their hospital beds, and there was nothing we could do about it. The coma ward was not the only place to have an immediate extinction, but it’s the only one I’m going to elaborate on. 

 &nbsp; 

I will not discuss NICU ward. Even in a tale as raw, honest, and vulnerable as the one I am attempting to tell, there are limits. Preemies need warmth to survive. The electricity meant the warmth was gone. You can come to the correct, tragic, and horrifying conclusion from that statement alone. 

 &nbsp; 

##Moving on, with two medical wards totally void of life, decisions needed to be made to prevent the other hospital wards from following in pursuit. Triage. 

 &nbsp; 

For those that don’t understand triage, it’s sorting out the patients that are top priority. Have you ever been to an ER and spoken to a triage nurse? Her job is to determine who needs medical assistance the most. The person with the failing kidney gets seen before the person with a sprained ankle, as the person with the failing kidney is minutes away from death without immediate intervention. Unfortunately, in cases where hundreds of people are severely injured at one time and in immediate danger, triage is reversed. 

 &nbsp; 

The most likely to survive get the medicine. It’s not to be evil. It’s not because we feel that the more vulnerable deserve to be left to die. It’s because there aren’t enough people and supplies to go around. The person with the failing kidney was left to die, because the other person with a scrape that’s only barely showing signs of infection is more likely to live. There were no means to save them both, and we want at least one person to live. 

 &nbsp; 

Disaster triage is a medical worker’s worst nightmare, because we are forced into the position of playing God, after God had clearly forsaken us. Fortunately, nobody likes having to do a disaster triage, so we plan thoroughly ahead: backup generators, a storage area containing extra medical supplies and surgical kits, and rigorous yearly training for disaster situations. Playing God does not have to happen. Even the busiest days at the ER are exhausting, but can be managed. That’s not to say that there aren’t times where we are forced to pick and choose in certain dire situations, but the burden of denying a plethora of dying people medicine was not a burden to weigh on our shoulders… until it was. 

 &nbsp; 

Five days into a lethal hurricane, two entire medical wards lacked living patients. More mangled patients were coming in. We were swamped, and had dwindling supplies. Our worst nightmare had sprung to life, and it was time to face it. It was time to play God. We couldn’t save everyone, there simply weren't enough resources. The statistics in our circumstances were utterly terrifying: 

&#x200B;

* 80% of these patients would live if they had medication. 
* We only had enough for 50%.

 &nbsp; 

The days that followed were gruesome. We no longer had the comforting excuse of not being manned enough to replace over a hundred failed electrical machines. Everyone that died from that point on was because we killed them by medical negligence. We were forced to put together a makeshift morgue… and decided who to put in it. All of the remaining personnel, myself included, looked at our charts from our flashlights, and tried to determine who of the moderately to severely injured/sick was most likely to live. If we weren’t sure, we’d do a draw. It was a lethal lottery that the unwilling participants were forced to play.  

 &nbsp; 
 
The terminal cancer patients were first, as they had no chance of surviving from their afflictions, hurricane or not. We gave them medicine for the pain, of course, but we no longer administered any legitimate treatment. They were going to die. Liver dialysis came after that. We did not have the means to continue it. We loaded them up with the safest amount of morphine, despite the fact that these people were about to die. Then it was those on the verge of death from heart disease. 

 &nbsp; 

One by one, each category of illness to end up in our morgue was chosen and abandoned accordingly. It was systematic, and organized. We had charts that marked when to stop administering legitimate treatment, and to who. The cruelest part was that our patients knew nothing. 

 &nbsp; 

We left the ones that would’ve survived to die, while inflicting the cruelty of false reassurances to keep everyone calm. 

&#x200B;

“You’re going to be just fine!”

*You’re going to die.*

&#x200B;

“We’re giving you medicine right now!”

*It’s saline.*

&#x200B;

“This tag just marks you so the nurses know what medicine to give!”

*You’re marked as one that we have chosen to abandon.*

 &nbsp; 

We worked ourselves to the bone, and beyond that. Our proverbial knuckles were chipped and eroding away against the grindstone - filing them down to nothing. We had no water, electricity, food, and medicine. This disaster had turned a place of refuge into a morgue, filled with those who had naturally succumbed to the circumstances, as well as those we were forced to kill by inaction. 

 &nbsp; 

On day 10, euthanasia crossed our minds. We had everything needed to give them a more peaceful passing… but we couldn’t. This is where the parallel to Memorial Hospital took a turn and followed a different trajectory. We learned from Memorial Hospital during Hurricane Katrina - some acts of mercy will never be seen as such, nor will they ever be forgiven. We’d be put in prison for first degree murder, lose our medical licenses, and be bombarded with civil lawsuits for killing them through an IV drip. We’d be accused of violating our oath to do no harm. 

 &nbsp; 

One’s sense of morality tends to falter when the consequence is severe legal action. We did not want to go to prison, or be stripped of our licenses. Therefore, we killed our patients in the way that society perceived the oath to do no harm… despite knowing inside that the actions we were about to take were gross violations of the true meaning of our hippocratic oath. We killed our patients by allowing them to die on their own - writhing in agony, wheezing from dehydration, and begging for help that we were only pretending to provide. The situation grew worse when help finally arrived. 

 &nbsp; 

Hospital officials and FEMA informed us that the evacuation would prioritize the healthy first (as is disaster triage), and would end at exactly midnight. Everyone else would be left behind. No exceptions. There were at least one hundred bedridden patients that we couldn’t carry to the boats. Obviously, not everyone that was still alive would be rescued, and the conditions of the facility were too dangerous for any medical personnel to stay behind and expect to live. 

 &nbsp; 

As if this wasn’t sick and twisted enough, rescue officials had to twist the knife in deeper. Apparently it was crueler to leave animals in a cage to starve than it was to abandon vulnerable patients in a shut down hospital during a lethal hurricane. Officials would be letting them out of their cages, even the aggressive ones that we had locked away for a reason. This was also similar to Memorial Hospital, but our parallel took a different turn. The staff at Memorial Hospital euthanized their patients before the animals were released. We didn’t, because it was illegal and “immoral.” 

 &nbsp; 

Thus, we made the "ethical" decision of leaving one hundred surviving patients behind, because they were too frail to take with us. Louisa sat comfortably in my lap, while a plethora of my fellow human beings began their descent into a hell on earth. Their only comfort was the morphine IV, but even that doesn’t last forever. Once it ran out, there was no one there to give them more. When the morphine ran out, they’d be brought back to their harrowing reality. Stuck in total darkness, their bodies writhing in agony, and their noses assaulted by the scent of the dead around them. It wouldn’t be a quiet death - they were bound to endure the screams of the other forsaken souls echoing off the walls, with the snarling and barking of the animals that were eating them alive. Triage without mercy. On the bright side, any ethics expert would firmly state that we stuck to the oath to do no harm!/s 

 &nbsp; 

I got on the last boat, and tearfully looked behind me at the mass grave we’d just created. Two of my colleagues were with me. We held hands, bowed our heads, and said a small prayer for their deaths to be as swift and painless as possible in such circumstances. Then we sat in an unbearably heavy silence, glaring at our saviors that had come far too late, and still had the audacity to prioritize time and money over human life. It's easy to blame others in a situation that involves gross injustice than it is to own up to your own involvement. To this day, I hate boats. 

 &nbsp; 

Of course, there’s something to understand. We can be angry at the government for putting us in this dilemma, but following the letter of the law instead of its spirit is a decision that we made for ourselves. This story isn’t a political statement. My colleagues and I had a choice to do right by the most vulnerable group of people, and we opted not to. We weren’t brave in the face of danger. We opted for compliance. It did not go unpunished. 

 &nbsp; 

After being rescued, I hit another dire circumstance that I could never be rescued from: guilt, and the ghosts of those I killed confronting me for my inhumane crimes against them. I never believed in paranormal activity until I fell asleep in the soft hotel bed that FEMA paid for as a means of appeasing our rage at their painfully slow response. I woke up that night with blood and grime on the walls, in the same stain patterns as the walls of the makeshift ward. 

 &nbsp; 

Faint screams came next, that almost sounded like a gentle gust of wind that would suddenly burst into a shriek at full volume. The shadowy figures of ghosts would briefly flicker from the corner of my eye. Speaking with my colleagues led to the bone-chilling revelation that I was not the only one. This was NOT a manifestation of my guilty subconscious. 

 &nbsp; 

The situation itself is horrific on its own: it is always a frightening situation when an oath to do no harm leads you at a crossroads, where both routes ultimately lead to the death of your patients. Both routes traveled are due to the doctor’s influence. We killed one hundred vulnerable patients that were in our care. That’s a fact, and like I said, a horror story on its own. But this terror increases tenfold when the devastation from our deadly decisions seek retribution every time we try to rest. They say there’s no rest for the wicked, these battered ghosts have seen to that. It’s entirely deserved. 

 &nbsp; 

From a societal and legal standpoint, we followed our oath to do no harm to the letter. Yes, we denied medicine, and left the doomed to die in the dark, alone, frightened, with medicine that would eventually permanently run out. BUT: we didn’t euthanize them. They technically died on their own. We only indirectly killed them by setting them up for an agonizing demise. Even still, it was not a death that was attributed to any injection that we gave them. Did we do no harm? Every official that sat from the comfort of their fully stocked and running hospital would gladly say we did not, and might even use our situation as a lesson plan for those that teach medicine. 

 &nbsp; 

I’m sorry to inform you that this isn’t a thought exercise, a musing, or a hypothetical that poses a nonexistent moral dilemma. Those that are removed from the conflict have the privilege of entertaining that question as such with no real consequences. We, however, have to provide a real, hard answer to the question: Did we do harm? *I* know the answer. Every desperate medical personnel working alongside me knows the answer as well: **We did harm.** The patients left behind knew they’d been abandoned… possibly even eaten alive when all of the animals were released from their cages. We did this to save ourselves. 

 &nbsp; 

I traded my morality for a clean legal slate. I’m just as much a villain in this. I see the patients in my dreams. They stare at me, blood dripping down their arms from their IV injections… a bag filled with blood as well. Their blood. When I look down at my hands, they are covered in it. When I look up again, they are gone, but there is a sentence etched into the wall behind them - written in blood just like everything else. 

 &nbsp; 


## *DO. NO. HARM.* 


 &nbsp; 

When I am awake, things are misplaced. I find my schedule 2 prescription pad (the pad used to write prescriptions for federally regulated substances) laying on the broken lanyard from my work ID at the now deceasedHospital Junto Al Mar. It’s a message: I could have easily provided the morphine for a humane and peaceful ending. That’s not the only way they send me subtle messages to remind me of my crimes. 

 &nbsp; 

Whenever I leave my laptop and come back to it, the Wikipedia page for the casualties of Hurricane Maria is on the screen. The lights flicker on and off, and sometimes electricity is turned off entirely. Sometimes there is an unexplainable, but distinct scent of death that comes out of nowhere. It lingers for an hour or so, and then fades away. I hear the moans and wails of fright and agony that I’d subjected to the patients I left behind. Seconds later, the rattling of metal cages as the hungry animals are allowed to roam free. 

 &nbsp; 

I am a law abiding citizen by the living court, but am the worst type of murderer in the land of the dead. I escaped one sentence to endure another. My sentence is to see the devastation from my crime at moments I am least expecting it - as a means of never having respite from that traumatic event. I killed my patients, in a way that inflicted the most serious type of harm. 

 &nbsp; 

My victims will never forgive me. I will never forgive myself. I should have followed my oath as it was intended to be used. I should have spit in the eye of the government that abandoned us. I should have loaded up those IVs with so much morphine, my patients were too high to know who and where they were before they died. I didn’t. I took the route of a coward. I can only hope that God can forgive me when my time comes. I’ve been living hell on earth as it is.
