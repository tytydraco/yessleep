"So what now?" Daniela asked me.


"Well we have to stop that thing- Dave now" I replied.


"WE? There's no way I'm fighting that thing." She replied back.


"I guess then I will have to" I said as I turned off the TV.


"Do you at least have a plan to deal with it? Let me at least tell you its weak points" She said to me while getting up , But almost falling to the floor.


"Take it easy , You got poisoned not too long ago" I said as I grabbed a chair for her to sit on.

She sat on the chair, Still being weakened by the poison.


"As for the weak points , It's the eye in the chest and head , isn't it?" I asked her


"How did you-"


"The egg died by getting stabbed in the eye and the head is a weak point for most creatures, It's not that hard to figure out." I interrupted her.


"Seems like there's not much I can help with after all huh" she said in a gloomy tone.


"That's not true , Maybe you can look around the house for a clue to where Jason is. I found a bike in the garage with few cans of gas , So I'll be using that to get to Dave." I said as I headed for the door.


"Aren't you forgetting something?" Daniela said as she grabbed the phone on the table and tossed it towards me.


"I already have one , You keep this one. My number is on there so call me if you find anything" I said as I tossed it back to her.


I got on the bike and started riding towards the place where I last saw Dave using the GPS on my phone.


There was a slight nice breeze , The kind you would want while riding a bike. The road was bumpy at times but it was fun. I was enjoying the ride , Afterall who knew what was coming next.


**4 hours later**


I was about 20 minutes away from the place, When I noticed a weird smell. The smell of blood.


Suddenly I was tackled by..... something. I fell off my bike and hit a tree. I looked up and there it was....Dave 


It started walking towards me , It got closer....and closer.....and closer..... Then I suddenly realised something was wrong. 


That thing was about half the size of Dave , Was it perhaps an offspring? But how did it grow so fast? Lots of questions but no time to think because it's coming right at me.


It suddenly dashed at me , I dodged but it hit my right arm. It was smaller than Dave , But also much faster due to its size.


My right arm was bleeding, I held it with my left arm. Then suddenly the symbols on my left arm started glowing red and......the wound on my right arm was healed. Not in the normal way , The blood had frozen stopping the bleeding.


Then it dashed at me again , But this time I got on my legs and jumped over it. While I'm the air , I turned my left arm into an axe and cut the creature in half vertically.


I defeated the creature , But I had no time to relax. I heard a "grrrrrr" sound behind me , I quickly looked back. Seems like Dave wasn't the type to be satisfied by one [offspring.](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnnaturalUniverse/s/ipsOMWkSkW)
