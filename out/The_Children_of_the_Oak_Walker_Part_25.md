“That’s weird.”

I crouched on the edge of a large, grassy area, the chest-high vegetation over our heads in this position, with various trails blazed through it by passing animals. The rest of the children waited behind me, hunched low on the balls of their feet, eyes to the clouds like wary rabbits watching for a hawk. The sky was clear and bright at noon, the temperature high enough to make me wish I could shrug off my jacket.

Lucille squatted next to my left, having attached herself to me so that she’d become my default shadow at this point. She eyed the lensatic compass in my hand, and the two of us frowned at it in hushed concern.

Swallowing a nervous gulp, I nodded in agreement with her statement, watching the needle of the compass twitch, spin, and change polarity every few seconds as if it were alive. “Must be a ton of electromagnetic radiation here. Better keep our eyes open. There could be freaks around.”

Today had proven to be gentler, the rain stopping sometime in the night. We’d all woken up close to nine the previous evening, sore, blister-ridden from our march, and hungry. I’d taken a small crew of six with some camping pots a few hundred yards off site and managed to heat up enough stewed beans to feed everyone before withdrawing to the factory. Our dinner hadn’t been a cheery affair, however; true to Chris’s words, the cookfire drew a small pack of Birch Crawlers, four juveniles from what I could tell, who prowled around outside for a long time. We had to sit in silence, bunched around our fire, and wait until the beasts gave up trying to find a way inside. Even after the predators left, Puppets clicked and chittered through the forest for hours, the white-eyed fiends scampering around the swamps to scoop out crayfish with their grimy hands. At one point, I spotted a lone Bengal Tiger by the western edge of the waterline, one of our old Carnivore Cove residents, with a new coat of thick brown-and-tan striped fur, and two long saber-like teeth protruding from its mouth. Speaker Crabs played their ghostly tunes late into the night, and Bone-Faced Whitetail bugled from somewhere further south, a symphony of the new world all blended in a sound both terrifying and fascinating to the wide-eyed urbanite kids.

All this had made the departure from our dusty old sanctuary that much harder for my wards to accept, but they followed me into the orange, red, and gold embrace of the autumn wilderness with resolute faith. They’d seen too much not to trust me, and I didn’t have to argue with the more stubborn members of the group anymore. Together we’d tramped to the green blot on the topographical map, and now that we sat on the edge of the grassy expanse, I found myself as the one having doubts.

*I have no way to measure any background radiation. It might take a hot minute to search for whatever is supposed to be here, and who knows how many rads we’ll take in that time frame? Not to mention what kind of stuff might be living in this grass, mutated leeches, giant ticks, some kind of super-mosquito . . .*

Shuddering at the skin-crawling idea of Breach-born parasites wriggling up my pant legs, I slipped the compass back into my pocket. We would just have to be quick. If Rodney Carter could make it in here, then the radiation couldn’t be lethal . . . or at least, I hoped so.

Turning, I raised a hand, and made a silent wave at the others.

*Let’s go.*

Deeper into the grass we went, weapons at the ready. I forced myself to breathe slow, let the focus slide over me, and crept along with primal caution. On the back of my tongue, I tasted the starchy blades of the grass, and the wet mud at the roots. My ears picked up the slight *crunch* of gravel particulates under the surface of the muck, remnants of whatever mining company had laid a gravel pad here decades prior. I caught the buzz of a fly a few yards to my left, and the muffled *whirr* of my compass spasming in my pocket, the needle in constant motion. Every color became more pronounced, the brown rush grass dried in the breeze, the turquoise blue sky, the chocolate-colored mud that squelched under my boots. Cool fall humidity lay heavy on my skin, and plants tickled my arms as I slid by them.

At the opposite end of the field, we came up on nothing.

I had the group make a wide loop around the outside of the clearing, searched the ground, the grass, the surrounding embankments.

Nothing.

Down the center we went in a crisscross pattern, spread out at arm’s length in a long row to comb through the area like a search-and-rescue team.

Still nothing.

In the roughly 20-acre stretch of ground, there were no buildings, no marks, only grass, a few dead tree stumps, and mud. It made no sense, and my frustration mounted as the anxious thought in the back of my head reminded me that we could be catching all sorts of poisonous radiation.

Stopping in the center of the field, I stood upright, and rested my hands on both hips in an angry huff.

*So, was this some kind of stupid joke? No one’s been here in a while, Jamie couldn’t have gotten to it first without leaving something behind for me to spot. Unless she pointed me in the wrong direction to cover her tracks, especially if she was working for ELSAR from the beginning.*

Aware of the puzzled looks thrown my way from the others, I pulled my map out again, and tried to make sense of the erratic compass.

*Whirrr.*

It spun like a propellor, and I shook the little plastic gadget with my teeth gritted in ire.

*Whirrrr.*

As if to spite me, the needle spun in faster pulsations, and I paced back and forth, ready to blow my cool at the inanimate chunk of hardened petroleum. “Stupid dollar store piece of—”

*Whiiirrr.*

*Crackle.*

I froze, and stared at the compass, the needle now spinning constantly without hesitation. Something under my boot had shifted, the sound oddly plastic to my heightened eardrums, and my angst melted into stunned realization.

The compass wasn’t pointing north . . . it was trying to point *down*.

With bated breath, I back up a few steps, and sank down on my haunches to peer at the grass.

*Oh, very clever Mr. Carter.*

A smile crawled over my face at a slight tinge of blue under the mud, the old tarp well-concealed under the thick mat of soil, roots, and grass. We’d walked right over it half a dozen times, and I’d been standing on top of the woven nylon flap while I fumed at my poor compass. From the air, it was invisible, from the ground undetectable; only magnetism could reveal it.

Pulling a cheap camping knife that I’d been given at the Castle from my belt, I gripped the stems of the wet grass and tugged upward, using the blade to dig at the roots. With a wet *snap* of plant-life giving way, the sod came free, and the children crowded around me in an excited cluster as I pulled the tarp aside.

A square metal cover sat underneath, painted slate-gray, with spots of rust here and there. It swung open on creaky hinges to reveal a hatch further recessed into poured concrete. This one was made from heavy steel, and smeared with a thin film of protective grease, a central hand-wheel in its core to open it like some kind of bunker door. Even with all this, it was a set of blocky, white painted letters on the door, that made my mind whirl like the compass needle.

*Silo 48.*

Daring to hope, I reached down, and yanked on the hand-wheel.

*Clunk.*

It turned in a smooth, well-oiled motion, and the sound of locks retracting echoed through the expanse beneath as the thick steel hatch rose upward on pneumatic struts. Stale air wafted up from inside, the cold scent of concrete and iron, and a metal ladder bolted to the interior wall led down into the shadows. It had a metal safety cage around it to prevent workers from falling through the already claustrophobic entry tube, and there wasn’t a visible bottom from where we sat on the surface. Even for my eyes it was dark, and something about the strange hole in the ground felt off, unnatural, misplaced.

I borrowed a flashlight from one of the boys and stuck my legs into the shaft to rest both feet on the first rung. “I’ll go first. If it’s safe, I’ll call up to you, and the rest of you come down to meet me. I don’t want anyone waiting around outside, just in case.”

“What if something grabs you?” A younger member of the group looked with nervous dread at the shadows beneath me.

Meeting the eyes of the older ones, who waited in silent expectation, I shrugged as nonchalantly as I could. “Close the hatch and run.”

Their worried faces drifted further and further away as I descended, the flashlight tucked into my jacket pocket, both shaky hands clinging to the ladder. It seemed like the seconds dragged on into hours, the climb downward never ending, and the square of sunlight became a golden postage-stamp high overhead. I had no idea how far down I would have to go, and my stomach churned at the haunting prospect that perhaps this was one of the Breach’s cruel tricks, that I would end up climbing forever, that there was no bottom to this hidden pit. What if I had crawled down inside it like an unsuspecting fly to a carnivorous plant in the Amazon, unaware the tunnel waited to gulp me down, smother me in darkness, and digest my bones?

*You’re psyching yourself out over nothing. It’s a freaking tunnel, Hannah, made of concrete just like a sidewalk. Someone had to have built it, and Carter made it out, so you can too.*

In that spirit, I put one foot out to take the next rung and jolted with surprise at the sensation of a hard floor under my heel.

Clicking on my flashlight, I swept the weak yellow beam over my surroundings, and curiosity overwhelmed my fear.

I stood in a circular tunnel, spacious and industrial, with metal supports on the walls, and diamond-plate steel on the floor It was cooler down here, and I guessed that I had to be at least sixty feet underground or more, the walls behind the I-beams molded from poured concrete. Electric lights hung from the ceiling, encased in protective wire cages, skinny round conduit bolted along the ceiling like bundles of shiny snakes. Unlike the abandoned brick factory, this place didn’t lay under a thick curtain of dust, but almost seemed brand-new, as if someone had been through to clean it just yesterday. Everything remained dark, however; the lights didn’t flicker to life, no machinery hummed, the air as still as a tomb.

A sign screwed to the wall caught my eye, white metal and square, with the words ‘escape hatch’ painted on it in black, an arrow pointing back the way I’d come. Another in similar style pointed forward, and my blood went cold with the words illuminated in my flashlight beam.

*Launch Control Center.*

In my head, Carter’s raspy voice echoed like the tolls of a bell, sinister for the desperation in his death rattle.

*More important than the beacon . . . don’t trust anyone . . .*

Sucking in a breath, I forced myself to walk on, one hand on my pistol, though something in my brain told me I wouldn’t need it. The mysterious notion gave me little comfort, the absence of any mutated life forms all the more foreboding. A place like this couldn’t be part of any mining operation. No, this was too technical, too clean, too militaristic for coal or minerals. Someone had designed this place for something more secretive, something horrible, something dangerous.

Dangerous enough for Rodney Carter to give his life to defend it.

Thirty yards in, the tunnel opened up into a larger, circular room, and I stopped dead in my tracks.

*Holy mother of God.*

An array of big metal boxes stood along one wall, covered in dials, switches, and indicators from an era before touch screens. In the center of the floor sat a metal desk with two chairs behind a set of ancient-looking computer monitors, a few binders and folders stacked between them. Radio equipment lined another workstation by the back wall, and headsets at each retro-styled swivel chair gave the space a distinctly governmental air. Several round analog clocks on the wall were labeled for various locations, London, Berlin, Moscow, and Washington D.C, among others. A stairwell at the back of the room had more signs, pointing up to ‘Crew Quarters’ and down to ‘Secondary Command Systems’. Off to my right, a single tunnel led deeper into the complex, with a lone sign that read, ‘Blast Boor 8’.

Shutting my eyes, I held my breath to slow my racing heart, and focused as hard as I could on the stillness around me. Everything came back strange, stunted, numb, like my new abilities struggled to claw through the low hiss of static that I hadn’t notice in my ears up until now. From what I could tell, nothing lived down here, yet I couldn’t bring myself to feel secure.

A brief search of the stairwell revealed a lower level with a similar setup to the first, and an upper floor of rooms with cramped bunks, and a tiny bathroom. No one appeared in either, and there wasn’t any blood, signs of struggle, or even scraps of torn clothing. It was as if the crew of this facility had just got up and walked out not five minutes ago.

At the base of the escape ladder, I called up to the tiny yellow square of light. “Okay, come on down.”

Somewhat comforted by the echoes of their eager feet on the iron ladder rungs, I ducked back into the control room, and walked to the central desk.

A newspaper had been tucked into the folders on one side, and I sat down in the right-hand swivel chair to tug it free.

“What on earth . . .” My brow knit together, and I blinked in confusion.

The first newspaper was dated 1953, far too old for a facility that seemed to have passed inspection only last week, and the headlines were crammed with strange text. I hadn’t always paid the best attention in history class, but I knew enough to understand that the words printed on the oddball paper shouldn’t have been correct. The more I read, the more my spine tingled with a bizarre wonder that I didn’t fully comprehend.

*Disaster averted! Whistleblower reveals atomic strike narrowly called off after U.S.S Seraphim vanishes during naval exercise. Washington and Moscow agree to hold de-escalation talks.*

*Stalin dead from stroke! Massive protests rock USSR in demand for change. Marshal Zhukov seizes power in Moscow, abolishes gulags, and vows drastic reforms.*

*An era for a change? Kremlin agrees to open trade deals with the west as Zhukov drafts new Russian constitution guaranteeing civil rights. Eisenhower leads charge to end racial segregation in US with widespread Congressional support.*

*From bombs to space-rockets: U.S and Russia form joint moon exploration taskforce in historic alliance treaty. NATO and WARSAW Pact dissolved, while Mao surrenders to Chiang Kai-shek at Nanking. Former Communist bloc to open their economies to free market reforms.*

Bewildered, I scanned the pages over and over again, waiting to see a political watermark, a gag label, something to let me know these were fake papers made for a joke. But the more I read, the more I sat there in stunned amazement.

They were real.

I remembered my conversation with Mr. Koranti, about other places, holes in reality, and interdimensional crossovers. Could it be true? Had there been a timeline where the Cold War didn’t drag on for decades, where the arms race withered out, and where the authoritarian regimes of the world toppled under the will of their own people? Just the thought had me both excited and heartbroken; excited that such a better place had been possible after all, and crushed that we, in our reality, hadn’t seen such times. What if our version of earth was the wrong one, a defective one, a nightmare for other dimensions that had done things right where we had erred? What if *we* were the Chaos-driven version of human history, a blood-soaked tale of endless violence that we never managed to shake? If this was evidence of Order succeeding in other timelines, then what did that mean for ours?

Desperate for answers, I shuffled to the next paper, and read on.

*Rural Tennessee communities evacuated after mysterious power outages cause havoc: bystanders say military weapons test released ‘monsters’.*

*Operation ‘Olympic Hammer’ exposed! CIA heads indited on testing electromagnetic superweapons in plot to attack former Soviet Union. Global support pours in to assist with biological cleanup of Polk County.*

*‘Worse than we thought’ International teams urge calm as contaminated zone in Tennessee widens. Russia pledges aid, reports similar ‘hot spots’ in Irkutsk. China unable to maintain order in remote regions as anomaly phenomenon spreads.*

*State of emergency declared in Washington as mutant attacks rise across nation. Moscow reportedly dark. Beijing in chaos. Military preps for experimental ‘containment’ strikes within continental US.*

Icy terror sank through me as I reached the last headline, no further papers on the desk, as if these had been the last to be delivered. The Breach. They’d found one too, or perhaps created one from the sounds of it, their covert superweapon enough to open a rift just like Koranti had spoken of. In their quest to restart the Cold War, the conspirators in the CIA had ripped open a doorway to Chaos, and unleashed mutants all over the world. Despite all the treaties, all the peace deals, one wrong step had doomed them to a cosmic apocalypse that looked eerily familiar from the grainy black and white photos on the front page.

*Fools. They could have reached for the stars, and they threw it all away. Stupid, proud fools.*

“What is this place?” Lucille stepped out from the dark behind me, and the rest of the children emerged one-by-one from the tunnel, examining the room with curious eyes.

“Not sure yet.” Pulling one of the technical binders out, I flipped it open and started to read. “Just don’t touch anything, okay?”

With all my concentration, I dove into the pages, devoured the complicated pamphlets in record time I would have been amazed at how fast my reading comprehension had improved, if it weren’t for the words that jumped off the pages at me.

*Automated self-loading silo . . . XM91 Multiple Individual Reentry Vehicle . . . Peacekeeper Two delivery system . . .*

My eyes rose to the console in front of me, and I noticed two sets of keyholes, with one holding a little metal key.

The other keyhole was empty.

*Wait a second.*

Horrified, I dropped the binder and leapt to my feet. Now it made sense why Carter had guarded this place with his life, and why ELSAR wanted the key coordinates. Somehow, in some way, this place had slipped through the veil of time and space to land in our reality and had brought its deadly secret with it.

A weapon so powerful, so dangerous, that even the deep pockets of ELSAR couldn’t get hold of one.

“What’s wrong?” An older boy cast around with his eyes in suspicion, but I ignored them all, and took off toward the tunnel marked ‘Blast Door 8’.

As if running in a nightmare, I couldn’t move fast enough, and the others sprinted after me in fear. I spun the hand-wheel, let the hydraulic springs crank it open, and raced on through more flights of metal stairways, more blast doors that counted down from eight, until I stumbled out into a massive shadowy chasm.

Stopping dead in my tracks at the safety railing, I stared out at a half-dozen white-painted tubes that rose from the gargantuan shaft toward the closed double blast doors above. They were huge, easily as tall as two school buses parked end-to-end, six of them held in a turnstile-like system of brackets that reminded me of a rotisserie rack at a gas station. The compass in my pocket cranked with a hysterical whirr, and the letters painted on the aluminum skin of the objects made the hairs on my neck stand on end.

*XM91.*

The children thundered into the launch shaft after me, and their eyes bulged at the deadly giants that stood in quiet mechanical slumber within the hidden bunker.

“Is that . . ?” Lucille squeaked, her jaw slack as she sidled closer in timid uncertainty.

“Uh huh.” I gripped the cold railing with white-knuckled hands, my stomach tied in sick knots. “Those are nukes.”
