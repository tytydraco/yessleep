When I say looking, I don't mean looking around or snooping, I mean he stands there motionless, almost like he's staring at nothing. It creeps me out so much.

He's in his fifties I believe. He and his wife have always been really good to my parents and I. I used to see him outside walking his dogs a lot, too. There was even a time he let us go in his storm cellar during a tornado watch. But a few months ago, we stopped seeing his wife. He explained to us that she had become really sick and had to lie in bed because she couldn't walk. After that, his friendly demeanor started to slip away. That's when he started looking into my window.

The first time I noticed it, I had just woken up at 6 am to get ready for school. I opened the blinds so my room would have light after school, like I always do, and there he was. He looked awful, like the energy had been sucked out of him. I initially became very scared, and hurriedly shut my blinds and ran out to the side of our house by my window, but he was gone. He wasn't there when I went back in either. After he did it again the next day, I told my parents. They went and talked to him, but according to them, he denied everything and told them that he was preoccupied with taking care of his wife. I began sleeping on the couch, but every morning I went and checked my window and saw him there, until one day, it just stopped.

A few days went by and I saw him there again. He looked even worse now, and he was mumbling something under his breath. He had dropped a ton of weight, too.

Later that day when I got home from school, I walked to our house and saw him standing outside my window, banging his head repeatedly on the glass. I yelled, and he turned toward me. His forehead was bloody and bruised. My parents had been at work all day, so God knows how long he'd been there. He ran hurriedly to his front door and slammed it shut behind him.

I walked to my window and was met with the sight of red, curly hair tied around the neck of a dead, eyeless mouse on the ground. A circle of white powder surrounded it. I think the hair was his wife's. She's the only person I know with red hair like that.

I cleaned the blood off of my glass and told my parents, but they still don't believe me. Should I investigate his house or even call the cops? I'm scared he might do something to me or my family.

**EDIT:**

Today, I watched for him to leave the house to walk his dogs. I hopped our fence in the back, and walked through the doggy door he uses for his dalmatian. His house was completely wrecked. Rotten fruit lay infested with flies and mold. dirty dishes piled up in the sink. A dried, blood-like substance covered the base of his walls.

I went into the master bedroom and saw his wife, or what was left of her, lying in bed. Her red hair was gone and covered the sheets around her. Her eyes had been gouged out, and her skin was sunken in. The only way I knew she was alive was because of the deep, raspy noise she made while breathing. I turned around in shock, and that's when I saw his wall. Pictures of me covered the entirety of his wall. Pictures of my empty room, pictures of me opening my blinds in the morning, but, weirdest of all, close-ups of my eyes.

I got out of his house just in time. As I hopped the fence, I heard his dog barking through the back door.

I have no idea what to do now. I feel so helpless. I may update tomorrow if I find anything else out.
