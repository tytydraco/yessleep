When I first heard him, I wasn't scared. He looked like a small old man, with a pale skin and eyes that glowed in the dark like a cat. I felt like I could accidentally step on him and crush him under my feet. He was there, I could see him, but I could never reach him. He slipped away as soon as I approached. So I gave up. He was like a pest, a vermin you didn't want in your house. And just as unimportant and mundane. Like the cockroach you might ignore on a daily basis. But he whispered.

He kept whispering, asking me to rob a bank. Not just any bank. Central Fin and Finance Institution. The CFFI. He kept whispering every noon, when I was eating lunch. He kept whispering, and whispering and whispering until I grew tired of it. He called himself "The Almighty God of Springs and Monetary Rewards". And it made me laugh. It sounded like a badly named department in some stupid corporate office not some God of the old.

But he didn't care about what I thought about him. He kept whispering. I thought about robbing that bank just to shut him up but That's just plain stupid. So I did what I thought was more interesting. I asked him to show off his Godhood. To use his powers as the God of "Springs and Monetary Rewards". He said he could make the vaults of The CFFI flow with gold, if I bothered to go and check it out. 

So when I finally had enough of his bullshit, I gripped the knife I was eating lunch with. I would now kill a god. A pathetic god, but still, a self-declared god. Hey there little fella. I threw the knife and it hit him in the fucking face. I walked over and started to look at him more closely. He was bleeding. His blood was bright blue and he smelled of dirt and iron. I picked up his body, and buried him in my backyard. 

Days passed and I was relieved to have my lunch in peace. Without his stupid voice accompanying every bite. From his grave grew a blue rose that was really, really beautiful. It smelled of gummy bear and it glowed in the dark. A dim, dark blue. Every time I smelled it I was filled with joy. It was INTOXICATING. You couldn't believe it. Gummy bears. Gummy. Bears. That's how I describe it, I know it sounds stupid, but that's as close as I can get. I watered it every morning after I woke up. And smelled it every noon before lunch.

Until one day, a storm was coming and I Had to take it with me. Take it inside and protect it. So I used all my knowledge of gardening and took it inside in a pot. When the storm came, I was inside cuddling the flower like a creep. Like Lars and his real girl. The smell of gummy bear filled the air, and I filled my lungs with deep breaths. It filled me with happiness. Outside, the sky kept roaring. The lightning and the rain, the whole package. Suddenly, someone started knocking on my door.

I kept the pot and my precious flower in one hand and a revolver in another, and looked in the peephole. Somewhere in the house, the ceiling started leaking. A man in his late forties, was standing behind the door. "ARE YOU HIS SERVANT?" he asked. "What the fuck are you talking about?" I answered.

"Don't test me"

"I'm not"

"give it back"

"no"

"I'm not asking"

"you just did"

He looked around and then, started whispering something. I started to feel dizzy and the blacked out. When I came to my senses, my flower was gone and so was he. The storm had passed and it was morning. The sun shining and the air light and easy on the lungs.

I picked a shovel and dug his grave.

There was nothing but a small tooth, which I planted in my pot.

I've been watering it every day, waiting patiently for the sweet smell of gummy bears to embrace me again.
