I didn’t sleep after my encounter at the midnight river. I mean, how could I? You’re not able to just go home and relax after experiencing something like that.

When I arrived back home, I double checked that every door and window in the house was firmly sealed and locked up tight, turned on every light, and proceeded to sit on my bed clutching the largest kitchen knife I could find, just in case. It must have been around 3 or 4 in the morning when I heard the sound of static coming from the living room.

I tiptoed carefully through the rooms of my new home, knife held close in case any intruder suddenly made their presence known. As I reached the living room, I found the TV set on to a dead channel, breaking the silence with a muted roar of signal noise. It was an ancient CRT, older than I was, and despite my shock I had to admit there was something faintly nostalgic about the buzzing of the static.

As I stood there, unsure of what I was supposed to do, I heard the static quiet down into a low hum of analog noise. I discerned a faint image appearing on the screen. It was dark, shadows on top of shadows, just a vague shape. It didn’t take very long for me to realize what I was seeing. The image slowly became brighter and brighter, revealing a blurry, uncanny face, cocked at an extreme angle and partially covered with long, dark hair. The image continued to brighten, starting to come into focus, and I could see more details. The neck seemed broken, unnaturally snapped to an impossible angle. There were tiny pinpricks of light, buried deep in the eye sockets. And I can’t honestly say I am convinced any longer that the expression on the face could accurately be described as a smile.

I didn’t have long to look over the image before there was another burst of static, followed by video footage of the interior of a house, taken from outside a backyard window. The shot panned slowly to the right, until I could see myself, staring transfixed with terror at the television set. But the camera wasn’t focusing on me. It began to zoom in slowly, focusing down at the couch behind me, revealing a pale, twisted arm, snaking out towards me from underneath the couch.

All at once, the lights went out, and the television set shut off as abruptly as it had turned on, leaving me alone in the darkness of the living room scrambling frantically to get away from the couch and knocking over a vase of flowers in the process, shattering it on the floor. The lights came back on, and I was alone in the living room. There was nothing reaching out from under the couch. Through the window, however, I could faintly see something climbing rapidly over the fence, disappearing into the neighbor’s yard.

I nearly had a heart attack when my phone started ringing. I’d spent the remainder of the night hiding in my bedroom with a flashlight, just in case the power went out again, and my nerves were shot from so much time spent awake and afraid. Hours of silence being suddenly interrupted filled me with an intense panic, to the extent that I’m fairly certain in my startled state I screamed something like “Go away!” before realizing it was just my phone. After taking a minute to calm myself, I answered the call.

“Hello?” I asked, trying and failing to hide my fear, “Who is this?”

In response, a familiar voice, tinged faintly with an affected transatlantic accent, drifted out of my phone’s speakers, replying “Goodness Trinity are you alright? You sound as though you’ve seen a ghost.” It was the voice of my friend, Helen. A friend who I sincerely hope is reading this.

I just started crying in response. After I’d eventually managed to calm down, just a little bit, I explained all that had happened, starting with the call from Seth and ending with my pursuer at the midnight river. The other end of the line remained politely quiet as I explained, with my caller only occasionally interjecting to provide sympathy and prompt me to continue. It felt so incredibly nice to just be able to tell someone what was going on, for someone to listen and take me seriously.

After I’d finished my explanation and the tears had stopped flowing, the voice at the other end took some time to reassure me that I wasn’t going crazy, that everything was alright. There were some discussions of possible rational explanations, and after a few minutes I began to feel much more normal. I felt safe again. I hate that it made me feel safe.

After a while the conversation had shifted to mundane topics, I don’t even remember exactly what, something like movies, or books we had read recently, things of that nature. I’d moved out of my bedroom and was just lounging on the couch in the living room. There was a brief lull in the conversation, and I was about to say that I needed to go and make myself breakfast, when suddenly the voice at the other end said, “You know, Trinity, I really like the way your clothes *smell*.”

I burst out laughing, I couldn’t help it. I mean, what else are you supposed to say when a longtime friend just out of nowhere announces that they enjoy the smell of your clothes? The voice at the other end laughed too, before adding “I thought it must have been some perfume or deodorant you wore, but no, I think it is the *clothes*, not any sort of scent you add. Perhaps there is something in the detergent that appeals to me, because,” there was a long inhale, compressed badly by the phone call’s quality, “I’m smelling them right now, and they’re just as good in your closet as they are on your body.”

My blood ran cold. “If this is your idea of a fucking joke, Helen, it’s not funny. Why would you think saying this sort of shit is even remotely okay after what I’ve been dealing with?”

There was a laugh on the other end of the line. A sick, acidic laugh, like venom dripping from a serpent’s fang. It didn’t sound like Helen’s laugh at all.

“Check the caller ID, *Thomas*,” said the voice, enunciating my deadname in a tone that made my heart drop. With shaking hands, I did as I was told. Unknown caller. The phone number displayed beneath it wasn’t Helen’s at all. A laugh erupted loudly out of my phone’s speakers, louder than should have been possible. I tried to hang up, but the laughter kept coming. At first I thought there was something wrong with my phone, and I just pressed down on the power button until the screen went black, but I could still hear it. I realized it wasn’t coming out of my phone anymore though. It was coming from my bedroom.

Picking back up the kitchen knife I had left on the counter, I crept to my room, slowly, shakily. As soon as I touched the doorknob, the laughter stopped abruptly. I opened the bedroom door, and was greeted still with total silence. Tinnitus rang loud in my ears as I braced myself to open the closet. When I finally did so, however, there was nobody there. There was nothing there but clothes, shoes, and a cheap, old flip phone, snapped in two and lying on the wooden floor.

I no longer felt safe in my own home by this point. I still wasn’t sure if I was being stalked, having some sort of psychotic break, or a combination of the two, but it was becoming abundantly clear to me that I could not stay in the house. I booked a motel room online, the cheapest place I could find at short notice. I wasn’t planning on staying long, so I only prepared one suitcase, in which I packed my laptop, a change of clothes, and my medication (including a generous quantity of sleep aids).

For the record, I did try calling 911, multiple times even. But my calls never seemed to direct to the right number, I’d just be greeted with dead air on the other end, without so much as an automated recording telling me that I had a wrong number. I even tried calling the local police station directly, but with no luck. I considered just driving down to the police station myself, but I realized that the only thing they’d be able to do would be to have an officer take my statement and maybe send someone to watch my house. I didn’t think either of those things would be able to help me anymore. Whatever was happening to me, it was becoming increasingly evident that I was going to need to deal with it alone.

I arrived at the motel at about noon, at least, I think that is when I got there. I remember the sun was high in the sky. The receptionist showed me to my room, and begrudgingly accommodated me when I insisted he stay with me for a few minutes while I proceeded to check every nook and cranny for any sign of an intruder. He must have thought I was crazy, but the 20 dollar bill I tipped kept his mouth shut.

I tried to do some research into *lookatme.png*, at least as best as I could with the crappy motel WiFi. I had no doubt at this point that the mysterious image was the root cause of all my suffering, and at the same time I felt with increasing certainty that Seth had absolutely nothing to do with it, at least not directly. I still blame them for all of this though. I wouldn’t have clicked that email if it wasn’t for them.

In any event, my search turned up no actual, usable leads. The idea of a “cursed image” seemed at least as old as the internet itself, and even looking for specific instances of the phrase “look at me” in conjunction with such topics didn’t really give me anything to work with. In the end, funnily enough the most useful piece of information I found was a typo-riddled post on some tech forum from a decade ago, describing a computer crash caused after downloading a “weird image” from an email by accident. The OP was convinced that the image had been a computer virus, and the thread was locked by a moderator after they started cursing out a user who said they were an idiot for downloading random email attachments. This didn’t bring me any closer to solving my problem, but I at least knew now that I wasn’t *lookatme.png*’s only victim.

It seemed to be getting darker more rapidly all the time. When you are exposed to continual stress it changes your perception of time. The periods of time during the stressful events themselves feel like they last forever, the clock’s hands moving past at a snail’s pace. Then when you’re alone, when you’re no longer in immediate danger, time starts to flow faster again, all while your mind relives over and over the terrors you experienced. It felt like only minutes after I checked into my room and began doing my research that the sun was beginning to set. I ate a supper of instant ramen I bought from the gas station across the street, cooking it with hot water from the motel room coffee maker.

My energy finally started to fail me, and I decided at the very least I should brush my teeth before going to bed, though I was not planning on turning off any of the lights. It was the motel’s electricity bill, not mine, and I refused to be alone in the dark after all I had experienced. I shuffled over to the bathroom, feeling more like a zombie than a living human being. My reflection seemed to support this descriptor. Greasy, unwashed hair, dark eye bags, and sunken cheeks showed the toll that this was taking on me, physically and mentally. As I moved to brush a tangled lock out of the way of my eyes, some of it actually came out in a clump. My lip trembled, but I didn’t have the energy to cry, and I found my mouth shifting into a now familiar grimace. I wanted to smash the mirror, but I didn’t have the energy. Instead, I just slunk off to bed, hoping that tomorrow all of this would just be a bad dream, but knowing in my heart that it would only get worse.

^(Postscript)

^(For reasons that should be obvious, I found this third document particularly distressing. After reading it, I redoubled my efforts towards contacting Trinity, but she still is not answering my calls. Admittedly, if what she says in this testimony is true, I can perhaps understand her hesitancy in speaking with others via phone, especially me, and it may also be entirely possible that she is unable to receive or send communications at this time. I have asked some of her friends and known associates if they have heard from her, but this has thus far led nowhere. The only thing stopping me from calling the police at this point is my concern for Trinity’s safety; law enforcement and the healthcare system aren’t typically very kind to women like her, and I wouldn’t want to see her unwillingly institutionalized (or worse) ^(because of my actions.))

^(To be entirely honest, I am quite anxious to read what Trinity’s fourth and final “stage” of her narrative contains, but I am a woman of my word, and, in spite of my better judgment, will respect her wishes. I shall read and post the final document in 24 hours.)
