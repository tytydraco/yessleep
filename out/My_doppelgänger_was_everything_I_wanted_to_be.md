I've always been invisible. I know that sounds pathetic, but I'm not being self-pitying, I'm just stating a fact. It wasn't really the fault of anyone but myself. I'm terrified of social interactions and of the potential humiliation of rejection, and risks really aren't my thing. I don't know how to dress well, or wear makeup, and my hair has a permanent case of bed-head. As such, when I'm not at school I spend most of my time in my room, curtains drawn, lights dimmed, playing games. My mom would occasionally make passing comments about me not going outside much, but she never really made a concerted effort to do anything about it.

Not that I blamed her; she had enough on her plate. She worked long hours, and had a lot of stress in her life as a result. I tried to keep the amount of stress I caused her to a minimum, which meant not talking to her much. It wasn't that I didn't like her, I just didn't want to bother her with the trivialities of my life. That's how I saw it anyway. So, I kept to myself mostly, and she did her own thing. It worked.

The night I first saw it was no different than any other. I was in my chair curled up, knees against my chest, playing some dumb MMO that had been addicting me for the past few weeks. It wasn't particularly fun, but I didn't have much else to do with my time. After a few hours, the air started to feel stuffy, and I realized I hadn't cracked my window in a while. I paused the game and walked over to the window, popping it open and pushing the screen out.

The breeze felt good, and it was a nice night. The apartment building was a bit run-down, and the outside of the windows were covered in grime, but for a single mother with a antisocial daughter, it was the best she could afford.

As I took in the familiar streets, however, I noticed something that made my heart skip a beat. There, on the opposite rooftop, was a figure—a person-shaped void. Like someone had cut a human silhouette out of the night sky, or if you had 30 seconds to draw a human. Head, torso, arms, legs... nothing else. And yet, despite having no eyes, I knew it was looking at me.

I immediately slammed the window shut and pulled the curtains over. This was exactly why I preferred staying inside.

I crawled into bed and pulled my blanket over my head like I was five years old again. It was just some guy in dark clothes, I told myself. The streetlights were dim, my eyes were tired from staring at a screen for hours. Of course, a distant figure would look weird and shapeless. Excuse after excuse echoed in my head, calming me enough to allow me to sleep.

That relief was swiftly dashed as I saw it again the next day at school. During class, I sat in my usual spot in the back corner, as far from everyone else as possible. I tended to daydream while gazing out at the playground, but that day I tried to keep my eyes from straying from the paper in front of me; I didn't want to risk catching another glimpse of the figure.

But old habits die hard, and by third period, I was already zoning out, staring at the playground through the glass. There, sitting on the swings, was the figure, legs dangling off the swing. I wasn't sure if I could make out more detail or if it had changed since the day before, but it looked different. Instead of a vague human outline, this time it had hair. And clothes. And it just looked more... Real. It was still completely black, and I could only discern the shape of its body by the contrast of the sky behind it, but it was definitely human.

Once again, it was facing me. I looked around, hoping that someone else noticed, but I was the only one staring out the window. The idea of even talking to one of my classmates, let alone asking them if they saw a weird figure outside the window, was too much. I didn't want to embarrass, so I kept quiet, and tried to pay attention to the teacher's lecture.

The rest of the day dragged by, but thankfully there were no more sightings of the figure. When the final bell rang, I quickly gathered my belongings and made a beeline for the exit. I wanted nothing more than to go home and lock myself in my room again, safe from whatever was lurking outside. I managed to get all the way to my front door without any more strange sights. As I turned the key in the lock, however, a black figure suddenly appeared behind me. I could only just make it out in my peripheral vision, but it was definitely the same colorless form I had been seeing.

It was close, too. I could feel its presence, like a cold draft against my neck. My heart hammered as I fumbled with the key, and the moment the lock clicked, I practically threw myself inside, slamming the door behind me and locking it again. Was I losing my mind? That couldn't be real. I'd never believed in ghosts or any of that supernatural stuff, but what else could explain what I was seeing?

Shaking my head, I holed myself up in my room once more and played games until, a few hours later, I heard Mom's keys in the door. She was later than usual – probably had to work overtime again. I heard her moving around the kitchen, then her footsteps approached my room.

"Marin? You okay in there?" she called through the door. "Mrs. Chen said she saw you running up the stairs like something was chasing you." I opened my mouth to tell her about what I'd seen, but then hesitated. Whatever I said to her would only make her worry, and she had enough on her plate already. Maybe she'd take me to a doctor, which would cost money we didn't have and time she couldn't spare. She'd probably have to take off work, lose pay, sit in some waiting room for hours just to have some doctor tell her I was stressed or making things up. She'd blame herself, think she wasn't doing enough as a mother, when the truth was she was already doing everything she could just to keep us afloat. The last thing she needed was her weird, antisocial daughter adding mental health problems to the list of things she had to worry about.

"Uh, I'm fine, mom. Just saw a weird bug on the way home," I lied, hoping I sounded convincing enough. She didn't respond for a few moments, as if she was debating whether to push the issue.

Finally, she sighed, and said, "Okay, sweetheart. Dinner's in half an hour, okay? I'll leave your plate in the microwave." The moment she walked away, I let my forehead hit the desk. I wasn't sure what to do, so I did what I'd always done in stressful situations; nothing. Just silently hope things would fix themselves.

The next day, as I was preparing to go to school, Mom stopped me on my way out the door.

"Thank you for taking out the garbage last night," she said, giving me a tired smile.

"Huh?" I murmured in response.

"I know you're not one for chores," she said, ruffling my hair, "But it's nice to see you help out around the house. Keep it up, okay?" I stared back at her, my mouth hanging open slightly.

"Y-yeah. Sure, Mom," Seeing how happy such a small, insignificant action made her, I wished that I was the one who'd done it. But I hadn't left my room since I'd gotten home yesterday. I didn't even know the garbage needed taking out.

My stomach dropped at the realization. Someone else had been in our apartment. Someone had taken out our garbage, and Mom thought it was me. The logical part of my brain scrambled for explanations—maybe I'd sleepwalked? Maybe Mom had done it herself and forgotten? But deep down, I knew better. The same wrongness I'd felt watching that figure on the rooftop was creeping into my own home now.

I wanted to ask Mom when exactly she'd seen me take out the garbage, what I'd been wearing, if I'd said anything to her. But I feared that the answers would just confirm what I knew deep down.

I didn't have much time to dwell on the thought, as I needed to get to class. The morning was uneventful; no sightings of the figure, or anything unusual. During my second period class, however, a classmate approached me. I recalled her name, which was Ashley, but nothing beyond that.

"Hey, Marin," she greeted me with a bright smile, leaning on my desk. "Do you want to hit up that café again?"

"C-cafe?" I stammered. I had never gone to any cafés the day before. In fact, I had never been to a café at all. My anxiety usually kept me from such public places.

"Yeah, the one we went to yesterday! You said you loved the coffee there, right? I was thinking of going again after school, if you're interested." I could only stare back at her, trying to figure out what she was talking about. Was this some kind of prank?

I eventually managed to stammer out an excuse to get out of the situation, saying that I had homework. She didn't look like she was buying it.

"Are you good? You seem a lot less... confident today," she commented, looking a bit worried. "I mean, I won't force you to come with me or anything, but..."

"Maybe another time," I said, trying to deflect further conversation.

"Alright. Well, I'll see you around," Ashley said, giving me one last glance before turning and walking away. I slumped back into my chair and let out a breath. What the hell was going on? I desperately looked out the window, now hoping the figure that unnerved me so much would be there, just so I could blame everything on it.

But, of course, there was nothing, just an empty playground and my growing sense of unease.

Suddenly, the teacher's voice snapped my attention back to the front of the room. She was informing the class of the assignment we'd been working on for the past two weeks. I felt my stomach drop. Though I was working on it semi-frequently, these incidents had distracted me to the point where I hadn't been able to finish it. I waited for the rest of the class to be dismissed before heading to the front of the room to talk to the teacher.

"Can I ask for an extension?" I asked, fidgeting nervously. "I'm really sorry, I've been working on it, I swear, but I've just been distracted and-"

"What do you mean, 'extension'? You've already submitted your project," her eyebrows narrowed as she rifled through the pile of papers on her desk. After a moment of searching, she pulled out a sheet and held it up.

Marin R. A+, the top of the page read. I closed my eyes and opened them, as if trying to clear an obvious illusion, but there was no mistaking what I was seeing. The handwriting was mine, but the content was unfamiliar. It was thorough and insightful and had citations from sources I'd never even known existed. It was everything I wished my writing could be, the kind of polished work I'd always envied in other students but never managed myself.

"Oh." Was all I could manage to say.

"You should be proud of this," the teacher said, smiling. "You're really showing some great improvement lately, Marin. Keep this up, okay?" I nodded, returning the paper and walking out of the classroom in a daze.

The next period was starting, I repeated in my head. I couldn't let this distract me. I just had to keep going. Things would sort themselves out, eventually. Everything will go back to normal. Nothing is wrong. Nothing-

Someone was sitting in my seat. Someone who looked like me. She was talking with Ashley and the other girl who, through eavesdropping, I had come to know as 'Becca'. They were laughing. With her. The girl with my face.

I stood at the doorway of the classroom, my mind reeling. Her eyes weren't marred by the dark circles of sleeplessness that I was familiar with. Her hair framed her face in a delicate bob, not like the frizzy, unkempt mess I was used to. Her skin was smooth and clear, not blemished by the red patches of irritation that I always had to conceal with a hoodie or long sleeves. She wore a smile that was warm and genuine, not like my tense, awkward, toothless grimace.

The teacher cleared his throat behind me. "Marin, you should be in your own seat now. Class is starting."

My heart fluttered with hope, and I nearly spun around with tears in my eyes to beg him to help me. But he just bumped into my shoulder and walked past me to his desk, where he sat down and started pulling out papers. The girl–Marin–let out a groan, as did her friends, before getting up and returning to the desk at the corner of the room. My desk. The few stragglers that were still coming in pushed past me without a glance, their backpacks catching my shoulder, their conversations flowing around me. One may have mumbled a quiet sorry, but they didn't stop to check if I was okay, or wait for a response. They just kept moving. Like I wasn't even there.

I hadn't moved an inch since I arrived, and I didn't move an inch still, just staring at the imposter in her–my–seat. Nausea and anxiety swelled up inside me, my heartbeat quickening as reality finally set in. This couldn't be real. It had to be some sick joke. Some kind of nightmare that I'd wake up from any second now, and then I could go back to being a nobody. Back to being invisible.

The irony was not lost on me.

As the bell rang and the teacher began his lesson, I looked down at my hands. I was still here. Still standing. Still breathing. My nails dug into the palms of my hands, and the pain was real. So I was still real too. Right?

The room felt like it was spinning. I needed to get out, needed to get home before I disappeared entirely. I stumbled backward out of the classroom, my footsteps making no sound on the linoleum floor. My legs felt weak and rubbery, but I forced myself to keep going, pushing past the lingering students in the hall. No one seemed to notice me. No one bothered to call out after the girl who was clearly on the verge of a panic attack. Slamming my body weight against the door, I spilled out into the sunlight, the warmth a stark contrast to the cold dread that had settled in my chest. I ran down the street, barely paying any attention to where I was going.

Mom would know what to do, right? I could explain everything to her. She'd believe me. She wouldn't call me crazy. She'd help me. She had to.

I burst through the front door of our apartment, panting. Mom's keys and bag were on the table, so she must have been home early from work.

"Mom?" My voice choked out, the words sounding small and insignificant in the empty space. There was no answer. I crept through the hallway, checking each room until I got to Mom's bedroom. She was laying in bed with a book in her lap, reading glasses perched on the end of her nose. She looked relaxed, something I rarely saw from her. When she heard me enter, she glanced up at me. Something in her eyes shifted, a sort of weary recognition mixed with something else I couldn't quite place.

"Oh, Marin, I didn't realize you were home," she said, not even noticing the state I was in. Paying her reaction no mind, I rushed towards her and wrapped my arms around her. She tensed at first, then slowly returned the hug.

"Are you alright, sweetheart? You're shaking," she said, rubbing circles on my back.

"M-mom, there's someone pretending to be me at school. And no one noticed. And, and, I don't know, I don't know what's going on. Please, you have to help me," I blurted, my words tumbling out of my mouth in a jumbled mess. I buried my head into her shoulder, tears streaming down my face.

She held me for a minute longer, before I felt her comforting circles stop. Then her grip loosened. I looked up, chest still heaving with sobs, to find that her eyes had gone distant, unfocused. Like she was trying to remember something just out of reach. She was staring aimlessly at the wall behind me. Gradually, her hands fell away from my back, and she turned back to her book, adjusting her reading glasses. The page rustled as she turned it, and it was as if I'd never entered the room at all.

I sat by her side, my heart aching, waiting for her to say something. To tell me it was going to be okay. That she loved me. That she knew it was me, her daughter. But she never did. The only sound was the ticking of the clock and the occasional flip of a page. Eventually, I left the room, the door clicking shut behind me.

I curled up on my bed, my chest aching from the effort of breathing. I couldn't bring myself to do anything. I just sat there, staring at the wall, until the room grew dark and exhaustion overpowered me.

I awoke to the sound of cutlery and distant chatter. The clock on my bedside table read 7:30. Breakfast, I realized, feeling a pang of hunger in my gut.

My feet were heavy, and I felt as if I were floating outside of myself. I passed by the mirror and stopped, looking at the stranger in the reflection. Dark circles under the eyes, messy hair, pale skin. I looked awful.

In the living room, Mom and Marin sat at the dinner table, laughing about something or other. It might've been the first time both of us were at that table in years. I couldn't even remember the last time Mom had seen me eat a full meal, rather than me just taking it back to my room and leaving it half-eaten. I couldn't be bothered to pay attention to the details of the conversation. I just stood there, watching the scene play out in front of me. Watching as Marin reached over and grabbed the salt, and Mom told her to not add too much because it was unhealthy. Watching as Marin took a bite of her meal, and Mom smiled at the sight.

Once their plates were emptied, Marin picked up dishes without having to be asked. She washed them in the sink. I watched Mom's eyes as she stared after Marin. There was a warmth in her gaze that I hadn't seen in a long time. A warmth that I couldn't remember being directed at me in a while.

I needed fresh air. They didn't notice the door closing behind me as I stepped outside. It was a nice day out. Clear skies, the sun casting a golden glow on the street below. A gentle breeze ruffled my hair, carrying with it the scent of flowers and the promise of rain. As I trudged down the street, I looked at the passersby, hoping maintaining eye contact would get them to acknowledge my existence.

When that didn't work, I did something I'd never done before. I walked directly up to a man walking his dog and stood in front of him. "Excuse me," I said, my voice barely above a whisper. "Can you see me?" He stepped around me without breaking stride. I looked at a young woman leaning against a wall, scrolling through her phone. I reached out to grab her sleeve, but my fingers didn't have enough strength to get a grip.

"Someone, please, anyone..." I whimpered, stumbling back from the sidewalk. No response. With a defeated sigh, I returned to our apartment, walking up the stairs and standing outside the door. When I tried the handle, I discovered it was locked. Mom's muffled voice came from the other side, still chatting with... Me. She seemed so happy. I couldn't bring myself to ruin the mood.

"You should be proud of this," the teacher said, smiling. "You're really showing some great improvement lately, Marin. Keep this up, okay?" I nodded, returning the paper and walking out of the classroom in a daze. As I joined the mob of students leaving, I was bumped into repeatedly, bouncing between my classmates like a pinball. They barely seemed to notice me, as usual—but today it felt different. More careless. Like I was even less visible to them than before.

I made my way through the school gates and toward the crosswalk, my mind still reeling from the assignment incident. The light turned green, and I stepped into the street alongside a group of other students. Halfway across, a car came barreling around the corner without slowing down. I jumped back instinctively to avoid a direct collision.

Pain shot through my tailbone as I hit the ground hard. I sat there for a moment, stunned, waiting for someone to ask if I was okay, or for the driver to stop and apologize. But the car sped away without so much as a pause, and the other students parted and flowed around me like water around a rock. A couple of them gave me a passing glance, but nobody stopped, or offered to help me up, or even snickered at my clumsiness.

It was only after I'd managed to pick myself up when a boy from my class finally approached me.

"You alright?" he asked, his voice casual, not concerned.

"Y-yeah, I'm fine," I replied, brushing myself off. "Did you see that car? It almost hit me."

"Mhm..." He mumbled, eyes dropping from mine, before continuing on, like he'd already forgotten about me.

I was a little grateful that my fall didn't draw much attention, but that relief was drowned out by an all-encompassing feeling of wrongness.

Things only got weirder from there. More assignments and tests I never remembered taking turned up on my desk, constantly bearing near perfect scores. The house and, by extension my room, were spotless, and Mom's stress and workload seemed to be decreasing. She was even smiling more, thanking me for all the things I'd apparently been doing for her. Things I definitely, definitely hadn't done.

But worse than the mysterious helpfulness was the fact that I was starting to... disappear. Despite my bump in grades, I was somehow becoming even less relevant in class. Sometimes people would have conversations about me, discussing things I'd never done and jokes I'd never told, while I was right there. At some point, the dread had gotten so bad that I stayed in bed for an entire school day, but mom never received a call and the next day, I was told my presentation was perfect.

Everything came to a head on Friday. The events that had transpired over the past however many days played over and over in my head as I dragged myself to class. The next period was starting, I repeated in my head. I couldn't let this distract me. I just had to keep going. Things would sort themselves out, eventually. Everything will go back to normal. Nothing is wrong. Nothing-

Someone was sitting in my seat.

Someone who looked like me. She was talking with Ashley and the other girl who, through eavesdropping, I had come to know as 'Becca'. They were laughing. With her. The girl with my face.

And then it hit me like a physical blow. The mysterious person living my life, doing things I'd never do, being the perfect daughter and perfect student, being noticed by people, being funny, being helpful, being confident...

The shapeless, shadowy figure I'd seen the other day had grown. Grown into someone. Grown into me. A better me.

Her eyes weren't marred by the dark circles of sleeplessness that I was familiar with. Her hair framed her face in a delicate bob, not like the frizzy, unkempt mess I was used to. Her skin was smooth and clear, not blemished by the red patches of irritation that I always had to conceal with a hoodie or long sleeves. She wore a smile that was warm and genuine, not like my tense, awkward, toothless grimace.

I needed fresh air. I stepped outside and walked aimlessly for a few minutes, trying to process everything I'd just witnessed. When I reached into my pocket for my headphones, I realized I'd left them on my desk. I turned back toward the apartment, but when I tried the handle, I discovered it was locked. Mom's muffled voice came from the other side, still chatting with... Me. She seemed so happy. I couldn't bring myself to ruin the mood.

I turned away from the door and started walking to school. It was the only place I could think to go. The area was mostly deserted, as it was a Sunday. I found myself drawn to the playground I so often used as a distraction during class. I walked up to the swings and sat down, kicking at the ground absentmindedly. Despite that, the chains stayed perfectly still, my body unable to impact the world in any meaningful way. I sat there as the sun rose and fell, as the shadows lengthened and then disappeared, as the moon passed overhead and the stars dwindled and the sky began to lighten again.

By the time the first bell rang, I had been sitting on that swing for nearly a full day. Students trickled into the school, and I spotted Marin among them. She was talking animatedly with Ashley and Becca, smiling brightly. She seemed to be having a good time. For a moment, she turned her head towards the playground, and her eyes met mine. Then, as soon as it happened, she looked away again and continued her conversation with the other girls.

My phone buzzed in my pocket, and I groggily took it out. The text notification was from mom. It read, "I'm going to the grocery store. What do you want for dinner?" My thumb hovered over the keyboard before I decided not to respond. A few seconds later, a reply from Marin appeared. "I'd really like some curry."

Curry was my favourite, and I'd been craving it for days. She always knew how to cook it perfectly. The right blend of spices, the way she boiled the potatoes, the softness of the carrots. I could practically taste it even now.

It was unfortunate, then, that I wasn't Marin.
