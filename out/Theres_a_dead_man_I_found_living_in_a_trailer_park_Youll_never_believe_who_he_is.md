 I spot the kid at the skatepark, have been tracking the little bastard for two months, the shirt a hell of a lot longer. He has that stupid hipster look: tight jeans, black-rimmed glasses, and hair greased all the way back to the fifties. Of all people in the world, this dumbass has it.

I groan and stub out my cigarette, and stroll over: “Hey, kid. Give you fifty for the flannel.”

The kid turns, smears an ignorant look on his face. “Huh?”

“You deaf? The shirt. I’ll pay you fifty for it.”

The kid shakes his head. “Nah, man. I just bought it.”

“Yeah right—at Gilbert’s Pawn a month ago, down in Jupiter Bay. Yeah, I know. How ‘bout seventy-five?”

The hipster rolls his eyes, strokes his barely-there goatee. “Look, I don’t want to sell it, okay? I like it. Has that whole nineties vibe.” He angles his board back toward the concrete half-pipe, is about to roll into it when I grab his shoulder. The kid whirls on me.

“Hey, asshole, I said no de—”

I drive my fist into his teeth, feel something pop like the head of his snare drum. The kid sits down hard, blood leeching over his chin. His words came out in a slur.

“Wha da fug, man.” 

“A hundred bucks. Final offer. That, or I take it off your corpse.”

People are staring at us now, whispering.

“Fine.” The hipster rips off the black and red checked flannel and hurls it at me. “Take it.” 

I groan. Jesus. The kid is wearing suspenders. No one would have paired a flannel with suspenders back in my day. Not unless you wanted a thorough ass beating. One like he just got. Still, a deal’s a deal. I peel a hundred from my pocket, crumple it up, and toss it at the kid, then pick up the shirt and stride back to my van. 

I hope there isn’t blood on it.

I rap a fist on the trailer door. It creaks open. Cold blue eyes appraise me through the crack, a pale white visage that sends chills running down my spine. The man looks like death, if death smoked a lot of cigarettes and avoided the outside world at all costs.

“Hey, I uh, found your shirt.”

“Serious?”

“As cancer,” I reply

The door swings wider, and a hand darts out. Snatches it. “Unreal. How’d you find it?” 

I clench my teeth. “It took some doing.”

“I’ve been looking for this ever since the Reading Festival.”

“Yeah. No shit. And you said if I found it, you would be done with all this secrecy crap.”

The man strokes his blonde beard. He’s definitely older than the world remembers, more creases near his eyes. But he’s mostly the same old Kurt. Ragged voice. Don't give a fuck attitude. Lots of flannel. “Yeah, I…dunno, Courtney’s gonna be pissed, man.”

“It’s been twenty-six years. You got your flannel back. I don’t think Courtney’s going to care. Now let’s go. I booked you a the club up the road.”

He blows out a cloud of nicotine and nods. “Fine. Let me get my guitar.”
