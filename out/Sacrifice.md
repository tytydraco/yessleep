In the shadowed valleys, where ancient whispers stirred in the winds and legends merged with reality, five survivors huddled around a flickering fire. The Dead had risen and had devoured the world, leaving only the resilient and the damned.



Their names were barely whispered among them, for fear that the very utterance might beckon the horrors that lurked beyond the flickering embers. There was Padraig, the aging farmer, a weathered soul with a gnarled heart. His sister, Aoife, stood beside him, her beauty marred by the haunted look in her eyes. Fintan, the scholar, held a tome filled with knowledge, while Bridget, the healer, clutched her satchel of remedies. And then there was Seán, a unknown traveler, roaming the countryside’s.



Together, they hid in the forgotten ruins of an ancient monastery, its stones bearing the weight of centuries of secrets. The walls held their stories, tales of druids and dark rites. But now, the stones held a newer tale—a tale of fear, death, and relentless hunger.



As night fell, the survivors gathered around the fire, its feeble glow warding off the encroaching darkness. Padraig clenched his fists, his knuckles white with worry. "We cannot stay here forever," he grumbled, his brogue thickening with despair. "The food is running low, and the fiends outside grow restless."



Aoife's fingers traced the lines of her brother's face. "We cannot leave, Padraig. The world has crumbled, the very land we stand upon is cursed. This place is all that remains of our homeland."

Fintan's eyes darted between the pages of his tome, his voice trembling with trepidation. "The old texts speak of a ritual," he murmured. "A way to banish the abominations that now walk the Earth. But it requires a sacrifice, a willing heart.“



They looked amongst them selves Bridgette and the siblings stiffening at the idea of choosing a sacrifice, “are you sure Fintan?”, “There must be a better way we can run we can find others get help” the siblings voices overlapping. Sean stayed silent not looking up.



Bridget's gaze fell upon Seán, the silent wanderer. "Seán," she said, her voice quivering, "you are the key to this ritual. Your life and sacrifice — they hold the answer."

Sean's eyes, pools of darkness, met Bridget's with a chilling intensity. "I have walked paths both dark and forbidden, for which I must repent" he whispered. "I am willing to make the sacrifice." He said louder with surety.



The survivors gathered the necessary components, and making sigils, their hands shaking with fear and purpose. The ancient ritual began as they chanted forgotten verses in the eerie tongue of the ancients. Shadows danced around them, and the air grew heavy with malevolence.



Seán stepped forward, his heart heavy with the weight of his own secrets. The ritual demanded blood and knowledge, and he willingly offered both. As the ritual reached its crescendo, a vortex of energy surged forth, tearing through the very fabric of reality. The skies darkened, and the land trembled.

In that moment of madness, the Dead outside the monastery screamed in agony, their wails echoing through the valleys, and hills into the oceans beyond. As the survivors watched, the abominations disintegrated into dust, their cursed existence undone.



But the price was paid in full. Seán crumbled to the ground, his life drained. As the survivors stared at his lifeless body, they knew that they had banished the darkness, but at the cost of a willing heart.

The survivors buried Seán, Stacking rocks above him a solemn monument to their grim victory. As they turned away from the ruins of the monastery, they knew that the shadows of their experiences would haunt them forever. They had glimpsed the abyss, leaving scars upon their souls that could never truly heal. The world was forever changed, and the survivors carried their dread-filled memories with them as they walked into an uncertain future.
