To start off this story, I had been looking forward to this road trip for weeks. It was my chance to celebrate my college graduation with my family at our vacation home, and I couldn't wait to spend some quality time with them. But as I drove down the winding roads, I began to realize that something was wrong.

The road seemed to go on forever, with no end in sight. I tried to turn around, but every time I did, I ended up right back where I started. I was getting more and more anxious by the minute, and then I saw a figure on the side of the road.

At first, I thought it was just a hitchhiker, but something about the way they were standing made me feel uneasy. I decided to pass them since I was a small girl and the thought of a random man in my car made me uncomfortable.

But then, two minutes later, I saw them again. Their face seemed to be misplaced like it had been twisted out of shape. I tried to ignore it, telling myself that it was just my imagination. But every time I passed the figure, their body contorted slightly, becoming more and more twisted until they looked like something out of a horror film.

I started to drive faster, going about 120 miles per hour, desperate to get away from the figure. But no matter how fast I drove, it was always there, standing on the side of the road. Every 30 seconds, I passed them again, and every time, their body was even more twisted and deformed than before.

I was starting to lose it. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. I tried to call my family, but my phone had no signal. I was completely alone, trapped in this endless loop with this twisted figure haunting me at every turn.

And then, all of a sudden, the figure was gone. I let out a sigh of relief, thinking that it was finally over. But then I heard a slight gurgling noise behind me, and when I looked in my rearview mirror, I saw the figure sitting in the seat behind me.

I screamed and tried to swerve off the road, but the figure held me in place, its twisted face just inches from mine. It whispered something in a language I couldn't understand, and then everything went black.

When I woke up, I was back on the road, driving towards our vacation home. I thought it had all been a nightmare, but then I saw something in the corner of my eye. It was the figure, standing on the side of the road once again.

I knew then that I was trapped in some kind of loop, doomed to repeat this terrifying experience over and over again. I tried to think of a way out, but the road just kept stretching out before me, with no end in sight.

As I passed the figure once again, I saw its body contort and twist, becoming more and more monstrous with each passing moment. I knew then that I had to get out of this loop before it was too late.

I slammed my foot down on the gas pedal and sped away, driving faster than I ever had before. I passed the figure again and again, each time its twisted form growing more and more grotesque.

Finally, after what seemed like an eternity, the figure disappeared, and I heard nothing but silence. I slowed down, cautiously looking around for any sign of the figure, but there was nothing.

I let out a sigh of relief, thinking that it was finally over. But then I saw something in my rearview mirror, and my heart dropped. The figure was sitting in the seat behind me once again, its twisted face grinning menacingly.

I screamed and slammed on the brakes, but it was too late. The figure reached out and grabbed my shoulder, its grip tight and cold. I could feel its breath on my neck, and the hairs on the back of my neck stood on end.

"Welcome back," it felt like it was speaking from inside of my own head. "We have much to show you."

And then everything went black again.

When I woke up, I was back on the road once again, driving towards the vacation home. But this time, I knew that it was different. This time, I was ready.

I drove faster than before, passing the figure every 30 seconds, watching as it contorted and twisted into grotesque shapes. But this time, I didn't let it get to me. I kept my eyes on the road ahead, refusing to let the figure distract me.

And then, when the figure disappeared, I slowed down, cautiously looking around for any sign of it. But there was nothing. The road stretched out before me, endless and empty.

I let out a sigh of relief, feeling a sense of triumph that I had broken free from the loop. But then I heard something in the backseat, a slight gurgling noise.

I turned around slowly, bracing myself for the worst. But what I saw was not the twisted figure, but a small child, crying and alone.

"Please help me," the child whimpered, tears streaming down their face.

I felt a pang of sympathy for the child, and I pulled over to the side of the road. But as soon as I opened the door, the child's face twisted and contorted, becoming that of the twisted figure.

I screamed and slammed the door sHut, driving away as fast as I could. But thE figure was there, chasing me down the endLess road, its twisted form growing more and more monstrous with each Passing moment.

I didn't know how much longer I could keep this up. But then, in the distance, I saw a glimmer of light, a beacon of hope in the darkness.

I drove towards IT, my heart pounding in my cheSt. As I got closer, I saw that it was the vacation Home, and my family waiting outside.

I pullEd up to the house, my hands shaking on the wheel. I got out of the car, stumbling towards my family, teaRs streaming down my facE.

They looked at me with concern, asking what was wrong. But I couldn't explain it to them, couldn't put into words the terror that I had just experienced.

All I knew was that I had broken free from the loop, that I had escaped the twisted figure and found my way home. And for that, I was grateful.

Update: It's been 2 days since I escaped the loop and arrived at the vacation home, and something seems off about my family. At first, I thought it was just my imagination playing tricks on me, but now I'm starting to believe that my family isn't really my family.

They act strange when they think I'm not looking. Sometimes they whisper to each other in some unknown language that I've never heard before. And when I ask them what they're talking about, they just give me a blank stare as if they don't understand me.

What's more unsettling is that they don't remember any of the childhood memories that we shared. It's as if those moments never existed. I brought up the time we went to the beach when I was 10, but they looked at me as if I were crazy. It's like they're trying to erase any trace of my past.

I can't shake the feeling that my family is not who they say they are. The more I think about it, the more I'm convinced that they are beings from the loop. The loop must have created them to keep me trapped and prevent me from leaving.

I constantly feel like I'm being watched, I feel as if this isn't reality. Do I have some psychotic disorder? Am I crazy? I am confused and scared. If someone knows what's happening, please reach out to me.

Update #2: I caught my younger sister sitting in her room at 2 in the morning when I went to go get some water, she was just sitting there, staring at the wall. She didn't notice me, but I'm fucking terrified. I don't know what the hell is happening but I think I'm going to try to escape.
