As I’m making this public, I suppose I should probably let you all know who I am. The residents here call me a lot of things, some not so pleasant, but I won’t share those. My name is Alexander, but I honestly don’t really mind what you call me if you need to call me anything at all.

I work as the manager of an apartment complex. It’s nothing really that interesting, a lot of paperwork and a lot of sitting around doing nothing until a resident needs me or I need to handle a problem of some kind. One of the perks is that I have my own apartment here, rent free, so I get to save some cash at least. They’re lenient with pets too so I was able to bring my cat Soot, she’s a sweetheart. 

There is an odd thing about where I work though, something that I can’t really explain how it works but it just- does.

Where I work both exists and doesn’t exist, like some strange in between state. Cryptic I know, but let me try and explain it a little more.

Normal mail can show up here and be sent from here just fine, as long as it’s properly postmarked and such. Sometimes the occasional letter or package gets lost but that’s not my problem. However, if you try giving out the address to someone, it can’t be found. GPS of any kind can’t pick up where we are, and even if you give verbal directions you practically need to hold someone’s hand to come and find this place.

And honestly god help you if you order food to come right to your apartment. I’ve had to guide so many delivery people to apartments that it’s become a routine answer for me on the phone to say, “Alright, what time is your food coming down the street?” 

I wouldn’t suggest trying to come and find this place, you’ll most likely drive yourself mad. 

Unless you’re looking to move in here, then I’ll offer assistance to finding this location. I just hope you don’t mind having some pretty odd neighbors. 

As for how I ended up being the manager of this place, I really just needed a job and I wanted something that wasn’t retail or food service. I’d been there, done that, and honestly I’ll never go back to that. I saw an ad online about a complex needing a new manager and, having some managerial experience, I put in for it. Had the interview, went normal enough, and got the job within two weeks. 

I didn’t know anything was wrong with this place when I got the job, it only started being noticeable when people were saying they legitimately couldn’t find this place, even showing that it didn’t appear at all on Google Maps. Where it was supposed to be was just empty, or the image would be corrupted. Then when I started actually meeting the residents, I began to understand a bit more, but I’ll get into that on another day. 

The job pays well, I get a rent free place to stay, I get to keep my cat, so I don’t really have room to complain. I’ll share noteworthy things as they happen though, maybe it’ll give me something to do during my downtime.
