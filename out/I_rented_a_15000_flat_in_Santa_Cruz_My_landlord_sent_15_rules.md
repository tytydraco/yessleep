I am writing this from 13A in a building called Kutumbakam. The rent is fifteen thousand a month in a place where everything decent costs six figures. I signed because I am stubborn and broke and I would rather carry guilt than debt. I send most of my pay home. I keep my head clean. I return what is not mine. That is how I was raised.

A courier gave me the key and the lease. No handshake. No landlord. The watchman at the gate spoke like he was tired of sentences. Most flats empty, he said. He did not look at me again.

I climbed to the thirteenth floor with my bag biting my shoulder. The corridor light buzzed like a trapped insect. The walls were damp to the touch. Old marigold garlands hung above doors that had not opened in a long time. Inside 13A the air felt held. Curtains stuck to the window frames. The fan wobbled when I pulled the string and then steadied into a thin hum.

My phone vibrated. An unknown number. The display picture was this building at night with its windows looking half awake.

> Mrinal, Landlord: Welcome to Kutumbakam. You are in 13A.
Read these before anything else. Do not argue. Do not ignore.
THE RULES



There were fifteen. I read them twice without breathing. They were not advice. They felt like orders from something that did not care whether I believed it.

1. Never take the lift after 11:59 PM. It will not stop where you tell it to stop. It goes places.


2. If you hear footsteps outside your door and no one is there, lock your door and step back. Do not use the peephole. Do not breathe at the crack.


3. Do not touch the door of 13B. Do not knock. If it knocks first, ignore it. Pretend you are asleep even if you are not.


4. If the intercom rings at 3:00 AM, let it ring until it is tired of you. If you answer, it learns your voice. It will call you by it.


5. If the bathroom tap runs red, close your eyes. Count to thirty. Turn it off. Do not look in the mirror while you count.


6. At night the kitchen will say your name. Even if you left the gas on, wait until morning.


7. Between the seventh and eighth floors there may be an extra landing. It is not for you. Keep walking. Do not read the number on the black door.


8. If a lift operator in khaki asks if you are new, stare at your shoes. Press any button. Do not answer him.


9. Cover every mirror after sunset. If you forget and see someone already sleeping in your bed, leave the flat immediately. Do not pack. Do not turn around.


10. If there is a knock at your window from above your floor, let it knock three times. Do not open the curtains. It cannot see you if you cannot see it.


11. Do not let your phone die inside the flat. When it is dead, reflections get ideas.


12. On the fifteenth at midnight the hallway lights will flicker and children will laugh outside your door. Do not open it. Not even enough to feed a shadow.


13. If you smell incense at 2:00 AM, step into the stairwell and wait with the light on. Do not use the lift. Return at dawn.


14. After your seventh night, change where you sleep every night. This place remembers patterns. Do not give it one.


15. Never go to the terrace. The landlord lives there.



I typed a message asking if this was a joke. Two blue ticks. No reply.

The flat settled around me like a slow exhale. The fridge gave a low hum that sounded like a throat clearing. The fan’s wobble clicked in time with my pulse. I walked to the bathroom and hung a towel over the mirror and told myself it was not obedience but habit. I ran the tap. It coughed rust and then ran clean and cold as if it had been lying in the dark under the building for a very long time.

I made a bed on the floor. The mattress left behind smelled like an animal that had died sitting up. Outside my window the local trains stitched silver lines through the night and unstitched them again. I told myself the rules were a test of nerves and I have never failed a test I could help.

The intercom rang.

Three bright beeps. Polite. The sound of a neighbor’s knuckle on a door from a life where neighbors lend sugar.

I looked at my phone. It was 3:00 AM. Not 2:59. Not 3:01. The minute sat there like an eye.

I stayed on the floor and let it ring. Between the beeps I could hear the small private noises a building makes when it thinks no one is listening. Water moved somewhere like a slow swallow. Wires ticked as if they had cooled and then changed their minds. A draft fingered the space under my door and retreated and came again. The intercom rang five times. On the sixth it paused. On the seventh it stopped.

The silence after tasted like metal on the back of my tongue. I let my breath out. I did not realize I had been holding it.

In the hall the lift dinged.

I had not pressed the button. No one on my floor had footsteps to go with it. It was only that cheerful bell, as if something had arrived for someone who did not exist. The sound crawled under my skin and sat down there.

The peephole made a sound too. A small careful click. The sound of an eyelid, not a machine.

I kept my eyes on the ceiling. The fan pulled warm air down and braided it. The room smelled faintly of old incense and wet concrete. From above came three knocks on a window. One two three. High and measured and patient.

I did not open the curtains. I did not move.

My phone lay beside me with the rules bright on the screen. The words felt colder now.

It will not stop where you tell it to stop.
Do not breathe at the crack.
It learns your voice.
Never go to the terrace.

I am writing this now while it is quiet. I am not injured. I am not dreaming. I am not making this up for points. I am a decent man who works hard and pays on time and I am telling you the truth.

I will follow the rules.

For now.

Edit 1: For those in the comments saying get out of the house, I am a 20 year old broke student and I spent my last rupee to get here. I have to make this work. I am hoping I get time to go for auditions. If I leave, I have nowhere to go tonight

Edit 2: I couldn’t sleep, so I started unpacking. The bedroom has this built-in cupboard, yellowed laminate, one shutter cracked like a vein. The bottom drawer screeched when I pulled it out, and the back panel felt soft, like it wasn’t real wood.

I pressed, and the whole thing flexed. A coin popped it loose. Behind it—just a hollow gap. Too neat to be an accident. Too empty to be safe.

I slid my hand in and touched fabric. Old. Damp. Wrapped around a small book.

The cover is cracked leather, flaking in my palm. The corners are greasy from use. It reeks of jaggery and stale oil, like festival sweets gone sour. 

It's a diary 

I’m not posting what’s written in it. Not yet. 
Will try to get some sleep
