I never believed in ghosts or cryptids, they just never made sense to me until i moved into my new house. It was an old creaky and worn down, it was the kind if house that had stories but i didn't care, i was looking for something cheap and this was it. 

The first night in my house i heard the floors creaking above me, i assumed it was because old the house was so old and i brushed it off, but the second night was different. 

I was mindlessly watching TV almost falling asleep my eyes closing with me almost unable to open them more when i heard a soft deliberate thump, it happened over and over again like someone was walking above me and it started me. 

My heart was pounding as i went upstairs and turned on the lights, at first i saw nothing but when i was about to walk deeper a long, spindly limb reached out from the end of the hallway, its skin stretched tight over too-thin bones then another limb followed, then another, until the thing emerged fully from the hallway. 

It was tall, its body hunched and twisted, like it didnâ€™t quite fit in its own skin. Its face was blank, except for a wide, crooked mouth that stretched across its head, it's body was elongated like a snake but it looked nothing like one, I'd never seen anything like it and i was confused how i didn't see it the first night or why it didn't disturb me when i was in my bedroom, suddenly let out a groan before slowly walking towards me. 

I ran down half expecting it to chase after me but it didn't, it never came down, i called the police and two police officers came, i told them that i had a robber upstairs because otherwise they wouldn't believe me, they went upstairs to investigate and never came back down. 

I was afraid the police would suspect me for being the cause of two missing police officers but they never came, a week later i was so anxious with that thing still up there i called my landlord and told him a lie like i did to the police officers, when he went up i instantly started regretting my decision and shouted for him to get down, it has been months now i haven't heard from him since, i felt really guilty for luring him into his death for no reason.

The last person who i lost to that thing was my brother, he came to congratulate me for getting my new house and i told him specifically to not go upstairs, i was sweating and nervous telling him that and he seemed confused and asked me why and i told him to just not go. 

Maybe if i didn't tell him and just kept doing things with him to keep him down he'd still be here, i miss him so much, i heard him yelling "What the hell is this thing up here", i didn't run to try and save him, i knew it was too late at that point. 

That thing has been up there ever since, i hear it's groaning haunting me every night, I tried to sell my house but no one is buying it so im stuck here, I've been sleeping in the spare downstairs bedroom and i hear the same thumps walk above me every night. 

I don't know what that thing is or what it wants, not sure where it came from, i don't know if there are more of it up there, but for now i call it the friend upstairs.
