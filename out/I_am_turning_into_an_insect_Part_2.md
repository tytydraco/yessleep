Hello everyone, My name is Thomas baker, and as you can see, I am still turning into an insect.

If you were wondering how I am keeping this charged, I happened to have my spare charger on me when they abducted me, And my cell has a basic outlet.

Anyways, Today I tried to escape the complex, but things didn't go according to plan.

I took a hairpin out of my hair, Since they had not searched me, and used it to pick the lock to my room, Using a handy tutorial online.

Once I heard the final click, I opened the door.

No one was outside, So I made my way down the hall and was greeted with a horrible sight.

Countless like me, A fat man with compound eyes vomitting on the floor, A lady struggling to get used to her new, colorful wings, and a boy, a poor, innocent little boy about 10 years old, whimpering in pain as his new claws burst through his forearms.

I also saw the digital map on the wall, I was in "Sector C, Insecta Saipens transitory rooms".

What concerned me more, was the fact that there was a non-transitory room, which I could only predict was the endgame here, My inevitable fate.

The fate I would and will do anything to avoid.

Regardless, I was about to unlock the door to the child's room, when I saw a group of guards round the corner.

Shit, shit, shit!

Just as I turned around to run, I felt a burning agony in my leg, I had been shot.

Due to that being my good leg, I immediately fell to the floor, And I tried and tried to stand, but my legs were too weak, especially now that the one which would normally bear most of my weight was damaged.

Once the armored men caught up with me, I was subjected to a form of torture.

They kicked me over and over, throwing me against the wall and even punching me, then one of them shoved a pistol into my mouth and told me I would die if I wasn't useful.

Then, I felt a blunt force connect with the back of my neck, And I passed out.

When I awoke, I had been stripped of any pins I could use to pick the lock, And most of my injuries, Asides from the bullet wound, were untreated.

This is torment, I am in hell, I have sinned horribly and these demons punish me for it.

Soon, I have a feeling I will start showing signs, just like those others, They still feed me regularly, I tried to starve myself one time, big mistake.

While I did feel the strange feeling begin to halt for a while, once they noticed I was not touching the food, I was subjected to more torment.

An armored guard would enter the room and slowly, painfully force feed all of it to me, and if I tried to choke myself, He would give me an extremely unethical form of heimlech manuver in order to save me from dying, but not from suffering.

In one instance, I tried to bite his glove with my suspiciously hardening teeth, and in response, He punched me in the face, Giving me a swollen lip and black eye.

After 4 days of compliance on my behalf, and multiple cases of being bloodied by the guard, I was finally granted the basic freedom of not being choked and beaten daily.

While I don't have a pin on me, I have felt my bones strengthening and muscles hardening as of late, So I think I could beat down the wooden door with a few strikes if I was determined enough, But not yet.

Even now, My body has been feeling stranger and stranger, They promised that I would get a better room once I behaved, But I have a feeling they would have to move me regardless once... I molt..

I can hear a few guards patrolling my room right now, Waiting to see if I will try to escape, And if I do, they will beat me like there is no tomorrow.

Any suggestions?
