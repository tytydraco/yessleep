For years I have attempted to pierce my soul past the veil of this reality that many of us either call home or hell, and behold the image of whatever lies beyond, so that i may know, and perhaps others may know. its been difficult, but after what I experienced I feel like it only brought suffering unto me, suffering of such magnitude and time that it could last generations.



I have forgotten what spiritual revelation I realized or rite I performed which caused or authorized my transcendence. but I found myself in a space, the memories of my life were so fleeting, I could barely remember my name, and my body felt alien to me. I dropped my hands down and I saw great cascades of dust, storms mingling with nebulas, and worlds adorned with our great works, statues of our higher selves and mile long plaques of our accomplishments. I was driven into tears that someone such as myself, saw these wonders, and our great works, I wish I had a book on me, a camera, anything to have recorded this. watching such wonders brought happiness to my soul, but I weep knowing I will never be able to tell you guys of what accomplishments we will make.



After witnessing such wonders, a word came to my head, Heaven. It felt like 500 years that I stared and studied these works of the great deeds that everyone have and will ever make. but as great and beautiful as these cosmic works of art that were, I saw the outskirts of an aura, It was almost like plasma. This urge to find the source overcame me, but I felt vertigo, and looked down. I was standing on a balcony adorned in jewels, I understood the dimensions of those jewels while I was transcended, but I now don't know what shape they were. I think that where ever I was, It was a higher dimension beyond our three dimensional one. My eyes were lost, The aura was everywhere, it almost blinded me. it felt like 1900 years passed, while I was lost in the aura, I wish I was lost in that aura until I was released from that place.



I blinked when I saw the source of the aura, and a word came to me 'God' any interpretation from all religious scholars and their works even atheists didn't prepare me for what I saw, but at the time, and even now such of a word didn't feel like it was enough, as matter of a fact, I think its quite the insulting slur to call such of a thing. I still remember the sudden overwhelming emotions.



but I now that I look back on that memory with horror and anguish. it was being, an entity, an intelligence manifested as something that can be described with words that I cannot remember, but I still remember that fleeting feeling, it was like my mind was tearing itself apart just trying to handle the image of this entity, I remember what that thing looked like.



whenever I close my eyes I see the light rays of its aura as they bend around the gravitational field of its body. but I Will Not tell you what it looked like, I will never tell you or anyone what the entity looked like, I will die taking the image of that being into the grave with me. Even if whatever waits for me in death, is no consciousness, blackness, and forgetfulness forever. that will be more favorable then the memory of that entity that I am cursed to always remember for as long as I live.



I forgot the concept of time for here onward as I studied the entity. everything else around me almost stopped existing. I think at that time it was only me and that thing. it was completely stationary, static, almost frozen in time. I sensed tremendous amounts of will emanating from this thing. you would've called it by a word, but I have forgotten that word. I discovered that no temptation wins over this being, which is why its static.



I remember then hearing holy lullabies, and moans from behind me. I turned around, and saw a great alcazar. it must've been the size of the star that we orbit around. within it were these great mansions, constantly moving at a slow majestic pace. it was so beautiful, but it felt incomplete. I couldn't figure out what it missed but I know now. fortunately at the time I realized that this huge alcazar was still under construction, and was being constructed by these beings. they were these giant sentient plants, literal walking gardens.



an urge came to me to tend to the plants of these beings, but the urge was weak, it didn't engulf my will, nor my soul. the being looked down and beheld me in its eyes as I beheld it in my eyes. It looked at me with such aw but it didn't feel completely aw, more or so of confusion. Have you ever seen something that shouldn't work, but is somehow working? That is what I sensed from this being greater than me. I think it saw me as a creature, of such fundamental mechanics that shouldn't be able operate together yet do. moans, and lullabies emanated from this creature, although sounding confused. and I walked past this creature and onto a bridge to that alcazar.



Upon a closer approach, I saw more of those huge sentient gardens were in that alcazar, and I saw them constructing the alcazar. the act of looking at the construction was entertaining, but it felt like it could've been better, I tried to figure what they need but my mind just couldn't find out what was missing, but now I unfortunately know. I walked ever deeper into that place, I found myself in mazes lost for what may have been centuries, having the time of my life, feeling a sense of being lost that was originally unfathomable to me, before I calculated the halls to freedom, so many times. I put on my fatigues, held a weapon, and fought in wars of man. wars our species have fought and still remember or forgotten.



I didn't know that the British Empire fought a war with the Catholics, yet I fought in, died in, fought in, and died in such of a war. I didn't know Japan conquered Hawaii in 1701 and the invaded only reclaimed their sovereignty after 20 bloody years of rebellion but as much as I want to say that this was fake, I fought in, and died in, in such of a war over and over again. I didn't know that it was a war between India and the Balkans that caused World War 2 to happen in the first place. yet as wrong as it sounded, I fought in and died in that entire war, over and over. I couldn't have guessed that the Venusian Commonwealth would go to war with the Federal Asteroid Belt Colonies, yet I fought in and died in such of a war over and over again.



I saw the Helcroman Hegemony engage in a five hundred years war with the Cosmic Alliance of the Orion Nebula, yet for every second all of those five hundred years, I fought in and died in that war. I don't know what other wars I fought in the past, present, or future. I died, was revived, killed, been killed, violated, then was defiled, things happened to me both terrifying and wonderous and I had all these things happen to me, all out of an urge of morbid curiosity, but no matter what I always remembered that being I saw. despite what I did and what had happened to me, it wasn't as much as looking at that thing, just simply looking at that thing.

I tried to do what I had originally done, part take in wars that I had participated in before, but they weren't fulfilling nor entertaining to me. as a matter of a fact being in those wars, those places of entertainment where my pleasures and fantasies, curious, righteous, evil, dark, degenerated, both good and bad were not entertaining anymore. the very experience of being inside of that place, and not looking at that being was like being in hell. but I felt like those creatures still enjoyed me spoiling myself in their great work, it must've given them such gratification to see their creation fulfilling its purpose.



But my interest was gone, it was hard but I slowly dragged myself walking away from their creation, much to their disappointment and sadness. now that I look back on those memories, I must've been in that place for 10,000 years, but even with that much time, I hadn't experienced 0.1% of what that place had to offer. but I walked out from that place, and once more beheld the image of that being.



the completeness came back to me. and that was it. I wanted to do something for that being that I called 'God'. but the very concept was separated from my mind, I sensed that feeling again, that my mind was tearing itself apart trying to behold this being. I tried to figure out how to remember these acts that I wanted to do for this being, these acts that I did for others, but I always found myself back to that feeling of completeness, but no emotion being felt. I tried to recall those memories of those experiences, times in human history I went through, games I played, anything. I tried to remember those religions of the past, how they changed to our time, and how the religions will adapt, evolve, and many of which die in the future.



I tried to remember what that thing those people do when they bowed down to their idols, when they held their eyes closed, when they enclosed their minds to the world and looked inwards. I don't know how long I tried to find that word, that thought, that concept. maybe a year, maybe a trillion. but I remember a great horror coming to me as my realization hit me, I talked to it, it felt like I was inventing speech. "I understand now" I said to that thing, and it moved in reaction. I had satisfied it.



my soul was sent back into my body, in this universe, in this galaxy, in this solar system, on this earth, in my room, on my bed, I woke up and wept. and there that horror grew on me, as much as I better understood that horror. I fell into insanity, of what I now know.



the purpose of that place was revealed to me. it was still being made to house our souls, despite the size of that place my pleasures good and evil were fulfilled, it was still not complete, many of us alive, dead, yet to be born. would not be entertained within that place, despite how huge it was. but when its complete, our souls will be taken there, beyond the bridge, before that being. when that place is completed, and you die, ending up there, close your eyes, cover your ears with your hands, turn around in the complete opposite direction, run to the bridge, beyond it, and don't open your eyes until you hear your foot steps echoing.



Do Not behold the image of that entity that I foolishly called God. if you did what I did, the very concept of worship, love, anything similar will be taken out of your mind. it will be hard, you may have your fantasies made real for millennia maybe even eons, but that temptation to come back to that being will come to you. 



you'll see light coming from it, Do Not let that light over take you, ignore it, find forgetfulness in any hedonism your heart commands and begs you to experience, and when you've been to every corner of that place and felt all rewards and punishments for countless times, then you will be attracted back to that being, when all else becomes numbing, you will behold its image, and then it may let you worship it, if so you will feel such gratitude that'll last for eternity, you might achieve the Ultimate Salvation.



As for me, I was sent there early, before the beings there were able to fully construct the place. I don't why but if I had taken myself there, then I regret my decision. I don't know what places my soul will be sent to when I finally die, I'm not scared of the kiss of death anymore, for I have felt its kiss countless times, the only thing I fear is seeing that being again.
