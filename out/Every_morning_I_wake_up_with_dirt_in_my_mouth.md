Every night I dream of rot and worms. Every morning I wake with dirt in my mouth, my nails blackened at the edges. I have to carefully rinse my eyes until my vision is no longer blurred, and even so, sometimes an infection manages to take hold. I didn’t do anything in particular to deserve this, I’d say, except maybe dig where I shouldn’t have. So, I ask you to listen carefully. Where did you go today? What did you do? From the moment you woke up until now, what horrid ground did you step on?

It’s spreading fast now. At the start it was a few localised incidents in the western part of the continent, and some further up north in Canada. We didn’t know what to make of it at first, and orders to investigate didn’t come until later. For a couple of months it was water-cooler gossip and hushed whispers in the cantina. A missing farmer turning up, changed. Rumours of mass suicides in the Appalachia. Sightings of… something. Every witness Op-Grid interviewed spoke in riddles and fevered poetry. The fog-of-war was thick, so much so that it was decided we no longer had the option of resolving the situation from our office. The official mandate was titled *Proactive Response to the Mole Conundrum.* A tad on the nose perhaps, but that’s what humans do: we find patterns. We knew very little about it all, but what we did know was that there was some connection to the ground, and what animal do we most often associate with that?

There’s a kind of fear that comes not from what you see, but from what hides between the pieces. When truth arrives in fragments; glimpses, murmurs, signs without meaning. It leaves the rest to the imagination, and that is where the real horror takes root. The mind stitches shadows into shapes, gives weight to the silence, turns the unknown into something vast and breathing. By the time we were deployed, that uncertainty had already wormed its way into me. I think the others felt it too, even if none of us said it out loud.

We arrived on site just as the morning sun peeked over the pine. On our way to town, we saw scattered, rusted trucks in the fields. The general store was boarded up, covered in graffiti and seemed to have been abandoned long ago. Some people roamed the streets but wore no joy on their faces, they stared straight, through anything that might have been in front of them. But the thing that stood out was how disheveled they looked; dirt-caked skin, torn clothes and vacant eyes. 

This particular town was a hotbed. In many cases, a town suffered maybe one or two incidents a month. Those were much easier to remedy. Here, we couldn’t use our normal strategies, everyone seemed to have been taken. Imagine the headlines: “Mass Murder in Rust-Belt Town.” No, here we had to improvise.

We did our rounds, speaking to anyone still capable of forming a sentence. Most responses were incoherent, groans, muttering, the occasional mention of worms. No one remembered where they’d been taken. Until we struck gold.

As my team of four stood on the porch of the David-residence, waiting for someone to open the door, I had a weird feeling gently pass through me. It wasn’t an emotional feeling, if that makes sense, it was more of a physical one. Something was placed on top of my head, something that had weight to it. It felt as if it pushed me downwards, through the planks and into the dirt. Trying to plant me in the mulch of an orchard that wasn’t meant for me. It was brief, but I managed to snap out of it only when Mr. David finally opened the door.

“Hey, boys,” he said and motioned for us to come in.

It was obvious he’d been crying. I wondered if he was whole, or if he too had been taken. But for a man in his situation, crying seems like the natural response. I’m just surprised he still held it together, even though he was tearing at the seams. Before we even entered his living room I could hear the dampened sobs of a woman somewhere in the house. The carpet bore dried mud and faint footprints. His wife, he explained. 

Sometime ago, she had been unlucky. Mr and Mrs. David had been out on a walk. They reached a clearing and started setting up a small picnic blanket. Mr. David was busy uncapping jars of mayonnaise and mustard, while his wife was a few steps away, listening for birds and taking in the greenery. After a while, he noticed how she hadn’t spoken a word since they arrived and turned towards her. She stood completely still, not responding to him when he called out to her. Before he could react, she walked towards a patch of wet mud and disappeared, swallowed by the earth. However, he couldn’t tell us if he was more horrified by that sight, or when she later that night knocked on the door of their house and called his name in a raspy voice. 

“Now,” he explained, “she is absent by day, and gone by night.”

“Gone?” I asked.

“See, I-” he paused, “I’ve had trouble sleeping since then, dreams, or nightmares… I wake up in the middle of the night sometimes,” he said, averting his gaze towards the fireplace, where a small flame burned. A picture fram rested on top, turned towards the wall. I couldn’t tell if he was looking at that, or the shotgun that hung above, “all I know, she is never in bed when I do.”

He pointed at the window, “One night I heard noises coming from our backyard. I went down to see what was going on and… She was out there, eating the dirt. She pleaded with me, ‘it tastes sweet, dear’, but I was disgusted,” he glanced towards the fireplace again.

“Sorry, she was eating it?” One of my colleagues asked.

“Same thing other folk in town do, I suppose,” he said, “explains the filth, doesn’t it?”

We’d seen this very thing before, in other towns and other states. All the people who’d been taken, without fail, would be covered in dirt and bruises. My personal guess was that something provoked them to return to where it happened, burrowing, again tasting the dirt that poisoned them. Maybe something called to them. But new information came all the time. This was odd, novel and the situation had slowly escalated to unseen territory. This case made me uneasy in ways I had never experienced before, and I suspect the higher brass felt the same based on leaked e-mails I got my hands on later.

Mr. David was tired, weary. We decided he had experienced enough excitement for one day and thanked him for his time, but not before asking him to point us in the direction of where it happened. He asked for one of our maps, pulled a pencil from his back pocket and drew a circle in red ink around a small area in the woods south of town. As we walked out, the sobs of the woman had penetrated my ears. I felt bad for her as much as you could without ever meeting her. Mr. David looked resigned as he closed the door.

We didn’t even get to the end of the block before we heard a muffled gunshot reverberate through the streets. 

As we made our way into the woods, that feeling came again. This time, it started at my feet. I was being pulled down by the unseen. I hunched over and vomited.

“You okay?” Three—I never bothered to learn their names—asked.

I opened my field kit, scrambled for a rag, and wiped the corners of my mouth, “I don’t know.”

We didn’t talk much on our hike. It was not that we didn’t want to. I noticed many things; small, perfectly round sinkholes, moss growing in weird shapes and on strange places, a fungus I didn’t recognise. But there was this tension in the air, as if we spoke about the phenomena we observed, It would notice us. What that was, exactly, I didn’t know.

The silence was broken by Two, “I don’t like this, nothing makes sense. With every new piece, the puzzle becomes larger, or it morphs. You’ve all read the first reports right? That man was sick,” she said.

“Yeah, kept going on and on about the same things… ‘Friend of the worms’, ‘it’s telling me how to go home’, ‘I’m looking for my other name’, fucking insane,” Three responded.

“Exactly, he was sick, and I don’t get it. He couldn’t give the Bureau one single, actionable bit of information, yet he knew that something in him had changed. He longed to go back, but he knew it would do him no good.”

“It is a disease,” Four said.

“A disease?”

“I’ve done a lot of shit for this agency, like you. Killed and maimed things, captured all kinds of creatures. I could touch them, poke them. I could push my knife into some kind of flesh, or through scales, and I knew they’d die. In that way, I created my own safety.”

Two didn’t follow, “And?”

“Nobody has seen what causes all this, why do you think that is?” Four asked, but got no response, “Because it doesn’t exist. It isn’t a virus, or a fungus, or a disease in the biological sense. It is a correction.”

Quiet fell upon us. I wanted them to stop talking. I wanted to forget everything I knew, go home, quit and then put my savings into a ticket to Paris. I wanted to get as far away as possible from the place we were moving towards. But every time I thought about pulling rank and aborting the mission, that feeling welled up again. So, instead I offered my perspective.

“I think,” I said, “the earth is angry.”

We walked another twenty minutes and with every step we took, the birdsong we could hear so clearly before faded more and more. Two and Three stopped by a tree, covered by a particularly interesting pattern of fungus, to grab some samples. Again, I thought about turning back, but deep down I knew that there was only one way forward. I gestured towards Four and on we went. 

I found myself obsessing over the red circle on the map. It was child-like in its shaky shape, but drawn with intent I had never seen before. Thinking back, Mr. David had closed his full fist around the crayon he used--or was it a pencil?--and struggled mightily to finish the directions. In hindsight it almost felt like a sacrifice of some sort. I continued mulling over this as we journeyed deeper into the forest. The shrubbery became thicker, the trees grew closer and the little light from the afternoon sun barely pierced the canopy anymore. 

“Here we are,” Four said.

I confirmed what he suspected by matching the elevation I could see with that on the map, but truth be told, I wouldn’t have needed to. The energy of that place was humming. I convinced myself I could hear speech echoing between the birch, but if so, it was in no tongue I knew. I couldn’t muse on that long before we heard something rustling in the distance.

“Get down,” I whispered.

We dropped. We huddled close. Somehow, it felt nice to be in obvious danger for once. This whole trip had been nothing but tension and shadows, the pot had been simmering. Now, it was starting to boil. A man entered our view. He was naked, but I recognised him from town earlier. He scanned the area relentlessly, but thankfully he didn’t spot us. Don’t know what would’ve happened if he did. Every time he looked towards us I felt towers on my back. Heavy, ancient structures weighing me down. I felt my pulse slow down, and I felt pieces of gravel in my veins. I could almost taste what so many had talked about, I was close to understanding how sweet the dirt was. Down on the ground, I sensed the vibrations of millions of earthworms underneath, moving towards me, waiting to squirm into my every orifice and then drag me down, bury me. Taking me home. My true home.

Then the man looked away, and I was left horrified by my own thoughts. There was an immediate danger present, even if I couldn't see the full picture. It was clawing at my mind, and I could barely resist its pull anymore. 

When the man was content by his reconnaissance, he lay on his back, spreading his limbs like he was making a snow angel. Then the laughing started. Short bursts of maniacal, harrowing sounds that blurred the line between human and animal. He rolled around in the mud, flailing like a fish out of water. Each time he faced the ground I could see him aggressively biting the dirt. Whenever he… ate, he sounded more like a rabid dog than a pharmacist, teacher or whatever he had been in his previous life. Four flinched, covered his ears and looked away, but I couldn’t do the same.

The ritual continued for an uncomfortable amount of time, until he finally stopped rolling, on his back. Silence fell on the forest, only broken up by the loud panting of the man. Then, we heard a soft crack. And another. His limbs started bending in odd ways. They turned so that his shoulders pointed downwards. He was still on his back when he lifted himself up. He crawled around on all fours, but his torso still pointed towards the sky, a monstrous abomination. A human, imitating the most horrid of spiders, so far from God’s grace that it made me, a non-believer, shudder. To fulfil the transformation, his neck snapped, rotating his face towards the ground. When he—it—moved around, it was with inhuman speed and vigour.

As if the ground itself had waited for this, it opened up. A small sinkhole appeared, at first no wider than a log of firewood. But it grew, and it grew. There was no rumbling, no ear-shattering cracks. There were no sounds one would expect from the planet opening its wide gape, just the wet slurps and squelching of mud sliding downwards. 

The man, or whatever it now was, cheered. He crawled to the edge of the hole and stopped. Its head turned towards me and I froze. I had always thought the old adage of one’s life flashing before their eyes was made up, an old wive’s tale. I thought it was meant to relieve dying men of their worries, and give them hope that they could experience love and warmth one last time. But then and there, I witnessed every choice I had ever made in my life. Everything that had led up to this. 

Then it just… dove in. And the feeling was back. I cannot explain the rationale behind what I did next. I do not think I will ever comprehend the forces that acted upon me. I sensed the thing behind the thing. I peeked through the curtains of reality, and something met my gaze. It reached out and placed an appendage, or a tendril, on my head.

I ran towards the hole as fast as I could and managed to catch a glimpse of the creature. I saw its body twist and break, mud entering its mouth. And just before the hole closed, it shot me a wide, awful grin.

And that was it. 

They wouldn’t listen to me on the way back. Two cried the entire trek, Four had checked out. I tried to get them to understand what I had seen. I tried to make them understand what I had learned. I wanted to show them, take them with me. For the first time, I felt love for them.

I wanted to bring them home.

That was one part of me, the one that was taken. It surfaces every once and again, but more often lately. I can still make my own choices most of the time, but that too is slipping. When I sleep, I suspect the other me comes out fully. I dream of old rot and worms, and when I wake up I’m a feet under ground, mouth filled with dirt. Those times, I have to claw myself up to the surface.

FUBAR. They’re pulling out.

If there is one thing I can do before I return home, it is to warn you. I hope you heed my word.

I’ve woken with worms in my throat. I know what comes next. And now, so do you. The dirt will come for you.
