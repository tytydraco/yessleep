It started 23 days ago. A package arrived on my doorstep, slapped with an Amazon logo but no Prime tape, no branding, just plain brown cardboard. I order stuff constantly: late-night impulse buys, weird gadgets from algorithm recommendations, half-conscious browsing at 3 a.m. But this time, I hadn’t ordered anything. I scoured my emails, my order history, my cart. Nothing. Not a trace.

The box looked wrong. A fragile sticker, yellowed and curling, seemed like it belonged on a crate from the 1940s. The shipping label was handwritten in jet-black ink, my full name spelled perfectly, but the letters were jagged, like whoever wrote it was trembling or hadn’t held a pen in centuries. The delivery date? March 3, 1903. I laughed, a nervous chuckle, thinking it was a prank. Maybe a friend messing with me. But my social circle is small, and nobody I know would go this far.

I brought the box inside, my curiosity outweighing my unease. The cardboard was damp, though it hadn’t rained in days. I cut it open, and a smell hit me: wet soil and burnt cinnamon, sharp enough to make my eyes water. Inside was a smooth, black, palm-sized egg, heavy as a brick and freezing cold. It was wrapped in tattered black silk that clung to my fingers like cobwebs. No receipt, no manual, no bubble wrap. Just the egg, its surface etched with symbols that twisted under my gaze, like they were moving. I couldn’t place the language, if it even was one. It felt ancient, wrong.

Below the symbols, in tiny, jagged English letters, it read: Obsidian Egg of the Second Womb.
I held it for maybe five seconds. It pulsed, not like a vibration, but a heartbeat, slow and deliberate. My teeth ached, a sharp pain shooting through my jaw. I dropped it onto the table, my fingertips burning, red and tingling like I’d touched dry ice. For hours afterward, I was dizzy, feverish, my vision swimming. I thought I was sick, but no thermometer could explain the heat in my bones. I wrapped the egg back in its silk, stuffed it into the box, sealed it with three layers of packing tape, and scheduled a return through Amazon.

Their chat was useless. I gave the tracking number from the label, but no record existed. The rep, “CustomerServiceBot_47,” typed, “One moment please,” over and over, like a broken record. Then my laptop screeched, a high-pitched wail, and the screen flickered with static. The chat closed itself. I reopened it, heart pounding. A new rep appeared, no name, just a blank gray icon.

“Proceed with return,” they typed. “But it won’t matter.”

A chill ran through me. I should’ve stopped there. I should’ve burned the box and moved to another state.

The next day, I took it to the post office. The woman at the counter, her nametag reading “Marge,” didn’t blink when I handed it over. She weighed it, her hands steady, and said, “We’ve seen this before.” Her voice was flat, like she was reading a script. I asked what she meant, my mouth dry. She smiled, her teeth gray and uneven, like pebbles worn smooth by a river. “Some packages don’t stay gone,” she said, then turned away, dismissing me.

That night, I woke up choking, my throat burning like I’d swallowed sand. I’d dreamed of something crawling into my mouth, soft and wriggling, tasting of ash. I sat up, gasping, and felt a weight on my chest. The box was there. Same cardboard, same label, same egg inside. I screamed, hurling it across the room. It landed softly, impossibly, like it weighed nothing.

I didn’t sleep again that night. I sat on my couch, staring at the box, convincing myself I was losing it. Maybe I’d imagined the post office trip. Maybe I’d never left the house. But the receipt from the counter was in my pocket, timestamped, real.
Over the next week, I tried everything to get rid of it. I doused it in lighter fluid and set it ablaze in my backyard. The flames turned green, spitting sparks, but the box didn’t burn. I tossed it into a river, watching it sink. It was back on my kitchen counter by morning, dripping water that smelled like decay. I buried it three feet deep in a vacant lot. That night, it was under my pillow, dirt clinging to the silk.

I started losing time. I’d blink, and hours would vanish. I found myself standing in my kitchen, holding a knife I didn’t remember picking up, the egg on the counter, humming softly. I left it in a church, slipping it into the donation box during a Sunday service. The priest’s eyes followed me as I left, his sermon faltering. The next morning, the box was in my mailbox.

I tried a public locker at a gym, setting a passcode only I knew. When I checked the next day, the locker was empty, but the egg was in my gym bag, warm to the touch. I dropped it at a train station’s lost and found, sprinting away like a criminal. It was waiting in my car’s passenger seat, the seatbelt buckled around it.

Desperate, I mailed it to a fake address across the country, no return label, wrapped in duct tape. I tracked the package online. It arrived, got delivered. I called the random house, posing as a neighbor asking about a misdelivered item. The woman on the phone sounded old, her voice creaking like a rusty hinge. “That box was never meant for us,” she said. “You should keep it. It’s chosen you.” She hung up before I could speak.
The egg was changing. Its pulses grew stronger, more frequent, like it was waking up. It hummed when I entered the room, a low drone that made my bones itch. One night, it spoke. A voice like dry leaves scraping concrete whispered my name from the box. I froze, my heart slamming against my ribs. I didn’t open it. I couldn’t.

The world around me started to crack. I saw shadows at the foot of my bed, tall and thin, their mouths moving backward, like they were speaking in reverse. I heard music, tinny 1920s jazz, coming from a basement I don’t have. My reflection in the bathroom mirror was wrong, my eyes too large, my skin too pale, my smile not mine. I stopped looking in mirrors.

People acted strange. My coworker, Jen, stared at me during a meeting and asked, “Has it touched your blood yet?” Her voice was calm, like she was asking about the weather. When I demanded she explain, she blinked, confused, and said she hadn’t spoken. My neighbor, an old man who usually ignored me, knocked on my door at midnight. He handed me a rusted key and said, “You’ll need this when it hatches.” I slammed the door in his face, but the key was in my pocket the next morning.
I went to my therapist, hoping for answers. I told her about the egg, the box, the hallucinations. She nodded, scribbling notes, and said I was manifesting psychosis from stress. She handed me a referral to a psychiatrist. The paper felt heavy, like it was made of lead. By the time I got home, it had crumbled to ash in my pocket. I called her office to confirm the appointment. The receptionist said my therapist had no record of our session.

I was unraveling. My skin itched constantly, like something was crawling beneath it. My dreams were vivid, filled with images of a red sky and a pulsing black egg the size of a mountain. I woke up with salt in my mouth, my tongue raw. I found scratches on my arms, too deep to be from my own nails, forming patterns that matched the egg’s symbols.

I fled to a hotel in another town, leaving my phone, wallet, everything behind. I paid in cash, checked in under a fake name, and locked the door. I thought I’d escaped. But when I pulled back the bedsheets, the egg was there, nestled on the pillow, its surface gleaming like wet ink.

I screamed until my throat bled. The front desk clerk, a bored twenty-something, said I’d checked in holding the box. I hadn’t. I know I hadn’t. That night, the hotel walls bled, dark liquid seeping from the wallpaper. The mirrors shimmered, showing me standing in a field under a red sky, the egg cradled in my hands. I lost time again. I woke on the floor, black ink under my fingernails, and a phrase carved into my leg: The Second Womb Opens Through You.

I tried one last time to get rid of it. Yesterday, I mailed it again: gloves, fake name, fake address, three layers of duct tape, dropped at a UPS box in a strip mall. I watched the clerk scan it, saw it disappear into the sorting room. I felt a flicker of hope.

This morning, I woke to something wriggling under my blanket. My stomach lurched. It was the egg, changed again. A crack ran along its side, glowing red, like veins under translucent skin. Something blinked at me from the opening, a single wet eye that held my gaze. I haven’t touched it since. I feel it watching me, even when I close my eyes. I haven’t slept in four days.

I don’t think I will.

Last night, I vomited salt water, thick and briny, until I gagged. My teeth are loosening, wobbling in their sockets. My skin feels too tight, like it’s stretching to make room for something else. I found more scratches on my chest, forming words I can’t read but somehow understand: Soon.
The egg whispered again, clearer this time: Delivery successful. Embryo viable.

I’m writing this because I know what’s coming. I can feel it growing inside me, not in my body but in my mind, my soul, like a seed taking root. The air in my apartment is heavy, thick with the smell of cinnamon and soil. The shadows are longer now, and they don’t move when I do.

If you get a package with no return address, no order history, wrapped in black silk, smelling of cinnamon and soil, don’t open it. Don’t touch the egg. Burn your house down if you have to. Run and never stop.

It’s not a product. It’s a seed.

And you’re just the soil it grows in.
