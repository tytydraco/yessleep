   
The long, bright headlights of my Jeep lit up the dark road in front of me. On either side of the car, tall pines crept up and branched out over the road like claws, stripped of their leaves. Ahead of me, a near-full moon peeked out over the inky rolling hills of West Virginia. It was late December, just a few days before New Year’s Eve. I had been on the road for a few hours now, and I could feel my legs beginning to fall asleep. At first, I had been listening to an audiobook of a romance I had found on Kindle, but now I had switched to loud country music, my favorite genre. As my vision had started to slip, I rolled down the windows and let the chilly winter air hit me. It helped a little, but not enough.   
I was only an hour away from my hometown, but I decided I should pull into a gas station anyway. It was decrepit—a small one on the side of the road that looked like it hadn’t been updated in 40 years. The pumps weren’t even digital. If it wasn’t for the light shining from the dirty windows, I would have assumed it was closed down. There was one other single car parked underneath the collapsed roof—a red, beat-up truck.  
 I wasn’t one to get scared easily, but even I couldn’t deny the creepiness of places like this in the middle of nowhere. A lot of other people I knew would probably be scared to be somewhere like this alone at night. But not me. I kept a small pistol in my purse or car at all times.   
Inside, there was one single man working the counter. He was old, bald, and overweight.  
“Hiya, sweetheart.” He smiled at me widely. Seeing his yellow teeth, I held back a cringe.   
“Hi, can I just get, uh, 50 on the first pump?” I asked with a small smile back.   
“Sure thang.”   
As soon as I paid, I was heading out of the gas station. I considered staying and buying a water, but I wanted to get on the road. I was nervous about my destination and just wanted to get the long-awaited meeting out of the way. As I opened the glass door, two bright headlights flashed across me, causing me to squint. Another car was pulling up, a much newer pickup truck. I ignored it and walked to my Jeep. But as I reached for the gas pump, a voice called my name.  
“Eliza Bethany?”  
I spun around to see a man stepping out of the truck. He was average height with short, almost white, blonde hair. I recognized him almost instantly.   
“Ben? Benjamin Collins?” I smiled. He returned it, leaning on the pump.  
“That’s my name. I’m surprised you remembered me.”  
“Well, you look like you haven’t changed at all. And I can’t forget our 10th-grade biology lab class. The one you pranked the teacher with by putting liquid ass on her apple? Pretty memorable experience,” I almost chuckled as I started to pump my gas.   
“Yeah, I was quite the class clown. I take it you’re headed to Brian’s reunion?”  
“Of course. I seriously hope we all come back. I kinda missed our little town, you know?”   
There was a click as the gas finished pumping. I pulled the nozzle out of the Jeep and put it back into the pump.   
“Wait… Are you and him still?” Ben’s voice trailed as he looked away from me.   
“Together? No, actually, I haven’t spoken to him since college.” I looked down.   
“Oh… Well, I’m sorry I brought it up then,” he talked like he was almost embarrassed.   
“Don’t worry about it; it’s been ten years since we dated. I have definitely moved on by now. But hey, I’m gonna get back on the road again since it’s already late. I’ll see you at the manor though!” I gave him one last friendly smile.  
“Yeah, of course. How’s the store clerk in there? A creepy incest cannibal?” He laughed a little.  
“Oh yeah, better watch out.” I rolled my eyes as I got back into my Jeep, started it all up, and continued my drive into Jackdaw’s Creek. In high school, Ben had been a good friend of mine. But he was a prankster and one of the biggest troublemakers in our class, so my parents never approved of it. He was a fun guy to hang around, though. Seeing him now, however, felt odd. It was almost like talking to a stranger. He hadn’t changed that dramatically in appearance, but there was a clear disconnect.   
*I wonder how much of a disconnect there will be between me and Brian?*   
I tried to push these thoughts out of her head.  
*We dated for years; surely there will be some sort of chemistry still left?*   
But I knew the reality. There was a reason, however: he had invited me up three days before the actual ball started.   
   
It wasn’t long until Jackdaw’s Creek came into view, after I turned the corner around a large hill. I was flooded with nostalgia. The town wasn’t tiny, but it wasn’t big either. The total population numbered around 18,000. It was like any other small town in America. Bricked buildings two to three stories high, hole-in-the-wall restaurants, tall, steepled churches. As much as I would have loved to stop and drive by all my old favorite places to hang out, I knew I didn’t have time. It was getting close to midnight, and I didn’t even know if Brian was still awake. Of course, I still had his phone number saved in my phone. But the last few times he tried to get in touch with me in college, I ignored him.  
*That was college. We were young and carefree. I’ve matured by now, I’m a different person.*  
Several times I had picked up my phone and almost dialed the number, but I stopped myself every single time.   
*Why hadn’t he called or texted me first? If he wanted me to come spend time with him before the others, why didn’t he give me a more personal approach? Probably because I ghosted him.*   
I shook my head, not wanting to be caught up in this anxiety. But as I got closer to Artemis Manor, I couldn’t help but feel it grow inside me. There was a memory I had, one of my last, at the sprawling estate. The mines around it and Jackdaw’s Creek were always known to be dangerous, and parents hated kids playing around the woods where they could fall into them. In fact, a few kids did sometimes go missing around the nearby counties. And the rumors always were that they got lost in the mines since most of them had been abandoned by now. But oftentimes, the police found nothing in them but spiders and bats.   
There was one instance that stuck with me for a long time, however. That’s because it happened on Artemis Manor. The estate used to carry a plentiful cow population. We would ride through the herds on the UTVs as fun. But one day, something was different. It was a foggy evening, one in late October before Halloween. On the way out to the pastures, Brian and I heard something strange—something we hadn’t heard before. It was a cow, but one that was crying out in pain, moaning loudly into the sky.  
 When we arrived at the pasture, we found a horrific site. This pasture had been on top of one of the older coal mines. And now, that mine had collapsed. Unfortunately, a cow had been standing on top of the area where it collapsed. It had fallen about twenty feet and shattered its legs on impact. We found it lying in a pool of blood on the dark ground, legs bent and twisted, bones sticking out. It was looking upwards to the hole it had fallen through, helplessly crying out. It was an image that was forever burned in my mind. Being a hunter, dead animals don’t bother me that much. But seeing that cow suffering and stuck in the dark hole, that was something else entirely. It was bad enough to make me burst into tears that day. I was only 14 at the time. Brain didn’t cry, but he certainly looked pretty upset. Right away, he called his dad, who drove out himself and put the cow out of its misery with his rifle.   
Brian’s dad wanted to keep the incident private, as he rightly figured it would cause panic about collapsing mines in the land around Jackdaw’s Creek. But I was so traumatized that I started crying again as soon as I returned home to my parents. Paranoia swept the town, and a lot of parents banned their kids from playing in the woods. Mine tried to, and I obeyed for a few weeks. But soon I couldn’t resist not seeing Brian anymore, so I returned back to hanging around Artemis Manor. There was never another mine collapse, never one that we heard of. There were theories about them collapsing whenever someone around the area had gone missing. But the police or detectives never found another collapsed one. Of course, the mines were so extensive around the county that they could have easily missed one. It was almost like a labyrinth that was miles wide.   
It didn’t take long for me to drive through Jackdaw’s Creek. Once again, I was back on the wooded highway, and soon arriving at Artemis Manor. It was off the right side of the highway. My brights glinted off the entrance that was just as grand as the thousands of acres that lay beyond it. There was a large golden gate, and two silver statues of Artemis, the Greek goddess of hunting, on top of it. They each had their bows out and pulled back. They were pointed to each other, creating an arch on top of the gate. It wasn’t the only state. They had designed the entire manor around Greek mythology. Something that I always thought was fascinating. On the right side of the gate was the little grey box with the keypad. I stopped and parked, grabbing the letter once more, remembering it contained the gate code.  
   
*Dear Eliza Bethany Wilkins:*   
   
 *I don’t even know where to begin. It’s been 9 years since we last saw each other. I’ve heard you work for a law firm now. I’m impressed. I’ve heard a lot of things about the people from our high school—a lot of things that have been making me want to catch up with everyone. I’m in charge of Olympian Ore now. I would be lying if I told you it’s been easy running the family company. It’s been a lot of stress, a lot. That combined with my desire to see my old friends again, led me to come up with the idea of a New Year’s Eve reunion. I want to throw a masquerade ball, just like my parents used to do. But I need help setting up. My letter to you, Eliza, is more personal than the others. I’m inviting you up a few days earlier than the night of the ball, so you could help me set up. I would also like to get some more personal time with you to catch up. If you don’t feel comfortable with that, then it’s ok. You don’t even have to show up to the ball if you don’t want to. But if you do, the gate code is 0931. I’m looking forward to seeing you.*   
   
*From,*  
*Brian Leonard.*   
   
   
The part that surprised me the most about the letter was what had happened to his parents. As soon as as I first read it, I almost googled it or called my own parents. But I held off. I would rather he tell me himself. Taking a deep breath, I reached out to the pad and typed in the numbers. I then stepped back as it slowly opened without a creak. Getting back into my Jeep, I clinched the steering wheel tightly as I drove forward. Memories came flooding back to me as I drove down the oak-lined road and the giant home came into sight. It was a large grey and wooden building, three stories tall. The manor itself was the shape of a W from top down, with two massive towers on the front corners, resembling something you would almost see in a castle. Despite the general Greek theme of the estate, the actual manor looked like it was almost French Gothic.  
But on top of the very front of the manor, the building sloped up into an almost triangle-like shape. There was a very large, circular glass window. It was something we named the “moon window” as kids. That’s because moonlight would shine through and illuminate the massive room below. In front of the house was a large circular driveway surrounding a fountain, which was currently turned off. On top of the fountain was a statue of Hermes. Dead leaves floated in the brown water. It looked like it hadn’t been cleaned since winter started. In fact, the whole manor gave off the vibe like it was almost completely empty. There were only two entire lights I saw on in windows, and three cars in the driveway. Back in high school, Brian drove a GMC truck. The three cars in front of me were a Tahoe, a BMW, and an older Ford pickup.   
*Is he even here? Don’t be silly; he probably has a newer car.*   
I parked next to the Tahoe. But before getting out, I pulled down the sunvisor mirror to check my lipstick and highlighter I had on.   
*Why do I care if my makeup looks good right now anyway?*   
I flipped the sun visor back up and got out, deciding to leave my bags and dress in the Jeep for now. Bringing my phone out, I considered texting him. But I decided just knocking would be a better approach, and instead texted my friend Tiffany.  
   
   
   
*I just arrived at the estate. It’s exactly like how I remembered it, just more drab. Made it safely through all those back roads. Just wanted to let you know!*   
   
Coyotes howled in the distance as I observed the manor for the first time in a decade. Against the night sky, it seemed like a relic of a bygone era. A monument of the great Leonard family and all their wealth and power. Stone gargoyles resembling Greek furies lay perched up on the roof of the manor, looking down. Leading up to the two big wooden doors, there were a set of marble steps. On each side, two large manticore statues lay like the Great Sphinx of Egypt. But now, it almost seemed the grandeur of the palace was fading away. I approached the door and slammed the bronze knob three times. A loud knock echoed through the night. I stepped back and waited, folding my arms and rubbing them to warm me up. After a couple of minutes, the door opened up slowly. The man in front of me, I hardly recognized. It was Brian, alright. But it looked like he had almost aged twenty years in ten. His hair was short but he now had a small beard. His forehead and cheeks were covered with wrinkles, and dark bags sat underneath his eyes. He smiled instantly at the sight of me.  
“Eliza, it’s so good to see you.” Brian stepped out to hug me. I returned it, but did not experience the emotions I thought I would. Instead, it felt almost like I was hugging a stranger.   
“Brian… You look nice…” I smiled back, complementing his simplistic but nice suit he was wearing. He looked down at it and nodded.  
“Yeah, still in my work clothes. You look nice, too. Here, come inside. It’s freezing out there.” He stepped back a little bit to make room for me to come inside. I threw my hand back, awkwardly pointing to my car.   
“Hang on, I gotta get my bags.”  
“Oh, Gerald can come grab them for you if you like.”  
Gerald was the name of their family butler.  
“No, that’s not necessary. I’ll just grab it all myself.”  
I walked back to the Jeep and pulled everything out. Two large green suitcases and a crimson dress in plastic I had hanging by the backseat window. Throwing the dress over my shoulder, I heard footsteps and turned around to see to see Brian rushing over.   
“Eliza, please, let me help you with all that.”  
“I’m good, I swear,” I replied as I started to roll the two suitcases back up to the steps. As soon as I reached the steps again, the suitcases hit with a hard bump. I started to lift them, and Brian bent down to pick up the back.   
“I see you haven’t lost your manners over the years,” I said as we made our way up.  
“Of course not. You know I was raised properly southern,” he replied as he went to the front door and opened it for me. I stepped inside to see Gerald approach.   
“Mrs. Bethany. I do apologize for not being able to open the door for you right away. I was in the kitchen helping clean up.”  
“Gerald! It’s so good to see you again. I’d give you a hug, but my hands are full,” I replied excitedly. Growing up, Gerald was always the nicest person working on the Artemis Estate. He was almost like another grandfather to me. I noticed Brian looking away.   
*Oh no. I sounded way more excited to see Gerald than I did him.*   
“Allow me to take those up to your room that we’ve prepared for you.”  
“I got it, guys, I swear.”  
As I said that, the dress started to fall off my shoulder. Brian lurched forward and grabbed it.  
“I got it, Gerald.”  
“As you wish.” Gerald nodded and walked away.   
“Here, I’ll show you your room,” Brian then said to me. Unlike most normal houses, the front door on Artemis Manor did not lead to a hallway or vestibule. Instead, it opened up to a great foyer right away. It was large and filled with elaborate furniture, with windows lining all sides once the room jutted out to the back. The ballroom went straight 40 feet to the ceiling. Above us, there were different balcony catwalks that crisscrossed below the ceiling, allowing you to walk between the left and right wings of the manor. This was the room they used for balls, and guests would often go up to the catwalks to look down. The back of the hall featured a large stage where bands would play. Next to it, a large grandfather clock ticked loudly. Brian led me to the left wing of the building. This side contained the majority of the bedrooms, including his own and the master bedroom, which sat the far side of the first floor. A little bit of anxiety rose up in me as we walked down the hallway.   
*Is he going to bring me to his room?*   
He took a right at the staircase in the hallway, and I breathed a sigh of relief. Almost all the guest bedrooms were on the second floor of the left wing, which he took me to. Once again, Brian helped me with my luggage as we went up the stairs. He took me to the third bedroom down the hall on the right. I wondered if there was any significance.   
“Here you go, Eliza,” he commented as he pushed it open. The bedroom itself, along with most other guest bedrooms in the manor, could easily pass as a master bedroom somewhere else. A king-sized bed sat in the middle of an oriental rug, which itself sat on oak. The walls were lined with outdoor paintings and several mounted ducks. Seeing them made me miss the duck hunting I used to do with Brian on the property. We both led the luggage to the bed and plopped it on top.  
“Thanks for the help.” I smiled at him. He nodded and looked around the room.  
“Hey, I wasn’t sure what time you’d come in, so I had Nancy cook up some extra food.”  
“Nancy’s still cooking for y’all?” I asked. She had been the family chef for as long as I could remember.   
“Of course, she loves this place. Tonight we had some spaghetti, Vienna sausages, and garlic bread. Nothing too crazy but it was a pretty damn good meal.”  
“I wasn’t sure if you’d actually have food for me, and I didn’t want to come in raiding your kitchen like that. I got some Popeyes a couple of hours ago.”  
Brian almost looked disappointed at my response.  
“But you know what? I’m still kinda hungry, and I feel gross after that fast food. Got any fruit?” I asked.   
“Of course.”  
I followed him back down to the kitchen, which was on the first floor of the right wing, next to a large dinning room. It was the first door next to the foyer. The kitchen itself was massive, shaped like an open U with marble counter-tops. Two steel fridges sat in the center, next to the sink. Both the fridges had screens on them. Along with the dual fridges were three ovens and stoves. This was of course, for meal preparation for the larger events Brian’s family often hosted.   
“Two televisions on the fridges along with that TV over there? Isn’t that a bit overkill?” I said, looking at the nearby wall.   
“Well, that was my mother’s choice to go with the fanciest new fridges,” Brian replied as he opened the fridge door and pulled out an apple. A twang of sadness hit me as I thought about his parents and how much he had to be going through. Both of his parents were always so nice to me. I took a bite out of the apple and set it on the counter.  
“Brian, I’m so sorry about what happened with your parents. I should have called and came to the funeral. I should have reached out.”  
“No, it’s ok. I should have invited you or let you know. It’s been tough, yeah. But I’m dealing, trying to carry on their legacy.”  
I reached out and gave him a soft hug.  
“Soon all your old friends will be here to help you,” I said before releasing the quick hug. Brain nodded and went back over to the fridge.   
“You still a fan of white wine?” he asked as he opened it again. My eyes widened a bit as I noticed him bring out a bottle of Louis Roeder. I know the exact price but I knew it was an expensive brand. And a lot of times I still drank the cheap stuff you would find at gas stations.   
“I am, but I really don’t want to drink tonight. I was hoping to get up early and maybe go hunting or hit the range,” I said as he sat the bottle on the countertop.   
“That’s fine, you don’t have to break in to this tonight.”  
“Look, Brian, I know you’re well off, but I don’t want to raid your expensive alcohol while I’m here like we used to do in high school. I’m an adult now. I can go buy my own if I need to.”  
“Eliza, this is your wine now. It’s a late Christmas gift for you.”  
I felt my cheeks turn red.  
“Brian! How much was this?”  
“Only a grand.”  
“Only? You shouldn’t have done that. I didn’t even get you anything. I’m so sorry.”  
“It’s fine, really. I just hope you like it.”  
“Thank you, I do.” I smiled, still feeling a mix of embarrassment and guilt.   
“Do y’all still have that wine cellar down by the garden?” I asked as I took a few more bites of the apple.   
“We do; do you want some other wine?”  
“No, I’m just curious. I do appreciate the bottle; I really do.”  
Brian leaned back against the counter as I picked the bottle up and examined it.   
*Maybe he really is trying to win me back over.*  
“Look, I want to go ahead and get this out of the way. I want you to know that this isn’t some weird thing. I didn’t invite you here to try to win you back or put on some show, buy you drinks, and stuff. I’m not stupid. Your signals were very clear back through college.”  
I was at a loss for words. I didn’t expect him to come out and be this dramatic on the first night. Part of me felt relieved, but part of me felt dissapointed. Seeing him and the estate had already triggered that deep sense of nostalgia in me. He continued to speak.  
“But you were still my best friend growing up through high school, and you knew the estate better than anyone else. I need your help for something.”  
“What’s that?”   
Brian walked over back to the fridge, and reached up to grab something. I leaned in closer to see that it was a grey folder. Curiosity welled up in me. He gently placed it down on the counter in front of you, yawning. I heard a meow and saw movement in the shadows behind his leg. A black tabby darted past him and jumped up on the counter next to the folder.   
“Your parents would have never let a cat up on the counter.” I stroked its pelt.  
“I don’t think I know this one, new cat?”  
“New cat, name’s Hecate. Look, I’d be lying to you if I said managing this estate on my own has been easy. Even with Gerald and the others, I’ve had a few problems. The last few weeks, there’s been two prominent ones. First isn’t so bad. A lot of stray dogs have been breeding with the local coyote population. When you get some of the more aggressive breeds like pits or rottweilers breeding, the result can be nasty. And they have an appetite for the deer, cow, and other animals on the estate.”   
He reached and pulled a few photos out o the folder, spreading them across the countertop. I looked down and grimaced at the sight of them. They were of deer, cats, and cows all mutilated and ripped open in different ways.  
Despite their grotesque nature, I still studied each one a little bit.  
“Yup, this really looks like a collection of animal attacks. I can see the bite marks in some of the photos. Why haven’t you hired someone to take care of them?”  
“They breed quickly, and they’re harder to find during the day. I wanted someone who knew the property well, someone who I knew was a good shot.”  
“Well, I was a good shot, I haven’t fired a gun in like seven years.”  
I thought back to when I had bought my pistol and taken it to the range. I was only 21 then, and still a junior in college. I hadn’t fired it once since then. Or any other gun.”  
Brian shrugged at what I told him, reaching out to pet Hecate.   
“It’s like riding a bike; you never really forget. We’ll head down to the range tomorrow morning.”  
“Sounds like a plan.”  
I yawned, feeling tired.   
“The coys, as I call them, aren’t the only problem I’ve been dealing with. People have been trying to fuck with the estate. I’ve been getting a lot of poachers and vandals, especially down by the old ironworks. Some of what’s happened to the wildlife, couldn’t have been done by an animal.”  
Brian reached back into the folder and came back out with three photos. I gasped at the sight of these, as they were even worse.  
“Oh my God…”  
The first one was the head of a 13-point buck. It had been severed, and was hanging from a random tree over a dirt road. Its blood-soaked mouth and tongue hung open like it was in a perpetual scream of terror. The second photo was in the old Ironworks factor by the property mines. It was a circle of twelve cats, all disemboweled and splayed out. The third, was a dead horse floating in one of the ponds. Its throat had been slit, but you could hardly tell through the blood-soaked water. I didn’t look at these photos as long as I did the other ones. I set them down quickly and rubbed my eyes.  
“That is sick. I’ve seen messed-up shit online, but never here at this estate. Who the hell would do something like that?”  
“Psychopaths, enemies of my father, meth-head poachers, or drunk teenagers who think it’s funny. I don’t know. I’ve set up game cameras, but they always break them or steal them.” He balled his hands tightly. I could tell he was frustrated, and I didn’t blame him. I would be also. But at the same time, this was not at all what I was expecting. The amount of laws that these people were breaking were quickly running through my head.  
“Surely you’ve gotten in touch with the police about this? These people are criminals now, Brian. Trespassing, vandalism, animal cruelty, and you could even get them on breaking and entering for going into the old ironworks if you have it locked up.”  
Hecate jumped down from the counter and ran off towards the dining room.   
“I have, and the sheriff has helped a little. But they can’t keep officers on my property 24/7. All the more reason I need your help.”  
Brian stared at me just a little bit too long, making me feel like I would be guilty if I refused.  
“Look, this is a lot more than I expected. I thought you were gonna get me to help set up with the ball or take me out on a date, not hunt down poachers. I need to think about this,” I said and stepped back from the countertop, reaching out for the apple. But it had already started to turn brown and rot.  
“I totally get that. Whatever you’re comfortable with.”  
I yawned once more, grabbed the apple, and walked over to the trash can, throwing it away.  
“I’m tired from the trip. Let me sleep on it. I’ll have my decision by tomorrow morning.” I looked back over my shoulder at him.   
“Of course. When do you want to wake up?”  
“Six?” I asked.  
“An hour later then I do on average, I like it.”  
   
Brian walked me up to my room, and I said goodnight. On the way up I looked for some of the old family dogs, thinking about them after seeing Hecate. A lot of them were old back when I was in high school, so I figured they probably weren’t around anymore. I decided I would ask Brian about it, but not now. The bathroom itself was nicer than any one I had ever lived with before, including my own apartment. After showering, I put on my pajamas and went to bed. I made sure to set an alarm for 6 A.M, and check Tiffany’s response from my earlier text message.   
   
*Glad you got home safe. You gotta send pictures of the estate, I bet it’s gorgeous. And pictures from the ball, of course. How was Brian? Does he have a dad bod now? Was he weird?*  
   
I pulled up the keyboard and replied to her, deciding to omit the details about the animals and poachers for now.   
   
*No, he was fine. But I only got to talk to him for a little bit. Tomorrow I’ll spend more time with him, and I’m a bit nervous really. Estate was pretty, I’ll take pictures for you tomorrow.*   
   
   
I replied to some other texts from a couple other friends and fell back onto the bed. I had a tight circle of friends, but I was always closest with Tiffany. She was my roommate all throughout law school. The bed was comfortable—far more comfortable than my own. It was like falling asleep in a pit of feathers. But despite that level of pleasure, I awoke a few hours later to a weird scratching sound.   
“Ughhh…”  
I groaned and rolled over on my bed, looking at the alarm clock.   
3:34 AM  
“Still got a few more hours of sleep.” I stretched, and the scratching noise came again. This caused me to lean up in bed and observe the dark room.   
That’s got to be the house, or the air conditioning, or something.   
The scratching noise came again, this time from my left. I turned my gaze to the wall, where a large armoire was stationed. It was where I had hung her dress and jackets up. There was a pause in the scratching, and I grabbed my phone from the bedside table, turning on the flashlight. As I got up from the bed, I reached down into my purse, which was also on the bedside table, and pulled out the taser.  
If something wants to jump at me and attack me, I am not letting it. I don’t care if it’s Brian trying to play games; I’ll tase him too.   
The scratching came once more.   
“Brian? Are you playing a prank on me?”  
Silence.  
“Hecate? Another cat?”   
Silence once again. I squeezed the taser tightly and yanked open the wardrobe. The bright beam of my flashlight rippled across my crimson dress. But I saw no person or cat. I reached out and brushed the dress aside, along with my other jackets. Besides a box at the bottom of the armoire, it was empty. I shut the door back slowly and turned around as more scratching noises filled the bedroom. This time, they were coming from above me. It was like something was either moving in the room, or the ceiling. Either way, it creeped me out. The taser remained on my bedside table, the door locked, and I didn’t sleep well, only managing to get a few hours.
