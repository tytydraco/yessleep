I used to be a real estate agent. I like architecture. I like houses. I like the concept of “home” and what it means to be at home.  I might sound like I’m selling something now, but it’s genuinely how I felt about my job. It was fun, I made a lot of money and regardless of what people think about real estate salespeople (yes I’ve heard it all), I did help out families and enrich a lot of lives.



My clientele were usually lower to mid income families. I’d help find them homes at great prices in decent neighbourhoods, close to all the things they want … school, groceries, access to transit.  I loved my job the most when my clients post on social media showing off how they decorated their new homes, pictures of their kids on their first day of their new schools. It is corny to say it, but this job really was about helping people. My favourite thing ever was when they simply thanked me. 



Part of my wheelhouse was selling the “unsellables”.  I sold one once earlier on in my career and I guess I did such a good job with it, I started getting more clients asking me to sell these types of properties.  I think you know what I mean when I mention “unsellable” - foreclosures, old, run down, ugly, shitty locations, grow-ops, even haunted.  Yes, that kind of haunted.



I’ll let you in on a little secret about haunted houses: A lot of people will walk into an old, worn down house and the first thing that happens is they don’t see much at all because the lights are gone and the windows are shuttered. When you’re suddenly covered in darkness, your brain  immediately goes into a primal, hyper awareness mode, that bit of instinct left over from our forest dwelling ape days. Your eyes dilate, trying to grab as much light as it could to make sense of things. And your subconscious starts trying to protect you by making you aware of the smallest probabilities of danger, even going so far as making it seem like random objects are predators in the dark.  



The second thing that hits your nerves is the air. And you may not know it right away, but you’re constantly breathing, and the air in that old house gets right into your lungs and starts interacting with your chemistry. You know how perfume can activate your senses in a way that will make the person wearing it more attractive to you?  Well, mold does the same thing except in the opposite way.  In old houses, there’s a lot of things that’s going on in the air.  There’s lead paint, there’s stagnant water, insects, decaying plants, rotting corpses of small animals and mold spores.  All stuff that’s not good for us, so when this particle rich air hits your olfactory senses, it activates that ancient instinct that tells you this place isn’t safe, there’s danger here,  you need to go.  



So when people say they think a house is haunted, it's because all of these things are hitting you at once, and combined with your imagination influenced by every horror movie you've ever watched,  your brain tells you, take caution. It’s not safe. So it starts prepping you for battle, pumping adrenaline, making your heart beat faster, making the hairs on the back of your neck straighten, pulling all the blood away from the surface of your skin so you won't bleed as much if you're torn open. 



From my experience, I've told myself that the secret of haunted houses is that the house is never haunted.  It’s always just mold.  



The truth is in today's market you can sell any property, even those with stigma attached to it. Nowadays I know it’s not hard selling them at a great price, but back in my day, when the market was a little more reasonable, you did have to do a bit more than just put a sign on the lawn.  I was a good salesperson, I went above and beyond.

   

I had a client who wanted to buy a house. I’ll call her Maria. She was a single, very Catholic, middle-aged mother, a housecleaner, with a teenage son.  She was the type of lady that always looked nice, always checking her makeup in the sun visor mirror, making sure she didn't have crumbs on her lipstick or a smudge of dirt on her fast-fashion clothes. She had saved for years for a down payment to get out of the high-rise that she and her son were living in. Too many people, she said. Too much crime. It was dirty all the time and run down. Building management didn't care. 



We went through a few homes before she found the one we were looking at.  It was a little one-storey bungalow close to the edge of town, but it was one she could afford.  She’d have to commute further away but she was fine with that. She usually took the bus, and it gave her time to read, she said.  All the euphemisms apply: cozy,  access to public transit, renovator’s dream, flipping potential, original architectural features intact.  All this to say it was a tiny, seventy year old, run down mess in a bad neighbourhood.  There was a wire fence around the property, a small patch of dirt for a front lawn. 



Now I was a good agent. I researched that property’s history because I do not feel right about selling a stigmatized house to this nice, religious mother.  The home was built in the 1940s, and had two owners. The house sold once and the last owners lived there until they died. The estate passed to their son, who now lived across the country and did nothing with it until recently.  According to the seller’s agent, the son did not get along with his parents and was essentially estranged from them. He didn’t even visit them when they passed away.  The wife died in 2008, and the husband died just a few years after, not in this house, but in a city run senior home that had since closed down.  

   

The house remained in their names, but no one was around to look after it. When it went on the market, it was cleaned up a bit, but basically sold “as is”.  So no funny business here. It wasn’t a murder house, not a grow op, no indication of it being haunted or anything like that. It was just old.  



It had all the tell tale signs of abandonment.  The front window frame looked broken and it seems like the windows had been replaced recently.  There were heavy drapes so you couldn’t look inside.  There were three padlocks on the front gate. The lock box was attached to the bottom of the gate and it contained all the keys I needed, three for the padlocks, one for the front door, and another one that had a tag on it.



I took note of it because this key looked old. It was a brass key, a bit discoloured with age. The paper tag had a written note in blue ink that said  “bsmt”.  I took it to mean that this was the basement key. 



I unlocked the front door. Right away, my client hesitated. She shook her head, and her eyes were big. She was a bit hesitant about going in, but I was a good real estate agent, I did my thing. I went in first and started opening all the doors wide. The lights were out, so I spread open the drapes. Someone has done this recently, probably cleaners for the estate, so there wasn’t a lot of dust. Once it was brighter and I was in the room, my client felt a little more reassured. There wasn’t much I could do about the smell though.  



The kitchen was clean. The cabinets were old, some looked like they were collapsing a bit. In its day, it would have been described as “cute”. The scrollwork in the cabinet doors looked hand carved, and it had been painted over with thick, custardy off-white paint. I could see no mouse droppings in the corners, thankfully.  Past the kitchen, towards the little dining room, I could see a short, unlit  hallway with a door at the end of it. The door was shut and there looked to be a lock on it.  I made a mental note that this was probably where the basement was. 



Down another hall were the bedrooms. The smaller room was unremarkable and basically furnished with a double bed and a chair. The master bedroom was occupied by a queen-sized bed covered in several different bedsheets and musty quilts. The previous owners’ things were still in the closet - a couple of old suits covered in plastic, some dresses from forty years ago.  There was a picture frame on the dresser holding an old photo of a middle-aged couple, standing stiffly in front of what looked like this house. The photo was blown out making their eyes and lips look like ink drawings.  



The house was the right size for Maria and her son. It was affordable, and she had contractor brothers that she could lean on to help her fix some of the issues in the house.  It shot right up the list for her, but she couldn't shake that feeling that something was off.  I didn’t push her, but I continued to do my sales schtick and painted a pretty future where she could see herself watching TV with her college-bound son in their renovated living room. 



Part of my due diligence is inspecting every part of the house. After all, I’ve been in a lot of houses like this before and it would be helpful if I could note all the red flags myself.  So, I checked the basement.



The basement key took a little bit to work. I had to push up on it and jiggle it a few times before it clicked and turned.  The stairs started right at the door. They creaked as I walked down it. I told Maria she could come with me, but she opted to wait upstairs until I checked first. She said she was afraid of rats. I told her I didn’t see any.



The smell that we noticed when we first came in was stronger now. It was an earthy, musty smell, and almost kind of sweet. I couldn’t really describe it. I want to say it was like cigar tobacco, mixed with a lot of dirt and grease.  There was a small hint of decay to it. It’s hard to describe but it made me feel uneasy, and it was stronger as I went further down, the stairs creaking with every step.  



That thing I told you about, about haunted houses. I was beginning to feel it. 



At the bottom of the stairs was the open basement. It was about 7 feet in height, and the only light came in from one window that was blocked by junk on the outside, it looked like. The entire basement was practically filled end to end with boxes of all sorts, a lifetime of stuff. Each of the boxes were packed tight with books, papers, folded clothes, and smaller boxes sealed with tape.  The ceiling exposed the floor joists and wiring but oddly there were no cobwebs. It didn’t seem there were any tell-tale water stains of flooding or seeping soil. It was dry as a bone, and dusty, and there was nothing that I could see that explained that odour. 



The walls were covered in faded old wood panels and shelving. On the shelves were the usual shit you'd find in basements, mostly tools and old tins of paint.  The things I wanted to check were there and as expected… an ancient furnace and an old fuse box.  As I opened the fuse box, the metal door squealed loudly. I heard a sound behind me, a kind of shifting and scurrying from behind the panels. Like a soft, erratic thumping.



I had a flashlight hanging off a keychain… the kind of swag you get a sales convention. I held it up and pointed it at the walls around the fuse box. I'm not sure why I did, I was pretty sure it was just mice but I didn't need to be jump scared by a bunch of vermin.  



I didn't see anything except more junk. The paneling was pretty skewed, but it was an old place, and it probably needed to be ripped down anyway. I looked around the junk in the furnace room. There were a bunch of toys piled up in a torn up armchair, covered in a thick layer of dust.  I felt like I should have brought a mask with me because looking closer I could see it was more than dust. That was definitely mold. 



I'm not an expert on mold but I know it when I see it, and maybe that mouldering pile of stuffing was where the smell was coming from. There was a teddy bear on top of the pile that looked so old it could have been made at a time where they literally used real fur, and it was coated with that black, sort of fuzzy substance. It covered the bear's ears and face and snaked down in weird tendril-like patterns, then onto the other toys below it.



I was thinking to myself just how on the nose it was to find creepy toys in the basement of a creepy house, when I heard Maria sneeze, and call me from the stairs. I was just about to tell her that she didn't have to come down.  I should have been more firm about telling her to go back upstairs.



The hairs on my neck pricked up and my heart began to beat fast. I broke out in cold sweat and for a moment, I wasn't even sure why.  Everything that happened next went by fast. Maria was tossed face forward from the third step in a weird, unnatural movement that made her look like a mannequin.  



She looked up at me from the floor, palms down as she tried to get up. She was as shocked as I was. Did she trip?  Did I miss a loose step? Am I about to get sued?  



I hurried to her but stopped when I saw … I don't know what, a thing like a shadow grow from nothing behind her. It had crept up from under the wood panel walls and from under the stairs  and risen up like smoke to cover the wall like a curtain. It had that distinct rotten, earthy smell of mold. I had the ridiculous instinct to try to shine a light on it from my tiny little flashlight but that thing just seemed to eat the light. It was just a wall of black.



It didn't make any sound. You'd expect it to roar, or growl, or whatever, but it was quiet and all it did was make the wood creak and Maria scream when she realized that its tendrils were wrapped around her legs.



I grabbed her, trying to lift her up, but she couldn't rise. She was crying and coughing and desperately clawing for me, reaching for my arms and pulling me down. Behind her the thing was a blanket twisting around her legs pulling her back under the stairs. 



I found myself choking on the thick powder in the air. I was getting dizzy and nauseous. I probably pissed myself in that moment. The thing was covering  Maria up to her waist now, and it looked like it was squeezing her. I could hear a gross slurping, and cracking of bones.  Her eyes were rolling back in her head and she was starting to convulse as it crawled over her body.   



When she stopped screaming, I began to scream. She was covered to her neck now in that undulating blanket of black. Her hand was locked to my arm, fingers curled  tight over my sleeve and it took all of my strength to pull off my jacket and get away.  I had scurried up the stairs ass-first backwards while watching the blanket of darkness creep over the lower steps. 



I shoved my way out of the basement, nearly breaking the door off its hinges. I shut it tight behind me, grabbed the fucking key, and ran out the front door.  Spores were still all over me and I desperately tried to brush it off, the memory burned in my mind of Maria's face with her eyes rolling backwards and her mouth vomiting black dust.



I was outside, in the daylight, on the front step staring out into an empty street and the other run down houses around me, all of them dark, empty.  I was crying, tears, snot, blubbering, I couldn't stop. I wanted to throw up.



Then I heard something that really turned my blood to ice. 



"Are you okay?"



Maria was standing beside me. She had reached out to me with a concerned look on her face and I recoiled.  She was clean, hair pinned up, makeup intact.  She didn't look at all like she had been screaming for her life in horror, convulsing pain while being consumed by whatever that was down there.  It was just kind, Catholic, single-mom Maria.



In two seconds I doubted everything that just happened in the last ten minutes. It was like when you wake up too soon from a nightmare and the emotions are still raw but you kind of can't remember why. 



She was asking me if I forgot my suit jacket inside. I didn't answer her. I didn't care about my jacket.  I  just awkwardly walked to my car and got in. 



Maria stood next to the passenger side door, arms to her sides and doing nothing else. She didn't say a word, she just stood there.  I looked over slowly, both my hands on the steering wheel, gripped tight and trying to slow my breathing.  There was a deep primal need within me to start the car, gun the engine and go. Leave Maria behind, fuck my fiduciary duties,  just go.  I was screaming on the inside, when I slowly pressed the button to unlock the doors.  



Maria moved slowly, methodically as she planted herself into the passenger seat and smoothed down her jeans. With her shoulders still facing forward stiffly, she turned her head to me. I can see black dust powdering the side of her forehead.  Maybe I imagined it, it was nearly imperceptible, but I'm sure I could see it seeping through her pores and crawling down her skin. She didn't brush it off, she didn't look in the visor mirror to adjust herself.  All she did was smile at me and I just stared back in horror.



I started the car and drove her home.  



The worst thing about the whole thing was when I pulled up in front of her apartment building. She was looking outside, wearing that simple smile. There were guys standing around, old women sitting on a bench nearby, other moms, like Maria, on their balconies, pinning up freshly washed clothing, and children in the basketball court, playing.



I remember what she said to me as she left my car. It's the reason why I'm no longer in real estate, the reason I'm sitting in my sterilized room, constantly spraying everything with chlorine bleach, screaming at every stain.



"You know what? I don't think I need to move. I have everything I need here."  Twenty-six storeys of a poorly maintained cement tower, filled with people.  I looked down and there was a film of black mold all over the passenger seat.  "Thank you for your help."
