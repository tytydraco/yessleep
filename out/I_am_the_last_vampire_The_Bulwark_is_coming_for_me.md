I will begin by saying, yes, I am a vampire. I don’t know if anyone will believe this; I surely don’t expect them to, though neither do I care. This really isn’t meant for you. This is meant for me. For me to know that my efforts have not gone to waste, in the name of mine and your kind. This will be my swan song. Though, after what I’ve seen, I’m quite content with that. I think one can only live for so long before their mind turns hollow, and knowing our species finally met our match, it seems this couldn’t have turned out any other way. Pitiful.

My name here will be the name I’ve used for the past 200 years of being a vampire, which is Constantine. I have absolutely no clue as to whether I was anything before this point, no memory. This kind of goes onto my next point, which I will soon go into more of, but that is my name. Identity is a fuzzy matter for us nightfolk; no matter how old, I’ve met no one who can describe to me memories further than a few thousand years. No childhood, no birth, no parenthood or familial bonds. Well, not all familial bonds. As a species, and as you could have guessed due to my prior terminology, we have a deep connection with the night, the dark, and the moon. I, nor anyone I’ve met, have any explanation for why this is our state of existence. Your people’s histories have overwritten any of mine, ours now only surviving through me.

You actually got the darkness part right, in your rarely correct examples of us. Though any really similar examples are few and far between. We started out as stories for your folk to scare your young into subservience, tales around the campfire to have a spook and a laugh. Nowadays, we are confined to media, where any fear of us is locked behind digital screens. None of you have any idea of how deep the blood runs, metaphorically and literally. How many of you have fallen for a deceit greater than what a god could pull off. I will alleviate this grand weight off all of our shoulders, at the cost of my once immortal life.

It is important to this post that you understand everything I can possibly tell you about our kind, our abilities, and our overall purpose and roles in this world preordained for us. Our kind are all of a piece, humanity and vampires entirely. This is the most ancient explanation I can possibly think of, especially since no one else bothered to think for the answers themselves. Either ignorant, blood-drunk or afraid. Perhaps all of them. Though for me, fear is a great motivator. It’s what motivated all of this. 

Where your kind dwells in the daylight, soaking up the sun’s favour and sleeping peacefully at night, our dwelling swells only in moonlight. The sun is not lethal to us, not immediately at least. Only for long periods of time does our porcelain begin to crack off, revealing nothing underneath. Yes, porcelain, like a basin. Our biology is nothing alike, the same for many of your urban legends, though this story is designated for only us. Again, we are hollow. The sun drives us to ash. We and you do look the same though, head to feet. It is part of the reason why identity for us is fuzzy. Finding another vampire within human society has only happened to me twice since memory, once each century.

Vampires are everywhere you don’t expect them to be. This is the ultimate deceit. Through these thousands of years of integration, censorship, lies and overall control of Earth’s hierarchy, we have made ourselves top dog. While I’ve only met two out in the wild, it’s not hard to tell, especially since we are all of a hivemind. I told you we were all of a piece. When we look into each other’s eyes, we share experiences, feelings, and memories. Other than our carapace-like skin, this will be the most unbelievable part of this post so far. It is not where it stops. But yes, we can find each other pretty easily. Looking through the glass of screens does help. Your governments, royalty, warmongers and company officials all are part of our ranks, all assuring your safety and best interests at mind. It’s pretty much all the humans that openly admit to the opposite.

I think when technology started advancing, that’s when our sightings and ghost stories began to diminish. With the camera came new rules, new operations to go by, and new fears of light. Our censorship and expungement began to become the central priority of our kind, greater than control over the human race, and thus is why those silly folklore tales died out, and fear of us did as well. It is how we’ve blended in, consumed amongst the crowd, the ghost in the room. But we are not that of man. The stuff of man is sticky, bloody, sickly and decrepit. A twisted beauty of flesh and gore.

We are not granted such reprieve.

Our flesh is not flesh; our gore is not gore. Hollow empty shells are what we are, devoid of natural concepts or biological matter. We fly with no wings, reflections do not recognise us, and we are repulsed by the sun’s resplendent light and nature’s love. We are Plutonian, we are irregular, and we exist in the black splots of shadow in the corners of your rooms. We remember nothing, owe nothing, and have everything. This is how we are, placid beings making sure our worlds and those of man don’t collide. When they do, it can only be for one thing. Probably the thing you’ve been expecting ever since I called our species “vampires”. It’s what we’re known for after all.

The yearning for deep red, oozing blood.

As all creatures feed, so do we. In your own tiny view of the world, it’s merely the blood we satiate ourselves with, nothing else. Sometimes you see vampires in media that actually feast upon humans, eating them whole and leaving only bone. Some are monsters, some are masters of seduction, and some are freaks with long nails and pointed ears. How terrible of a portrayal. Our consumption is not so easy, not so merciful, and not so universally simple to explain.

What I am about to say is going to be nonsensical, as much of this has been and will continue to be, though there is no logic or rhyme to this world as your mind would have you believe. Sometimes, a wall is a wall. Other times, the wall becomes a bridge, a door and a gateway, a segregation between worlds, all the while still being a wall. Your blood is like that.

Your blood is not just your blood; it is your history. Your energy, your emotions, your entire life wrapped up in a shower of crimson: when we feast, it is not just your consciousness we are taking; reality permits us to swallow your existence up entirely. You become nothing, quite literally. Entire memories of you disappear from other people’s minds, anything you were attached to becomes erased, and any trace of you in this abysmal existence is wiped clean off the slate. Your individuality becomes shredded in the teeth of our collective force, your flesh blending with your blood into a primordial slurry, all sucked and slurped into our hollow shells. We feel everything you feel, and the same from you to us. We feel as your mind breaks and absorbs into our mental tyranny, absorbing the knowledge and snapping, screaming out for help and knowing none will come. It is a primal thing, the fear of not just death but of total non-existence. And each of us, all vampire-kind, feels as one of us sucks up the life and experiences of a human. The lightborn join the dark, their blood becoming ours to play with and abuse.

It is the deepest form of defilement and connection, to become one with another so much more powerful. We are beings of concept, not of nature. You have no place within us, yet we force it anyway. For enough of your blood, and our strongest may become day walkers. Through gluttony, your existence provides our strongest with the ability to walk the day unscathed, unnoticed and in complete domination. It is where the theory that perhaps we were once men came from, shown both in your culture and my own, though our breaking of reality is what strains that hypothesis. We are too far apart, too far gone from anything mankind could dream of achieving. It is why we are what we are: opposites. Light and dark.

We cannot turn you into one of us, I’m afraid. Only erase everything you were and anything you’d ever be.

There is an old adage, one every vampire knows. I’ve known it as far as memory will take me:

“When the oceans run red, the sun will belong to us.“

I truly believed it would happen too. That one day, no matter our feelings on humans or our own affairs, we would eventually be graced with sunlight eternally, not just for the sake of hunting or pretending. The folly of it all.

Now, you may be wondering (if you’ve even made it this far, knowing how far this deviates from your perceived reality), if sunlight scorns us and the night blesses us, where do we go from dawn until dusk? Where do we go if we’re too weak to handle any light at all, if we’re desperate for the connection of blood and dark?

We live underground.

Under miles of caves and natural formations, our eternal cities lie in wait. It’s a world none of you have seen before, never will, and never should. It doesn’t make sense: there’s a skyline of stars cascading off the jagged rocks and edges of our home. Ancient architecture, born from nightfolk much older and more prehistoric than you could EVER imagine. So far back, in fact, it seems our collective memory fails to grasp the primeval nature of it all. Once again, our species breaks reality’s rules, and so twilight exists beyond the purview of the moon. With our flight, we can reach these places that would take humanity weeks in a matter of seconds. No documentation of us will remain, and no evidence of us will be noticed. There would be excuses and redactions aplenty, covering up and hiding our divine mausoleum.

I think that's everything about our history and nature I can currently gather and share. I’ve told you of our peak, of the years it took to get here, of our stone cities hidden deep within earth’s crust.

Here’s where it all falls apart.

So, once again, my memory goes back 200 years. 206 to be exact. I was “born” in Manchester in 1819. At the time of a great massacre. A peaceful protest turned wrong and turned into a bloody war between activists and the military they were trying to resist. Only 11 died, as far as I could recall. Mind you, I only found this out quite some time after the fact. But the blood. I remember the blood. The sweet blood was everywhere. On the walls, meandering amongst the mud, gliding over and shaping the plaza and fields in its deep crimson glaze. Like cherries pulped and juiced out into a great lake: sweet, enticing, reinvigorating.

My first ever memory is this: mindlessly, I went onto my hands and knees, careening my body forwards towards the lake of red. I opened up my cracked lips for the first time, first feeling the cold of Britain’s air dance along the inner corners of my jaws, and began sucking up the fruit this slaughter had harvested. The blood. The sweet, succulent, indulgent blood. I felt all the fear rush into me, all the rage and fight for survival they went through collapsing into my former state of non-existence like a tsunami fighting and destroying a small dam. The pure feeling and connection, the memories and the melancholy of it all.

Again, in documented history, only 11 people died here. But I remember more bodies. Countless bodies. Far further in the tens, perhaps even near a hundred. And yet, after my feast, only 11 people were remembered. It was so euphoric it just swept me up off my feet. And so I flew.

Obviously, I was seen. I probably became some sort of urban myth, a demon rising out of hell because of the great terror that was that day. A naked, porcelain doll flying with no wings, my entire torso smothered and dripping with the beautiful blood. But I knew where to go. My kind, my family, showed me. And so, for the next 50 years, I lived in the underground cities.

Everything I’ve told you, I learnt. I learnt of our power, of our confusing scarce origins, and of the universal ordainment that was our continued existence. I earned my name: Constantine. Foretold to me as being just how nightfolk truly are. Constant, resilient, never-ending. I had pride in that, I think.

I’ve always loved my kind. I am proud of what we have accomplished in our long-lived connected lifetime, despite the toil that comes to human lives because of it. It should have been us the aliens saw on that collection of memorabilia humanity shot into space. After all, whether they like it or not, humanity owes us for keeping them all together. Sane and rooted, even if they could never understand.

But there was no need for their torture. That’s the part I couldn’t understand or wrap my head around.

Deep beneath the crypts of our esteemed home, a secret lies. One that only bares itself once every century.

We keep you as slaves. Livestock. Hundreds, near a thousand, are kidnapped and hunted and forced to endure the cold of our caves, starving themselves out to hollow shells almost like us. Their wailing and cries haunted me somewhat. I knew that as a species, sacrifices had to be made, but it was downright cruelty. Our kind were indiscriminate: neither age nor gender played a part in the collection of human specimens. All chained together and chucked in a sweaty, bloody, organic mess. A pile of flesh.

It unsettled me mainly because sadness and fear weren’t the only things they felt down there. I could feel something else, thick and streaking throughout our cities. Perhaps everyone else could ignore it, but I couldn’t. It was palpable, conjurable, almost like you could play with it in the air. It reminds me, foremost, of the emotions and histories of the victims in my first experience on this world.

The absolute rage.

Wrath, hate, spite, whatever you call it. Always the memories and feelings we nightfolk block out as we slurp up your legacies, treating them like an uninteresting side dish to a gourmet meal. Hatred – the name of it just already summons up a bad taste in my mouth. It reeked of it down there, and even far enough away, it plagued my mind like a haze. Why was it only me who felt it?

Now, I am not compassionate enough to disregard feeding entirely. I do partake in it at least once per year. Our hunger doesn’t work the same way as yours after all; humans eat day in and day out, while we rarely crave blood most of the time. However, there will always be a point where we cannot ignore it or push the urge away much longer. In the years past, this led to hundreds of incidents, slaughters covered up due to our profane influence, though even then the sting would remain and embed itself in humanity’s culture. Remember, folk stories and campfire tales. Thus, our grand icons and leaders decided on an event to hide ourselves from the sun’s realm while also indulging our violent needs.

Thus, for 300 years, the gala has been held.

The rooms are absolutely gigantic. Bigger than anything any of you would have ever seen before: architecture and pillars reaching miles upon miles upon miles. Lit only by candlelight and lanterns, a space filled with the darkness for which we call home. You'd look up to see chandeliers hanging from the same faux twilight, stars glistening and breathing impossibly in the deep caverns of the underground. Paintings of our history, the same grand icons who formed this profound arena. It was a night to dance. It was a night to embrace our true natures. It was a night that was eternal.

It was a night to drink their blood and watch as their lives swirled down the drain.

I hadn’t been to the gala before this century. The overwhelming pulverising scent of unbridled anger always held its mark on me, made me believe I had guilt and shame over what my kind were doing, and acted like it didn't completely terrify me. How could I be terrified, being part of a superior species? I chalked it up to me having respect for humans and spent the time of the gala above ground. I travelled around my home country of England lots. I’d revisit Manchester, skulking through the nights. But this time, I decided I couldn’t help myself but to see. The grand scale and nature of it all intrigued me, especially the pride. A great feeding of our egos and bellies, if you could even relate our processes to yours.

I had never seen so many of my kind huddled in one place. We are regularly solitary creatures, connected through mind alone, yet here it seemed our loneliness faded away into seas of dances and laughter, love and a sense of home. Thousands upon thousands of vampires, all filling this grand hall in joy and glee. All looking their best, gentlemen and ladies, almost as if recalling a simpler time of control compared to the abominable human growth in today’s culture. Simplicity over clutter. Perhaps all of us have a penchant for the classic.

I put aside the feeling inside of me, the stench of wrath, and danced along the valleys upon valleys of people. All dancing to an orchestra raised in the air, the music itself layered with thousands of brass and strings harmonising and creating melodies your kind could only dream of creating, played with such finesse, speed and power that your body couldn’t help but fly. And so we did, all of us like bats spinning around streetlights. Endless twirling and flying and laughing and music – as addictive as it is maddening. In that room, looking into hundreds of eyes, we all felt the same thing. Excitement, contentment, glory. All of us are here for this dance. This night. This feast.

And then, as if perfectly on cue, the prey of the night reared their terrified faces.

Raised up on a stone podium, both the dancers and the orchestra came to a halt, silence permeating our kind as our ears perked and listened out. Whimpers and cries growing louder and louder by the second, the sound of the platform ascending and grating against the walls of the lift. The air shifting and changing, trails of the scent of sorrow all converging at set points around the arena. The endless rumbling and groaning entice us all, our bodies huffing in the stench of sweaty flesh clanged together with rusted iron. We could hear the chains get louder, their groaning more frantic, all this time spent waiting and waiting and waiting and waiting – until silence came after a loud crash. The lift could not raise itself any further.

Nothing. You could hear nothing throughout the arena, save for the grunts and moans spread out around, the slight clanking of chains ringing out and babies crying. And yet, for us it was total silence. All of us, quiet and teeming with excitement, consumed by shadows as the humans were illuminated by the candles. I imagine it must have been horrifying. From a dark, dirty pit to a beautiful hall overcome by darkness. Their and our emotions became palpable: motherly protection, confusion and panic, and overwhelming terror. And hunger. Everyone in this arena was starving. You wouldn’t think hunger was an emotion, and technically it’s not, but I assure you, the things it makes you feel are noticeable, detrimental and manipulative. Everyone here felt it. Us perhaps stronger.

A little girl stepped out from one of the dogpiles of bodies, the one closest to me, slowly walking forth into the abyss. Her parents cried out for her to come back, their voices croaking like it was their last words, but she didn’t listen. She kept walking forward, never wavering, curiosity stemming from her like a crop for the harvest.

She whispered, in the same tired breath as her parents:

“I see eyes, Mummy. Do you see them too-"

Her life came to an end within a mere second. A vampire launched at her, his endless teeth circling and stabbing into her neck quick enough and with enough force to completely decapitate the girl. Then, her body and all the blood that leaked floated upwards towards him, beginning to shred itself into a red slosh of brain matter, organs, eyes, fingernailsand even pieces of her hair. Reality itself distorted, ripping and tearing apart as her existence as a whole was removed and severed, grey spots of the universe opening and growing like mini black holes. The sound was intoxicating. Boundless white noise with the slurping of the crimson blend of concepts and gore.

And at that moment, everyone else wanted a taste.

The screaming. It was cacophonous, their terrified shrieks bouncing off the walls as our flying grey figures flung at them like catapults, using claws and teeth to open our prey up and let the juices flow. And they did, blood staining the arena and splattering like fountains of a beautiful red, thick and sticky and staining the humans trying to run away. Most of them tripped on their chains, unable to break away from the corpses in their weak, starved state. No one could get away; no one could escape. They were forced to watch as whatever friends and families they had were ripped from space and time itself, memories in their heads shrouding and hollowing out the corners of their brains. What should have been there wasn’t, what they remembered had been torn out of them, and their empty brains cried out with screams for help, for their god, for Christ to take them away from this awful pit of lies and despair and death.

Christ couldn’t save them. Christ was dead. So the feast continued, the blood circling the drains of our mouths like tornadoes. Endless, bountiful, eternal, sweet and sticky blood.

And yet, no matter how appetising the meal may have been, with all my brethren on their hands and knees consuming the lifeblood of hundreds of humans,

I couldn’t move. I was paralysed. Terrified, just as the humans were.

I could smell it again. Stronger now than ever, deeper than a trench in the ocean, like a blanket of plastic around my body enveloping me and restricting my movement and breath.

Rage. Wrath. Hate. Indignance. Vengeance.

My eyes darted around the room, feeling a source of the putrid stench pulse and manifest ever larger and ever stronger. They focused and narrowed on one of the great piles, reduced now to a mere chunk of meat on the ground. Leftovers from where other vampires flew to other piles, seeking out the more enticing lives to claim, either the elderly for their vast experiences to erase or the children for the disdain and disrespect of what mankind favours. Something bubbled and formed in this leftover meat, a darkness taking shape within it. It began to malform, taking root in the physical world, the meat seeming to almost duplicate and expand itself into muscle groups and legs and arms, massive limbs and a torso and wings –

How did no one else notice? Were they so invested in the feast that they ignored one of their brethren’s pleas? I was still paralysed in the shock and terror of this thing, this blackness of hearts and gore reeking of mankind’s rage seeping into reality’s visage. It shouldn’t have been real, shouldn’t have been corporeal, a concept that didn’t make sense; man’s way of life and nature had no place in our world, and yet it was here, a monster taking the shape of their torture and demanding to be avenged.

Looking back, this is where I thought I nailed the theory of where we came from. We are separate from nature, the regular way of physics and the universe’s rules. Thus, we must be summoned. Conjured forth by great events that pushed the resolve of all the creatures therein. For us, I think it was blood. Every one of us, no matter the age, has their deepest and first memory of them being them seeing and consuming a grand pool of blood, spilt by tragedies and pillages and slaughters. The blood called us forth, demanded harvest, the pure emotional toil of it all spelling out the way for us to walk the Earth in gleaming moonlight.

“When the oceans run red, the sun will belong to us.”

And when the earth is stained by ash, the night will belong to them. The lightborn. Humanity.

Whatever this thing was, it was born the same way as us. Though instead of being called by blood, it was called by man’s retribution. It was fully formed now; the great carrion lord made of dead meat stitched together was pounding its false fists on the ground and releasing a scream so guttural, so human, so primordially unbound that it shook reality itself. Everyone in the room’s attention was diverted from their meals to the giant in the arena. At the head, the meat had formed into the mask of a raven, its majestic beak stretching on and on, the mouth propped open from a cage of bones in its throat, steaming with some black and red gas that seemed to play with and manipulate the air around us. Its hulking body owned a pair of wings, its feathers made by more teeth and bone sticking out in thin shards, holes littering the body of stitched corpses and leaking out the same black and red smoke. The smoke went up our noses, a wrenching horror overtaking us as all that we abhorred in the taste of humans was brought back tenfold and conjured into our heads, wrapping around everyone’s throats like tendrils of fear. This raven, this lord of mankind, this bulwark of meat and natural bio-organics had all of us exactly where it wanted us.

That’s what it is, what I’ve named it. The Bulwark. A beastly wall of man.

I blinked, and in that half a second the Bulwark sped right past me, creating ripples in the air and sending winds to me that almost knocked me over. Then back again. Again and again, speeding around the arena, releasing amalgamated groans of every human it inhabited, man, woman and child. It took a while for the vampires still standing to realise what it was doing. Each of us looked into our hivemind, barely able to understand what was happening, only to feel the lights inside us slowly go out. One after the other, a vampire’s existence had ended. And we felt every single part of it. Every swipe of claws, every mauling, every slash and bite and dismembering and the pain as each of us began to scream and flail our arms and false wings around in fear, each of us taking flight and heading for any exit we could find.

I could feel it growing closer, the Bulwark charging at every vampire at what looked to be lightspeed, the behemoth that should’ve weighed thousands of pounds flying at the speed of missiles. I could hear it behind me and feel it as more and more lights went out in our connected headspace, still only filled with confusion and terror as our survivors raced forward through the seemingly infinite caves. It didn’t matter to the Bulwark; it had ample time to find and rip apart every vampire in its sight, seemingly drawn to our very presence as it belted out roars and screams that cracked the earth above and beneath us apart, our grand cities now beginning to fall apart and giving way to the earth and land above.

There were thousands of vampires. Then hundreds. Then in the tens, all in a span of 5 minutes. All from this one beast, all from mankind. An entire hierarchy voided out from the inside, my entire species forgotten in a storm we brought upon ourselves. If even one other vampire dared to look at me and tried to understand that what we were doing would backfire, maybe this catastrophe could have ended before it started. Maybe if the gala wasn’t created at all, if vampires were documented by mankind, this wouldn’t have happened. Instead, we made a monster that I don’t think anyone can stop.

I kept flying throughout the abyss, crying with no tears escaping my porcelain form. I could still feel it slaughtering the rest, but slower now, like it was running out of food to play with. I could see the perspectives of the dead nightfolk: bodies cracked and turned to dust upon the once beautiful blood-stained floors. Like ash smeared everywhere. I kept flying forward, gaining as much velocity as I could, abiding by the physics of reality humanity couldn’t live with itself if broken. I felt restrained and heartbroken, not just by the death of my species due to a cause I could feel from the start, but also because our nature, or unnaturalness, was crushed. Defeated, driven to extinction by what used to be our prey.

I flew, and I flew, and I flew. Until I watched the last of my kind go out, head crushed into dust under the Bulwark’s great claws. The last memory I have of it is it belting yet another guttural shrill, roaring to the world in satisfaction with the vengeance it had brought forth for all of humanity. Their own protector screaming with the voices of thousands, a hound howling at the sky.

I have fled the country. I have fled the underground itself, not even thinking about going back in there. Wherever it is, it knows I am the last. It knows what I’m doing right now; with each word I type, I feel it in my empty shell. I will not embrace the darkness from which I was born; instead, I will live in the light. I will grow weaker every day with sunlight until the last thing I see is that massive star driving me to ash, for I fear what will happen if it finds me. If it’s anything like us, as soon as I’m gone, every vampire’s history will be erased, and there will be no remembrance left for our kind. It is why I’m writing to any of you, so my kind can be remembered. I cannot recount any of my brethren’s memories and experiences, only my own, which is all the information I’ve given to you. Yet, I remember their faces, I remember everyone who’s taught me and loved me, and I remember how they died. And I am alone with my own mind all the same. Maybe it’s what I deserve. What we deserve.

My name is Constantine. I have lived for 206 years. I am the last vampire, and the Bulwark is coming for me.
