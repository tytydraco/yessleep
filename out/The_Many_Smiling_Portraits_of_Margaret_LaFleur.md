You’d never guess *this* house, the house I was stepping into, with its homely charm and warm vibes, was the scene of such a brutal massacre.

I wasn’t the first officer on the scene. Or the second. Or the third. I was two weeks late for the party. The suspect (we’ll get to her soon) was still on the loose. The city was desperate. So they called me.

I’d long since retired, but every now and then, I got the call. I was a bloodhound, and my reputation preceded me. Most of the stories they tell about me are bullshit, or at least heavily embellished – but I was fucking good. That’s all that mattered.

The first thing that struck me when I stepped inside were the portraits. Hundreds of them. Hanging, stacked, leaning against every visible surface. Margaret LaFleur was a popular woman, and (allegedly) a brutal and sadistic killer. 

There were pictures with celebrities. Pictures with politicians. Pictures of Margaret taking pictures. But the vast majority were just her and her family: a JC Penney-catalog-handsome husband with a sheepish grin and broad shoulders, twin girls with perfect curls and permanently mid-smirk, and a teenage son who radiated cool and smiled like he had the world figured out.

Poor bastards.

Margaret was a fastidious woman, and her house reflected an obsessive compulsion to be perfectly perfect. Even after the police department had turned the place upside down, it still felt clean. Still felt organized. Like, no matter what you did, the house insisted on being... good.

But in the space between perfection and chaos, I saw opportunity. Clues aren’t just discovered, they’re felt. They’re intuition, desire, and context. A box is just a box – until it isn’t.

To find a killer, you have to think like one. Is that box just sitting there, or does its placement mean something deeper? Darker? Hidden? In this case, it was just a box. And I kicked it over in frustration. Maybe this would be harder than I thought.

In the back closet, tucked behind the porcelain-tiled laundry room, I found a clothing rack. It was small, portable, like the kind you’d use backstage at a theater or during a move. Hanging on it were maybe six outfits, all wildly different. A nurse’s scrubs. A tailored navy blazer and slacks. A hoodie and jeans, worn and faded. A cocktail dress. Even a supermarket uniform with a name tag attached: Diane.

A loud knock at the front door disturbed my train of thought. 

“Officer Grassley, are you in there?” a scratchy voice bellowed from outside.

I opened the front door and was greeted by a short officer sporting a disheveled, scraggly beard that fell below his neckline. His attire matched his face. His clothes were baggy and unkempt, and he reeked of stale menthol cigarettes. 

“Yes, and who are you? I wasn’t expecting company.” I replied curtly. Playing nice with others wasn’t my strong suit, and I’d been promised this would be a solo job.

“Sorry to barge in on you like this – I know it’s unexpected,” he took a step into the house, placing his brimmed hat firmly on his chest, “Detective Lieutenant Sam Ellison, Major Crimes. Got word there was a misfiled evidence pull from this scene,” Sam shook my hand limply, “thought I’d come down and take a quick look myself before it became a paperwork nightmare.”

“Still alot of fuck-ups in the department – eh? Glad to hear things haven’t changed. Just do me a favor and stay out of my way, no offense, of course.” I chuckled. 

“None taken,” he said with a half-smile, already glancing past me into the living room. “I’m not here to step on toes. Just hoping to grab what I need and be invisible. Then I’ll fuck right off.”

His gruffness belied soft features and round eyes that radiated a strange, disarming warmth. I could sense there was more to him than met the eye, like a mangy alley cat who just needs a good wash to become some sort of bourgeois pet.

Lieutenant Ellison pulled out a notepad and carefully studied the pages as I stepped around him and sauntered towards the stairs. The carpeting was stained with deep, red splotches that cascaded like a river towards the bottom landing. The first signs of what was to come.

“How the hell does one woman do all this?” Ellison muttered behind me, not really asking. “You know she didn’t do it in one go, right? No, she took her time. Killed them one by one. Quiet. Controlled. Like she was peeling an orange.” He flipped a page in his notepad, eyes still on the blood trail. “That’s not rage. That’s choreography.”

“There’s no artistry in murder,” I stated matter-of-factly, “But there is art. Precision, skill, technique – Margaret had that in spades…” Trailing off, I caught myself before going any further. There was a reason I’d retired so young.

“Whatever you call it, she butchered them, and she did it with a smile on her face – or so the rumor mill would have you believe,” Ellison shoved his notebook back into his pocket, “Me – I don’t buy that shit. She didn’t do it because wanted to, she did it because she had to.”

Puzzled, I cocked a weary eyebrow and shot him a *what-the-fuck* look. “Had to?” I repeated. “That’s a hell of a way to justify it.”

“That’s not what I’m saying. Some people break. Some people bend. She adapted.”

He nodded toward the living room, where the family portraits still stared back at us.

“You see those photos? Not a single one’s been taken down. She posed for them. Organized them. Catalogued her life like it was evidence. A meticulously curated timeline of her transformation.”

He shifted his weight, eyes scanning the room like he was reading a crime scene no one else could see.

“And look how she moved through the house. No signs of a struggle. She didn’t fight anyone – she hunted them down. She made them trust her. Even while planning to kill them.” He paused, voice lowering. “She became a predator, and a lion must kill to stay alive.”

I understood more than I was willing to let on, so I nodded silently in agreement. Ellison was a natural detective, and despite his oddness, he was starting to grow on me. 

“There’s just one problem with your theory,” I leaned against a blood-splattered wall, “Lions don’t pretend to be antelopes, because they don’t need to,” I paused for effect, “Margaret isn’t a lion, she’s a snake.”

I said it as a joke, but Ellison didn’t laugh. He looked past me. Brow furrowed, he fell into a chair.

“Stupid, stupid, stupid,” he smacked himself solidly in the forehead, “Sorry,” he huffed. “Just… been chasing this case too long. We had her. We *had* her, and she slipped through.” He let out a breath, “Your point just drove that home – again.” 

“Snakes are slippery creatures,” patting his shoulder, I flashed a shit-eating grin, “Good thing I brought gloves.”

“You’re a good guy, Grassley,” Ellison said, his voice relaxed and easy. “I never believed what they said about you, and I guess I was right not to.”

“I guess so,” biting my lower lip, I restrained myself from asking *what* they were saying. 

An awkward silence settled over the house. We looked past each other, unsure of what to say next. The many Margarets stared back from the walls, frozen in frames. They watched with quiet contempt, her past selves locked in on a bloody present that hadn’t finished unfolding.

“I shouldn’t have said that. I can see that now,” Ellison gathered his things. “I should probably get going anyway.”

“Probably,” I responded, my social battery quickly draining. 

“Listen, before I go, do you mind if I get a photo? You’re still a bit of a legend to a few of us down at the station. They’d really get a kick out of it.”

Yeah, sure,” I said, shifting awkwardly as Ellison pulled a battered phone from his coat pocket. “Just don’t post it anywhere – I’ve got enough ghosts.”

“Course not,” he said, raising the phone. “Just for morale.”

He took the first shot. I gave a polite half-smile, the kind you reserve for retirement parties and awkward handshakes.

*Click.*

The second time, he stepped back and adjusted the angle. His hand brushed my shoulder, almost too deliberately, before he repositioned himself just out of arm’s reach.

*Click.*

The third one, I barely noticed. He was looking down slightly, fiddling with something near his chin. Maybe adjusting his collar.

*Click.*

“Thanks,” he said, already pocketing the phone. “Gotta hit the bathroom real quick, then I’ll head out.

He disappeared down the hallway. I heard the door shut. A minute passed. Then another. I leaned against the wall, rubbing my eyes. The silence in the house was thick again, broken only by the faint hum of the HVAC and the distant creak of old pipes.

When he returned, he looked lighter somehow. More relaxed.

“Appreciate it,” he said, tipping his creased hat. “You might want to double-check the back room, felt like something was off in there. Just a hunch.”

“Will do,” I replied impatiently. I was getting the sense Ellison’s goodbye would last another hour if I didn’t intervene.

Politely as I could, I placed my hand on his back and guided him toward the door – but then I hesitated.

“Hey, didn’t you come here for some misfiled evidence?”

He waved it off, already halfway out. “Yeah, I couldn’t find it. I’ll come back for it if I need to.”

The door closed behind him with a soft click.

I stood there a beat longer, then wandered toward the hallway, catching a glimpse of something new on the wall near the kitchen.

Photos.

He’d printed three of them, tacked neatly beside the thermostat like family portraits.

The first one made me laugh. Me and Ellison, side by side, both looking like we were humoring each other.

The second was less amusing. A little too candid, too knowing. He wasn’t smiling in that one.

And the third…

My heart thudded.

In the third photo, he was pulling at his chin. Not adjusting a collar. Not scratching. He was peeling back the edge of the beard.

Not all the way. Just enough.

Enough to show smooth skin underneath. A jawline that didn’t belong to “Ellison.”

My hand shot to the walkie on my belt, but before I could key in, it crackled. A voice, soft and familiar, came through.

“It was really nice meeting you, Officer Grassley.” A pause. “Can’t wait to meet your family, too.”
