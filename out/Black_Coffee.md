   Possession can take many forms. Thanks to Hollywood Humans have a pretty good grasp on the basics. It primarily involves a person, animal or object. In many cases it’s easiest to possess whatever is near or the focal point of negativity. The abused and neglected child desperate and vulnerable, the home that has housed decades of family trauma and violence or the doll that is simply a witness to it all. For a Demon it’s far more than just a chance to torment and drag an unlucky soul back into the fires. It’s an opportunity. A chance to prove to all of Hell what you can do while also being able to escape it for as long as you can. The closest thing we have to a miracle.

  I’d introduce myself but my name is unpronounceable by man and I wouldn’t even know where to begin with spelling it. To be honest I haven’t heard it in so long I sometimes forget it. I am a lower ranking demon only permitted in the less actiony sides of Hell. I don’t get to see to the torture of the damned or anything fun. I mainly herd souls and preform the bidding of the higher ranks. Subject to abuse and carrying out tasks no one wants to do like making sure the rivers continue to flow and aren’t being too clogged up from all the bodies stacking up and thrashing desperately in the current. 

   Today Ive been tasked with breaking up large ice formations from relentless rains here in Beelzebub’s territory. One of the most horrifically uncomfortable lords to speak with but I stay on his good side by having an offering ready for every meet. He might not love what you have to offer but he’s not exactly picky either. I watch the damned roam aimlessly through the storm while I chip away at the ice. Eyes frozen shut with the fierce winds peeling back their frostbitten flesh exposing the blackening muscle and bone beneath. If the ice formations get too large the humans will use them to try and escape the elements. Pointless really. I chuckled to myself at their expense. I hacked away at the ice revealing long abandoned fingers, limbs and strips of faces past souls weren’t able to free from the structure’s cold grip. That was when I saw it. A glimmering thread appeared from nowhere just in-front of me.

   These threads are doorways so to speak. A bridge to something from the mortal plane that is essentially available for possession. Exceptionally rare especially in these parts and just within arms reach.. it was beautiful. “HEY”! I snapped my head around. “Don’t you fucking move, Imp”. I had stared for too long, I should’ve known higher ranking demons would be alerted and drawn to its location. I froze, my whole body clenched and vibrating violently with fear and excitement of what could be. If I were to disobey I can’t imagine the suffering I would endure. Once I was through though who could reach me?

   My head felt heavy at the thought but my eyes were forcing my focus on the thread. It’s right here! Right in front of me! The opportunity and escape I’ve yearned for, for centuries. I couldn’t ignore this moment, I had to take the chance and finally become everything I knew I could be. I inhaled sharply and quickly grasped the thread and with my last sight being the absolute rage of the demon rushing towards me everything went dark.

   I felt light as I regained my consciousness. Floating in a pool of blackness when I began to hear distant mumbling. It slowly grew louder, less muffled as I opened my eyes. It was bright and took a moment to focus. “What is.. Where am I?” I looked ahead at a man staring back at me with frustration in his eyes. “COME ON!” He gave a short but forceful shove into me. “Damn thing never works right.” He stormed off. “What the fuck was that about?” I asked myself. I took a moment to focus and learn what I had become a part of. As the full picture of my possession came into view my jaw dropped. “No…NO!…. NO NO NO, FUCK!” It wasn’t true, it couldn’t be! My heart raced with confusion, panic and sheer embarrassment as my situation became more and more clear to me…. It was a coffee machine… I have possessed a God damned coffee machine.

   After a few hours or so of trying to calm myself down I was able to look around and listen to people coming and going and have  drawn the full unfortunate picture of my situation. I am now a large coffee machine in the break room of some machine company. Bearings I think is what I heard they make here. “It’s fine, this is fine” I thought. “I’ll just bail! Return to Hell and explain myself.. They’ll probably all laugh!”But I knew this wouldn’t be the case. 

   To back out of a possession was considered dishonorable. Not that honor exists where I’m from but it was looked at as failure or cowardice. Should I return I’d be subject to tortures and humiliations far worse than what most humans receive. I was stuck here in the decision I’ve made. My thoughts were interrupted by another man staring at me blankly deciding on what type of coffee he wanted. He pressed A3 and a lukewarm black coffee was dispensed. He took a sip, let out a unsatisfied sigh and left. “Maybe… maybe there’s hope here” I thought. It’s not what I had envisioned but there is opportunity here. I just needed to think. “These people… drink from me. I can dictate what they ingest.. I can have a direct effect on them internally!.. Not sure where it could go from there but it’s something”. With this clarity I’ve decided to stick it out and have gained a new excitement for what could be. 

  The first work break of the day has started. A few people sitting around at the lunch tables rambling about their pathetic lives and what a shithole place they think this is. Finally my first target has approached me. An older fat woman breathing heavily and biting her disgusting nails as she looked over her options. “We really need more options in this ol thang”. She chose E4, a cappuccino. Admittedly I was caught off guard a little. I was so taken back by this putrid ogre I hadn’t even thought of a plan for the drink. Quickly I allowed many small and sharp, hair sized, shards of plastic to peel from the dispenser into her coffee. In time my strength will grow but for now it’s the best I can muster. I was so excited watching her I didn’t realize I was holding my breath as she walked back to her table. She took a few sips each one followed by a low grunt clearing her throat. The grunts grew louder and were eventually followed by coughs that became too rough for her to ignore. At this point the whole break room had taken notice. “Excu- *cough* excuse me” she said standing up quickening her pace to the restroom. She placed a hand on the door and coughed a wonderful red and brown mist all down the face of it. 

   A few jumped out of their seats while most seemed stunned or unable to register what had happened. Her knees buckled, she gripped her stomach and let out a gasp that sounded as if her lungs were filled with rust and spit. Her forehead hit the floor while she unleashed a painful broken up shriek like a toddler. Two men grabbed her up and ran her out the door frantically with trickles of muddy crimson behind them. Just like that the room had gone from chaos to silence with nothing but the confused and terrified faces of her coworkers. Sweet ecstasy in my veins.

   By lunch time I’ve found out the ogre woman had been rushed to the hospital. No word on her condition but I hope for the worst. Some are still worried but things went back to normal here pretty quickly. The janitor had cleaned the mess and it became just a story. Gossip for these oblivious apes. It was when I heard someone mention it could’ve been the cappuccino that I decided to change up my strategy. I want to stick around here and perhaps the best way to do that is to make people actually enjoy their coffees. That’ll ensure my progress. Unfortunately word about the cappuccino got to higher ups and the next day an inspector had come to check the machine. I made sure to have the inside spotless as if brand spanking new. So much so that the inspector looked puzzled as to why he’d even been called. Supervisors gave the ok and the workers were back to ordering their drinks again. Lucky for them I knew exactly how to keep them coming back.

   Three days have passed since inspection and business has been booming. So many delighted faces ordering, pressing their gnarled oily fingers against the console grinning ear to ear. Some coming back three to four times a day even. It’s all thanks to an extra little ingredient. Enough time has passed for me to have grown a bit stronger and allow me to reach into Hell for resources to help aid me. Nothing major but I’ve found that I can acquire liquids. In this case, the blood of aborted fetuses and infants fresh from Moloch’s mountain. 

   A breathtaking sight to behold, I’ll show it to your goofy mustached ass when you get down here after reading. The babies plummet into Hell slamming down onto each other and the hot jagged rocks blistering their skin as the blood is continuously pulled from them down the mountain feeding into Moloch’s moats. I had always been attracted to their pain the most. Older children and adults are able to relate their pain. Should they be impaled on hot iron they’re aware of what is happening. They understand the source and feeling of their torture. Infants however are unique in their suffering. 

   They can’t process or avoid the pain let alone form a single intelligent thought as to what is happening and why. It is the purest form of anguish there is. The blood of a tortured infant also has rejuvenating effects. Makes you feel and look younger and just happier in general. Humans with power and influence love to partake in its effects but are unaware of how rapidly it rots the already condemned soul. They’re basically stomping on the gas pedal to eternal damnation just to feel a bit more energetic. Even better it’s far more addicting than any drug and the withdrawals are immediate. Ever seen an extremely attractive celebrity look shockingly old and worn out seemingly overnight? Well now you know. 

  “Hey hurry the hell up, Tom” Joe yelled from the back of the line. “I’m goin I’m goin just give me a second! Now do I want the espresso.. or cappuccino.. orrr..” Tom mumbled. Joe is one of my favorites here. Ex military, extremely short tempered and paranoid. Blames it on his years of service even though he never stepped foot into a combat zone. He spends most of his day sucking on his tongue looking for what other people are doing wrong. And Tom! Sweet simple Tom. A knuckle dragging slob whose mind moves slower than his feet. A big softy. Susan steps in: “knock it off you two it’s not goin nowhere”. The company’s token sweet old lady who can’t help but make the occasional racist remark here and there. The janitor is an interesting one too. Deeply religious and lately I’ve seen him nervously fiddle with the small crucifix around his neck whenever he enters the room. God had gifted man with a sense for danger that they  like to call gut feelings. Such a simple and powerful thing yet the majority of them simply ignore it and go on to ruin their lives or others’. 

   With every cup they consume I can feel myself connecting with them more and more. Not enough to take full control but enough to follow and observe them within the building. Joe however I’ve easily built an influence on. His depression and anger practically served as a damn welcome mat. I like to make him uncomfortably warm and forget where he would place things now and then. Small things that build up in an attempt to spark some violence. Nothing yet but he’ll snap, he just needs more time. Now that I’ve essentially created a building of addicts it’s time to shake things up. I’ve brought the temperature of the coffees down to just barely passable as warm and have completely replaced the infant blood with swamp water from Aeshma’s circle. 

   Filled with the blood, sweat, bile and waste from hateful souls condemned to endlessly beat each other to the death they wish would come but never arrives. Obviously I’ve tweaked the flavor to make it more tasteful but it should help to liven things up around here. The first to partake in this new blend is Frankie. A new father of twins and without paid paternity leave is forced to work all day while facing sleepless nights at home. A perfect cocktail of frustration and exhaustion. “Ughh what the fuck dude” he dumped his cup and hit to refill hoping it was just a bad batch but was pissed and saddened to taste the same result. “Damnit man, I was really looking forward to this.”

   Disappointment all around this morning. 
Tempers are beginning to flare as some curse the company and supervisors names. Around the building you could see how sluggish and upset everyone was. I decided to spend time with Sasha, a somewhat new hire. She’d always stop by to order hot tea or the decaf options. Who the hell gets a decaf coffee by the way?.. Anyways.. 
She was still training on these machines, Bihlers they’re called. Massive machines meant to cut and shape metals of various thicknesses. She’s got the hang of it but today is special. She is tired, agitated and unfocused making simple mistakes. 

   The machine is running, pulling a long strip of steel into it at a quick rate. I’ve had her overthinking this job and just as she was about to step back I forced her head in the direction of a small piece of tape on the line traveling towards the Bihler. I leaned forward into her ear and softly whispered: “If you don’t remove the tape in time it will ruin this job and the tooling in the machine”. She lunged forward without a thought gripping the tape but before she could rip it off the speed and pull of the line yanked her arm into the machine’s flattener. 

   Seven large metal wheels gripped her finger tips crushing and splintering the bones as her arm was passed from one to another. Skin flattening, ballooning and popping open to release blasts of blood and muscle as the bone ripped its way through any available openings it could find. Her screams filled every nook and corner of the building until she was elbow deep into the hungry machine. Instead of feeding in straight now the mashed mess of what was once her arm is being fed downward forcing her further in until her upper torso was forced sideways through the small opening in the side. Her raspy wails were silenced in an instant as her neck was snapped and her face imbedded into the opposite shoulder. The lead operator had finally reached the emergency stop button but it was far too late. It took only seconds. 

   It’s been sometime since anyone’s been called back into work. Past few days have been only police, managers and clean up crews trying to piece together what had happened. On camera it’s clearly a horrific case of operator error but it’s also been discovered that the machines error sensors had been turned off at some unknown point in time. Had they still been on she would’ve only lost a hand or some fingers. Management keeps pointing out her actions clearly more concerned about the potential lawsuit than saddened by the young woman’s death. Seems the case will be getting wrapped up soon. It’s been far too quiet and boring here. My mind wanders thinking of the workers. What they’re doing and what I could plan for them upon their return. 

   I thought of Frankie probably relieved to have time at home. A bummer really. He was getting to such a low point, so vulnerable. My mouth salivated at how close I was to taking him next but now who knows. I started hearing muffled voices. I had started to wish the police would move on elsewhere but.. it wasn’t their voices. When I opened my eyes I was stunned to see that I was standing over Frankie in his own home! He was rocking one crying child while the wife fed another. Before I had a chance to take it all in I was back in the coffee machine. Back in that silent cold colorless room. I began laughing. A quiet chuckle that quickly grew into hysterical euphoria. My body shook with the excitement with the realization of how far I’ve come in my work. Though he’s had time at home Frankie has yet to gain any real rest and I had completely forgotten the withdrawals he must be feeling on top of everything else. The bridge isn’t strong enough yet but I’m so close. I clinched my fist tightly and began to drool “you’re mine.. all of you”.

   It’s been nine days since Sasha’s death and everyone has returned to work. Many upset saying it’s far too soon and distasteful considering what happened but when a major companies losing millions sooner or later they’re going to crack that whip. Seems the Janitor quit too! Suppose he listened to that gut of his. It’s a shame though, I really wanted him. There’s a beautiful smell in the air this morning. Everyone scowling, pissed as hell, ready to go into a rage from the swamp water and extreme fatigue from blood withdrawal. I’ve changed nothing with the swamp mix other than serving some cold and others scalding hot. The smallest inconveniences can drive many to their breaking point. 

   Two fist fights have already happened in the parking lot and one worker, Ray, has been in a screaming match with HR and a supervisor. I’ll have to check in on that later. Frankie is walking this way and I see a golden opportunity with having just poured Susan a boiling hot green tea. As the two begin walking towards each other down the hall I blocked her from his view and quickly lifted his hand outward. In one swift motion Frankie not only palmed Susan’s entire right breast but also delivered a hard shove forcing her into the wall. Susan yelled as she tried to catch herself: “what the hell are you doing pervert”? Frankie was almost too surprised to speak. “Nn.. what? where did you come from? I- I didn’t mean- “
Susan interrupted “you just assaulted me you damn pig” she delivered a weak but quick slap to his left cheek. Frankie snapped back “fuck you, you old goat, no one would ever want to touch your disgusting raisin ass body”! Susan then threw her tea into Frankie’s face and marched away as he dropped to one knee burying his face into his shirt screaming. Frankie had to be driven to the hospital while Susan was fired shortly after. 

   After a long drawn out argument with the supervisors Susan stormed out of the building and climbed into her car unaware that I was tagging along. She sped down the interstate ranting to herself “stupid arrogant assholes.. thirty eight fucking years I gave that company!! They wouldn’t be anything without me those damned fools”! With a hard blink she was no longer in her car. Susan was now standing in a void. Blackness and silence in every direction other than her own echoed breathing. She stepped forward, surprised at the small splash from her foot. The shallow liquid under her feet was as black as the space around her. 

   In a low heavy sigh I breathed her name aloud. “Susan..” She spun around releasing a mix between a gasp and shriek. “Wha… who’s there?.. Where am I”? 
“Its alright Susan, everything’s going to be ok…. You’re home now”. Hundreds of tar soaked pruning arms tore out of the abyss beneath her grabbing onto her with the intensity of someone drowning, desperately trying to lift themselves over whatever they could for a single breath. Her screams and struggles were pointless as the overwhelming hoard of arms pulled her down slowly. Shoulder deep at this point with every inch of her covered by hands digging their cracked nails into her flesh, hair and clothing. She managed to look up and gazed into my eyes staring back down at her. I placed a finger on her forehead and delivered a gentle push down. Tears streamed down her face and her muffled whimpers were silenced as she sank below the surface. Susan gasped awake back behind the wheel of her car on the interstate and collided with an oncoming sixteen wheeler at ninety three miles an hour. There was nothing left.

   Back at work not much has changed. We’re early into the next morning and things are slow. A police officer, a detective, a company supervisor and some fancy suit are all speaking at one of the tables. “I can assure you gentleman nothing is out of the ordinary here. We’re running as smoothly as ever! All of theeeeese… incidents are just unfortunate luck”. 
The detective spoke: “incidents? Mr Fuller two of your employees have died. Another two are in the hospital, three are missing and the rest are frighteningly angry! All within a month! Now maybe this IS all just a hell of a bad luck streak or something very serious is going on here”.
The officer looked over: “Y’all do work with a lot of hazardous chemicals here. Maybe it’s having a violent effect on the workers”? 

   The fancy suit stood up with a sigh and made his way over to the coffee machine. I smirked. Here’s another tally mark for the scoreboard. The detective called to him: “getting bored of the conversation, sir”? The suit chuckled: “Bored of you three maybe. But no this whole thing has caught quite a bit of attention back at base”. 
Mr Fuller was sweating making sure not to say anything that could bring suspicion on the company. The detective leaned back: “I’m sure we’ll get to the bottom of it, sir”. 
“Oh I’m sure you will. I’ll be keeping an eye on your work, detective”. The suit said looking back. A tall pale man, he wore a confident half smile and had the calmest expression while looking over the drink options. “We’ve been watching your progress you know. Impressive stuff”. He pressed H3, French vanilla coffee. I wanted this mortal for sure so I made sure to heavy up the dosage of tortured fetal blood along with an alluring fragrance found in the iron briar patches of Asmodeus. 

   He took a large gulp a released a satisfied exhale. “Damn good coffee. Tastes just like home.. am I right”? He looked up making direct eye contact with me. I froze. “There’s no way.. is .. does he see me”? I looked behind him, the others were like mannequins. The clock on the wall, the birds outside the window. All frozen in time. “Hey relax in there, I just thought I’d swing by and pay a visit. It’s been a long time since I’ve been so eager to see someone’s next move”. He made his way to the window looking out at what might as well have been a photograph. He took another large sip from his coffee. “I knew I had better keep an eye on you after seeing you blatantly disobey a higher up to get here”. He looked back at me with a sharp intensity. “Try not to disappoint”.
He was gone before I had a chance to speak. The birds continued by and the now three men were continuing on as if there had never been a fourth at all. The world was back in motion and I was filled with pride for knowing that I had finally been seen. But by who I wonder.

   The pressures on now. I’ve got eyes on me from Hell and who knows where else. Everyone in this God forsaken building is right where I want them though. I’m doubling down on the swamp water, keeping the pleasant aroma and adding one new ingredient. The pulverized, nearly liquified, meat of the souls trapped within Beelzebub’s lower jaw. They’re scooped up from the chasm he resides in and forever mashed and churned between the many rows of his molars. You’d think in this state there’d be nothing left of the body or soul but everything remains. Even while mush, spread out between the grooves of the teeth, the pain of being chewed feels to them like the very first crunch every single time. We’re four hours into the work day and it’s time for lunch. The room is packed tight. Everyone sitting scarfing down their food in between agitated breathes, most on their fifth or sixth drink of the day. The air is thick with a menacing tension.

Joe slams open the door entering the break room and marching over to Tom sitting shakily over his meal. “Tom! Hey shit head, you wana tell me why I’ve got all your scrap by my machine”? I noticed Joe was gripping a small screwdriver lightly coated in oil and metal dust. He bent down, now an inch from Tom’s face. “Answer me you fat slob! All you do is wreck everything and leave behind a mess and food crumbs everywhe-“! Joes verbal assault is suddenly cut short. Wide eyed with a confused and frightened look Joe chokes up blood and slowly grips the hefty plastic knife Tom has imbedded deep into his jugular. 

   Deafening silence lasts for mere seconds before Tom slams him to the table and begins pounding his fist into Joe’s temple repeatedly. Spurts of blood hit Samantha’s face who was sitting across from Tom. She licks the splattered blood off her lower lip and a cold dimness overtakes the eyes. She lunges across the table removing the knife from Joe’s throat and digging her fingers deep into the slit desperately removing and devouring whatever she can. All hell breaks loose as a bloody free for all erupts between the workers. Derick has Steven in an arm bar as he eats away at the wrist. Beth is sobbing uncontrollably beating her head against the concrete wall. The rest are caught in unrelenting fist fights and crazed self mutilation. I walked slowly between the symphony of carnage I had orchestrated. I nearly shed a tear witnessing the beauty of it all. Oh and I finally found Ray! He had locked himself in a storage closet eating away and the bloated corpses of the HR lady and supervisor he had dragged in days earlier. He clawed at the side of his face while crying quietly and nervously to himself between each bite. 

  As I was soaking it all in I quickly realized that Frankie was missing out on all the fun! I shut my eyes, focused and opened them back up to see that I was standing beside Frankie in his bed. Face bandaged up unable to sleep and recover. His mind racing with bills, self doubts as a father and provider. The list goes on and on. I can hear his wife and children in the next room. The sounds of crying and hushing rattling his eardrums. I knelt down beside him and whispered thoughts into his mind. “There is a way out. A way to quiet all the stress and be rid of it”. His eyes shifted downward slowly. “You know exactly what you have to do. It would only take seconds.. Merciful really.. you can finally bring peace to this family”. He sat up out of bed and made his way to the closet. He hesitated a moment before opening the door to reveal a loaded shotgun amidst coats and old moving boxes. 

   He had never really been interested in guns. It was a paranoid purchase thinking he’d need it for the protection of his family. I made the shrill cries of his children ring unbearably loud in his ears. Shaking violently he grabbed the shotgun and burst into the next room. His wife jumped in shock unable to process what just entered the room. “FRANKIE?!” she yelled. “Wha- what are you doing”? She grabbed both babies and held them tightly to her chest. “Honey.. please.. I- I know things haven’t been great lately, we’ve been through so much but please y- you have to calm down”! Her words went unheard. Muffled by the ear piercing ringing and cries I’ve locked in his head. Tears streamed down his face. “Im.. Im so sorry” he said. I gently helped him to raise the gun and wrapped my hands over his. Both our fingers planted on the trigger. She tried to speak but fear kept anything other than short panicked cries from escaping her mouth. My eyes grew large, I clinched my teeth hard with the largest smile I had ever worn. We planted the stock  of the shotgun firmly into our shoulders and as he screamed out we squeezed the trigger. 

   With a powerful kick and loud bang we put a hole straight into the ceiling. Silence. She stared at him unblinking, mouth open. Frankie dropped the shotgun and I felt a hard shove back from him. “What the fuck?!” I yelled. He dropped to his knees sobbing “I’m - I’m so sorry! I don’t know what’s wrong with me! What’s happening to me! I can’t think I can’t do anything I.. I”.
She scooted forward with the babies now on both of their laps and wrapped her arms around him crying. “It’s ok!.. It’s ok.. I know.. I love you.. WE love you. We’ll get through this together”. He looked down. His two perfect baby girls, his entire world right in his lap. He held his wife and children and a bright light slammed against my face with a force that felt as if it could have easily killed me right then and there. 

   I awoke back in the coffee machine dazed and weak. The break room was dark and empty. Faded blood stains everywhere throughout. “How… how long have I been out?.. What the hell hit me”? I tried to leave the machine but couldn’t. My body felt in shambles. From the look of the stains it’s been at least four, maybe six weeks I thought. Voices grew loud quickly. In walked the officer and detective from before along with a few others wearing some type of hazmat cleanup suits. 

  “Tell you what I’ll be happy to never step foot in this place again” said the detective. “Tell me about it. The demolition crew can’t get here soon enough”. My heart sank. “This is it.. I’ll be buried in this rubble and returned to Hell”. I was worried but my body ached too much for me to act out or draw them in. I slumped down defeated. 
“Alright everyone let’s clear out of here. The boys will be here soon to finish this place off”. One by one I watched as they left out the door single file. Their hurried paces reminded me of how quickly it all went by. I relaxed accepting my fate. Perhaps I’ll be welcomed home with praises and a new rank. I grinned and closed my eyes to the satisfying thought. And then I felt it… *A3*.
