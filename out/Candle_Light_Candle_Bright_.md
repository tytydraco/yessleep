The road to the cottage was unmarked, and Marie struggled to drag her suitcase along the uneven, unpaved path. She didn’t understand why the cottage was so far removed from the town square, and she didn’t want to question her long-lost aunt’s decision to leave it to her, she was just happy she could cash it in if the property was still livable.

A month ago, Marie had received the deed from a lawyer in England, informing her of her late Aunt Beth's passing. In her will, Aunt Beth had bequeathed all of her remaining property—the cottage, to Marie’s surprise. The generosity seemed strange, considering Marie and her aunt had never been particularly close. Aunt Beth used to visit during Christmas and birthdays when Marie was younger, but over the years, her visits had become more infrequent. Then, one day, she had simply disappeared altogether, Marie asked a lot about it to her Mum when she was younger, but each time she asked her mother got visibly upset until Marie dropped asking altogether.

Her mother, Beth’s sister, had been upset at first but gradually gave up trying to reach her in the end. It wasn’t until a night when her usually reserved mom had drunk too much wine that she confessed a suspicion—Beth had been involved in some "weird commune activities." At the time, Marie had laughed it off, dismissing it as the ramblings of a woman who had never fully understood her sister’s eccentricities, Beth was always the “eccentric” one out of the two it only made sense for her mother to misunderstand her after all. But now, as she stood in front of the cottage, that strange sense of foreboding crept over her, maybe her mother was onto something but Marie brushed it off, commune shit doesn’t happen in rural England, and the people in the town square looked normal enough .

The cottage was nothing like Marie had imagined. It was older, more worn, and the air around it was heavy, almost as if time had forgotten it. The surrounding woods seemed unnaturally quiet, the chirping of birds absent, the wind still. It felt like she had stepped into another world—a world frozen in time. Still, it looked decent enough to sell, if she gave this place a face lift it would sell handsomely in the right hands. Marie smiled, maybe Aunt Beth’s death wasn’t so bad after all.

Marie stepped inside, the creaky floorboards groaning beneath her weight. The place had an unsettling stillness. Dust settled in every corner, and the air smelled stale, untouched by life. It was as if no one had lived here for decades even though she was positive Aunt Beth was holed up here. She saw signs of life here and there, a well worn down couch in front of the fireplace and some picture frames but all of them were turned to face away from the line of eyesight…weird, maybe Aunt Beth was more eccentric than she remembered. Marie dismissed this and moved through the house slowly, each room more desolate than the last. It was in the back corner of the sitting room that she found something strange—a bookshelf, larger than any she’d seen before, heavy oak with its edges rounded and carved in what looked like symbols as if someone took copious amounts of time and a delicate hand to carve it. Curiosity piqued, she moved closer. At first, the symbols were unrecognizable, but as she ran her fingers over them, a faint pull of recognition tugged at her. She is positive she has never seen this before but why does she feel a sense of déjà vu all of a sudden? She steps back and surveys the room.

From the looks of it, it looked like a study. There was the alluring bookshelf, a table and what appeared to be a wooden chest on the far side of the room. Marie walked towards it to inspect the chest. It was made out of the same material as the bookshelf, the same heavy oak. She never pegged Aunt Beth as a carpenter but what did she know anyway. 

It was a small wooden chest, almost ancient in appearance. She pried it open and found a book—thick and bound in worn, dark leather. The edges of the pages were yellowed, but it was the symbol on the cover that made her pause. It was identical to the ones she had seen carved into the doorframe of the cellar.

Flipping through the pages the words were unintelligible. There were weird symbols and what looked like hand written notes in between the lines all in a foreign language Marie couldn't’ comprehend but she stopped at a note scrawled in plain English. It was the only legible text in the gibberish: *"Never light the candle after midnight."*

A shiver ran down her spine. The warning felt too direct, too ominous. Still, a part of her—perhaps the same part that had brought her to this place in the first place—urged her to ignore the warning. She turned to the back of the cellar, where an old brass candelabra rested on a dust-covered table. Three candles stood unmoving in their holders, their wax untouched by time. The candles looked as if it was new, never lit, Marie distinctively put her hand up to touch it, the wax felt smooth against her hand. She felt a sudden thought zip into her mind “*Light it*”, Marie stepped back, she was stupid but not that stupid. She shrugged it off as jetlag plus with the influx of dust in the room she probably was just tired.

“Get your shit together Mare, Jesus” she whispered under her breath and walked out of the room. Enough crazy for one day, maybe it was the isolation that got to Aunt Beth, it would be understandable, all alone in this remote cottage would drive even the most resilient mind wild Marie decided. 

Marie spent the rest of the day walking through the rest of the cottage, trying to convince herself that the unease she felt was just due to the isolation and the strange surroundings. Aunt Beth was a hoarder for old books and junk. Nothing to get worked up about. Further, Marie felt her jet lag set in, the fact that she hadn't slept properly the night before, added to her tiredness but every time she tried to close her eyes she just couldn’t. 

But as the sun began to set around 7.30 PM, the atmosphere of the house started to change. The silence grew heavier, more oppressive. The walls, once so still and dormant, seemed to whisper in the wind. A chill was in the air and Marie could feel her pulse quicken as the fading light crept into shadows. She returned to the sitting room where the strange book still lay open on the table, the cryptic words staring at her like an accusation.

Night fell fast in the countryside. The sky outside darkened to a muted grey-blue, and soon the cottage was shrouded in twilight. The only light came from the dying embers of the fireplace, casting flickering shadows that danced across the room. Marie found herself in the sitting room again, sitting by the fireplace, her mind wandering back to the note in the book.

*"Never light the candle after nightfall."*

It was a stupid warning, childish almost. It had to be, it was probably a rambling crazy lady. She wasn’t a child anymore, and she wasn’t going to let some vague and ominous note dictate her actions. But a strange tension gripped her chest, something like a voice whispering deep in her mind. She stood up, pacing the room, trying to shake off the growing sense of dread. The candle, that brass candelabra sitting untouched on the table, seemed to taunt her, its pristine wax mocking her hesitation, she touched it again, tempted by the smooth white wax.

She glanced at the old wooden clock on the wall. The time read 7:55 P.M.

Marie let out a sigh of frustration. She hated this—this constant anxiety gnawing at her, this feeling like something was about to slip from the shadows and claim her. But the truth was, she had no choice. The cottage was completely dark, and there were no switches for lights, no lamps anywhere in sight, her phone died while she was on the way here and she burned the last of the firewood because apparently Aunt Beth didn’t understand how central heating worked. The fire was in its last leg of life, fizzling out and sending the room in a shadow, the only light now coming from the twilight outside. She knew this whole cottage would soon plummet into darkness it was only a matter of minutes.

If she wanted light, if she wanted to see anything at all, she had only one option. *The candle.*

Her gaze flickered to the clock again; 8.00 P.M.

*"What’s the worst that could happen?"* she muttered, trying to convince herself that this was just her mind playing tricks on her. But deep down, she knew she was no longer just dismissing the warning. She was questioning it. Was she being foolish? Was she inviting something unseen? Or was it all just a dumb note from an eccentric crazy lady?

A part of her screamed to leave it alone, to just go to bed and get out of this place as soon as possible. But another part, knew there was no way she would be able to navigate the darkness without any light. Further, she has a calling deep inside her, despite knowing the craziness that followed Aunt Beth, she wanted to know what was the ominous message hiding.

Marie’s hand trembled as she reached for the matchbox on the table. It was dusty to touch but it was inviting her and prompting her to light it up. Her heart pounded in her chest, and the silence of the room seemed to press in on her from every side, narrowing in on her. She struck a match and held it to the wick of the first candle. It caught quickly, she saw the wax on the wick melt slowly and a  small flame growing to life in the ever encompassing darkness. She leaned back, watching it flicker in the dim room, the shadows it cast twisting and lengthening, sending it dancing shadows around the room.

For a brief moment, nothing happened. The room stayed still, the fire casting long, creeping shadows on the walls. Marie smiled and thought to herself “*it's just another dumb candle dumbass”*. 

But just as she thought that—a chill swept through the room, sharp and sudden, like someone had opened a door to the night outside. The flame flickered violently, casting erratic light on the walls. And then, out of the corner of her eye, Marie saw something move, in the dancing light she couldn’t make it out but she knew in her bones, there ***was*** something in here with her.

A shadow, unlike the rest. It was deeper, darker, and its shape seemed to shift unnaturally, almost like it was stretching toward her. She blinked, and it was gone however, the chill remained.

Her breathing quickened. She stood frozen, staring at the candle’s flame, her body tense and electric with fear. Something was wrong. This was no ordinary candle. The warning had been real. And yet—she had lit it, she reasoned she had to, she needed light but when she did that, she had ignited whatever had been waiting, locked away in this place, in this cursed cottage.

The shadows twisted again, this time not from the flickering flame but from within the walls themselves. And as they grew, the silence was replaced by the faintest whisper, a murmur that rose and fell like a chant:

*"You should not have lit the candle..."*

Marie took a shaky step back, her mind racing, but the room around her had already begun to change. The air was thick now, dense with something ancient and malevolent. She tried to move, but her legs felt heavy, like they were bound to the floor.

The shadows that had once been mere shapes now seemed to close in around her, and the temperature in the room dropped so rapidly that her breath became visible in the air.

Something—*someone*—was in the room with her. And they were far from pleased.

The only light came from the flickering candle, casting grotesque, twisting shadows that seemed to dance across the walls, they seemed more sinister now. Mocking her and her stupidity for lighting the candle. The air turned heavy with the scent of decay, and the shadows around her seemed to grow thicker, wrapping around her legs like tendrils. She backed away trying to get away but found herself in the corner of the room with no space left to run.

*"You're too late,"* the voice whispered again, louder this time, the words reverberating from the walls of this remote cottage.

Marie felt the room close in on her. She tried to move, but her legs felt like they were plastered to the ground. Something—*someone*—was watching her from the dark. The matchbox in her hands. The dark shadows now grew more potent, bellowing from all around her;

*"To break the curse, a price must be paid."*

Suddenly, the shadows surged toward her, and she was yanked backward, falling into the dark.

The last thing she saw before everything went black was the candle, still burning brightly, its flame now surrounded by an unnatural, swirling darkness.
