I never imagined it would come to this. Retirement. Not from life—I’m not that lucky—but from what I love most: horror. Writing, sharing, curating. My website, *The Abyss*, had become a sanctuary for like-minded souls, a place where the darkness of the human mind could be explored without judgment. But it seems that even within the safety of our twisted little community, real monsters lurk. And they are far worse than anything we could ever dream up.

I suppose I should have seen it coming. When you make yourself a public figure, even one hidden behind a silly username like LlamaGranny, you paint a target on your back. It didn’t help that I insisted on calling out every damn thing I saw as problematic—proudly hashtagging #woke, #inclusive, #socialjustice, whatever buzzword would send the right signal to my followers. It kept the mob at bay, or so I thought.

But then Dealingers showed up.

I’d seen a lot of sick, twisted stuff in *The Abyss*. Hell, I encouraged it. But Dealingers? This guy was something else. His stories were... off. Not in the usual "edgy" way, but in a way that left a bitter taste in your mouth long after you’d finished reading. I could almost feel the rot behind his words, like the stench of a corpse left out too long. The worst part? He was good. Really good.

So good that it pissed me off.

It was one of his less memorable posts, a meandering tale about a family that turns on itself, that got under my skin. I was half asleep when I commented: "Weak. Poor taste in horror, Dealingers. Stick to what you know." It was a petty thing to say, especially since I knew how to push buttons. I half expected a flame war in the comments, but what I didn’t expect was what happened next.

He responded almost immediately: "You think you know horror? You’re just a fat, washed-up joke, LlamaGranny. Get forked."

My fingers trembled with a mix of anger and fear as I banned him on the spot. That should have been the end of it, but the notification popped up moments later. *"You’ve been doxed."*

My real name, my address—everything spilled out for the world to see. He’d included a photo of my house from Google Street View, with a caption underneath: *“See you soon, Llama.”*

I tried to play it off as a bluff. "Yeah, right," I muttered to myself, but the anxiety gnawed at my insides like a rat in a cage. I double-checked the locks, closed the curtains, and kept refreshing my inbox for hours. Nothing happened. Maybe he was just a troll, and the whole thing would blow over.

But the unease didn’t leave me. I cuddled with my companion, Tigress, the world's most protective cat. She kills mice and spiders and protects me from all forms of danger around my home.

It was two nights later when I heard the first sound. A soft scratching at the window. My bedroom is on the ground floor, and as a man of my size, running up and down stairs was a luxury I couldn’t afford. I rolled over, trying to convince myself it was just a tree branch or the wind. But then came the voice.

"Granny... Granny... let me in..."

It was him. Dealingers. Somehow, the sick freak had tracked me down.

I panicked, fumbling for my phone, but my fat fingers failed me. It slipped out of my hand and fell under the bed. The scratching turned to tapping, rhythmic and slow. Like he was enjoying this. I forced myself to move, my bulk shifting in the bed as I reached for the phone, my heart pounding in my ears.

The window shattered.

Glass rained down on the floor, and before I could scream, he was inside, standing at the foot of my bed. He was thin—unsettlingly so—with a crooked grin that stretched too wide across his face. And in his hand, he held a fork. Just a regular, everyday dinner fork.

“Let’s see what you’re made of, Granny,” he whispered.

It was then that Tigress came running out of the shadows and assaulted the intruder, leaping up onto him and clawing at him frantically. The bastard threw my cat out the window, and I was more afraid of what had happened to her than what might happen to me. During the entire ordeal, I was heart-sick and worried about my beloved cat.

I tried to get up, to run, but the mattress creaked under my weight. I was too slow, too heavy. The first stab came quick, a sharp pain in my side as the fork pricked through the thin fabric of my nightshirt. I screamed, more from shock than pain, and flailed wildly, but he was relentless. Over and over, he stabbed me—my arms, my legs, my gut. The fork was small, the prongs bending easily under pressure, but he kept going, giggling like a child at play.

Hours seemed to pass. The stabs hurt, sure, but the worst part was the humiliation. I was too large to kill with a fork. He knew it, and I knew it. The pain was shallow, the blood more of an oozing than a gush. But it wouldn’t stop. I was a living pincushion, unable to do anything but groan and whimper.

Finally, he stopped. The fork was bent out of shape, useless now, and Dealingers tossed it aside with a sigh.

"Not much of a challenge, are you, Granny?" he sneered. "Maybe I’ll come back with something sharper next time."

He turned and walked out, leaving the door wide open as if he owned the place. I lay there, gasping, bleeding, and too weak to move. It wasn’t until dawn that I finally found the strength to call for help. I picked up the fork, evidence that he'd tried to kill me.

When the police finally arrived they treated me like I was crazy. I couldn't understand why they didn't take me seriously, except the paramedics who checked me out decided the wounds were self-inflicted, since all of them were around the middle of my body, like I had stabbed myself hundreds of times with a fork. The police had the fork and determined only my fingerprints were on it.

The police had me sign that an intruder had broken my window and attempted entry, but they felt the front door being left open was my doing.

"Burglars always leave the same way they entered." One of the police told me, smiling weirdly, with a look in his eye that drove a cold spike of fear into my heart. Somehow, his face was just like Dealingers. I shuddered and said nothing.

After they left I started crying and trembling in fear. I was in shock when I logged into my website and locked it down, disabling access to it for everyone. I'm sorry I did that, but I had to.

Real horror isn't what you write about, it is what comes for you in the dead of the night and forks the hell out of you.

While I was preparing my account of what happened to me, to share with the world, Tigress returned through the broken window, meowing loudly. I made myself get up and go to her and pick her up. I checked her for any injuries, and she is fine.

I think, maybe, I will be too.

Love,

LlamaGranny
