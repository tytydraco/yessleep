"Thalia," I said when the landlady asked what my name was.

"Perfect," she said. "You're accepted to rent a flat here." It was strange to hear myself being accepted to rent a flat—especially because my name was Thalia.

A few weeks back, I saw an advertisement on social media promoting this small flat at a surprisingly affordable price. The ad stated that it only accepted tenants with Thalia as their first name.

Weird. But I needed a new place ASAP since my previous flat's owner increased the monthly rent, and the payment was due.

"What's with Thalia, if you don't mind me asking?" I asked the landlady.

The landlady giggled. "It's just one of my husband's eccentric sides," she replied. "He loves the name Thalia. He wanted to rent out our building, but only to Thalias. Well, it's his business, his money, his building, so who am I to say no—as long as I get my part," the landlady laughed.

"Is it your name?" I asked again.

"Oh no, young lady. No. My name is Lucy," she responded. "But he named our only daughter Thalia. So, there you have it."

"When will you be moving in?" she asked.

"Tomorrow, if possible," I said.

"Of course," the landlady replied. "We only have twelve rooms here—four rooms per floor, three floors for rent. The fourth floor is entirely for my family. And you're the last tenant—the twelfth."

"Which floor do I stay on?" I asked again.

"First floor, at the back," she replied. "Every tenant has the right to pick their room, but since you're the last, you get the only remaining one. Is that okay with you?"

"Yeah, sure. I don't mind, as long as I have a place to stay."

"So now the flat is full, meaning you have twelve Thalias in the building?" I was dead curious, so I couldn't bear not to ask when the landlady sent me out the door.

"Thirteen, if you count my daughter, who lives with me and my husband on the top floor," she replied warmly, a bright smile on her face.

"Is it tough finding the Thalias?" I wondered aloud.

The landlady laughed. "It is, yeah," she replied. "But it's my husband's business, his eccentricity, and this building isn't our only source of income, so we have no problem."

I returned to the building the next day, bringing all my stuff into my room. Thank goodness mine was on the first floor, so I didn't have to go through the pain of going up and down the stairs.

But I was curious about how the other Thalias looked.

And what they thought about this weird requirement.

So, I went door to door, from the first floor to the top, introducing myself as the new tenant.

They were all Thalias, of course. They were of different races, family backgrounds, jobs, and personalities—you name it. The only thing uniting us twelve was our first name.

I hadn't had the chance to ask all of them about the weird Thalia-only requirement, as some didn't seem too friendly. But those I did talk to had similar stories to mine. It was weird, they said, but that was all. We needed a place to stay, and it was super affordable.

But I couldn't just shrug it off.

The owner's obsession with a name was one thing. I could accept that. But insisting on only taking in tenants named Thalia? That didn’t seem like good business.

Yes, they had other sources of income, but still, this Thalia-only thing wasn't exactly logical.

The next few weeks passed as usual—nothing different. But one evening, just as I entered the building and grabbed my room’s doorknob, I heard a voice calling me.

"Hey, Two."

I turned to see another tenant from the first floor—Room Four—peeking out from her doorway.

"Do you have time?" she asked, almost in a whisper.

"Yeah, Four. I guess. What's up?" I said as I walked toward her.

All twelve tenants in the building were named Thalia, so it would have been confusing to call each other by our first names. Since last names weren’t commonly used where I lived, the first four tenants who got acquainted decided we should just call each other by our room numbers. And my room number was two.

"Have you seen Seven lately?" Four asked.

"The last time I saw Seven was when I was at Six’s room three days ago," I said. "I was returning the scissors I had borrowed."

"Did she seem okay to you?"

"I saw her enter her room with her boyfriend, laughing their asses off. So, yeah, she seemed fine to me. Why? Is something wrong?"

"Maybe," Four hesitated. "Seven’s boyfriend is my colleague at work. He hasn’t shown up for three days. His teammates called him, but no response. I haven't seen Seven either."

"Have you tried knocking on her door?" I asked.

"I did. No response. I even called her while standing outside her door."

"And...?"

"It rang," Four replied, "but no one picked up. I called her five times, but nothing. I heard her phone ringing, but she never answered."

"Seven is a phone girl," I said. "There’s no way she wouldn’t pick up after five rings, especially if she was in her room."

"Exactly."

"How about we ask Six?" I suggested. "She lives next door to Seven. Seven is loud when she talks—and even louder when she... you know. Six must have heard something."

Four and I went upstairs and knocked on Six’s door.

No response.

We called her name.

Still nothing.

We called her phone—three times. It rang, but no one answered.

"Twelve is also missing," Four suddenly spoke again.

"You checked?" I asked.

"Yeah. And better yet, I have the spare key to her room. Remember when Twelve and I got close, and she often asked me to check on her pet hamster whenever she was away?"

"So you already went inside?"

"Yes. Four days ago. She wasn’t there. But her hamster was. She always asked me to check on it whenever she was out. There's no way she'd just leave without telling me."

"Did you phone her?"

"I did. I was in her room when I heard her phone ringing. It wasn’t locked, so I checked her chats to see if she mentioned going somewhere."

"And...?"

"Her last message was five days ago. She told her mom she wasn’t feeling well and planned to stay in."

"Weird," I muttered. "Did you ask the landlady?"

"I did. That made things even weirder," Four said. "She told me she hadn’t seen Twelve either, but reassured me by saying, ‘Don’t worry. You’ll be reunited with her soon. Just stay in your room.’"

"Shit! That’s creepy!"

"Right?"

"I have a bad feeling about this," I said.

"So do I."

"How about we get out of here and talk somewhere else?" I suggested.

"Let's do that," Four agreed.

We walked downstairs—only to freeze in shock.

"What the hell?!" Four and I shouted in unison as we stepped onto the first floor, where we were supposed to see the door that led to the outside of the building.

Supposed to be.

The door was no longer there. Instead, a plain, solid concrete block stood right in front of us. Not even a window was in sight. We looked around to see that the doors to our rooms were still there.

We were still trying to figure out what had happened when we heard a voice echoing. A female voice. Someone we knew.

"I told you to just stay in your room, haven't I? Bad girls!" It was the voice of the landlady, echoing through the entire building.

"What do you want? Let us go!" I yelled as I looked around.

No answer.

Then we saw someone slowly walking down the stairs—a slightly chubby old lady, wearing a flowery-patterned long dress. The landlady.

"What do you want from us?" Four yelled as we took steps backward toward the concrete wall where the door was supposed to be.

"I don’t want anything," she said. "My daughter does."

The moment the landlady said it, Four and I saw a young woman walk from behind her, down the stairs, approaching us.

"This is my daughter, Thalia. The 13th Thalia," the landlady spoke to us. "Please do us a favor by handing over your youth and life essence without a fight."

The 13th Thalia—the landlady’s daughter—lifted both of her hands as she descended the stairs. The very next second, I felt something pulling my soul out of my body.

I choked. My body felt like it was burning from the inside. I was losing my strength to stand and slowly collapsed onto the floor.

As I stared at my hands clutching my chest, I saw them slowly turn grayish-pale and wrinkled. As if my flesh was being extracted from my body, my hands and legs grew thin.

The choking, the burning sensation—it was getting stronger by the second.

I could hear myself screaming in pain, begging for mercy.

"WHO THE HELL ARE YOU?!" Thirteen screamed in anger, her harsh voice echoing as she pointed her finger at someone still standing beside me.

I glanced to the side.

I saw Four standing strong—completely unaffected by whatever spell Thirteen and her mother had cast on us.

"You—all of you twelve—are supposed to be the source of my resurrection. My parents and I spent a year finding twelve Thalias so I could proceed with the ritual to renew my life essence. Don’t you dare mess this up!" Thirteen raged as she reached out her hand, trying to cast a spell on Four.

But to no avail.

Four dodged the cast effortlessly—without even trying.

"Your necklace! Show us your necklace!" the landlady yelled at Four, who reached inside her T-shirt’s collar and pulled out her necklace. A coin-like pendant hung at the end of it.

Within the emblem, a symbol was carved—one I didn’t recognize. At a glance, it looked like a pair of wings and a halo, surrounded by runic letters.

"It’s an Angel Emblem," the landlady shrieked, her voice laced with anger and disappointment. "She’s from the Angel family. How did I not notice the emblem when she first came?!"

Meanwhile, I still felt my body slowly burning and rotting from the inside.

I looked at the tips of my fingers—they were turning to dust.

"Four…" I called out her name in a whisper, barely able to get my voice out. It was a desperate plea for help.

Realizing that her necklace had saved her, Four immediately knelt down beside me and untied her necklace. She held my wrinkled arm and tied the necklace together onto both my hand and hers.

Slowly but surely, I began to recover.

My entire body, once grayish and wrinkled, started reverting to normal. The choking and burning inside me began to fade.

"OH, FUCK! YOU RUINED EVERYTHING!" Thirteen screamed in fury, her voice deep, heavy, almost demonic.

"EXPEL THEM, THALIA!" the landlady ordered her daughter.

"BUT I’M MISSING TWO THALIAS!"

"THE LONGER SHE’S HERE, THE EMBLEM WILL DESTROY US! WE’LL FIND ANOTHER WAY!"

Thirteen screamed in frustration before casting another spell—this time, reverting the concrete wall behind us into doors. With a wave of her hand, she forced them open and hurled Four and me outside, onto the road, into the middle of the night.

The second we landed hard on the pavement, we looked up.

The building was still there. But it seemed… different. Dark. Paintless. No lights. Cracks and moss covered its surface, almost as if it had been abandoned for decades.

"They’re gone?" I muttered.

"Looks like it," Four replied. "Are you okay, Two?"

"I’m still alive, so… yeah, I guess."

"Have you always had that necklace with you?" I asked Four, curious.

"Honestly, no," Four admitted. "I visited my mom this morning and told her about the strange rules of the building I rented. And about the missing tenants. Then she handed me this necklace. It’s hers."

"You guys okay?" A man’s voice suddenly startled us. We turned to see a man about our age standing nearby.

"Yeah, we’re okay," I said as he helped us to our feet.

"What are you doing in front of this abandoned building?"

"What do you mean abandoned?" Four asked.

"This building has been abandoned for 187 years," the man said. "No one dares to come near it, let alone buy it. People say strange and terrifying things happen when you step onto its porch—but no one else can see it, even if there’s a crowd on this road. In broad daylight."

"Yeah, of course," I whispered to myself.

"The lady who owned the building 187 years ago had a weird, creepy name," the man continued.

"Lucy?" I asked, remembering the landlady mentioning her name once.

"Do you know her last name?"

"What?" I asked.

"Verhel. She was Lucy Verhel."

Oh. Right. How witty and ironic.

Then I realized something that added shit to everything. The building itself consisted of thirteen rooms in total—thirteen, a number of bad luck in some cultures and beliefs. The building also had four floors, with four rooms on each floor, except for the one on top—four, a number of bad luck in other cultures and beliefs.

Funny enough, my friend, who lived in room number four and was hence called by the nickname Four, became the bad luck to the landlady and her daughter.

"Why don’t you girls untie that necklace? Must be tough walking around like that," the man pointed out.

Four and I remained silent. We still held each other’s hands, tied by Four’s necklace and its magical emblem.

As the man turned to walk away, we caught a glimpse of a tattoo on his upper right arm.

The tattoo resembled a coin-like emblem.

It featured an image of a goat's skull with huge horns at the center, surrounded by runic letters.
