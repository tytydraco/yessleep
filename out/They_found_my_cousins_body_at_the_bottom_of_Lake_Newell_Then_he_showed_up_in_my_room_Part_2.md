Back home, the house felt suffocatingly quiet.

I sat curled up on my bed, staring blankly at the wall. The funeral had drained me—physically, mentally, emotionally—but every time I tried to close my eyes, the same images flashed in my mind: Tom’s small body lying lifeless on the shore, his framed photograph on top of the casket, and that dark stain spreading at its base, like water seeping from somewhere deep and hidden. It didn’t make sense. None of it made sense.

I wrapped my arms around my knees, shivering despite the thick comforter pulled tightly around me. The house was dark and still, the only sound the occasional creak of the floorboards settling. My parents were asleep down the hall, exhausted and silent. I hadn’t told them what I’d seen—what I thought I’d seen. They wouldn’t believe me. I barely believed myself.

But something was wrong. I knew it. I could feel it, like a weight pressing down on my chest, making it hard to breathe. Tom was here. I didn’t know how, or why, but he was still… somewhere.

*He likes to watch.*

Lily’s words echoed in my head, sending a chill down my spine. I squeezed my eyes shut, fighting back the panic that threatened to swallow me whole. Was he really here, in the house? Watching me? Why? What did he want?

I didn’t know. I wasn’t sure I wanted to know.

A soft thump broke the silence.

I jerked upright, my heart lurching painfully. The sound had come from downstairs. I held my breath, straining to listen. For a long moment, there was only silence.

Then, slowly, I heard it: the faint, almost imperceptible creak of footsteps on the stairs.

My blood ran cold. I shot a glance at the clock—2:15 a.m. No one should be awake. My parents were heavy sleepers, and the only other people in the house were…

I swallowed hard, my pulse racing. *Tom.*

I slid out of bed, my bare feet brushing against the cold hardwood floor. Every instinct screamed at me to stay put, to pull the covers over my head and pretend I hadn’t heard anything. But I couldn’t. I had to know. I had to see.

Slowly, I crept to the door, easing it open just enough to peer into the dark hallway. The floorboards outside my room gleamed faintly in the moonlight, empty and still. I hesitated, my heart pounding, then slipped out into the hall, my footsteps soft and silent.

I moved toward the stairs, every nerve in my body tingling with fear. The darkness seemed thicker here, pressing in around me, making it hard to see. I squinted, trying to make out the bottom of the staircase. Had I really heard something? Or was I just imagining things?

A flicker of movement caught my eye, and I froze.

There, at the base of the stairs, a small, pale figure stood, half-hidden in the shadows. I sucked in a breath, my heart leaping into my throat. It was him. I knew it was him.

“Tom?” I whispered, my voice trembling.

The figure shifted, stepping slightly into the pale moonlight streaming through the front window. My breath caught in my throat. It was Tom—his small frame soaked and dripping, his eyes wide and unblinking.

He didn’t say anything. He just… stared at me, his gaze intense, his head tilted slightly to the side.

“Tom,” I breathed, taking a step down. “Is it… is it really you?”

He didn’t move. Didn’t speak. But as I stared down at him, I saw it—the dark water dripping steadily from his hair, pooling around his bare feet. The same stain I’d seen at the funeral. The same cold, wet scent that lingered in the air.

“Why are you here?” I whispered, my voice tight with fear. “What… what do you want?”

He didn’t respond. Just stood there, watching me with that same blank, empty expression.

A shiver ran down my spine, and I hugged my arms around myself, trembling. This wasn’t right. It didn’t feel right. He looked like Tom—he *was* Tom—but there was something else, something strange and unsettling about the way he stood there, so still and silent.

“Please,” I murmured, my voice barely more than a breath. “Please, just… say something.”

But he didn’t. He didn’t move. He just kept watching me, his eyes dark and empty.

And then, slowly—so slowly I almost didn’t see it—he raised one hand.

I flinched, my heart racing. His fingers twitched, then stretched out, pointing down the hallway. I followed his gaze, my pulse pounding in my ears.

There, at the end of the hall, my bedroom door stood ajar. And from within, I saw it—a soft, pale glow, flickering faintly in the darkness.

“What…?” I breathed, taking a step back. “What is that?”

Tom didn’t answer. He just stood there, his hand still outstretched, his gaze fixed on the faint, ghostly light emanating from my room.

I turned, staring at the glow. It pulsed softly, like the steady beat of a heart, casting eerie shadows across the walls. I’d never seen anything like it. And yet, there was something familiar about it—something that tugged at the edges of my memory, sending a chill through my veins.

I glanced back at Tom, my breath hitching. He was watching me again, his eyes wide and unblinking. Waiting.

“You… want me to go in there?” I whispered, my voice trembling.

He didn’t respond. Didn’t move. But I knew. I could feel it. He wanted me to follow him. He wanted me to see.

Slowly, I turned and took a step toward the glow, my heart pounding wildly. Each step felt like a lifetime, my body tense and shaking. I reached out, my fingers brushing against the door, and pushed it open wider.

The glow brightened, flaring up for a split second before dimming again. I took a deep breath, my pulse racing, and stepped inside.

The room was empty. Dark. But there, in the center of the floor, a wet footprint glistened faintly in the pale light.

My heart stopped. I stared down at the print, my mind spinning. The shape was distinct, the impression deep enough to show the curve of an arch, the ball of the foot. It could have only belonged to one person. *Tom.*

I glanced back at the doorway, my breath catching in my throat.

But he had vanished.

The hallway was empty, the shadows deep and still. There was no sign of him, no sound, no movement. Just the faint, lingering scent of lake water, hanging heavy in the air.

“Tom?” I whispered, stepping back, my pulse racing. “Tom, are you—”

A soft, ghostly whisper echoed through the room, cutting me off.

“Ellie…”

I spun around, my heart leaping into my throat. The voice was faint, distorted—like a breath of wind or a ripple in water. It sent a shiver down my spine, making the hairs on the back of my neck stand on end.

“Ellie…”

The glow pulsed once, then slowly faded, leaving the room dark and cold. I stood there, trembling, my mind reeling.

He was trying to tell me something. I was sure of it now. But… he was struggling, as if the effort cost him something I couldn’t see. He seemed lost and confused, his form flickering like a weak flame, unable to stay solid for long.

“Tom…” I whispered, wrapping my arms around myself. “What do you want?”

But the room remained silent, the air thick and heavy. And as I stared at the empty space where he’d stood, I realized...he needed *help*.

The trouble was, I had no idea how to provide it.

**\* \* \* \* \* \***

The next few days were a blur.

I kept expecting everything to go back to normal—to wake up and find out it had all been some terrible dream—but it never did. Tom was still gone, and the strange occurrences around the house only grew worse. Little things, at first: doors creaking open by themselves, the TV turning on in the middle of the night, the soft sound of water dripping in empty rooms. But it was the smell that got to me the most—the unmistakable scent of lake water, cold and murky, clinging to the air like an invisible presence.

Mom and Dad didn’t seem to notice. They were still caught up in their own grief, moving through the house like shadows of themselves, barely speaking to each other or to me. But I noticed. Every time I caught a glimpse of movement out of the corner of my eye, every time I heard a faint whisper that sounded like my name, my heart would leap, and I’d find myself holding my breath, straining to catch some sign of him.

*Tom… what are you trying to say?*

But he never answered. Never showed himself the way he had that night at the bottom of the stairs. It was as if he were… fading, slipping further and further away, his presence growing weaker by the day. And yet, he was still here. I knew it. I could feel it.

And then, one night, everything changed.

I was lying in bed, staring blankly at the ceiling, when I heard it: the faint sound of splashing water, echoing softly through the house. I shot up, my heart pounding. The sound was coming from downstairs.

I crept to my door, my breath hitching, and peered out into the dark hallway. Nothing moved. But the sound continued—a soft, rhythmic *splash, splash, splash*, like someone wading through shallow water.

“Tom?” I whispered, my voice trembling.

No answer. Just that steady, hypnotic splashing, growing louder by the second.

I stepped out into the hall, my pulse racing, and made my way toward the stairs. The house felt different tonight—colder, darker. The shadows seemed to shift and breathe, wrapping around me like a thick, suffocating fog. I hesitated at the top of the stairs, staring down into the murky darkness below.

And then I saw it: a soft, pale glow, flickering faintly at the bottom of the staircase.

“Tom?” I whispered again, taking a step forward. The glow brightened slightly, casting eerie shadows across the walls.

I took another step, then another, my legs trembling. The splashing grew louder, sharper, until it seemed to fill the entire house, echoing off the walls, the floors, the ceiling. My skin prickled with cold, and I wrapped my arms around myself, shivering violently.

“Tom, is that you?” I called softly.

And then, as I reached the bottom of the stairs, I saw him.

He stood in the center of the living room, his small frame hunched and shivering, his clothes soaked and dripping. The glow surrounded him, pulsing softly, illuminating his pale, hollow face. Water pooled around his bare feet, spreading outward in dark, rippling circles.

“Tom!” I gasped, stumbling forward. He didn’t move, didn’t react. He just stood there, staring blankly at the floor.

“Tom, what—what’s happening?” I whispered, my heart aching. “Why are you here?”

His gaze lifted slowly, his eyes locking on mine. And for the first time, I saw it—the fear in his eyes, the way his shoulders trembled as if he were struggling to hold himself together.

“Ellie…” he whispered, his voice faint and broken.

My breath caught in my throat. “Tom, I—what do you want me to do? Just tell me. I’ll do anything.”

But he just shook his head slowly, his gaze flickering to the far end of the room. I followed his gaze, my stomach twisting painfully.

And then I saw her.

A small figure—no more than six or seven—stood in the corner, half-hidden in the shadows. Her hair was dark and tangled, her face pale and ghostly. She looked… wrong, somehow. Blurred, like a reflection on the surface of the water.

My pulse stuttered. “Who… who is that?”

Tom didn’t answer. He just turned back to me, his expression twisted with pain and desperation.

“She’s going to drown,” he whispered, his voice strained. “You have to help her.”

I stared at him, my heart pounding wildly. “What? Who is she? Where—where is she?”

Tom’s gaze shifted, his eyes dark and haunted. “The lake,” he murmured, his voice barely more than a breath. “She’s at the lake.”

My stomach dropped. “Tom, I don’t—”

“She’s going to drown, Ellie,” he pleaded, his form flickering like a candle flame in the wind. “You have to save her. Please…”

The glow around him flared suddenly, bright and blinding. I threw up a hand, shielding my eyes, my heart racing. When I lowered it again, he was gone.

I staggered back, gasping for breath, my mind spinning. The room was empty, silent. No sign of Tom, no sign of the girl. Just the faint scent of lake water, lingering in the air.

“Tom!” I cried, spinning around. “Tom, come back! Please, just—”

But there was no answer. No movement. The house was dark and still, the only sound the rapid thudding of my own heartbeat.

I sank to my knees, trembling. What had just happened? Who was that girl? And what did he mean—she was going to drown? How did he know?

“Tom, please,” I whispered, my voice breaking. “Just tell me what to do. I don’t understand…”

But the room remained silent, empty. And deep down, I knew that he couldn’t stay. Whatever was keeping him here, whatever fragile connection he had to this world, it was weakening. He was slipping further and further away, his presence growing fainter by the day.

But there was something he needed me to do. Someone I needed to help.

“She’s at the lake,” I murmured, hugging my knees to my chest. “She’s going to drown…”

I shivered, my breath hitching. Could it be real? Could there really be someone—some *thing*—waiting for me at Lake Newell? And if there was… could I really save her?

I didn’t know. But I had to try. For Tom’s sake. For that little girl’s sake.

For my own.

**\* \* \* \* \* \***

I felt like I was moving in a dream as I climbed out of bed, threw on my jacket, and grabbed my bike. The house was silent, the shadows thick and heavy, but I didn’t look back. I couldn’t. If I stopped now—if I hesitated—I knew I’d lose my nerve.

Tom’s words echoed in my mind: *“She’s going to drown… You have to save her.”*

My hands shook as I wheeled my bike quietly down the driveway. The air was cold and still, the moon hanging low in the sky. I glanced back at the dark windows of my house one last time, then swung my leg over the seat and took off down the street.

The ride to Lake Newell was a blur. The empty streets whizzed past, the streetlights casting long, eerie shadows across the pavement. My heart pounded in my chest, my breath clouding in the chilly night air. I pedaled faster, the wind whipping through my hair. The dark shapes of the houses and trees seemed to merge into a single, endless stretch of darkness. But I couldn’t slow down. Not now.

As I neared the lake, the faint sound of water lapping against the shore reached my ears. I skidded to a stop, breathless and trembling, and leaned my bike against a tree. The park was deserted, the sand pale and empty under the moonlight. I shivered, hugging my jacket closer around me. It felt like the whole world was holding its breath, waiting.

“Tom?” I called softly, my voice trembling. “Are you here?”

No answer. Just the soft whisper of the wind through the trees, the distant creak of a swinging sign by the lake entrance. But I could feel it—something drawing me forward, tugging at me like an invisible thread. I swallowed hard and started toward the shoreline, my shoes sinking into the soft sand.

The water was smooth and dark, the moonlight casting eerie reflections across its surface. I took a deep breath, scanning the shoreline. The campground on the opposite bank was quiet, its flickering campfires just visible through the trees. I knew that campground—knew it was mostly families and kids on summer weekends like this one. But why would a little girl be out here alone at this hour?

And then, I saw her.

She was at the far end of a narrow wooden dock, chasing fireflies.

I blinked, my breath catching in my throat. The girl was small, no more than six or seven, her hair wild and loose around her shoulders. She was wearing pale pink pajamas, the kind with long sleeves and a cartoon bunny printed on the front. Her tiny feet were bare, the moonlight glinting off her toes as she skipped and darted after the glowing insects. A small laugh escaped her lips as she caught one in her cupped hands, holding it close to her face, the bright light illuminating her wide, delighted eyes.

What was she doing out here? It was the middle of the night! I took a step forward, squinting through the darkness.

“She must have gotten out of bed,” I murmured to myself, my heart racing. “Chasing fireflies… her parents probably don’t even know she’s gone…”

Panic surged through me. She was too far out—too close to the edge of the dock. One wrong step, and she’d fall right into the deep water.

“Hey!” I shouted, my voice high and desperate. “Hey, wait! Don’t go any further!”

But she didn’t seem to hear me. She just laughed again, shaking the firefly free and watching it flit away. She took a step closer to the edge, reaching out with both hands, her gaze fixed on the glowing insects swirling around her.

“Stop!” I screamed, breaking into a run. “Please, stop!”

But it was too late.

I watched, helpless, as she took one more step—and slipped.

Her small body hit the water with a soft splash, the sound carrying eerily through the stillness of the night. My breath caught in my throat. I skidded to a stop at the edge of the dock, staring down into the dark, rippling water.

“No!” I gasped, dropping to my knees. “No, no, no…”

The girl’s pale face bobbed to the surface for a split second, her eyes wide and terrified, her mouth opening in a silent scream. Then she disappeared, pulled under by the icy grip of the lake.

Panic surged through me. Without thinking, I kicked off my shoes and dove in after her.

The water was shockingly cold, closing around me like a vise. I gasped, the breath knocked from my lungs, and kicked hard, forcing myself deeper. The murky water stung my eyes, blinding me. I reached out, my fingers groping desperately in the darkness, searching for any sign of her.

*Come on… please… where are you?*

And then I felt it—a small hand, brushing against mine.

I grabbed it, my heart leaping. The girl’s hand was slippery and cold, her fingers limp in my grasp. I kicked hard, pulling her close, my lungs burning with the effort. She was heavier than I’d expected, her small body weighed down by the waterlogged pajamas. But I couldn’t let go. I wouldn’t.

I kicked again, harder this time, and felt us break the surface. I gasped, sucking in a mouthful of cold air, and tightened my grip on the girl. She was coughing weakly, her eyes wide and frightened. I wrapped my arm around her, keeping her head above water, and started kicking toward the shore.

“It’s okay,” I panted, my voice hoarse. “I’ve got you. Just—just hold on.”

The swim back was only fifty or sixty feet, but it felt like an eternity. The water tugged at me, pulling me down, the cold sapping my strength. I struggled to keep moving, my muscles screaming in protest. I could barely see the shoreline, the dark outline of the trees blurring in and out of focus. But I kept going, my pulse pounding, my lungs burning.

Finally, I felt the soft sand beneath my feet. I staggered forward, dragging the girl onto the shore. We collapsed in a heap, gasping and shivering, our clothes soaked and heavy. I cradled her small form, my chest heaving, and looked down at her pale, tear-streaked face.

“You’re okay,” I whispered, brushing a strand of wet hair from her forehead. “You’re safe now.”

She blinked up at me, her eyes wide and bewildered. She was shaking, her tiny body trembling violently. I pulled her closer, trying to warm her, my own body shivering uncontrollably.

“Wh—where’s your family?” I asked softly, glancing back across the lake. “Are they at the campground?”

The girl nodded weakly, her gaze drifting back to the dark water. “I—I was chasing the fireflies,” she whispered, her voice small and broken. “I—I didn’t mean to… I just wanted to catch one…”

Tears pricked at my eyes, and I hugged her tighter. “It’s okay,” I murmured. “You’re okay.”

“Aubrey! Where are you?” A man’s voice, desperate and panicked, echoed from across the campground.

“Aubrey!” A woman’s voice joined his, her tone shrill and trembling. “Please, answer us!”

My head snapped up. “Over here!” I shouted, my voice hoarse and ragged. “She’s over here!”

The voices stopped. Then I heard them calling back, closer now, their footsteps pounding against the sand. I turned to the girl—Aubrey—and gave her a weak smile.

“It’s going to be okay,” I whispered. “Your mom and dad are coming.”

A moment later, a man and woman burst out of the darkness, stumbling to a stop as they spotted us. “Oh my God,” the woman gasped, dropping to her knees beside Aubrey. “Aubrey, baby, are you okay? Are you hurt?”

Aubrey shook her head, her face crumpling. “I—I’m okay,” she whispered, clinging to her mother’s arm. “I’m okay, Mommy…”

The man turned to me, his face pale and stricken. “Did you… did you save her?”

I nodded weakly, my whole body trembling. “She… she fell in. I—I just pulled her out…”

His face twisted with emotion, and he reached out, gripping my arm. “Thank you,” he whispered, his voice thick. “Thank you so much.”

I opened my mouth to respond, but the world swayed around me. My legs gave out, and I collapsed onto the sand, my limbs numb and heavy. I heard the parents’ frantic voices, felt their hands on my shoulders, but I couldn’t focus. Everything was spinning, blurring…

And then, through the haze, I saw him.

Tom stood at the water’s edge, his form faint and wavering, watching us with that same calm, distant gaze.

“Thank you,” he whispered softly.

I blinked, tears blurring my vision. “Tom, I—”

But he was already fading, his form dissolving into the mist, melting away like smoke.

“Tom!” I tried to call out, but my voice was too weak. “No, wait—please!”

But he was gone.

And this time, I knew he wasn’t coming back.

**\* \* \* \* \* \***

The house was dark and quiet when I finally got home.

My parents had already gone to bed. I slipped in through the front door, still shivering from the chill of the lake water, my limbs sore and heavy with exhaustion. The events of the night blurred together in my mind—the frantic ride to the lake, the panic when I saw the little girl fall in, the icy water closing around me as I fought to pull her back to shore.

And Tom. Tom standing at the water’s edge, his ghostly form watching me with those calm, solemn eyes.

I hung my jacket on the back of a chair, the fabric still damp and smelling faintly of lake water, and wandered into the living room. The house felt strange tonight—quiet, but not empty. The lingering weight I’d carried for weeks seemed lighter, as if something inside me had finally loosened, freeing me from its grip.

But it wasn’t just me. The entire house felt different. Warmer. Lighter.

Tom was really gone.

I sank onto the couch, burying my face in my hands. I’d saved the little girl. I’d done what he’d wanted—what he’d needed me to do. And now, finally, he was at peace.

But it hurt. It hurt so much more than I’d expected.

A soft, almost imperceptible breeze brushed past me, stirring the curtains. I looked up, my heart skipping a beat. There, on the wall opposite the couch, a framed photograph of Tom—taken last summer at his birthday party—seemed to glow faintly in the moonlight. He was grinning, his eyes bright with laughter, his hair sticking up in wild tufts as he held up a slice of cake.

I smiled weakly, tears pricking at my eyes. *Goodbye, Tom.* I glanced at the empty hallway, half-expecting to see his shadowy form flickering in the dark.

But the hallway was empty. The house was still.

He was really, truly gone this time.

I leaned back, closing my eyes, my body sinking into the soft cushions. It felt strange—wrong, almost—to be relieved. But I was. I was relieved, and sad, and happy, and devastated, all at once.

Tom had needed me. He hadn’t been angry. He hadn’t blamed me. He’d just wanted to protect someone else from suffering the way he had. He’d just wanted to save her.

And I had.

The thought warmed me, a tiny spark of light in the darkness. I took a deep, shuddering breath, feeling it spread through me, filling the empty spaces that grief had hollowed out.

“Goodbye, Tom,” I whispered softly. “I’ll never forget you.”

I stood up slowly, my muscles aching, and made my way to the window. The night outside was calm, the moon casting a soft, silvery glow over the lawn. I stared out at the quiet street, the shadows of the trees swaying gently in the breeze.

And for the first time in weeks, I felt… at peace.

Tom was gone. He was free. And so was I.

I reached up, touching the glass with my fingertips, my heart aching with bittersweet sorrow.

“I love you,” I murmured. “I hope you’re happy now. I hope you… found what you were looking for.”

I turned away, the tears slipping down my cheeks, and headed upstairs. My body felt heavy, my eyes burning with exhaustion. But the weight on my chest—the suffocating, crushing guilt that had kept me awake night after night—was gone.

Tom had forgiven me. I knew that now.

As I reached my bedroom, I hesitated, glancing back at the hallway. The moonlight cast soft, silvery shadows across the floor, the air cool and still. I took a deep breath, my heart aching, and smiled.

“Goodbye,” I whispered one last time.

And then I turned out the light, crawled into bed, and, for the first time since the accident, slept soundly through [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2PotdCGDb_Y) [night.](https://www.creepypastastories.com/staff/craig-groshek/)
