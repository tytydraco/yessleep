The Hollow Within

I never believed in the supernatural. Ghost stories were tales told by campfires, meant to scare children and entertain drunks. I was a man of logic, of facts—an engineer. My mind was wired to solve puzzles, break down problems into manageable parts. But some things don’t fit neatly into equations. Some things cannot be explained.

When I got the offer from Crestview Technologies, it felt like everything was falling into place. The salary was more than generous, the benefits remarkable, and the position—lead project manager—was a dream come true. My wife, Emily, was thrilled. We’d been searching for a fresh start, a better life for our two kids, Rachel, age nine, and Ethan, just five. So we packed up and moved to a quaint town nestled in the heart of Maine.

The house was part of the deal. A sprawling, century-old Victorian manor on the outskirts of town. It stood alone, framed by ancient trees that seemed to twist and bow as if whispering secrets. The porch wrapped around like a pair of protective arms, and the tall, narrow windows stared like eyes. I found it charming. Emily found it eerie but romantic. Rachel and Ethan were just excited to have a new place to explore.

The first few weeks flew by in a blur of work deadlines and unpacking. I was rarely home before dark, and even then, I’d retreat to the study with my laptop. Emily managed the household, homeschooling the kids until we found a suitable local school. Life was good—on the surface.

But things started… shifting. Small things. Lights flickered even though the wiring had been inspected. Doors creaked open on their own, and Rachel complained about cold drafts that seemed to follow her. Emily laughed it off as the quirks of an old house. I dismissed it as her imagination.

Then Rachel began talking about "the shadow man."

"He watches from the corner of my room," she whispered one night as I tucked her in. Her eyes, wide and unblinking, searched mine for reassurance. "He says he won’t hurt me. He just wants to watch."

I smiled, brushing her hair back. "It’s just a bad dream, sweetheart. Shadows can’t hurt you."

She nodded, but her face told me she wasn’t convinced. I kissed her goodnight and left, the creak of the door closing behind me sticking in my mind like a splinter.

The day Rachel disappeared started like any other. I left for work before the sun rose, my mind full of deadlines and blueprints. Emily called around noon, her voice tight with panic.

"She’s gone, Tom! Rachel’s gone!"

"What do you mean gone?" My stomach clenched.

"She was playing in her room… I just stepped away for a second."

The police came. They searched the house, the yard, the surrounding woods. Nothing. No forced entry. No signs of a struggle. It was as if she had simply vanished.

I became a man possessed. I didn’t sleep. I didn’t eat. I scoured the house from top to bottom, every crack and crevice, knocking on walls, pulling up floorboards. It wasn’t until the third night that I found it.

A door. Hidden behind a section of the basement wall, covered with decades of dust and darkness. The wood was old, far older than the rest of the house. My heart thundered as I forced it open.

The room inside was small, suffocatingly so, with stone walls that seemed to pulse with their own dark heartbeat. A single chair sat in the center, facing a blank wall. And on that wall, in a child’s shaky hand, was a name scrawled over and over: Rachel.

I called out, my voice cracking. “Rachel! Rachel, are you here?”

Silence answered. But something moved—just a whisper of air, a breath that was not my own.

Emily found me hours later, sitting on the floor of that cursed room, clutching Rachel’s favorite doll. The police dismissed it as hysteria, as grief. They sealed the door, wrote their reports, and left us to our misery. But I knew. I knew Rachel was still there, somewhere between the walls, lost in the hollow places where reason cannot reach.

I still hear her sometimes. At night, when the house is quiet, her laughter echoes faintly, calling me back to that room. The shadow man watches, waiting for me to make a mistake, to look too long into the darkness.

I will find her. Or I will die trying.
