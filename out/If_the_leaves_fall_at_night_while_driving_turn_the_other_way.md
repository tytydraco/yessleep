This is for and goes to anyone who may come across this post, this story, this is a warning from me to all of you who this can reach Whatever you do wherever you are where if you ever find yourself driving in the dead of night and you in front of your vehicle see leaves upon leaves amongst piles of leaves start to fall suddenly on the road in front of you please stop immediately as soon as you see them and turn your car, motorcycle, truck, SUV, van, or whatever vehicle you are using as means of transportation turn it back the opposite way fast as humanly you can possibly do so. 

 The evening in itself was going quite pleasant, to say the least, if it was meant to be a little reward from a busy day finishing things behind the desk in itself as I glared across the room. While looking at the clock that sat across the stereo set the time had read a near quarter till ten 9:46 pm to be exact to be correctly accurate. As I stepped out from my house through the door which led onto the back deck of it, I stood on top there to get some needed fresh air for myself. 

As  I glazed my eyes up into the night sky above it was looking stunningly beautiful and looked like something to enjoy the view two it brought the feeling of cruising through the backroads of the countryside.    I hopped into my and drove out of my driveway until the tires hit the pavement. I was hit with the sensation from the nightly picture of the sky above the twinkling stars numbered together by the hundreds to even nearing the thousands while driving along the curving long road the rows of towering trees stood beside it as if they were growing statues. Riding that part of the road was smooth if it was driving on a silk sheet around the time the tires of my car touched the asphalt till now is somewhere between fifteen and twenty-eight minutes not far off towards half an hour until suddenly came across a slight dip going downhill which startled me for a brief minute after passing across a short bridge    I began to notice a sudden blinking of an orange light hue illuminating within the car itself it was my gas light blinking on and off darn it I said expressing do to me not paying any mind when I first started up the car on how much fuel I have in the tank to keep the night drive afloat  I counting on down the road Hopefully I could find a gas station in at least in next ten-minute time frame.

&#x200B;

As continuing further down this stretch of backroad   I came across a clearing where fewer trees stand aside it was a couple of houses standard but it could’ve been some old houses where no one resided in  seem for a pretty length of time I kept on driving  for another eight minutes. 

&#x200B;

  Up ahead I saw something mounted into the ground some kind of pole-looking thing with  this greenish color  light stood in the air giving some visibility to what I could make out was a gas station just farther up this road I’m on .I pulled into this very standard gas station onto the far right from the road. 

I parked towards one of the gas pumps that faced closest to the store,  I hopped out of my car and began walking towards the front of the store. As I entered my way through the doorway at first sight it seem as if no one was there at the least not sure if anyone was in the store or was even around the place for that matter but how would the whole store be open with lights all on yet no one in it to run it but just to see if I called out “  Hello anyone here,  hello anyone in here anyone?  I would like to just make a quick fill-up on pump number four. Anyone  in here,  I’m just  a guy trying to fill up on gas  on pump number  four  hello anyone in here anyone in… I  then my  calling out was cut   since I   began to  hear  the sudden movement of a  creaking of something   wooden sound of it was  chair as if someone was  either sitting in it or just rise up out of it  then sound of a ruffled voice said  “  Well what brings you out these late hours of the  night”   the voice came from a middle-aged man  slightly  thinning hair that near a perfect    grey and white  hue while his  iris where an enlarged   perfect blue  of it was an  ocean   and overall looked like he had his fair share rodeo with life   what you are doing this time of the night    I”m Just someone driving that he nearly forgot to check his fuel tank  hmmm so you just been driving without knowing how much gas you have left in the tank   he said joking

Yeah  I began enjoying my driving some much my gas indicator began blinking  on and off in my car and wah-lah I ended up here 

After sliding the twenty dollar bill  to him  for gas  across the counter surface  to him  for gas , grab my receipt  and then began walking towards the exit .As  I  began my journey walking towards the exit  I  nearly was about to leave the store before I could  finally go through the door  of the store I was stopped by the  man’s  voice if he was  trying to speak to me about something or just  simply wishing a    good night assuming he was wishing one a good night and also due to me wanted  to continue on with  my little night adventure 

“ Well, you too have a good night also” acting as if he was saying that right before.   Ahh, I see well before you go venture off on your way   I may ask for you to be extra careful, especially when seeing the leaves on the road in front of your presence  “ok sir”? I responded with confusion about what he was talking about but at first  I  rubbed off as him telling a joke he had up his sleeve.  Hah leaves will never get to me my response to what at first pictured as something the man used to pull my leg.  “All no young mind these are not just leaves which fall from the trees during the fall season mister what are you talking about there are certain tales I hear amongst those who travel during these hours of the night so to let you on your merry way with heed of advice If you see the leaves start falling while you are driving it would best to turn the other way as soon your eyes can see it.

What do you mean about that I ask the middle age man wondering what he was going on about this whole when the leaves fall in front of you it is best to turn around you don't wander down any further it would be best for you to reverse your vehicle back and proceed the previous way you can before  I my warning to you me puzzled but just also want to fill up and get back onto my night ride I walked out the store to do what I needed to do. As I'm walking  I happen to take a brief glance at the store in the window  I spotted the middle-aged man staring out of the glass. I turned back heading to pump number four then began pumping out gas as I waited till the pump finished filling my car tank with the much-needed fuel. 

&#x200B;

After I have finished placing the gas in my cars fuel tank  I got back in   then  continue  further down the stretch of road  the drive seem pretty pleasant as it was at  the get-go of when I began driving it  around  thirteen minutes later the feeling of relaxation  and pleasant comfort of the drive had somewhat faded away  for whatever reason   I became feeling a little chill  and cold 

The sky became from the  once star-lit night one  to  pitch black  if someone hit a magical switch   became  more of nothing but the car’s  headlights becoming  a primary   light source  for me to comntinue on.   the light breeze suddenly became  a sharp chilly  one for one which I roll the full window despite it was just feeling warm  as I pass through   an area  with rows of denser tress  as I am driving    a few leaves start to fall onto  the windshield where the wipers are now I know leaves fall and more will  fall   throughout between  fall and early winter  and began  just nudged it off as just a part of natural occurrence but leaves   huge leaves began falling from above by the dozens   start clustering my windshield  and hood to the point I had to switch the windshield wipers  for a moment on to reduce the amount of clutter.

Many of them numbering by the hundreds lay right in front of the upcoming road which somehow was a reason that made me slow the car to near screeching haul as I could make out there was a pile of leaves if someone was to rake all of them into a pile a humongous leaf pile onto the road as I'm looking for a way to pass by it More and more were piling in the middle of the road in a  much larger pile coming from outta thin air if they were nearly there at the start as I begin processing this to make this make some sense it had seemed as if the leaves were taking up some kind of form as if they were alive as they came closer and closer to my car as my eyes fixated on them. The leaves seemly  to begin to become  some  force my car started  to be pulled in the forward direction into were the hundreds on hundreds of these falling leaves phenomenon began 

As the car was moving further and further down the road it suddenly the leaves, all the adrenaline pumped  throughout from head to toe     toe to head in a mere few seconds on what I could possibly do please god please help me then the thought of reversing the car came to mind as the last resort 

My shaken hand  reached  quickly   over for the driveshaft but at first attempt I  barely could catch  a grip on it due to the overworking of nerves in it   I gained some composure  that was enough  to shift   it into the  reverse position  as I could hear the tires begin skidding  tug of war  against the leaves I notice some even more eerie   fog  now I know fog is natural but  it was as if the fog  was approaching if it was an apparition, spirit, and something that could do me more harm than good, and approaching fast “Come on Come on the car come on back up  back up back up  you hunk of tin 

I floored the car at  near max    speed   at least  that what it had  felt  like in that moment   which it  was just in a  nick-  of-  time to back me from the oncoming  behemoth mass  that  was seemly coming faster towards my direction  I slammed on brakes just in a few seconds  stopping it from nearly driving back  into  one of the towering trees alongside  the road  I shifted the car driveshaft  into drive then peel out nearly burning out my tires  of the as fast as I could because I could see the fog as it had a consious of its own    I kept driving fast I could without the possibility of me running into a ditch or  be the imprint of tree trunk    I continue to drive at a pretty high speed until I began to feel calmer and continue at a much    due to the tug of war between the mass of  leaves  and my car I needed an additional  refill as soon I entered  the store  I mentionn  earlier withoout me saying anything the middle aged man say well what bring you back again  young fellow um um you wouldnt be the the one to witness anything right before you came here no no sir I was driving fast and I ended up coming back here oh that so well if you where having a good time driving fast then why you ol all sweaty with the look of distraught in your eyes        "um um um"  Oh so you did see it the middle aged man questioned  firmly so that is the reason i just spwelled to  him about it  about what I’ve seen earlier "Yes yes I’ll admit I ssen the leaves I’ve seen them falling falling right front of the upcoming road  forming a behemoth mass of them that nearly cause me to draw in towards it I did I did"   What  I warned your ass earlier  I warned you good, your presence  of being here right in front of this counter  is a mere matter of luck .

Wait so you must have heard that people who wander off  down that stretch of road  must  be by it while slashing at my throat  if you know what I'm reffering to   "It is unfourne that I do"   Well could you please  tell me more about how it started off   or any information about it 

"The story goes like this many  decades in the past  many  people were driving that same stretch of road  at night as you were going on just cruising down on it either they were going too fast for their own good or the road is a near cursed one; it was at that time the section of road became the biggest gospel amongst every newspaper and the nearby townsfolk that the stretches of road run to.

So do you know anything about what happened to people that went down that stretch of road at night when the behemoth leaves phenomenon occurs?

The middle-aged man took a sharp inhale breath followed by a deep exhale while he stared away towards the wall behind him as if he was collecting his thoughts together then faced back towards my direction his eyes in a crosshair glaze which nearly focused way deep into my pupils almost as if they could touch into my soul even when I was standing a good distance away from the counter while pouring some form of light  brown alcohol what I could only assume was either bourbon or whiskey could be whiskey which flowed into a  small glass cup he reached from inside the counter. As he took a shot of it  then after he was done with the first one he took a couple of shots stopping nearly halfway and putting the glass cup down then  as he finished licking the excess alcohol content off from  his chaps  he begins to speak

“Only thing I  could tell ya in some order  for you to leave on your way  with   some form of an answer towards is that they  who dare go down that stretch of road has they have not heard the light of day from they end up disappearing, vanishing  seemly gone into thin air   never to be seen again as if they never existed or they just evaporated as  if they was water in the hot sun and as for me  well    I been here most days   in  my many years  of working, maintaining and   full-fledged running the store  itself I’ ve has seen the  countless amount of innocent faces of young people like yourself  and people in general with full level  of potential, energy, and spirit   overall that existed  only  long  enough  just to be overtaken by the leaves which fall   from the sky above seen no more  only one and last time except for you you are the first one I have seen to ever  survived the  wicked phenomenon.  

Well Maybe as  all this time had passed by so is the endless amount of victims of it  it is hope after all on that stretch of road… now take care  of yourself Youngblood yeah I will  hope you do the same  I    
walked out  of the store then began  pumping the car with gas 

As I was coming pretty close to being  done filling up  just eight seven six something dollars remain  on the pump  as I continue I began to feel   the sudden  breeze which the wind began blowing  becoming  stronger along with……leaves  then a near dozen  right at the front of my view  as they became more of the sound from  slight  howling  wind. 

Suddenly it was the crashing sound coming from the station’s sign across the lot  if as something was blown over  what was that I said in response to the noise I saw some of the metal pieces from the station's sign which is mounted into  the ground skid across the parking lot as if it was toss 

As this occurred, the middle-aged man was hurling toward my direction running from the store to my car as if he was a speeding Mack faster than I would ever expect from him. “Young fellow, we must hurry NOW!”    "get in with me get in then  I said while shaken because how anxious I was   I hopped into my car with now the middle-aged man now right across from  not knowing where I should head off to but where to go now I pleaded to the man  response  GO NOW GO!!!!  I  shifted the car into drive and then floored the car milliseconds afterward that way go that way on your right !!! The middle-aged man ordered turns out it was a road that run alongside the lot of the store  I spin onto it and floored which car was nearly in the air for a couple of seconds   I see what is behind me in the rearview mirror was something would not forget anytime in the near future a tall behemoth at least fourteen to sixteen feet in height from the distance to even close to twenty-four feet to have a closer accurate at the most it appeared with light gray skin while imbodied  with leaves  which attacted to the  upper legs, forearms which on the nd of themm had these long claws which I could see in thanks to my rearview lights  the leaves  cover a good portion of this thing’s torso.  On top its body  was sported with a large but bony head and flat face  just to point out some   details of the thing. 

I continue while this   entity made seemly from nothing but  leaves, and  pure rage    kept up with the car  despite me going nearly seventy miles per hour and this thing was at least eighteen to twenty feet from my car I did something that I'll never forget I slammed on brakes five seconds before turning  on  the road towards the left side of me then thunder up with the behemoth on my tail I'm at least thirty feet away from it so I floored it going past eighty miles per hour which I could tell the flying dust of the road was making it hard for it to see since I could hear a slight beastly  grunt  as a boom if it had fallen onto the road  from it  but I was nit going to slow down till I was far gone from it  keeping the driving speed nearly the same as  we continued up this road  then made a left turn  which took us to a more urban area leading in some community like town  just to have a slight rest I parked on slide of the road the middle aged man and I exchange the look of what the world happened back there but we prevailed on

"Youngblood,Drop me here  he asked  me  to "Were you going, why you had me drive you here?"

 "To stand as a  guide  for people like youself  out from that ratchet creature  and  that bloody phenomeon  I saw it began to come up from the road  coming towards the gas station  so I must stay behind to warn anymore like yourself ,  I’ve had my days,  more days   that trail behind  me while  yourself have a potential future of quite a greatness  you now go about your way the middle-aged man stated to me with a slight smile running across  his face  he shut the passenger door with the word final words" Farewell" I pick up something drink the accommodate me to help ease my nerves  after fifteen minutes   I  founded a  highway that will lead  the way  back home the next day I after I realized that somehow the car’s  gas line had this cut in it as a knife went through it  or even then end of a car.

Due to all that had to happen, I decided to take a  couple of weeks off   to  have repairs done to  my car, other errands I needed to do, and overall  reset my mind  from what happened enough to function as an individual  with no issues  going further down the line. but I still wonder a few things 

First  did that creature was the one dragging me along with it 

Second  since I needed to fill up on gas two times  I wonder  was my gas line was leaking  when I've had the struggle to  pull myself from the leaves  and if  it became a give-away for  the  creature somehow found me from a trail of dripping gas  despite it  being  dark  then a sense of smell of that thing hunting  me is off the charts as it was charge behind us at least fifty -five mph at bare minium 

Third and finally the middle-aged man. He had  requested  for me to drop his right side of the road it is a thought which lingers throughout the day did he move on trying to find something better did he made it or did he found  a way to go back to that store he been running for years  and unless I was to travel back down which I highly doubt so anytime soon and if I do that if so  I might consider updating on  that into a new  post speaking of the post I’ll finish this one off since  my battery is near   nine percent  and  after my Moto 6 is finish uploading the post it would make it drop  close to dead with this  

my message to all is this if you go anyway especially during the night make sure that you know where you're heading off towards where it’s in the daytime, especially at night and most importantly t oof all If you see the leaves begin to fall and turn the opposite way as fast you possibly can.
