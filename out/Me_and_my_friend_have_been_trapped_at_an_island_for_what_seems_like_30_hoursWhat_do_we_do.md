it all started about 1 day ago.Me And my friend Boarded a boat which led to a So called: "Very expensive Island".We got the ticket by scrolling trough giveaway Websites.The Website was so called:"Mary's Boat Anniversary."

When you entered the website.There would be alot of flashing lights.And Pictures of boats and a young Girl.

We entered the giveaway.About 2 hours later we got a notification.

"YOU ARE ONE LUCKY GROUP!YOU WON A FREE TICKET FOR 3.THE TICKET GOES TO ISLAND ASTOMORE"

I think that was the name.Island astomore.

Anyways.We were happy.We packed our bags and drove to the dock.When we arrived.The same young girl was there.Greeting us and Saying "Are you Tom And Andrew".How did she know our names?

Anyways.We didnt think much of it.Altough we were a bit worried.The voice was a bit off.It just needed That Human touch.We boarded the boat and got on.We were both on our phones.Scrolling.Showing weird and funny videos.It's been an hour or 2 of driving. The driver was Super quiet.I saw the boat had One of those Roof Carpet things that you unfold if it starts raining.Well.A thunderstorm started.Rain was flowing everywhere.I asked the driver if he can roll down the Roof.He banged a button on the Command prompt and it unfolded.Around a few minutes later.he unfolded it to the sun going down.

We arrived at around Midnight.We got on the island.The driver and boat was supposed to be with us.But they drove off Faster than they were driving us here.I got scared and yelled for the driver.But He ignored me.The island was empty.Nothing being there.We found a lighter on the Beach.It seemed Just like new.We found some paper and trash and put it on a stick.We made two torches.We Walked around the what seemed endless island.We heard a noise in the bushes.we took a rock and looked around for anything.something jumped on my friend.It looked oddly familiar?.It Looked Like the Same "Mary".The Young woman that was there to greet us.She looked different however.

She had a Long Mouth.With What seemed like a million teeth inside.He fought her off and punched her with a rock in the eyes.The eyes were huge.She started bleeding.When we got closer with the torch.The bleeding was some sort of Unnamed Color?.we checked our phones after that.It was the same time as When we Got on the island.00:04.We Found some Fish in the Sea around us.when we caught some.And cooked them.What both combined seemed like an hour.It was still: 00:04.

We thought about Sleeping.But we remembered the Mutated Mary.So we didn't.We played some games .With what wood we had we made a campfire and a small camp.It consisted of two small wood Camp Cabins.Kinda like what you see In an Edd Stafford Episode.We hid in there.WE took off our clothes and Widened them To a point where it was like a door.we put that as doors on our "cabins".

Anyways.there were some parrots there.We tried to tame them.But nothing.Our lives flashed as we saw a boat in the distance.We yelled.Threw torches.Jumped.But the boat thought we were greeting him.So it drove off.We are currently grieving How we ruined our only chance.

I will update all of you when Something more happens.
