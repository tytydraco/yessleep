Hello everyone. 
My name’s Mark, I am in high school, I’m 16, and as the title says, my dreams are starting to get out of control. 
I’ve always been a big dreamer. I don’t mean someone who has a lot of dreams in his life, I mean that when I sleep, I dream almost every night, and I can usually remember those dreams very strongly. 
I like it. It’s always been something I enjoyed. It’s like a world where I can relax after a long day of school or something else. I’m not always in control in my dreams, and when I am, it’s only of my own actions, I don’t have lucid dreams, I have no control of the environment or the characters. 
But lately, let’s just say that things started to get a bit, weird…

Last night, as always, I was dreaming. It was just like a simple day of school, with the occasional anomalies that all dreams have. I was talking with some actual friends that I have in real life, some characters that were not real, nothing weird. Then I saw this girl in the hallway. She was so pretty, like, exactly my type. She was talking with some other girls that I didn’t recognize from real life. One thing was sure, this girl was created for this dream, I would have recognized her. 
Usually, I’m pretty shy around girls, but it was a dream, so, my confidence was high. I decided that I should just go talk to her, what could happen?

I went to her and she turned to me. I introduced myself, and she smiled and introduced herself. Her name was Marion, which is very cute if you ask me.  I don’t exactly remember what we talked about, just that she seemed into it. “That’s the kind of dream I want to have more often!” I thought. 

Eventually, my confidence being at an all-time high (it’s easier when everything is over once you wake up) , I approached my hand to try to fix her hair (I was having a lot of fun). And that’s when thing started to get weird. My hand touched her face and suddenly, everyone around us disappeared, and it felt like we were in, like, the middle of a hurricane. I started trying to take my hand off of her face, but it’s like it was stuck. The hurricane got harder and harder as I was panicking. This is actually when I looked at her face. For some reason, she seemed as frightened as I was by what was happening. Our eyes locked as the feelings of being swallowed by a tornado was getting harder and harder. She was looking at me with a terrified face. 
-	“What’s happening Mark?” she said.
-	“I don’t know!” I almost screamed.
-	“Mark, whatever is happening, stop it now”
-	“I don’t know how !” 
And I woke up. 

I was sweaty. It was like I was coming out of a shower or something, and my heart was beating strong.

My first thought was “That was weird”. I didn’t really know what happened, so I just tried to sleep again. I had to wake up 2 hours later, so, I better get some sleep. I couldn’t.
My mind was too agitated. I was just lying in bed, eyes wide open. I never had a dream this intense, things felt too real. I hoped that it wasn’t always going to be like this from now on, because those dreams had become my safe place, I didn’t want to lose it.
Eventually, 2 hours later, my alarm started. I immediately turned it off and got out of bed. 

It was a morning like any other. Nothing felt much different. I took a breakfast, and I went to school. While I was walking to school though, my stomach was hurting, and it felt, like my brain was heavy, if that makes sense. 
I arrived at school, found my friends, chatted a bit about random stuff, and we eventually went to class. Everyone sat at their usual place and the class started. Everything was going good, my stomach pain was fading away, probably because my brain was trying to make me focus on the lesson.

And then someone knocked. The principal of the school entered and asked the teacher if he could interrupt for a second. He walked to place himself in front of us, and, yes, you guessed it, she was behind him. Marion was there. She was following him. The principal introduced her as our new classmate and I just didn’t listen to him. I was just, seating here, looking at her, in pure shock. I was staring at her face. She looked stressed, embarrassed even, she wasn’t as comfortable as she was in my dream.
Eventually, we made eye contact. Usually, I would have look away immediately, but not there. I just kept staring. When she saw me, she had a slight look of, surprise, or relief, I don’t really know how to qualify it. 

After some time, the principal finished his speech and Marion went to seat besides some girls, on my left. I tried to follow the class, but I just kept on looking at her again. She gave me a few glances too, looking more concerned now.

The rest of the day was pretty much the same: me trying to behaving normally, while trying to make sense of Marion’s presence in my dream.

At the end of the day, I took my usual way to go home. After a few minutes of walking, I noticed her. Marion was on the same street, just a few meters ahead of me. I hesitated a bit, but choose to go to her, to introduce myself the more casually I could. She saw me, and this is how our conversation went…

“Hello, hum, so, your name is Marion?I’m in your class if you remember.” I said, trying to sound somewhat normal.

“Yes Mark, I know who you are!”. Her answer was extremely fast. Her tone was tense and almost annoyed.

“What do you mean? You know me?” I was trying to sound amused, but really, I was confused.

“Mark! Can you stop playing whatever you’re playing please?” She sounded even more annoyed, but I could see in her eyes that she was also scared.

“Do you, remember,… this night?” I tried to not sound weird in case I was misinterpretating the situation. 

“Well yes! Mark! Can you explain me what the fuck you did?”

“You dreamt of it too?”

“Huh, no Mark, you were the one dreaming,  I was just there.”

“What do you mean ?!! I don’t understand a word you’re saying!!” Her stressed and angry tone was starting to influence mine.

“Mark, I’m not real here! I shouldn’t be here, something is wrong  I thought you knew”

“What do you mean you’re not real, the principal introduced you!”

“Well, yes, right now I’m here, and I have no clue why. You think I actually know where I’m going right now? I just took this street by instinct, I have no home.”

“what, wait, I don’t…”

She grabbed my hand and took me to seat on a bench that we were passing by. She explained more

“Look, listen to me okay? Last night, I was in your dream, again, it’s been a while now, I haven’t counted. I was doing my thing, as usual, talking, waiting for your dream to be over. But then, you came to me, and you did, whatever you call what you were doing, and you touched my hair. Then, as you probably remember, it was a mess. After that, you probably woke up. But me, instead of blacking out as always, I was just here  in this street. I saw the school and went there because I recognized it from your dreams. The principal welcomed me, saying that I had to fill a few documents before taking me to my new class. I didn’t understand anything so I just played along. Later, he brought me to your class, and that’s where we saw each other. I thought you knew what you happened, but it seems like you don’t.”

“Hum, no… I don’t”

“Great…” she sighed

We stayed silent a moment, I was trying to process the insane things she told me. Then I thought about something. 

“Do you, huh, have somewhere to sleep?” I asked

“Well what do you think? No, I don’t even have a home. I was kinda counting on you for that”

“Sorry,  what? I can’t take you at my place, how do I explain this to my parents?” I answered

“Well, don’t you think that’s the least you could do? I’m here because of you, and I don’t really want to sleep in the street, if you can understand?” she started getting annoyed again.

“Fine, fine. I’ll get you in my room, …by the window, okay? You’ll stay in my room and we’ll figure it out then.”

She stayed silent for a few seconds

“Okay, sorry for getting angry, I’m just scared. Thank you, that’s kind.” Her tone was way softer suddenly. 

“Well, follow me then”

We walked to my place remaining mostly silent. When we get there, she waited outside, I entered and got her in my room. I brought her some food, she said that she never ate, that she didn’t need it. I asked her if she felt some feeling of emptiness in her stomach, and she seemed amazed that I “guessed” it, which I found amusing. I told her that she was just hungry and had to eat.

I had to leave her alone to go eat diner with my family. It was lasagna, which I love so, nice. When diner was finished, my dad sat in front of the TV. He was watching some history channel that didn’t interest me in any way. I was eating my dessert and watching it. The episode was talking about an old family that was massacred by an old crazy man at the time, something in the late 1800’s, I wasn’t paying that much attention. Then they showed the faces of the family. And there she was again. Marion. She was here, on screen. Apparently the oldest child of this family. They entered in big details about her rape/murder at only 18 years old. So much that I had to leave the room to get to my bedroom.

I entered and looked at her, she was seating on a chair, looking at my bookshelf, and I just didn’t know what to say to her. 

So, I just told her that I would ask help online. 
I’m posting this in hope that someone has some idea of what we could do, because I have no clue what is happening. 

You can ask questions to me or to Marion, I’ll give you her answers. In case, I haven’t told her about what I saw on TV. 

I’ll keep you up.
