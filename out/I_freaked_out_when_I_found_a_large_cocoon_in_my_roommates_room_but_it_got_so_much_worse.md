So me (m24) my girlfriend, Ashley (F23) and our cat Mister whiskers moved into a new apartment last month.

We found an ad on Facebook posted by this guy we'll call 'Jeremy' looking for a new roommate. We met up and he seemed like a great guy. But his hobbies were weird.

He had this massive bug collection. Millipedes, moths, centipedes, tarantulas. Hell, even a roach colony. (I kept that last one a secret from Ashley because I *knew* she would never agree to move in if she saw it.) Fortunately, he keeps them all in his room. Out of sight, out of mind and all that.

I got home from work and the first thing I noticed when I walked in the door (besides the stench) was the massive pile of dishes in the sink. This was a huge piss-off because Jeremy swore up and down the night before that he would do them today. We're all in charge of our own dishes and I could see even from where I was standing that some of them were beginning to mold.

Unfortunately for me, we keep the febreze under the sink. Covering my nose with my shirt in a sad attempt to protect myself from the obnoxious odor; I approached the sink when I saw the mold move.

I quickly backed up when I realized it wasn't actually mold. It was worse, it looked like a roach from Jeremy's colony.

I forgot about the dishes and walked up to Jeremy's door to confront him when I noticed the door was ajar. I pushed it open and had to double-take at the bed.

in front of me on the bare mattress was what looked like a giant cocoon. I also noticed a few of Jeremy's bug enclosures had been knocked over (including the roaches) and decided to close the door and wait for Ashley to get home to investigate further.

I was busy tidying our room, making sure there were no creepy crawlers in the bed, when I heard the front door open followed by an exasperated "what the fuuuuck?!".

I walked out to fill Ashley in on the cocoon situation, but she wouldn't listen to me.

"The dishes?? Again?! I'm going to cut this guy a new piss-slit" Ashley said, storming towards Jeremy's room. I tried to get her to stop but she barged right in.

"What the hell is this? His fuck-mummy??"

"I don't know, I found this just before you got home."

Ashley walked around the bed and found a giant cardboard box full of packing peanuts.

"Looks like another one of his pets, I can't live like this anymore" she groaned.

"But why is it so big? Where is he planning on keeping this?"

I took a look at the box. It was big, but I didn't think it was big enough to ship whatever was in this cocoon.

"I'm cutting it open" Ashley declared.

"Don't, I don't want to find out what half-formed monstrosity is inside this thing. Let's wait for Jeremy to get home to explain himself" I begged.

Reluctantly, Ashley agreed. We decided to go out for dinner and spend the night at a motel down the street. Unfortunately it wasn't pet friendly so we had to leave Mister whiskers locked in our room at home.

We got back to the apartment around lunch the next day and something felt wrong as soon as we opened the door. I saw what looked like shreds of the cocoon around the floor of the living room. I gingerly picked a piece up and one side was covered in a thick slime that burned my hand when I touched it.

I ran over to the sink to wash it off my hand when I heard Ashley scream from our bedroom. I sprinted in to see her pointing at a smaller cocoon on the bed.

"I think that's Mister whiskers in there!" She sobbed. It dawned on me what was going on. It wasn't a cocoon in Jeremy's room. It was Jeremy.

I grabbed the largest knife from the drawer in the kitchen and slowly crept towards Jeremy's room, handle down like Michael Myers, ready to impale anything that might be waiting for me.

I pushed the door open and wasn't ready for what I saw.

The cocoon was shredded open and the liquified remains of Jeremy were on display. Everything on his bones had turned to a sort of transparent jell-o. Then from behind him on the bed, the biggest, hairiest pair of spider legs began to creep up. The thing was the size large dog, it bowed down and began to slurp Jeremy up until it noticed me.

I could barley blink before it threw itself into the door, knocking me over and landing on my chest. It's prickly legs stabbed into my arms and held me down as a gooey substance leaked off its fangs and sizzled on my neck. I was about to cry out when Ashley raced over and began whacking the thing on the back with a bat we kept by our nightstand.

The thing was unfazed. The bat was bouncing off of its thick exoskeleton and its fangs were about an inch away from my face when Ashley hit it in the eyes and it sprang up at her.

Still clutching the knife, I jumped on the things back and drove the tip into the things mouth. It bucked like a horse, throwing me off and retreating into Jeremy's room.

I tried to pick Ashley up off the floor who was dry heaving. "Did you see that? It shit something into my throat".

We're in the ER now and Ashley just got an x-ray. The doctor said it looks like a swelling bag of ping-pong balls. I'm too scared to let Ashley know that thing probably slipped an egg sac down her throat. I don't know a lot about arachnids, but I DO know tarantulas don't lay eggs in their prey. But this thing couldn't have been a tarantula.

I called the police to check out the apartment, but besides the remains of Jeremy, they couldn't find a thing.

To make things worse, the doctor told me there's no way he can remove the egg sac. So Ashley has no choice but to hope it passes. Or we'll find out what that thing was if the eggs hatch inside her.
