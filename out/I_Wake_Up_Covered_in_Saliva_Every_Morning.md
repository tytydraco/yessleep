Every single day for the past nine days I have woken up covered in saliva. No, not like I had drooled on myself. A thick layer of saliva coated every inch of my body so that even when I opened my eyelids, strings of spit stretched out in front of my eyes. I didn't realize what it was at first. I thought I must have pissed myself or maybe been sweating but the smell soon hit me. Spit normally smells something like watered down vomit and I was getting there was also subtle undertones of rotten food, sort of like trash that's been sitting in the sun.

After inspecting my body I became certain of the identity of this substance when I noticed the bubbles which seemed to congregate across the smooth surface of my skin. My first thought was that someone must have been licking me in my sleep. Nobody I knew would do, or even could do that because I always make sure the door of my apartment is locked. Nobody, that it, except my roommate. I jumped out of bed and put my house slippers on, the hardwood floors were cold, and stormed into the other bedroom. As the door swung open I was initially taken aback by how orderly the room was before I remembered that I didn't have a roommate and this was simply a guest room. I'd always had a roommate but when I moved to this apartment I decided I wanted to live alone.

I began to stroll about the apartment, thinking about what had happened before I realized I was tracking the saliva all across the place. As I began heading towards the bathroom I began feeling a stinging sensation on my skin, kind of like when you put a piece of pineapple on your arm. I did believe briefly that this could be a sort of bio weapon that was being tested on me but then I realized once again that it was probably just saliva because saliva because I remembered that I had once read somewhere that saliva has dissolving properties that scientists think is to help with food digestion. I hopped in the shower and pondered what had happened. Maybe it was possible that I drooled on myself. Maybe this is just sweat and I have some sort of disease that changes how you sweat. Either way, I had work starting in an hour and I needed to be there on time.

As I went to sleep that night I was worried that whatever happened might happen again. I decided that since you start drooling when you smell something good, like fresh bread baking, if you smelled something bad it would work in the opposite way. I decided to light a scent of candle that I did not like so that incase I was drooling on myself I hopefully wouldn't. I looked around before remembering that I have never once in my life purchased a candle. I decided the next best option was to turn my oven on to 450 degrees and put a piece of trash in it. I rummaged through my trashcan like a raccoon and found an empty cartoon of eggs in it. I found that weird because I don't like eggs and also cannot afford them. Anyway, I decided to put it in the oven.

When I woke up I was once again covered in saliva. I was upset that my plan did not work. I got out of bed, put my house slippers on, and headed straight to the bathroom this time. I washed up then headed out to the kitchen to turn the oven off. As I entered, I was surprised that I couldn't smell the aroma of burning trash. As I approached the oven I noticed that it was turned off. That was surprising because I was pretty sure I turned it on. That meant one of three things 1) I didn't turn it on, 2) It turned itself off, or 3) Someone else turned it off. I found the first option unlikely because I am a pretty reliable person and I found the idea of someone else turning it off weird because, like I stated, I don't have a roommate. That meant that the oven must have turned itself off. That made sense because I have noticed a lot of my appliances tend to act like they have a mind of their owned. I don't like it but I guess sometimes dishwashers like their private time.

On the third night I had no plan. I thought maybe if I stopped worrying about it it would be fine. That's when the dreams started. The dream took place in my bedroom. I was sat on my bed but there was this bug like thing on the ceiling. It may have been an insect but it was about the size of linebacker and I've never seen an insect that big. I also don't know what the difference between a bug and an insect is. Regardless, this dream was strange. It was kind of like that sleep paralysis thing that some people say happens. I could see my room and everything was as it is in the real world. Normally in a dream, things don't make sense but you believe they are happening anyway. This dream was different. I knew it wasn't happening but every single thing, save the creature, made sense. That's where my dream ended. Normally my dreams have a cool story but this one ended abruptly so upon recalling it when I woke up, I was disappointed. I was also disappointed to find thick saliva coated every crack and crevice of my body.

  
I got up, put on my house slippers, and did my little shower routine(I'm getting pretty good at it). After that I decided to look up the properties of saliva to see if it is possible that somehow it could come out of my skin. As I typed in "sal-" a recent search popped up for "salvia" which, when I clicked it, was just some kind of plant. That threw me off. Not only was I not the one who searched that, whoever did misspelled saliva. That meant somebody broke into my apartment to use my computer. The misspelling also made me think there might be something wrong with this person. You know, mentally. Although I believe in equal access to the internet, the idea of somebody coming into my apartment without asking did make me slightly uncomfortable. To stop this I started setting my PC to shutdown instead of sleep when I hit the power button. Hopefully that would deter anybody who is trying to use it without permission.

That is pretty much how the next few days went. Go to sleep, dream about bug man, wake up soaked. That was until day six. My dream that night was different. This one was weird. Instead of dreaming about some kind of bug man, I was in a dark, wet place with pink walls. I'm a pretty fit guy but trust me, this place was cramped. I tried to reach out and touch the wall but I couldn't move my body at all. That made sense when I realized this was a dream. The walls around me started moving and I noticed something written on the walls in red paint. It was the number six. The number repeated over and over as the walls shifted around me. They read "666". Well, technically it was more sixes but I figured there was a high probability the devil had something to do with this so it was probably intended to be read as 666. I thought I might be in hell but figured otherwise. I felt like there would probably be fire if this was hell. I also normally behave so I was doubtful I would get sent to hell. That's when I woke up, in my bed covered in saliva.

By this point I had begun sleeping in my house slippers so that could save time in the mornings. I usually like to lay in my bed for a while (because my toes get cold while I sleep) but it's hard to be comfy when your soaked in someone else's spit. At this point, I figured I might just have to live with it. In life, sometimes people get addicted to drugs, sometimes they get pancreatic cancer, and other times they get hit by cars. Sometimes that's just life and you have to deal with it. That's what I planned to do about my little saliva situation as I like to call it. Of all the curses you could be plagued with, this one wasn't too bad.

  
I was only content with it for 3 more days. On the ninth night of this, I had a dream unlike any other. This time, the bug man was sitting on my bed. He would count to ten and then back down to one and he would repeat that over and over. I found this weird for two reasons, 1) bugs normally are not able to talk, and 2) the voice sounded familiar. This dream also lasted the longest of them all. It felt like hours that I was in bed with the bug man. I was tired of hearing him drone on and on with his numbers but eventually he said something interesting. He said "You are almost ready. Dinner will be soon". That's when I woke up. I felt uncomfortable about this because "dinner will be soon" is something my mom would say I lot as a child and I felt uncomfortable with associating her with the bug man. I knew she couldn't be the bug man because the bug man's voice was clearly a man's and my mom is a woman. As I pondered over this dream further, I realized the counting probably had some significance. I think something bad will happen on the 10th night when I go to sleep. It might be some sort of completion of a ritual he's doing on me. The saliva could be part of it. I cannot let this be completed. Am I just being paranoid? Any help is appreciated.
