Let me get one thing out of the way: I didn’t start drinking because of the hauntings. I was already halfway to pickled before the spirits around here decided I was their unofficial customer service desk.

See, when you’re the only sheriff for miles, everything that goes bump in the night ends up dumped in your lap. 

Flickering lights in the cemetery? My problem. Screaming coming from the old mill? My problem. Kid swears there’s a floating man in her closet? Definitely my problem, because apparently no one else around here wants to admit that our town is… wrong.

And before anyone asks: no, I don’t arrest ghosts. Can’t cuff smoke. Can’t threaten something that phases through your cruiser door. Mostly I just show up, mutter “not again,” and try to look like I’m not about to soil myself while whatever-it-is sizes me up.

But the thing is—

even when I leave, it never really stays behind.

So, yeah. I’m the sheriff. And these are the stories I finally started writing down, mostly because I ran out of whiskey and I need something to do until the store opens in the morning.

———

The first time I realized this town was fucked was a Tuesday morning, which somehow makes it worse. 

Bad things belong to nighttime, or thunderstorms, or at least the weekends. Tuesday morning is for coffee and pretending like I’m about to fill out last month’s paperwork.

Instead, Dispatch calls and says there’s “a noise complaint that sounds… a little weird.” That’s dispatcher-speak for sheriff, it’s your turn to traumatize yourself again.

So I drive over to this run-down apartment block squeezed behind a half-functioning gas station. The kind of place where you’re never sure if the walls are water-damaged or just… stained by life. 

When I got there, he opened the door like he’d been pacing behind it for hours, eyes wide, hair sticking up like he’d been electrocuted by his own anxiety. 

“Sheriff. Thank God. Please come in.”

“I mean, you called,” I said. “Would’ve been rude if I didn’t.”

He stepped aside, wringing his hands like he wasn’t sure if he should offer me coffee or a will to sign. “I—I’m not crazy. Just so you know that upfront.”

“Good start,” I said. “Everybody who says that always turns out completely sane. Never once gone wrong.”

He didn’t laugh. I didn’t expect him to. He pointed toward the hallway. “It started last night. Thumping in the back room. Like footsteps. Slow ones.”

“Footsteps in the middle of the night; ghost rush hour.”

He frowned. “I’m serious.”

“So am I. That’s when everything weird happens.” I brushed past him and started down the hall, slow enough that he could keep up. “Alright. Tell me exactly what you heard.”

“Just… walking. And the door to that room keeps opening. I know I closed it. I heard the latch catch.”

“Could be a draft,” I said.

“No,” he said, sharp enough to echo. “I checked the windows. Everything’s shut.”

“Okay,” I said. “Faulty hinges, then. Happens.”

“It doesn’t explain the whispering.”

I stopped mid-step. “Whispering?”

“Yes. Like two people talking, but… not words I know.” He swallowed and lowered his voice. “I thought maybe it was the neighbors, but they’re out of town.”

“Alright,” I said, trying to sound like a man who definitely hadn’t dealt with far worse. “So you didn’t recognize the language.”

“No. It didn’t even sound like a language. More like…” He hesitated. “Like something trying to figure out how to talk.”

I pinched the bridge of my nose. “That’s great. Love that for us.”

He hovered behind me. “You’re not taking me seriously.”

“I am,” I said. “It’s just that the last time someone told me their house was talking to them, it turned out they were sleeping next to a raccoon in the vents.”

“There are no raccoons here.”

“Glad you checked. Saves me time.”

We reached the back room door. He nudged it with two fingers like it might bite him. “It opened on its own five times last night.”

“Locked?”

“Yes. And before you ask, I wasn’t sleepwalking. I don’t do that.”

“Okay,” I said. “I wasn’t going to accuse you. But if you want me to put it in the report, I can. Makes you sound more interesting.”

He let out a shaky laugh. “Please don’t.”

“Fair enough.” I tried the handle. It didn’t move. Solid lock. “Alright. I’ll open it. If something jumps out, try not to scream louder than me.”

He gave me a look that said he was only eighty percent sure I was joking.

I opened the door. Nothing happened. No draft, no movement, just that heavy stillness old houses get when they’re holding their breath.

He whispered, “See? It wasn’t like this before.”

“Yeah,” I said. “Spooky silence is a new feature.”

He hovered behind me again. “So… what does this mean?”

“It means,” I said, stepping in and looking around, “that I’ll check everything first—locks, windows, floorboards. And if nothing explains it, we’ll chalk it up to the usual.”

“The usual?”

“Yeah. You know.” I nudged a warped floorboard with my boot. “Weird house noises, ghosts, existential dread. Same category on the paperwork.”

“And if something actually is in here?”

“Then we escalate to Phase Two.”

“There’s a Phase Two?”

“Oh yeah,” I said. “Phase Two is where I call someone who gets paid more than me to deal with things that whisper in unknown languages.”

He exhaled shakily. “I’m charging the county if something drags me into a wall.”

“That’s fine,” I said. “But if something drags me into a wall, you’re paying for medical bills.

He points me to Apartment 3B. Says the tenant “left in a hurry.” He means abandoned—fled—ran so fast he probably didn’t even lock the door. 

I go up. The door isn’t just unlocked—it’s open a crack, like someone couldn’t be bothered to shut it fully. I announce myself, push it open, and step inside.

The air hits me first. Thick. Heavy. Wet, like breathing through damp wool. The lights flicker even though no one touched the switch.

Apartment’s empty, but in a way that feels wrong. Not lived-in empty—stripped empty. One mattress leaning against a wall. No clothes. No dishes. A single shoe in the middle of the living room, pointed toward the bathroom like someone lost it while running.

I hear the dragging sound before I even reach the hallway.

Wet, slow, deliberate.

Like something pulling a soaked tarp across tile.
I draw my flashlight, announce myself again, and—because I really should’ve become a plumber instead of a sheriff—I push open the bathroom door.

There’s a man standing in the shower with his back to me.

He’s not doing anything—not washing, not shifting his weight, not even pretending he belongs there. 

He’s just planted in the middle of the tub like someone dropped him in and forgot about him. His skin has that drained, over-laundered look bodies get after being pulled out of a river, pale enough that the overhead light makes him seem less like a person and more like the idea of one.

I ask if he’s okay. It comes out steady, the same tone I use for traffic stops and drunk uncles at Thanksgiving, but the air hits the back of my neck in a way that tells me I should probably wish I’d brought backup.

He doesn’t react. Doesn’t turn. Doesn’t even hitch a breath.

The closer I get, the colder the room gets—an old, rotting kind of cold that doesn’t just sit in the tiles but sinks under your skin, settles against your bones, and starts taking inventory of you. It’s the kind of cold that makes you feel like something small and patient is listening for your next move.

“Sir,” I say, because that’s what the handbook insists I say when dealing with unresponsive individuals, “I’m going to need you to turn around.”

What he does isn’t turning.

He twitches. A single, sharp convulsion, like someone pulled a wire inside him. And then the motion travels through his whole body—a ripple, a shudder—nothing natural, nothing that belongs in a human frame. It’s the kind of movement that makes you realize there’s a wrong way for bones to shift even if you’ve never seen it before.

A noise crawls out of his throat. Wet. Thick. Not a word. Not a breath. More like he’s trying to remember how to be a person and failing the test.

I take a step forward, more out of training than bravery. The tile clicks under my boot, and it’s like the sound gives whatever’s inside him an instruction.

His knees buckle.

No flinch, no brace, no instinct to save himself. He just drops—straight down, like somebody cut the strings.

And the whole time, the only thing I can think is that nothing about the way he fell looked accidental. It looked practiced.

Like he’d done it before.

By the time the paramedics arrive, I’ve already given them the rundown and stepped out of the bathroom. 

They take one look at the guy in the tub and go quiet in that professional way that means they don’t have a box for this on their forms either. I let them work. I’ve seen enough.

I get the landlord to sign the incident report—he’s shaking so hard the pen taps the paper like Morse code—and I give him the usual speech about staying somewhere else for the night, locking his door, maybe getting a hobby that doesn’t involve living next to strange apparitions.

He nods through all of it like he’s signing a treaty he never agreed to draft.

I step outside into the thick evening air, and for a second, the silence feels wrong. Not dangerous. Just… expectant. Like the house is waiting to see if I’ll come back.

I won’t even think about it.

I get into my cruiser, shut the door, and let the engine hum fill the space in my head where panic would normally go for other people. I check the mirrors out of habit, and the rearview stares back at me with too much empty road. I tilt it down, away from the backseat. I don’t need the universe taking that as an invitation.

The radio chirps, asking if I need backup or if I’m returning to station. I say I’m fine. I always say I’m fine. It’s muscle memory at this point, like buckling my seatbelt or ignoring the shadows that move where shadows shouldn’t.

On the drive home, every streetlight feels a little too dim, a little too far apart. My headlights carve out the road in slices, and in the dead air between them, I keep thinking I see someone standing in the next patch of dark.

Never do. Most likely never will.

But I keep the mirror angled down anyway.

No sense checking if something decides to hitch a ride. Not tonight. Not after seeing a man fall like a puppet that remembered it didn’t have strings.

I pull into my driveway, kill the engine, and wait a moment before getting out, letting the quiet settle. 

My house looks the same as always—dark, a little lopsided, and blessedly empty.

I step inside, lock the door behind me, and tell myself I’ll sleep just fine.

I won’t.

But I’ll try.
