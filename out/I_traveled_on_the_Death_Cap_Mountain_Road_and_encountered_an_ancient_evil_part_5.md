Every year thousands of people go missing in the USA. Most of them are found, alive or dead, but sometimes people just vanish into thin air. I wondered how many of them were taken by the Death Cap Mountain Road. I wondered where they had taken the children in cages in the butcher shop from, whether Mara sent his monks or monstrosities out of the connections to our world to grab innocents and return, having new bodies to feed these demonic abominations and new souls to draw into himself.

Naomi and I awoke in the corner of the main chamber of the castle, having fallen asleep from pure exhaustion after seeing Max brutally murdered and dragged off by a tow truck. I looked out the window and saw near total darkness outside. Yet further down the road, I could make out the flickering of fires where the direction of the town full of cannibals lay. I squinted my eyes, looking closer at the horrific sight that lay ahead of me. The white bodies of the crab-walking women, their grins splitting their skin wide open from ear to ear and their milky eyes staring forever up in bestial incomprehension, formed a perfect symmetrical circle around the fire. In the middle of the circle, a massive thin beast covered with leathery, black skin roasted Max’s body over the fire. I saw Max’s clothes catch fire, his eyes starting to melt out of his skull as his skin roasted. Even from over here, I could smell the aroma of burning meat, almost like the smell of pork roasted over a fire. It made me gag. 

The creature holding him had a jaw that unhinged down to its chest, like a snake about to swallow a creature much bigger than itself. Its leathery skin clung to every bone of his fifteen-foot tall body, silvery eyes shining out from an otherwise dark face. Instead of having teeth, it just had one gargantuan rotted tusk, forming a grooved triangular marking the size of a sword. I swear those silvery eyes looked straight up at the castle window where I looked down at it, as if it knew I was watching and wanted me to see what happened to those who fought back against the Road, those who fought back against Mara.

As Max’s body sizzled and his skin blackened over the raging bonfire, the beast holding him reached his long, slender fingers into his body and ripped off pieces of it, tossing them in the air. The crawling women acted like rabid coyotes, biting at each other and snapping the human flesh from the air before it ever got the chance to hit the ground. Within minutes, nothing remained of Max- even his burnt clothes had been totally consumed by the crawling abominations.

I turned to Naomi, who had watched the entire sad scene next to me without saying a word. She had tears running down her house. As I breathed in deep, I felt a massive jolt of energy and began to see white light everywhere. Around Naomi I saw an aura like a rainbow, emanating colors and energy in a shell a few feet around her. I looked down at my hands and saw the same rainbow aura around myself- blues, reds, purples and greens shimmered in intense iridescent layers. Focusing on it, I formed the edges of my aura into a ball in my mind and shot it across the room into a table. I could see the burning white ball of consciousness as it flew at an insane speed across the castle chamber. As soon as it touched the table, there was an intense flash and the wood lit like it had been doused with gasoline and ignited.

Naomi looked at me in puzzled silence.

“Now you try,” I said, pointing to a nightstand at the entrance to the hall. She breathed in deep, closed her eyes and sent a jagged pulse of light across the room. The nightstand exploded, showering us both in tiny shards of wood and leaving little droplets of blood around some of the splinters embedded in our skin. But I was so excited, I didn’t mind.

“Maybe we can kill those things down with this. Maybe we can even kill Mara,” I said. She still had red eyes from crying, but I saw a small smile form on her mouth.

“I want to go home, Jason,” Naomi said to me. I enveloped her in a hug, and she began to cry again, putting her face against my shoulder as we stood there.

“We will,” I said, wiping her tears from her cheek. “This is the last act. Now let’s do what we came here to do.” Walking across the chamber holding hands, we went downstairs and began to remove the makeshift barricade of tables and chairs we had placed against the heavy oak doors after we originally ran in here to escape from the abominations outside.

As we walked out into the dark, a sweet-smelling breeze carried the smells of pine, blowing the sweat off my forehead that had accumulated from my fear and anxiety. My heart raced, I could feel the pressure of it even in my throat, but I still walked forward with my head up, looking all around for threats.

We walked around the castle on the forest edge, eschewing the dirt road entirely for now. That tall creature and those crawling corpse-women were not far away down towards the town and we didn’t want to risk any light giving away our positions.

As we snuck forward, I began to hear voices ahead of me. One of them I recognized as the soft, unemotional voice of Mara, a slight Indian accent marring his otherwise perfect grasp of English.

“You made me a promise,” Mara said softly. “The US government and I came to this agreement nearly half a century ago, during Project MKULTRA, and all your predecessors have upheld their part of their agreement. You supply me with children, and I let you take the occasional monster from the Sacred Forest and the Road I have opened up to you.”

“Yes, sir, I understand,” a soft-spoken, pudgy man said nervously, wringing his hands. “The CIA knows how essential you were to advancing our understanding of cell regeneration and psychic research. Your creatures have given us nothing but knowledge and helped us win the war against our enemies. So I know you are due your wages, but the amount of children you now request from us is likely to draw attention. Only so many children can be kidnapped from the foster systems of the United States before someone starts to realize that they’re vanishing and never being seen again. We have given you hundreds of children, but this new request for a thousand a year is…” He shook his head. “I don’t know if it is within our capabilities. We may be able to supplement our normal quota by kidnapping the children of illegal aliens, but you don’t understand the political atmosphere right now. The ACLU or some nosy reporter will eventually start putting things together if it gets too big…”

“The US government is involved in this thing,” Naomi whispered to me. “How messed up is that? I wonder if they’re the ones who brought those kids in the cages here, to be eaten by the cannibals back in that evil little town of theirs.”

“I think that’s exactly what is going on,” I said, lowering my head. The whole thing made me feel sick to my stomach, and I feared I might vomit right here and draw the attention of the ancient being dressed like a black-clad monk. I wondered if my white light projections could harm Mara, though I had a feeling that my new powers were given to me by the Road- and if the Road truly was maintained entirely by his mind, then he must be far more powerful than I could ever comprehend, less likely to fight back against.

“...I will lead you out,” I heard Mara saying to the CIA bureaucrat, as he motioned him down the Road away from us. I sneaked a peek from behind the castle wall and saw Mara leading the man up the road towards the nearest mountain. The sun had started to rise and showed the fields at the end of the town were totally covered in white mushrooms.

“Do you know what those are?” I asked Naomi, pointing to the mushrooms. She squinted and smiled.

“Yes, I have some memory of mycology books I’ve read. Those are definitely toxic Amanita mushrooms, usually called Death Caps. Some of those in the other patches are probably Dying Angels. They are the two most deadly mushrooms known to humanity, causing an excruciating and slow death from liver failure.”

“There’s so many of them,” I said, awed. The fields stretched out for what seemed like dozens of miles, and were totally covered in Death Caps and Dying Angels as far as the eye could see. “I guess we know where the Road gets its name. These endless fields of poisonous mushrooms.”

“Yes,” Mara said, stepping out from behind the nearest tree, smiling softly at us. He had come around the side of us while we were watching the Road and talking. “The Death Caps were the final part of the rite that helped me create the Road, long before there were cars to drive on them. Two thousand five hundred years have passed since I started out on this path, killed my father by skinning him alive, then burned my mother alive…” He stared far out in the distance, his black eyes looking flat and alien. I couldn’t see much more than a spark of humanity in this figure before me.

“How they cried, how they screamed. I remember my mother’s eyes as she looked at me, dying in agony, betrayed and frightened. That level of psychic energy, well… it is indescribable. More powerful than any drug imaginable. It is like being electrocuted by pure pleasure and power,” Mara said, running his hand over his shaved head.

“When I ate the Death Cap and went into the deepest caverns, I was more powerful than I had ever imagined possible. The mushrooms killed my human form slowly, but the pure consciousness that exited from the top of my head at the moment of death was Deathless, and so luminous. It shone out a light so bright that it punctured holes in reality, and these holes connect this Road I created over the centuries to your changing world to this moment.” I took Naomi’s hand.

“Ready?” I whispered to her. She nodded grimly. We focused all of our energy from our auras into a spear that emanated from our clasped hands and shot at Mara at the speed of light. The light hit him directly in the heart. As he screamed, dozens of monks started to step out from behind all the surrounding trees of the forest. We were totally encircled by Mara and his monks.

The spear that had struck Mara slowly began to cover his skin, crackling and sending off blinding sparks in all directions. It began to sizzle and snap through the air, striking into all of the other monks in the area of their hearts. Their skin and robes all melted off in unison.

As their human forms melted away, they grew. Their human eyes melted out, being replaced by silver eyes that shone a metallic light. They were the eyes I had seen in my dreams, the eyes that I regularly woke screaming from. Mara’s eyes were the brightest, like two silver suns flashing in the trees.

He quickly grew to fifteen feet tall, a marble-white beast whose skin clung to his bare bones. I could see all his ribs as his mouth opened impossibly wide, his jaw unhinging like a snake and falling down to his chest. Like the other creature I had seen, Mara only had one hideous, rotted tusk on the top of his mouth. He had a long tongue that he bit down on over and over, dripping blood everywhere. I realized this ancient being was totally insane, and had been for millennia.

“He is like the Ouroboros, the snake eating its own tail for all infinity,” Naomi whispered, horrified. “He just gnashes at himself, here on this road, and will forever.” Mara screamed at us, sending droplets of blood flying in our direction. I pulled my hand away from Naomi and focused on creating another ball of light. It flew out of my fingertips and smashed into Mara’s opened mouth, sending him flying back.

“Let’s go!” I yelled at Naomi. Mara was lying on the forest floor, still gnashing his tongue with his tooth as he writhed in a seizure-like convulsion. The white light still snapped and sizzled throughout his body. We sprinted past, the other monsters following us as we ran.

Past the nearest field of Death Cap mushrooms, I saw a massive gate. It looked like it had been constructed from the bone of some massive creature, and the bones formed an archway fifty feet high. Through the archway, I could see the beginning of the Road, the place where Naomi and I had first found the Death Cap Mountain Road at 3:33 AM what felt like an eternity ago. She shot out spears of white light at the pursuing creatures as we sprinted through the archway.

Suddenly, we were just standing at the spot where the Road had originally been, but there was nothing there. We had no car, we were both disheveled, cut up, my ear was missing, but we were here nonetheless. There were only a few evergreens where the Road had stood. We looked around, realizing it was dawn and that a car was driving down the road, probably some local from the town of Unity on their way to their job.

We flagged down the car and they called 911. Both of us were taken to the hospital and our cuts and injuries were attended to. I had the place where my ear used to be stitched up. The police were extremely interested in what had happened to us, but remembering what I had heard from the CIA man on the Road, I just made up a story about a bear attack. Naomi followed my lead.

Now I’m back home, writing this story up on my bed. I’ve been out of the hospital for a few days now, and physically I’m healing fine. I don’t know what to tell Max’s family, and that keeps me up at night. I want to give them closure, but who would believe me? They would think I was some sicko making fun of a good man’s mysterious disappearance. Though keeping me up at night sometimes helps, because I’m afraid to sleep. 

During my dreams, all I can see is silver eyes, and I still wake up screaming every night. I have a feeling I will one day see Mara again, and I don’t think next time I will be so lucky to survive.
