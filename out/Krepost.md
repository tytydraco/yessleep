Last night wasn’t really anything special. We ate dinner prepared by our private chef, then once we were done with that my brother and I swam in the backyard pool for about an hour. At one point, my father came outside and told us that we should go to sleep soon, as he wanted us to be awake when his friend arrived. A few minutes after that, my brother and I got out of the pool, dried off, and went inside. 

I woke up 07:30 to my alarm. I could already hear my father speaking excitedly on the phone downstairs, once again saying how excited he was for his friend to see the villa. I got dressed and went downstairs, where I ate a breakfast that had been prepared by our private chef. After breakfast, my father got a text. “Okay guys, Victor will be here in five minutes. Come and wait out front with me.” My father said.

When Victor arrived, I could smell cigar on his breath as he shook my hand. “You boys can take the guest house for today, Victor and I have adult stuff to discuss,” my father said. With that, my brother and I practically bolted to the guest house.

Time flew by as we sat on our phones and ate some snacks. At around 19:30, my mother knocked on the door to tell us dinner was ready. “Why didn’t you text us?” I asked. “None of our phones are working.”  She replied. To my left, I saw a boat far out in the ocean, but didn’t think much of it. 

During dinner, the head of our security detail, Anton, rushed into the room. “You guys are in danger!” He shouted. Before any of us could reply, the window behind him that overlooked the ocean shattered, and he fell over. A pool of blood started forming from his head. He had been shot, but we didn’t hear a bullet. 

My mother started to scream, while my father gave Victor an uncertain look. Then, Victor was knocked out of his chair by another bullet. My brother and I ran downstairs, leaving behind our mother and father in the dining room. We went into his room and locked the door. My mothers screaming abruptly stopped, and I heard my father begin pleading as more footsteps began to fall on the ground above us. We heard men shouting at my father in a language we couldn’t understand.

We stayed put in my brother’s room, when suddenly we began to feel sleepy. My brother passed out in front of me, while I was able to make it under the bed before I passed out.

I woke up a short time later with a terrible headache, and noticed the door to my brother’s room was opened, and my brother was gone. The villa was silent, so I headed upstairs to see what had happened. If anyone had come to help us.

When I got upstairs, I saw Anton and Victor’s bodies. But nobody else was anywhere to be found. I tried to call the authorities, but my phone still didn’t work. I looked out onto the water and could still see the boat out there, moonlight reflecting off of it. I then walked over to the front door, but saw unfamiliar SUVs blocking the driveway. 

I am writing this from the basement. I am alone and I am scared. I figured I would try to post on here, I hope somebody will see this and get me the help I need. A few moments ago, I heard footsteps above me again. They’re making their way down the basement steps. The door is locked, but I think they can still get me. 

I am fifteen years old and I am scared. I don’t want these men to take me. They are knocking on the door now.
