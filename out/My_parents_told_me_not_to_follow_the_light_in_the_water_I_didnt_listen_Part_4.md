We came upon a house, well, generously a house. It was a shelter, with a roof, and a single broken window. The structure was embellished with bits of garbage and plastic, like ashlar for someone in a state of miserable penury. The ground was a scrim covered in yet more plastic, and bits of broken glass. “Watch where you step” Peter offered.   
  
“What is this place?”   
  
“It’s where the sea-witch lives”   
  
I looked down at a crab struggling to find its way out of a Heineken bottle. I watched as a plastic bag with the words “Thank You” written several times on it float by. Truth be told, my parents were wealthy, so I’d never seen destitution like this. I lived on an island, it’s not as if there were homeless people and drifters loitering about. I’m not even sure I understood what it was that bothered me at the time except for the rank scent of sulfur. That’s hard to enjoy regardless of whichever prejudices you bring to the table.   
  
“Go on walk to the door, and give it a good knock”   
  
“I don’t want to meet the sea-witch, she’ll tear my skin and eat my bones!”   
  
“No, don’t worry about that, she doesn’t eat any children from the land”   
  
“But she does eat children?”   
  
“Well, if you want to call it that. Look, you probably don’t want to know.”   
  
I was feeling a bit braver now “I want to know!”   
  
“Okay, they are her kids. She spawns them, and then eats them, as soon as they come out of her.”   
  
I had no idea what any of that meant, but I didn’t want to seem dumb to my magic squid friend, so I nodded sagely. I walked to the door, still not entirely comfortable, and knocked on the door. There was no answer, so I knocked again. Peter cavorted in the water waiting for the sea-witch to appear. The door swung open, and I jumped back.   
  
There was a woman at the door, she was thin, and wore a large shirt with a stain on it just like the one my father had given me for bedtime. Her hair was ratted, and tangled. Her eyes were sunken in, and she had crooked lines that lined her face. She started coughing, and green phlegm floated in the water. Her arms were covered in scabs, some intact, some broken. She had a voice like rustling packing peanuts.   
  
“What the fuck do you want, and who the fuck are you?” The woman asked.   
  
“Are you the sea-witch?” I asked in return.   
  
“Sea-witch?” She laughed, and coughed again, more phlegm floating into the water. “Look you little shit, I hear all this talk about a God damn sea witch, sailors above the water singing shanties about a fucking sea-witch…”   
  
“Shut up, bitch, I’m not done. One time I found a bottle with a letter in it, and there’s a picture of this angry looking octopus thing in it, the fuck? I am a perfectly normal looking woman who just happens to live underwater, and yeah, maybe I don’t look the best, but it’s a fucking recession, nobody looks good right now. Am I a witch? Eh, I dabble, after I killed that sea-corn’s horn I’ve been grinding it up, and using the left over for spells. And also, and don’t tell anyone, for a little fun.”   
I nodded, though I really wanted to leave.   
Finally, Peter spoke up. “Sheryl, we’re here about the brownies. The delicious brownies that you made for this guest of honor”   
  
“Oh shit, I didn’t even see you, Peter” started the sea-witch. “This son of a bitch, God damn, this motherfucker, damn. You have no idea the kind of trouble we get into. Let me tell you, this little firecracker can put a bottle AWAY.” She laughed “I’ve seen this motherfucker drink a magic crab, and puffer fish under the table, I shit you not. And those puffer fish can drink, they puff, you can imagine. Shit, what’d they call you back in the day, Pete?”   
  
Pete declined to answer.  
  
“Chug KING” She put a quite a bit of emphasis on the word, “Motherfuckin’ Chug King, that’s my man, Pete. It’s good to see you, and who’s this little shit?”   
  
“My name’s Jeremy” I intimated.   
  
“Look, yeah. I’ve got brownies. I’m fucking magic, all right, so yeah, come inside. I’ll hook you up.”   
  
We walked inside. The walls were covered in flaking paint, barely hanging on to a dilapidated frame. Plastic chairs, the colored ones you see in school rooms, cloistered one of those foldable tables you see at food drives. The legs of everything were dug into the dirt scrim, there was no real floor save for a tattered welcome mat tossed oblique to a wall.   
  
But in the center, they were there, brownies. They smelled like chocolate and macadamia; they smelled like love. All of my troubles melted in the scent, wafted away in the current, carried on past the ocean and into the sky, never to burden me again. I couldn’t smell the sulfur anymore, the building was a cathedral, a beatific vision, and the sea-witch its hieratic guardian.   
  
“Go on, eat the brownies” Sheryl motioned toward the platter.   
  
I grabbed one, it immediately had a soporific effect. The flecks of paint swimming from the wall looked as if they were waving kindly, encouraging the experience I was having. I savored every chew, every crunch, every bit of the chocolatey ambrosia. I was in seventh heaven; I was in cloud cuckoo land floating on a cashmere cloud. Sheryl began to groan.   
“Ugh uuuuugh. AH FUCK” Sheryl bellowed.   
  
I drew my attention to her “What’s going on?”   
  
“Motherfuck, I gotta eat, too, and here comes another one.” With that effluvium ejected from below her dress, and out dropped an infant, it’s legs bending, and its head hitting the ground as it crumpled to the floor. It tossed back to and fro, its little baby hands crunched, and its little baby face screaming soon after. Its face was red, and it shook with all the little might it could muster.   
  
Sheryl bent down, and picked the child up by the arm, and tossed onto the table. “Peter, get me the baby killing hammer”   
  
Wordlessly Peter went to a drawer in the kitchen, and wrapped a tentacle around the handle. The door slid open with a creak and a shake, and Peter reached his tentacle inside. He approached Sheryl with a hammer, a wooden handle, and a steal head. Just a regular hammer.   
  
Sheryl smashed the child’s head, and it stopped screaming immediately. There was bone, blood, sinew, and bits of brain as she repeatedly bashed her newborn child’s cranium. “Succulent meat” she averred. She buried her face into the open and skull, and devoured its contents. Slurping and biting, she raised her head for a breath and a cough, blood and dark green phlegm swirling around her like an egg being poached. “Damn good eatin’, too” she laughed.   
  
I was horrified and sick, this is all I could take. I fell to the floor, and when I awoke again, Peter said that he had some news for me.
