Here’s the truth: this gear is nothing without me. My legs, my mind, my talent. That’s what makes the magic happen. Sorry to everyone who bought the same shoes thinking they’d run like me. They won’t. #KipAndOnlyKip #WahoosAreTheFuture #KipRunsFast.

I posted this with a perfectly curated flat lay of my gear, a trophy positioned in the corner for motivation, and my lucky blue Brooks hat front and center. I hit “share,” exited the app, and waited for the notifications to start chirping. I knew they would. I’ve been trail running’s poster child for years — living proof that grit and glory don’t always come without a side of ego.

You know the type — those of us (and sometimes the ladies — let’s not be judgmental) who act like ultra trail running isn’t just a lifestyle but a higher calling. Not everyone can handle it. And let’s be honest: it takes a special kind of person to spend hours alone on trails, conquering terrain that would break most people in minutes. While others waste their weekends binge-watching TV, we’re out grinding through miles of wilderness, proving we’re tougher, faster, and more resilient than 99% of the population. This isn’t just about running — it’s about domination. It’s about people like me — people who refuse to settle for mediocrity and need the world to know it. And what better way to let the world know than to post about it?

So, I did — daily. Actually, multiple times a day. My feed was a mix of clothes, supplements, and medals. I stood tall and proud in the center of every photo, smiling wide, surrounded by my so-called minions. There were ambassador-branded salutes, a couple of posts supporting efforts to bring a missing female runner home, and plenty of coffee cheers sprinkled in for good measure. My feed was a science, and I had it perfected.

I was training for a 100-mile trail race — the MadMan 100. As egotistical, politically narrow-minded, and attention-seeking as some might say I am, people started to take notice when I posted about it. The Wahoos, a local run club, jumped into my comments, showering me with likes and invites to podcasts. My fanbase on Insta and Strava started to soar. Training for an ultra is grueling, but I was thriving. By February, I had my routine locked in. Winter landscapes made for even better pictures. Running in shorts in sub-zero weather? That’s the kind of grit that gets you reshared.

One morning, after snapping a quick selfie — breath fogging the air, beard already dripping with icicles — I set off on a trail I’d run hundreds of times. The trailhead sign was littered with flyers: upcoming events, missing people notices, and hunting guide advertisements. I didn’t bother reading them — why would I? I knew the races coming up, and they made for lousy selfie backdrops anyway.

That morning felt like any other — until I saw her. In the distance, through the trees, a woman moved with an impossibly fluid gait, like she was floating over the uneven terrain. Other runners frequent these woods, but there was something about her — the way she seemed to vanish just as I thought I’d catch up. Her tracks were light and small, like a deer’s. Her ponytail bobbed like a rabbit’s tail, always disappearing just out of reach.

Over the next few weeks, I couldn’t stop looking for her. Every few days, I’d catch a glimpse of this phantom runner — her pink hat bouncing through the brush. Each time, she stayed just beyond my grasp. I never saw her car in the lot, so she must’ve been using another access point. I started parking at different trailheads, running at odd hours, burning through PTO just to find her. Ultra running can be an obsession, and for me, it — or she — became all-consuming.

The lack of sleep and relentless miles took their toll. My times slowed. My body ached — shin splints, blisters, frostbite. My beard grew shaggy, streaked with gray, and my eyes — wild, desperate — stared back at me in the rearview mirror.

MadMan 100 was less than a month away, and it was time to taper my training. Less time on the trails, unless I wanted to die trying.

Then, in early March, I saw her again. This time, she was closer, her form more defined. She stopped, waved, and disappeared into the trees. My heart pounded as I slammed my truck into park, leaving the keys inside. I knew these trails like the back of my hand. I sprinted to cut her off at the bridge.

The mist clung to the forest, muffling my footsteps as I closed the distance. The closer I got, the more uneasy I felt. Light in a forest can be uncanny — shifting and unnatural. As I moved, I noticed a creeping darkness on the trail. The bare limbs of the trees seemed to reach out toward me. High above, large black birds perched, watching my every step.

At the cutoff, I finally closed in. Just ahead, on the bridge, was my trophy — the runner. Her whole figure was visible now, moving swiftly, her feet barely touching the ground. But as I approached, her form shifted unnaturally, bending and blurring like something out of a nightmare. Her pace wasn’t a run or a walk but a strange, erratic rhythm that both drew me in and filled me with dread. Suddenly, she flickered, like a poor TV signal, and then she was gone.

When I reached the spot where she’d been, the truth hit me like a blow. She wasn’t alive. She wasn’t even human anymore. What I saw was a decayed corpse grotesquely entangled in the gnarled branches of an ancient oak. Her bright clothing was dulled by moss and dirt, the pink hat still clinging to her skull. She’d been there a long time, swallowed by the wilderness, forgotten. The only movement was the gentle swaying of her hair in the cold breeze.

I stumbled back, my breath hitching. The woods were silent, except for the pounding of my heart and the groaning of the trees in the wind. I turned and bolted toward my truck, my mind racing. Had this woman — this runner — ever really been there? Who had I been chasing all this time?

I couldn’t shake these thoughts as I tried to make sense of what I’d seen. Moving swiftly, I began to repeat the same words over and over in my head: Kip Runs Fast. Kip Runs Fast.

But now the trails felt darker. The paths were overgrown, unfamiliar. Trees I didn’t remember blocked my way. Mile markers were distorted, the numbers no longer logical. The woods stretched on forever. More than once, I turned a corner and saw her again — her sun-bleached hair still caught in the branches of that ancient tree. I opened my mouth to scream, but no sound came out. All I could hear was the cawing of the crows watching from above.

I pressed on as night fell around me.

Those who followed me saw the final post: a picture of me, huddled in a clearing of brambles, clutching my phone like a lifeline. The caption read:

"I’ve been running forever. No end. She’s still here. I’m still here. #NoWayOut #Endless #LostInTheLoops#LostForever #UltraRunnerHell #KipRunsFast #KipRunsForever."
