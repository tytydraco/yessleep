This is my first time writing a story of my own so bear with me here.

This happened a year ago. I never had any contact with ghosts or spirits and I was pretty skeptical at first. But it was 7 PM and I was home alone, I was of course playing video games until all of a sudden I heard a loud knock coming from upstairs in my house. I didn't think much of it until it happened again a couple minutes later. I thought it was my dogs rough playing as they hate each other a lot. But minutes later I heard shattering, I thought my dogs knocked over a vase so I ran upstairs to see.

Turns out it wasn't a vase but a picture frame of my grandma who had passed when I was younger. But I questioned, "How the hell did the dogs manage to knock over the frame when it was hanged high up?" Seconds later another shatter came but from my grandma's room. My dogs were right next to me when it happened. I walked slowly towards her room and another picture of her was knocked down. I was frightened, I didn't know if someone was in the house or if it was something different.

I heard a knock from the wall. I yelled, "Hello!?" No response. I felt my hair being brushed I jumped back and no one was there. My anxiety levels were bursting, my heart rate was booming. I didn't want to think of it. I ran out the room. Her door shut closed, I freaked and tripped over a chair. I heard a voice say my name. It sounded like her, It sounded like my grandma. Exactly like her. I breathed for air, hyperventilating, I didn't know what was going on. I heard my name again, exactly like her.

I yelled out, "who's there?!" A knock was a response. What was the knock? Was it a response? I asked, "grandma?" Another knock was the response. My eyes started to tear. Was it really her? How is she able to hear me and talk to me? I got up from the floor, I saw lights flicker from the hallway. I hesitated but I walked down. I knew where it was taking me, I opened my grandma's door.

&#x200B;

Nothing new and nothing changed. The picture frame was still broken on the floor and everything was still the same. I sat on her bed, I closed my eyes to think of her. "Is it really you?" I ask openly. Another knock came for a response. I was still frightened a little but overall I was joyful. I'm talking to someone who I was so close to. But the mood changed, something didn't feel right. It felt like I was being watched and it wasn't her. I felt the bed shake and jumped off. It came to my head. She isn't aggressive at all. I wasn't talking to my grandma. I'm talking to someone who is impersonating her.

My heart was racing again. I was talking to someone who was pretending to be my grandma. Her bed shook again but more aggressively, a vase was thrown across my vase and landed on the wall, shattering. I grabbed the door handle but it wasn't opening. I bashed into the door and it still wasn't opening. The light in her room turned off. It was pitch black, I couldn't see anything and I didn't know where I was going. I bumped into the wall and fell back a little and landed on a dresser. Nothing knocked off but it shook. I heard a loud aggressive knocks on the wall. Like it was trying to intimidate me. The lights flickered back on, I ran towards the door again and rushed out the room. After, nothing else happened. Everything ended. No knocks, no voices, nothing.

I wasn't a skeptic for ghosts as this proved to me that there is something after death. Which I feared a lot. When my parents came home I told them everything that happened. They knew I was scared to death and was traumatized from this experience. They didn't know what to say or think of but send me to counseling. I never wanted to experience this but not everything will come to wish. I never think on what happened to me and I normally keep this story to myself but I felt comfortable enough to share. This scarred me and haunts me to this day. Never had I ever experience something like this and hopefully I never will again. I learned something from it. Never trust something so instantly as it can be something you don't want it to be.
