Thank you all for the support, [that helps me continue. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/mFJxl10Pgn)Today, I will tell you about Halloween night 2022, one of the strangest and most screwed up nights I had in the store and in life.

It all started with the start of the shift, at eight at night. During the twelve hours I worked, it was raining and there was a thick fog in the surroundings, so I was a little nervous, since the power might go out or whatever.

Everything started out relatively normal, we were with Emily talking and serving one or another customer who came to buy sweets. Also, we had two clients who warned us that bad things were going to happen that night. They were two local elderly women, seventy-five years old and another eighty.

We asked them what they meant and they said that the most terrifying creatures come out on this night and that portals open to other unknown worlds.

Emily didn't believe them so much. I do. At that time, my partner was quite skeptical even though before that night, strange things had already happened to us in the store and in the town. Nowadays, she is no longer like that.

After that, around eleven, strange things began.

A girl arrived at the store. She looked sixteen years old, with white skin and hazel eyes, and was dressed in a dark blue sweatshirt, black pants, and sneakers. She had four bracelets on her left wrist and a white digital watch on her right, rings on her fingers, and earrings on her ears. His hair was dark straight and he was wearing clear glasses.

"Good night." He said calmly. She seemed quite shy. Emily went to help her and said: "Hello!"

"I want a bag of chips and a Pepsi." He said while touching his hair a little.

"Of course!" Emily exclaimed, as cheerful as ever. She brought the chips and Pepsi to the girl and told her the price.

"Yes, wait a second..." Then, the young woman made a crooked smile, take his head and... Slowly pulled it off. This is an image that I will always remember in my nightmares.

His head detached from his neck as he made a disturbing sound of bones and tissue tearing. Blood splashed in spurts. It was terrifying. The girl was laughing somehow while doing it.

His laugh wasn't strange or evil, it was just a laugh you let out when you're watching a funny video on the internet.

"WHAT THE FUCK?!" Emily shouted. I was speechless and in shock, I didn't understand anything.

The woman, when she finally tore head, her hands took it and left it on the counter. The head said, "Here you go." in a normal tone and his eyes rolled back.

A few seconds later, the headless body fell and literally, without any explanation, vanished...

After being in shock for a few moments, we discussed what to do with the head and all the blood on the floor and counter and came to a conclusion: I would bury the head and Emily would clean up the mess. Then, we would erase the evidence left by the security cameras. Nobody ever noticed all this. Currently, the head is still buried.

We were scared until twelve. It was already the first of November, my nineteenth birthday. There we were able to relax a little, Emily gave me a gift (an Xbox game for me) and we talked a little.

It was then that at one in the morning the "Pumpkin Man" visited us.

This thing arrived dressed in a gray suit with a black tie, gloves and shoes of the same color, about eight feet tall. Its head was a large pumpkin with eyes, nose and mouth from which a strong yellow light came out. He wore a head that had a large hole in the middle of it with many sweets inside.

"Hey!" The pumpkin man exclaimed. "Trick or treat!" His voice was acute, cartoonish. Then, he put his "basket" on the counter, asking for treats.

"W-what?" I asked shakily. Emily was pale.

"Trick or treat?" The creature said, raising its hands.

Then John, a fifty-year-old man, someone from the town, arrived and was paralyzed.

"Trick or treat!" Thing turned around and spoke to the man.

"I-I'm sorry brother, I don't have any candy, I-" Then, the creature took out a large knife from his pocket and pointed it at John.

"Then buy me candy." Pumpkinman said.

"No, I-" And in a fleeting movement, the figure split the poor guy open...

The two parts fell to the ground and then, they vanished like the girl's body two hours ago. With Emily, we started screaming.

"Now... Trick or Treat?" The thing asked slowly while pointing the knife at us. I went to the shelf with candy and took as much as possible in my hands and put them on the head while saying: "H-here it is buddy, we're sorry."

Then the pumpkin man took the head and exclaimed, "Thank you!" And he left whistling happily.

Later, during that night, we could not be calm. Nothing strange happened after that. The next day, it was said that a pumpkin man was walking through the streets of the town asking for sweets and murdering those who did not give him any. He killed four children and an adult (John).

That's it for the post, I hope you liked it. Things also happened on Christmas that year and on Halloween and Christmas the next. I hope to be able to tell that later. Good night friends.
