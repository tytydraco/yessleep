Being a line cook I usually work with my head down. In the loud cacophony of clinks, tickets printing, and yelling, I raise blinders to the world around me and give complete focus to the task at hand. Only ever breaking out to Interact with my chefs or peers. I wear a watch on the line for the sole purpose of keeping up with my times, pushing myself to be faster, better. My little Cassio has been pretty useful in general though, especially when my phone dies away from home. It’s always useful to know the time, in some situations It could be life or death.

  Today as I was leaving work I noticed something strange. The time on my watch was three minutes ahead of the time on the clock out device. I was a tad bit perturbed by the notion it was wrong as I hadn’t hit any of the buttons on my watch on accident that day, I’m sure I would have heard the little beep it would’ve made. But I checked my phone and it said the same thing. I do work in a hectic environment as a cook so it isn't unreasonable that I could have bumped it into something by accident. But then it happened again the next day, and this time it was ten minutes. Now three times is a hard to believe number of hitting your wrist without knowing, but believable nevertheless. 
 
   There is absolutely no way I could have bumped my wrist into anything ten times and not noticed. And it was an extremely slow day at that so there would have been no opportunities to have even done so. “Welp, my watch is broken,” I thought. So I bought a new one at the gas station the next day and thought nothing of it. Think of my surprise when, you guessed it, my brand new watch does the exact same thing the next day. But this time the clock out device was a whole hour behind my watch.
     
   Now, I know that my watch isn't malfunctioning, today was an exceptionally slow day and I paid expert attention to the watch, comparing it with my phone's time. It passed the test, every hour, on the hour, it showed the correct time. But when I got to that machine a whole hour of time somehow slipped from underneath me. I quickly pulled my phone from my pocket and it confirmed that my watch was a whole hour ahead of time. 

   No, this can't be, I refuse to believe that my phone which confirmed while walking up to this machine that the time was correct on my watch, is now somehow a whole hour behind sed watch. This is insane. What is the worst part of this you ask? I have to go back to work now, for another whole hour. 
    
  “Where the fuck have you been,” yelled my chef, pissed off that I had left in the middle of an apparent rush. “Sorry chef, somethings up with my watch. It said it was ten already.” I knew that was a lie but I figured telling him that was easier than admitting I might be insane. “There's a clock on the wall dumbass. One more and you're gone,” he said sternly. I didn't want to test him so I hurried back to my station. “Dude what the fuck,” said jim. “I had to do that whole table by myself, pay attention,” he said exasperated as if the whole dining room had been ordering from the station I had left behind. 

   I looked up at the dining room and in fact there was no one there. “Where'd everyone go?” I said. “They left before you got here,” he said in a hurry to get back to his station. He scurried off to his side of the line, resorting himself to an upside down cambrow and the videos on his phone.
     
   I looked at Jim for a moment, that guy,  he sorta disgusted me. Short and fat, his eyes never look at you at the same time, and his mouth was always disgustingly sopping wet. Sometimes he just stares off into the distance, drool swinging from his engorged moist bottom lip. I hate everything that man stands for. Everything he does is an affront to me. He never works, he just acts like he does. He’ll pick up a broom just to sweep dirt around, never to pick it up with a dustpan. All to avoid doing his actual job, which is cooking. 
      
   But I prefer it that way, because when he actually cooks, he does it like a disgusting slob who shouldn't be allowed within a hundred feet of a kitchen. Constant cross contamination, shells in eggs, undercooked chickens, broken sauces, rice that is both burnt and undercooked. This man is an anomaly. But Chef refuses to fire him. I’ll never know why. 
     
   There is nothing in the world I want more than to go home at this moment. In defeat I lean onto my workstation looking at the mess Jim made. Since I had thought my shift was over I wrapped all of my pans up. And of course that sack of shit Jim plopped his greasy little hands through the plastic instead of unwrapping them. I looked at him in disgust, he was picking his nose now. Paying me no mind. “Whatever,” I said under my breath. I rewrapped all the exposed pans, wiped up all the oil and sauce Jim had sloppily drizzled my station with, and resigned myself to my own makeshift seat. 
      
   I glanced at my watch out of habit. What I saw confused me. Since the last time I had attempted to clock out, three more hours had, according to my watch, gone by. That couldn't have been possible, it couldn't have been but six minutes since I did that. I looked at my Phone to confirm. I knew it was impossible but I still had this sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach like there was something wrong. And, to my chagrin, there definitely was something wrong. My phone confirmed it.
      
   Now I figured at this point I had a few options. I could either ignore this, act like nothing happened and just leave when I feel like an hour had gone by. Or, I could try and clock out now. For a second I gave in, took a breath, and sat back to think. Maybe I am overthinking this, maybe both my phone and my watch are broken, maybe this is all in my head.

   Then I looked at my phone. It said it was five o’clock in the morning, the next day. A shock ran down my spine with a violence shaking me as it passed down my vertebrae. I shot up. ‘No this can’t, I’m not crazy!’ I thought. My mind raced as I ran to the break room.
      
   That little tablet, that black box hanging on the wall. It had the exact same time on it as when I had last checked it. My mouth hung agape, my eyes bulged, and I laughed. Not even a minute had gone by since I had checked it. I calmed myself, I took a breath and I rationalized. It’s a rare occasion but everything must just have been broken at the same time.
      
   Chuckling to myself I turned around and walked down the hallway to the chef's office. What was waiting for me at the end of that hallway still haunts me. As I began to reach the end of the hallway, I heard something. I heard the voices of a full dining room, the sound of conversation and forks clicking on porcelain. And  I rounded the corner to look out on this supposedly full dining room. I was met with nothing. And when I say nothing I mean  void. 

   No light, no sound. The only detectable feeling being a breeze, a hot sticky breath from the maw of nothingness. I tried to look away but It followed my gaze. Something licked my had. I jerked my arm back only to trip on myself and fall into the void. Something caught me. It grabbed my arms and legs outstretching them, the back of my neck was met with a tongue and hot breath to match the dank that now encapsulated me. 
      
   Then I opened my eyes. I was sprawled out on the floor. I instinctively griped the back of my neck. It was dry but I could still sense what had happened as if i was being forced to remember every second. I shifted into a fetal position, vomit slid from my mouth as I layed shivering. After a few minutes of suffering I heard movement in front of me. I opened my eyes and lifted my head only to see the foot of my chef crashing down at my head and then nothing. 
      
   When I woke up I was in the chef's office, tied to a chair. The vomit on my mouth had dried. My chef sat across his desk staring at me with a blank expression. He looked down as he began to speak, “you’ve seen it now, and he’s seen you,” he said in a soft voice that I’d heard him use. “Chef what’s going on,” I said, still in a daise. “He’s kissed you on the neck, he wants you,” he said in a whisper. 

   “Chef what the fuck,” I screamed. Just then slouched down and screamed into his lap as loud as he could. He looked up at me with tears in his eyes and uttered one last word “run.” Then his body went limp, his head hit the desk and then his body the floor. And I could do nothing but look at him and his lifeless body and cry as the lights in the room flickered and a darkness crept in on me from the corners of my eyes.
      
   I raised my shoulders up against my cold exposed neck and struggled with my bindings. With tears streaming down my cheeks and I cried so hard that I couldn’t breath, my lungs shocked with every gulp of air. The only thing I could think to do was close my eyes and wait for the inevitable defilement. As I sit there waiting I feel the hot stinking breath of my horror. And then I hear a click.

   I open my eyes with relief to see the room I’m in is how it should be. I look behind me to see Jim poking through the door rifling through the nearby drawer chef kept the candy in. “Hey,” I said looking back at him. He paused and looked over to me “what the hell,” he said. Even now, even when he was the only thing that could save me, I couldn't be patient with him. “Get over her and help me,” I yelled. He opened the door all the way and looked at me, just standing there staring. At first I had a rush of anger but then it was followed by fear. I was helpless , tied up and injured.

   He knew I didn’t like him, that I hated him. Right now he could hurt me, or worse, and I have no mode of action to stop it. My breath fastened and my eyes widened at the implication. He took a step forward, a whimper left my mouth as air involuntarily escaped past my vocal cords. I could feel the muscles in my throat tense and bulge into my mouth, my neck was sore from the stress. 

  As he got closer a bead of sweat ran down my forehead landing on my lips. He reached my side and bent down to my ear, my body stretched away from him but he leaned in closer his disgusting stomach rubbing my bond arm and his hand on the desk for support. 

   His breath stink of rot and with his words moisture stung my ear. “I was like you once. You can leave but he’ll have you, and you’ll be like me.” I turned to him with a scowl. He looked back at me with indifference in one eye and the other towards the distance. His mouth agape, only closing to slurp down his disgusting spit. Then he got up, pulled a knife from his pocket and cut me loose.
      
   I didn’t bother clocking out this time. I stood up, walked out of the building, and drove straight home in silence. When I got home I sat down in my chair and I screamed and cried and beat my head with my fists until I fell asleep. And then in the middle of the night I woke up to a warm, dank, breath on my face. I shot up. I wasn’t there, but I think at some point I was. 

   Again I cried, and I decided something. Whatever it is that lives beyond time in that void, whatever wants me. It can’t have me. I won't be like Jim, I’ve already begun to forget things. While I was driving I drifted off for a moment. If it doesn’t already have me, it will, so I’m going to kill myself. I just want someone to believe me before I die, and to warn others. If time is slowing down while you're at work and your coworkers are like Jim. Leave before it's too late.
