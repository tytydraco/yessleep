This isn’t a ghost story. It’s a warning. I don’t know why I’m posting this now. Maybe because I haven’t said a word in almost two years and something in me is clawing to get out.

I lived in Berlin for a while—early 2023. I’d moved there for work, and the rent was insane. So when I found an ad for a one-bedroom apartment near Prenzlauer Berg for under €500, I jumped. The landlord didn’t say much. Just handed me the keys, warned me the windows don’t open properly, and left.

It was… strange from the start. Not scary, just off. The building was cold, even in the spring. It felt empty, even though the parking lot had cars and some mailboxes had names.

I didn’t think much of it—until the second night.

5:00 PM – 6:00 PM: The Footsteps

I was working on my laptop when I heard footsteps on the stairwell. Heavy, slow, deliberate steps. At first I assumed it was a neighbor. But when I glanced through the peephole, no one was there. The steps just kept going up, then stopped.

The next evening, same thing.
Then again.
Always between 5 and 6 PM.
Always the same rhythm.
Always… no one there.

I started leaving the apartment during that hour. Sitting in the café across the street, sipping coffee I didn’t want. Pretending it was normal.

9:00 PM – The Laughter

By the fifth night, I heard kids running in the hall. Laughter, giggles, the sound of little feet slapping the floor.

Thing is: I never saw any children in the building. No strollers. No toys. No high-pitched screams in the courtyard.

The laughter bounced off the walls in weird ways. It didn’t feel happy. It felt wrong. Hollow. Like someone was mimicking what laughter should sound like.

I stopped sleeping with my lights off.

Midnight – The Screaming

She starts at midnight. Every night.

At first it sounded like a distant wail. By the time the clock hits 12:15, she’s full-on screaming. Raw, primal, endless pain. Like her throat should be torn to shreds.

I tried calling the police once. They came. Knocked on my door. I let them in, desperate for someone else to hear it.
But the moment they stepped inside... silence.
They gave me a weird look. Said I might be “adjusting poorly to the city” and left.

As soon as they were gone, the screaming came back—louder than ever.

1:00 AM – The Screens

I was scrolling on my phone in bed when the screen glitched. Flickered. Then static.

Then a face.

Not an image. Not a video. A face watching me.

Pale. Hollow eyes like bottomless pits. Mouth wide open in a soundless scream.

I threw the phone across the room. My TV turned on by itself—same static. Same face.

If you keep watching her, something happens. You feel her. Like she’s inside the room. Watching from behind your eyes.

I stopped using electronics after 12:30. I taped black cloth over the TV and locked my phone in a drawer.

2:00 AM – The Woman in White

She drags herself down the halls.
Covered in blood, wearing a tattered white dress.
You can hear her feet scraping.
If you peek through the peephole, you’ll see her stop at random doors.

One night, she stopped at mine.
Stood there. Breathing.
I held my breath, pressed against the wall, convinced if I moved, I’d die.

She eventually walked away.

But the blood she left behind on the floor never dried. It stayed fresh. Sticky.

The building’s janitor didn’t seem to notice. I asked him once if he cleaned the third floor.
He just blinked at me like I was speaking another language.

2:30 AM – The Car

It arrives like clockwork.

A black car pulls into the lot. No license plate. Windows tinted black.
The car looks… decayed. Like it clawed its way out of the dirt.

It sits there. Then the alarms start.

First the black car’s. Then all the others.
They don’t stop.
They scream together, like they’re alive.

And when I looked out the window once, I swear I saw someone in the driver’s seat.

Not someone—something.

3:00 – 5:00 AM – The Crying

By this point, I wasn’t sleeping anymore.

The crying starts low. A woman’s sobs echoing through the pipes, the floorboards, the walls. You feel it in your bones.

I stepped out on the balcony once. I don’t know why. Morbid curiosity, I guess.

She was standing there.
On the opposite balcony. Still. Broken. Staring at nothing.
And then… she turned around.

Her face—

I can’t describe it.

Distorted. Bloody. Black tears streaming from empty sockets. Her mouth opened slowly, but no sound came out.

But I heard it. Inside my head.

Something cracked in me that night. Something final.

I left the next day. Packed what I could and got the hell out.

Never told anyone what happened. Never said goodbye. Never logged into that email again. I stayed with friends until I found a new place. I haven’t spoken a word since. Not one. I can’t.

Because if I do…
I think she’ll hear me.

They say only a handful of people are left in that building. I don’t know how.

If you’re in Berlin and see a listing for a cheap apartment on the corner of Lothringer Straße—run.

Don’t visit. Don’t contact the landlord. Don’t go inside.

Because she’s still there.

And she remembers everyone who leaves.

She misses you.

She always will.
And she’s still watching.
