Wild claim, right? But hear me out.

Think of some of those movies, from the 2000s. The ones where the CGI looks ALMOST real, but... like, the Polar Express. They look fake and real at the same time. There's too much detail, it's too close without being the real thing.

I was out for a walk at night - I just love the sight of a city at night, the countless lights of the cars on the highway, the crisp, cool winter air contrasting warmth with my thick coat. It's not the safest time to walk around, but hell - living safe ain't really living.

I was out, and I stopped at a bus stop bench - I'd been walking for at least an hour, and I knew I should head home, but my feet were a bit sore. Nothing a short rest won't cure. There were only two people in the vicinity, a guy and a girl. A couple, I assumed. I didn't pay them much mind at first, just idly browsing on my phone. But I looked up, curious, and illuminated by that glow of the headlights of passing traffic, I saw her face. Real. Fake. Neither and both, somebody who walks that line, eyes a bit too big, skin just barely not detailed enough, teeth a little bit too white. I stared for a shade too long, because she looked my way. She seemed confused, and soon her boyfriend turned to look at me as well. He called out to me, and I shook my head.

"Sorry, just staring out into space - daydreaming." I said with a small laugh. She bought it, I think - and a moment later, the bus pulled in. They hugged, and she climbed aboard - he waved. All very normal. And when the bus turned a corner, the man quickly walked over and sat next to me, his face pale. 

"You can't stare. You... I don't think she realized this time, but you can't let them know you can see it." He muttered quietly. The hairs on my arms stood on end, and with a small cough, I replied.

"They... what do you mean? Look, does she have some sort of condi-"

"No! No, listen I..." he trailed off, thinking.

"I don't know. It's not - most people can't see it. Even if you can, it's sudden, one day you can't, the next you can. But once it happens, it doesn't go away. You can't stare. If they know you can see, they'll make you disappear."

I tried to think of a decent reply, a good question, but words failed me. He continued:

"They're not good. Whatever they are. They don't have our best interests in mind, and they don't like when we can see them. We're not supposed to see them."

I found my voice.

"She's your... girlfriend, right? So why?"

He laughed ruefully.

"I first saw her - the real her - about five seconds after I proposed. I - the face I made - I told her it was just a really emotional moment. She believed me... I think for a moment, she suspected. But she believed me. But if I leave... she might remember the face I made. She... I can't outrun them. They're very rare, I almost never see them."

He was crying now, shaking.

"My brother... it happened to him when it happened to me. He came to visit, saw her - he freaked out, ran out of the house. He had a family, kids. All of them went away - and not just missing. I couldn't remember his face, he wasn't in any of the the family photos. I used to have a scar on my left arm - he played a prank on me, jumped out of the bathroom and scared me, when we little. I fell downstairs, broke my arm bad. Bone poking through the skin bad. He caught hell for it..."

He let out a shaky sigh.

"Scar's gone. It never happened. He never happened. All I'm left with are faceless, faded memories. She started watching me closely after that. She still... she tries to trick me. She's not sure, I've been doing a good job, but - I can't run. Nowhere is far enough. I can't hide or disappear. They might do it to me, just to be sure. I can't even fake my death."

He wiped away his tears.

"You did good. You didn't even make a face. She doesn't know. Never let them know."

He stood up and brushed himself off.

"I needed this. Thank you."

I would have thanked him too, but a moment later, he threw himself into the road. I won't go into detail, but as I sat there, shocked out of my mind, staring at his broken body at the road, and the panicked man dialing 911, for a tiny, microscopic moment, I envied him.

And now, I'm sitting here, typing this out, and I can't stop shaking. Remembering her face. Remembering those terrible words he said to me.

But I can't remember his face.
