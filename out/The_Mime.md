I had just finished watching Terrifier 3 at the theater. I’ll be honest – it was one of the few movies I’d ever seen that actually lived up to the rumors of people fainting and walking out midway. It was gruesome, twisted, and left me feeling more than a little queasy. By the end of it, the place had mostly cleared out. Only a few of us had stayed until the credits.

It was late, and I didn’t feel like walking all the way home, so I ordered an Uber. The app said it’d be about 20 minutes. So, I figured I’d just wait outside, try to shake off the residual tension from the movie.

As I walked out, I noticed a man sitting on a bench directly across from me, all alone. He was dressed as a mime, complete with the stark black and white makeup, red suspenders, gloves, and that eerie painted smile. I tried to ignore him, but he was just… staring. It was unsettling, to say the least.

“Did you enjoy the movie?” I asked him, hoping maybe a quick exchange would make the whole situation feel a little less weird. He nodded enthusiastically, his painted eyes widening.

“Are you cosplaying as Art?” I asked, referencing the clown from Terrifier. He shook his head slowly, like a pendulum, then reached into his suit and handed me a small, yellowed calling card. In simple black font, it read:

"Bozo the Mime."

“I think that name’s already taken, pal,” I muttered, handing it back, half-expecting him to take offense. Instead, he seemed thrilled, his eyes lighting up as he stuffed the card back into his pocket and began an exaggerated mime routine.

I nervously glanced down at my phone to check the Uber’s location. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw the mime glance at my phone, irritated that I wasn’t watching. He pulled an imaginary lasso from his side and, in one fluid motion, threw it at me. I felt a tug at my wrist and saw my phone slip out of my hand, flying into his grip. I blinked in confusion.


"Hey, what the hell, man? Give that
back!" I said, stepping forward.

The mime just smiled and set my
phone on the ground. He mimed
lifting an invisible hammer, his
expression contorting with the
"effort" as he raised it high above his
head. And then - he swung down,
smashing the invisible hammer into
my phone. To my horror, the screen
shattered in a spray of broken glass.

l'd had enough. I jumped up, shoved
him backward, and bolted back into
the theater lobby, where a couple of
employees were still mopping up
popcorn and closing down for the
night. I stammered through an
explanation about the mime outside.
They looked at each other, sharing a
skeptical glance before the security
guard stepped forward.

"Alright, let's get this guy out of
here," the guard said, leading the
way as the mime sauntered through
the door.

"Leave the premises" the guard
ordered, his voice firm. The mime
obediently raised his hands as if
being held at gunpoint, but as he
lowered them, he mimed pulling a
pistol from his invisible holster. He
aimed his "finger gun" at the guard
and, with a cocky grin, jerked his
hand as though firing a shot.
The guard staggered backward, half
of his head suddenly a bloody mess
as he collapsed to the floor, lifeless.
For a moment, the rest of us just
stared, paralyzed with shock, trying
to process what we'd just seen.
Then, as the reality hit, panic
erupted.

One of the female staff members
tried to make a run for it, but before
she could reach the door, the mime
threw an invisible lasso around her
feet, yanking her back. She
Screamed as he dragged her closer,
grinning wildly. Then he raised his
hands, miming the pull of a
chainsaw cord. The invisible engine
roared to life, and with grotesque
pantomiming, he sliced her in half.
Blood sprayed across the lobby,
painting the walls red.

The rest of us scrambled in every
direction. The mime walked casually
to the entrance and mimed pulling
the door shut, swallowing an
invisible key with a dramatic gulp.
He turned back to us, eyes gleaming
as he pretended to open a cage and
release a pair of ferocious dogs. A
male staffer tried to defend himself,
but something invisible  lunged at
him, tackling him to the floor, tearing
him apart as he writhed and
Screamed.

In the corner of the lobby, the last
female employee stared up,
terror-stricken. The mime looked at
her and made a hand-over-hand
gesture, as if lowering a rope. She
looked up, and before she could
react, an invisible weight fell on her,
crushing her into a pool of blood
and viscera.

And then it was just him and me.
He turned slowly, his painted eyes
boring into mine. For what felt like
an eternity, he stared at me,
unblinking, before breaking into an
exaggerated grin. With a flourish, he
threw his arms as if to say-
"Ta-da!"

I forced a smile, laughing nervously,
hoping to appease him. His
expression brightened, and he
bounced up and down like a
delighted child. Through the glass
doors, I could see my Uber waiting
Outside. The mime mimed
regurgitating the invisible key he'd
swallowed, and handed it to me,
motioning for me to go.
I bolted, fumbling with the door as
my hands shook, but it only opened when I used the "key" the mime gave me. I raced to the car, threw
myself inside, and screamed at the
driver to floor it. We sped away, my
heart pounding as I looked out the
back window.

The mime was standing there in the
glow of the streetlight, waving
goodbye with that same painted grin
plastered on his face.
