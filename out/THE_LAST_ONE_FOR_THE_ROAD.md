— Give me one last drink. — The hoarse voice cut through the silence of the nearly empty bar, heavy with impatience.

The bartender, Pituca, glanced up as he wiped a glass with an already grimy rag. He cast a wary look at the man seated at the counter.  
— You shouldn’t be drinking, you know? — Pituca said, his tone hesitant but firm.

The man raised an eyebrow, almost mocking the advice.  
— One shot won’t hurt, Pituca. — He leaned slightly forward, resting his elbow on the counter. — Just to warm up before I hit the road.

Pituca sighed but didn’t move.  
— I don’t know about this... — he murmured, glancing sideways at the glass in his hand. — A lot of folks are crashing on those highways... Especially on the BRs.

— A bunch of cowards! — the man shot back with a wry smirk. — I’ve been doing this for years, Pituca. I know what I’m doing. Pour me that last drink. I’ve got a delivery to make tonight.

— Delivery? — Pituca asked, suspicious, as he set the glass down on the counter.

— Yeah. Heading to Vale Verde.

At the mention of that place, Pituca went pale. He froze, the rag suspended mid-air, his face ghostly white. He said nothing. Turning reluctantly, he began preparing the drink.

Meanwhile, the man glanced around. The bar was nearly empty, the yellowish light casting strange shadows on the walls. Outside, the sound of a cricket seemed to grow louder by the second, as if warning of something.

Pituca placed the glass on the counter, his hand trembling slightly.  
— Good luck. — His voice was almost a whisper.

The man shrugged, grabbed the glass, and downed it in one gulp. Rising from his seat, he noticed Pituca’s unnerved expression.  
— Pituca, you okay? — I asked, staring at the old bartender. He seemed uneasy, his face paler than usual, his eyes fixed on some invisible point on the counter.

He took a few seconds to respond, and when he finally raised his eyes, his expression was grave.  
— If I were you, Jhonatan... I wouldn’t go there.

— Wouldn’t go where? — I asked, raising an eyebrow. The unexpected reply piqued my curiosity.

— To Vale Verde. — His tone was low, almost a whisper, as if he didn’t want anyone else to hear, even though the bar was empty except for the two of us.

I laughed, trying to lighten the mood.  
— Ah, Pituca... What’s this about? Since when do you believe in that nonsense? You’re starting to sound like my mom with those scary bedtime stories.

Pituca didn’t smile. He just shook his head slowly and pressed his lips together. Worry seemed etched into every line of his aged face.  
— I’ve heard stories about that place since I was a kid, Jhonatan. — He sighed, crossing his arms on the counter. — That place is bad. Real bad.

— Bad how, Pituca? Come on, you’re kidding.

He leaned in closer, his voice now laden with unsettling seriousness.  
— People disappear there, Jhonatan. No explanation, no trace. They just vanish. Especially kids.

The last phrase stopped my laughter before it even started.  
— Kids? — I asked, now paying attention.

— Yeah. They get lost in the rows of cornfields and are never seen again. — He gestured outside, as if he could visualize the place he was describing. — And there’s no point in searching. They never find anything. Just emptiness... And a strange silence.

— Alright, alright. — I raised my hands, still half-smiling. — Just because someone got lost in the fields doesn’t mean the place is cursed, right?

Pituca was silent for a moment, his gaze fixed on me.  
— A kid showed up here the other day. Must’ve been about 18, full of bravado. He came with his girlfriend.

I leaned in, intrigued.  
— And?

He sighed before continuing.  
— Said he was going to Vale Verde. I tried to warn him. Told him everything I could. But he just laughed in my face.

— What did he say? — I asked, curious.

Pituca closed his eyes for a moment, as if trying to push away the unsettling memory.  
— He looked at me and said, “I’m taking my girl to the Vale Verde cornfield. It’s gonna be the best night of my life. You’ll see, you old coward.”

I laughed briefly, but the sound came out nervous.  
— Bold kid. Teenagers always think they know everything, huh?

Pituca didn’t find it funny.  
— Yeah, I thought the same thing at the time. But a few days later, his parents showed up here. The girl’s mother too.

— Looking for them? — I asked, my tone now more serious.

He nodded.  
— They came in desperation, asking if I knew anything. I told them what I knew—that they’d gone to Vale Verde.

— And then?

Pituca shook his head slowly.  
— Never heard from them again. Not the parents. Not the girl’s mother. No one.

The silence that fell over the bar was uncomfortable, like a weight settling over the room. Outside, the wind howled softly, pushing the door, which creaked with every movement.

— Pituca... — I said, trying to ease the tension. — I respect you, but I don’t believe in that stuff. I’ve traveled many roads in my life. Don’t worry.

He looked at me for a long moment before responding.  
— There are things in this world, Jhonatan, that we don’t understand. And some of them... It’s better not to try.

I finished my drink and placed the glass on the counter with more force than I intended.  
— Maybe so, but I’ve made up my mind. I’m going anyway.

Pituca sighed, lowering his head, as if giving up on trying to convince me.  
— May God protect you, Jhonatan.

I placed some bills on the counter and walked toward the door.  
— See you around, Pituca. Don’t worry so much.

Pituca watched the door close with a creak, the sound echoing in the empty bar. He kept his eyes on the entrance as he murmured to himself:  
— May God go with you...

I climbed into my truck, that iron giant, a 1978 model that was my home on wheels. The smell of diesel oil and worn leather filled the cabin—a familiar, comforting scent that always accompanied me on the road.

I turned on the battery-powered radio I charged at gas stations, and the heavy sound of AC/DC began to play. “Highway to Hell” was the perfect soundtrack for the dusk unfolding before me. The clock read close to six in the evening, and the sun was setting on the horizon, painting the sky in shades of orange and red, as if it were drowning in a sea of fire.

Driving along the highway, my hands gripped the wheel firmly, feeling the vibration of the engine beneath me. The wind blew through the slightly open window, carrying the scent of damp earth and trees lining the road. It was a mix of freedom and loneliness that only life on the road could offer.

Cars passed by, and other trucks crossed my path, with drivers waving or flashing their lights in greeting. I returned the gesture with a brief wave, keeping my eyes on the road. The radio continued playing as I headed toward Vale Verde.

It took me about one or two hours to get near the place. It was a long trip, but I was used to the solitude and silence of the road, interrupted only by the electric guitars of AC/DC. It was 1979, and I was one of the few who had the luxury of a portable TV in my truck. I loved watching movies when parked at rest stops—a way to escape the monotonous routine.

As the sun disappeared below the horizon, the sky began to change. Dense clouds formed, painting the evening in shades of gray. The wind picked up, carrying the smell of rain that soon started to sprinkle on the windshield—tiny drops illuminated by the headlights.

Night fell, and the weather worsened. Lightning streaked across the sky like blades, illuminating the cornfield that appeared alongside the road. It was as if the heavens were at war with themselves.

An endless stretch of corn began to appear—tall green walls extending for miles. My boss had mentioned this, saying Vale Verde was famous for its cornfields and known as one of the greenest towns in the country. He also claimed that nearly all the residents were wealthy, owners of the sprawling fields.

I found it hard to believe. Brazil was a land of inequalities, and thinking an entire town could be wealthy sounded like one of those exaggerated trucker tales. Maybe just idle chatter. Either way, the landscape was both impressive and oppressive, with that sea of corn hemming in the road.

The rain thickened, falling heavy and relentless. The windshield wipers worked hard, leaving wet trails on the glass as the headlights seemed to dissolve in the curtain of water. The sound of AC/DC still played faintly, mixed with the pattering rain and distant thunderclaps.

Then I saw it.

A figure emerged from the cornfield by the roadside.

I slammed the brakes hard, the truck skidding several meters before coming to a stop. The sound of the tires screeching on the wet pavement echoed through the night.

  I jumped out of the truck, my heart racing as if trying to burst out of my chest. The rain was pouring down in torrents, soaking my clothes within seconds. The headlights illuminated a girl stumbling out of the cornfield.

She was covered in blood.

— Are you okay? — I shouted, running toward her. My voice felt small against the roar of the rain and thunder.

She didn’t respond. Her eyes were wide, her face pale, almost gray. Blood trickled from a cut on her forehead, mixing with the rain. She looked lost, her hair plastered to her face and her clothes torn.

— Hey, talk to me! — I insisted, carefully grabbing her shoulders. I could feel her body trembling under my hands.

She mumbled something, but it was impossible to understand over the noise around us. The only thing I could grasp was the metallic scent of blood mingling with the sweet, earthy smell of corn that seemed to permeate the air around us.

— What happened? — I asked, trying to drown out the storm’s noise.

She lifted her eyes to meet mine, filled with terror, and whispered something that chilled me to the bone:  
— They’re coming.

— Who? Who’s coming?

She started crying, her sobs muffled by the roaring wind. I pointed toward the truck.  
— Come on, I’ll get you out of here. Move!

The girl hesitated, glancing back at the cornfield. She looked emaciated, and beneath the torn clothes, her skin bore bruises and scars. My stomach turned as I noticed the raw, exposed flesh where one of her hands should have been.

The shock made me pause. Thoughts raced through my mind—a lunatic in Vale Verde, a pedophile who had assaulted her and mutilated her. What if he was watching me now, hidden in the cornfield, observing my every move?

My blood froze. Pituca’s words came flooding back: “Vale Verde is evil.” The place felt cursed, and though the rain had lightened, it still fell heavily, as if trying to bury everything beneath its weight.

Even without the wind, the rustling of the cornfield’s leaves grew louder, mingling with the sound of the raindrops hitting them. I glanced at the endless rows of corn, and the noise seemed to take on a life of its own. A chill ran down my spine, and the feeling of being watched became unbearable.

I ran back to the truck, my hands still smeared with the girl’s blood. I was drenched, but that was the least of my worries. I thought about returning to the bar, but it was too far. With no other choice, I continued down the road toward Vale Verde, leaving the girl’s body by the cornfield’s edge.

As I walked, surrounded by the endless rows of corn, a distant light appeared on the horizon. It was the town. A small sense of relief surfaced in the midst of the darkness.

Crossing into Vale Verde, I was met with an almost surreal sight: the town seemed untouched by the poverty I knew so well. Grand houses, luxurious mansions, and elegant buildings lined the streets—not a single structure could be described as humble. Even the smaller homes looked like they belonged in a European architecture magazine.

The rain still fell, cascading off the pristine roofs and paving the streets with an almost supernatural glow.

I reached the police station. Inside, a bald officer with white hair and a protruding belly looked at me over his glasses.  
— How can I help you, young man? — he asked in a deep, disinterested voice.

— I found a girl by the side of the road, — I said hesitantly.

He frowned.  
— You’re not from around here, are you, friend?

— I’m a trucker. I saw her on the road... Abused and missing a hand.

The officer sighed, as if he’d heard stories like this before.  
— Probably some wild animal.

Wild animal? I thought, confused. It would have to be a massive creature to do all that. But the way he said it so nonchalantly unnerved me.

The wet leather of my jacket, mixed with the iron scent of dried blood, was starting to make me nauseous. The station was cold and smelled of old paper and stale coffee. Outside, the sound of rain mingled with the distant rustling of the cornfield, its presence lingering like an unshakable shadow.

 — What’s your name, friend? — the officer asked casually, though his tone hinted at something more.

— Jhonatan Rodrigues.

— How old are you?

— I’m 20.

— And kids? Anyone who’d miss you?

The question caught me off guard.  
— Yeah... I have a wife and two kids. But why do you ask?

The officer gave a quick, almost awkward smile.  
— Nothing, nothing. Just part of the job. You know, gathering a bit of info here and there. Are you Christian, friend?

— I am. My whole family’s been baptized.

— Ah, good... — He paused, wiping his forehead as if deep in thought. — You’re here to deliver to the mayor, right?

— I think so.

— Alright, I’ll take care of your case. As soon as you unload the delivery, I’ll send a patrol to look for the girl.

— Alright.

I left the station with a strange feeling in my chest. I got into my truck and drove the load to the agreed location. As I navigated through Vale Verde’s streets, something deeply unsettled me. The city was luxurious, but it felt incomplete. There wasn’t a single church.

That struck me. Anywhere else in the country, it’s normal to see churches on every corner, next to bars or supermarkets. There’s always a cross marking the horizon of any small town. But here? Nothing.

I decided to keep my eyes open as I finished the job. I drove through several streets, crossing pristine avenues and perfectly symmetrical squares. The smell of rain mingled with the fresh aroma of flowers that seemed to grow in every garden. But the absence of churches continued to nag at me. Was it just exhaustion? Maybe my eyes were playing tricks on me...

After unloading everything, I returned to the station. The officer greeted me with the same neutral expression as before, but there was something different in his tone now.  
— We didn’t find anyone. — The words came quickly, as if he wanted to end the conversation then and there.

— What do you mean? — I asked, almost in disbelief. — There was a dead girl! She was murdered!

The officer sighed, crossing his arms over his hefty belly.  
— Son, we sent a patrol, searched everywhere. We found nothing. No body, no sign of blood. Maybe you got confused.

The air in the station grew stifling. The smell of stale coffee mixed with the damp leather of my jacket felt stronger. I stared at the officer, trying to figure out if he was messing with me. But his face showed nothing but indifference.

Outside, the rain had stopped, but the sound of the cornfield seemed to echo, even from miles away. The city’s silence was almost supernatural, broken only by the wet boots of officers pacing back and forth. I knew what I had seen. I knew that girl had been there, that someone had hurt her.

— There was nothing. Not a drop of blood, — the officer said, his tone dry and sharp. — Maybe it was a wild animal you hit, and you mistook it for a girl.

— It was a girl! I’m sure of it! — I insisted, my voice rising louder than I intended.

The officer remained still, his heavy, judgmental gaze fixed on me.  
— We didn’t find anything, Mr. Jhonatan. You’d best get on your way. Here in Vale Verde, we don’t like outsiders causing trouble.

There was an uncomfortable pause before he added:  
— I’m sure you understand, especially drunken types like yourself. The stench of booze is reaching me from here.

I froze for a moment, feeling the weight of his words. Then, without another word, I left. I got into my truck, furious at the officer and at everything that seemed wrong with that town. It was nearly morning—probably around five o’clock.

The road was wet, but the rain had stopped, and the sky was beginning to brighten with the first rays of sunlight. As I drove, my mind replayed every detail.  The word the officer had said lingered in my mind. Something about him deeply unsettled me. Why had he asked if anyone would miss me? At the time, the adrenaline had kept me from processing it, but now, calmer, it seemed... sinister. And why did he want to know if I was baptized? The more I thought about it, the stranger it all seemed.

The wind began to pick up, and the endless rows of corn whispered constantly, almost like murmurs. There was something unnerving about that sound, as if the field had a life of its own, an unseen presence watching me. The damp smell of the earth mixed with the fresh scent of rain-soaked plants, creating an oppressive and uncomfortable atmosphere.

Then I passed the spot where I had found the little girl. I slowed down and looked more closely. My heart pounded. There it was—a massive, dark bloodstain, splattered across the asphalt. It was impossible to miss. My stomach turned as I noticed something even more disturbing: drag marks leading from the road into the cornfield.

She had been taken back there.

I stepped out of the truck, the cold morning air biting at my skin. The road was silent, except for the sinister rustling of the corn leaves, which seemed to mock me. I approached the edge of the cornfield, where the blood trails disappeared among the tall, dense stalks. A strong, metallic scent of blood hung in the air, mingling with the sweet, sickly smell of ripened corn.

I hesitated before stepping into the field, but something inside me screamed to stop. The sensation of being watched was almost tangible, as if hundreds of unseen eyes were staring at me through the stalks. The shadows of the cornfield seemed darker than they should have been at that hour, even with the sun rising.

Suddenly, the wind picked up, tossing the plants wildly in every direction. The sound was deafening, like a chorus of whispers spreading around me. My feet felt glued to the ground, but my instincts finally took over. I ran back to the truck, stumbling over my own legs, my breath quick and my heart pounding like a drum.

Once inside the cab, slamming the door shut, I felt momentarily safe. I glanced in the rearview mirror; the cornfield seemed still again, but I knew... something was there. Something that didn’t want to be seen.

As I sped down the road, one question hammered in my mind:  
**What’s really happening in Vale Verde?**
