I love urban exploring—the look and feel of old, dusty, crumbling buildings that time left behind. Old factories, office spaces, and department stores are all great, but my favorite type of abandoned buildings are asylums. The look and, for lack of a better word, aura of them—their decrepitude mixed with their dark history—really does it for me.

Urban exploration is my favorite pastime, so much so that when I’m not doing it, I consume as much content about it as I possibly can. Everyone in this community knows Exploring with Josh, but I also love channels like URBEX HILL and ActionAdventureTwins. I’ve even watched videos in languages I don’t understand just to see new environments.

But I’m getting sidetracked.

I recently came across an unsolved missing persons case with an urbex twist. There’s an abandoned asylum in Rochester, New York, known as The Terrence Building—a 16-story monster of a building. It was officially closed in 1995 due to “a broader closure of several buildings at the now-named Rochester Psychiatric Center, due to declining patient populations and a shift towards newer, smaller facilities,” according to Google. But in reality, it was most likely shut down due to multiple allegations of patient abuse—reports of individuals being labeled “lost causes” and deemed “impossible to reintegrate into society.” They treated those people like prisoners.

I’m from Rochester and have explored a lot in the area—the old Kodak buildings, the Beech-Nut factory, the abandoned parts beneath the Rundel Library—but never this place. So, I did the only thing that seemed logical: I went to Reddit and started asking questions.

First, I posted in r/Rochester to see if anyone knew about the case. No reply. Then I tried r/urbanexploration and r/Urbex. Still nothing. But when I asked in r/abandoned, I got something interesting. A user named RustySteele DMed me a video file and nothing else. No “hi” or “hello”—just the file.

I downloaded it, watched it, and now I’ve decided to relay the important information here.

I’ll do my best to provide as much detail as I feel is necessary. The video shows a group of four individuals—22-year-old Vincent Brown, 16-year-old Aiden Caster, 21-year-old Maxine Caster, and the person recording, 22-year-old Brayden Steele. The footage is dated November 21st, 2022. From what I understand, this recording is the last known trace of their whereabouts.

The footage begins with the group standing outside the building’s main entrance while Brayden gives his channel intro.



(B) "Hello, hello, hello, YouTube! You are exploring with Brayden, and today we are checking out one of Rochester’s most infamous abandoned buildings—Terrence Tower! I'm joined today by the gang as usual: Vinny, Aiden, and Maxine."

(V) "What’s goodie, YouTuuuuube?"

(A) "What's up, guys!"

Maxine doesn’t say anything and just waves to the camera.

(B) "I don’t know much about this place, but I do know there’s one very specific room we have to check out... the Choke Room. From what I understand, it was used to torture patients that the staff considered ‘misbehaving,’ which was just one of many reasons this place was shut down, I’d assume. Anyway, guys, let's get exploring!"




The first handful of minutes are rather boring. The group makes their way through the building, looking at all the graffiti and destruction caused by time and vandals. While watching, it became very apparent that Aiden did not want to be there. Neither did Vincent—but for different reasons. Aiden seemed unsettled by the whole thing, while Vincent was dismissive of the entire ordeal.

(B) "Man, guys, this place is freaky. There are motivational—and I say that very loosely—quotes on the wall over here that say, ‘Today is the first day of the rest of your life.’ ‘Watch your attitude. It’s the first thing people notice about you.’ That last one feels more like a warning than anything."

(A) "Yeah, dude, super freaky. Being locked up in a place like this, being tortured and stuff... man, I couldn't imagine."

(V) "Don’t be such a pussy. It’s not like they picked people off the street—only lunatics and crazies were locked up here. Better here than out with us."

(M) "You're such a dick, Vinny. This place has seen so much suffering and carries so much negative energy—I’d watch what you say."

(B) "Stop arguing, guys. We have 16 floors to get through, and I think we should start with... the morgue!"




The group starts walking toward the morgue, and this is when the first interesting thing happens. As they walk, they all start gagging and coughing.

(B) "Holy shit, this hall stinks. You guys smell that?"

(A) "It smells like, like—"

(M) "Rotting meat."

Vincent is coughing and gagging so hard that he’s very clearly about to vomit.

(V) "Jesus Christ."

(B) "This place has been closed since—"

Brayden walks over to a counter with leftover pill and medicine bottles sprawled out.

(B) "1995. But this smell is fresh. It smells like fresh death. This is some weird shit, guys."

Vincent walks over to the wall of refrigeration units and reaches for one that’s partially ajar. At this point, I was leaning into my monitor.

(V) "The smell seems like it's coming from here."

When Vincent opens it, he immediately bends over, looking like he's going to vomit.

(M) "There's... nothing in there. But the smell is definitely coming from that unit. I don’t like this at all, guys."

(A) "Can we please get out of this room? I can’t stand the smell anymore."

(B) "Vinny, you good, man? Or is this all too much for your little baby stomach?"

This part was actually pretty funny—Brayden starts laughing and gagging while Vinny is still recovering from almost puking.

(V) "I'm fine. Just wasn’t expecting the smell to be so pungent. Let’s keep moving."

(M) "You sure you’re okay, babe?"

(V) "I said I’m fine. I just want to leave this room."

After that, the group starts to leave until the second strange thing happens.

(A) "Hey guys, did you hear that? I swear I just heard something. Like... a moan. Or a sigh. I don’t know, but it definitely sounded like a person."

(B) "Nah, man, I didn’t hear anything. Maxine, Vinny, did you?"

(V) "I didn't hear shit. He’s just tryna scare us. It’s not gonna work, dork."

Maxine smacks Vincent on the back of his head so hard I thought he was gonna fall over.

(M) "I told you to stop being a douche. If Aiden says he heard something, then he heard something. Let’s just keep our ears open and keep moving. I can’t handle this stench anymore."

After that, there are several more minutes of wandering. Brayden shows countless empty rooms—very small rooms that looked more like cells, fitting. But after the wandering, they arrive at what used to be the cafeteria.

Now this is where things start to change. Braydens attitude more or less takes a 180. Before he wasn't dissimilar to your run of the mill Youtuber. But once they got to the cafe something changed.

(B) "Alright, gang, looks like we made it into the cafe, and it's—what was that?  "

(M) " what was what B? I didn't hear anything."

(B) " I can still hear it. It sounds like whispering, Max."

(M) “ Well i don't hear anything."

(B) “ It sounds like school lunch. It's just voices.” 

(V) “Nah man I don't hear anything either.”

All four of them are still in frame just standing, but the camera is shaking. Very aggressively, and I could hear Brayden hyperventilating. Then he just stops, he stops shaking, he stops breathing heavily. The other 3 turn to look at him and they all have a concerned look on their faces. And not a normal concern it was a more horrified concern, but no one said anything.

After that, Vincent heads off-screen along with Maxine, while Brayden continues filming with Aiden in frame. Aiden looks absolutely terrified, who wouldn't be after that. As Vincent and Maxines voices grow distant and indistinguishable, Aiden finally says something.

(A) “ B-Brayden are you okay? You're as white as a ghost.”

(B) “I don't know. I don't know. I think so, where's Vinny and Max?”

(A) “They walked into the kitchen i think?”

(B) “ Well let's go. I don't want to be in This room any longer than I have to be.” 

Aiden and Brayden head Into the kitchen, The voices of Vincent and Maxine start to become clearer as they seem to be in mid conversation. Brayden stops right before The kitchen door and just stands behind it. He halts Aiden from going in and shushes him.

(M) “I knew it! I knew there was something wrong here, what the fuck just happened to B?” 

(V) “ Honestly I don't believe it. He's doing all this for his stupid video that nobody is going to watch. He's scaring you and Aiden and I don't think it's funny at all.”

(M) “Don't say that. I don't think B would go this far for a stupid video. What I do think is that we need to get out of here”

At this point, Brayden starts to breathe heavily again and starts muttering to himself. I can't make out what he's saying but he clearly is upset at what he's hearing. He shoves the camera into Aidens hands and barges into the kitchen.

(B) “ You guys think I'm making it up? I know what the fuck is heard. It's not just for some ‘stupid’ video. Fuck you guys.”

(M) “No B we didn't-”

Brayden storms out of the kitchen while Maxine tries pleading her case. This is the last time Brayden is shown on camera. Vincent, Maxine and our new camera man Aiden are left speechless. Aiden sets the camera down and walks up to Maxine.

End of part one.
