My name is Neo. I have been working for Nasa for about six years now which is rather impressive as I am only 26. When I first joined this company I had absolutely no idea of what I was getting myself into and what I am about to tell you might be some of the most confidential knowledge in this realm of existence. 

After my third year of hard work for nasa, I had built myself an esteemed reputation throughout the establishment. I had won employee of the week countless times and had never missed a day at work. I took my job very seriously as I had nothing going for me anywhere else. I had no family nor did I have friends. I have spent my entire life being and introvert and pushing those close to me away through my selfish means. Of course I had no intention of being discourteous or unkind, but I had never been shown love by anyone so I had no way of knowing how to grant it. 

I lived alone with my dog whom I often forgot to feed and lived off of frozen pizza. 

As you can probably tell, my high intelligence was the only reason why I still possessed the will to live. Precisely for this reason is why I volunteered to be the first man to travel outside of our solar system. The aim of this mission was to study time dilation. Time dilation is the slowing of time as perceived by one observer compared with another, depending on their relative motion or positions in a gravitational field. In this case, I would be traveling to a planet which has a very close proximity to a black hole which causes an extreme time dilation, where one hour on the distant planet equals 7 years on Earth.

I was definitely nervous for this mission, who wouldn’t be? But I knew that I was the right person to partake in this historical event. 

Takeoff was about to happen, as I ascended the stairs to get into the metallic grey rocket cockpit, I could hear the applause of my colleagues that I knew I would never see again after this mission. 

“FIVE, FOUR, THREE, TWO” silence. The sound of the rocket engines was so loud the volume turned to a hush and tranquility. As I look out the solitary window on my right, I saw the shadow of the spacecraft tower over the cumulus clouds which looked like fluffy, white cotton balls in the sky. I took one last breath of air before sleeping gas was released into the cockpit of the craft to save food and resources for when we get to planet X Æ A-Xii.

When I finally opened my eyes after 16 years of what NASA refers to as hyper hibernation I found myself within orbit of the panthalassic planet located at around one light year away from a stellar-mass black hole in the range of 50 to 55 solar masses.

After having followed protocol I prepared for landing. My years of training all lead up to this moment. If I had missed this, it would have been the most expensive mistake in the history of mankind. 

My rocket module had a descent rocket engine to slow it down, drop into a lower orbit and then hover over the surface. Guided by a landing radar, I piloted my ship semi-manually using four clusters of rockets to finally touchdown in the sea of tranquility. 

I was paralyzed with happiness when I realised that I had done the hardest step of the mission. I was truly ecstatic. I quickly realised that I had very little time to celebrate as I was on a strict time frame as every hour spent on this planet equaled to 7 years on earth. I quickly gathered my samples for scientific research and took a great quantity of photos and videos of the strange blue planet. 

This planet was a waterworld, covered in a seemingly endless, shallow ocean. The planet's gravity was greatly punishing at 130% of Earth's, forcing human astronauts to move slowly and with some difficulty while on its surface. This made my mission even harder as I had lost a lot of my strength in my hibernation period on the prolonged journey here. As my timer was getting increasingly close to zero, I knew I had to go. 

I rushed back into my space shuttle after having done everything on my checklist, performed the extensive routine checks and fired up the rockets, except, they gave in and refused to turn on. This was catastrophic for my mission and I had no way of calling for help as I was thousands of light years away so I knew that the only thing I could do was sort this problem out in a solitary state. 

Hours passed without me being able to find the solution to such a calamitous problem until the most excellent and judicious idea hit me. 

I knew that the major components of a rocket engine are therefore the combustion chamber (thrust chamber), pyrotechnic igniter, propellant feed system, valves, regulators, the propellant tanks, and the rocket engine nozzle. I had made a fatal mistake of checking them all except for the pyrotechnic igniter. 

After making this realization I quickly got to work. After a short but fatally needed 10 minutes of work I fixed the issue meaning that I could head back home.

As I headed back into my quarters, realisation hit me harder than a bus. Thoughts of what the world was going to be like after such a prolonged amount of time and if I would ever to see my dog again. 

Next thing I knew I was fast asleep on my way back home. 

I opened my eyes for a second time coming out of my long sleep, to the pleasuring sight of home. The auto land feature that the team back in nasa headquarters had designed and engineered had worked perfectly. 

Just as planned I had landed just outside of New York City for everyone to see the finalization of this historic mission except as I peeked outside of my window, there was no one. I was greeted with immensely large divots which looked like they originated from nuclear weapons of some sorts. The entire landscape was deserted which was very odd as my calibrated calendar was reading that it was winter. 

As I walked out of my shuttle it greatly felt like my legs could not withstand my weight but I knew that I had to push through. The city was only a five mile walk away but with my muscles being almost invisible, it felt like an eternity. 

After an hour of painful slow walking, my GPS read that I had arrived at time square. I had, except all I could see was rubble for as far as I looked.
