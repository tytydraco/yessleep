Mom is selling our home. She's been struggling with grief, and it reminds her of everything she'd lost. And she needs the money, too. As much as it pains me, I think it's for the best. I think dad would want that too.



Yesterday I came over to help with the packing. As usual, mom started doing everything by herself without telling me. She managed to clean out most of the rooms. I was surprised how our home could look even emptier. It looked so naked without the furniture I used to hate as a kid. I even missed my cheeky pictures which were plastered all over the walls. What is left now are discolored walls, scratched floors, dust, and some mold. We even discovered my secret popcorn stash I forgot about (every time I ate popcorn, I'd put those unpopped pieces behind the fridge, no idea why). After the whole house was more or less done, it was time for the hardest part. 



My parents' bedroom was left untouched. Mom couldn't go inside and had been sleeping on the couch for the past four days. I went there alone. It felt like stepping into a time capsule of dad. Everything was in its place, as it always was. His clothes, his papers, his everything. All that was missing was dad bashing me for not wearing my slippers. I choked on the smell of his cheap cologne. It was still lingering in the air. It was suffocating, but I wanted to inhale everything while I still could. I felt like I was about to lose that too, and then I'd be left with nothing. 



I started by cleaning out the drawers. In the first one, I saw his quite impressive calendar collection and his favorite watch, the one he got for his 50th birthday. I decided to take it with me. It's funny how they say that clocks stop working when somebody dies. This one was still ticking. Time didn't stop for dad.



Every item I packed away was like erasing him a little more. I hated that. I hated how there were so many things he just abandoned. The second drawer contained his reading glasses, his eczema medicine he never took, his keys, his old calculatorâ€¦ Were they even his to belong with? I carefully studied each thing, as if giving them a proper goodbye. You served well.



The third drawer seemed stuck, but it wasn't unusual. When I was younger, my parents hid my things in there when I misbehaved, since it was impossible to open for a child. After some shuffling and accidentally pulling off the handle, I managed to get it open by sticking my fingers underneath and lifting it up a bit. I saw some of my old treasures, and, hell yeah, more popcorn. My eyes were swallowing all the memories, and I didn't even realize I was smiling. I was digging through the goods and chuckling at how I got in trouble for every single one of them. But then my eyes landed on a thing I didn't immediately recognize.



The toy phone.



I picked it up and studied it carefully. It was a rather small, pink, and plastic Hello Kitty flip phone. I grinned as I saw the letter K had been crossed out and replaced with T. No wonder they put it in the drawer. I was about to put it away when I suddenly remembered there was more to the story.



I don't recall who gave it to me, but I do remember playing with it. I used to smash all the buttons and listen to those poorly recorded sounds until they sounded demonic because of low battery, or I'd pretend to call my husband (who at that time was surely Diego from Ice Age). But by far my favorite activity was to dial real numbers.



I probably tried to call 911 several times out of pure curiosity, but it thankfully never worked. One time, I dialed our landline phone. And our phone actually rang. I anxiously picked up the handset, but all I was met with was static. I waited for less than 5 seconds before putting it down and running to tell my parents. I wanted to show them, so I dialed our number again. Mom left after the first failed attempt, but dad stayed. He always did. I tried for the second time and it worked. I was so happy when dad looked at me all surprised. He picked up the handset, and cautiously said *'..Hello?'*. I moved closer to him so I could see his reaction. He looked at me with furrowed eyebrows and was about to end the call when we heard someone speaking.



It was a monotone male voice. I remember it said some numbers, very slowly. Dad asked *"Uh... Hello?...What are-"* before we heard the dial tone. Dad put the handset down and got angry. He said something about the Chinese government, and bills, and my nasty sense of humor. That was the last time I saw my Hello Titty phone. 



That is, until now. I slowly opened the phone, and to much surprise, a crumpled yellow scrap of paper flew out of it. I raised it to my eyes. It read *'4-8-1-8'* in my dad's handwriting. Probably the same number dad heard that day. I unconsciously furrowed my eyebrows, but it didn't ring any bells. I put the paper in my pocket just in case and continued my cleaning. 



And then it struck me. This piece of paper had to come from my dad's calendar. He used only those with yellowed pages - they were easier on his eyes. I frantically searched through the boxes. That must've been a date. That idea gave me some stupid kind of hope. Maybe dad wanted to leave a message? I found his calendar collection and decided to open the one from 2018. It was a neat and surely practical book bound with dark, worn leather. I opened it up to April. But to my surprise, there was no entry on the 8th. I then checked August 4th, just to be sure. Nothing. No 'I will love you forever, Dad'. I closed the book. I knew it sounded too good to be true. I wanted to put it in the box again, but it wouldn't fit with everything scattered around. Maybe I was just desperate, grasping at any sign that he was still here, trying to reach out. I pushed the calendar aside and started gathering the scattered papers, something else caught my eye. It was another old calendar. 



This one was from the year 2011. It was in a far worse condition than the previous one, probably the worst one of them all. Judging by its wavy pages, dad must've used it as a hot pad. I opened it cautiously, trying not to cause any further damage. I don't know what I was hoping to find. I flipped through the pages and read every piece of dad. Dentist appointments, birthdays, weekend plans. Every entry was a glimpse into our past. Something that had once seemed so ordinary now felt like precious memories. And then, my heart skipped a beat. 



*'4-8-1-8??'* - it was the only thing he wrote on a Tuesday, July 5th. The page was missing its bottom corner - the very piece that's now in my pocket. So that was the day of the call. I tried looking for some more clues, but to no surprise, I found nothing. I took a deep breath and pushed the nagging number to the back of my mind as I packed up the remaining items. 



Finished with the packing, I pulled out my adult phone. I completely forgot what I wanted to do the moment I saw a notification. It was about some scammy limited-time offers: *'JUST TWO MORE DAYS TO GET FREE SHIPPING!'*. I could feel my head starting to throb as I went on a site that would do the math for me. 



My dad died on the 4818th day since the phone call.
