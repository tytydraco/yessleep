Every neighbourhood has a place children are warned never to cross. A tunnel, a fence, a creek, sometimes just a street or an abandoned house. A line drawn in fear, and if you dare step past it, something bad will take you.

In my town, the forbidden zone was a decommissioned storm drain at the edge of town.

The story went that something lived inside it, something that might once have been a man. It would come out at night and prowl the nearby streets, searching for children. Once it found one, it would shove the child into a large burlap sack and drag it back into the bowels of the drain, where it would devour them whole, leaving barely anything behind. sometimes a shoe. Sometimes a tooth. others, just a fingernail.

As children, we believed every word of it.

It became a common dare to see who was brave enough to approach the drain, or even step inside it. And truth be told, the kids who took that challenge too far tended to go missing. Everyone said they’d fallen victim to the Bag Man. Things got so bad that a curfew was issued, parents panicked, and eventually the drain was sealed off. After that, the disappearances stopped, and life returned to normal.

Children were safe again.

Of course, as adults, we told ourselves the truth was simpler and far less supernatural. Storm drains are dangerous places. Dark, slick, confusing mazes where a child could fall, get lost, drown, or break a neck without needing any monster at all. That was what I believed. That was what I told myself for years.

Until I finally went in myself.

It had been a long time since I’d come back home, years since I’d even thought about the drain. I was standing on my parent's porch one evening, watching the sun sink behind the hills, when I noticed a faint glimmer in the distance. Too far away to make out clearly, but I knew exactly where it was coming from.

The drain.

I stood there longer than I meant to, staring at that distant flicker of reflected light, chuckling to myself as I remembered the stories. That was when the worst idea I’ve ever had crossed my mind.

“Hey, Hunter! Want to do something cool?” I called into the house.

A few seconds later, a smiling face appeared at the doorway. “What are we doing, Uncle Micah?” he asked, adjusting the Lakers cap perched on his head.

“We’re going on an adventure,” I said, and his face lit up immediately. “But don’t tell your mom. It’s a secret.”

He nodded eagerly as I handed him my pinky, sealing the pact like it was sacred.

I ran to the garage and rummaged around until I found two flashlights, a bolt cutter, and an old hard hat. I gave the helmet to Hunter, and he proudly set it over his cap like it was armor. At the time, I told myself this was about bonding, about making memories. I’d missed most of his childhood because of work, and despite being older than my sister, life hadn’t blessed me with children of my own.

It was a stupid decision. I know that now.

We headed down the street toward the drain as dusk bled into night. The last of the daylight vanished behind the hills, leaving the area bathed in the sickly yellow glow of aging streetlamps. Hunter skipped beside me, already flicking his flashlight over every crack in the pavement, narrating his discoveries with excitement. I smiled, even as something tight coiled in my stomach.

The drain was blocked by a large wooden fence, mostly rotted through with age. I told Hunter to step back while I pried away a panel wide enough for us to slip through. As soon as we did, the stench hit us — stale water, rust, and something sour beneath it.

“Pew!” Hunter exclaimed, and I laughed, though the smell clung to the back of my throat.

Beyond that was a second barrier: a rusted metal fence bolted directly over the mouth of the drain. Attached to it was a warning sign that had once been bright yellow, though now only a corner of paint remained. The word DANGER was still embossed in the metal, visible when my flashlight passed over it.

I should have listened.

While Hunter played with his light, I used the bolt cutter to carve out an opening. The metal groaned and snapped louder than I liked, each sound echoing down into the darkness. Eventually, we squeezed through.

The moment I stepped inside, the hairs on the back of my neck stood up. A strange buzzing filled my chest, like static just under my skin, and adrenaline flushed through me without reason.

“What is this place?” Hunter asked, his voice smaller now as he moved deeper into the tunnel.

“It’s just an old drainage pipe,” I said, trying to sound casual. “Pretty neat, right?”

He didn’t answer right away. Our footsteps echoed unnaturally, overlapping and stretching until it sounded like someone else was walking with us.

“I don’t know,” he finally said, his voice wavering.

“It’s fine,” I replied, resting a hand on his shoulder. He yelped in surprise, dropping his flashlight. It clattered to the ground and went dark.

The sudden loss of light made the darkness feel thick, almost wet, as if it had weight to it, pressing against my eyes and skin. For a heartbeat, I couldn’t move, my brain lagging behind the instinct to panic. I dropped to one knee, fumbling blindly, my fingers brushing cold concrete before closing around the flashlight. I smacked it once against my palm, then again, harder this time, the hollow sound echoing down the tunnel. Nothing. A third smack finally coaxed it back to life, the beam sputtering weakly before stabilising.

As the light returned, something deep within the tunnel shifted.

It wasn’t loud. It wasn’t even clear. Just a subtle displacement, like water disturbed far away, but it was enough to make my stomach clench. My mouth went dry, the taste of metal and ash coating my tongue, and I realised I’d stopped breathing. I forced air back into my lungs slowly, carefully, as if any sudden movement might draw attention.

“Maybe that’s enough adventure for today,” I said, my voice higher than I meant it to be as I handed the flashlight back to Hunter. He didn’t argue. He didn’t joke. He just nodded, tight and quick, gripping the light with both hands like it was a lifeline.

For a few seconds, there was nothing but the drip of water and the echo of our breathing. I started to convince myself it had been nothing, that fear had filled in the gaps where reason should have been.

Then I heard it.

Footsteps.

Not a scuffle. Not a scrape. Measured, deliberate steps echoing from deep within the tunnel, each one landing with enough weight to carry through the concrete. They came slow at first, spaced far apart, like whatever was walking didn’t need to hurry.

Every nerve in my body screamed at once.

“Run outside. Now,” I shouted.

Hunter didn’t hesitate. His footsteps pounded away from me, frantic and uneven, shrinking rapidly as he fled toward the opening. I swung the flashlight back into the darkness, the beam jittering as my hands shook. “Who’s there?” I called, my voice cracking despite my effort to steady it.

The light swept across bare walls, pooled water, rust-stained concrete. Nothing moved. No shape. No sound beyond the distant drip and the fading echo of my nephew’s escape.

I let out a shaky laugh, forcing air through clenched teeth. “You’re being stupid,” I muttered. “It’s just a rat. Or pipes settling.”

I turned to call Hunter back, already rehearsing how I’d laugh this off later, when something landed beside me with a wet, meaty splash, like a heavy sack dropped into a shallow puddle.

The sound was too close.

I turned.

The beam caught a face inches from mine. Skin stretched grey and slick over bone, eyes sunken and bloodshot, reflecting the light like those of an animal caught in headlights. Its mouth split into a grin far too wide, teeth blackened and broken, the stink of rot rolling off it in waves.

I tried to scream, but a hand closed around my throat before sound could escape, fingers digging in with impossible strength. The world tilted as it shoved me back, my spine slamming into the damp wall hard enough to rattle my teeth. Air vanished from my lungs as the grip tightened.

From the corner of my eye, I saw the burlap sack resting against the tunnel floor. The bottom of it was soaked dark, stiff with old stains that glistened wetly in the flashlight’s glow.

I thrashed uselessly, my hands clawing at its wrist, my boots scraping against the concrete for purchase. It leaned closer, close enough that I could see the cracks in its skin, the filth caked into every fold. The smell was overwhelming — decay, stagnant water, something sweet and sickly beneath it all. It sniffed me once, then again, slow and deliberate, before dragging its tongue across my cheek.

The touch was cold and slick. I gagged.

“Too ripe,” it gurgled, its voice bubbling like water forced through mud.

The pressure vanished as suddenly as it had come. I hit the ground hard, air crashing back into my lungs in a painful rush. I didn’t look back. I didn’t think. I ran.

I burst through the fence, grabbed Hunter, and didn’t stop until we were back at my parents’ house. My clothes clung to me, soaked through with sweat, my chest burning with every breath. Hunter sobbed into my shoulder, his small body shaking.

My sister came running out, snatching him from my arms, her face twisted with fear and fury. She never asked what happened. Hunter never understood what he’d almost been part of, and I kept my mouth shut, clinging to the hope that silence might seal the nightmare away.

It didn’t.

The next day, Hunter was gone. His cap was found near the old drain.

After that, the disappearances started again.
