 

I learned this the hard way.

A couple of years ago, I was walking with my buddy, Nick, we had just come from a bar a couple of blocks back. Since we were drunk, we didn’t drive. (Mind you Uber wasn’t as well known as it is now.) So we decided to walk through the small forest, it would’ve led us to our apartment. 

I regret this.

As Nick was talking about his new job at the Pizza place, I heard a soft rustling in the trees, I constantly had to blink my eyes to adjust to the dark. When I tried to look up, I squinted, but there was nothing. 

I brushed it off, I had always been afraid of the dark, so that probably didn’t help when I was walking in the woods, at the latest of nights. 

“Hey, are you listening to me? I need your help figuring this out.” Nick nudged against me, waiting for my answer.

I quickly responded, “Yeah sure, that’s good, right?”

His eyebrows lowered, “What are you talking about, they are giving me lower pay than what they said, how is that good.?”

I paused, not knowing what to say next. My mind started to race, the pitch darkness, Nick yelling at me, it was like I was having a panic attack.

“Just shut up Nick!” I yelled, and my heavy breathing followed soon after.

Nick stared at me blankly, he pushed me away.

“See you at the apartment..”

I reached my hand out, “Nick, come on! I didn’t mean it. I’m a drunk dude.”

He ran off, I was alone in the woods, and my heart was racing a lot faster than before. I sat down to take a couple of breaths. Then it happened.

Screaming was all I could hear, it felt like it was happening right next to me.

“N-Nick? Nick!”

I jumped up, I ran to where I heard it.

“Nick? Are you there man? Come on, this isn’t funny!” My eyes were wide open, I looked all around me.

Though, the familiar rustling in the trees got to me. Plus, my being drunk and already scared, that’s probably why I started to tear up a bit. 

It sounded like clicking noises, like the sound you’d make to call a dog to you as if something wanted me to come near it. I grabbed my phone out of my pocket and called Nick’s phone.

It was up in the trees, and as soon as the light flashed and the dinging started, something jumped from the tree.

I had always read creepypasta stories, like any kid from the 2000s. This felt like that. 

Only worse.

I turned on my flashlight on the phone and started to swing it all around, sometimes, I’d catch a glimpse of something, jumping from the trees. The clicking sound continued, something still wanted me to come near it.

I had enough, I started to run through the forest and got to the end of the forest.

“Finally, I’m done with this.”

That wasn’t the case. A sharp tendril grabbed me by the collar of my shirt and swung me up into the trees, I still had my light on, so when I finally crashed down on the branches, I saw it.

It looked like a spider, only with 2, human-like eyes, and far more than eight legs, the mandibles were sharp, and it didn’t look like they were meant to be there. They looked old, and like the bone of someone's arm. It was camouflaged, green and black, and red blotches also covered it.

It still clicked, now, it felt like it was taunting me, instead of luring me. It revealed its mouth under the mandibles, it was like a person, with small, kid-like teeth inside.

I was frozen with fear, it slowly wrapped me up in webs, I wanted to run, but if I did, it probably wouldn’t have let me stay alive like this.

“Nick. He was killed by it… No…” I wished we hadn’t walked through the woods, we would’ve had a better chance of drunk driving than this.

“Please,” I begged, I knew it couldn’t hear me, but I tried.

Its legs went across my face. Slightly caressing it, telling me to not cry, to not talk. I still had my phone on, I started to dial 911 while on the web, the ringing made its eyes shoot up, and it ran off.

I quickly burst out of the web, I jumped down the tree, and all I could think was the thought of getting home. I ran out into the street and got to my apartment.

It took me a minute to get my bearings, I tried to call the cops, but they didn’t believe me. After a couple of weeks of Nick being gone, they came to me.

“You were the last one to see him, what happened?” The Investigator asked me, my hands twitching, thinking of the night.

By that time, I had moved away, a little further to my parent's house, and away from the forest.

“I already told you, something took him! You found his phone in the forest, it was in the trees.”

I knew he had passed and was dead. I haven’t forgotten that the last person he talked to was me, and the mistake of me staring off blankly was the thing that cost him his life.

“You said a spider took him?” He showed me the records of my call to the police.

“Yeah, and no one listened, I’m done with this..” I ran out of the station and went back to my new apartment. That night, I couldn’t sleep, it was clicking, the clicking…

Though, when I finally drifted off, the clicking started, it was outside.

From that point on, I haven’t heard it or someone talking about the thing since. I’ve been thinking about a name, but haven’t come up with anything.

The police have contacted me a few times, and my family of Nick still hates me and blocked me on everything, but I know what happened that night.

I wish I had killed it, that’s why I have a gun with me and carry it everywhere.

If that thing ever comes near me again, I won’t let it live, I’m not gonna let something like this happen to someone else. 

If you have seen something like this, don't hesitate to get in touch with me or link me to the source, I need to see what they have encountered. I don’t know where the spider-thing is, or what happened to it, I hope it’s dead, I pray every night for it to be. 

Thanks for listening, I needed to get this off my chest, it’s been a couple of years now so I have (mostly) gotten over it. Hope you guys have a good day, and when the night is there, sleep tight.

Don’t let the bed bugs bite.
