It was the beginning of a day I would never forget. I could hear the sound of waves lapping against the shore and felt a cool breeze against my skin. My eyes flashed open as I jerked my head off the ground. Holy shit I'm outside and, NAKED?!! There was a young man jogging down the shoreline right towards me! I jumped to my feet and tried to cover myself with my hands the best I could.  
"Miss, are you ok?" the man inquired as he caught his breath.  
"No, I'm NOT ok! Please believe me, I have no idea why I am here or how this happened."  
He looked away as he cleared his throat.  
"Those are some nasty scratches on your back. You probably feel a little disoriented, but that's to be expected. This must be your first time."  
"First time? What the hell are you talking about!"  
"Don’t move, I’ll be right back.”  
And off he went as quickly as he came. I squatted down as low as I could, hoping no one else could see me. There was nothing around to hide behind. Do I just say ‘screw it’ and make a mad dash for cover? In a moment the man returned holding a flowered sheet. Stopping a few feet from me, he held it out, looking away as I reached to take it. I quickly wrapped myself and thanked him. There was a large scar down the side of his face but he had very attractive eyes. Tight faded blue jeans were low on his waist and his hair moved with the breeze.  
"Hopefully those people won't miss their sheet. I think you need it more than they do" he chuckled. "My name is Rex, Rex Bennet."  
I forced myself to smile. "I'm Carie."  
"Carie... That's a cute name. I know this is a strange way to meet, but I knew something must be wrong."  
"Wait a minute, now I remember!"  
“What do you remember?" he said as he scratched the back of his head.  
"This is a camping trip! I came here to go camping with my friend Brenda. We were sitting by the fire when suddenly something big crashed through the bushes and pounced on us. I heard a painful scream as it sunk it's teeth into Brenda. I remember running so fast that I thought my heart was going to explode. Then I woke up like this!"  
"I can't imagine how terrified you must have been. I feel just awful about your friend, but please, you can't tell anyone about this."  
"Why?"  
"You were probably infected by those scratches on your back. Carie, have you ever heard of a, werewolf?"  
"You're crazy! That's just in stupid movies!”  
"Listen, I know, because it happened to me too.”  
"What are you saying? You think I changed into one of those dreadful creatures?!!"  
"Do you have another explanation for waking up naked?"  
"Oh SHIT!"  
"You should stay away from your camp site. You don't need to see that. Let's go over to the cabin I rented, and I'll try to explain."  
We were walking close to each other, and even though we had just met, I could feel a strange attraction. My mind was racing, but I had no clue what to say to him. We walked without speaking until we arrived at group of rustic cabins. He turned and brushed his hand across my forehead, tucking my hair behind my ear and without warning he leaned in to kiss me. Like a fool, I instinctively put my arms around him. That was a big mistake, because the sheet fell to the ground. He paused just short of the kiss.  
"Sweetheart we better get you inside." he said as he quickly snatched up the sheet and threw it across my shoulders. The door was held open for me as we entered the cabin.  
"Here, please sit on the couch, I'll get you something to drink."  
He came back with a Pepsi and an oversized shirt that I quickly put on. He sat sat down beside me. Why was I trembling? I looked into his eyes and could feel myself getting aroused as he spoke to me. I wanted him so desperately.  
I could no longer restrain myself and pushed him to the floor. We wrestled for dominance, scratching, biting and kissing as we tore each other's clothes off. It felt like I was on fire when dark hair started appearing all over me, then everything faded to black. I woke up naked again and found myself on the floor beside him. Quietly getting up, I slipped the big shirt back on and tiptoed outside. Moments later the door opened and he peered out.  
"Please let me explain." he pleaded.  
"Get the fuck away from me! What the hell happened in there?!!"  
"Now calm down, normally it's the full moon that causes the transformation, but strong emotions can trigger it too."  
I felt like ripping his damn throat out, but part of me found him irresistible. I was so confused.  
"Let's go for a walk back down by the lake." he said in a calm voice. He quickly got dressed and we started towards the water.  
"Listen Carie, I know this is a lot to take in. When it's time for a full moon, I usually try to get away from the city. That's why I'm here at this campground, because when you transform, the animal instincts take over. You don't have any memory of your time as a wolf."  
Just then I heard police sirens. Had someone discovered the campsite? Shit! I was so caught up in this insane mess that I forgot all about it. Rex grabbed my hand.  
"We need to get back to the cabin!" he said sternly.  
Both of us started running. Damn I could go like the wind! As soon as Rex shut the cabin door he said we needed to leave. I helped him throw a few things in his Mercedes and we were gone. I felt like a criminal on the run, what kind of a life will this be. I sat there quietly watching the telephone poles go by.  
"Rex, if they search the camp site they will find my things, my drivers license, home address, shit, everything!"  
"Please will you just relax, they won't find you. They will never find you. For all they know, you died with your friend. It will probably be on the news, two teens tragically killed by a bear while camping at Green Lake."  
"But where will I go, what will I do?" Rex reached over and took my hand.  
"Listen, I have a friend that can get you a new identity, and it would be safer if you would remain with me for a while."  
"It looks like I have no choice." I mumbled.  
"Have you ever been to Paris?"  
"What?!"  
"I own a small jet that can get us there in a few hours. Carie, your life is not over, it's just beginning."
