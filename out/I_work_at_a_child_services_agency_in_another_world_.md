I guess it only makes sense to preface this by saying I *know* there’s another world out there. I’ve seen parts of it myself, and I incorporate its existence into my work. It's probably that world from which you're reading this. But personally, I’m stuck here, in mine. Not so much as part of a universal trap holding me in, but more-so out of a personal necessity. You see, from the time I was old enough to form actual memories, I saw the horrors of the environment around me. A world where the sky is a gloomy black and blue all the time, where murder and narcotics were a commonplace in society, and child neglect was to be expected. It was for this reason that I knew as I got older that I had to do something about it.

I run a child services agency in order to try and combat this. I myself was a victim of parents who most of the time had trouble remembering I needed to be fed and given proper clothing. But in a strange way, I got used to my circumstances. I spent most of my time stealing food from any markets that hadn't already been ransacked, finding people decent enough to give me an odd job, and reading any books I could find to teach myself the normal ways of living. Of course, in my world the "normal" ways of living were the rarest. But I digress.

At my agency, there's no more than me, a middle aged idealist, a young woman of twenty-five who happens to share in my desires to help children called Sierra, and an alcoholic sixty-year-old who keeps up on maintenance for peanuts. We work inside of a rented police station converted into a small office, and that's how it's been for the past five years. But a few nights ago, I faced my biggest challenge. One that made me consider quitting, and yet, reinforced my moral compass to keep fighting for the youth here, since no one else will do what I do.

It was about 10:30 when I got the call. One child, female, couldn’t be no older than four, in an old dilapidated apartment in a small commercial district of my city. The ringing of my phone woke me up from a deep sleep. I can't remember what I had been dreaming about, but I knew it had given me a deeply unsettling feeling.

"Sierra...?" I muttered, "What's going on?"

"Listen," she replied. I could tell she was deeply troubled. "I just saw a little girl in the window of this apartment." She had to keep taking deep breaths in-between her sentences.

"I was walking home when she was calling out to me. Please, Zane," she cried, "Her arms were so thin I could make out her bones! I need you to meet me over here now!"

I reassured her I would and got off the phone. I quickly got dressed, grabbed my kit, and headed over to the address she gave me. On my way over, I got a text from her telling me she'd be waiting in a vacant apartment on the top floor, where I could set up. Once I arrived, I immediately remembered the reputation this area had. I had already thought the address seemed familiar, but as I pulled up my heart sunk. This district was the worst of the worst, a culmination of what obscene drug use, sex and crime did to the unfortunate victims of such a fate. I knew I needed to hurry now, even more so than before, and rushed across the street.

The front of the building was barely illuminated by a lamppost covered by moths, and already I had run into vagrants asking me for handouts and young women asking me for a quick fuck for some cash. This was to be expected, but even after all this time, it never failed to upset me. I paid them no mind and headed inside. The smell of smoke, mildew and vomit hit me immediately, but I was so focused on finding this child that I couldn't even be fazed by it. I'd say I had rescued kids from worse, but to be honest, this wasn't all that different. At least, as of now. I called Sierra again to remember what floor this girl had been on.

"Well, I’m on the tenth floor, which means where I saw that girl must’ve been the eighth,” she said, “That’s what it looked like from the outside.” 

“Got it,” I replied.

“Listen Zane, I wish I could go and rescue her myself, but–” 

I cut her off there.

“Sierra, you *know* I wouldn’t want you to do that. Just stay where you are, and I’ll be up there shortly.” With this, I hung up.

I checked if the elevator in the unattended lobby had worked, and to no surprise really, it didn’t. I punched the button panel out of frustration, subsequently caving it in, and headed up the staircase next to it. The creakiness of the waterlogged wood made me feel like the stairs were going to collapse at any moment. Despite this, I knew there was no other option. I tried my best to take my time, but the urgency of the situation led me to go a bit faster, which was no doubt the most unwise thing I could’ve done. 

On my way up, I noticed the doors to every floor were completely sealed off, with bricks or cement put up to completely conceal whatever must lay beyond them. This gave me my first bit of genuine *fear* that night. Why would someone go through the trouble of doing this? I knew this was a terrible area, but to think an effort was put in to hide something? What could’ve been so ungodly awful that someone had to do this? I immediately felt like I was being observed, like I was walking into a trap. What made me feel worse was knowing Sierra was at the top floor, which meant she also had to have made the journey up here the same way I did. She was a small, skinny thing, anyone predatory enough to see this would’ve swept her up in a heartbeat. Thankfully, I knew she had to have made it successfully since I called her, but I can’t imagine the mental games that must’ve haunted her head the whole time. 

As I approached the eighth floor, a new smell hit my nose. It was like a mixture of rotten food and manure in a blender had spilled over, like death itself was waiting for me to arrive. I dreaded having to open the patched together wooden door to the eighth floor, but upon opening it, my dread immediately became warranted.

From the door to the end stretch of hallway before me, I saw a visual representation of everything my world was. Everything that must’ve been sealed off on earlier floors, now assaulting my field of vision. On both sides of the hallway, women of all ages and sizes were slumped over, some barely breathing, some dead, but all of whom had no idea of my presence. There had to have been at least fifty women, if not more. Most of them were completely naked, scars and needle marks decorating most of their arms, visual wounds with dark, dried crimson blood having left its imprint ages ago. Most were piled on top of each other, or side by side. I audibly gasped at the sight of this, only escaping my mouth about thirty seconds after I had the mental capacity to process it all. After I could regain my mental composure, I remembered why I was here, and started my arduous trek down the hallway. 

There was enough light to illuminate most of what I was seeing, dim as it may have still been. I could just barely hear the slight moans and wails of some of the women, probably suffering from withdrawal, if not their wounds. The smell of vomit and acidity hit my nose even harder as I walked on, and I began hearing the sound of someone profusely vomiting in the distance. The faint, dark blue carpet was stained deeply in something mushy beneath my shoes, which I could only surmise was the spilled blood of the many bodies I was beginning to see piled on top of each other. Some of these deaths looked natural, some self inflicted, but most…most looked forced. The visceral and brutal slashes to some of their stomachs led me to one deeply unsettling conclusion. Never in my life have I witnessed the faces of the dead so genuinely emotional, like I could still hear their screams of agony long after their twisted fates had ended their lives. God only knows how long these bodies lay here, or when the last of these victims had their life taken.

As I got to the end of the hall, I took a left and the scenery didn’t get any less grim. The lighting was starting to fade, but the horrors before me weren’t any less gruesome. The wind was also starting to pick up outside, which I felt through some of the broken glass windows aligning the right side of the hall. The howling wind added to my unsettled state, as the cold night air chilled me to the bone, making it slightly harder to breathe combined with all the decaying smells around me. And to make things even more thematic, like a practical joke from someone watching me, it started to rain. I could hear the numerous creaks and moans from this old architecture suffering from the years and years of deterioration from the elements. 

I could see one last room at the end of the hall, so I assumed that’s where this little girl had to be. Not too much longer now. I kept wondering to myself why all these women were scattered about up here, most of which now dead, but I soon got my answer, and to be honest, I kick myself for not realizing sooner. To my left, in a small rest area in the middle of the hallway, an old haggardly woman was comforting a morbidly obese woman who was slumped over her lap. Once again, neither even acknowledged my being there. I realized this obese woman was the source of the retching I had been hearing earlier. After she once again vomited, she began to shout.

“D-Don’t let him!” she wailed, “don’t let him take me again!”

I finally realized I needed to engage somehow. I knelt down to ask her what she meant.

“Don’t let who take you, miss?”

“The men! The men, the men in those suits!”

I began to realize this building must’ve been the site of the worst epidemic plaguing this city: human trafficking. Of course, how could I have bypassed such a conclusion? I began to stand back up and continue on. As I did, the woman began defecating what must’ve been days, if not weeks of meals, but I couldn’t stomach to see the end of this. I picked up my pace, finally getting to the final room, but not without more corpses strewn about, brain matter dried against both walls. I could see some of them had their heads bashed in, and other deceased holding bricks or planks of wood that must've been used to finish each other off. I could only imagine the chaos that had occurred here, not that much was left to my imagination. There was a message lining the right side of the hallway written in marker, that read, “If we can’t finish you, feel free to do it yourself.” 

The room didn’t have a door. The light was off so I felt around for a light switch, slowly entering as I couldn’t even imagine what was hidden in the total darkness. After feeling it with my left hand, I flipped it upwards, to yet another horrendous sight.

It was a small area, no bigger than an average bathroom, sanguinary walls theming everything I was seeing. In the left corner of the room, above a countertop, a short, decaying corpse of what must’ve been a teen girl had an exposed wire ripped out of the now decaying wooden wall wrapped around her throat. She had found her way out of this. On the right side, sitting atop another counter, a frail woman, head full of matted curly hair, belt wrapped around her upper arm, also in a heavy state of decay. I looked down at the ground, and to the other side of yet another deceased woman, I finally found her. The little girl was lying inside a litter box, cat litter still piled up, and the girl was enveloped in it. She must have buried herself to try and stay warm, as she was shaking too. I quickly snapped out of my shock from this all and knelt down.

“Hey! I’m here to help you,” I whispered to her, loud enough to make sure she knew I was talking to her. I brushed away the cat litter and began to pull her out. She must’ve just drifted off, if not passing out from hunger, and she was slowly coming to. Sierra wasn’t exaggerating. I could see her ribcage, and her arms and legs were the thinnest I had ever seen on a child. She groggily opened her eyes, and while most kids would’ve been startled at a stranger grabbing them, she must’ve immediately picked up on why I was there. She started to get upset, but I just reassured her it would all be okay. As I brushed the litter and dust out of her hair, I realized her hair was very curly. As I looked back at the counter on the right where the addict was, I made the connection right away. I tried to pick her up to quickly get out of there, but she began to get very erratic at this so I set her back down. 

“Okay, okay!” I said in a hushed tone to calm her down, and after being gentle, I managed to grab her hand to guide her out. I tried to cover her head with a small wrapping I had with me to avoid her having to see the scenery of the hallways, but she also refused this. 

“Dark!” she yelled, “No!”

Despite her seemingly being scared of the dark, the room she was in must’ve been the only place that had any semblance of warmth to her. I could only imagine the terror she felt having to face this fear just to stay alive.

I held her hand, guiding her down the hallway. In some twisted way of making myself feel at peace with these circumstances, I told myself she probably had already gotten used to the grotesque scenery already. Christ. The fucking world I live in. I was beginning to feel a bit better now that I had her with me, when the reality of the situation hit me like a ton of bricks all over again, when I heard her little high pitched voice perk up again.

“Are you taking me to my mommy?” she asked, wearing a genuine look of curiosity on her face.

I didn’t know how to answer this. She had been right next to her mother for who knows how long, and most likely due to her current state, she didn’t even realize. The thought that she wouldn’t have to remember her mother like that was both comforting and haunting all at once. I was shocked she remembered she even had one at all. 

“Yes,” I replied, trying my hardest to sound optimistic. “We just have to go upstairs first.” 

As we finally left the eighth floor, I guided upstairs, passing the ninth. The door was open, and as I instinctively looked in, I noticed the contrast immediately. This hallway followed almost the same exact layout, but it was completely barren of any life, or evidence anyone had even stepped foot in it. It almost looked *clean*. I realized as these traffickers abducted and used these women, they must’ve sealed each floor off in order to bury evidence of their sadistic deeds. They were going in order. I wondered why they went through so much trouble, considering only the lowest of the low resided in this area, and all these floors had windows anyways, but it didn’t take me long to realize. They must’ve done this in order to not scare off any potential victims that would pass through or be abducted. As for the windows, any jumper or escapee would be deemed either a schizophrenic freak, or just suicidal. Or quite possibly, these traffickers had just given up. After all, most of the bodies and gore had to have been aged for quite some time now.

As we reached the tenth floor, things again were still quiet. Suddenly, a small gray cat made its way down the hall. The little girl gasped happily, and knelt down to pet it. The cat sat obediently for a second, sniffing her and rubbing its face on her hand. For a brief moment, I watched this interaction, forgetting everything I had seen up to that point. I was hoping it was the same for her as well. The cat ran off and she grabbed my hand again. I was hoping she didn’t see the tears forming in my eyes. 

We made it to the apartment where Sierra had been waiting. She looked over, relief washing over her face. 

“Is the television ready?” I asked. 

Sierra nodded, and smiled at the girl. She knelt down to her level. 

“It’s going to be okay now,” she said, “Here.” Sierra handed her a bag of crackers and a juice box, sitting her down on the aged couch in the center of the room.

“Here’s something small to eat,” Sierra said with a wide smile. Heartbroken as she often was working with me, she was excellent with children.

“Are you my mommy?” the girl asked, eating one of the crackers as she did so.

I noticed Sierra’s demeanor started to shift. Her smile slowly faded and she seemed puzzled.

“No,” she answered, “But *he’s* going to take you where it’s safe, okay?”

The girl smiled and looked at me. 

“That’s right.” I said, adding to this.

Sierra stood up and patted my shoulder, but I could see the tears welling up in her eyes. She looked down and hurriedly went to stand out in the hall. I understood how she felt. 

After the little girl finished her quaint meal, I guided her into a back bedroom with the television. The blank screen was casting a bright white across a queen sized bed, riddled with dust from sitting used for some time. I brought out my kit and started my process. 

I know there’s another world out there because I’ve visited it. Many times I’ve had the option to stay within it. But I know I could never live with myself if I did. *My* world was my life, and my job was what I was dedicated to. So in turn, I give others that chance.

I opened the kit and brought out relics from the other world that I felt would represent not only her innocence, but also the type of person this girl was in my eyes.

“Okay,” I said, “I need you to stand in front of this TV, alright?” She nodded and did as I asked.

“I know you don’t like the dark, but I need you to wear this to get you somewhere safe.” I placed a Victorian styled cape on her shoulders, and a hat with a shawl to cover her face. 

“Now I’m gonna have you hold these up,” I said, and in her right hand I placed an old plush doll, and a lantern in her left. 

“Now just stand like that for a second.”

I brought out the last piece of my equipment, an old camera with an ancient hand crank, and positioned her in the center of its view. I looked through the viewfinder, and with her in focus, began to turn the crank, slowly at first, and gradually getting faster. I began to envision a perfect scene. I pictured the type of environment someone like her deserved, somewhere she could, hopefully, start anew. The wind outside was getting audibly louder, and the television screen started to gain visible static. Despite this, and a lamp in the corner of the room starting to flicker on and off, the girl did not get upset and stayed put. And finally, after a booming flash, and the sound of thunder rumbling in the distance, all was still. I slowly set the camera to the side.

The doll, clothes and lantern were now lying on the floor. I knelt down in front of the television to see the screen. I saw a bright green field, alive with trees full of leaves, a small windmill in the distance, and a small pond surrounded by bushes. In the middle was the girl, no longer thinning and frail, now completely clean and healthy. She looked around her surroundings. I could tell she was confused, but upon seeing life all around, no more death, no smells of decay and waste, everything was now clean and alive. She looked up at the sky, seeing the sun for the first time, and smiled. She ran across the field and didn’t look back.

My process was successful yet again. I packed up my camera, the relics, and closed my kit. I turned the television off—and wept.
