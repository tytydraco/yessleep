Id like to start this off by saying im not sure if this will be acknowledged but this is all true.
I recently moved into my first apartment, a shithole if I'm being honest but cheap for a 23 year old.
Weird shit happens here. My grandmother lived here a while back, 14 years ago at my best guess. Back then I had some, well I suppose you could call them supernatural experiences happen to me as a kid. One of them being an unexplainable tear in reality where my friend and I  couldnt find my grandmother even though she had been there for 10 minutes standing right in front of us. Until you experience this its hard to believe but imagine someone is standing in front of you and you can feel another presence but you are in what seems to be a split in the timeline.  Now im not superstitious but the building number was 13. Yeah, i know your probably thinking “Come off it dude” But that's only half of it. I can elaborate later but thats not why im posting this. I had a dream as a kid i just remembered and remember waking up and having marks on my skin or something of thst nature. But I had the dream again, now, as a grown adult....

Walking through the forest I here unintelligible whispering. Fog rolls in around me, the wind howls and the trees sway in the direction that leads deeper into the forest as if they are urging me to come forth.  I start to lose sight of the forest altogether. All around me is white… I hear laughter and see shadows running through the otherwise white backdrop. Theres something i can barely make out, something on all fours, an animal but something's wrong. Why does it move with such intent? Its walking towards me. I try to run but to no avail. Finally, i have the courage to run and I turn to but my feet wont take me anywhere, I only run in place in slow motion. No matter how close I get to the edge of the forest to get back to the complex, I make no progress. I turn to face it knowing its the end. Its now right in front of me, I close my eyes and I can feel it breathing on me. Heavy, loud breaths. And I almost hear it quietly laughing. (Heh-Hahe-Heh-Hahe) Blood drips from its mouth on my face and it lets out a horrifying scream and lunges foward to snap its jaw around me…


..... Thats where I woke up, feeling like a train hit me, I never woke up from a nightmare so fast not even as a kid, and the craziest thing was there was blood on my forehead alot which was not possible  considering I had no injury.

Its 3:24 in the morning as I'm writing this and a about to take a walk, I dont know what happened and I am not willing to investigate anything right now, Im too shaken up. Even if I did I wouldnt know where to start. So im going to start by posting this. Can anybody rationalize this for me?
