Out in the holler where the kudzu grows and the forest is thick, beyond the bridge that runs over the creek, and a few miles south of the town, there sits a dinner.

 
It’s old as shit and has a small gravel parking lot that the church in the woods likes to use for its bimonthly celebrations, but it’s almost always open. (The only time it’s ever really closed was that one time a tornado came through. And even then, people were still able to get food from the back window.) 

If you were to stop by and pop in, you’d probably get just about what you’d expect from any old country dinner. It’s about the size of a short, double wide trailer. So, the interior is a bit claustrophobic, but just spacious enough that you won’t feel trapped. It has a unique…smell— like cigarette smoke and floral perfume had some fucked-up love child and decided it needed to die there. Pictures of unidentifiable people eating are randomly taped to the wood-paneled walls (partially for advertising but mostly to cover some holes). A flickering neon “open” sign sits in one of the large windows. They’re framed with old Christmas lights and let in a natural light when the sun’s up, but also allow you get a full view of the road, surrounding woods, or Lucky, the veteran coyote, as you eat.

 
He’s not exactly a vet, as he’s never really been in any war— not any major ones, at least. Just the on-going one that he has against the local farmers and their chickens, but it’s left the poor bastard looking like he just came out of Nam. He’s only got one eye, three feet, half an ear, and the fur on his tail seemingly refuses to grow normally. We (and by we, I mean I) felt bad and gave him a piece of some expired food, one time. And now, he refuses to leave. He’s been hit by at least three cars and two trucks (that we know of) and still insists on staring at people as they eat.

 
Another sight you may have the misfortune, (or blessing depending on who you ask) of seeing out those windows, would be what we have dubbed as “the sign dancer.” A hairy and rather…voluptuous man who will occasionally appear and pole dance on the sign out front. We’re not sure if he’s a ghost or just some dude with too much time on his hands, but we do know that his dances can make people feel things. It’s different for everyone, Mrs. Kelvins said she felt peace for the first time in years, while Mr. Branson said he felt “true” horror. However, after having watched the man dance myself, I’d say it was interesting, but mostly kinda disturbing. (Like watching someone chug expired milk.)

 
As for upkeep, I’m pretty sure it’s just seen as an aesthetic choice.

 An old, eyeless mannequin with a purple Mardi Gras necklace and a name tag sticker on its chest that reads “Hello! My name is: Tomila” sits next to the entrance as a makeshift coatrack. If you get close enough to it, you’ll notice it has that sickly sweet smell of rot clinging to it. (No matter how much it’s cleaned or sprayed with Febreze, it will not go away.) A cork board covered in papers, ranging from missing pet posters to advertisements and a few newspaper clippings, sits on the other side.

Booths are lined up against smudged windows and advertisements for local businesses are trapped under the clear, yet sticky, plastic coverings on the tables.

There’s an open kitchen, with grease-stained utilities that haven’t been updated since poodle skirts were a thing, and coffee pots that look like they survived Chernobyl. A dented mini fridge softly hums at the back wall, next to the batter covered waffle irons that strangely smell like burnt hair every time they’re used. There’s a milkshake station (It’s continued functionality is proof that miracles really do exist, and honestly, it’s what gets me through the day sometimes.) that sits next to the drink machine, where the stubborn, red sticky mess beneath it all has been fighting with the grease to become a permanent fixture. The checkered linoleum floors are cracked and stained in some places. Sometimes when it rains, a mysterious brownish liquid— that smells oddly like pennies —oozes from them and forms shapes similar to human footprints. A jukebox, riddled with bullet holes, sits next to the bathroom hallway (Sometimes it “glitches” and the screams of children come from it. Usually, it has to be unplugged for a few minutes whenever that happens.) and plays country music and the occasional pop or rock song.

 
I’m not one hundred percent sure, but I think the health inspector is either sleeping with the owners’ daughter or has brain damage or (who knows) maybe it’s both. Like, this guy will straight up look at the weird black goop stuff in the mop station and be like, “Yeah, this is okay.” It’s shady as fuck, but if there’s one thing we can count on, it’s that he’ll sign off on this shit hole as being “safe,” like, pretty much no matter what.

 
If you find yourself needing to go number one or two (or three) after a meal or just in general, then you may find a hot dog on the floor next to the toilet paper rack. Its appearance in one of the two bathrooms depends entirely on what day of the week it is, though. On Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, it will be in the men’s room. But on Sunday, Tuesday, and Thursday, it will be in the women’s room. It’s absent on Saturdays. And while we highly suggest against its consumption, we cannot control what you do. Having said that, the people who have eaten it claim it allowed them to have seen into the future for a few hours. Others became violently ill (just as we predicted they would), and were doomed to spend their evening in the very room they consumed the forsaken cylinder of meat in.

 
If you do stop by, don’t be a stranger! I’m pretty much always on the clock and I’m more than happy to take your order or sit and chat or both! I’m bored as fuck and my coworker, Kurt, isn’t a very good conversationalist. And there isn’t any phone service or internet at the dinner. So, if you have any important calls to make, you’ll have to go out to the edge of the road. Or you can use the old phone booth! It’s pretty much in the same place. It’s next to the only streetlight we have out here, so it’s pretty hard to miss. Do be careful if you ever have to use it, though. We have the occasional hobo or crazy person come out of the woods to try and “phone home.” They can get pretty violent, and as much as I’d like the show, I’m supposed to treat the parking lot fights as though they were happening in the store. The owners put that rule in place, and they review the cameras to make sure we break them up. And I really don’t want to deal with anymore violence than I already have to. (I am very tired, and I am not a very large or strong lady. So, breaking up fights is very hard for me. Please think of me and the consequences of your own actions.)

On the odd occasion that I’m not working, but you still want to chat with someone. Then I highly suggest that you be cautious with the locals. Some of them are lovely people, don’t get me wrong. I’d just rather not leave Kurt to deal with a fight, should one break out, while I’m not there. Because, while Southern hospitality is a given with most of our regulars, it can still…run a bit short, if you know what I mean.

If you go in the mornings you may meet a fair bit of them, like Mr. Stimson, an older man who usually comes between the hours of seven and nine AM to order a few cups of coffee and a gravy biscuit. He used to own the old scrap yard. And despite there not being any big wild cats native to this area and the nearest zoo not housing any, he will tell you all about how his dogs were snatched, one at a time, by a black panther. Never mind the fact that he has only ever had but one dog. (It’s very sweet and follows him like a little shadow. Sometimes he brings it to the diner.)

Mr. Canterbury, he always gets the morning special that comes with one waffle, two eggs, and a side of bacon or sausage. But he gets the bacon instead of the sausage, because he claims that it “taste too much like human flesh.” (I can assure you now, that the sausage is not made of flesh. We’re not sure where it comes from, but the owners assured us that we weren’t eating living people.)

Ms. Cleo Janice comes in late in the afternoon and orders exactly one egg, a thing of cheesy hash browns, and a strawberry milkshake. She always says that Tomila is “crying” and that the mannequin is “sick.” Me and Kurt think she may be projecting her feelings and trying to ask for some form of help. But the last time we just up and asked if she needed any, she wound up getting a bit…violent, insisting that it was Tomila that was needing help. We’ve considered banning her from the dinner, but she tips, like, really good. So, we just keep our mouths shut and give her the food she orders.

Then there’s Mr. Johnson. He doesn’t really have a usual meal, insisting that we should “surprise” him and give him whatever. However, he always refuses to drink water. He claimed our water had made him unable to eat fish. As every time he saw one, it apparently had his late wife’s face and would “beg him to stop” or “let go” with her voice.

If you have questions, then so do I. But unfortunately for the both of us, they will forever go unanswered. Because Mr. Johnson, the slippery bastard, died. They found him in his kitchen a few months ago, soaking wet. Apparently, he managed to drown while eating tacos.

So, to sum it all up, the diner is weird as fuck, but it’s become a major part of my life. So, I figured I’d start sharing a few of my experiences with y’all.
