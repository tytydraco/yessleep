This is a story from my old uncle in Borneo. It probably happened around 1940. Today, the island is quite developed, with shopping malls and everything, but for centuries it was just a vast swath of jungle, with the river as the main vein of transportation.

The story takes place upstream along the Kapuas River—the longest river in Borneo (you can find it on Google Maps). Many people from my tribe, the Dayak, worked as farmers and usually lived in villages or houses along the riverbank, with stairways leading directly from their porch to a small *dermaga* (dock), where they kept their *sampan* (a small canoe or boat).

At that time, motorized boats were rare and expensive—most people still rowed using paddles.

Anyway, this story comes from Uncle Peter, one of my many uncles. He is the oldest sibling of my father. (I have a lot of uncles and aunts—my dad has around 10 siblings, and my mom has 8.)

Yes, his name is Peter because of the spread of Christianity in the 1800s. Everyone in the family has a baptized name. I’ve forgotten his tribal name because everyone just called him Uncle Peter.

One day, Uncle Peter had to go from our village, Sungai Ayak, to a small upstream city called Sintang to buy supplies. The journey would take about a week of two. Because we had many relatives and acquaintances along the river—and because my grandfather had a good reputation for being generous (he once walked four hours to deliver rice to families who hadn’t eaten in three days due to a failed harvest)—Uncle Peter could stop by almost any house along the river to rest, use the bathroom, or even get a free meal.

So the trip, while tiring (rowing upstream is tough), was also kind of leisurely. He would stop here and there to say hi to old friends and family, reach the city, do some shopping, then rest and follow the river back home.

On his way up, he stopped by one friend’s house for lunch—I forgot the friend’s name, but probably something like Markus (a typical Catholic name). Markus had just gotten married a year ago, his wife was heavily pregnant and due any day. They were both really excited for the baby. Uncle Peter promised to bring a gift for the baby and wife on his way back.

So he continued the trip, did his shopping, and bought a toy for the baby and some herbal health jamu/tea for the mother. On the return trip, he stopped by Markus’s house again. He arrived a bit late, maybe two hours before sundown, and planned to spend the night there.

He tied his boat to the dock in front of the house and walked up, calling out—but the place was oddly quiet. He peeked inside and saw a baby swing (just a piece of cloth tied to the ceiling, used like a hammock), but no one around. He went around to the back, where there was usually an open kitchen (most houses had a separate open-air kitchen building), but still no one.

Shrugging, he figured he’d just leave the gifts on the porch and go to the next house, about 100–200 meters away.

But just as he was placing the gifts on the porch, Markus’s wife came out of the house, holding a baby, and invited him in. She said Markus was working in the field and that she had just taken a nap with the baby. Uncle Peter went inside, chatted for a bit, and held the sleeping baby while she made him coffee.

An hour passed, but Markus still hadn’t returned. My uncle started feeling awkward. He didn’t want to spend the night alone with a woman who wasn’t his wife—there’s a cultural taboo around that—so he politely said maybe he should leave. The wife said, “No no no Markus will be home soon, let me make you dinner.”

Uncle Peter said, “No, no, you just gave birth—you should rest. Besides, you have to take care of the baby.” But the wife insisted, again saying Markus would be home soon and would be happy to see him.

She moved the baby swing to the kitchen, put the baby down, and started cooking. Uncle Peter sat in the living room, feeling awkward and a little sleepy. As he started to nod off, he heard her singing softly.

It was just some regular lullabies—songs about a clever mouse deer and a crocodile, songs about a scary orangutan and a frightened bird. Nothing strange.

But then he suddenly felt a chill and snapped awake. He thought he had misheard something, but then it was clear. The lullaby had changed.

She was singing:  
**"Anakku, anakku, ada lauk datang ke rumah.**  
**Anakku, anakku, lauk nyamai.**  
**Anakku, anakku, inai sumai."**  
Which loosely translates to:  
**"My child, my child, some food is coming to the house.**  
**My child, my child, the food is delicious.**  
**My child, my child, wait—Mommy is cooking."**

My uncle froze. “Is she talking about *me*?” he thought.

By now, the sun was almost down. He peeked into the kitchen. There was no food—just boiling water on the fire.

Quietly, he stood up, walked toward the front door, and started heading down the stairs and jumped to his boat. As he was fumbling with the rope to untie it, he heard a voice from above.

It was the wife, standing at the top of the stairs, saying,  
“Hey, where are you going? The food is almost ready!”

Uncle Peter replied, “Sorry, it’s okay—I need to go NOW.”

Luckily, the boat was already untied. He started rowing as fast as he could, not looking back.

After what felt like hours—but was probably just minutes—he calmed down and dared to glance behind.

And there she was. The wife… was following him. Floating on the river.

He panicked and rowed even faster. It was now sundown.

She kept getting closer. Finally, she was centimeters behind his boat—almost touching it. In desperation, he struck her with the paddle, jumped into the river, and capsized the boat, hiding underneath it. He grabbed one of the boat’s inner crossbars and held on, floating with the current.

Above him, he heard *creak… creak… creak…*

He stayed like that, holding his breath, until finally, the sun rose.

The river was calm and quiet. He swam out from under the boat, looked around—she was gone. But there were several claw marks, like bear's on jungle cat's on the backside of his boar.

He upturned and climbed back into the boat, which was half-full of water, and floated downstream until he reached some other villagers who were already up and about. Someone lent him a new paddle. He stopped by a house to get breakfast, told them the story, and finally made it home.

He had lost most of his shopping—the things not tied down had floated away, and the rest were soaked and ruined. He thought, “Great… Dad is going to be mad.”

But when he got home and told Grandpa what happened, Grandpa didn’t get mad. Instead, he said:

“You know, a few nights ago, Marcus’s uncle came by. He said Marcus’s wife and baby died during childbirth. Marcus was heartbroken. After they buried them, he moved back to his parents’ place.”

Then Grandpa said quietly,  
“Maybe who you met wasn’t really Marcus’s wife.  
Maybe it was one of the *Peniru*—a shapeshifting ghost that can mimic people.  
We’re just lucky you came home alive.”
