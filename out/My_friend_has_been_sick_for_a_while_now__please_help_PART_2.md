Hi everyone! I didn’t expect my previous post to get as much attention as it did, so i just wanted to thank you for all of your suggestions on what to do and give you an update on what’s happened since my original post.

Ever since we were little Ally has been my best friend, and doesn’t have a lot of family- her brother Luke went missing when she was really young (she says that, but there were multiple investigations into his disappearance and they found some of his remains in their parent’s backyard- i don’t want to make any assumptions but she doesn’t really talk about it and i don’t want to press any further) and her dad left soon after so all she really has left is me and her mom. She doesn’t talk about her mom very much either, but i know they don’t get on at all which is why she moved in with me in the first place. 

I saw a lot of comments asking me about calling the authorities or a family friend- i don’t think the police would believe me. As i said, I’ve tried with doctors before and they think I’m making it up. I actually did try to call Ally’s mom- and she did pick up! I’m paraphrasing, but this is how the conversation went;

“Hi Ally’s Mom, this is OP, i don’t know if you remember me from when Ally was little but i just wanted to call you and ask you about something?”

From what i remember, Ally’s mom was always very sickly when we were little- Ally would always bring her food that her dad hunted and prepared for her. They lived basically in the middle of nowhere. Her dad was really big on hunting and loved to bring home what he’d caught for them to. eat. Because of living in the middle of nowhere, food was very scarce for them and they ate what they could, no time to be picky. But there was one day, Ally told me, he shot something, came home, dug a pit for it in their yard and walked away in to the forest. That was the last time Ally ever saw her dad. Ally never let me see her mom in person. I chalked that up to her bad relationship with her, maybe they just didn’t want to fight in front of me?

“How did you get this fucking number. I thought I told her to delete it.”

She sounded furious.

“Ally had it on her phone- i would never normally do this, but Ally’s been really sick lately and I wanted to ask you about it.”

I talked to her about the strange behaviour, the trash bags, the trip, the smells. She was silent for a minute.

“She always took it too far. Could never be satisfied. Now you listen to me- She will never stop. Even if Luk- Ally, cries and squeals you have two options. Run while you can. Or do something about it.”

Then she hung up. If anything, i was confused about how cryptic that was. I couldn’t leave, she has no one else? So i decided to ‘do something about it’. Whatever that means.

I did manage to find a doctor that would come over to see her in her room- it was someone who saw my post and messaged me saying they were from the area near where Ally visited and said they could help! He seemed very eager from the messages, and i just couldn’t refuse- it seemed like he could actually help her. 

The doctor came, looked like a really weird guy, he was short and pudgy and smelled like rotten fruit. I let him in and told him about Ally’s situation and the stains on the carpet and her weird behaviour- he nodded thoughtfully before coming upstairs to outside of her door. We waited out there for a second before i heard this strange gurgling sound from inside her room, and the scratching started up again.

Pretty sure one thing I didn’t mention or describe very much in the previous post was Ally’s scratching. It’s migrated from just being on her door to the wall next to my room. Every night now, before she goes out, she’ll scratch and scratch at the wall and i can hear her crying and giggling so i just close my eyes and try to go back to sleep. She tires herself out eventually, and then goes out, but it’s really starting to creep me out. I think she’s taunting me becuase she knows how much i want to help her.

Anyway, Ally was scratching the door so harshly i thought she was going to break through it. I looked over in horror at the doctor’s face to see his reaction but what i saw was just pure fascination. He had this small, curious grin and a wide eyed stare as we both stood outside and watched the door as it rattled around in its hinges. The door came to a quiet still as we heard thumping through the door before everything went quiet. I heard the doctor sigh and reached a pudgy hand toward the door handle;

“I think she’s finally tired herself out now. I can assess her symptoms better if i’m seeing her in person.”

As he turned the handle, the door flung open and i finally got my first look at Ally in months. I could see her ribs through her t-shirt- her cheeks looked gaunt and pale, like her skin was stretched over the bone. Her hands were shaking so much as she went to grab the doctor she shook him with such a force it knocked air out of his lungs. Looked like she hadn’t slept for days. She had snot and drool running down her face and her chin, and a wide grin stretching her face open like a wound. Her eyes were glazed over and dull but scanned the doctor’s face with manic desperation. In that split-second, she grabbed the little doctor and pulled him into her room, before slamming the door behind her. The smell in the room has gotten worse as she’d opened the door, my eyes watered and i could feel bile rising up my throat as i was hit with the warm, damp stench of decay. 

As the door shut, i could hear the doctor wailing as he was seemingly dragged into her room before being interrupted by a wet, squelching sound, narrated by gasps and snarls. It sounded like meat being torn apart and chewed. There were these horrid slimy crunching sounds, before a final screech, another wet thump against the wall like she was throwing the sopping body against it and that strange gurgling again.

I could feel all of the hairs on my body standing on end. I’m writing this sat in my room with my back against the door, i haven’t cried at all but i think i’m just still in shock. I can hear heavy breathing but i can’t tell if it’s me or Ally.

I can hear her screeching from the other side of the door. I’m praying she just goes out again tonight. I don’t know what to do. I’ll update again if i’m still here.
