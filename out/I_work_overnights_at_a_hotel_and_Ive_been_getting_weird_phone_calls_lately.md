I work night audit at a motel. It's from 11pm to 7am, 5 days a week. It's honestly an easy gig. We lock the lobby when we come in, and put up a sign that says to use the phone by the front door to let the desk agent know you need something. So I don't deal with too many people. We have cameras that cover MOST of the property, and we even have security that we can call if we need. Although they aren't the speediest, they do exist, and have come in handy a few times. I say all this to explain why I have been there for 2 years, and why I have never felt unsafe or uncomfortable at my job... that was until the phone calls started. 

I don't remember the exact date the calls started, I just know as I write this, it's been going on for the whole month of Feburary. I am used to getting "weird" phone calls. We have one guy who likes to anonymously call  the motel and beat off as he makes a fake reservation. But, these calls are different. 

The first few calls were also from an anonymous number, so I thought it was the usual pervert. I answered and said my usual speel, expecting him to hang up once he heard a man, but the caller didn't. I could hear some faint breathing. After a few times of trying to get the caller to say anything, I just hung up on them. 

A few minutes later I got another call, anonymous still, I answered. Mostly because we are required to answer the phone within 3 rings, or it gets sent to corporate. Again, I say my speel, and no response. Just more breathing... this time, just deeper..after a few times of trying to prompt the caller, I just hang up. 

This continued for the rest of my week. I'd get a few anonymous call, and it was always just breathing on the other end. Not too weird, yet... 

That's when it started to get weirder. The next week I came in, the phone calls didn't stop. Instead of it being an anonymous number, it actually started showing up as a number. Never showed a name, as caller ID exists. At first, I didn't think anything of it. Until I answered my first phone call of the night, just breathing... I didn't even prompt the guest, I just hung up. Not even 10 minutes later, another call, different number this time. So I answer, give my speel, and surprise surprise, no response, just breathing. At this point, I'm on edge, and fed up. I tell the person to stop calling here, and then hang up. 

A few hours go by, and the phone rings again. I immediately jump, and check the caller ID, different number this time. Thank God, I think as I answer. I give my speel, and again, just breathing. At this point, I'm done, I yell at them to fuck off, and just before I'm about to hang up, they speak... "I seeeeeee yoou." And then they hang up. I'm just sitting there, unable to move, staring at the phone as it starts to ring again. Different number, but I'm still hesitatent... I just let corporate answer it. I didn't get another call that night. 

The next night I come in and decide to ask my 3p-11pm coworker if they've been getting any weird phone calls. I try not to go into too much detail, but they say no, just the usual pervert. About an hour after they leave, I get a phone call. At this point every time the phone rings, I almost shit my pants. I take a deep breath and answer. "Hello, this is the __________ Motel, how can I help you?" I say. "Don't hang up on me this time." I freeze, and check the number... it's not the same number, but everytime they've called, it hasn't been... "This time?" I respond. "Don't EVER hang up on me." The voice says, putting a deep emphasize on the EVER, as they hang up on me. I sit there dumb founded, staring at the phone for what feels like hours. 

The phone rings again, startling me enough that I dropped the phone. As I scrambled to pick it up, I accidently answered it. "One fish, two fish. Red fish, blue fish. I see you, don't drop me." The same voice from earlier says. CLICK. They hung up on me before I could respond. 

I am honestly terrified of going to work now. I don't understand what is going on.. does anyone have any ideas? I know it's got to be the same person, I can just feel it in my gut... every time the phone rings I feel my heart sink a little bit deeper.
