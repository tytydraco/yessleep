No one begins their life planning to be a certified personal accountant. Little kids don’t hang up posters on their walls of CPA’s and tell each other stories about how “Kail Russell once managed to get a client’s dining room classified as an office which saved $250 at tax time. It’s now the gold standard move but he was the one who invented it”.

If you had asked me when I was 12 what I wanted to be when I grew up, I would have said scientist, rock star, fireman, basically anything other than the 8 hours of doldrums I do every single day. Well, that’s not exactly true. The day does get broken up by my one-hour lunch break that I take in my car to listen to podcasts as I eat fast food. I’ve become so resigned to this life that my passenger seat has become filled with a pile of paper McDonald’s wrappers so large that I probably could have driven in the carpool lane and gotten away with it.

No, my life was not nearly as special as I had grown up wanting it to be. That was until last month.

The day itself started almost concerningly average. I woke up. Showered. Fought traffic for a half hour listening to heavy metal music as a way to trick my brain into generating energy to survive the day ahead. I eventually pull into the Starbucks that is on the way. If I’m going to be 5 minutes late, I may as well be 15.

A groan almost escapes my lips as I see that my least favorite barista is manning the counter.

“Hey, Bo! It’s good to see ya. What can I get you?”

Fucking Devon. It may not sound very nice, but how chipper he is every day just rubs me the wrong way.

“Can I get just a large black coffee?”

“Don’t wanna take a risk today? I can make you anything you want”.

“Well that’s great cause what I want is a large black coffee”

“Coming right up!”

Where does this guy get off being happier than me as a barista?

I pull into the parking lot of Chicago First American 15 minutes late, just as I expected. I pull up to the attendant stand and try to hand my badge to Roy, the parking attendant. However, Roy is nowhere to be seen.

“Come, on. Come, on.” I and frantic to get scanned in as now the lateness is starting to worry me. It’s one thing if I’m late by choice, but being late due to someone else slacking off? Unacceptable.

I’m sitting there for a good 5 minutes when I hear that fat piece of shit waddle up.

“Sorry about that! Went on a Dunkin run”

“Just lift the thing”

“If I knew you were sitting here I would’ve got ya something!”, He says as a laugh escapes his mustachioed face.

I don’t respond and just drive in and park as the arm lifts.

Drudging through the bright fluorescents until arriving at my cubicle, I do my best not to draw any attention to myself.  When I sit down at my desk, I boot on my computer, open a spreadsheet, and begin imagining driving my car off of a bridge on my way back home.

“Morning, Bo!”

I turn to see the reason that I don’t ever drive my car off of any bridges on my way home, Savannah. Savannah is the only person here at First Chicago who ever took the time to introduce herself to me, and for that, I will be forever grateful. She’s a great accountant, smart, understands all of my obscure Star Wars references, and while it isn’t professional to say, is beautiful. Like, she’s not a tall leggy model or anything, but honestly, I’ve always hated those types of girls. No, she’s short with red hair and glasses. She’s not shallow like the other girls. Doesn’t wear jewelry. Hell, her ears aren’t even pierced. No, she’s simply a girl next door type if the neighborhood was located specifically in my dreams.

“Hey, Savannah. How’s it going?”

“Eh, about the same as ever. You watch the game last night? Honestly, what the fuck were we thinking drafting another project QB”

There’s a chance that when I first started, in an attempt to endear myself a bit to this beautiful woman, that I lied about being a huge fan of the Chicago Bears.

“Oh, I know! It’s like, hey at some point we have to pick a guy and stick with him, am I right?”

To be 100% honest, I had no idea if what I said was right, but from her reaction, I could at least tell that it sounded like something someone who knew what they were talking about would say.

“One day they’ll get their shit together. Anyways, Robins wants to speak to you in their office. He came around looking for you so I said you were in the bathroom to buy you some time cause I know you get in late.”

She’s covering for me. Like we’re criminals pulling off our own little heist together. God I could kiss her. But oh fuck, what on earth could the boss want this early on a Friday?

“Appreciate it you looking out. Any idea what he wants to talk about?”

Savannah gives me an adorable little shrug.

“No clue. But good luck!”

I gathered up my things and proceeded to walk through the office feeling my palms begin to soak. God, why is it so blindingly bright in here?

I make the trek across the floor and enter Mark Robins’ office. Mark’s office is lit by lamps instead of the ungodly fluorescents. This is likely so he doesn’t get washed out by the white lights and instead is able to show off that deep tan he’s taken oh so many vacations to maintain.

He’s dressed in a suit that would be the equivalent of a month of my rent and pacing back and forth behind his desk, Airpods embedded deeply into his ears.

I knock on the door.

“You wanted to see me?”

Mark immediately throws up a finger at me that says, “Shut the fuck up, you pathetic little underling”.

“Yeah that sounds great! And hey, let’s get out on the course sometime soon. I’ll even spot ya a few strokes just to make it even. Haha! Have a great day, Rick. Look who’s finally decided to show up.”

Mark is now looking dead at me. I look around, unsure if he is still on the call before pointing to myself.

“Yes, you. Have a seat, Bo.”

My heart is going a million miles a minute as I pull a chair out to sit in. Feeling more like I’ve arrived at an execution than a quick check-in with the boss.

“You know, you do great work here Bo. My dad well, he didn’t want to hire you when you first started. He thought you looked too unprofessional. Me though? I saw your greasy long hair and ill-fitting shirt, and I saw potential.”

This guy is such a fucking prick.

“Well I really appreciate that, Mark”

“You ended up impressing all of us, and even look ready to take on a new manager role.”

Wait, was I wrong? Have they actually noticed the work I’ve put in. Am I about to be promoted?

“Yeah, I was ready to give it to you, but then I checked your computer sign-in times, and you know what I saw?”

Fuck.

“I saw that you were consistently 15 minutes late. Now, does that sound like a manager to you?”

“I get caught up in traffic every now and then but-“

“Bo, I pay you to be here every day from 9-6. If you’re consistently showing up late, you’re getting an extra hour off every single week. It’s downright disrespectful. And I know you don’t want to disrespect me after I went to bat for you, do you?”

I’d shit down your throat if I could.

“No sir, I’d never mean to disrespect you.”

“I thought not. So, we’re going to be holding on to that manager promotion for now I hope on Monday you are able to make it in by 9, alright?”

My nerves are on fire with rage. You fucking prick. I work my ass off for you every single day and this is how you talk to me?

“Yes sir”

I’m disgusted by how pathetic the words sound as they leave my mouth. I stand up and start walking towards the door.

“Bo?”

I turn to look at Mark who is now looking at his computer, not even feigning interest in looking in my direction.

“Just remember that on time is late and 10 minutes early is on time, okay?”

“You got it”.

I march back to my desk hyper aware of my surroundings. I can hear the hum of the lights. My tie now feels like it’s choking me as I feel the vein in my neck throb against the collar of my shirt. That asshole. That fucking asshole did that just to make me feel small. He was so smug about it. Just wanting to humiliate me. I can feel tears stinging the back of my eyes I’m so mad. Daddy’s boy probably had coke dick with whatever prostitute he was with last night and wanted to take it out on the nicest guy in the office. I wish I could just-

“How’d it go?”, I hear Savannah behind me. Fuck she can’t see me like this.

I turn my head away from her.

“Fine. I’m good!”

God this is all so fucking embarrassing.

On the way home from work, I grab myself a 12-pack of craft beer and replenish my weed stock. If I’m gonna be this miserable, the least I can do is make sure I don’t notice.

I get home and boot up my computer, take a hit as it loads up and crack my first beer. I log in to X, Twitter to the layman, and begin getting to work. I started trolling online when I was 14 and just never stopped. I don’t have any particular political ideology. I don’t even vote because all the parties are exactly the same at the end of the day, but I do find pretending to be a right-wing nut job makes people angriest, which always gives me a good laugh.

Some people think being an online troll is the lowest you can get, but I think it’s much worse to get yourself all worked up by someone clearly trying just to make you mad. And by God am I good at it.

I scroll through commenting for hours. Drinking beer. Getting high. I’ll tell a super feminist to get back in the kitchen and laugh at all the pathetic white knights trying to tell me that, actually, she’s successful. Or maybe I’ll comment DEI under a picture of a black man graduating from college and laugh as hundreds of people pretend that getting a sports broadcasting degree takes real skill.

The comments back are the typical, “Get a life”, “you’re an incel”, “no one loves you”, all the typical things that don’t bother a troll because, despite what you may think, we’re your neighbors and friends. However, I see the inbox icon indicate I have a direct message and open it ready to do battle.

“Hate the world, huh?”

If there’s anything I hate more than people who try to out-troll me, it’s the one’s that try to make me feel bad about it.

“The world is fine. Your mother’s blowjobs are what I hate”

“If you’re so mad, why don’t you get even?”

Weird response. I take a swig of my beer. Is this someone trying to convince me to go school shooter?

I start typing something about this person being a pedophile, that always plays well, but before I can finish, they send me a link.

“Just a way to let off steam. No tricks”.

Now, I have been on the internet long enough to know not to click on any mysterious links, but as I said, I had been drinking and smoking for several hours and was not really on top of my game like I would usually be. So, I clicked it.

I landed on a black webpage that welcomed me to something called “Pain Relief”. It billed itself as, “The dark web’s greatest game. Upload photos of someone you hate and your avatar will let them have it!”.

Someone I hate? How much time do you got? I almost leave the page when I remember the way Mark spoke to me that morning. Fuck it.

I click on the upload box and it has space for hundreds of photos and videos. Telling me that the more I upload, the more realistic the game will be. Well, I’m not one to do anything half-assed. I open up Mark’s Instagram page, and I add every single photo and video I can find onto this site. Even if there is no game, maybe they’ll steal the asshole’s identity.

My eye-lids begin to get heavy as my computer dings. A box reading “Your Game Is Ready” fills my screen and at the bottom is a Button that says “Play”. I quickly double-check all my virus blockers to make sure they’re working before hitting the button.

The game begins and I am in a room with a first-person perspective. High steel walls stretch upwards forever with only a single door leading in and out. Maybe a shooting game?

In this static room, I hear a booming voice: “Welcome to Pain Relief. Free to play. As long as you play”.

The loud audio startles me and I almost toss my headphones right off of my head, but instead I gather myself and begin to learn the controls. After a moment, I notice there’s a text box in the upper right corner that tells me to type a command.

Still unsure of just what it is I am doing, I type, “Explore the room”.

The avatar begins walking around until I see a table with tools ranging from the surgical to the garage.

“Look at the table”, I type.

The character moves towards it, the movements lagging slightly but the graphics are incredible. Practically photorealistic. As I get a better look at the tools: a saw, pliers, syringes, nails, a hammer, scalpels, and kitchen knives. I look over at another wall and notice a two-way mirror on the other wall, and walk over to get a better look at my character.

I feel a chill come up my spine in the real world as I see the face. It’s just…skin. No eyes, mouth, or nose. Just skin pulled so tight that you can make out every ridge and curve of the skull underneath. The photorealism that was once so impressive turned deeply upsetting. I move to exit the game when-

“Arrrrmpphhh!”

For the second time, I’m jolted. Jesus, you’d think I’d be used to playing games in the dark at this point. I turn the avatar to see men in black masks roll in a person restrained to a chair. A bag covers their head as I notice their arms are bound behind them and each leg strapped to one on the chair legs. The masked men sit them down in the center and exit out the door.

I walk towards the restrained man. Afraid I know exactly who is underneath.

I hurriedly type, “Remove bag”, and hold my breath as the character reaches forward and takes off the bag. And just as I thought, a practically real-looking Mark is sitting there, looking up at me absolutely terrified. Mouth gagged and tears in his eyes.

He looks at me and I almost feel pity. It passes quickly though. No, the Mark character is looking at my video game character. That’s all this is.

“Remove gag”

He- it, it’s not real, opens it mouth and almost perfectly in Mark’s voice it says, “No, please don’t. You don’t under-“

My character’s fist slams into the side of Game Mark’s face. I hadn’t even realized I typed “punch him” in the text box. The blood pours from his nose.

“Fuck!”, Game Mark says. “Please, I’m not-“

“Gag him”, I punch in. I’ve always hated that son a bitch’s voice. Immediately my character shoves the gag back into his mouth. This game is incredible.

I walk my character to the table. Pick up a hammer and a fistful of nails. And march back to Game Mark. His eyes widening with fear. I won’t bore you with the details, but what happened next were 6 of the most fun hours of my life. I play until the wet sloppy mess of flesh and blood on the screen finally stops bleeding and the booming voice returns.

“Thanks for playing Pain Relief! Always free to play as long as you play!”.

I exit the game and I just feel, light. I’m tired as hell and my eyes are strained from a full night of staring at a screen, but on my face is probably the biggest shit-eating grin I’ve ever mustered.

Forcing my body into the bed, I drift asleep replaying moments from the game on a loop. The hammer, the nails, the saw, I finally lose consciousness as I recall how he squealed as his nails were removed.

The rest of the weekend I spent walking on air. On Monday, I practically skip into the Starbucks by work.

“Morning, Bo! The usual?”

Ha! Even Devon’s fucking bullshit can’t get me down.

“You know what, make me whatever you want. Have fun with it.”

After a few minutes of banging around cups and making a whole show of frothing and attempted coffee art, he hands me a large sugar monstrosity with a heart made of foam on top. I take a sip and absolutely despise it.

“What do you think?”

Maybe his bullshit can get me down just a bit.

“Love it.”

Moments later, I’m pulling into the First Chicago American and getting waved in by Roy.

“No Dunkin run this morning?”

“Ya got here a little early for that! Someone must be wanting a promotion!”

You’re goddamn right I am you old fart. After all, Mark always says that if you aren’t ten minutes early, you’re late.

“Someone’s happy this morning. I feel like I never see you smile.”

I turn to see Savannah, beautiful, sexy Savannah.

“Hey, you!” I’m feeling on one. Confident. “I guess I just woke up in a great mood”

“I thought you were just happy cause the boss isn’t in”.

Her words hit me like a brick. My heart is going a million miles a minute as my nerves catch fire. Where’s Mark? Why isn’t he in? I mean, it’s not like-? No that’s not possible. Right? Should I ask where he is? Is that suspicious? Has it always been this hot in hear?

Before any of these questions escape my lips I feel a hand on my shoulder.

“Glad to see you took my advice, Bo!”

All the anxiety falls out of my body as I turn to see Mark. Alive and healthy Mark. Of course he’s fine. It was just some stupid game.

“Beat the boss in. That’s a good look.”

I can’t believe I’m so happy to see fucking Mark.

“Speaking of good looks, how are you doing Savannah?”

Fuck this guy.

“Good, just wondering where I can find the HR office, Mark”

God, she’s so quick on her feet. Obviously she’s able to shut Mark down. That piece of shit.

I get home that night and find the link to Pain Relief and am met with the booming voice and its reminder, “Welcome to Pain Relief! Free to play as long as you play!”

Oh, I’m playing alright.

Reuploading all of my saved Mark pics and videos, I wait for the game to launch. My blood filled with electricity. After Game Mark is wheeled in, I grab the pliers and spend the rest of my night removing every body part I think the real Mark would want to touch Savannah with. Fingers, tongue, and all the fun stuff below the belt.

For the next few weeks, I find myself in a routine. At work, I’m chipper, hard-working, doing all that I can do to advance in this career so I can get that manager position and eventually ask Savannah out. At night, I am having a blast taking Mark apart piece by piece.

At some point, I find myself getting bored of Mark and move on to other annoyances. You’d be surprised how easy it Is to find Devon’s profile. The 20-somethings post absolutely everything and beg the world to find them. In no time at all I’m chasing him around the circular steel walls as he tries to run on sliced tendons.

For Roy, I have to find his daughter’s Facebook page and even then, it resulted in a render of his face that just didn’t provide the same thrill. Looking like an original Playstation generation character from the neck up. It was practically a waste of the night taking out the geezer’s teeth.

About a month in, Mark calls me into his office, a smug smile plastered on his face as usual. I drag my feet, savoring the last few steps before enduring another conversation with him.

"Bo, have a seat," Mark says, gesturing to the chair in front of his oversized desk. I sit, trying to keep my face neutral. He leans back in his chair, steepling his fingers like he thinks he's some kind of mastermind. God, I wish I could do all the things I’ve done to virtual him.

"I've noticed a real change in you lately," he begins, his patronizing tone igniting rage. "You've been showing up on time, putting in the work, and your results speak for themselves."

I nod, keeping my eyes on a spot just above his head. He loves playing the benevolent boss, doling out praise like he's a king bestowing favors.

"Thank you, Mark," I say, keeping my voice steady. "I've been working hard."

He nods, like he deserves credit for my changes. Hell, if you count the joy of torturing his video game doppelganger, I guess he’s right in some way. "And that's why I'm pleased to tell you that you're getting the promotion you've been wanting."

A rush of emotions follows: relief, excitement, pride, and burning resentment. I did this for myself, despite him, not because of him.

"Thank you, Mark," I repeat, genuine gratitude mixed with bitterness. "I appreciate it."

He smiles that infuriating smile again. "You deserve it, Bo. Keep up the good work."

I nod and stand to leave. As I walk out, satisfaction surges through me. I got what I wanted, and I don't need his approval to know I deserve it.

Leaving Mark's office, I feel a surge of confidence. I’ve got the promotion, and now it’s time to push my luck. Savannah is at her desk, typing away. She looks up and smiles when she sees me coming. Her smile is warm, this is really going to happen. Goddamn, I could fuck a rhino I’m so jazzed.

"Hey, Savannah," I say, leaning casually against her desk. "I just got some great news. Mark gave me that promotion."

"Congratulations, Bo!" she says, genuinely happy. "That's fantastic."

"Thanks," I reply, basking in the moment. "I was thinking, to celebrate... how about we grab dinner tonight? My treat. Anywhere you want. I was thinking like, sushi?"

She pauses, her smile faltering just a bit. "Oh, Bo, that's really sweet of you, but I actually have plans tonight."

My heart sinks, but I keep the smile plastered on my face. "Plans, huh? Anything exciting?"

"Yeah, actually," she says, looking a bit uncomfortable. "Mark and I are getting a drink after work. Just to discuss some projects."

I nod, pretending it doesn’t bother me. "No worries. Another time, then."

"Sure, another time," she says, her smile returning, but it doesn't quite reach her eyes.

I walk back towards my desk, rage boiling under my skin. Of course, she’d choose Mark. The smug bastard probably planned this, knowing it would sting. Give me the promotion but fuck the girl I bet he knows I want. I grit my teeth, forcing myself to stay calm. How could she even want to go out with him? What a fucking slut.

I know what I’m going to do next.

I get home and go straight to my computer and pull up Savannah’s Instagram. I’ve done this a thousand times before to admire her, but tonight I have something different in mind. I grab all the photos and videos I can over the next hour and upload them into the game.

 “Welcome to Pain Relief. Free to play as long as you play!”.

Oh, I’m definitely going to play. If you want to humiliate me, then I’ll just have to humiliate you, won’t I?

I move the mouse over the start button and am transferred to the room. I immediately walk over and grab a pair of scissors. Maybe I’ll start by cutting that ridiculous red hair of hers?

The masked men reel in a woman with the standard bag over her head. I can hear her whimper underneath. This is going to be so much fun.

The men leave the room, and I walk over to Virtual Savannah. I grab the bag and roughly pull it off of her.

The render of her is absolutely incredible. I must have chosen the best possible photos cause even with the gag, she’s stunning.

Tears are filling her eyes as she looks at me and a wave of nausea hits my stomach. Am I really going to do this? Something about it just doesn’t seem right. No, fuck it. This is a video game. I’ve been killing hookers in them since I was 12. Why is this any different?

She’s frantically shaking her head trying to loosen the gag. I decide how I want to start in on her and decide to go for broke. “Remove ears”.

My avatar reaches and grabs a fistful of red hair and turns her head so that her ear is readily accessible for the scissors. The shears are open with her ear between when I notice, virtual Savannah’s ears are pierced.

“STOP” I type before the scissors can close.

This isn’t right. She doesn’t have her ears pierced. Does the game automatically add earrings to all women characters? I begin examining the virtual Savannah more closely as she sobs. I’ve never taken the time to inspect them before.

I walk behind her and something on her arm catches my eye. A sliver of black peaking out from her long sleeves. Slicing through the bonds on her hands I grab her arm and roughly push up the sleeve to reveal a tattoo that I know from carefully memorized bikini photos, Savannah doesn’t have.

What the fuck is going on here?

Before I have a moment to think the Virtual Savannah pulls her arms away from me and yanks the gag out of her mouth.

“Stop! I’m not her!”

BAM!

The door is flung open as the men in black masks flood the room and begin shoving the gag back into her mouth and retie her to the chair. I don’t know what’s going on but I don’t want to play anymore. I try to exit the window but am met with a message.

“Pain Relief is free to play as long as you play. Are you sure you want to exit?”

Yeah, I’m pretty fucking sure I want to exit!

I click the confirmation button and leave the window and am now sitting alone at my computer desk. What the fuck was that? Was the game fucking with me? Just a dark web game that’s meant to freak you out and now some sick fuck is laughing about how good he got me?

My heart races as I step away from the computer, the eerie music of the game still echoing in my ears. The room is dark, lit only by the dim glow of the monitor. I take a deep breath, trying to shake off the tension, when a sudden crash from the hallway jolts me.

I freeze, my pulse quickening. Grabbing a heavy flashlight from my desk, I edge toward the door, my hand trembling as I turn the knob.

The hallway is silent and empty, bathed in the lights the building has on full blast. It hurts my eyes when contrasted with my dark apartment. My eyes dart around, searching for the source of the noise. There’s nothing out of place. I let out a nervous chuckle. "Just those dark web fuckers getting to me," I mutter, shaking my head.

I turn back to my apartment, feeling a bit more at ease. As I step inside and close the door behind me, a figure emerges from the shadows. Before I can react, a man in a black mask lunges at me, throwing a rough burlap sack over my head.

My scream is muffled as I struggle, heart pounding in terror. The man’s grip is ironclad, dragging me into the depths of my own home, the darkness swallowing my cries for help. I feel a jabbing pain in my arm as they stick me with something and my mind begins to do as dark as my vision underneath the sack.

The world has turned into a black sea. I’m floating now in an endless span of nothingness. The burlap sack flush against my mouth and nose as I become all too aware that I am unable to draw breath. I begin grasping at the bag that’s over my head. Desperate to remove it so I can swim up for air.

As I remove it, the world is no brighter. I reach up to my eyes and feel only skin where my eye sockets once were. Panicked, I begin feeling lower to find my mouth and nose are also gone. My face is nothing but flesh pulled too tightly over the skull. I try to tear it loose, as if my face may still be underneath. Wanting to free my mouth even if it’s just so I can let in the water so that I can die, but it’s no use. I exist only in this realm of perpetual drowning for what could either be a moment or forever.

I finally awaken from what I can only assume was a drug-induced sleep, feeling like death. My head is pounding and my mouth is dry. The room is pure concrete, including the bed I find myself on. It only has a half-inch matt to provide any comfort. There are no windows, just a steel door as the only way in or out of the room. I lay there for what feels like hours. Did I break any laws playing the game? Am I in trouble? It was just a fucking game! Graphic, but honestly, what game isn’t?

I move my head slightly and feel a sharp pain radiating from my face. I bring my hand up to it instinctually. Did they drop me on my face when left me in here? What can they even hold me here for? Deepfakes? It wasn’t like I was making porn. Though, I guess I can see how footage of yourself getting dismembered slowly over the course of several hours might be on the same level.

Finally, the door opens and two men in black masks walk in, grabbing me by my arms. As they march me down the hall, I feel a sense of familiarity with the space around me. However, that familiarity brings little comfort and instead causes me to try to tear myself away from them. My strength though is no match for the two masked men as they lead me to a room with a chair and begin to strap me down to it.

I manage to look up one last time, before the bag is lowered over my head, to see my face in the two-way mirror. Little tracking dots cover my face.

I feel hands grasp my shoulder and someone lower their head to be right where the bag has covered my ear. They breath for a moment before I hear them raise something to their mouth before a familiar voice says, “Welcome to Pain Relief! Free to Play as long as you play!”. Their mic clicks off as they say a final message just for me.

“And when you stop, you pay by playing one last time.”
