     My names Daniel, As the post states, I work at an antique mall in my town. It’s a slow job, the store has 7 aisles each one about 6 meters long per floor the store has two Floors open to customers and a basement for employees only it has antiques that are damaged by past customers.
     Each of us employs are assigned to monitor an aisle I work on the second floor on the third aisle. This aisle is called nostalgia, cheesy but the owners named each aisle with some sort of title instead of just a number. 
     Most of our customers are older folks or history buff nerds so we don’t get too many rude customers. 
Why I’m posting this is because one of the antiques we have for sale in my aisle. My aisle is a category of toys, train models, action figures, comics, dolls, a lot of dolls. when you first walk into the aisle the items are from the 90s the further you walk down the older the items become. The oldest items being from 1910.

Anyway, my job is just to make sure anyone looking through the aisle doesn’t break or steal anything. An to help customers get items from higher shelves. 

The specific item that I’m writing about is a porcelain doll from 1946. It’s a relatively small doll. Some of the dolls in my aisle are 4ft tall, this one is less than 10 inches in height. Shes got blond hair, a round face with a painted red lip and thin eyebrows, the paint on her face is in good condition for her age, the hair isn’t too bad either. She has a cloth body with porcalin limbs and head, the only Erie thing about her (unless you’re scared of dolls then I suppose any part of her would be Erie) is her eyes, they must have been blue at some point but as the material has aged the irises are a pink almost red tone, even the pupils. This doll has been here since before I started working at the store. I don’t know who sold her to us, or when. The store has been open since the 1960s so we must have gotten her  near the beginning. All the old employees say they never noticed her, or don’t remember her well enough to know who donated her.

Recently, for the past three months an elderly woman has been coming to the store wandering through the aisles aimlessly for about thirty minutes until getting to my aisle on her third visit. She’s never bought anything, this isn’t particularly weird because our town is one you’d pass through on a road trip and the antique mall is right next to the only gas station so folks passing through will come in, look around at some of the weird things for sale like old ww2 memorabilia (from both sides of the war) and retro playboy magazines then leave after a few minutes. No one really comes to my aisle, except this woman. Every time she visits she makes her way slowly through the first floor for thirty minutes every time, at the thirty minute mark she comes upstairs straight to my aisle and stays near the doll I mentioned earlier for an hour at most, she just, stares at the doll. 

The first time she came to my aisle I greeted her, not because I wanted to but just in case my boss was watching from the cameras. 

“Hello, ma’m. Can I help you with anything?”

The old woman, was about 5’3, she had white curly hair and always wore a long pale blue dress, wool socks, brown shoes and a thick gray cardigan. Her face seemed to sag dramatically compared to most elderly people, she looked like she was 100 years old. But she wasn’t frail, she walked without a cane, and stood up very straight. 

When I approached her she did acknowledge me. She just stared ahead looking at the doll.

“Would you like to purchase her?” I asked gesturing to the doll. I hoped she would purchase her, that doll gave me the creeps. I’d do anything to get someone to buy her. 

The old woman looked at me now, a look of surprise on her face, but she quickly schooled her expression to a neutral look of exhaustion. She stepped back looking once at the doll and once again me. Then she left.

I figured she was just a one time customer. But I saw her again three weeks later. Between the time she had first came and the second time I saw her at the store. Some weird things happened. 

Our store has so many old things, dead people’s stuff. That it wouldn’t be odd if some of the things were haunted, in turn our store. Us employees all had plenty of stories we’d shared with each other about paranormal experiences in the store, creaking floorboards after closing, falling objects, shadow figures in the basement, rattling shelves, flickering lights. I’m not a believer tho, all these things are explainable by non paranormal activity. I’d heard plenty of creaking floorboards having been working on the second floor for three years. The building has been here since the 1920s at least so it’s gonna make some sounds. I always shrug it off.

The week before the old woman came back I saw sumthin’ I couldn’t shrug off. Crazy as it sounds I was making my laps down and back through my aisle when I noticed the creepy doll was gone on my third lap. “Shit” I cursed, in my years of working here I’d never had an item stolen. I went down stairs  quickly to check the front desk. 

“Alice, has anybody purchased a doll in the past few minutes?” 

“Huh?” She looked up from her phone. Alice was a girl a few years younger than me, she worked the cash register every afternoon. Alice didn’t have much interest in antiques but our town doesn’t have many options for jobs, most young folks get out of here as fast as they can, running off to college or whatever big city they think is going to fix all their problems. 

“What you say Dan?”

“Daniel” I corrected “I asked if anyone has bought a doll today?” I raised my eyebrows at her. 

“No, ew. No one bought any of your creepy dolls, I’d have noticed. And we’ve only had two purchases today.”

I frowned, “and no doll?” 

“No I already said that” she turned away from me looking back down at her phone. 

“Ok let me know if anyone does”  she wasn’t listening, so I went back up stairs.

Now that I was back on the second floor I hurried bast the other aisles and employees all mulling about their aisles, helping or chatting with the few customers we had.
Despite the chatter near by, when I entered my aisle all conversations seemed to stop, it was too quiet.  
I slowed my speed walking to a carful stroll, a lot of the antiques were fragile and too many heavy foot falls could rattle a shelf and break something. My feet caused the floor to creak, I made my way back to the 1940s section to look for the misplaced doll. I figured some kid moved it. But the doll was there, in the spot that I was sure had been empty minutes ago, she was back perfectly placed even the thin layer of dust that she had was still on her like she had never been moved. The next day the old woman was back.

Anyway I have to head to work now, I’ll post part two tomorrow.
