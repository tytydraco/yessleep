"What.. the fuck! What even are you!?" Jake yells, followed by the sound of him getting up and running, stumbling into things as he tries to escape whatever he just saw. He made it sound like it was from out of this world. Whatever it was, this was probably what Jake imagined when he thought of a demon.

He quit running. I think he fell. A sobbing voice came over the phone. It was Jake.

"Guys. Please tell my parents that I love them. Just tell them that I love them, okay? Tell them that I'm sorry for being a fuck up. I never meant to dissa-"

"Shut up!" I yell, cutting him off. "Don't talk that way. You're going to be just fine! I'm sure you're close to the exit!"

"It's close. And... I don't know where to go. This fucking room is empty!" he says, trying not to cry.

A few of the longest seconds of my life passed before we heard our best friend beg and plea for his life.

"No! No! Please! Please, just let me live! I'm just a kid! Please! I'm just a kid! Nooo-." He suddenly went silent.

I still can't believe what happened next. The ground below our feet trembled. Whatever just happened down there, caused the ground to shake. It was immediately followed by what I can only assume was his body hitting the ground.

"Jake! Jake! Are you okay!?" I yell. But the only response I got was the sound of my best friend choking on his own blood.

"Dylan! What are we going to do, man!? He's freaking dying!" Brandon yells, shaking me.

I froze. I had no idea what to do. I was just staring at my phone screen, unable to process what was happening. Then Jake hung up on me. His phone must've died.

"What just happened!? Call him back!"

I tried, but I knew what was going to happen. It went straight to voicemail. This was the only form of communication we had with Jake, and it was gone.

Brandon hurried over to the basement doors, sticking the top half of his body inside.

"Jake! Jake! Can you hear me!?" he yells. Stopping for a second, hoping to hear a response. But there was nothing.

"Dylan." I hear. I look up to see Brandon staring at me. He was as white as a ghost, zero emotion on his face.

"Do you hear that?"

We continued to stare at each other, completely silent. I held my breath, listening for anything. And then I heard it. Jake was right. It was a hauntingly deep growl. It sounded like a giant lion straight out of hell or something. And it must've been getting close because the ground began to tremble beneath our feet again.

"Grab our shit and run, Brandon! Get to the car! I'll be right behind you!" I yell, running over to the basement doors. Grabbing the crowbar from my bag, I slam the doors shut and use it to jam them shut. I turned around and took off like a bat out of hell towards my car.

Brandon beat me to it and pulled on the passenger door handle. It was locked. Fuck! Running for my life, I reach into my jacket pocket trying to get my keys. I pulled them out as soon as I got to the car, frantically trying to unlock my door. I was shaking so much that it was nearly impossible.

I managed to calm myself down a bit and got the door open. Brandon and I hopped into the car, and I started it. I thought my car was dead for a second though, because the roar of that thing drowned out the sound of my engine.

I put the car into gear and sped off. We drove off into the wrong direction, but it didn't matter. As long as we were driving away from that little piece of hell on earth that just took the life of our best friend.

I wish we had gone the right way, though. Because the demon was still chasing us. We couldn't see anything, but we could feel it's presence, even from inside the car. I look down and notice that I'm going almost fifty-five miles an hour on this dirt road.

Next thing we know, something took out the front tire and the car rolled. It must've rolled a half dozen times. I honestly can't recall. I was almost immediately knocked out when it happened. I came back into consciousness when I noticed him. I don't think Brandon put his seat belt on. He didn't look good.

"Brandon! Brandon! Come on buddy, you okay!?" I yell, shaking his lifeless body.

But I knew it was too late. I must've been out for a while because he was ice cold. I lay there on my back, on the ceiling of my overturned car. I couldn't get my door open.

"Damn it! God freaking damnit!" I yell, as I kick the windshield out. It finally gave. I got onto my stomach and crawled out, making my way through the broken glass. My head was spinning. I felt my temple. Glancing at my hand, I noticed blood. I looked in both directions and noticed the path to my left went down the mountain. I took off in a full-on sprint. I knew it was towards this demon. But it was also towards safety.

I'm pretty sure I broke a rib. The pain of running was unbearable. But it was definitely better than dying.

I ran for a while. Dehydrated and out of breath, I wanted to walk for a bit, but then I saw it. The place that took Jake and Brandon. I took off running again, crying as I ran past this real-life nightmare.

I noticed something on the road. It was Brandon's phone! I lost mine in the accident so maybe I could use his to call somebody. I bent over, grabbing it without stopping. I didn't want to spend any more time around this place. I ran another quarter mile or so, before stopping.

I tried a few typical funny passwords I assumed Brandon might've used, but none of them worked. I felt hopeless until I put in four zeroes. His phone finally unlocked. I punch in my mom's phone number, so thankful that she made me memorize it all those years ago. I put the phone up to my ear. She answers.

"Hello! Mom!?" I say, frantically checking my surroundings, making sure I'm alone.

"Oh, hi honey! You're out late, did your phone die?"

"No, mom! I wrecked my car! Jake and Brandon are dead! Something killed them! You have to come get me!" I yell, failing to hold back my tears.

"Oh my.. okay, just tell me where you are, okay?" she says, stunned by what she had just heard.

I explained to her where I was while I continued jogging, praying for any sight of asphalt.

I was still a couple of miles away from any real road when her car finally came into view. I spotted her lights before she had noticed me. Speeding up, my mom pulls up next to me slamming on her brakes, with the passenger window already down, and yells "Hurry, honey! Get in the car!"

I hop in, and as soon as I do my mom took off into reverse, stopping only when she knew she had enough room, before peeling out in the gravel towards town. I could hear that growl again.

"Oh, my god! What is that?" my mom yells.

She could hear it, too.

"Just get out of here, okay mom? Just get off of this dirt road as fast as you can, please!" I shout.

Shortly after, the paved road came into view, and as soon as our tires hit that asphalt, the growl began to subside. Almost as if the beast was trapped on this mountain, just outside of my hometown.

With the police on the phone, my mom made her way to the hospital.

We had made it. We pulled up to the ER, and I must've looked terrible because two people met me just outside of the car with a stretcher. I laid down, crying. Mourning the loss of my friends while they pull me inside.

I spent a couple of days in the hospital because my injuries were worse than I thought. A concussion, a broken rib, and a dislocated shoulder, along with way too many stitches on my stomach, face and left shin.

I told the police about what happened that day and they sent out a team of four sheriff deputies to check it out. After a disturbing interaction over the radio, none of them were even heard or seen again. The two police cruisers they drove out there even disappeared.

The city hasn't really talked about that place much since all this happened. Last I heard, they said something about a controlled burn. All they've done though is rope the mountain off with police tape, and put up signs on trees around its base, warning people of the unknown dangers that lie ahead.

Somebody must be up there though, keeping that thing at bay, because the police noticed dozens of those small wards we saw, hanging from about half the trees surrounding the cabin.

Mr. Peterson gave me an extension on the project, but I asked for a different request. I asked him if I could edit and turn in the fifty-two-minute-long episode of Paranormal Pioneers I had made with Jake and Brandon, and he eagerly agreed.

"That sounds... like a swell idea, Dylan. And we have to make sure their parents get to see it!" he says, trying to not cry in front of one of his students.

The final was due just a couple days later, on Friday. And I was very proud of what I had made. What we made. It's something to remember my best friends by and I will cherish it forever.

Mr. Peterson gave me a perfect grade. After class, he actually mentioned that he wished he could've given me more than a hundred percent for being able to do this, despite what I had been through.

Jake and Brandon's parents decided to do one big "celebration of life" for them the next day. They thought it would be a good idea to premiere the episode of Paranormal Pioneers there, and everybody loved it, honestly. I guess it feels good knowing some good came out of all of this. I just wish I had my friends back. Or at least, even some answers, like whatever the hell that thing is out there. And did Jake set it free when he kicked that door in? My mind infected with thoughts, that I did not like.

Any time I brought up the Bibles with someone in town, they'd just brush it off and tell me that it's nothing I should worry about.
