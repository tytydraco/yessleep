   


I need help, I don't have much time before the level 1 guard comes back to check this cell. I don't really have time to explain but I was a worker at a company who creates different sorts of technology. Me and one of my best friends were picked to do a test with a device that could possibly open a portal to a different dimension.

&#x200B;

 The first try did nothing, the second try and a spark flew off of the device, the third try and that's when everything went black. I woke up in a prison cell with 2 other guys in it. When they saw me they started to scream and shout.

&#x200B;

 After 15-30 secs of them screaming and shouting a devilish like person came to the front of the cell. As I saw this thing start to unlock the cell door I noticed an axe on his back, and I noticed how hot it was. When he came into the cell and grabbed me, my arm instantly began to burn like crazy. It was like pressing your arm into an oven on 500 Fahrenheit. 

&#x200B;

I screamed in agony as he pulled me away. Before I left I heard one of the people in the cell with me mumble ‘’sorry’’, and  ‘’we had too’’. As this thing dragged me away I kept screaming until my voice went hoarse because of all the heat. As this thing dragged me away I took the time to look at my surroundings, it was like a prison in real life, there were about 10 more devilish human-like beings walking around with axes on their backs. 

&#x200B;

I also saw inmates in the prison, oddly enough, nobody was talking, they actually were all staring at me as I got dragged by this demon. After about 2-3 mins of getting dragged my skin was starting to peel from the floor and since it was already hot as hell my skin was starting to burn immensely. I was about to pass out from all the pain when we finally stopped. 

&#x200B;

I looked up and saw a much taller and bigger guy with a hammer in his hand. I also noticed 2 long scratch marks on its chest, as I stared at the thing's chest it suddenly turned and looked directly into my eyes. That's when it lifted its hammer, and smashed my arm into the ground. Pain and numbness erupted in my arm as this thing kept on bringing its hammer down on my arm over and over until the lower half of my arm detached from my shoulder. 

&#x200B;

That's when I passed out, I woke up to 2 people looking down on me. Remembering my arm I sat up and tried to lift both arms. Oddly enough, I could move my arms with ease. Even more confused, I looked up at one of the inmates and saw him looking out to the prison cell door. 

&#x200B;

Following his gaze, I saw that now it was pitch black outside besides for 2 glowing red like orbs in the darkness. Before I could yell out who was that in the darkness, the inmates put their hand over my mouth, and pulled me to the bunk beds. 

&#x200B;

Confused, I asked him what was going on and where the hell was I. He first told me to lower my voice to a whisper, then started to explain that this was hell, people come here from the same company I'm in, the manager of the place picks different people to go to the portal which is here. When he noticed that none of them came back, he sent more people to try to solve the mystery behind the portal.

&#x200B;

 And still when none came back, he made a plan to send 2 people every year through the portal so people won't get so suspicious of people disappearing at his company. (The sending 2 people every year made 0 sense to me but I said nothing) After he got done explaining how and why we were here, he then started to explain all that he knew of this hellish place.

&#x200B;

 The first thing were the devil guards that patrolled the prison, the one that dragged me was known as an Level One Guard. The one that smashed my arm as I described to them was a Level Two Guard. There was also a Level Three Guard which is described as a fat devilish person who does some stuff I don't even want to describe right now.

&#x200B;

 And finally, the Level Four and Level Five guards, these were the ones that you should be afraid of. The level four guards are scattered all over the prison, they are something like doppelgangers who take over an inmate's body and try to see who's trying to escape or who is not doing what they're supposed to. There basically spies in the short term. 

&#x200B;

The level five guards are the ones that I had seen in the darkness. If they catch you out of your prison cell, rumor is that they eat you alive. After he got done explaining the guards he then told me about some of the guys in here and who too watch out for spies or people who supposedly escaped.

&#x200B;

  Midway through him telling me about the people who somehow escaped, the air suddenly got extremely hot, like so hot I started to sweat instantly as soon as I noticed the change in temperature. I looked up into the darkness and saw a massive red glowing thing pass by the cell door. Confused, I mumbled to them who it was but they just stood frozen.

&#x200B;

 After I couldn't see the big glowing thing, the temperature returned to its normal hotness. I looked at them and saw them relax. They then told me that we just survived the devil's walk. Confused, I asked them what they meant. 

&#x200B;

The second inmate said that the devil walks is supposedly the devil walking by the cells every day and picks somebody random from the entire place to kill. I then asked if we get to go places like in a real prison.

&#x200B;

As soon as I finished the word prison, the cell door opened. I immediately rushed out but before I could reach the cell door I was pulled back. I turned around and told him what his problem was and why he pulled me back. He explained to me that the devil opened the cell doors to lure people out. 

&#x200B;

When the sun comes up and shines through the window, then you can exit your cell. When he said window and sun, I looked around in the cell and saw a window. I climbed up on the bunk bed and peeked out of the window, what I saw sent chills down my spine.
