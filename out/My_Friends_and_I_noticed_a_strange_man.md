Im gonna cut through any bs and just tell you my story. (I’ll be describing everyone’s name as random made up names for my safety and theirs.)

One night i was out with friends (we were atleast 15-16 at the time.) we got into some mischief like all people do at my age. 

As we were just walking to our next spot, one of my friends (Mark) pointed at someone. We didn’t realise he was gone until we didn’t hear him yelling like he always does. We turn around, he was just staring at some random man on top of the hill next to the road, We of course told Mark to hurry up before it gets too dark..

He doesnt answer.

My other friend (Jackson) walked up to him and tapped him. Mark turned around, i could not tell you how ominous it felt. Chills went rushing through my body just thinking about it again.

Mark starts to snap out of it and the man is just standing there. 

Mark has these episodes sometimes about his father that abused him when he was younger and when he would tell us about it, it makes me sickened by what someone could do to a child,
Marks dad was later sent to a mental hospital for being schizophrenic.

We walk off with Mark as im watching him just stand there, He doesnt turn at me or even move but i can tell he was staring at me. Mark acted weird the entire time we were with him, then we dropped him off at his place because of what happened, but as I turned around i saw
the same man, He was under a light post, he had long brown hair with grey highlights, seemed to be in his mid 20s, bad posture, skinny form, I could tell it was him by his clothes, i remember he was wearing baggy jeans with black stains with a greyish puffer jacket.

He was just staring, as if he was trying to put some sort of dominance on me, i bump Jackson with my arm and as he turned to me he saw him, instantly his survival instinct kicked in and told to walk slowly, so we did.

We walked slowly turning more frequently then usual to stay away from him, It felt like he was teleporting because every time we turned he was so much closer then what he should’ve been. When we finally don’t see him behind us we book it down an alleyway that leads all the way home, I told him to stay at mine as it’s a bit uneasy how he was following us. He agrees and we go to sleep, I wake up at around 5AM to go get a glass of milk, When i made it to around the end of the hallway, i saw a figure like shadow coming through our window, I get nervous and wake my friend up since my parents went to work since they usually do around early hours, i told him i saw a shadow in the window.

He immediately gets up walks out there not seeming to believe me, then I heard a skin crawling scream.

I run out to see it was the man screaming, at us through the window, he kept saying “You are a sinner, you disrespected our gods.” over and over again, i threatened to call the cops but he didn’t stop, it scared me to hell. I eventually called the cops and when they finally made it, he was gone. I gave them full descriptions of the man just for safe keeping. 

Thats the last time i saw Mark, and his number puts me straight to voice mail, as if he vanished.

And the last time i saw that man was that night, I keep telling myself on why he followed us and not Mark, until i read up on his dad.

Marks dad matched all the descriptions.

4 years later i wonder if hes still out there waiting for me.

I wish everyone safety on them and their loved ones.
