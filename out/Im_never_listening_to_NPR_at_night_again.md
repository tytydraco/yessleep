As I said goodbye to my parents, sister, and the family dog I made sure to appreciate the well-lit room and brightness. Not that I was about to venture into the woods in the middle of the night like mad man but the drive back to my university apartment was dark for most of it until I hit the highway. The drive wasn't too bad, only 40 minutes or so depending on traffic conditions. However, my parents live in a small town that's heavily wooded. If your car were to break down there, chances are you would be stuck until the next day when people leave for work. My family and I had gone out of town for the weekend and I needed to get back to my apartment since I had work early in the morning. I was going around saying my goodbyes, saying a long goodbye to my dad in hopes of him sliding me a twenty-dollar bill. As I was heading my Mom, always the stressor, warned me against going to a gas station this late at night and to make sure I wasn't on my phone. 

Giving her fake promises, I went out. Walking across the cold front yard to where my rustbucket was kicking, I looked up at the large yellow moon and soaked in all in. Putting my bags of purchases of various rarities I bought in the small mountain town we visited this past weekend in the backseat, plus some leftover fried chicken steak I was going to tear into once I made it back to my apartment. Getting into my car that stuttered a bit but refused to die, it eventually started. I blew a gust of cold air out of my mouth, cranked the heat up, and gave the car a chance to warm up as I sat there shivering. I thought to myself at least the heat still works as the car that had almost three hundred thousand miles on it, no working AC, and didn't lock properly. This car was the kind you turned up the radio whenever it started making noise and prayed that it would go away. The car didn't have a working aux either, and it only played CDs but unfortunately, it had a tendency to make the CDs get stuck and there and that's how I lost my copy of the Grateful Dead Greatest Hits I found at a thrift store. I looked at my phone and saw it was at one percent. Shit, I thought to myself. I had used to take photos the whole day, was on social media, and listened to music all day it made sense it was dying. I unlocked it to text my roommate if he was still up by the time I got back but halfway through that, my phone turned black. I looked around the car and saw that my charger was missing. Right, I thought to myself. My charger at my apartment had ripped and I was using the spare one in my car. 

Sighing and feeling a little warmer I started to drive. While leaving the brightly dimmed safety of my parent's front yard, I started to fiddle around with the radio. The only thing that still worked in this car. I hit scan as the radio stations went from static to boring dad rock station to static to generic pop music to NPR. Hearing the smooth jazz of an introduction to some segment, I was happy with that. I used to listen to NPR more but with time just preferred to drive to the music. However I love the dreamlike quality that NPR takes late at night when they start broadcasting news of countries you've never heard of, sports teams you don't follow, and some of the bleaker stories that you don't hear during the daily news cycle. As I got on the main single dark road that led out of the small town my family lived in, I let my brain go on autopilot and enjoyed the talk show segment on NPR. The show was asking refugees about their experiences as they cling to life on the homemade raft and the losses they suffered. Real life-changing perspectives make you realize how spoiled rotten most of us are. The drive back to my university was relatively straightforward and I didn't need my GPS, albeit a bit lonesome as I normally like talking to someone on the phone to make the drive shorter. I focused on the NPR interview to make the drive shorter

"What did you see out in the sea after you fell off the raft?"

At first, I heard a language I didn't recognize and then the English translator started speaking halfway through the interviewee's reply

" I saw the face of God, as I looked out into the vast ocean and saw the blueness of it. I-"

Shit. I heard static overcome the voices and the quiet soft jazz music that accompanied the stories. I must be getting further away from the border of the state, near where my hometown. I kept driving and eventually, the voices came back into focus.

"My father hugged my older brother and me sobbing as he held us. I was still cold and shivering from the cold ocean sea."

"What do you remember about the boat that you were picked up on?"

"A blur of men in white and orange vests as they tried to get people on the boat and give blankets and life jackets to people. They-"

Once again the static came back in and started to make different sounds as I got even further away. Too busy focusing on the curve up ahead I didn't turn the volume down or turn the radio off. I was so busy that I almost didn't hear a word being spoken at first. 

"October. October. October. October. October. October"

I got an anxious feeling throughout my body as I felt the hair on my arms rise. This time I did turn off the radio. What the hell was that I thought to myself. I shivered despite the heat still being on blast. I definitely heard something. But at the same time that couldn't be it. Maybe I was picking up another local radio station, it happens when you drive into a new area and the radio frequencies change. Or something like that I don't know a whole lot about radio area waves but I needed to think so. Yeah, I thought to myself. That was it. I looked at the road ahead, with my car headlights lit up with more roads and trees. I had been driving with my high beams on since like I mentioned before there was no one else driving this late on the backroads out of the small town my parents lived in. I took a deep breath and decided to turn the radio back on. I was invested in the show and besides it was probably just another radio station frequency bleeding in. I pressed the radio back on.

"We got food. I don't know if it was because it was hot, or because of how much I swam and how tired I was but it was the best food I received."

"What were you thinking as the worst was over?"

I took a deep sigh and relaxed. My anxiety always gets the worst of me. Of course, it was nothing, radios are probably so underused now with aux systems that the frequency they reach is smaller. Even now the occasional burst of static would accompany the story. Besides it being the month of October that word meant not to me. I drove a little longer before the static started to get stronger. This time I turned the radio down just in case something else started to be said. However, even with the radio turned down, almost louder than before I heard a voice in the static. I couldn't make out the gender. It sounded like its voice was being run through a filter.

"I'm outside. I'm outside. I'm outside. I'm outside"

A shiver ran down my spine as I hit the radio button but the static got louder and so did the voice.

"The woods are breathing. The woods are breathing. The woods are breathing."

I started to speed up, I wanted out of the woods now. The voice stopped speaking but the static was just as loud. I turned the volume knob to no avail. I felt so creeped out like there was someone in the car with me. I looked in the rearview mirror and saw just vast darkness behind me as there were no cars behind me. Something moved. Something inside the car moved. I slammed my brakes and turned around and turned the interior lights in the backseat. Nothing. Just my jacket and purchases from earlier. Plus the leftovers that fell on the floor of my car from me braking so hard. I turned the lights off and gripped the steering wheel hard. I needed to get out of here. I put my foot on the gas and started to speed again, despite the curves. I just wanted to get out of here. With almost everything going on, I didn't realize the NPR talk show came back on. I tried turning it off or changing but it was stuck on the same segment. 

"I saw death and destruction. I couldn't escape it. It's all that surrounded me"

The host started to cry. Wailing. Loud. I started to hit the radio station with a fist. "Jesus fucking Christ! How is this happening?" I screamed alongside the host. I looked in the rearview mirror again. I saw the outline ofâ€¦ something in the car with me. This time I didn't turn back around. I keep driving. There were no street lights here. I wanted to get to the highway or pull over to the first gas station I saw. I kept driving as I felt something in the car with me. The crying of the host stopped and the static fully replaced it again. The familiar voice came back. 

"You should stop driving, it's late. You should stop driving, it's late"

I was nearly going a hundred miles an hour when the speed limit was fifty-five. I didn't care, I just wanted out of there. I looked in the rearview mirror and saw that the outline changed seats. To directly behind me. But I couldn't focus on that, the static was impossibly loud and it was hurting my ears. 

"I'm here"

The car died. All the lights on the dashboard came on, the static died and the car was alongside it. The car slowly came to a halt and I looked outside the car. All I saw were trees that gently moved with the breeze. In the far distance, I made out a humanoid outline peeking out from the side of the trees opposite where my car had died. I started to press the lights hoping something would turn on. Nothing. The powerful high-beam lights that had been guiding me to safety showed nothing. On the roof of the car, I heard heavy steps and I felt the hood of the car bending. With the weight of something. Or someone. I started to cry and hyperventilate. What could I do? Run out? With something in the woods? Could I fight it? With what? The country-fried steak I had back here? The outline started to get closer to my car from the woods. It started to cross the road towards my car. I got in the fetal position in my seat and closed my eyes and covered them with my hands. I didn't want to look at whatever was outside. I heard whatever was outside trying to open the door but thankfully I wasn't stupid to leave my door unlocked.

The whole night went by and nothing else happened. I didn't even realize it was daylight until I heard knocking on the window. I looked outside and saw an angry-looking state trooper staring at me with a flashlight. I didn't know what time it was and my car didn't display the correct time. I just saw that it was still dark but the sun was coming up. The whole night I heard what sounded like the car door trying to get open. I just sat there the whole time listening to something that I don't know what its intentions were to possibly hurt me. Or worse. I got up from the position and rolled the window down to answer the officer. "I'm Trooper Honeycutt with the State Highway Patrol. You wanna tell me why you got this vehicle in the middle of the road?" I blinked at him and thought about what I could tell him. The truth? I didn't want to end up in a psych ward. "My car died in the middle of the road. Just randomly. It wouldn't start back up. I don't know a lot about cars and it was pretty dark, also my phone was dead" The officer's face softened and he shined his flashlight in my backseat and the front of the car. "Couldn't even make it off the road, huh. Are you on anything right now?" What the fuck? "No officer" While the officer was shining his flashlight around he made a face. "You said you didn't get out of the car right?" I nodded then realized he couldn't see me. "Yes sir" "Then what's this?" For the first time since I left my parent's house I opened the door and saw what he was staring at and pointing his flashlight at. On the ground were footprints of someone's bare foot where they had left mud and clay from the nearby woods.
