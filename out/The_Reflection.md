A late night, i am going home from my job, exhausted and all  worn down. As i open the door to my apartment i long for a good night sleep. First thing i do is change to some more comfortable clothes and take a bath, i look at the clock, its 23:27. As I brush my teeth, i look in the mirror, and see something move behind me. I turn around quickly, but there is no one there. I turned back to the mirror, and my reflection was now facing the wrong way, its back to me.

My heart started racing, and I felt a cold sweat break out on my forehead. This wasn't normal. I leaned in closer to the mirror, trying to see if there was some sort of trick or illusion, but there was nothing there except for my own reflection.

Then, it turned around slowly, revealing a face that wasn't mine. It was twisted and evil, and I felt a chill run down my spine. Suddenly, my reflection reached out of the mirror, grabbed me by the arm, and pulled me through the glass.

I was now inside the mirror, trapped in a world of darkness and horror. My reflection stood before me, and I saw that it was no longer a mere copy of me. It had grown twisted and monstrous, and its eyes glowed with an otherworldly light.

"You have freed me," it hissed, "and now I will take your place."

I tried to run, but it was too late. The reflection was too strong, and it overpowered me. It dragged me back to the mirror and shoved me through the glass. I fell onto the bathroom floor, gasping for air.

But as I looked up, I saw that my reflection had taken over my body. It grinned at me from the other side of the mirror, and then smashed it to pieces with its fist.

I felt a searing pain in my chest, and then everything went black. When I woke up, I was still in the bathroom, but everything was different. The walls were black, the tiles were cracked, and there was a foul smell in the air.

I looked in the mirror, but I no longer had a reflection. Instead, I saw the twisted, demonic version of myself staring back at me. And then, I knew that I was doomed to spend eternity trapped in this twisted, hellish world.

I stumbled around, trying to find some way out, but the walls seemed to close in on me, making it hard to move. As I walked, I heard strange whispers coming from the shadows. The voices were too low for me to make out what they were saying, but they sounded like they were coming from all around me.

The whispers grew louder, and then suddenly, the bathroom door burst open. My heart leapt with hope as I saw a figure silhouetted in the doorway. But as it stepped closer, I realized with horror that it was my own reflection, now fully transformed into a demonic creature. It grinned at me, and I felt a wave of fear wash over me.

"It's time to pay for your mistake," it hissed.

I backed away slowly, but it was no use. The creature was too fast, too strong. It lunged at me, and I felt its claws tearing into my flesh. I screamed in pain, but it only laughed.

"You shouldn't have looked into the mirror," it said. "Now, you're mine."
