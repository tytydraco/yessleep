I moved into the apartment on a Thursday. It wasn’t much—peeling paint on the walls, uneven floors, and a kitchen that looked like it hadn’t been updated since the ‘70s—but it was cheap, and I needed cheap. The landlord handed me the keys with a nod, barely saying a word. He seemed eager to be rid of me, like he didn’t want to stick around.

The first thing I noticed was the smell. It wasn’t overpowering, but it was there. A damp, musty scent, like old wood left out in the rain. I shrugged it off. Old buildings smell like that sometimes.

The apartment was mostly empty, except for a few pieces of worn furniture that looked like they came from a thrift store. In the hallway, there was a mirror. It was tall, maybe six feet, with a thick gold frame that had intricate carvings along the edges. The glass was cloudy, smudged with dust and fingerprints.

I wasn’t sure why, but the mirror made me uneasy. It felt out of place, like it didn’t belong there. I told myself I was just being paranoid. Moving is stressful, and this was my first place on my own. Everything was bound to feel strange at first.

That first night, the apartment was eerily quiet. The kind of quiet that makes you feel like you’re being watched. I couldn’t sleep. Every creak of the floorboards made my skin crawl.

The next morning, I decided to clean. The mirror was the first thing I tackled. I grabbed an old rag and some glass cleaner and started scrubbing. As I wiped away the grime, I caught my reflection staring back at me.

Something about it didn’t feel right. I don’t know how to explain it, but it didn’t look like me. Not exactly. The movements were the same—I waved my hand, and the reflection waved back—but the eyes felt different. Like they were too aware, too focused.

I shook it off and finished cleaning. By the time the mirror was spotless, it looked like any other mirror. Just a piece of glass in a fancy frame.

That night, I couldn’t stop thinking about it. I told myself I was imagining things, that I was just spooked from being in a new place. But when I turned off the lights and climbed into bed, I could feel it—the mirror. It was like it was watching me.

I kept waking up. Every time I did, I found myself staring at the doorway where the mirror stood, just out of sight. My heart would race, and I’d have to remind myself to breathe. It’s just a mirror, I thought. Glass and wood. Nothing more.

By the third night, I started noticing things. Little things. A flicker of movement out of the corner of my eye. A shadow that didn’t match anything in the room. I told myself it was the light, the way it bounced off the glass.

But then, late that night, I saw something I couldn’t explain. I was in bed, staring at the ceiling, trying to calm my mind. I glanced toward the hallway and froze.

The reflection wasn’t mine.

It was standing in the mirror, staring into the bedroom. The face was mine, but the expression wasn’t. It was twisted, wrong. The eyes were wide, unblinking. The mouth was curled into a faint, unnatural smile.

I blinked, and it was gone.

I stayed awake until dawn, my back pressed against the headboard, clutching the blanket like it could protect me.

The mirror hasn’t moved, but something tells me it doesn’t need to. Whatever is in there, it’s waiting. Watching.

And I don’t know how much longer I can ignore it.

I didn’t sleep that night. Every creak, every groan of the old apartment sent my heart racing. I kept looking at the hallway, expecting to see that twisted face again. It didn’t show up, but that didn’t make me feel any better.

When the first bit of sunlight crept through the blinds, I finally got up. My legs felt shaky as I made my way to the hallway. The mirror was right where it had been, tall and still, with the morning light glinting off its surface.

For a moment, I just stood there, staring at it. The reflection was normal now—just me, tired and pale, with dark circles under my eyes. I wanted to believe that what I’d seen was a dream, but deep down, I knew it wasn’t.

I grabbed a sheet from the closet and threw it over the mirror. The fabric caught on the edges of the ornate frame, covering it entirely. I stood back, feeling a small sense of relief. If I couldn’t see it, maybe it couldn’t see me either.

That didn’t last long.

The rest of the day, I couldn’t focus on anything. I tried unpacking more boxes, but every time I walked past the hallway, I felt it. The mirror was still there, even hidden under the sheet. I couldn’t explain it, but it was like the air around it was heavier.

By the time night rolled around, I was on edge. I left the lights on, every single one. Even then, I kept glancing toward the hallway.

Around midnight, the sound started.

It was faint at first. A soft tapping, like someone gently knocking on glass. I froze, my heart hammering in my chest. The sound was coming from the hallway—from the mirror.

Tap. Tap. Tap.

I didn’t move. I didn’t breathe.

The tapping grew louder, more insistent. It wasn’t random—it had a rhythm, like someone was trying to get my attention.

I grabbed my phone and turned on the flashlight. My hands were trembling as I crept toward the hallway. The tapping stopped the moment I stepped closer.

The sheet was still in place, draped over the mirror. Nothing had changed, but I knew better.

I wanted to walk away. To go back to my room, lock the door, and pretend none of this was happening. But something compelled me to stay. My hand reached out, almost on its own, and I pulled the sheet down.

The mirror was spotless, the glass smooth and perfect. My reflection stared back at me, but it wasn’t right. It looked normal, but the eyes… they felt too sharp, too alive.

I wanted to step away, but I couldn’t. My reflection leaned forward, even though I wasn’t moving.

“Why are you scared?” it whispered.

The voice wasn’t mine. It was cold, distant, like it was coming from deep inside the mirror.

I stumbled back, almost tripping over my own feet. The reflection didn’t follow me this time—it stayed in the glass, smiling faintly.

“Don’t ignore me,” it said.

The lights in the hallway flickered, and the reflection began to blur. For a split second, I thought I saw something else in the glass—a dark shape, taller than me, with hollow eyes. But then it was gone.

I ran back to my room and slammed the door shut. My breathing was shallow, my hands shaking as I pressed my back against the door.

I didn’t sleep at all that night.

By morning, I decided I couldn’t stay here. I didn’t care about breaking the lease or losing the deposit—I just needed to get out.

But when I tried to leave, the front door wouldn’t budge.

The lock turned easily, and the handle moved, but it was like something was holding the door shut. I pulled harder, throwing my weight into it, but it didn’t make a difference.

Behind me, I heard the tapping again.

Tap. Tap. Tap.

I turned slowly, my stomach twisting into knots. The mirror was still in the hallway, uncovered now, and my reflection was back.

It wasn’t smiling anymore. It looked angry.

“You can’t leave,” it said.

The voice wasn’t a whisper this time. It was loud, filling the apartment.

I backed away, pressing myself against the front door. My reflection stepped closer, even though I hadn’t moved.

“You belong to me now,” it said.

The lights flickered again, and the apartment felt colder. I don’t know how long I stood there, staring at the mirror. But when the lights finally came back on, the reflection was gone.

The mirror was empty.

I tried the door again, and this time it opened. I didn’t think—I just ran. Out of the apartment, down the stairs, into the street.

I haven’t gone back.

But sometimes, when I pass by the building, I can feel it. The mirror is still in there, waiting.

And sometimes, I think it’s watching me.

I didn’t know what to do after that. I’d left the apartment behind, but it didn’t feel like I’d escaped. The first few nights at my friend Taylor’s place were quiet. I slept on her couch, with the TV on for background noise, and told myself everything would be fine.

But it wasn’t fine.

I hadn’t told Taylor much, just that the apartment creeped me out and I needed a place to crash. She didn’t ask questions, which I appreciated. But I couldn’t keep pretending nothing was wrong.

The first sign came three nights later. I woke up in a cold sweat at 3 a.m. The TV was still playing some late-night infomercial, but the sound was muted. I glanced around the room, heart racing, and then I saw it.

My reflection.

There was a large window behind Taylor’s couch, and in the faint glow of the street lights outside, I could see my reflection in the glass. Except it wasn’t just mine.

Something else was there, standing just behind me.

It was the same dark figure I’d seen in the mirror, its hollow eyes staring at me through the glass.

I whipped around, but there was nothing there. My breath came in short, shallow gasps as I stared at the empty room. When I turned back to the window, the figure was gone.

I didn’t sleep for the rest of the night.

The next morning, Taylor noticed the bags under my eyes. “You look like hell,” she said, handing me a cup of coffee. “You sure you’re okay?”

I wanted to tell her everything, but where would I even start? “Yeah,” I mumbled. “Just couldn’t sleep.”

She gave me a look but didn’t push it.

That day, I tried to keep busy. I scrolled through apartment listings, went for a walk, even helped Taylor with some errands. But no matter what I did, I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was being watched.

By the time the sun set, my nerves were shot. I told Taylor I wasn’t feeling well and went to bed early, hoping sleep would come if I just shut my eyes and waited.

It didn’t.

Around midnight, I heard it again.

Tap. Tap. Tap.

I froze, my eyes snapping open. The sound was coming from the window this time.

I sat up slowly, my heart pounding so hard it hurt. The curtains were drawn, but the tapping continued, steady and deliberate.

I didn’t want to look. I didn’t want to know. But something pulled me toward the window anyway.

I reached out with a trembling hand and pulled the curtain back.

There was nothing there. Just the empty street below and the dim glow of a streetlamp.

I let out a shaky breath and turned away, but then I heard it. A voice, soft and familiar, whispering my name.

I spun back to the window, and there it was. My reflection.

But it wasn’t right.

The glass didn’t show the room behind me. Instead, it showed the hallway from my old apartment. The mirror.

And my reflection was smiling again.

“You can’t run,” it said.

The voice sent chills down my spine. It wasn’t coming from the window—it was in my head, echoing like a bad memory.

I stumbled back, tripping over the edge of the couch. My reflection didn’t follow me this time. It stayed in the window, grinning, its empty eyes locked onto mine.

“Leave me alone!” I shouted, my voice cracking.

Taylor came rushing into the room, her face a mix of confusion and concern. “What’s going on?” she asked.

I pointed at the window, but when she turned to look, it was just a window again. My reflection was normal, the hallway and the mirror gone.

“I… I thought I saw something,” I stammered.

Taylor frowned, crossing her arms. “You’re freaking me out. Are you sure everything’s okay?”

I wanted to tell her the truth, but how could I? She’d think I was losing my mind. Maybe I was.

“Yeah,” I lied. “Just a bad dream.”

She didn’t look convinced, but she nodded. “Alright. But if you need to talk, I’m here, okay?”

I nodded, forcing a weak smile.

When she left the room, I collapsed onto the couch, my head in my hands. I couldn’t keep living like this. The mirror wasn’t just in that apartment—it was following me.

And I had no idea how to make it stop.

The next day, I knew I couldn’t ignore it any longer. Whatever was happening, whatever *it* was, I needed answers.

I didn’t say much to Taylor that morning. She was already on edge from the night before, giving me that look people give when they’re not sure if you’re okay but don’t know how to ask. I just told her I had errands to run and left.

My first stop was the library. It felt old-fashioned, but Googling “haunted mirror” and “weird reflections” hadn’t gotten me very far. At least at the library, I could dig deeper, maybe even find some local stories about the apartment or the building.

The librarian was a small, older woman with kind eyes. She didn’t ask why I needed information on “strange occurrences in apartments” or “haunted objects,” which I appreciated. She simply pointed me toward a section of local history books and articles.

I spent hours flipping through yellowed pages and faded photographs. Most of it was boring—city planning, old businesses, stories of long-dead locals—but one article caught my attention.

It was from the 1970s, about a man named Richard Ames. He’d lived in my old apartment, the same one with the mirror. The headline read: “Mysterious Disappearance Leaves More Questions Than Answers.”

The story detailed how Richard Ames had vanished without a trace. Neighbors reported hearing strange noises coming from his apartment late at night—whispers, laughter, tapping on the walls. The landlord found the place empty a week later, except for one thing: a massive gold-framed mirror, left in the hallway.

The description matched the mirror exactly.

I leaned back in my chair, my pulse racing. The article didn’t explain what happened to Richard or why he disappeared, but it felt like confirmation. This wasn’t just in my head. The mirror had a history.

But what did it want with me?

I copied down the article’s details and headed home. Well, to Taylor’s home. It didn’t feel like mine anymore.

When I got there, she was waiting for me, arms crossed. “You’ve been gone all day,” she said. “Are you okay?”

I hesitated. I’d been brushing her off for days, but I couldn’t do it anymore. “I need to tell you something,” I said, my voice quieter than I wanted it to be.

Taylor frowned but gestured for me to sit down. “Alright, spill.”

So, I told her everything. The mirror, the reflection, the tapping, the voice. I left nothing out.

When I finished, Taylor just stared at me, her mouth slightly open. “You’re serious?” she finally said.

I nodded.

She sighed, rubbing her temples. “Okay. This is… a lot. But if you think this mirror is haunted or cursed or whatever, why don’t we just go back to the apartment and get rid of it?”

Her suggestion caught me off guard. The thought of going back made my stomach churn, but she had a point. If the mirror was the source of all this, destroying it might be the only way to end it.

“I don’t know if that’ll work,” I said. “But I’m willing to try.”

Taylor grabbed her car keys before I could change my mind. “Then let’s do it. The sooner, the better.”

The drive to the apartment was tense. I hadn’t been back since I left, and seeing the building again made my chest tighten. It looked the same—run-down, quiet—but now I knew better.

We went up the stairs, and I unlocked the door with the spare key I still had. The air inside was stale, and the musty smell hit me immediately. The mirror was right where I’d left it, in the hallway, its gold frame catching the faint light from the window.

Taylor walked up to it, inspecting it like it was just another piece of furniture. “This is it?” she asked.

I nodded, staying a few steps back.

She tapped the glass. “Doesn’t look so scary to me.”

Before I could respond, the reflection shifted.

Taylor froze, her hand still against the glass. Her reflection turned to look directly at her, even though she wasn’t moving.

“What the hell…” she whispered, stepping back.

The reflection didn’t mimic her. Instead, it smiled—a wide, unnatural grin that didn’t belong on her face.

“Taylor, get away from it!” I yelled.

But it was too late.

The mirror started to hum, a low, vibrating sound that made my teeth ache. The air around us felt heavy, like the room was collapsing in on itself.

“Do you see that?” Taylor shouted, backing away.

I saw it. The surface of the mirror rippled like water, and the reflection reached out. A hand—Taylor’s hand, but *not* Taylor’s—pressed against the glass from the inside, its fingers curling as if trying to break through.

“Run!” I screamed, grabbing her arm and yanking her toward the door.

The mirror’s hum grew louder, almost deafening, and the distorted reflection of Taylor watched us with that same twisted grin.

We didn’t stop running until we were outside, gasping for air.

“What the hell was that?” Taylor panted, her face pale.

“I don’t know,” I said, my voice shaking. “But I think it wants more than just a reflection.”

Neither of us spoke for a long time. We just sat on the curb outside the building, catching our breath, our minds racing. Taylor was the first to break the silence.

“What do we do now?” she asked. Her voice was shaky, but there was a sharpness to it, a demand for answers I didn’t have.

“I don’t know,” I admitted. “But we can’t just leave it there. It’s… dangerous. I mean, you saw it. That thing isn’t just some creepy trick. It’s—”

“Alive,” she finished for me. “Or something close to it.”

We sat there a little longer, the weight of what we’d seen pressing down on us. The mirror wasn’t just haunted. It wasn’t just showing strange reflections. It was *something else*, something I couldn’t explain.

“We should destroy it,” Taylor said finally.

Her words hung in the air, heavy and final. Destroying it felt like the logical choice, but the thought of going back in there, of facing that thing again, made my stomach churn.

“What if it doesn’t work?” I asked. “What if breaking it makes it worse?”

Taylor gave me a sharp look. “Worse than it already is? That thing tried to pull me in. I’m not letting it sit there and wait for someone else to stumble onto it.”

She was right. As much as I wanted to run away, to never think about that mirror again, I couldn’t leave it behind for someone else to find.

“Alright,” I said. “But we need to be smart about it. If we’re going to destroy it, we need to make sure it’s gone for good.”

Taylor nodded, her jaw set. “Let’s do it tonight. Before we lose our nerve.”





The hours dragged by as we made our plan. We’d bring tools—hammers, a crowbar, whatever we could find—to break the mirror apart. We’d bag up the pieces and take them far away from the apartment, maybe to the river or some secluded spot where no one would ever find them.

Taylor raided her dad’s garage for supplies while I sat at her kitchen table, staring at the article I’d found about Richard Ames. I couldn’t stop thinking about him. Had he tried to destroy the mirror? Had it stopped him?

When Taylor returned, her arms loaded with tools, I pushed the thought away. We didn’t have time for second-guessing.

“You ready?” she asked, setting a sledgehammer on the floor with a thud.

“Not really,” I said honestly. “But let’s do it.”





We drove back to the apartment just before midnight. The streets were empty, and the building loomed in the dark, its windows like hollow eyes.

The air inside was colder than before, and the silence felt oppressive. My heart was pounding as we made our way to the hallway, the tools clanking in the bag Taylor carried.

The mirror was waiting for us, just like before. Its surface was still and smooth, but I could feel it watching us.

“Let’s get this over with,” Taylor muttered, pulling the sledgehammer from the bag.

She handed me a crowbar, and we stood in front of the mirror, both of us hesitating.

“Do you feel that?” I asked, my voice barely above a whisper.

Taylor nodded. “Yeah. Like it’s… alive.”

I tightened my grip on the crowbar. “On three?”

She nodded again.

“One… two…”

Before I could say three, the mirror rippled. The smooth surface shifted, and our reflections appeared—not as they should have been, but wrong. Twisted.

Taylor’s reflection had empty black eyes and a smile stretched too wide, like it was pulled by invisible strings. Mine was worse. It wasn’t smiling. It was staring at me, its head tilted, its expression full of something I couldn’t name.

Fear. Hunger. Hate.

“Do it!” I shouted.

Taylor swung the sledgehammer with all her strength. The impact rang out like a gunshot, and the mirror cracked, a jagged line splitting down the middle.

The reflections didn’t shatter. They moved.

Taylor swung again, and the crack widened, but now the mirror was humming, the same low, vibrating sound as before. The room felt like it was spinning, the air thick and heavy.

“Keep going!” I yelled, raising the crowbar and slamming it against the glass.

The mirror groaned, like a living thing in pain. More cracks spread across its surface, but the reflections were still there, moving, pressing against the glass as if trying to break through.

“Why isn’t it breaking?” Taylor screamed, hitting it again and again.

I didn’t answer. I couldn’t. The humming was deafening now, and the cracks in the glass were glowing, a sickly, unnatural light spilling out.

Then, the mirror screamed.

It was a sound I’ll never forget—high-pitched, inhuman, full of rage and despair. The light from the cracks flared, blinding us, and the air around us seemed to explode.

I was thrown backward, hitting the wall hard. The last thing I saw before everything went black was the mirror shattering, the pieces flying in every direction like shards of light.

And then, silence.

When I came to, everything was quiet. Too quiet.

My head was pounding, and I struggled to sit up. The hallway was dim, lit only by the faint flicker of a street lamp outside. Broken shards of glass glittered on the floor like tiny stars, and the tools Taylor and I had brought lay scattered.

“Taylor?” My voice came out hoarse, barely above a whisper. I looked around, panic building in my chest when I didn’t see her.

Then I heard a groan.

“Taylor!” I scrambled toward the sound, my hands crunching over shards of glass. She was slumped against the wall a few feet away, clutching her arm.

“Hey, hey, are you okay?” I asked, grabbing her shoulders.

She blinked at me, her eyes dazed. “What… what happened?”

“The mirror,” I said. “It shattered.”

Her gaze shifted to the pile of broken glass, and she let out a shaky breath. “Is it… gone?”

“I don’t know,” I admitted. My voice trembled despite my efforts to stay calm.

We both turned to look at the spot where the mirror had hung. The golden frame was still there, but the glass was gone—reduced to a million tiny pieces scattered across the floor.

But something felt off.

The air was heavy, like the moment before a thunderstorm. And there was a faint sound, so quiet I almost missed it. A whisper.

“Do you hear that?” I asked.

Taylor’s face went pale. “Yeah. It’s coming from…”

We both turned to the largest shard of glass lying on the floor. The whispering was louder now, rising and falling like a chant in a language I couldn’t understand.

“I think we need to leave,” Taylor said, her voice tight.

I nodded, but my legs felt like lead. I couldn’t take my eyes off the shard. There was something in it—movement, shapes twisting and writhing just beneath the surface.

“Come on,” Taylor urged, pulling at my arm.

That snapped me out of it. I stood, gripping her hand, and we stumbled out of the hallway. My heart was racing as we ran down the stairs and out into the cold night air.

We didn’t stop until we were a block away. Only then did we turn to look back at the building.

The window on the second floor—the one closest to where the mirror had been—was glowing faintly.

Taylor shivered. “What do we do now?”

I didn’t have an answer. Destroying the mirror had felt like the only solution, but whatever we’d done hadn’t fixed things. If anything, it felt worse.

“We need help,” I said finally. “Someone who knows about… this kind of thing.”

“Like an exorcist?” Taylor asked, her voice dripping with skepticism.

“Maybe,” I said. “I don’t know. But we can’t just leave it like this.”

Taylor sighed, rubbing her face with her hands. “Okay. But not tonight. I can’t… I just can’t.”

I nodded. I didn’t blame her. My whole body ached, and my mind was a mess.

We went back to her car and sat in silence for a while, trying to process what had happened.

But as we sat there, I couldn’t shake the feeling that we weren’t alone.





That night, I stayed at Taylor’s place. Neither of us slept. We sat in her living room with the lights on, jumping at every creak and shadow.

Around three in the morning, my phone buzzed.

The screen lit up with a notification: "Missed Call – Unknown."

My heart skipped a beat.

“Who is it?” Taylor asked, her voice wary.

I didn’t answer. My hands were trembling as I unlocked the phone and checked my voicemail.

There was a new message.

With a deep breath, I pressed play.

At first, there was only static. Then, faintly, I heard it.

My own voice.

“Don’t look behind you.”

A cold chill ran down my spine. Taylor must have seen the look on my face because her eyes widened.

“What is it?” she asked.

I didn’t answer. I couldn’t.

Because I could feel it.

Something was behind me.

I didn’t turn around.

And I don’t think I ever will.
