  I finished college about 2 years ago. I graduated with a bachelor's degree majoring in mechanical engineering. Right after college I got a pretty decent job designing electronics that you would usually find in a kitchen (Fridge, Microwave ETC). I saved up some money so I could buy my own apartment/house. I saved up around $300,000. 

I finally decided that it was time to purchase myself a house. I loaded up a house listing website and I started to browse. I quickly realized $300,000 wasnt alot when it came to house shopping. The cheapest house I could find was going for around $475,000. I started to lose hope when I filtered by price (Lowest-Highest). The lowest listing was a decently sized house (1 Bath, 2 Bedrooms) for about $100,000. It was a nice piece of land. It is surrounded by woods which I thought was weird but I didn't think much of it. This was too good to be true. 

I immediately messaged the seller and asked her why the house was so cheap. She told me that she has a terminal illness and that she doesn't have any living relatives to give her remaining worth to. She said she wanted to give a young person like me a decent sized house for cheap. Do a good death before she passes I guess. 

I was sold. I mean come on, who would pass up a once in a lifetime deal like that?! I told her that I was interested in purchasing the house and we got to business. I bought the house for around $90,000 because she said she felt bad charging so much due to the house's “Issues”. I asked her to reiterate but she simply ignored my request. I told her I would meet her the following week.

When I arrived at the house I was stunned. It was beautiful. There were nice pink and blue flowers in the yard, there were nicely trimmed hedges following the walkway to the front door, The yard was clean. It was amazing. The woman showed me around the house. She had already cleared out all of the furniture. As we toured the 2nd floor I noticed that we skipped over a door. I asked her what was in there. She simply responded “Oh, Nothing you have to worry about”. I thought she was kidding so I chuckled a little bit. As I regained eye contact I realized her face was stone cold. I stopped laughing and we finished up. 

I rented a U-Haul and started to pack up my stuff from my parents house. By the time I was fully packed it was around 8:00 pm. I decided to stay at my parents house for the night as I didn't have any furniture bought yet. I woke up pretty early the next day (Around 5:00 am) and drove to my new house. My parents gave me some furniture from their house as they were gonna upgrade to some new stuff. I finished up around noon the same day. I was pretty exhausted so I decided to go for a nap in my new bedroom. I set my alarm for about 30 minutes and went to sleep.

My eyes slowly creeped open. I tiredly peered over towards my phone. I grabbed it and turned it on. The bright wallpaper made my drowsy eyes hurt. As my eyes adjusted they settled and the time. “11:00pm”. “Ah man” I thought to myself. I knew that I would probably be up all night. I got up and decided to get a quick shower. I got dressed and headed downstairs. I didn't want to just play on my phone for the next few hours so I headed to the nearest Best Buy. It closed at 12:00am so I had some time. I decided I was gonna pick up a TV and hook my laptop up to it until I get a TV box. I bought this really nice 55in Flat screen for about $750. I left the store and packed up my car.

I started to pull up my house when I spotted something strange. The streetlight was illuminating the front of my house in this orange-ish glow so I could see basically everything. As I pulled into my driveway I swear I saw something scurry across the large window that peeks into the living room. I let a large gasp. My heart started to race. I really wanted to drive away but I swallowed my fears and exited the car, never breaking my gaze on the window. “It's nothing you scaredy cat” i thought. I grabbed the TV out of the trunk and headed in the house. 

I set up the TV and I plugged my laptop into it. I loaded up netflix and started to binge watch some of my favorite shows. I made some food and started to relax. The event that took place as I arrived back slipped out of my mind with every second that passed. Around 2:00 am I finished the current season of the show I was watching. I started to feel a little bit sleepy so I loaded up a podcast on YouTube and laid down on the couch.

SMASH… I jumped off the couch at the sound of something breaking upstairs. I looked at the clock on the microwave across the room. It read “3:47AM”. I had packed a backpack full of my most important items when I moved in. One of these items was a gift I received from my father. A Glock-19 (We are originally from Texas. We are a big gun family…) . I ran over to the bag and zipped it open. I shuffled through my belongings until I felt the bumpy grip. I took it out and turned off the safety.

I slowly approached the stairs, holding the pistol with two hands. I placed my foot on the first step and started to advance. As I reached the top I headed toward my bedroom first. I swung open the door and started to aim the Glock around. On the ground was a glass candle holder, smashed into pieces. The bedroom window was fully opened and the curtains were swaying back and forth. I closed the bedroom door and locked it. I turned on the bedroom light and started to head towards the window, stepping over the broken glass in the process.

I moved the curtains out of the way with the front of the gun. To my relief there was nothing out there. I closed the window shut and placed the Glock on top of my dresser. I headed downstairs and grabbed my phone, along with a broom and a dust pan. I cleaned up the glass and threw it out. I entered my room and locked the door once again. I picked up the Glock and got into bed. I pulled the covers over my body and pulled out my phone. I started to play a game in my right hand, my left hand was on the trigger of the Glock under the covers.

I woke up around 9:00 am that morning. I started to get out of bed. As I proceeded to stand the glock fell off of the bed and landed on the hardwood floor. I screamed, thinking it was gonna go off. Thankfully it never happened. I turned on the safety and placed it under my pillow.

Some time passed. About a month from that night. Nothing unusual happened during that time. I settled in nicely and started to forget about what happened. One night I got a bit caught up at work so I had to stay late. It was about 1:00 am when I got home. I noticed that the lights were off inside. I know for a fact I left them on when I left for work. I unlocked the front door and tried the lightswitch. Nothing. 

I sighed and headed out to the breaker at the back of the house (Not the greatest security feature i know). As I opened the breaker I caught movement out of the corner of my eye. I paused for a second then slowly turned my head left towards the backdoor. The small curtain on the door's window was moving. My heart dropped. I messed around with the breaker and eventually all the lights turned on. I peered at the back door one more time as I headed to the front of the house. 

My Glock was on my hip (I started carrying it on me after the first event happened, you know, just in case!) I gripped it as I entered the front door. Everything looked normal. Maybe I was seeing things. My nerves calmed down a little bit. As I started to relax I noticed that the hallway light upstairs wasn't on. A puzzled look washed over my face. As I headed up the creaky wooden stairs I saw some glow coming from under a door. The one I was told not to worry about. I advanced up the stairs and up to the door. I slowly reached for the handle with my left hand. The metal doorknob was ice cold. I slowly started to twist it. I felt a small click and I pushed on the door…

Inside was a bathroom. It had these weird light blueish/green tiles on the walls. It looked like something straight out of the 50s. I stepped into the room. It smelt like bleach in there, as if someone recently cleaned it. There was a sink, a light blue bathtub. A light blue toilet and a mirror on the wall. There was something off about this room though. The mirror looked dirty and old compared to the squeaky clean room. I walked in front of the mirror, looking down. I slowly started to peer my head up towards the wall. There, staring back at me was my reflection. I'm not sure what I expected to be honest. But… Something wasn't right. It seemed like my reflection was almost delayed. If i moved my arm my reflection would do it like 300ms after. Almost like lag in a video game.

This creeped me out. I thought my mind was playing tricks on me. I started to reach for my Glock slowly. I was gonna draw really quickly and see what happened to my reflection. I took my chance. I whipped it out of the holster as fast as possible. My reflection followed. As I stopped my arm my reflection accidentally flung the Glock upwards. That was enough for me. Out of pure fear I unloaded the mag into the mirror with my eyes closed. The gun started to click. I was out of bullets. I opened my eyes slowly. The mirror was reduced to shards on the counter. I didn't stay there long. I ran out of the house and got into my car. I drove towards the city and called my parents. I explained everything that happened. They didn't believe me. They told me I could stay at their house for the night.

The next morning I tried calling the seller. Everytime i would try it would just hang up right away. I decided to search her name up on Google to see if she has a Facebook or something. The search came back with nothing… except a link for an obituary website. I clicked it and it brought me to an obituary of this lady. I assumed that maybe her terminal illness killed her. There was a little section that talked about the cause of death. As I started to read my jaw dropped. “Cause Of Death: Self Inflicted Gunshot Wound.” I couldn't believe it. She lied to me. She didn't sell the house to me because she was dying. She sold it to me because it was haunted.

This all happened around 4 Years ago. I have since moved far away from that place. I started my own tech company and it had some very major success. It made me pretty wealthy. I hired a local company to tear down that house completely around 2 years ago and I sold the land. I will never be the same. I have a huge fear of mirrors now, for obvious reasons of course. I have a really nice mansion now. The breaker is inside the garage. There are absolutely 0 Mirrors in my house. I'm engaged and I have 1 kid. Life definitely got better.

Sometimes I will look into mirrors by accident at stores or other people's houses. Sometimes I swear it's delayed again. But I'm probably seeing things. Though i said the same thing when i saw the shadow in the window so who knows. I just hope it never happens again…
