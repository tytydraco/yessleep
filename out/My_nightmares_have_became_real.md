I am terrified of going to sleep. Every night, I lie in bed, staring at the ceiling, too afraid to close my eyes. It all started a few weeks ago when I had a nightmare that felt too real to be just a dream. I remember being in a dark, musty room with a pale white monster that had translucent skin. Its eyes were black and empty, and it smelled of rusty iron and ammonia. The monster was staring at me, and I could feel its gaze pierce through my soul.

Suddenly, the monster lunged at me, and I woke up screaming, drenched in sweat. I thought it was over, but then I noticed a sharp pain in my arm. When I looked down, I saw a deep cut that wasn't there before, and it was bleeding profusely. I was confused and scared, wondering how I could have hurt myself in my sleep.

The next night, I tried to stay awake, but eventually, exhaustion took over, and I drifted off into a restless sleep. Once again, I found myself in that dark room with the monster. It was closer this time, its pale skin almost touching mine. I could feel its breath on my face as it whispered something I couldn't understand.

Then, the monster attacked me again, and I woke up screaming once more. This time, I had a cut on my leg, the same kind of cut as the one on my arm from the previous night. I was terrified and confused, wondering how this was happening to me.

The following nights were no different. Every time I slept, I found myself in that dark room with the monster, and every time, it attacked me, leaving me with a new cut on my body. I was scared for my life, and I didn't know what to do.

One day, I decided to seek help from a sleep specialist. They ran some tests, but everything came back normal. I was told that it was just my imagination playing tricks on me, and that I needed to relax and get some rest.

But I knew it wasn't just my imagination. That monster was real, and it was coming for me every night. I didn't know what to do until one day, I stumbled upon an old book about spirits and demons. I read that some demons could enter our dreams and harm us, leaving physical marks on our bodies.

I knew then that I was dealing with something beyond my comprehension. I started researching ways to protect myself from evil spirits, and I found some rituals that might help. I started burning sage in my room, and I placed protective crystals under my pillow.

Finally, one night, I fell asleep, and I found myself again in that dark room with the monster. But this time, something was different. The monster was hesitant, as if it was afraid of me. I stood my ground, holding up a protective crystal, and the monster backed away, disappearing into the darkness.

The next morning, I woke up, and I felt different. I wasn't scared anymore. I knew that I had faced my fears and conquered them. I looked at my body, and there were no new cuts. I knew then that the monster was gone for good.

Or so I thought... I started to notice strange occurrences happening around me. Things would move on their own, and I would hear whispers in the middle of the night. I didn't understand what was happening, but I knew that it had something to do with the monster.

One night, I heard a loud pounding on my door. I froze in fear, knowing that I live alone and it was at my bedroom door.I tried to muster up the courage to face whatever it was. As the door creaked open, and I saw the thing standing before me. It was no longer just a nightmare; it was real, and it had a name.

"I am Kalkan," the monster spoke, its voice deep and guttural growl that turned my skin pale and cold "And I have come for you." My ears started to ring and to heart started to race. 

I couldn't move, couldn't speak. I was paralyzed with fear as Kalkan approached me. It was then that I realized that I was going to die. His skin radiating with that horrible smell and his teeth being brighter then what I remember. 

Kalkaska stood there and stared at me...as I'm typing this he's still watching me as if he wants me to.  I felt that my time was limited, but I had to warn others about Kalkan, about the danger that was coming for them. "Bring them to me child" Kalkan spoke with a thunderous tone that rang through my head. 

As I wrote, Kalkan watched me with curiosity, as if amused by my feeble attempts to warn others. But I didn't give up. As I'm typing this a sharp pain is in my chest. I can hear his voice egging me on to infect others with him...he's going to kill me this time I'm sure of it. 

I want to leave behind a warning to those who would read my story. Kalkan is REAL, and is coming for you next. I'm sorry that I tricked you all into cursing yourself. Kalkan told me he's hungry and I must feed him the stories of others... to find him you... I have to be honest as it's too late now.

You

The fallen god...the grand architect of the library.
