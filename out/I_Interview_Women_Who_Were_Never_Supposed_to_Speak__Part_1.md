**Dr. Aman Rajput.**
 
That was the name people used with reverence.

The man behind the most exclusive psychiatrist's door in Mumbai. CEOs, actors, ministers—if they bled, they bled quietly into my leather couch. My clinic, tucked neatly between embassies and luxury boutiques, was a sanctuary of muted tones, soft jazz, and whispered breakdowns.

People trusted me.

When journalists asked how I got them to open up, I used to joke, *“My memory’s too weak to hold onto secrets.”*

That was only half a lie. I had trained myself to forget. To compartmentalize. 

Every confession left in that room stayed there. 
I rebooted after each patient.
No residue. No judgment.

Only control.
That’s what I built my life around. Control. Order. Logic.

And then there was Elena.
She was everything I wasn’t— unfiltered, inconvenient, audacious. Golden like sunlight slipping through blinds I hadn’t asked to be opened. She laughed too loudly. She questioned my opinions at dinner parties. 

Once, she asked if I’d ever considered therapy. The audacity. Only she could get away with it.

An upcoming journalist who defied all kinds of order, she was organic, uncomplicated and stunningly beautiful.

I was attracted to her free spirit and kind nature. I married her, I could give her everything she wanted. 

Opposites attract they say, the first couple of years were smooth sailing.

She was in her third trimester when things started to shift. 

She had a miscarriage. It was a crushing blow on us and our marriage.

We argued. Sure. What couple doesn’t? She hated how I worked late. Called me obsessive. I said she didn’t understand pressure. Sometimes she cried. Sometimes I left.

But it never went beyond that.

Then she changed. Grew quiet. Her phone never left her side. I told myself it was hormones. Mood swings. Something temporary.

Until I found the videos.

**Arjun Patama.** A rising YouTuber. 
All smug confidence, spouting pseudo-science and men’s rights nonsense. His voice was too familiar. Too rehearsed.
And Elena? She wasn’t just watching—she was engaging. Liking, sharing, reacting. There were explicit DMs. Late-night livestreams. Memes. Private jokes. Something she used to share with me before our unfortunate miscarriage.

Something inside me... ruptured.

And then, she was gone.

I came home one night to the smell of burnt coffee and silence. That kind of silence that’s too heavy to be real.
Elena lay there, in the hallway, her eyes fixed on the ceiling, unblinking. No marks. No struggle. No answers.

But I knew.

The rumors came fast — cold husband, distant marriage, maybe she overdosed, maybe she wanted out. Then the texts surfaced. She’d messaged a friend, talking about a “manipulative presence” in her life. They thought it was me.

The jury didn’t like my calm. My composure.
They wanted guilt in a more theatrical form.

I gave them nothing.

So they gave me life.


--Two years passed.
I barely spoke. Didn’t sleep. I lived with the ghost of her silence. With the memory of a stranger named Arjun Patama who’d somehow invaded my life. 

I remembered the guy, I knew him.
He was my patient once upon a time, left halfway, a complete schmuck... maybe that's how they met. 
Trash attracting flies. 

I thought a lot about the ways I would torture him, I was sure he was responsible for Elena's death somehow. There was just no evidence.

Then, one night, something changed.

A shadow entered my cell.

Not a guard. Not a man. Not a woman either. Tall. Pale. Dressed like a funeral director with eyes like cracked glass that seemed to look through time itself.

*“Dr. Rajput,”* the strange being said. *“We’ve been watching you.”*

I didn’t flinch. *“Who are you?”*
They smiled faintly. *“Don't be scared, I am on your side. You can call me **Y**.* They gave a hint of a smile. 

*I represent an agency... one that works with women the world has failed. Misjudged. Misunderstood. We help rehabilitate them. We help them tell their stories.”*

I frowned. *“And what does that have to do with me?”*

*“We need someone to help us understand a few of them. Someone with your expertise. Your clinical eye. Your... distance.”*

*“Why me?”* I still could not understand the strangeness of both the being and the request.

*“Because you’ve lost one. Because your story overlaps with theirs more than you’d like to admit. And because understanding them might be the only way left to understand yourself.”*

They paused, letting the silence stretch.

*“Four women. Four interviews. Each one… complicated. If you complete them, you walk free.”*

I stared with disbelief, *“This has to be a joke. Why women? And is my freedom so easy? After two painful years of court hearings and judgements.”*

Y’s smile didn’t falter. *“Because the only truth you’ve never been able to face is theirs. Trust me, I am the best...actually only shot you have at freedom right now.”*

There was something compelling in their tone. An air of finality.

I didn’t believe in fate. But I understood patterns. And this one felt familiar. Necessary.

So I said yes. On pure instinct. I felt like I had no other choice.

Not for redemption. Not even for truth. This one drew me in.

I said yes to prove that I was still right.

**Y** led me out of my cell. Strangely none of the guards even looked at us.
We walked through a series of corridors I’d never seen before — sterile monotonous labyrinths.
Until I stood before a strange massive door carved from dark wood, heavy with age.

It groaned open as we approached.
The room inside looked nothing like a prison.

Think Velvet drapes. Carved chairs. The air thick with sandalwood and something sharper—like iron.

I was handed a thin file.

One word on the cover:

**Ria.**
