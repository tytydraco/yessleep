Five years ago at the ripe age of 18 I moved out of my parent's home to be closer to the community College I was going to attend at the time. It was an hour away and it would be the first time that I'd get a taste of being an independent adult and living away from them. I was obviously nervous and stressed but I was looking forward to the freedom of having my own place. I'd be able to stay out late on the weekends, buy whatever I want, play my music as loud as I'd want to, and basically do all the things I couldn't get away with doing. So yeah I was ready to enter a new stage in my life. Sure I'd miss them but I'd obviously stay in touch and it wasn't like I was moving to the other side of the world.

So when I found an apartment that was just blocks from the college I was applying to I began to count down the days until my eventual move in date in the fall. It was the cheapest apartment complex I could find within a 50 mile radius and it was conveniently located near a busy shopping district so I could basically walk to do my grocery shopping. Overall it was ideal and I had read dozens of reviews that gave praise to the complex so I really wasn't worried that I would regret moving in. I even did a tour of the place and was impressed with the very modern look and the fact it had a gym and a decently sized park behind the complex itself that was open only to the Tenants which meant no homeless people sleeping on the benches. Best of all it was gated, you'd need a code to enter the premises. I also had a new job lined up that would pay me just above minimum wage. I'd have enough income to afford the rent.

My move in date was fast approaching and finally one day in August I was set to move in. I packed away all my stuff in suitcases and boxes. My older brother Dale came by with his moving van and we loaded everything inside. I said my goodbyes to my parents. I'd promise to call as soon as I arrived. I waved goodbye and climbed into the van and we drove off. I could hardly wait to finish unpacking and spend my first official night at my new crib. Dale was telling me of all the potential house parties we would throw and sneaking me into night clubs despite the fact I wasn't 21 yet. I really had no interest in parties and club hopping. None of that appealed to me but Dale was the opposite. He was a wild fratbro who would constantly throw parties as an excuse to get drunk and hookup with cute girls. Dale had gotten a DUI once and had his license revoked after one particular night of heavy partying and drinking. But since that incident that happened last year he's been trying to sober up but he still drinks every weekend so I guess he isn't ready to kick the habit yet.

We finally arrived at the complex. Dale helped me bring everything inside. It took us practically all day to unpack. Afterwards I was exhausted and went to sleep after he left. Here I was now on my own well at least I thought I would be. I guess I forgot to mention that I'd be moving back in to my parents house about six months from that day because my soon to be roommate would turn out to be an a junkie alcoholic who ran into some serious trouble with his dealer and would be the reason I would have to move out and call the cops. But for the first month things were easy-going. I was going to school and working and had a decent social life but all of that would change in the following months and I hate to say that my brother Dale is partly to blame. 

Now you're probably wondering why I ended up having a roommate. It wasn't so much that I wouldn't be able to cover the monthly rent. I was more than apt to I just started to get lonely after a few weeks and I was going mad having silence and not having anyone to help do the chores and cooking. I was accustomed to that with mom and dad but all of that fell on me now. I guess I was also lazy. All in all I did need the company. Dale knew a guy who needed a place and was struggling to find someplace in his budget so he told him he could crash at mine for as long as he needed to. What Dale failed to mention was this dude had been evicted from his previous apartment because on multiple occasions he failed to pay his rent and his ex had kicked him out due to his drug problems and heavy drinking.



His name was Alan and he was a 27 year old who was good friends with Dale. They had known eachother since high-school. I had never met him but Dale said he was really cool and laid back and mostly kept to himself. So I assumed he was chill. Boy was I wrong. I wish Dale had let me chosen my own roomate. He wasn't the best judge of character but I went along with things. 

One day Alan showed up unexpectedly. It was late and I heard knocking and I begrudgingly got out of bed to answer and there he stood. He was tall maybe 5"11 and had quite an impressive build. He wore a dirty white t shirt under an even dirtier brown leather jacket. His jeans were ripped and looked discolored and his tennis shoes were unlaced. It looked like he hadn't shaven in days. In fact it looked like he didn't prioritize his hygiene much because he smelled awful.  He grinned at me and shook my hand. I recoiled inside as we made contact and wanted to puke but I held in my discomfort. I knew he was going to be a major red flag but I let it slide. I didn't want to be judgmental and Dale was just trying to help. 

“Yo, chill place you got here dude. Looks better than my one bedroom. Man this place is definitely an upgrade.” He said looking around my apartment. He threw his backpack onto my couch and lept over right smack on the couch like he owned the damn place. I was feeling irritated. This guy had the nerve to show up at night waking me up and now here he was planting his ass on my clean couch covers. I was going to have to set some ground rules because there was no way I was gonna have a flithy roomate who didn't bother bathing himself once in a while.

“Well it's good to meet you Alan.” I said with a hint of sarcasm that I hoped he wouldn't pick up on. 

“Dale told me you needed a place so he offered mine. It's pretty nice. I don't have any complaints.” I really needed to go back to sleep and I wasn't interested in having a late night chat with this slob so I was just going to retreat back to my room and let him sleep out here. There wasn't a spare bedroom. I hadn't thought to get a two bedroom as they were way more expensive and I wasn't sure if I could rely on Alan to help with the rent but in hindsight I didn't know that he wasn't going to be any sort of help at all. 

Alan put up his feet on one of the pillows and stretched his arms behind his head. He was adjusting quite well to his new living arrangements. He seemed like the type to have a disregard for people's living spaces. That was something that just really got under my skin and made me curse under my breath.

“Appreciate it man. Your bro is a real one. Oh he's also gonna bring the rest of my stuff tomorrow. And look I won't give you too much trouble. I lived alone once too. It has its pros and cons but it's not so bad.” He looked at me with a pathetic grin as though waiting for a response. I just gave a slight nod and told him I was going to sleep. 

I turned to walk back hoping that I could get a good night's rest but I got the impression that Alan was a night owl which would be another red flag.

A few hours into me being asleep, I heard faint knocking. I raised my head a little and proped myself up by the arm and got out of bed. I walked over to the door and opened it to see Alan holding a bottle of Hennessy. I could make out a look of  unease in his eyes. He looked so nonchalant before but now I could tell he was nervous but I didn't want to rush to any conclusions. I barely knew the guy anyway and Dale wasn't very transparent about his friendship with Alan. 

“Listen man I gotta bounce. One of my buddies just hit me up. I gotta meet him in ten. I'll see ya later bro. Tell Dale he can leave my stuff here.” He said with a hushed but rushed voice. And with that Alan buzzed out of the apartment. I didn't care where he was going. He was a grown man after all and I wasn't going to set a curfew on someone pushing 30. But I couldn't help but feel a bit suspicious. I pushed my thoughts to the back of my head and went to sleep. If Alan gave me any problems I'd kick him to the curb and I really did want to throw his stuff out and tell him to find another place but I felt somewhat bad for the dude. I guess I was just gonna have to welcome my new roomate with open arms.

The next day I woke up to start my day. I had a few classes today but I wasn't in much of a hurry. It was already 9:30 am. I walked to the kitchen to make myself some breakfast. I didn't see Alan. Maybe he lost track of time or something last night. 

I went about my normal routine and tried not to think too much about Alan and his whereabouts. It wasn't my business. When I finished the last class of the day I headed back to do some studying. I unlocked the apartment and poked my head inside and to my shock I saw bottles all over the coffee table. Alan must have shown up and decided to leave a welcome gift. I called out his name but there was no response. He didn't bother to clean up his crap. There was no way I was going to let him trash the place so I went to grab a trash bag and tossed all the bottles inside. If he bothered to come around I'd give him a piece of my mind. 

After doing some tidying up I was getting hungry. I pulled the fridge open to look for any leftovers. As I was rummaging through the fridge I saw an empty gallon of milk all the way in the back. Strange. I had just bought two full gallons of milk last week. I had an idea of who the culprit was. Alan had more than his share of my milk and i did all the shopping. How does one dude go though a whole gallon of milk in one day? I had barely even drank a sip of it and it was full before he got here. I closed the fridge instead and passed on eating. Alan really had some fucking nerve.

It went on like this for a number of days. Alan would come in and out at all hours of the day unannounced. He'd constantly leave booze all over the place even in my bedroom and he'd eat most of my food. He also had a habit of leaving shaving cream on the mirror and used my deodorant and I only knew because I saw it open on the sink and had to throw it away. 

When Alan wasn't gone he'd either be on the couch sleeping making horrible snoring sounds or he'd be downing an entire bottle of Hennessy and hogging the television. On many occasions I'd have to sit him down and talk to him about having proper roomate etiquette and told him if he didn't clean up his act I'd send him on his merry way. But what really grinded my gears was that he never paid the rent. He made up excuses, like getting his paycheck late or his ex begging him for money. He always had a reason why he couldn't put down his share. I understood the first couple of times but I became increasingly upset at his lack of fulfilling any real responsibility. It was stressing me out and I was considering giving him the boot. To this day I'm kicking myself for having put up with him for so long. I was such a dumb kid back then.

Sadly things started to escalate, While I was in my room playing video games one day, Alan barged in. He slammed the door so loud the whole place shook and it startled me. He stumbled inside barely able to keep his balance. I helped to steady him but he almost fell over me. I dragged him onto the couch. Alan had bruises and scratches on his face. His lips and nose were bleeding and he had a black eye. He reeked of booze and weed. He tried saying something but I could barely make out what he was trying to communicate as he was slurring his speech. His expression really freaked me out. His eyes were drooping and the saliva was dripping from his mouth. I needed to know what the hell was going on but I didn't think I was going to get much out of him. 

“Woah buddy you look messed up. You get in a bar fight? I bet it was pretty rough. Shit. Maybe you should get cleaned up or something man. You look like hell.” I said both in a joking and concerned manner. Alan only mumbled. He tried to stand up but it was obvious he was in no condition to do so, so I forced him back and told him I'd get him some water. I poured some from the sink and went over to give him the cup but Alan was already up from the couch and texting on his phone. He looked up at me and I saw that he was getting anxious. He was sweating and ran his fingers through his greasy brown hair like he was in some sort of trouble. 

“Hey man you gotta loan me some money. I need it real bad. I owe a couple hundred. I'm in a bind right now. You gotta understand man. I could get messed up even worse.” He was panicking. It almost looked like he was about to cry. I tried to calm him down but Alan was becoming more and more agitated. I could sense that he was tensing up. I was even getting scared. He might have been a drunken zombie but he could blow a fuse at any second and I didn't want to be anywhere near him if it came to that. 

Alan started to curse loudly and he smashed a bottle on the wall. I yelled at him to knock it off but at this point he was in a reptilian state and just kept on smashing more and more bottles. I didn't know what to do. I'd be out of my mind if I tried to fight him. He was larger than me. Sure I worked out but my strength paled in comparison to his own. He'd probably twist me into a pretzel. Instead I just ran back into my room and locked myself inside hoping he'd tire himself out.

Eventually I heard the slamming of the door. Alan left. There was broken glass everywhere. I had to be careful not to step on any. He had gone completely insane and who knows what he'd do to me if he ever went off like that again. I immediately picked up everything. It took hours but I managed to make my apartment almost spotless except for the permanent stains of booze on the carpet. 

Soon after, I called Dale to explain what went down. He brushed me off and said Alan just needed to let some steam off and not to worry so much. He didn't understand the gravity of the situation with Alan and we went back and forth with eachother until I just hung up. I couldn't believe Dale could be friends with a jackass like that. I almost wondered if Alan got Dale to start drinking because it only started to happen by his junior year  of high-school. Dale was a straight a student but once he started hanging out with Alan and his crew his grades started slipping and he even got to his classes late. Alan was a bad influence from the beginning and its sad to see how he turned out. 

I didn't see Alan for the next few days. I was still shaken up about the incident. I thought of buying myself a handgun in case he posed himself as a threat. But more than anything I wanted to get him help as he was spiraling and he had a disease and that disease was alcoholism. 

Dale came by the apartment, we sat down to talk and during our conversation he brought up Alan.

“He uh….he's been  buying drugs from his dealer. I really didn't wanna tell you he was a junkie man. I figured maybe if I didn't say anything you'd give em’ a chance. He's been through a lot and he's trying to get better.” It took a while for me to say anything back. I was mad. that Dale kept very important details about Alan from me but arguing with him over it wasn't the solution. Dale may have not picked the best sort of friends but he genuinely did care. It was just unfortunate I had to see Alan's addiction first-hand and how it was wrecking his life. 

“Before he took off he had scratches and bruises on his face like he had been in a fight. And the guy was pretty nervous like, I don't know, he must be in some serious trouble probably with his dealer.” Dale only shrugged his shoulders. If anybody knew why Alan was behaving so jittery it had to be Dale. He was close enough with him that he could give me a straight answer but I don't know that Dale wanted to blab Alan's business to me just because we were related. I did have a right to know though. If Alan came back we'd both need to send him to a rehab facility. 

“I don't know. I haven't really talked to him much. He's been blowing me off a lot lately. Says he had to meet someone. Wouldnt tell me who. I didn't even know how he was getting  dope like that. I always though he only drank. Man that explains him veing real weird around me for that past year” Dale and I talked for another few hours until he left and told me he'd try getting a hold of Alan. I doubted we'd hear from him for days. I was beginning to think he went missing but if he had left of his own volition then we couldn't report him missing. There was a chance he might've tooken his own life and if so no one would've been there to stop him. 

Alan's ex showed up to my apartment a few weeks later. It was a Friday morning and I had heard a loud banging and shouting on the other side of the door. She was looking for Alan but she'd only find his roomate who wouldn't be able to give her any explanation of his sudden disappearance. She busted inside once I opened the door. She called out his name several times. She was going on about his lazy ass owing her money. I told her he wasn't here and that she'd have to come back some other time. 

“You tell that son of a bitch I want the rest by Monday. If I don't get it I'll take all his shit and sell it.” She said in a very matter of fact tone and spun around and walked out slamming the door hard behind her. Boy I wonder just how much he owed her and how he'd be able to help me pay the rent and pay her back. 

Alan finally came back the following Tuesday. I found him slumped on the coach but when he saw me he instantly perked up and then he shook me by the shoulders. I tried to push his hands off but he had a strong grip  Alan looked absolutely mad. He was on the verge of having a total mental breakdown. He looked even worse than the last time I had seen him. Like a he had gotten a beating with a bat or something. I finally managed to break free of his grip and when I did he started sobbing. 

“He's after me….h-he….he's gonna find me. If he finds me I swear to God he'll kill me…..I swear this time he'll do it” Alan said through sobs. “Woah, who's going after you? What the hell does he want? You've got to snap out of it Alan. You need help man. You're gonna get us both killed.” Alan was rocking back and forth and fidgeting his fingers like crazy. I sat down next to him trying to console him. I was no therapist but I had enough sympathy to at least show some support even though I was afraid and didn't want to get involved in what could be a very deadly conflict. 

“Is it your drug dealer Alan? Do you owe him?” Alan was a bit calmer now but he still struggled to compose himself. 

“Y-yeah…it's him….I told him I didn't have enough. I told him I needed more time. Guess he got tired of waiting. He came around with some buddies of his….they beat the shit out of me…..I couldn't fight em man. It was five of em’’

I put my arm around his shoulder. I didn't know what to say in the moment. I just knew that I wanted to be here for him. Even if we weren't friends I didn't have any genuine hate for Alan despite him being a lousy roommate with drug and alcohol problems.

He talked a while longer before I began to hear loud voices coming from just outside the apartment and we both went silent and starred at the door. I got up and rushed to peek out the window to see who was making all that commotion. I saw two large men wearing beanies and black leather jackets and wearing dark shades. They stood together like security guards. I slowly backed up from the window. Those were probably some of the guys that beat up Alan and somehow they found him here. 

“Hey Alan we've got company. It's gotta be those guys you were talking about. You think we can keep them from coming inside? How'd they even get through the gates?” I looked over at Alan. He pulled out a small pocket knife from his pocket and struck it out in front of him as though he was getting ready for a brutal knife fight. I'd never seen any sort of fight before and I definitely didn't want to be in the middle of a brawl. 

“One of em’ lives here. He's the one who told me I could move in with him before I met you. We used to hang around you know. Not super close but I didn't know he had ties with my dealer. Told me where I could get weed for cheap. I blew all my money on booze and weed. I've been broke ever since.” “Man this feels like some crazy ass setup.” I said. Alan inched himself closer to the door gripping the knife with both of his hands. He reminded me of a greaserr from a 50s flick the way he carefully made a side step motion with his legs. I could see the two men staring through the window. One of them pressed their face to the window pane and banged on it with his fist. I could hear him shouting though the shouts were muffled but they were definitely looking for Alan but they hadn't seen him yet. I figured maybe they'd go away but I heard more banging against the door and multiple shouts. 

“Look bro go get inside your room. Call the cops. I'll try holding em’ off. I'll make sure they don't get in.” I did as he told me and bolted to my room. I quickly dialed 911 and told the operator there were two men trying to break into my apartment. While I was on the phone I heard rapid gunfire. I got down near my bed. I heard continuous gun shots go off in the distance. After a moment, I slowly got up and made my way to the window to see three other men standing around at a corner across the street. They were all holding large rifles that were aimed at the unit where I was but the bullets had hit the gate and soon they began to walk across the street to the complex and relaoded their weapons and continued to fire even more shots at the units above mine.I ducked back down hoping they hadn't seen me. I could feel tears streaming down my face. How was Alan going to fight them all off. He'd be dead before the cops arrived and I'd probably be dead too. 

The two other men kept shouting and banging outside. They were trying to get Alan to come outside. I locked myself in my room. I hoped that maybe they would take it out onto the streets and they could all just get arrested by the cops. 

I wasn't sure how long Alan could hold them off. They were getting relentless and it sounded like they'd bust down the door with their combined strength like two giant bulls running head first into a wall. I felt too paralyzed to move but I crawled slowly to the door of my bedroom and pressed one ear against it. I could hear Alan screaming for them to go away. I didn't dare open the door for fear they had guns of their own. 

We were both trapped in my apartment and each second that went by I was tempted to call my parents and tell them I'd probably never see them again or Dale. I began to cry silently, my tears flowed down my cheeks and I waited to brace myself for the worst. I wiped away my tears and looked around my room to see if there was anything I could use that would be enough to inflict serious injury. Instead of standing up I continued to crawl away from the door to begin searching for anything I could use.

I tore through my drawers and closet tossing out everything that was inside until I came across a mallet. I quickly snatched it up and made a quick dash out my room. But when I stepped out I could saw Alan swing the door wide open and run right past the two men but not before they wrestled him to the wrong and started punching him. One of them grabbed him by his shirt collar and they both dragged him backwards. He was unconscious and bleeding profusely from his nose and mouth. 

Once they disappeared from my view I followed after them. My neighbors also began to come out to see what was going on. They all looked in my direction and started to surround me and ask me questions but I ignored them and brushed past.

 I heard multiple sirens coming from a couple blocks away. They surrounded the entire complex. Many of the tenants went back inside but I ran to the front of the complex and what I saw next has forever stuck with me. The men and Alan were outside on the sidewalk and they were kicking him and stabbing him. My heart practically sank to my stomach. They were going to kill him right there and then. I could see the blood from his body pouring out causing a huge puddle around him. It was a sickly sight that made me want to vomit. There was just no way they'd leave him alive and I couldn't do anything. They'd only beat me to death with the mallet I had. It would be up to the police now to stop them. And I could see the blue and red lights peeling down the road to get to my street along with ambulances rushing behind.

As soon as the cops where on my street they rushed out of their cars and shot off several rounds of gunfire. The bullets struck one of the men in the back and I saw him fall to his knees and then drop to the ground with a hard smack. The other men stopped as more bullets were fired and ran off in different directions but not before they were tackled to the ground and put into handcuffs and thrown into the back of a police van. A group of medics carried Alan's body and put him on a stretcher and drove him to the nearest hospital. 

A cop came up to me and began to ask me questions.

“Son, did you know that man?” 

“Yes, he was a friend. He said someone was going to kill him. He owed money. A lot of money.” 

The cop started jotting down some notes and asked me further questions. I tried my best to answer but I could feel my tears rushing down my cheeks. I just couldn't believe Alan was so hooked to the dope that it cost him his life and nearly mine. And this was the price he had to pay for falling into debt. But after today I didn't care about him owing me anything but even if he survived his wounds he wouldn't be staying with me anymore. Unless he changed his life around and this ordeal served as a wakeup call he could forget about ever having a stable living situation.

The rest of the day I lay in bed. I put my phone on do not disturb and just drifted off to sleep. As the hours became later and later I was met with disturbing nightmares all related to the men attacking Alan. They were all so vivid. I could see them pumping bullets into his body and repeatedly taking blows with their fists like they were hitting a piñata. All of it was awful and it turned into a recurring nightmare that lasted for several weeks causing me to have restless nights.

I developed depression and ptsd. I shut myself off from the world and barely left my apartment. I didn't bother with work or school and by that point I was going to move back in with my parents. They had no problem taking me back in but what really hurt the most was losing my newfound independence that had been short-lived. 

Dale apologized for having suggested Alan as a roommate but for all of his faults and obvious addiction neither of us could've predicted what went down and Dale was only doing his buddy a favor after all. 

Alan was in critical condition and had to be put on life support but was discharged from the hospital. He sustained multiple wounds in his stomach and arms but thankfully none of the stabs hit critical arteries but he had lost a lot of blood. As for the other men they all ratted out his dealer but were all sentenced to serve time in prison for attempted murder and drug possession. Alan did end up going to rehab. He really had no choice.

I ended up leaving the state entirely and eventually I bought my first home after I picked up a job working with people who suffer with substance abuse. I guess I wanted to make a difference in people's lives so at least I was able to make a career from someone who had an addiction. I had to learn to forgive Alan as well.

These days I'm doing much better. I still get nightmares now and then but I'm mostly back to normal. I don't know what's become of Alan but I hope he's sober now.
