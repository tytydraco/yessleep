I understand at first you may think im the problem in this post, but i promise you i had reasons for doing what i did. Im posting this because my boyfriend will NOT let me break up with him. 

I don’t know when it stopped being romantic and started becoming a nightmare.  

At first, Hunter was everything I thought I wanted—charming, thoughtful, just the right amount of clingy. We met online, clicked instantly. He made me feel special. Chosen. The kind of love that wraps itself around you like a warm blanket.  

But that blanket got tighter.  

At some point, I started trying to push him away. I don’t even remember why—it was just a feeling. I’d ignore texts, take longer to reply, start acting cold. He never reacted.  

I told him I needed space. He bought me noise-canceling headphones “for peace and quiet.”  
I told him I was seeing someone else. He smiled and said, *“I understand. People make mistakes.”*  
I screamed at him in public once. Told him I hated him.  

He just looked at me and said, *“That’s okay. I love you enough for both of us.”*  

So I broke up with him. Sat him down, made it crystal clear: *We’re done.*  

He tilted his head, like I was speaking another language. *“Silly. You don’t mean that.”*  

That’s when things got...wrong.  

A photo of us I’d never seen before appeared on my nightstand—one where I was smiling, but I swear to god I don’t remember ever taking it.  
My phone would buzz with texts from him finishing sentences I hadn’t even typed.  
One night, I woke up to find a little red box on my pillow. Inside was a necklace I’d been looking at online. I never told anyone.  

I changed my number. Moved apartments. Deleted all my social media. For a few weeks, I thought I was finally free.  Maybe it was an over reaction but Hunter had become like a stalker. 

Then I came home and found him sitting at my kitchen table.  

“I missed you,” he said.  

All the doors were locked. The windows too. But there he was, like he *belonged* there.  
I called the police.  

They found no signs of forced entry. They found no records of him. No ID. No social media. No birth certificate. It was like he never existed.  

But I know he does.  

Because he’s *still here.*  

He doesn’t eat. He doesn’t sleep. He just *watches me.*  
I’ve tried running. I’ve tried hurting myself, hoping he’d let me go if I broke badly enough. But he just says, *“Don’t worry, I’ll fix you.”*  

I’m writing this from a hotel room two states away. I haven’t seen him in three days. I thought maybe, *finally*, he was gone.  

Then this morning, I found a note slipped under my door. In his handwriting.  

 *"I love how you look when you sleep. See you soon, sweetheart."*  

There’s a knock at the door.  

I never told anyone where I am. Not even my family... 

I think this time, he’s going to take me somewhere I can’t leave.  
Somewhere I can’t scream.  
Somewhere he can love me forever.  

And ever.  

And ever.
