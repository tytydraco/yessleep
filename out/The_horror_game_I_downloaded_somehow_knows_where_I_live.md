I don’t really know what I’m looking for by posting this. Advice? Help? A way to convince myself that what’s happening isn’t real?

Or maybe I just want someone to tell me I’m not losing my mind.

It started about five nights ago. I was up late — couldn’t sleep, scrolling some old Discord server I hadn’t checked in years. A place where people used to share weird indie horror games and lost media. Most of it was garbage or joke stuff.

But one link stood out. A zip file named “final.exe” and nothing else. No description. No context. Just one message:  
**"Don’t share this."**

I know I should’ve deleted it. That message alone should’ve been a red flag. But I was curious. I download weird horror stuff all the time. It’s my thing.

When I ran the file, there was no menu, no logo. Just static. Then a black screen with a single line of text:  
**"You clicked it."**

Then it threw me into the game — or whatever it was. First-person view, grainy PS1-style graphics, a dimly lit hallway with doors on each side. The environment glitched and looped every few steps, like those old VHS maze games. At first, it was kinda cool — unsettling, sure, but nothing that hadn’t been done before.

Until the fourth loop.

That’s when the hallway changed.

It looked… familiar.

I stopped walking and just stared. My chest got tight. I started sweating. I didn’t know why at first — it just *felt wrong*.

Then I realized: the hallway in the game wasn’t just familiar.

It was my apartment.

Exactly my apartment.

Same layout. Same furniture. Same stupid scratch on the hallway wall that I keep meaning to paint over. Even the hoodie I’d left on the floor was there. In the game.

I thought maybe it was pulling my camera feed or something. I scrambled to check — but my webcam light wasn’t on. I yanked it out of the port just in case. Nothing changed. The game kept going.

I tried to quit. Escape. Alt+F4. Task Manager.

Nothing worked.

Then a mirror appeared at the end of the hallway. My reflection was in it — kind of. The face looked like mine, but it blinked out of sync. It smiled when I didn’t.

Then text appeared again:  
**"Don’t lie to them."**

The game froze. My screen went black. I forced my PC to shut down. My hands were shaking so badly I could barely hold the power button.

When I turned it on the next morning, the desktop was gone.

Just the game.

Still running.

That night, the lights in my apartment flickered — three slow blinks, one fast. Same as what happened in the game. Then my monitor turned on *by itself*. More text:  
**"Can I come in?"**

I didn’t answer. I didn’t even breathe.

A few seconds later, new text:  
**"I already did."**

I’ve been staying at a friend’s place since then. I’m too scared to go home. But the weirdest part?

It followed me.

The game still boots up on my laptop — a completely different device I’ve *never* used for this. It just appeared. No install. No files. Just... there.

And now my phone buzzes every night at 3:17 AM. No number. No name. Just a blank message. If I open it, I hear static. And sometimes — whispering. Fast and low, like someone’s right behind me.

I feel watched. Not in the paranoid, anxious way. In the *literal* way. Like something sees me — studies me.

Last night, the game showed my bedroom. In full detail. Even though I haven’t been there in days.

It showed *me*.  
Asleep.  
From above.

There’s no camera in the ceiling.

I’m running out of explanations. I’ve deleted everything. Wiped the drives. Reinstalled the OS. Nothing helps. The game always comes back.

I don’t know if this is malware, or a virus, or a cursed file, or something worse. But whatever it is…

I don’t think it wants me to play anymore.

I think it wants me to *lose*.
