My son…

I looked at him then, the Brittle Man—Charlie. His skin had dissolved badly enough that his mutated bones were visible through the thin layer of flesh. His chest heaved, each breath from that shriveled heart weaker than the last. 

I wanted to run to him. 

I tried to rise, tried to force myself into action but something ripped me backwards. Another memory. It grabbed hold of my mind, taking me back to that day: the worst of my life. 

The day I lost my boy. 

The Stranger. He’d met us at the edge of the wood, I remember. And he looked so tired. So… frightened. I’d confronted him then, condemning him for years of absence, for skirting his own responsibilities. “Show me,” I demanded. “Show me what Eden’s up against.”

And he did.

He sketched the story in charcoal, turned it to face Charlie and I, and all at once I understood the true scale of the Beast’s nightmare. It’s freedom wouldn’t result in the end of Eden. It’d bury the entirety of creation.

It made my knees go weak, my brow slick with sweat.But Charlie was resolute. He felt it too, the fear I did, but he didn’t show it. No, even after he’d just recovered from his illness, he wanted to go another—this time against the most terrifying virus in all the cosmos. 

The Stranger called to him. 

He took Charlie aside, and he drew something for him. It lit Charlie’s eyes up, brought a smile to his face like I’d never seen. He didn’t tell me what he’d seen. Not at first. It was only later, just before he was taken, that he said the drawing held all the love in the universe—that when he looked upon it, he experienced whole lifetimes of joy.

Me. His mother.

He said he got to experience growing old with us. Living a full life. He said the Stranger gave him that gift, and after all of that, he was finally ready to move on. To give back. I never got the chance to thank the Stranger for that small token. He’d already left, vanished into the trees like he always did, his last act of creation birthing a smile on a scared boy’s lips.

But inside, Charlie wasn’t a boy anymore. Not after living those lifetimes in his mind’s eye. It was clear in the way he spoke, in the way he carried himself. He was a man, and he wouldn’t let me talk him out of the sacrifice he chose to make, no matter what.

“Take me to the Brittle Man,” he told me. “Hang me from the vine.”

He made me promise to do the same to him as I’d done to the other children. All those terrible, awful things. He even brought the stuffed rabbit his mother had sewn, and when he handed it to me he told me not to cry.

“Even if I can only give the world another six months, it’ll all be worth it. Okay, Dad?”

So I did as he asked.

And I cried, and I drank, and I drank some more. And when it finally came time to negotiate with the Beast, to iron out the terms of the light’s surrender…

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

‘I asked it to purge my memories,’ I whispered, realization dawning on me as I surfaced from my memory. ‘The Beast. It was part of the terms. That I could live my final months without the guilt of what I’d done to my son.’

I staggered forward, falling to me knees beside Charlie disintegrating body. It was all coming back, returning like a tide of lucidity. It was my decision to forget myself, to bury all of my memories—because I couldn’t bear to face the horror of what I’d sacrificed.

Charlie gasped, wheezing. His button eye was blank. If he recognized his father, he made no indication of it. Instead he kept lurching toward the flickering flame of the Beast, still desperate to stop the monster even as he was turning to ash.

My lips touched his forehead, feeling the coarseness of that stuffed rabbit. My wife had sewn it. It was just weeks before she passed herself, stolen by the same sickness that had ravaged Charlie. 	A sickness that I gave them. 

My chest wracked, tears leaking from my eyes. The Beast’s corruption had followed me from the garden, stealing out into the wider world. Yes, my memories were clearing now. All my regrets. All my failures. They were laid bare before me, inescapable and haunting.

The Beast’s influence crippled Charlie, nearly killing him. It was his innocence, his purity that saved him. But when that same darkness sank into my wife, her soul couldn’t fight it off. It swallowed her up, made her wither into a skeletal corpse long before she ever stopped breathing. All because of me. I’d killed my wife—no, I’d murdered her. Just like I’d murdered my brother. Just as I’d murdered my son. 

My arms squeezed tight around Charlie, his breathing growing more ragged by the second. His black heart throbbed weakly. Ash flew around me like tear-stained snow.

“I’m sorry,” I whispered to him, though I wasn’t sure he could hear me. “You didn’t deserve this. You deserved so much more than me.”

It didn’t matter if he couldn’t understand. All that mattered was he knew he wasn’t alone, that somebody, even a stranger was willing to hold him at the end, to love him while all of creation crumbled around them.

“I’m proud of you,” I croaked, swiping at the wetness on my cheeks. “You’re better than me. Stronger. Always have been. I’d have gladly traded every lousy atom in this cosmos for another week of your smile, if only you’d have let me…”

My palm touched his cheek, rough with stitched fabric. His head tilted, the button eye focused on me. Charlie let out a laboured groan. His ribs gasped like a maw, desperate for air, hungry to breathe. He lifted an arm—flaring those serrated nails as if making to slash them across my throat, and I even prayed he might—that for once in his life, my son might take something for himself, even if it was revenge against his old man.

But instead his finger drifted across my cheek. Gentle. Harmless.

And I caught his hand as it collapsed, and I held it against my face. A sob wracked my chest. Charlie’s breathing slowed to a crawl, and I could barely see him through the haze of tears. But I could feel him. And I could hear him. The way his breathing was beginning to slow, growing quieter, weaker.

“What about him?” I asked, glaring at the children over my shoulder. “Does Charlie get to go home like you do? Will he get to enjoy the light for a little while longer, too?”

Neither child answered.

They didn’t have to, though. The truth was plain in their downturned eyes. It was something I knew deep down, in some part of myself I’d buried to hide from the shame—my son’s soul didn’t belong ot him anymore, not completely. It was Eden’s now. It was the Crooked Wood’s. 

**RAAAGGGHHHH**!A titanic roar exploded from above. The lighthouse shook like a hurricane. The Beast’s candle flared, swallowing more of the lamplight, and the structure teetered violently as books tumbled from their shelves. “We’ve gotta hurry,” said the boy. “It’s past midnight. The Beast must be getting impatient.”

But my eyes fell on Charlie. My son. His lower half had nearly disintegrated. All that was left of his legs were two skeletal nubs. “He’s dying,” the girl said, gripping my arm. “I’m sorry. Believe me, I am. But we have to finish this before the Beast realizes the Brittle Man is gone. Once he goes, so does our leverage. Charlie’s spirit was the last thing holding back the Beast, and without it, that monster can break itself out whenever it pleases.”

My lips trembled as I tried to do the impossible: let Charlie go. It wasn’t fair. He was still alive, still hanging on because my boy was a fighter. Yet the children were asking me to abandon him, to leave his soul here with the Beast—all so humanity could enjoy another couple decades of light. 

“I’m sorry,” I said, a river pouring from my eyes. “I’m so sorry, Charlie.”

The lighthouse shrieked, the structure beginning to fracture as giant cracks rippled along the walls. It wouldn’t stay standing much longer. Once it fell, the Beast would be free, and if we weren’t the ones to let it out then Charlie’s sacrifice would be for nothing.

“Do it!” shouted the boy. “Now! Before the Beast realizes the Brittle Man’s dead!”

But he wasn’t dead. Not yet.

He was just dying. But I rose to my feet, letting Charlie’s hand fall to the floor in a cloud of ash. His button eye gazed up at me. It broke my heart to know that for the second time in his life, he was being forced to watch his father sacrifice him.

Hating myself, I unslung my rifle. Lining up the sights, I wasn’t sure who deserved the bullet more—the Beast, or myself. But it was what Charlie wanted.

That’s what I told myself as I squeezed the trigger, that my boy wanted to help people, to save them, even if it cost him everything. And so a crack of thunder rang out. The bullet flew.

The Beast’s glass prison shattered into a million pieces, and so did my heart. 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Shards rained down around us. The flame pulsed. It rippled outward with a shockwave that extinguished every lantern upon the wall, that stole the breath from my lungs and filled my veins with the ghost of winter itself. 

A guttural groan filled the room, low and [aching.It](http://aching.It) made my soul shrivel up, reminding me of a funeral for an infant, or a hospital lit ablaze. It reminded me of the most terrible things I could ever image, and then in the space of that thought my whole world turned upside down. 

Darkness burst from the flame, hungry and vicious. It swallowed up the study, then the lighthouse, then the Crooked Wood. It tore through my flesh like a scalpel of grief, cutting away all the beautiful things I’d ever felt, and leaving only emptiness in their place. 

And then it spoke. 

I couldn’t see it, but I could feel it—the way the words tore Charlie to pieces, the way they burned Eden to ashes and less. I could feel those words echoing all across the universe. I heard them devour stars, turn whole planets to dust. I listened as they unmade life, galaxy by galaxy, with all the perverse indifference of a landlord evicting tenants past due on rent. 

They were simple. Cruel. 

In the end, the Beast declared, ‘Let there be night.’

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The horn blared like an air-raid siren, and I came to with my face pressed against the steering wheel of my truck. The hood was crumpled against a tree, a dark tendril of smoke slithering toward the sunset sky. I groaned, sitting upright, feeling the tender spot on my head. Blood speckled my fingertips. A crash, then. I’d crashed into a tree on the edge of the woods, knocked myself unconscious. A dream, then. 

The Brittle Man. The Stranger. The Beast and the Crooked Wood. None of it was real. It was all part of some fever dream, stitched together by my concussed brain. Like a more awful Alice in Wonderland.

Despite being dizzy with delirium, I couldn’t help but smile, even laugh. It felt too good to be true. I cracked the door with a rusty screech and my boots thumped down on dead grass. Before me loomed a familiar sight—the old wood that sat on the edge of the family property.

Only there wasn’t any sign of a lighthouse, or hanging children, or—*Sktch. Sktch.*

My eyes narrowed, my vision blurry from the accident. That sound. It was soft, almost like scratching, or charcoal sweeping across a page.

My chest tightened. No. 

Please no.But there he was—like a monster ripped from my worst nightmare. He sat on the stump of a tree not twenty feet away, cast in the violent glow of the sunset. A man without a shadow. He wore a tattered suit, a tophat that covered his eyes, and from his mouth spilled a tangle of thorns. He was drawing something on a sketchpad.

I tried to form words, but all that came out was an animal snarl. My feet moved before I could stop them. Stalking forward. Stumbling. To think this asshole had the nerve to show up now—after everything he’d caused, everything he’d ruined. 

When I reached him, my knuckles cracked. I stared down at with him through a twitching eye, my whole body primed for violence, but the Stranger didn’t acknowledge me. Just kept on with his artwork. Not a care in the world. Fuming, I snatched the pad from him, hurling it into the trees.

“Enough!” I bellowed. “Enough with your fucking doodles!”

He didn’t react. “Do you even realize what you did? That this—all of this—is your fault? If you hadn’t run off and left it all to me and the kids and the Brittle Men, then we might’ve been able to keep the Beast under control. We might’ve been able to salvage this miserable creation!”The Stranger shifted, and I tensed, expecting him to lash out, to turn me into a pillar of salt or smite me with the wrath of heaven, but instead he reached for the brim of his tophat. He paused, hesitant. Then lifted it. 

I recoiled, wincing. 

I knew well what lied beyond that brim—eyes that burned brighter than supernovas, that shone with enough force to burn all of creation to ash. E

But those were not the eyes that looked back at me.

They’d changed. Once, they’d painted an infinite canvas of darkness with all the colors of life. They’d etched their vision into every atom of the cosmos. Now, they'd become little more than flickering candles, guttering in the skull of an old man. 

‘You promised us heaven,’ I croaked, my voice breaking with grief. ‘You sold us all a fantasy of salvation, and now you just—what—give on up it? Throw in the towel?’

My fists wrapped around his collar, and I wrenched against what felt like the weight of the world. ‘The Beast is free,” I spat. ‘But look at me. I’m alive, aren’t I? I’m breathing. Do you know why? It’s because even the Beast could keep a promise. So if that monster can do it, then why the hell can’t you?”The Stranger coughed. 

He keeled over, hacking like a patient in need of a lung transplant. His face twisted, full of agony, full of pain. And I saw it then, those thorns that filled his mouth, he was pulling them free—ripping out long vines of them, speckling his pale suit with beads of red. 

“You’re right…”

His voice. How long had it been since I heard his voice? 

Only it was no different than his eyes—hardly a shadow of the thing I remembered. Once, that voice had echoed across infinity, its every syllable forging stars and birthing souls from the fabric of emptiness itself. 

Now it was rasping, faint and cold. So quiet it threatened to vanish against the autumn breeze. He coughed again. More blood. “All along, I should have told you… You deserved the truth, Cain…”He took a shuddering breath. “So let me tell you now… what I should have then…”

And he did. He spoke of the Beast, of its origins, of how it was his shadow he had locked away. It turned out the Beast and the Stranger were one and the same, two halves of one all-powerful whole, with neither able to fully integrate the other. 

The Beast represented all those parts of the Stranger he’d tried to bury: the rage, the sadness, the hatred and shame. It was there when he drowned the world. It was there when he answered humanity’s pain with violence. So he buried it.

He told himself if he only suffocated it long enough, it’d die off. But instead, it hardened. It grew desperate, hungry and volatile, and before long the darkness began to eat the Stranger from the inside out. It stole his voice, caging his tongue with thorns. It dimmed his vision, extinguishing the fire in his eyes.

And now it had broken free, and taken everything else—all that the Stranger cherished, all that brought him serenity.

“So what?” I told him when he was finished. “You want pity? You want a shoulder to cry on? Deal with it yourself. We’ve all got shit in our lives. I murdered my brother. You know that, and you know how badly that guilt ate me up inside. He died because I couldn’t handle my own darkness. And now my wife is dead—my fucking son is dead—because you couldn’t handle yours.”

I paced, fury building like a kettle set to boil over. “You knew the pain I carried, the guilt I could never get past, and yet you abandoned me. You left me with your shadow. Your Beast. You left me to pull the trigger on the entire UNIVERSE like it was MY responsibility!”

My fists tightened around his collar, eyes bloodshot with rage. More than anything, I wanted to hit him. I wanted to make him hurt for what he did, for the hurt that his actions had caused me. 

But I couldn’t do it. Maybe all the fight had gone out of me. Or maybe I hated how on some level, I could relate to the Stranger. He buried a darkness he couldn't bear to face, and so did I. Only mine wasn’t locked away in some lighthouse, but in a field of empty beer cans strewn across a dusty floor. 

And that thought broke me. 

My knees gave out, and crumpled before him, sobbing. I don’t know how long I cried. Hours. Days. It’s hard to say when your heart is spilled open like that. What I do know is he sat there through all of it. He never moved. He let every one of my tears crash against him, and it was only once I’d finished that he pointed over my shoulder at the trees. “For… you…” 

His voice was frail.

“I’m… sorry…Cain…”I turned, sniffling, and saw the sketchpad I’d snatched from his hands. Its pages rippled in the breeze, bleeding in the light of the setting sun. “I don’t want your stupid doodle book,” I said. “I want my son. I want my wife.”

But when I looked back, the Stranger was gone. He’d left without a word. Without so much as a wave. For a second, I almost left it there, rising to march back to my truck, but something called to me. So I turned. 

I picked up the sketchpad and gazed at his last drawing—it was familiar. I’d seen it before, only briefly, when he’d emerged from the woods with Charlie so long ago. A smile broke on my face. And I laughed, wiping tears from my cheeks as I wandered back to the log, sitting down and beaming.

It was a drawing of us. Charlie. His mother. Me.

It was a whole lifetime captured in a single image, fifty years of joy and love and hope and all the ingredients a human could ever desire. And as I stared at that charcoal sketch, I got to live every single moment of it, over and over. 

I held it to my chest, and I looked up to find a star-soaked sky.

“Thank you,” I whispered. “For doing your best.”

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

That was twenty years ago. Things have changed since then. The Beast has been rampaging across the cosmos for two decades now, and you can feel it. All of you can. 

Sure, the world hasn’t ended. Not yet. It’s just unwell.

Angrier. Louder.

People are scared and they’re getting worse by the day. Fear has become a virus, omnipresent and contagious, eating at our hearts and souls, leaving them emptier with each passing moment. 

You see it in the faces of people. In the way we’re always arguing, always at each other's throats. You see it in the stars. The way they feel further away, night after night, each of them slowly fading to black. 

Life doesn’t feel like it used to. Reality has changed. If it feels hopeless these days, it’s because it is, but that doesn’t mean you need to be afraid. Things are only returning to the way they were. The way they always should have been. 

See, we’ve always told stories, human beings. It’s how we make sense of our existence, through narrative, through structure. 

Our favorites tend to be the ones about heroes—about good triumphing over evil, as if it’s the natural order of things, as if we never need to worry about our position in the cosmos because light will always prevail. But the stories forget that the darkness came first. 

It’s the light that’s trespassing.
