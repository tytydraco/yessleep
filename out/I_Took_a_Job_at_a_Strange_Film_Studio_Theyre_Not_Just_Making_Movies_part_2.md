[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1lh4tzr/i_took_a_job_at_a_strange_film_studio_theyre_not/)

On the fourth day, we were all called into yet another assembly. They called it a *creative alignment circle*.

No one warned me.

The entire staff was herded into a wide, soundless studio space — one of the older ones with ceilings that stretched into shadow and walls that looked vaguely burned. There was a faint, metallic smell in the air. Not blood. Not quite. But something adjacent.

The lights overhead buzzed in rhythmic pulses, like a heartbeat gone wrong.

We sat cross-legged in a ring of mismatched chairs. No cameras. No phones. Just silence and expectation.

At the center stood one of the executives — the same man with the too-smooth face, like his expression had been carved into place and then polished until no emotion could stick.

He spoke slowly, in a tone so even it felt inhuman.

“Art lives in vulnerability,” he said. “True art is not safe. It is not gentle. It is not filtered through ego or fear or comfort. If you have come here to create safety, you’ve come to the wrong place.”

Then he smiled. Not warmly.

He pointed to a young man across from me — one of the camera techs. Barely more than a kid.

“Stand.”

The tech stood, trembling slightly.

“Who do you think is *failing the art*?” The boy looked confused. Then terrified. He tried to stammer something out, but the executive cut him off.

“Point to them.”

The room tensed.

Slowly, the boy lifted his hand and gestured toward a woman sitting beside me — a production designer I’d shared lunch with once.

“She… she didn’t want to redesign the set for the grief scene,” he mumbled. “Said it was exploitative. That it felt wrong.”

The woman’s jaw clenched. Her eyes glinted — not with shame, but fury. She stood without being asked and snapped back, voice cold:

“And *you* filmed it without flinching. Like it turned you on.”

The circle gasped. Some laughed. The executive clapped once. Loud.

“Good. More.”

And like that, the room turned.

They called it *feedback*. But it was flaying. Every word was sharpened. Each “critique” cut with surgical cruelty. I watched soft-spoken costume designers eviscerate interns for cowardice. Editors accused actors of vanity. Someone called a director’s trauma scene “emotionally flaccid.”

And when it was my turn, I was ready to lie — to say something surface-level, political.

But I felt eyes on me. Not just theirs. Something *else*. Watching through them.

I pointed to a middle-aged man with a quiet, scholarly demeanor.

“He hesitates before every take,” I said. “Like he’s scared of what might happen if the scene gets too real.”

He flinched. But nodded. A tear slid down his cheek.

The circle moved on.

And I hated how *good* it felt. How pure. Like a poison finally leaving the blood.

But as the exercise ended, I noticed something: no one had left the circle unscathed. Even those who delivered the harshest critiques had been wounded. There was no triumph. Only thinning skin. I myself had been torn to shreds, but it only left a feeling in me that I could do better. Like some unseen force had taken over, driving me onwards towards perfection.

And when the executive dismissed us, his final words rang out like a benediction and a curse:

“Remember — creation and destruction are the same hand.”

Later, after the studio went dark, I wandered.

I told myself I needed to clear my head. But something else pulled me — that strange, subtle magnetism I'd been feeling all week, a gravity not of earth, but of *meaning*. As though the studio had its own soul, and it was drawing me to the parts it didn’t want seen.

I don’t know what drew me to the door. I’d passed this hallway before, but I’d never noticed it. No signage. No keypad. Just a warped wooden panel with a brass knob, half-turned, like it had been left ajar on accident… or for someone.

I paused, the whisper of something cold sliding down my back.

Still, I opened it.

The hinges groaned like something waking up.

Inside, it was colder than it should’ve been—dry, still, wrong. The air smelled of rust, mildew, and decayed paper. A single bulb swung faintly from the ceiling, casting a jaundiced flicker.

At first, it looked like a prop room—cluttered shelves, unlabeled boxes, scattered debris. But nothing felt fake. No paint, no foam, no signs these items were ever meant for a set.

A child’s red shoe sat on a shelf, caked in dried mud. Beside it, a teddy bear with a torn ear slumped forward, like it had been crying. A cracked pair of glasses lay atop a dust-covered book.

I stepped in. The floor groaned.

More objects appeared in the light—a broken necklace tangled with hair, a coat draped over a chair like someone had just stepped out, a shattered phone still pulsing with a missed call. No labels. No order. Just loss.

At the back, a corkboard stretched across the wall, pinned with dozens of photos. Faces—not actors. Men, women, children. Some smiling. Some crying. Some afraid. Most unmarked.

A few had notes beneath them:  
“Gave everything. A spectacle.”  
“Pushed further than expected.”  
“Did not finish the scene.”

It hit me.

This wasn’t storage.

This was a reliquary. A graveyard.

These weren’t props—they were remnants. Belongings salvaged not for use, but because they’d been offered. Sacrificed.

In the corner, a dusty CRT television crackled to life. Static. Then a loop: a young man, fully clothed in a bathtub, rocking back and forth.

I turned up the sound.

"Cut when I’ve given it all. Cut when I’m empty."

Over and over.

I backed away, breath shallow.

This was where they kept what was left behind. Discarded lives. Trimmed truth. Memory shaved off like celluloid scraps.

And still—I stayed.

Because part of me knew: the script had already been written.

And I was following it. Beat for beat.

On the fifth day, they asked me to act.

"Something small. Just you this time," said one of the producers that morning. Her lipstick too red. Her teeth too white. Her voice too calm, like she'd practiced sounding human in front of a mirror.

"A piece about silence," she said. "A man confronting the absence of sound in the face of unspeakable terror."

It sounded like nonsense. But so had everything else. So I nodded. Because nodding was easier than asking questions.

They called it Scene 47: *The Vow.*

No script. Just a costume that wasn’t a costume. A hoodie I hadn’t worn since high school. My old sneakers—same scuffs, same broken lace. These weren’t replicas. They were *mine.*

The set was a clearing in the woods—a near-perfect replica of the spot Jeremy and I used to escape to when home became too loud. We called it “base camp.” The smell was exact: pine, wet leaves, distant woodsmoke. The kind of sensory accuracy no budget could buy.

The trees, though, were wrong. Too orderly. Too still. But the dying light? That orange, late-autumn sun slanting through the branches? That was real. Or it felt real enough.

No one else was there. Just me, a replica of my old BMX, and the circle of mossy stones we once called the council.

Then a voice from somewhere unseen crackled through:

"Just be in the moment. Let it come back. Say what you said that day. Remember what he told you."

And I did.

Fifteen. Jeremy about to leave for college. One last ride to the woods. No dares, no jokes—just quiet. A shifting silence that smelled like endings.

I’d asked him, voice trembling, “You’ll still come back, right?”

And he’d laughed, pointed to the clearing:

“I’ll always be here, idiot. Right here. You come back, and I’ll find you.”

It was one of the last happy moments we shared. Pure. Untouched.

But what stepped from the trees wasn’t Jeremy.

It *looked* like him—same gait, same cocky half-smile—but off. His eyes were too still. His smile stayed too long, like it was pinned in place. He didn’t blink.

He sat beside me. Like Jeremy had. Like the memory wanted him to.

**ACTOR (as Jeremy)** *You know you can’t stay here forever.*

**ME (hesitating)** *What?*

**ACTOR** *You keep coming back to this place. Hoping to find something that’s already rotted.*

My pulse spiked. That wasn’t the line. That wasn’t even close.

But I didn’t stop. Because I *couldn’t.*

The trees leaned in. The shadows around the clearing deepened, teeth hidden in the bark. The air itself buzzed, electric and wrong.

**ME** *You said you’d always be here.*

**ACTOR** *And I am.*

(He grinned. Something cracked behind his teeth.)

*You just didn’t know what it would cost.*

He reached out.

His hand was cold.

Not memory-cold. Not death-cold. But something *other.* Ancient and hungry and pretending to be familiar.

Tears slid down my face. Not on cue. Not for performance. Just… real.

The hidden voice returned, whispering through the branches:

"Good… that’s it. Let it hurt. Let it bleed."

And I did.

Because some part of me *needed* to see it through. To know how far it could go.

The cameras spun, unseen.

The trees trembled with a low, droning hum—like the clearing had lungs. Like the set itself was watching.

Birdsong warped into human noise. Language stripped of meaning. Feelings laid bare:

**Give it all.** **Bleed it for the frame.** **This is the altar. You are the offering.**

And I understood.

It was never about *performance.*

It was about *sacrifice.*

Later that day, one of the executives pulled me aside.

He wore the usual mask they all did—face too smooth, smile too exact. Like it had been rehearsed, or printed. His eyes, though, shimmered like oil on water. Empty, but hiding something immense beneath the surface.

“You’re ready,” he said.

“Ready for what?”

He didn’t answer. Just led me through a hallway I’d never seen, though I’d walked this building a hundred times. The walls seemed to bend subtly the further we went, as if the architecture itself was trying to correct for a truth too heavy to hold.

He stopped at a false wall behind the green room. Placed his palm against it.

A door revealed itself with a hiss of warm air.

He turned to me and said, softly, “You’ve given enough to earn a glimpse.”

Then he stepped aside.

I went alone.

The stairwell wound down in a tight spiral, each step slick with condensation. The lightbulbs overhead twitched violently, buzzing with panic, not decay.

At the bottom: a black door.

Unmarked.

Unlocked.

As I stepped through, the air grew thick and metallic. Sweet, almost—like burnt sugar rotting on a stove.

And then I saw it.

The shrine.

But that word—*shrine*—felt blasphemously inadequate.

The room was cavernous, impossible in size. Velvet curtains hung like flayed skin, their fibers heavy with old blood. The smell was a sick symphony—wax, mold, sweat, decay. Pain made manifest.

Display cases lined the walls—each housing something that once belonged to someone who no longer *could.* A rusted tiara spattered with blood. A ballet slipper, split and soaked. A child's teddy bear with eyes replaced by camera lenses. Clapperboards bearing dates I recognized from headlines, not call sheets.

Jars sat on pedestals. Teeth, nails, torn bits of script. One held an eyeball still tethered to an optic nerve, coiled like an old film roll.

There were sketches scattered like offerings. Storyboards of torment. Diagrams for devices that blurred the line between surgery and performance art. Scribbled notes on pain thresholds. Ink-streaked questions scrawled into every margin:

**Is fear stronger than grief?**  
**How many takes before the soul fractures?**  
**Do screams read better in mono or stereo?**

And at the center—

A towering idol.

**Obscura.**

Ten feet tall, hunched as if crushed beneath centuries of confession. Its body was an amalgam of bone, copper, and celluloid. Film strips coiled like intestines through its ribs. Its face was a swirling mass of silent screams—mouths frozen mid-howl, eyes made of cracked lenses. Its arms spread open in welcome or warning.

In one hand: a scalpel.

In the other: a paintbrush.

Around its waist, a belt of audio cables and human hair.

At its feet—an altar.

Fresh blood glistened there. Ashes piled like unedited reels.

A plaque read:

**OBSCURA**  
Patron of the Final Cut.  
Saint of the Endless Take.  
God of Shock.  
He Who Hungers for the Gasp Before the Cut.  
He Who Feeds on the Blurring of Fiction and Flesh.

Behind me, the door groaned shut. The lock clicked like a throat closing.

And then the voices came. Not through the air—through *me.*

**This is where the raw becomes sacred.**  
**This is where the audience ends.**  
**This is where the story bleeds.**

My knees buckled.

Because I understood, finally, what the studio was.

Not a place for *making* movies.

But a place for *offering* them.

And we—the dreamers, the artists, the desperate—

We were the lambs.
