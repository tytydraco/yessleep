Legends are built upon truth and are told by those who wish to keep the mystique alive, or to warn would-be adventurers of the risk of chasing a story that may or may not be true. My name is Alex Moore and I’m no adventurer, I’m a journalist in study and avid listener of a variety of manic ramblings or tear-filled lies. For as long as I remember, I’ve been interested in scary stories, but over time became desensitized to them, like an addiction, a hunger to feel the rush of adrenaline that fades before I can enjoy it, yet the curiosity still lingers weakly as I lie awake before dawn.

# Part 1

I’ve never been one to chase ramblings, even if there was a shred of truth behind it. Lurking websites from many countries, from paranormal to cryptid and everything in between. I kept telling myself that where I lived, there was no such luxury of scary stories worth telling overseas until one day, my grandfather told my mother a story that happened near him. It was a couple of years before he passed away and I was around three and I didn’t retain anything from that conversation until twenty years later when my mother told me about it while working on a creative writing project for college. I couldn’t help but scoff at the story in disbelief, but when she said that it was in the news, I became less skeptical.

For context, my grandfather was a private investigator and avid jogger in the foothills of the Drakensberg mountains, it was a quiet time, everyone would greet him as he jogged past and his work was flawless when studying a case, until a file crossed his desk. A case of a hitchhiker hijacking that ended in two people being mangled and their families viciously demanding answers; answers they would never have. This case took my grandfather across the province, looking for maybe a shred of evidence that would clarify the claims, he was almost out of time before an employee at a nearby fuel stop gave him the story.

My mother gave me his notebook from all those years ago, he was meticulous, every single note, question and answer was clearly written out and archived. His memory was his biggest ally in this situation, but as his years ran out, he told my mother that he wished he could have forgotten that one event. After he got his information, he called the station and they launched a formal investigation over the area. The chief ordered a couple of patrols to scour the roads and keep an eye out for “A Lady in White”.

I thought it was ominous, but not exceptional compared to say: The Goatman or a Werewolf. Still, I read through his notes while my mother told me his tale and his personal experience with this mysterious Lady in white.

“They sent out three teams and they patrolled the route for the next day or two, nothing came up.” My mother said as she directed me to the first note on the first day of investigation. They went back to the man who told them the story, as my grandfather described him: Old and frail, his hands most if the time in his pockets, his arms withered and skinny with a myriad of veins covering his wrinkled limbs and a strong Afrikaans accent to go with the large farm hat and white beard. My grandfather noted that there was something otherworldly about him, he couldn’t focus on his eyes let alone look at them at all.

“What did they find?” I asked, the subject poking my curiosity ever so slightly more as time passed.

“Nothing, not a single patrol reported anything out of the ordinary.” My mother replied, she continued to tell me that my grandfather sat in his hotel room, pouring over the evidence, bystander accounts. By the time he managed to find a solution, the sun had begun to rise and he opted to get some sleep. It was only during the night that he had to work on this case, as the evidence pointed out, near midnight he would find his answer.

‘After a few hours of dreamless sleep.’ He noted;’ I managed to find a way to get what we need. All of the patrols went out in teams of two or three. What if I went out alone. I’ll contact the chief and see if he’ll indulge me.’ My grandfather wrote down. I grew more curious as to why this would change anything, but I was curious nonetheless.

The notes continued as he was given permission to take an unmarked car and money for petrol and any supplies he would need, he lamented it would be a long night of driving on a cold, dark, almost endless stretch of road that snaked and weaved through the foothills and forests, almost as if the road dared not tread in the shadow of the mountain as it loomed in the background.

‘Start time; 8:15. I just got to my car and pulled into the rest stop to fill up on fuel and grab dinner. If my route is correct, this will take me down the road where most reports have been from and a good number of rest stops along the way, just in case I need to stop and refill on supplies. I’ll travel light and progress from there.’ My grandfather would take notes every fifteen minutes, though not much would happen in that time.

Just when he thought nothing was happening on the investigation, a car flew by in a blur, catching my grandfather off guard as his writing stopped abruptly and only picked up in a shaky and unsteady script much later. It was a space of twelve minutes before he updated his notes.

“Speeding car, had to give chase. Something was pulling me toward it. At first, I wondered why someone would be speeding along this tight road at this time, but I gave chase anyway.” I stopped and silently chuckled.

‘Nowadays, people would do that anyway. They build cars to do that, Grandpa.’ I thought. My mother looked at me curiously and I just waved it off, ‘thought of something funny’ I said.

“I lost sight of them for a while until I heard the unmistakable screech of tires and the sudden silence save for my motor’s engine running. I could tell I was near, maybe a minute or two.” I kept in mind that he was writing this either from the side of the road or, preferably, from the safety and warmth of a hotel room.

The next notes would give me the answer I carelessly chased.

“I approached the car, in the barrier. He must’ve locked up his brakes as the skid marks would go on for a while before the car hit the barrier and hung perilously over a steep edge. I reported the incident and called for a recovery vehicle.” He wrote, his hand becoming shaky and frantic by the untidy scribbles and scratches that he left on the page.

“I found something though, and may God protect my soul so I may never see this again. The car door nearest to the road was open and a trail shining in the bright moon light traveled down the road, a good thirty meters before I saw it; a woman with stained brown hair walking along the side of the road close to the active lane. Breath escaped my lungs into a heat mist in front of me, it was close to zero degrees in the dead of winter, yet this woman was wearing a white dress with no shoes and no jacket. Her left arm looked like it was just barely hanging on to her body, horribly mangled and bleeding. Instinct took me, I wanted to help her. As I approached her, I could hear her weeping, though no mist came from her lips as it spewed from mine. I put a hand on her shoulder, she was freezing cold but not shivering, she stopped and all was silent, her body began to jerk and shudder. I couldn’t fathom why, but she began to laugh. Her head turned toward me and that’s when I felt numb; her eyes were pure white, her skin appeared as a pale shade of blue and there were dark rings around her eyes, the corner of her mouth contorted into a twisted smile as half her jaw hung loosely from her face, her face was stained dark with red as her dress had dark streams trailing down her chest and stomach. My grandfather noted that the air around her was colder, he stood completely paralyzed as she vanished slowly into the darkness. He noted that he blacked out, waking up in his car, after stopping on the side of the road, his body collapsed in exhaustion for a short while, long enough for another patrol to drive up behind him and check on the situation.

“I told them all I could.” He wrote.

“The accident had just happened; their car had been totaled and the driver in serious condition. Mine wouldn’t start, must’ve run the engine too long or something, so I joined the patrol in their vehicle and radioed for a recovery vehicle.” He continued, under that note was a bunch of details about the scene, the driver had been immobile for a while and the injuries to his body were severe.

The last note struck me as odd.

“I walked to where I saw that woman in my vision, no trail, no sign of her anywhere. I must ask the rest stops along the route tomorrow if they saw anything, but for now I should get some rest.” That was the last note from the night. I became skeptical if this was just a late-night joy ride gone wrong, or if my grandfather was just hallucinating from lack of proper sleep. I would know later as his next note picks up nearly half a day later.

“Mechanics looked at my car, nothing wrong, maybe it was just overheating. Strange for a new car, maybe. No matter, it still works for now. I asked around, there were four rest stops between where I started my patrol, and only one from where the chase started and ended. I went in reverse from the fifth stop to the first, asking the same question; the first two didn’t give me any proper answer, the third stop along my patrol route said that he stopped a short way after leaving, he seemed to talk to nothing but thin air, the fourth said that the man had asked for a full tank of fuel and looked quite distressed, his eyes were darting all over the place.”

My grandfather continued with the fourth note: “The fourth stop said that the man had stopped shortly after I had left, he looked hurried and said that he can’t keep the person he’s traveling with waiting. Yet when he got into his car again, he didn’t speak to the figure that seemed slumped over and motionless in his passenger seat. I asked what she was wearing; an odd question yes, but it was crucial. They told me that she was wearing a white dress, her skin looked pale and cold.” The note ended there.

Before I turned the page, I stopped for a minute to gather my thoughts.

“Everything ok?” My mother asked. I just nodded and turned the page, but before I looked at it, I chose to talk to my mother for a little bit.

“I’m half tempted to go on this road myself.” I said half-jokingly.

“You will not. Even if your grandfather asked you to, you’d have to do it with your own money and car, because I’m not lending you one.” My mother said smiling, acknowledging the semi-serious nature of the conversation. She got up and began boiling the kettle for another cup of tea while I poured over the last notes of the investigation. It took two, maybe two and a half more pages for me to guess that the case went cold after a while, a simple note of ‘chasing a ghost story’ appeared above the last page. Either he had lost interest or he feared going too deep into something that he had no knowledge of how to deal with. The man in the car that night had succumbed to his injuries, reports of high blood alcohol levels and the usage of over-the-counter drugs in his system caused his delirium, though that does not account for the report from one of the employees. After that night, he slowed down in investigations and instead became a deacon for my now local church. A church that was as far away from the Drakensberg Mountain as he could possibly get. Hoping that I would not make the same journey he did. Though I was still curious.

I remember the story circling the school as one of the teachers there shared an experience that her boyfriend had, calling it the visit of the ‘Lady in White’. It sounded cheap, a knock-off from what my grandfather wrote down, though I was not one to tell ghost stories to a group of Christian school children, calling it a true story would not get across to them effectively.

Still the story stayed with me until now, and I still wondered if it was true or a legend. I waited a while before I found out for myself.
