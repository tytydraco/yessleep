**Day 1**

I’m still breathing.

The station is eerily quiet, the usual hum of machinery replaced by an unsettling silence. The lights flickered sporadically, casting long ominous shadows across the walls. Equipment and machinery lay scattered, evidence of the chaos that had erupted moments before. I stood in the centre of it all, heart pounding, trying to make sense of my situation.

My crew mates were at the far end of the station. Their faces wore masks of fear and confusion as they called out to me, their voices barely audible over the ringing in my ears. I tried to move toward them, but my feet felt like they were stuck in mud. Every step was a struggle, as if the very air around me was thickening, holding me back.

Suddenly, the station began to shudder violently. The bulkheads groaned under the pressure, and the ceiling started to cave. Debris rained down, and I could feel the weight of it pressing down on me, making it even harder to breathe. The air was thick with dust and smoke, obscuring my vision. My crew mates were sliding further and further away, fading into darkness.

Just as the station seemed on the verge of complete collapse, a blinding light engulfed me. I felt a strange sensation, like being pulled through a tunnel at incredible speed. Next thing I knew, I was no longer on the space station.

I found myself in a room dimly lit by four spotlights shining directly in my eyes, the floors and walls smooth and metallic. The air was cool and sterile, a stark contrast to the chaos I had just escaped. As my eyes adjusted to the light, I realized I was not alone. Tall, slender, armored figures with multiple, hairy limbs and large, razor sharp mandibles stood around me. They moved with an eerie grace.

I was on a Pah’kreth vessel!

Panic surged in me, but before I could react, one of the beings stepped forward. It spoke in a language I couldn’t understand, yet somehow, the ominous meaning was clear in my mind. “We have saved you.”

I looked around, trying to comprehend what was happening. The space station, my crew mates, the collapse—it all seemed like a distant nightmare. But this was real. I was on an alien ship, saved from obliteration, but now facing an entirely new and uncertain future.

**Day 5**

I’m still breathing.

The cold, sterile Pah'kreth vessel was both my prison and my reality. Everyday melted into the next, an endless cycle of isolation and dread. They watched me constantly, their shiny, black, unblinking eyes fixated on me.

I was locked in a claustrophobic cell with a small window that I could just barely look through. The floor was cold and the dim lighting offered little comfort. Uncertainty gnawed at me.

The Pah’kreth seemed intent on breaking into my mind. They would bring me to a room and strap me to a chair surrounded by machinery and computers. Wires and probes connected to my temples, fingers, toes and groin. Waves of pain would surge through me as they attempted to extract information. The process left me drained, my thoughts a jumbled mess.

Every session was the same. Questions in an alien language I couldn’t understand, yet somehow, the meaning was clear. They wanted information. But why? I had no military knowledge, no secret codes, nothing of strategic value. My role on the space station was routine, mundane even. What could they possibly hope to gain from me?

Today’s session began as usual, with the cold, clinical procedure and the invasive probes. This time, the pain was more intense than I had ever felt, and the sensations were different. It felt as if they were peeling back layers of my consciousness, delving into memories I had long forgotten.

Flashes of my life on Earth flickered before my eyes: childhood moments, my family, my friends, routine days at the space station. They sifted through everything, dissecting my very essence. I could sense their frustration, their impatience. They were searching for something specific, something they believed I had.

The session ended abruptly. The probes were unhooked and I was escorted back to my cell. I collapsed onto the cold floor, my head throbbing and my body trembling. 

What were they looking for? Why were they so desperate for information from someone like me?

As I lay there, trying to make sense of it all, a new thought began to form. Maybe it wasn’t about what I knew, but what I represented? Humanity was being annihilated, running scared, frantic to survive. Perhaps I was a symbol, a test subject in their grand scheme. They wanted to understand us. Wanted to learn how to break us down and ensure there would be no resistance.

I couldn’t give up. I had to find a way to survive, to hold onto my humanity. If there was even a chance to fight back, I had to. 

I made a silent vow: 

Endure.

Resist 

I would find a way to escape.

**Day 10**

I’m still breathing.

The days had blended into a haze of pain and confusion, each session with the Pah'kreth more excruciating than the last. By now, the routine was ingrained in me: the cold, the invasive probes, the relentless search for something I couldn't comprehend. Each session left me more fragmented, my memories and sense of self dissolving into an incoherent soup.

On this day, the Pah'kreth took me to a different room. This one was larger, filled with even more equipment, pulsating with an eerie, organic light. They restrained me, but this time, the procedure felt different. There was a sense of finality, an air of anticipation or almost excitement among my captors. 

The pain suddenly surged through me more intensely than ever before, and I felt something break inside me. It was as if a dam burst, and a flood of memories, alien and terrifying, poured into my consciousness. My human life, my time on the station, my friends, my family—all of it shattered, replaced by something else, something profoundly different.

The realization hit me with a force that left me gasping for breath. I had never been human. I was a Pah'kreth plant, a sleeper agent meticulously crafted to look and act human, inserted among them to gather information, to observe, and to wait. My human memories were hollow fabrications, memory implants, a complex cover story to mask my true origin.

The experiments the Pah'kreth had been performing on me were not tortures but preparations, designed to awaken my mind and transport my consciousness to my new, real body. The agony I had endured was the price of my transformation.

As the final procedure ended, the world around me dissolved into darkness. 

Just keep breathing.

I’m in a new body, sleek and powerful, with the unmistakable features of the Pah'Kreth. My limbs are strong, my senses heightened, and my mind clear in a way it has never been before.This clarity brings with it a horror I can not bear.

My past human existence could not be reconciled with my true self. The memories of my human life, though false, felt real, and the emotions tied to them were genuine. I remember the warmth of human relationships, the simple joys and sorrows, the sense of identity that defined me. My wife, my crew-mates, my friends - all of it rendered meaningless, a cruel joke played on me by my own kind.

I staggered through corridors, my new body feeling weak despite its obvious strength. Desperation clawed at my mind as I tried to make sense of my existence, find a way to replace the human I thought I was, with the Pah'Kreth I had become. It was impossible. The two identities were irreconcilable, locked in a battle that tore at the very fabric of my sanity.

In a daze, I realize I’m in an airlock. The cold, sterile ship humming around me, indifferent to my plight. My mind is a whirlwind of fragmented memories and unbearable truths. There is no escape from what I am, no way to return to the person I had once believed myself to be.

Desperation.

I open the airlock. The black void of space yawning before me, a vast, indifferent expanse. As I step forward, the last remnants of my human memories flash before my eyes: the faces of my crew mates, the collapsing space station, the blinding light, the smiling face of my wife. 

And then, nothing. Just the cold embrace of the vacuum, a final release from the torment of my divided existence.

I had been a tool in a war I barely understood. 

In the end, it was my human memories, false though they were, that had defined me. It was in those memories that I found my last moment of truth.

No more breath.
