I get back on my feet. I’m so hungry. These past two weeks have rolled by in one endless, all-consuming blur. My stomach rumbles constantly, and I’m terrified of what will happen if I can’t find something to eat soon. My sleep schedule is abysmal. As I think about it now, I can’t remember the last time I slept. I just walk, and walk, and walk. Nourishment and satiation consume my every moment.

I thought the group I stumbled upon a few weeks ago could have helped me, but when I came around the corner to greet them, they, in unison, let out horrific screams and ran the other way—far, far from me. I tried to follow them for a while, shouting that I’m one of the good guys. I’m just lonely and looking for a little bit of food. But alas, I’m too slow to catch them. It hurt my feelings somewhat, but in this new world, I guess everyone has to look out for themselves. Common decency is a thing of the past, apparently.

So I walk some more. I’m not sure where I’m headed, but the hunger inside my stomach growls, feeling like a sort of spiritual guide. I think if I just listen, it’ll lead me to something. Something to eat, hopefully. I’m not sure how much longer I can last.

I can’t remember the last time I even heard my own voice. I’m trying to speak now, but all that comes out is a garbled mess. No matter. I continue to walk, with no direction other than where my stomach is leading me. I can’t even feel my feet below me anymore. It just feels like I'm floating over the ground, gravitating towards anything warm and edible.

I can hear something towards the end of this road, backed into an alley. It sounds like a woman moaning in her sleep. She must be having some kind of nightmare. My stomach growls at the sight of her. The hunger pulls me closer to her sleeping form, my mouth salivating as I creep nearer. I’ll try my best to be quiet, so I won’t wake her. The dirty, disheveled lady mumbles something in her slumber, but I can’t quite make it out. It sounds like when I was trying to find my voice—garbled, like a foreign language. 

She wakes up a second too late ,unfortunately for her, as my hands plunge into her stomach. She squeals and thrashes from side to side but the hunger has made my hands into iron-clad vice grips that imprison her.

I can feel my teeth take a huge chunk out of her midsection before I even take a moment to consider what I’m doing. It’s so deliciously warm. The meat euphorically slides over my tongue. After the first bite, I can’t stop. I eat and eat until her screams fade away. After a while she goes disgustingly cold. My stomach is already rumbling again.

I get back on my feet. I’m so hungry. These past two weeks have rolled by in one endless, all-consuming blur. My stomach rumbles..
