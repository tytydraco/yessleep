I’m not really the type to post stuff like this. I don’t believe in telling ghost stories, I don’t read creepypasta, and I sure as hell don’t sit around watching YouTube videos with red circles and arrows pointing at blurry shadows.

But lately, I’ve been thinking about the old lunatic asylum. And I think I just need to write it all out.

This happened back in 1987. I was twenty-four and broke, living in a shoebox-sized studio apartment above a pawn shop on Lorain Avenue, near West 41st in Cleveland. I had no job, no girlfriend, and no idea what I was doing with my life — just a mattress and a black-and-white TV sitting on a milk crate, and a growing pile of unopened bills from Columbia House because I thought twelve cassette tapes for a penny was a good deal.

Fresh off a 120-hour security course at Wooster Business College, I was desperate enough to answer a sun-faded flyer stapled to a telephone pole. It read:

**NIGHT SECURITY – $9.75/hr**  
**CALL ED // 555-6913**

Now, $9.75 an hour in 1987? That was serious money for a guy like me. Most warehouse shifts paid maybe six. I figured it was a scam or some shady private security thing where you had to shake down teenagers for smoking pot in parking lots.

I called the number anyway.

The guy who answered sounded old. His voice had that phlegmy smoker rasp, like he’d been yelling at factory machines for forty years. Said his name was Ed something — I never caught the last name — and told me to come down to the office to fill out an application.

First thing the next morning, I headed straight to the address he rattled off over the phone — Denison Security Associates.

The office sat between a furniture store and a pawn shop. The windows were coated with so much nicotine residue you could barely see inside. The door handle was cold and loose, and a paper sign taped to the glass said **RING FOR ENTRY.**

Inside, the air was thick with the smell of stale coffee, copier toner, and floor wax. A woman with bleached hair and too much eyeliner sat behind the desk, smoking while she typed on a beige IBM keyboard. She didn’t even look up when I came in.

“You here for work?” she asked, ash trembling at the end of her cigarette.

“Yeah. Got my certification a couple of weeks ago.”

“Firearms certified?”

“Yeah.”

She nodded and slid a clipboard across the counter. “Fill that out. Don’t miss the social or they won’t pay you.”

Halfway through the form, a voice from the back shouted, “You certified, kid?”

I held up the blue paper.

“Good enough. C’mon back.”

The man behind the voice was short, thick around the middle, with a tie that had been knotted since 1975. He sat behind a desk piled with clipboards and spare radios. A sign taped to the wall read **DON’T CALL OFF — DEAD IS THE ONLY EXCUSE.**

He looked me up and down. “Got your own piece?”

“Yeah.”

“What kind?”

“.38 revolver. Smith & Wesson.”

He grunted approval. “Good. No paperwork nightmare there. You can start tonight. Cleveland Developmental Center. Graveyard shift. It’s city property, quiet as a tomb. Just don’t fall asleep. They like to check the boiler logs every morning.”

I nodded like I understood what that meant.

He opened a narrow closet, rummaged through a rack of blue shirts, and handed me one still wrapped in plastic. “You’re a large, right?”

“Medium.”

He handed me the large anyway. “Don’t wash it in hot water. They shrink.”

Then he grinned, a yellow-toothed smirk that made the fluorescent light catch the sweat on his forehead.  
“Welcome to Denison Security Associates, kid.”

I walked out of **DSA** with a half-folded application in my back pocket, a navy-blue uniform shirt in a dry cleaner bag slung over my shoulder, and the name *Cleveland Developmental Center* scribbled on a neon pink Post-it note that was already curling at the edges from my palm sweat.

The air outside smelled like wet concrete and car exhaust. There was a dead pigeon by the curb, wing outstretched like it had been halfway through a dramatic monologue before it keeled over.

The Nova was parked where I left it — two spots away from a broken vending machine and across from a chain-link fence holding back three angry dogs and a rusted-out boat on blocks.

I tossed the uniform shirt onto the passenger seat like it might bite me.

Sat there a moment, keys in hand.

No handshake. No formalities. Just “You’re hired.”

That was it.

**No orientation. No tour. No warning.**

I started the car. The engine rattled like a dying shopping cart.

The drive home took fifteen minutes, most of it spent squinting through a cracked windshield that smeared light like bad mascara. The heat barely worked. I aimed the vents at the fogged glass and hoped for the best.

Lorain Avenue looked like it always did in late afternoon — gray, half asleep, stripped of anything hopeful. Corner stores with hand-painted signs. Check cashing joints with paper signs taped inside the windows. Men with sunken eyes and gas station coffee leaning against brick walls like they were waiting for a bus that never came.

When I turned onto my block near West 41st, the sky was already starting to bruise. The clouds were low and heavy, tinged yellow near the edges like they were stained from the inside.

My building sat above a pawn shop that never seemed open, even when the lights were on. The windows were covered with steel mesh and sun-bleached flyers for broken guitars and out-of-box VCRs. The hallway to the stairs always smelled like old lettuce and carpet glue.

The walk up felt longer than usual.

Every step echoed.

My studio apartment had enough room for a mattress, a hot plate, and a dented microwave that sparked if you looked at it wrong. The floor sloped toward the bathroom like the whole place was slowly sinking. You could hear every neighbor sneeze, argue, or flush. I’d lived there for six months and still didn’t know anyone’s name.

I kicked off my shoes, dropped the uniform on the mattress, and sat on the edge of it with my jacket still on.

I didn’t unpack.

Didn’t hang the shirt up.

 I spent the rest of that day sitting on my mattress, chain-smoking Marlboro lights and watching static on the little black-and-white TV I kept on a milk crate. I found myself glancing at the clock way too often, like I was waiting for something to happen. A phone call canceling the whole thing. A knock on the door.

Anything.

By the time the sun dipped below the rooftops outside, the apartment had that dull, blue-grey light that made everything feel underwater. I put on my uniform, threw on my beat-up leather jacket, and pocketed my last working flashlight — the fat metal kind that took four D batteries and could double as a weapon if you held it right.

Then I grabbed my keys and headed down the stairs to my car.

The drive out there took longer than I expected. Cleveland traffic at night isn’t bad, but the Developmental Center was tucked way down on the southeast side, past the factories and the strip malls and into that weird no-man’s land where you start seeing houses with boarded windows and half-collapsed porches. The kind of neighborhoods where nobody trick-or-treated anymore.

I had to check the address twice. The place didn’t show up on my glovebox road atlas, and MapQuest wasn’t a thing yet. All I had was a scrap of paper with some directions scribbled in red ink.

By the time I hit Ridgewood, my headlights were catching bits of trash rolling across the road — newspapers, snack bags, a busted umbrella. The trees lining the street were tall and tangled, casting shadows across the pavement like fingers reaching for the car.

I thought I was lost until I saw the gate.

It was massive — wrought iron, rusted, with a padlocked chain dangling uselessly from one side. Someone had spray-painted over the original “CLEVELAND DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER” lettering, but the outline still bled through like an old bruise. Beneath it, a plywood sign read:

**EMPLOYEES ONLY**

A single orange light flickered above it.

I pulled through the open side gate — someone had clearly cut the chain — and found myself driving into what looked like an entire ghost town.

The cottages were the first thing I saw. A half a dozen of them. Little one-story buildings circling the old asylum. I guess they were meant to be patient housing back in the day, or maybe halfway homes — I’m not sure. But now? Every window was either broken or boarded, every yard overgrown with yellow grass and car-sized weeds. A few still had swing sets or rusted lawn chairs out front, frozen in place like some invisible family had vanished mid-picnic.

I slowed down as I passed. Even with the windows rolled up, it felt like I was driving through something heavy. Like the air itself didn’t want me there.

Then I saw it.

The main asylum building.

Even in the dark, it looked huge. Bigger than I imagined. Five stories tall, built in that old 19th-century gothic style with pointed roofs and narrow windows that made the whole thing look like it was glaring at you. Part of the top floor had caved in — I could see where the roof had collapsed, like a giant had stomped on it — and ivy had swallowed half the brickwork. Every window on the second and third floor was black, but not empty-black. More like **watching**\-black. If that makes any sense.

It was a building that looked like it remembered every scream it had ever heard.

I drove past it without slowing down.

The actual security office was in a newer building — maybe 1960s or 70s construction. A squat, single-floor box with ugly yellow brick and that gravel tar roof every school had when I was a kid. A flickering fluorescent light buzzed above the entrance, and one of the ceiling tiles inside looked like it had fallen through, leaving a dark hole that stared back at me.

There were two cars in the parking lot: a white city-issued station wagon with “CLEVELAND DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER” stenciled on the side, and a beat-up Dodge Dart with one red door.

I parked next to the Dart.

Inside, it was warmer than I expected. The building smelled like old coffee, Pine-Sol, and something else — mildew, maybe. There was a long desk with a battered clipboard on it, a corkboard full of outdated notices, and a row of old black-and-white monitors buzzing faintly behind a wire mesh cage. The screens cycled through grainy camera feeds — mostly dark corridors, empty stairwells, and the occasional flicker of static.

The only light came from a tiny desk lamp and a vending machine humming in the corner. The kind with buttons that clunked when you pushed them and a soda can dropped like a rock into a metal tray.

The guy I was relieving stood up when I walked in.

He was taller than me, with a soft paunch under his security windbreaker and the look of someone who smoked every cigarette down to the filter. His skin had that yellow-gray tint of too much coffee and not enough sleep. He looked me up and down like he was measuring me for a coffin, then nodded.

“You’re the new guy?” he said, without turning fully around.

“Yeah,” I said. “Name’s Patrick.”

He nodded, sipped his coffee, and grunted. “Good luck.”

“Uh... thanks?”

He set the cup down and grabbed his keys from the desk, pocketing a beat-up flashlight that looked older than me.

“You’re replacing Carter,” he said. “The one who got fired. You hear about that?”

I shook my head.

He smirked like it wasn’t the first time he’d told it. “Guy before you threw a party down in the tunnels. Beer, girls, music, the whole damn circus. Then claimed he saw a ghost girl at the far end of C-hall and emptied his piece into the wall.”

I blinked.

“He shot at a ghost?”

“That’s what he told the bosses. Said she was floating. Dressed in white. His exact words were, ‘Her feet weren’t touching the floor.’”

He opened the door.

“Anyway, you’ll probably be fine,” he said, stepping into the dark. “Just don’t go looking for anything down there.”

Then the door closed behind him.

Miller didn’t say goodbye. He just left. His taillights disappeared down the long drive, and I was alone.

I stood there for a minute, not moving. Just listening. The guard station hummed with the quiet sounds of old wiring — the fluorescent buzz, the low whir of the vending machine compressor, the occasional soft *click* as the monitor switched camera feeds.

Outside, it was quieter. Too quiet, if I’m honest. No dogs barking, no traffic, not even wind. Just that kind of thick winter silence that makes your ears ring.

Then the space heater in the corner kicked on with a loud *clunk*, and I nearly jumped out of my skin.

Miller had left a checklist on the desk — handwritten in dark marker.

**1. Check every cottage.**  
**2. Sign the boiler log.**  
**3. Deliver newspapers to the admin building in the morning.**  
**4. NO PARTIES.**

That last line was underlined twice.

There were about six cottages total — arranged in two concentric circles around the asylum. I decided to start with the outer ring and work my way in.

So I bundled up, grabbed the ring of brass keys hanging from a bent nail near the door, and stepped out into the cold.

It was *freezing*.

The kind of cold that feels like it’s trying to saw through your jacket seams and get at the meat underneath. My breath came out in thick clouds, and the gravel crunched under my boots like broken glass.

The cottages were worse up close.

Each one had its own little cracked sidewalk leading up to a chipped cement stoop, most with storm doors that groaned when I pulled them open. Half the outer windows were busted out and boarded over. The interiors smelled like stale air and wet insulation — that distinct rot smell of a building that hasn’t been lived in for decades.

Inside, they were all more or less the same: single rooms with rusting metal bedframes, empty bookshelves, old particleboard desks with drawers that swelled shut from humidity. A few had posters peeling off the walls — Nixon-era safety charts, torn-up anatomy diagrams. One had a rosary nailed above the doorway like some long-forgotten charm to keep something out.

The boilers looked like something salvaged from a sunken ship — big, industrial beasts squatting in the corners of each utility room, all dented metal and riveted seams. Their fronts were covered in mesh grates, and the dials looked like something off a submarine. I checked to make sure the gage was still in the green zone like the laminated cheat sheet said, and waited for that faint rattle and hiss — the sound of gas waking up in the pipes.

Every time I stepped out of one cottage, I found myself hugging close to the next, never stepping too far into the open. Because right there in the middle of the circle — always visible, always looming — was that damn asylum building.

Even from a distance, it made my stomach knot.

By daylight it probably looked like a historical relic. But at night, that place looked *wrong*. Not haunted, exactly — just... hurt. Damaged. Like it had seen things it would never recover from. The upper floors were scorched black in places, like there’d been a fire at some point, and some of the windows had cracked in such a way that they looked like staring eyes. Or screaming mouths.

It wasn’t just old. It was *angry*. And the longer I looked at it, the more I felt like it was daring me to come closer.

So I didn’t.

I stuck to the cottages, one by one. Kept my flashlight low. Did the job. But I also snooped. Couldn’t help it.

There was a strange sameness to each one — like they’d been staged for a low-budget horror movie and no one ever came to shoot. But once in a while, I’d find something personal. A baby shoe, long since hardened with time. A hand mirror with a crack down the center, laid on the floor like someone dropped it mid-step. One had a stack of old magazines — *Good Housekeeping*, *Life*, and a copy of *TIME* from 1971 with the title “THE TROUBLED MIND” on the cover.

The weirdest was cottage #4. That one had a single dusty chair in the middle of the room — just a plain wooden kitchen chair, facing the far wall. Nothing else. No bed, no shelves, no heater. Just the chair. And on the wall it faced, someone had written a word in black marker, over and over again:

**NO.**  
**NO.**  
**NO.**  
**NO.**  
**NO.**

I didn’t linger in that one.

By the time I finished, the cold had crept through my boots and up my legs. My hands were stiff, even in gloves. I returned to the security office and sat there watching the monitors for hours, telling myself I hadn’t seen anything strange. Nothing moved. Nothing blinked. Just empty halls and static-filled corridors. That was it.

When the clock crawled past 6:30, I peeled myself out of the chair and grabbed the bundle of newspapers from beside the door — tightly wrapped in plastic, still a little damp from the cold. It was part of the job. Morning drop-off to the admin building. Simple enough.

The sky was getting lighter but hadn’t turned blue yet. Just that early-morning grey that makes everything look flat and empty. The wind had picked up while I was inside, and my jacket collar kept slapping the side of my face as I crossed the lot. The cottages stood silent around me, looking even more lifeless than they had overnight — like props waiting for someone to turn the lights back on.

The administration building sat across from the security office like it didn’t want to be associated with the rest. A two-story brick box with heavy doors and long windows that reflected nothing but overcast sky. One of the door handles was loose and made a metal-on-metal squeal when I pulled it open.

Inside, the heat blasted me like I’d walked into a laundromat mid-cycle. Stale and too dry. It smelled like scorched dust, burnt coffee, and something vaguely sweet I couldn’t place. The lights were all on — flickering fluorescents that made my eyes ache after a night of nothing but moonlight and black-and-white cameras.

I stepped into the hallway, unsure where to go with the papers. I hadn’t been given much of a tour. I figured I’d just drop one on every flat surface until someone told me I was doing it wrong.

That’s when I saw her.

She stepped out of one of the offices down the hall with a Styrofoam cup in one hand and a folder in the other. She wasn’t startled to see me — just mildly curious.

She looked to be late forties, maybe early fifties, with that kind of no-nonsense face that always looks slightly unimpressed but not unkind. Salt-and-pepper hair pulled back into a practical ponytail, and big square glasses on a thin chain that kept sliding down her nose. Her cardigan had a snag in the sleeve, and her shoes looked like they’d been picked for comfort over fashion about ten years ago.

“Newspapers?” she said, not quite smiling.

I held up the bundle. “First time. They didn’t tell me where these go.”

She took a sip from her coffee and nodded toward the hallway behind me. “Break room gets one. Copy room too. I take two — one here, one there.” Then she glanced at my uniform. “You’re the new overnight.”

“Yeah. Just started.”

She didn’t say “welcome.” She just gave a tiny nod, like that explained everything.

I dropped the papers where she pointed and was about to turn to leave when she added, “Watch your step near the stairwell at the end of the hall. Lock’s sticky.”

I nodded, not sure what to make of that — or her.

She watched me for a second longer than felt normal. Then, without another word, she disappeared back into her office, the sound of paper shuffling fading behind the door.

I didn’t hang around.

Once the papers were dropped off and the morning sky had shifted from gray to pale gold, I headed straight for the Nova. The sun made everything look flatter somehow. Less haunted, maybe. But no less depressing. The buildings — the cottages, the security office, the main facility — all sat there like they were waiting for something. And I didn’t want to be around when it showed up.
