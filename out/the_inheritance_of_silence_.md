I never wanted my great-aunt Agatha's house. The place always gave me the creeps as a kid, with its peeling Victorian wallpaper and rooms that seemed to whisper. But here I was, key in hand, the sole inheritor of a house that had been in our family for generations.
The lawyer handed me an envelope along with the key. "Your aunt's final instructions," he said. "To be opened only once you've spent a night in the house."
That first night, I tossed and turned in Agatha's old four-poster bed. The house creaked and settled around me, each sound making me jump. But it wasn't until 3:17 AM that the real strangeness began.
A low hum filled the air, barely audible at first. It grew louder, resolving into what sounded like dozens of voices murmuring just below the threshold of comprehension. I stumbled out of bed, following the sound to the attic.

The voices stopped the moment I opened the attic door. In the moonlight streaming through the dusty window, I saw rows and rows of old tape recorders, their reels slowly turning.
Heart pounding, I pressed play on the nearest one. A child's voice emerged:
"May 12, 1954. I'm scared. The shadows are moving again. Mom says it's just my imagination, but I know what I saw. They're getting closer every night."
I tried another:
"September 3, 1972. It's been a week since Dad disappeared. The police think he left us, but I heard him screaming in the walls last night."
Tape after tape, year after year, all from different people, all describing terrifying events in this house.

 The final tape was dated just a week before Aunt Agatha died:
"They're coming for me tonight. I've held them off for so long, but I'm tired. Remember the rules, dear. Never listen to more than one tape per night. Never play them after midnight. And never, ever try to record over them."
Shaken, I retreated to my room. In the morning, I opened Aunt Agatha's envelope. 

Inside was a single sheet of paper:
"The house must always have a keeper. The tapes must always be played. I'm sorry."
Over the next weeks, I listened to one tape each night, as instructed. The stories were horrifying, detailing supernatural encounters, disappearances, and inexplicable phenomena. But nothing happened to me. The house remained quiet.
Until the night I fell asleep before I could play a tape.
I woke to the sound of static. Every electronic device in the house was on, emitting white noise. And in that static, I heard voices - the same voices from the tapes, all screaming for help.


The walls began to ripple. Dark shapes pressed against the wallpaper, trying to push through. I ran to the attic and grabbed a random tape, fumbling to play it.
The moment the tape started, everything went silent. The shapes retreated. The house was still once more.
I've been here for months now. I know I can never leave. Each night, I play a tape, holding back whatever horrors are trying to break through. But there are only so many tapes, and I'm running out.
I've started recording my own experiences, adding to the archive. If you're reading this, it means the house has passed to you. I'm sorry. Remember the rules. Keep the tapes playing.
And whatever you do, don't let the silence in.
