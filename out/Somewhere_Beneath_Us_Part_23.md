&#x200B;

I opened my eyes to find myself lying in a dusty hospital bed, the white bulbs above me bleaching the color from the surrounding area. I remembered traveling down hallways with Alice, but I didn't recall blacking out. However, I suppose it was to be expected with how much strain my body had been under. I scanned the room to find the woman slumped in a visitors chair, fast asleep. Not wanting to disturb her, I sat up slowly and inspected my wounds. Bloody bandages covered my arms where lacerations had been made, and patches of gauze had been placed over the parts of my torso that hadn't been spared.

"You're awake."

My head pivoted to Alice, "I thought you were sleeping."

"This place has made me a pretty light sleeper."

I held up my bandaged hand and smiled, "I'm going to be very upset with you if you don't go back to Med school when we get out."

She laughed softly. "You're lucky to be alive. With how bad some of those cuts were, I'm surprised she didn't hit something vital. How are you feeling?"

"Surprising well, actually. Thank you, Alice. You saved my life."

She nodded and brushed a strand of hair from her face but didn't speak.

"Did you... carry me here?"

"You blacked out pretty close by. I dragged you the rest of the way."

"Good thing there was a hospital room close by, huh?"

"Well, it was actually a few floors above where I found you, but you managed pretty well up until then."

"How long have I been out for?"

"About a day, I think. At least according to your watch beeps."

I nodded, but then another question dawned on me. "How long has it been since I last saw you?"

She pursed her lips and looked down to the floor, "probably around two months."

I shot up so straight that it caused the cuts on my stomach to sting, "T-Two months? Oh my gosh, Bea, I need to-"

Alice hopped up and crossed over to me, placing a hand on my shoulder as I tried to stand from the bed, "Joel, slow down. You lost a lot of blood. Your body is still recovering."

I certainly didn't feel like I had sustained life-threatening injuries, but that was most likely just adrenaline. My mind was in full-blown panic mode, but I did my best to obey. I didn't want to think about how much might have happened in just the couple of months I had been away. From my room, I now knew that my friends would be alright with their injuries, but that didn't mean that they weren't suffering this whole time. On top of that, if anyone from the surface had given up hope and tried to come find us… A million horrible possibilities raced through my head, but Alice stopped them all at once.

"Your friends are okay. I mean, at least they're alive. I've been monitoring their rooms."

I looked at her, confused, before my brain connected another thing she had said a bit ago. We had traveled several floors upward while I was bleeding out and practically unconscious.

"How are you doing that? How are you getting around so fast?"

"The elevator. Do you not remember riding it?"

"No."

"I guess you were pretty out of it." She said, twirling her earring. "There's an elevator in the middle of every floor. As far as I can tell, it and the rooms it connects to are the only places that the house can't move. The shaft goes all the way from the surface to the garage below. even deeper than that too."

"I remember seeing it down there when I was with-"

His name caught in my throat, and I looked past Alice to see the axe she had been wielding leaning against the wall. When he died, I was so mentally broken that I could hardly process the grief. That was all catching up now.

Alice pieced together what I was thinking and sat on the bed next to me, "I'm so sorry, Joel…."

I continued to stare at the weapon and did my best to hold back tears, "He went out saving me. The house came to take me to my room, and he attacked it with that axe. I think he hurt it pretty bad, too."

She nodded, "When I found my way out of that place below, I came to look for you two. I figured you wouldn't leave without your friends. As I started walking, though, I found his body." Before she continued, she paused, "I made a nice place for him. Well, as nice as it can be in here. I covered him up and decorated around him so it would be peaceful."

At that, I couldn't contain my tears anymore. They were silent though, undisturbed by violent sobs or gasps. Once I had taken a moment, I nodded, "Thank you, Alice. That was very nice of you. I wish I could have been there."

"I can take you if you'd like."

I shook my head, "That's alright." I smiled with a slight chuckle, "He'd probably be mad at me if I spent time doing that instead of trying to rescue my friends."

Alice said nothing, but I could tell she understood.

"Ethan." I forced myself to say out loud. It nearly physically hurt as it swelled past the lump in my throat, but I needed to say it. I didn't want his name to be another one I was too afraid to speak.

His optimism. His positivity. No matter how bad things got in the house, above or below, Ethan was always dead set on keeping spirits high. Once, after we exiled Larry, he tried to cheer everyone up with a "movie night." We didn't have T.V, obviously, But that didn't stop him from reenacting several films from memory all by himself. Sure, it was cheesy, but watching him pretend to be both Jack and Rose from Titanic at the same time made it impossible not to smile.

After a brief respite, I was immediately back to business. As hopeless as things had become, I felt more invigorated than ever. It was one part determination to finish the job I had started and two parts pure rage toward the creature that had damned my friends and me. Since the night in the parking garage, the shattered fragments of my mind had been formulating a new plan, and now that those shards were back together, everything seemed so clear. It was going to be hard, but nothing so far had been easy, and I was somehow still alive. Although, according to Ethan's dream, that might not be the case for too much longer. But he also said that he had changed some of his dreams. I was betting on that single fact alone.

I wanted to get up and moving, but Alice wouldn't allow it, telling me that I at least needed one more day of rest before we continued. I begrudgingly agreed, but to make me feel better, she began to fill me in on all the details she had learned since she had escaped. According to her, once she had gotten out of the house's lower depths and found Ethan's body, she had assumed the worst for me. She knew that if I had gotten taken, no one else would be coming back up for our group.

"Why didn't you just leave? You must have seen the exit." I asked her.

She fidgeted with the ear of a stuffed bunny in her coat pocket, "I didn't want you all to end up like my friends." She responded.

Moving forward, she followed a blood trail that had been left when the Sarah creature had taken me. She found that it led to the only door out of the garage. Knowing better than to go in, she propped the door open with one of her stuffed animals and decided to come back. That's when she found the elevator. Apparently, it was the only other way out of the garage and, to her surprise, the key to moving to any floor of the house.

"There's a number pad inside. When I stepped in, the display said the parking lot was floor 878, so I started punching in numbers higher than that. Whatever floor I typed in, it would take me there."

"You never tired going lower?"

Alice's face went ghost white as she struggled to muster a response, "I did once out of curiosity, but I never left the elevator once the doors opened."

"Why? What's down there?"

She shook her head, "let's just say the house looks less like a house after floor 880."

I didn't push the topic any further.

From there, she set to work looking for answers. She discovered a few rooms that were actually occupied, but found that they tended not to move. It seemed the house had no need to shift its traps once the prey had been caught.

"I don't know why it does it," Alice commented. "I don't understand what it's gaining from all of this."

"Before it attacked Ethan and me after we all split up, it said something to us. That it smelled me below and was salivating at the thought of having me." I told her. I couldn't help but think of venus fly traps. The way they baited their prey into their mouths and snapped shut, locking them inside to be digested slowly. "I think it's feeding on us, the people it captures. I felt weird in my room, like my soul was being worn down through my pain. This whole place is like one big stomach."

We both shuddered at the thought.

I asked her about the rooms she knew of, seeing if she had found any matching Daniel's room or anything that might be Bea's. She had what seemed like a match for Daniel; floor 693. The elevator on the level only opened into one room with a locked door that slowly leaked water from its seams. The floor number seemed to match up with when we lost Dan, and the water certainly felt like it belonged to his room. Once I took care of what I needed to, that was where I would look for Daniel.

His strength. His levelheadedness. Ever the leader, Daniel always put the group's interests first. He was just as scared and confused as the rest of us the day we arrived in the house, yet he never showed it. After the first few weeks, when starvation began to set in, Daniel was the first person to volunteer to go downstairs and scavenge for food. He insisted on going alone, as he didn't want anyone else to be at risk, but we didn't let him. If he hadn't felt the need to stick around for the rest of us, I truly believe Dan would have attempted the journey to the exit on his own long before Andi had.

As for Bea, the closest thing she knew of was an area on floor 864, just a few levels above the exit. It was a door located among the tangle of halls and minor rooms that opened into a pitch-black void. At first, she thought it was a sheer drop, but tossing a piece of debris into it, she found that there actually was unseen ground. However, she decided against going inside, not wanting to chance it. She returned a few times after to find that the door never moved though, meaning it was most likely holding someone. If Bea fell into a dark void, she probably ended up there. I now had two headings.

There were more rooms too, she told me. People who must have been here long before our groups, being slowly drained year by year since their arrival. Most of them were tormented by some sort of creature or creatures. Others were trapped alone to suffer in a specific environment. One particular room she described caught my attention; a television set for a kids' T.V show. A man was trapped, living among horrific puppets and mascots. It seemed that I hadn't witnessed Larry's final moments after all. However, I wasn't sure if that was a fact I was happy about anymore. Interestingly enough, though, Alice told me the man didn't have a scratch on him when I asked. My last moments of witnessing him saw Larry getting eaten alive. How could the House keep you alive even through that?

Alice only observed them when she was able but never dared to try and enter herself. She didn't want to risk getting trapped or killed before she could find an escape for the rest of us.

"Speaking of which, how did you get out of your room?" She asked me.

"Partially thanks to you. I'm sure the door would have been locked had you not propped it open. But initially, the house had let my creature out to find me. I figured if it could get out once, it could get out again, and somehow it was able to bring me with it."

"Strange… I wonder if they all have that ability."

"It's possible. The creature I was trapped with called the House her 'father'. Maybe they're a part of its form in some way?" Alice shook her head and began running over the new information when I had a thought. "Wait, if you've been roaming the house for so long, how has it not caught you?"

She sat up and, without a word, grabbed the axe, then pressed the head against the wall. She dragged it across the surface, crumbling away at the old sheetrock. I stared, surprised.

"Is that new?"

She nodded, "I don't know how or when, but I think I've somehow become like Ethan was. One day I just accidentally dropped the axe and dented the floor. That's when I realized."

"So you can hurt the house? Like Ethan could?"

"I think so, yes. It might have something to do with me being missing for so long. If Ethan wasn't supposed to be here at all, and that's why he was able to damage things, maybe the house loosened its hold on me after it thought I was dead. Now I'm like he was. That's why it hasn't noticed me running around either."

I nodded, "Maybe. That would make sense."

As we finished the conversation, Alice wrapped the last part of a fresh bandage around my hand and then placed a pin to hold it in place. "There you go. These ones should last a lot longer since the cuts have been sealed. Surprisingly well, actually; there's barely even a scar. They must have been very precise incisions to close up so soon. Just take it easy on them."

I shook my head yes as convincingly as I could, but I knew they would probably split again before the day was over. Now that I was feeling better, it was time to move, and the rest of my afternoon wasn't going to go well.

"Thank you, Alice… Again." I said. She avoided eye contact as she usually did and nodded. I couldn't help but feel sad for her. She was clearly carrying something heavy to have gone through all of this and still be so humble.

"Oh," she suddenly grunted, "I almost forgot. Here." She said, grabbing an item sitting on the table next to my bed. "This fell out of your belt when I was dragging you here. I didn't want you to roll over it, so I just left it-"

Before she could finish, I grabbed the item and jammed it into my belt behind my jacket. "What fell out? I didn't have anything tucked in my belt." I said, plainly as possible.

She looked at me, baffled, but I made a face at her that urged her to roll with it. She clearly didn't understand but when along anyways. I felt bad for being so abrupt and rude, but I couldn't have us talking aloud about it for even a second. Now that I was free, the house could be watching us from anywhere, and it couldn't know about what I had in my belt. I instantly changed the subject, trying not to think about it. Thinking about it was just as dangerous.

"I know you've already done so much for us, Alice, but could you take me to the floor that might have Bea? I need to know if she's alright."

"Oh, um, of course. Are you sure you're ready?"

"I never really am, but unfortunately, I don't think I have time to change that fact."

Alice nodded, and together we stood, gathered up our belongings, and began making our way down the liminal halls of the house once again. It was strange to admit, but I had actually missed the quiet ambiance of the dark corridors, no matter how dangerous they were. It reminded me of a time long ago when we had first set out. I had been so full of determination and vigor then, surrounded by people I loved. Now I was alone and tired, so ready to rest. At least the familiar setting kept that ember barely kindled, reminding me of how far I had come.

Just a little further now…

Finding the elevator again was easy, as all we had to do was follow the trail of blood that led straight to it. It was broken in some places from minor rooms shifting, but that didn't matter, according to Alice. Like she said, the lift was always in the center of every floor, so as long as you kept a general idea of where you were after stepping out (and so long as you didn't find yourself in a room as it shifted), You could get back to it relatively easy.

Alice pushed the button to the side of the plain metal door, and it lit up with a dim yellow glow. A rattling whir came from the other side before a chime sounded, and the doors slowly slid open to reveal a plain box composed of metal paneling and mirrors. She stepped inside first, then turned to me.

"Come on in."

I listened and spoke as I did, "I can't believe we never ran into this thing once in all the time we were traveling through."

"I've thought about that too, with my group. We never saw it either. I think the house probably kept us as far away from it as possible as it watched us. Now that it doesn't know we're here, the rooms aren't shifting us away from it."

She reached over to the keypad on the wall where buttons would typically be and punched in '864'. After a second, the doors closed, and I felt the elevator begin to glide upward.

"How high does this thing go?"

"All the way up to the floor below the first basement; floor one. Its the one before the big staircase to the top? I tried to go up there to contact your group, but the Curator has practically been living on that floor. It's been acting different lately, not as aggressive…."

"It got hurt pretty bad that night Ethan and I got attacked in the garage. It's probably still recovering."

The doors opened once again, and the two of us stepped out. In a few moments, we had just traveled what would have taken weeks to travel by foot. I couldn't help but laugh at the thought. This house really was out to get us at every turn.

"The room isn't too far from the Elevator. About an hour walk maybe, depending on how the rooms are laid out today." She pulled a small notebook out of her jacket and flipped through some pages before looking to a door on her right. "This way."

I began moving through the colossal labyrinth, following Alice's lead as she went. It seemed she, too, had mapped out parts of the house in a notebook; however, unlike myself, her map was in steps in specific directions from the elevator. This was a better idea, as even if rooms around you were different, you would still know how far you were from a certain destination and which direction to go. Much more time-consuming, for sure. However, what else was there to spend your time on in this prison?

We reached the door in a little under Alice's estimated time. It was located at the end of a long movie theater hallway, a simple black door that usually would swing open into one of the showrooms. Now, it peered only into a dark abyss, just as she had said. A popcorn bucket sat a distance into the room, resting on nothingness, presumably the debris she had mentioned. I turned to Alice.

"Wait here, I'm going inside."

She shook her head, "I'll come with you. There's no sense in you going in alone. Especially not when you're injured."

"I'm fine now. I can't even feel the cuts anymore." She gave me a skeptical look but said nothing, so I finally caved, "Alright, fine, we don't have time to debate."

I held on to the doorway just in case, then slowly stuck my foot into the 'room'. Just like the popcorn bucket, it found ground to rest on. I moved in entirely, and Alice followed after latching the door open behind us. Instantly, my senses went wild trying to figure out the room. There were no sounds of footsteps below us, no smells that I could distinguish, and other than the open door behind us, no landmarks to know just how big or small the area was. We crept forward cautiously and carefully, keeping vigilant for anything else that might be in here with us, but it truly seemed empty. Pure, lonely emptiness. At least it seemed that way until we spotted a tiny spec of color lying far in the distance. It wasn't much, but against the blackness, it stuck out like a flare in the night. It was hard to recognize, but I thought about her so much that I could tell it was her even if I could only see her hair color.

"Bea!" I cried out as I took off running, Alice following behind. Slowly her form grew into view, and I had never been so relieved to see someone in my whole life. She lay sprawled out on the floor as if she hadn't moved since she fell. The hole in her stomach where she had been impaled was still present, leaking a pool of blood around her that had soaked into nearly every inch of her clothes. Her expression was blank and distant as she stared up at the nothingness around her. I called out again as I approached.

"Bea! Bea, oh my gosh, I'm so glad it's you!"

I dropped to my knees next to her with no regard for the blood soaking into my pants, and she weakly turned to me.

"J-Joel?"

"Yeah, Bea, it's me," I said, caressing her face with tears of Joy filling my eyes. "I'm so glad you're alive; I thought I had lost you…"

"Am I… Alive? It's so dark, I can't tell." She muttered. She was clearly out of it as I had been.

"Yes, you are. It's gonna be okay; I'm here now. I'm going to get you out of here."

"Here?" She said, pondering the thought. "I don't know where here is. It's so dark."

My heart ached as I watched her try to form thoughts. I wanted nothing more than to pick her up and carry her out of this place to safety, but I knew that wasn't an option right now. The house still had its hold on her. I wiped the tears from my eyes before speaking again.

"Just hang in there for a little longer, okay, Bea? I'm going to fix this. I-" I stopped myself before I could say it. It was a dangerous word. One I had spoken to too many people before letting them down. Andi. Dan. Ethan. Even if I hadn't said it verbally, it had always been implied.

"I promise we'll go for the exit together."

"I promise I'll find a way to get you out of this room with us."

"I promise I won't let anything happen to you."

I promise.

"I… I'll do my best," I told Bea as I leaned over and placed my lips on her forehead. I suddenly felt a weak arm wrap around my back.

"Joel…" She whispered, "I love you."

My heart froze in my chest, and tears returned to my eyes as I tightly gripped a handful of her hair, not wanting to let go. I knew I had to, though. There was work to be done.

Her kindness. Her selflessness. Bea always made it a point to get a conversation in with everyone in the house at least once a day. Even Larry. She did this to make everyone feel seen. That they were just as important as anyone else. Such a simple act went a long way in keeping everyone grounded. Any time you'd think to yourself, 'what's even the point? I'm a nobody destined to die here,' You always had to remind yourself, 'Bea doesn't think so. She'll be around tomorrow to tell me so.'

One time in a basket drop, we found this small plastic dolphin. Bea ended up with it and slipped it into my pocket when I wasn't paying attention. I found it later, which started a back-and-forth of us secretly putting this toy into the other's possession. Whenever I felt particularly upset or hopeless, I would just randomly check my pocket to see if Bea had made a move. Every time without fail, it was there waiting for me.

Alice and I stepped out of the room but left the door open, just in case Bea had a miracle happen like I did.

"Are you okay?"

"Yeah. I will be. I hate seeing her like that, but knowing she's alright is what really matters."

Alice nodded, and we fell into silence as I prepared myself for things to come. I was free of my room. I knew where Bea was. I knew where to find Daniel. There was only one thing left to do.

"Alice, can I ask one more favor of you? This is the last one. I swear."

She stood up straight and nodded, brushing the hair from her face.

"I need you to go back to the elevator and ride it up to the top. Get back to the saferooms, tell my group that we found the exit, and wait for me there."

"What?" She said, prematurely ending my request. "What are you going to do? Why wouldn't you come with me?"

"Because there's still something I need to do. I think it will set everyone trapped here free."

She looked at me skeptically, concerned, "What are you saying?"

I drew in a deep breath, steadying myself mentally. Once I said it out loud, I knew the gravity of my plan was going to finally set in.

"I... I need to kill the House."
