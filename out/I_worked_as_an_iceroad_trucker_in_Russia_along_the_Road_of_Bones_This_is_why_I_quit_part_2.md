After we had told our stories, I drove on in silence for an hour, only the soft patterning of snow against the truck breaking the monotony. I considered putting on some music, then decided against it. Yakov broke the silence after what felt like a very long time.

“My grandfather died here, you know,” he said. “The M56. He died building it, sent to the Gulags because one of his neighbors had a grudge against him over a land dispute. His neighbor went to the secret police and told them my grandfather was hoarding food and had said Stalin should be killed. Of course, none of that was true, but during those days, a grudge was good enough to guarantee you a death sentence.

“I remember them coming at night, two men in long, black overcoats with bowler hats on their heads, fashionably angled to the left. They barely spoke. My grandfather answered the door, they said a few words, and then he was gone. I was in the kitchen with my grandmother, and by the time I left, I only found an open door and the autumn night outside. I looked around, hoping to see my grandfather just smoking his pipe, or sitting out on the porch. But I never saw him again.

“We never got his body back, and I only found out he died because one of his fellow prisoners ended up surviving. He lived in the same town as me, and when he came back after five years in the Gulags, he told me my grandfather would never return. He told me that he had a message for me- that my grandfather loved me, and would always be with me, and that I should be strong. I cried for a long time.

“The townsman said my grandfather had collapsed one day while working in the winter, his body unable to deal with the constant sub-zero temperatures and starvation anymore. The guard came over, shot him in the head, and then they kept building the road, throwing dirt and stones over his body. Soon, the townsman said, he was buried under the road, next to a dozen other bodies that had died during work that day.

“I think, maybe, that’s why the ghosts called out to me here. I never wanted to work as a driver on this road, but this is the only road leading north to Yakutsk, and I had few job options. Yet knowing I drove over my grandfather’s body every time I drove the truck made me want to… I don’t know, get revenge, or even destroy the road itself. I just don’t know.” He stopped. My heart was racing. I wondered how much he knew about me.

Strangely enough, my grandfather had also been in the Gulags, but not as a prisoner. He had guarded them, and likely shot them and tortured them as well, like all of the guards in that Hellish place. I never knew my grandfather, and he died of a heart attack before I was born. And yet, I shared the same last name, and my parents even said I looked just like him, with gray eyes, high cheekbones and thick, wavy black hair. I had a narrow, angular face and a thin, muscular body, the same build as him as well. I was told we could have been twins. I looked in the rearview mirror, seeing my own face- and the face of my grandfather, like another face glimpsed behind a mask.

I saw headlights approaching behind us. At first, I thought nothing of it, assuming it just another driver on his way to deliver goods. But they drove far too fast for the conditions. With the snow, the rocks and the unstable nature of the road itself, I felt a sense of unease at the dangerous speed at which the driver approached. I changed the subject quickly, not wanting to talk about my family’s past.

“I think we’re being followed,” I said. Yakov spun his head, his eyes widening as he stared at the twin beams behind us.

“They’re going far too fast,” he said- and then I saw it. Ahead of us sat a totaled car, a rusted heap of metal without windows. The front driver’s side looked smashed in, as if it had hit a tree or a large stone. The snow had already filled the interior, covering the seats and upholstery, and I barely saw it in time. I immediately started slowing down, knowing that a truck loaded with this much weight would take much longer than a usual car to stop.

“Someone rolled this out here,” I said. “I think this is an ambush.” Just saying the words made my breath stop. I quickly tried to calculate our odds. I was grateful that I had Yakov, and that he was armed. I reached under my seat and pulled out my P96 pistol. “Do you have any weapons, Yakov?” By now the headlights had gone from pinpricks to dull, moon-like orbs in the snow, and I was rapidly slowing the truck so I wouldn’t hit the car barricaded across the road, trying to keep moving so I wouldn’t slide off the road.

Yakov quickly undid his bulging pack and reached through, looking for something, frowning. Then he smiled, pulling his hand up and showing me a Makarov pistol.

“I thought you said you had a Makarov,” I said. “OK, whatever, I don’t care.” I looked closer at it. It was one of the oldest guns I had ever seen, outside of a museum or a collection. The Makarov came to somewhat of a point near the barrel, narrowing in a curve at the end. It had a wooden handgrip, deeply worn by handling over the decades, and the metal had tarnished and turned a dark color. But as a whole, it still looked like a beautiful gun, and an antique, for sure. I wondered whether it actually fired, this gun from maybe seventy or eighty years ago. I hoped, for our sake, that it did.

The lights had nearly reached us by now, and I had managed to stop the truck fully about thirty feet away from the barricaded car. It was the farthest away I could manage, under the conditions. I wanted room to back up or turn around, or to accelerate and run over bandits if it came to that. I could probably smash the car out of the way of my truck if it were life-or-death- at least, so I hoped at the time. Looking back now all these years later, I realize how naive I was at that moment.

I saw men approaching out of the woods, hooded and covered from head to toe in black. Each had guns. The truck behind us had stopped. I saw a Toyota pickup truck, extremely old and rusted. I saw it had three sets of tires, two in the back- a dually. It looked modified, as many cars in Russia are. Yet with six tires and no load to carry, it could move across the M56 at a speed greater than my own. I certainly couldn’t outrun it unless I shot out one of its tires and slowed them down enough for me to find help. This area was deserted, but there were very small towns of nomads or natives in the region.

Four men got out of the pickup truck, each carrying a rifle. We were hopelessly outmatched here. I wondered if we would die. I doubted it, but really, what did I know about bandits? Perhaps our bones would simply join the hundreds of thousands of others who had died here. Perhaps they, too, would become part of the road.

“Get out!” the man in front screamed at us. Covered in a ski mask, I could only see his eyes, but they looked bleary and unfocused. His gaze kept flicking from us to the woods, then around the area, then returned back to me. I wondered if these men were all drunk. Very likely. If so, it may be easier to fight them off.

I looked over at Yakov, who sat in his seat, trembling slightly, the gun in his hand. He looked at me, and I could see the terror I felt reflected in his eyes.

“Should we fight?” he asked desperately. I had no idea. This had never happened before. I had heard stories, but…

“Get out, now, or we shoot!” the man screamed at us, breaking my thoughts.

“Yes, we must fight,” I said softly, as if the man outside could hear me. “They might kill us. I’m not taking that chance. At least if we fight, we might be able to keep our fates in our hands alone. These men are likely drunk and not very accurate with their guns. We might have the advantage here.” I looked over at the man in front, seeing him raise his gun and aim it at me. I ducked down, and a minute later, a bullet flew through the driver’s side door.

The crack of it shattered the otherwise muffled sounds of the blizzard. I felt cold air rush into the car through the hole. I rolled down my window while still ducking down in my seat, praying to God for help. I saw Yakov ducked down as well, shaking like a leaf, his hands trembling badly.

I sat up quickly, aiming and firing at the man in front. He stood there, his gun pointed down, talking to the other men. The shot hit him in the chest, and he dropped, screaming. I saw splatters of blood in the pure, white snow around him, little islands of red in an eternally white landscape.

Shooting a gun in such a confined space made my ears ring, and for a moment, I could hear nothing. I saw the rest of the men had met in a circle when I shot him, both the ones from the forest and the ones from the pickup truck. It would make it easier to pick them all off, one by one- so I hoped, anyway. I counted seven more men to kill or disable. Yet I hoped that if I killed a few, the rest would flee. They wanted easy targets and quick money, not men with guns who shot back.

They all raised their guns to fire into the truck, swearing at us and yelling for us to surrender or die, when a shrill, ear-splitting sound suddenly came out of the forest. They looked away, their guns still pointed at us, their fingers on the triggers. I heard them babbling to each other in panicked, low voices, then they all began to run in unison back towards their pickup truck. They didn’t even give us a backwards glance, or try to grab the body of their fallen comrade. They ran for their lives, as if they had heard that sound before and knew exactly what it was. I had no idea, however. I thought some strange, Siberian animal would come flying out of the woods, some species I had never seen before. But this seemed far better than a group of armed men.

“Oh, thank God,” I said, “they’re leaving. Now we just need to push this car out of the road, and we can get the hell out of here.” Yakov nodded, still looking nervous, still holding his gun tightly.

“What do you think that was?” he asked. I shrugged, apathetic.

“Probably just an animal,” I said. “These people around here, they’re superstitious. They think the bogeyman is…” But at that moment, I saw not a monster, but a child fleeing out of the woods. It was a little Siberian girl, no more than seven or eight, her facial features a mixture of Asian and white, reminding me of the Buryats I had known, an ethnic minority in the region.

She had a look of pure and utter terror on her face that told me this was no animal chasing her. I quickly opened my door, running out into the freezing winter. Because this was a Japanese truck, the driver’s side was on the right, making me closer to her than Yakov.

“Little girl!” I said. “What are you doing out here in the middle of nowhere? You’ll freeze to death! Were you with those men? Are they your family? Did they kidnap you?” She looked shell-shocked, her eyes widening as she saw me.

“I was kidnapped, yes,” she said. “But not by any man. Please, sir, get me out of here. My twin sister is still back at the hut. She needs help. That thing is going to eat her!” Then she put her face against my chest and cried, “It was the Baba Yaga! She’s real! Please, I don’t want to be eaten!” I grabbed the hysterical, screaming girl by the hand and began to pull her towards the truck. At first, she hesitated, then she began to run ahead of me, flinging herself into the cab and looking back out with huge, dark eyes, like a gopher peeking out of its hole.

That shrill, hateful shrieking from the woods had nearly reached me by this point. I couldn’t make out any words in it. It seemed like just guttural cries of fury and hunger. I began to back up towards the truck, my pistol still raised, refusing to turn my back on anything that sounded like that.

And then I saw the silhouette, breaking through the trees. At first, I thought it a polar bear, this looming shadow that snapped solid branches aside like they were twigs.

But instead, I saw a woman standing over eight-feet-tall with mottled, gray skin and a wrinkled, gaunt face. One of her eyes looked pure white, as if covered in a cataract. Her other had a strikingly pure iris with a deep, large pupil staring out from the middle, roving over the landscape before focusing on me.

Her nose stuck out like a beak, sharp and curving, a few inches long. On her neck, I saw a necklace, holding the fingers of children- dozens of them, some rotted to bones, others fresh and still dripping blood. She saw me, looked at the gun and then at my face, and smiled.

“You don’t need to die, too, friend,” she said in a sickly, choking voice, a trickle of blood coming from her mouth and rolling down her chin as she spoke. “Give me the girl, and you can leave in peace. What’s mine is mine.” I didn’t even respond, but simply fired, aiming at her chest. She fell back, screaming again, and I turned and ran towards the truck, slamming the door and starting the engine. The pickup truck had gone, and I couldn’t even see its lights in the distance anymore. I started to go forwards, slowly pushing the car aside with my truck. Yet I couldn’t get it to budge more than a few inches as it seemed to sink down into the snow. I tried reversing, but I couldn’t get the momentum on the slippery ice, as the road sloped downwards at an angle towards the right side. I didn’t have enough clearance to try going forwards, either.

I was stuck. To make things worse, I looked outside the window- and saw the Baba Yaga was gone. Only a small puddle of black blood marked the spot where she had lain.
