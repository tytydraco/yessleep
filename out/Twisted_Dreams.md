When you’re a kid living in a small town most of the time you are looking to plan your escape. This might not be the case in some small towns that are located stone’s throw away from a bigger city but for me that was never the case. I was born in a small town in the Midwest and while a lot of people had creature comforts like Wal-Mart or even a Starbucks on every corner, we barely had any of that. The nearest big chain store was around thirty miles from our front door which meant planning our trips to supplement what we grew on our farm.

For some farm life isn’t grand but I didn’t mind it as much as I got up early, did my chores, went to school and came home just to do it all over again. Now don’t get me wrong as my childhood was not horrible as I didn’t have ogres for parents and lived in a shoe box. I lived on a moderately successful farm, had loving parents and even made friends in school and around town. There were some parts of my childhood I can remember as clear as day such as going on long summer bike rides with my friends to the pond or spending nights outside looking up at the stars.

Those memories are like the places as they are gone as the farm was sold off to give our family a better life and friends moved out of that small town to pursue fortune and fame. Eventually I struck out on my own leaving my parents behind and finding out through a call from the local sheriff that they had both passed. Thoughts of not returning home for the funeral did cross my mind however, I was an only child and there were affairs that needed to be put right. Once all of that was done part of me could not leave that town fast enough as I wanted to flee back to my home in upstate New York. Why?

Tornados.

Twisters, tempests, hurricanes whatever you want to call these natural disasters were the bane of my existence when I was younger. Part of me wondered anytime the siren rolled across the plains if it would be my last night on this earth. Hell, there were times all I could think about were my parents dying horribly and leaving me an orphan. Anytime a tornado hit near our area we would hunker down in our storm shelter until we had gotten all clear. Fortunately, the twisters never even came close to our town as they seemed to strike cities and towns all around our state.

Recently I could not get a good night’s sleep and at first, I chalked it up to just nerves as there were a lot of projects with tight deadlines going on at work. However, once my workload decreased variations of the same nightmare plagued me night after night. I could be an adult, child or anywhere in between either with my parents, strangers or even by myself in a home that was both alien and familiar to me. Without warning that dreaded sound would fill my ears until it threatened to split my skull wide open.

The mournful wail of a tornado siren.

I tried to counteract the lack of sleep with sugar, caffeine, or a combination of the two however, it was to no avail. During moments of downtime, I could feel my eyelids draw heavy and was even starting to nod off in meetings. It did not take long for my boss to notice, and he pulled me in for a private meeting asking me what was going on as he seemed genuinely concerned. At first, I was ashamed to admit it as he asked if it was a problem with drugs or alcohol.

“Nothing like that sir, just been having trouble sleeping. Always seem to have a similar dream night after night.”

He nodded, typing away at the computer as he smiled at me. “You have been an amazing asset to this company for years. You are always on time, you put in long hours to get projects accomplished and have accrued a bit of sick and personal time. I want to send you to a psychiatrist that I have used from time to time, and the company will gladly pick up the bill.”

How could I say no?

He made the arrangements and told me that my first session would start tomorrow and sent me home after our meeting. After another night of fitful sleep and a stiff cup of morning coffee I made my way to their office. They were in a lavish business park that was home to a few medium sized companies and a non-descript office with just the number on the door. Making my way inside I was nervous as the receptionist asked for my name and then instructed me to have a seat. This brought up memories of having to sit in the principal’s office when I was a child. Eventually, an older woman dressed in a conservative suit opened the door, greeted me, and asked me into her office.

“Now I want to make one thing perfectly clear” she said in a tone that reminded me of my late grandmother which was cool and soothing. “This is a safe space. Anything that you say here will not be repeated as it will stay within the confines of these walls.”

The first three sessions were spent exploring my past along with my childhood as the standard questions were asked. Did you have a happy childhood? Were you well liked in school? What did your parents think of you? These sessions seemed to go nowhere as the nightmares were getting progressively worse and the quality of sleep seemed to be degrading.

“I want to try something in this session if you are up for it. Have you heard of hypnotherapy?”

She explained the process as she would be able to put me into a hypnotic state to probe deeper into what was troubling me. What did I have to lose other than more sleep. I told her that I would be willing to do this and the rest of this is an audio transcription of what happened.

Therapist: “You are now in a relaxed state can you hear me?”

Patient: “Yes, I can hear you.”

T: “OK, I want you to think back to you were around twelve years old. Think back to that time in your life. Where are you now?”

P: “I.. I am in my room. Wow the PlayStation 2 is amazing and GTA 3 is an awesome game! Better than that dumb ‘ol X-Box that Nathan has and who cares about Halo?”

T: “Very good and this is in your hometown of \[REDACTED\]”

P: “Yeah in fact I am lookin’ out of my window and seeing the fields of corn we’ve planted. Seems like we’re gonna have to harvest that soon.”

T: “As you look outside you noticed that the skies are darkening and without warning you hear the wail of a tornado siren.”

P: \*panicked breathing\* “M-mom? Dad? We need to get down to the storm shelter!”

T: “You make your way down into the basement and then into the sub-basement into a smaller room that’s stocked with provisions, blankets and a crank radio. You and your family are safe.”

P: \*breathing slows down\* “Phew! That was a close call is everyone OK?”

T: “The radio blares to life as the announcer comes back with warnings for various counties. You notice that your county isn’t listed, and the only mention is a county with a town that’s at least 100 miles from yours.”

P: “That’s really good news isn’t it dad?”

T: “It sure is son. An hour passes until you get an all clear from the radio. You make your way outside and see that there wasn’t even any damage to the house, livestock or crops.”

P: “Awesome! Do I have enough time to play some video games before dinner mom?”

T: “Have you forgotten? It’s summer vacation you can do whatever you want.”

P: “Oh that’s right! Tomorrow I am going to ride my bike around the neighborhood and go fishing!”

T: “After a night of playing video games you get up nice and early and head out on your bike. What do you see?”

P: “I am pedaling down the drive of my house and there’s something at the end of the drive. It’s.. it’s a dog.”

T: “A dog?”

P: “Y-Yeah this white mutt of a dog that belongs to Mr. Campbell a mean ol’ man that lives two farms over. He would let out his dog every day and it would terrorize the kids that lived around here. I can hear him growling.”

T: “The dog doesn’t notice you in fact it spots something in the tall grass and chases after it leaving you alone with nothing else around you.”

P: “I spent most of the morning and into the early afternoon visiting with friends, hanging out at the local diner and just taking in being on summer vacation. Eventually, I make my way out of town to my favorite fishin’ hole as I get off my bike and set up my pole.”

T: “The summer heat isn’t unbearable as you settle in as you cast your pole into the water. You spend hours as you relax and let your mind drift away. The sounds of the local wildlife a nice background track for this perfect day.”

P: “This is so relaxing.. I feel.. like.. oh.. no.”

T: “What happened?”

P: “I.. I slept! The sun is starting to dip low behind the trees! Mom and dad are gonna be cross with me if I don’t get home before dark! Wait.. there’s a shortcut that my friend Dave told me about. It’ll get me home quicker!”

T: “So you’re on the shortcut tell us about it.”

P: “Damn you, Dave! It was only good for around 3 miles and it dead ends at a cornfield. Crap! I need to get home!”

T: “Is there a path between the rows?”

P: “Yeah! I can just walk my bike through the corn. Whose farm is this? There’s not supposed to be a farm out this way I thought?”

T: “OK so you’re walking your bike along do you see or hear anything?”

P: “… yeah. Something weird. I have no idea what that is I make my way over towards the sounds. It sounds like… people talking?”

T: “Can you see anything out of the ordinary?”

P: “I see smoke wafting from a top of the corn stalks? And voices.. but.. they’re not panicked and there’s some type of rhythm to it? What in the heck is going on? I need to get home so onward I go.”

T: “So you’re following the path?”

P: “W.. what is this? I see a clearing there is a fire burning an.. oh god.. there’s an altar of stone in the middle of a circular part of this field. The dog .. Mr. Campbell’s dog is strapped to it and all cut open.. oh my god I am gonna be sick. There’s so much blood!”

T: “Calm down. What else do you see?”

P: “P-People.. dressed in grey robes. They’re chanting something but I can’t make it out. They are .. what.. I .. I know these people! There’s Mr. and Mrs. Andrews they own the local diner! And there’s Mr. Cooper he owns the hardware store! And…. “

T: “What is it? What else do you see?”

P: “Dad?!? What’s going on?! What do you mean!? There’s a wind picking up and the skies are darkening. What are you doing dad?!”

T: “Please calm down. What is going on? Tell me what you see?”

P: “The skies are dark grey! There’s something.. something like a dust devil that’s forming right on top of us! It.. it picked up and shredded the dog! The blood isn’t going all over it’s.. what.. what the hell..”

T: “What? What is it?”

P: “This dust devil… it’s looking at me. Like the blood has given it two glowing red eyes and a gaping mouth. My dad is .. saying something to me as he is holding my head.”

T: “What is he saying?”

P: “\*deeper voice\* FORGET ALL THAT YOU SAW HERE. NOTHING HAPPENED. YOU WILL REMEMBER NOTHING.”

T: “O-ok.. when I clap my hands and count to three you will be awake and refreshed.. 1.. 2.. 3.. \*CLAP”



My therapist explained to me that it was some sort of repressed memory and while I tried to comprehend why I could not remember he cited it could be related to trauma. When I asked him about the incident in the corn field he shrugged and rattled off a few explanations such as a fever dream or some sort of imaginary event that I remembered instead.

I knew that wasn’t true.

After that last session I started to sleep more soundly as the nightmares seemed to vanish overnight. The next morning, I awoke refreshed and with a newfound energy and it showed in my performance at work. Deadlines were met, productivity increased, and it showed in my performance and attitude at work and my boss was impressed by how quickly I turned things around.

But that’s not the reason why I am so scared.

The thing that scares me right now is that I live in upstate New York, and it is dusk now and there’s not even a cloud in the sky. And the sound that I hear in the distance sends a cold shiver down my spine.

Because it is the mournful wail of a tornado siren.
