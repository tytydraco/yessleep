He awoke in darkness.

Not metaphorical, not dreamy. Real, suffocating dark. No sound, no breath, no body. Just the crush of silence and pressure and someone wearing him.

He screamed, or tried to. No voice. No throat. No lungs. Only thought, raw and panicked, echoing inside this new cold prison of his that he couldn’t yet comprehend.

Then came movement, a gentle, swaying movement. A warmth against him. A skin, a skin he knew.

Lena.

And like a flood, it all returned: the crash, the blood, the twisted metal. His wife’s voice, faint and terrified. Then black.

Now, this.

A wedding ring.

He was in the ring. Not on it, not around it. In it. His mind, or soul, or whatever was left of him, embedded in the thin gold band he’d slid onto her finger five years ago beneath the soft arch of a dying cherry tree.

He tried to make sense of it, tried to scream again. He could feel her pulse when her hand brushed her hair. Hear muffled echoes when she tapped the sink. Every time her hand clenched, when she cried, when she slept, he felt it.

Days passed. Maybe weeks. Time was strange here. All he had were moments of motion, pressure, heat. Her sadness enveloped him like a shroud. She barely spoke. When she did, it was to him, or at least to the idea of him.

Then one day, he felt a rapid pulse within her heart. Not like before, not grief, not heartbreak. This was different. Wild. Scattered. Terrified.

A stranger forced his way into her house, and as she fled the man pointed a gun at her.

No warning, no sound beyond the sudden crash of splintering wood. She ran. Barefoot, breath ragged, every instinct screaming. But he was fast. He caught up in the hallway, raised a gun, and aimed it at her chest.

Her body froze. Her heart did not.

It thundered.

In that instant, Evan summoned every ounce of power left within him to protect her, and though it defied her will, the ring on her hand twisted the bullet's path midair, sending it ricocheting back into the gunman, killing him instantly.

The silence after the shot was suffocating.

The man's body slumped to the floor in a heap of blood and broken breath. His eyes, still wide with disbelief, stared past Lena as if trying to see the force that had turned death back on him.

She stared too, at her hand. At the ring. At Evan. The ring had shattered into splinters of gold and diamond.

Unfortunately, Evan was hit with a wave of agony that tore through his formless existence, an unbearable, insufferable pain that gnawed at whatever was left of him, as if his very soul was being consumed from the inside out.

Convinced that her husband still lingered within the ring, she decided to keep the fragments of him, enclosing it in a beautiful glass jar.

Day after day, she cradled the glass jar in her arms, gently rocking it as if comforting a child. She sang soft lullabies and spoke to him constantly, her voice filled with tenderness, as though he could still hear her. And he could—he heard every word. But each moment was an unbearable torment, as if his very soul was being scorched, every second a searing agony that felt like an eternity in Hell.

One day, as the suffocating agony threatened to tear him apart, Evan gathered every ounce of strength left within him. In a desperate attempt to escape the endless torment, he pushed against the confines of the glass, willing it to move. With a sudden surge of force, the jar tipped from its stand and crashed to the floor, shattering into a thousand jagged pieces.

When his wife saw the shattered remnants of the ring scattered across the floor, surrounded by jagged shards of glass, her breath caught in her throat. Horror gripped her as she rushed to the broken pieces, her hands trembling as if her husband himself had been torn apart. She scooped up the fragments, desperate, as if by some miracle, she could piece him back together, terrified that this time, she had lost him for good.

She crouched down to the floor, straining to catch any sound, any trace of his voice in the stillness. Her heart raced, hoping for a whisper, a sign from him. Then, through the silence, his voice broke the quiet with a desperate plea: "Burn me to ashes! Please, let it end!" His words were filled with intense pain, it was a raw cry begging from his guts. The intensity of his plea left her terrified and deeply saddened, her heart aching with the weight of his inhumane torment. Overwhelmed by grief, pain and helplessness, she set the house on fire and decided to let herself burn with the house to be reunited with her husband.
