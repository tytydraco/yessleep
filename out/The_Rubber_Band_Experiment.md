The following is the first hand account of patient J, aged thirteen, surrendered for failure to obey parents and negative affect.  The experiment took place on November twenty first, two thousand and twenty three.  The experiment took just under an hour to be completed in full.  J is the first subject to complete the experiment.  Clean up took another two hours, which included J's participation.  The experiment was supervised by the clinic director.  The following account shall not be released without explicit approval.  
…  
I was sat next to K, who looked as hungry as me.  I think K was around my age.  He looked like it, but kind of big too.  I don’t know.  I didn’t get to talk to him.  Or anyone really.  Not since I got here.  
She sat on the other side of the room with a clipboard.  An older woman with her hair in a bun and glasses.  I didn’t like her.  Seeing her was never a good thing.  An orderly brought out two bags of rubber bands and placed them on my lap.  Taking a few from the bag, she began attaching K to his chair.  Two rubber bands around the wrists and ankles, then more to secure him.  K didn’t make a sound although his face wasn’t hiding his fear.  The orderly then stood behind us, silent.  
The woman sighed as if we had already disappointed her.  “You, the blond one.  What’s your name?”  
“Jack,” I responded.  
“Put a rubber band on the other.”  
“Huh?”  
She leaned forward.  “Put a rubber band on the other one’s head.  Under the eyes, on the bridge of the nose.”  
I turned to K, who shook his head slightly  “Please,” he whispered.  
“Why?” I fired back at the woman.  
She sneered.  “Because I told you to.”  
“I’m not going to do anything to hurt him.”  My hands began to twitch the way they usually did when I felt anxious.    
“Would you have me switch the roles?”  She looked bored.  I wasn’t doing the experiment right.  
“No,” I said softly, shifting in my seat.  
“Then put one over his face.”  
“I’m sorry,” I whispered, sliding a band over his shaved head onto the bridge of his nose.  It was a big rubber band but still looked uncomfortable.  He closed his eyes.    
The woman leaned forward.  “What did your parents call you?”  She was looking at K, not me.  But I knew who she was talking to.  
“Um, I don’t understand.”    
She lifted her eyes to me, surveying me as though she could have me for dinner.  “What names did they call you?”  
“I don’t know.  Dumbass?  Stupid?  Those kinds of things.”  
She waved her hand.  “Another rubber band.”  
I took a breath and stretched another band over his head.  K started to cry quietly.  
She smiled.  “Were they right?”  
“My parents?”  
“Yes.”  She sat back in her chair.  
“Probably.  I’ve done a lot of stupid things.”  
“Another rubber band then.”  
I took one out but hesitated.  “Can I ask, what are you doing to him?”  
She raised an eyebrow.  “I’m not doing anything to him.  You are.”  
I frowned and added the third band.  The bands began to make a mark on K’s face.  
“Did your parents love you?”  
“Maybe when I was little.  Not now.  Not after sending me here.”    
She nodded at me, wordlessly giving me another instruction.  I did it again.  K looked like he was in pain.  
“Where did they say you were going?”  
“Military school.”  
Another nod.  Another rubber band.  
“Would you like to be with them again?”  
My breath stopped.  “Yes,” I blurted out.  
She nodded.  I did as I was told.  Tears flowed down his face now.  
“I can do that for you.  I can reunite you.  But you have to see this through.  You have to finish what you started.”  
K whispered, “Jack, please.  She’s not going to let you out.  She’s not going to do what she-”  
“Patient K, I have not given you permission to speak.”  A sinister grin flashed on her face.  “But I will respond.  I don’t lie.  I may do many things, but I never lie.  If you do as I say, as you have been doing, you will see your parents today.”  
Something like hope filled my chest.  Maybe I would get to go home.  Maybe I would be able to live a normal life again.  
“What do I have to do?”  
She flicked some hair out of her eyes.  “You have to fit all two hundred rubber bands on his head, in the same position.  If he’s alive at the end, you can take them all off.”  
“And if he isn’t?”  
She shrugged.  “Not much use in taking them off then.”  
I remembered back before I got to the Institute seeing a video on Youtube of someone putting a bunch of rubber bands on a watermelon.  I don’t remember how many they used, but eventually the melon exploded.  I raised my eyes to K’s.  Was he thinking the same thing?  
I hesitated too long and she nodded at the orderly.  The orderly produced a remote from her uniform.  She pressed a button and the wall in front of me lit up with a projector.  
It was my parents, sitting in a room that could only be in the Institute.  I heard my mom’s voice for only a moment.  “Is…is he here?  Does he want to see us?”  And the projection ended.    
My mother looked so big on that white wall.  She wore a jacket and hat - it must have been winter.  Seasons come and go without change in here.  My dad looked regretful standing behind her.  They were real for just a minute.  And then gone.  How many years had it been?  Would they recognize me?  
She smiled coyly.  “I gave you a preview.  Would you like the real thing?”  
I clutched the bag and looked at K.  His head drooped.  He knew what I was going to do.  We both did.  
And I did it.  
One by one I got to the task of wrapping his head.  Each rubberband gripped his skull.  The skin and tissue of his head began to bulge.  His eyes grew too big for his sockets.  At first he whispered “No” in a small voice.  As the bands kept being added his voice grew louder.  His no’s were cries.  The tears covered his red skin.  His nose began to buckle.  After a hundred were used I heard the distinct crack of his nose as it broke.  Blood gushed into his mouth.  I had to wipe his blood off of my hands on my scrubs.  He tugged against the registrants.  But if I’m being honest…he didn’t fight enough.  He could have broken free.  Maybe he was acting or putting on a show.  For me or for her, I don’t know.  I wonder if he wanted a way out of this place.  Or maybe I am thinking all of this to forgive myself for what I did.  Guilt is a heavy chain.  
I didn’t stop when his nose broke.  It got easier as I built up a rhythm.  His skin split and bled.  Blood even started dripping from his ears.  I heard noises from inside his skull, or maybe it was the skull itself.  It was trying so hard to stay intact.  It was resisting even if K wasn’t.  But like anything fragile, it eventually gave way.  K’s head burst like the melon had.  Bits of brain and skull and viscera splattered me and the room.  None landed near her.  Not even gore was brave enough to touch her.    
A slice of K found its way between my teeth.  I can still taste the copper death in my mouth.  
“There,” I yelled, raising my hands above my head.  “I did what you wanted.  I fucking did it.”  I fell to my knees.  Brain and skull scrambled under my weight.  “Let me go now.  Please, let me go.”  
K’s lifeless body gurgled.  
She stood up as if the whole thing was underwhelming.  “Play him the rest.”  
I didn’t bother to look at the orderly as she took out the remote.  My parents were back on the wall, larger than life.  “Is…is he here?  Does he want to see us?”  
“Yes,” I whispered.    
“I don’t want him anywhere near us,” my mother said, putting a hand out to my father.  “That kid is nothing but trouble.  He’s the kind of monster that would kill a person just to get his way.  You keep him locked up in this place and I never want to hear about him again.”  
“No calls, no letters.  He might as well be dead to us,” my dad added.  “We’re leaving now and going to forget that him and this whole place ever existed.”  
I watched as my parents left the room and the door closed.  Whoever was filming took a little breath before turning it off.  
I felt nothing.  Or everything.  I don’t know.  It doesn’t matter.  
She didn’t lie.  I saw my parents.  I saw them and what they really thought of me.  
I wasn’t asked to clean up but I did anyway.  It felt right.  I had caused this and I should be responsible for it.  I picked up every single piece of K’s head.  It felt like it took forever.  But the numbness lasted longer.  It was stronger than the guilt, shame, or even sadness.  The numbness looked like the tears and blood mixing on K’s face.  I don’t even know the kid’s real name.  No one would know, not now.  
I don't know how long I was stuck in my room after the experiment.  They didn’t lock me in.  I could have left, gone to eat or looked in at the others.  But I stayed.  They brought me bread and I ate it, even though it tasted like copper.  I slept when I had to.  I talked to no one until they brought me this report.  
They told me to write down what happened and how I felt.  So I did.  It wasn’t until I started writing it down did the feelings start to come back.  The fear.  The anger.     
Not at [the Institute.](https://www.reddit.com/r/EZmisery/comments/181f8r9/the_institute_collection/)  I can’t blame it or Dr. Wrom for asking me to do what I was already prepared to do.  I can only blame myself.
