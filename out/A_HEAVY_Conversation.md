This was a conversation between two dominant people who we all know.
The content was caught on tape by a wire tap. It was inserted into the room that the conversation took place in. 
 
   The room is very small to make the setting intimate. One steel table welded to
The floor. Two steel chairs one welded one not.
One dim light in the middle of the table. Four walls painted dull grey no windows or outside light.

This  conversation reveals very important and sensitive information. 

Person 1 is here blind folded from a maximum security facility. But will be unmasked when the conversation starts. 

Person 2 is a part of the cause to help fight crime. This takes place in a undisclosed location deep underground. This has been pulled from the ears of the public for both parties protection. The contents on the tape goes as follows.

Person 1 : Finally were here me and you. I’ve waited for this moment for a long time.
I can smell the rage, smell the hate and sense the pain. It’s euphoric to my senses.

   (Threw a deep whisper) Person 2 : Stop playing games, you went threw all this trouble to get me down here. What the HELL do you want, you sick twisted maniac. 

(In a hearty laugh) 
Person 1 : Always the big brave hero. I know what drives you, I know what makes you tick, I know why you cannot sleep. I know why you love the dark.

Person 2 reaches across the table and punches person 1 so hard you can hear bones crack on the recording.


Person 1 blows the blood from his nose and laughs and says :

Awww that’s more like it. Blood bullets and wrath of GOD. Come on one more punch. This time Give me a Displaced jawline.


Person 2 : if you don’t stop wasting my time, I’m gonna 
Rip out the top of your mouth and Snap your neck. 

Person 1 : Yes Yes Yes the rage,  it’s only in the face of danger that we know who we truly are. 

Person 2 brings his arm around the small table and punches his knee and dislocates it. The snap was loud, it was sick. Person 2 begins to breathe heavy and growl.

Person 1: Oooo that’s it, I love when you break the rules. See me and you aren’t so different. You love to inflict pain the same as I do. But I can admit it. See how excited you or now that you know I’m hurting. And the fact that it was you that caused it. Makes your heart rate go up makes your, blood boil, it takes you to a pain driven paradise.


Person 2 screams : WE OR NOT THE SAME. 

In rage person 2 reaches out and grabs person 1’s arm with both hands and pops his shoulder out of place. Person 1’s arm is know dangling as he laughs and winches in pain.


Person 1 : The Dark Knight strikes again. A spoiled rich boy wit a pre-disposition for pain. They never found out who killed your parents did they.


Person 2 stares with intense eyes threw his mask. And says:

Stop telling me what I already know. Start making sense know.


Person 1 laughs while poking his now dangling arm with his finger
And says :

Bruce I have cancer. I am set to die In six months. My whole crime career, I made crime a literal joke even pain is funny. But hear this, the night your parents where shot, You said the perpetrator had a slight limp in his left leg. The police report says they found white hairs at the crime scene.


Well let’s examine, who do you know that has had white hair this whole time and has a slight limp if you pay attention close. 

Person 2 : It can’t be no, Not

Person 1 : Your lovely Alfred.

Person 2  Vomits all over the table and his black suit. The room won’t stop spinning. His eyes or full of rage , blood shot he doesn’t want to believe it. 

Person 1 continues : Alfred and your father were best friends but a women can cause wars. Alfred was engaged to your mother but
Your father Mr. Wayne being the billionaire business man play boy, had to have here. Alfred wasn’t as nearly as rich as your father. So there was party at the Wayne mansion. Of course he gets Alfred to invite his wife. 


Your father flaunts his wealth in ways you wouldn’t believe. As the saying goes everyone has there price. 
He woes her behind Alfred’s back. They begin sleeping with each other. Alfred was to busy and tired to realize his wife was weary of him. Between the long ours and heavy task your father gave him. 


So he finally convinces here to leave him. Well your father promised Alfred a life long job with no risk of being fired with double his salary and know he can live at the mansion and have access to anything he wanted. Your mother left Alfred and married your father.


Person 2 : Get to the fucking point Asshole.


Person 1 : Awww patience O Dark One. So they got married within two months. But what old Mr. Wayne didn’t know was His new wife was three months pregnant. She hid it for as long as she could. But she was torn because around the time she conceived, even though Alfred was tired he would make love to his wife from time to time. Mr. Wayne would do it to. 

  So when she tells Mr. Wayne he loses it. He slaps her,roughs her up a little. Alfred heard the whole ordeal. Well He tries to take here to a abortion clinic by the time he does it’s to late. So when the baby comes, good old Mr. Wayne has an adoption crew on stand by. 
They did a in home birth so no one knew but is home servants. 

Also in the stages of her pregnancy when she started to Show. He hid her inside that mansion for 7 months. She didn’t even get to hold her baby. When she gave birth, Mr. Wayne had specific instructions for the doctor. He said take the baby wrap it up and give it to the adoption parents and see them off quickly. They didn’t even wash it off.

 Well  just so happen the adopting parents where teachers. But the parents were very abusive. They would starve the child. Beat him and put all kinds of unidentified pills in his food. 
It made him laugh a lot. The lines between insanity and reality blurred. 

Bruce this child followed you your whole life. When you where in grade school all the way threw. Know this is how we relate. After Mr. Wayne thought the smoke had cleared he made a son of his own. Alfred stayed by playing the part of a good servant and best friend to Mr. Wayne, all the time plotting his revenge. It took 12 years. 


He finally found the right time. Your father thought he was untouchable, why would a billionaire who has shady dealings, walk his family through an alley late at night after a show. Instead of having the car pulled to the front. They would still be alive if your father wasn’t so prideful.


So Alfred waited till they left. Dress hisself as a street thug caught a cab and waited in that alley. The pistol he used was a six shooter. He sat in that dark alley for 2 hours waiting and when your family to came out he let you guys get half way and you know the rest.


Alfred started putting medicine in your food to make you have Hallucinations. He knew you were afraid of the dark. Why do you think he never put lights on in that big mansion at night and made you sleep in the pitch black dark.  Do you know what that stuff does to a 12 year old mind. You start to build fantasy’s and see things that aren’t there. So the bats you saw when you fell in a hole and had to be hospitalized. Was actually caused by you slipping on a wet floor in that dark house and hitting your head on the edge of a big wooden table. 


So know you think bats or apart of you. As far as the kid he grew up troubled. He was thrown in a insane asylum at 13 for killing his parents. For making him drink cleaning products to get him to sleep. But Mr. Wayne’s  wife some how tracked him down for a DNA test. She  used your fathers toothbrush and had the boy swabbed for his spit. When the results came back she couldn’t look.She just left the paper with the boy in the mental institution. 


Person 1 takes his good arm reaches in his pocket and takes out a old dirty yellow paper. 

Person 2 reads it and starts to cry.


Person 1 : I thought it would be a cold day in hell before I saw a big black bat cry.


Person 1 : Hello brother this is why we or the same we or alike. You can’t kill me because apart of you would die also and you can feel it.
We both or connected not only by blood but by pain.


Person 1: THIS IS A HEAVY CONVERSATION

Person 2 walks behind person 1 and puts his hands around persons one head and snaps his neck.

Person 2 tells the facility burn the body and any evidence that person 1 ever existed. 

Person 2 goes back to his family mansion. Kills the butler and stuffs him in the furnace and burns the mansion down and disappears.


6 month later we received a very disturbing letter from person 2.

To: whom it may concern


My life is a lie, I have nothing to live for or be proud of. My family fortune was stolen from honest hard working people. I fought in the dark, to shield the enjoyment on my face when I caused pain to criminals. inflicting pain and fear. I have exiled myself to a undisclosed location and after going back and viewing my life. It suddenly became uncontrollably funny. I cannot stop laughing.

THIS WAS A HEAVY CONVERSATION
