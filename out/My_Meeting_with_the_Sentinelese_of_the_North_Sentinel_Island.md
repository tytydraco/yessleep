I’ve always been drawn to the places no one wants to go. Not for the thrill, but for the mystery. The unknown. While most adventurers stick to mountains or ruins, I sought out what the maps warned you about.

My earliest adventures took me through forgotten caves, the core zones of protected national parks, and abandoned villages where silence screamed stories. Each place whispered secrets, but I craved louder voices from the unknown.

That’s when Africa called me. The Sahara. A desert that stretches beyond imagination. It wasn’t just the heat or the emptiness that fascinated me—it was the solitude of the people living within it, isolated and indifferent to modern noise.

From there, the pull shifted to the Amazon. The lungs of the Earth, they called it. But to me, it was a heart—pulsing, ancient, and alive. I hired a local guide, a quiet man who claimed his village had ties with an uncontacted tribe deep within the rainforest. Miraculously, we were welcomed—no arrows, no fear. I suspect money changed hands behind the scenes, but I didn’t ask. I watched, listened, learned.

Their culture was untouched by screens and concrete. Their tools were bones and vines. Even their games felt like echoes from a time we’d forgotten. I remember sitting by their fire, watching children laugh with nothing but painted stones in their hands. It made the city feel like a simulation.

And that’s when it hit me—I needed more. Not just more tribes, but more truth. Something deeper, something hidden. Something... otherworldly.

I started reading about the Sentinelese. A tribe living on North Sentinel Island in the Bay of Bengal, fiercely protected and untouched by outsiders. No one really knew their language, their beliefs—or even what they looked like up close. Every attempt to contact them had ended in violence. The Indian government declared the island off-limits. Even satellites seemed to give the place a respectful distance.

Which, to me, only meant one thing: I had to go there.

I contacted some fishermen who worked around that area, but most refused. I inflated the amount of money I would give to anyone who helped me trespass the government’s naval patrols. Luckily, one man agreed. His eyes were faintly green, his hair undone, with an overgrown beard and moustache—and the constant smell of fish clinging to him.

His English was fluent, to my surprise, and he spoke to tourists and locals alike in their native tongues. A French man. A Spanish girl. Even a Mexican woman. That, to me, was oddly unsettling.

Before I could ask, he muttered, **“You’re wondering how I know all these languages, aren’t you?”**

He asked as if he’d read my mind.

Still curious, I responded, “Yes.”

**“In all these years of relentless fishing and trading, alongside guiding foreigners through their trails around here, I’ve not just learned foreign languages—I’ve lived them. Money talks, you know. It’s not me talking. It’s the money.”**

“Oh! Yeah… Understandable,” I replied, still unconvinced.

He took me to the secluded island on a battered motorboat, its surface cracked. By the time we arrived, it was already past 11 PM IST—just as we’d planned. I wanted to arrive at night since the chances of encountering the Sentinelese were slim. He knew the routes well and had warned me of possible naval interventions. When I asked “How do you bypass them?”, he replied with a smirk, “Money talks,” and laughed like a maniac.

Luckily, we weren't caught. All thanks to his masterful knowledge of the area. Before leaving, he handed me a revolver. I didn’t ask for it, but he said, **“Just in case,”** and demanded another 15,000 Indian rupees. He then disappeared—not just from the boat, but from sight entirely. I watched him walk toward the sea, and then… he was gone.

I didn’t think much of it. I continued inland.

It was nighttime. No, I wasn’t foolish to come at night—if I’d come in daylight, the tribe might’ve ripped me apart.

With caution, I moved ahead, gun in one hand and phone in the other. No signal, of course.

My only source of light was the flashlight on my phone. Looking up, I noticed the stars—they were bright, twinkling in perfect unison, as if programmed.

While walking into the woods, my right foot struck something metallic. Curiosity got the better of me, and I turned the flashlight toward it. A strange-looking box with an unusual mechanism. Tiny, but engraved with strange symbols. I slipped it into my pocket and moved on.

As I approached what I assumed was their colony, I was shocked. There was no one—just silence, and an eerie hum, with only the chirping of insects breaking the void. I expected palm huts, maybe someone sleeping outside, but nothing.

I sat on the soft, white sand, wondering if the fisherman had fooled me. Perhaps this wasn’t even the right island. His “Money talks” still echoed in my ears.

Then I heard it—a noise. Sand a few meters away began to rise, slowly erupting upward. My breath caught. My first thought? A creature. Some kind of monstrous island-native. I ducked behind two massive palm trees.

And then… they emerged.

One after another, they rose—stretching their hands, twisting their necks, and levitating. Not just levitating—swimming through the air. Like eerie mermaids that floated instead of swam.

I saw the small boxes again—dozens of them. Some of the beings shifted into those boxes. Startled, I threw away the one I’d picked up earlier.

My heart thundered. I couldn’t process what I was seeing. Moments later, I fainted.

When I opened my eyes, they had circled me. They spoke in hushed tones, voices that chilled my spine.

While they whispered, I noticed more of those boxes around, glowing, emitting sharp lasers from which more of their kind emerged.

I pleaded with them. They grinned, their eyes sliding out of their sockets. Glowing green light filled the hollow spaces. I still don’t know how I survived what came next.

They tied me to a metal pole that rose from the sand—cold, almost unnaturally so. Then they attacked me with crystals that shot from their eyes. The crystals struck like needles. I still carry the scars. The pain was sharp, like a thousand ant bites at once. Eventually, I passed out again.

When I woke up, the fisherman was beside me—holding a cracked coconut.

**“Drink it.”**

I lunged at it and drank every drop.

He’d arrived in a small ferry. I was still in shock. I knew no one would believe me. The stings still ached, but I tried to hide it—even from him.

Later, as I stood near the ferry railing, gazing into the turquoise water—still shaking, still looking back to make sure no one followed—I noticed my reflection.

My eyes gleamed green.

Next to mine, I saw another reflection—his.

**“Welcome to the club,”** he said, laughing like a maniac again.

I still carry those eyes.
The wounds.
The memories.

I don’t go out without goggles anymore.
And I move from place to place… so they can’t find me.

It's midnight, And I typed all this **"Lavitating"**
