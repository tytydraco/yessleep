You won’t find anything about this in the news. No police reports, no missing persons lists, no footage. I’ve checked. I’ve tried. But I know what I saw. I lived through it. And I don’t care if you believe me or not-I just want this story to exist somewhere. I need someone to know what happened that night. Because I don’t think I should’ve made it out. And I don’t think I was supposed to.

Last year, I visited my girlfriend for the weekend. She lived about two hours north of me, so we didn’t get to spend time together every day, but I still made an effort to dedicate as much time as I could to her. I’m not sure I should say where I live. For the sake of anonymity, I’ll just tell you that the terrain around here is varied. Some parts are dry chaparral, while others are dense woods.

It was dark that Sunday night, and I was in a horrible mood. We’d gone to see a movie, and it ended up running far later than I intended. I had to be up early the next day for work, and Google Maps was telling me I wouldn’t be getting home anytime soon.

I didn’t know it yet, but a plane had lost function during a flight that day and did an emergency landing on an adjacent highway. The traffic backup was massive. My normally two-hour drive more than doubled.

Then I got a notification-an alert for a shorter route. Frustrated and desperate, I followed the directions and peeled off the highway. My phone took me down roads I’d never seen before. I wound through long, narrow streets until I found the main route the app suggested. I wanted to cry in frustration-it was just as bad as the highway had been, only now it was a single-lane road. Apparently, everyone else had the same idea.

Outside my window, I could see why I’d never come here. It was a heavily wooded backroad. Gnarled, low-hanging branches blocked my view of the sky, obscuring any light the stars or moon had to offer.

I was about two hours from home, and it’s not like turning back would make it go any quicker. So, I sat. I turned on my favorite podcast and tried to make the most out of a bad situation.

The woods made it hard, though. They were fairytale-style creepy. Fog and all.

About thirty minutes later, my speakers stopped working. I was convinced there was literally nothing else that could make my night worse. I was so over it I laughed in outrage. Then the radio flickered. A blast of static. Then silence. Then static again. I reached to turn the dial, but the knob spun freely in my hand.

I tried to roll down my windows, but that didn’t work either. I heard a click-the locks. I messed with the lock buttons to no avail. I yanked on the door handles, but they didn’t budge. Then the engine revved, completely without my control.

My car-and every car in that line of traffic-trudged forward by themselves like carts on a roller coaster track. I looked in front of me and behind me and saw the faces of the once-drivers, now just passengers like me, on either side. They were just as confused as I was.

The first one didn’t show up for about twenty minutes. It was mostly just a mouth. I really don’t know how else to describe it. A drooling maw with spikes for teeth and a million tiny legs underneath it, carrying its circular body toward the road. It had three arms-one on both its left and right, and then one above its upper lip, protruding out from its backside. It skittered out from the trees and inched toward a red hybrid. The car door swung open on its own. The poor woman inside didn’t stand a chance. I, along with everyone nearby, watched helplessly as that mouth opened 180 degrees and bit her in half by the waist, head first. It slurped her legs down like noodles afterward.

The forest erupted with screams. People pounding on windows, kicking at doors, sobbing, pleading. The horrific spectacle had reignited our desperate escape attempts. I don’t know if the sound of panic is why it picked up after this, or if the smell of blood drew them out, but more came from the trees-dozens of monsters in all shapes and sizes.

A six-legged, hairless man the size of a giraffe came up to a minivan, crawling like a bug. He reached into the sunroof and picked out the family inside one by one, the same way you eat popcorn out of a bag. Another resembled a horse walking on its hind legs, its back hunched grotesquely. Its mouth was shaped wrong, its teeth were massive, and its front facing eyes bulged from its skull. Where its front legs should have been were two raptorial forelimbs, like a praying mantis. It used them to rip through a pickup truck like butter-and did the same to its passenger, tossing the shredded remains onto the road before grazing on his entrails like a cow with grass. Still another just appeared as a mass of writhing worms-or maybe tentacles. I don’t know if something was connecting them all at the center. The windows of a sports car opened, seemingly without the driver’s consent, and the thing squeezed inside like an octopus. The windows shut again. All that remained visible was the writhing mass inside.

And I remember thinking something strange. I watch a lot of animal shows. I know predators have methods. A cheetah chases down a gazelle. Wolves run their prey until it collapses. Alligators float like driftwood before striking.

This wasn’t like that. These things weren’t hunting. They weren’t even in a hurry. They just spilled out of the trees, wandered up to whichever car they wanted, and helped themselves.

This wasn’t a hunt.

It was a buffet line.

And then it was my turn.

My windows rolled down by themselves.

I heard it before I saw it-slithering, wet, sloppy noises coming from the trees to my left. Something massive dragging itself through the underbrush. A massive leech, easily ten feet long. At the front-if you could call it that-was a round, puckered mouth ringed with rows upon rows of tiny, triangular teeth. It reared up by my window like a cobra about to strike. I could see down its gullet. It was an endless black hole. It was death.

It reared back. That circular maw, glistening and twitching, opened wider than I thought possible.

I figured if death was going to visit me tonight, I had nothing to lose anyway.

I threw myself at it through the window.

I don’t think the leech expected that-if it was even capable of thought. It made a hissing, shrieking noise I still hear in my nightmares. I’d interrupted its strike, and it had to twist its slithering body awkwardly for its mouth to reach me. I knocked it down, landing on the asphalt beside it.

A numbness spread across my left shoulder blade. It didn’t hurt, but I knew it had bitten me. Just a grazing blow-its fangs had only scratched me. But I knew I had only a moment to escape, or the next bite wouldn’t miss.

I scrambled to my feet and ran.

I didn’t know where I was going. I just ran until I didn’t hear screaming anymore.

I passed other shapes as I went-more monstrous creatures lumbering, galloping, or scuttling past me. They didn’t bother with me. Why would they waste energy chasing one man, when a whole line of trapped victims was still so close by?

Eventually, I made it back to the highway.

I flagged down a trucker, covered in mud, twigs, and blood. My wound hadn’t stopped bleeding. It hadn’t even slowed. He got me to a hospital, where they managed to stop it. I rambled to them about the monsters in the woods, but no one believed me. I just looked like some crazy junkie.

No one I told believed me.

I checked the news, scoured the internet, searched the papers-nothing. I’ve been through my phone, trying to find that route again, but nothing shows up.

I don’t know how so many people can die and no one notices.

Someone needs to know about it.

I need to know what happened that night.
