They say that every single memory you have is reconstructed when you recall it. Filled with small flaws and inaccuracies. Holes and gaps. While I perfectly understand this concept, I have a couple memories from my childhood that I can’t quite reconcile. I went to a daycare across the street every weekday for a summer but all evidence points to the contrary. 

This problem started just a few days ago. My parents are getting divorced and I was helping my dad move some things around in his new apartment. It sucks but I can’t say I didn’t see it coming. They argued more than laughed throughout my childhood and I think things got worse after I moved out. Had to break at some point. I’ve made my peace with it.

In proper moving-furniture-educate, we plopped down on the crappy roadside couch as soon as it was hauled in. Pretty soon beers were cracked and we were laughing about old memories. When the conversation drifted to the year we lived in Wisconsin, I must have been seven or eight around then, I brought up the daycare across the street. I asked him if he remembered how weird the place was. If I ever told him some of the things that I remembered happening there. He just gave me a confused pause in response.

“What?” I said. 

“Ben, you never went to a daycare.” he said, still wearing his frown. 

I began insisting and telling him about the different specifics. It was right across the street. It was a white house. The lady who ran it was middle aged. Her name was Mrs. Rand. He cut me off eventually.

“I brought home all the money, Ben. Your mother was home all day. Why would you have gone to a daycare?” 

I didn’t have an answer to that. It made no sense, though I knew it to be true. Mom hadn’t had a job back then. I wouldn’t have needed any childcare services and certainly not for a whole summer. I dropped the topic after that and we kept up with the moving, but I haven’t been able to get it out of my head. The memories are too real. Too *vivid*. I guess I’m writing this not only to get other people’s thoughts but also in part to document my own garbled memories.

Call it a large imagination; call it the memories of a young child warped by time; call it whatever you like. I know something odd happened back then, I’m just not sure what. 

I had to be seven or eight, as I said, when we moved to Racine. Maybe a tad older now that I’m thinking about it. However old you are before going into the fourth grade. Racine isn’t exactly what I would call a glamorous town. It's in southern Wisconsin tucked against Lake Michigan which effectively makes it a foothill city of Chicago. It's a place filled with money and poverty at the same time. You can taste the apathy as soon as you cross into the city limits. 

All this being said, we had an alright house in a reasonably nice suburb. It was built in the 80’s. All stained wood and bricks. I remember there was this huge cobblestone fireplace that sat prominent in the living room. My dad and I would always sit with our backs to it on winter nights. I miss that place even though we only lived there for a year. Probably my favorite childhood house. Or maybe that memory is tainted by some fog glazed nostalgia too. I don't know.

What I *do* know is that across the street was a large white house. Even being that young I remember taking note of how apart it looked from the rest of the neighborhood. It was like an old structure with brand new parts. Like a ninety year old architect was given access to housing materials from the 2000’s. Like an elderly skeleton with a newborn’s skin. 

It was entirely white apart from the sickly beige shingles that paneled the roof. White siding; white window trim; even an awkward white stucco plastered on the house's front face. I had assumed my mom had brought me over there one day for the daycare, but now I guess I had ended up there on my own? I don’t remember her being with me when I went through the door come to think of it. However it happened, Mrs. Rand greeted me with wet eyes and a solemn look. 

“Oh, another one…” she said. I can still remember the sadness in her voice. “There are so many of you in this town. Hopefully your time here won’t be too long. Go downstairs and play with the others. They’re playing action figures right now. I’ll call you all back up when lunch is ready.” 

I had been taken aback by her demeanor. It was probably the first time an adult had been openly unhappy to see me. Or at least it seemed that way. Maybe my childhood had just been incredibly fortunate until then but it was odd to be that young and have a strange adult talk to you without a smile. Even so, I did as I was told and went downstairs to be met with a living room of white drywall and white shag carpet. There were about ten other kids all around my age, give or take a year or two. They were gathered around this contraption with a bunch of toys set up on it. One of the children got up right away to greet me. I knew him actually. It wasn’t from school I don’t think. I can’t remember where. I just remember finding it weird that he was the only one I recognized despite my elementary school being four blocks away. 

“Hey, I’m glad you could make it!” the kid said, excitedly jumping up and down. Despite not knowing his name from wherever I had met him previously, he wasn’t exactly hard to recognize. His scalp was completely hairless. Not shaved down. There would be a stubble of some sort if that was the case. It was the level of hairlessness you would see in someone with alopecia. Completely smooth, shiny, and pale. Though I’m pretty sure he didn’t have alopecia because he had thick, dark eyebrows that sat above his pale blue eyes. On his left cheek, there ran a thin, pink scar that stretched from the bottom of his eye down to his jawline. He told me his name was Cory.

“We’re just playing with some action figures over here if you want to join!” he said, beckoning me to follow him to the contraption with all the kids gathered around it. When I focused on what the contraption was, I realized it was some sort of… god it was some sort of *gallows*. Lincoln logs made up the two support pillars and a few wire clothes hangers had been cut and stretched to rest on top of them. Shoelaces were tied to the metal wires and I saw that they led down into small nooses that were wrapped around the necks of various G.I Joes, Transformers, and Ninja Turtles that all rested on a scavenged couch cushion. Cory grabbed the cushion with both hands. “Jasper and Lucas, can you hold the towers steady?” he said, looking at two of the other children. Tentatively, they did as he asked. 

At this point, I looked around a little confused trying to get a clue of the game. All the other kids just sat in a circle around the display looking bored. Placid even. I took a seat so I wouldn’t be the only one standing. Cory smiled wide and tensed before he started his countdown.

“Three… two… ONE!” he shouted as he yanked the cushion out from underneath the toys, sending them swinging and dangling by their necks in all directions. All the kids kept their bored looks, not letting out so much as a huff. All except for Cory, who was cackling and hopping on his knees so much he threatened to fall backwards. 

Before the scene could get too much stranger we heard the voice of Mrs. Rand calling down to us.

“Lunchtime!” 

We all rose, leaving the toys to dangle. I remember rationalizing this as being the end of some great, war themed game involving the figures. Maybe I had witnessed the execution of the losing side's generals or something. We learned about stuff like that in history class at this point though that didn’t really make it less morbid for children to be reenacting. Now that all this time has passed I’m not really sure what it was I saw. If it was a lone event I could have probably excused it, but it was far from. 

As we ascended the stairs and filed into the dining room, we all took seats in front of empty plates and empty glasses. I waited for some sort of food to be dumped onto the plates but nothing ever did. Maybe we had to go get it ourselves from some sort of communal pot? Just as I was grabbing the sides of my plate to get up with it, I noticed all the other kids had their silverware in hand and were more or less *pretending* to eat, spearing the air with their forks and bringing the nothing to their mouths. I even saw a couple raising their empty cups to their lips. 

“You have to eat.” whispered the kid on my right. He was the one that was named Jasper, I remembered. 

“What?” I said. He wiped the nothing from his mouth with a napkin before speaking again.

“You have to eat. You have to eat or Cory gets mad.” He kept his tone low and motioned to the other child with his eyes. When I looked across the table Cory was staring blue knives into me. The scar tissue was scrunched up with his childish frown. I looked back at Mrs. Rand, but she was standing at the sink washing a pan that looked perfectly clean to me. There was a window above the sink and she had been staring out of it at what looked like nothing in particular. I got the sense in that moment that a house fire couldn’t have pried her gaze from the glass. 

I conceded and grabbed the fork on the right side of my plate and followed suit, spearing some empty air and chewing it when I brought it to my mouth. Cory’s scowl rose into a giddy smile and he let out a high pitched giggle. It was the only sound apart from the clinking of clean forks on clean plates. 

I remember that one very well because it was my first time there, but as I said, there were many other strange things that happened at Mrs. Rand’s daycare. A lot of them are coming back to me now.  I’ll continue to write them as I remember.
