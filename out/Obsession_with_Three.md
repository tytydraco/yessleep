In my mediocre life, everything had to be done three times.

Three sips of coffee and three bites of bread to start my day — if I failed, I had to punish myself three times. If I didn’t, something terrible might happen.

In my youth, this obsession with the number three pushed me to the very edge of sanity. My mind was severely compromised, and only now, in captivity, do I see with clarity all the monstrous things I’ve done. Do not misunderstand me — I do not seek your pity. I simply want you to see that what I did, I did. There is no nobility in murder, no justification. Killing is killing. Period.

I will spare you my melancholy and say nothing of my past. Let us go straight to the events leading up to the cruel murder — and then, finally, to the act itself.

One morning I took my usual three sips of coffee and three bites of bread. I combed my hair three times, brushed each tooth three times, tied three knots in my shoes, and checked three times to make sure the door was properly locked.

Then I left for work — always accompanied by the number three. That afternoon, on my way home, I stopped by a bakery, and there she was: **Amelia**. The moment I saw her, my world froze. She was the most graceful creature I had ever seen.

Amelia had black hair, soft curls, dressed in black, and her skin was the color of almond. Her eyes vibrated with life, and her spirit was strong and bright — a beautiful woman with a naturally beautiful soul.

Sharp as she was, Amelia noticed that I was staring — and of course, she didn’t like it. What woman enjoys being stared at by a melancholic stranger? I imagine the discomfort I caused her. Forgive me for that, my poor Amelia.

Days passed, and I kept returning to the same bakery just to see her. One evening, I gathered enough courage to approach her. I was surprised she didn’t reject me immediately. Little by little, Amelia and I became good friends. She was funny, and her laughter was the most wonderful sound. She had strong ideals and a truly spirited nature. I could listen to her for hours and never grow bored.

As time went on, we grew fond of each other, and as a proper man, I made sure to do everything correctly, just as my mother had taught me. I spoke to her father and quickly gained the family’s approval. Amelia and I were married on a beautiful April morning in 1900.

In our intimacy, I told her about my horrid obsession with the number three, and how my mother was certainly to blame — a story, dear reader, I may tell one day. Slowly, my sweet Amelia helped me overcome it, and naturally, I began to forget it. Years passed. We had one child, then another two — all with black hair like Amelia.

More years passed, and Amelia lost two beautiful babies. Despite everything, our marriage survived the storms of life and grief. After long, painful months, our fourth child was born — meant to be a new light after immeasurable loss.

But the fourth child was different. His hair was blond, like mine. At first, I tried to ignore how much that bothered me, how deeply I felt something was wrong with that child.

He reminded me of myself as a boy — which disturbed me even more. He consumed all of Amelia’s attention, and may God forgive what I am about to confess: I hated him. I hated that child — blond like a devouring fire, needy like a sickness. Amelia barely had time for me or the others.

My mother, may the devil keep her, had never shown such affection or understanding to me as Amelia gave to that devil.

Slowly, the number three crept back into my mind.

I began noticing patterns: with Amelia, the boy smiled three times; with me, he hiccupped three times before crying for three full minutes, followed by a three-minute pause and three more minutes of crying. I swear he did it on purpose. What child behaves with such precision? Tell me.

His wicked little eyes watched me with malice — I know how insane it sounds, but believe me: that thing was not a normal child.

My heart tightened every time I watched Amelia give him attention. While she received love from that little devil, I received only disdain and tears.

Ashamed to admit it, many times I considered suffocating him, telling Amelia I found him that way — a sudden illness, a tragedy. But I couldn’t. It would be wrong. And it would destroy Amelia.

As weeks went by, my obsession grew stronger, haunting me. I drank more and more to silence evil thoughts — and the hatred I felt for that little devil.

In my dreams, I often saw myself getting rid of the problem in the most sadistic way possible — the way my mother had taught me long ago…

I drifted between nightmares and insomnia, guilt, jealousy, and rage. The bottle was my constant companion in that storm.

Amelia noticed that I was no longer myself. I no longer laughed at her jokes, danced with her on the porch, or came to bed. I was merely a skeleton of the man I once was.

I made excuses — tiredness, work, stress — lies she knew well, yet she accepted them. Poor Amelia… how could I hurt her? How could I do what I did?

One day, the little devil fell ill. He cried three times, paused for three minutes, then cried again. I know it sounds absurd, but I timed it — every single time, the number three appeared. He was doing it on purpose. What child does something so synchronized?

His mysterious illness lasted weeks, and our family crumbled under the strain. Amelia grew pale and exhausted. Her dark circles were as blue as the night — she no longer slept because the thing woke every three hours, crying endlessly.

My poor children asked when he would finally recover, and why — unlike them — he was so frail. I had no answer.

One night, it seemed the little blond devil finally surrendered to sleep. Everyone rested — everyone except me.

That cursed night, the devil began whispering in my ear. I refused to listen and began to drink. Three sips at a time — three sips to empty a glass, three glasses to empty a bottle. I broke three cups I had been gifted on three special occasions. Rage overtook me. And finally, I obeyed the whispered orders that had long poisoned my drunken mind.

I slipped into the kitchen while everyone slept. I took the third knife from the third drawer. I walked up the stairs three steps at a time and went to the room of my three children.

Moonlight shimmered over their black hair — beautiful as ever. But there was no time to admire them. I had to obey.

Silently, I approached each one and cut their throats — three cuts each — so they could not scream. They suffocated in their own crimson blood.

I wiped my hands on one of their garments and left the murder weapon beside their bodies.

Then I went to the room of the blond creature, fully intending to kill it at last. When I entered, I looked at its peaceful face. The moonlight illuminated its hair. He looked like me — the same birthmark on the foot, same mole on the hand, same pale hair.

He was my clear replica.

I picked up a pillow from the rocking chair where Amelia used to cradle him. As I approached the crib, the thing opened its eyes, looked directly into mine — and smiled.

He smiled at me. His gaze burned like hellfire, and his smile was malicious, terrifying.

I wasted no time. In my madness, I pressed the pillow over his face and suffocated him to death.

I cannot say at what moment Amelia’s maternal instincts warned her, but they did. She rushed in and caught me in the act. She pushed me away, screaming in agony as she saw what I had done. I had betrayed her trust, stolen her natural right to see her children grow. It was only natural that she hated me.

Her eyes — filled with disdain — ignited my rage, and I struck her. Amelia fought with all her strength, useless as it was. In the end, I overpowered her, and in a frenzy of hatred and bloodlust, I gouged out her left eye — and ate it.

As Amelia screamed in agony, I came to my senses. Horrified, I fled, leaving her to her fate.

At dawn, the police found me in an alley three blocks away. They told me Amelia had survived long enough to report me. I surrendered without resistance.

The shadow of what I did still hangs over my mind, and now I hear only the three laughs of the devil who led me to commit such acts.

Now I sit here, writing this confession in shame. I attempted to write it three times, across three long days, and only today has it finally flowed from mind to page.

There is nothing more to say — nothing more to do.

**Amelia, forgive me for everything.**

**Your beloved,**  
**Dom.**
