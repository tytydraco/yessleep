On July 5th, hours after an Independence Day fireworks show, the sky was once again illuminated with flashes of green and orange. These lights were not from stray fireworks set off by roguish teenagers, however. At approximately 12:34 a.m., a shooting star was reported flying through the clear skies of Strasburg, Colorado, and shortly after a loud explosion was heard throughout the town. A farmer, whose identity will remain anonymous, felt his home shake from the explosion and feared the worst. With a shotgun in hand, he bravely went outside to investigate. The air was pungent with a heat so unnatural from that summer’s heat; he reported sweating as if he had entered a sauna. He scanned his farm and found that there was a fire burning in his field, the smoke and flames rising above the cornstalks. He quickly rushed out with a fire extinguisher to quell the flames. The closer he got to the fire, the more it seemed to dim, but the heat remained. When he finally reached whatever had caused the fire, he discovered that there was a depression in the earth, the same size and depth as a pitcher’s mound, and at the bottom was a chunk of rock from the stars.   
A meteorite had landed in his field.   
First came law enforcement and fire crews to tape off the secure the area. Then came the scientists. They approached the rock with reverence for the meteorite was everything they had ever hoped for. While most meteorites range from sizes of pennies to baseballs, shapes of all kinds, the one that landed on a nowhere farm in Colorado was the size of a minivan and was completely intact. It was spherical, with craters, and had a shiny hue to it as if it were polished. Its purple tint attracted all who saw it. It was solid stone; no earthly tool could penetrate its surface. And it was so immensely heavy; even a heavy-duty crane was powerless to lift it. This in turn led the scientific community—NASA, colleges, astrologists—to turn the farm into an impromptu lab much to the farmer’s dismay.    
Scientists swooned over the meteorite, studying it as if it were a holy relic. They ran their tests to the best of their abilities with whatever equipment they had, with whatever test samples they could extract from the rock, which was nothing more than dry swabs from its surface. Their tests resulted nothing out of the ordinary; it provided them of nothing of its origins or how it formed or why it was the color it was. And that would’ve been enough for them; they would’ve deemed the meteorite a failure in secret and leave the thing to become a sideshow attraction—the famer could profit from it. They would’ve left and that would’ve been the end of it.   
But things dropping from the sky seldom go quietly.   
Some of the scientists found themselves so attracted to the rock that they refused to leave it. They looked at it with amorous love for it that to be apart from it would send them spiraling. Some of the men would scream and yell if they were forced to leave, baring their teeth as if they were animals fighting for a mate. They would turn on each other, on more than one occasion the makeshift lab turning into a brawling pit of fists. Faces were beaten, bones were broken, blood spilled.   
The meteorite, aside from being a permanent stationary object, was becoming an issue.    
Guards were posted to enforce a barrier around the stone to prevent further disruptions, but this caused a whole new problem. The men in charge of protecting the stone fell into the same madness as the scientists; they fell in love with the stone, and Heaven help those that got too close to it. The guns issued to them were used with extreme prejudice. The last man standing, having shot his fellow guardsmen, protected the stone until his dying breath. His death did not come from retaliation from the army or such, but by his own doing. It was said, by those observing the situation, that the guard threw his gun to the ground, turned to face the stone, knelt before it, raised his hands in religious fashion, then, ghastly as it was, bashed his head against the rough stone repeatedly until finally he dropped.   
By now the science community, the army, the government, was getting spooked by recent occurrences that they treated the stone as some kind of plague. The scientists theorized that the further distance away from the stone the safer everyone would be from whatever madness came from it. A perimeter was placed, homes evacuated, wall erected, and the army took control of observations. And for a time, this worked, but it was a temporary fix at best; the stone needed to be shot back into space from whence it came, and let the void have its madness.   
Temporary fixes seldom solve anything.   
The field of influence, of radiation, the invisible bubble of madness that steamed from the stone extended past its wall. Those in the blast radius fell into ravenous, murderous rage, killing everyone in their path, and once their hands were soaked through in blood and sinew, they made a pilgrimage back to the stone where they sacrificed themselves to it.   
The line grew more and more each day, and men, having heard about what this wave did to them, fled the state of Colorado in each way. In this madness, a new discovery; women seemed to not suffer from the same madness. They were, for all intents and purpose, immune to the madness of the space rock—for a time. Before authorities could act on this discovery, women who had braved the perimeter just a bit suffered through bouts of intense headaches; so violent they were that they were brought to their knees and vomited. The sickness, as hypothesized, would eventually lead to murderous rage as well, but they would not go to the meteorite and sacrifice themselves; rather, they became the modern zombie, fast, mindless, driven not by hunger but by their rage. The women affected targeted their loved ones first, then whatever enemies they made in life up until that point.   
The bodies of children, of babies—so, so many babies—started piling up. Some were just mangled puddles of flesh and bone.   
All the while, men unfortunate enough to be in the ever-growing wave of madness kept dying. They turned into beasts, snarling, hunched, something so primordial that the modern human can’t comprehend it, and they all returned to the stone where they gave themselves to it with their blood. No explanation could reach any authority figure, and the public, the world, went into a panic. Colorado was now considered a No Man’s Land. From the eastern plains all the way to the ski resorts in the mountains, not a single human remained. Neighboring states boarded themselves from Colorado transplants, all in the name of public health—who knew if the madness could lie dormant within the body, then awake and spread. As for the world, no other nation would accept flights coming from America—let the Americans deal with the madness and leave our lands free of it.   
As the bubble of madness expanded, a rumor spread through the public. It was said that a man was pulled from the madness and when he was questioned what went through his head, he gave a detailed description of what went on. He said that the stone called to him in this angelic womanly voice, almost like a song singing him back home. His mind was so at peace from her melody that he only wanted her for himself. He was so angry to be away from her, so far away, and all these other men around him were rivals, and they needed to go. That was all they said. The word “siren” was tossed around, and the meteorite of unknown origin and substance gained its new name: The Siren’s Stone. And the Siren was singing her suitors to her.   
As I write this, Nebraska, Kansas, and bits of Oklahoma, Wyoming and New Mexico are within the Siren’s song, and citizens are moving towards the coasts, to Mexico, to Canada, to escape her songs of murder. The news has given updates periodically guessing where the sphere of radiation has reached. I feel confident in my temporary residence in upper Arizona; we’re just a hop-skip away from Nevada, and if so, we will trek to California. But now I doubt our little haven. The last broadcast said that the line hadn’t spread, but if that were the case, then why do I see a gorgeous woman, skin so pale and angelic, bathed in flowing blue robes, hair of deep space black, calling to me, singing me towards her throne, that damned meteorite? Why am I so angry? Why am I not there with her?   
I fear that I don’t have much time, and I will descend into the madness that has captured many men before me. I will fight my way to Colorado, crawl there if I have to, and I will give the Siren what she wants.   
But there’s something else that worries me. My wife has been getting horrible migraines, complaining of body aches, and snapping at the most menial things. But worst of all, I worry for our baby. Before, she stared at him with the love only a mother a give—a love that held up the burden of the world. Now, with her head spinning and body in knots, she stares at him with hatred, and I bet she imagines the best way to kill him.   
God help us all.
