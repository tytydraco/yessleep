Tension sizzled in the air of the interrogation room. The two rookie detectives sitting across from me undid their ties and took off their suit blazers. I don’t know if it was because of the heat or because of what I just told them. Either way, I don’t blame them. I reacted worse when I first heard it.

&#x200B;

“Let me get this straight,” the one sat to the left spoke up, “You fucked up this case we spent weeks on because of a… Boogeyman?” A smile tugged at the corner of his lips. Wrinkles around his eyes formed as he looked at his dickhead of a partner.

&#x200B;

They both burst out laughing.

&#x200B;

I leaned forward in my seat, coming into the light radius of the hanging lamp. “I ‘fucked up’ this case because our vision was confined to a little tiny box. The playing field has changed, my friends.”

&#x200B;

The one sitting to the right, Cohle, tried to put on a serious face. Beads of sweat trickled down his buzzed head and onto his purple dress shirt. “You do realize how ridiculous this sounds? Even if we were to believe you–which is a big if–how would you think our boss would react once he hears that our biggest case in ages was ruined by monsters?”

&#x200B;

I grabbed a water cup from the cold metal table and drank. “I would assume he’d be glad that we are finally doing something worthy of our detective titles. But he’s almost as big of a jackass as you two.” I sat up, pushing aside the screeching metal chair. “If you would excuse me, gentlemen, I got much better places to be.

&#x200B;

I turned my back to them and walked towards the door.

&#x200B;

“Laz,” Cohle’s little butt-buddy called out, “Don’t let the monsters get ya!”

&#x200B;

I shook my head in disappointment and spun back around. I could feel the veins on my forehead bulging as I stared at their dumb little faces. Children.

&#x200B;

“Lazzaro,” said Cohle, “drop the bullshit, man. You’re dealing with a murderer. You can’t go on this solo.” He stood and walked towards me. “Let us tag-along, I know we’re assholes sometimes, but we got your back. Plus, we could really use some fresh air. This office and all the paperwork is suffocating.”

&#x200B;

“Alright, but keep this shit to yourselves for now. Jonah can’t know until we get enough evidence.” I pointed at Cohle’s boyfriend. “You’re sitting in the back.”

&#x200B;

“Done. When are we taking off?” said Cohle.

&#x200B;

“About 10 minutes. Get ready.” I said.

&#x200B;

I opened the door and stepped out into the bustling main room. My ears needed time to adjust to the contrast of silence, to chatter and gossip. I stood outside the interrogation room for a moment, glancing at heads in the cubicles. The office was nothing like those you’d see on TV. Yellow wallpaper peeled off. Fluorescent lights flickered. I’m so glad I got my own office now. If I had to stay another minute here, I'd lose it. 

&#x200B;

The new hire, Abby, warped around me, her passing wind smelling of perfume and freshly printed paper. She headed down the hallway.

&#x200B;

“Abby, hold on.” I hurried after her.

&#x200B;

She continued walking, her high heels clicking rhythmically. “What can I do for you?” She said, not taking her eyes off the stack of paper she was skimming through.

&#x200B;

I walked beside her, trying to keep up with her stride. “Did you pull up those, you know, those documents?”

&#x200B;

“Yup, they’re on your desk.”

&#x200B;

“Are you sure you got all of them on the list?”

&#x200B;

“Yup, triple checked.”

&#x200B;

“Thanks, Abby, I owe you big time.”

&#x200B;

We stopped outside of Jonah’s office. Abby looked at me, cradling the papers in the hand and the other on her chin. “Hmm,” she said, her hazel eyes looking up at the flickering lights. “Tomorrow, I want a, uhh, a Venti from Starbucks–Write this down.”

&#x200B;

I pulled out a notepad and pen from my inside suit pocket.

&#x200B;

“A Cookie Frap with white mocha and caramel sauce and mocha drizzle, Cali-style. Oh and a Venti Strawberry Acai Lemonade, but with no strawberries. Add light peach juice and six pumps of raspberry syrup.”

&#x200B;

I tried to catch up with her fast words. “Six pumps of raspberry syrup, got it. Okay, remember—”

&#x200B;

“—Don’t tell Jonah, yeah, got ya.” She smiled and opened Jonah’s office. For a second I heard his raspy voice talking agitated into the phone until she shut the door behind her. 

&#x200B;

I looked down at the frantic scribbles on my notepad and sighed. Last time I ordered a drink for her from Starbucks, I held up the whole line because I forgot how many pumps she wanted. Another time, I gave her my order by accident. Black coffee. She threatened to tell Jonah what documents I was asking for that time.

&#x200B;

I made my way towards my office room, passing coworkers and desks with piles of paperwork. Once inside, I turned on the light. A brown cardboard box greeted me on my desk. Neatly written words on the side read, *‘For Gayzzaro! :)’.*

&#x200B;

I rolled my eyes.

&#x200B;

I looped around my desk, pulling out my badge and gun from the counter. I only grabbed one extra magazine since we were just doing some recon. I grabbed the box and hid it under my desk.

&#x200B;

The chill breeze smacked me in the face as soon as I walked out of the building. The morning sun struggled to shine over the dark clouds. It was gonna rain today in a few hours.

&#x200B;

I made my way across the parking lot towards our unmarked Dodge Durango Pursuit. The two dickheads were leaning against the black paint of the SUV. I shook my head and pointed at them. “If you get a scratch on it, you guys are buffing it out.”

&#x200B;

They stood straight, wiping the back of their suits and checking if their belts left any scratches. “You got your badges and guns?” I said.

&#x200B;

“Yeah,” said Cohle. “Rick thought it’d be safe to bring extra mags for everyone.”

&#x200B;

Rick held up a box for me to see as if I was blind.

&#x200B;

“Good, get in.” I pulled out the keys, unlocked the SUV, and hopped in.

&#x200B;

The smell of brand new leather and the mysterious car fragrance of a new car soothed my nostrils. Until the two rookies hopped in and made it smell of Dior and Versace cologne. It’s as if they showered in that stuff. I turned on the SUV and cracked the windows.

&#x200B;

“I got AUX duty!” said Rick.

&#x200B;

“Please don’t play that dumb song again.” I said, putting the gear into drive and skirting out of the parking lot.

&#x200B;

The speaker exploded with that army song Rick thought was so cool, *‘Some folks are born made to wave the flag. Hoo, they're red, white and blue. And when the band plays Hail to the chief-’*

&#x200B;

Cohle and I sighed. “We're not rolling into war. Turn this shit off.” I said.

&#x200B;

“Okay, okay, Jesus. Party poopers.” He shuffled through a few songs and another rock song exploded through the speakers *‘Carry on, my wayward son. There'll be peace when you are done. Lay your weary head to rest. Don't you cry no more’*

&#x200B;

It was either this or hearing them talk the whole ride. We turned into the highway entrance and merged with the fast-moving cars. My mind shut off the karaoke going on in the backseat and trailed off into what we were walking ourselves into…

&#x200B;

We were gonna recon a warehouse where I got word that the ‘murderers’ we’ve been after are holding up. The last person I interrogated off work-hours said that we were after some monsters I heard tales of as a kid. *The Germeyes.*

&#x200B;

Of course, I didn’t believe him right away. I reacted worse than Rick and Cohle did. “Germeyes? Yeah fucking right.”

&#x200B;

Until he showed me the remains of one. The flesh was decomposed by the time he led me there, but the bones… The bones shook me to my core. A skull the size of a small boulder. Teeth sharper than a needle and as wide as a person. It felt surreal looking at a thing like that in person. I couldn’t dismiss it as a Photoshop or mistake it for something else. It was real.

&#x200B;

I couldn’t accept it was real, though. Not at first. My mind raced faster than Usain Bolt, trying to find a logical explanation for what that thing really was. A huge bear? A whale somehow in the middle of a forest? I even tried brushing it off as a sasquatch, that was better than accepting it was a Germeyes. The monster my childhood friends told me about. The one who swallows kids whole and spits them out as something… Not human.

&#x200B;

Before I could snap a picture of it, the man I had handcuffed smacked the camera out of my hands and darted into the woods. I have never felt more useless and stupid in my entire life. The smartest thing I did that day was leave the forest before it got dark…

&#x200B;

“...doing?” I heard faintly.

&#x200B;

“Laz! What the fuck are you doing!” I felt a grip on the steering wheel as Cohle yelled. He swerved us back into our lane. “Are you fucking stupid?!”

&#x200B;

My heart pounded in my chest as I came back to the present moment. I looked around, seeing Cohle and Rick gasping for air. “My bad,” I said, gripping the steering wheel firmly and shaking off the tiredness. We passed an overhead sign, signaling that exit 23 was coming up in 1 mile. “We’re almost there.”

&#x200B;

I turned up the music, drowning out their lectures and threats to tell Jonah.

&#x200B;

The warehouse came into view as we took the exit. It was a grim-looking place, tucked away on the outskirts of the city. The looming clouds added onto the unsettling feel it gave off. We pulled into a discreet parking lot a short distance away, giving us a decent view. I killed the engine, letting the silence settle for a moment.

&#x200B;

“That was my bad. It won’t happen again.” I said.

&#x200B;

“My ass, you could’ve got us killed,” said Rick.

&#x200B;

“You’re lucky there wasn’t any incoming traffic. I’ll drive us back,” said Cohle.

&#x200B;

“Okay.” Reclining my seat back, I reached under it for a pair of binoculars. I adjusted the binoculars, focusing them on the warehouse. It was old and weathered, with windows that were either boarded up or shattered. The perfect place for criminal activity. “Rick, you keep an ear on the radio just in case anything comes up. Cohle, get the pair of binoculars from the trunk and help me scan the area.”

&#x200B;

“You want me in here or by those treelines for a better view?” said Cohle.  
 I focused onto the ledge facing the warehouse where the trees ended. “By those treelines. Don’t go any further than that and stay low.”

&#x200B;

“Got it,” he said. He opened the car door and hopped out. I reached down for the trunk lever, pulling it while still focusing on the warehouse.

&#x200B;

“Can I go in the front seat?”

&#x200B;

“Yeah, but don’t be annoying.” I said, “Did you bring some beef jerky?”

&#x200B;

“You know it,” he said as he crawled into the front seat. 

&#x200B;

The trunk shut and Cohle walked towards the warehouse, flipping us off as he passed. I continued to scan the area through my binoculars. The rain had started to drizzle, making it harder to see. The warehouse remained still, no movements through any of the windows. There was no sign of anyone or anything.

&#x200B;

Minutes stretched into what felt like hours. Raindrops splattered against the windows. Rick fiddled with the radio, occasionally muttering to himself and to Cohle. He would shuffle through songs to find the perfect one. I could sense his restlessness. He was never the patient type.

&#x200B;

Something caught my eye, a glimpse of a hooded figure peeking through one of the shattered windows. “Fuck,” I murmured. “Rick, radio Cohle to stay low and stay concealed. Someone just peeked through a window.”

&#x200B;

“Was Cohle made?” 

&#x200B;

“No, but just in case.”

&#x200B;

Rick radioed to Cohle. He responded by crawling behind the cover of a tree. My binoculars fixed on the shattered window where I had spotted the hooded figure.

&#x200B;

Rick's fingers danced across the radio controls, ready to call for backup at a moment's notice. Cohle remained hidden behind the tree, his form barely visible through the rain and mist.

&#x200B;

As the moments ticked by, I saw movement again. Another figure emerged from the shadows within the warehouse. This one was taller, bulkier, and wore a red cloak. It was difficult to make out details through the rain-smeared glass. 

&#x200B;

“Another,” I said, “There are at least two people in the warehouse.”  


“Should I call it in?”

&#x200B;

“Not yet, we don’t have any reason to arrest.” I said, “Tell Cohle, though.”

&#x200B;

“Two sketchy dudes in an abandoned warehouse are not enough?” Rick sighed and clicked the radio, “Cohle, there are two confirmed people, over.”

&#x200B;

No response. I looked at the treelines, Cohle wasn’t there. 

&#x200B;

“Cohle?” Rick asked.

&#x200B;

“Roger,” said Cohle, “Two men confirmed.”

&#x200B;

I grabbed the radio from Rick’s hand. “I told you to stay put. Where’d you move?”

&#x200B;

The radio clicked, “No where.”

&#x200B;

“I’m looking at the tree where you’re supposed to be.”

&#x200B;

“Looking at the wrong tree, then. I didn’t move.”

&#x200B;

My heart pounded in my chest. I looked up and down the treeline with the binoculars. The rain made it difficult to see into the forest. I clicked the radio, “I don’t see you.” 

&#x200B;

“I’ll stand up.”

&#x200B;

I focused on the tree and saw Cohle’s figure stand. Relief washed over me. “Okay, good. Stay low.” A blurred figure darted out of the warehouse entrance in the background. I looked away from the treelines and focused on the entrance. What the hell was that thing? It moved so fast.

&#x200B;

I clicked the radio, “Cohle, come back. Slowly, don’t make too much noise. And stay low.”

&#x200B;

“Roger.”

&#x200B;

“What happened?” Rick asked.

&#x200B;

“Something came out of the warehouse.”

&#x200B;

“Something?”

&#x200B;

“Yes, something. I only caught a glimpse of it. It was quick.”

&#x200B;

I focused on the treelines. Cohle jogged to us, trying his best to stay crouched. I focused back on the warehouse. My heart sank to my stomach. The red cloaked figure was staring directly at us. Its head was shaking from side to side. There were no facial features. Only smooth skin.

&#x200B;

I clicked the radio and stammered. “Cohle run! We’ve been made!”

&#x200B;

Rick opened the front door for Cohle and crawled into the back seat. Cohle dashed inside, his wet clothes squeaking in the leather seats. I cranked the engine. It stalled. I cranked it again. It turned on. 

&#x200B;

I shifted into reverse and floored it, eyes still facing forward at the warehouse. A group of figures cluttered together at the entrance looking at us—

&#x200B;

The SUV halted and shuddered. A loud clang reverberated from behind. My head whipped forward, slamming into the steering wheel. My vision became a blur. My ears rang.

&#x200B;

"Shit!" I faintly heard.

&#x200B;

“You hit a lamp post dumbass!”

&#x200B;

I groaned, placing my hand on my head, trying to stop my world from spinning. “I-I can’t drive like this.”

&#x200B;

I glanced in the rearview mirror, my heart pounding in my chest. The red cloaked figure from the warehouse was now standing behind us, its featureless face still shaking from side to side. It was like something out of a nightmare.

&#x200B;

“Fuck, fuck,” I murmured. “He’s behind us!”

&#x200B;

They turned around and screamed for me to drive. Disregarding my blurred vision, I quickly shifted the gear into drive and hit the gas pedal. The SUV jerked forward, tires spinning on the wet road. I held the steering wheel with trembling hands, praying I wouldn’t crash.

&#x200B;

“Step on it! He’s chasing us!” said Rick.

&#x200B;

"Faster, Laz! Drive faster!" Cohle yelled from the backseat.

&#x200B;

“I’m trying! I can’t see shit!”

&#x200B;

The SUV swerved as I tried to navigate through the rain-soaked road. I could see the city lights in the distance, glimmering as if guiding me. 

&#x200B;

“Shoot him, Rick, shoot him!” Said Cohle, facing behind.

&#x200B;

I glanced in the rearview mirror and saw the figure almost within arm's reach of the SUV. Without thinking, I slammed on the brakes, causing the figure to lunge forward and collide with the back of the vehicle. There was a sickening thud as its body hit the rear bumper.

&#x200B;

“Holy shit!” said Rick.

&#x200B;

“Jesus, what the fuck!” Yelled Cohle, “J-Just drive! Go!”

&#x200B;

I hit the pedal to the floor.

&#x200B;

We swerved out of the parking lot.

&#x200B;

“Is he… dead?” My voice shook.

&#x200B;

“He’s not moving,” said Rick.

&#x200B;

I glanced in the rearview mirror. The warehouse was now just a speck in the distance. There was no sign of the red cloaked figure. 

&#x200B;

“Let’s head back to the station—”

&#x200B;

A guttural screech cut through the air, causing all of us to jerk in our seats. My grip on the steering wheel tightened as I looked in the side mirror. My blood ran cold. The red cloaked figure, no longer human-like, had leaped onto the trunk of the SUV, claws digging into the metal. Its smooth, featureless face was now contorted into something grotesque. Its head inflated like a balloon and its sharp teeth dug into the glass, shattering it.

&#x200B;

“Shoot it, Rick!” Cohle yelled, his voice laced with panic.

&#x200B;

Gunshots echoed in the rain-soaked night as he fired at the creature. The shots hit its body, causing it to twitch.

&#x200B;

It didn't let go.

&#x200B;

I swerved the SUV, hoping to shake the creature loose, but it clung to the trunk

&#x200B;

“We need to get rid of it!” I shouted, my knuckles turning white as I gripped the steering wheel.

&#x200B;

Rick fired more shots, aiming for the creature’s head. One shot struck its neck, causing it to release a gurgled cry. The creature's grip finally gave way, and it fell from the SUV, disappearing into the darkness.

&#x200B;

I swerved the SUV back onto the road, my hands trembling on the steering wheel. We drove in stunned silence. The rain continued to fall, as if washing away the horrors we had witnessed.

&#x200B;

“T-That’s… That’s no Boogeyman,” stammered Rick.

&#x200B;

"Germeyes," I said, "They're real."

&#x200B;

\*\*\*

&#x200B;

That was my first of many encounters with the Germeyes. I thought it'd be fitting to post my experience on here. If you would like to hear more encounters, let me know in the comments. I must go now. Rick, Cohle, and Abby are waiting for me in the parking lot of this Starbucks, where I'm typing this. Yes... She ordered me to get her more drinks.   


Until next time.
