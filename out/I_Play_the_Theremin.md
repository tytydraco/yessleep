It's an otherworldly kind of instrument.  You are playing the air.  Both dynamics and notes are achieved in subtle hand and finger movements’ distance to the antennae.  I've never felt so in and out of control than being up close to the magic.  When the magic is in my own hands.

I taught myself the theremin through internet tutorials and solo experimentation in my free time.  There is a pitch correction knob I began with to learn the various scales.  It shows the notes on the screen and how close you are in pitch regardless of that knob’s placement, which I gradually turned down until I no longer needed that function. 

It wasn’t long before I so obsessively played with this thing, the ethereal bleating seemed built into my walls.  

The Minimoog started as a neat Halloween party trick and ended as my best friend. 

Only when I loomed over this instrument conducting my own one-note orchestra did I ever feel alive, or as if I was ever meant to be. 

At the beginning of the end, I had a problem that seemed unsolvable — a mysterious phenomenon I knew defied any and all logic. 

When I unplugged the theremin one night, she kept talking.  The screen was off, but the sound didn't cease.  I stood across the room and listened.  Her voice was sad.  I scrolled through all the settings to find her voice.  It was never there.  

Eventually, at the end of my practices, I sat with her before bed.  All she really needed was to be heard. 

I don't believe in demonic possession and I don't believe in ghosts.  

But I believe in magic. 

A week ago, I sat down and the screen lit up.  I did not power it on and the plug was carefully wrapped, pulled tight with Velcro on my desk. 

I felt as if my theremin was an Ouija board.  Someone was extending an olive branch from out there in eternity.

Letters from no scale appeared onscreen, with notes I could only describe as “wrong” — semitones that seemed bent even from that in-between place. 

"S-H-E-S 
 S-A-D." 

I was afraid and stiffly went back to my room.  I began to wonder if it ever was my hands creating that hauntingly beautiful music.

I took my theremin to a nearby music store as if there might be an answer to this upsetting “glitch” that only seemed to act up after closing time.  Of course the man behind the counter was bewildered.  I still don’t blame him. 

When I got home, I spoke to my theremin, hoping she could hear if I initiated conversation.  If I spoke back without playing a note. 

"Who is sad?"

"I - A-M."

If I was going to ever play this instrument again, it would be a ritualistic risk.  Something would happen to me.  

And it did. 

Tonight, I dared to play notes that did not exist.  Words that do not exist, or perhaps remnants of various ancient languages, appeared on the screen until eventually, just symbols.

Then, the screen shut off.  The lights went out.  

They never went back on. 

Only flashes of light.  Only my own voice. 

Somewhere now.  Maybe I am where she was, alone with a screen just as she is in my office. 

But I am happy as I write this to you all. 

And to the reason I sing every day: 

I - L-I-V-E
