My apologies to yinz for not providing an update sooner — I’ve been doing a lot of prep for my disbarment hearing.

Months had passed since [I walked away from the Kellerman Estate](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1fmhiyo/tales_at_law_the_last_will_and_testament/), and the firm itself. I felt a strange mixture of relief and unease. 

The burdens and minutiae of practicing law had been lifted off my shoulders but my disbarment hearing loomed closer, and I couldn’t shake the feeling that the Kellerman family was not done with me. Their calls had stopped, the letters ceased, but an inexplicable weight clung to my shoulders like a rain-soaked shroud. It felt almost if I had left behind a part of my soul entangled in their chaos.

I hardly left my apartment, barely noticing the lack of hum around me — atypical of the busy street I lived on. I felt like a ghost slipping back into a realm I no longer belonged. 

I watched out my window, every day, half-expecting my managing partner, with that same, knowing smile, to show up at my door. But she never did, instead, I allowed the silence to envelop me. 

My silence was interrupted, by a heavy knock at the door in the early morning. I jumped at the sound and ran to the door. Looking out of the peephole, I saw no one. I creaked open the door, my eyes darting around, searching for any sign of movement. 

A thick, yellow envelope sat on my welcome mat, obscuring its friendly greeting.

The envelope bore no return address. It felt quite heavy in my hands. I tore it open, my heart pounding in anticipation. Inside was a single, crumpled photograph of the Kellerman family gathered around a grave, faces wrought with grief and twisted with anger, fear, and something I couldn’t quite place — an animalistic look of desperation.

An icy dread washed over me — Was this a warning? A reminder of the tangled web that I left them to contend with on their own? The longer I stared at the photo, the more I was filled with dread, so I quickly crammed it back into the envelope.

That evening, I resolved to investigate the grave from the photograph. I needed to know what happened, to understand the clouds that hung above the Kellerman family.

I found the cemetery tucked away on the outskirts of town, suspended in time. The air was thick with humidity, and a dense fog clung to the ground, wrapping itself around the headstones. The smell of rain, and fresh, wet dirt punctuated the air. 

As I meandered through the graves, the name “Richard Kellerman” echoed in my mind, reminding me of why I was there, before I finally stumbled upon the grave from the photo.

It was poorly maintained, overgrown with weeds, placed in a neglected and lost-to-time section of the cemetery. The name engraved read “Richard Kellerman,” the patriarch whose will had set this entire ordeal into motion. 

I knelt, a chill running through me. My fingers brushed the overgrown grass.

Suddenly, I heard the sound of footsteps crunching on gravel behind me. I turned to see the youngest Kellerman — his eyes wild, skin pale. “What are you doing here?” he hissed, panic and anger flaring, his face growing redder with each lunging step. 

“I just…” I stammered, but he stepped closer, his breath ragged.

“Get away from this place!” he shouted. “You have no idea what you’re messing with. You think you can just walk in and out? This is not a game!”

“What is it?” I asked, my voice hardly registering, hung up in the thick tension between us.

“It’s a curse,” he spat, eyes glistening with tears, “You don’t know what’s been buried here. What HE did, what HE made us do!”

A sudden wind gusted through the cemetery, tearing through my coat, and chilling me to the bone. The youngest Kellerman looked around, terror flickering across his face as if he sensed something. “You need to leave. They’re coming for you,” he whispered, stepping back, eyes darting. 

Before I could respond, a low, keening sound filled the air — a blend of rage and mourning. The shadows seemed to stretch unnaturally around us, writhing as if alive, taking on forms that flickered in and out of existence. The other members of the Kellerman family had arrived.

They emerged from the fog, faces contorted with pain and rage, bound by chains only they could see. The wind began to grow, beginning to howl around us.

“You shouldn’t have returned!” the patriarch’s second wife cried, stepping forward, face soaked in tears. “You’re the one who will awaken him!”

“Awaken who?” I shouted, desperate to understand.

“Richard! We were never supposed to be a family, you have to believe us!” She pleaded. “He kept us from the truth, from the truth… but the Will, it was a trap.”

The youngest Kellerman began to shake, his eyes widening by the second. “You have to get out! Leave us to our fate.”

The wind howled louder, screeching as the shadows grew nearer, forming grotesque figures of twisted faces. I stumbled backwards, heart racing as their hands reached out, grasping mere inches from me in the air, trying to pull me into the darkness.

“Stop!” I cried, as their rough hands gripped my shoulders, unable to peel myself away from them in time. 

As the shadows of the Kellerman family enveloped me, I heard a voice — a raspy whisper, the same that haunted me from the beginning. “You should never have left. You will learn the truth!”

The ground beneath me shifted, and I was transported, now standing in an empty court room. The air crackled with energy, the walls bled shadows. The Kellerman family filled the jury box, each one wearing a mask of anguish, betrayal, anger, and desperation. I was no longer just an observer to their plight. 

“Welcome to your trial, lawyer,” Richard growled, voice reverberating. “You will answer for what you have done. You want to know the truth? You will live it!”

Suddenly, I found myself at the center of the graveyard once more, surrounded by the family. They were screaming, the cacophony piercing my mind as accusations, memories, and the history of the Kellerman family flew like daggers. I felt their individual pain, and it tore through me, each word clawing at my sanity. 

In that moment, I was witness to their cursed legacy, entwined in a web of darkness with roots deeper than I anyone could bear. I couldn’t escape the weight of their secrets, the cries of the dead pulling me deeper into the abyss. 

As I began to sink into despair, losing hope of a way out, I caught a glimpse of Richard’s face among the shadows, his eyes glimmering with a knowing malevolence. 

He smiled, a cold, cruel grin promising retribution. 

He leaned down as the family continued to shout overtop of one another. He whispered, “I’ve given you a gift. You’re bound to us forever.”

The graveyard faded once again, the wind dying down, the shadows swallowing me whole. The last thing I heard was the echo of their voices, a haunting chorus that would haunt my every waking moment, “You are one of us.”

“Are yinz okay?” A voice, drawing me out of the shadows.

I sat up, rubbing my temples, my head pounding. I felt concrete beneath me, wait… I blinked, trying to place where I was.

“Are yinz okay?” The voice repeated. I blinked a few more times, before registering it as my neighbor.

“W-what?” I managed to reply. 

“You’re sleeping on your doorstep bud.”

The memories from what had happened at the graveyard rushed through my head. I couldn’t grasp the implications of what had happened nor how I had gotten home.

I brushed my neighbor off, “yea, yea, I’m okay, late night.”

He didn’t look like he believed me, but shrugged it off nonetheless.

I shakily stood, and another envelope fell from my jacket. I bent down to pick it up, it was lighter than the last, and ripped it open. It contained a single usb drive.

I rushed my way inside, jamming my key into the lock, and almost forgetting it there in my haste. 

Booting up my laptop I connected the usb. A folder popped up, “Family.”

I hesitated for a moment, feeling the weight of these files press down on me. I clicked on the folder, my heart racing as a series of video files appeared, each labeled with a date. The most recent one caught my eye: “Final Testimony.”

I clicked it, causing the screen to flicker to life. The grainy video showed the Kellerman family gathered in a room, dimly backlit by candles, etching deep shadows into their faces. They looked haggard, eyes sunken, as if they hadn’t slept in a lifetime.

“Richard,” a woman’s voice trembled, “if you’re watching this, then you’ve found a way to escape your fate. But I know this: the curse is not broken, it merely waits for another to take your place.”

The video briefly went dark, a cut in the editing, then the room reappeared, empty. The camera panned to Richard, who sat at the head of a long, wooden dining table, an unsettling smile dancing across his lips. 

“Welcome back to the family,” he said, his voice low yet buttery smooth. “You’ve been chosen. We’re bound together now, whether you like it.”

The video cut again and continued, showing the family once more, now recounting their own experiences with the curse. Each one spoke of nightmares, of visions clawing at every scrap of their sanity, of the dark things they had done to survive its wrath.

“Can you hear them? The whispers?” another family member asked, their voice cracking. “Once they take hold, they’ll never leave you. They wait, lurking in the corners of your mind, until you let your guard down.”

The words washed over me and my head swam with their implication. Each confession, each vignette into the curse, felt like a noose tightening around my neck.

As the video progressed, the atmosphere grew more oppressive, the shadows flickering and twisting more aggressively, as if they were alive, waiting to be released. I wasn’t a passive observer to the video, I felt like I was a part of it. I swear I could remember the room… the smell of the burning candles’ dripping wax, the rough wood of the table, the claustrophobic shadows…

The video cut a final time, now showing Richard standing, with his back to the camera. It panned, showing his head sunk low, face an expressionless mask. 

“You will face the truth,” he snarled, “in life, I controlled this family, shifted the course of this damned curse. In death, you shall be my herald. There. Is. No. Escape.” Every word was punctuated with a tap of his wedding band on the table. 

The screen flickered and went dark. My laptop shut down, leaving me with an eerie silence. I sat there for some time, the weight of the family’s, and especially Richard’s, words weighing on me, and hanging heavy in the air.

I eventually stood, and began to pace, trying to clear my head. Every shadow seemed to jump out at me, every dim corner felt haunted, seeming almost to mock me. 

That night, as I tried to sleep, I was plagued by visions… flashed of Richard’s cruel smile, the ghostly figures of the Kellerman family, haunting whispers of all manner surrounding me, beckoning me.

As morning came, I made a decision. I couldn’t wait for them to come to me. I had to confront the curse. I was filled with the need to seek out the truth behind Richard’s hold over the family, his hold over me, before I was claimed as his next victim.

With a resolve that felt almost foreign, I donned a coat and stepped outside into an icy, spitting rain that bit at every inch of exposed skin. I headed back to the cemetery, driven by an urgent desperation. I didn’t know what I was going to do, just hoping that I would learn what needed to be done.

Approaching the graveyard seemed to cause the fog to grow thicker and the rain to pelt harder.

When I reached Richard’s grave, I knelt down, brushing away the weeds. I could feel his presence, a suffocating aura of torment that sucked the air from my lungs. I whispered into the rain, “What do I need to do?”

The wind picked up, swirling around me, and I felt a tingling sensation at the nape of my neck. The shadows began to gather, forming into the familiar shapes of the Kellerman family. Their eyes glinted with… not fear, but anticipation.

“You’re back, so soon.” Richard’s silky voice echoed through the shadows, rich with malice. “I knew you couldn’t stay away.”

I stood up, “What do I need to do to end this Richard, to free them?”

A chilling laughter erupted around me, resonating across the graveyard. “There is no freedom in truth,” Richard sneered, “the truth binds you tighter than chains.”

The shadowy figures lunged forward, choking me, as the darkness gripped me. The voices of the family swirled around me, drowning out my thoughts, urging me to succumb, to bend.

“Enough!” I shouted, forcing the words through the shadows constriction. “I will not be a pawn in your game.”

I went on, “I will bear your truth, Richard, but I will not serve you.”

The air grew thick with tension, the shadows coiling like snakes, ready to strike. Then slowly, they began to dissipate, their whispers quieting.

“The truth is a heavy burden, lawyer. You will never be free. It is foolish to think otherwise.”

The shadows hesitated, wavering like smoke in the wind. I took a deep breath, momentarily steadying myself against the weight of their presence. 

“I’ll carry it,” I declared, resolute, “Whatever it takes. I will carry your truth.”

Richard’s laughter echoed once more but the shadows faded all together. 

A whisper in my ear, causing me to jump, as if Richard stood right beside me, “Go home. My youngest, Jacob, will find you. He will show you.”

And with that, he was gone. I looked around, uneasy, unsure of what to do next. 

The rain slowed, and the wind blew gently, carrying with it the faint smell of burning candle wicks. I trudged home to await Jacob’s visit.

Each day began to blend into the next as I spent my time watching out my windows, becoming even more of a recluse than I had been.

The clock on my wall ticked, yet I sat still, awaiting Jacob’s visit and my disbarment hearing, unsure which would come first, and terrified at the prospect of either.

That’s where I found myself now. Watching, waiting, and worrying. Hoping something breaks this monotony, hoping that I can get free from the Kellerman family, and get my life back.
