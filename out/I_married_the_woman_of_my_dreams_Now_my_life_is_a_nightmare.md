I saw her in math class one day. She was new to school and was immediately the most popular girl in class. Even then I knew she was my soul mate. I was six, so I didn't have the words to describe my feelings. I stood in front of her, as red as a fire engine, just tripping over my words. I got frustrated and walked away.



We didn't speak again for about twenty years. I watched her for those many years in school, and thought I'd never see her again when we graduated. It was a Thursday in August when I saw her again. I was in the office, typical work day, just setting up insurance policies for elderly. I don't know what drew me to insurance. Maybe my name? I'm Jake by the way, I wear khakis.



She came in, and even with the years it has been, I recognized her like it hadn't even been a day. She sat at the desk across from me and began to explain that her husband had passed away and she was there to collect a check to cash in his policy. I felt empathy for her, even though the man she married wasn't me.



A slithering, disgusting part of me lit up in my skull. My turn. I took down her personal contact information to communicate anything she'd need regarding the insurance. When she left I stealthily copied her information on a scrap of paper and shoved it into my pocket.



Weeks went by, occasionally I'd dial her number into my phone and just hover my thumb over the little green button. I never had the courage to actually call. Then, one day in November, my phone rang. I never saved her number, but I dialed it enough that I recognized it when it flashed on my screen. Gracelessly, I lurched for the phone and fumbled to answer it. I managed a shakey "hello?" and was met with the sound of a torrent.



She bawled on her side of the phone. She was unintelligible for a few minutes but calmed eventually. She talked about how she's hated being alone, couldn't work up to dating and just needed someone to talk to. My turn. I asked if she wanted to meet up for coffee and just talk, catch up. I thought she might not have remembered me when we met at the office.



We had coffee on a brisk morning in November, and we were married in January. She had always been the woman of my dreams, even when I couldn't interpret the feeling. She had always been perfect. Like she had been made to set the example for beauty. We've been together for about five years now, and until recently, things were indistinguishable from a perfect little storybook ending. But it wasn't the end. Not yet.



A girl, probably seventeen or eighteenth came into the office one morning looking for a comprehensive policy for the car she just stated driving. Towards the end of our interaction, she called me cute, and went about her business. I didn't think much of it. When I got home, Ella, my dream wife, made real, waited for me. As we sat down for dinner, she was staring at her phone. Her words stabbed into the silence and made me jump a little. "Who's this?" She asked flatly, sliding her phone across the table to me. The image on her phone was from the CCTV at the office. The girl sitting across the desk from me.



I explained it was nothing, just car insurance. With one narrow finger, she tapped the screen and the image came to life. The girl's voice calling me cute hung in the air between us. Ella was visibly angry now. I tried to explain myself, but found there was nothing I could say to placate her. It was literally nothing, but I hated seeing her upset. So, reading the room, I started insulting the girl, calling her ugly, and dumb. It hurt me to insult people, even strangers. But I'd do anything to make her happy.



Seemingly satisfied, she sat back in her chair, a little smile on her face. "Good." The only thing that left her mouth. I was a little rattled from the potential discord in our matrimony, and resumed my dinner. As I put a forkful of the meat and pasta dish into my mouth, I noticed it. A hair. Golden and long. My wife and I both have dark hair. I glanced up to see if she noticed my discovery. She just sat there with a knowing smirk, sending a chill down my spine.



After dinner she went to bed, and I stayed up as always to watch TV and wind down before bed. When I heard the bedroom door close behind her, I sprung up to my feet. We keep all our meat in a chest freezer in the basement and a sick feeling in my stomach urged me to investigate it. The stairs creaked under me as I decended, until the hard concrete floor met my house shoe. I crept up to the freezer and lifted its lid. The contents made me step back and stifle a scream. Tried as I might I couldn't stop the vomit from spilling out between my fingers.



Wrapped up in tidy little paper packaging was a pile of new meat. I wouldn't have been able to identify it if not for the severed head, bruised and bloody resting atop the pile. Something stopped my backward momentum and I spun fast to see what had stopped me.



Ella.



She stood there grinning. She told me I was her's. Nobody else's. "Don't be like Greg. Don't do what he did. I don't think I could bear to be alone again." It sounded like a thinly veiled threat. I just responded with a weak "yes, dear." That seemed to satisfy her. Her voices dropped back to her regular comforting cadence. She ushered me to bed, being the calm and comfortable, beautiful woman I married.



I don't know what she'd do to me if she knew I wrote this, but I don't want to end up like Greg.
