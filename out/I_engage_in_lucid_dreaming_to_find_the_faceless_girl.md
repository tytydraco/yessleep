RULES OF PARTICIPATION IN LUCUS DREAMING  
I opened my eyes, it was a wonderful time with just me and her - a girl with curly blonde hair in a baggy dress like in fairy tales. It's just me and her, we have fun chasing around the fields, in the forest or any place you can think of in the beginning of many other stories. She's so funny and smiles and when I open a confession  
Tick Tick  
The clock rang, leaving me alone in a messy room and a pile of unfinished homework from last night... what the hell am I doing with my life.  
It's been a few years since I first met her. I graduated and have a boring job but with a high salary. However, I can't be with anyone yet because I don't want to lose her forever - There Must Be Some Way! I can't lose a love that only lasts one night...

RULES OF PARTICIPATION IN LUCUS DREAMING  
Lucid dreaming is a term that refers to SUPER REALISTIC dreams that we can control and can do things that you cannot do in reality.  
A Dream-initiated lucid dream (DILD) begins as a normal dream, and the dreamer eventually concludes that it is a dream, while a wake-initiated lucid dream (WILD) occurs when the dreamer from a The normal waking state goes directly into the dream state, without ever losing consciousness.  
A lucid dream can begin in one of three ways:  
1 Object Recognition Technique: This technique is when someone finds an object in a dream and their subconscious mind tells them that they are dreaming, thus initiating a lucid dream. A common object that people use is their hands. Finding your hands in your dream and focusing on them, then being able to move them at will will create a lucid dream.  
2 The second technique is called TCR, which stands for Text Change Recognition. Text in dreams, whether on billboards, signs, books, phones, etc. often changes every time you look at it. Recognizing this effect will subconsciously let you know that you are dreaming. For example, you may be wearing a watch in reality and in your dream you quickly glance at the watch to see what time it is like you would on a normal day, but if you look back the time will not be the same. exact time.  
3 The third technique is known to be simple. It has no term but can be described as the search for abstract things in dreams that will not happen in real life. Let's say you have a dream about a unicorn. Subconsciously, this shows that you are dreaming, because unicorns are not real.  
These three Techniques can all be done and have equivalent effects.  
Things to note when in a lucid dream:  
1 Always remember that this is just a dream - thinking this is reality can get you stuck in a pile of beautiful memories that you can't escape.  
2 Always be positive, don't panic because when you panic, painful and horrifying memories will appear in your head and they will quickly appear in front of you.  
3 You should limit closing your eyes because when you close them for a period of time you will return to reality  
HOWEVER So if you encounter any unexpected situation, keep your eyes open and you will wake up safely  
4 You should not harm any entity here because it is you in a way. Maybe it's a personality and a memory, but if you interact negatively with the entities here, you will wake up and lose all those memories or that personality. HOWEVER, YOUR IMPACT WITH THE OBJECTS HERE CAN MAKE YOU GONE FOREVER OR STUCK IN YOUR MIND  
5 It's best to find accurate information about lucid dreaming because false information about any topic will get stuck in your head like a hard drive full of junk information...
