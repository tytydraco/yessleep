The silence in this house is my oldest companion. It’s a heavy, polished thing, buffed to a high sheen by Clara. My wife. My warden.

She moves through the rooms like a ghost, her slippers whispering on the hardwood. She controls everything. The bland, colorless food I eat. The single, tepid cup of tea I’m allowed each day. She even controls the light, the heavy velvet drapes perpetually drawn against a world I am not permitted to see. For my own good, she says. Because of the man I am. The man I was.

My name is Arthur, and I am a monster. At least, that’s what Clara has spent the last ten years making me believe.

My memories of the Before are a fractured nightmare, glimpsed through a shard of broken glass. Red. Screaming. A profound, gut-wrenching sense of loss. Clara fills in the gaps with her calm, relentless voice. She tells me I was violent. That I had… episodes. She tells me about the fire. The one I supposedly started. The one that took everything.

She never says what ‘everything’ was. She just looks at me with those pitying, patient eyes and says, “It’s better you don’t remember, Arthur. It would destroy you. I am all that stands between you and the abyss.”

My only rebellion is this journal. I hide it beneath a loose floorboard under my bed. In it, I document the evidence of her conspiracy. *March 14th: Dreamt of a child’s laughter. Woke to find Clara standing over me, her expression unreadable. March 18th: The beef stew tasted of chemicals. A new sedative? March 22nd: Heard a woman sobbing. When I mentioned it, Clara said it was the wind. There is no wind in this sealed tomb.*

The paranoia is a vine, twisting around my ribs, constricting my heart. I see things. A fleeting shadow that is not my own. A face, pale and indistinct, in the dark screen of the television. Clara is erasing me, piece by piece, replacing me with this docile, trembling shell.

The turning point was the locket.

I found it while she was gardening, tucked in a small, carved box at the back of her wardrobe. It was tarnished silver. Inside was a picture of a little girl with bright, cornflower-blue eyes and a gap-toothed smile. A girl I did not know. A girl who felt more familiar to me than my own reflection.

And with the locket, a memory, not of red and screaming, but of sunshine. Of pushing a small girl on a swing, her delighted shrieks filling the air. The name came to me on a breath: “Lily.”

That night, I confronted her. My voice was a dry rasp. “Lily. Who was she?”

Clara went very still. For the first time in a decade, I saw a crack in her placid mask. A flicker of something raw and terrifying. “Where did you hear that name?”

“The locket. I found it. Was she… was she mine?”

Her face closed again, tighter than before. “Oh, Arthur,” she sighed, the sound full of weary sorrow. “Lily was the neighbor’s cat. The one you… hurt. Before the fire. Don’t you see? This is why you mustn’t dwell on the past. It only upsets you.”

A cat. The memory felt so real, so warm. But her explanation was so reasonable. The doubt was a poison she knew exactly how to administer. I retreated, the seed of my rebellion withering under the frost of her logic.

But the seed had roots. It had tasted the soil of truth. I began to watch her more closely. I noticed she never left the house. That we had no visitors. No mail. That the world outside our windows was perpetually, unnaturally silent.

Last night, I couldn’t sleep. I crept from my room and saw a sliver of light under the door to the basement—the one place in the house that was always, without exception, locked. I heard a sound from within. A soft, rhythmic scraping.

Driven by a fear greater than the fear of my own monstrosity, I fetched the fire poker from the hearth. The old lock splintered easily under the weight of my desperation.

The basement was not a basement. It was a shrine.

The walls were papered with newspaper clippings, yellowed and brittle. My own face, younger, stared back from a dozen front pages. **FATHER QUESTIONED IN DAUGHTER’S DISAPPEARANCE.** **LILY GRAHAM: STILL NO ANSWERS.**

In the center of the room, on a small pedestal, sat a simple ceramic urn.

And Clara was there, on her knees before it, a small trowel in her hand. She was carefully scooping fine, gray ash from a larger box into the urn. She was talking to it, her voice a tender croon.

“There now, my darling. Almost full. Mama will have to find more for you soon. She will. She always does.”

She looked up and saw me. There was no surprise in her eyes. Only a profound, bottomless grief.

“Arthur,” she said softly. “You weren’t supposed to see.”

My legs gave way. The fire poker clattered to the concrete floor. “Lily… our daughter…”

“She wasn’t yours,” Clara whispered, her eyes fixed on the urn. “She was *mine*. My perfect, beautiful girl. And you took her from me. The court, with its lack of evidence, its ‘reasonable doubt,’ it let you go. It gave you back to me.”

She gestured to the box beside her. It was large, and I could see now what was inside. Not just ash. There were bits of charred bone. A small, blackened tooth.

“The world wouldn’t give me justice,” she said, her voice chillingly calm. “So I made my own. I brought you here. I made you a prisoner in the home you took her from. And I promised her I wouldn’t let you forget. I promised her I would keep you right here, with us, forever.”

She looked from the urn to me, her eyes gleaming with a love that had curdled into the purest form of hatred.

“The fire wasn’t your punishment, Arthur. It was mine. It took my Lily’s body. But I’ve been rebuilding her, you see? Piece by piece. And you,” she smiled, a terrible, broken thing, “you have been so helpful. All the pets from the neighborhood… the vagrant from the park last winter… they all burn down so nicely. They all help fill my little girl back up.”

I stared at the urn, at the woman I had thought was my jailer, and the final, devastating truth settled upon me.

I was not the monster.

I was the fuel.
