*Child Victims Division*

The following interview took place at 1400 in San Jose, California on July 25th, 1994 at the home of Clark and Susan Wickett, parents of twelve year old Stephen Wickett who has yet to be recovered by the D.O.P.'s Deep End Recovery Unit. The disappearance took place on July 4th, 1994 two months after Stephen Wickett was prescribed an experimental drug treatment by an individual posing as a doctor. Attempts to locate this unknown individual have so far been unsuccessful. The following two months are described by the Wickett parents in the interview below.

**AR: Agent Raymont**

**CW: Clark Wickett**

**SW: Susan Wickett**

*\*Transcript Begins\**

**AR:** \*Clears throat\* Interviewer Isaac Raymont, investigating the case of missing child Stephen Wickett. Please state your full names before we begin.

**SW:** Susan Victoria Wickett.

**CW:** Erm -- Clark Lee Wickett, sir.

**AR:** Something wrong Mr. Wickett?

**CW:** I um, no, sorry. I’m just a bit nervous is all.

**AR:** I assure you Mr. Wickett you have nothing to worry about. I’m just here to collect a few more details for your son's case. I get what I need and you get your son back faster, that’s all.

**SW:** We understand that, Isaac. Can I call you Isaac?

**AR:** Agent Raymont is fine.

**SW:** Right, we understand that Agent Raymont. I think what my husband is getting at is… well we’ve already given a police statement. After the initial search concluded we even gave an interview at the station. I’m not saying we don’t appreciate your assistance in finding our son, but neither of us quite understand what the point is in another interview.

**AR:** I’m just making sure I get every last detail. It’s important we’ve got the story straight so we have the best chance of finding Stephen.

**CW:** Are- are you trying to say we might be lying?

**AR:** Not at all Mr. Wickett. It’s just that when it comes to cases whose details are a bit more… far out we tend to cover our bases more thoroughly. 

**CW:** Now hold on, I don’t-

**SW:** \*Hushing Mr. Wickett\* Honey, he says he’s trying to help. If it helps bring Stephen back then let’s tell Agent Raymont whatever he needs to know.

**CW:** I- you’re right. Sorry, Agent Raymont. Ask away.

**AR:** Thank you both for your cooperation. The sooner I ask my questions, the sooner I’m out of your hair. Let’s begin with the pills. What did you say they were called?

**SW:** Mesmoral. If you want the bottle you’ll have to get it from the station. They took it as evidence during the first round of questioning.

**AR:** We’ve already acquired it, thank you though.

**CW:** Wait, acquired it? Are you not from the station?

**AR:** Why did Stephen first get prescribed the Mesmoral?

**SW:** Trouble at school.

**AR:** Behavioral?

**SW:** No no, Stephen’s always been a sweet kid. That’s the one thing his teachers all say about him, he never lets another kid struggle alone. He may not be good at it either, but he’ll always try to help them. He just can’t focus for the life of him.

**AR:** There are other medications for that.

**CW:** We know, none of em ever worked. The kid’s just too hyper all the time. Been that way since he was little.

**AR:** I see, and where did you first hear about Mesmoral?

**SW:** It was this new doctor we took him to see. Clark got- well, he had to find a different job. Lower pay, worse benefits, retail work.

**CW:** It was just supposed to be an in-between while I found something better. At the same time though Stephens grades were slipping. We couldn’t afford no tutor, and neither of us were exactly geniuses in school either. Not to mention what they’ve got these kids learning these days. I mean, shit, I looked at his homework one night and was just as confused as him. 

**SW:** I remember that night, after he went to bed we just stared at the paper. Neither of us could make heads or tails of it. I think that’s when we decided he needed more help. Like we said the medications never really took so I didn’t exactly have high hopes for this one. Now at the time Clark’s insurance from his job wouldn’t cover our normal doctor, which was a real shame since he’d been with the family forever. Even Stephen loved going to see him.

**CW:** That’s just because the doc always gave him some kind of lollipop or something after his appointments.

**SW:** Well either way he actually listened. He wanted to find some way to help Stephen but we never got that far. We had to find a new doctor, one that was in network for us now.

**CW:** It took us a while, but we did. His office wasn’t the flashiest, definitely could’ve used a once-over from the cleaners but we were pretty much out of options. We got Stephen in and this guy was asking him all sorts of questions. Who did Stephen think he was on the inside, if he had memory problems, his eating habits. Would shush us any time we tried to interject. Hell, he even asked if Stephen believed in God. He gave him this form to fill out and after Stephen struggled with it for a minute he took it away and confirmed what we knew for years. Stephen’s got some kind of attention disorder.

**AR:** What was the name of this doctor?

**SW:** Dr. Erving, he was a funny looking fella. Had some REALLY thick glasses.

**AR:** Did you ever see Dr. Erving after this appointment?

**SW:** No, he just said he had a new medication in mind. Obviously we weren’t excited to put Stephen on some experimental new pill but at the time it didn’t really feel like we had any options left. The doc had given us a few months' supply, told us he’d contact us when the trial period was over. Our insurance would cover it all and Dr. Erving even said we’d get some kind of bonus compensation for allowing them to use Stephen as a test for it.

**CW:** Shit. You have no idea how many times I’ve thought about what would’ve happened if we just said no. He’d still be here \*Mr. Wickett’s voice breaks\*.

**AR:** It’s okay Mr. Wickett, take a moment if you need to.

**CW:** \*Deep breaths\* I’m fine, just needed a second. Anyways, we put Stephen on this damn pill. And you know what? It fucking works. Works better than anything we gave him before. First saw it when I was asking him to do something and he held eye contact with me the whole time. It may not sound like much but he could never even focus on TV, much less his old man. Then the kid starts acing his tests left and right. Brings his grades from F’s and D’s to A’s across the board.

**SW:** We always knew he was smart, he just couldn’t focus to save his life. So once we saw this kind of improvement we couldn’t believe it was working this well. I mean his teacher was actually talking about holding him back for a year and after two weeks she changed her tune completely. She went on and on about how he was a model student now, always attentive and answering questions. He was just doing so good.

**AR:** I see, you must have been very proud.

**CW:** You don’t know the half of it. Our son was a goddamn genius. It’s not like we weren’t proud of him before, he always did his best. But now we had something to brag about.

**SW:** We started talking about some kind of reward. It couldn’t be too expensive of course, but after all his progress we knew we couldn’t just let the opportunity slip by. He’s always liked the beach. We figured we could head about an hour west to Half Moon Bay and have a family trip to the beach for the fourth of July. We could bring our tents and sleep there. He was ecstatic when we told him. That was about a month before the trip, before he went missing.

**AR:** Did you notice any odd behaviour before the trip? Anything out of the ordinary?

\*Silence for around thirty seconds\*

**AR:** We can circle back to-

**SW:** We did. We should’ve known something was up but we just weren’t thinking straight. You see Agent, he just kinda… knew things.

**AR:** Knew things?

**CW:** Like dinner. Knew when it was gonna be done before we called him down. That’s not too odd, but now that I think about it that’s probably when it started. He’d come downstairs right as we were about to call him. Then he stopped asking what we were gonna have when he got home from school. Again, not too strange until he started saying how he “couldn’t wait for tacos tonight”. Susan wouldn’t even have the ingredients on the counter before he said it. Neither of us told him, he just knew.

**SW:** Then the neighbor's cat went missing. And I know what you’re thinking, but Stephen loved animals. We’d take him to the pet store just to look at the dogs and cats up for adoption. He wanted to volunteer to play with them. He always believed that if you could help someone then you should. Hell, he wanted to organize a search party for it.

**CW:** Point is, he’d never hurt a fly. We helped look around the neighborhood but he just kept saying it was in the woods. Now we’ve got coyotes out here so we knew that if it had gotten out in those woods it was as good as gone, but Stephen was convinced it was still alive. Eventually we caught him trying to sneak out. He was almost out the door before I grabbed his arm and pulled him inside. He just yelled and pounded on the door, kept trying to get out and “save it before the coyotes get to it”. They found it a day later with some bites taken out of it.

**SW:** After that he got a little more quiet about knowing things. We tried asking a few more times how he knew but he just kept clamming up. The last thing we wanted to do was ruin whatever had set him on the right path so we let it slide. But after that he started doing things before we’d ask.

**AR:** Sounds like a parents dream.

**CW:** You’d think so, but to be honest it was just plain unsettling. I’d see the garbage was full and by the time I looked at him to tell him to take it out he’d already be staring at me. Like he was waiting for it.

**SW:** He’d answer questions before we’d ask him too.

**CW:** I’d walk into his room to see if he was doing his homework and before I even opened the door he’d just yell that he was almost done with it. It got me thinking about what else he “knew”.

**SW:** It felt like we were always being watched in our own home. In our own heads, even.

**AR:** \*Scribbling notes down\* Obviously this had you concerned, did you not reach back out to Dr. Erving to ask questions?

**SW:** He never left us with any contact information. We tried calling the clinic but they always just said they’d get back to us.

**AR:** And they never did?

**SW:** Nope. We were always the ones calling them. Made sure to leave them our phone number too just in case they didn’t have it on file.

**CW:** I know that it’s suspicious. I knew it was at the time, but Dr. Erving said he’d call us back when the trial period was over so we trusted he’d honor his word.

**AR:** Have you heard from him at all?

**CW:** No. The line for the clinic doesn’t even work anymore. I’ve driven by the location and the building is vacant now.

**SW:** We still don’t know if he was a real doctor, or if the clinic was even legitimate.

**AR:** If you still have them I’d like to collect the clinic's information. Phone number, address, anything you have once we’re done. Please though, continue.

**CW:** Right, sorry. Where were we?

**SW:** Even though he was getting stranger by the day we still didn’t wanna take away his reward. He was acting odd but he had done so well that it wouldn’t be fair to take away the beach trip. We didn’t really figure anything could go wrong on it anyways.

**CW:** So we went. The whole time I could see him watching me in the rearview. I don’t think he blinked once. Either that or he was only blinking when I was. We’re getting close enough and I can smell the salt in the air when he says something. He says “I hear someone screaming”. I’m concerned, not from how freaky hearing him say that was but because someone may actually be in danger. I pulled over to the side of the road and there’s nothing but seagrass and a sliver of ocean we can see over the hills. No other cars around either, but he keeps saying someone’s screaming and we need to help.

**SW:** I told him it was just the wind coming through the seagrass but I don’t think he believed me. He didn’t mention it anymore once we kept going though so I hoped that was the end of it. We pulled up on the beach and he practically bolts out the car door towards the water. Now it wasn’t too far but we’re not about to let him wander when he’s saying all these things. If someone overhears him they’d think he’s crazy. I yelled for him to wait for me so we can look for shells and shiny rocks while Clark sets up our tents. 

**SW:** The whole time we’re walking by the water he’s just distracted. Looking out at the waves like something’s got him hypnotized. I kept trying to snap him out of it but after a minute he’d get distracted and just keep staring. He had this look in his eyes like everything he wanted was out at sea. Thing is, he was still collecting shells. He didn’t even have to look for them, just stared at the waves and dug his hand in the sand. Didn’t come up empty handed once. He kept putting them in his pockets until it looked like his legs had these misshapen tumors. I- god I realized how scared I’d been of our son those couple months.

**CW:** It took me a while but I got the tents up despite the wind. Had to put them behind the car so they wouldn’t blow away with us in it but they would do. Stephen got his own tent so he could have his own space. I got them up as the sun was going down so we all regrouped and started spreading out our blankets on the sand. People were setting off fireworks before it was even fully dark. It was nice for a bit, but as it got darker and more went off I kept looking over at Stephen and he… well it was like he didn’t even notice. Just kept looking out at the sea. It was loud so I couldn’t hear much, but I swear he was saying the screaming got louder. I’m not proud of it, but I didn’t know what to do so I just left him to it and focused on the fireworks.

**AR:** I read the statement you gave, this is when he wandered off right?

**CW:** I er- yeah, after that he just disappeared. We tried yelling for him but the fireworks were too loud. We had to find a payphone before we could call the police and by the time they got out there he was nowhere to be seen.

**AR:** The search lasted through to the morning, correct?

**CW:** Yeah, they got the Coast Guard out and everything in case he got caught in the waves. They said if he did then it wasn’t likely he’d be found-

**SW:** Clark, stop. Agent Raymont, before we go any further I’ve got a question for you now.

**AR:** Yes Mrs. Wickett?

**SW:** You’re not with the police, are you?

**AR:** No Ma’am, I never claimed to be.

**CW:** Wait- then who in god's name are you? Fuck I should have known, what fucking officer goes by “Agent” anyways?

**AR:** I’m an Agent of the Department Of Phenomena, Mr. Wickett. I understand your suspicions of me but I assure you my only goal is to assist in the process of returning your son to you.

**CW:** Department Of Phenom- what the fuck are my taxes paying for, the Ghost Busters?

**AR:** The D.O.P. isn’t public facing Mr. Wickett but we provide an important service, especially in cases like yours. Now I’m going to ask you a question in return. Was the statement you gave to the police accurate?

\*Pause\*

**SW:** No, Agent. Not completely.

**AR:** Would either of you care to fill me in?

**SW:** \*Deep breath\* I was the one who saw it happen. He was sitting a few feet away from us and I could have stopped him. I don’t know why I didn’t. I don’t know if it was curiosity, or the hope that I wouldn’t have this feeling of him watching me hanging over me anymore. I watched him stand up while Clark was glued to the fireworks. He never emptied his pockets of rocks and shells. If anything it looked like he’d packed even more in there, to the point where I don’t know how the seams hadn’t ripped. I saw the weight it added to each of his steps as he plodded down the beach and the sand he kicked up flaring different colors in the light of the fireworks. He just kept walking, further to the waterline until it was hard to make out his shape. But I saw him every time a firework boomed. I saw him go step by step into the water. With each flash I saw his ankles, then knees, then hips, then chest, and finally his head disappear under the water. I waited, afraid to see if he’d float to the surface and we’d have to rescue him. I hoped he wouldn’t. It took me ten minutes until I was sure he was gone and told Clark what had happened.

**CW:** I wish I could say I was mad at Susan, but it made my gut turn when I realized I understood why she did it. I’d felt his eyes on me at home every second of the day. I know he was my son, I was supposed to protect him, but if he really knew everything then there’s no way he didn’t know we were afraid. 

**SW:** The last thing I heard him say as he got up to walk away was the hardest. I knew there was nothing I could do when I heard it. He said “There’s only crying now. Someone needs help.”

\*Only scribbling is heard for a minute\*

**AR:** How long before you called the police?

**CW:** At least an hour. We wanted to make sure he was gone.

**AR:** I see. You realize this constitutes parental negligence at best, correct?

**SW:** We know.

**AR:** However, given the circumstances and the fact that this case is very much D.O.P. territory, that can be put on the backburner for now. Thank you for the information and your cooperation you two. I’ll be in touch if more information is needed.

**SW:** Wait, Raymont-

**AR:** Agent Raymont.

**SW:** Agent Raymont, what happens now? What do we do?

**AR:** My advice? Stick with the story you gave the police. You made the right choice by telling me the truth, but not everyone needs to know it. We’ll handle things in the background for you, but lay low right now.

**CW:** Erm- right. Thank you, Agent Raymont.

**AR:** Just doing my job Mr. Wickett.
