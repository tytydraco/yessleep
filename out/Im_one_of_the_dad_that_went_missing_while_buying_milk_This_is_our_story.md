Hey guy, just call me Cris. I live in a suburban town in my state. Im 23 and I work as a Night Watch.

Maybe you guys are used to the joke of "I got to buy some milk" yeah the joke when the boyfriend go to buy some milk once their gf get pregnant.


Well I need to say that it actually has a darker story behind it. 


Last month, I got the news about my girlfriend get pregnant, so we will have a baby. Im happy,exited and nerveous at the same time.


To calm myself I go the the store to "grab some milk" and perhaps just drink abit. Once Im about to pay for the groceries. The cashier, an old women maybe at her 60s?. She asked me.

"First baby ehh?"

I say yes and then I snapped. How did she know? Did I mumble it? I dont think so. After that I grab the groceries and get out of the store.


Once Im out, Im shocked, the sky is red as blood. The dark sky if the night is no more. The moon is orange in colour and very bright.

I stumble on my feet trying to get on what is going on. I look around me and saw the small town turned into ruins of building and large tree started to grow.

I look back at the store. It is empty.


I roam around the town. Looking for sign of atleast someone. After looking for about 15 minutes, I see someone. A women. I walk toward her and I want to talk. Suddenly someone grabbed my had and pull me behind a truck

"What the he...."

Shhhhh dont let it hear you.

It is a man. Skinny and look dirty. I want to ask what happen but he quickly pull me to the nearby bush. We walk for a while before I saw a zink door with fence around.


The man open the door and bring me inside. From the small settlement like area, I saw dozens of man. Some are skinny yet some looks fine. They greet me.

"You buy milk arent ya?"

I nod.

The man sigh and said "We all have the same experience" but none of us know how we end up here.

You can stay in the camp, but you need to do some chores. I agreed.

From the man stories, finding way out is not an option so I want to stay here for a while. I help them to catch crow and rat. We eat it. After around three days. I tell them that I want to leave.


I need to find a way out. I have a family.

They didnt insist me to stay so I started my journey roaming the town.


I saw the girl again, she sees me now. But something is wrong. Her face is pale as snow and she had dark eyes looking like a void. Suddenly she dash atcme faster than I can react.


I get on my feet and started running. I jump from car to car, and from road to road. More and more of that pale women came after me.


I dont know if I can make it. I jump and hide in the large trash bin. I wait for a while.

"Running eh?"

I almost got a heart attack. The old women from the store she sit beside me in the trash bin. 

"Well you are here, you must bare this punishment"

What punishment? Why?


You hurt a girl feeling when you were at highschool I suppose?

I think for a while. Oh yes I remember. I once played classmate of me, I made her cry by giving her fake hope.

Now you see this is your punishment, she kill herself ya know?

Now she would join "them" and you and those other guys will feel the wrath.


I cant bealive it. The women hand me a paper.

"Solve this riddle and you might have a chance to go back to your normal life"

(To end something, one should look back at the starting)


I scracth my head. This is bullshit. I walk out to the gas station perhaps I would have something to eat. I found some canned food. When I looting all of the food.

I suddenly heard footstep and the step seem heavy, I look back. My heart will stop beating. I saw a tall and pale women with a muscular body. She must be around 7ft+


After that cat and mouse game started. She dash towards me. I run as fast as I kind back and forth of the town block. My feet almost giveup but I knew i need to keep running.

After that I took a dive in the bushescand wait there. She didnt find me. Im glad.

Just then I heard someone crying. Just couple of yard behind me. A silhouette of a girl in the dark. She look as pale as the other girl, but I knew her. She is the girl I prank before.

She looks at me and suddenly smile revealing her sharp teeth. Im done.

She jump at me and end up at the top of me. I cant resist, she is to strong. Just as I thought Im about to die,I remember the riddle.
(To end something, one should look back at the starting)

That is it. I know.

Im the one who start it so I must end my own suffering. I stop resisting. She also stop biting my arm. Suddenly a bright flash come.

"Lucky eh? She forgive you ehh?"

The old lady again.

"You overcome the fear of death, she forgive you. You will be a great father"

I dash my way out and everything seem normal again.

Finally peace.

I hope other man can overcome their fear so that they might save themself in other day.
