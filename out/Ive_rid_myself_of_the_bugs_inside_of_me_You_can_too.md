I am the system. Auto-cannibalistic in nature. 

My frame has grown blue-brittle.

My wires run deep and my brain shits cobalt.

I am a hideously mutated amalgamation of the attempt my neurotransmitters made, and attempt, I say, not even close to solution, of what they look like. A self-portrait of bugs that can’t see themselves. Just a collection of images, ideas, limbs and meat pasted and smeared across a frame, strung together by wires, puppeteered by bugs.

Bugs, not quite insects, but with no other feasible way to describe their form. Bugs, because bugs run my thoughts, and if they can’t view themselves, they can’t project a picture of what they are for me to recoil from and vomit to. Bugs, wild and indifferent, both impulsive and destructive, yet fiercely protective against only that of my own hand. Bugs, and nothing more. 

I’ve grown quite tired of their company. I would like to carve them out.

But I’m turbulent. Dizzy. One might even go as far as to say, indecisive. Everyone knows this. It’s a thing. 

But no one wants to help. They’re all the same. Systems blown and blown in two ways. Blasted and definitely blasted. Bugs getting their nipples sucked. 

But I discovered you. A lucky one-in-ten. Escort of an escort, resulting from my anything-but-guilty pleasures. A minty-fresh breath of mutual air. Well, as I found out, not so common. 

But for now, call us twins.

And this twin of mine, you told me you felt the same way at first. You can feel the bugs too. Pecking at your paper-thin skin and chewing on the walls of your tubes. Crawling through the chinks of your plating, through your circuits, in that spot right between the drywall. Infesting your lobes with louse. You told me all they did was scratch at you, all times of the day, all days of the week. You asked me what I thought of them. I told you I find them pungent, putrid and pervasive.

You told me they turned you on.

“I’ve been awake for two and a half weeks on methamphetamine and I’m bored.”

I don’t know why I called you to come over. Usually I switch out someone new every night, maybe the same two nights in a row if they’re really that good, but this is my sixth time with you. I can’t get you out of my head. You don’t cost pennies either, but I *am* paying for your flesh after all. I guess I just relate to you and that brings its own comfort.

“I’m craving something fresh.”

You adjust your legs on my bright purple satin ottoman. The small gap in your thighs grows wider with every word. The lights are dim. You told me the first time that we met, you hate lights. All of them, any kind. Fluorescent, even candles. I turned them down for you tonight. But no matter how much you beg, I still need to see you. I really need to see you. So the bare bulb dangling above us stays on.

You stretch and lay yourself back. Your voice bounces around my tiny apartment.

“I kinda want to, you know, assimilate.”

“What do you mean?”

“Be in someone. Not through their holes but their everything. Like a sponge absorbing water.”

You groan and reach over to turn off my radio. The couch squeaks. 

“Listening to this feels like dying of mercury poisoning.”

The dial clicks. The room is drowned in silence. I have to ask.

“What do your bugs feel like?”

You don’t sit up to look at me. You don’t say a word. You smell like onion. I ask another question.

“How have you been holding up lately?”

You sigh. You stand up and pace around the room. Toes sifting between the thick, ingrown hairs of my shag carpet. You walk to my kitchen. I call it a kitchen, but it’s really just a sink and an oven. A kitchen has life to it, and mine has a toaster oven.

You grab a mug from my cabinet. It’s my favourite mug, the one with the pink cats dancing. I think I like it because it has pink cats dancing on it. My sink grunts and spews.

You fill up the mug, and walk back through my apartment. You don’t take a single sip, or even bring your lips close to the rim, before you are seated on my cushions. Then, you empty the mug without stopping once to breathe, and don’t say *ah* afterwards. You look at me and I wonder how I ended up here. You lick your lips.

“I don’t want you to move. I want you to stay right where you are, sitting on that wooden chair, and don’t move a muscle. Don’t speak. Don’t make any guttural noises. If you can, don’t breathe. If you can’t, don’t bother, because the noise you make when you choke is obnoxious. You are going to sit there and watch me, with no expression on your face, while I touch myself, until I tell you that you can move again.”

I nod.

“I said, no moving.”

You pull off your robe. I’ve seen you enough times now that it doesn’t have an effect on me. But you glow a bit, under this single bulb. I can’t help but want a body like yours. The gap in your thighs grows again, the space itself flexing. And just like every time, I’m pulled into your world. Your mesmerizing, tanned world and I can’t take my eyes off of you, even if I wanted to. 

“I knew this girl once. Back in high school. We called her Worm, because everyone in class found out that she had a tapeworm. She went to the nurse’s office a lot. I think she took pills.”

You start slow. Your veins bulge and your face twitches. 

“Apparently, it was severe. She got it from a piece of raw salmon, her brother said, and she screamed throughout the night. Shrill, piercing, blood-curdling, inhumane screeches of pain, every other hour. Every night. But she was fine in the morning, ate cereal like nothing ever happened. The worm did too.”

This should be boring. I’ve done so many more extreme acts. I flagellate myself with a thin copper rod every Sunday. I had my middle toe on my left foot severed. But this, something about this simple act of watching and not being able to move, it’s stirring something scalding hot deep inside my gut. You let a slight gasp escape your lips and shift your neck.

“She got *real* skinny. That’s how everyone at school found out, because how else was she getting so skinny so quickly? This girl, she didn’t get bullied for her, or herself, she got bullied for a bug inside her, and really, the bug was the one getting bullied. And so it was kind of right, in a way. Because they don’t really deserve to live, any more than we do. That’s how we all started anyway.”

Your eyes burrow into mine.

“Humanity. Just bugs and termites.”

Your movements become swift and controlled. Quick strokes, but a firm grip. Your words are laced with acid, as if every syllable boils on your tongue before being spat out.

“The worms ate all of her food. Salami sandwich, cheese and crackers. All down their little gullets. And when they finally stopped, she was a skeleton. And no one really laughed about Worm anymore. I never laughed once. It was pathetic. Creatures born only to feed, gluttonous chroming of fucking *life*.”

On that last word, you come. It’s short, you shake a little, and in a moment you take your hand off yourself and smear semen into my cushions. Did you even feel it? You look me up and down.

“I am that girl from high school, all grown up. I’m Worm. And I don’t deserve to live any more than she did, any more than the worm did. None of us have ever served a purpose, and how could we ever? God created man in order to beset a better world. So I can’t hate them. Because, if we really step back and take a look at everything, all in all, I am just a worm.”

Worm stands up, already soft, and drag yourself over to my kitchen again. 

“You can move now, if you want. If you don’t, that’s okay too.”

I blink. 

“Do you think we’re the same too?”

The question seems to freeze you in place. You turn your eyes to me, but I can’t discern anything from them. Nothing even resembling an emotion. Worm, have you ever experienced emotion?

“How so?”

I cross my hands over my lap. For some idiotic, child-like reason, I feel the need to cover myself. Is it that I don’t want you to see how much I enjoyed watching you? Or is there some sense of shame, about the bugs that scuttle within me, perhaps different from yours? I cross my legs with the thought. 

“Aren’t we both people of service? You, a whore, me, a waiter? Aren’t we both serving the same sorts of deities? Isn’t there any kind of kindling between us?”

I sound desperate. You don’t want anything to do with me. Worm speaks.

“I suppose you’re right. Acts of service. Humans serving humans. Bugs serving bugs. Working class tarantulas. I have a question for you. You are going to answer it.”

Of course I will.

“Do you want me to free you from your bugs?”

“Yes. Please, I want them out of me. Cut me open, scalp me, I don’t care. I want them gone.”

“Okay.”

You sit down across from me again. Worm motions to the cushions beside you. I stand up, covering myself, still hard.

“Lie down. Face to the ceiling.”

I do as you say.

Worm strips off my clothes. I’ve never felt so naked before. I’m diagnosed, if you didn’t know. That’s why I call your line, that’s why I live in this brick of mud shithole. I thought I was different from everyone else because of my bugs, or my bugs made me different from everyone else, but finally, I’m understood. You’ve scoured every recess and inch of my soul.

You pull out a pair of thin, long tweezers. Skeletal, angular, stainless-steel. Jagged charred chopsticks. What reason would someone have to own tweezers so long? 

You grasp me. I can’t help but squirm in your hand. Your other hand grabs my shoulder.

“Same as before. Do not speak. Do not move.”

This time, I don’t even feel the slightest urge to.

Your thumb and index pinch the head, and spread it open slightly. Just enough. Just enough for those rigged, oh so rigged, tweezers to slowly dip inside me. Slowly. Just a quarter of an inch at first, and the sensation is so powerful that I can’t help but flinch, and your grip tightens. You push the tweezers deeper. Half an inch. An inch.

It feels so deep inside me, inside some canal of red-soaked euphoria, phallic within phallic, and within that immense pleasure comes pressure and the tweezers are so deep inside of me now that I cannot fathom the idea of metal rods in me but twin snakes, worming their way through my bladder, and in that very moment, where I feel your tweezers pinch at a tiny piece of my skin, or what I assumed to be my skin, and where I realized that a worm can be more than just a name, but a bug, and that inside of me there can be more than just bugs but you, that you start to pull the tweezers back out. There’s resistance. Something pinched on the other end. My legs shudder. It burns white-hot. You study the tweezers in delight.

“You don’t even know where you are. Heaven on earth, I tell you. And you aren’t even appreciating it. You are experiencing the greatest, rawest cycle that has ever existed. Egregious visceral pain rewarded with nothing but more of it. A delicious trauma loop.”

You’re right. This is all I’ve ever wanted. I will bask in every second of it. 

There’s a tiny tapping along the sides, tapping that I soon realize is scuttling, which I soon realize is tiny little legs, and hundreds of them. Scaly backside, folding and fat. And as the first inch of metal tweezer pops out of me with a soft, barely audible *plap*, lathered in thin precum, the thing on the other end is longer. Dark brown and oily, the centipede’s head squirms out of me, and the hot pain and pure sensation makes me cross my legs tight. God, I knew they were real. I knew it. And God, does it turn me on to see the bugs plucked out from inside me.

Worm smiles down at me, and tells me you’ll pull all of it out, the centipede’s legs tickling me red rocket, until my mind is gone and my body is empty and so, so full.

Until my brain’s fixed.

Until my system’s [blown.](https://www.instagram.com/benhohener/)
