“Man, I’m tired.” Kip whines, his boots thudding against the dirt path. I can’t see his face, but his back’s hunched over, shoulders slumping as he trudges along. “I want to crawl under a blanket and sleep for a whole week. Maybe two.”

“You need to shower first.” I say, keeping my eyes forward. “You stink.” Though in all honesty, so do I. A long day of hiking has us both sweat-drenched and worn out. Even the short trek back to the parking lot is starting to feel impossibly long, and it certainly doesn’t help that we can barely see where we’re going.

Tonight is especially dark. There’s not even a sliver of moon in the sky, leaving our surroundings drenched in darkness. My flashlight lets me see Kip’s silhouette and the trail we’re following, but it does nothing for the looming shadows around us.

It’s fine, though. I’ve walked this trail for years. It’s a pretty safe area. Even in the dark, the hike back is plenty relaxing. Surrounded by the chirps of crickets, the occasional owl hoot in the distance, and the slight breeze ruffling my hair, I almost feel like falling asleep on my feet. 

“Do you hear that?” Kip says.

“Hmm? What?”

“Listen!” He whispers, stopping in place. His head swivels around.

I frown and stop behind him. “I don’t hear anything.”

Kip shushes me, his posture stiff and alert.

I turn my flashlight to our surroundings, shining the pale light on tangled grass and tree trunks. Nothing out of the ordinary. Although, now that I’m paying attention, it has gotten oddly quiet. No more chirping sounds. All that’s left is the slight panting of our breaths and the soft rustling of clothing fabric against skin. It was like the world had stopped around us.

“Kip, what exactly do you hea-”

A shrill scream shatters the silence, followed by a high-pitched female voice. *HELP ME!*

I freeze, my eyes widening. My feet feel rooted to the ground, but Kip immediately breaks into a sprint, calling out a terse “Come on!” as he runs off the path.

“Kip, wait!” I turn around, swinging my flashlight just in time to see his silhouette disappearing into the treeline. My heart’s pumping and my hands are trembling. This is supposed to be a safe trail, dammit. I’ve never seen anything here larger than a rabbit. Why’d Kip have to run off like that? He doesn’t even have a flashlight. Why didn’t he wait for me?

I shake my head violently, trying to clear my thoughts. I should follow after him. It’s probably not a big deal. Maybe the girl just tripped and hit her head. Yeah. That’s probably what happened. I’m sure I got a first-aid kit somewhere in my backpack.

I urge myself forward in Kip’s direction. Stepping off the trail and between the trees, the pale light shows me just the swaying of the grass left in his wake. Even the sound of his footsteps has already faded into the night.

Alone in the dark, I take a deep breath and start running.

*HELP ME!* The person calls out again.

I focus on the sound of her voice. It reassures me—as long as she’s speaking, I know that she’s still fine. Obviously she wasn’t attacked by a bear or something, or she would’ve stopped shouting a while ago. It’s a stupid worry anyways. There isn’t a single bear within miles of this place.

“Kip!” I shout. No response. He’s a fast runner, and he had a long headstart. I’m sure he’ll get to her any moment now. Maybe he’s already by her side, waiting for me to call 911. His phone doesn’t get any service in this area. He told me that himself.

*HELP ME!*

The voice grows louder as I get closer to the source. The trees have begun to thin. I slow down to a walk, panting heavily into the night air, clenching my flashlight until my knuckles turn white.

Something isn’t right.

The voice doesn’t sound too far. If I run, I’ll reach it soon enough. Which means that, at the pace he was running, Kip should already be there. Even without light, it’s easy to tell where she is just based on sound. Once he gets there, I’m sure he’ll reassure her, tell her everything’s going to be alright, and then she won’t need to keep shouting anymore. That’s what should already be happening.

*HELP ME!*

So why hasn’t she stopped? And why is she always repeating the same two words? The same shrill desperation, the way she holds the “E” in “ME” for an extra second every time. Something about it seems so off. 

*HELP ME!*

The same words. Same pitch. Same tone.

I’m starting to feel oddly exposed, vulnerable. I flick a button on my flashlight, putting it into low power mode, dimming the beam. I’m trying to keep my footsteps quieter. This close, it’s also hard not to notice a slight tinny quality to the voice that I don’t really trust.

My skin prickles from the odd feeling that someone’s watching me. My breathing sounds far too loud in the deathly silence of the forest.

*HELP ME!*

An icy chill crawls up my spine as I’m struck with a horrific thought—no, a realization. I’m certain of it now. It is the same damn voice shouting every single time, as if somebody’s playing a recording on loop. There never was a person in distress, was there? Kip and I, we were being lured to a trap the whole time.

I turn off my flashlight entirely and back into a tree, slumping down into myself. Panting and shaking uncontrollably, I fumble in my pocket, pulling out my phone and holding it close to my chest. Covering it with my hands to prevent the screen’s light from leaking out, I switch it on. Scroll through my contacts. Tap on Kip’s name and say a quiet prayer.

He picks up on the second ring. Thank God. He’s alright. His voice comes booming out of the speakers. “Where are you?”

I scramble to lower the volume as I hiss back at the phone. “Kip, listen to me. We need to run. This might sound crazy, but it’s a goddamn trap. It’s not a person who needs our help, it’s just some- some kind of recording or whatever. I don’t know who the fuck is out there and I don’t want to find out.”

There’s a long pause. Does he not believe me? I continue, “Just… you’ve gotta be close by, right? I’m guessing you were trying to follow the sound in the dark. Come find me first, okay? I’m hiding by a tree. Don’t worry, I’ll turn on my flashlight so you can see me.”

“Where are you?” He asks again.

“I mean, I don’t know exactly where, but if you walk around-”

“Where are you?”

My breath catches in my throat. All of a sudden, I feel very dizzy, and my ears are ringing loudly. Oh, right. Kip’s phone doesn’t have service, so we shouldn’t be talking right now. My phone slips from my hand. It bounces on the dirt and thuds against the ground somewhere off to the side. Kip’s voice calls out again, quieter, yet still clear enough that I can make out the same few words. The same pitch. Same tone.

Just like a recording being played on loop.
