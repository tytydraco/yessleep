Humans are drawn to what frightens us. We can’t help it, it’s in our nature. Sure, we all have our different reasons for it. Some people love the adrenaline rush. Some people want to prove something to themselves. Some people are just morbidly curious. But, ultimately, it’s just a fact of our biology, even if we don’t realize it. It’s why we love horror movies, haunted houses, and, of course, scary stories. It’s why you’re reading this right now.

I have thalassophobia. For the unacquainted, thalassophobia is a fear of deep waters, the sort you might find in a large lake or an ocean. As a child, I struggled even to look at photos of deep, empty water without gagging. 

Thalassophobia manifests differently in different individuals. Some people are scared of drowning, some worry about shark attacks, and some simply hate the idea of being in a place where you could be surrounded by nothing but empty water for miles and miles.

For me, though, thalassophobia is a fear of the unknown. I’m not afraid of the water, the loneliness, or any of the creatures that inhabit it. Instead, I’m afraid of what *might* be there. In a place so large, anything could be lurking beyond the range of the camera, unfathomable monsters hiding just past our field of view. I’m not afraid of what we *know* is there. I’m afraid of what we don’t.

Given what I’ve just explained, I hope you can understand why I decided to become a marine biologist. I’ve had to justify it to friends and family dozens of times since I announced my chosen career path. It seemed so illogical to them, knowing how deeply I hated the ocean, that I would choose one of the only career paths that would force me into it. But, to me, it seemed perfectly sane. After all, the only way to combat the unknown is to further our understanding. Studying the ocean, to me, was a way of facing my fear. Of conquering it. 

What I didn’t understand yet is that there are some unknowns that are too great to be beaten. After all, we evolved a sense of fear for a reason, and, sometimes, chasing after that fear can get you hurt. But we’ll get to that. 

I work in the Ceto Research Station. You probably haven’t heard of it, unless you happened to work on the project during the design process. The company I work for, Aquitech, is still relatively small, and we’ve been trying to keep news of the station under wraps while still in the testing phase. Ceto is a state-of-the-art underwater research facility, the likes of which has never been seen before. You may be familiar with the Aquarius Reef Base, the only other facility that has ever come close to Ceto’s brilliance. In terms of layout, the two are similar. Both have a main lab area, a few small beds, and an airlock, through which researchers are able to enter and exit the marine environment safely. When inside the base, the surrounding water is only visible through a few small portholes in order to minimize weak points in the structure. 

However, there is one key feature that separates Ceto from any other marine research station. Most facilities either float atop the water, like those on boats, or sit on the seabed beneath the surface, like Aquarius. Ceto, however, does neither. Instead, using an ingenious device somewhat like a fish’s swim bladder, the station maintains itself at a steady 40 meters below the ocean’s surface. It is this device that makes Ceto so special, and this device that allows the base to study an as-yet largely inaccessible landscape: the open ocean.

I can still remember the thrill that rushed through me when I found out that I was going to be part of the initial team stationed aboard Ceto. I, along with Drs. Bill Emerson, Farah Singh, and Liza Milford, 3 other prominent marine biologists, would be with the station through its initial descent, and we would stay with it throughout its first week of operation. During this time, we would ensure that Ceto was fully functioning in its technological capacity while simultaneously conducting our own marine research. 

I was particularly excited to learn that Dr. Emerson would be aboard as well. Bill and I had been good friends since graduate school, and we had joined the Aquitech team together after learning of the startup's existence. Thinking back on those first moments, sitting next to each other as the station was lowered beneath the waves and chatting enthusiastically about our hopes for our research, I can still feel the tingle of nervous excitement that seemed to pulse through my every nerve.

The placement of the station went off without a hitch. As we sank into the Atlantic, I kept waiting for something to go awry. 40 meters was fast approaching, and I couldn’t stop imagining what would happen if the buoyancy system failed to activate. Logically, I knew that we were still attached to the boat, and they would be able to hoist us back to the surface if anything was amiss. But I could still see it so clearly in my mind's eye, the station sinking down and down, into the dark, empty blue below.

Luckily, right on cue, the system whirred to life, and we were delighted to find ourselves hovering at the proper depth, with no sign of shifting significantly up or down. After they were satisfied that we were staying put, the dive team detached us from the boat, and, just like that, we were on our own. 

That first day was blissful. We were all still high on the station’s successful launch, and we spent those initial hours exploring the tiny space, testing out the dive equipment, and preparing our research plans for the upcoming week. As the day drew to a close, I remember feeling very tired and slightly nauseated. I chalked it up to the sudden change in environment and the excitement of the day, and I went to bed that night ready to begin my research the next day.

Unfortunately, it was not to be. I woke the next morning feeling generally awful, with a bad headache, a low-grade fever, and chills. Of all the places to come down with the flu, I would place a submerged research station among one of the worst. Not only did I have to deal with my symptoms while trapped with 3 other people in a space roughly the size of a trailer, but I was now facing the prospect of having to spend my entire week aboard the station cooped up in my bunk, with no time for any of the research that I had come here to conduct.

I spent most of that second day moping around, holed up either on my uncomfortable cot or in the station’s single small bathroom. Using our satellite internet system, we had updated the mainland team on my condition, but they informed us that, due to the difficulty and cost of sending a retrieval team, they would only come and pick me up if my condition worsened considerably or other crew members became ill. My fellow researchers tried to sympathize with me, but they were largely preoccupied with their own blossoming research projects, and, though they tried to hide their excitement from me, it still stung to watch them go out on dives, return with samples, and perform lab analysis, all while I was laid out on my bed feeling like a dead slug. 

That evening, however, Bill called me over to the monitor desk, saying that he had something to cheer me up. I just barely managed to sling my all too heavy limbs over the side of my bunk and trudge my way over to him, my fevered brain grumbling bitterly at my sudden movement. However, all complaints were momentarily wiped from my mind as I saw what he was pointing at. 

The control panel, along with several other small screens displaying various information about Ceto’s systems, had a small sonar display. It’s the kind you always see in movies, with the spinning green line and shaded areas indicating any objects nearby. Since we were suspended in the ocean, we would ordinarily not expect to see much in the way of shading, save for the occasional passing school of fish. 

The thing that Bill was indicating, however, was not behaving like a school of fish. Fish typically create a fast moving blob that constantly changes shape as the individual fish move around. This shape seemed to hardly move at all. It rested right on the border of the sonar’s detection range, partially cut off by the edge of the display, and it seemed to have consistent edges, like it was a single, solid object.

“What is it?” I remember asking.

“I think it’s a whale,” he said. 

“Only one? Shouldn’t it be with a pod?”

“I mean, they could still be out of range, but yeah, I think it’s just one.”

“Why?”

“Have you heard of the 52-hertz whale?”

“Yeah, sure, but those recordings were taken in the Pacific. You think that whale somehow managed to get around Cape Horn?”

“Obviously it’s not the same whale. But it sure looks like *a* whale, doesn’t it? And you know what’s even better? Our hydrophones got it too.” He grinned enthusiastically. “Wanna listen?”

I nodded as quickly as my throbbing neck would allow me, as he pulled up the recording and pressed play. The audio’s signature definitely looked like whale song, and, for the most part, it sounded like it too. But I could hear why he’d drawn the comparison to the 52-hertz whale. The size of the splotch on the sonar screen suggested a very large whale, likely a blue whale if that’s really what it was. But the song definitely didn’t sound completely like that of a blue whale. Unlike 52 Blue, it wasn’t like it was consistently higher or lower pitched than what you would expect. Instead, it seemed to move erratically between many frequencies, speeding up and slowing down at odd intervals. It sounded like. . . like something trying very hard to sound like a whale.

As this thought occurred to me, I shivered, feeling some of that familiar childhood fear start to bubble up in my stomach. 

“It’s kinda creepy.”

He laughed and shooed me away, saying that I should go get some rest. Tired as I was, I struggled to get sleep that night. I just kept hearing that sound in my head and imagining the thing that could be making it, waiting out there in the dark, empty sea.

The next day was much the same. My illness had worsened, and the day passed in a blur of delirium. The main thing that I recall is that the creature appeared again that night in the same place, just on the edge of our sonar. And it called again, that same, stilted imitation of whale song that stung my ears and made my skin crawl.

On the fourth day, I was feeling slightly better. Not enough that I could do anything particularly useful yet, but enough that I started to go a little stir crazy in my tiny bunk. By the end of the day, I was feeling very bored, with only the slow, shoddy satellite internet to entertain me. That’s why, as night started to fall outside, I walked over to see what Bill was doing, even though I already knew what it was that he would be staring at. 

Sure enough, there he was, glued to the sonar screen again. And sure enough, there it was, a blinking green smudge just on the edge of the display. Bill turned to me.

“I’m gonna go and see it.”

This startled me a bit, and I was quick to voice my aversion to the idea.

“Dude, are you crazy? It’s pitch black out there!”

“I have a light,” he said, wiggling his dive flashlight in front of me. “Besides, I’ll have you to spot me. Make sure nothing goes wrong.”

It was standard practice to have one person stay at the control panel while the others were out diving. That way, they could monitor the radios and the timing for each dive, making sure that everyone was safe while they were out of the station. While I was happy to spot him if he was absolutely set on going, I tried one last time to talk him out of it.

“I just. . . I really don’t think it’s a good idea.”

He groaned. “Come on man. Really? It’s not like it’s anything dangerous. Worst that can happen is that I show up there and find a big old pile of garbage or something. And if it is a whale, it might be asleep. I mean, how cool would it be if I was able to see it up close? Maybe it’ll be a new species or something. Just trust me, I’ll be fine.”

With that, he strode out of the control room and towards the airlock. I sighed and settled into the cramped chair. As he readied himself for the dive, he joked into the mic about a ghost whale that was going to eat him the moment he stepped out of the station. I yawned, listening as the airlock did its automated pressurization, and, for just a moment, I let my eyes slip closed.

God, I’m such a horrible scientist. A horrible friend. I guess I didn’t realize just how sick I still was, how fatigued my illness had made me. But that’s no excuse. I fell asleep. I don’t know if things would have turned out differently if I hadn’t, maybe I couldn’t have done anything anyway but. . . 

I woke to the sound of speaking in my ear. I was horribly disoriented and groggy, with no idea of how long I’d been asleep. My back was sore from the uncomfortable sleeping position, and my mouth was horribly dry. As I struggled to get my bearings, I heard the voice again. 

“Dude. Dude!”

“Ugh. . . yeah. Yeah! Oh god, Bill, I’m so sorry. I think I fell asleep.”

“Hey man, it’s ok. It’s totally fine. I’m alright. But you gotta come and see this.”

“What?”

“The whale. Dude, it’s nothing like I’ve ever seen. I can’t even begin to describe it. It’s gonna be the find of the century. You have to come and see.”

I was much more awake now, and I was better able to focus on what Bill was saying. 

“Uh, I’m not sure I should do that. Can you just. . . can you just come back in and tell me about it?”

“No, seriously, it’s incredible. Singh and Milford are already out here. You have to come see for yourself. Don’t you wanna have any fun while we’re stationed out here? Come on, just come outside. Come outside.”

I’ll admit, he’d seriously started to convince me for a minute there. I was strongly considering grabbing a flashlight and a SCUBA suit and joining him, abandoning my silly, irrational fear. But something about that last thing he said gave me pause. And, as I started to think it all through again, I felt a jolt of horror shoot up my spine. 

“Come on dude, just come out here.”

I turned my head to look at the display on the wall next to me. This one was meant to monitor activity in the airlock, logging when people entered and exited the station. We mostly used it to monitor dive times, ensuring that no one was out longer than the 30 minute window of oxygen time in which diving could be safely performed, allowing for decompression and recompression times in the airlock. The screen showed Bill’s initial departure from the station, around 9:45 PM. It also showed Singh and Milford leaving, about 10 minutes later. None of them had re-entered the station yet.

“Come outside.”

The screen also showed how long each of the divers had been out. The dive time flashed, big and red, right next to each airlock opening time. 

“Come on, it’s so cool.”

I guess I’d been asleep longer than I thought. I mean, by all accounts, what I was seeing was impossible, but there’s no reason that this system should be malfunctioning, not when it had been working perfectly the whole time we’d been down here so far. It said that the divers had been out there for 6 hours. I peeked through the doorway to the sleeping quarters, and, sure enough, all the others’ bunks were empty. I stared in terrified disbelief at the screen again. 

Even stretched to its limit, the oxygen in those tanks could only last 45 minutes, at the absolute maximum. If what I was seeing was real, if it wasn’t some sort of dream or horrible hallucination, then my friends were dead. And whatever it was that was speaking to me through the radio couldn’t be Bill.

“Come and see.” That awful, distorted voice crackled in my earpiece again, and I threw it to the floor. I dry heaved, my stomach starting to fail me as my eyes flicked to the sonar scanner. Christ. The whole thing was glowing green. The. Whole. Thing. Whatever it was that was out there was enormous. Bigger than the station, bigger than a blue whale, bigger than ANYTHING we’ve ever discovered before. And it was right outside. 

I ran for the bathroom, the urge to vomit becoming stronger by the second. Before I got there, though, I made the mistake of looking through the small porthole that was visible through the doorway to the sleeping quarters. It was dark. Of course, you’d expect it to be dark, given that it was still the very early hours of the morning, but . . . 

I don’t really know how I knew, but I could tell that it wasn’t the right kind of dark, ya know? It wasn’t like I was looking out on the dark waters of the night time ocean. It was like. . . like I was looking at something blocking the window. 

I spent the rest of the night and a good part of the morning curled up on the bathroom floor, heaving into the small toilet and sobbing uncontrollably. By the time I had pulled myself together and gathered the courage to peek out of the bathroom door, it was almost midday. The flicker of relief I felt when I saw the clear, bright ocean through the porthole was small, but it was enough to pull me out of my hiding spot and force me to take action. 

I contacted Aquitech, telling them that there had been a terrible accident, that all my colleagues had been killed. I told them that I needed to be retrieved as fast as possible, and they said that they would have a rescue team out to me within a day. 

As I’m posting this, I’m still inside Ceto. I’m hoping that whatever shred of internet I have out here will let me get this to you. I just need to make sure that you get this warning, that you don’t make the same mistakes that I have. 

Sometimes, fear is justified. Sometimes, you should listen to that creeping feeling in your gut. Don’t investigate that strange noise. Don’t go out looking in those woods. And, for God’s sake, don’t assume that you know what that thing is, no matter what you think it looks like. 

We thought it was a whale, but it wasn’t. It was an anglerfish. 

The rescue team will be here early tomorrow morning, but I’m not sure I’ll make it that long. It’s dark beyond the porthole, that same, horrible darkness from last night. Sitting here on my bunk, I can hear my colleagues again. They’re calling to me, voices multiplied a hundred times over, through the radio, through the walls. They’re very persuasive. And they’re telling me to come outside.
