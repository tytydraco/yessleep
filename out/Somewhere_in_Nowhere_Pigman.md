[Pigs](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1h0leke/somewhere_in_nowhere_the_rot/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) can be very dangerous animals. There’s a reason why Dorothy’s uncle freaked out when she fell into the pigpen in The Wizard of Oz.

I’m not talking about wild boars, either. Farm pigs aren’t aggressive or carrying some zombie plague (as far as I know), but the danger lies in their appetite. Anyone who lives on a farm with them for even just a few days knows that they are definitely not herbivores. They’ll eat just about anything, all the way up to human bones. I guess that’s one way to get your calcium. 

Now, don’t get me wrong, if you fall into a pigpen, you’re more than likely going to be alright, as long as the fall doesn’t knock you out. But let’s say the back of your head hits the ground particularly hard. You’re unconscious. A group of even slightly hungry pigs will probably start with your clothes, boots, hair, and maybe even your ears. But if you give them long enough, once they’ve got going, they’ll do much more permanent damage.

My maternal great-grandfather was a pig farmer. One day in a record-temperature July, he got a bad case of heat stroke and did just that. He was passed out in that pigpen for an hour and a half before my great-grandmother found him and rushed him to the hospital. He lived, but he lost three fingers, had been given plenty of scars that would never fully heal, and had to walk with a cane for the rest of his life. 

Why am I telling you all this? Well, suffice it to say, I would rather cover myself in ketchup and honey and take a long nap in a commercial pig sty than have to look out of my kitchen window at night and see that Pigman standing in the fields one more damn time. 

Before I make it sound like I hate pigs, I don’t. All domesticated animals come with their own dangers, and most won’t hurt you unless you somehow give them the opportunity, even unintentionally. There’s something to be said about the intelligence and even kindness of the humble swine. But that... thing. It was different. Every time I caught sight of the shine of its dewy, misshapen eyes in the darkness, I felt sick to my stomach.

Hamlet squealed and put his little hooves on my chest as if he could read my thoughts and was pleading his little piggy case. I sat the brush down and scooped him into my arms, rocking him like a babe.

“Oh, you’re not gobbling up anyone’s fingers, are you, little guy?”

He squirmed around and oinked like a giant porky worm, and I gave him a slice of apple before letting him go. Dawson was always bringing apples over now, and the animals loved it. I wouldn’t admit it to him, but so did I.

I gave Hamlet back to his appreciative mother and brushed off the seat of my overalls. The afternoon sweltered, even in the shade of the barn, and my throat was dry. I made sure everyone had plenty of water before going back toward the house. Maybe Aunt Jean could pull some sweet iced tea out of a pocket dimension because I’d forgotten to make more. Dawson was going to kick my ass when he made it over for dinner. 

A glass of tea with a lemon slice was waiting on the kitchen table when I went inside, like I’d tupla’d it up. Reading minds would’ve been the least surprising thing Aunt Jean was capable of. I gave it a cursory poison sniff, drank it down, and then popped the lemon slice into my mouth, rind and all. No sense in wasting it.

As soon as I was hydrated, my body immediately decided to ruin it all and jones for a cigarette. 

“Hey, Aunt Jean?” I called up the stairs. “Thanks for the tea; I’m gonna step out for a smoke real quick. Don’t forget Dawson will be over in a few hours!”

The only audible response was the steady creak of the rocking chair starting up again upstairs. If she had spoken, I no doubt would’ve heard her call out, “I’ll wear my best, chickadee.”

I rolled a fresh cigarette and stepped outside with my zippo. A faint, musty scent clung to the breeze like a fat tick, and as I looked out to the field, I remembered the rotted roots of some of the corn stalks. My stomach twisted into a double pretzel knot. 

It’s one of the worst feelings in the world to know something is going terribly wrong, something that will affect you severely, and not be able to do anything about it. My crop, sewn with my own blood, sweat, and diesel, was dying. As far as I could tell, I’d done nothing wrong or different than usual besides my land being host to “the Evil.” 

At that moment, I told myself that no, I wouldn’t sit back and watch it happen. I’d do everything short of black magic to save that corn. Surely, Two-Tooth Steve had something helpful and questionably legal to offer me.  

As I shifted my gaze upward from the exceptionally nasty-looking patch, I saw him. 

The Pigman had never been out in the day like this before. But there he was, standing with his hammer over his shoulder and staring at me with those inky eyes. He was an even worse sight to behold in clear light. I could see every greasy wrinkle and every pit where his skin settled wrong. 

I sat on the porch railing, lit the cigarette, and lifted it to my mouth. I needed it then more than ever. 

As I blew a cloud of smoke out of my nose, the Pigman began to move. I looked on in stunned silence as he walked to the edge of the cornfield. We held eye contact for what felt like ages. The cigarette burned down to ash in my hand, and the wind whistling through the stalks was the only sound other than my heavy breathing. Was he going to run up here? Was this it? Would he charge me, pick me up, and chew me down to the bone?

As my life flashed before my eyes for the… let’s face it, I’m not counting anymore, all I could think of was Dawson and how much it was going to suck for him to find my mangled corpse when he came over for dinner. I would’ve gone through the reverse a thousand times if he didn’t have to even once. I couldn’t deny that he was sweet; he didn’t deserve to see shit like that.

The near silence was suddenly broken when the Pigman let out a squeal-scream so loud that he leaned forward into it. Birds took flight in terror from the pines in the distance, and I jumped so hard that I fell forward and hit the ground three feet below. I clutched at my knee and groaned in pain like some fat guy who tripped over a mailbox. The Pigman just watched me, making odd snuffling noises that might’ve been the pig equivalent of giggles. 

I pushed myself to my feet and started limping toward the cornfield with my skinned knee. That tore it; I was about to give this swine behind a piece of my mind. 

“What the fuck is wrong with you, huh?! Why do you like to torture me, you creep?! Why can’t you just leave?! You aren’t paying rent! Go somewhere else!”

I met him at the edge of the field and quickly realized that I’d never been this close to him. The stink of old blood overwhelmed the rotting corn scent, and I felt my breakfast threatening to come back for a visit. Slanted pig teeth, stained brown, poked out from a snout that looked like it was melting. His eyes sat even farther in the sockets than I’d initially thought, giving the whole thing the appearance of a cheap, two-sizes-too-big latex mask. His fingers were crusted with dirt, and his nails were bitten down to bloody quicks. One ear had begun to mold, and the other bore a small yellow livestock tag, which I couldn’t read. As I took it all in, a fly crawled in through his nostril and out of his eye. 

I thought faintly about running back to the house, but anger beat out fear. 

“You need to find some other farmer to bother! I’m not taking your shit anymore!”

Without considering the consequences for longer than a second, I broke the barrier between us and stepped into the cornfield. The old blood smell grew fresh and overwhelming. All around me, I could suddenly hear the tramping of hooves and the screaming of pigs. Not oinking or squealing— this was a slaughterhouse cry. I tried to step back but froze when I heard something entirely different above the noise.

“Leave, Newport. You have no place on this land,” called out a male voice. Unlike everything else, it came from inside my head. It was harsh but… familiar. It conjured a face and a name in my head, but I couldn’t make either out. All I saw was blurry shapes and colors. The puzzle pieces that filled the gaps in my memories were lost in a woodchipper. 

I didn't know who was talking to me, but boy did I give them a piece of my mind. 

“Fuck you. This land, this house, these animals all need me. This is my home. I belong here.”

The hoofbeats got louder, and I felt something hard come down on my ankle. When I fell to the ground, all bets were off. Hit after hit, all over my body, pigs I couldn’t even see ground their feet into my skin as they trampled all over me. I could feel the gritty dirt they left on me with each step, and I choked on the dust they kicked up. 

When the onslaught was over, not an inch of my skin was left unbruised and sore. The only thought in my mind was that I’d like to see Dawson try to put an ice pack on all this! Maybe that was just a coping mechanism, though.

I staggered up to my feet, pretty sure my ankle was sprained to hell, and immediately fell back to my knees and puked. There wasn’t a lot left in me to come up, but it still managed to make it out of my nose. I got up again and ran for the house, sparks of pain shooting up my leg as I hit the porch steps and coughed up more stomach acid. 

I took the stairs two at a time, racing down the hallway. I nearly had a head-on collision at high speed with the shower as I rocketed into the bathroom. I felt dirty and sick, and the countless bruises stung like wildfire. I stood in the cold stream of water, not even bothering to take off my clothes. Rivulets the color of rotten fruit swirled down the drain as I wept into my hands. My shirt stuck to me like pine tar as I struggled to pull it off. 

An indeterminate amount of time passed. It was only Dawson’s voice that pulled me out of disassociation. I realized with some shock that I was *so* glad he was here. At some point, I’d ended up on the bathroom floor. My injured ankle was still hanging over the tub’s edge, and the water was ice cold.

“Hey, do you need some help there? I brought pie, and I feel like the floor isn’t the best place to enjoy it. I won’t stop you if that’s what you want, though. Where’d you get all those nasty bruises?”

I just nodded, and he took that as permission to help me to my feet and wrap a towel around me. If he had any thoughts about my impromptu coming out, he didn’t voice them. I’d never been that good at modesty, and he probably knew from the beginning. 

“Seriously, though. What happened?”

He helped me into my room and made me sit down on my bed. I rubbed my swelling eye. 

“I, uh, fell. Into my tractor.”

Dawson raised an eyebrow at me but didn’t question it. He’d only been in my room a few times before that, and I was surprised by how completely unbothered by his presence there I had become. 

“This wardrobe looks like it leads to Narnia,” he said, swinging the door open and looking through my collection of overalls and thrift store t-shirts. 

“Yeah, my great-grandfather made it. If you climb in there and stay long enough, it’ll probably take you *somewhere*.”

Dawson snooped through my outfits, pausing to look at each one.

“I think it would just take me to Overall Land. I swear, I’ve never seen so many pairs in one place!”

I couldn’t help but grin.

“You’re one to talk, kitty cat princess socks.”

Dawson scoffed.

“Well fuck me for having a sense of childlike whimsy every now and again.”

As I slipped on my boxers, Dawson tossed me my favorite overalls (don’t ask me how he knew), and the *Cheese is My Passion* shirt. The yellow fabric felt cool against my bruises. I looked around, and it was like everything reset. I felt the tension drain out of me as I laid back on the soft quilt Aunt Jean had made for me not long after moving in.

“Yeah, yeah, you and your whimsy,” I said with a long, cathartic sigh.

Dawson looked at me before glancing at the CRT TV sitting on my dresser in front of the bed. Then he said the four best words he could have at the moment.

“Wanna play Mario Kart?”

There are few questions that you can almost never say no to, and that was one of them. 

“That’s some whimsy I can get behind.”

Dawson handed me one of the controllers before making me scoot over on the bed.

“I know I said whimsy first, but can we stop now? It doesn’t sound like a word anymore.”

“We could, but I don’t think that would be very whimsical of us.”

Dawson nudged me in the ribs, enough to be annoying but not enough to aggravate my bruises. I stuck my tongue out at him. He tried to shove his finger in my nose. I faked biting at it.

Once we got serious, for the next thirty minutes, I kicked his ass at Mario Kart. Then we went downstairs.

I pushed my fork around my plate as we sat at the kitchen table with a glass of milk and a slice of pie each. I didn’t feel much like eating, but Dawson had baked it himself, so I took a few bites. It was delicious— honestly, one of the best slices of apple pie I’d ever tasted.

“I’m sorry I didn’t have dinner ready. I… I didn’t fall into my tractor.”

“I could’ve told you that,” Dawson said through a mouthful of pie.

“The Pigman tried to tenderize me into the main course, and I just… lost it after that, I guess. If you’ll give me a bit, I can—”

Dawson swallowed hard and thunked his fork down on the table. 

“The guy out in the field? He did this to you?”

Dawson had never really asked about the Pigman. Once he got the message that some weird shit just kind of exists around here, he quickly adapted to my method of just letting it be. But nothing besides the Rot had ever really hurt me before. Not on purpose, anyway. Beez had almost put my eye out more than a few times, but chickens will be chickens.

“Yeah, but—“

Dawson stood up from the table and started toward the door.

“Wait! Dawson, no!”

That asshole didn’t even listen to me for a second. He threw open the kitchen door and started marching toward the cornfield like the next super soldier or something. I ran after him.

“Dawson, the Pigman has been here for a long time. He’s bad juju! You saw what he did to me! I don’t know what he’ll do to you, so just leave him alone!”

I grabbed Dawson’s shoulder, and he stopped for a second.

“I’m not going to try and bodyslam him. But he hurt you, and I’m about to make sure he gets the message that he’s not gonna do it again.”

With that, he shook me off and kept going. I followed helplessly after him, dreading the bloodbath that I was sure would come. 

Without a note of hesitation, Dawson walked into the cornfield and right up to where the Pigman had retreated. He wasn’t immediately run over by a stampede of pigs, but something heavy and tense was in the air.

They both stood there for a minute, quiet and unmoving. Then Dawson stuck a finger out at him.

“You leave my friend alone, you uncultured swine! If you ever lay a hand on him again, I’ll punt you so hard you turn into vegan bacon!”

The Pigman walked closer to him, closing the distance between them to maybe a foot. I cringed and tried to pull Dawson back, but he was solid and unshakeable. He wasn’t going anywhere.

“You won’t touch him again! Do you hear me?!”

Even with Dawson raising his voice, the Pigman’s droopy face remained expressionless. But, to my horror, he raised a hand, ready to strike.

“Don’t hurt him! Please! He didn’t mean it!”

Dawson got into a fighting stance, ready to fight what was clearly a losing battle if need be. I’d still root for him.

“Did too! I totally meant it!”

As the Pigman’s gigantic, greasy hand rose above his head, I prepared for the worst. I knew what those fists could do. I could remember sitting out on the porch with my mother when she was still with me, watching as the Pigman snatched crows out of the air with his surprisingly agile hands, crushed their bodies in between his sausage-like fingers, and shoved their corpses into his dripping maw. The sight always made me nauseous enough to go back inside, but my mom only stared vacantly at him. 

“Show me what you got, Pork Chop,” Dawson taunted, and boy, did Pigman deliver.

Instead of Whack-a-Mole-ing him halfway into the ground, he opened his fingers. Only then did I notice two things I hadn’t before: that same musty carpet and dying plant smell in the air and the loop of rope around his middle finger. The protection talisman hung from his hand, and Dawson and I both stared in gut-wrenched shock.

We both turned at the same time and met with the same horrible sight. A trail of dead grass and swollen flies led up to the porch, where the door was swung open. In the distance, I heard the sounds of hooves on wood and the clack of old teeth. 

I didn’t really care about any of my belongings, but Aunt Jean was in there, and I didn’t know what this thing was capable of. It was time for *me* to make the dumb decision to protect the ones I loved. I sprinted toward the porch, Dawson hot on my heels. 

“GET OUT OF MY HOUSE, YOU POOR EXCUSE FOR A COMPOST HEAP!”

I threw a hand out in front of Dawson as we made it inside, ready to take the brunt of the attack if this thing was still here. The kitchen was in ruins. The last bits of my food were scattered across the floor, growing fat chunks of green and white mold with worms and ants feasting on the remotely edible parts. Aunt Jean was standing by the stairwell, unharmed but with a smear of dark dirt across her dinner dress and looking madder than a mule munching on bumblebees. 

“Bastard,” was all she said, in a deep, masculine voice you’d imagine coming from a Navy seal and not a tiny old granny. I looked over to Dawson, who’d moved to examine what remained of the pie he’d brought. I almost wished I hadn’t.

The crust was dried out to hell, and maggots writhed around in what remained of the apple filling. I’d taken out entire hornets’ nests and fed a grape to a spider as big as my hand, but maggots were the one thing I could not handle.

“Nope! Fuuuuuck that,” I said, stumbling back to where I couldn’t see the little white fuckers. But that proved impossible because even the half-eaten slices left on our plates were swarmed with them.

“It took everything.”

Dawson was right. All the pantry doors were open, and the fridge and freezer were barren. There wasn’t a single morsel of edible food left in my house. But that wasn’t what I cared about right now. I cared about the tremble in Dawson’s lip and how his voice shook just a little. I knew he’d worked hard on that pie. He’d done it for me, and so few people did things for me.

“Yeah, it did. It took your amazing pie, and I’m gonna TAKE ITS KNEECAPS!”

I stormed outside and shook my fist at the sky like I was making sure God herself was watching.

“YOU COME OUT HERE AND FACE ME, YOU FUCKING COWARD! I’M NOT GOING TO LET YOU HURT MY FRIEND OR KILL MY CROPS! DO YOU HEAR ME? OVER MY DEAD BODY!”

Apparently, the Rot was ready to accept that challenge. I watched the trail of black wind its way out of the cornfield and up to where I stood. As it rose out of the ground, our eyes locked, and it had me right where it wanted me.
