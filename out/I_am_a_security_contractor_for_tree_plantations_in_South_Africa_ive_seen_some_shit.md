**I am a security contractor for tree plantations in South Africa, and I have some stories that I think you might enjoy hearing about.**

For some background: I’ve been working in the security industry for about 15 years, with 9 of those spent working in and around plantations. My job primarily involves securing these vast, isolated areas from the occasional would-be thief (yes, people really do try to steal trees) and from illegal miners who try to set up their operations on our land. It’s not your typical security work, and the work itself is dangerous. Anyways with that out the way I will get into a few of my stories

 **Story #1**

It was just past 1 AM when we received an alert from our control room. One of our units had spotted an individual entering the plantation. Now, we’re no strangers to these calls. Guys often try to break in, heavily armed with AK-47s and R4 rifles. It’s dangerous work, but we’re used to it. So, as the area manager, I headed out to back up my officers.

When I arrived, I was met by the two guards stationed at this particular plantation. They were understandably shaken. They told me they had seen a single individual walking amongst the trees, heading up a path that led up the mountain. It was a remote area, dense with trees, and the chances of an armed encounter were high.

I sent the two guards around to the opposite side of the mountain in case the person decided to run. I made my way up the mountain alone, guided only by my flashlight. This was a few years ago, before we had night vision or drones, so it was just me and the dark.

I began scanning the tree line, trying to catch any movement. That’s when I saw it. At first, I thought my eyes were just fucking with me, but no—it was a person. Or at least, it looked like one. This "thing" was unnaturally thin, but its face really shook me up. It had two small dots where its eyes should have been, but no mouth, no nose, just an empty, featureless face. 

I shouted at it, "Dont You Fucking Move Motherfucker" But it didn’t listen. It just turned and started walking away, like it hadn’t heard a word I said.

I radioed to the guards on the other side of the mountain, letting them know what I’d seen. They should’ve been able to get there quickly—it would’ve taken anyone only about 8 or 9 minutes to reach the area. But when they called back, they said they hadn’t found anything. No trace, no sign of anyone or anything.

We brought in a K9 to search for any scent trail, hoping for something—anything—that could explain what I’d seen. But the trail ended. Suddenly. And without explanation.

I’ll be honest—I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was terribly wrong. The guards didn’t believe me. They thought I’d been seeing things. The K9 handler, though he found the whole thing strange, refused to believe my story too.

But I know what I saw. And to this day, I can’t shake the memory of that thing

 **Story #2**

This incident took place at another plantation we protect. It’s not as active as the others, and more like a guest house now. I was in the area at a residential property doing a routine site check with a trainee I had been paired with, when our control room alerted us to a positive break-in. This only happens when the cameras detect someone on site, and given the crimes that take place in rural areas, we don’t take these calls lightly.

My trainee and I immediately headed out. The guards on-site were clueless to the alert which pissed me off. This plantation is located in a mountainous area, and the fog that night was thick. We checked with the control room which camera pole was set off (Each camera pole has a designated number making it easy to locate and coordinate where a potential intruder was, These poles are only placed along the perimeter of a property)

I told the guards to stay put and keep an eye on things while my trainee and I moved toward the far side of the property. The sense of unease was building, and I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was wrong. The fog made it harder to see, but we kept moving towards the direction the camera pole was located at.

As we got closer, we began hearing something strange. At first, it sounded like the wind, but then I realized it was... screaming. Manic. Desperate. And the worst part? It didn’t sound like it was coming from a single direction. It was all around us. Above, below, to the left, to the right. The screaming echoed through the dense fog. It repeated over and over again, getting louder and more frantic.

At that moment, I felt the hairs on the back of my neck stand up. Something was wrong. It didn’t take a genius to realize this wasn’t a normal situation. I assumed we were walking into an ambush. I raised my rifle, and we froze, listening for any movement. But the screaming kept going, like a loop, frantic and unrelenting.

I immediately radioed back to our control room. “Check the heat signatures at pole 035G. Are we still reading anything on-site?” I gave our exact location, hoping for confirmation that this wasn’t just a mistake.

The response came back cold. “478 Central—Negative. No signatures.”

No heat signatures. Nothing.

That sent a chill down my spine. The screaming continued, but we couldn’t see anything nor could the control room. I told my trainee, trying to keep my voice steady, “Get the fuck out of here.”

We didn’t waste any time. We bolted back to the vehicle and indeed did "Get the fuck out of there" I couldn’t get that scream out of my head.

A week later, the trainee who had been with me that night handed in his resignation. He didn’t say much—just left. We never spoke about the incident again.

To this day, I can’t explain what happened out there. The way the screaming seemed to come from nowhere, the fact that we didn’t see anyone.

**Ending This Off:**

I do have some more stories of my own as well as stories i have heard from other so do let me know if you want some more stories :)
