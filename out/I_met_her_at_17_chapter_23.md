Chapter Two

Noah Evers was a popular kid—until he disappeared. Or, I guess it’s better to say he was popular up until the last two weeks before he disappeared. He had been the best player on the basketball team, or so I’ve been told. I never went to the games. He was dating Emma Jackson, the kind of girl a guy like me could only ever joke about having a chance with. Only now do I see she was her own person. I missed so many things when I was young.

Now, I wouldn’t say I was unpopular, nor was I as sad as those guys who painted their nails black and cut themselves after school, but I was about as close to being on the same level as Noah Evers as I was to touching the sun. That’s why it was such a shock when he missed the state finals game and didn’t show up to school for a week. It was May 20th, 12:24 PM, and it was raining outside. It was the last day before my life changed.

Noah opened the door to our classroom as everyone stared at him. He walked to his desk—his desk, the one he sat at every day—but someone had taken his seat. I think it was a kid named Tyler Goldberg. Or maybe Goodman. Something with a G. Tyler was a quiet band kid, the kind of person who got scared when anyone talked to him, especially girls. Which made it even more surprising that Tyler didn’t move an inch when Noah asked him to. “I think he might have been in shock,” someone whispered.

You see, we weren’t staring at Noah because he was thirty minutes late to class. Not because he’d vanished for a week. Not even because, out of nowhere, he’d broken up with Emma, the girl everyone thought he was going to marry after senior year. We stared because he was covered in rain and leaves, and his skin looked a shade darker than usual. It took me a few seconds to realize it wasn’t a tan. It was dirt—layers of it, caked into his face and neck.

I sat in the front row. Noah took the route on the right side of the classroom, the path with the fewest students, and walked past me. As he passed, I caught the scent—faint but unforgettable. It reminded me of when an old animal died on my grandpa’s farm. That stench of decay that stays in your nose a minute longer than you want it to.

He looked at no one. Kept his head down. But as he passed my desk, he lifted his eyes—not his head—just his eyes. The way a four‑year‑old glares when they’re angry, stubborn. It was inhuman. Like a robot trying to mimic an expression it wasn’t programmed to make. And in that moment, our eyes met. He smiled. Only for a second. But I swear it happened. Then the smile vanished.

Something fell from his backpack and hit the floor. John picked it up. I could’ve sworn back then John was going to be the best man at my wedding, the uncle to my kids. But I couldn’t tell you his last name now. Couldn’t tell you then either. “Tyler, can you move?” Noah asked. His voice was soft. The softest I’ve ever heard from a boy who stood 6’1” and weighed 190 pounds of muscle. It wasn’t soft like politeness—it was hoarse, like someone who’d been screaming for hours.

Once the shock wore off and the whispers died down, the teacher called security. They escorted Noah to the counseling office. He didn’t show up to school the next day. Or the day after that. Or the week after. He wasn’t seen again.

I’ll be honest—teenagers are the most self‑centered beings on Earth. His disappearance didn’t stay in my mind for more than a month. We chalked it up to a good kid who went bad, probably on drugs. At least that’s what the rumors were. No one thought about how his parents felt. His sister. His friends. We only cared about ourselves. God, we were so wrong.

A few weeks later, John texted me on a Saturday night. I don’t remember exactly what I was doing, but if I had to guess, I was playing Fallout 4. I think I loved that game more than I loved my own parents at the time.
   John: “Eddie, you up?”
   Me: “It’s 3 AM. Go to sleep.”
   John: “Remember that thing that dropped out of Noah’s backpack? The day he went missing?”
   Me: “Yeah, why?”
   John: “It’s been keeping me up. I was going through my backpack and realized I never looked at it.”
   Me: “Can we cut to the chase? I’m busy, bro.”
   John: “It was a note. Says, ‘You saw her too, didn’t you?’ You knew him better than me. Any idea what it means?”

Chapter Three

It was one of the worst feelings that I’ve felt—worse even than when my grandpa died. When he did, I was a little happy. Granted, I was eight, and it was less about him being gone than that I wouldn’t have to ever smell death like that again. Somewhere in my mind, I got the idea that when an animal died on his farm it was his fault. I didn’t know then that hamburgers and hot dogs were once living things, or that old age was a thing. I was just happy I wasn’t going to have to smell that decay again. I was wrong. I became more familiar with the smell of death than any other.

We were closer to the cows at the slaughterhouse than we ever were to the farmer. I stared at the text on my phone, and for the first time since this chain started, I was more focused on my phone than the Xbox—probably what I was playing. Before I could respond, John did.
   John: “Think you could come out tonight?”
   Me: “Dude, are you feeling okay? This is the same guy who cried at camp because you lied about who took an extra juice box.”
   John: “I was nine and he was scary.”
   Me: “Yes, I can come out, but are your parents gonna let you?”
   John: “They’re not gonna know, dumbass.”
   Me: “Lying to your parents and staying up past 10 PM—are you sure you’re not going to hell for this?”
   John: “You coming or what?”
   Me: “Already out the window.”

I was not—getting out of bed and turning off the TV took everything in me. But this was one of those nights I was grateful I lived on the first floor. It felt like an eternity before I pulled myself out and crawled through the window next to my bed, probably looking like a goblin of myth. I glanced at my sister’s window, which brought back painful memories of the first time I tried to sneak out at fourteen. Funny enough, it was actually to meet Sarah Evans—Noah’s sister—who was around our age. I hadn’t questioned how strange it was that the hottest girl in school texted me “hey handsome.” Before I could leave the lawn, my sister was halfway out her window, asking where I was going. I told her to “shut up,” which was enough to set her off to wake our dad. He gave me a very long speech ending with something like, “If you’re going to meet a pretty girl, don’t let me find out.”

By next week, through a friend of a friend, I learned it was a prank set up by her boyfriend. Things have a way of working in your favor, even if you don’t see it right away. As I cringed at my past self, I realized I had left my home without even checking where we were meeting. I pulled out my phone (at the time, three models behind and almost dead).
   John: “So where we going?”
   Me: “Old water tower on Vincent and Pine?”
(Don’t bother looking for it—the details aren’t entirely real.)
   John: “Can we go somewhere else?”
   Me: “So you’ll sneak out knowing you’ll get in trouble, but little Johnny is still scared of heights?”
   John: “I’ll be at the tower in 15.”

I began my walk there. Now there were four mistakes I made that night:
	1.	I turned off the TV but forgot to turn off the Xbox.
	2.	My phone was at 18%—no time to charge it.
	3.	I left my window open.
	4.	I chose the water tower as the meeting place.
