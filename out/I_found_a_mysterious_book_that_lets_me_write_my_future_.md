Chapter 1: The Bookstore

The sun was setting, casting long shadows across the quiet street as a young man named Kai strolled along the pavement, his thoughts heavy. The cool evening breeze rustled the leaves of the trees lining the road, and the occasional car passed by with a low hum. Kai’s mind was elsewhere, distracted by the recent changes in his life. He had dropped out of college just a few weeks ago, a decision that still weighed heavily on him, but he couldn’t shake the feeling that it was the right choice.

His phone buzzed in his pocket, snapping him out of his thoughts. He pulled it out to see that it was a call from Sarah, an old friend from college. He hesitated for a moment before answering.

“Hey, Kai,” Sarah's voice came through, warm and familiar. “How are you holding up?”

“I’m okay,” Kai replied, though the uncertainty in his voice betrayed him. “Just… figuring things out, you know?”

“I get it,” Sarah said softly. “It’s a big change. I just wanted to check in on you. College isn’t the same without you around.”

“Yeah, well… it wasn’t really for me,” Kai said, trying to sound more confident than he felt. “I needed to find my own path.”

They talked for a while longer, reminiscing about old times and discussing their plans for the future. But as the conversation wound down, Kai’s phone suddenly lost signal, and the call dropped. He stared at the screen in frustration, trying to reconnect, but the signal was gone.

Sighing, Kai continued walking, his mood darker now. As he walked past rows of shops, his attention was caught by a small bookstore with a sign in the window that read, "Free Wi-Fi." Deciding to take a break and try to reconnect, he pushed open the door and stepped inside.

The air inside the bookstore was thick with the scent of old paper and leather. To his right, a man sat in a worn armchair, engrossed in a book, barely noticing Kai's entrance. Shelves lined with books stretched vertically from the entrance, creating narrow aisles that led deeper into the store. The walls were adorned with framed newspapers, some of them yellowed with age, chronicling events from years past.

Kai walked in further, his footsteps muffled by the thick carpet beneath him. As he pulled out his phone to connect to the Wi-Fi, two networks appeared on his screen. Confused, he looked up and approached the store owner, who was standing behind a counter, absorbed in a book of his own.

“Excuse me,” Kai asked, his voice cutting through the silence. “What’s the name of the store’s Wi-Fi?”

The man didn’t respond, his eyes still fixed on the pages in front of him. Kai tried again, a bit louder this time. “Hey, what’s the Wi-Fi name?”

The store owner finally looked up, his expression blank. He appeared to be in his mid-40s, dressed in an orange shirt and gray pants. Without a word, he closed his book and approached Kai, moving a bit too close for comfort.

“You have to pick out a book,” the man said in a low voice. “A card with the Wi-Fi name and password is hidden inside one of them.”

Kai hesitated but nodded, turning to the nearest shelf. He reached for the first book his eyes landed on, but after flipping through the pages, he found nothing. He turned to ask the man for help again, only to find him standing right behind him, much closer than before. The man’s presence was unsettling, and Kai felt a chill run down his spine.

“There’s nothing in this one,” Kai said, trying to keep his voice steady.

“Not all the books have them,” the man replied, his voice flat. “Otherwise, people wouldn’t stay long or even look at the books.”

Kai put the book back on the shelf, feeling increasingly uneasy. He began to browse through the aisles, spending a few minutes searching for the elusive Wi-Fi card. As he scanned the shelves, a strange book cover caught his eye. The title, "Life," was embossed in faded gold letters.

Curiosity piqued, Kai pulled the book from the shelf, but as he did, he felt a sharp pain in his hand, causing him to drop the book. He looked down to see a small cut on his palm, blood trickling from the wound. Startled, he noticed that the book had four metallic faces on its corners, each one bearing a sinister grin. The title on the cover now read, "The Life of Kai."

A shiver ran down his spine. "What the hell?" he muttered to himself. The book was about someone with his name? The coincidence was too strange to ignore. He opened the book, skimming through the pages, and was shocked to find that the events described were eerily familiar. They were about him.

Flipping back to the beginning, Kai’s breath caught in his throat. The book started with his birthdate, the hospital where he was born, and even the names of his parents. Panic set in as he realized that everything he was reading was an exact record of his life.

In disbelief, Kai walked quickly to the front of the store to confront the owner, but the man was nowhere to be found. The store was empty, the silence oppressive. He dropped the book to the floor and bolted out of the store, heart pounding in his chest. The streets outside were a blur as he rushed home, his mind racing.

Had someone been stalking him? How else could this book exist? The thought of it made his skin crawl as he hurried home, bumping into people as he went, looking over his shoulder every few seconds.

Once home, Kai locked all the windows and drew the curtains tight, his paranoia mounting. He spent hours pacing around, trying to make sense of what he had just experienced. Eventually, he decided to take a shower, hoping it would clear his head. But as he stepped out, drying his hair, he froze in horror.

The book was there, lying on his dresser as if it had never left the store.

“What the fuck?!” Kai yelled, his voice shaking. He grabbed a metal pole from his closet and searched the house, but there was no sign of anyone. Slowly, he approached the book, his heart thudding in his chest. This time, he was determined to destroy it.

He took the book outside, doused it in lighter fluid, and set it on fire. He watched as the flames consumed it, but when the fire died down, the book remained completely unharmed, as if nothing had happened. Panic turned to exhaustion as he tried everything—throwing it away, smashing it with an axe—yet the book persisted, always returning unscathed.

Finally, Kai sat down in the living room, the book lying on the table in front of him. He was tired, scared, and out of options. Opening it once more, he noticed something new: red words scrawled on the inside of the cover that hadn’t been there before.

"Whoever touches the book and offers their blood will have their life recorded in this book from the day they were born to the current day."

Kai felt a cold dread settle in the pit of his stomach. He flipped through the pages, which now contained every detail of his life, right up to the moment he was currently reading. The other half of the book, however, was blank.

As he turned to the last page with writing, something fell out—a fancy-looking pen with a glass tube in the middle, filled with what looked like red ink. The pen was silver with a creepy, smiling face etched into the metal.

More words appeared inside the back cover of the book: "With this pen, you can write on the empty pages, and it will happen. No other pen will work. The ink in this pen is the blood of the book's holder."

Kai’s mind raced. “So this ink… it’s my blood? Is that why I felt that bite at the store?”

He examined the pen, noting the eerie smiles on the metal faces. Tentatively, he decided to test the book's power. He wrote, "Kai saw a rat run across the room."

For a moment, nothing happened, and he wondered if it was all just a sick joke. But as he stood up to leave the room, he heard scratching noises coming from a stack of boxes in the corner. Suddenly, a black rat darted out, running across the room just as he had written. It startled him, and he realized with a shock that the book had made it happen.

Kai returned to the book, his hands trembling. The text on the page had updated itself, now detailing the rat’s appearance and his reaction. He turned to the back cover and saw new words glowing beneath the first rule.

"When an event is written about the holder and the events leading up to the specified event are not clearly detailed, the book will fill in the gaps leading up to the event—good or bad."

Kai’s heart sank. He realized that the book had a mind of its own, capable of twisting his words into reality. The careless way he had written about the rat had caused it to frighten him. The book could be dangerous if not used with extreme caution.

He closed the book, feeling the weight of its power. Should he continue writing in it? The thought of having control over his own fate was tempting, but the potential consequences were terrifying. He decided to lock the book in his dresser drawer and try to sleep, but his mind raced with the possibilities—and the dangers—that the book presented.
