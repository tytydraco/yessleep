Naomi and I met on Tinder. At first she seemed pretty normal but after a few days of texting and sexting I realized she had some issues

She would text me about 500+ texts per day

“You up?”

“R u there?”

“Whatchu doin?”

“U watchin TV?”

“I’m bored”

“Can we talk?”

“Why aren’t u replying?”

“Do u hate me”

“Please answer me”

Those few messages would be sent within a minute. If I didn’t reply within 10 minutes she’d threaten to harm herself, even kill herself, then I wouldn’t hear back from her for about 2 hours. 

I had enough of her shit so I told her that I thought she was a lovely girl, I wasn’t ready for a relationship and I wished her luck and blocked her on everything.

About 2 weeks later I met another girl on Tinder. This girl was actually lovely and we clicked almost immediately. We spoke for a few days then went on a date together. The morning after our date I heard on the news that her body was found in her apartment, mutilated with big bites taken out of her. 

Of course I was saddened and went to her funeral, met her family who were all really nice and didn’t go on Tinder again for another few weeks. 

A few weeks later I went on it again, met another girl, spoke to her for a few days and the next morning she was found in the same condition.

The police didn’t question me the first time but that time they did. They found it suspicious how I was the last person the two were with before they were killed. Luckily though there was cameras outside the second girl’s apartment which showed her getting out of my car and I driving away straight away. What they saw soon after I drove away was Naomi entering the building. 

I explained to them that Naomi seemed to have attachment issues, must’ve been stalking me or something and killed those other two girls because she was jealous, so they searched for her but she was nowhere to be found.

One evening while I was watching TV, I heard a knock on my door. It was her. Before I could pull out my phone to ring the police she had pushed me to the ground and sat on me. I told her to get off but she said “you lied to me”. I tried to tell her I wasn’t ready at the time but she covered my mouth and told me “you’re mine now”. I’m a 6’3 pretty muscular guy and she’ 5’2 and very slim so I managed to push her off me and I ran to my phone.

I managed to dial 911 to tell them she was at my apartment but she ran at me and grabbed the phone from my hand. She noticed I had received a message from a girl. 

“Who’s this bitch?”

“That’s none of your business”

“Your business is my business”

“It’s not. Plus you killed those other two girls. Why?”

“Because they were a threat to our relationship”

“Our relationship? You were the only threat to whatever relationship we could have had. You’re a sick person and you need serious fucking help”

“Like everyone else, you think I’m a monster”

“You killed two innocent girls. Girls with families and friends. Girls that had their whole lives ahead of them all because you were jealous. Of course I think you’re a fucking monster”

“Well, I don’t care what you think to be honest. You’re mine and we’re going to be together forever”

“The fuck we are”

“This is not what I meant when I said I wanted you inside me but you leave me no choice”

I was confused by what she meant by that but then within a second, the 5’2 girl was now a 7 foot tall creature with a smile that reached from one ear to the other, sharp teeth, purple eyes, a long pointy nose and jet black hair reached her ankles. 

I tried to run for the door but she grabbed me by my hoodie and lifted me up with one arm. I told her if she put me down and let me live I’d be her boyfriend and we could forget it ever happened but her mouth opened wide like that of a snake but before she could put me into her mouth to swallow me whole, the police arrived. When they saw her, they started firing straight away. This caused her to drop me on the floor. I grabbed my phone in case she found out who the girl I was talking to was and ran. I hopped into my car and drove a few towns away to a police station there and asked them if I could stay there for the night with some officers guarding me, which they said yes to. 

A few hours later, one of the officers woke me up. They told me she killed 7 of their officers but they managed to restrain her and because she was unable to be killed, they had to lock away in a secure facility that she was unable to escape from.
