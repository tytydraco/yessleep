I always struggled with Friends, even in college. Well especially, in college. I had just finished my second year in, well it doesn’t matter now, I didn’t finish it, not after the Summer Holidays when I found a gun. Summer takes place at the end of year. I live in Australia if that isn’t clear, and while everyone was planning their groups trips to Queensland or Bali or wherever the hottest tropical destination was that year, I was instead travelling back to my hometown in Victoria.

I can’t tell you which town as it would give me away. But I will say, even if I did, it would be a struggle to find it on a map, even if it was a map of the town. If you wanted any of the big brand stores or even hospitals you would have to drive at least thirty kilometres. Driving was already an issue for me at the time. Six months prior I had decided I would drive everyone home at once after the pub near college closed. The car was filled with more people than seats, the loudest, craziest car you’d ever imagine seeing on a road, in return for this gesture I was hit with a DUI along with a couple other offences, I don’t remember. But I had been told by the Judge herself that any more offences would lead to some serious time. I biked everywhere then.

It started when Mum asked for skim milk. I was watching TV as I did for most of the holidays, and supposed I might as well do something. I biked up to the only supermarket in town, and picked up two bottles of Skim milk. Just before I left, I couldn’t help myself. I walked into the Bottle Shop section and went straight to the pre-mixes. 

“Can I help you?’, said a weak voice in a confident tone. I spun around to seek the source. 

“Ollie!”, I cried. “Good to see you!”.

Ollie was puzzled a bit, he always had that look to him. “Liam?”.

“How have you been Ollie?”.

“Worse now you’re here”, Ollie joked, well tried too. 

I did like Ollie. He always, well, he always seemed to get the short end of the stick. Back in high school it didn’t help he was always just a bit smaller than everyone else. Being the only one with glasses didn’t help either, and his hair was always as if he’d asked the barber to make him look like he was perpetually wearing a black bike helmet.
Again I did like Ollie, but maybe I did just bad for him. Bullying was the least of his worries, even back before High School. This is when Ollie almost got taken. After school was over, Mr. Antoli had spotted Ollie talking to someone with a red late 80s Cadillac, at least that’s what my Mum had told me. Mr. Antoli had managed to pull Ollie away and gotten the car to leave. A week later Sarah Ferring went missing. Ollie was even more anxious after that.

“It’s good to see you, Ollie”, I said.

“It’s good to see you too”.

We chatted for a bit, we really were glad to see each other, in our last year of High School we had separated a bit, but in that moment it really felt like it used to be. Ollie told me his shift would finish in an hour, and I waited, I really didn’t have anything else to do, especially without a car. Ollie didn't drive either, but not because he had a criminal record, he was just scared. His Father had died in a crash before he was born. Ollie was always just that kid.

We biked aimlessly around the hot empty streets, it felt good to be with Ollie again. Then I brought up the Clubhouse.

“What do you say, Ollie?”, I grinned.

Ollie was cautious, “It’d be pretty overgrown by now”, he was always cautious.

Though I knew if I started riding there Ollie would follow me, and he did. We biked off into backstreets, through the overgrowth, and behind the trees. There it was in its now desaturated glory, the red wooden walls and yellow roof, you’d only know the colours if you were there when it was built. 

I went in first as Ollie hid behind me. I remember it being a lot bigger as a kid, maybe that’s because… well. Despite that however, a full grown adult could still stand upright. Inside the Clubhouse was trashed, no doubt vandals and kids had come and gone over the years. But strangely things had been added. I went over the bookshelf on the back wall. Mind you, not without gagging from the smell. There was a row of three or four books I hadn’t seen before. I reached for one of the books.

“A gun...”, Ollie said. I turned around. Ollie was holding a gun.

“A Gun”, I said.

“A Gun...”, Ollie's voice drifted away.

 He put down the gun and I picked it up.

“Hey!”, he shouted. “Stop pointing it around, this isn’t Pulp fiction”.

“Maybe it is”, I grinned. This grin was new.

We discussed the Gun inside the Clubhouse. Ollie said it was sitting on the small kid’s stool next to the now closed door. It was heavy in both our hands and I could taste the metal in the air on the roof of my mouth. I tried smoothing it out with my tongue. Guns are banned in Australia, except for the Coppers. We had only ever seen them in movies.

“Let's take it out”, I headed straight to the door.

“Whoa, Liam!”, said Ollie. "I don't’ like this”, as if that wasn’t already clear. “We don’t even know if it’s loaded!”.

I swung the door open to the overgrown field.

“Well let’s find...”.

 It was pouring rain, and getting dark. It was around 7pm, I think.

“That’s funny...”,  Ollie said quietly. “I couldn’t hear the rain from inside”.

“Me neither...”, I paused to think, “Do you remember the planks on the windows?”.

Ollie was silent. We went back into the Clubhouse to get out of the rain.

I immediately started searching for objects I was going to shoot. There were a bunch more wooden planks and the books were too thin. Ollie had covered himself up in the corner with a blue tarp and sat on the ground, sawdust coated most other areas of the floor. I thought about the Skim milk outside in my bike cart. Ollie knew what I was thinking.

“C’mon Liam, we can’t actually do this, at least put the gun down”.

He was right, maybe I was a little too excited. I didn’t put it down though.

“Hey where’d you get that tarp?”, I asked Ollie.

“This?”, Ollie then coughed, no doubt the sawdust affecting his sensitive nose.

My eyes caught a large silver tin sitting on a ledge above one of the three shacked up windows. It was a kilo sized Milo tin, with the label scratched off. Instead the label had been replaced with a fat sticker, with words written in bold red marker: “TO DESTROY”. I tried opening it, it was heavy, almost heavier than the gun. I tried to open it, but anyone who has brought a tin of Milo knows how hard it is to open without a knife or spoon. I showed the tin with a fashioned label pointed at Ollie as he blew his nose.

“See?”, I said smugly. “I guess I have to use the gun now, someone clearly needs this gone”.

“What’s in it?”.

“We’ll see”.

 I opened the door again and placed the tin near our bikes. The rain came down a little less now however still loud. I could smell the damp grass of the field. When I went back inside it became clear there was definitely a smell in the Clubhouse. 

“Do you smell that Ollie?”.

“I can’t smell anything now,” Ollie sniffled. 

We should have left then. 

I sat down next to Ollie and pulled the Tarp over my legs as well. The smell was worse closer to the ground. 

“When the rain stops, I’m shooting the gun”.
 
Ollie was silent. He knew whatever he said couldn’t persuade me, it never did. We sat in that silence for a bit. 

“I wonder if this Tarp belonged to the Ferrings”, I thought aloud.

Ollie coughed and looked away from me.

The clubhouse was built by James Ferring and his Dad. James used to run with us back in school. James wasn’t always the brightest kid. Instead he was very physical, even at our young age; he was always building chicken coops or restoring old cars with his Dad. After his sister Sarah went missing, the family packed up everything and moved out of town. We never saw James again.

I tried to keep Ollie’s spirits up by reminiscing on our early days, checking now and again to see if the rain had stopped. 

In what felt like hours the rain did stop. We went out to our bikes, it was darker now but we could still see. I took the two cartons of skim milk and the Milo tin and went out to the middle of the field in front of the Clubhouse. Ollie stood at his bike juggling his eyes between his bike wheels and me placing the items on tree stumps to create a dodgy shooting range.

“Liam?!” he shouted. “My bike wheels, they’re punctured!”.

“What?”, I shouted back.

 I didn’t hear him as I finished setting up the three objects in a row in front of me. I ran back to Ollie, my smile fading. His tyres had been slashed and so had mine. I didn’t say anything.

“C’mon Liam I don’t want to be here anymore, this doesn’t feel right, put the gun back…”.

I shot the gun directly into the tin, the recoil pushed me back a step. The tin exploded, erupted into a massive explosion, bursting the two skim milks on each side. The flames shot up quickly into the sky. When the flames came down they stayed there. The overgrown grass started to blaze slowly eating up the ground in front of us.

We didn’t breathe. We just watched. We didn’t look at eachother, we were just stunned. We gazed as the flames creeped around the backside of the field, beginning to catch the trees. Suddenly I felt a lot hotter. We watched in silence for what felt like days, time slowed. That’s when I heard the sirens. Despite the inferno in front of me, I was immediately pulled back to the Judge’s voice when I was hit with the DUI. I could not go back, I could not get done for this. I shoved the handle of the gun into Ollie’s chest. He was pushed back and let the gun drop into his hands. I think. Then I ran. I ran onto the dirty path behind the Clubhouse exiting the field from the opposite side we had entered, all as the flames crackled louder behind me and the sirens got closer. I heard Ollie shout something but I was too far to hear him. I ran two kilometres before looking back. The field was lit up, even over the many treelines I had pasted. As orange filled this corner of the night sky I could see red and blue light bounce against the trees. I ran home even faster.

The next morning I woke up to Mum and Dad standing around the TV in the lounge. News footage of a burning field played, my eyes darting between the TV and my parent’s faces. Turns out they actually put the fire out quite quickly. I was relieved. Then it kept going. A Clubhouse was found near the field. It only suffered minor fire damage but, held inside, lying on the floor were two bikes and the cold dead body of a young man with black hair. Signs around his neck implied he had been strangled with some kind of wire. Then it kept going. Due to the smell Police decided to pull open the floorboards, there they found in the dirt, under the clubhouse, another body, this time that of a girl, wrapped in a blue tarp. It had apparently been there for years. 

Nobody mentioned a gun, ever. Except the Police did find something, a set of car keys, the model, they believed the keys were for was an old 1980s cadillac. I don't know what to do now, it's the same car I see outside my window.
