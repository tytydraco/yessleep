We’re not first. By that, I mean we’re not the first attempt at human life, at least that’s what I’m putting together. If you’re going to listen to my crackpot theory though, you’re going to have to hear the backstory.

My name is Helen, I’m thirty, unhoused, and scraping by on the streets of NYC. Despite what you might think of this, I’m in a sane mind and have others to corroborate what happened, or at least some of it. A few of the others I was living around and I were going to a nearby soup kitchen, hoping for at least a warm meal. I don’t think I’ve actually eaten real food and not just scraps in three days at this point, but that’s the least of my concerns after this morning. We were on our way, getting ready to cross the street when a car came speeding through, whipping around another at the stop light.

I’m not really sure why I reacted how I did. There was a girl in front of me that I’d just met, Phoebe. She was younger, down on her luck, but a really talented artist. She just needed to find some sense of stability, you know? That’s hard these days. The car was heading straight for her on the crosswalk, no way it was going to slow down or even try to. I just jumped forward, pushing her out of the way and taking the full force of the sedan barreling toward me.

At least, I should have felt the full force. Instead it just kind of knocked me back into the pavement. It still hurts, but more like when you run into a pole or something when you’re not paying attention. Here I thought it must have stopped or slammed on the breaks, except when I finally opened my eyes and overcame the daze of the hit, the street was suddenly empty.

I mean totally empty. Not a goddamn person, vehicle, or even animal in sight. There are five pigeons for every square foot of this damn city yet at this moment, everything was silent and still. Then the humming started. It was low, reminding me of the old, giant TV that my grandma kept in her living room. That sound of low, static humming when a channel was on with nothing to watch.

Eventually, I picked myself up, not quite sure how long I was laying there though. Opening my eyes made me think I was officially dead though, or had some major, major brain damage. I’m going to describe it as best I can, but bear with me if it sounds a little odd. Everything was the same, geography-wise, with the familiar layout of the city I grew up in. Except it was… I don’t know, low-res?

It reminded me of when I fucked up a Grand Theft Auto game and glitched everything else out. The empty world was more angled than real life, with fewer curves and more edges on everything. It wasn’t until trying to actually get up that I started to really feel the ground under me. It was smooth, a slight static just breaths away from the surface. The asphalt looked as if it was painted on, giving the appearance of poured concrete. In reality, it just felt like a smooth, marble surface. Cool to the touch, too.

As I stood the rest of the world came into focus, and I could see the buildings looked much the same. Windows and doors as if they were crudely textured over. Everything reminded me of an old Playstation 1 game, looking around, but how the hell I was inside it, I don’t know. The sky above looked fake too, with clouds painted on with angled powers. Just looking up started to make my vertigo go crazy though. 

After a few minutes of gathering myself, I started moving down the street, trying to figure out what this place was. The streets were empty still, with not even a breeze moving the still air. When I walked up to one of the windows, a blurred display with a sign that said SLICE with pictures of pizza that made jpeg compression look like Da Vinci, there was nothing I could see through the windows. Hell, it was like just solid color, painted like glass to give the appearance of a front. Might as well have been a cardboard cutout.

”Hello!” a voice shouted from around the corner. It froze me at first, realizing I wasn’t as alone as I believed. I had to find a way out of here though. Maybe they knew something? I don’t know, it’s not the least rational thing about today. Because when I finally reached the intersection and got a clear view around me, unobstructed by the tall buildings around, I almost lost my fucking mind.

The World Trade Center was standing tall against the sky. Not with much detail on it, but the Twin Towers were punching into the sky for the first time since I was a kid. The world grew louder, my mind racing trying to just find some comprehension of what I was seeing. God I just wanted to get a hot meal and now I’m in pre-Y2K hell. With no fucking idea how to get the hell out of this place. 

I almost resigned myself to death at this point because everything was so fucking overwhelming. Then the voice came again, a small “Hello?” this time from behind me. Everything in my body screamed not to turn. Don’t look, don’t face whatever nightmare was probably right behind me. Despite it all, I still looked.

A kid was walking toward me, maybe a couple blocks down, this time though they gave a much louder “Hello?”.

This is on me, not going to lie. I grew up homeless for a lot of my childhood, so I’ve got a soft spot for kids who need help. That was almost the end of me. 

“Hey, are you okay?” I shouted down the street. The child only gave another “Hello” in return, nothing else. They were moving toward me still, but the light didn’t let me make out any features. Cautiously, I started walking to meet them. They repeated hello again, this time louder. It wasn’t until I got closer that I noticed the humming growing louder, static cutting through the silence.

”H-h-h-h-ello?” It said again, this time stuttering it out, resetting to the beginning every time. When it came into view I took a step back, realizing I made a huge mistake.

The smiling, cheery face looked pasted onto the angular head. Their shoulders and arms were oddly sharp, just floating at the side without movement. Legs were moving,  but not actually touching the ground. This thing was gliding like a ghost, closer and closer to me. 

Features grew more clear as it got closer. The smile was too wide for the face, stretching ear to ear showing far too many teeth. Empty eyes stared forward, crudely drawn onto the skull. I honestly don’t know if it could see me, but it felt like it *wanted* me.

“H-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h” It started glitching harder, the words stacking on top of each other without getting out the first word. In only a few feet it became one long sound, a scream of binary technology missing a one or zero. It got overwhelming, causing me to fall to my knees in the middle of the street. Gliding ever closer, the figure was now bending, contorting, and stretching itself in every direction. There was a singularity in the middle, with every fiber of the thing screaming trying to escape it. I could see the ground around it beginning to pixelate, popping in and out of existence.

Once the stretching got to its face everything went to hell. The sound grew even louder, more static and loud, mechanical errors deafening me. Static charge filled the air, crackling around as the hair on my arms raised. I was being electrified, growing more intense as the glitch grew closer. It wasn’t similar to being tased yet, but god I could feel it ramping up.

Pretty sure I started screaming, which may have been what saved me. Whatever god there was in this fucked up digital prison must have taken pity on me. I felt something grab me by my shirt collar, stretching the fabric as it did. That was it, I thought I was going to die. This thing was trying to eat me and I would die here, forgotten on the streets just like in the real world. 

“You can stop screaming now.” A voice said, pulling me along the road toward one of the storefronts. The contorted glitch of a person was still following behind us, but at a much slower pace now. Looking up, there was a person in a sloth mask pulling me by my shirt collar. “Anyway, bye. Try not to come back.”

Without a second thought, he threw me into one of the painted doorways with ridiculous strength. Bracing myself for the impact of a wall, I instead stumbled out, the heat of the city streets hitting me like an inferno. People were bustling around, bumping into me and going about their day. I was back in the real world, just down the street from where I was when everything started.

Cop cars were down the road near where I got hit, as well as an ambulance. When I walked up, I couldn’t even say anything. Phoebe was standing there crying by the ambulance, a large scrape going down her forearm. Seeing me must have made her think she was being haunted, because she started to point at me, crying too much to get anything out.

Talking to the others that were with me, I’m still not sure what the hell happened. Everyone says they saw me push Phoebe, the car make contact, then I was just… gone. An hour passed and everyone thought I was still on the grill of that truck, being taken along on a high-speed chase. They still haven’t even caught the driver, apparently.

I’m tired. Everything is still blurry. I feel like I saw something I wasn’t supposed to, like something taboo and ancient. Even though the look of it was relatively recent, it just felt… old. There was something there that wasn’t right. Not to mention whoever the fuck rescued me. God, I have a lot of fucking questions but right now I’m just glad to be alive.

Maybe someone in the homeless camps knows something. I’ll reach out to a few of my shelter buddies too, to see if they’ve experienced anything similar. To be honest, surviving on the streets in the real world seems a little trivial now after seeing all that. I don’t feel like I’m real anymore. I keep hearing scientists talking about living in a simulation, but I think I just saw the demo. God, I hope I don’t have to go there again, [though](https://www.reddit.com/u/googlyeyes93/s/Zrm1REhkVr).
