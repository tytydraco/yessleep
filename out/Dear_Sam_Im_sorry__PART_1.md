# Sam — Letter 01

You don’t know how happy I was when you accepted my friendship. I’ve heard people call this “pen pals.” You said you’re from the city of Estrella?

I was surprised. I thought people from there weren’t allowed to communicate with the outside world. I’ve heard your city has never known the technology of the rest of the world,,, and I’m glad I can be the one to teach you about it.

What year is it for you? I suppose I’m happy we can start talking.

# Sam — Letter 02

I’ve been thinking a lot about my life lately, and it feels… fragile. I hate my job—and sometimes I hate my own mind. Every day I wonder if it will be my last. It must be strange to live in ignorance, to not worry about wars or hunger,,, to not see the worst of what humans can do.

You probably call it something else, but many cities here were built on the ruins of the war. Accidents, disasters, people breaking—hollows appearing. My job is to keep normal people safe,, to make sure these “humans” never touch the rest of the world.

I guess that makes me a sort of superhero. Do you have superheroes in your country?

# Sam — Letter 03

I’ve treasured every letter you sent me. You’ve never seen our technology, our disasters, our city, so I suppose it’s only fair that I introduce myself properly.

I’m twenty-four, and I live in the Federal Republic of Novus Terrae. People here work, smoke, drink… and die. The sky hasn’t been blue in years. The sea is gone under the smog, and the buildings look sick, like ribs poking through gray skin.

Before the Great Destruction, they say it was beautiful. I’ve never seen it. Now all that remains are ruins… and tombs. People don’t go out after nine, and in the mornings, strangers appear—people who have never lived here.

Even stranger is Oubliette 88, the most infamous prison in history. The government opened it in 1988, supposedly for the citizens. That’s all anyone needed to know. Only one prison in the nation still executes. You already know which one.

They say even people erased from history end up here. The masters who run the prison are broken, and most inmates are close to level 2 hollows. I work there as a psychologist, interviewing them. Nothing glamorous. My brother is stationed on Level 1. I pray for him,,, though I don’t think prayer reaches that deep.

The prison isn’t like any other. You enter on the fifth floor, then descend… down and down. They say the floors are arranged by crime. I don’t believe it. They’re arranged by rot. You smell it before you see it.

I’ve only been working for three days, and I already feel like I will die in this job.

Smoke hangs low over the rooftops. A man coughs through the haze, his coat streaked with ash. The sky is permanently gray. I feel as if it’s waiting for something… I don’t want to be here when it appears.

The prison smells of piss, sweat, cheap cigarettes. Inmates shout constantly. They are violent. Some look like normal criminals—protesters, thieves—but they are not human. They are hollows, doing things human science can’t explain. That’s why they’re here.

I’m not scared of the prisoners on Level 4. No… I’m scared of the prison itself. It feels alive. It watches. It breathes. And I know I’m not the only one who senses it.

Maybe one day we can go to the beach. I know a secluded place where only homeless people and other strange characters appear. But I have a feeling this will be my last letter.

If anything happens… good luck.

**Dear Sam**   
You told me you wanted more stories , I am not sure how to tell them, but I will try.  
Sometimes I forget the order of things. Sometimes the memories blur. Still—I will share them with you, as you asked.

\-

The white floors of the cells gleamed under flickering lights—sterile, unnatural, like teeth in a dead man’s mouth. My boots echoed hollowly along the corridor,

Richard shuffled beside me, ginger hair plastered to his scalp. Every step was uneven, hesitant. Every so often, he glanced behind us, still carrying fear even though he had been working more .

On my other side, Cyrus walked slowly i cant really explain my relation with him its not like we are friends , but i respect him i even fear him and even if i tried i cannot describe him is like my memory is blurring at his presence 

The silence stretched between us, oppressive. The corridors had no windows. All light came from harsh white panels above. It reminded me of a hospital not that i have ever visited one

We walked slowly. though the clean hallway ,My mind tried to map it, to understand it, but everything seemed wrong no matter how many times I tried to investigate this place i didn't make sense 



“Why are they calling us? Did someone escape?” Richard’s voice quavered. Interrupting any of my thoughts 

impossible,” Cyrus said,

I breathed in the sterile, bitter air. “See the lights?

if the alarm turns on it means something escaped,  green means Level 4. Not necessarily escape—it marks danger. Yellow, Level 2. red is extremely dangerous. Purple we would not be here alive i tried to joke 

“You’re correct again,” Cyrus said, glancing at me.

“I always admired your ability to sense and remember. You’ve been here only a short time, yes? "Richard interrupted my silent exchange of glances with Cyrus. "Yes.”

“What did you do before? Surely it was not worse than this.” he leaned against the wall.

“I had many jobs. Before this, I was an assistant to a  detective.”

“Oh. Intelligent, then.”

“I suppose.”

“Okay. We separate here,” Richard said.

“Today I work Level 1,” he added.

“Remember why,” I said.

“For the ladies,” he muttered.

that surprised me  a bit I didn't see the point in fighting for something so simple but i don't let it show in my face 

“The ladies?”

“Yeah,” he said, moving toward the elevator.

I continued with Cyrus. His steps were magnetic, ritualistic. Every detail is exact. The eyepatch left the other eye too sharp, too alive.

“I read your file,” he interrupted my thoughts.

“You did?”

“Only work: detective. Your father too. Bad at it, it seems. Never solved a case. it \`paint you as a dumb worker ”

“That’s true,” I said, letting the silence stretch.

“Weird. The file doesn’t match you,” he murmured.





“Bring out the cuffs for Prisoner 4, Level 3.”

I arrived as he walked out. Did he compliment me? My senses tingled with something I could not name.

The storage room reeked of burnt metal and a faint, bitter odor, organic and wrong. 

There he was: Edith Steed. Massive shoulders, knotted like cords under skin stretched too thin. Scars ran jagged across arms and chest; one twisted to his lips, splitting his grin.

 Blond hair clung in wet clumps. His blue eyes looked right though me he reminds me of the stereotype of an American soldier that appered in movies, he could have been consider handsome if not for the pain expression he always had as if he was being cut with a knife any minute of the day.

“What do you need, Simon?” he asked, inspecting a malformed creature, with a knife he was cutting a piece of the eye 

“Extra protection for Inmate 3, Level 3.”

“File?”

he looked at me waiting for something  

“Yes. 

"Yes, please "i replied 

he grabbed the cigarette in his mouth, and signed 

anything you find on your own? i tried to asking 

I visited his mother in another city. A strong woman left him when he was 12 , no relation or infection of hollow with him, maybe neglectful ? 

he had many boyfriends during his years he lived with his son, that's all I could tell you 

the father?

one day he left the two, hadn't seen him in 20 years, i tried searching for him but didn't find anything 



**Name:** Ajax Gray Normal high school teacher. Mutation appeared during class. Super-hearing developed. Eventually, only one voice remained,

type of hollow : infection 

**Incidents:**  
  


* Shotgun attack in school; 15 students ,2 teachers injured. 

on the six of march at the 9:00 Ajax gray entered the school with a shotgun, killing 15 student that were on the literature club and injuring two teachers who were in the class of the right 

after that he sitting on the floor in rest waiting for the police to arrive , 



Photos revealed his skin beneath clothes like cracked earth—gold and brown, bone covered in keratin. It shifted under light, almost breathing. Gruesome.

“What would you do?” Edith asked. I was tasked with extracting information.

the room were interviews were always performed was a grey small room without window , a table connected to the floor and two chair at my right were two soldiers of level2 

“So, Ajax, tell me about yourself.” His gaze weighed like stone. he remained in silence looking at me as if you looked to a bug i was almost amused by that 

“Answer, or we will use force.”

He paused. “I cannot hear you,” he said finally. He obscured a hand against his brown hair 

“You can. If you allow it. You silenced all other noise to hear a single voice.”

He stared. Probably surprised he though didn't know the truth 

“When did it start?”

“Eight months.”

“Do not lie.”

He flinched. I smiled. “All your  life?”

“Yes. Always that feeling—someone calling me.”

how ? 

have you ever had the feeling of someone calling but you don't hear anything , or if someone was supposed to be calling you, he tried to say with a stutter 

i have, I wrote on the notebook 

“I sometimes used to hear his voice, and with the years my hearing grew better. I could hear noises in other buildings and then his voice.”

when did you finally start understanding his words 

eight months ago , i thought i was getting crazy he told me thing no one was supposed to know 



“Did he tell you to kill the children?”

Silence.

“When he speaks, all else disappears,” he murmured.

“Did he force you?”

Anger flared in his eyes. He tried to get out but was still in chain connected to the floor and the wall  he looked at me in range 

“None of this is your fault. You are innocent.” I smiled at him while watching him 

“He didn’t force me. He gave me a choice. I acted. Sacrifice for the greater good.” he said panting with the effort 

“What if he lied?”

he remained silent and then he started trembling as if pain his eyes turned white m while sweating for a moment i through eh had a seizure , but a smile that appeared on his face broke that image 

“He never lies.” he said after a few minutes a big smiles appear on his face while looking at me in confidence 

I examined his file. Free parents, transient childhood, no constants. Only one voice persisted.



A yellow alarm interrupt in every though , and finishing the interview , the yellow means a level 2 escaped the prisoner 

 shrieked. Soldiers seized Ajax, dragging him away.

“Wait,” I called.

What did he tell you now ?  

He trembled. Sweat glistened like oil. “It told me not to trust you.”
