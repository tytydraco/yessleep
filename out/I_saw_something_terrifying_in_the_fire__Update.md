When I arrived at the psychiatrist’s office, I checked in at the front desk. The woman working there told me to take a seat, that the main guy was just finishing up with another appointment.

Now I’d never seen a psychiatrist before or been in one of their offices. But I wasn’t terribly impressed with this one. It was like the opposite of inviting. The entire place looked old and somewhat decrepit. Weird stains on the walls, floors that looked like they hadn’t been swept in months. There was also the faint smell of something burning. Not sure what exactly, but definitely not food. The only other person in there with me was an older lady sitting in the corner, reading a magazine.

There was also a TV anchored right above reception. It looked pretty new. Flat-screen, maybe fifty inches. Didn’t quite match the aesthetic of everything else.

I started watching it but couldn’t understand what it was supposed to be. Looked like somebody filming themselves walking through a residential street. Like one of these city walk videos you can find on YouTube. Except this wasn’t somewhere interesting like Tokyo or Shanghai. Just some suburbs somewhere in America.

Somewhere strikingly and uncomfortably familiar.

Eventually the camera stopped in front of a house, staying on it until I could feel a sinking in my gut.

I recognized the place. It was my childhood home. A memory clear as day.

We’d moved several states over when I was about eight years old. We moved because the house had burned down while we’d been away on vacation in Florida. Left the stove on, is what my father had told me. I never really bothered looking into it. Instead of going home, we moved into my uncle’s place for a few months while my folks figured everything out and found us a new place.

I continued watching as the camera panned down to a gloved hand holding a container of gasoline at which point I looked away and then down at the floor.

This could not be happening. There was no way. Of course I knew that I needed to get the hell out of there, but an esoteric kind of fear was keeping me glued to the seat. The kind of fear you’d have as a kid when you were getting ready to go upstairs at night. That once you started moving, something would start chasing you from behind.

I looked back up at reception, making sure to ignore the scenes on the television. The girl looked busy, typing away on the computer. Then I looked at the lady in the corner again and noticed that she wasn’t moving. Like at all.

It was a statue. A human-like prop. Made of what, I couldn’t be sure. But it was starting to melt in the sunlight.

I looked back over at the receptionist and now she was looking at me, her hand covering her mouth as if the sight of me was one of the funniest things she’d ever seen. On the television now was my old bedroom completely engulfed in flames. There was a figure sitting on my burning bed, their back turned to the camera. After a while they began to turn slowly around and that’s when I jumped out of the seat and ran away.

My mind’s racing as I walk home and I’m looking over my shoulder every few seconds. Now the fear has evolved into some overwhelming dread, and I get this sense that I’m being followed even though the streets are packed and there’s no way to confirm that.

A few minutes later I get a call from Jack.

“Where are you right now?” he asks me.  

“Just out and about. Why?”

“So you’re not home?”

“No. Why?”

“Don’t go home. Meet me at the Starbucks near my place. I’ll explain.”

“What?”

“Absolutely do not go home.”

Given everything that’s happened, I took his advice and went over to the Starbucks. When I got there, he was already sitting at a table waiting for me, two lattes in front of him. It looked like he hadn’t slept in days.

I sat down across from him, and he looked at me and sighed and slid me one of the cups.

“I don’t how to begin to explain this to you,” he said. “It’s fucked up. It’s gonna be a lot to digest.”

I told him that I was pretty much willing to believe anything at this point.

He went on to explain a bizarre incident he was involved with several years back. His station had received a report about intense, rancid smells coming from a condo in a suburban neighbourhood near the edge of the city.

Given the details, it seemed like a cut and dry case. Somebody was murdered and a body was dumped somewhere the killer had deemed inconspicuous. Apparently these things happen a lot.

So he goes over there to investigate with Clayton, his partner at the time.

When they showed up, they were surprised to find that the place had been extremely well-maintained. Freshly mowed lawn, immaculate paint, the works. Which wholly contradicted the claims that it had been abandoned for years. However, none of the neighbours were able to remember the last time they’d seen anybody actually entering or leaving the place.

He told me that the moment they got out of their car, their senses were assaulted by this overwhelming stench. But not the kind they’d been expecting. Not at all like decomposing flesh. It was more esoteric than that. Like something burning. But they couldn’t tell what exactly.

So they start making their way to the front door and the closer they get to it, the more they feel compelled to turn and sprint the hell away. A strange kind of feeling. As if some invisible force was trying to tell them that this place was not meant for them, that they needed to steer clear.

The energy oozing from this place was awful. Sinister. Enough to make two hardened officers question everything that had led them to the moment.

Jack went to knock on the door but saw it was already partially open. They entered and their eyes immediately began to water. The air was boiling inside, and the smell had become outright oppressive, so heavy around them it almost felt like they were moving underwater.

It was also dark. Abnormally so. Light was streaming in from the windows only to be completely suffocated after a few inches. Even their flashlights were being drowned in the gloom, hardly able to provide enough light to effectively navigate. It almost felt like they had entered another dimension.

At some point Jack nearly tripped over something. A small notebook, he realized after picking it up. Like one of those micro journals. He put in his back pocket and continued on.

Moving further into the place, they could start to hear something. Like a low, muffled rhythm. After a while they could tell that it was some sort of chanting. But it didn’t really make sense. It sounded too far away, as if it were happening several floors below them. But it also could’ve been a recording. Which too would’ve raised some frightening implications.

Soon they found themselves standing in front of a door presumably leading to the basement. Here they could hear the chanting the clearest, though they still couldn’t make out what exactly was being said. They tried to enter but it was locked. Jack told me that he opened his mouth to call out to whoever was below, but the words got caught in his throat. As if his body was doing everything it could to keep him quiet.

And apparently Clayton didn’t have the nerve to advertise their location either so the two of them just stood there in silence.

Until Clayton eventually whispered something to him.

Jack didn’t hear what he’d said at first, so he asked him to repeat it.

“There’s people sitting on the stairs.”

“What?”

Jack looked around, pointing his flashlight every which direction but couldn’t see any stairs. He couldn’t see anything at all.

“Where are they?” he asked. “Where the hell do you see them?”

No response.

“Clayton?”

Nothing. The guy was gone. Jack was in there by himself. But the thing is, he never actually heard Clayton leave. He was right behind him when they first entered and now he was gone.

But then who the hell had been whispering in his ear?

After asking himself the question, he turned and bolted for the door.

Clayton wasn’t outside either. He was nowhere to be found at all.

He called it in, asked for some backup. Then he started to feel extremely light-headed and passed out shortly after. By the time he came to, he was laying in a hospital bed.

He was out for close to forty hours. During that time, another pair of officers were sent over to investigate the place. Both were then killed under mysterious circumstances. One of them was found buried in the backyard, his torso fully eviscerated. The other was found days later in a closet in an abandoned building on the other side of town with her head, hands and feet cut clean off. As for Clayton, he was never seen or heard from again.

Jack never ended up finding out what became of the case. The entire station seemed to be hush about it, trying to avoid making any mention of it at all. There were whispers, though, that they were never actually able to gain access to the basement. That a SWAT unit had been sent in and each one of those officers had either gone missing or ended up dead. That they tried burning the place down several times unsuccessfully. That the entire community was shortly evacuated and all roads leading to the place were subsequently blocked and taken off the map. That it’s now a controlled area being closely monitored by the FBI.

He was right. That was a hell of a lot to take in. But I was still confused.

“So what does this have to do with me?”

“The journal,” he said. “I ended up going through it afterwards. It was fucking weird. Just a bunch of names, dates and addresses. One of them was that apartment you live in. It even has the unit number.”

I shook my head. It was hard to believe but then again so was everything else that had happened. “Well I’ve been there for over two years,” I tell him. “So why would something happen now?”

“The date written next to the address. Today’s date.”

I didn’t really know what to say.

“So… what then? What do I do? Where the hell am I supposed to go?”

Jack sighed. “It goes deeper than what I’ve explained. It gets more complicated. You’ve become targeted by the director.”

And this is the point where I began to lose the plot. He tells me that the director is some kind of obscure, extremely malicious entity. Something largely beyond our understanding. They don’t know where he came from, what rules he operates by or why he’s here. He first showed up during World War 1 in the trenches of northern France. Several soldiers from both sides had reported seeing him filming them during battle, standing right in the midst of vicious gunfire. They said that he wouldn’t fall to bullets. Couldn’t be burnt. Couldn’t be blown up. That he couldn’t die. That they saw him in their dreams. That he watched them while they were awake.

It attaches itself to people. No real rhyme nor reason behind who it chooses. But once it latches onto you, it won’t let go until it completes its objective. Which is capturing your death on camera.

But it won’t just kill you. It certainly could, but it chooses not to. Instead it aims to film and prolong your suffering. It can manipulate reality. It’ll force you question everything. It’ll turn you insane.

I never told Jack about what I saw in the factory that night.

“How the hell do you know this?” I ask him.

He sighs, stares at me blankly. I can see him starting to open his mouth but he just as quickly closes it.

Then he smiles at me. Then he starts laughing.

I shake my head. I’ve had enough of this shit. “What?” I ask him. “What the are you doing? What the fuck is this?”

Soon the laughing devolves into an unhinged cackling, and I can see spit flying out of his mouth as he’s pounding the table with his fists. I look around the café but nobody seems to be disturbed by this. Actually nobody’s moving at all. They’re all melting.

Eventually he stops, his expression settling back into something more reserved.

“I know the director personally,” he says to me. “He’s right behind you.”

As soon as he says this I stand up and make a beeline for the front door.

Step back out onto the streets and start walking. No clue where the hell I’m going because nowhere feels safe now. I’m freaking the fuck out. I’m panicking.

I’m looking over my shoulder after every other step, searching for that pale, dreaded figure. But I don’t see him. At least I don’t think I do.

Not sure how long I walked for. Maybe hours. Eventually I find myself on an unfamiliar street and it’s completely empty. Now it’s getting dark out. My heart’s beating through my chest and I can barely concentrate on any singular thought. I need to settle down. I need a drink. I look around and see a liquor store up the street to my left. I head over there and walk in.

The only other person inside is the cashier and this comes as a relief. He smiles and gives me an enthusiastic greeting as I walk in though I can barely muster up a hint of a smile in response as I head towards the cool room.

It’s also mostly empty in there, save for a couple in the corner. Head for the malt liquor and I can hear them arguing. It’s a heated one. They’re really going at each other throats. Out of curiosity I start eavesdropping.

“Why is it always my responsibility?” the guy shouts at her. “Why is it always fucking me?”

“Just fucking do it!” she shouts back at him. “Quit whining, just go do it! Go and strangle him!”

“Keep your voice down! Or else he’s gonna hear you!”

Suddenly everything’s quiet and I hesitate before turning around.

They’re both staring at me now, their expressions maliciously vacant. The guy has one arm behind his back, and I can see a rope dangling between his legs.

I take the bottle I’m holding and toss it at them and then run out of there, only to stop as I see somebody blocking the front door.

It’s a young dude. Lanky, pale skin, dark and messy hair, wearing a t-shirt and jeans. Large, unnerving eyes. Filming me with a black camcorder. Smiling.

The cashier’s sitting in the same spot, still smiling, still waving at me.

I turn around and see the couple walking out of the cool room and towards me. The guy’s covered in malt liquor and I can see pieces of glass stuck in his cheek and eye.

I look back at the director and see him walking towards me. And that’s it. I’ve reached my limits. I clench my jaw and close my eyes and start screaming.

Shortly after, I hear a loud crash, and I’m blasted with glass and drywall.

Open my eyes again chaos erupts. A large, black truck has rammed through the wall and people in tactical gear holding rifles are pouring out of it, shouting over each other. Bullets start flying and the air becomes heavy with dust and gunsmoke and then I’m tackled from behind. I feel rope fastening around my neck and as I get pinned to the floor, I see the director laying in front of me. There’s blood leaking from the side of his head but he’s still holding the camcorder. Still filming.

And then I black out. When I came to however many hours later, I was lying in a bed in some hospital. There were cuts all over my arms and it felt like the skin had been peeled off of my throat. It hurt to swallow.

I sat up, stared at the wall in front of me. I wanted to believe that everything had just been a dream but that wasn’t possible. The memories were clear. They were burned into my head.

After a while this tall guy in a suit walks in, pulls up a seat next to my bed.

“How are you feeling?” he asks me. “Are you okay?”

I’m not exactly sure what to tell him so I default to “Yeah. I think so.”

He tells me that I was caught up in police trap. That the FBI had been tracking a wanted criminal and that he just happened to show up in that particular liquor store while I was in there.

“What criminal?” I asked him. “What’d he do?”

The suit just smiles at me, tells me that all my questions will be answered later. To just relax and rest for now. Then he leaves before I can say anything else.

I stew in my thoughts for some indeterminable amount of time before a nurse comes in holding a tray of food. She sets it down on the table beside me and I thank her. She smiles and leaves. I look over at the tray and see a rectangular package wrapped in brown paper. There’s a message written on it in black marker.

*Final Cut*
