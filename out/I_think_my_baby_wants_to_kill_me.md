I’m young i’ll admit, but that never stopped the incessant nagging of wanting to start a family that played on a loop in the back of my mind. So when I came home from work months ago to find a baby on my doorstep I wasn’t as weirded out as I should have been. Maybe things could have been different if I was. 

 —————

As I walked home from work the hot summer sun beamed down on my back. I couldn’t wait to get inside to the cool air. I sighed as I jammed my key into the rusty old doorknob to get into my building. 

“Damn it” I gritted out. 

The only thing this lock was good for was keeping people who lived here out. My key never failed to stick in the lock and make it more of a hassle than anything. I stomped up the four stairs it took to get to my apartment and swung open the next door. 

Immediately I saw what looked to be an Amazon package waiting for me. 

“Hmm must be for one of the boys” I said aloud. The boys being my boyfriend and his brother. I know I wasn’t expecting anything so they were the only logical answer. However as I got closer I noticed the box ripped open. “Can’t have anything nice around here can we? Fuck!” I exclaimed to myself. Of course someone riffled through our mail. Of fucking course!

I went to snatch the box up when I noticed little eyes peeking back at me from the inside. My breath caught in my throat as I stumbled back from the box. I widened my eyes and peered into the box. And just as I had thought, there was a little human in the box. Little brown eyes studied me quizzically while clutching what looked to be a teething toy. 

Now I’ll admit my first instinct was to go running and call the police, but something about those little eyes captivated me. I felt as though I was hypnotized. Before I could process what was happening I had grabbed the baby and I was sitting on my couch. 

I can’t tell you how long I was sitting there, but by the time my trance was breached it was night time and I could hear my boyfriends voice sharply questioning me. 

“…hear me?! Whose baby is that” he spit out. 

I looked up at him and furrowed my brows. 

“Why are you talking to me like that?” I asked. 

“I’ve been asking you who’s baby this is for at least five minutes and you’ve ignored me every time” he said as if it was common sense.

“Oh I-“ 

“It doesn’t matter.” he cut me off “just answer the question” 

“I’m not sure it was at our door when I came home” I mumbled.

“IT? IT? You come home at 3:30 everyday. It is now 8:45 and you’re calling it an IT?”

“What the hell are you talking about?” I asked defensively “I just sat down” I told him.

I looked back down at the baby and oddly
enough the baby was still looking at me.

I heard my boyfriend scoff, “whatever. I’m just saying it’s been five hours and you don’t know if its a boy or a girl. Better yet why haven’t you called the police?” 

That was a good question. A great question even. For one, I hadn’t even realized I’d been sitting that long, and two, something deep down was telling me I shouldn’t involve the police.

“I don’t know. Maybe we should wait until the morning. It’s been a long day. I’m sure the baby just wants food and a good night of sleep” 

He stared at me skeptically as if you say I was crazy without actually saying I was crazy. 

“Doesn’t sound like a good idea to me” he said with a roll of his eyes.

I opened my mouth to argue but was immediately cut off by him letting out a long heaving sigh.

“You’re right though. I’m tired. So unbelievably tired and the idea of dealing with the police and social services tonight is just way too much for me” he admitted, “but even then we have nothing here to care for a baby until morning.” 

I stared at him realizing he was absolutely correct. We didn’t even have a suitable place for this baby to lie it’s head let alone something to feed him. 
 
I nodded slowly, my gaze still locked on the baby. “I’ll… I’ll figure something out,” I murmured.

The baby hadn’t made a single sound since I picked it up. No crying, no cooing—just those dark, unblinking eyes fixed on me. It should’ve bothered me, but somehow… it didn’t.
That night, we made it work. I found an old T-shirt to swaddle him in and kept him beside me on the couch. My boyfriend complained about the whole situation before retreating to bed, but I stayed up, watching the baby’s little chest rise and fall. At some point, I must have drifted off.

When I woke up, the baby was still in the same position, eyes wide open, staring at me. Not the sleepy, fluttering gaze babies usually have—no. It was as if he’d been awake all night, waiting.

The days blurred after that. We bought formula, diapers, a crib. My boyfriend kept asking if we should call someone, but I always had a reason to put it off. “Just until we find the parents,” I’d say. “Just until things settle down.”
Weeks passed. No one came looking for him.
That’s when I started noticing little things. The baby never cried. Ever. Not when he was hungry, not when he woke up in the middle of the night. He’d just lie there, staring. Sometimes, I’d find him looking at the corner of the room, eyes tracking something that wasn’t there.

One morning, I through the apartment and froze. My boyfriend was gone—no note, no explanation. The baby was sitting in his highchair, tiny hands wrapped around one of my boyfriend’s watches.
I told myself it was a coincidence. People leave. Watches get misplaced.
But then his brother stopped coming around. Friends stopped answering my calls. My boss said I’d quit my job weeks ago, but I didn’t remember doing that.

It was just me and the baby.

The apartment felt quieter every day, like the world outside was slipping further and further away. Sometimes, I’d wake up to find him standing in his crib—not wobbling like a normal baby, but perfectly still, perfectly balanced, eyes locked on me.

Last night, I woke to the sound of whispering. I don’t know how I understood it, but I knew it was my name.

This morning, I looked in the mirror and realized I couldn’t remember what 
my life had been before the box.
I can’t remember my boyfriend’s face.I can’t remember my friends’ voices.I can’t remember if I ever lived anywhere else.
But the baby is still here.
And he’s smiling now.
