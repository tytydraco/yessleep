Last night, I had the dream again. A nightmare—its setting was identical to my bedroom, so much so that the second I opened my eyes, I couldn’t tell if I was still in the dream or awake.
 
I dreamed the door I’d locked from the inside swung open again. That person had effortlessly unlatched the several bolts I fastened every night, then lay down unapologetically on my left side, flat on their back.
 
In the dark, I dared not move an inch. I pretended to be asleep, but when I suddenly snapped my eyes open, the door was shut, and no one was beside me. I scrambled out of bed, shivering uncontrollably from the cold.
 
The clonazepam, lurasidone, and quetiapine I’d taken before bed had left my memory in a fog. Jumping out of bed made my vision spin. My heart hammered as I stumbled to the door and grabbed the doorknob… Locked. Yes, locked… Right, that’s right. I’d definitely locked it before sleeping.
 
And the window—right… I tore open the curtains and checked the window… Yeah… It was locked too, just like I’d checked before bed. No one was in the room. Not on the windowsill, under the bed, or in the closet. No one. It was impossible. There couldn’t be anyone!
 
It was just a dream, right? But how many times have I had this dream? Every single time, it feels real—like it actually happened next to me. If one day my dreams become indistinguishable from reality, who’s going to tell me how to tell them apart? Where’s the line? That fading boundary sends chills down my spine.
 
I turned on the nightlight to my right, a gift from my best friend. Every night I wake up screaming from a nightmare, I switch it on. Its warm yellow glow wraps around me, like it can shield me from the dark. In the blackness of the room, I didn’t dare open the door or make a sound. I just clung to that nightlight, too afraid to turn it off. I feared the second I did, those eyes watching me from the dark would find me, drag me into that nightmare, that abyss I’m so terrified of.
 
The meds finally kicked in, and I drifted off again. Waking up this morning felt like a lifetime had passed. I slept straight till dawn. The sheer curtains, which block no light at all, blazed white from the sun outside. The dark was gone, but the memories lingered. Were they fake? Or real? I pressed the back of my hand to my eyes and sighed. Stop thinking about it. Get up.
 
Today I was supposed to go to the mall with my best friend. We don’t get to hang out every day like we did in junior high—different schools mean we only see each other on holidays. So I cherish every moment we have together.
 
I hurried to wash up and get dressed. I texted her: “We’re meeting at 1st floor of the mall at [xx] o’clock, right? I’m about to leave.” No reply. Her house is closer to the mall, so she’d probably slept in later than me.
 
I got in a taxi. “Oh, by the way, I got your birthday present for December in advance! Don’t be late!” Still no answer. Had she overslept? I didn’t think much of it.
 
“I’m here! Where are you?” Nothing. It was [xx]:13 now. “No way, are you bailing on me again?” Silence.
 
The mall was eerily empty today—so empty it didn’t feel like a holiday. Desolate. And cold. Why was it so cold? The mall should have heating on! I pulled my red-and-black checkered scarf up, tucking half my face into it. Cold… So cold.
 
I wore a mask; I hate the way people look at me. Their gazes hold too much, too many complicated things. I can feel them even when I don’t meet their eyes.
 
I leaned against the wall next to the bookstore—one I usually love browsing. A poster stood outside for a horror novel I’d read once, now getting a physical release. My friend still hadn’t shown up, and she wasn’t answering my texts or calls.
 
Anyway, my mind wandered back to that novel. I rarely read horror books or watch horror movies—I have nightmares too easily. Even a little bit of scary stuff leaves me with vivid midnight terrors that jolt me awake.
 
One image from the book stuck with me: what the eyes see travels through the nerves to the brain, forming vision. The eyes are like a shutter, or—a door. Behind the door is the brain, the imagination within. Outside is reality, the real world. Every blink feels like opening that door, and in that split second, all the terrifying thoughts in your head spill into reality and become real. Just like… just like my dreams. I shuddered. No… I can’t think about this anymore.
 
The protagonist in that novel gouged out his own eyes to stop his horrific imaginings from seeping into the real world… No, I can’t think about it. No… I won’t. Absolutely not. I was freezing, covered in goosebumps.
 
Then I felt someone tap my left shoulder from behind. “Jiang.” It was her voice, calling my name.
 
I froze. Because I suddenly remembered—it was the Ghost Festival today.
 
They say every person has three “yang fire lamps”: one on the top of the head, one on each shoulder. If someone taps your shoulder or you turn back while walking at night, the lamps go out one by one. If all three die, a ghost will steal your soul.
 
Every time I went out at night as a kid, Grandma would tell me the full set of old wives’ tales: 1. No shoulder taps: A tap from behind snuffs out a shoulder lamp—one tap, one lamp gone. 2. No turning back: Whipping around stirs up a cold wind that might blow out the lamps. 3. No answering calls: Never respond if someone calls your name in the wilderness, to avoid a “ghost summoning.”
 
She’d also stressed never to go out at night during the Ghost Festival or a moonless night—times when yin energy is thick—because I’ve always been weak-bodied, with too much yin. When I was little, Grandma wouldn’t even let me step outside after noon on the Ghost Festival. But… it’s daytime now… and I’m grown up… So why couldn’t I bring myself to turn around?
 
An inexplicable sense of dread washed over me. I’d paused for so long, and she hadn’t said a word… like… like she was waiting for me to look back. I trembled again.
 
I remembered what Grandma had told me to do if this ever happened: after being tapped, brush the spot three times quickly to symbolically relight the lamp. I congratulated myself on thinking fast, even letting out a small, nervous laugh.
 
I didn’t dare turn around, but reached up to pat my left shoulder—only to touch her ice-cold hand instead. I was wearing thick clothes because I’m always cold from my poor health, yet her hand had been hovering so close I hadn’t felt a thing.
 
A chill shot from the soles of my feet to the top of my head. How could her hand be this cold? She’s the kind of person who runs outside in shorts right after washing her hair in winter without blow-drying it! I forgot everything, spinning around in a panic.
 
There she was. Yes, her. Standing there perfectly fine, looking at me with a half-smile. She tapped my right shoulder lightly again. “Hi. Why are you late?”
 
Why am I late? She’s the one who’s late! Her smile was wrong—nothing like her usual one. She normally smiles so brightly, like the sun.
 
Back in junior high, I was weird and lonely. She’d approached me step by step with her sun-like warmth, just like that nightlight she gave me that chases away the dark. But now she was so strange. Her smile didn’t look like her. It looked like… me. That half-smile, distant and mocking.
 
I forced a smile and quickly pulled the gift I’d gotten her out of my bag—a small black crossbody bag, as dark as last night. I shoved it into her hands, accidentally brushing her fingers. The cold made my heart ache. Everything felt so unreal.
 
I thought of Sophie’s World, a book I’d never finished since elementary school. My voice was quiet and shaking as I stared into her eyes and asked an absurd question: “Do you really exist? I mean, are you really here? You’re my best friend, right? You’re here, aren’t you? You’re real?” My voice cracked on the last word.
 
I can’t remember her answer. All I know is that day was freezing—especially after meeting her. The cold seeped into my bones. I left unusually early, going home right after lunch. Normally, I’d hang out with her until seven or eight in the evening, but she didn’t say a word about it—just smiled and watched me get into a taxi.
 
I couldn’t bear to look at her smile. Not because I was scared of it, but because it felt like looking in a mirror. I wasn’t seeing her, my best friend. I was seeing myself. It was like I was watching myself smile back at me.
 
Noon. I have a habit of keeping a diary, so I jotted this down while I still had the courage. I fell asleep, and about twenty minutes later, I suddenly felt all my senses vanish. I couldn’t get up, struggling for what felt like an eternity before regaining a shred of feeling.
 
Then my cat came over and bit my right index finger with its sharp teeth—hard enough to draw blood, it seemed. I heard a short, childlike scream and jolted awake. Just a dream. I sat up to find my cat staring at me from the chair beside the bed, its golden eyes cold and unblinking. My heart raced. I was about to say something when it jumped away. Whatever. I was just scaring myself. There’s nothing to fear at noon.
 
Suddenly, my phone buzzed nonstop—ding after ding. Thirteen messages from her, from morning till noon:
“Jiang, good morning!”
“I’m leaving!”
“I’m here! Where are you?”
“Why aren’t you replying? Did you oversleep?”
“I usually bail on you, are you getting back at me?”
“I remember you said you got me a present!”
“You said it’s a surprise—what is it? So mysterious.”
“I’m here, next to the bookstore we always go to.”
“Hey, there’s a poster over there for that horror infinite flow novel you recommended to me! I thought you liked it.”
“Where are you, my god?”
“Missed call”
“Missed call”
The latest one was from a minute ago: “Are you okay? Did something happen to you?”
 
So who was the “her” I met today…? And is the “her” texting me through the screen even real…? I couldn’t bear to think about it. I replied with a half-hearted apology and turned off all notifications on my phone, scrolling through short videos to distract myself.
 
I thought about the nightmares I used to have. Back then, I never locked my door or windows.
 
I’d dreamed my mom was washing fish in the kitchen when the fish suddenly opened its mouth wide and bit off her head. I’d dreamed of my dad, walking with me along the reservoir near our house—a dark path with dim streetlights, surrounded by forest. I’d joked to him that it was the perfect place to dump a body. He wanted to smoke, and I hate the smell, so he walked behind me while I led the way… And in the end, just like I’d said, he killed me in the dream.
 
By some coincidence, we actually went there the next day, and he did walk behind me. I’d resigned myself to dying, but it turned out to be just a dream. Or was it? Since then, I’ve kept a utility knife under my pillow every night.
 
I thought about the first time I’d had that recurring dream. I flipped through my diary entries about “dreams”:
 
October 30, 2024
Had the nightmare again last night. Agony and despair. The dream felt exactly like reality—my bedroom, my furniture, every detail burned into my memory, no logical flaws at all. But the worst part, the most painful part, is that I die over and over again, then wake up alive. Desperately dying, only to find it’s fake. And when I wake up, I can’t tell reality from the dream at all. It’s torture. And this time, I had the nightmare even after taking my meds. I feel so helpless.
 
Do normal people have nightmares like this? Isn’t a dream supposed to be the subconscious fulfilling a wish? Why do I even feel pain in mine?
 
Woke up at 3 AM from a nightmare. My meds are in the living room, but I’m too scared to get them. I sat on the edge of the bed, wrapped in a coat, staring into space. Too afraid to sleep, too afraid to go out. I held on until 4 AM, when I had to go to the bathroom—finally grabbing the meds on the way. Then I had another nightmare at 5:30 and woke up screaming again.
 
Locked the door, but now I’m scared someone’s under the bed. From an outsider’s perspective, I’m fighting with thin air, but all I can think is: someone’s under the bed, behind the curtains, in the closet, in the living room. They’re going to kill me. I summoned up the courage to check under the bed with my “weapon”—the nightlight… No one… Good. My heart’s pounding.
 
I sighed and lay down, so tense that my stomach growling sounded like someone else’s under the bed. Now I’m second-guessing if it was too dark to see under the bed clearly.
 
Dream details:
I didn’t realize I was dreaming at all. It felt like I’d woken up in the middle of the night, lying on my side, with a dull pain in my lower right abdomen. I ignored it—I’ve had a lot of stomachaches lately. Then a searing pain hit, and I felt a knife pierce my stomach straight through. In that instant, I could feel blood gushing from the wound, and hear that person’s ragged, restrained breathing in my ear. I thought clearly: should I scream for help, or fight them off when they aren’t looking? But the wound was too big. I knew I wasn’t going to survive. I thought calmly, So this is what death is—sudden. Then I woke up with my heart pounding out of my chest.
 
Second dream:
I was lying on my back, stomach aching faintly, when someone under the bed stabbed straight through the mattress and into my belly. I felt a little like I was dreaming this time, and the dream was sloppy. I could tell reality from the dream quickly after waking up.
 
I’d taken my meds before this dream, so I wasn’t that scared when I woke up—but still miserable.
 
The nightlight she gave me is a lifesaver! I used it for hours last night!
 
Woke up with a hangover feeling. My head hurts so bad I can’t think. I have two important classes this morning—math and chemistry—but I can’t sit through them. I planned to go in the afternoon (I have a physical exam, so I have to go). When I got to school, I felt terrible, like I was walking on clouds. My heart was racing, my legs weak and shaking. I might be dying.
 
November 18, 2024
I saw something yesterday, and I’m too scared to sleep… I think it’s pathological… It’s starting to feel more and more like paranoia… It goes back to elementary school, I think. I don’t know if my memories are exaggerated, but I remember having nightmares almost every night for a month straight. Different scenes, different ways of dying…
 
November 25, 2024
Had nightmares all night—haunted by a little ghost, too scared to sleep. I’ve always been afraid someone would assassinate me, so lately I check under the bed and in the closet before sleeping, lock the windows and bolt the door. The doctor upped my meds because of the nightmares. But instead of dreaming about being killed by people, I now dream about being haunted by ghosts. I struggled like crazy to wake up last night, but every time I opened my eyes, I was still in the dream—four or five times. I’m so broken. I bought a blessed five-ghost coin from Longhu Mountain this morning… Just for peace of mind, I guess.
 
I finally understand why people pray to gods and Buddha. If there was a clear, right path for someone to take, would they choose this endless one? He’s tried science, reason, hard work, waiting—nothing works. What else can he do? The world mocks me for being crazy, for being fooled. I laugh at them for being blind, for not seeing the truth! Hahaha! I’m cursed! I’m cursed!
 
Three terrible things happened today too. When I got home, I screamed, “Hahaha! Kill them all! Kill them all!” I sounded so fierce. I never knew I had it in me, haha. It felt so real I laughed like an idiot.
 
I’m so unlucky aaaaaa
 
January 1, 2025
I noticed I rarely summarize in my diary—just record. It’s just like the lyrics about “memory” in Zhou Shen’s Like a Dream: “Forgetting while piecing together.”
 
Had the nightmare again last night, crystal clear. I dreamed: I posted a video online that revealed a lot of my personal info, with a hint of my kinks, and a serial killer targeted me. He came to my school and killed someone in a brutal way. The body was a mangled mess, and a crowd gathered to stare. My classmate and I took one look—she ran to throw up, and I went with her. On the way to the bathroom, we ran straight into the killer. He recognized me instantly. Seeing my classmate next to me, he said something terrifying to her (told her not to be near me again, said he’d transferred her to a new school, ordered her to leave at once). My classmate was terrified. So was I. I knew he was after me. So I agreed to go with him, telling her to leave first and whispering for her to get help. I stalled for time, walking toward the hallway where other students were. They came out with knives to protect me, attacking the killer. I was petrified, hiding in a classroom and grabbing a utility knife. I meant to go back and help them, but I was too scared—I locked the door instead. I’m so cowardly. So, so cowardly. When the noise died down, I dared to go out. Many students were hurt, but the killer had run away.
 
The dream had obvious plot holes—I almost never share personal info online—so I wasn’t too scared when I woke up. But I took my meds anyway.
 
February 8, 2025
I want to note something weird about myself, starting with today’s hospital visit. I was waiting for my turn when a little girl next to me suddenly had a meltdown, screaming and crying: “I told you this isn’t your seat! Not your seat! Why are you sitting here! Why!” I used to see this all the time at the Shanghai Mental Health Center, but I was at a Chinese medicine hospital today, so I didn’t think much of it. She was behind me to the right, and I suddenly felt uneasy. I imagined her jumping up and stabbing me. Then I reasoned: kids who cry that hard usually don’t stab people. I have these intrusive thoughts of being harmed all the time now. When I close my eyes for a nap, I’m scared someone will stab me in the heart, or a madman will break in and kill me. When I walk down the street at night and pass someone, I’m scared they’ll kill me out of nowhere… Everywhere except familiar places—home, school—I feel an inexplicable panic that chokes me. I’ve had this since elementary school, but the intrusive thoughts have gotten worse lately. I even had them as a kid: once, sleeping with my mom in elementary school, I dreamed a robber broke in and killed both of us. I woke up staring at the door until dawn.
 
February 9, 2025
I told my dad about the scary thoughts. He said it’s genetic—my mom has a mental illness, but I don’t know what exactly. Mom was sitting on the couch next to us—she heard, right? Why didn’t she care? Why didn’t she explain? Why didn’t she deny it? Is this reason even more hopeless than having no reason at all? But I was calm, a faint sense of hopelessness settling over me as I mentally drafted this diary entry. Freaking out in my head. If there’s no time, no place, no one to freak out in front of, I can do it in my own mind. Even if it’s not healthy.
 
Our school assigned an essay: “Is scenery first human or natural?” What about my scenery? Genes have controlled my body since I was born. Even if my mind could escape the solar system, my body is trapped in its genetic code. I’ve seen the world differently from everyone else since birth. My world is always filled with fear, nightmares, blood, and violence. After learning that answer, I suddenly wanted to ask my mom: Are you afraid of something too? Do you wake up in the dead of night, reliving your own deaths over and over? Are you scared? Do you crave death? Are you just like me? The older I get, the more I realize I’m a monster hiding in the crowd. I thought I could stand out, but day by day I see I don’t belong here at all. Do I have a kindred spirit? Is there anyone like me? Turns out no one else goes through what I do. No one can truly understand my fear. Even if I watch the sunset 44 times in a day, even if I die a hundred times in my dreams, what waits for me in the morning isn’t rebirth. It’s just an endless cycle.
 
That night I slept with Mom, waking up from a nightmare and staring at the door until dawn. Was that my Centennial Solitude—mine, Mom’s, Grandma’s? It started with that door. For over a decade since then, every time I wake up from a dream, I stare at that door, terrified it will open. So I learned to lock it. I’m scared of everything. Even a locked door makes me imagine a monster passing through it.
 
I keep thinking about the color blindness paradox I heard about long ago. “Is scenery first natural, or human?” But what if her scenery was stained red with blood from the start? How do you prove the blue you see isn’t someone else’s green? How do you define your green against another’s blue?
 
May 16, 2025
I dreamed of someone I haven’t spoken to in years, crying nonstop in the dream. I woke up crying, then cried myself back to sleep.
 
December 13, 2025
Last night, I dreamed I was back in the Shanghai Mental Health Center, hospitalized again.
 
I stopped reading my diary. Only one thought echoed in my head: Maybe the monster in my mind, the one in my memories, escaped through the door of my eyes a long time ago. I accept it. I finally understand. Why she said I was late this morning. Because she was lying next to me last night. She woke up before me.
