I just had to share this with someone. It doesn't make any sense. I got a call this morning. My boyfriend had been in some sort of hunting accident and he was injured. They are not sure what happened. I got here and he's still in ICU. they won't tell me anything. They gave me his things. Just his phone, wallet and pocket knife. I powered on his phone to see if there is any clues as to what could have happened to him. There is a recent note saved on his phone. It might have some answers of what happened.

Note:  I'm going to start at the beginning. I don't know if anyone will ever read this. I just wanted there to be some record of what I've seen in this place. My name's Jeremiah Lapp. I thought I had found the perfect hunting spot a little piece of public hunting land that seemed to be mostly undisturbed by people. Now as I sit here I'm not sure where I am. I went in the day before opening day of whitetail season to set up the ladder stand. I set it up a few hundred yards in the woods.  It was a bitch carrying that thing in but I hoped it would be worth it. I was so excited I could hardly sleep that night.

I arrived at the spot the next morning just before dawn. I swnug the door open and stepped out into the darkness rifle in hand. I made my way in the dense woods. Every few steps I would stop take the pen light out of my pocket and shine it on the ground to make sure I was headed in the right direction. After the forth time of almost falling on my face. I could make out the shape of the ladder in the dark.  I shifted the rifle into my left hand and climbed up the ladder with one hand. The ladder was wet with dew and slippery. I sat down in the little padded seat.

 Dam, I should have tied the rifle to the Paracord I have tied off at the top and pulled it up after I got up here. I'll remember that next time. That was kind of dangerous. I lifted the ol' Winchester I brought with me and pointed it down at the ground in a safe direction. I slide four fingers into the lever loop and pushed down opening the action. There was just enough moonlight I seen the glit of the metallic cartridge. I pulled the lever back up closing the action. I put my thumb over the hammer tightly and pressed the trigger. In order to slowly lower the hammer into the half-cock position. I was ready to go.

It was just minutes before dawn. The chill that comes right before it's light out crept slowly though the woods. Softly embracing all it meets in teeth chattering cold. The light had started to peak over the trees but it was still fairly dark in the woods. I laid back on the tree and closed my eyes for a moment. It wouldn't be long now. 

After a few minutes I opened my eyes and started to look around. Light was starting to trickle in. suddenly I was frozen in place by what I saw. About twenty yards in front of me was a Huge buck. The biggest I had ever seen. My heart was in my throat and I started to shake. The light hit his antlers and they almost seem to glow. I slowly moved the rifle into position and got the sights on him. I took a deep breath and as I let it out. I slowly squeezed the trigger. The rifle barked in my hand and saw the buck stumble and the run deeper into the woods. I got him!

I was bursting with excitement. I couldn't believe I really got him. I couldn't wait I had to get down and find him. I could tell I had made a good shot and he wouldn't make it far. I started to climb down the ladder. Just two feet from the ground I slipped and fell off the ladder. I landed on my feet but as soon as I landed. I heard a gunshot echo through the woods. It sounded close.  Dam someone must have seen my deer and shot at him again. 

I rushed in the direction of where I seen the buck run. I found the blood trail and started to follow it. From the amount of blood he couldn't be to far.  I made my way though the woods much further than I thought I would have to. Still no sign of the buck or any people. 

Two things were starting to weight on my mind. One. This is crazy long blood trail how is the buck still on his feet. Two. I've been walking for at least forty five minutes but the sun hasn't moved. It's still exactly where it was when I shot. Light was peaking into the woods. Most of the sun still behide the horizon.

I came over a hill to find a green canvas tent set up in a flat area surrounded by a few cedar trees. I walked down the hill to the campsite. Hello? "I shouted is anyone here." "I'm looking for my buck" no answer just birds chirping in the trees above.

  It was very strange for someone to be camping out here. I was fairly certain you were not allowed to during hunting season. They must not have got the memo. I walked over to a little folding table set up near the fire pit. On it was an old transistor radio and a Coleman lantern. Not a battery powered led lantern like you see most people have these day but real oil lantern. The ones you pump up and light. This thing is an antique I thought as I lifted it off the table. I studied it for a moment. Then sat it back on the table while muttering under my breath "hipsters".

 I walked over to the tent and leaned down to the opening. "Hello is anyone here"? My voice was only met with more silence. So I peaked in the tent. To see two empty sleeping bags and a few articles of random clothes laying around the tent.  Hmm I guess no one's home. I walked out of the campsite trying to pick up the blood trail again.

Just a few steps away from the campsite things got even stranger. I could see the woods stoped a little ahead. As I got closer I could see what was a narrow dirt road weaving it's way though the woods. There was a truck backed up to a bank on the side of the road. The way the truck was sitting it was taking up the whole road. I walked towards the truck when I was close I could see it was an old international pickup. There was a large water tank in the bed and now I could see the tank was catching spring water out of a mature spring. Only when I was at the hood of the truck did I see the man.

 He was tall and wore a felt hat. The hat was brown probably dark drown at some point but over the years the sun had faded it. He was lean but looked strong for an old man. He looked to be in his mid to early sixies. He hadn't seen me walk up. "Excuse me sir". The old man's head wiped around surprised to see someone out here. His hand immediately went for the small of his back. I raise my hand in a symbol of peace.

 Even though one hand held a rifle. I spoke quickly and clearly. "I was just out doing some hunting and I'm looking for my deer". The old man just started back at me. Getting a good look at him now he looked oddly familiar but I couldn't say where I had ever seen him.  "Have you seen it"? I ask hm. Very slowly he shook his head from side to side not breaking eye contact with me.

"Ok well I'll just be going then". This seems to ease him and he let his arms fall to his side. I smiled while slowly lowering my hands. "I like the truck". I gestured towards the truck with the hand that wasn't holding the rifle. He still just stared back at me. Finally after what seemed like an hour but was probably just a minute he spoke. "It's been a good one". His voice was deep and gravelly. It sounded like he hadn't said a word out loud for a long time. I shook my head up and down a little to enthusiastic. I was just happy he was responding.  

"I like the beard" he said moving his hand over his salt and pepper stubble. I smiled and turn to look at my reflection in the passenger side window of the truck. There I stood short and stocky bushy mountain man's beard but something was off. I moved closer to the truck window to make sure I was seeing clearly. My skin was ghostly pale. I touch my face just trying to comprehend what I was seeing. I looked down at my hand it was the same.

 I was brought out of my panic by the old man's voice. "I don't think you are going to find that buck". His voice was sort of somber now. I turned back to him. "Why not have you seen him"? I looked down the road for any sign of the it. "No I haven't seen it but umm. He trailed off and walked to the driver side door of his truck. "You should know there is something following you". I turned back to the wood line I had emerged from. "What do you mean"? "What is following me"?  "It's umm, it's different for everyone so I'm not sure but it's best just to go towards it rather then try and get away.

 "What the fuck are you talking about"? I shouted full of confusion and irritation but he didn't hear it. He had already sat down in the old work horse and started the engine.  He waved as he pulled away." Crazy ol coot". I muttered as I back away from the dust cloud 

What was he talking about something following me? I had heard a twig or two stap behide me. I thought it was just a raccoon or opossum. I shook my head as if to sling the thought from my mind. I had now been walking an hour and a half and the sun still isn't over the trees. I'll go back to the truck and get some water. I'll rest awhile then I'll come back and find the buck. I started back in the direction I came. Who knows maybe I will find him on the way back to the truck...

I walked back into the wood line. I headed back the way I had come. A twig snapped in the distance. I scanned the surrounding bush for movement. Dam I'm losing it.

 Making my way back over the hill to the campsite I had come passed I was struck by what I saw. This was the way I had come. It couldn't be?  The green canvas tent was torn to shreds. The little folding table where the lanterns were turned over. The lanterns lay broken in the ground. "What the hell"?  "I was just here." How could this have happened so fast? I was just a hundred feet away from this spot and I didn't hear anything.

 I heard a growl from just behind me. It was deep and low. I put my hand to my chest to still my heart that was beating its way out of my body. My hand touch something warm and wet. I pulled it away quickly to see it dripping with blood. 

"What the fuck"! I looked down and I was standing in a pool of blood. I started to feel weak and tremble uncontrollably. I slowly turned around to see bloody foot prints. My foot prints. Before I could comprehend what was going on a thrash in the shadows sent me sprinting though the woods. I ran unsure of the right direction unsure of anything. My foot was caught on a tree root and I fell into darkness.

I opened my eyes but my vision was blurry. I slowly stood and the pain in my chest was terrible. Stumbling confused holding on to trees for support hoping I was headed towards my truck. I could see a gap in the trees and there was my truck sitting in a field. I took another step and was plugged into darkness 

I could hear a faint crackling. I slowly opened my eyes. I was looking up at the night sky. The stars looked brighter then I had ever seen them. I turned my head to see a small fire. There tending the fire was the old man from the spring. I scrambled to my feet.  "Easy,son,easy" my eyes darted around for my rifle.  Seeming to know what I was thinking the man pointed just behind me and said it's there on the log. "What are you doing here?" "Me well I umm I'm going to help you make it out". "Out of where the forest?"  "Yeah kinda.". "Let me ask you some questions."  "How close was that second shot?  "I don't know, couldn't have been more than a few yards away." At this the old man just looked off into the distance for a while

"You seen any strange things since you've been looking for that buck?  "You mean besides you and how'd you know it was a buck I just said deer earlier?". The old man chuckled and pushed up his old felt hat to scratch his head.

"Yeah I am mighty strange to you I expect. As for the buck I know a lot of things and I'm afraid I don't have time to explain it all to you." "Well you don't have time for me to." What do you mean?  We got to get going before it finds you. Before what finds me?  "I don't have time to explain it to you and you wouldn't believe me anyway." We have to get you to the river. There's no river around here, is there?  You'll see when we get there. You crossed it to get here though you may not remember.  Your tougher then I thought I think you can make it back to the otherside. With that he turned and started through the brush.

I quickened my pace to keep up with his long stride. "I think there might be some other people out here in trouble". "Why did you see someone else?" No but there was a campsite and one minute it was fine and the next in shambles. "You can't trust what you see out here anything you see has already happened you can't help anyone." 

I started to speak but he held his hand up to silence me. A gnarled old finger pointed to a brier patch a few feet away. I squirted trying to see what he was showing me. Then the buck I  shot stood up but there was something terribly wrong. His eyes were ghosty white.   Flys and all manner of insects surrounded a rotting bullet wound. 

I backed away I couldn't believe what I was seeing.  The old man whispered. "wait,wait" but I turned to run. Before I could take a step a large dark figure burst though the brush. I fell backwards crawling way.  A black bear stood on its hind legs before me. It's eyes were white like the buck's. The fur around his face was lighter than the rest. It seemed to make the shape of a grey skull. The skin on his lower jaw had rotted away leaving nothing to cover his jagged sharp teeth. A steam of blood and bile dripped from his mouth.

The beast roared and I felt frozen to the ground. He swiped a massive paw at me and at the last second I was able to roll out of the way. I stumbled to my feet and the bear charged. I looked around for help from the old man but he was gone.  At the last second I flug myself out of the path of this terrible beast. 

 I sprinted in what I hopped was the right direction. I could hear the bear tearing thought the brush behide me. Finally I slide to a stop at a bank over looking a river.  Out of nowhere the old man walked up beside me.  "You have to go now!" "Are you sure this is the way?" "Yes, oh and you'll need these to get across." He held out two strange looking silver coins. I took them and looked over them.  They looked old and well worn. I could barely make out an owl on them. "Why would I nee-." Before I could finish he pushed me into the river. 

The water was dark green and it smelled of death.  I was concerned for the old man and I looked back to the bank. I could swear I seen him and the bear just sitting there watching me swim across. I made it to the other side and climbed out.  As soon as I was out of the water I felt so weak. I was at my truck in no time it seemed.  I got in and began to search my pockets for the keys. Shit! I must have dropped them out there. My eyelids started to get so heavy. I took my phone out and held it up, No signal. That's when I started this note I hope someone fi- 

Day 2: The doctors finally came and talked to me earlier this morning and I got to see Jeremiah.  The doctors say they are pretty sure he fell out of the tree stand while getting out. The rifle went off and shot him in the chest. They say he's very lucky to be alive. They think he might have wandered around out there for a while. One doctor pulled me aside and said he seems confused about what happen. Maybe it's the pain medication or the trama of the whole thing. He said just give him time. 

I went in to see him. I told him I read the note.  He kept asking me if they found the old man or the bear. I told him there aren't really any bears around here. As for the man. No one lives within ten miles of where you were found.  He said the bear was right beside his truck roaring before they found him  I told him his head was against the steering wheel pushing the horn. That's how they found him. His delusion scares me a little. 

After a while of talking him through it he seemed to accept he was hallucinating.  That there was no bear,river or old man. After just staring at the ceiling for a while he looked over to the orange hazmat can in the corner.  Sticking out was one sleeve of the flannel shirt he had been wearing.  He asked me to get it for him. 

I don't think I'm supposed to I told him but he insisted. I opened the can and took out the shirt stained with dried blood.  I ask him why he wanted it. He said just wait. He fished around in the front pocket and pulled out two of the strangest looking silver coins I've ever seen.
