This is a true story. I know every story here is true, but I want to stress that this Story, particularly,  is true.

When I was a child, maybe 8 or 9 years old... I had a terrifying experience. One night laying in bed, I saw a tall (8+ foot tall) being standing in the hallway by my bedroom door. It looked human but didn't. The shape was off, and parts of its body were "stick-thin" while the head was large and oval. It seemed to have some kind of "suit of amror" on. It was made up of different colors of light. No skin or metal or anything. Just this fuzzy light that seemed to change color. I screamed in terror, my Dad shouted back and the thing dissapeared. My Dad is a good man and he checked the whole house top to bottom. He was visibly weirded out by what I had claimed to see. We'll as soon as he left me alone again, the thing reappeared. I was literally frozen in fear. The first time I saw it, it was moving slowly and methodically to my door. This time when it reached the door frame it crouched below it to enter my room. I screamed bloody terror. I have never been so terrified in my entire life. Again, my Dad came and this time he said a prayer for me. The thing never returned.

Two nights later I woke in the middle of the night. When I opened my eyes, seated directly next to me, we're two different beings. They had the shape of my mother and father, but again, they were created out of what seemed to be pure light that was alternating, or bleeding, different colors. I can only best describe it like this- It was the shape of my parents but it wasn't my parents, and when i say shape i meant there was a visable outlune to their bodies but thats it. The rest was filled in not with a face or skin or clothing but with this ever changing colorful pattern of light. I was so freaked out that I was too afraid to scream. I crawled back under my covers and stayed there til morning. I never saw either being again.

This moment has always stuck with me. It's a memory I cant shake. I know I witnessed something akin to cosmic horror those evenings. There was something just terribly wrong about it all and I've never really opened up to anyone about it because it makes me feel crazy. 

As I got older I realized something I had not comphrehended when I was a child. One of those beings was physically forced to crouch down to enter my bedroom. Which means it wasnt a hallucination. That being was really there. It had to crouch because of its height. I wasn't seeing things. It actually happened. I'm now 38 years old. 

Has anyone else experienced something like this as a child? I ask because I feel like maybe there is someone out there that has experienced the exact same thing.
