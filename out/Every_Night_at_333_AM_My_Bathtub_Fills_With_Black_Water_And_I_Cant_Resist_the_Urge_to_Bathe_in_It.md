It started a few weeks ago, when my usually peaceful nights were disrupted by something quite unnerving. At exactly 3:33 AM, I would wake up to a gentle but raspy whisper, beckoning me to the bathroom. The first time it happened, I thought I was dreaming. But as the days went by, the whisper grew more persistent, and I couldn't shake the feeling that something was calling me.

My girlfriend, Sarah, remained undisturbed by the whisper, peacefully sleeping beside me as I reluctantly rose from the bed each night. The moment I entered the bathroom, I was greeted by a bathtub filled to the brim with inky black water. It was impossible to see through, and I couldn't help but feel drawn to it.

With each passing night, the urge to bathe in the water became stronger. It felt as if a part of me was incomplete without it. As I began to immerse myself in the dark liquid, I felt a presence near the tub. I couldn't see it, but I could sense it, watching me. I knew, deep down, that I shouldn't look at whatever was lurking in the shadows, but curiosity gnawed at my sanity.

My life began to change. My thoughts were consumed with the black water and the presence by the tub. I became distant from Sarah, and she could sense that something was wrong. But how could I explain it? How could I tell her that every night, I was compelled to bathe in a mysterious black water, with an unseen watcher mere inches from me?

I tried to resist the urge. I tried to ignore the whisper and go back to sleep. But the call was too strong, the need too great. And so, every night at 3:33 AM, I found myself in the bathroom, submerged in the dark liquid.

Each time I bathed, the desire to look at the unseen presence grew stronger. It was as if I could feel its eyes on me, urging me to turn and face whatever horror awaited me. Tonight, I couldn't resist the temptation any longer. I had to know.

As I lay in the black water, I steeled myself for what I was about to do. I took a deep breath and slowly turned my head towards the unseen watcher.

My heart raced, and my body trembled as I laid my eyes upon the figure. I wish I hadn't. I wish I could take it back. But now, it's too late. The horror of what I saw is seared into my mind, and there's no escaping it.

It was me. Or rather, a twisted, distorted version of myself. My doppelgänger's eyes were sunken and hollow, its skin an ashen gray. A sinister grin spread across its face, revealing rows of jagged, black teeth. It spoke in the same whisper that had been luring me to the bathroom all these nights.

"You're one of us now," it hissed.

As I stared into the eyes of my dark twin, I knew that my life was irrevocably changed. I had stepped into a realm of darkness and could never return to the light. I wanted to scream, to call out to Sarah for help, but I knew that it was useless. I am lost to the black water, forever cursed to bathe in it, with my twisted doppelgänger watching and waiting for me every night.

Sarah doesn’t look like us. She is no longer in our apartment. Alone now, I can feel the darkness within me, waiting, biding its time. Every night at 3:33 AM, I can still hear the whisper, the call to return to the black water. But the longer I am tethered to his desires, the more I realize his whispers are lies. I resist, clinging to the last shreds of my humanity.
