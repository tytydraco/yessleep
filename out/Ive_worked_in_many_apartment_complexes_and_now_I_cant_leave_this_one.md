I’m making this post in hopes that nobody else ends up here.

I’m kind of lonely right now, so if I ramble a little I apologize.

I find it unsettling that your space can be exactly like your neighbor's space… Not like in the “Aw, poor baby doesn’t have money to afford a real home?” kind of way. The housing market made sure of that. It’s more a “I can move everything I own next door, and my neighbor can take everything they own into mine, and nothing would change.” kind of way.

Like no matter what you do to be different, you’ll still be able to fit into a mold decided by someone else who makes more money than most people ever will.

You really only understand this once you’ve worked in a lot of apartments. But one complex usually only has two or three different layouts for each apartment. So once you’ve been in a few, you’ve been in every single one in that complex. 

I have had so many instances where I know the layout of an apartment, or a hallway better than the people who actually live there.

But also that person who makes more money than you should at least be able to FUCKING COUNT.  Sure the people who live there know how to get to their one apartment they live in by sheer luck until they have memorized the directions. However, it is mindbendingly infuriating when I think 306 is going to be on the third floor six doors down from one, and some bored millionaire secretly found it hilarious to number the units by the Fibonacci Sequence. Now an 8 hour job just took 12, because I kept getting lost.

That was irrelevant, I’m just really hungry and needed to vent about that before I died.

Basically what I’m saying is, apartment complexes are creepy, so I’m not super stoked about dying in one. Once I realized how much deep shit I am actually in, I holed myself up in one of the apartments here waiting for starvation to make me pass out. 

My hands are already shaking. It doesn’t help that I can’t see a third of my phone.

This job was supposed to be fairly easy. We were changing out all the exit signs to LED. it would have been pretty chill, only a few days, maybe only one if we try hard enough. Even better, Five guys were sent out to do the job: Me, Andrew, Nick, Kristopher, and Randall. We met at the warehouse to grab the product and supplies for the day and all rode in the truck together to the job site.

“You’re working by yourself today,” Nick informed me.

I wasn’t surprised. We usually try our best to break into pairs so that we can work efficiently. Nick and Kristopher were much faster than me, so it made sense to pair the new guys with them. While I felt for whoever got paired with Andrew, I was relieved that at least it didn’t have to be me.

“Sounds good!” I replied. Taking my phone out now so that I could pick what playlist I wanted to listen to for the day.

“Randall, you’re working with Kristopher. Andrew, working with me.” continued Nick.

The others nodded their approval.

I was a little bummed that I wasn’t working with Nick. We spent most of our time talking about indie punk music and arthouse films that I haven’t seen. But this job could potentially be done today, so it made sense that we should all focus instead of screwing around.

I took my fitness tracker off and handed it to Kristopher, asking him to charge it for me. I don’t really work out, but with all the walking I have to do on these jobs, it’s kind of fun to be able to see how many steps I get in every day.

“Go charge it yourself!” Kristopher poked.

“I can’t reach it.” I crooned.

Kristopher plugged it into the charger in the front of the car. I thanked him and turned to Randall, speaking loud enough for Kristopher to hear.

“Man, people can be so mean sometimes.”

Randall smiled as Kristopher told me to shut up or I’ll never get my watch back.

We arrived at the job site and Nick went to tell the Leasing Office we had arrived while the rest of us got to opening boxes and prepping signs. Then after Nick got back, he explained the plan.

“Travis, you start at the top floor, I’ll start second from the top with Andrew. Kristopher, you and Randall can start at the bottom. We’ll meet in the middle if we get all of this done today. Sound good for everybody?”

Agreement spread around the group and we headed inside to the lobby.

“Huh, that’s weird.” muttered Randall.

Everyone else was already thinking it, too, in spite of the fact that this building had 8 stories, there wasn’t an elevator in the lobby.

“Thanks for giving me the top floor, Nick.” I groaned.

“It wasn’t on purpose,” Nick retorted, “Did you think I knew that there wasn’t going to be an elevator?”

“Well now my legs are gonna be sore,” I feigned moping, “and you know how I get with sore legs.” I grabbed my stuff and made my way to the stairwell at the end of the hall.

Kristopher didn’t show it, but I knew he was dancing with glee with his good fortune.

“You three have fun!” called Kristopher, as I put an airpod in and felt The White Stripes melt my frustrations away.

Once I finally reached the top floor, I was exhausted. Carrying a ladder and a box of exit signs at the same time left me gasping for air as I opened the door. Unfortunately, I chuffed a huge swathe of putrid air and immediately choked.

To be completely honest, it wasn’t the worst thing I had ever smelled. I live in Colorado, and offensive odors tend to come with the territory when your state is known for smoking weed. So I assumed my nostrils had been assailed by some concoction of scented candles, burnt incense, and marijuana.

It was simply the smell of rot, I just didn’t know that yet.

I checked my wrist to see how many steps I had gotten already.

“Motherfucker!”

 Where my fitness tracker was supposed to be was just a shitty tan line, because I had forgotten to get the fitness tracker from the car after asking Kristopher to charge it. There was no way I was going to head back down those stairs just for my fitness tracker, so I resigned to change out the exit signs without knowing how many steps I’d put in today.

This wasn’t even the worst of my luck.

I sat down on the floor to give my legs a chance to rest, and started pre-drilling holes into the wall-mounted exit signs. This was when I took the chance to look around the apartment for the first time too. The door numbers, unsurprisingly, didn’t make any sense. The one right outside the stairwell was numbered “10611”, The door to the left was numbered “11344”, and the one after that was “9455”. It was stranger than usual, but I didn’t have to go inside any of them, so I didn’t really mind.  I was also distracted by the unique ways they were painted on the doors; There was no uniformity.

The large, salmon pink numbers were vertical on some of the charcoal grey doors, but others were horizontal. Off in the distance, I could have sworn one of them might have been painted upside down. I want to describe whoever painted these numbers as incredibly drunk. But that wouldn’t make sense. Sure, there was no consistency in how they were placed on the doors, yet they all were individually aligned perfectly. I shrugged and continued working, deciding not to commit too much effort towards thinking about it. I quietly prayed nobody came out and saw a 21-year-old criss-cross-applesauce on the floor of an apartment hallway staring at doors.

“DAMMIT!!”

My drill had gone through an exit sign, piercing my left pocket and jamming against my phone. I frantically pulled my phone out of my pocket, watching a large black blob of damaged LCD spread over the top third of my phone. 

I tried to use it: Functionally the phone worked fine. I could still make calls and listen to music, but there was no more Clash of Clans or doomscrolling Instagram Reels until I got a new phone.

Frustrated, I jammed my phone back into my pocket and went back to work. I pulled hard on an old exit sign, hoping it would break off the bracket when suddenly the lights started to flicker. I stood still for a moment. This was probably my fault. The exit sign was still wired in, and I had most likely shorted a wire from my outburst. I calmed myself down, and took down the sign the rest of the way. 

The lights stopped flickering once I had installed the new exit sign. I sighed in relief, thankful I hadn’t blown a breaker, and continued on with my work.

The hallways forked off in every direction, almost randomly. It felt like a maze. When I thought I had finally reached the end of a hallway, it split off into two more directions, or a door at the end was simply hiding more hallway. It felt like I would never reach the end. I let myself get into a rhythm while Ado screamed Japanese words that I planned on learning some day. There was no reason to rush things. I would be done when I got done.

The lights flickered a few more times while I worked. I paid no mind to them anymore. They seemed old, and most likely just needed to be replaced. Another project for another time. I had become mostly blind to the smell. Whether my olfactory senses had been singed beyond repair, or I just didn’t care anymore, it was a welcome relief.

That was when my music stopped.

It wasn’t in the middle. It just ended. I checked my phone as best I could with the screen damaged and realized my whole playlist had ended. 

“That’s odd.” I said aloud to myself.

This playlist was 8 hours of perfectly procured music I had discovered over the years. If I had reached the end of the playlist, that meant I had been working for 8 whole hours. Given the bad luck with my phone and fitness tracker, I had no other way of knowing what time it was until just now - unless I deliberately went out of my way to look at the clock app on my phone. Why hadn’t anybody called me to say we were done? In fact, there weren’t any notifications at all on my phone. Was there no service in here? No, that didn’t make any sense because I didn’t download my playlist. Where was everybody?

I gathered the trash and my tools and put them in a pile next to my ladder. I decided to go find everybody to get an update on the plan, and then I would return to bring everything downstairs. I also ate one of the two protein bars in my tool bag since I had apparently worked through lunch as well.

It felt like hours until I could find a stairwell. I hadn’t really taken the time to think about it before, but now that I was in the dead silence of the apartment complex, I couldn’t hear anything besides the sounds of my own footsteps and the faint buzzing of dying fluorescent bulbs. It unsettled me. I selected a new playlist and let Dayglow add a lighter tone to the atmosphere just so I had something else to hear besides the droll emptiness. As I thought about it, I hadn’t seen a single person leave or enter an apartment the entire time I was working. I told myself everyone here was just an incel stoner that never left their house.

When I finally found a stairwell, I hurried down the steps as quickly as I could. The emptiness was beginning to drive me mad. I needed to talk to someone, ANYONE!

There was no such luck to be had, however. It was the same crimson hallways with the same pink numbers on the same grey doors in the same disorderly-but-orderly fashion as the floor above. I jogged down the hallways. Something about this place was completely unnerving.

That final thought was what made me begin to run down the halls.

“NICK?!” I shouted, desperately hoping they’d hear me.

“ANDREW!?”

I thought maybe they had gone down to the next floor, but when I tried to retrace my steps, the stairwell wasn’t where it should have been. At least, where I think the stairwell should have been. The door numbers seemed to shift almost every time I looked away from them.

“05678” “73447” “843” “4949” “72” “365412”

It made not a lick of damn sense.

My legs eventually grew weary from running. I slumped against the ground and accepted I was lost. As I breathed heavily, the rank air returned in full force to my nostrils. Maybe I could knock on the doors of people who lived here and ask them for help? I wasn’t a very social person, but desperate times called for desperate measures and I would rather talk to a smelly stoner than be lost for one more second.

So I knocked.

Silence.

“I guess no one is here” I muttered to the empty air around me.

I tried another door. Nothing.

I tried another. And another. And another. But still nothing.

Finally I got so fed up that I just kicked a door down. It was easier than I expected, and the door was weirdly soft, like the inside of a beetle when you step on it, I was then met by an even more foul smell than what had been lurking in the hallways. My eyes teared up from the odor, and I still wish that was the worst thing I experienced in those rooms. As I wiped the tears from my eyes in an attempt to see again, they focused on something even worse.

Human Bones.

They were littered around the room like discarded trash. Somehow, at that moment, the lights began to flicker once again. Horrified, I rushed to the next door, kicked it down and heard it squish as it fell. More bones - but in the corner I saw a person. It wasn’t Nick or Andrew, but somebody I had never met before. 

I screamed, “Holy shit!” The person was conscious, just barely, but conscious. They looked at me, but made no attempt to speak to me or approach me. I couldn’t make out what they looked like. Man? Woman? Child? They were emaciated beyond anything I had ever seen before, and their body seemed to be… melting.

I hurried to them, but wasn’t sure what to do to help. 

“Uhhh…”

What do you do when you watch someone die? I had lost family members and friends before to various diseases and accidents, but this was a total stranger. In the midst of all of this, I pieced together the truth of the smell, but had other things on my mind besides that to worry about.

Their skin continued to melt away and bones were revealed where their tissue once was. They seemed to be moving their lips now. I attempted to lift the mass of skin and bone to my ear as I leaned down but it was sticky and wet, like oatmeal, it even dried on my hand a little as I pulled it away in shock. By now, their lips had stopped moving one. Whatever they were going to say, I had missed the chance to hear them. I looked at where their skin had gone, but it was sinking into the sage green, shag carpet of the apartment.

I didn’t know what to say. I just stared at the flesh as it dissolved into the floor. Grey goo started to stream from the nostrils of the skeleton and I realized that it must have been the brain of the body. The apartment had saved it for last. Like a special dessert after a big meal.

It might have been hours until I stood up again. The horror of what just occurred etched itself into my brain. Every detail, like a movie, permanently stained my conscience. I ran like I never had before. I shouted and screamed the names of my coworkers at the top of my lungs. My throat grew sore from the effort, but there was nothing in response.



Days passed.



Weeks maybe.



I used to check what the time was, but now it’s a waste of effort. I’m trapped here forever. 

I had rationed my food at the beginning, but it was only one protein bar, so that didn’t last me very long.

I did find Nick. He was past the point of saving, already melting into the floor. The lights flickered the whole time he melted too.



Now I’m here.



Alone



Before you ask, yes, I’ve already tried killing myself. In more ways than you can imagine. My tools are long gone, so I can’t use any of those. Everything in here is too soft or too weak for me to kill myself with too. So my only choice is to wait until starvation hits me. Weirdly, dehydration is not a thing here. It seems to enjoy watching others suffer.

I holed myself up in one of the apartments. Apartment number “67123456089”. Now that I’ve had enough time to sit in here, the decor is horrific. The sage green carpet clashes disgustingly with the crimson walls. There’s a mustard yellow couch here, and no TV. There’s still WiFi to the outside world, obviously. It just didn’t want me to contact anybody already inside. I contacted my family, told them I loved them, and now I’m writing this to you at home. Don’t ever come here. You won’t be able to find anyone to save them. If you know someone who’s been here, just grieve them as if they’re dead because they probably already are.



Just please. Don’t. EVER. Come. Here.
