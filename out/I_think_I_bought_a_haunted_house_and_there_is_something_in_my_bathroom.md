 *“A house with a death in it can never again be bought or sold by the living. It can only be borrowed from the ghosts that have stayed behind.”*

I’ve been thinking about this quote a lot.

You see, I think there is a ghost living in my house.

I’m not a superstitious woman. I’m an atheist, I never believed in anything supernatural, never checked out an horoscope or bought a crystal. I don’t believe in the power of the stars, healing through prayer or the little green man that appeared at some farm in Minnesota.

I’m a pragmatist.

And when a wonderful house shows up on the market being sold for a third of what it’s worth, pragmatists are the ones doing the buying.

Yeah, a triple murder had just happened there.

Yeah, the past five years saw three owners commit suicide.

Yeah, one of the previous owners was currently at Saint Lucia House for Mental Health, which meant they had either gone a little insane, or a lot insane.

Yeah, I am aware that a variety of horror movies start exactly this way.

But a third of the price!

I am not particularly worried about suicide, I have no cases of insanity in my family and the triple murder was a father killing his own family, not rampant violence in the area so… big win for me! Big win for Charlotte!

I just turned thirty, I have no family and that’s the kind of house I could only ever buy if I had someone to share the costs with. So, yeah, I bought it!

And it was fine.

Moving in was fine. I had an ocasional look from the neighbours, particularly the one to my right, Mrs. Keelyer, an adorable old lady who kept waving at me but never dared cross the lines into my property no matter how many times I invited her.

She had me over for cake and coffee a couple of times, she would always give me a nice hug and tell me to “*yell* if I needed anything”. She always said the word *yell* as a mother worried for her shield’s safety.

*If a stranger try to grab you, darling, yell. You YELL.*

That’s what I heard every time.

The house itself was beautiful. It didn’t feel like a touch of dark doom or nothing.

It was a lovely two story, five bedrooms, four and a half baths. It was too big for me alone, sure, and you could say the silence depressed me, but it was only my own silence anyway so it was lovely. Specially in the sunset. The light went through the stained glass windows in the back of the house making the whole kitchen dance like a chandelier made of fairies.

I was quickly falling in love with the house.

I was living there for a week before noticing something… odd in the shower.

Whenever I was showering, I would feel a warm puff on my neck, like there was a leak in the wall somewhere and a breeze was coming in. Only it was a warm breeze, in the middle of January. So maybe a pipe leak? The hot water pipe could be leaking enough to push out some air but not enough to leak water?

I’m a pragmatist, so I called a plumber.

He found nothing.

But there was *something*, there *had* to be. 

I kept trying to pinpoint the exact location of… whatever it was. But it seemed to change? It was always against my neck. Against my shoulder. Like someone was breathing on me.

It was driving me insane. Well, not Saint Lucia insane but I’m the kind of woman who likes to see things through. But even though my motives can get a little mad, my means are always sane.

I knew I had to get a little creative so I tried different things, like running a candle up and down the wall to check if the flames would fickle denoucing a draft.

I found nothing.

And then tonight night happened.

I was showering before bed, as I usually do. The door was closed, even though I live alone and the hot water was making the entire place damp. 

I turned the shower off and I felt it again. The thing in my neck. Warm air. Like a fucking invisible stalker breathing his lust on my naked skin. I took a deep breath and was half ready to tear the whole bathroom down and start using one of the other ones, when I felt *something else*.

Something that was equal parts rough and soft. Hot. Moist.

I get startled, my fight or fight instincts kicking in so hard my heart was beating on my throat. I put my hand on my neck to protect it and turn around half expecting to actually find someone there.

I had never owned a house before.

I had never lived so far out of the city before.

I had never bought house insurance before.

But I’ve been licked before.

I know what it feels like.

And that was a tongue.

I grab my neck with both hands looking around the damp bathroom, drops of water sliding down the walls and the blurry mirror.

The lights don’t fickle. There is no whisper. No noise outside the bathroom. No turning of the door knob. And yet I feel like I’m in a horror movie.

*Mother! Oh, God, mother! Blood! Blood!*

I take another deep breath.

“*Charlie”* I say out loud to myself “It was just your imagination”

I hold, still lost in dread, waiting for something to reply to my comment.

But nothing does.

Cause it was, you see, just my imagination.

I let my shoulders fall as I take another deep breath, smiling to myself. This is how ghost stories begin: with tired and stressed people thinking they saw what they didn’t see.

I stretch my arms and reach out from my towel when goosebumps take over my spine.

Another breathing.

Another tongue.

*Fuck sake*, this time I’m sure. I turn so fast I hit the shampoo stand pushing everything to the floor.

I get wrapped in a towel and lock myself in my room.

I check every corner of it with my phone’s flashlight and a pocket knife.

I wanna call the police and my friends and CNN, but… what am I gonna say?

It’s a big quiet house. I’m scaring myself.

How sure am I even that it was a tongue?

Sleeping doesn’t come easy and waking comes with a resolve: when I shower tonight, I’m gonna leave my camera on.

And that’s exactly what I do.

I put my tablet on a tripod and set to record. I use the front camera so I can see myself on the screen while I shower. I put the tripod high enough so it can see nearly the whole bathroom.

I shower like I’m expecting an attack. Soaping and shampooing. Half afraid to close my eyes.

After ten minutes I’m feeling like an idiot.

I imagined something.

I overreacted.

I will never tell anyone about this.

I am about to turn off the shower when I feel it. It happens so casually. Like being hit by a bullet that wasn’t even meant for you. Just a bzz and it’s done. No denying, no going back. A breathing behind my ear. A long lick up my nape.

This time I freeze.

Waiting.

*Close your eyes, Charlie*. 

The water is still running but I’m not under it.

There is nothing around me. No draft of air, no moistness touching my body except for the humid air. I am sure of this. I *am sure*.

And it happens again.

*I can hear the breathing this time*.

I jump out of the shower. I am alone feeling tongues.

I look at the tablet to see if it’s still recording. I need to watch it to find out if something did happen.

There is no need to replay it though.

Clear as day, I can see it on the screen.

The bathroom’s old tiles and beige decor. The white claw bathtub on one side, the shower on the other, the blurry mirror, me staring at the camera with a look of death on my face and behind me, *a woman*.

She is in the shower. She is a wearing a yellow dress, standing under the running water which is making her completely wet. Her thin white hair soaked and glued to her pale sick face. She is taller than me. Too tall. Her eyes are like hollow holes, void of life except for a strange yellow glow about them.

I turn around and… *nothing.*

There is nothing there.

Except *there is*.

I can see it through the camera, I can not see it through my eyes.

She stands there, staring back at me as I try to stare at her. Tilting her head to inspect me, as if she finds my curiosity to be curious.

I can barely hear myself think.

All I hear is my heart pounding so loud it must be echoing on the walls.

*What in God’s name*…

I am shaking.

I look to the shower one last time. *Empty*. Completely empty. Just the tiles, and the shampoo, and the soap and the water. Just my plain normal bathroom.

I look back at the screen and the woman is moving. She took a step out of the shower. She has her tongue half way out of her mouth, not in a sexual way but in a *hungry* one. As if she is tasting me because she is considering eating me. Her arm reaches towards me with intent.

I run back so suddenly that I nearly trip. The bathroom door is still locked, I unlock it and run to my room to lock myself in there.

Can she follow me?

I get dressed without drying myself. I can still hear the shower running but I am afraid to go turn it off.

I pick up my phone and point my camera to the bedroom door. I sit on my bed and stay like this for hours. Trusting my camera more than I trust my eyes.

There is a feeling of certainty that she is gonna follow me, but she never does.

And I honestly don’t know what is worst, the waiting or the finding out.

I don’t know what just happened.

I’m not sure what to do.

But I will think of something.

I’ll keep you updated.
