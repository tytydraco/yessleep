This has been on my mind for a while but I want to talk about it and figure out how I can navigate and heal from this situation I’m going to explain. Okay so when I was 15 years old, my parents decided to move from a diverse lower middle class to middle class town to a very wealthy town for the school system, I was unaware of classism, racism and elitism that went around in that environment, because I simply wasn’t use to it. I went to high school in this very rich non-diverse town, which was predominantly white. I befriended this girl who happened to be extremely wealthy(who was also Indian) I wasn’t aware that she was THAT rich as I came from a lower middle to middle class background. I felt uncomfortable because I just felt like I wasn’t smart enough for the academics and I had a learning disability so I felt ashamed.

 She was very manipulative and always make these weird comments about race. Like I’m Indian American and as an Indian immigrant my family worked hard to get to where they are now, and they are proud of their heritage and their roots. So basically when this rich girl used to talk to me she used to constantly compare me to other races and make weird racists and classists comments like “people of color are oppressed” or “Palestinians are oppressed” or “Muslims are oppressed” I’m Hindu, Im not Muslim? I felt uncomfortable and offended that she kept comparing me to races I’m not, and I felt irritated, uncomfortable and patronized. 

She would constantly make degrading, rude, condescending remarks about other girls/women, she would call use very degrading words to describe women. She calls her male partners “assets" where she sets girls up with her boyfriends (assets like she mentioned earlier) and then those guys steal financial resources from the girls family. Her comments made me feel super uncomfortable, but she kept face-timing me again and again with making up stories that were all lies (I didn’t found out until much much later,unfortunately).  

When I was 18y.o. she groomed me into meeting a man 10 years older (28 y.o.) than me who ended up taking advantage of my naivety. He was very abusive, exploitive and disrespectful asf. From my understanding this man preys on young vulnerable immigrant girls stalks where their dad works and gets them laid off, then sleeps with their daughters. The man she manipulated to meet, later SA’ed me as well. The guy himself was Muslim, which is ironic because she kept talking about how “Muslims are oppressed” but he is Muslim and he is not “oppressed” I don’t know its just weird. Even though I don’t know this guy, but I keep stalking him and his family on social media.

 I get jealous and bitter because of the way he treated me and end up getting in a very toxic thinking cycle, where I think that this guy preyed on me because of my race and ethnic background. Like he is dating and married to someone who comes from the same socioeconomic background as me, it makes me feel bitter and hurts me that he did what he did to me. He stole my innocence from me and I’m hurt, because I’m not a skank or some kind of sex worker. I feel so stupid, that I let myself me coerced and manipulated into doing stuff with this guy. When I should’ve known better, I didn’t know this guys, not I was in a relationship with him, he wasn’t the same faith as me, he was ten years older than me, and he worked at Goldman Sachs. I had no business in meeting this guy. He made fun of me and was gossiping behind my back, boasting about his “accomplishments” and it hurt so much, because he was so disrespectful,aggressive and hostile towards me.

 I wasn’t in a relationship or anything ever, but I’m hurting so much, because its like why is he an asshole to me but not other girls? I don’t want to be treated like that, its like I lost my self respect and self worth. Its unfair like he wouldn’t do that to Muslim girls but then why would he do that to me? All I see on social media is him smiling and being happy with his family when he literally oppressed my family.  They pretend they’re “white” or have “white privilege” because they’re rich. Its like other PoC girls don’t have to go through this, but then why me? I guess that rich girl wanted to paint me as if I’m stupid to justify her greed and immoral behavior/actions towards me and my family. I just hate being gaslit and forced to believe something I’m not. I don’t deserve this, no one does. Does anyone have any advice on how to heal from this?
