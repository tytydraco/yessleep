For context: This is a story that happened in the Philippines. He's in our walls. Dont blink.

In the Batangas province, we have a house that serves as a rest house, but it has gotten too much. I've noticed that whenever there are visitors, it.. welcomes them. Now, We currently have 2 houses in a single plot that is at least 2 hectares or so, and it has a forest just behind the houses. Before, it was 3, including the bahay kubo (hut) in a secluded corner of the land, used as a storage room. It recently got removed because of this reason, although it still lurks around.

From the start of building the foundation of the first house, it has always been stuck with me. Me and my mom can see it whenever we go to the forest behind the house to feed our animals every 6am and 4pm(we have a farm). 

My first encounter was when I was 10 when we first moved into the house. I can see him everywhere. Lurking like a stalker. His body wasn't like a human or a creature. Just.. terrifying. I wanted to scream and move, but nothing worked. I just.. stood there, face-to-face. I don't know exactly what it is, but it was very tall. Let's just call it Bantay (guardian). It is taller than the hut. I would say 6 rulers just by the neck. It was built like a soldier, with stiff shoulders and would always look like it broke all of its bones whenever it would crawl and disappear. I hated it.

Whenever a visitor or a family relative comes over and sleeps here, they would always leave the house with a story. i.e. The recent family relative that stayed here told us that he saw Bantay walking around the floor they were on whilst sleeping. There wasn't one, but two. Bantay was searching for something till it locked eyes with my relative. And when he blinked, it got closer.. and closer.. till it went away. 

There was this one time I was sleeping alone in my room; It was a dark night. Everything is so quiet that you can hear your blood cells when you sleep on your side. 

*clack*

I turned to look out my window, but no one was there. I didn't mind it cause it might just be the trees above.

*clack*
*pause*
*clack*

It continued till 2:09 am; I couldn't sleep. I faced my back against the wall so that I could see the whole room more clearly in my vision. I prayed to the Holy Mary and Our Father out of fear.
Then,

*clack*
*clack*
*clack*

It was in 3s. For sure it was mocking the Holy Trinity. It stopped when the sun was beginning to shine. I couldn't sleep normally after that.

My theory is that the previous owners of this plot died and couldn't accept the fact that someone took over. I don't know for a fact what truly happened or why they're here. But I do know that they guard the land and haven't tried to harm me and my family. I'm 16, and we haven't blessed the house.

He's everywhere.
