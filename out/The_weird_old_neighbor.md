This happened about four years ago, and I swear it’s 100% true.

My aunt had just moved into a new apartment in a residential complex. It was summer, I had just started high school, and I went to stay with her for a while. The apartment had two bedrooms—my aunt had one, and I shared the other with my older cousin, who was nine years older than me.

Since the room was small, we shared a bed. Because the electrical outlets were weirdly placed—one at the head and one at the foot—we ended up sleeping in opposite directions. She slept with her head at the top of the bed, I slept with my head at the foot.

Right above her head was a large window facing another apartment building in the same complex. From where I lay, I had a perfect view straight into the apartment directly across from us.

Now, my cousin always went to bed early. But I was a night owl—I usually stayed up until around 5 AM. And that’s when I noticed something weird.

Every single night, without fail, at exactly **4:02 AM**, the light in that apartment would turn on. Just one light, in one specific room. And at exactly **4:05 AM**, it would turn off.

Never earlier. Never later. Three minutes. Every. Single. Night.

At first I brushed it off, but it happened so consistently that I got curious. One night, I asked my cousin to stay up and watch it with me. Sure enough—4:02, light turns on. 4:05, off. She was so creeped out, she told my aunt the next morning.

We were all unsettled, but mostly curious. A few days later, we decided to visit the apartment and ask. A woman in her 40s opened the door—she looked kind and humble, but tired. She told us she was the daytime caregiver for the woman who lived there: an 80-something-year-old who had been completely paralyzed after a stroke. The old woman could only move her mouth and eyes.

She had no husband, no children, no family. Just a small pension that barely covered this caregiver, who could only work from **6 AM to 11 PM** because that old lady didn't have enough money to hire her to stay overnight.

Which means—from 11 PM to 6 AM—the old woman was completely alone.

Then the caregiver said something that made all of us go silent:

The old woman had a severe eye condition. She was extremely sensitive to light and had *begged* the caregiver to never turn on any lights in the house. Especially not at night.

But we had seen that living room light turn on at 4:02 AM every single night.

And according to the caregiver, the old woman never even left her bedroom.

After that, we kind of panicked. We just thanked her and left.

I still can’t explain it.  
The precision. The timing. The fact that it stopped happening **immediately** after the old woman passed away.

To this day, we still talk about it. None of us can make sense of it.  
Was it a glitch? A ghost? Something else entirely?

If anyone has ever heard of anything like this… please let me know.
