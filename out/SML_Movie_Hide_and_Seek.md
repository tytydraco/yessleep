Hi, I’m a huge SML fan,I got the notifications all on and subscribed, I remember one episode that got mysteriously deleted, I don’t know why it got deleted but I theorize the demonetization (aka the ad-pocalypse). The episode was 2 or 3 minutes, the episode was uploaded 2017 in may 17, and got deleted (I think) in the same month in the 29th.

 The episode starts in the red couch (obviously) and starts of with Junior saying “What should we Do today!”, Cody respond “Idk, what do you want to do”, Joseph thinks and then immediately says with a high pitched voice “Dude.., WE should play hide and seek, you know where you hide from the other person (aka the seeker) it would be fun!” Junior looks at Joseph and then Cody, and then says realizing “yk, that would be fun actually, since we don’t know what to do”, Joseph responds immediately after Junior “ok, I’m the seeker you guys are the hiders”, Both Cody and Junior respond “no fair!, we want to be a seeker!” Joseph shouts and says “Is It because IM BLACK huh! huh!” Junior responds “I own this house so I get to be seeker!” Junior,Joseph and Cody both argued for about like 10 seconds before deciding to have only Junior to be the hider.


 Junior hides in the nearest closet that he can find. Joseph and Cody both stop counting and shout out loudly “Here I come!”, Junior giggles to himself as he peaks outside of the closet, Cody and Joseph say “where are you…”, Junior says mistakenly responds “he-!”, Junior says to his mind “OH SHI-!” Cody and Joseph walk towards the closet juniors in, and grabbed Junior by the shoulders and yanked Junior out of the closet, Junior says while stomping on the floor and shouts “No fair!”. Joseph joked and said “Haha! You got tagged,lol, Haha!” Cody said “let’s have Junior try again considering he was probably not intentionally saying it out loud.” Joseph and Junior both looked at Cody and responds “ok, sure”! I was pretty bored so I skipped through the episode and found them at school, they we’re probably at the mall or something but that’s what I remember, moving on Cody was the seeker and both Junior and Joseph were the hiders, as Cody was counting down Junior and Joseph run to A hiding spot they thought was the greatest hiding spot on the entire planet. 




Cody looked around the school to find Junior or Joseph, Cody stumbled across a shadow walking towards him, Cody screamed but then realizing it was just the security guy (aka Brooklyn t guy) that was in shock after stumbling across him and said “Kid what are you doing here!” Cody said nervously “s-S-ir.. I was just playing hide and seek, nothing wrong here..” the security guy responds calmly “kid… we’re investigating a crime scene in this school, so get out of here before I do it myself.”Junior grabbed the wall and peaked throughout the wall and giggled, Cody confused says “what crime?..” Brooklyn guy kinda shocked and said “kid.. there’s dead people are in the floor throughout the school that got mysteriously killed by something that does not want to be nice, like yeah..” as Cody kinda shocked walked out of the way of the security guard and accidentally steps on a dead body censored for you know… , Cody screams, while the security guard looks at Cody and says “yea, be careful kid..” my thoughts were like empty and kinda disturbed and almost wanted to exit the video cause how horrific the sentence was. But I still was watching it like a thing was forcing me to do it. Junior slowly got out of sight and then the next shot is Junior’s breathing heavily and was thinking about it constantly, Cody got in front of Junior’s sight and then Cody understands why junior was breathing so heavily, While Junior was screaming and in shock at the same.


Cody smiles and grabbed a lighter, Junior was kinda shocked and surprised by why Cody has a lighter,  Cody ”accidentally” drops the lighter and flames started to appear, abrupt screams start to happen and Cody and Junior start to run from the school and reach the exit. Junior looked at the exit and said sadly “Bye.. Bye school”. I was disturbed by this ending, and closed my phone, and planned to forget this episode ever existed but it took over my mind as which i keep remembering that episode. It’s like a demon mind controlled me to remember that episode.
