 

I live in a tiny town in rural Pennsylvania, tucked deep in the Appalachian foothills. The kind of place where you wave at every car that passes and never bother locking your front door. I grew up here, left for college, and then—like a fool—came back.

I inherited my grandfather’s old cabin after he passed last fall. It’s miles from the nearest neighbor, surrounded by nothing but forest. I moved in to clear my head and “reconnect with nature,” as my therapist said.

Two weeks ago, I noticed something strange: the woods went quiet. No birds, no crickets. Just dead air. At first, I chalked it up to the weather, maybe a 
Predator in the area. But it didn’t go away.
Then my dog, Maggie, started acting weird. She’d growl at the tree line, hair bristled, tail between her legs. One night she refused to go outside at all, whimpering and hiding behind the couch.

I figured I’d catch whatever it was on a trail cam. So I set one up about 50 yards into the woods behind the cabin, facing a game trail my grandfather used to hunt.

I checked the footage the next morning. The camera had gone off around 2:13 a.m. I scrolled through raccoons, deer, then—

A figure. Pale. Hairless. Human-shaped, but twisted. It crawled on all fours, with arms too long and legs bent the wrong way. The eyes reflected like an animal’s, bright and emotionless. It looked directly at the camera—then smiled.

I slammed my laptop shut.

I didn’t sleep that night. Or the next.

Three nights ago, I woke up to Maggie growling again. Low and deep. I grabbed my flashlight and stepped outside. The woods were still dead quiet. I scanned the trees. Nothing. I was about to go back inside when I saw it.

Something moved.

Crawling just at the edge of the light. Fast, jerky—like a spider learning to walk on human limbs. It vanished behind a tree.

I ran back inside, locked the door, and nailed a chair under the handle. Maggie barked once—then whimpered and hid.
The next morning, I found claw marks on the back door. Deep, three-pronged scratches, as if something had tested the wood. The trail cam was gone. Just… ripped off the tree. No sign of it anywhere.

Then, That afternoon, I drove into town and told the game warden. He laughed. Said it was probably a bear or a sick coyote. But bears don’t smile for the camera, But some part of me wanted to believe that was what I saw.

Last night, it came back.

I didn’t see it—I heard it. Around 2 a.m., scratching at the windows. Light, deliberate. Then came the whispering. Not words I could understand. Just… noise. Like someone trying to mimic human speech through a throat not meant for it.
I stayed frozen in bed, shotgun on my lap, until sunrise.

I’m leaving today. I’ve packed everything I can fit in my truck. I don’t care if the cabin burns to the ground.

But before I go, I have to post this. Because I checked my grandfather’s old journals this morning. He knew. He wrote about it. Called it “The Pale One” or sometimes just “Him.” Said it has been watching the house since near the end of 1983. The entry Said it never came inside, as long as the doors stayed locked and the woods were respected.
Then I flipped to the final page of the journal.

The last entry, dated May 17, 1996, just said:

“If you hear Him whisper, don’t listen. If you see Him smile, run. And if you ever find the camera, destroy it."

I've destroyed the camera, but one thing, one, very confusing thing keeps happening.

Every night, intead of my dog barking into the vast emptiness of the surrounding wilderness, she growls and yelps while staring directly at my cellar door.
