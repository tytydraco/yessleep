Plato spent the night with that cube in his palm, and by morning he looked like he hadn't slept in weeks. His eyes were bloodshot and ringed with black dust that wouldn't wash off, no matter how many times he scrubbed at them. He kept whispering to it. Or maybe it was whispering to him. Hard to tell.

"We gotta read that whole journal, man," he said, voice flatter than it should've been. "Every damn page. Can't just skim the greatest hits."

I'd shoved it to the bottom of my pack after we decided to stay, trying not to think about the warnings carved into that shack. But Plato was right. If we were going to understand what the fuck we were digging up, we needed to know what happened the last time someone tried.

We waited until the morning shift started, then slipped away into the woods. The shack felt different in daylight. Less haunted, more sad. Just rotted wood and desperate graffiti. We sat on the filthy floor and spread the journal between us.

The pages were stuck together in places. Not with age or water damage. With something clear and oily that caught the light like glycerin, a preservative that had kept the paper intact for decades. When I peeled two pages apart, the slime stretched between them in sticky threads before snapping. It smelled faintly of ozone. Of the hole.

The early entries were mundane. A local man documenting the Company's arrival in 1953. Men in suits who paid in cash and asked no questions. A crew of desperate workers who showed up one day and started digging with no explanation. Equipment that appeared overnight. The same lie about building something, never about excavating.

Then the sickness started.

*June 14 - Three men coughing up black dust. Company doctor says it's just coal residue but we're not mining coal. The dust tastes wrong. Metallic.*

*June 19 - Michaels hearing whispers from the rocks. Says they're speaking a language he almost understands. Company doc gave him pills. He stopped complaining but his eyes went flat.*

*June 27 - They're not looking for minerals. Overheard the suits talking. They want "God Stones" Don't know what that means but the way they said it made my skin crawl.*

Plato's finger stopped on that line. "The God stones. What the fuck is that?"

I didn't answer because I was reading ahead, my mouth going dry.

*July 2 - Found the first black stone today. The suits lost their minds. Paid triple bonuses. But the stone does something to you. It answers. Not with words. With feelings. With knowing. Like it's trying to teach you something you shouldn't learn.*

*July 8 - It answers the noise. The hole is full of noise now. Humming, breathing, whispering. The more we bring up.*

The handwriting got shakier after that. More frantic. Pages covered in those spiraling symbols mixed with words that didn't quite make sense. The final legible entry, dated July 15, 1953:

*They're sending everyone down at once. All hands. Looking for the God Stones. But the men who come up aren't the same. They move wrong. Talk wrong. Yesterday I saw Parker standing at the edge, just staring down into it for six hours straight without blinking. When I asked if he was okay, he smiled and said "The signal is very clear from here." I'm leaving tonight. If you're reading this, don't bring up the stones. Don't go down. Don't—*

The rest was that slime, preserving blank pages. Or pages that had been torn out.

"It answers the noise," Plato repeated softly. He was turning the cube over in his hands, watching light slide across its impossible surface. "We're teaching it we're here."

"Put that thing away, man. Seriously."

He looked at me with those bloodshot eyes and smiled. Not his smile. Something else wearing his face. "Don't you want to know what it says?"

"No. I really fucking don't."

That's when we heard footsteps on the brittle floorboards behind us.

Jim stood in the doorway, backlit by morning sun, looking older than he had any right to. Not angry. Just tired. Resigned in a way that was somehow worse than fury.

"So you found it too," he said quietly. "The journal. I read it years ago. First time I worked this site."

"First time?" My voice cracked. "You've been here before?"

"Three times. Different crews. Same hole. Same Company. Same lies." He leaned against the doorframe like standing was taking too much effort. "They keep coming back. Every decade or so. Different name, different paperwork, same fucking dig. And people keep dying or disappearing or changing in ways that make dying look like mercy."

"Then why did you come back?" Plato asked.

Jim's laugh was bitter. "Same reason you stayed after Ray. Same algorithm, different platform. They cracked the code - figured out the exact price point where desperation overrides survival instinct. You're not workers, you're users. And the product? Your fucking compliance."

Plato stood up, still holding the cube. The morning light hit it at an angle and for just a second it seemed to glow from within, that iridescent blue pulsing like a heartbeat.

The forest went silent.

Not gradually. Instantly. Every bird, every insect, every rustle of wind through leaves. The air went thick and heavy, pressing against my eardrums like I'd descended too fast in an airplane. My breath fogged despite the warm morning.

"Put it away," Jim whispered, backing toward the door. "Put it the fuck away right now."

But Plato was staring past him, into the tree line, and that wrong smile was spreading across his face.

"Do you see them?" he asked, voice full of wonder and horror in equal measure.

I looked.

At first I thought they were trees. Then I thought they were shadows. Then my eyes adjusted and I realized they were men. Or had been. Dozens of them, standing at the edge of the clearing in perfect silence, watching us with empty eye sockets. Their skin was gray, covered in fine black dust like coal miners who'd never washed. Some wore clothes from decades ago. Overalls and work shirts rotted to threads. Others were older, dressed in styles I didn't recognize.

They didn't move. Didn't breathe. Just stood there, watching the cube with that terrible hungry attention.

"Soot-men," Jim breathed. "Oh fuck. Oh Jesus fuck, they're manifesting in daylight."

Every part of me wanted to bolt. Legs screaming run, brain trying to check out, bladder about to make me piss myself like a little kid. This wasn't movie horror or some fucked-up website.This was wrong on a level that bypassed thought and went straight to the primitive part of your brain that knows when you're prey.

Plato stepped forward.

Toward them.

"Plato, don't—"

"They're drawn to it, man," he said, but the 'man' sounded like he was trying to remember how people talked. "Like moths to a really fucked-up flame."

One of the figures took a step forward. Its foot made no sound on the forest floor.

Plato let out a laugh. A short, sharp sound like a lock clicking open. Nothing human about it.

Jim bolted. Just turned and ran, crashing through the underbrush with the desperate speed of a man who'd seen this before and knew how it ended. I wanted to follow. Every instinct screamed at me to follow.

But Plato was still walking toward them, cube extended like an offering, and I couldn't leave him alone with those things.

"Plato. Please. We need to go."

He stopped, swaying slightly, then slowly turned back to me. The smile faded. For just a second I saw my friend again, confused, scared, realizing he'd walked too close to something terrible.

"Yeah," he said shakily. "Yeah, okay. Let's... let's go."

The figures didn't follow us back to camp. They just stood there, watching, until we lost sight of them through the trees. Felt their eyes on us like spiders crawling up my spine. Had to check my boxers when we got back to make sure I hadn't actually shit myself.

Back at camp, Plato collapsed into our tent and was asleep within seconds, the cube still clutched in his fist. I sat outside, shaking, watching the tree line for movement. Wondering if those things could cross into the clearing. Wondering if they were already here and I just couldn't see them yet.

___

I must have dozed off eventually because I woke to shouting.

The whole camp was up, crowding toward the shack. Dawn was just breaking. I scrambled out of the tent and ran after them, my heart already sinking because I knew, I fucking knew something had gone wrong.

Jim was standing on the shack's collapsing porch, holding the cube above his head like a prophet with a holy relic. His eyes were wild, spit flying from his mouth as he preached to the gathered crew in a voice that cracked and soared.

"You think this is a job?" he shouted. "You think they're paying you to dig? You're digging up a god's grave! You're bringing up pieces of something that was buried for a reason! The mountain kept them safe! Kept them sleeping! And we're waking them up piece by piece!"

The crew was paralyzed. Not by his words. By something deeper. That contagious hysteria that turns crowds into mobs. I could see it spreading. The wide eyes, the shaking hands, They moved together like they were all tuned to the same fucked-up radio station.

"We have to give it back!" Jim screamed, shaking the cube. "Put it back in the hole! Put it all back before—"

Buzz came out of nowhere.

A straight punch to Jim's jaw that sent him sprawling off the porch into the dirt. The cube tumbled from his hand. Buzz scooped it up, triumph and rage warring on his face.

Then he went pale.

I watched the color drain from his skin as his fingers closed around the cube. His eyes went wide. His mouth opened but no sound came out. He was feeling it. Whatever Plato felt. Whatever Jim felt. The wrongness of it singing directly into his nervous system.

His hand shook. The cube nearly slipped from his fingers.

"Work's called off today," he said in a thin, hollow voice. "Everybody... everybody just stay in camp. Don't go near the hole."

His authority died right there. You could see it in the crew's faces. Fear was one thing. Orders from a scared man were nothing. He stumbled away toward his trailer, still clutching the cube, moving like he'd aged thirty years in thirty seconds.

Figured Jim must've jacked it while we were passed out. I booked it back to camp, but Plato was gone. Fucking gone.

That night, drunk on whatever cheap vodka he'd smuggled up the mountain, Buzz tried to get his power back the old-fashioned way.

He found Jim at the edge of camp and pulled a knife.

"You made me look weak," he slurred, swaying on his feet. "In front of the whole fucking crew. Nobody does that. Nobody."

Jim didn't flinch. Just looked at him with that hollow, resigned expression. "You did that yourself the second you touched the cube."

Buzz lunged.

What happened next took maybe three seconds but felt like watching a nature documentary. Jim moved with the casual efficiency of someone who'd been in a hundred bar fights and knew exactly how much violence was necessary. He sidestepped, caught Buzz's wrist, twisted. The knife clattered into the dirt. Then Jim picked up his own knife from his belt, looked at it for a long moment, and threw it into the dark woods.

"I'm not fighting you," he said quietly. "The mountain's enemy enough for all of us."

Buzz stood there, disarmed and humiliated, making sounds that might have been crying or might have been laughter. He screamed something incoherent at the sky and stumbled away into the dark.

The crew watched in silence. Nobody helped him. Nobody followed.

"Gentlemen."

The voice came from the darkness beyond the generator lights. Soft. Polite. Utterly chilling.

Joseph stepped into the clearing like he'd been waiting there all along, briefcase in hand, suit somehow still pristine. He didn't acknowledge Buzz's screaming or Jim's knife or the cube lying in the dirt. Just looked at us with those empty eyes and delivered his message in a voice that could've been discussing quarterly earnings.

"Stakeholder engagement indicates suboptimal velocity on deliverables. We're pivoting to an accelerated extraction model with enhanced productivity metrics: Get more stones within seventy-two hours. 

No more distractions. 

No more delays. 

Inability to achieve these benchmarks will necessitate resource reallocation and talent optimization strategies."

He let that last word hang in the cold air. Replacement.

Not termination. Not firing. Replacement.

Then he turned and walked back into the darkness, dress shoes crunching on gravel, and was gone.

Nobody slept that night. We just sat around the dying fire, not talking, not looking at each other. Buzz's screaming had faded to whimpering somewhere in the woods. The cube sat in the dirt where Jim had dropped it, and nobody wanted to touch it.

Woke up feeling like someone had taken a dump in my skull. Gray as hell and twice as depressing. No Buzz. No orders. The crew just sat there, listless and waiting for something they couldn't name.

Jim was the one who noticed the winch cable was taut.

"That's weighted," he said, voice flat. "Someone's on the line."

We gathered at the edge. The cable stretched down into the hole, disappearing into that perfect darkness, pulled tight under significant weight.

"Buzz?" someone called down. No answer. Just the hole's breathing.

It took four of us to work the winch, hauling up whatever was down there. The cable groaned. Something heavy. Something wrong.

Twenty feet down, on the narrow ledge where that first boulder sat, we saw him.

Buzz.

Not fallen. Placed. Sitting upright with his back against the cut earth, head lolled to one side, eyes wide open and staring at nothing. His skin was dry and pale, like paper. No blood. No wounds. No sign of struggle. He just looked empty. Scooped out from the inside.

His pocket was turned inside out. The cube was gone.

Message received loud and clear. The hole don't like losers. Don't like smartasses either. Buzz fucked around and found out.

We left him there. Nobody said it out loud, but we all knew going down to retrieve him meant becoming the next thing placed on that ledge. As I turned over to the hole, and saw Plato, just looking down at him, nothing much to say.

Joseph appeared at lunch with new envelopes. Thicker ones. "Incentive bonuses," he said in that soft voice. "For continued dedication."

"We took them. Course we fucking took them. I'd been eating ketchup packets for lunch. Joseph could've been Satan himself and I'd still have taken that blood money."

And that afternoon, we went back to digging.

*There's little Tom Dacre, who cried when his head*

*That curled like a lambs back, was shaved, so I said.*

*Hush Tom never mind it, for when your head's bare,*

*You know that the soot cannot spoil your white hair.*
