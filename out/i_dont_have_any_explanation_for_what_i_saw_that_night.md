So this was approx. 2 years ago. I lived in a hostel at that time and staying up late till 2 or 4 is normal there.
It was quite dramatic in the way it happened making it hard for anyone i tell this, to believe. It was raining and at around 12 i decided to cry in some lonely corner over my unrequited love. Yes. Since it's tough to find privacy in a girl's hostel i decided I'd sit where the stairs end at top. I don't know if they have a word for that place. These stairs led to the roof of our hostel but it's been locked off since forever for fear that some idiot might think it'd be a great idea to commit suicide by jumping off a 2 storey building. Anyway, it's always locked but the door at the bottom has around 8 to 10 inches wide gap. In short, one can easily detect someone walking around it on the other side. So after a good 15 minutes or so of crying over stupid stuff i hear the door behind me shake, and the lock on it beats against it. I shake it off thinking it's nothing but the wind due to the bad weather. And then, i hear footsteps of someone running behind me parallel to the gate. I look back and i fk u not i did seee what looked like a person's feet behind a door that's looked from my side. After a second of processing my brain took in wht just happened and i bolted down the stairs at the speed of fking light!!! I didn't sleep the entire night, i had goosebumps all over my body for 2 days.

Now, what makes this weird and hard for me to understand is i know this place. There's no other building attached on any of the sides to our hostel.
Our hostel is within the college premises and even then i don't see any intelligible reason for a person to climb up there unless they r some new species of creep.
Other hostelers said it might have been either a monkey or a cat. Now there ain't no monkey in that place because ive lived there and know this for a sure fact that there ain't no macaques hangin round at night in that area.
As for cats my friends, what species of cats runs like fking hulk I'd definitely like to know.ðŸ—¿
Plus i saw it. And i know both a cat and the macaques possess short-ish legs unlike those hulk feet that my eyes witnessed. 
There's no other animal species in that area with aerobic abilities either. 
I don't know what i saw and heard. 
I went to that place after 2 years to shale the fear off and even though nothing happened i still felt an eerie feeling about the place. I've lived in that hostel all alone for over a week and nothing happened even then.
Except for a cat showing up twice to stare at me at 3 in the night ive never witnessed anything so absurd as that again.
That's my story. And it's as real as i am.
