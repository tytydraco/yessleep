The job posting disappeared the same day I applied. I remember because I tried to send it to a friend as a joke. “Look at this, easy money” and the link just… didn’t work anymore. No error page, no redirect. Just gone, they still emailed me back.

The message was short, no logo, no company name; night security, twelve-hour shifts, do not leave your post, do not investigate alarms unless instructed and 28/hour. Reply YES to accept.

I should’ve thought harder about it. I didn’t, rent was due and I desperately needed the money. The building was already there when I arrived for my first shift, like it had always belonged on that street. Six floors, no signage, no windows on the ground level. Just concrete, steel, and a single door that unlocked when I pressed my thumb to the scanner, despite never giving them my fingerprints. Inside, the lobby was empty except for a desk, a chair, and a monitor wall showing camera feeds.

My supervisor appeared on-screen at exactly 7:00 p.m. He never gave me his name. “You are here to observe,” he said. “Not intervene, not explore. If something occurs, you document it.”

“Something like what?” I asked. He smiled slightly. “You’ll know.”

The rules were printed and laminated on the desk: 
1. Do not leave the lobby between 9:00 p.m. and 5:00 a.m.
2. If you hear footsteps, do not look toward the sound.
3. If an alarm sounds, wait for instructions.
4. If someone asks you to let them out, do not respond.
5. If you see yourself on the cameras, log the time and look away.

I laughed at that last one. The first night was quiet, too quiet. No deliveries, no staff, no cleaning crews. The cameras showed hallways, stairwells, and rooms full of shelves covered in white sheets. At 9:07 p.m. on my fourth night, I heard footsteps, they came from behind me. Slow, bare, careful.

I remembered rule number 2 and stared straight ahead, forcing my eyes to stay on the monitors. The sound stopped directly behind my chair. I felt breath against my neck, cold, dry, patient.

A whisper followed. “You missed a spot.” I didn’t move. After a long moment, the pressure behind me vanished. The footsteps resumed, fading down a hallway I knew didn’t connect to the lobby.

At 11:30 p.m., an alarm went off. Camera 14, the screen showed a door I hadn’t noticed before, thick metal, covered in warning labels I couldn’t quite read. Someone stood on the other side, pounding softly, rhythmically. Not panicked, polite. 

The intercom crackled. “Do not approach,” my supervisor said calmly. “Log it.” The pounding stopped.

The person leaned close to the camera, it was me. Same uniform, same tired expression, same scar on my chin. “I’ve been here too long,” he said through the speakers. “Please, just open it.”

My hands shook as I typed the timestamp into the log.

“Good,” my supervisor said. “You’re learning.”

At 2:12 a.m., someone knocked on the lobby door, three slow taps. I didn’t turn around, the knocking came again.

“Security?” a woman’s voice called. “They said you’d help.”

I stayed still, her voice dropped to a whisper. “I can hear you breathing.”

The cameras flickered. For half a second, every screen showed the same image: the lobby, empty, except for my chair. Facing the desk, no one sitting in it. I stood up so fast the chair clattered to the floor, the screens snapped back to normal. My supervisor appeared again, smiling wider than before.

“You’ve reached the end of your shift,” he said. “Congratulations.”

“What is this place?” I asked.

“A holding company,” he replied. “We secure what can’t leave yet.” The door unlocked behind me. When I stepped outside, the building was gone. Just an empty lot, chain-link fence, overgrown weeds. 

My phone buzzed with a final email: “Thank you for your service. Your replacement has arrived.” Attached was a photo from Camera 1. The lobby desk, the chair, and someone sitting in it. Watching the monitors, wearing my uniform, looking very tired. I never went back.

But sometimes, late at night, when I close my eyes, I swear I hear footsteps behind me, slow, careful, waiting for me to turn around.
