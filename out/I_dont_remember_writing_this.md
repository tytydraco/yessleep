I feel like I’m going crazy. I can’t explain it all too well, because I can’t understand it. It’s like there's a switch in my brain and I don't know what the activation is. Almost like there are two of me, opposites, and I am aware of it the whole time. One calls for the chaos of instability, the other, the serenity of mediocrity. 
My bloodlust screams, I can hear it all the time. Some days it's just louder than others. I hold a blade at work, I just need to open a bag, yet I am transfixed to the sharp metal. My body gets light as I drift away into the darkness. My grip tightens, fingertips caress the handle. One finger makes its way to the blade. The razor edge catched the creases of my skin. 
‘Oh what I could do, so sharp.’
A gust of wind blows into my barn. The below freezing sharp air makes me recoil from the sharp edge. 
I am self aware. Why was I thinking like that, wait, what was I actually thinking? I cut the bag open. That split second of questioning desoloves. My skin crawls with ecstasy with the smoothness of the cut across the plastic. 
‘What could this do to the skin?’
A plume of shavings and dust puffs in my eyes. A frustrating anger of itchy eyes replaced my bloodlust. My own pain is not the kind of pain I wanted. 
“What was I thinking?” I ask again. I knew I was imaging an arty use of the human body. Trying to guess what the heat of inners smelt like. All the different kinds of screams different kinds of pain could make. Focus, make a clear picture in your head. I want the picture that made my body crawl with need. Need what? Why can’t I remember that thought, why do I want to feel that again? What was I feeling?

Where is he? Who is he, that I am asking for. I think it’s the love of my life. My husband, maybe a father. I think of him every day, every second of those days. He’s funny, and can make everything into a good joke. It’s not like hes even trying, he just brings me joy. I see his face, I can’t help but smile. The man I’ve woken up to for years. He has taken care of me and held my hand such a long distance. Pushing me further, past my limits into the watery unknown of life. I can’t swim that far out. 
The effortless knowledge his mind can spit. Chemistry, history, guns, war, cars, science, technology. I can hear it all from him. How does he know anything in this amount? I’ve known him about half my life now, where did he find all these facts? I learn something new, beautiful and useful everytime we have a conversation. My heart swells with love just as my mind swells with knowledge. I take a deep breath as my attraction builds. He is so excited to tell me all about the things he loves, to the one he loves. I don’t really care for what he shares, we don’t like the same things. But look how much he loves me, to share every bit of his beautiful world. 

He’s mad at me. Did I deserve to hurt him? I did hurt him, my poor sweet love just wanted to apologize for what he did to upset me. 
‘But he hurt you.’ 
You know you pms hard. You didn’t need to use pain to communicate. My hormones can’t be an excuse. What happened? He was trying to push me into the watery unknown. I have grown so dependent on my hand holding lover. I can't do this on my own.
‘See, he’s hurting you?’
No I am not suffering, I am growing. Growing pain is all I am feeling. To be human is to never stop. 

It's morning. I barely remember writing this. I was high and angry. I thought drugs would numb the pain. But I feel this. How come I could write this down yesterday, and never another time before that? Am I losing that much of myself that I need to preserve my last few thoughts in words? I wish I could guarantee my sanity and safety. But those words scare me. This is in my head and now I can see it. Why is my joy being consumed by the distasteful urges of a monster? I am not a monster, just trying to learn a way around life. Being angry and distracted doesn't make me a monster. But the things that distract me. Beautiful. I can't help but see it. The red, the heat, the taste. It isn't right. I need help.
