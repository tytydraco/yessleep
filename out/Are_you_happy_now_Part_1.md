It all started about a month ago in the small town where I lived.
I was stuck in a dead-end job, the kind where you just count the hours until you can go home, only to sit in silence and wait for work again. No love for it, no passion. I was there for one reason: I needed the money.

One day a coworker asked if I watched the game last night. I ignored him. They don’t pay me to talk to him, and honestly, he’s one of the reasons I hated that place.

Not like I even knew what I was doing there. I showed up at a certain time, pressed buttons they told me to press, and left when they said to leave. I’d have rather churned water. At least then I’d feel less numb.

That day I decided something. I wanted to be free.

The next morning I went to my boss and told him I was done.
He smiled and said, “It won’t be that easy.”
I told him the contract was over and walked out.

For the first time in years, I felt good. I felt like I was in control of something.
But I wasn’t stupid. I knew I’d need money. And the look on his face told me he wasn’t done with me yet.

That night I went to sleep hoping I’d figure it all out later.

Then came the call.

The ringtone wasn’t mine. The number was symbols, like it wasn’t even a real number.
I picked up. No idea why. I just did.

Screaming.
Not human screaming.
It made my skin crawl and my hands shake.

“Who is this?” I yelled.
A voice answered.
“Join us.”
I hung up, heart racing. Probably a prank. Maybe the boss. Maybe that idiot coworker.

The next morning I checked my call history. Nothing.
No missed call. No number. Nothing.

I tried to brush it off. Couldn’t focus the whole day. I clipped a few job listings from the paper and called it a night.

That night the phone rang again.

Louder this time.
The sound didn’t fill the room. It felt like it poured straight into my ears.

I answered.
The screams came back.
I covered my ears, begged them to stop.

Then silence.
Then a whisper.
“Help… help…”
Then a scream worse than the last.

I shouted, “What do you want from me?”
The voice said, “Join us.”

I panicked.
Fight or flight.
I threw the phone to the floor. It shattered into pieces.

I woke up late. The phone was my alarm, and now it was dead.

As I got out of bed, I heard a voice outside.
Faint, but real. “Help… help…”
I looked out the window. Nothing.

I ran toward the voice. Thought maybe I could help. Maybe there was money in it.
But the closer I got, the quieter it became. Like it was drifting away.

I blinked and suddenly I was back in bed.

Same clothes. Same shoes.
This wasn’t a dream.

Then I heard it again.
At first just noise.
Then clear.

“Join us.”

And I did.
Because what else was there.

The next morning, the trees swayed softly in the wind.

I took a step toward the edge of my building's roof.
“This is it,” I thought.

One more step. Then another. I knew the next one would be the last.

I jumped, headfirst, wanting it to end fast.
But then came the disappointment.

My head hit the ground and I was still here.

Paralyzed.
Shattered.
Pain I can’t even describe.
Most people would scream.

Not me.
I felt peace.
Like when you finally shut your eyes after a long day.

The blood poured out and the peace grew stronger.

Some people tried calling for help.
Idiots.
I chose this.

I tried to tell them to grab a rock and finish it but I could barely make a sound.

Everything went dim.
My mind faded.
The helplessness melted away.
And the peace took over completely.

Some people probably didn’t like seeing me die with a wide grin.

Right before it all went black, I let out a soft laugh. I couldn’t help it.

And that’s how I got here.
Are you happy now?
