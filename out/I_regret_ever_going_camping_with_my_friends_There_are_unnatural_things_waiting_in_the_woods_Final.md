The guy narrowed his eyes doubtful of Arlin's words but kept talking.

“There was an outbreak in a different forest a bit of a distance from here. We’re still studying it. We think something infected the local plants and then gets passed onto the animals.”

I glanced down at his swipe card again trying to see if there was a company name. I only saw his initials printed on the bottom of the card.

“Tell us J.C., can this infection pass to humans?” I said and nodded toward the two bodies we just put down.

His face turned pale and he frowned with a slight shake of his head.

“Yes. Eating a tainted plant, or an infected animal can pass it along. Or well... an infected human can infect you too.”

My head started to spin. I nearly fainted at the news. Not only did my friends turn into monsters, but they had been trying to change us as well. I realized something and it nearly put me over the edge.

“Can you be infected by eating tainted mushrooms?” I asked, dread clear on my face.

“Are chicken of the woods mushrooms or fungus?” Arlin added mostly talking to himself.

“Uh, yeah. Did you two eat some?”

We both glanced at each other and nodded. J.C.’s shoulders dropped disappointed the two normal humans he’d come across may be ticking time bombs.

“We haven’t come across a lot of humans coming into contact with this infection. There is a small percentage of animals that don’t react to whatever is causing all of this. But... we have seen people turn after seven or eight hours after being exposed. The biggest sign of the infection is a personality change. Some people revert to a childlike state, and others become extremely violent.”

“If you’ve studied this, then they’re must be a cure...” I said almost too desperate to think clearly.

J.C. pointed towards the body of the previous ranger at our feet. The flesh was still twisted from some unnatural disease.

“You think there could ever be a cure for something like that?” He explained.

My knees gave out and I slid down the wall. With some quick math, I assumed that I only had until sunrise. Then I would become like my friends. My body changed in gruesome ways and my mind gone.

“The only way to deal with this is fire. It seems like whatever carries this mutation is extremely flammable.” J.C added with a shrug not over concerned over our fates, or he was hiding it very well.

“Why wasn’t the park closed?” I replied. I wanted to sound angry but I was just so tired.

“I wasn’t certain whether this forest had been overtaken or not. And no one wanted to spare the manpower to double-check. Our hands are full because of the other location. I hired a private security worker to come along to confirm what I suspected.”

“Then you got spooked in the woods, ran off, and got separated from them?” Arlin suggested.

Despite the horrible news, he hadn’t dropped his smile. He only appeared a little tired but not on the verge of a mental breakdown like myself.

J.C.’s face turned red showing that was what really went down. Hell, I didn’t blame him. At least he found his way to the cabin alone instead of relying on a stranger for help.

“I’m meeting Cassidy here. We’ll protect you and get you out of the woods. There is a very, very slim chance either of you aren’t infected.” J.C. suggested recovering from his embarrassment.

“And if we are?” I asked barely able to keep my head up.

He didn’t answer. I knew why. We would either be killed on the spot, or taken away to be experimented on.

“We never should have come here.” My voice sounded as bitter as I felt.

“Since we might be carrying this infection, can you at least tell us where it came from?” Arlin asked, his voice calm.

I knew he was trying to keep the conversation going to distract me from my misery. J.C. frowned uncomfortable with the request. He had been told to not disclose that information but he felt like we were owed it. He pointed upwards as a small hint. I didn’t understand what he was implying.

“It’s a biblical event?” My new friend asked innocently.

J.C face flushed red and he jabbed his finger upwards a few more times.

“I’m gesturing towards the night sky!” He huffed.

I forgot about everything for a second as the implication hit me like a ton of bricks. We were dealing with something that came from space? Like some sort of alien disease? Was that even possible? I didn’t have time to dwell on it.

I had been too stressed out to be thinking clearly. I had completely forgotten what I had asked Matt to do the last time I saw him. He was supposed to come to the ranger’s cabin. His body wasn’t here when we arrived. That meant he should be out there in the forest. I was unaware he had been finding his way where the entire time.

Arlin’s body tensed. I quickly stood up causing J.C. to look at us confused. I was closer to the door and made it outside first. Countless streaks of light flew across the night sky. The sight should be beautiful but it chilled me to the bone. Someone was waiting outside for us just at the edge of the clearing to the cabin.

Matt’s clothing was stained with fresh blood. He lifted a heavy object and tossed it closer to us. A severed head of a large buck landed hard. The dark eyes still opened and the mouth moved slightly.

I was scared to see what he become, but I also felt so tired.

“Why are you here? I thought you were heading to the car.” Matt said sounding almost normal.

His voice had a distant sound to it. This figure looked and sounded like my friend but the features were just off enough for me to know he was too far gone.

“I got sidetracked.” I admitted.

So far, he hadn’t acknowledged the two other people.

“I did what I was told. I came here. I took care of the deer that bothered Eddie. They all asked me not to. All of them are my friends and they want me to join them, but you guys were my friends first.” He explained, his eyes looking forward and yet past me at the same time.

“Where’s the girls?” I asked him with foolish hope for a good answer.

“Sofie is at Big Bear Tree. I can’t hear Jessy anymore. Or Ben.” Matt’s eyes trailed off to the woods as if he expected our friends to be close by.

J.C. said he came with someone. I considered they had come across Ben and Jessy and silenced them. If that was the case, then it meant that Eddie wasn’t dead even after getting hacked apart. The world started to spin as I thought of him not only transforming against his will but lying injured and alone somewhere. Death would be better.

“They want me to take you all with me. There are so many voices telling me what to do.” Matt said, his head turning back to face us.

An odd cold rage bubbled under the surface. His flesh rippled along his cheeks but he didn’t act just yet.

“I’m sick of it. I was jealous of you, you know that? You don’t have parents ordering you around. You don't have siblings. You’re alone. No voices are bothering you.”

I found myself taking a few steps back. I knew Matt worked hard to support his large family. But I was never aware of how that affected him.

“Hey, let’s trade places. Let me crawl into your skin and be you for a little while.”

Matt's expression changed into a deranged smile. Arlin knew Matt was serious about the idea. He darted towards him, axe in hand ready to fight.

Yet again, I was too scared to act. Or rather, I couldn’t bring myself to move. Deep down I felt like I should die in those woods. Arlin didn’t agree.

A batch of flesh tendrils burst out from Matt’s back. I grabbed J.C. and pulled him out of the way. The unnatural appendage crashed into the window that had been behind him, the shards of glass slicing into the flesh causing it to recoil in pain. Most of the tendrils went for Arlin seeing him as the biggest threat.

One wrapped around the handle of the axe. He held onto it with both hands and dug into the ground with his feet trying to stay in one spot. He was painfully dragged along refusing to give up his weapon. With a massive pull, he brought Matt closer then suddenly let go of the axe. He moved too fast for his opponent to react. With one swift movement, he pulled out a small object from his pocket and grabbed a hold of one side of Matt’s head to keep it steady as he stabbed a pen deep into the creature’s right ear.

He screamed in pain, the tendrils wildly flailing around. He wobbled on his feet trying to recover. Arlin didn’t give him the chance. The metal axe had been dropped out of arms reach but that didn’t matter to him. He grabbed Matt’s shirt and tossed him to the ground. Matt reached and ripped the pen from his ear but it was too late. Arlin took hold of his skull with both hands lifting his head above the buck’s antlers. There was a struggle as Matt used all his strength to keep his head raised. Arlin his weight to slowly force down Matt’s body. Both of them shook with effort and sweat dripped from Arlin's face.

Slowly he won the silent fight and lowered Matt’s neck onto the tip of an antler. Blood bubbled from his mouth as the rest of his body fell limp and his eyes rolled back.

When I grabbed J.C out of the way I hadn’t let him go. I felt him grab a hold of my arm, fear overtaking him and he wasn’t ashamed to hold a stranger for support.

Matt’s face started to transform. The fleshy flowers spouted covering his eyes and his chest moved as if countless insects were moving under the skin. He was going to become some sort of monster we couldn’t deal with in a few seconds. Arlin didn’t give him that chance.

He briskly walked over to the fallen axe. He moved without any wasted actions. He brought down the blade splitting Matt’s skull in half. With some effort, he removed the weapon to bring it down again and again in a robotic way.

I was terrified at the moment. Not of what my friend had turned into, but of what kind of person Arlin was. I didn’t know the first thing about him. J.C. had said people who were infected had a change in their personality. Arlin was brutally efficient when it came to attacking the creatures we came across. Deep down I knew he hadn’t changed because of the infection. He had always been this kind of person.

The world around me started to fade. I wasn’t aware that I was on the verge of fainting. J.C. needed to drag us back into the cabin as I heard the sound of the axe coming down again and again. Mentally I simply shut down. With some effort, J.C. sat me against a wall to let me rest for a few minutes.

When I opened my eyes, everything was quiet outside. J.C. was rummaging around looking for anything useful inside the cabin. He found a few cans of spam he put aside. The thought of food made my stomach twist. I curled up, back pressed against the wall and knees tucked hard against my chest.

Footsteps came closer and I almost hoped it was another monster coming inside the cabin. Instead, Arlin slowly sat down near me. His clothing was drenched in sticky blood but he had at least cleaned off his face. I pressed my back even harder against the wall now afraid of the person who had been protecting me the entire night.

“I should have been me....” I said mostly to myself.

Arlin gave me a gentle questioning look that made me a little bit less scared of him. I couldn’t bring myself to admit to him I wished I died in the accident that killed my parents. If I wasn’t around then maybe my friends would have lived. I shook my head saying something else that had bothered me all night.

“I’m a guy. I should have been the one to end their suffering. Not you. I just stood there like a child every time...” I admitted hating myself for my actions that night.

“How old are you?” He asked.

“Twenty.” I lied. He knew and waited for the right answer. “Nineteen.”

“See? Still a teenager. I’m the adult here so I don’t mind helping.”

I lashed out and punched his arm. It didn’t do any damage but he pretended it did.

“What’s the point of being born a guy if I was too weak to do anything?!” I snapped.

I’ve always been the smallest and weakest of the guys in our friend group. None of them really teased me about it. The issue had always been at the back of my mind and now I found out how useless I really was.

Arlin reached over and took ahold of my hand. I was confused and let him place his next to mine to show off the size difference.

“People are born different. Some are good at running, while others have asthma. Just because you can run faster and longer doesn’t make you better than anyone who can’t. You have different skills. Who cares if fighting isn’t one of them?”

I chewed on the inside of my cheek letting the words turn around in my head. I knew he was just humoring me and trying to make me feel better and oddly enough it worked a little.

“I still should have...” I started but lost the strength to finish the thought.

“I've dealt with monsters before. It’s something I’m made for.”

I raised my head and studied him for a minute. I wished I understood more about him. Was he here on purpose or by chance? I surely couldn’t be so lucky as to meet the one person prepared enough to deal with this kind of situation and was kind enough to help.

The cabin door slammed open causing all of us to jump. J.C. let out a high-pitched scream which we decided to ignore. A massively tall person decked out in military gear stepped through the door, a large blade in their gloved hand. They reached up and removed the helmet and mask covering their face letting waves of long red hair spill out.

“Do you have a hair tie?” She asked directing her freckled face in our direction.

Arlin and I were too stunned to reply.

“Cassidy!” J.C. said and rushed over to her.

She was at least two feet taller than him. He found her a regular elastic so she could put up her hair.

“Isn't long hair against some sort of regulation?” Arlin commented after he recovered.

“I’m in the private sector. Come on.” She turned ready to leave.

We stood up and headed towards the door. For once things were slightly looking up. I doubted we would have any issues getting through the woods with a tank like her on our side. She looked as if she could take down a charging bull if she wanted, and yet had a soft kinder face that didn’t match her cold tone.

I considered the slight chance I wasn’t carrying the infection. That when the sunrose I would be alive to carry the weight of this night.

Our group started walking down the trail toward the end of the woods. My hand went into my pocket to feel the items tucked away inside. I started to close my pace until I stopped. Arlin noticed first, then the other two.

“I’m with you until the end.” Arlin said already knowing what I was going to say.

J.C. appeared confused but somehow Cassidy knew what the look on my face meant.

“We’re not going back.” She stated.

“I need to see Sofie.” I said and J.C opened his mouth to protest.

“Just leave her! There is no way she’s still human!” He pointed out.

I knew that. Hoping that she was alright wasn’t the reason why I needed to go back to find her. I shook my head and he took a step away from Cassidy. She grabbed J.C.’s shoulder keeping hm in place.

“My job is to protect you. Not them. We’re leaving.”

He looked between her and us knowing he was unable to do anything to help.

“We’ll wait for you at the end of the trail.”

It felt like I smiled for the first time that night. We said a few quick parting words and turned to walk deeper into the woods.

We didn’t see any more infected animals along the way. The sky had gotten a little bit lighter. It made it easier to see. The forest didn’t appear right. The plants were still but out of the corners of my eyes, I could see the leaves and blades of grass turn towards us as if the entire forest was watching our backs. I wondered just how far the infection spread.

The night had taken a toll on Arlin. He kept a tight grip on the axe handle but he let it dangle at his side. His smile was strained and he let me walk in front. I followed the trail knowing it would lead to the path that branched out to the large tree in the center of the forest.

We found the clearing and he waited at the edge. I needed to do this alone.

The tree is larger due to the new growth. The flesh-like flowers sprouted from the branches replacing its leaves. Countless bodies of all kinds of animals had been pressed and twisted into each other around the tree giving it a new shape. A raccoon came from the woods with flowers spouting from its head. It didn’t look over at us and kept walking. The tree accepted it into itself in a silent fusion of flesh.

What was left of Sofie was in the middle of the tree facing us. Her eyes had been covered by the flowers and her lower body fused into the tree. Her long hair flowed down moving in the slight breeze. I should have been afraid of her, but I thought she looked oddly beautiful. A light came falling from between the branches. It appeared to be a blue ball of flame that seeped into the ground when it landed. J.C. had been telling the truth of this infection coming from the sky. How many other places have been taken over so far? Had it only been this forest and one other?

“I was starting to wonder where you were.” Sofie spoke sounding a bit tired. “Come over here and join us.” She opened her arms wide in a tempting offer.

“In a second. I want to talk first.”

She nodded her head but didn’t lower her arms.

“How did you all feel about me? I mean... do you blame me? Were we all actually friends?”

She moved her head from side to side considering the question. Normally she wouldn’t answer such questions but she was no longer herself.

“We were friends. We all loved you. Relationships aren’t perfect. We were only human. I suppose near the end I was starting to get jealous of you. All your hard work paid off. I grinded away at my social media accounts for nothing. Meanwhile, you had no support. You got back on your feet after your parents' death and you were going to college, unlike the rest of us. It felt like I was losing you...”

I never knew any of this. I wished I paid more attention or even talked with them all more. I should have valued our time together instead of rushing to get to the next stage of my life.

“I don’t blame you for all of this. None of us do. We’re happy like this. No longer being human. No longer alone. It hurt at first. But now after we shed who we were, we can live in bliss with all the other voices. Now, come and join us. Let us spread to the rest of this world and become one with everything.”

I moved towards her wanting nothing more than to take her up on the offer. Arlin made an effort to stop me but he was blocked by a pair of infused deer. He hacked away at them yelling my name and telling me to stop. I kept walking until I reached Sofie letting her arms wrap around me. Her cheek pressed against my own in an embrace I never knew I wanted from her.

“I always thought of you all as siblings. You were the best family anyone could have ever asked for.” I said and pulled away from her a little.

She didn’t understand why I bothered telling her something like that. After all, once we fused, she would know everything about me. She wasn’t aware of my hand reaching into my pocket to pull out a small object. I lifted it under her exposed stomach and stared at her face trying to find the traces of the human she had been. I didn’t think that this was the right choice. It just felt like something I needed to do.

My thumb flicked at the lighter twice, and Arlin screamed at me to stop. Within a second of the small flame coming to life, it spread to Sofie’s body. She let out an ungodly scream and pulled away unable to stop the fire from rapidly spreading. Her body went up like paper soaked in gasoline. The flames spread to my clothing and heat forced my eyes shut. I’ve never felt such pain before. The only thing I was aware of was the unbearable heat and the screams coming from the transformed tree.

A strong hand pulled me away and forced my body to the ground. Arlin frantically put out the flames with his hands. His body is over top of mine. I opened my eyes to see a new expression on his face. He was furious.

“Leave-” I started to tell him.

To my shock, he slapped my cheek. Not hard but enough to derail my train of thought.

“Don’t you dare take the easy way out now!” He snapped with such force it knocked some sense into me.

I blankly stared at him never expecting such an outburst. The fire had already spread through the tree causing it to scream. Smoke rolled along the ground making our eyes water. With some difficulty we both stood up, coughing and moving our exhausted legs forward.

The fire was moving faster than us. Each infected plant and tree let out a high-pitched noise when the flames touched them. The sound of the flames was drowned out by a sea of screams.

My legs faltered and Arlin stopped long enough to lift me on his back. We weren’t going to make it out of the woods on foot. I closed my eyes only regretting letting him close along with me.

A new noise came ripping through the woods. J.C. shouted our names and Cassidy scooped us up onto the back of an ATV. She wasted no time sheering it back down the trail kicking up dust and moving faster than the flames. I think they were trying to keep me awake. I tried to keep my eyes open but they drifted shut. I passed out not seeing the sunrise that night.

I woke up in a cold white room. At first, I thought I was dead, but then the dull pain all over my body reminded me I was still alive. My arms, chest, and right side of my face had treated burns. The room didn’t have windows so I could only guess how many days I stayed there recovering. The nurses who came in and out for treatments didn’t say a word to me.

Finally, J.C. entered the room. The dark bags under his eyes revealed how stressed he had been while I rested. He set a change of clothing on the side of the bed. He then placed a clear bag with my repaired cell phone and Eddie’s lighter next to me.

“You’re in the clear. No signs of the infection. We tested your blood about a hundred times to make sure.” He announced.

At least that was some good news.

“And Arlin?” I asked.

“He’s fine too. He wasn’t as injured as you were, so we already released him. I added his and my number to your phone.”

J.C sat down next to me and then leaned in closer as if he wanted to gossip,

“How long have you been friends with him? I mean, what do know about him?” He half whispered.

“I met him that night. Did you find out anything?” I half whispered back playing along.

“I looked him up. Arlin’s father was like, a Texas oil tycoon or something. And his mother was the mistress. She died of an overdose when he was sixteen. But you want to know the weird part?”

I felt wrong listening to all of this. It was as if I was invading Arlin’s privacy after all he did for me. But then again, this may all be public knowledge.

“His father’s wife died in a boating accident. Then his father died of a heart attack. He had a half-brother and a sister that the company and all the money should have gone to. His half-brother was shot by some cartel in Mexico and his younger sister drowned when she was thirteen. Some think she did it on purpose. Because of all of that, he has more money than he could spend in a lifetime. What are the chances his entire family dies in random ways years apart? And what was he doing in those woods? I asked him and he said he was foraging.”

After hearing all that I understood his reaction when I asked him to leave me behind. He must have had regrets for being unable to at the very least protect his little sister. Was that the reason why he protected me? Did he want to make up for not being there for her?

“Do you think he’s more deeply connected to the infection?” I said also wondering if it was possible.

“Maybe. But I haven’t found any signs of it. I hated to admit this, but my company had been keeping samples of the infected instead of destroying all traces of it. There is money to be made if they’re able to turn people into weapons.”

He let out a sigh and leaned back unable to hide his distaste over the idea.

“You might think I'm crazy but I don’t think he’s working for anyone. I’m pretty sure he was in the forest by chance and he’s... just weird.” I admitted.

J.C. gave me a side eye but didn't argue. There was enough evidence for either option to be true.

“Now what? Are you going to threaten to kill me if I tell anyone what happened?” I suggested.

He waved off my words and shook his head.

“Nope. Fuck this company. I want you to tell any many people as you can about this and get the word out. The issue is we don’t know how many places are infected until humans get involved. There could but hundreds of places or none. I would rather us be the ones tracking these places down instead of random campers like your group stumbling into it. Even if you reach one person and convince them not to go into the woods, I think it would have been worth paying Cassidy to go back and get you two.”

I wanted to hug him, which was weird because I’m not normally a touchy person. I had considered it would be better if I died years ago. And now I had a chance to make my life mean something. J.C. didn’t understand how important his words were to me.

We finished up our conversation and he said I could leave whenever I felt ready.

To be honest, I don't know how widespread this mysterious infection is. I pray that the company J.C. works for is able to defeat it before others get hurt.

I’ve sent messages to Arlin thanking him for the help. He’s a bit busy out of the country looking for truffles of all things and promised to hang out with me when he gets back. Rich people are pretty weird if you ask me.

I don’t have the resources Arlin and J.C. do. I can’t do much to help save people or stop this threat on my own. The only thing I can do is warn people there may be unknown things lurking in the woods waiting for people to find it. I was lucky I left those woods alive.

So do me a favor, and skip the camping trips this year. Maybe go to the beach instead.
