I was nameless, and devoted to her. 

Ten of us had surrendered. 

Ten of us were *dead*, and I was losing my mind inside the girl’s bathroom. 

Wendy's screeching laughter from the hallway cut off suddenly. 

*Eleven*.  

BANG. 

**Disturbing Behaviour. 1998.**

Mirror scene. 

I didn't have a name, or any semblance of who I was. 

But I did have that. 

Slamming my head into the mirror, I was aware of crimson pooling in sharp rivulets down my temple. I could taste it in my mouth, dripping down my chin. 

Blood. 

It felt good. It felt real. It was the only thing keeping me anchored. 

*I loved Bee,* my thoughts were wild and disjointed. 

I *loved* Bee so much it hurt. 

I loved her. 

I wanted to give myself to her, to be with her forever. 

Forever. 

Forever. 

ForEVER.

My own mental voice was a hysterical cry I couldn't control, drowning all logical thought. 

*I loved her. I loved her. I loved her. I loved her. I loved her. I loved her. I loved her. I loved her. I loved her. I loved her. I loved her. I loved her–*

**BANG.**

The force of my head hitting broken shards of glass should have killed me. 

The impact was painful, but I barely felt it. 

*I loved her. I loved her. I loved her, I LOVED HER–*

BANG.

My undying love for our Queen Bee was not real. 

After violently hitting my head into the cool porcelain of a toilet seat, and then the girls bathroom mirror, I was slowly starting to regain my thoughts. 

They came slowly, but my name was still a giant question mark. 

I was a junior. Seventeen years old.

My brain told me I was a no-name, that I only existed for Bee. 

And for a while, I believed it. 

I believed it so much that I  sheared half of my hair from my scalp. 

I marked my arms with her name, carving her into every patch of my flesh. 

I caught myself with a pair of scissors, about to slice into my neck for Bee.

I wanted to make myself *match* with her. After all, I had in the past.

When Bee wore an all pink mini dress, so did I. She called me a copycat and burned the dress in front of me but I was just happy to be in her presence.

This, however, was different. I could feel it, like a parasite clawing into the meat of my brain, an obsession, an infatuation that made me want to rip my skin from my bones and gift it to Bee. 

I wanted to claw out my hair so I was more ordinary looking than her, pluck out my eyes so she was more perfect. 

Beatrice Day *was* the most popular girl in our class. 

Sitting on top of the hierarchical pyramid at an elite academy, Bee was high school royalty. Blackthorn Academy is not a school you can find with a Google search. 

You don't find Blackthorn. It finds *you*. Located on the edge of a coastal town and in the middle of nowhere, our school was cut off from the outside world. 

Beatrice Day was an heiress, her family only known to our town. 

The Day’s were the kind of *rich* that let them bleed into obscurity. 

With hair made of liquid gold, sculpted like a porcelain doll, Beatrice Day was the embodiment of perfection. She was the girl all of us looked up to, influencing our hair, clothes, even our personality. 

Sure, I followed her around like a lapdog. I was her right hand. 

But I had never felt like *this* for Bee. 

Just her name sent shivers down my spine, my skin prickling. 

I felt like my body wasn't my own, invisible hands wrapped around my neck, yanking me towards my Queen. 

Blinking rapidly, I shook my head. 

I needed to get away from it, away from the burning infatuation that had killed the others. 

After watching the other girls rip each other apart to be the one in our Queen's presence, to be her right hand, I found solace in the bathroom. In the corner of my eye, pooling scarlet seeped across marble tiles, stretching under the door. 

Cassie was behind it. 

She ripped out her heart for Bee, her lips settled in an eerie smile, eyes still open. All of the other girls had surrendered to our Queen Bee. 

They gave their lives for her. 

But my love felt wrong. 

How could I love someone when it was manufactured? 

When it was like a virus rather than true feeling? 

Facing the mirror, I prodded at my face. I was bleeding, and my blood was real.

When I dug my nails into my skin, I *felt* real. 

So, why did everything else feel fake? 

*Why did I… feel like this?*

Like my heart was going to explode, like being away from her was  agonising. 

My love for Bee wasn't natural. 

Like any other high school mean girl, Beatrice was just a teenage girl. She may have had influence and power, but we were still seventeen years old. She couldn't *make* me love her. With that thought in my head, I forced my head into the mirror. Again. And again. 

Until my nose burst and I could taste rusty change on my tongue. 

The world was spinning, the girls bathroom looked and felt like a carousel ride spinning round and around, and this time I felt the slightest relief. 

I was *right*. 

Peering at myself through jagged shards, my lips stretched into a maniacal giggle. Nothing felt real anymore. I didn't even *look* real. 

My dark hair hung in filthy rat tails glued to my forehead with sweat. My uniform was stuck to my flesh, unwashed, after days of… *Bee.* 

There were no days of the week and no dates. 

There was just Bee. 

*She* was like a virus, contorting my body into her puppet, her servant.

*She* was in my head, burying deeper and deeper into me. *She* was part of my blood, ingrained into my bones and entangled around my heart. I choked out a cry when that sensation strangled me again, an insatiable urge to go to her. 

My body had a mind of its own, staggering back, only for me to force it forwards. 

BANG. 

Into the mirror again. 

And somehow, I was okay. 

Whatever wounds I got were healed, or were still healing. 

I was healing, while the others were dying. 

Impact was getting harder to feel, to register, when my head was spinning off of its axis, my vision blurring into one big confusing mess. 

I tried to find logic, a reason why I was there, why I was fighting off a love I didn't understand, a *love* that was nothing like first love, or a crush. It was agonising. It made me want to rip myself apart. 

To kneel in front of my Queen Bee, and give her the rest of me. 

Just like the others. 

Emily, who severed her own head for Bee. 

Mari, who ripped out her guts and painted the floor for our Queen to walk on.

BANG. 

There was something *there*, I thought manically, at the exact same time as I noticed one of the stalls. 

Bee wasn't just inside my head. She was there physically, ingrained into my flesh. 

In slow staggered steps, I studied the walls, pressing my fingers into pale blue marble. It *was* the same stall. 

But it also wasn't. 

The walls were the exact color, and yet somehow, they still looked different. 

Maybe I was going crazy, or maybe it was a concussion from the multiple head smashes, but the more I stared at this particular stall’s walls, I knew I wasn't inside Blackthorn Academy’s girls bathroom. 

Because, on the third stall from the left, there should have been a crack in the door. 

Elizabeth Marie kicked it so hard she broke her foot.

Dropping to my knees, the walls in front of me didn't make sense. 

Stall 3 had become infamous for graffiti. 

Especially one message written in bright red marker. 

*Eat shit and die, JC <3*

So, where was it?

Slamming my fists into the walls, I searched for my own message. 

*JC should do the world a favor and die :)*

I strictly remembered writing that with Bee standing behind me laughing. 

She told me what to do, and I obeyed.

But not like this. 

Backing out of the stall, I went back to the mirror. 

This time, I grasped a broken shard, clenching it between my fists.

Now I knew for sure. 

Beatrice Day was inside my head, and whatever she had done to me, I had to get it out. 

Bee did want to be worshipped, sitting on her throne at the back of the class. 

But this was too far– even for a rich girl with connections. This was psychotic. 

I was barely aware of the glass shard cutting into my skin. 

I dragged it down my temple, then my cheek, using my fingers to pry open scarlet flaps of flesh. 

Whatever that bitch did to me, I was going to find it. 

*I had to cut her OUT OF MY HEAD*. 

Get it out. 

Get HER OUT. 

When my slimy fingers hit *something* tangled between layers of skin, I pinched it in an attempt to pull her out. Something lit up, an unnatural streak of light, in my eye. I started to laugh, more in relief. I was right. 

Bee had implanted herself inside my mind to ensure full compliance. 

When I tried to yank her out, something inside my mind contorted, tightening its grip. 

My hands dropped to my sides, my body going rigid. 

Bee took control, slipping effortlessly into me. 

She jerked my head up, forged my lips into a wide grin that stretched so wide, my lips began to crack, to split apart. 

With my body on autopilot, I left the girls bathroom. 

Cassie’s body was in the way, so I forced the door into her, knocking the girl sprawling. 

When I stepped onto the hallway, I knew this place was not Blackthorn Academy. 

Instead, it was a mockery, a copycat building. 

Bee dragged me forwards, stumbling on top of the bodies of other girls, other followers, until I came to an abrupt stop in front of Beatrice Day herself. 

She was dead, bisected in half, still lying in halo hair. 

The other girls had taken parts of her. 

Amy took her eyes. 

Kiera severed Bee’s arms and lay with one pressed to her cheek. 

Our Queen was unrecognisable, and yet in my head, she was still beautiful. 

*Beatrice Day was dead*, I thought dizzily. 

So, how was she inside my head? 

While I was hiding inside the girl’s bathroom questioning my sanity, Bee was murdered. 

The rest of the girls tore her apart, stitching pieces of her onto themselves. 

They were not my tears that fell– they were *hers.*

She was making me cry for her. 

And now, she wanted me to worship her fucking corpse. 

When I dropped to my knees next to her, I felt pain that didn't make sense, just like the love that was driving me crazy. I couldn't hold it back anymore.

Bee had all of me, body, mind, and soul. In flickering light, I caught a knife still clenched between Mia Samual’s fingers.

I peeled Mina’s dead fingers from the knife handle, and it felt right in my hand. 

Slowly, I began to hack away at my arms, laughing at the thought of finally making myself one with our *Queen.* 

Bee had already copied herself into the other girl's heads.

Forced them to tear each other apart like animals. 

For *her*

Now she wanted me to do the same. 

No matter how hard I tried to drop the knife, I couldn't. 

*“How does it feel to be the final girl, Serena?”*

The sudden voice, the *adult* voice, snapped my thoughts to fruition. 

She wasn't Bee. 

Lifting my head, I searched for our Queen Bee. 

Beatrice Day was dead. 

I found my voice which was no longer fully mine. 

“It hurts.” I told the ceiling. 

If I squinted, I could make out a reflective surface projecting my reflection back at me. 

*Serena*. 

The name didn't feel real to me. It didn't match the girl in the camera. I was half bald, dried blood staining my forehead, my slightly manic eyes unblinking. 

Blackthorn Academy prided itself on its uniform. 

My school sweater was torn, hanging off my shoulder, my tie hanging in tattered shreds. 

The voice, a woman, hummed. “Can you tell me why you love Beatrice?”

Her question didn't make sense. 

I opened my mouth to speak, but she was cutting me off. 

“Tell me,” her voice was cool, “Why did you love Beatrice Day?”

My answer was simple. 

I had no fucking idea. 

I dropped the knife, and picked up a loose shard of glass, this phantom presence continuing to puppeteer me. 

This time, I stabbed the shard into my arm. 

“Stand up, Serena.”

I was forced to my feet, and this time it felt purposeful, my body more of a puppet, my hands clenching around the glass shard until warmth slid down my palm.

When a shriek escaped my mouth, I finally felt pain. 

I felt the agony in my head, my face, my whole body aching, my legs threatening to give way. I swayed to the left and then the right, like my puppeteer was toying with me, teasing me. 

“It is a simple question. Why did you worship Beatrice Day?”

I was still squeezing the glass, still writhing in agony. 

*She* wouldn't let go of my head, severing my strings. 

“I don't know,” I managed to choke out. “Who are you?”

“Answer the question honestly and I will tell you.”

The answer popped into my head, tangling on my tongue. 

“Because she was popular,” I whispered. 

“But you hurt her,” the woman's tone hardened.

She wasn't someone I knew, so why were my hands starting to tremble? 

“Why would you hurt someone you love that much, Serena?”

The sharp sting of the blade was cutting further into my palm. I shook my head, my blood boiling. “But I didn't love her–” 

She cut me off. “What did Beatrice ever do to *you*?”

I squeezed my eyes shut, trying to peel my fingers from the shard. “Nothing.”

“Nothing,” the woman repeated in a scoff. “So, why did you hurt her?”

“I… don't know.” my voice came out in cry. 

“Did Beatrice *tell* you to hurt her, Serena?”

“No.”

A pause. 

“Do you know why you are here, Serena?”

With my free hand, I dazedly prodded at my temple, at the metallic plating under my skin. I felt my breath quicken. 

“What did you do to me?”

“I'm asking the questions,” she said. “Do you know *why* you are here?”

Her emphasis on *why* made me flinch. 

“No.” 

I was lying.

Until that second, I really did think I had been kidnapped by a psycho, or Beatrice Day was playing a sick game. 

But then the mystery woman's voice shattered, and I remembered why I wrote in the third stall. 

Jasper Cliffe was completely unordinary.

He read comic books on his phone and made Vine’s at lunchtime. 

He sat at the back of our class, and because he was quiet, because he sat on the bottom of the pyramid as a scholarship student, Beatrice Day made his life a misery. 

It started as a joke. 

Beatrice would call him names behind her hand. Jasper's father was rumoured to work at the power plant, which was apparently extremely funny in a room full of the elite’s children. Bee was subtle at first, though she never harassed him herself. It was always us. 

As my father’s daughter, I was to keep to Bee’s side, solidifying our family’s relationship with the Day’s. 

Dad said, if Bee told me to do something, I was to comply without complaint.

So, I became her right hand. 

Initially, it was just stupid shit. 

I kicked his chair. 

Threw his lunch in his face. 

Poured water over his head. 

Olivia stuffed Jasper’s bag down the toilet bowl. 

Mari scribbled GET OUT all over his desk. 

But then after curfew, Bee ordered us to take him from his room. I carried him, along with Mari and Simon and Noah, dragging Jasper Cliffe into the third bathroom stall inside the girls bathroom. I shoved him onto his knees, feverishly aware that Bee was watching. I remember she stood like a real queen, her arms folded, lips pursed.

She told me to write him a special message, so I did. I told him to go die. 

Our Queen Bee’s eyes narrowed. 

*Not enough*, the slight curve in her lip said. 

So, Olivia dunked his head in the toilet bowl. 

I thought she was going to drown him, so much so that I got scared. 

When Jasper was coughing and spluttering, sobbing into the toilet seat, Bee told me to laugh. I did. I laughed harder when Jasper stood up shakily, called us the c-word, and walked away. 

When he returned to class the next day, Bee told us to throw his mattress out of the window. 

His roommate joined in, insisting we throw his laptop too. 

The crazy thing is, he kept coming to school. 

And our Queen Bee was growing progressively more irritated. 

She sat on the edge of her desk, legs crossed, eyes narrowed in Jasper’s direction. Holding out a manicured hand, Bee quietly asked for a scrap of paper before spreading it out on my desk. Bee told me to tell him the truth. 

That he was a disgusting, dirty, scholarship leech. 

She *told* me to write down every word, and *told me* to laugh with the others. 

I did. 

Then I stuck it on his back, with enough force to knock him to his knees. 

Jasper *didn't* come to school after. 

Bee picked a new victim, and the cycle continued.

“I want you to… hurt,” the woman whispered, snapping me out of it. The shard was embedded in my skin now, slicing through layers. I could hear the venom dripping from her voice. “I want you to feel exactly like my son who you mercilessly bullied until he took his own life. I want you, Serena, to hurt.”

I could hear her breaking apart all over again. 

*“Does it *hurt?*” she asked. 

Squeezing tighter on the glass, I couldn't resist a shriek. 

I nodded, closing my eyes. 

I had so many excuses. 

Bee made me do it. 

I was peer pressured.

My dad insisted I did *everything* Bee asked of me. 

But I couldn't give her an excuse, because it *did* fucking hurt. 

“Are you sorry?” Jasper’s Mom pushed. “Are you sorry for hurting my son?”

Yes. 

I couldn't hear my voice, but my lips moved. 

“Say it.” she ordered. “Say it and mean it or I will make you claw out your own throat.”

I did say it, and I *did* mean it. 

There was no point in crying, or begging. 

*Sorry* was what she wanted. 

Just. 

I'm sorry. 

A sudden *bleep* sounded behind me, and I twisted around. 

A small glass door had slid open. 

I was frozen, waiting for her to kill me, to press the final amount of pressure to force the glass shard through an artery. 

Jasper’s mother didn't kill me, though I wish she did. 

When the suffocating control choking my thoughts faded and my hand was mine again, the shard slipped from my palm.

I dropped to my knees, my body exhausted, before springing to my feet. 

The door felt so far away.

Freedom. 

*“Goodbye, Serena.”*

Jasper’s mother didn't say anything else. 

She let me go. 

When I stepped through the door, I was standing in a long white hallway. 

The door next to me slowly opened, a green light illuminating the handle. 

Ben Calloway stumbled out. 

Covered in blood, Ben no longer resembled the class joker. 

His hair hung in filthy clumps sticking to his eyes. 

Eyes that didn't recognise me, lost in oblivion. 

Ben’s cheeks were hollow, malnourished. When he raised his hand, I thought he was going to wave. 

Instead, he clawed at his face– and I realized his fingers were not his own. 

Ben’s right eye was blue, while his left was green.

What was left of the academy uniform hung off of him in haggard strips. 

I could only make out a white shirt and half of a sweater clinging to him, the school tie wrapped around his head. 

Ben cocked his head slowly, regarding me like I was a space alien. There was a flicker of blue light in his eyes, before he blinked, and the light fizzled out. 

I should have been surprised Ben was the final boy. 

He was a main contributor to Jasper’s torment. 

However, Ben also happened to be the son of an extremely wealthy family. 

Our class joker used Jasper’s bullying to flirt with Bee. His smile used to be dimpled. 

Now, I was pretty sure he'd pulled out half of his teeth. 

I was looking at a different person, a boy whose eyes were somewhere else entirely, unblinking. 

He didn't speak, slowly turning around, and shuffling down the hallway.

After peeking through the door he came from, I was right. 

Jasper’s mother had split us into two groups. 

Boys in one room. 

Girls in the other. 

The grisly splatters of red was enough to drag my gaze from the room. 

I pretended not to see Simon and Noah. 

Simon, sliced into pieces. 

Noah, who died on his knees, as if in prayer. 

I wondered who the boy’s *King* was. 

The hallway felt like it went on forever. 

There was a door right at the end spilling late afternoon sunlight. 

Ben moved like a zombie towards it, head slightly tipped to the side. 

His shoes were caked in blood, leaving a string of entrails. 

Halfway toward the exit, I walked past a room with a low bleeping noise. 

Inside the room, his head opened up, eyes still open, was Jasper Cliffe.

He was somehow still breathing, still alive, despite his brain being visible under blue blue light. His hands were tied down, a plastic tube in his mouth. 

I didn't want to look closer, but part of me wanted to see *why* a grieving mother would lie about her son’s death. 

“Leave.” 

His mother spoke to the two of us. I looked up, and in front of me, Ben came to a stop. 

I heard the breath catch in his throat, and it was enough for me to turn and not look back. 

Walking outside into cool air, Ben and I were greeted by three teachers and a police officer. We were outside an old building. No press. No parents. I was just glad to be outside, revelling in a sharp breeze whipping my hair around. 

“The situation has been resolved,” the adults told us with forced smiles. 

Ben walked straight past them in a daze, and they had to gently drag him back. 

When I climbed into a limo, a stranger turned around with a smile. 

“A gas leak,” she told me. “There will be a cover up. Don't worry, this situation will not go beyond this car.”

She handed me a phone, and I shakily pressed it to my ear. 

*“Beatrice, darling, are you okay?”*

Dad’s voice was not a comfort. 

I tried to ignore his deep exhalation of disappointment when I told him it was *me*.

Leaning back in my seat, I gingerly prodded at my temple. “It's Serena.”

Daddy told me everything was going to be okay. 

And it was. 

For years, I've been able to bury what happened at Blackthorn. 

Over the last few weeks, I've been getting headaches. 

It's been years since that day, but these headaches feel familiar. 

Like something is knocking inside my head. 

My dad got me a job interview yesterday, and I was signing the contract when the pen slipped from my fingers. 

I meant to write my name, but instead, I wrote four lines. 

*I was a high school bully, and I am paying for it with my mind.*

*I was a high school bully, and I am paying for it with my mind.*

*I was a high school bully, and I am paying for it with my mind.*

*I was a high school bully, and I am paying for it with my mind.*

I thought it was a fluke, maybe PTSD. 

Yesterday, I did it again, this time carving the words into my legs.

Now it is every surface, and I can't stop myself. 

*I was a high school bully, and I am paying for it with my mind.*

I don't know what's happening to me. 

I'm losing time. I almost stepped into the path of a moving train this morning. 

My body swung forwards, like it *wanted* to collide with the train. 

These headaches aren't stopping, a constant dull throbbing in my right temple. 

I know I might be crazy, and I don't deserve sympathy. But please help me. 

I think Jasper Cliffe is inside my head. 

He's here.

Knocking on my skull. I think he wants to come out. 

*Can you hear him?*
