(Part 2 of 2)

It recoiled from the light and let out a growl. It was all I could do to keep from soiling myself. Without thinking I pointed my gun and fired. The sound was deafening. My ears instantly started ringing. The creature roared at me then turned and ran deeper into the cave.  
It had roared a mere few feet from me, yet I barely heard it. I stumbled and had to take a minute to steady myself. Then I started following it deeper into the cave. To this day I really don’t know why other than needing to know if the hiker was alive.  
I looked at the ground to see if there was any blood but there wasn’t. I must’ve just startled it with the shot. That wasn’t great news. I’d hoped I would’ve hit it and it was wounded. Just scared meant it would be ready to fight when I saw it again. After all, I’m sure to the creature I was the invader and it was defending its home.   
I continued farther into the cave, shining my light and watching for any sudden movement. I had no idea where it was or if it was setting a trap for me.  
I felt a whiff of air and jumped back a split second before the claws sliced the air where my face would’ve been.  
I rolled and came up shooting, holding my light beside the gun to illuminate my target. I fired over and over, pointing and shooting without having the time to aim. I watched as it ducked every shot and ran with inhuman speed. Just before it disappeared from sight, I saw it skip a step as I fired my last shot. My hopes soared that I had hit it at least once.   
I ejected the magazine and put a fresh one in, reminding myself that I only had one more and chastising myself for not being more careful with my limited ammo.   
I justified it by telling myself there’s no use dying with a full magazine.   
I followed once again, nearly jumping for joy when I came to the spot where it had disappeared and saw a spot of fresh blood on the ground. I was hoping for more, but as I went, the drops were every few feet. Even though it didn’t seem like much, at the speed it was running I was sure it had sprung a major leak.  
I followed the trail deeper into the cave. There was a chill in the air that made me shudder. My mind told me it felt like a tomb… my tomb. I shook off those thoughts and continued until the blood stopped.  
I shone my light on the small puddle and the ground beyond where there was no blood.  
My mind screamed at me that it was a trap. I shone my light all around, even on the ceiling, but I couldn’t see it. I started backing out the same way I’d come in, my eyes darting all around in search of my prey.   
It hit me like a bulldozer going sixty miles an hour. It had come out of nowhere and rammed me in the back. I sprawled out on the floor, rolling to a stop. My flashlight lay a few feet away and I had no idea where the gun was.   
The wind was knocked out of me. I tried to breathe but couldn’t. I just lay there gasping for air. It slowly circled around me, growling and bristling. I knew it was going for the kill. I screamed at my brain to move but my body refused to cooperate. I tried to focus on my breathing and regain mobility as it circled closer.   
I could see its breath chugging out of its mouth like a steam engine. I knew it was time. My arm was the first to recover. I slowly moved it toward the flashlight. It stopped circling just as I got a grip on the light.   
I saw the creature hunching to lunge at me. I clicked the light to strobe and aimed it at the creature’s face. It screamed and clawed at the air as if it could fight off the light.  
I rose to my knees, keeping the light on it. When it turned away, I shone it around desperately searching for my gun. I found it a few yards away and tried to run for it, but my body hadn’t fully recovered and I fell flat on my face.  
My life in the balance, I didn’t bother with the pain of my freshly broken nose, I crawled toward the gun with every ounce of energy in me.   
It seemed like an eternity until I put my hand on the grip and brought it to bear on the creature. It had recovered and was running at me full speed. I shone the strobe at it again and it veered away from the light.   
I stood and aimed at it, squeezing the trigger. I saw the satisfying impact of the bullet in its side and squeezed the trigger again making another hole on the far side of its chest.   
I squeezed over and over, hitting it each time and watching it reel from the impact, but it stayed on its feet. It growled and charged as my slide locked back showing an empty chamber.   
I shone the strobe in its eyes once more but this time it just ran off to the other side of the room. I used the distraction to eject my magazine and load in the last full one.   
I released the slide and started firing immediately, hitting it in the hind quarter and leg, but not stopping it. I stopped shooting and forced myself to concentrate. I aimed carefully as it ran toward me and at the right moment I squeezed the trigger.  
It went down hard, squealing like a stuck pig.  
It thrashed and clawed at its face, tumbling over itself. Blood flew everywhere from its many gunshot wounds, but it still continued flailing about and squealing in pain.   
After a few minutes of this, it finally settled down and was still enough for me to see my handiwork. I had shot it in the eye. There was nothing left there but a bloody hole.   
I didn’t dare approach it. I stood at a respectful distance and watched, my gun ready if it tried to make a move.   
Its squeals became moans, finally turning into a heavy sigh and then it was still.  
I shone the light on it, feeling cautiously optimistic that this thing was no longer a threat. And then I remembered what I was doing here in the first place. I tried to get my bearings and proceeded further into the cave. My main thought was not only finding the hiker alive but also hoping and praying there wasn’t another one of those creatures here. I didn’t have another fight like that in me.  
The path curved downwards until it came to a large open area. I shone the light around looking for anything. Off in the far corner, there was a flash of red as I panned through. I approached it cautiously and found it was a jacket. Inside the jacket was a piece of meat that used to be a human being.   
His throat had been ripped out and his legs were gone. All that was left of them were some bones. The thing must’ve been working its way up, saving the arms and torso for later. The man’s face was a frozen scream. I can’t even imagine the horror of being dragged away from your loved ones only to be murdered and eaten in some cold, dark cave. I wasn’t even sure if he was dead when the thing ripped his legs off.   
I had to stop focusing on such things and decide what to do. If I left the remains here there was no doubt some other animal would come by and finish off what the creature had started. I needed to try to get him to his family for closure and a proper burial.  
I bent down, trying to figure out how to carry him. A fireman’s carry was out. There were no legs for counterbalance. In the end, I picked him up by his arms and flung them over my shoulder, holding onto them and turning his body into some macabre backpack.  
I started back out of the cave, hoping I’d be able to carry him all the way back to the campsite and finally back to my truck.   
As I trudged back through the cave, I came to the section where our fight had taken place. Shell casings and blood were strewn about the ground. I wondered to myself how I had avoided getting hit by a stray ricochet when I looked over to where the creature lay. Only it wasn’t there. I shone my light all around frantically whipping around, but it was gone.   
I found the spot where it had laid still and I thought it had died. There was a large pool of blood there, but no body. I pulled my gun out of my holster, ejected the magazine, and checked to see how many rounds I had left. There were only two. I hoped wherever that thing was that it was no longer in the mood for hunting… or revenge.  
In the end, I decided there was nothing I could do. If the thing attacked me, I was defenseless, carrying literal dead weight on my back.   
I holstered the gun and hitched up my human backpack, then shone the light toward the mouth of the cave and kept walking. My hearing was just starting to return to normal, although I was sure I would have some permanent hearing loss. I could hear the shuffling of my feet as I staggered toward the cave opening.   
When I got there I found a world transformed. Daylight was just starting to peek its way around the dark. However, the rain had created a massive fog bank. I couldn’t see anything down in the valley I’d come from. It was a sea of fog. Only the peaks of the mountains escaped its suffocating blanket.   
I looked over and saw my backpack patiently waiting for my return. I lay my burden down and got the water bottle out, glad that I had saved the last drink for now. As I sat on the edge of the cave precipice, I looked down and wondered how I was going to get the body down there without falling to my own death.   
For an instant, it was tempting to throw it down and find it at the bottom once I climbed down. But I thought this fellow had been through enough and didn’t need the indignity of becoming a human frisbee. I dug through my backpack and found some bungee cords. I bungeed him to my back and carefully started my descent, leaving my faithful backpack to watch me desert it. I wished I could take it with me but there was no way I could carry both.  
As I climbed down there were a few times I lost footing and nearly took the short and deadly route down. Fortunately, I made it to the bottom in one piece. Instead of celebrating though, I discovered a new problem. The fog was so thick I could barely see my hand in front of my face. I had no idea how I was going to find my way out of there.  
I decided to go straight away from the mountain and hope the fog cleared as I went.   
The rain had turned the forest into a marshland. The ground was soft and the streams had overgrown their banks. I found myself wading through knee-deep water on more than one occasion.   
As I trudged along, hoping I had enough energy to get back without collapsing from exhaustion, two thoughts chased each other around my mind. Where were the other hikers, and where was the creature?  
I hadn’t seen any other remains in the cave. If it had killed them, it hadn’t had time to take them back to the cave yet. Perhaps my pursuit had forced it to retreat to its cave before it could properly retrieve its other bounty.   
I had kept my ears open for any sounds of it following me. The most disconcerting thing was the lack of forest noises. The animals and birds were strangely silent. Usually, that meant there was a predator nearby. In this ungodly fog perhaps they were just sleeping waiting for it to clear.   
That sounded good. It gave me the false illusion that I wasn’t in mortal danger from a wounded alpha predator bent on revenge.   
But I couldn’t focus on that or worry would drain my resolve to get us both out of there.   
I took a break from trudging and tried to get my bearings. I checked my watch and I had been walking for over an hour. It was late morning and the sun should’ve been high in the sky. But the oppressive fog continued to smother it.  
I looked around, but there was nothing to see except the dingy grey curtain of hopelessness. I was about to collapse and give up when I heard it. The faint sound of hope. I could hear the creek running.   
As hope rose, it was suddenly dashed. I heard the sound of a footstep behind me. I whipped around so fast that my macabre backpack nearly made me lose my balance.  
I couldn’t see anything through the fog. But that didn’t mean it wasn’t there.   
With a renewed surge of determination, along with a strong desire to elude whatever was pursuing me, I set out toward the sound of the creek.   
It was still slow going, but I found fearing for my life was a great motivator. I had no doubt whatsoever that the footsteps behind me were those of the creature bent on revenge.  
After what seemed like an eternity I gazed at the most awesome sight I’d seen all day, Wolf Creek in all its six-foot wide, overflowing banks glory. I followed it until I came across Lakeshore trail and the journey became much easier. The fog was even beginning to lift, which was a blessing but also a curse.   
I could finally see far enough behind me to confirm that the creature was indeed following me. I’d wondered the entire time why it hadn’t overtaken me, but now that I caught sight of it, I understood.   
It was grotesque. It looked like it came straight from hell. Its one eye socket was leaking gore and the many bullet wounds covered it in blood. There were places where I could see internal organs trying to escape the body and its right leg had a bullet wound. It limped severely. As I watched it I wondered how it had made it this far. But then I looked into its remaining eye and saw intense rage burning. I knew I would die a horribly grotesque death if I slowed enough for it to catch up.  
We continued this slow O.J. pursuit of death until I reached the banks where Wolf Creek opened up into the lake.   
My energy was nearly gone. At one point I considered dropping my human backpack in hopes that it would feed on it instead of me. But then I would’ve failed. I came here to find this hiker and bring him back. The thought lit a fire deep within me.   
I came to the edge of the lake, with the creature a mere few yards behind me. I glanced around, hoping to see a boat I could flag down, but no such luck. With no other choice, I waded into the water. It was cold but instead of refreshing me, it chilled me and sapped my little remaining strength.   
The creature entered the water behind me and seemed to be gaining.   
It got deeper to the point where I was no longer able to walk and had to start swimming. The far side of the lake looked like it was miles away, even though I knew it was much less than that.   
I swam for all I was worth, knowing at any moment I would be pulled under by the creature. My passenger strapped to my back wasn’t helping either. The literal definition of ‘dead weight’ every minute I had to fight off the urge to dump him.   
When I reached the other side I was exhausted. I lay there on the shore, waiting for the creature to disembowel me, but unable to move to defend myself in any way.   
With great effort, I turned to look back and see when my doom would come.  
To my great surprise, I saw it staring at me from the far beach. I guess it couldn’t swim.   
I chuckled to myself as I lay there gathering strength for the continued journey back to the truck.   
Eventually, I got there. As I opened the door, for a fleeting moment I considered putting the hiker in the passenger’s seat. But then I looked at the wet, gore-soaked torso and reconsidered, gently laying him in the truck bed.   
The drive back was long and I continually had to shake myself to stay awake. But eventually, I made it to the cabin. I stumbled up to the door and knocked once.  
“Oh my God!” the woman said when she saw me. “Are you alright?”  
I hung my head. “No, but I will be after around three days of sleep. Unfortunately, I have bad news for you. I found your husband, but not your son or brother-in-law.”  
A man and a boy came out of the cabin and stared at me. I instantly knew who they were and grabbed them both in a huge hug.  
“I’m so glad you made it out,” I said fighting back tears.  
“Umm… thanks,” the man said pulling out of my hug. “Who are you again?”  
“He’s the ranger that came to look for all three of you,” she said.  
“I don’t understand, your tracks were confusing,” I said. “I followed them down to the bridge, but then they went back up to the campsite.”  
“We got some rest,” the boy said. “Then Uncle Roger came and said we were going. We left everything and slipped away to the boat. Rowed across the river and left.”  
I smiled.   
“I’m very glad you did.”  
He looked at me with expectant eyes.  
“You said you found my dad?”  
My face fell.  
“I did, but it was too late.”  
“So, he’s… ?”  
I nodded somberly.  
“Where is he?”  
“He’s in my truck, but you don’t want to see that.”  
Before I could say another word, he ran to the truck and looked in the passenger’s seat. A look of confusion fell over his eyes as he saw no one there. And then he slowly looked toward the bed of the truck. He stepped back and looked over the side into the bed. He instantly dissolved into tears and slid down the side of the truck sobbing.  
“I’m so sorry,” I said to the woman and man.  
She grabbed me and gave me a hug.   
“Don’t be,” she said. “Without you, we wouldn’t have known for weeks, months, maybe even years what had happened. We would go on looking with false hope. You’ve given us a chance for closure and to properly grieve.”  
She released me and I wiped my eyes.   
I looked at the man and walked down to the truck. He followed and we gently removed the body and laid him on the couch, then covered him with a blanket.  
The boy followed us back to the cabin, but wouldn’t look at me or anyone else. He sat in a chair and stared at the blanket covering his father’s body.  
I knew I had done all I could, so I excused myself and started toward the door. I paused and said to the boy, “I promise I’ll make sure that thing never hurts anyone again.”  
He looked up at me, eyes full of tears, and said, “How will that help my dad?”  
His mother opened her mouth but I held a hand up to silence her. I knew the boy was just hurting. I left without another word.   
On the drive back, I called the station and told them everything that had happened then told them I was going home and calling off for the following day.  
After getting home and stumbling into a shower and collapsing in bed, there was only one thought on my mind.   
I would return to Wolf Creek very soon with more and bigger guns. I would end that monster if it was the last thing I did.  
But that is another story…
