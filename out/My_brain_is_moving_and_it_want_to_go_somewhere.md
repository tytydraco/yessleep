I’m not sure if anyone will believe this, but I have to write it down before I lose control of my own body. It started a few weeks ago — a strange sensation deep inside my head. Not pain. Not pressure, but something soft and threading, like loose hairs laying on my brain; that faint ticklishness. I’d turn my head and feel a faint tug, like something rigid yet spongey had taken root inside my skull and was tightening its grip, unwilling to be disturbed. At first, I assumed it was just stress, fatigue, maybe sinus pressure — but I could feel things stretching and tightening when I moved; tiny strands shifting just under the bone. It never went away.

Then the pull began. It started small, just this creeping urge to move. I'd be sitting on the couch and suddenly feel like I had to stand — no reason, no destination — just a rising tension behind my eyes, like a tingling in my brain. I found myself walking around the apartment at night, plodding along in small, looping paths without knowing why, like some kind of odd idle movement. I went to my GP after I woke up with the distinct feeling that something had burrowed deeper. I could feel something digging in my brain, securing its hold. I told her what I was feeling — the tugging, the tension, the sense of movements inside my skull. She ran scans, checked my ears, ordered blood work. All normal. She was polite, but distant. Told me she’d seen similar symptoms in patients with anxiety or somatic disorders. She referred me to a psychiatrist.

I went, told him everything too — the movement, the pull, the way it feels like something is growing inside me, weaving itself through me. He asked about hallucinations, stress, dissociation. Gave me a prescription. I never filled it. I know what I’m feeling — something is growing inside me, something that shouldn't be there. It’s not a tumor, not some hallucination or psychosis; it’s *alive*, and it’s *taking over*. I can feel it tightening its hold as the days pass by, like it’s slowly squeezing out my will... hollowing me out.

I’ve tried to explain this to people. The doctor. The shrink. Even friends. I don’t get much of a response anymore — just worried glances or read receipts with no reply. And yeah, okay — I know how this sounds. Believe me, I know. Fungal parasites? Mind control? It’s ridiculous. I even joked to myself at first that it was like The Last of Us, that I was becoming one of those creepy mushroom zombies. The joke doesn’t feel funny anymore.

I looked it up and that cordyceps stuff is real. Not in people — at least not yet — but in insects; ants and wasps. Spores invade their body, hijack the brain, force them to climb somewhere high... and then bloom through their skulls. It’s real. There’s all sorts of documentary videos and stuff on it. Look it up if you don’t believe me. But I think that’s what’s happening to me. Or something close. Something that preys on humans.

I went back to the doctor. I didn’t even call ahead; just walked in. But they wouldn’t let me see her. The receptionist said she wasn’t in. But I could *hear* her. I heard her voice down the hall — the tone she uses when she’s explaining what’s wrong with you. I waited anyway. Said I’d be happy to sit as long as it takes with no complaint, not a peep. Security asked me to leave ten minutes later, told me I was being "disruptive." I don’t remember raising my voice, I don’t remember standing up, but when I came to in my car, already buckled in, my hands were shaking and my reflection was not as composed as I thought I was. There was something gritty in my mouth again. Something dry, thick, and earthy. I spat into my hand. It looked like damp ash.

I can feel those filaments tightening behind my eyes when I resist the pull. It’s not just a tug or a whisper anymore — it’s like my body is turning against me, slowly moving with a mind I don’t own. I wake up with nosebleeds, soil beneath my fingernails, and a taste in my mouth — musty and wet, like I’ve been gnawing rotting wood. I’ve started coughing too. A dry, wheezing noise that leaves this horrible grit in my throat. Black flecks on my pillow. Always east. Always toward the woods.

Last night, I stood at the forest’s edge. I don’t remember getting there. I just remember the trees bending slightly forward — like they were listening. The air was warm and thick with a sweetness I couldn’t quite place. Not rot — *growth*. The scent of something blooming underground. I ran back as those thoughts invaded me.

Today I did something I probably shouldn’t have: I ordered one of those USB endoscopy cameras — the kind mechanics use. I sterilized it, fed it through my nostril and into the sinus cavity. It took effort. Pressure. Pain. I could feel cartilage resisting me. I pushed gently until I thought I’d black out, tears streaming from one eye, the shaft scraping against something that didn’t feel right. I kept going. My ears rang. My throat filled with the taste of iron and something old, damp — like water from a flooded basement. Finally the space opened up behind my eyes, and the camera lit it for just a moment.

It wasn’t brain tissue. It was *latticed*. A mesh of pale threads, glistening in the light, tangled like fine tendrils, undulating slowly. I thought it was breathing — but no. It was tensing. Reacting. I don’t know if the camera accidentally slipped further in or if the whole structure shifted toward the lens. But I knew what happened — I *saw* it move. Then pain suddenly bloomed at the base of my skull — sharp, like someone driving needles into my brain stem. I collapsed. The camera fell from my shaky hands as everything tilted and my knees gave out, my vision going dark.

When I came to, I was on the kitchen floor. The camera was coiled next to me in a slick red loop. My nose had pissed blood down my chin. There was something in my throat too — not just blood, but something thicker. Sticky. I spat it up in the sink. It clung to the metal basin for a few seconds before slipping away down the drain. It looked like clear membrane, and at first I thought it was just phlegm or something — but as it slid away, I could see strings of white film inside the mucus.

I’m coughing more. My chest is tight. My skin itches in places that weren’t itchy yesterday. I think — I *think* it’s spreading out. Expanding throughout my body.

I ordered industrial-strength antifungal chemicals — the kind used in warehouses and farms, not the over-the-counter creams and sprays you find in pharmacies. I don’t think the usual stuff would even scratch this, maybe it’ll just irritate it or something, god only knows. I’m not sure if this will help, or just poison me, but I’m out of options. If I can just keep this thing restrained until the chemicals arrive, maybe I can fight back, maybe I can claw my way out of this. If I can just make it through the night, hold on to what’s left of myself…

Tonight, I’m taking drastic measures. I’ve bolted the doors. Moved the fridge against the front door. Screwed the windows shut. Stapled the curtains over them. I locked myself in the bedroom with chains and a bike lock. Wrapped my legs in duct tape. Tied my wrists to the bedframe. Swallowed the key. *I am not leaving this house tonight.*

**Edit:** It’s 3:12 a.m.

I woke up standing at my front door. The locks are broken. The fridge is toppled. My wrists are bleeding. My fingers are all grazed. My feet are caked in soft, black dirt that smells... sweet and *enticing*. And on my pillow… something’s there. Not quite dust. Not quite mold. A faint shimmer — like pollen, but heavier. It clings to the fabric in vague, slow-shifting patterns. When I get near, it stirs lazily. Like it’s aware. Like it *knows* I’m awake.

I don’t remember getting out. I don’t remember undoing anything. The cough I’ve had for days has gotten worse. I spat into my hand just now. Little pale flecks floated in my saliva — *spores*.

I’m too tired to fight anymore. Maybe it’s already too late.

The woods are calling.  
*I’m going to the woods tonight.*  
*I’m going home.*
