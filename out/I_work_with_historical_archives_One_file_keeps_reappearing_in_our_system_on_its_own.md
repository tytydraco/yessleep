BERN, SWITZERLAND 1893.

HISTORICAL RECORD 001.

Internationaler Kongress für Nachrichten- und Normenwesen, Bern, Herbst 1893.

In Bern, 1893, the Confederation discovered that standards do not merely describe the world, but that they instruct it.

The federal center status of Bern was still in its infancy, and construction of the central parliamentary building was to begin within the next year. The first popular initiative had succeeded, an action of direct democracy: the banning of slaughter without prior stunning. All of these factors contributed to the mass urbanisation of Switzerland, inevitably leading to the need for rapid electrification.

Electrification demanded uniformity in a way the old city never had. Timekeeping could no longer be parochial; tram schedules could not tolerate interpretation; telegraph protocols did not forgive ambiguity. What had once been merely administrative inconvenience became physical risk. A grid does not accept “close enough.” A timetable cannot be argued with. And so the Confederation’s appetite for standards grew.

It was with this context that the first IKNN was called. It was necessary to formalise telegraph protocols, tram timetables, and cross-border correspondence into interoperable standards. Near the scheduled end of the meeting, the Director of the Universal Postal Union (UPU)—more office than man, his authority already printed into every envelope in Europe—demanded the room’s eyes. The majority of the members held him in high regard, as within 60 years the postal union was widely believed to be more successful than the unions of the rest of Europe, overall a pride point for the administration. In response, other countries spread all manner of rumors out of envy.

It was here the Director explained how he accomplished this task. From his satchel he produced a rubber stamp; from beneath the table, a nondescript wooden box. The room stared in quiet confusion. He then proclaimed the item as s’Zuekunfts-Stämpfeli (“the Little Future Stamp”), and attributed the success of the UPU to it. The wooden box was closed, and the man stamped it. He showed the resulting stamp to the room. Curiously, it did not make the symbol on the Little Future Stamp. Yet, everyone agreed it was an address. An address that was not in any words or numbers. With the authority the Director had garnered over the last several years, he said “This box will be delivered to the merchant in Bern who needs it most.” The room believed him. 

Only later did the compilers of the Special Registry agree on what had occurred in that room: the stamp did not write language. It wrote a standard. An address that required no alphabet because the act of collective recognition completed it. The UPU leader did not so much label the box as he issued a routing instruction to the world; one that reality itself accepted as valid.

He implied, without elaboration, that the stamp had been used before; that the Union’s “impossible efficiency” was not administrative genius, but compliance from the world itself.

He walked outside, only a few members followed, dropped the box into a mailbox, and closed it. He reopened the mailbox, and the wooden box was gone. The demonstration was not alarming because it was impossible, but because it was replicable. If a “need-based” address could be asserted with enough authority, then delivery was only the gentlest application of the method. A box could be sent to a starving merchant, or to a judge, a minister, even a child. And it would arrive as if it had always been meant to. Sovereignty, privacy, even causality would become matters of paperwork and public agreement.

The next day, a search for merchants that received an unaccounted for wooden box was performed. A struggling merchant who could not afford containers for his goods was found to be packing spices in a wooden box with the seal, exactly as remembered. The merchant could not recall receiving the box. He only said that he had “always had it,” and that this answer felt, to him, sufficient. 

The government’s response was therefore not to deny the event, but to domesticate it: to bring the phenomenon under civil procedure before it emerged under rumor. The solution was characteristically Swiss: commissioned, multilingual, meticulously archived. Yet the Commission’s true purpose, recorded only in the Special Registry, was containment: to prevent any single explanation of the stamp from becoming complete enough to make the world conform to it. Die Eidgenössische Kommission für Nachrichten- und Normenwesen (EKNN), or the Federal Commission for Communications and Standards, was founded. The Commission discovered that equivalence itself was dangerous: a perfectly faithful translation produced a single, shared interpretation, and shared interpretation produced “Lock-In.”

The following is the first seven articles from the charter the EKNN wrote soon after the Little Future Stamp incident:

\[BEGIN EXCERPT\]

**Charter of the EKNN (Bern, October 1893)**

**Art. I: Mandate**  
The Commission is constituted to promote the harmonisation of communications, measures, timekeeping, and civic standards within the Confederation and in correspondence with foreign administrations.

**Art. II: Congress Authority**  
The Commission may convene congresses, invite foreign delegates, and publish circulars in the national languages for the purpose of interoperability and public confidence. 

**Art. III: The Public Collection**  
To support instruction and trust, the Commission establishes a public collection (Museum) of instruments, specimens, and documents relevant to communications, standardisation, and civic electrification.

**Art. IV: The Special Registry**  
The Commission shall maintain a Special Registry of irregular specimens and correspondence whose circulation is to be regulated by internal procedure.

**Art. V: Publication Principle**  
All official publications shall be issued in multiple authorised languages. Where equivalence is unattainable, the Commission may preserve *parallel authorised formulations*.

**Art. VI: Civic Continuity**  
The Commission may cooperate with municipal works in matters of electrical continuity and public order where standards are implicated.

**Art. VII: Confidentiality**  
Irregular specimens and procedures concerning the Special Registry are excluded from ordinary archival access.

**Addendum** (Registry compiler): The Commission further observed that collective affect, especially awe and dread, stabilised civic continuity during interpretive drift; hence the necessity of a controlled public instrument.

*Registry Note:* Within four weeks of the Congress, three municipal departments independently adopted identical filing templates of unknown origin. Two were withdrawn before publication. One circulated throughout.

\[END EXCERPT\]

*Compiler’s Closing Note:* The term “Lock-In” does not appear in the 1893 charter. It entered the Registry in 1895, after the first incident involving public signage.

\[Archivist’s note, 2026: This record was re-circulated internally after the “Tram Map Event.” Cross-reference HISTORICAL RECORD 002.\]
