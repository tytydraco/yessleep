I don’t remember dying. That’s the first thing I noticed when I woke up. There was no crash, no hospital bed, no blinding light at the end of a tunnel. Just… falling.  

It wasn’t like falling in a dream, where you wake up before you hit the ground. No, this was endless, stomach-churning plummeting through an abyss so black it felt like the world had been erased. The air—or whatever passed for air—was thick and hot, rushing past me in waves that smelled of sulfur and decay. My screams were swallowed by the void, leaving me with nothing but the sound of my own heartbeat hammering in my ears.  

Then I hit something. Not ground, not water—something soft and wet that gave way beneath me, like landing on a pile of rotting meat. The stench was unbearable, a putrid cocktail of blood, bile, and something sweet that made my stomach churn. I gagged as I pushed myself upright, my hands sinking wrist-deep into the squelching surface.  

When I looked around, I realized I wasn’t alone.  

The landscape stretched endlessly in every direction—a vast expanse of flesh-like terrain riddled with open sores that oozed black ichor. Bone spires jutted out at odd angles, some cracked and splintered as if gnawed on by massive jaws. And scattered across this grotesque wasteland were figures—human-shaped but wrong. Their bodies were twisted and broken, their skin peeling away to reveal raw muscle and sinew beneath. They crawled aimlessly, their mouths opening and closing as if trying to scream but producing only faint, wet gurgles.  

One of them turned its head toward me. Its eyes—if you could call them that—were hollow pits that wept a thick, tar-like substance. It reached out with a hand that ended in jagged bone stumps where fingers should have been.  

I scrambled backward, slipping on the slick surface beneath me. “Stay away!” I shouted, though my voice sounded small and pathetic in this place.  

The thing didn’t respond—it just kept crawling toward me with an agonizing slowness, dragging itself across the fleshy ground with its ruined limbs. Behind it, more figures began to stir, their heads snapping toward me in unison like predators catching the scent of prey.

I ran—or tried to. The ground squelched beneath my feet like raw meat, threatening to swallow me whole with every step. The air grew thicker the farther I went, clinging to my skin like oil and filling my lungs with every breath until I thought I might choke on it.

The landscape shifted as I moved deeper into the wasteland. The flesh-like ground gave way to something even worse—a field of jagged teeth the size of gravestones jutting out from a river of blood that flowed sluggishly through the valley below. The teeth clicked together as if chewing on invisible prey, their edges stained dark with dried gore.

I tried not to look too closely at the river itself, but my eyes betrayed me. Floating in its sluggish current were bodies—hundreds of them—some whole, others torn apart as if by wild animals. Their faces were frozen in expressions of agony, mouths open wide in silent screams that echoed in my mind even though no sound came from them.

That’s when I saw them: creatures unlike anything I’d ever imagined even in my worst nightmares.

They moved like shadows given form—tall and thin with elongated limbs that bent at impossible angles. Their skin was translucent, revealing writhing veins filled with black ichor beneath the surface. Their heads were featureless except for their mouths—gaping maws lined with needle-like teeth that dripped with saliva so corrosive it hissed when it hit the ground.

One of them turned its head toward me—or what passed for its head—and let out a sound that froze me in place: a low growl that vibrated through the air like an earthquake.

I didn’t wait for it to come closer. 

I don’t know how long I ran before I collapsed next to what looked like a dead tree made of bone and sinew. My legs burned with exhaustion, and my lungs felt like they were filled with molten lead. But stopping meant death—or worse—and so I forced myself to keep moving.

That’s when I heard it: a voice.

“Lost one…” it whispered, soft and melodic yet dripping with malice.

I spun around but saw nothing except for the endless wasteland stretching out behind me.

“Over here…” the voice cooed again.

This time I saw it—a figure standing atop one of the bone spires in the distance. It was human-shaped but impossibly tall and thin, its skin pale and stretched tight over its skeletal frame like parchment over bone. Its eyes glowed faintly in the darkness—a sickly yellow light that seemed to pierce through me.

“Who are you?” I demanded, though my voice trembled.

The figure tilted its head as if amused by my question.

“I am your guide,” it said simply.

“Guide? Guide to what?” My heart pounded as I took an involuntary step back.

“To understanding,” it replied cryptically before leaping down from the spire with unnatural grace.

As it approached, I noticed details I hadn’t seen before—its hands ended in claws that dripped with black ichor, and its mouth was filled with rows of jagged teeth that seemed too large for its face.

“You don’t belong here,” it said softly as it circled me like a predator sizing up its prey.

“I know!” I shouted desperately. “I’m not supposed to be here! This is some kind of mistake!”

The creature stopped suddenly and leaned in close until its face was inches from mine.

“There are no mistakes,” it whispered before everything went black.

When I woke up, I wasn’t in the wasteland anymore.  

The first thing I noticed was the sound—a low, rhythmic thudding, like the beating of a massive heart. It reverberated through the ground, through my chest, through my skull. The air was damp and suffocating, thick with the smell of iron and rot.  

I was lying on a surface that felt alive—warm, pulsating slightly beneath me. When I opened my eyes, I saw that the ground was no longer made of flesh but something worse: it was a network of veins and arteries, pulsing with dark, sluggish liquid. They crisscrossed in every direction, forming a grotesque web that stretched as far as I could see.  

Above me hung a sky that wasn’t a sky at all. It was a ceiling—a dome of raw muscle that twitched and contracted as if it were breathing. Every so often, a black fluid would drip from it, sizzling as it hit the ground and releasing a foul-smelling vapor.  

I tried to stand, but my legs felt weak and unsteady. My head throbbed with pain, and my vision swam as if I were underwater. That’s when I heard it again—the voice.  

“Lost one…” It was faint now, barely more than a whisper carried on the hot, stagnant air.  

“Where are you?” I croaked, my throat raw and dry. My voice sounded small and pathetic in this place, swallowed up by the oppressive atmosphere.  

There was no reply—only the sound of that infernal heartbeat, growing louder with every passing second.  

Then I saw them: figures moving in the distance. They were human-shaped but distorted, their bodies elongated and twisted like reflections in a funhouse mirror. Their movements were jerky and unnatural, as if they were being controlled by invisible strings.  

I froze as one of them turned its head toward me. Its face—or what was left of it—was a mask of agony. Its skin had been peeled away in strips, exposing raw muscle and bone beneath. Its eyes were wide and unblinking, filled with an expression of eternal torment that made my stomach churn.

It opened its mouth to scream—but no sound came out. Instead, black ichor poured from its lips, dripping onto the ground where it hissed and bubbled like acid.

I stumbled backward in horror, my foot catching on one of the pulsating veins beneath me. The sudden movement seemed to draw their attention because now all of them were turning toward me—dozens of them—moving with that same jerky motion as they began to close the distance between us.

I ran again—if you could even call it running in this place where every step felt like wading through tar. The ground beneath me shifted and writhed as if trying to trip me up, and the air grew heavier with each breath until it felt like I was suffocating.

Behind me came the sound of wet slapping footsteps—dozens of them—growing louder with every passing second.

I didn’t dare look back.

The terrain grew more treacherous as I fled deeper into this hellish landscape. The veins beneath my feet became thicker and more pronounced, some bulging upward like grotesque roots that threatened to trip me at every turn. Pools of black ichor bubbled up from cracks in the ground, releasing noxious fumes that burned my eyes and throat.

And then there were the whispers.

They came from everywhere and nowhere all at once—a cacophony of voices speaking in languages I couldn’t understand but somehow felt deep within my bones. They weren’t just sounds; they were emotions—rage, despair, longing—all crashing over me like waves until I thought I might drown in them.

“You don’t belong here…” one voice hissed.

“Why did you come?” another demanded.

“Run,” whispered a third—so close it felt like it was right next to my ear.

I stumbled to a halt as I reached the edge of a massive chasm that split the ground before me. It stretched endlessly in both directions—a yawning void filled with swirling darkness that seemed to pulse with malevolent energy.

There was no way across.

Behind me came the sound of those wet footsteps growing closer—and then stopping.

I turned slowly to see them standing there at the edge of the clearing: dozens of those twisted figures with their flayed faces and hollow eyes staring at me silently.

And then they parted.

From their midst emerged something worse—a creature so grotesque it defied comprehension.

Its body was an amalgamation of flesh and bone stitched together haphazardly as if by some deranged artist trying to create life from death. Its limbs were too long for its body, ending in claws that scraped against the ground with every step. Its face—or what passed for one—was featureless except for a gaping maw filled with rows upon rows of jagged teeth that dripped with black ichor.

It let out a low growl—a sound so deep it vibrated through my chest—and began to advance toward me.

Panic surged through me as I backed away from the creature until my heels were teetering on the edge of the chasm behind me.

“No,” I whispered to myself. “This can’t be happening.”

The creature tilted its head as if mocking my fear before letting out another growl—a sound that sent shivers down my spine.

I glanced back at the chasm behind me—the swirling darkness below seemed almost inviting compared to what stood before me now.

“I can’t…” I muttered under my breath as tears streamed down my face.

But then something strange happened—the whispers returned—but this time they weren’t angry or accusatory; they were… encouraging?

“Jump,” one voice said softly.

“You must trust us,” another added.

The creature lunged toward me just as I made my decision—I jumped backward into the void.

I don’t know how long I fell. Time didn’t feel real anymore—just an endless sensation of weightlessness, my body tumbling through the suffocating darkness. The whispers followed me, growing louder and more insistent, their words twisting into a chaotic cacophony that I couldn’t escape.  

Then, without warning, the falling stopped.  

I slammed into something hard and cold, the impact shattering every bone in my body. My vision exploded into a kaleidoscope of red and black as pain consumed me. I tried to scream, but my lungs refused to work. My body was broken, mangled beyond recognition—I could feel my limbs bent in ways they shouldn’t be, my ribs puncturing organs, my skull fractured like a dropped egg.  

And yet… I didn’t die. Not completely.  

I lay there on the cold, obsidian ground, gasping for air that never came. Above me, the void began to shift, swirling with faint shapes that coalesced into grotesque faces—faces made of smoke and shadow, their mouths stretching impossibly wide as they laughed at my suffering.  

“Welcome,” one of them hissed, its voice like nails scraping against glass. “You’ve only just begun.”  

Before I could comprehend what it meant, the ground beneath me cracked open like a jagged wound. A torrent of molten fire erupted from the fissure, engulfing me in an instant. My flesh melted away like wax under a blowtorch, exposing muscle and bone that sizzled and popped in the infernal heat. The pain was indescribable—a searing agony that consumed every fiber of my being.  

And then… nothing.   

When I opened my eyes again, I was whole—but not unchanged.  

I was lying on a new surface now, one that felt like polished stone but radiated an unnatural warmth. The air was thick with ash and smoke, stinging my eyes and filling my lungs with every breath. Above me loomed a sky of roiling fire and brimstone, casting everything in a sickly orange glow.  

I sat up slowly, my body trembling as memories of the fire flooded back to me. My skin felt raw and tender as if it had only just grown back over charred muscle and bone. I touched my face gingerly, half-expecting it to crumble away under my fingers—but it didn’t. Somehow, I was alive again—or something close to it.

That’s when I noticed the marks.

They were etched into my skin like brands—symbols I didn’t recognize but instinctively knew were significant. They pulsed faintly with a dull red light, sending waves of heat through my body that made me feel both alive and horribly violated.

“You cannot die here,” a voice said behind me.

I spun around to see the figure from before—the one who called itself my guide—standing atop a jagged rock formation nearby.

“What… what’s happening to me?” I demanded, my voice hoarse.

The figure tilted its head as if amused by my confusion.

“This is hell,” it said simply. “Death is not an escape—it is merely… an interruption.”  

The guide led me deeper into this new realm—a place it called "The Maw." It explained little as we walked through a landscape that seemed alive with hunger: massive pits lined with rows of teeth yawned open in the ground, snapping shut on anything unfortunate enough to wander too close; rivers of bile flowed sluggishly through valleys carved from bone; towering structures made of fused corpses loomed in the distance like grotesque monuments to suffering.

“What is this place?” I asked as we passed a writhing tree whose branches were made of human arms clawing at the air.

“The Maw,” the guide replied without looking back. “A place of consumption and renewal.”

I didn’t understand what it meant until we reached the heart of the Maw—a massive cavern filled with writhing tendrils that slithered across the ground like living roots. At its center was a gaping hole—a black void that seemed to pull everything toward it with an irresistible force.

“What happens if you fall in?” I asked nervously.

The guide turned to me with its featureless face and said nothing.

Before I could press further, one of the tendrils lashed out without warning, wrapping itself around my ankle with impossible strength. Its surface was slick and slimy, covered in tiny mouths that bit into my skin with razor-sharp teeth.

I screamed as it dragged me toward the void at the center of the cavern.

“Help me!” I shouted at the guide—but it didn’t move.

The tendril pulled me closer and closer until I was dangling over the edge of the void. Below me was nothing but darkness—a swirling abyss that seemed to pulse with malevolent energy.

And then it let go.

I fell into the void again—but this time there was no fire waiting for me at the bottom.

Instead, I landed inside something wet and warm—a stomach.

The walls around me were fleshy and pulsating, oozing with acidic slime that began eating away at my skin almost immediately. The air was thick with the stench of decay and bile, making it impossible to breathe without gagging.

I clawed at the walls desperately, trying to find some way out—but they only closed tighter around me, squeezing until I felt my ribs crack under the pressure.

The acid burned through muscle and bone until there was nothing left but pain—and then darkness once more.

When I opened my eyes again, I was back on solid ground—but now there were more marks on my skin, glowing brighter than before.

“You are learning,” the guide said cryptically as it appeared beside me once more.

“What am I learning?” I demanded angrily. “That this place is designed to torture me forever?”

“Perhaps,” it said with a hint of amusement. “Or perhaps you are learning how to survive.”
