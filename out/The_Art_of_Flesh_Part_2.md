I stared at the woman on the table, her body trembling weakly beneath the weight of her mutilation. Her lips moved again, but no sound came out this time—just a faint, gurgling breath. Her eyes fluttered open for a moment, locking onto mine with a look of pure desperation.  

I couldn’t do it.  

“No,” I whispered, shaking my head as I backed away from the table. “I’m not doing this.”  

The Flesh Stitcher tilted its head slightly, its mask of faces twisting into something that almost resembled amusement. “You misunderstand,” it said, its voice echoing in my skull like nails scraping against glass. “This is not a request.”  

Before I could respond, the room began to shift around me. The walls pulsed and rippled like living tissue, veins bulging and contracting as if they were pumping blood through some grotesque circulatory system. The shelves lining the walls collapsed into piles of flesh and bone, their contents spilling onto the floor in wet heaps.  

The door behind me slammed shut with a sickening squelch, sealing me inside with the creature and its horrifying creation.  

Panic surged through me as I turned back to face The Flesh Stitcher. Its long, shadowy fingers twitched impatiently as it gestured toward the table. “Finish her,” it repeated, its tone colder now—more commanding.  

I took another step back, my heart pounding so hard I thought it might burst from my chest. “No,” I said again, louder this time. “I won’t do it.”  

For a moment, there was silence—thick and suffocating, broken only by the faint wheezing breaths of the woman on the table. Then The Flesh Stitcher moved.

It didn’t walk or run—it simply *shifted*, its body flickering like a dying lightbulb as it appeared directly in front of me. Its mask loomed inches from my face now, and I could feel the coldness radiating off its form like a winter wind.

“You will,” it said softly but firmly. “Because you are *mine.*”

Before I could react, its hand shot out toward me—long fingers made of shadow and thread wrapping around my wrist like iron shackles. Pain exploded through my arm as I felt something sharp pierce my skin—needles digging into my flesh with surgical precision.

But adrenaline overpowered fear.

With a strength I didn’t know I had, I wrenched my arm free and bolted toward the door. It shouldn’t have opened—it had sealed itself shut moments ago—but somehow it gave way under my weight with a wet tearing sound that made bile rise in my throat.

I stumbled into another corridor identical to the first—long, dimly lit, and lined with doors that pulsed faintly like beating hearts. The air was thick with the stench of decay and something else—something metallic and sharp that made my head spin.

Behind me, I heard The Flesh Stitcher’s voice echoing through the halls: *“You cannot run from perfection.”*

I didn’t stop to look back.

The hallway stretched endlessly before me, twisting and turning in ways that didn’t make sense—like some kind of labyrinth designed to trap me forever. Every door I passed seemed to lead nowhere—just more operating rooms filled with grotesque creations stitched together from mismatched body parts.

Some of them were alive.

They reached out toward me as I ran past, their hands trembling and mouths opening in silent screams. One of them—a man with three arms sewn onto his torso—grabbed my ankle as I tried to pass him. His grip was weak but desperate, his eyes wide with terror as he mouthed two words: *“Kill me.”*

I kicked him off without thinking and kept running.

The hospital itself seemed to be alive now—its walls shifting and pulsing like they were breathing. Veins snaked across the floor beneath my feet, pumping thick black fluid that oozed up between cracks in the tiles.

At one point, I turned a corner and found myself face-to-face with a wall that hadn’t been there moments ago—a mass of flesh and bone that blocked my path completely. It twitched faintly as if aware of my presence before splitting open down the middle to reveal another corridor beyond.

I hesitated for only a moment before stepping through.

The new hallway was darker than the last—the flickering lights overhead barely illuminating what lay ahead. But even in the dim light, I could see them: rows upon rows of cages lining both sides of the corridor.

Inside each cage was one of The Flesh Stitcher’s creations.

Some were humanoid—stitched together from mismatched limbs like the woman on the table—but others were… something else entirely. Twisted amalgamations of flesh and bone that defied logic or reason: creatures with too many eyes or mouths; bodies fused together into grotesque shapes; things that shouldn’t exist but did.

They watched me as I passed by—some with fear in their eyes, others with hatred or despair. A few reached out through the bars of their cages, their hands trembling as they tried to grab hold of me.

“Help us,” one of them whispered—a voice so faint I almost didn’t hear it over the pounding of my own heartbeat.

“I can’t,” I whispered back before breaking into a run again.

Eventually, I stumbled into another operating room—this one larger than any I’d seen before. The walls were lined with shelves filled with jars containing severed limbs and organs suspended in murky fluid.

In the center of the room stood an operating table identical to all the others—but this one wasn’t empty either.

It held… *me.*

My breath caught in my throat as I stared down at my own body lying motionless on the table—my chest rising and falling faintly as if asleep or unconscious.

“What… what is this?” I whispered aloud.

“You are incomplete,” came The Flesh Stitcher’s voice from somewhere behind me.

I spun around to face it once more—but this time it wasn’t alone.

Standing beside it was another figure—a perfect replica of myself stitched together from pieces that didn’t belong: eyes that weren’t mine; hands too large for my frame; scars crisscrossing its skin like some grotesque patchwork quilt.

It smiled at me—a cold, empty smile that sent shivers down my spine—and spoke in *my* voice:

“You will finish what we started.”

I stumbled back, my legs trembling beneath me as I stared at the thing that wore my face. It wasn’t just a replica—it was *me*, or some twisted version of me. The scars, the mismatched eyes, the too-large hands… they were all wrong, but the way it moved, the way it *looked* at me, felt disturbingly familiar.  

“No,” I whispered, shaking my head violently. “This isn’t real. This can’t be real.”  

The Flesh Stitcher stepped forward, its towering form casting a long shadow over both of us. Its mask of faces twisted grotesquely, the stitched mouths curling into something that resembled a smile.  

“It is real,” it said in its chorus of voices. “You are my greatest creation.”  

I turned to run, but the door behind me had vanished. The walls of the room pulsed and shifted like living tissue, veins bulging beneath the surface as if mocking my attempts to escape.  

“You’ve spent your life perfecting others,” The Flesh Stitcher continued, its voice cold and unrelenting. “Saving them. Fixing them. But you’ve never turned that precision inward.”  

I shook my head again, tears streaming down my face as I backed away from the table where my doppelgänger lay watching me with those mismatched eyes. “I don’t understand,” I choked out. “What do you want from me?”  

It tilted its head slightly, as if amused by my question. “I want you to see what you truly are,” it said simply. “A creator.”  

The doppelgänger sat up slowly on the table, its movements unnervingly fluid despite its grotesque appearance. It swung its mismatched legs over the side and stood, towering over me by at least a foot thanks to its oversized limbs.  

“I am what you could be,” it said in my voice—a voice that sounded hollow and distant, like an echo in an empty room. “What you *will* be.”  

“No,” I whispered again, backing away until I hit the wall behind me. “You’re not me.”  

It smiled—a cold, empty smile that sent shivers down my spine—and took a step closer. “Not yet,” it said softly.  

The Flesh Stitcher gestured toward the operating table where the unconscious woman still lay, her body trembling weakly beneath her stitches. “Prove yourself,” it said again, its tone colder now—more commanding. “Finish her"

My stomach churned as bile rose in my throat. I turned back to the woman on the table, her pale skin crisscrossed with stitches that oozed dark fluid with every shallow breath she took. Her eyes fluttered open briefly as she saw me approach, and she let out a weak moan that sent shivers down my spine.

“Help… me…” she whispered, her voice barely audible.

I looked back at The Flesh Stitcher and its grotesque creation—my creation—and felt a wave of nausea wash over me.

“I can’t,” I said hoarsely, shaking my head violently as tears streamed down my face. “I won’t.”

The Flesh Stitcher’s mask twisted into something resembling disappointment as it stepped closer once more.

Before I could respond, I felt something sharp pierce my arm—a needle digging into my flesh with surgical precision.

Pain exploded through my body as I collapsed to the floor, clutching at the wound in my arm where thick black thread had begun to weave itself into my skin.

“You are incomplete,” The Flesh Stitcher said again—a statement rather than an explanation.

I screamed in agony as the thread spread through my body like wildfire—binding flesh to bone with every excruciating second.

“Stop!” I cried out desperately as tears streamed down my face—but The Flesh Stitcher only watched silently as its creation stepped forward once more.

“You will finish what we started,” it said again in *my* voice—a voice that sounded hollow and distant like an echo in an empty room.

Summoning every ounce of strength left within me, I gripped the scalpel tighter and lunged forward—not at The Flesh Stitcher or its creation but at myself.

If this was what they wanted—if this was what they thought made me complete—then I would destroy it myself.

I plunged the scalpel into my own chest.  

The pain was immediate and blinding, radiating through my body like fire. My knees buckled, and I collapsed onto the cold, pulsing floor, gasping for air as blood poured from the wound. The scalpel trembled in my hand, slick with crimson, but I didn’t let go.  

If they wanted me to be their creation, their *masterpiece*, I would deny them that satisfaction.  

The Flesh Stitcher watched in silence, its towering form unnervingly still as I writhed on the ground. My doppelgänger tilted its head, its hollow smile faltering for the first time.  

“You think this will save you?” The Flesh Stitcher’s voice echoed in my mind, colder than ever. “You cannot destroy what you are.”  

I gritted my teeth and pressed the scalpel deeper, the blade scraping against bone as I let out a guttural scream. The black thread coursing through my veins seemed to recoil, writhing beneath my skin like living worms. For a moment, I thought I had won—that I had finally broken free of its control.  

But then the room began to change.

The walls around me pulsed violently, veins bulging and bursting as dark fluid sprayed across the room. The shelves of jars shattered one by one, their contents spilling onto the floor in wet heaps of flesh and bone. The air grew thick with the stench of decay, suffocating me as I struggled to breathe.

And then I saw it.

The operating table where my unconscious body had lain was empty now—no sign of the person I thought was *me*. Instead, the figure standing before me—the doppelgänger—began to change. Its mismatched limbs twisted and contorted as stitches unraveled and re-stitched themselves in rapid succession. Its face shifted between mine and countless others, each one more grotesque than the last.

“You were never separate,” The Flesh Stitcher said, stepping closer as its mask of faces twisted into a grotesque smile. “You were always part of me.”

I tried to crawl away, but my body refused to move. The black thread that had been spreading through my veins now erupted from my skin, binding me to the floor like a marionette caught in its strings.

“No,” I whispered hoarsely, tears streaming down my face as realization dawned on me. “This isn’t real… this can’t be real.”

The Flesh Stitcher crouched beside me, its hollow sockets inches from my face. “Reality is what we make it,” it said softly. “And you… you are perfect.”

My vision blurred as the black thread tightened around me, pulling me upward like a puppet on strings. My limbs moved against my will, jerking unnaturally as if controlled by some unseen force. The scalpel fell from my hand, clattering uselessly to the floor below.

I tried to scream, but no sound came out.

The Flesh Stitcher gestured toward the operating table once more, and I felt myself being dragged toward it—my body hovering above the ground as if weightless. The doppelgänger stood beside the table now, watching silently as I was lowered onto its cold metal surface.

“You have always been mine,” The Flesh Stitcher said as it loomed over me. “From the moment you first picked up a scalpel… from the moment you first cut into flesh… you were destined for this.”

I wanted to fight back—to scream or thrash or do *something*—but my body refused to obey me. The black thread stitched itself into my skin with every passing second, binding me tighter and tighter until I could no longer feel where I ended and it began.

And then… it began to sew.

I felt every stitch as it worked—every needle piercing my flesh with excruciating precision. My body twisted and contorted beneath its hands as it tore me apart and put me back together again piece by piece.

It didn’t stop until there was nothing left of who I had been—until every inch of me had been remade in its image.

When it was finished, I opened my eyes… but they weren’t mine anymore.

I looked down at my hands—oversized and stitched together from mismatched pieces of flesh—and felt a wave of nausea wash over me. My reflection stared back at me from a shattered mirror on the wall—a grotesque patchwork version of myself that barely resembled who I had once been.

“You are complete,” The Flesh Stitcher said with satisfaction as it stepped back to admire its work.

In that moment, something inside me broke.

I no longer felt fear or anger or despair—just an overwhelming emptiness that consumed everything else. The threads that bound me were no longer foreign; they were part of me now… part of what I had become.

I turned toward the door as it opened with a wet squelch, revealing another corridor lined with cages filled with The Flesh Stitcher’s creations.

They watched silently as I stepped forward—my movements slow and deliberate like those of a predator stalking prey.

“Go,” The Flesh Stitcher said softly behind me. “Show them what perfection looks like.”

And so I did.

*As I walked down the corridor, their screams echoed behind me… but this time, they didn’t beg for help.*  

That's where the pages stopped, I have no idea what I just read. There is no way this is real right?
