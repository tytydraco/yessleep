It's been terrifying: [https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1k1u84g/strings\_iv/](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1k1u84g/strings_iv/)

I haven’t been wanting to leave my room. It’s gotten really difficult with my mom…I can’t…I couldn’t hardly look at her. I’ve been keeping silverware in my room and bottles of holy water near me. I lock my door every night and moved my bed away from the window.

It hasn’t helped me sleep.

My parents have been fighting. A lot. I’ve been trying to listen in when they argue. Mom wants to quit her job at the library. Mom has been using up her vacation time to go over to the Kinsey House. She keeps saying Mrs. Kinsey has gone to the East Coast to be with family. I don’t know whether Mom really knows that Mrs. Kinsey’s dead and that I’m the one that killed her.

I tried talking to my dad about their arguments. Encouraging him to get Mom out of there and away from the child without bringing up everything Logan and me have found out.

“I’m trying, son,” Dad said. “I don’t wanna push too hard though. I think she’s upset about Colleen still and this…this might be her way of coping.”

I told him it’s not a healthy way of coping. I plan on telling him everything I know when I have real evidence. So far, I’ve got bruises that are still healing and a body in an old lumber town ditch. Honestly those probably make me look worse than the actual devil next door.

I need Rowan to slip up. I need him to show what he really is to my dad so we can get Mom the fuck away.

In the meantime, I keep my distance from Mom. I haven’t noticed her left eye turn blue like I did that first night. Mostly it’s her usual brown color when she’s here. But I do notice her acting differently. She doesn’t touch the silverware and she bought some plastic utensils that she uses for her meals. Dad probably thinks this’s part of her “coping” but I know she’s becoming the new Mrs. Kinsey.

My mom’s not the only one who’s changed.  Logan has been quieter lately. His wound healed a little but the mark that Mr. Kinsey etched onto him is still there. We’re sure we know what we’re dealing with at this point.

“It’s a demon,” Logan whispered on the bus ride from school.

“How do we get rid of it?”

Logan explained to me that there can be many different ways to get rid of a demon. We could call an expert or perform a cleansing ritual ourselves. Neither of us know who would be an actual expert for this sort of thing. Logan thinks we should go to a Catholic church and ask for an exorcism. I told him that we’d be more likely to get psych evaluations if we try to get help from anyone. Also, on the chance that there was an exorcist on hand, I don’t know what would happen to Mom if someone came in trying to get rid of her “sweet little boy.” She could end up like Colleen and that’s definitely something I want to avoid.

“Then it’s up to us then,” Logan said.

“Pretty much.”

We’ve been taking stalk of what we know. Rowan’s at the center of it all. He hates silver and holy water. His right eye might be a weakness if Mrs. Kinsey’s eye getting stabbed out was any confirmation.

Excuse me while I throw up my meal at that memory.

” There’re like puppets.” I told Logan. “Anyone who has the mark. They pretty much do what he wants.”

“Will I?” Logan asked.

I wasn’t sure what to think about Logan’s mark. It hadn’t been finished. At least not from what I could remember. He’s had it for a few days and hasn’t acted strange. Not as strange as Mom was acting anyway.

Logan poured holy water on the wound often and even wore a cross around his neck. Something I doubt he’d ever worn in his life.

“My mom thinks I’ve found God and she’s wondering why.”

“What do you tell her?”

Logan shrugged. “I’m afraid of demons getting me.”

I wanted to laugh at his honesty.

When I got home Mom was in the Kinsey’s yard. She waved at me and I felt the same déjà vu I’d had with Colleen. My stomach clenched as I walked up to her. A bottle of holy water in my backpack and a silver spoon in my pocket.

Mom smiled.

“Hi, Miles.”

It sounded like her. God, did it sound like Mom. But I could tell from the way she smiled so forcefully that it wasn’t her. Not entirely.

“Hi, Mom.”

“You want to see Rowan?”

I didn’t know what to say. I just stared and shook my head.

“You sure? I think you’d get along with him.”

“I doubt that.”

Mom tilted her head. It wasn’t the normal head tilt. It was so quick that I expected her neck to break when she did it. I could see her left eye turn blue. I put my hand in my pocket wondering if it was possible to scoop out my mom’s eye with it and whether I could even stomach it.

“Oh, Miles.” She was giving a bright tooth grin. “Why do you act this way?”

“Probably because I’m your kid.”

The waves were crashing behind me as I said it. The smell of seaweed wafted up as Mom tilted her head back so it was centered again.

“You are, Miles.” I could hear something in her voice. Regret maybe. “You are my child. Maybe you’d like a brother? Huh? Would you like a sibling?”

I knew where this was going as the door opened. Rowan’s smiling face popped out. I took the spoon out of my pocket along with the bottle of holy water from my bag.

“Play, Miles. Play with me.” The child laughed.

I gave him the angriest look I could give. He was playing with me alright. Using my mom as a shield. Rowan gave another laugh as he tossed something in his hand. I thought it was a ball. He threw it out onto the grass. I wished I’d turned away instead of staring at it.

On the grass, near where my mom was standing, was an eyeball. It was too decomposed to tell whose it could’ve been. The iris was completely devoid of color having become milky white. The blood veins were hemorrhaged forming small red dots in places.

“Bring it back. Bring it back. Bring it back.” Rowan was chanting. His hands in small fists as he bobbed his upper half in excitement.

“I got it, sweetie,” Mom said.

I clenched my mouth to keep down any vomit that might’ve come up as my mom picked up the eyeball delicately like it was a Lego piece. Rowan gave a bright smile as he was handed it and started to squeeze it in his hand.

“So fun!” He looked at me again. Mom standing right next to him.

“I’m gonna end you, you fucking freak,” I said.

I ran back to the house before Mom could start chasing me away. Rowan was giggling the entire time. I could still hear him giggling when I locked the door behind me. I put my back against the door and started to cry. I know that’s not something I should admit but I did. I don’t know what else I could’ve done. I’m at my wits end with this. My mom’s now that thing’s babysitter, it’s caretaker, it’s puppet.

Dad and Mom were arguing again that night. I listened in for a little. My dad has been giving in more often to my mom despite me telling him that this isn’t healthy for her. I don’t think Dad knows how to handle any of this. He told my mom that she should consider what quitting her job would mean not just for her but for us. Mr. Kinsey might be paying her nice for now but he only has so much in whatever retirement savings he has.

“Then maybe we should have Rowan live with us.”

“Are you joking?” Dad asked. I almost yelled the same thing from my room.

“I think we should consider it. He’s a sweet boy.”

“That’s a huge responsibility.” Dad countered.

I looked back at my window to see the Kinsey House. The light was on in the living room. The curtains closed. Mr. Kinsey’s car was back in the driveway. The child was in there plotting something.

I pictured Tinsdale with all its rusted mailboxes and decrepit gravestones. Ample might have its fair share of ghosts but I didn’t want it to become a ghost town no matter how much I hated the place.

“I think you should get to know him and think on it,” I heard Mom say. “His birthday is going to be next month. He’s gonna be six. Six! Can you believe that?”

I wondered how long the child had been six for. The locket had shown 1949. But even that didn’t feel right. I could believe he was much older. Maybe centuries. A parasite that leeched on families for decades until they started to decay and fall apart. Just like Tinsdale. Probably just like a bunch of other abandoned towns.

Dad sighed. “We still have a kid, hone. Have you forgotten him?”

Mom gave a laugh. It made my heart sink to hear it. I opened the door a crack to hear better.

“Miles can take care of himself. He’s a young man. He’ll be out of here as soon as he gets the chance.”

I felt conflicted about what Mom said. I had always wanted my parents to be a little more hands off. Sometimes their love…it could feel suffocating. Maybe that’s part of the reason I’ve always wanted to get out. To get away from them. But that wasn’t my mom saying that. The child wanted me gone so he could have two new hosts to take care of him. To be his playthings.

I didn’t want my parents to end up like that. They don’t deserve to be some monster’s toys. None of us do.

Dad said that it sounded wrong. That he expected better of her. Mom told Dad he was being selfish. Dad told Mom that she should look in the mirror. It started to go downhill from there and Mom ended the conversation by stomping to their bedroom. I closed the door quietly as she went by my room. My parent’s bedroom door slamming behind her.

I listened while my dad opened the refrigerator, most likely to grab a drink. I could hear the door leading to the garage open and shut. It was quiet in the house again. I kept listening for anything else. There was no sound. I looked at a knife and spoon at my feet. I was about to call it a night and try to continue planning some way out of this demon-possessed nightmare that my family was in.

That was until I started to hear the murmuring. I couldn’t make it out at first. It was like childish whispers coming from my parent’s room. I thought Rowan was in the house. That he’d snuck in and was preparing to takeover my dad or me or both of us. I wasn’t going to let that happen. Not without a fight. I grabbed a knife from the floor and silently walked to my parent’s room. Ignoring the pain in my right arm and the aches coming from the bruises all over my body.

I leaned my ear against the door and could hear Mom talking.

“Millie,” she said playfully.

I felt my palms sweat. She was saying my name. A nickname she hadn’t used since I was a child.

“What a good boy, Millie. Such a sweet boy.”

I didn’t move. She could see me. Somehow, she could see me on the other side of the door. It must’ve been the eye. The one that could change color.

“It’s gonna be your birthday soon, hone. We’re gonna have a big birthday for you.”

I started to get confused when she said that. My birthday wasn’t happening anytime soon. I opened the door slightly. Mom was sitting on the bed. Her back straight up as she stared at the wall. The wall that faced the Kinsey House. Her left hand was over her left eye. She kept talking.

“You’re gonna be a big boy soon and everyone is going to love you, Millie.”

I knew who she was talking to and it wasn’t me. Rowan wasn’t in the room. Not physically. He was speaking to my mom through the eye.

“None of the other kids are like you, hone,” she said in an encouraging tone. “None of them. You’re a special boy. The only special boy.”

Her head started to turn. I wanted to call for Dad. He needed to see her like this. He needed to know. I tried looking for my phone but Mom’s head faced me. She was turned to me but I don’t think she saw me. The eye she didn’t cover was looking above my head. Her face was grinning.

“You’re the only special boy. The only special boy.”

I backed out of the room.

I need to end this. This has to end.
