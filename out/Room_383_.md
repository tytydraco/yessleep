After my mom suffered an awful neck injury from a car crash, she got admitted to the ER right away. 

After checking her out and putting her on pain meds, the hospital decided that it be ok for her to be in a shared room with someone but be monitored a lot since of the situation with her neck.

My mother Rose has always been there for me and has always been my morning sunshine, I love her with all my heart, and seeing her in that condition, eyes shut, neck in a brace, groaning out softly in agony, it made me…well it was very hard to see.

This car crash was 4 days ago and what caused it was a damn drunk driver. A middle aged man wasted. My mother waiting at a red light and while she was waiting, the drunk driver was speeding in at 50 mph, and rear ending my mother, causing her to get severe whiplash ending up into the neck injury.

She is very lucky and I am very grateful that she even survived such a crash. The drunk driver was of course arrested and survived the accident with a minor scratch on his arm from glass shards flying at him. While the cops loaded him into the cop car he couldn’t even say his own name, that’s how wasted he was.

The hospital is only about a 10 minute drive away, which is very nice since I don’t have to drive too far in case of a severe emergency with her. I will admit though, since the crash, I have always been very shaky when driving, thinking that every sudden move well result me in a car crash, basically I have ptsd from something that didn’t even happen to me.


Anyways, the weird stuff happened when I arrived at the hospital. Going to her room 383, I saw her this time and something was off with her face. I know that she had just survived a brutal car crash and her neck got fucked up, but this was… this was weird.

Her mouth was wide open and her face was droopy, eyes wide open, just staring into space. “Hi momma.” I said. I guess I had jump-scared her because she let out a startled noise and looked at me. She was mumbling something I couldn’t understand but I was thinking she was saying something along the lines of, “hi honey” or something like that. 

But then suddenly she just dead lock stared at me. Eyes droopy now like a melted candle wax. “Mother, I’m sorry about all this.” I said getting emotional. She then starts to scream out as I begin to get closer to her to give her a hug and kiss.

Then the nurse comes in, she tells me that my mother is just disoriented right now and that the car crash caused a massive affect on her memory and ability to think. So that’s why she was looking at me in a weird way. But why would she be screaming, “maybe she just assumed I was someone else and didn’t recognise me because of how shaken up she is.” I thought to myself.

Still it was a little weird for her to have such another effect happen since I just thought it was on her neck not her head. Well must have hit her head very hard when she leaned forward in the whiplash all of a sudden. 

“Well, I think I must just stay the night.” I thought to myself. “Even if she doesn’t recognise me, I still have to be there for her, I have been there before obviously, but I think I should stay one night just for the morality of it all, and she is my mother after all.” 

“Nurse, ma’am. You can allow for family members to stay the night here, right?” She looked at my mother for a second and looked back at me. “Um…” a little pause in between, “oh yeah, of course sir.” 

“Ok thanks ma’am, I really appreciate it.” I respond back.

Mother got her dinner, plain old hospital food but had to be fed it, so I fed it to her in scoops one at a time, it took a while since she kept in spitting it out. Even one time she began to start to puke on me, that wasn’t the most fun thing.

Stepping out of the room, I go and tell the front desk by my mom’s room, that I am gonna wash my shirt off real quick, since it has puke on it.

With a wet, but clean shirt, I head back to room 383, which was a cool number to me. Anyways, as I head back, I walk in the door and I see the nurse, on my mothers bed, knees beside her stomach, like she was sitting on top of my mother, just looking down at her, staring.

“What the hell are you doing?!” I scream out very weirded out by this. “Sir it’s ok” she responds. “Rose here was acting all aggressive and tried to punch at me. So I had to hold her down somehow.”

The nurse could have been right, since my mom could still move her arms and legs, which again is a miracle knowing the severity of the accident that happened. But I just found it kinda odd, like staring down at her, without saying anything at all. “Like what the actual fuck.”

Obviously weirded out by this but pretending to believe what the nurse meant just to not cause any trouble, I simply say, “ok thank you ma’am, I am sorry for yelling at you, I didn’t mean it, I was just confused that’s all, thank you for clarifying and explaining.”

“Of course sir, you are very welcome and it is totally ok, a lot of people do that here in this graveyard, I meant hospital.” She let out a laugh after this like it was a joke she was making or something. With an awkward laugh I respond back. “The fuck kinda fucked up joke is that, especially from a nurse. Ironic as hell that’s for sure.” The nurse walks out the room closing the door. 

Setting up my bed on a little couch in the corner of room 383, I lay my body down, and wish my mom good night. 

“Anyways, mom I love you. Get good rest and I promise it will get better.” I tell her as I shut my eyes.

Falling asleep at that hospital was one of the fastest times I have ever fallen asleep before. Usually I move around, the occasional take off and on the blanket, but no this time was close eyes and snap, asleep.

In this asleep state I have a terrible nightmare. In this nightmare my moms body is burning in the car as the drunk man laughs maniacally, all of a sudden the nurse from earlier turns into this alien like creature, with grey scaly skin and pitch black eyes, a longer green tongue, and a smile that was just plain and simply disturbing.

Waking up with gasps in my breath from this nightmare, I pop up on the couch and take a glance at the clock.

“3 AM, of fucking course. What a timing. I wake up from a terrible nightmare. And it’s fucking 3 AM.” I say to myself in my head. 

“Patter, patter.” 

I hear beside my mother’s bed. “The fuck.” I whisper out loud. 

It sounded like a bug crawling around but it was too loud to be a bug. I get my phone on, turn on my flashlight and point it towards the bed. Nothing there. 

Then the door opens. 

“Creak” 

A slow but long and steady creak. Keep in mind that my mother’s asleep during all of this. Pointing my flashlight to the noise, I make out a shadow, blurry since I just woke up and my eyes are adjusting, but visible.

It had a humanoid body and its back had spikes on it. Thinking this is still apart of the dream or I am hallucinating or something from stress or something else, I smack myself, I feel it. I pinch myself, I feel it. I put my finger through my hand but it stops.

“Holy shit, I’m not dreaming. This is real” I say to myself out loud.

The shadow figure must have heard me exclaim this, because it turned around. I noticed one thing though. This thing had breasts, like big breasts. 

“What the fuck is this shit. A wet nightmare or something. The fuck is going on.” I say to myself in a jokingly manner.

The thing begins to crawl on all fours and jump on Rose’s bed. I get the flashlight on it and I notice the face of this thing. It was the nurse. But it had grey fucking skin, and black eyes, and a green tongue sticking out at me, and a smile that is fucking haunting.

My nightmare had predicted the fucking future. “Holy shit, I am supernatural.” I think to myself. 

The nurse than fucking bites my mothers eyes out. One by one. Chews on them and spits them out at me. Next she bites my moms breasts and than her entire face.

The creature nurse thing, then charged at me. Transforming back into the human nurse form, a beautiful woman. Very beautiful woman. But I wasn’t gonna let this thing fool me into thinking it is real.

“Who are you and what do you want?” I yell out.

“I Am Your mother’s grim reaper and I was called from the other side to take her with me.” The creature snarled at me.

“What other side, heaven?” I ask.

“Hahahahahahaha” a laugh so evil and creepy it still makes my soul shake. “No silly, do you think I look like an angel. Your mother is going to… HELL!!! And she will be forever tormented by being placed in Hell cell number 383!”
