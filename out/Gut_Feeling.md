Since I was a young girl I’d always had the worst sense of intuition. I’d be the first person to hop in a white van if they offered me candy, or take a ride home with a total stranger if they said they knew my parents. Despite the odds I somehow avoided ending up on the news, thanks purely to dumb luck. I had so many close calls, only to be rescued at the last minute every time by my saving grace, Jeremy.  He grew up down the street, and while we both grew up in the same affluent city, our families were as dysfunctional as they come.


​It wasn’t until about ten years ago that I started to see Jeremy as more than just a friend. It was my college graduation, and although he had graduated the year prior, he still came to support me. My family was too busy vacationing in Vail to make it, and I was the crazy one for wanting to attend my own graduation. They didn’t see the point since they’d already attended my High School graduation. It wasn’t anything I wasn’t used to from my family, but I struggled with college so it was especially important to me. Against their judgement I paid for it myself, I didn’t want their money to forever put me in their debt, and I swore I’d make a name for myself on my own.


​Jeremy’s parents were total opposites of mine, they showered him with love and affection, and only lived in the town I grew up in because they broke their backs working so he could attend a better public school than the one they grew up in. School may have been free, but living in Lockwood meant high taxes and even higher cost of living. Unlike me, Jeremy had a sibling, Joseph. Joseph was only a year older, but didn’t get all the same opportunities Jeremy did, even with his parents moving. I think I always wrote off Joseph’s impoliteness of being jealous of his brother, but it wasn’t a secret his parents had a preference.


​Joseph was nice enough, but while he wasn’t outwardly rude to me or Jeremy it was obvious that he didn’t like us. It wasn’t until last week when things started to come to a head. I was off to visit Jeremy on Thursday like normal. Typically, he would make dinner for us and we would spend the night enjoying the meal and watching bad movies. 


This time was different though. 


Jeremy prefaced the night by letting me know Joseph was going to be home, but he would most likely be staying in his room. I didn’t have any issue with this, but Jeremy seemed on edge. He said Joseph had been extra strange lately, and he felt like something was up. His parents had gone on a spontaneous weekend getaway and didn’t tell him. I thought that was strange, but it’s also nothing they hadn’t done before. I wrote off his uneasiness as being upset his parents told his brother instead of him and started to get ready for our evening together. Most of the time he came to my house to cook meals, so I was excited for the change of pace going to his house instead.


​ When I got to his house I noticed Joseph’s car wasn’t there. It was about time he went out with friends instead of sulking in his room as he normally did, but when I walked in everything immediately felt off. The lights were turned off, with romantic, yet creepy, candles lighting the way. While I could smell the food cooking in the oven I could tell that there wasn’t anything that had been prepared aside from that. I started making my way through the house when I came across Jeremy sitting in the living room chair usually reserved for his father.

​“Hi Janie, I’m so glad you could make it.”
His voice seemed breathy and labored and there was a smell I couldn’t place emanating from his direction.

“Hey honey, looks like we have the house to ourselves tonight!”
He turned around, the large armchair seeming almost too small for his body.

“Joseph went out to get me some medicine, I’m not feeling so great.”

“Oh, I’m sorry to hear that baby, what’s wrong? Are you okay? I would’ve picked something up on-“

“No I’m fine, Joseph is going for me. Why don’t we sit down at the table?”

As he said this, even in the darkness I could see his face looked pale and almost uneven. As we moved into the similarly darkened dining room I could tell something wasn’t right; I just couldn’t place it. It was almost like when you watch TV and the voices aren’t synced up right and the actor’s mouths don’t move in line with what they’re saying. Avoiding eye contact as best as I could I finished my dinner quickly and excused myself.


​ I don’t know what it was that night when my “gut” finally decided to kick into action, but it saved me. Something about the whole encounter, as short as it was, felt off. Every red flag that I had ignored before was waving in my face and I couldn’t ignore it. I called the police, not even sure what for, so I asked for a wellness check on Jeremy. The next few days were a blur, but if you’re reading this you can probably assume the worst.


​ Joseph had enough of “not being the favorite” and decided there was only one way to make that happen. He had killed Jeremy hours before I arrived and skinned him, turning his face into some sort of horrifying makeshift mask to present to his parents. It was dark, and while I knew something was wrong, I had no idea the horrible thing I was really seeing in that moment. The police were able to make quick work of arresting him, and when his parents returned home they were of course devastated to find not only one son dead, but the other son the murderer. They never even found Jeremy’s body to properly lay him to rest.


​ Joseph may have been deeply disturbed, but I could never forgive him for what he did, taking the love of my life from me. Even on the last day before he died, Jeremy still seemed so chipper. Completely unaware of the horrible fate he’d be met with mere hours from then. For a while, I found solace in eating the last meal Jeremy made for us. 
   
 Until I realized – he never could have made it to the grocery store. 

Police put his time of death at that morning.
