I'm sure u are all familiar with the baby monkey torture and death videos all over youtube so I will spare u the rundown of that

it was a hot summer day and I had just been eating my 10 scrambled eggs (daily breakfast) and I was on youtube watchign creepy horror stuff, like a cracka do, and I saw video titled "monkey kickflip"

now I was slighlty under the influence of some herbal (been puffing on a H2 Zanzibar Cart, pretty sure it's fake because I don't think 343 licensed these like it says but it taste good and goes hard), as I tend to smoke weed after I workout because it helps with my recovery ðŸ’ª, like a cracka do.

Being under the influence like that, I thought the idea was funny as hell and clicked on the video without watching the little thumbnail reel that plays out if you hover cuz I wasn't really thinking

the video started and at first everything was seeming to be okay, it starts out with the camera facing the monkey on a skateboard stationary from the side like a 2d view, almost like you would see in a skateboarding video (here is a recreation of the starting frame), and there was one of those light ring things behind the monkey pointing in the direction of the wood chipper

you don't see the woodchipper at first, the monkey starts pushing and he actually does a kickflip which looked really cool, it doesn't look edited to me and i want to believe it's real so i think that the monkey really did the kickflip, and then the video just stops on the frame of the skateboard touching the ground

then it starts again and it looks like a new take, the monkey pushes differently this time but still he takes off, but this time after he pushes a few times you see one of those smaller portable woodchippers off to the left of the monkey

it was so fucked up he does the kickflip again but you can tell it was timed so he flies right into the woodchipper and he does, the monkey starts screeching for a second but then you just hear the crunching and the panging of the skateboard trucks and the whole time the camera is panning off to the left like in a skateboarding video and you start seeing a red mist and almost colorless chunks flying out

it was so disgusting and then the video ends with a single image, it's a poorly edited version of the tony hawk's pro skater 4 cover showing the same baby monkey from the video from the very beginning where he's just standing still and it's edited to say "Lalo's Pro Skater 4: Chipped Edition" and it just has a cry laughing emoji as a caption

it was so fucked up I reported and it seems 2 be gone for now but this stuff needs to end

these baby monkey videos are going to far why would u bother teaching him to kickflip just to kill him that probably took so long

someone needs to stop this
