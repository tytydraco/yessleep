Chanell White, Henry Seau, Drey Arelan, Riley Blue, Esmaye Easton, Nick Stone,
Garner Davies, and finally, Onita Anne.


Those were the children that i sat amongst with many years ago. Their smiles, innocent and sweet, cloaked with a private, confidential life that no one in 40 Hendry would see it coming.


I know the children, and they knew me fully well.


And everyone knew Miss Haylinn, she was the teacher that introduced the young children those many years ago with a treasure chest. That day, every child stood around this mesmerising object, small gasps and eyes glimmering at the delicate details of sharks and fishes that were printed on this chest. Miss Haylinn hushed the class, and with a soft smile that crept wider than anyone could imagine, she said,


“This my children is a treasure chest, that we should all treat with respect like we would to each other. Who ever shows me very good behaviour would be rewarded what they desire from this chest at the end of the school year.” 


While every child excitedly jumped around, i peered at the children whose eyes were already lingered on mine, with not eagerness but on the range of lust.


The day passed and Miss Haylinn stood at the centre of the classroom, the colour from her cheeks slowly bled out as her body began trembling, eyes darting from each child as i walked towards my seat.


Miss Haylinn and all the other children realised that the treasure chest that laid near the book corner was gone. 


That was when it all slowly began.


After taking the treasure chest to my home, the word got out that someone had stole it, none of us said a word.


I invited the children to my home and they were all eager to store their treasures, they also wanted to see what was inside this chest.


All of them awkwardly stumbled into my warm home, their hands greeting my parents hands, their eyes looking at each frame that had pictures of me when i was a baby. Then we all went upstairs. The evening drifted slowly as we all sat in my large room.


“When can we see what is in this chest..?” Drey Arelan questioned as his head turned to me.


“In a moment, after supper we can…” i replied coldly as i felt the everyone’s eyes peering at me.


“That is not fair, how can Terrance store the chest in his house, why can’t we store it in mine?…” asked Esmaye Easton. The silence laid deadly against the walls of my home, as i stared into my hands that brushed against the cool metal key which i slipped into my pocket.


“Look, the chest stays in my home, no one says otherwise, let me store our treasures and no one speaks of it.” I sighed gravely as each child frowned back at me.


Esmaye Easton rose upward her face was screwed up, and she excused herself to go to the bathroom. 


Supper was soon i thought as i began conducting a plan just in case we were caught with the treasure chest.


“Follow me.” i signalled the group up, as all of us walked down the long hallway and towards the silver ladder that led up to the attic.

Next to the ladder was the treasure chest. And i had to get it up there.


I had to do whatever it took to get the chest up into the gloomy, dingy attic.


And that is what we did.


One person held the ladder, and two people were up into the attic, all of us lifted the chest which was heavy and awkward to hold. We then placed the chest hidden in the deep corners, near the dreary window.


“Terrance. Do you know what your doing?” 



Before i could answer, the doorbell went, and all of us shuffled down the ladder and into the hallway, the door was unlocked and a soft welcoming was heard as all of us looked down at a figure which we made out was to be Esmaye Easton’s mother.


Before we realised anything, it had been long moments after Esmaye Easton had gone to the bathroom.


The mother had to collect Esmaye Easton and asked us and my mother if we had seen her anywhere, which all of us pointed out where she went.


The creak of the bathroom door slowly swept open and it was empty. No one was inside.



That was when this case began.




This was when all of our lives were lost.




Each child and adult were told that a search couldn’t be conducted unless 24 hours had passed which Esmaye’s mother disagreed, arguing with the fact that nothing like this happened in 40 Hendry.


And she was right, in a town this big but small when you know every person that walks the same streets to school and work, nothing like this ever happened. 


So that was all it took for a search party to conclude. Each child and parent were heavily questioned upon the disappearance of Esmaye Easton. Each home was torn upside down to find any evidence to where she could of went.


And in a matter of months, Esmaye Easton was classified as the missing child of 40 Hendry. Her curly blonde hair and blue eyes, the perfect kid that someone could take for their own. But like i said, no one would do such a thing in this town. Except, whispers and our names were talked around, each men and woman calling us “monsters” and some were saying that “the children who lost their friend, how tragic.” 


Esmaye Easton was a beautiful child but no one seemed to acknowledge her, but now every person on the street knows her name.



The search continued for years and will continue for many years more until Mrs Easton gets her daughter back. My family were quick to blame, all of us sleeping in a house where a good friend of mine was last seen in. Our once rich, good reputation was ruined by the town’s people and years later my parents moved away a couple of blocks down the street of Sherman Avenue away from Woodridge.



I also did the same. I sold the house to a lovely old couple and travelled miles to Parleen High Street. A docile neighbourhood, away from Woodridge and away from the people. 



Now once in a while everyone needs a fresh start, but the one thing you cannot run from is your mindset.



The past will always be there.





And i always thought that nothing would change.




Until that very day.







Ring.



Ring.



Ring.



The rattling of the telephone next to me blared into my ears as i assumed it was to do with my dream and ignored it slightly.




Ring.





Ring.





Ring.



My body tensed as i groggily sat up, wiping the sleep from my eyes and quickly realising that this was not a dream. I let out a sigh and placed my hand upon the telephone.



“H-hello….?” i yawned as i leaned back into my bed, peering at the orange beam settling on my curtains.



Silence.



“Hello….. who’s there…?” Eyes widening as i tried listening to any background noise to work out who was calling.



“M-mr….. M-mr…. I-ide… is that y-you…?” a faint voice spoke into the telephone as i pressed it against my ear, feeling as if i recognised this voice before.



“Mrs… Murrain? I-is everything okay..?” i questioned as i then realised who this voice was.



“Oh…….Oh…Mr Ide… s-something……s-something you have to see…Oh.. dear…” a deep sob and ruffles overcame the speaker as i became alert, my heart racing and mind wondering. 





“Mrs Murrain… What is happening…? Where is Mr Murrain.?” I asked gravely, my hands clenched around the telephone, chest screaming for air as i let out a deep sigh.




“My h-husband is here…b-but you have to come, please…. you have to c-come now…” Mrs Murrain cried as she then put the phone down.


Without slight hesitation, it managed to put on a pair of trousers, white top and shoes. I then jumped into my car and sped off to Woodridge.



Back into Woodridge.



The journey which felt like hours was over as i parked up near my old home, the same unsettling feeling sent chills lingering inside my body as i set one foot infront of the other until i made my way to the door. 


i hesitated.




Knock.


Knock.


Knock.



Silence.



The cold breeze slapped my face whirling around me as i held my hand up to knock again.



Knock. 


Knock.


Creak.




The old wooden door gradually edged to the side as i allowed myself in. The overcasting shadows in the corners of the house seemed as if they had their eyes on me - watching me as i made my way to the set of staircases, hesitating.



Tranquility ingurgitated the house as i switched the lights on, the shadows dying in the corners as i listened for any slight noises.



“Mr and Mrs Murrain..?!.. Are you there?!” i called out. No answer.



I set one foot on the edge of the stairs and climbed up, each step creaking in pain as i finally made my way to the top, peering at each room which was replaced by the couples belongings.


I then turned my head, peering at the now rusty ladder that was propped evenly against the wall, which lead to the attic.


Gulping, i made my way to the ladder - each step i was filled with trepidation as i made my way into the attic.



“Oh…. Oh… M-Mr I—ide…. i dont know what to s-say!!.” Mrs Murrain, pale-faced and shaking embraced me in a hug as i peered at it.



Stood in front of me, was the treasure chest. The same delicate designs of sharks and fishes were printed on it — covered with a blanket of dust. Mr Murrain, was sat in the corner, his eyes filled with alarm and not taking them off the treasure chest.



“C-call the police…. y-you have to call the… p-police…” Mr Murrain uttered, his limp hands pulling out a small phone. That’s when he dialled the number, unaware what was going on i raced to snatch the phone of Mr Murrain.



“WHAT A-ARE YOU DOING??…” I shouted as Mr Murrain got up from his catatonic stance and glared at me.


“W-We have to call the police….” Mr Murrain trembled, as he held the phone tightly in his hands, the monotonous sound of ringing blaring in the background as a wave of fear took the course of my body. My eyes lingering at the treasure chest.


“D-did you look inside…..?” i muttered as my head tilted to Mr Murrain whose face turned pale.



“Hello, 999 what is your emergency—“



i walked towards the chest, ignoring the frantic cries of Mr Murrain — my hands pressed against the smooth design, the chest was slightly open but not enough to put a finger in it. I carefully lifted the chest with all my might as i peered down. 



Silence. 




“Hello there, im Mr Blakey and i am a pathologist, i have the chest ready in the morgue awaiting for identification.” The man said through his tinted glasses as each of us exchanged looks of concern.


I was instantly reunited with the same children from 18 years ago, who were now adults. After the incident with the Murrain’s the chest was taken to the morgue that same evening to be examined. The night dragged on but i managed to contact the others, hoping for closure and comfort.



I couldn’t move. None of us could. I mean how can you after all those restless years of waiting for some type of answer to what happened to Esmaye Easton. How can a child just vanish from the face of the earth.



The man was standing next to the large white table, which had the chest laid on.


All of us walked forward, the aching fear transfixed inside of all of us as each of us one by one looked inside the chest.


Everyone exchanged deep gasps of dread as the quickly moved from the chest.



As i peered down. There it was.




The chest laid these sickly pale bones of what appeared to look like a person’s body.



All crammed up together.



The crisp fear tightened around me as i moved away from the table. The man stood there, glaring back at us. He then departed from the large table and walked to his desk which he took pieces of paper from.



“When looking in the chest that you gave me, i’ve noticed something peculiar about it.. has this chest ever had a key.?” The man queried as i peered up to him, biting my bottom lip.


“The key went missing the day i-i found it, so i couldn’t open the chest..” i mumbled back as he frowned then walked towards the chest that was on another table.


“Well, this chest cannot be opened without the key, anyone who im using as an example… wanted to lay inside this box, the chest has to be locked with the key..”  The man added as all of us looked at each other.


“This child, has been purposely locked from the outside with the key.. — well that’s what i believe” The man then placed the paper on the table, he then looked at us with a face of grim.


“Now we have checked the bones of this body, and it belongs to a child that we do not know, and it also doesn’t belong to any child in this town.”




“We have found another thing…. Now i will warn you what i am about to show you is quite graphic… anyone who wish to step out the room you may..” He announced as we all exchanged looks of confusion.



The room went quiet. We all stood there, glaring at the man who carefully lifted something.



Something i wish to never see again.




A small unsaturated greyish heart.



No blood, the crimped heart. Dead. The chilling silence ate us, alive as my eyes fixated on it.


Nothing escaped. No words. No screaming. Just nothing. 


Dysphoria engulfed my brain.


No one moved. Everyone was catatonic.


Silence.



The man placed the heart on the table, he then cleared his throat and gazed at us for a while, then spoke. 



“We ran DNA tests of the heart, and we believe that this heart, belongs to Esmaye Easton.”
