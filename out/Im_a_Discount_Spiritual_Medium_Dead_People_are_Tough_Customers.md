The woman in front of me was in tears, sobbing as I clutched her cold, clammy hands from across the table.  She looked desperate, and it was my job to help her.  After all, she had paid the twelve dollars cash, up front.

"Harold Myers, we call you forth from the other side, to speak to you.  Hear our voices and heed our cries."

A sad wailing noise began to emit from hidden speakers all around the room.  The hydraulic table started to lift and turn slightly, as if one side had just begun to float.  If the woman got down on her hands and knees, she might see the movement beneath the table leg, making it rise.  But nobody had ever done that before.  At least, not so far.

I cleared my throat, giving an irritated glare up at the camera mounted in the corner of the room.  The loud wailing began to dissipate, as my partner turned the volume of the recording down slightly so I could be heard.

"Your wife is here, Harold.  She wants to see you one last time, to hear your voice."

This is where it always got a little weird.

See, the thing is, I'm a REAL medium.  I can actually see dead people, just like that little kid in that movie.  But the problem is, nobody wants to hear what the dead are saying.  That shit is way too depressing.

Suddenly there was a man standing in front of me, his face half-eaten by worms.  Nightcrawlers and spiders skittered out from his mouth as he spoke, spilling grave soil on my fresh carpeting.  I tried not to flinch backwards in sheer terror, but it was difficult.  After a few seconds I was able to put on my small fake smile again and could speak.  But those worms crawling out of his nostrils made it difficult to concentrate.  I kept trying to decide if there were two of them, or just one long one that was kinda stuck up there, like a slimy, wriggling septum piercing.

"What the fuck do you want, bitch?  I killed myself to get away from you."

I paused for a second, trying not to cringe, and instead to reflect just the right amount of gravitas and spiritual piousness.

"What do you need, my love?  I am at peace on the other side, but if you need me, I am here for you," I said, trying to impersonate the dead man's gravelly voice as best I could.

"Dude, what the fuck?" Harold said, looking irritated.  "No ad-libs, asshole, I know you can hear me.  And that’s not what I sound like."

I held up my hand to the woman, as if taking a second to receive the next transmission.  The whole time I tried to give off the vibe of someone being electrocuted with a very low voltage, my body shaking and eyelids flickering open and closed.  I began to speak again, slowly, as if with a great effort to stay composed.

"I can't wait to see you again one day.  The worst part of being dead is not being able to gaze upon your beautiful face each morning," I let my voice waver, rising and falling as if the transmission from the netherworld were fading in and out.

"Really!? Oh, Harold! I knew you loved me.  I just wish I could take it all back!  Everything I said, I didn't mean it!"

Harold spat out a cockroach and looked at me with murder in his eyes.

"You tell that bitch I'm haunting her ass for cheating on me.  Every night while she sleeps I'm casting a bad juju on her…  And I'm gonna spit in her mouth," he added, as an afterthought.

"OOoooh, the transmission is faaaading…  I have to go now, Darcy.  But I want you to know how much I love you.  You mean the world to me, my dear."

She burst into tears and stood to give me a hug.  I'd see a big tip out of this one.  But Harold would likely come visit me tonight to give me a good scare.  I'd have to hang up extra sage.  Ghosts fucking hate that shit.

Darcy left a little while later.  She had a glow about her, and would go on to tell her friends and family about my work.  If I was lucky, maybe I would get a referral or two out of it.

Another crying widow, another bloodless husband spilling grave soil on my new carpeting.  I got out the DustBuster and started to vacuum up the brownish black muck.  A few errant worms disappeared into the vacuum as well.  Nobody else could see them but me.  When I went to empty the dirt into the garbage, there was nothing inside the DustBuster except some lint and hair.  That happens sometimes.

For a long time I worried I was crazy, until I figured out how to make a buck out of my ability to see the dead.  By this point, I've pretty much gotten used to it.  Although sometimes the spirits catch me off guard.

The main problem with the dead is that they are never happy to be dead.  They always have unfinished business, especially nowadays, since we've all gotten so good at procrastination with the advent of social media and everything else designed to sap our time, memory and brain power.  Unfulfilled wishes mean the dead are gonna stick around until those issues are dealt with.  And unfortunately most people’s kids are just as overworked and distracted as their parents, so the unfinished business never gets finished, and the world fills up with more and more dissatisfied ghosts.  At this point they’re everywhere.

"Good job, dude," Sam said as I emerged from the seance room.  He gave me a brisk high five.  "Ten dollar tip!  Man, she really bought it."

Sam had been my best friend since elementary school, and he was the only one who knew about my special skills.  He was also the one who had come up with the ill-conceived notion of exploiting my powers for financial gain.  I tried to explain why that was a bad idea, but all he could see were dollar signs.  Eventually I relented, mostly because my unemployment ran out and job prospects in town are slim to nil.

"Yeah, we sure fooled her.  Listen, can you cut the wailing noises down to maybe fifty percent next time?  I swear, I'm starting to get hearing damage."

"We talked about this!  I'm the special effects expert, remember?  We need the decibel level to be high or the effect will be ruined.  Trust me, I know what I'm doing."

"You take one film class at community college and suddenly you're an expert?  Just a notch, okay?  I swear my ears are gonna start bleeding from that Halloween tape.  And make sure you rewind it this time, I don't think I'll be able to explain if it starts playing Monster Mash again."

"Oh, right!  I'm on it," Sam said, clearly having forgotten.

He ran into the back room and I followed after him.

"Listen, I think I'm gonna duck out early and go see my dad.  We're not getting any more customers today anyways," I said, feeling a bit rattled after my encounter with Harold.

"No can do.  There's a Mark in the waiting room, you gotta do your thing."

"Can you please stop calling them that?"

"No, I mean his name is literally Mark Jacobson.  He's got a half hour booked with you for a palm reading and seance."

"Palm reading?  Since when do we even offer that?  I've never done palm reading before in my life!  I don't know what the hell I'm doing!"

"You really need to start reading my emails.  I sent you something last night about this.  I'm pretty sure I did, anyways."

"Alright, just send him in.  But don't book any more appointments for this shit, I'm not a palm-reader!  I'm a medium!  I see dead people!  Do you have any idea how fucking traumatizing that is?  To see dead people all day long, day in, day out, and be forced to blatantly ignore their messages?  Because it's not fun, man.  And twelve bucks a head ain't cutting it anymore.  We need to raise prices."

"Hence the palm reading.  Listen, just read that email I probably sent you.  Go in there and sit down and put on your Spirit Daddy face.  Tell them they have good life lines and that the crest of their palm indicates newfound wealth coming from a source which you can’t clearly see just yet, but could after six to ten more visits.  Okay, now hurry, it's almost five thirty.  We gotta get him in and out before closing time so I don't miss the start of the baseball game."

I exhaled as loudly and dramatically as I could and eventually marched back into the seance room with my arms dangling limply at my sides, shuffling with each step like an exhausted teenager.  Sitting back down at the table, I wondered not for the first time what the fuck I had been thinking getting into this line of work.  Not to mention my choice of business partner.

The door to the seance room must have opened and closed without me noticing, because when I looked up there was a man sitting down in front of me.  I tried not to show my surprise, but obviously failed, because he quickly held up his hands as if to apologize.

“My apologies, I can be a bit sneaky sometimes, I’ve been told.  It must be a product of my profession.  My name is Mark Jacobson.  There’s something very important I need to ask my former business partner and…  Well, I hear you’re the best.”

I ignored the urge to stand up to greet the man more appropriately, and stayed where I was, sitting across the table from him.  Given the circumstances, it seemed best to just dive right into it.

“You have come to speak to one who has crossed over?” I asked.

“I have.  But first, I was told there would be a complimentary palm reading?”

Sam.  You son of a bitch.

\*

After an awkward first attempt at palm reading that ended with Mark Jacobson sighing in frustration and retracting his hand from my grip with a scowl on his face, I tried my best to regain my composure.

“Sorry, I’m new to palm-reading,” I admitted.  “But speaking to the dead - that is my bread and butter.  Now, please tell me who you wish to contact.  It may take a moment to locate their spirit and bring them here.  Try to think of a fond memory or an image that brings you great joy which you associate with this person, and then tell me their name.”

I wasn’t sure if this last part actually did anything, but it helped make the customer feel more involved.

“My partner, Leonard Fleming,” the man announced.  His eyes were closed as if he knew the routine already.  I wondered if I was not the first medium he had met with.

“Yes, I can feel him being drawn to us already.  He wishes to speak to you about a matter of great import.  Take my hands and say his name again, but this time I want you to ask him to join us here.  Say it three times.  ‘Leonard Fleming, join us here.’”

The man did as I asked without hesitation, and I again had the impression that he’d done this before.  And more than once.  Whatever this man wanted to talk to the dead guy about, it was important.  I could feel it.

I took a deep breath and began my act.

“Leonard Fleming, we call you forth from the other side, to speak to you.  Hear our voices and heed our cries."

For a few long moments we both sat there in silence.  I looked around the room as covertly as I could as the wailing sound began to emit from the hidden speakers and the table started to rise gently beneath our hands.

Rather than being alarmed by this, Mark Jacobson looked plainly annoyed by it.  He scrunched his brow in frustration, as if put off by this sudden intrusion of noise and table levitation.  His gaze drifted down to the pneumatic table leg, and he rolled his eyes as if he’d seen it all a thousand times before.

I felt him starting to pull his hands away, as if ready to get up and leave.  Instead of letting him go, I gripped his hands more firmly, pulling him in toward me.

“My partner has a penchant for theatrics,” I whispered.  “Trust me.  I can do this.”

He relaxed a bit and I took a moment to let go of one of his hands and made a gesture to the camera to cut the effects.  We’d come up with the hidden signal at my insistence, after the “Monster Mash” incident.

The music and sound effects dissipated and the table dropped softly back down to the floor.

I tried to make contact again, reaching out a little more forcefully this time.

"Leonard Fleming, we call you forth from the other side, to speak to you.  Hear our voices and heed our cries.  Answer us, please.  We need to speak to you."

I felt something reaching out to make contact.  It was weak at first, fading in and out.  Whatever it was felt like it was a great distance away, a projection of a projection of a projection.

Finally, a man's image began to flicker in front of me.  Fading in and out like a broken television signal.

"He's here," I said, having completely abandoned my usual routine.  "Something's wrong.  I don't know how much time we have.  What do you need to ask?"

The man hesitated, as if trying to get a read on me.

"I don't feel anything.  Are you sure?"

"Yes," I replied, trying to maintain the signal.  "Hurry.  Ask what you need to ask. He will hear your question and give an answer."

Mark Jacobson let out a sigh and asked his question.  It was not the typical sort of question, either.  I decided again that this was not a typical seance.  Something about this was very different from anything I had done before.  The image of the dead man in front of me was almost invisible, not anything like my usual sightings which were vivid and so real I could smell the decay coming off the rotting corpses.  This man looked like he was… still alive.

“Samuel Jackson,” the man said, his voice fading in and out, barely audible.

“That can’t be right,” I muttered out loud.  In that instant my concentration was lost and the vision of the dead man was gone.  I let go of Mark Jacobson’s hands and looked up at his confused and anxious face.

“What?  What did he say?  Did he give you a name?”

“Yeah, but it…  I mean, I guess it’s a pretty common name.  He said Samuel Jackson.  Does that make sense?”

As soon as the words escaped my lips his eyebrows went up in surprise.

“No.  No, that can’t be right.  If it is then that means…”

He looked genuinely terrified.  Maybe this wasn’t about a Snakes on a Plane sequel, after all.

“Are you absolutely certain that’s what he said?  Are you positive?”

“Yeah.  I mean, the signal was going in and out really bad, like nothing I’ve ever seen before.  But that part came through clearly.  He definitely said Samuel El…  Jackson.”

I tried to stop myself from adding the “L” to the middle of the name and only partially succeeded.

“Samuel Jackson,” I corrected myself.  “Sorry, force of habit.  The man is an icon.”

“Right.  True enough.  But if this is correct…  I’m sorry, I need to go.  Right now.  Thank you for your services, you have been EXTREMELY helpful, although this was not the answer I was looking for, it is AN answer to a question which we, which I, have been very curious to know the answer to,” the man rambled, getting to his feet and heading towards the door of the seance room looking like he had seen the ghost and not me.

“Great!  Don’t forget to tell your friends and receive twenty-five percent off your next visit!”

That was all I managed to get out before the door slammed shut in my face and the man was gone.  He didn’t even leave a tip.

“Damn, dude.  What the hell did you say to that guy?  He didn’t even leave us the customary ten percent that I usually manage to squeeze out of cheapskates.  Just bolted out of here like he saw a…”

“Don’t say it.”

“Ghost.”

“He didn’t see a ghost.  I did.  And I told him the truth.  I told him what the dead guy said.”

“What!?  Why!?  We’ve been over this, man.  The dead don’t have anything useful to say.  It’s all anger and hate and unfulfilled wishes, you said so yourself.”

“Well, this guy actually had something to say.  Something useful.  And I got the feeling Mr. Jacobson had been to a bunch of different mediums before he came to see us.  The guy saw right through your little special effects show.”

“Of course he did!  I told you the wailing noises need to be louder!  I reduced them by ten percent just to show you how much it impacts the overall experience.  Now I have to reconfigure everything again,” he said, as if this didn’t just mean turning a volume dial from nine to ten.

“No, it had nothing to do with that.  Something about this guy was different.  The whole thing was weird.  It was like he knew all our tricks and just wanted a straight reading.  He even picked up on the pneumatic table leg - I saw him roll his eyes when he noticed it.  He’s a pro.”

This managed to stop Sam in his tracks.  He looked me in the eyes as if actually hearing me for the first time.

“So, what did he want?”

“Something about a betrayal.  He asked the dead guy who ‘the betrayer’ was.  It felt all ‘Game of Thrones’ in there for a minute.  That was when the dead guy said the name.  It seemed important, so I told him what he said.”

“Man, what the hell did you do that for?  We don’t know what we’re getting into now.  This could be some secret agent shit.  CIA, FBI, NSA - we don’t have a clue who these guys are.  You might have just doxxed an American spy in North Korea who has been tasked with protecting our freedom from threats domestic and abroad!”

“Have you been watching Homeland again?  Man, only the first season or two were any good.”

“How many times do I have to tell you, it picks up again later on.  You just need to give it another shot.”

“I highly doubt that.”

“And besides, you’re missing the overall point I’m trying to make.  This is dangerous.  The dead are dead for a reason and you’re not supposed to be able to see them.  Just because you can doesn’t mean you need to be telling people what they say.  It could bring about armageddon, or the zombie apocalypse, or worse, it could put us out of business!”

“I don’t think that would be worse than the end of the world, but point taken.  Now come on, let’s close up shop.  You’re gonna miss the start of the baseball game and I’m gonna miss dinnertime with dear old dad.  We’ll talk about this more tomorrow.”

He was already putting on his coat, despite recent talk of potentially causing armageddon.

“And Sam,” I said as he was heading out the door.  “No more palm readings.”

“Got it, boss.  Whatever you say,” he mumbled as he walked out the door, clearly not having heard a word of what I just said.  “Have a good night, see you tomorrow!”

Neither one of us had any idea what the next day would hold, despite my psychic abilities I was no good at telling the future.

If I’d been able to tell, though, I would have stayed in bed.  It was going to be a very, very bad day.

Even worse than usual.
