I don't know what's happening..

Yesterday was a normal day, I woke up,ate breakfast,went to work,came home and ate dinner.
But today is different when I woke up,it was silent.

Dead silent.i could only hear myself,which was odd because normally this is the time when I hear my three kids (sophie,jack,and Lila) hustling around grabbing their stuff in hopes not to miss the bus.
But no,their backpacks and lunches were still neatly arranged on the countertop from last night. I didn't mind,Jamie (my wife) could easily drive them to school.i drove off to work at 8:50 am but what was odd?

No.cars. Once I got to work, nobody was there,I checked my favorite subreddits-0 online,
My favorite YouTube videos-0 watching. It was like everyone disappeared overnight.i don't know why im writing this, it's not like anyone is going to see this unless everyone is trapped somewhere 


I walked around a bit,trying to find any form of life besides plants.
This was my goal list
•find a human
•talk about where everyone is
•go search for more people
•be the hero of your planet
Yeah I know, not exactly realistic goals but when your panicking you really just can't think, ah what am I saying nobody can read this but if you can could you please tell me where everyone is?

Everyone's cars are still neatly arranged and tidy in the parking garage and I am currently walking around trying to find everyone all by myself,I hear a dog barking but I know it's not real, it's like every form of life got invited to a big party in a different dimension but I missed the invitation, maybe it's a surprise party for me, but all 8.2 billion people on earth?
No.
I continue walking but after a moment I heard a noise-ÆEEE a loud eardrum-bursting screeech, I looked to the edge of the street,a tall-what looked to be 10 ft tall black figure-humanoid,no face,
I ran so fast,I thought it gonna chase after me like in the movies but no it just stood there,I slowly approached it.
It let out a low gutteral growl before lunging out at me and getting on all fours, it chased me for about 3 blocks before I got to the nearest school,I locked myself in.

I heard a bunch of banging then it stopped, CRASH, that should be enough warning for anyone but no,I am resilient enough to stay where I am,but this thing-hell it was a cheetah I ran so fast I thought my legs would fall off, I found some food scraps in the cafeteria, throwing them at it, all I could see were dark beady eyes and teeth-too many teeth.it ate the food and then went to sleep luckily I had enough time to find a bike and trek to the next state over,Delaware. See I know its not that far of a stretch but hey I'm getting somewhere 

Nevermind-ive been here for about 7 minutes and the rotting putrid smell just hit me,smelling like a mixture of death,garbage and dog poop.i looked to my left-a giant pit full of rotting animals-assuming they came from the delaware area, i ran as fast as i could back to PA picking up a bike along the way.
Once i made it back i stopped for a moment, looking around, looking back i saw a more tattered version of my wife standing infront of my bike, she took a step closer “oh there you are honey“ she said in a scratchy voice. She was grinning like usual but her grin was wider-too wide and the way she walked-crippled, uncanny. I peddled as fast as i could and my legs felt like they were gonna fall off,but hey it was worth it-i ran her over and ~~she~~ it* is gone.

The day is ending and i found my way into an old hotel in my hometown-i just hope i make it through the night and ill post an update soon
