It's a shared understanding that when you venture into the heart of Gotland's natural world, you must be vigilant and show reverence to the unseen forces that dwell there. In this land of misty mornings, ancient forests, and a vast expanse of sea, the boundaries between the ordinary and the extraordinary are ever so thin, and it's best to tread carefully, acknowledging the enigmatic forces that may, on occasion, reveal themselves to those who are attuned to the island's secrets.

Gotland, nestled in the Baltic Sea, is a place of breathtaking beauty and enchantment. The island's coastline is adorned with rugged cliffs that meet the gentle caress of the sea, creating a harmonious dance between land and water. Gotland is not just an island; it's my home. I grew up here, becoming accustomed to the countless tourists, the changing seasons, and the harsh winds of winter. During the summers, my home island becomes inundated with intoxicating tourists from other parts of Sweden. They arrive by boat, flight, and car. For five weeks, I typically escape to the part of the forests where no one else ventures.

Ancient forests blanket the heart of Gotland, their towering trees standing sentinel over the island's rich history. These woods have borne witness to countless generations, their gnarled branches whispering secrets of centuries gone by. Moss-covered stones, hidden within the depths of the woods, mark the footprints of ancient civilizations, leaving a profound sense of mystique in their wake.Misty mornings are a common occurrence in Sweden, and Gotland is no exception. As the first light of dawn filters through the thick canopy of trees, a mystical veil of mist envelops the landscape, blurring the boundaries between reality and dreams. This ethereal mist weaves tales of mystery and intrigue, as if the island itself guards its secrets in the early hours, sharing them only with those who dare to wander its secluded paths.Even though it was summer, misty valleys still lingered. Midsummer was just around the corner, and the endless lines of tourists had already begun to arrive. I wanted no part of that. I lived in an apartment in Visby, the main city of Gotland, and I knew it was only a matter of hours before the town would be engulfed by tourists. So, I sought refuge in the wilderness, a place where tourists and locals were scarce. I brought along some lightweight camping equipment. I didn't plan on staying overnight in the forest, but one can never be too careful. I packed water, food, a flashlight, a pocketknife, and an old-school compass. As I said, you can never be too cautious. Gotland's warm climate with dry springs and summers resulted in a highly inflammable landscape, so I had to ensure I didn't bring anything that could start a fire.

The pine forest in the northern part of Gotland is characterized as sparse, twisted, and slow-growing. This made it appear somewhat mysterious and enchanting. Its dark green foliage, combined with the thick bark of the trees and the minimal sunlight that penetrated the canopy, gave it a murky, dense, and almost dark ambiance. In other words, it was perfect for a solitary adventure. 

I found the trail and ventured inside, the path curving and steep. Dried pine needles crunched comfortably under my sturdy hiking boots, and the forest emitted soothing sounds. The wind whispered through the trees, birds chirped softly, and the trees creaked ever so gently. It was the ideal escape from the city.After a few hours, I had ventured deep into the forest. Even though I was alone, I could still detect traces of human presence - forest clearings and old cairns constructed by past generations. In my peripheral vision, I caught sight of a particular cairn that appeared to have been disturbed. The moss was displaced, and the stones seemed to have been taken from other cairns. I noticed an open trail of these peculiar cairns and decided to follow them. At the end of an old pathway, I found a disassembled cairn. I surmised that some of the stones had been taken from here. It struck me as strange that someone would intentionally move these stones, especially since we no longer use cairns to mark territory, and each stone easily weighed around 10 to 20 kilograms. Intrigued and slightly unsettled, I chose to continue along the path.

After a good half-hour, I stumbled upon an ancient stone structure. It was a stretch to call it a house, but what remained were the remnants of an old dwelling - hefty gray boulders that had been engulfed and reclaimed by the forest. I've always been skeptical of the supernatural, but it was eerie and a bit unsettling, almost forced. I sat down to observe it and contemplate for a moment while catching my breath. I hadn't noticed it beforehand, the surroundings had a few decayed tree stumps; the edges of the stumps looked like someone had been regretting their decision to cut them down and only used the smallest amount of effort. A sudden chill ran down my back; mist was beginning to fill the low points of the forest, and the rays of light were falling lower, casting an ethereal glow on the decaying stumps. At this point, I was starting to get deeply unsettled, and the pulsating life of a town wasn't so uninviting anymore. The sun in Swedish summer stands high in the sky long into the evenings, but in the thickness of a forest, it’s difficult for the rays to penetrate the growth, making it appear darker than it should be. In this, I boosted my headlamp and adjusted the light so it could guide my way back; I just needed to follow the cairns back to the path.

Now, if you don't know, it's relatively easy to get lost in a forest. The STB - Swedish Tourism Bureau strongly advises that you stick to your path, and if you're lost, keep calm, stay in one spot, and hug a tree to calm down. However, that's all good and well when you're not lost and stressed. The problem arose when the cairns looked different, almost as if they had been relocated, and they didn't follow the old pathway. They were arranged in a disorderly fashion, as if someone had willfully moved them while I wasn't looking. Upon realizing that I wasn't on the same path, I attempted to follow the guidelines: stay where you are, breathe, and hug a tree. However, the trees were murky, rotten, and it was only now that I noticed they all had shallow chops in them, making it likely that I would break the tree if I attempted to hug it. 

This was a breaking point, and I struggled to remain calm as I realized that the forest had grown quiet—no birds whistling, no wind howling, no branches crackling—just silence. My heart raced erratically, each beat echoing like a drum in my chest, while the air grew thick and unbreathable. As my thoughts spiraled into a vortex of fear and dread, a suffocating sense of impending doom consumed me, rendering even the most familiar surroundings alien and threatening. At the peak of my fright, I saw a light, wiggling up and down on the horizon.   
It came closer and closer, inviting me to step out of my self-brought anxiety. An old light, bright yellow, cast long dancing shadows around it. With only a few steps ahead, it stopped, and for the first time, I saw that the light came from a candle with its flame flickering in the air.  
 Behind the light, a small but mighty voice echoed.

Then, as if a whisper from the ether, I heard it—a faint and mysterious sound, akin to a soft breeze rustling through the leaves. It was not laughter but an uncanny presence that seemed to emanate from the very heart of the forest. My heart raced as I froze in place, straining to discern the source of this ethereal sensation.

The presence drew nearer, and with it, an uncanny sense of foreboding. Emerging from the dense undergrowth before me stood a figure—an elderly man, bent and frail, his face etched with wrinkles, but something about him seemed off. He was dressed in a bizarre cross-dressing manner that seemed more unsettling than supernatural. He stood no taller than a meter, his eyes bright with an unsettling glint that defied description."Mister, are you lost?" he inquired, his lips curling into a gentle, understanding smile.

I swallowed hard, my voice quavering as I confessed, "Yes, I'm lost. I have no idea how to find my way back."The man's demeanor was calm, and his eyes held a wisdom that transcended his aged appearance. "Finding your way back from these woods is not always straightforward.""What do you mean?" I questioned.  
The old man gestured to himself, his gnarled fingers tracing the contours of his bark-like skin. "I am Bysen, the guardian of these woods. You have unknowingly ventured into a realm where the paths are not always clear.

My skepticism grew, and I regarded him with a suspicious eye. "And you're here to help me find my way back, I suppose?

Bysen's unsettling smile remained. "It's not as straightforward as that. But if you're willing to assist me with a peculiar task, I may consider guiding you back."My doubts persisted, but curiosity compelled me to listen to his bizarre proposition. 

Stranded in this captivating forest, I felt like I had entered a strange and surreal realm. "What kind of task are we talking about?"
