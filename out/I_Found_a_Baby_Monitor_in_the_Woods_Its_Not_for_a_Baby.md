I hike alone. Always have. Quiet helps me think, and the trails around Black Hollow Forest are empty this time of year. No tourists. Just me, the trees, and whatever animals haven't gone into hiding.

Three days ago, I found something strange. About five miles in—far off any marked trail—I saw a flicker of green between two boulders. Curiosity got the better of me. I squeezed through and saw it: a baby monitor. The handheld kind, half-buried in damp leaves. It was still on. Still working.

Static hummed from the speaker. The screen was dark, but when I picked it up, it lit up with a grainy, flickering image: a crib in the middle of the woods.

No, not a crib. A box, shaped like a crib, but made of branches, bones, and rope. Inside, something moved.

I stared at it for a solid minute before I realized the monitor wasn’t just showing a crib—it was showing a live feed.

And the location? It couldn’t be more than a few hundred feet from where I stood.

Against better judgment, I followed the direction the screen showed—north, toward a stand of old birch trees. Every step I took, I checked the monitor. The image barely changed, except whatever was in the box shifted occasionally. Breathing, maybe.

Eventually, I saw it.

A makeshift cradle, exactly like the one on the screen, nestled between roots like a twisted offering. No camera, no wires. Just the crib—and something swaddled inside.

It looked like a baby at first. Wrapped in some kind of hide. But when I leaned closer, I saw it wasn’t breathing.

And it had teeth. Too many. Too small. All filed down to needle-points.

I dropped the monitor.

It didn’t fall. It just… didn’t. Like gravity forgot it existed. One moment it was in my hand, the next it was gone—and the thing in the crib turned its head toward me.

I ran.

I don’t remember getting back to my truck. I don’t remember the drive home. But when I got there, I had dirt under my nails and scratches on my arms. Like something had grabbed at me through the trees.

I tried to forget it. Convince myself it was just a hallucination—bad mushrooms or stress. Until the monitor showed up on my kitchen counter the next morning.

Still on. Still showing that cradle.

Except now… it’s empty.

I haven’t slept in two nights. The monitor won’t turn off. Won’t break. I smashed it with a hammer. When I turned around, it was back on the counter. Good as new.

And every night, I hear static in the hallway. My phone won’t take pictures of it. The screen just shows black when I try.

Tonight, something new happened.

A second cradle appeared on the monitor. This one’s in a room I recognize—my bedroom.

I think the thing is coming. I think it’s looking for something.

I think it thinks I’m its parent.

Please… if anyone’s seen something like this—if you know what this is—tell me what to do.

I don't want to pick it up.
I don’t want to hold it.
But I think… tonight… it’ll cry.
