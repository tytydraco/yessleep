okay here's a coin in a well.

I know that shadow people phenomena went mainstream, but I held this story on my chest for too long and need somewhere to post it, to get over with. Thank you to whoever reading, anyway.

It started one night, I was liying on my side, (I have a very narrow bedroom), I felt a presence at my back, my hair stood up. I instinctively put a blanket over my head, but I could feel a sort of energy like radiation scanning me through. I distinctly remember the feeling of two entities, but I did not yet see them.Two or three days later, in the evening, I went out of the bathroom to my bedroom, and felt a vanilla like scent and a gut feeling. As I saw through the doorframe, I see these two entities, like if for them time did not even pass at all, but from another angle, exactly like I mind-sketched they were under the blanket. They were not just like shadows, as if it was an inverse reflection, as If it was black, but it went into abyss, like even black was sucking somewhere into infinity.Next week on Sunday, I was sleeping and was having a pretty ordinary if not sweet dream, as if I was walking with my childhood friend in a childhood neighborhood and we were eating the same pack of crisps. As I took one, suddenly, the dream stopped in a flash and I started choking. I woke up, trying to have a breath, when I see my door open and in fron of it, staring at me, this tall, blacker than black, like they say, hunched to the ceiling, shadow man, BUT, he also had red eyes, that had the same quality, it was redder than red, as if red was going in, rather than radiating. I choked like for a minute at least, trying to breathe, while that thing was looking at me, and I could sense evil. And believe me, I had my share of sleep par.-ses, it was not.  Finally, as I caught my breath, I passed out. As I woke up, I immideatly went for a smoke to deal with all this. AND the door was closed! As I opened it, and stepped through, my hand as by a charm reached to my underpants and pulled out a rusty needle on a black thread. And don't tell me like I could have walked all day with a rusty needle poking my balls and did not notice. What the hell was that??

And to me, you know, a lot of people say they are aliens, and I would call bull on that, but analyzing it in my memory cracks some doubts. Demons? Extradimensionals? Sure, I also have a couple of stories to tell.But what if, while we are looking at the shadows, there is somebody actually projecting that shadow, somebody completely different, out of the view, like in a plato's cave. Thanks for reading.
