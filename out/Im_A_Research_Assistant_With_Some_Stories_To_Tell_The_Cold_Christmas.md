&#x200B;

Christmas has always been an odd time for me. In case anyone is wondering, yes Santa Claus does exist as does Krampus. In fact, we’ve been able to document many of the creatures or figures associated with this holiday. Krampus and Kris Kringle have been the hardest among them for obvious reasons.  Dean told me that he was once part of the time that was trying to get footage of The Yule Cat.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The result of that was a single photo that cost the lives of over twelve agents. Hearing about such things certainly keeps the magic aspect of the holiday albeit without much joy. Still, I’d be lying if I said I didn’t have some fond memories. I can remember this one time when I was seven or eight, somewhere in there on Xmas Eve. Dean let me open one present.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The one picked turned out to be a brand new GBA SP complete with a charger and a bunch of games. I know even back then that was considered a bit of an older console, but I still loved the hell out of it. Come the morning, I also found a copy of Brawl and Guitar Hero for my Wii. I hope this gives everyone a better perspective on Dean. I usually have a lot to say on a certain topic and I don’t want to get too sidetracked. Don’t misunderstand.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I get my upbringing wasn’t exactly normal or stable. I get why it needed to be this way, though. Very few people can do what we do so I think he’s done his best with me under the circumstances. He’s even told me there are certain things he wishes he handled differently. Anyway, I just said I didn’t want to ramble and here I am, rambling.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

For this post, I’m going to be retelling the unexpected hazards I had to deal with during this holiday time. It was two years before the first story I shared here, the one with the vampires.  For some context, Dean and I were planning to spend Christmas Eve and Day with Stella’s family. I got a call from Brice saying that he and Sheila were driving across the states to go to a family gathering at her aunt’s place.  Since Brice and I lived not too far from each other, they wanted me to tag along.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I thought it was odd they wanted me third-wheeling it in the back, but I didn‘t want to disappoint them. I agreed and told Dean. He said he understood and that he hoped I had a good time with them. He left and I had the house to myself for a day which was a nice change of pace. Sheila’s car pulled up on the twenty-second followed by Brice greeting me.

“Get the hell out there, Zane,” he shouted from the driveway. “It’s fucking freezing.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He honked the horn several times and I could hear Sheila telling him to knock it off.  Knowing how impatient Brice can get, I made sure to prepare ahead of time. I grabbed some snacks to bring along and my luggage then headed out. Brice and Sheila were already grinning when they saw me.

“Hey, nice hoodie,” Sheila said, complimenting me.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I was wearing a Grinch face hoodie, the one from the classic animation. Brice was in a green and red sweater that kind of looked like something Freddy Krueger would wear. Sheila had on a Frosty sweater.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Thanks,” I told Sheila, “I take it you’re both in the holiday spirit?”

“You know it,” Brice replied. “Now, why don’t you get in here before you freeze your ass off?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He didn’t have to ask me twice. I hopped in and we were off.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“So, see any weird shit lately?”  Brice asked.

&#x200B;

Sheila punched him in the shoulder.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Ow, what was that for?”

“You promised you wouldn’t ask him about that. Besides, he probably can’t even talk about it, right, Zane?”

“I mean, I don’t go on missions all the time. I’ve mostly been hanging around the house. Although, Dean and I did go to a light show. I thought that was pretty cool. Anyway, what have you two been up to?”

“Shopping with my parents,”  Sheila said.

“Has that been fun?”

“If you think standing in the same spot for over half an hour while waiting for my mom to decide which shade of green she likes best then yeah.”

“Oh, sorry to hear that.”

“Don’t be. Why do you think I wanted to drive to my aunt’s with you guys?”

“Right, that makes sense. What about you, Brice?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He’d reclined his seat while Sheila and I were talking and put his feet on the dashboard.  Seeing this, Sheila rolled her eyes. Brice got a candy cane from the arm compartment and then unwrapped it as he answered me.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Well, if you must know, a whole bunch of family shit. My cousin got busted for trying to rob an ATM and then I found out my Dad’s been cheating on my Mom with her sister, so she’s kicked him out for the time being.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The surprise on Sheila’s face in the rearview mirror matched my emotions.  I knew we were both wondering how he could be sharing such devastatingly bad news so casually. He popped the candy cane in his mouth.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Are you, you know, alright?” I asked.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He got lost in thought for a second.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Me? Oh yeah, I’m good.  Hey, how about some music?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He turned on the radio, then hummed along as Sheila and I caught each other’s worried gazes in the reflection. Other than what Brice had shared, it was all in all a decent road trip. We chatted about shows we were watching. Sheila went on about Naruto and Ghost In The Shell.  Brice told me he was marathoning New Vegas.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I shared that I’d recently gotten done reading the original Christmas Carol and that Dean and I had watched the version starring George C. Scott.  For anyone who hasn’t seen it yet, you’re missing out. The drive continued like this for some time and then we ran into an issue. Sheila’s told me that her Dad’s always been a bit overprotective and that he had her check the weather of the route we’d be going before driving.  It was supposed to be mostly clear other than driving through a few flurries, but nothing you’d consider hazardous, especially if you’ve lived in areas where snow is expected.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

However, we got to a point where it was picking up fast. Brice was driving. He and Sheila switched while we stopped at a gas station.   The defrost was cranked to max and the windshield wipers were fruitlessly trying to swipe away the snowflakes.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“I can’t see jack shit,” Brice told us. “I thought you said you checked the weather before the trip?”

“I did,” Sheila replied. “It was supposed to be clear.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We didn’t have a clear indicator of where exactly we were or how far away we were from Sheila’s aunt since the reception was wonky.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“I think we should find shelter until this passes,” I suggested.

“Yeah,” Brice agreed, “hopefully, it’s someplace decent.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

There was a moment of visibility in the snow. The high beams illuminated the sign of a hospital.

“Not exactly what I had in mind, but I’ll take it.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We pulled in and got out. The flurries were stinging against our faces as the wind made them whip against us.  Something made me pause. I thought I could hear a faint chime off in the distance and looked in that direction.  Brice slapped me on the back.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“The hell are you doing, trying to get frostbite?” he asked. “Come on.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I followed, taking one last glance back. The noise was gone, so I dismissed it and followed my friends.  The walk to the entrance couldn’t have been that long, but it felt like miles. Getting inside from that cold was indescribably satisfying.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Thank Christ, I was freezing my nuts off out there,” Brice said.

“They probably have vending machines. We can get something warm while we wait for things to clear up,” Sheila replied.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I surveyed the area, seeing the waiting room was packed. My eyes fell on one of the TVs.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“I think we might be here longer than we thought,” I told Brice and Sheila.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I pointed to the screen which was displaying the local news. The meteorologist was going on about unexpected hazardous weather throughout the area and how people should stay in and bundle up.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“We might end up having to sleep here then,” Brice said. “I knew I should have brought a pillow.”

“Too late for that now,” I replied, “Sheila, can you ask someone if they know how far we are from where your aunt lives?”

“Sure thing.”

“Alright, I’m going to get some drinks. What do you guys want?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Brice answered he wanted some coffee with three packs of sugar and one creamer. Sheila told me she’d be fine with some hot cocoa and I got tea. I filled our cups and got ready to carry them back.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Wait, what are you saying?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I glanced back to see a cop passing by while holding his radio. He stopped at the entrance to the vending area and his partner’s voice came from the speaker.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Something is here. I don't know what the hell it is, but it’s got me pinned. I’m hiding in the cruiser right now. I don’t know what to do, man. I’m fucking scared.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

My neck hairs stood as I listened closer.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“John, calm down. Just hang tight and I’ll be there as soon as I-”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The sound of breaking glass followed by screaming came from the speaker. Then there was only static. The cop stood in silence, not even having noticed me due to his shock. Then he walked off. I don't know which was worse, that this was happening or that I didn't find it that surprising.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I brought the drinks back to the waiting room. Brice was watching something on his phone. Sheila was talking to a woman who had a newborn with her.  Brice saw me and let Sheila know who gestured me over.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Estrella, this is our friend, Zane,” she said.

“Es un placer conocerte, Zane,” Estrella smiled.

“Yeah, it’s nice to meet you too,” I replied. Hey, Brice and Sheila, could you come help me with these?”

“Oh yeah, our bad,” Brice said.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

While I was giving them their drinks, all it took was one look from me for them to realize something was wrong. Sheila told Estrella that we needed to step away for a bit. Then the three of us went somewhere quieter to talk.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Okay, what’s up?”Brice asked.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I explained what I overheard in the vending area.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“It could’ve just been an animal,” Sheila said. “There’s probably a lot of wildlife around here.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I shook my head.

“I don’t think so, not from the way the other cop described it, and if it were why didn’t he shoot at it? Even if it were a bear, from his position, he would’ve been able to get off point-blank shots.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

My friends didn’t have any refutation of this.

“So you’re saying there’s some weird shit going on?” Brice asked.

“It seems that way,” I replied.

“What should we do then?” Sheila inquired.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I could tell both were trying to remain calm and yet I detected slight nervousness in their tones. I couldn’t say I blamed them.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“First off, did you ever ask anyone how far away we were from our next destination?” I asked Sheila.

“Yeah, someone at the desk told me about four hours.”

“Were the phones working?”

“Sorry, no.”

“Shit, well, we don’t have a lot of information to go on. Not to mention, calling Dean or Stella is off the table. For now, we should stay put and make sure to keep this on the down low. If we’re lucky, we won’t have to deal with it.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Sheila apologized to Estrella for us taking a while and she assured her it was alright. We sat down and I took a sip of my tea. It helped calm me some. Brice and Sheila decided to watch a movie on his phone.  I glanced at Estrella who was feeding her baby.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“What’s her name?” I asked.

“Lanna.”

“That’s cute.”

“Thank you.”

“Mind me asking why you’re here?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

A worried expression came over Estrella.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“It’s my husband. Something happened to him at work.  They told me he’s in stable condition, but it’ll take time for him to recover. I was so worried when the hospital called me.”

“I can imagine. Do they know exactly what happened to him?”

“They aren’t sure. They mentioned something about him almost getting frostbite. I thought it was weird since he does most of his work inside. He’s in welding.”

“I bet that must’ve been a close call.”

“It was. It’s a good thing his work is close by or else they may not have gotten him here in time.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

My mind has a bad habit sometimes of auto-making connections. Hearing Estrella’s words was causing my mental gears to start turning. I was tensing up and I tried to assure myself these were merely coincidences. However, deep down, I knew that wasn’t the case.

“How long have you two been together?”

“Six years, Jamal and I actually met during this time of year.”

“That sounds romantic.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Esrella’s eyes beamed.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“It was. I’ll never forget that day. He was so kind, especially compared to some of the other guys I’ve dated. They just had-”

“Fake kindness?”

“Exactly, but not him. Jamal’s always been genuine.”

“He sounds nice. Have you been able to visit him yet?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Estrella’s face fell.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Not for long, he was already unconscious when I got here.”

“That’s a shame.”

“At least he’s getting help. It’s strange, though.”

“What is?”

“He’s never talked in his sleep, but when I was in his room I heard him murmuring something about ringing. Is there something wrong?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

My expression had changed.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“I’ve just remembered something I need to check on.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I stood up and left without another word.  Even though I felt rude for abruptly ending the conversation,  what she had unintentionally revealed to me couldn’t wait. I looked over at Brice and Sheila.  He leaned over and whispered something in her ear that made her burst out in laughter.  I smiled to myself, then left.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I was searching for the cop I overheard earlier. In hindsight, I probably should have tried to talk to him before. Then again, it’s not as though he gave me much time to attempt a conversation.  There were eight floors to the hospital. Any of which, he could’ve been on.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

All I could do was, begin searching and hope I happened to run into him. I succeeded in this sooner than I thought just not in the way I wanted. As I was exploring the first floor, I thought about the most likely place he could be. If I were him, I might try to get something else to help me. The only place that could’ve been was his police car.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Given the direction he was headed, I assumed it was near that exit outside. A pit of dread was already forming in my stomach before I even got there. We’d been in the waiting room for a while. The cop would’ve had enough time to get what he needed and return inside even with the blizzard outside. Speaking of, it was even worse than when we arrived. The automatic doors going outside were frozen together and I had to pry them open.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Stepping out,  I raised my arm to shield myself from the pelting flurries. Squinting, I was able to see a faint light up ahead. I pressed forward, eventually reaching it. The light turned out to be coming from a flashlight. I picked it up and shone it around.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

If the weather wasn’t cold enough, what the flashlight beam revealed chilled me to the bone. I let out a gasp when I came across the face of the cop, the same one from earlier. His face was ghostly pale and his lips were a dark blue. His eyes were open and he had a, no pun intended, frozen look of horror on his face. I inspected further and found a gaping chest wound.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The especially strange thing was what I found when I looked into it. His insides were visible and completely frozen solid. I don’t mean from the weather. It was like something had turned his organs into literal ice. His badge showed the name Murphy Leeson.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

His keys were in his hand which meant I was right about him going to his car.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Since his gun wasn’t out, I assumed he didn’t have time to draw it. Whatever did this couldn’t be far and I wasn’t about to become the next victim. I wasn’t proud of this, but I looted the body, getting a flashlight, the keys, a taser, some pepper spray, handcuffs, a radio, and a gun. He also had a pair of gloves which I grabbed and put on.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I undid the gun’s safety and considered whether I should turn back or try to find his car. I reasoned he wasn’t far from it and scanned the area with the flashlight. I saw the badge symbol on the driver's door and ran to it. Opening the door, I found a shotgun lying on the floor of the passenger seat.  I climbed inside and shut the door.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I turned on the hand radio and spoke into it, giving my name and where I was calling from.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Officer Murphy Leeson is deceased. I repeat, Officer Murphy Leeson is deceased. I don’t know how many suspects there are, only that they are armed and extremely dangerous. If anyone is hearing this, send backup immediately.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Only static came from the speaker and somehow I got the feeling my message hadn’t been received. I checked the glove compartment, finding some shells. I loaded the shotgun and aligned its strap over my shoulder.  Having one wasn’t going to keep people calm. However, given what I’d seen, people inside needed to be warned.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I was about to step back out when I saw them. Silhouettes were in the blizzard. The best way I can explain their appearance was being vaguely humanoid. Their movements were all wrong as if they were being puppeteered. Given what happened to Murphy’s partner, it was doubtful the squad car would provide suitable protection. I needed to get back to the hospital.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Brice and Sheila were probably wondering where I was. In preparation, I cocked the shotgun, then got out. Crunching in the snow was my only warning right before one pounced. I managed to bring up the butt of the gun in time for it to connect with the face of something entirely made of ice. The force of my swing cracked off part of it and yet it was undeterred.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

It made another lunge. I raised the barrel of the [shotgun](https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesFromRose/) and [fired.](https://www.threads.net/@rose_black2222)
