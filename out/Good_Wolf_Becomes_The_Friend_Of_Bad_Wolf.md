Conflict defines life. The conflict within a human is what separates humans from all other animals. Within each human, a battle rages with every decision, and two animals fight it. Within me and my ancestors, these animals are wolves.

My grandmother told me that one of these wolves is good. This wolf thinks about the future, it concerns itself with dignity and kindness, it takes care of its children. This wolf, when it is strong, can cause a person to sacrifice for others and to accept pain in order to survive. When this wolf is weak, it can only show good manners and whisper that honesty is beauty.

There is also a bad wolf. The bad wolf thinks about the past, it concerns itself with retribution and dominance, it is selfish and cruel. The bad wolf, when it is strong, will assert its will over others, hoard personal wealth and overwhelm enemies. When the bad wolf is starving and weakened, it can only feel resentment or paranoia and whisper that lying is clever.

There is more to this story, that I never understood. My grandmother also told me that the two wolves must both exist. That no person, no matter how terrible they might seem, is without a good wolf. And somehow, even more disturbing, no good person is without a bad wolf. She said that when a person is whole, both wolves can exist in harmony, and they no longer fight. When a decision is meant to be made by someone, there is no conflict, both wolves will agree.

I did not understand this story until I had my own story to tell. I think back, to how I imagined these wolves fought each other inside of me, and I remember being scared. I had not yet begun to know the true meaning of fear.

Last summer, on my uncle's ranch, I worked very hard. The ranch hands liked me because I always worked harder than they did, and they told me so. I felt like I had earned their friendship and their respect, and I was proud that I was not seen as a dude or a spoiled nephew, which is what motivated me to work so hard. I wanted their acceptance and esteem, and acquiring those things was my priority.

Near the end of summer, an elder was coming to visit my uncle. A cabin near the creek was to be prepared, where the elder would stay during the visit. The ranch hands and I rode out to prepare the cabin for the elder.

I rode my uncle's horse, Nespelem, and we arrived early and worked all day to prepare the cabin. We were all tired and hungry by early evening, and when we went to leave, I noticed my horse was missing.

The others offered to ride out and find Nespelem, but I didn't like that idea. It was better if they rode back and took care of their horses and themselves. I was in charge, and I told them what to do. At that moment my good wolf felt very strong, and alone at the cabin, I could feel the strength of my good wolf.

I began walking out, making wider and wider circles through the parkland. When I arrived at the meadow past the north end of the ranch, I stopped and felt something was watching me.

For a moment I stood there, thinking it could be a cougar. I felt for my knife and was reassured as my hand slipped over the handle, but I left it sheathed. A strange feeling, like my bad wolf was waking up unexpectedly, arose within me.

Somehow, I knew there was no cougar.

The feeling of being watched intensified and I realized I was not alone. In the dark, standing in the meadow, something unseen was there, and it was stalking me.

I began to feel afraid, because it was dark, I was alone and I knew that if it was not a cougar, my knife would not protect me. My uncle had warned me that there was something strange roaming the land, and that it could take a person over. Whatever was out there, it had possessed two people already, and fled when healers came, avoiding conflict.

Had it drifted to this place? I asked this question in my thoughts, hoping I would tell myself that it had not, or that it was just a story. Such a thing happening to people is not just a story. I did not want to become its next victim.

Each person it had inhabited had lost their will to live. When it was done with them, it left them hollow and without a voice. Somehow, having my ability to speak stolen from me seemed to be the worst thing that could happen.

I would rather face a rabid cougar.

I shuddered in fear and began to slowly turn around, staring into the darkness. I listened to the silence, but that was how I knew. The meadow should be full of the sounds of crickets and birds, frogs, scurrying and rustling. It was silent, so silent I could hear my heartbeat in my ears.

In the distance, I could hear my name called. Since I had not returned, I was missed. I wanted to call out, to shout over the distance, but I was paralyzed in fear. I worried that it would enter through my mouth as I inhaled, and that I would become its puppet.

I felt my bad wolf growling, ready to defend me, although it was weak. It urged me to defy the invisible mist around me, to yell out and get helped. It identified the enemy, showing me in my mind that it was monstrous and evil, and I glimpsed its true form through the eyes of my bad wolf, who was not afraid to look at it.

The ground then began to shudder and I was filled with dread. It approached on thundering hooves, having taken Nespelem as its host. I looked and saw the horse's approach, galloping at me to trample me. Nespelem's eyes were like flames, and the horse emitted a feral shriek that barely sounded like a sound a horse could make, and went on for too long as it passed me.

My bad wolf had taken control, moving aside, anticipating the treachery of the monster. I realized that if I was going to survive, I was going to have to use all of my wits. On one thing my good wolf and bad wolf agreed upon, I had to make quick decisions about what to do, and follow my instincts.

My bad wolf rose up within me, and ran alongside my good wolf, telling me I had to trick the monster, that I had to think like it, and know its next move. There was no time to debate the quality of my actions, I had to trust that the bad wolf would cooperate with my good wolf.

Nespelem was lost and would never be my uncle's horse again. It the creature got to me, it would cause great horror in the ranch. If it couldn't take me over, it would kill me and escape.

I knew when Nespelem would attack, and where a kick was flying, and when to dodge a charge. I evaded Nespelem over rocks and logs and ditches, working my way across the ranch. I did not hesitate to leap across the irrigation, and Nespelem fell and was too broken to continue. When the creature was disabled, I called out into the night for help.

Soon my uncle and the others found me and approached, holding lanterns and flashlights. My uncle had his shotgun, and seeing his horse, I saw his bad wolf flash across his eyes, telling him the horse was finished, and that ended the suffering quickly was a mercy. A balanced man, his bad wolf and good wolf conversing as equals and agreeing. I knew that feeling, as I had suddenly found such a strength in myself.

"Nespelem has Ohuakaw within." I warned them. My uncle kept everyone back and nodded at me. I was afraid, but I held my fear back, trying to feed my wolves with it.

"We will wait for the elder to arrive in the morning." He decided. He sent everyone home and he and I stayed and waited with Nespelem. The horse felt no pain, as it was already hollowed out by the creature within. Instead, we looked upon the broken body without pity, seeing only a prison for the murderous thing hiding within.

As we waited, the creature spoke to us in stolen voices, begging us to come closer, asking us for mercy and lying about how it meant no harm to us. As morning approached, Ohuakaw tried to bargain with us, first telling us it would spare us if we set it free, and then saying it would serve us. Both my uncle and I shook our heads, but we did not open our mouths. We both knew Ohuakaw was close, and it would enter through a person's open mouth, preferably when someone is speaking to it.

Headlights outraced the rise of the sun, and the sky began to glow. One of my uncle's pickups was racing towards us, driven by one of the ranch hands and bringing the elder, who had travelled during the night and arrived.

This was why the elder had come, to confront Ohuakaw. We helped the elder set up a folding table and set out all the items for the exorcism, a rattle, a drum, sage and a clay bowl filled with smoldering herbs and seven of the sacred woods. We helped the elder by singing, alternating our voices for the good wolf and then the bad wolf. We held hands with the elder at the end of the ritual, and watched as Ohuakaw emerged.

It was not easy to watch. The creature opened up the side of the horse and climbed out like a serpentine spider, shadowy and like a dark smoke, its body covered in mouths and thorns. It grew and menaced us, and I felt great fear, trembling and sweating.

"Ohuakaw, you have stolen our voice, violated our bodies and sown mistrust and madness among us. Now we see you. You are an evil spirit, and the Great Spirit is looking at you, and sees you now. You must go back into the darkness, and never return." The elder said, in ancient words that I barely understood.

I felt Ohuakaw leaving, and I knew the bad wolf in a person was not the same kind of evil as that thing. My fear lingered, having faced the demon.
