I don’t know if anyone will read this.

I don’t even know if this will upload.

English isn’t my first language. I’m writing this with help, because I don’t want to die without leaving at least some record of what happened here.

If you’re reading this and everything around you is still normal — it won’t stay that way for long.

Day One

I live in Kutná Hora, Czech Republic.

It’s a small city. Quiet. Historic. The kind of place where nothing ever really happens.

That morning started like any other.

It was around 6 a.m. I was getting ready for work, half asleep, scrolling through my phone.

There were strange videos everywhere — people talking about a virus, about dead people waking up. Zombies.

It felt fake. Like bad horror content made for clicks.

Outside my window, I noticed something unusual: police cars driving toward the hospital. Not ambulances — police. More than usual.

I noticed it. Thought it was strange. And ignored it.

We went to work as usual. On the road to Kolín, police cars were everywhere. Too many.

Looking back, that was probably the moment I should’ve stayed home.

But I didn’t.

The day passed almost normally. Around noon, panic online started growing fast. People warning each other. Some laughing. Some scared. Some angry.

By around 3 p.m., I was back in the city.

Kutná Hora felt wrong.

No traffic. Too quiet. And it was still a workday.

I went to my parents’ place. My younger brothers live with them. We talked, but none of us really understood what was happening yet.

Then emergency alerts started coming to our phones:

Unknown virus detected. Stay at home. Stock up on supplies.

We called my sister and her husband. They got the same alerts.

We decided to go to their apartment. We didn’t even pack anything. It still didn’t feel real.

By 9 p.m., the internet was flooded with videos.

The word “zombie” wasn’t a joke anymore.

The city went quiet in a way I’d never heard before.

Then we heard gunshots somewhere far away.

My sister lives near the train station, on the sixth floor. From the balcony, we saw people standing in their windows, just watching the streets.

Eight of us in one apartment. No one slept much.

Day Two

At 6 a.m., the news said the country was being divided into quarantine zones.

No details. Just that the virus was spreading.

Electricity, water, internet — everything still worked.

I was texting my girlfriend. She lives in Prague. She said things were much worse there.

Almost no people outside. Police everywhere. No public transport.

I knew how to drive, but not well enough to confidently get through checkpoints and chaos.

We still believed this would calm down.

From the balcony, we watched people returning from stores with whatever they managed to grab.

I went to a small local shop to buy cigarettes and food. It was still open. Almost empty.

Later, my father, my brother, and I went to a big supermarket.

It was chaos.

Food thrown around. People yelling. Crying. Fighting over nothing.

Some employees were still working, like they didn’t understand they were already risking their lives.

We bought whatever was left.

Rumors started spreading about the hospital. About infected people. About soldiers.

A close friend of mine was still in my apartment across the city. He said he couldn’t leave — infected people were outside his building.

People who tried didn’t come back.

I thought about going to him. My family begged me not to.

At around 5 p.m., a small military convoy entered the city, heading toward the hospital.

My friend sent a video. Soldiers shooting.

Some targets were clearly infected.

Some looked very much alive.

Then he stopped replying.

That evening, I told my family I was going to Prague.

I didn’t know how, but I couldn’t stay.

I decided to leave at first light.

Day Three

By 7 a.m., the internet was unstable.

I texted my girlfriend. Told her not to leave her apartment. Told her I was coming.

I avoided main roads. I knew the city well.

Near St. Barbara’s Cathedral, I saw the first real signs of looting.

Then I saw my first infected person.

It used to be a soldier.

I wasn’t brave. I wasn’t prepared. I was terrified.

I almost turned back.

But I didn’t.

When I reached my apartment building, the entrance door was smashed open.

A group of infected wandered nearby.

I didn’t go inside.

I texted my family. Told them things were much worse than we thought.

I told them I loved them.

I texted my girlfriend.

The connection died.

I left the city on foot.

Prague was 81 kilometers away. More, if you followed roads.

By evening, I reached a small village. Burned houses. Abandoned cars. Bodies that weren’t moving at all.

There was a small gas station. The lights were still on.

Sometimes the internet came back for a few seconds.

Messages said:

The situation is worsening. Do not leave shelter.

My family asked if I was alive.

My girlfriend said she was still home and scared.

I told them I’d reach Prague in a day or two.

My phone battery was almost dead.

I washed myself in the sink and decided to sleep in the storage room.

When I opened the door, infected fell out toward me.

I didn’t react fast enough.

One of them bit my arm.

I ran.

As far as I could.

Until I collapsed in a field.

There was no heroic moment.

No last stand.

Just cold ground, a dark sky, and the understanding that this was it.
