I’m thirty, broke, and alone in a 1BHK that smells like Vicks and stale takeaway. 104°F. Fourteen-hour shifts, six days a week. Sundays spent scrolling and hating myself. My fridge is energy drinks and sauces. My thighs ache from a chair. My friends are group chats I mute. I don’t remember the last time I laughed without a screen telling me when.
My body feels like it’s been dropped down the stairs. Knife-swallow throat. Sandpaper eyes. Bones like glass. I sweat through the mattress topper I promised I’d replace.
If this is the worst it gets, I think, I’ll take the exit.
I close my eyes.

----------------------------------------------

**Green**.
Not the algae in my cooler. Alive green—leaflight on skin. I’m under a giant fig whose roots look like old hands. I’m lighter, harder, sun-thick and scar-lined. My palms are rope-burned and proud. The world smells like wet stone and clay and something sweet I can’t name.
I stand. The forest stands with me.
I run because I can. I don’t pant like a dog. My lungs open like doors.
A river shows me my face. I look like a person who could lift his own life.
She finds me there.

Hair in two tight plaits. Laugh lines she earned. A scar across her forearm that says she lived. She watches me watch the water like she’s deciding if I’m a fool or a future.
“What do you know?” she asks, voice low as a drum.
“Nothing,” I say. “Everything.”
She snorts. “Eat first. Claim later.”
She shows me the wild garlic under the banana leaves. I show her how to make hooks from thorns. She teaches me knots with names like songs. I teach her to count stars in batches of five. We make a shelter that smells like smoke and wet earth and us.

We run, swim, climb, and fall into the river laughing. We make love like the body was designed by engineers. My shoulders learn the patient burn of carrying what matters. I learn the taste of salt that is work and the taste of salt that is joy.

Food is not a courier bag. Food is millet ground on stone, fish grilled on sticks, mango sucked down to the seed, honey eaten with knees muddy. I cook without looking at a screen. I lift what we need. My brain fog burns off like mist. Clarity is not a noun; it’s a practice.
At night, while the fire talks to the logs, she tells me the forest’s rules and I listen with my whole face.
“Another tribe,” she says one evening, jaw tight. “They want our ground. They bring metal.”
Metal cuts cleaner. Metal kills farther. Metal makes men forget they’re not gods.
“We’ll fight,” I say.
“We’ll plan,” she corrects.
So I plan.

I map the river bends in charcoal. I mark where the ground drinks footsteps. I set thorn traps where men who don’t belong will forget to look. I teach the boys to whistle like bulbuls instead of shouting. I teach the girls to move in firelight without throwing shadows.

I walk to their camp alone, hands up, to count faces and hammers, to smell their fear and hunger, to note who listens and who pretends to. I find the man everyone watches before he speaks. He has a scar like a comma at his lip. He doesn’t believe in fair. He believes in full.
We can’t outkill them. We can outlive them.
So we take leverage, not lives.

At night, we move their markers two hands to the left. We tangle their fishing lines and leave ours neat as prayers. We fell a tree where they won’t hear it and leave a path we chose. We return a stolen goat with a perfect plait in its beard and a string of shell money tied to its horn because respect buys more than fear ever did.

When they march, they march where I’ve already walked. When they stop, my people are gone. When they eat, their fires are cold and ours are ash. When they sleep, they dream of the wrong river.
And then I go to their leader with my hands out and my maps rolled.
“Trade,” I say. “You won’t die. We won’t die. 

You want fish and safe water and a crossing that doesn’t break ankles. We want the forest to remain a forest. We can show you where the river is honest and where it lies. You can show us how to turn ore into ploughs that don’t break.”
He stares at my traps, my neat rope, the quiet behind me.
Wisdom arrives late but it arrives.
He nods. A win-win that costs no blood. It feels like a miracle because we made it.
We go home whole.

Later, when the rains come fat and frequent, she kneels and winces and breathes and swears and our son enters the world with a howl that makes the fig tree shake. We name him for the sound mango leaves make when they forgive falling.

He is tiny and all at once everything. I hold him and watch him watch the light. I am a man who made a thing that makes me better.
At night he burns.
Skin too hot. Breath too fast. He fights the world for space and the world wins. We cool cloths in the river until the river says we are wasting it. She sings the storm song her mother sang. I whisper our names into his ear, the ones we wear and the ones we never told anyone.
He quiets. The quiet is not mercy.
We bury him where the roots drink deepest. The earth takes him like a promise kept. My wife presses her forehead to mine, and for the first time I understand what a break that will never heal looks like.
I lie on my side on the mat and grieve until the floor remembers a man-shaped hole.
I close my eyes.
White.

__________
AC that smells like medicine. Beeping that counts how human I manage to be. A nurse with soft hands and a face like the end of a long shift.
“You scared us,” she says. “104 and change. Work stress plus flu plus dehydration. You were… shouting for someone.”
I try to say the leaf-name we gave our son. My throat refuses. My eyes don’t.
“Family we should call?” she asks.
I shake my head because I have just lost them.
The chart calls it “delirium.” The doctor calls it “vivid fever dream.” I get fluids, paracetamol, and a printed sheet that tells me to rest like rest is something you can order.

When they discharge me I go back to the 1BHK with its single good cup and its sink that smells like old onion. My phone lies on the pillow like a trap that has forgotten it’s a trap.
I don’t open reels.
I open Notes.

I write the fig tree whose roots looked like old hands. I write her scar and the way she laughed with her shoulders. I write fish grilled on sticks and the way mango strings get in your teeth and you don’t mind. I write how a plan feels in your palms when it’s ready, how leverage is kinder than victory, how men decide to be wise and can be.

I write my son’s leaf-name in letters this language allows and the sound only we knew beside it. I prick my thumb and touch the screen and pretend that makes it binding.
Then, because grief is a map only if you walk it, I change things I can change.


I email my manager while the fever is still a ghost in the room.

Subject: Bandwidth and realistic SLAs I can’t keep the current load without breaking. Here’s a mapped alternative: 1) I train Rahul on the India reporting subset (two weeks). 2) We automate the vendor reconciliation (I wrote a prototype; demo attached). 3) We move my Sundays out of “escalation” and into “monitor only.” You get the same output with less overtime. We trade heroics for habit. Wins for both of us.

I expect silence. I get a calendar invite.
I stand in the mirror and do three push-ups. It is ugly. On the fourth I laugh because my chest says no and I am still here.
I throw out the bottles and keep one for soup stock. I order vegetables that look like they remember soil. I call my mother and listen to her talk about rain like it’s a person. I text the one friend I didn’t mute: “Walk?” He says yes like he was waiting for permission he didn’t need.

I join a Sunday running group and don’t die. I swim in a public pool that tastes like coins, and when I close my eyes I see the river bend. I learn to make dal like it’s a skill, not a punishment. I buy a kettle for the ritual of it. My body aches on purpose. The ache feels like paying a bill I owed myself.
The strategy at work works because it’s boring and true. Rahul learns. The prototype gets blessed. My boss says, “I forgot what sleeping on Saturday felt like.” I nod like the man with the comma-scar nodded and try not to cry in a conference room.


Clarity is a practice. I earn it daily.
Some nights, when the fan clicks and the city admits it’s tired, I dream the forest back. I dream the treaty fire and the way men’s shoulders soften when they see they don’t have to die to be respected. I dream my son’s breath not burning. I wake up holding a name the air won’t keep and I write it down anyway.
People think fever dreams are lies. Maybe. Maybe not. Mine gave me a wife who taught me to run, a son who taught me what breaking means, and a version of myself who could sit at a table and broker peace when everyone else wanted noise.



The hospital discharged me. The forest didn’t.
Every day I get to press one of two buttons: go numb or stay.
I still lose. I still slip. I still spend Sundays lost in a scroll and hate myself by evening. But then Monday comes and I lift the boring weights and cook the boring food and send the boring email that means a week doesn’t eat me raw.
Tonight I lace my shoes. The city is ugly-beautiful and the pavement is an old friend I used to ignore. I run to the only fig in my neighbourhood—the municipal one caged in iron near the chai stand. I touch its fence and whisper a leaf-sound that nobody here understands.
On the way home, my phone buzzes. The boss accepted the handover doc. Rahul sent a photo of his kid eating idli with both hands. My mother wants me to bring curry leaves on Sunday. My friend asked if I want to try trekking next month.
I put the phone in my pocket.
I run a little farther than yesterday.

When I get back to the 1BHK, I don’t open reels.

I open Notes.
I write: **Today I negotiated with a man who thought his only way to win was to keep me drowning. We both walked out breathing**

I write: **Today I made food that remembered soil**

I write: **Today I pressed green**
