Growing up, I was bullied for having an abnormally large nose. To top it off, I, grew up with grandparents who weren’t helping the situation either. I became extremely self conscious because of it. I was always known as the kid with the big nose.

So when I learned about a service that fixes your insecurities, I was beyond excited to get in on it. It was only $15, which felt like a steal!

I first learned about this service when I was walking out of class one day. I’d usually take the walk through the forest to my dorm (I’m in a boarding school which my grandparents used to get rid of me) because of its beautiful view. Unfortunately, this time it was closed thanks to construction, so I took the opposite direction through the main city’s bridge (which took at least 15 minutes longer).

And there I saw it.

It was a poster stuck on a street lamp that said “Have an insecurity? Well we can fix it! Low price of $15!” There was a phone number written down below it.

I was hesitant and disregarded it as first. It looked funny though so I took a picture of it. I wish I had left it at that.

I don’t know if the poster gave me motivation, or what got into me, but the next day I chose to face my fears and ask my crush out (we’ll call her Amy).

Nervous, I walked up to her before class started and tapped her shoulder. She glanced at me and took off her headphones, her straight, brown hair looking as beautiful as ever.

“What’s up?” She asked.

“Hey, umm…” I hesitated. “I just think you’re really pretty. You wanna go out sometime?”

She looked at me and just burst out laughing. “Haha, you?! Hammerhead?! Haha it’s a joke, right?”

“Uhh…” I said back. Yes, my nickname was hammerhead...You can probably guess why.

“Thanks for the laughs, I needed it this morning, couldn’t sleep much last night.” She smiled and walked away as if nothing happened.

I tried holding my tears back. Clenching my fist, I stopped myself from punching the wall. 

That was the last straw, I was tired of being treated this way for 16 years of my life.

I called in sick and secretly walked to where the poster was. It was still there.

In a desperate moment, I dialed the number.

Not even a ring was heard before someone on the other line picked up. It was a woman.

“Hello?” She said.

“Hi, uh…is this the number that fixes insecurities?” I cringed at the question. I shook my head as I realized how desperate I was to the point that I didn’t even consider if this was a joke ad or not.

I was about to hang up before, to my surprise, she responded. “Yup! May I give you the address?”

I raised an eyebrow, but was too far deep to stop now. 

“Yes, please.” I said in defeat.

She gave me her address and I showed up in a flash. It looked to be her garage door, around a 45 minute walk from where the poster was located.

“Hiii!” She waved cheerfully as she walked out. “Appointment for Andrew?”

She looked to be around my age, maybe a bit older. She had curly black hair and brown eyes.

I smiled back. “Yeah, that’s me.”

“Great! Come in, come in. How may I help you?”

She closed the garage door and asked me to sit on what looked to be a dentist chair.

“My…nose is too…” I didn’t even want to finish my sentence. I couldn’t contain my embarrassment, but I guess as long as it gets fixed.

“Too big? Alrighty, I’ll get it done right away!” She said with a smile.

Putting latex gloves on, she began massaging my face. Although I felt a slight tingle, that was all. It was over in just a few minutes.

“Ok, all done!” She said excitedly. “That will be 15 bucks!”

I hesitantly handed her the $15 and stormed out furiously. I was too shy to confront her.

I walked all that way for a scam like that?! I couldn’t believe how desperate I was and kicked a trashcan onto the ground out of anger on my way back to my dorm. My day just kept getting worse.

I headed back and opened the door to my dorm awkwardly. I was already getting bullied, no way would I allow this to get worse, so I tried to secretly walk in, which didn't work.

“Yooo Andrew! Did you get a nose job or something?” Shouted someone from the other side of the hallway.

I jolted and looked up. It was one of my classmates.

“Oh, uhhhh….” I didn’t dare to say anything.

“Looks better dude.” He said whilst patting me on the back. “I’ll see you in class tomorrow, yeah? Everyone’s gonna go crazyyyy haha!”

I was confused. No way did that work. He was just teasing me, right? Amy had probably told everyone about me asking her out by now, it must’ve been a joke.

Looking at myself in the mirror, I was completely wrong.

My nose looked…better?

I couldn’t believe it. That ad was actually real?! It actually fixed my insecurity? No way?!

I practically jumped up and down with joy. Maybe people would finally start treating me normally?

I went to sleep with a huge grin on my face, excited for people’s reactions tomorrow.

Little did I know, things were about to get much, much worse.

I woke up with a massive headache. Worse of all, I struggled to breathe from my nose. Not only that, I could barely even open my mouth. As if there was an airway blockage. Maybe I was tired.

I walked to the bathroom with exhaustion, each step feeling heavier than the previous one. Looking at myself in the mirror, I gasped.

My nose looked much smaller. When I say smaller, I mean the nose looked smaller than a singular Cheerios cereal. It was barely there. The nostrils were also much smaller. Not only that, but my mouth was too, and I could barely open it for some reason. I couldn’t utter a word. I could barely breathe.

“What the fuck?!” I thought.

Coincidentally, I got a message from the girl.

“How are you liking it? ;)” she wrote.

My body began shaking and my heart was racing. Did she think this was a game? A joke?!

“What the fuck did you do to me?!” I texted back. “What did you do?!”

She didn’t respond.

I panicked and looked around for anything that could help. Obviously there wasn’t anything. This was nothing I ever saw before. I then got a message back.

“Come back and I can help you fix it :)” wrote the same girl. “Might’ve been a slight mistake on my part, my bad :p”

The fake smiling emoticon pissed me off. It’s not like I could ask anyone else to fix it either. This was beyond anything science could explain. My organs were shrinking, how else could I fix it?!

Covering my nose and mouth, I sprinted out of my dorm towards her apartment. Every step made it harder to breathe, harder to see, harder to move. And worst of all, I didn’t know what to do to fix it. But I persisted. As long as I could get there on time, I could solve the issue. 

She was the only person who probably knew how to reverse it after all.

Halfway through, I collapsed to the floor, unable to inhale a single molecule of oxygen.

Checking my face from the phone camera, my heart stopped. Not only was my nose completely gone, but my mouth was halfway to facing the same fate, as were my eyes. They were literally shrinking by the second. 

Shaking, I checked my contacts in a panic, but the girl’s number was gone. Not only that, so were her messages. She disappeared without a trace!

I didn't know what to do. I basically couldn't breathe with no solution in sight.

I then finally passed out and woke up in my dorm room with a scream. I could breathe, albeit barely from my mouth. I was shaking, distressed. Touching my face, my nose was completely gone. No scar, no sign that it was there at all. As if I never had a nose to begin with.

"The fuck?!" I thought.

I then received a notification from my phone. It was from the girl.

"Hey! Hope you enjoyed our services. Let me know if you need anything else fixed :)"
