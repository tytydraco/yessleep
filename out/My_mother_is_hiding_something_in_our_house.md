My name is Hannah and I’m 17 years old. I’m writing this and posting it here because there doesn’t seem to be any other place for me to go. I heard that there will be people here who understand which is why I am begging for you to take me seriously and not use this as a simple opportunity for trolling.

I know that this might sound confusing, but I will explain everything to you from the very beginning, at least I hope I can before *she* finds out…

 

Ever since I was young, my mother had very strict rules about where me and my siblings could go within our house. You must understand that our house consists of multiple apartments, 5 to be exact and plus the garage if you want to count that in as well since it is split up into three rooms and even has a bathroom attached to it.

Currently we are only living in two of those 5 apartments since most of them are either very dirty or we are simply not using them. When my brother and sister were still living here, they inhabited apartment three but since my mother and I are only two people we don’t need as much space anyway and are therefore only using the apartments 4 and 5. I know this might be hard to understand which is why I’ve tried my best to quickly sketch out a rough plan.

  But of course, I was also a child once and a very explorative one at that. I always liked to go to the older houses in our town and if they stood empty me and my friends would sneak in there and look around the places ourselves, usually just scaring each other by making creepy sounds until someone couldn’t take it anymore and ran outside.

It was quite a lot of fun and whenever my friends came over to my place they’d ask if we could go and look at all the old rooms within my house. I always tried to evade their questions; “Oh there’s nothing in there.”, “That’d be boring though.” And so on.

The actual reason behind why I didn’t want or rather, wasn’t allowed, to snoop around my own house always went unnamed.

While I was very interested in exploring, I was and usually still am an honest person, which is why I always asked my mother for permission before doing anything.

Whenever I’d ask her if I could go into the unused apartments or even just the other rooms of the garage, she’d always scoff at me and roll her eyes.

“Ugh, is that really necessary now?”

This response stayed the same, no matter how old I was and even up until now she always acts annoyed whenever I would ask her to simply explore a bit. Now you might ask: “But Hannah, why not just sneak a peek when your mom isn’t around?”. You see, I would but something always held me back. Even when she was off to work for the whole day, I still had this dreading feeling that as soon as I entered one of the previously unknown rooms, she’d suddenly come back and give me a talking to.

That doesn’t sound too bad, especially now that I’m more mature I should be able to handle a bit of a fight over something so silly, but I was always scared of making my mother angry. We never fought often but when we did it was horrible, and she’d drop the famous “Oh so I am just a bad mother?”. That sentence alone sends shivers down my spine for just thinking about it which is why I avoided getting on her bad side, up until a few days ago at least.

My mother, my brother Harrison and I recently went to visit my grandparents. We helped my grandmother with her garden and exchanged some idle chatter about the weather, how school was going and, of course, how disrespectful this generation of kids apparently is, typical grandparents talk.

Harrison is 26 which makes him the oldest of us three siblings and I don’t get to see him often so having the opportunity to get-together like this was quite nice to have. Our conversation started out casually. Since we’re both very interested in videogames, we talked about new ones we found, old ones that we replayed or the up-and-coming ones that we are most excited about or that we think are going to turn out to be absolute failures.

After the sun started to set though and our grandpa offered us a beer, the conversation slowly shifted toward family matters. My mother was helping my grandma in the kitchen which is why we felt comfortable in trash talking for a little while and until he brought up his experience with my mothers’ weird restrictions. I immediately asked him further about what he meant.

“Wait, was she always like that?” I asked him.

“Oh yeah, I never understood that, even if I just wanted to go search for some tools in the garage, she’d just get annoyed and get it herself eventually.” Harrison leaned back in his seat, taking another sip from his beer.

I was surprised by this since it wasn’t unknown that our mother became a lot more chill as the years went by. The screaming matches I have with her were nothing compared to the fights that Harrison, let alone my sister Hayley, had with her when they still lived with us.

“That’s so weird, but I guess she never really liked us doing stuff by ourselves.” One of my hands moved up to rub at my temple, I could already feel the alcohol making me dizzy, sometimes I hated being a lightweight.

“True.”

Our mother never really taught us kids any life skills or even just practical stuff. She never liked seeing us cook alone in the kitchen and whenever one of us even just did as much as glance at a knife she’d immediately grab it from us, told us that we would just hurt ourselves and were holding it wrong anyway, effectively deriving us from learning anything while we still lived with her.

“I never really felt at home there anyway.”

“What?”

Harrison was staring off into space and absent-mindedly emptying his second bottle of beer for tonight.

“I dunno, just, all these weird restrictions and stuff, I guess. And the fighting didn’t make it better. For god’s sake, my girlfriend had to teach me how to do laundry or how to properly cut up an onion.” He laughed, more to himself than to anyone else it seemed.

“Yeah... I guess you’re right.” The weird melancholy mood that suddenly spread through the room caused me to curl up on my seat. It’s not like we had the worst childhood or the worst mom, but it certainly was weird.

“I mean, I know it doesn’t come off as a surprise to you, but Hayley and I don’t really get along, right?” I let out a breathy laugh.

“What do you mean? You guys are best friends.” I sarcastically remarked which earned me a cheeky grin from my brother.

Harrison and Hayley’s relationship was the definition of ‘hatred’. It didn’t matter how many times we as a family tried to bring them closer together, it seemed that all they were good for were passive aggressive comments and hair pulling.

“There’s one thing I do admire about her though.” His serious expression turned mine into a confused one. Was he seriously going to compliment his arch enemy?

“She never took shit from mom.”

I could only nod at that. Hayley truly embodied the ‘IDGAF’ attitude and she made it everybody else’s problem, even that of her own parents. The constant bickering and screaming matches of her and my mother that I was exposed to when I was merely a toddler fucked something up inside my head but there definitely was something admirable about how Hayley always stood her ground. Sadly enough, that attitude was also what basically turned me into a single child at the mere age of 6 on the account of my brother already having moved out by this point. I don’t remember much of the fight but the evening before my first day of school was the last time I ever saw Hayley at home.

She moved to some other relatives when she was sixteen. No one knew what called for such a drastic action.

Just for clarification, I asked Harrison again if he ever heard anything about the ordeal, but he just shook his head and eventually let out a short chuckle.

“Wouldn’t be surprised though if it had something to do with the unknown places in our house though.”

I decided to go along with the joke, to try and hide how much this thought was bothering me.

“Yeah, she probably lifted some dark family secrets.”

“What are you kids talking about?”

My head suddenly whipped around in a newfound panic only to stare into my mother’s unusually eerie eyes. She had always had this certain look that just freezes you on the spot. I knew it from the countless fights I had with her. It’s as if staring right at Medusa, only that the feeling was also accompanied by the fear of her suddenly and out of nowhere sprinting toward you in full speed. As if you were not going to see the light of the next day if you tried to withstand her gaze.

“Oh, we were talking about Gabriel Knight, it’s like a mystery game.”

Harrison with the quick mind of course found just the right deflection.

“Really? What is it about?”

My eyes wandered between my mother and Harrison. This didn’t feel like an attempt at finding out more about your kids interests. The room seemed to shift, and it felt more like watching an interrogation, one that had way too many false dialogue options to choose from.

“Well, it’s about this detective that wants to find out more about some cult that’s on the rise. As the story progresses, he finds out about his family having this super long lineage of people who defeat supernatural threats.”

The whole conversation sounded like something from a script. Harrison was giving her a calculated response and even if it was quiet, I heard the sigh of relief he let out when my mother nodded with a simple “Oh how silly” and returned to the kitchen.

“Damn, she can be scary huh?” He smiled at me, and I did my best to force a smile in return.

Little did he know that this entire conversation was the catalyst to something much bigger.

 

The next day I woke up at 4am and no matter how hard I tried, I couldn’t go back to sleep even though my body still felt exhausted and weak. Usually, my broken sleep schedule had me get up at noon but all the tossing and turning couldn’t get my eyes to close again and I decided to leave my bed to go make myself some food. While I was doing do, I stole a quick glance at my mothers’ work schedule which she marked in our calendar. She had a night shift today which meant that I could at least be as loud as I wanted with my friends online without her barging in and telling me to shut it.

As I was about to bite into my very poorly made sandwich, I heard the front door open. I froze up, my mind beginning to race. If it was an intruder I was done for. The way that the room was structured left me no opportunity to hide, he already saw me.

“Hannah? Why are you awake this early?”

The voice of my mother made me turn around. It was her.

She stood there as if it were completely normal, wearing black dungarees that made the whole scene feel even more surreal.

“Couldn’t sleep.” I simply stated and stared at her; shock written all over my face.

“What is it?”

I didn’t answer.

She started breaking out into laughter.

“Oh I know how this looks, I’m sorry I didn’t mean to scare you, I just had to go to the garage to get something from the car.”

“Yeah, sorry I’m just tired-“ I paused for a second. “Hey uhm, mom?”

“Yes darling?”

“Is Hayley doing well by the way?”

Again, she started laughing.

“She hasn’t talked to me in ages, how would I know?”

“Yeah, I dunno I just thought you heard something; she isn’t frequent with contact you know?”

A simple hum was all that I earned.

I turned around, staring at the sandwich in front of me, having lost all appetite.

Paired with the conversation that I had with Harrison the day before and the weird interaction between him and my mother made me gulp. Was she always sneaking around the house at this hour? Suddenly thoughts of her standing beside my bed in the middle of the night flooded my brain. The image my mind conjured up of her simply staring at me with that crazed look or worse, an ever so slightly present smile made me feel like I was about to throw up. Harrison was right.

This place never really felt like a home.

 

I spent the rest of the day within my room and in front of my computer, I couldn’t help but look around from time to time. I tried to control my breathing; it was fine. She was still my mother, my brain just made random stuff up to have me scared. Maybe I’m just missing some thrill in my life, that’s probably it.

What was the name of those relatives that Hayley moved to again?

A knock at my door had me jump in my seat.

“I’m off to work, food is in the fridge!” I heard my mother’s muffled steps fading away, going down the squeaky stairs and then the sound of the front door falling into it’s lock with a loud ‘bang’.

The sun had already set, and I stared at my blank computer screen for a good while before turning it off. I wanted to see what our house was hiding. In truth, what I wanted the most is for the ridiculous fear of my own mother to go away.

I stood up and grabbed a flashlight and as I was about to head down the spiral stairs leading into our houses court, I experienced this threatening feeling again as if my mother was right behind me, observing my every move.

Clenching my fists tightly I shook my head, it’s just a house. There would be nothing bad to discover. It’s the house I’ve been living in for 17 years. It would be fine.

It feels weird to look back on these thoughts after what I have seen.

I decided to enter apartment two first. The cold air from outside was harshly nipping at my skin and my fingers were freezing up as I tried the door. Surprisingly enough the handle pushed down easily and allowed me to enter the previously unknown spaces. It was quite dark inside and I clicked on my flashlight. The room was empty and the tile floor looked bashed in at some parts on the edges. What shocked me the most though was how clean it looked compared to what I was told and thus expecting.

“There’s dust everywhere.”

Is what my mother kept telling me when I asked her why I couldn’t go and have a little look-see.

“You’ll only damage your lungs.”

Deciding to keep looking, I tried to gain access to another room since everything else seemed to be positively empty. This time, the door put up more of a fight but luckily, I was able to get inside without damaging anything.

The only thing that was inside were cardboard boxes. I was about to leave and explore apartment one, but curiosity got the best of me, and I carefully folded open the top of one of the boxes. What I saw inside... was weird. I opened a bunch more boxes to be certain and I discovered that each one of them had clothes in them. From child to adult sizes, none of them looked like anything that me and my siblings had worn when we were young. What was even weirder was that some of them looked like they were centuries old. As if someone had collected clothing from like 6 or 7 generations and just piled them up neatly inside all these boxes. As I examined them closer, I noticed that there was something written on the cardboard boxes.

The box with the oldest looking clothing was simply labeled “A” and the others were similarly sorted. With “G” being the box with the clothing that looked relatively modern. “G” also seemed to be the final box.  
I furrowed my brows, probably something from the previous owners, our house was quite old after all.

I made sure to leave the room as I had entered it and carefully closed the doors, making sure that they were properly locked into place before I left for the first apartment.

By the time I pushed down the door handle I already felt much calmer then before, there was nothing strange to these rooms, it was simply some old stuff left behind by all the other generations of owners.

Sadly, I was proven wrong quite fast.

As I entered the first apartment, I was immediately met with a multitude of electronic buzzing. After almost tripping over multiple cables on the floor, I quickly realized that I wasn’t prepared to see any of this. In the middle of the apartment stood a giant desk, multiple monitors connected to it, it looked like something out of a sci-fi movie.

I stepped closer to the desk, careful not to touch any of the equipment.

At first, I couldn’t comprehend what I saw on these monitors but in the end, I was forced to.

All these monitors showed different corners of our house. My stomach twisted as I saw my own room reflected on the monitor in the middle. What the fuck was all this?

My attention was drawn to the monitor above the one in the middle, it showed a strange room that I wasn’t familiar with. It almost looked like a Maternity Ward or an NICU if I didn’t know any better. Too disturbed to simply turn around and pretend like I hadn’t seen any of this, I knew that I had to keep looking around.

My eyes quickly found the stairs leading up to the first floor and I hastily took them.

A sterile white light blended me as I reached the top. In the middle there was one bed and all around on the sides of the room were these capsules that sick newborn babies were typically put into.  
I felt saliva pouring in my mouth, I had no idea what this all was but the multitude of cameras that were hidden in every room and then this strange lab made me feel like I was inside a sick and fucked up fever dream.

I hurried out of the room and back upstairs into apartment four which had a door that led into our garden and to the garage.

Although it felt like everything inside my body was urging, no, screaming to run away, call my brother, my sister or better yet, the police, I simply couldn’t.

It seemed like I was on auto pilot with the way my legs moved on their own and how they halted in front of our garage only for my hand to automatically reach for the handle. The first room of our garage I knew, my mother parked her car here and it was the only part of the garage that me or my siblings were ever allowed to enter.

Even though I knew it wouldn’t be this easy, I still tried to open the door to the other two rooms, hoping it would simply give in like the other two did.

As much as I rattled and pressed my body weight against the sturdy metal door, it didn’t move, nothing did.

For a while I just paced around the empty garage, trying to go through every possibility I had to get to the inside of the last two mystery rooms.

My time was running out, it had been quite a while now and if I didn’t hurry up my mother would come and find me snooping around the place.

Suddenly, I remembered something. I grabbed the ladder that was leaning against one of the walls and brought it outside. I positioned it against the cool stone of the garage and started climbing up. My fear of heights was shoved aside by the adrenaline rush that I suddenly felt when my eyes finally adjusted to the darkness, and I saw the tiny window in the roof that I was searching for.

Carefully I slid it open and sucked my breath in, trying to make myself as small as possible, barely fitting through the window. Luckily, I didn’t fall as I originally anticipated but I landed on what felt like something weirdly fleshy, the sensation making me jump and fall hard onto my back. I desperately searched for my flashlight and then I felt something touch my hand, but it wasn’t the cool metal that I had hoped for.  
Although I couldn’t see it, it felt sickly, fleshy and as if it was oozing some unknown liquid onto my hand and as I scrambled to my feet, I couldn’t help but scream as I bumped into another fleshy substance behind me.

Not only did it feel like I was being pressed against meat, but it felt alive, squirming against my skin and enveloping me inside of it.

I dropped back onto my knees, trying desperately to escape the sensation and a sigh of relief left my lips as I grabbed hold of my flashlight which I instinctively turned on.

“What the...”

The room seemed to move, it convulsed, retracted back into itself and them outwards. The walls were covered in what looked like layers of human skin, hairs poking out of the thousands of pores.

I felt something press against the back of my neck and I turned around immediately. A pair of eyes was staring into mine.

In the brief moment in which I dared to look at whatever this *thing* was I saw that its head was attached to a mass of disgustingly pulsing meat that was connected to the walls of the room, if you could even call it that.

The head was looking barely human, almost like a bad mimic, in the way its skin was drooping over its features, the hole where the mouth would normally be constantly shifting, opening and closing, the flesh started bubbling and an animalistic growl left the creature.

I let out one last scream before scrambling back towards the tiny window in the roof, I felt disgusted as I stepped on the mountains of meat that formed and retracted but I knew it was my only way out. There was no furniture for me to climb on, only flesh.

I tried to pull myself up and right before I was able to get out, I felt something biting at my ankle. I suppressed another scream and simply held onto the roof tiles, begging for this nightmare to finally be over. I could hear my bones crushing as it kept gnawing at my ankle, but I still held on and thankfully I was able to finally pull myself out of the room.

I saw that my ankle was torn apart but my brain didn’t register it right away, the adrenaline still pushing me forward.

 

I don’t remember how I made it back into the house, but I cut off the blood circuit to the rest of my leg with an old shirt and the pain is slowly fading.  
  
I think I know what these boxes in apartment two were and even if I’m wrong it doesn’t matter because

The front door just opened.

 

She’ll find me
