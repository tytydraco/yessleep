As I stared out of the window, a dog was sleeping on that cold-hearted night, the same dog that was crying just a moment ago, probably, failed to fill his stomach again but what really amazed me was that he never loses his hope, does he is not known to the unidentified emotion of hopelessness or is he just strong enough to overpower it?

I have waited long enough to get the strength to kill this feeling but this monster is in my blood now, I tried to suppress it but I am not the dictator of my own body anymore, days feel long, the night feels suffocated.

I was happy that finally, something was in my control, and finally, I had decided without getting afraid. A spark of hope struck me when I picked up that rope from my table’s box but while it was grabbing me, around my neck a deep ball of thoughts hit my head, the face of my helpless mom hiding from my dad, the face of my user who cheated me, the face of a failure, the face of my bully but now, I am not a loser anymore, I will win from this monster but I don’t think that even hell will accept me.

As I kicked the chair away from my feet, that rope held me tighter and tighter as a trustful father, a feeling that I had never felt before, I could see the world disappearing in front of my eyes but there was peace, a peace which I have never experienced in my life, the silence of not able to think anything else, air holding me around my body, it was the moment I realize that death is a lot easier and simple than living but I wondered what stopped me doing this till now…...

A sudden spark of light crashed into my eyes; a loud noise passed into my ears. I was in the hospital. I could see the nurse and said, why?

She gave me a shocked face, maybe she was expecting “who?” in the form of the question.

“There was a robbery in your neighbor’s house but your neighbor woke up because a street dog started barking at the thief, he saw that thief running into your apartment and he never saw him coming out. So, the police decided to ask from every house on that floor. They knocked on your house but you didn’t answer. So, they doubt that the thief was in your house but they found you like that,” she said.

I felt like a dead body thinking about that feeling which lasted for a few seconds in the end, I was still a loser, a loser who even lost to die.







I could hear those people from my past laughing and mocking me about my unsuccessful attempt. I fell I wanna sink and fall in my hollowness more and more while writing this and wish that I never open my eyes today after closing them forever.
