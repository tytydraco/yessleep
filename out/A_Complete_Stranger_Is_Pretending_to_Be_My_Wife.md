From the moment I woke up that fateful Thursday, I knew something was off with Ellie. Her smile was too precise, her laughter a tad too mechanical. It was as if the woman I had loved for a decade had been meticulously replaced overnight by an exact, soulless duplicate.

As days passed, the evidence mounted. She'd forget the small, intimate details of our life together, like our inside jokes or the story of how we met, brushing it off with a laugh that sent chills down my spine. Her eyes, once warm and inviting, now seemed to peer into me, calculating, cold. I found unfamiliar clothes in our closet, and her taste in food changed overnight. It was as if she was learning to be Ellie, but failing.

My heart raced with terror at the thought. What had happened to my wife? And more importantly, was I next? The thought consumed me, gnawing at my sanity. I had to act, to escape, to save myself from being replaced by whatever entity had taken Ellie.

The morning jog was our routine, a path through the quiet woods near our home. It was there I decided to confront this imposter. As we ran, the silence between us was suffocating. Then, as the sun began to rise, casting long shadows between the trees, I stopped, facing her. The imposter smiled Ellie's smile, but I wasn't fooled.

"Milo, you're scaring me," the imposter Ellie said. 

In a moment of pure terror and desperation, I did what I thought I had to do. I attacked, plunging the knife into her, again and again, until the imposter lay motionless, her blood staining the leaves. I stumbled back, panting, the reality of my actions crashing down on me.

I returned home in a daze, setting fire to the life we had built together, trying to erase the existence of the entity that had dared to replace my Ellie. As the flames engulfed our home, I waited outside for the police, the fire reflecting in my empty gaze.

The standoff with the police was brief but tense. Cornered and desperate, I almost welcomed the end. But they took me alive, demanding answers I didn't have.

The explanation from the psychiatrists is like a slap in the face. Capgras Syndrome, they said. A delusion that loved ones have been replaced by imposters. But how could they not see? This wasn't a delusion; it was survival. They tried to convince me, to show me evidence, but I knew better. Ellie was gone, taken from me, and I was alone in a world that refused to see the truth.

The days blended together in the sterile, suffocating environment of the padded cell. The monotony was broken only by the visits from doctors who spoke to me with feigned empathy, their eyes betraying their true thoughts. They saw me as a case study, a man lost to his own mind. But within that confinement, my resolve only hardened. Ellie's memory, the life we shared, fueled my determination. I wasn't going to rot in a cell. I needed to find the truth.

Escape seemed like a fantasy until I noticed a pattern. The guards, complacent in their routines, became predictable. There was a brief window during shift changes when their attention wavered. I started feigning progress, engaging more with the staff, slowly earning their trust, and with it, a slight relaxation of their vigilance.

One evening, as the guards changed shifts, I seized my moment. Using a makeshift blade I had hidden away, I managed to unlock the door. The halls were dimly lit, the majority of the staff focused on the more troubled patients. Moving with a quiet desperation, I navigated through the maze of corridors, blending into a group of night-shift workers to avoid detection. The exit loomed ahead, a beacon of freedom. 

Then, out of the shadows, an orderly stepped into my path, a young man whose face flickered with recognition and alarm at my presence. "Hey, you shouldn't be here," he shouted. 

Without thinking, I lunged forward, my crude weapon in my hand finding its mark. A gasp escaped him as he stumbled back, clutching at his side, shock and betrayal in his eyes. I didn't pause to see him fall.

With a racing heart, I pushed through the doors into the cool night air, disappearing into the shadows.

I keep moving, avoiding the light, the people, the life I used to know. My days are spent in hiding, my nights scouring the internet in dingy internet cafes, researching anything that might lead me to Ellie. I wear my anonymity like armor, always aware that one slip could send me back to the confines of that cell.

They say I’m a madman, a killer. But I know the truth. I did what I had to do. And if I had the chance, I'd do it all over again. For Ellie.
