For some, retirement is a long awaited dream. A chance to finally put their careers behind them and focus on anything but the job they toiled away at for decades.

But for me, retirement had always been something I'd dreaded. A ticking clock that was rapidly approaching, day by day. A deadline to solve a decade-old cold case, to catch the serial killer responsible for it, and finally bring closure to the mystery.

In the end, I wasn't able to solve the case in time, lacking enough evidence to pin it on its number one and only suspect, Milton Aster, who just so happened to die of old age one month before the very retirement date that I had long promised my wife, Ada.

So, the day after my retirement party, I did what any right-minded ex-detective would do, and went to the auction for the suspected serial killer's estate.

"Going once. Going twice. Sold! To Mr. McKenna." The auctioneer called out, to the horror of my wife, who knew exactly what I was undoubtedly up to.

"Are you out of your mind?" Ada asked.

"You have to be, to be in my line of work." I explained.

"Luckily, it's not your line of work anymore. You know, retirement is supposed to be about forgetting your work, and finding new hobbies.”

"This will be... something of a new hobby."

"New? You've been hunting this guy for nearly a decade now, Theodore. It's time to let it go."

“I will, after we move in, and finally put this case to rest."

“We? You expect me to move in there with you?”

A month later, my wife and I moved into the home, with just a couple bags.

‘Cause the thing is, with no will or beneficiaries, and an unpaid mortgage, not only was Milton Aster's house put up for auction, but it came fully furnished. Furniture, personal possessions, you name it. Everything down to the kitchen sink. Literally.

And when we finally got the keys and stepped inside, we discovered exactly what you'd expect to find inside a suspected serial killer’s home. Cat piss on the rugs. Rotten food in the fridge. And of course… a heaping mound of junk.

But the truth is, I wasn’t interested in Milton Aster’s personal belongings.

No, if my suspicions were correct, there was something much more important inside the house… more accurately... under the house.

…"The Labyrinth."

—

You see, back in the day, whenever the serial killer, or so we called him, had kidnapped a victim, he only ever left behind one cryptic symbol… a maze. A detail which we at the police department, kept under wraps, until a proper connection could be found. For all anyone else knew, any disappearances over the years were disaparate and unrelated. But we knew the truth. We knew that somewhere out there... was a serial killer.

And in no time at all, I had started referring to him internally at the police department as… “The Minotaur.”

Convinced that the maze symbol implied that the killer was burying his victims inside some sort of maze-like structure, I became obsessed with finding one.

All I had to do, was locate the “The Minotaur”’s “Labyrinth."

So when Milton Aster became our number one suspect, we raided his home, multiple times, always combing his basement for any sign of an entrance to an underground layer.

Each time, to no avail.

But now that I lived in that very home, I had a second chance. To scour the suspected serial killer’s basement for the entrance to the “Labyrinth” that my former self could never find.

—

The basement was disgusting, and revolting, and exhausting to go through, but I somehow found the process exhilarating.

And so I, along with Ada, who begrudgingly lended a hand, began rummaging through the suspected serial killer’s cellar, searching for any sign of an entrance to what I was convinced was a “Labyrinth.”

But after searching and searching for weeks on end, I eventually resolved to give up…

“You were right. I just have to come to terms with it.” I said, as I sat beside Ada on the house’s rear deck, looking out at the backyard, and wallowing in defeat.

"No.” Ada replied. “We have to keep going.”

Normally, I would have been surprised to hear my wife make such a statement. But in the weeks that we’d spent searching the house, she had somehow become even more obsessed with the mystery than me, and was determined to solve it.

“But where?” I asked.

That’s when my wife stood up, and looked out at “The Minotaur”’s backyard, squinting.

“That patch of grass out there, in the center of the lawn, looks different than the rest.”

I nearly fell out of my seat, trying to hop up to take a look.

*The backyard.* I thought to myself. *We had always been so obsessed with his basement, that we completely overlooked what had been staring us in the face the whole time.*

A few minutes later, Ada rolled up a square patch of artificial turf in the center of the backyard, revealing a wooden hatch… that opened into the ground.

I looked at Ada with wide eyes. In one month’s time, she had done what I couldn’t do in ten years. Then, a look of horror washed over my face, as I realized what we had actually unearthed.

She had found “The Minotaur’s” “Labyrinth.”

—

A few minutes later, we were standing in the entrance of what was clearly a man-made underground cavern, having opened the hatch and descended down a pair of rickety, wooden stairs.

Before us, a cramped, claustrophobic tunnel led off into darkness.

“Should we call the police?” Ada asked, shaking nervously.

“Not yet.” I replied, holding a flashlight in one shaking hand, and a revolver in the other. I was, after all, a retired policeman myself.

I shined the light up ahead.

Sure enough, about twenty feet away, the passage split in two, leaving us with two choices… left and right.

“It is a fucking maze.” I clarified.

“Well you were right about that.” My wife commended me.

“So which is it?” I asked her. “Left or right?”

“I’m gonna have to go with…” She began, pulling a coin from her pocket, tossing it in the air, and letting it fall to the dirt. “Left.”

“Left it is.”

—

Once we began to explore the maze, I immediately realized that terrifying things likely awaited us inside, and warned my wife.

But when we reached the end of the left passage, and arrived at a dead end, it became immediately apparent that what awaited us was far more terrifying than I had even suspected.

There, at the end of the tunnel, illuminated by nothing but my flashlight and tied to an old rocking chair, sat one of the serial killer's victims… still alive, an IV protruding from his arm and leading to a medical bag that was mounted on the wall, his eyes squinting in the glare of the flashlight.

“What the fuck.” I whispered to my wife. “They’re all down here. And they’re all still alive.”

Chills ran down my spine, as I placed my gun in my belt, took Ada by the hand, and rushed over to help the sickly man.

"Are you okay?" Ada asked him.

"Who did this to you?" I added.

But the man was much too weak to utter a reply.

"Don't worry, we'll get you out of here!" I said, reasoning that, given his proximity to the hatch, we should free him and bring him up to the house, before continuing any further into the labyrinth.

"This may sting a little." Ada said to the man, as she signaled me to rip the IV bag from the wall.

But as soon as I did, we heard a peculiar sound.

THWACK.

"Wait..." I began.

"Was that..." Ada replied...

...As we both realized that removing the sickly man's IV bag had triggered the hatch to close from above.

I wandered back to the maze's entrance and, sure enough, as I shone my flashlight on the hatch, saw that it had closed, and attempting to open it, found it locked from the inside.

When I got back to Ada, she could immediately tell by my body language... that we were in trouble.

"Locked?" She asked.

"Locked." I replied.

—

A few minutes later, we once again found ourselves venturing into the darkness, this time down the right passage, left with no other choice but to finish what we started, the sickly man hobbling along with us, still too weak to let out a word.

It wasn't long before we reached another fork in the road, so to speak, and we were forced to make yet another choice. Left. Or right.

But rather than flip a coin, our decision was made easy, as we began to hear a noise emanating from the right passage, as it grew louder... and louder... and louder...

Until...

"AAARGHHH!"

...We could hear whatever it was, grunting and howling, as it's seemingly enormous body could be heard charging closer... and closer... and closer..

The sound of it alone sent my body into fight or fight, as adrenaline began to course through my body, my heart rate spiked, and my breath grew short.

"What the fuck is that sound?" I whispered to Ada.

"Whatever it is, thanks to the trap, it knows we're here now." My wife whispered back.

"We've got to run!" I called out, as I signaled for both Ada and the sickly man to follow me down the left passage.

My wife heeded my call, but the sickly man...

Well... the poor sickly man...

...Didn't stand a chance, as a massive hulking, monstrosity of a man, his face shrouded in darkness, came barreling around the corner, sword in hand...

...Yes, an actual, fucking sword, its blade worn, its metal rusted...

...And proceeded to hack the man to pieces, as Ada and I watched on in horror, trying to make sense of what was going on, and what the fuck that thing could possibly be.

That's when, as the giant dropped what was left of the sickly man's body to the ground, it turned...

...And looked at us.

"Run!" I called out to Ada, as I pointed to the left passage.

My wife took off into the darkness, as I caught one last glance at the monster, and its weapon, and followed Ada, [deeper into the labyrinth.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/3CxsKrPggs)
