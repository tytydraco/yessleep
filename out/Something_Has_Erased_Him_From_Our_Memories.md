I’m writing this diary because there’s a possibility I’m going crazy. I might’ve suffered a severe memory loss today. I don’t even know where to start.  
	  
I remember being in a middle of a tall, dark forest with my best friend, Scott. The problem is, I have no idea how I got there. I remember going to sleep yesterday, but I don’t know what happened afterward.    
	  
“Hey, Scott. What the fuck are we doing here?” I asked him.  
	  
“No idea, mate,” he shook his head in shock. “I… don’t remember. I don’t even remember what I did a few minutes ago. The last thing I remember is… is yesterday evening, when I went to sleep.”  
	  
“Yeah, same. What the fuck is going on?”  
	  
“Are we drugged?” Scott glanced at me.  
	  
“No, my head is 100% clear, I just don’t remember anything from today. Let’s just… get back home, eh?”  
	  
“Someone’s missing.”  
	  
“What?” I raised my eyebrows.  
	  
“I feel like… there should be someone else here… with us. But I don’t remember who.”  
	  
As he said this, I had the same feeling. I still don’t remember how we got into that forest, but there were three of us. Me, Scott… and someone else, but for fuck’s sake, I can’t remember who. We later went back to our homes and texted a few common friends if they know something, but they all thought we were just drunk or high (or both).  
	  
Needless to say, I’m not getting any sleep today, it’s already past midnight, and my thoughts are keeping me awake.

Today I went to a pub with Scott to talk about this strange incident with each other.   
  
“Look, first we have to know who was the third person with us,” Scott said.  
  
“Are you sure there was a third person? I mean, I remember the same, but maybe it’s just our minds playing games with us.”  
  
“I’m sure. It’s like I can almost name the guy, but I just can’t remember his name or appearance.”  
  
 “Okay, then… I don’t know, let’s look through our high school classmates, we met most of our common friends there, so…”  
  
“Good idea, mate, good idea.”  
  
Luckily, I had the list of our classmates saved on my phone, so I opened the file and started reading the names.  
  
“No, I haven’t talked to him since our graduation, no, not her either, she’s in Japan,” Scott kept shaking his head as he read the names.   
  
“Yeah, I’m sure it wasn’t any of them,” I said as we finished the list.  
  
“But wait,” Scott interrupted. “There are 22 names on your list. We had 23 students in our class.”  
  
“True,” I responded. He was right. I remembered it, too. It was impossible to forget, 23 students, and 24 chairs in the classroom, we kept one more just in case we broke one. “But who’s missing from the list?”  
  
We sat there for like an hour, trying to remember our 23rd classmate from high school, but we just… forgot who it was.   
  
Now it’s evening, and I’m home again, browsing through my friends on social media, trying to find our missing classmate. Now I’m sure it was him. Our 23rd classmate. He was the one with us in the forest.

Scott called me today.  
	  
“Morning, mate. Look, remember when in high school, we were walking home, and a homeless guy randomly offered to sell us cigarettes?”  
	  
“Hah, yeah, I remember,” I laughed. “And we bought…” I had to stop for a few seconds to catch my breath. “We bought… three cigarettes.”  
	  
“Exactly. Who was the third person with us?”  
	  
“I don’t know…”  
	  
“Mate, it’s fucking crazy. It’s like our friend just erased himself from reality. Like he never existed.”  
	  
“Is that even possible?”  
	  
“I don’t know, mate. This past few days… I don’t know.”

This morning, Scott knocked on my door.   
	  
“Hey, Scott,” I greeted him. “What’s up? Did you find something?”  
	  
“Look, we have to get back to that forest,” he said. To be honest, I thought it was a bad idea, so I tried to convince him otherwise.  
	  
“Scott, just, no.”  
	  
“Mate, I’m sure that guy was a friend of ours. And something happened to him. Something made him vanish from the past and present. And I think we both know that the last time we might’ve seen him was in that forest. Something happened there. Something terrible. We must find out. For him.”  
	  
“Scott, listen. If he even existed, like… ever, and something erased him from existence, whatever it was, a cosmic power, an alien, a witch, or the devil himself… then it can do the same to us. If we suffer the same fate…”  
	  
“He is our friend!”  
	  
“We don’t even know if he’s real!”  
	  
“I had two best friends for years. You and him. I’m 100% sure.”  
	  
“Just as I am,” I responded. He was right. The three of us were best friends, and still, we don’t remember anything about the third guy. Even if there was no hope to bring him back anymore, our curiosity proved to be more powerful than our survival instincts. Who or what is so powerful it can erase someone like this?  
	  
“Tomorrow,” Scott said. “We’re going to the forest tomorrow.”

Okay, so right now, we’re in that forest, I’m waiting here while Scott is inside a cave. He told me to write down everything while he’s inside.  
	  
We walked back to the exact place where we regained our memories more than a week ago. Scott quickly noticed a narrow, dark cave, leading somewhere under the ground.  
	  
“It seems familiar,” I said.  
	  
“Yeah. If you ask me, I think we were inside that cave before.”  
	  
“You don’t want to go inside, right?”  
	  
“I have to do it. I want to know what happened to him. Stay here and write down everything in your journal.”  
	  
“If you want to go there, I’ll go with you.”  
	  
“No. If I…” he stopped and closed his eyes for a few seconds. “If I get erased… like him… you have to tell everyone what happened. Your journal is the proof. Don’t worry, I’ll come back before you notice.”  
	  
So yeah, I’m sitting at the entrance of the cave, waiting for him to come back. I hope he does. Oh god, I hope he comes back.

Fuck, fuck, fuck.  
	  
I just couldn’t write anything more yesterday, ‘cause I just couldn’t process what happened. I’m still doubting my sanity. Maybe… maybe I’m just crazy. That would be much easier to accept.   
	  
One minute, I just found myself in the forest, sitting at the entrance of a cave, and had no idea how I got there. After a few minutes of thinking, I just went back home. Then I found a journal in my backpack. It’s probably mine. It’s my writing, and… it looks like it had already happened once on the 17th of January. I wrote it down, and I somehow still forgot about it until I read the journal.  
	  
I read the whole thing. And I was writing about my best friend Scott in every entry. I never had a friend called Scott. At least, I don’t remember. For fuck’s sake, [what is happening?](https://www.reddit.com/r/polgari/)
