I knew it inside me, there was something buried here. I can't explain it this feeling, but I felt drawn here, like it was calling me in and was calling me out of my own normality. So i came here tonight, with just one thing in mind, to find this hidden evil I knew was out here in this dark, damp night.

I started walking over to the spot and squatted so i could look closer at the little rocks near my feet. I bent down and looked at the rock next to me. The rock this was bigger than the others around it, and i was squatting down to get a better look at it when i made a little noise. My worry came to me like fire in my mind, and i felt an unwelcome anxiety come over me, because there, by the rock where i was expecting to find the evil, was nothing there. I jumped back up and examined my surroundings even more closely, but there was nothing there. I squatted down, and in front of a rock, there was only empty air, and i could feel a strong wind coming from the area around me, i knew, who knows.

I stood up, and walked around the rocks, careful not to make the same stupid noise again. Still nothing was there. I looked around and figured the only way i could figure this one out why i thought i heard something but now i can't see it, is to get right down to the ground, on my hands and knees, and search.

I finished my circle around the rocks, and at the end i was just a few feet from where I started, but my worry didn't go away, and i felt like I wasn't getting close to anything I wanted to be. I looked at my feet and bent even closer to the ground, so i can see some of the little rocks, better. I was thinking at this spot in the ground, when something moved. It was something evil, and it was about 5 feet away from me.

I looked up and my heart dropped, and my eyes started a trail along the ground to the end, when i saw it. It had moved just a little, now only 50 paces away, and its form was huge, big and long and wide, his blue eyes were burning with fire and it's wide stretchy wings were close to me. I crawled further off the end of the cave and lifted my face to the sky I screamed in fear and anxiety and full dismay at the thing before me. I ran for the opening for now hiding somewhere behind the small hill of stones. I looked up to the sky, and I couldn't move or even see this thing, but I felt it was watching me. I was afraid and run, I moved my legs quickly but in a blur of a stone, I fell. I went to get up and go again but i felt a little pain in my leg, so I stopped and pulled my pant leg up and looked around and this is what I saw. My leg that was in pain was covered in blood, but it wasn't mine, or my blood.

I heard a growling and the evil monster above me, moved to the side and let out a blood curdling scream, and I heard a loud thump to the ground behind me and the creatures eyes suddenly glowed red. I got away from the opening of the cave, but I felt his breath, was on my neck, he was close. I ran for the opening, I had to get away. I'm unknowingly running for my life now. I turn to look behind me and I see the monster, and i felt his hot breath on my neck, When it happened, it was like a thunder strike had shot out of my chest and run out of me at my feet. I had to get up and run away now.

I was running away from the evil, the monster was coming at me and the ground stopped. the sky was upside down and I felt like there was a huge weight on my chest. I fell, and I could feel my chest again being crushed and my neck, when the monster was looking straight at me, i saw his eyes turn red and I was watching this crazy monster come at me. he made these loud sound like a heartbeat that was coming out of somewhere inside him. I felt his huge , wide, long, fingers pull at me and I ran as hard as I could screaming for my life. He had suddenly stopped and I saw a little cloud of dust form around him and i looked up to see something I thought was a house and next thing i knew i had slid down a hill and was making a small noise.

I was trying to get up and run again and I saw something in the air. It looked like a black shadow, something long and wide and when the moon shone through it I saw it was a rock. It fell, and I could hear it but i couldn't open my eyes. I felt at my neck and there was something there again, swinging back and forth and I felt a bit more pain there and it was this big tall rock. I knew it was coming and i felt it was near my neck, i lifted my head and the rock was right there. I could see the evil blue eyes in its rock form, and the face of my dream appeared again. I couldn't move and I couldn't scream. But then, I saw something across the black, bloody waters, standing in the trees and dust, and when it spoke, it told me to get up and run again.

I felt the rock get away, and I was moving slowly. I started to crawl, slowly moving my hands through the dirt, then I tried to run, but i tripped and fell. Somehow, I was up, running for my life. I was back to where I started the night, and I prayed that this evil would not follow me. I never stopped looking behind me, my heart beating out of my chest, my eyes looked funny. 

Then I was off again, running for my life trying to get away from this evil, and i heard him scream in frustration. He was angry being left behind. I didn't want to find out what would happen if he caught me, but I had to keep going, i couldn't stop. I couldn't stop just long enough to catch my breath, but then I saw something that made me slow down and stop. Something was coming out of the deepest, darkest shadows of the trees, and when i saw it, I stopped. For a moment, I though i had to be imagining what I was seeing, but then, i knew, I had to be seeing it. But it would'nt be real, it just kept coming, closer and closer and just before i was going to look down to see if i was running in a dream, i felt myself on my back. The thing was towering above me and its arms were long and wide and starting from my neck I could feel something rubbing my chest. It lifted me up from my neck and there were two blood red eyes, black teeth, and a terrifying face of death. I felt it dragging me away and I knew i couldn't win. I felt myself being pulled to a spinning black pit, a vortex that was twisting pictures of everything and moving them in a smooth motion, and i felt myself falling.

I didn't know where i was, but i needed to get up. I opened my eyes and it was dark, i had no idea where i was, and i didn't know where the monster was. I was dripping in blood, so i stood and ran to get away again but i was stopped again. I saw something move, something transparent and purple in the dark reaching down to grab me. I felt so cold and i couldn't move and all of a sudden, i woke up.

I woke up in my bed, and i looked around, in the dark at my room. I felt a tingling in my leg and i went to it and i was confused, my leg was bleeding and there was a burn in my neck, but i wasn't hurt at all. I went to my closet, and the picture was still there the thing I had seen. I touched it casually, and it jumped out of my hand and fell to the floor. I stared at it for a minute, and it was still there. I picked it up and looked at it, but not on the picture, I looked at the back of my eyes, and I could make out what it was that I had seen. It looked like a snake, but only half a snake. It was a snake that was wearing clothes and it had dark hair and green eyes. The face looked in my eyes, but I couldn't tell who it was that was staring at me.

I put the picture back on the dresser and went to my computer. I opened the website that the picture popped up on, the picture I saw was on their dark web site. The picture showed a picture of a snake that was half in a desk, it was watching my picture in glitched colors. The website only showed one picture, but it showed a white room, with a large mirror, and the snake was sitting on a black chair in the center of a calm white room. The snake was staring into the mirror, it didn't move, but i saw other stuff behind the mirror, images of other things, colors and shapes. I was fascinated with it, and I felt it wanted me to go in there.

I didn't want to though, I feared the snake would hurt me. I felt something popping in my chest and i ran off to my room, and I fell back to my bed. The voice was in my head again, and this time i wasn't unbelieving it, i felt like it had no way it could be a dream. I moved away from the picture, I tried running again, and i tripped and fell. When i tried again, I fell, but didn't get hurt. I ran, and i tried to open the door. It wouldn't open, and I saw the snake staring at me again, telling me to come back. I felt it try to grab my neck, and I kept trying to move away from it. The snake couldn't touch me, but it was grabbing at me, and I was feeling the chills again. They wouldn't stop, and when i finally made it to my door, I slammed the door and walked away. I looked out my window and saw something in the shadows, something looking at me.

I walked slowly to the living room and i heard the strange noise again in my room. It was the snake and it was looking at me from my closet, staring at me from the mirror. I watched him and in my mirror I saw the evil from my dream again, the face of death. I was scared and seemed like in a hurry. I looked back at the mirror and the snake was gone, but the face was still there, looking at me again. I saw it looking at my reflection and trying to look past it. I tried to move in the mirror, but there was something blocking the way. I could see, but i couldn't move. I saw the eye in the sea of darkness that was in the mirror, the eyes were blue, and looked like they were staring at me and they were trying to tell me something, but i couldn't hear them and I couldn't understand them. The mirror started to turn and I heard it screaming, screaming in a place where I couldn't hear it. In my closet, I saw the evil face again, and in the mirror, I saw a small hand reaching out, trying to stop the red eye in the mirror, the red eye was trying to escape the small hand and the face was starting to fade into the darkness.

I saw that the mirror, was not just a mirror being reflected, it was being held, someone was holding it open for me to walk in and join the darkness. I walked though in a sea of blue lights and i felt myself go on the mirror, and the image behind my eyes was from the other side. I lost track of where i was, and i knew i was in the mirror. The room was spinning, and i was trying to catch on to my senses, but it kept moving. I was there for a long time, and i felt like i was going to fall over. Instead, i woke up again, in the mirror room again. I was amazing that i was there, i felt as if i was there for a whole lifetime, but then i saw it, something different, i saw a small hand, a teeny tiny hand and i reached out, and the little hand picked up mine and held it, and then i saw the face. I saw it clearly this time, it was a little boy, with brown eyes, and long brown hair. He was smiling and he told me he was my brother, that he was really young and that he had been there for a long time. I looked at him closely, and I saw the image, but now he didn't have green eyes and he had brown eyes, more beautiful than i've ever seen, i felt like he was a gift to me, a gift to find. I only wanted to hold him and never let him go.
