People are stupid. I know, I sound like a cynical douche, mostly because I am a cynical douche. I’m well aware that the average person is dumb as shit. I’m no Einstein myself but even as someone with slightly above average intelligence, I’ve figured out how to control people into believing what I want them to believe, which I suppose in this case is my downfall. 

I made a stupid mistake, a BIG stupid mistake. I mistook advanced crazy for regular crazy, and now I have to deal with the consequences. 

A few months ago I went to a party at my buddys house. It was relatively casual, BYOB, not a huge deal. I hadn’t drank in a while, and a friend of mine brewed his own, very potent, IPA, which got me buzzed pretty early on. 

Enter Luna. She was hot, in that crazy girl kind of way. Massive chest, skinny little waist, not much of an ass, but it was firm and her yoga pants hugged it beautifully. She had soft blond hair that went down to her waist and pale, blemish-free skin. 

She approached me, which is usually a bit of a turn off. I enjoy the hunt, setting my sights on one particular girl and making her want me. Luna already knew she wanted me, it took away the game, but I was buzzed and she was cute, so I went with it. 

I let her ramble on about her interests, feigning interest while mentally undressing her, strategizing my best plan of attack. Eventually we took an uber back to my place and had a thoroughly enjoyable time. She was more of a freak than I pegged her for, and I got to do a few things that most girls reject even the idea of. 

The next morning I woke up surprisingly not hungover in an empty bed. Pleased that my overnight guest must have snuck out, I stretched, climbed out of bed and headed to the kitchen on a quest for coffee. 

It was the moment that I reached the kitchen that I realized the full extent of crazy that I was dealing with. Luna was in my kitchen, squatting on my kitchen table, staring at my toaster. The springs popped up with a soft ding, her eyes opening wide as the toast rose.

“Uh, hey there.” I waved slightly, grabbing her attention.

Luna grinned widely before literally hopping off of the counter. She grabbed a piece of toast and bit it before sticking her pointer finger directly into the raspberry jam and sucking it off of her finger.

“Hey there!” She giggled, “You sleep a lot.”

“Well it’s the weekend, I don’t sleep that much during the week.” I shrugged. How long had she been up? I wondered how much of my shit she had gone through. “Anyway, I have some plans today . . .” I trailed off, hoping she took the hint. She did not.
After her odd breakfast, Luna skipped to the living room and laid over the back of the couch, feet in the air, hair pooling on the ground, staring at the shut off television. She really was an odd glass of water, and I was no longer in the mood to take a sip. It was Saturday and all I wanted was to kick back and watch garbage tv in my underwear, sans the manic pixie dream girl doing awkward yoga on the sofa. 

Like I said, I’m aware that I’m a cynical douche. I rationally know that I should have just asked her to leave, but at that moment I wasn’t really thinking rationally. So I employed a plot that had worked so many times before. I had to out-crazy her.

“Hey Luna?” I said, heading into the living room and sitting down next to her head. “I have to tell you something.”

She turned to look at me quizzically. 

“I know this might seem a little weird, but after we shared such a magical night, I felt the need to tell you . . .” I looked her dead in the eyes. “I’m a messenger sent here by the one true god, Lozo.”

Luna’s eyes got really wide, she did a quick crunch before pivoting into a sitting position. I figured that would be that. She would leave and I would have the day to myself. She did not. 

“Oh?” She asked, with genuine interest. 

“Yes.” I nodded, deciding that commiting was the only way to go. “Lozo wants everyone to know who he is, and it’s my job to spread his message so that we can all ascend to Blurp and live with Lozo forever.”

Luna just nodded.

“When you approached me last night, I knew that you were perfect for Lozo’s message. I can see in your eyes that you have the heart of the Lozonites, just like me.” I laid it on thick. “Would you embark on this mission with me?”

“Absolutely.” Luna said reverently, her eyes locked with mine. 

I spent the next few hours telling her the rules of Lozonism, which I made up on the spot, with the intention of turning her off. Lozonites were expected to only eat during odd hours, never even. Blue foods were never allowed. Lozonites needed to bathe at least three times daily, and never ever bite their fingernails. They also were not permitted to wear silk or t-shirts with words on them except on tuesdays. Lastly, Lozonites didn’t own anything, everything belonged to Lozo.

Not only did none of this turn Luna away, she became more enraptured with every ridiculous lie I spun. I was at a loss. Eventually I just started ignoring her and going about my day. We ended up sleeping together again later that night because she was hot and I was weak.

Luna spent the next few weeks at my place, it seemed as though she was always there, even when I was working. After a while I almost didn’t even mind her. 

One day when I got home from a stressful day there were two more girls in my house than when I Ieft. Luna introduced them as Star and Rainbow (names which I assume were about as real as Lozonism), but I didn’t particularly care. They were hot, crazy hot, and they believed me to be a prophet. I knew that the crazy foursome that happened that night was wrong, but somehow I just managed to quiet my conscience.

Over the next few weeks it seemed like every day there were more and more people in my house, but they were all so pleasant and helpful that I kind of started to like it. I even started telling them made up stories about Lozo and the things he wished of us. I know, it was wrong, and a little insane, but I was having fun and sleeping with a different girl every night. 

Here’s where my problem set in though, I forgot how crazy these people were! It wasn’t long before they started fighting for my attention, competing to prove who was the most devoted. I couldn’t get five minutes of peace and quiet. The men were always fighting to be my right hand man, the women fighting to share my bed. 

Soon there were whispers of a Lozonite who spoke to Lozo. His name was Xyn, I think that Star’s recruit Dave brought him in, it was hard to keep track. Xyn said that he had spoken to Lozo who started to ask him to get the followers to do things for him. One day I came home to find two dozen people in my living room humming the same note . . . which they proceeded to do for hours. They claimed they were trying to tune in to Blurp. Another day I found them recording Eminem songs and playing them backwards, singing along . . .loudly. Xyn even started questioning my devotion. 

I was done, beyond done. I had let this go on for long enough, not putting a stop to it for a myriad of reasons that seem ridiculous to me now. I called everyone for a meeting. Somehow we had amassed over fifty members. They all gathered in my living room, sitting on the furniture and floor and coffee table. I hated them all. 

I told them that Xyn was a false prophet. That Lozo told me that he had never spoken to Xyn and that we needed to reject him. Xyn protested, but Luna stood up for me, after all I was the one true messenger. A din of agreement washed over the crowd.

I’ll admit that I lost control of what happened then. I don’t know how. I guess I knew that I couldn’t stop fifty some angry people. They grabbed Xyn by the arms and legs and hoisted him above the now standing crowd. They duck-taped him to the wall while chanting for Lozo. Bacara grabbed Xyn’s chin, holding it in place. I looked away as he pulled out Xyn’s tongue and sliced it off. 

“For speaking lies about Lozo!” He growled, and the crowd chanted his words back.

Comet took the knife from Bacara and and placed it into Xyn’s cheek, gliding it underneath his eye and popping it from its place, then the other.

“For refusing to see the truth of Lozo!” He sneered, and the crowd chanted his words back.

Luna took the knife from comet and placed it on Xyn’s chest, driving it into his heart. 

“For not allowing Lozo into your heart!” She cried, and the crowd chanted her words back.

Xyn’s head dropped, blood dripping from multiple points of his lifeless body. Luna lowered her mouth to the chest wound and drank his blood with relish, soon others followed, some drinking directly from the source, others bringing various cups to the wounds, getting a taste of his body. I had lost control of my cult. 

Eventually I just went to bed, I’m not sure what the Lozonites did with Xyn’s body, they probably ate it or some shit. I don’t know and I don’t care. I know it won’t be long before the police come for me. After all, these horrific events happened in my home, by members of my cult. I suppose the best thing to do is to schedule a group suicide, after all, if I’m going down, I might as well take everyone down with me. People are stupid, and I guess I’m [crazy.](https://www.facebook.com/d0nutblink/?view_public_for=753725504776902)
