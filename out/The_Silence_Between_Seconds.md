Being a detective sounds a lot cooler than it is. Most people picture cigarette smoke curling through the blinds, jazz on a scratchy record, maybe a trench coat flapping dramatically in the night. Truth is, I spend most of my nights trying to remember if I left wet laundry in the machine. I drink too much gas station coffee, and I’ve got exactly one suit that still fits without the buttons threatening to turn into shrapnel.

But every once in a while, the city decides to drop a little riddle on your desk. This one started three months ago.

A young woman, twenty-two, went missing from her apartment downtown. Pretty normal case on paper: no signs of forced entry, no broken windows, no screaming neighbors. The official report makes it sound like she just packed a bag and slipped away.

Except she didn’t.

When I got to her apartment, it felt wrong. Some places hum with absence, you know? Like they’re still echoing the last moments that happened there. Her bedroom was too neat, except for the wall.

Behind her bed, someone had cut a perfect square into the drywall. Too perfect to be accidental, too clinical to be angry. The insulation inside had been clawed apart, shredded like something had fought to get out—or in. Buried in the fluff, I found a strip of men’s pajama pants, blue and gray stripes, stained with something dark that wasn’t paint.

I bagged it. Logged it. Felt a little righteous, like the story was finally peeling open.

Two days later, when I checked the evidence room, the bag had disappeared. Clean. Like it never existed.

That’s when my lieutenant told me to “close the case.” He said it like a father telling his kid to stop asking why the dog went to the farm. Only his eyes said: drop it, or you’ll regret it.

Then a second missing person. Same neighborhood. Same age. Same file that screamed copy-paste.

I started noticing things no one else mentioned. Both apartments had cheap wall clocks in the living rooms—the kind you buy when you’re broke but want to pretend you’ve got your life together. And both clocks were broken, glass cracked, hands bent back like snapped fingers. Both frozen at 2:17.

That little detail gnawed at me. I didn’t tell anyone—not yet.

Instead, I followed up on the second girl’s apartment myself. The building smelled faintly of boiled cabbage and bad decisions, like most of the places I end up. Nothing unusual in the living room—except the clock. Frozen again, 2:17, like it was waiting for me.

When I leaned in to check it, the damn thing clicked. Just once.

I swear on my badge, the minute hand twitched forward, scraping across the broken glass. The sound was like a nail dragged across my teeth.

I left faster than I’d like to admit.

But here’s where things went from weird to dangerous.

A day later, I went back to re-check the first apartment. It was supposed to be empty—landlord had already re-listed it. But when I unlocked the door and stepped inside, I heard something. A sound that didn’t belong.

Someone breathing. Slow, steady, like they were trying not to be noticed.

My gun was in my hand before I knew it. I cleared the living room, the kitchen, the hall. Nothing. The bedroom, though… that’s where I froze.

The drywall square I’d found weeks before was bigger. Much bigger. The edges were raw, freshly cut, insulation spilling out like yellow guts.

And pressed into that insulation was a handprint. Small. Feminine. Fingertips bloody.

Then I heard movement—inside the wall. A shuffle, a drag, like knees and elbows scraping against wood.

I fired once into the drywall. The sound that came back wasn’t a scream. It was a laugh.

I don’t scare easy, but I left. I didn’t write it in my report. I didn’t tell my lieutenant. Because I already know how it’ll go: they’ll smile, nod, and quietly make me disappear too.

But I’ve been a cop too long to let a thing gnaw at me without biting back. I’ve walked enough alleys where the shadows smell like piss and rain, where the air carries a thousand whispered deals, to know silence is the weapon of men with power. Silence keeps graves shallow. Silence makes clocks stop at the same time in different rooms.

So I kept at it.

The girls all rented through the same shell company — no name on the paperwork but a P.O. box and an out-of-service number. Their landlords all swore they didn’t know shit about missing tenants, though their eyes said otherwise. One of them, a little bastard with nicotine-stained teeth, grinned when I pressed him. “Buildings settle,” he said. “People move. Time’s funny like that.”

Time. Always time.

It followed me. It whispered in corners. Clocks in pawn shops, flea markets, dumpsters. Cheap plastic faces cracked down the middle, hands wrenched back like broken fingers, all jammed at 2:17.

The city itself felt… wrong. Streets I’d walked for twenty years seemed off by a degree, like the horizon had tilted while I wasn’t looking. A church basement where I asked about a runaway reeked of mold and holy water, and nailed to a support beam was one of those clocks. Frozen, patient, its second hand twitching like a dying insect.

I started keeping copies of everything. Notes, photographs, lease records. My first piece of evidence — that strip of men’s pajama pants from the drywall — vanished from the evidence locker, but I kept my hands on the later finds. A Polaroid slid under my door one night: me, asleep in my bed, lamp burning, timestamped 2:47 a.m.

I live alone.

And the bastard who took the picture had stood at the foot of my bed to snap it.

I laughed when I saw it. Not because it was funny, but because sometimes you have to laugh at the hand pulling you into the grave.

But it wasn’t just pictures. The horror had teeth.

And then came the package.

A small box, left on my stoop before dawn. Inside: another strip of fabric, blood dried dark across it. And tucked beneath, a folded paper scrawled with block letters:

NOT MINE.

The handwriting was the same as the landlord’s, the one who told me “time’s funny.” Only this wasn’t a taunt. It looked like confession.

That night, I found fresh sawdust scattered across my living room floor. The bookshelf had been nudged an inch, and behind it a new hole gaped in the drywall — bigger than the last. I pulled the flashlight beam across it, and the light hit something pale, deep inside. A hand, small and feminine, pressed flat against the back of the cavity. Nails ragged, tips bloody.

It withdrew when my light touched it.

I’m not ashamed to say I stumbled back. Even men like me, who’ve waded through blood and smoke, feel the gravity of certain things. Some horrors demand respect.

Since then, my apartment hasn’t felt like mine. The air tastes of fiberglass and copper. At night, the pipes whisper, and the cat from next door sits outside my window, staring at the walls like it knows where the bodies are buried.

I followed the landlord one evening, out past the edge of town where the road forgets its name. He stopped at a storage unit and let himself in. When he left, I went inside.

I wish I hadn’t.

Stacked floor to ceiling were clocks, hundreds of them, all frozen at different times, all faces cracked like fractured skulls. And on wooden pallets, wrapped in tarps, were squares of drywall. Each labeled with a date and an address. Each bearing fingernail scratches in the insulation.

In the center of the room, laid out like an offering, was a sleeping bag. Torn open. Inside were scraps of fabric, the same blue-and-gray stripes I’d already seen, and a smell like mold and old blood. Beneath the shreds was another folded note:

WE TAKE WHAT WANTS OUT.

WE WAIT.

WE LISTEN FOR THE TICK.

WHEN IT STOPS, WE MAKE ROOM.

I left with that note burning a hole in my pocket.

Since then, the walls of my apartment have grown restless. I hear the slow crawl of knees and elbows. My kitchen clock died yesterday. Its hands are frozen at 2:17.

And last night, when I woke gasping in the dark, I found three crescent marks dug into the skin over my ribs. The shape of a grip. Too small to be mine.

I should’ve burned that note. Should’ve salted the storage unit and walked away. But walking away isn’t in my blood. Never has been.

I went back the next night. The place was empty, at least of people. But the clocks… Jesus. They’d shifted. All of them, thousands of little dead faces, were now fixed at the same time. 2:17. The tick-tick of a few still trying to breathe filled the room, like teeth chattering in the cold.

In the far corner, one pallet was uncovered. Fresh drywall, the cut square still damp at the edges. And leaning against it was a photograph pinned with a nail.

Me again. Only this time, not sleeping. This time, standing in that very unit, flashlight raised, mouth open like I’d just screamed.

I hadn’t taken the picture.

The drywall behind the photo flexed inward. A breath. A push. The sound of knuckles rapping from the inside, polite as a door-to-door salesman.

I ran. I don’t run often, not anymore, not with my knees the way they are. But I ran until my chest burned and the world blurred.

Now I sit at my desk, blinds drawn, typing this out. The walls here are too thin, too willing to bend when the night presses in. And I swear I hear that careful crawl again — knees and elbows dragging closer, the creak of studs straining.

Maybe they’ll take me tonight. Maybe the hole is already cut and I’m just waiting for the drywall to sigh open.

But I’m typing this out because someone needs to know. The girls didn’t vanish into thin air. They were taken into the walls, fed to something that moves like time and eats like silence.

And now it’s my turn.

If this account ends here — if the next thing you read is just empty space — understand this:

They don’t disappear. They get stored.

The clocks aren’t keeping time. They’re keeping count.

And when yours stops, the wall will already be waiting.

When the walls claim you, it won’t be quiet.

They will bend your air, drag your shadow through the floor,

and whisper in the spaces you thought were empty.

Time will not comfort you.

It will lean close, patient, and chew your life down to the bone,

until even the memory of your fear is too late to save you.
