My wife and I have been married for roughly 32 years. We met at 18 and have been inseparable. We have never fought, never argued, and there have never been any bad times. Honestly it sounds like a dream, and I have been living it. The love I have for her is unlike anything I have ever known in my life. 

We each have our boundries, per every couple. She doesn't go into my work shop, I don't go into her sewing room. Or she doesn't come in while I'm changing, and I don't go in while she bathes. Well, you get the picture. We have never questioned nor tried to push each other's boundries. 

We constantly praise each other, the communication is fantastic, and we are able to take constructive criticism. It's literally like a dream. But there's this old saying " If it seems to good to be true, that's because it is", and I got hit hard with that today. My entire world crashed down in front of me and there was nothing I could do about it.

Let me set the scene for you. We woke up at 5:30 like any other day. Cuddled for 30 minutes, and started our morning "get ready together" routine. Brushed our teeth, went down stairs for breakfast and coffee, went to the cars, kissed each other bye, and we went our separate ways. I completed the "project" I had been working on earlier than expected leaving me about 3 extra hours left in my normal work schedule. It couldn't have worked out better, per anything in my life. Today was our 32nd anniversary. So I decided to take those hours and plan a celebration. I'll admit it, I'm a hopless romantic, and she adores it. 
I went to the flower shop, and bought a bouquet of 32 roses. Then I made a trip to the bakery where I picked up 32 red velvet cupcakes. I then went to the store, and bought 32 strawberries, 2 steaks, a sack of white potatoes, fresh squash, and some of that dipping chocolate. I also made a stop by the jewelry section and picked out a rose gold necklace that had two hearts connected and engraved on them was "4 ever". One more stop to the liquor store, and I walked out with some Pink Shampagne. Once I had that, i made my way to the house and began to prepare dinner. 

I set a plate on each end of the table with two candles in between, and a dozen roses next to her plate. I went into the kitchen and sat the cupcakes in the middle of the island, and placed a chocolate covered strawberry ontop of each one. I then sat the necklace box in the middle, and sat another dozen roses behind them. I made my way to the bedroom, and started setting up a bath for her. Candles, essential oils of lavender and rosemary, and sat the last 8 roses on the edge of the tub. (I had to cut the stems shorter for this). Again, I'm hopeless.

As I made my way off the last step, I met her at the door. I hugged her, and began to proceed as we normally would. I took her coat, and put her shoes aaway, as she told me about how much she missed me. I carefully pulled a handkerchief out of my pocket and slipped it over her eyes. She giggled that sweet small giggle I love so much, and asked what I was doing, and I simply said it was a surprise. 

I guided her to the kitchen and pulled the handkerchief away. The feeling I got when I watched her eyes light up and shine was fulfilling, and exactly what I wanted to see. She squealed, and jumped into my arms telling me how much she loved and appreciated me. Once she let me go, I pulled the box off the cupcakes, and handed it to her. She opened it, and I saw tears form in her eyes. She told me how beautiful it was, as I placed it around her neck. A perfect fit. 

I then took her hand in mine, and walked her to the dinning room, where dinner was ready. She gasped and covered her mouth as if it was her first time witnessing something so beautiful. She looked at me with the happiest expression, and I placed my forehead on hers, and said Happy Anniversary my love. 

Dinner went by pretty quickly, as we were both famished. Once we were done I told her to leave it for me to clean up, and I lead her to the bathroom. Once she opened the door another gasp left her as she took in the scene. She once again threw her arms around me, and told me how much she loved everything I did for her. I told her I was going to go clean up while she enjoyed her bath, and would bring cupcakes up in about an hour. That way she could have plenty of time to relax. 

This is when things took a turn. Once I left the room I forgot to grab a dish cloth out of our closet. So I turned around and went to go back in. I pecked on the door, and got no reply, so I assumed she had gone into the bathroom. So I cracked the door to check, just to be sure, and I peaked my head into the room. The bathroom door is directly across from the bedroom door. 

What I saw terrified me. My wife had left the door open. I watched as she grabbed the skin on the back of her head and pull it away from her skull. I watched in horror as she pulled the skin away from her body and step out of it like a suit. Her muscle and bone laid bare infront of me. I could see the blood drip from her body, and hear the squish of muscles. I watched as she carefully laid the suit over the toilet, and stepped into the tub. A heavy sigh of relief left her mouth as she fully sank into the tub. The water began to take the shade of blood, and began to steam wildly.  I watched as the muscles began to contract all over her skull, and arms as new skin began to grow in its place. I gently closed the door, not wanting to see more, and made my way down stairs. I already knew what was going to happen to the old skin. My mind went on auto pilot as I began to clean up my mess from dinner. 

After cleaning the kitchen, I grabbed the cupcakes, two glasses of milk, my pistol, and with a heavy heart I headed up the stairs. You see, my "project" is I hunt the skelties. The skelties are humanoid beings that eat children. They can eat our food, but can not survive off it. We havent figured out why only children, but we assume its because they are easier targets. They are able to "shed and regrow" skin at any point, but must shed at least once a day. The skin is then consumed, which makes them damn near impossible to find if you don't know what you are looking for. They are a very happy go lucky race, but are brutal in the way they feed. They first rip the appendages from the body. Then they rip the head from the body, and then drain the blood. Their jaws stretch open, and they swallow the rest of the it whole. The rest of the body parts are "stored" for later if they are unsuccessful in their next hunt. They usually stay in the woods, or around rivers. They will not resort to violence with adults, which is how they die. Five bullets to the head and one to the heart usually does the trick.

Making my way up the stairs everything started to make sense. She worked at an orphanage where a child would go missing every 2 to 3 weeks. She never let me see her in the bathroom at night when she bathed. How nice and non-confrontational she is, and how she has not seemed to age a single day in the last 32 years. My foot steps got heavier as I came closer to the door of our room. I stopped and knocked on the door. It's now or never. As she opened the door she met the barrel of my gun, and she was no more. With every bullet that flew i felt my heart shatter. I saw her body fall to the floor, and watched as blood pooled around her. I looked next to her where a pill bottle fell from her hands. Tears ran down my face, as I bent down to grab the bottle. I looked at it and the name of the medication was (Lybalvi), and it was prescribed to me. She was going to try and drug me. To bad I found her out first.
