***PART 1:*** https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/jH6Q3EmrY9

I hadn’t heard from my brother in months.

At first, I assumed he was just *being him.* Always restless, always vanishing off to some remote place without telling anyone. But then the messages stopped. His phone rang out. Even his emails—never frequent to begin with—dried up completely.

I told myself I’d let it go. That he’d reach out when he was ready. But last night, I dreamed about him.

I saw his house, the little rented flat in that nameless town he’d holed himself up in. I saw the door open. I saw something inside, too dark, too full, swelling. I woke up shaking.

So, this morning, I packed a bag and drove south.

••

The town was smaller than I remembered. *Too quiet.*

It looked worn out, like something had been draining it for years. The houses sagged under the weight of damp air, their brickwork dull and lifeless. The high street was deserted, the windows of old shops dark and uninviting.

Even the air here was wrong—too thick, too warm for the season. A humid, syrupy heat clung to my skin as I turned onto his road.

Something about it made me uneasy.

No birds. No distant sound of traffic. Just the low whisper of wind through empty streets.

His house sat at the very end of the road. It looked abandoned.

Paint peeled from the windowsills, and the curtains were drawn tight. The small garden out front had overgrown wildly, thick brambles curling over the path. A bin lay on its side, spilling out gold foil wrappers, caught in the weeds like trapped insects.

Then, as I stepped closer—

**The smell hit me.**

Not just garbage. Something deeper, wetter, wrong.

**Something dead.**

••

I knocked. No answer.

I tried calling. The muffled sound of a ringtone barely made it past the walls before it cut off abruptly, swallowed by the dense, cloying silence pressing against the house.

I used the spare key.

The lock resisted, the metal gummy, sticking like something thick had seeped into it. When it finally turned, the door creaked open, and the smell rolled over me.

Rot.

Thick, wet sweetness, like spoiled fruit left too long in the heat. It coated my tongue, clogged my nose. I gagged, pulling my sweater over my mouth.

The inside was worse.

The air felt stagnant, thick enough to chew. The walls were darkened, stained with something that had seeped into the plaster. The wooden floor stuck under my shoes.

And the wrappers—

*Everywhere.*

***Huxley Chocolate.***

Crushed into the carpet. Crammed into corners. Smeared across the walls in greasy brown swipes. Some still had teeth marks, as if he’d eaten them in frantic, gnashing bites, barely chewing.

The kitchen table was buried under piles of them. Bars ripped open but left half-eaten, their chocolate now melted into dark, glistening pools.

A note lay among them, scribbled on a crumpled receipt.

••

***“Hard to move today. Woke up and everything aches. Feet swollen. Ankles barely bend. Not worried, just need to rest. Still hungry, though. I’ll try sitting up later.”***

••

The letters were shaky, the ink smudged, the writing uneven, like his hands had been trembling when he wrote it.

I stepped forward.

Something shifted under my foot.

I staggered back, heart hammering.

The floor bulged. The beetles scattered, vanishing into the cracks.

A second note lay beside the couch, half-crumpled, as if dropped mid-thought.

••

***“Harder now. Legs feel tight. Skin stretches when I stand. I think I must’ve put on weight. Feels heavy, but not normal. Face is puffy too. Feels full. Tight. But I’m still hungry.”***

••

I turned toward the hallway.

The wrappers led inside.

A trail of them, like he’d eaten them until the very end.

I hesitated.

The air felt wrong here, denser.

I took a breath, then stepped inside.

••

And that’s when I found him.

Or *what was left of him.*

••

My brother had been immense.

A mountain of flesh, collapsed and empty. His body had spilled across the bed, over the edges, pooling onto the floor. His arms sagged, the folds of skin too heavy, his legs fused together under his sheer weight.

His stomach had burst, leaving a cavity of wet, sunken ribs, the skin stretched thin and translucent. The wound was sticky, not quite fresh, not quite dry.

The beetles crawled through him, their tiny legs burrowing beneath the loose skin, slipping in and out of the glistening gaps where his body had split open.

And in his swollen, rigid hand, he still clutched a half-eaten bar of Huxley’s chocolate.

The teeth marks were visible, the chocolate melting into his palm, fusing with the peeling flesh.

His face—

I staggered back, bile rising.

There was almost nothing left of it.

His cheeks had collapsed, the skin puckered where flesh had been eaten away. His nose was half gone, reduced to a gnawed cavity, the bone peeking through. His lips—what remained of them—were curled back over his teeth, locked in a hideous, stretched grin, as if he had died mid-scream.

His eyes were gone.

A third note lay on the nightstand.

Not a note.

A chocolate wrapper, scribbled over in greasy, smeared ink.

••

***“I hear them inside. Under my skin. Not my stomach. Not hunger. Inside. Feels like something crawling. I think I just need one more bar. Then I can stop.”***

••

I gagged, barely making it to the kitchen before my stomach gave out, bile splattering onto the floor.

I gasped for air, my whole body shaking. My skin crawled with the phantom touch of invisible legs, the sensation of those things skittering over my hands, my face.

I fumbled for my phone. Called the police.

The dispatcher answered, her voice flat. Unbothered.

*“My brother,”* I gasped. *“He’s—he’s dead. He’s—”*

The words stuck, refusing to form.

I settled for an address.

She asked me to stay on the line.

I hung up.

••

I made it outside before I collapsed, hands on my knees, heaving.

The wind shifted, carrying the sweet rot of the house back to me.

My stomach lurched.

The road stretched ahead, empty and silent.

No one was coming.

I sat there, staring at the ground, listening to the faint, clicking from inside the house under increasing noise from Police sirens.

The sound of tiny legs, still moving.

*Still feeding.*
