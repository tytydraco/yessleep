My phone reads 17:03

The stairwells leading up through each floor in the apartment block have a kind of middle floor between each actual level of the building. This let's the stairs go up one way, and up the other way keeping the stairs as a spiral. I'm sitting there. Jammed between the 2nd and the 3rd floor. My boyfriend Aiden went upstairs to go do some chores for his dad, he doesn't mention me because he doesn't want his dad to know he's hanging out with me so I hide downstairs just far enough so his dad can't see me if he exits the room on the fourth floor. I'm sitting, alone, waiting.

Theres no sound or buzzing from the lights but they slightly flicker, one shade of light brighter and one shade darker. You can't notice it unless your staying still and spacing out staring at the red carpet that covers the stairs. I put in headphones and turn on some shitty song I've heard a million times over to drown out the silence. I hate being alone, but I'm alone waiting for somebody who makes every moment feel perfect, so I don't mind it. I'm not upset, I just hate waiting, I hate being alone and I'm waiting alone at the stairs. The melody courses through my ears giving me some instant relaxation, I look at a picture of me and aiden together hugging eachother and smile at the memory, maybe we'll take more pictures today and I can smile at more memories when I'm home, happy of a day together. I turn the phone off and on because I'm lazy and I want to see the time in bigger numbers staring at me through my lock screen.

17:33

I take my backpack off of my back and put it beside me. I don't know how much longer I'll have to wait but the times passing too slow so I want to eat something and close my eyes, dozing off isn't my plan but after a ham sandwich and some water my body has other plans and I black out with my back to the wall of the stairs. I guess I was more tired than I thought from all the walking today. I fall into a deep, dark, dreamless slumber. 

"Up here."

I wake up, I heard somebody whispering something. 
A habit I do because of a bad memory leads me to check if I'm awake. I push my thumb and my index far apart on my left hand and bite the space inbetween. It hurts, so I'm awake. The motion censor turned off the light but as soon as I move the light flashes back on and blinds me for a second until I blink my eyes. Nothing has changed, I'm still here alone except for the voice I heard. Was it in my head? I must've only dozed off for a few minutes. I turn on my phone, squinching my eyes at the brightness of the light.

22:51

It has infact not only been a few minutes.
I check the time five or six times over to make sure I saw it right. I did. I can't help but notice that my phone battery hasn't gone down too much. I have no service here so I'm not surprised I didn't get any missed calls from my mom being worried but I am surprised I'm still here. She probably would've called one of my friends who knew Aiden and gotten them to ask him to check up on me. I get up off of my ass, avoiding the feeling of pins and needles all over my legs and make my way upstairs to head over to Aidens door. I'm not planning to enter but if I go up I get service and if I go close enough I can get his families WiFi and use it to call my mom to come get me. As I go up one floor to what should be the third I notice that my phone hasn't gotten any more reception. Its still on one bar so I can't see any calls I might have gotten. 

"Wierd."

I mumble to nobody in particular. I head up to where the fourth floor should be, but, its not there. Its just another floor that leads to another floor. Something in my stomach sinks and I check my phone desperately to hope there's atleast a signal here. There isn't. Maybe I mixed up which floor I was on? There's no numbers anywhere so if I was between the first and second floor than the next floor would be the fourth floor. I lean over the stairs to the gap between each stair case and floor and look up to see if the ceiling is close or far away incidicating which floor I should be on. What I see makes my heart drop.

There is no ceiling. There is no end. There is no fourth floor. There is no top.

I look down and see theres no ground either, no bottom floor. I run up the stairs till my hearts beating out of my chest. I scream "Aiden" till I feel like I'm choking on his name. Its just me. Im alone. I'm alone on the stairwell by myself and there is nobody here to save me. I stop.

I don't know what floor I'm in but I decide that running up the stairs screaming frantically isn't working so sit down and examine my options. My bag is about 20 floors down so I should probably go get that so I have my remaining food to keep me alive a little longer. Theres still the apartments themselves that I can check, there's the elevator, and than there's my phone. When I turn it on I notice the time.

23:35

I press the phone symbol on the bottom left and dial 911. No signal. I unlock my phone and stare at the wallpaper for a moment admiring the photo of Aiden smiling, I wish I kissed him one more time before he went upstairs. I swipe down and hold on the WiFi button to check if there's any WiFi connection, theres nothing. My battery is at 34% and going down so I should preserve battery as much as I can. I try calling the elevator but the button does nothing. I kick the elevator door in anger and move onto the door leading into the apartments on the floor.

The way the block is built, each floor has a door on the left that leads into one apartment on the left and one apartment on the right. Other blocks have two doors on the right and two doors on the left but not this one for whatever reason. The door leading into the apartments open but neither of the apartments themselves open up. I knock and shout for help as much as my throat let's me but I'm greeted back with silence. Nobody heeds my call for help, its just silent oblivion reminding me that I am alone.
I.
Am.
Alone.

I turn my back to the door and I roll down against it. I break, I cry. I'm sad. I'm scared. I'm angry. I'm confused and I don't know whats happened. I cry and I cry till my body gives up and I feel myself dozing off. I blink and wipe my tears and check my phone. 

24:02

Ofcourse.
My phones on 28%.
I cry more.
I stand and punch the door as hard as I can. The wood doesn't break, but my skin does. My middle fingers knuckle is red and bleeding. My ring fingers knuckle is red and swolen, the others look only a slight bit red. 
I lean against the door and cry a little more while staring at my bleeding knuckles. I sit there for a long time. Until finally something changes. The motion censor light goes off. I stand up and I go through the door into the stairwell. I've walked in and I've opened a door the motion censor should've turned back on but it didn't. I stand there in darkness covered in snot and tears as my knuckles bleed small red drips onto the matching carpet becoming one with the floor. My stomach rumbles. I'm starving. There's food in my bag.

I reach for my back but my hand grasps at nothing. 

"Shit."

Its still down there.
Its still around 20 floors down.
I turn the flash on my phone on and make my way down the steps. I'm not running so it takes alot longer to get down than how it took to get up. I have no clear indicator as to if I'm on the same floor so I'm hoping I'll just find my backpack and maybe try going down instead of up. When I'm five floors down I suddenly hear something that makes me stop.

"Up here."

Its the same fucking voice that woke me up when I dozed off. Maybe its the thing that took me.

"Hello!?"

I shout while looking up. Nobody responds. I peer my head over the railing and look up and see nothing. I use my phone and flash upwards. As soon as I do I notice a pair of oily, long, black fingers pull away from the bar of the stairwell. Its only one floor above me. I pull away and quietly walk down the stairs as fast as I can without making a noise. I am scared but I made too much noise and it pulled away so it knows where I am. I need to get away without it knowing where I am and I need to get to my backpack and than I can hide behind one of the doors till the lights turn back on. If they will ever turn back on. I'm 15 floors lower than I was 5 minutes ago. I should be close to my bag. As I turn the corner again to head down the steps I see my bag. I see my bag and I see the figure looking through it.

Long, inky, veiny limbs on all fours holding up a thin, wirey frame. Its entire head is jammed into my bag and it seems to be eating the contents of everything. My clothes, my water bottle, my food. As I shine my light over it and freeze in horror it reacts to the light. Pulling away into darkness and taking its head out. It doesn't have a face. Its just a spiral of teeth. Staring into its face I don't see an end to the teeth. Its just spiralling indefinitely deeper than its head biology should allow. It screeches at me and runs downwards frantically on all floors using the wall and the floor like a spider running as fast as it can. I scream and stand still.

My food is gone. That thing is below me. Something else is above me. I don't know what to do.

I'm hiding in the door on that very floor. I don't know what else has happened since but the lights have turned on and off multiple times, I've seen shadows and eyes peering in at me when the lights were off but I'm not going to move even when they're on.

Theres nowhere to run to.
