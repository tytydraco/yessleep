I got a new book last week for my collection, but I’ve decided to keep it locked down in my vault. It’s too dangerous to have out in the open

When my new acquaintance (to preserve his privacy, I’ll refer to him as ‘Chester’) came to meet me in person at a nearby park, he was looking pretty damn rough. The college sophomore was fresh out of a stint in the psychiatric ward, ten pounds thinner than he ought to be, and the plum-dark circles beneath his eyes told me he hadn’t slept well in days. In his hands he clutched the book, bound tightly in brown paper. 

“Ooh,” I said, zeroing in on it immediately as he sat down beside me on the bench. I had my dog Midge with me. She’s a yellow-furred mutt with one blind eye, an eye that can see things I can’t. I knew Chester’s book was the real deal when Midge took one look and growled at it. 

“Is your dog alright?” Chester asked. He was half-slurring, exhausted. 

“Yeah, yeah, she’s fine,” I said. I snatched the book out of his hands, despite Midge’s whining protests. I quickly unwrapped the book. It was exactly as he’d described in our chat online. Deep brown leather, gilded pages, and an unusual title:

**YAႧႧIM TA ИOOM ⛬ THӘIИႧIM TA ИUƧ**

I moved to crack the book open, but Chester stopped me. 

“I wouldn’t do that,” he said thinly. “Just lock it up somewhere or burn it or something. There’s nothing in there you want to read.”

“Nothing at all? That’s usually the sort of information I like to verify for myself,” I told him. 

“You won’t even be able to…look, something’s wrong with it. I’m giving it to you to *get rid of it*,” he said. “I read on the forums that you take care of stuff like this.”

“Sure, but first I need to know what stuff I’m dealing with, precisely.” I wrapped the book back up for the moment. “Why don’t you start by telling me where you got it?”

**CHESTER’S ACCOUNT**

I got it at an antique shop. 

It’s called ‘Fort’s Corner’, near mainstreet. It’s not, like, old, or strange, or haunted, or anything like that. It popped up a couple years ago and it’s run by this young-ish, hippie-type couple. Oh, and their orange tabby cat. It sits in their storefront, it’s sort of their gimmick. 

I guess, I just want to be clear that this is a normal place. I’m not the idiot in the horror movie, you know? I used to shop there all the time, it was a normal Saturday afternoon. *Normal*.

Though I guess the book wasn’t.

Maybe, thinking back now, there was something weird about how I spotted it all the way at the back of the store. About how my eyes shot right to it, like it was a beacon. It was in the corner, crammed on a shelf with a bunch of paperback romances and pulp books from the sixties. I remember…I didn’t question how weird that was, until now. I mean, look at it. It’s leatherbound with gilded pages, wicked fancy, and it was just sitting there with regular books like it belonged there, somehow. Why didn’t I wonder about that?

I guess, for the same reason I didn’t really think when I picked it up, or took it to the counter, or gave the check-out lady twenty bucks for it. It was all instinct. Muscle memory. Like I’d found a part of myself I didn’t realize was missing, and fused back together with it…

\*

Sorry. I space out a lot lately.

I, um, I took it home. I’m still living with my parents and my sister, to save money while I work my way through school. I’m an engineering student. Or trying to be, anyway.

I set the book aside, but it gnawed at the back of my mind the rest of the day. All through dinner, all through catching up on my assignments, all I could think about was the book. I was straight up giddy once I’d wrapped up what remained of my homework. I must’ve looked like a kid on Christmas when I grabbed it from the bag and sat it on my lap. 

“What are you, fiction? Non fiction?” I couldn’t read the title, but I figured that was just a printing error. I ran my hand over the cover. It even *felt* beautiful. I opened it up to the first page, huddled up in the corner of my bed with nothing but my reading light to ward off the dark.

It was unreadable. Every word, hell, every *letter* was completely and totally alien to me, even though it looked like plain English on the surface. I busted out my phone and pulled out google translate, but it was no use. It fit no language. I even tried reading up on ancient hieroglyphics and cuneiform tablets, and still nothing seemed close to what was printed on those pages.  I thought maybe it was one massive misprint, like the cover. But there was something too intentional about it. Patterns were there, even if I couldn’t decipher them.  

It was more exciting than frustrating, honestly. Like finding an unfinished puzzle. That was always the sort of thing I loved as a kid. Rubix cubes, rush hour, jigsaws, puzzle books like *Maze*. Something with a secret that was staring back at you just under the surface, waiting for you to find it, to unravel it. 

I figured it must be written in some sort of code, so for the next week, codebreaking became my new hobby. I scoured online for any information I could find, checked out books, studied up on dozens of different types of codes. It’s embarrassing, but I barely touched my studies from university that week, and ended up falling behind for the first time since I was an elementary schooler. I even skipped classes. I couldn’t help it. None of the problems in my textbook were as fascinating as this one. Every time I tried to take a break and tear myself away from the book, I’d catch sight of it just out of the corner of my eye, and find myself reaching for it again. I’d spiral back into it, pages of possible ciphers sprawled on my desk, searching for a match.

No. None of them matched, technically. Didn’t matter what I tried. Every time I thought I’d just about cracked it, it would elude me. It was like fishing with my bare hands, the answer always wriggling away at the last second. Codes upon codes, ciphers and ciphers, nothing and more nothing for seven days.

And then, on night 8, hunched over my desk, I caught something.

I don’t know how to describe it to you, exactly. No, like I said, it wasn’t one of the ciphers, exactly. It was like…I saw through the pattern. Everything clicked together, just for a second, just at one sentence. A sentence I could finally read.

Yes, I remember what it said. I can’t forget what it said. It said:

**WHEN THE RABBIT HUNTS THE WOLF AND THE RAIN FALLS FROM THE LAKE, ALL THE WORLD WILL FEAST AND EVERY DREAM WILL WAKE.**

I didn't know what it meant, but it didn’t matter to me. All I cared about was that I’d finally gotten something. I’d *finally* read something. 

I should have felt satisfied, I guess. It only made me more obsessed. 

\*

“Did you really have to bring that thing to the table?”

I barely heard my sister’s voice, despite sitting across from her. It had been a week since my initial break-through, and I had been summoned from my seclusion for a family dinner. Of course I brought the book to the table. I brought the book everywhere.

I glanced up from the book at Allie. “I need to study.”

“That freak book you’ve been touting around is definitely not for a class.” Alice eyed the book with open disgust, which pissed me off far more than it should have. I felt protective of it.

“It’s for a special project,” I snapped. She snapped some insult back at me, though I barely listened. I just stared down into the book as she kept going on and on about how I’d been acting different, how I was freaking everyone out, something like that. At the time it was hard to care about what she was saying, because two more sentences revealed themselves.

**DEATH IS A MIRROR**

**THE GIRL CRAWLED THROUGH THE DOOR THAT WAS NOT A DOOR, AND SAW THERE ALL THE HIDDEN THINGS**

They were on two different pages, disconnected. I couldn’t even tell you what was happening around me at the table. I was so blind with elation that I stood up without another word to my family and locked myself up in the room. I distantly remember them knocking on the door. I ignored them. I ignored everything, and for the next six hours I read and read. Most of the book was still impenetrable to me, but I was picking up more scraps as I went through. They are all still crystal clear in my mind, like they’re burned there.

**FRUIT LIKE JEWELS GREW FROM THE SKY, AND BLED WHEN THEY WERE PLUCKED**

**HONEY IN THE MOUTH, WORDS OF MILK**

**THE GIRL WALKED UNTIL HER FEET CURLED INTO HOOVES AND BACK AGAIN, UNTIL SHE WAS CERTAIN THIS WORLD HAD NO END AND NO BEGINNING**

The girl? Yeah, she pops up in the book all the time. She’s the closest thing there is to a character in the story, if you can call it a story. No, she’s never named. I would have remembered her name.

Anyway, I finally started getting tired. I forced myself to shut the book and laid it on my nightstand. I turned out the light, went to sleep.

And then I dreamed.

I dreamed the things I’d read in the book. I was walking in this dark, shiny place. Almost like a field, but spotted with things that looked like trees. There was this bright red, swollen fruit hanging in the sky just out of reach, throbbing. It was raining from the ground up, fat droplets seeping out of the soil and flying into the air. I saw a wolf howling and running like its life depended on it. A small hare was hopping at its heels. Ahead of me, I saw a figure through the rain, small and blurry.

And behind me, even though I couldn’t see it, I knew there was a door. 

All this could be explained by my overtired and hyperactive subconscious, I guess. I mean, it’s not rocket science. Read a ton of a thing, it starts showing up in your dreams. What I can’t explain was where I was when I woke up in the middle of the night. 

I was standing on the ceiling.

Just…standing there. Like I opened my eyes, and there I was, upside down in the living room, the coffee table just above my head.  It wasn’t like my feet were glued there, or anything. It was more like my own personal gravity had been reversed. I could walk back and forth no problem. I thought I was still dreaming, to be honest. It wasn’t until I looked down at my hands that I realized it was all real. 

At that point, I swear my heart straight up froze in my chest. My mind just went totally blank, like it couldn’t compute what it was seeing. I didn’t scream, even though I wanted to. I just stood there for a second, feeling like I was going to die from the sheer weirdness of it. Then some kind of instinct told me I should try and get down. I walked nearer to the couch and started jumping, over and over until things reversed again and I fell on the couch. I didn’t float back up to the ceiling, to my relief. To this day, I have no memory of how I possibly could have gotten up there, not the foggiest clue. After some time curled up on the couch, I convinced myself that I must have hallucinated. That it was some kind of waking dream, a byproduct of sleepwalking. Once I’d convinced myself, I went back to bed, mentally filing the whole thing away as a weird, one-off incident.

It was just the start.

\*

I started sleepwalking more.

It was a gradual thing. I went a week without any other incidents after the ceiling one, and that was already fading from my mind. The only thing on my mind was the book, really. I picked it up again, went back to trying to decode it. I started picking up more fragments.

**THE GIRL FOUND A LIVING CAVE, AND SQUEEZED HER WAY THROUGH THE DAMP, BREATHING CREVICES UNTIL SHE FOUND BLACK WATER, AND DRANK.**

**THE HUNT CIRCLED THE FIELD AND INTO THE FOREST, WHERE OTHER DOORS WERE.**

It happened again, just like before. One moment I was deep in the dream, not too different from the last one. I was standing in a cave, but it felt more like I was in the belly of some giant being, surrounded by pink and red walls. I started walking until I was in this tight, cramped passage, and then I had to get on my hands and knees and claw my way through. Just when it got so tight that I couldn’t breathe, I blinked, and I was home again.

In my pajamas. Crammed under the kitchen sink. I’m a fairly tall dude, so I thought I was going to have to, like,break my legs to get out, but I was just barely able to contort myself out of the space. As far as places go, that was probably the least weird. Three nights after that I woke up walking on my bedroom wall, sideways. Two nights later, I was tangled at the top of a tree in the backyard. The day after that, well, I gave my poor sister a fucking heart attack. She woke up to sounds outside her bedroom window. When she opened it up and looked outside, there I was, tip-toeing along the ledge of the roof, one wrong step away from falling and breaking my neck. She told me later that she freaked out and screamed my name, but that it didn’t even phase me. She said my eyes were wide open. 

She and my mom followed my path below with a mattress in case I fell, while my dad got on the roof to try and yank me back. I know all this second hand, obviously. All I remember is walking along the ridge of a lightning bolt in a black cloud, then waking up duct-taped to my bed. 

My family watched me like hawks after that, but it didn’t do much good. They took me to a dozen specialists, none of whom could find anything wrong with me, besides vague guesses like “stress”. They gave me pills that did about as much as tic-tacs might have. 

Was I still reading it? Yes. Of course I was. Okay, just—spare me the look. It was out of my control. Like I said, the book was all I could think of. It was everything. And it was revealing more of itself to me every day. It got to the point that I could read entire pages, unbroken. How was I supposed to just give up when I was finally making progress?

The first time I made it through an entire chapter, maybe a week and a half after the roof incident, I sleepwalked out of my own neighborhood. 

I was in the field again beneath a red sky, watching the rain fall upside down, and the rabbit chase the wolf. The hunt was getting more intense. The wolf was inside out now, and missing chunks out of its body. Its pink flesh was mottled with fur and ripped up in several places, trailing blood with every loping step. Sometimes it would cast its eye towards me like it was begging for help, but something in me didn’t want to help it. I don’t know why but I was…*pleased*. Satisfied. Like I was watching the gears of nature turn just the way they were meant to, like something out of sorts in the cosmic order had finally been corrected. 

I felt the door behind me again. It was farther away than usual, but I could still feel it, a vacuum of energy like a black hole. Ahead of me was the figure with its back to me, less blurry now, and closer. The girl. She didn’t turn to face me, but I knew she could see me. She raised her hand to beckon me closer, then started walking. I followed.

I know things are different in dreams, but this felt more real than anything ever has in my entire life. I spent years following her, walking and walking, growing old and bent, my feet curving into hooves and back again. She led me in silence through forests of dead and twisted trees, and rotted cities where eyes watched me from the black abysses of the windows, and through the corpses of giants, through the hillsides where beasts cannibalized their young, through rivers of bile, and through places that were nothing but emptiness, cold and soundless voids. I started to think that I would never stop walking, then that I had always *been* walking, and that my whole life on Earth had been nothing but a dream between footsteps.

Finally, she came to a stop.

A black lake stretched in front of us, as far as the eye could see. It looked more like an ocean, now that I think about it, but I knew instinctively that it was a lake. I had this weird sensation that I’d been there before. That I’d been there *first*, before I’d ever been anywhere else. When I dragged myself to the edge of the shore and looked into the water, it was so dark that I couldn’t see anything underneath. It was like I was looking into space stripped of the stars. I heard the girl speak behind me.

She told me to wade deeper, so I did.

She told me to cup my hands and scoop up the water, so I did.

She told me to drink.

I almost did. I held the water in my palm, thin and inky, ready to spill it down into my mouth. But some, I don’t know, instinct inside me stopped my arm. Like a little voice in my head that I hadn’t heard in eons, screaming at me not to drink, to get out of the lake. 

The girl told me to drink again, and when I still didn’t, she started getting angry. She started screaming at me, begging me, slapping her hands against the water, but I still wouldn’t. I dropped the water from my hand and she came up and shoved me in, but I wasn’t afraid, because I knew without knowing that there was a door beneath me. And I fell right through it.

I opened my eyes. I was awake now, I could tell. But I was still underwater, and all I could see was the pinprick light of the moon above me. My lungs started tightening up. I felt fish darting between my fingers and silt under my feet, and that made me realize where I was. I swam like a crazy person, flailing and forcing myself up through the water before I ran out of the sour air that was sitting in my chest. As if it had been held there in suspension. When I finally broke through the surface, I was shivering so hard that I had to claw my way over the shore. I was at the local park. I had been standing at the bottom of the pond, for God knows how long. 

I walked two miles back to my house, soaked and cold to the bone. I thought my feet were going to fall right off by the time I finally stumbled into my house, and my parents were so freaked that they rushed me to the ER. Things got more serious after that.

They started chaining me to the bed, if you can believe it. They tried everything, actually. They cuffed my wrists to the bedframe, tied my ankles to cinderblocks, barricaded my doors and windows, even installed a security system throughout the house so that an alarm would blare if I sleepwalked out. None of it worked. Somehow, the restraints always came undone, the barricade always collapsed, the alarm always failed to trip. And I would dream of that strange, addicting world, and wake up halfway across town. 

Oh, of course they tried to take the book from me. I hid it. I hid it in a space between the walls that hadn’t been there before I got the book. It was like the house had contorted itself to help me, to safeguard the one thing that gave me purpose. I know how that sounds, but by then I was at the point where I could almost read the whole book, and the things it said mesmerized me. The girl had become a queen in that world, or maybe a god. The beasts obeyed her. The trees yielded their flesh and fed her off their vines. She could dig valleys with her bare hands, or bring the dead cities back to life. Something like life, I mean. The point is, the more time she spent in the world and became part of it, the more command she had over it. I was proud of her.

No, actually. I was envious of her.

\*\*\*

 In light of everything else failing, my family took to keeping watch over me, sleeping in shifts. They still tied me to the bed on top of that, but they said the bonds always came undone one way or another, no matter how secure they made them. My mom says it was easy to tell when I was about to sleepwalk. My eyes would snap open, but there’d be nothing behind them. Like they were glass. My family was calling doctors and specialists around the country, scheduling consultations and looking into new medications for me to take. I felt sort of distant from it all, to be honest. The time I was awake was what felt like a dream. Everything in this world felt 2D, a cardboard stage set, like a cheap movie playing out around me until it was time to return to reality. 

The only thing that kept me anchored was the book. I had almost read the entire thing. The wolf was nearly dead, the rabbit nearly fed. The girl was still searching for something.

A surreal, sleepless week passed as I was constantly being woken up by my family members throughout the night, yanked out of that other world just as I was getting my bearings. It was disorienting, like being flipped upside down and then right-side up again, over and over, until I couldn’t tell which was which. I actually started to resent my family, as crazy as that sounds. The rational part of my brain was checked out, and what was left saw them as jailers. 

Finally, the guard faltered. It was one, maybe two AM. The moon outside my window was so supernaturally bright, it looked blinding. It made the entire room stark white, sharp and skeletal. My sister had nodded off in my computer chair. For the first time in what felt like forever, I wasn’t being watched. 

I sat up in bed for a minute, just kind of blank. I hadn’t woken up from any dream. It felt almost nostalgic to have just casually woken up in my room, in my bed. No sleepwalking, no visions. Just my room. Just as I started to lay back down, I felt it.

A door. Somewhere, out of sight, but definitely there. The same door that I always felt behind me in my dreams, that powerful absence. Except it wasn’t behind me now, but somewhere farther down. Somewhere in the house.

I silently crept out of bed, careful not to wake Ally. I started following the feeling, looking for the door. Something in the back of my head knew this was a fucking stupid idea, but the rest of me couldn’t help myself. I mean, it was in my *house* now. I had to find it.

The feeling led me down the hall, and—oh, um. I mean, it’s hard to describe. It’s like nothingness, or a vacuum, or a place where all the air’s gone out. But it’s heavy. Suffocating, even. Yeah, suffocating. That was the feeling. And it drew me in, pulled me along, until I stepped into the hall bathroom. I knew as soon as I did that this was the closest I’d ever been to the door. It was immediate, like the gravity of it was just shy of crushing me. My vision blurred for a second from the headache it gave me. Once it snapped into focus, I found myself standing in front of the mirror.

And there she was.

The girl was staring back at me from the other side of the mirror. Finally, *finally,* I could see her face, and it was beautiful, and it was horrific, a little girl’s face that had never been allowed to grow up but instead got pulled through eons and eons, warped into something just on the other side of human. And the field and the rain was behind her, and the rabbit was ripping into the body of the wolf, tearing off massive, bloody bites. 

The girl stared into my eyes and pressed her hand against the glass. I pressed mine against hers. The glass between us felt so thin. I could almost feel the cold coming off her skin. Her mouth moved as she said something to me, but it was muffled. 

“I can’t hear you,” I whispered. Her mouth shut. With her other hand, she motioned for me to come closer. I leaned in close until my head was pressed up right against the mirror. She kept her hand against the glass, over mine. She moved closer and spoke in a low gurgle.

**“THIS DOOR IS NOT A DOOR.”**

Then her hand shot through the glass and closed over mine.

Her nails were like claws, sinking into my skin as she tried to pull me through. The mirror splintered where my wrist entered, cutting the skin and dripping blood all over the bathroom counter. Some animal part of me finally woke up and I started screaming and trying to pull myself out of her grip, but it was *iron.* We were locked in this fucked-up tug of war as she kept trying to force me through the mirror. God, I’ve never screamed so loud. My heart was beating so fast I thought it was going to fucking seize, and every time she managed to pull me deeper it was like my skin was being torn off the muscle. At some point she got me as far as my shoulder, but I kept screaming and fighting and trying to pull myself out, until I heard the bathroom door slam open behind me.

“Oh my god, *WHO IS THAT?*” Allie screamed and grabbed the back of my shirt, trying to pull me away as the girl in the mirror started screaming and roaring too. “*WHAT IS THAT?*”

I had to brace my leg against the sink to get some leverage, and the girl sunk her nails so deep into my arm I thought I could feel them scraping my bones. Allie had her arms around my waist and was pulling and sobbing, just screaming over and over “what is that, what is that.” It was obviously enough to wake up my parents, and they came rushing in. My mom passed out as soon as she saw it. Just heaved and hit the floor. My dad went into fight mode, not even screaming or pausing, just lunged forward and grabbed me, pulling me by the torso. Finally I started slipping backwards, the three of us working together able to yank my arm back out of the mirror inch by inch, spraying blood everywhere. I didn’t even feel the cuts at that point. It was nothing but adrenaline pumping through me. Nothing but the fight, the need to survive.

My dad and sister got me out with one final pull. We all went falling down to floor. The girl screamed again and started banging her hands against the glass, over and over until my dad couldn’t take it any more. He ran out to the garage and came back with a hammer. He slammed it into the mirror over and over until the girl’s screaming cut out and the field was gone, the shards of our mirror dropping off and peppering the countertop. The air changed as soon as he’d finished. The heaviness lifted away.

The door was gone.

**END OF CHESTER’S ACCOUNT**

“I can’t have it around me anymore,” Chester said after he’d told me the whole story. He stared down at the book with something straddling the edge of hatred and longing. “I’m scared I won’t be able to stop myself from picking it back up again, and then she’ll have me for good. The mirror thing snapped me out of it for a little while, but I don’t know how long it will stay that way.”

“You’ll never have to see it again,” I promised him.  “You ever miss that other world, out of curiosity?”

“I’d rather not answer,” he said.

“Well, do you still have those dreams about it?”

Chester got up to leave, then paused. “I don’t dream at all anymore.”

\*

So that was that. As per usual, any names in the above account have been changed for privacy reasons. Also as per usual, I’m doing my due diligence on the research front, but it’s slow going. I haven’t been able to figure out when and where the book was printed yet, and I don’t have the necessary precautions in place to risk reading it for myself. Unlike Chester, I’ve got no family to yank me out the mirror if things go wrong, and Midge lacks the requisite opposable thumbs. Chester provided a few, very sparse details on the girl. She wore a ripped up dress that “maybe” was Victorian-era. If I’m looking for Victorian-era girls in the area who disappeared under mysterious circumstances, well, it will be a long search. I’ll do my best, though.

That only left one lead to follow up on, which was the place Chester bought it from, Fort’s Corner. I went, and he wasn’t lying. It’s aggressively, disappointingly normal (though they get bonus points from me for the cat that hangs out in the window).  I perused the shelves, didn’t find anything notable. I had Midge with me, and though she seemed on edge, she didn’t bark at anything in the store. Before I left, I took the book to the front desk to chat with the owner of the establishment, a blond woman in her late twenties decked out in crystal jewelry. 

“Hmm…” she said, pursing her lips as she casually flipped through the books. “Gosh, I’m sorry. I don’t even remember this coming in. I wish I could tell you more. Was there something wrong with it, are you looking to return it?”

“Oh, not at all,” I said, snatching the book back. “I was just looking for more information about it. Thanks for your help.”

“Any time. Come again soon!” She smiled and waved at me, and I started for the door. 

Just as we were about to leave, Midge ground to a halt. She looked up at the cat, took a stumbling step backward, and growled. 

“Midge, cut that out!” I tried to pull her out, but she growled the entire time, whining and staring down that cat, which stayed still as a statue on the windowsill. It didn’t even look at her. Instead it looked at me. Then, it looked at the book.

For the split second the cat’s eyes met mine, there was something almost human in its gaze, calculating even. Like it knew exactly who I was, and what I had in my hands. 

Anyway, I couldn’t let Midge tear up the store while she was working herself up into a frenzy, so I had to drag her out, and off ran the cat behind the register.

I’m still not sure the shop had anything to do with the strangeness of the book, though Midge doesn’t growl for nothing. But at the end of the day, I’ve got no proof of anything nefarious, and no damn answers. I just have to file this whole thing under the cursed ‘currently unsolved’ category.

At least until I can figure out a way to read the book myself.
