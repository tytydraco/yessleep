Hey Reddit, I (19M) have been friend with Kenn (19M) since middle school. For the past 3 months, he's been completely inactive in every social media platforms, and his parents always claim that he's either sleeping or sick whenever I try to visit.

Last week, he randomly messaged me asking to meet up. Since our last conversation before he went inactive was him being very vulnerable about his mental health, I was just worried about what he was going through. However, that quickly changed when the location he sent was at an abandoned area of out neighborhood which have pretty much turned into a landfill. If I remember correctly, the area was abandoned because of a nauseating stench that lingers no matter how much the area was cleaned. Kenn has always been interested in the paranormal, but even he didn't want to go anywhere near that dumpster of a place even before it became a literal dumpster with the amount of trash piled up there.

As freaked out as I was, I had to reject him. Not only was it extremely weird and kinda creepy but the location he shared with me was also very VERY far from where I live (about 2 hours away at minimum) and even further from where he lives.



Here's where I might have fucked up.



I immediately declined his request, and he didn't reply to the message at all, and immediately went offline again. He hasn't been online since, (as far as I know) and his parents are still giving me the same response. The only thing that's changed was others' actions around me.

Ever since declining that request, everyone I know has been getting more and more aggressive toward me and I have no idea why. All of a sudden, people have been saying that he's missing and are suspecting me of being the culprit behind his disappearance.

To put into perspective how drastic the shift was: 
3 days ago, I woke up late and ended up being 5 minutes late to a meetup with another friend of mine, Leila. She's never the type to get mad at someone for something small; much less when it comes to being late to a meeting because she's also often late herself. The moment I arrived, she got mad at me and told me I was "super rude" and immediately left without saying a word. I tried to talk to her and profusely apologized but she didn't listen at all. She seemed like a completely stranger to me. The next day, I got an email from my professor stating that I will get a 0 on the project for 'inappropriate behaviors toward my group mate and not pulling my own weight' which doesn't even make sense.


I feel crazy just thinking about this but my parents threatened to disown me an hour ago because they 'don't want a criminal as their offspring' and that I should confess what I did to Kenn. (What the fuck????)


So Reddit, am I the asshole for not accepting the request? I'm gonna get kicked out in two days unless I do something, and no one seems to be listening to me and only aees me as a criminal now. Should I contact the Police? Should I text Kenn and tell him I'm gonna go visit him? Any advice would be heavily appreciated.
