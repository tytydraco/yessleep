I never should have moved into this house. The rent was too good to be true, and now I know why. It started with whispers - faint, barely audible murmurs coming from inside the walls. At first, I thought it was just the pipes or the wind, but as days passed, the whispers grew louder, more insistent.

I'm writing this now, huddled in the corner of my bedroom, hoping that sharing my story might somehow save me. Or at least warn others. 

It all began three weeks ago when I signed the lease on this old Victorian house. The landlord, Mr. Garrett, seemed eager to rent it out. He barely asked me any questions, just handed over the keys with a tight smile and told me to call if there were any problems. I should have known something was off by how quickly he left, almost running to his car.

The first few nights were peaceful. The house creaked and groaned, but that's normal for an old building, right? It wasn't until the fifth night that I heard them. Soft whispers, like someone talking in their sleep, coming from the wall behind my bed. I pressed my ear against the faded wallpaper, trying to make out words, but it was just unintelligible murmuring.

I tried to ignore it, convincing myself it was just my imagination playing tricks on me. But each night, the whispers grew louder, more numerous. It wasn't just one voice anymore, but many, all talking over each other in hushed, urgent tones.

By the second week, I couldn't sleep. The whispers had spread to every room in the house. They were loudest at night, but even during the day, I could hear them - a constant, maddening hum just below the threshold of understanding.

I called Mr. Garrett, desperate for answers. When I mentioned the whispers, the line went silent for a long moment. Then, in a shaky voice, he said, "I'm sorry. I can't help you. No one can. Whatever you do, don't listen to them. Don't try to understand what they're saying." He hung up before I could ask any more questions.

That night, the whispers changed. They became clearer, more focused. And for the first time, I could make out words. "Help us," they said. "Let us in. We're so cold, so alone. Just open the wall. Let us out."

I knew I shouldn't listen, but their pleas were so desperate, so heart-wrenching. I found myself running my hands along the walls, searching for a loose board, a hidden door, anything that might release them.

Just as my fingers found a seam in the wallpaper, a different voice cut through the chorus of whispers. It was deeper, angrier. "Stop!" it boomed. "You don't know what you're doing. They're lying. If you let them out, we're all doomed."

I jerked my hand back, heart pounding. The whispers erupted into a frenzy, some begging me to continue, others warning me to stop. I collapsed onto the floor, hands over my ears, trying to block out the cacophony.

That's where I am now, torn between pity and fear, unsure of what to do next. The whispers haven't stopped. If anything, they're getting louder. I don't know how much longer I can resist their pleas.

If you're reading this, please, I need help. Does anyone know what these whispers might be? Has anyone else experienced something like this? I'm afraid to leave the house - what if they follow me? But I'm even more afraid to stay.

I'll try to update if I can, but if you don't hear from me again... well, I guess you'll know why. And if you ever come across a too-good-to-be-true rental in an old Victorian, run. Run as fast as you can.
