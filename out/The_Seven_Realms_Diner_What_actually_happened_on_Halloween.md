If you had asked me a month ago if I believed in jinxing, I would’ve said no. But, over the course of the month, I have discovered more things about the world and the universe in which we live than I would like. 

I should’ve known, really. Who goes around taunting the universe right before Halloween when they already have enough bad luck as it is?

I’m talking about the fact that I claimed that this week hasn’t been as bad as the last one before the week was even over. Really, what was I thinking?

Halloween was, of course, as bad as you may think. But not in the way you may be thinking? I’m not making any sense, and I’m sorry for that, but before we can get to the sense, there are some things you ought to know so you understand how crucial Halloween night was for me. 

You may remember that I’ve talked about the seven realms and the in-between before, but I never actually explained anything about them. 

While Roger and the sheriff were escorting me back home after I was almost sacrificed, they explained all of this, and I will try to be as accurate as possible, but please do keep in mind that my mental state that night was not the best, so I apologize for any inaccuracies. 

We live in what’s known as the human realm. That is where the diner, Monsterville, literally everything you’ve ever known, is. Probably, unless you’re inhuman or have somehow managed to go to another realm. 

This is what most people assume is all. But it turns out that the human realm is just one of many. In total, there are seven *official* realms. The others can typically only be reached through the in-between, which is a realm in and of itself, except for places where the realms overlap. Take the sea-bound realm, for example. A part of it overlaps with Monsterville, creating a portal that can be accessed without the in-between. That’s how I got there that day. 

I know that all of this seems pretty complicated right now, but the sheriff told me to think of the in-between like the glue that holds the worlds together. 

The in-between can be accessed through any of the many entrances, or portals, if you prefer that term, scattered around our realm. The thing is that these portals aren’t visible. They aren’t made out of stone or wood; they aren’t marked. They just *are*. Always have. So, to make things easier, many years ago, the Inhumans decided to build structures around them so that they could know where the portals are located. 

That’s how the seven realms diner came to be. There are many locations like this around the world, and every single one of them connects our realm to the in-between. They act as anchors for the realms, and inhumans all over the world use them to gather, rest, or simply pass between worlds. That’s how the diner hasn’t run out of food since the road got destroyed, and how the rest of Mosterville is still business as usual. The diner connects Monsterville to the rest of the world. 

And I know what you’re thinking: Susan, if the diner is connected with other diners, why haven’t you used it to get out of Monsterville?

And that would be a great question. 

However, humans are not able to access the in-between. It has some sort of barrier that doesn’t allow us to enter. And trust me, I’ve tried. The only way we can get to another realm is through the portals that don’t require the in-between, like the sea-bound realm. 

That rule is unbreakable. 

Except for Halloween night. Sometimes. 

Everybody’s heard at least once in their lives that, on Halloween, the veil between worlds gets thinner. What they don’t tell you is that it doesn’t always thin out in the same way. Roger explained that some years, the veil can get thin enough to let humans through to the in-between, but that it doesn’t usually happen. 

That’s why I hadn’t told you about this before. I’d built an escape plan in my head that I had no idea would ever work. It felt just as far-fetched as the thought of the road being repaired overnight. And with my luck, it was mission impossible.

But, against all odds, this Halloween, the veil has gotten thin enough to let humans through. 

I was finally able to leave. 

I felt so excited when Roger told me the second midnight struck on Halloween night. For the first time in years, the veil was thin enough. 

I felt a little bit bad, of course, since Roger and I had just moved in together, but I knew he’d understand that this was something I had to do. 

“Wait, you’re really leaving?” He asked on Halloween morning after we got home from work. 

“Of course,” I said, starting to pack. “You did know that I was going to leave eventually, right?”

“Well… yeah. But I wasn’t expecting it to be so soon,” he pouted. “Can’t you at least stay till the end of the day? You haven’t even told Linda you’re leaving!”

I sighed, sitting down on my bed. 

“I can tell her when I leave, she’s at the diner anyway,” I responded. 

He kept looking at me with those puppy eyes that I couldn’t resist. I took a deep breath and patted the spot next to me. When he sat, I continued speaking. “I can’t stay here forever, Roger. It’s not safe for me. It’s a miracle I’m still alive, really.”

“I know,” he admitted quietly. “I’m just going to miss you.”

“I’m gonna miss you too, you big dog,” I whispered, leaning against his shoulder.

We stood silent in that room for minutes, as I went over the possibility of staying in my head. However, for the first time ever, my instincts of self-preservation seemed to win, as I couldn’t find one good reason to stay. Except for them. The people I’ve met here, and the first friendships I’ve ever made. Still, that didn’t feel like a good enough reason to keep risking my life on the daily. 

After what felt like an eternity, Roger’s head shot up. 

“I have an idea!” He declared. “You don’t need to leave yet. There’s still a lot of time left before midnight, so let’s do something fun!”

“Like what?” I asked. 

“I could show you my favorite realm. Come on, Susan. Say yes, please!”

I pressed my lips together, hesitant. I knew that I should’ve said no. It was the sensible thing to do. But the truth is, I’m the cat curiosity killed. 

“Fine,” I said, not completely sure of my decision. 

So, we made our way to the diner, where Linda was busy taking orders. 

“Back so soon, dear?” She asked, though she had a knowing gleam in her eyes. To be honest, I doubt there are many things you can get past her. 

“Yep. We’re going somewhere special today,” Roger told her. 

Linda’s brow furrowed, but she only said, “Okay. Have fun." 

I smiled, nodding in her direction. 

“I’ll be here for the afternoon shift too, darling,” she called out without even turning to look at me. “We can say our goodbyes then.”

I walked over to Roger without replying. I didn’t know what to say. He was standing in front of the jukebox, the one that nobody ever used. He moved it out of the way, revealing the brick wall behind it. 

“Are you ready?” He asked. 

My chest felt heavy and my throat dry, but I still managed to let out a soft “yes.” It wasn’t fear I was feeling, but it wasn’t anything I could easily describe either. I wanted to do this, and, somehow, deep down, I also knew that I had to. 

Roger gave me a sheepish smile and grabbed my hand, pulling me along behind him. 

He walked straight toward the wall, and for a heartbeat, I believed that maybe this was all a prank. But instead of colliding with it, he suddenly disappeared. 

And it didn’t take long for me to follow. 

I’m not sure what I was expecting. Maybe a more seamless experience than this, that’s for sure. But stepping into the realm between realms was… an experience. 

Going into the in-between was nothing like leaving the Sea-bound realm. It felt like being swallowed by electricity. As soon as my body made contact with the portal, every synapse in my body fired up, and every single inch of skin started buzzing and tingling. That sensation was soon replaced by two stabs of pain on the top of my head. 

I moved my hands there, brushing them through my hair in search of whatever it was that had caused the sensation, but I gave up when I found nothing. 

It took me a few seconds to realize that the buzzing had subsided, leaving only the dull ache on my head, because we were no longer inside the portal. 

Instead, we stood in a long corridor lined with different doors in all shapes and sizes, stretching seemingly ad infinitum in one direction and ending in a wooden archway in the other. 

“Welcome to the in-between,” Roger said with a grin. 

I let out a shaky breath as a wide smile spread across my face. I was there. I really was there. My head still throbbed, but the illusion of the moment was too enthralling to ignore. 

“Wow…” I whispered, walking across the corridor to what looked like the back of a mirror. “What’s this?” My hand reached out without my permission, but before my fingers could touch the surface, another current of static bit at them. 

I giggled a bit, pulling the hand close to my chest. 

“That’s another entrance to the in-between,” Roger said with a smile. “If I’m not mistaken, this one leads to the Seven Realms Diner in New York.”

My smile widened even further. “New York? Oh, I’ve always wanted to go to New York!"

“Maybe you can tonight,” he shrugged. 

For a moment, joy soured into jealousy. These creatures were not only stronger, faster, and generally better than humans, but they also had the ability to live their lives as freely as they wanted to. All it took for them was one short trip through the in-between, at no cost at all. 

For me, being here had cost me everything. 

“Maybe,” I agreed quietly. 

“Come on, we’re going to miss the sunset if we don’t hurry up,” Roger started walking towards the archway, and I followed suit. 

“Where exactly are we going?” I asked. 

Instead of responding, he just winked, continuing his walk down the corridor. Beyond the archway, there was an empty abyss. Exactly what I would’ve imagined nothingness to look like, but as soon as Roger and I stepped through, the other side unfolded into a circular chamber, with six archways that extended into similar hallways like the one we’d just come from. 

“The in-between is not static, like the other realms,” he explained. “It moves and expands, it reads your intentions, and it adapts to them.”

“So, I’m guessing that the archway behind me leads to the human world, right?” He nodded. “Where do the others lead?” I asked, taking in the ornate archways that surrounded us.

Some were easy to guess. For instance, the one carved with sirens and ending in a trident tip was clearly the portal to the Sea-Bound Realm, but what about the rest?

“The one with the moon phases is Eternal Night, where vampires, and we, are rumored to come from. Then you have Sea-bound, which you’ve already been to,” he said, pointing to the arch that I thought was the one. “That one right there is the faerie realm,” He gestured at an arch draped in marble flowers that looked almost too lifelike to be carved. “Then you have the witch realm. And finally…” he stood in front of the only archway that didn’t lead to a corridor. “The greatest mystery to ever exist. Nobody knows what’s behind archway number six, as it’s been sealed for longer than anyone alive can remember.”

My feet moved on their own, and I tried to put my hand through the arch, but it hit what felt like a solid wall, and I quickly gave up. 

“This is incredible,” I breathed. 

“Come on, close your eyes.” I wanted to ask why, but the intensity of the glee in his gaze made me just obey him. I closed my eyes. “Now take my hand. I want the destination to be a surprise.”

I furrowed my brows, but ultimately decided to do what he told me. I would be lying if I said that I wasn’t intrigued. 

He tugged me forward, and we walked for a few minutes before stopping abruptly. 

“Are you ready?” He asked, and I just nodded. 

The static from earlier returned, but it wasn’t there for long. Once we were on the other side, it went away, along with the pressure on my head. 

“Can I open my eyes now?”

“Wait”

More seconds passed, and when Roger finally gave me the signal that I could open them now, I was glad I’d listened to him. 

The scenery in front of me was like nothing I’d seen before. The only word I can use to describe it is *breathtaking*, because the clearing we were standing in literally took my breath away. 

Sunlight poured over the greenest grass I’d ever seen, stretching endlessly in all directions. It looked so soft I almost wanted to roll in it. The few trees around us seemed older than anything on Earth, a strange and beautiful cross between weeping willows and pine trees. Colorful flowers poked lazily through the grass, and the trees were crowned with vivid magenta blossoms, each with five delicate petals shaped like tiny stars. 

“Wow,” I breathed out, my eyes so wide the sockets hurt. 

Roger chuckled. “I know. That was my first reaction too when I discovered this place.”

“Where are we?” I asked. 

“The faerie realm.”

“This is gorgeous.”

“Just wait till sunset,” He said. “It will be nighttime here soon.”

“What happens at sunset?”

“I’d hate to ruin the surprise,” he teased with a shrug. 

We walked deeper into the forest, as more and more trees like the ones from the clearing appeared. I could’ve spent an eternity there. However, soon the rays of sunlight turned a warmer shade of yellow until they ultimately died down in an explosion of oranges, pinks, and purples. It was truly a sight to behold. It felt like a scene taken straight out of a fairytale.

I thought that must have been what Roger wanted to show me—the sunset in the faerie realm. But as soon as the last sliver of sunlight vanished, the sky came alive. 

Have you ever seen the aurora borealis? What about fireworks? Now combine those two, and you will have a fuzzy picture of what the faery night sky looks like. 

We spent hours watching it, walking and talking beneath the shining lights. Every so often, a pang of guilt prickled at me for wanting to leave my best friend behind.

But even good things have to come to an end, and our friendship was the best of things. it was a pity that now it had to end.

We walked silently back to the clearing, following a path that unfurled before us with each step. It was halfway there when I foolishly decided that I needed to have a memento of this trip. 

I stretched on my toes, trying to reach one of the star-shaped flowers that now shimmered and changed colors beneath the glowing sky. 

The problem was, I was too short, and I couldn’t reach any of the flowers. Actually, the branch looked like it was moving away from my reach the more I tried to grab it. My survival instincts finally kicked in, and I decided that it was a bad idea to piss off whatever was actively preventing me from grabbing a flower. 

Frustrated, I gave up the notion of a souvenir. 

But Roger didn’t seem to get the memo, because as soon as I stepped away from the tree, he stretched his arm and plucked one of the delicate things with a quick flick of his wrist. 

“Here,” he said, casual as ever, handing it to me. 

I gasped, bracing for danger, but when nothing happened, I reluctantly reached for the flower in his hand. 

“Thank you. That was really nice of you,” I said. 

“Always,” he replied, grinning.  

Then, of course, my suspicions were obviously confirmed. 

A giant net woven out of vines and foliage instead of rope that *definitely* hadn’t been there before unfurled from the tree, trapping Roger in. 

I screamed, stumbling backward to avoid getting caught in the trap too, when a woman stepped out of the trunk. She marched straight toward Roger, who was struggling on the ground beneath the net. 

“Who dares steal my flowers?” She barked. 

“Fuck,” I heard Roger whisper under his breath. 

“We’re sorry,” I jumped in, offering the woman her flower back. “We didn’t know that these were yours,” I forced a smile, hoping that for the first time ever, something would go right for me. 

“Sorry? YOU’RE sorry?” She tutted a few times, shaking her head. “No. Completely unacceptable. This—” she kicked Roger hard in the stomach, and he screamed in pain—“*dog* should be the one to apologize.”

“Sorry,” Roger coughed through the pain. 

“Please. This is a misunderstanding—” I interjected. 

“Oh no, love. It is not,” her eyes returned to Roger’s figure. “Mhm… the little wolfie without his maw… how ironic is it that he’ll be all gobbled up?” She laughed. 

At that moment, she opened her mouth so wide that her jaw dislocated with a sickening crack. Her whole mouth, which had been completely normal and human-like not one second prior, enlarged so much that it looked like a gaping void, and every single one of her teeth sharpened into fangs so long that they jutted out past her lips. 

She took slow, deliberate steps toward the net, completely ignoring my existence. “I haven’t had werewolf in so long.” Her delighted tone was muffled by the teeth, but her words could still be understood. 

I nearly dropped the branch I’d picked up from the floor while she was distracted. My intestines quivered, and I had the immense urge to run away, but I could never do something like that to Roger. Instead, I took a deep breath, and the whimper that came out of the yellow-eyed werewolf instilled some bravery into me. 

The creature grabbed the top of the net and yanked it upward, hoisting Roger into the air like a caught animal. 

I forced myself to raise the branch high enough to be able to hit the woman on the head as the splinters of the wood dug into my skin. But it proved to be too heavy for me to raise it above my own head. 

The creature grabbed Roger’s leg and poked it through the net as he kicked and struggled to try and remove it from her grasp. Then she bit down hard on his thigh, ripping a chunk off. The werewolf hollered in pain, and I took it as an opportunity to act despite my nausea and the tears that were starting to blur my vision. 

The adrenaline rush caused by the horror of the scene finally gave me the strength to be able to hoist the branch high enough, allowing me to strike it down on the back of her head with a sickening thud. 

The sound of wood connecting with bone sent a wave of dizziness through me. 

I was expecting her to fall, knocked out like in the movies, or at least to get some sort of reaction from the pain. Instead, her hand quickly shot up to grab the branch, and she threw it to the side with such force that I was the one who ended up screeching in pain when my wrist was bent from the motion. 

I took my hand to my chest, panting, as she slowly moved her unblinking eyes toward me. 

I took one step back, but she was faster, as she lounged on top of me, pinning me to the ground. Something sharp stuck into my side, and I screamed, but not from pain, but from the sadistic smile on the woman’s face. 

I whimpered as her nose trailed my neck, and then my body. A hunger unlike anything I’d ever seen before lit in her eyes. I struggled against her grasp, trying to break free, as her mouth *almost* closed around my arm. 

Then, suddenly, she stopped. 

I didn’t have time to feel relieved, because as soon as she stopped, she grabbed me by my collar and threw me against the tree, flicking her wrist to call over new branches that surrounded my upper body into a suffocating embrace. My back was in agony, but I had no time to waste, as I still tried to break free in a futile attempt. 

I forced myself to take a peek at Roger, who was hyperventilating as he held his leg close to his chest. I couldn’t help but wonder why he wasn’t transforming right then. Werewolves healed instantly when transformed, and contrary to popular belief, a full moon was not necessary for the change. 

“What a treat!” She shrieked. “I haven’t had one of you in… centuries!” Her eyes sparkled with malice as she laughed like a kid in a candy store. 

She approached me again, trailing her finger along my jaw. 

“We’re sorry, please just let us go,” I begged, crying profusely.

“Let you go?” She cackled. “Oh no, love. You are going to be my tribute to the queen! I won’t have to hunt for at least another century with you as a snack. Maybe she’ll even let me keep the werewolf.” Her face turned back to the one she wore before she revealed her true nature. “Both of you, stay right here. I’ll fetch the queen, and then we will feast on you!”

After the creature left, I could only hear Roger’s whines and my crying. I was sure that all was lost, as any movement proved pointless in the tight embrace of branches. 

“Susan,” Roger groaned. His breathing hitched between every word. “Listen to me.”

I nodded, though I doubted he could see it. 

“I have a knife in my boot.” His foot slammed weakly into my hand. “It’s sharp enough to cut through wood,” his words came slower now, and his breath labored. With every whisper, his pain could be felt in the air. “Grab it… and run. Bring… back… help.” These last words sounded much weaker now, but he still managed to shove his foot as close to my hand as possible.

I struggled for what felt like forever, stretching my bruised wrist painfully until I was finally able to pull the knife out of his boot. I’m not sure how long it took to saw through the branches, but I was relieved to have Roger talking me through it, both because I felt less alone and because hearing him talk meant that he was still alive. 

Once I was free, I looked back at him to promise that I would be back, but he had passed out. I wanted to check on him, but I knew that this would mean wasting even more precious time. 

I limped my way through the in-between—even though I felt strangely better in there—leaving splatters of blood along the stone corridors. I was relieved when Roger was right about the in-between reading your intention, as the first door upon entering the human section was the one at our diner. 

I stumbled through it, falling to the floor as the rush of energy that I’d had in there vanished. Luckily, not many people were eating there that night, and few people witnessed my humiliation. 

When I looked up, Martha was staring at me from behind the counter—clearly covering for my absence. And next to her was none other than Lucien. The moment I fell through the wall, he was on his feet, his eyes scanning over my whole body to find the source of the blood. He ran to me with that inhuman speed and helped me to my feet, supporting my weight as I was weak from fear and pain. 

“Oh, lord,” Martha gasped, rushing over as soon as Lucien eased me into a chair. “I knew something had to have happened when Roger didn’t show up tonight!”

“What happened?” Lucien’s voice came out almost as a growl, and he gave me a look that made me shiver. “Who did this to you?” 

He just stood there, his fists clenched. 

“There’s no time for this,” I panted, forcing myself upright after glancing at the clock. 10.23 p.m., less than two hours to midnight. 

There truly wasn’t any time left. The whole ordeal had eaten up nearly all of Halloween in the human realm. If we didn’t act soon, Roger would die, because I couldn’t send just anyone after him. It had to be me. Nobody else knew how to get to that clearing, and the in-between doesn’t respond to vague ideas of a destination. 

Lucien insisted on following me through the dark, empty streets of Monsterville as I explained, between gasps, what had happened and my plan. Roger had no idea what kind of faerie that had been. He hadn’t seen anything like her before. But, if there’s one thing that he knows to be commonplace for most faeries, it is that they are almost always nearly invincible. The one thing that can kill, or even injure, every single type of faerie is iron. And there was only one place in the whole town where there was some iron to spare. 

I kept trying to shake Lucien off, because the last thing I needed right then was the vampire meddling again, but he refused to leave my side even when we arrived at the police station. I was happy to see that the sheriff was still there, working late, when we went in. 

“What the hell happened to you?” he asked, clearly annoyed but alarmed by the sight of me.

“I need the iron rod,” I said, breathless. “The one I helped you pull out of that guy.” My voice trembled. “Please.” 

He refused at first, seeing as it was evidence that he was obligated to keep in custody. But, as soon as I told him what I needed it for, he rushed to bring it to me, encased in a leather case to protect themselves from its power. 

“Thank you,” I breathed, taking it carefully, already starting to leave.

The sheriff shook his head. “You’re not going without me.” He retorted, grabbing his gun. 

We didn’t argue, of course. However tense their relationship was, the sheriff was still Roger’s father, and the instinct to protect him must’ve run deep. 

We arrived at the diner in record time and went straight into the in-between, not bothering to even waste one more precious second. The whole thing had taken up a whole hour of our time, and now I ran into the risk of becoming trapped in the faerie realm if we didn’t hurry up with the rescue. 

I confidently led us through the maze of corridors straight into the correct doorway, as I prayed that we wouldn’t be too late. 

The sheriff was the first to step through. I  was about to follow when Lucien’s hand shot out, grabbing my arm and yanking me back. 

“You did your part,” he said, his eyes fixed on mine. 

“No. I didn’t.” I shot back, fighting a wave of tears. I hated showing my emotions to him. I knew he couldn’t be trusted. 

“You did,” he insisted, leaning in. “This might be your last chance to leave for a while. Or you could end up trapped in the faerie realm. Or even worse: in the in-between,” he hissed. 

“What do you care?” I snapped, suddenly furious. All he’d done since I’d arrived was to put me in danger, except for that one instance where he saved my life only to demand a life-debt in return. 

“I don’t,” he said too quickly, his tone flat. But there was an edge to his voice that made it so obvious that he was lying that it hurt.  

“Then don’t.” I tried to move past him again, but he caught me a second time. 

“So stubborn,” he muttered, though there was the faintest hint of a smile tugging at his lips. He shoved his hand into the pocket of his pants and pulled out a golden watch. He delicately took my injured wrist in his hands and fastened the watch around it. The coldness of the gold relieved some of the pain. 

“If it gets to ten minutes to midnight,” he said quietly, “you run. No matter what. You come straight back here and leave.”

I opened my mouth to protest, but he stopped me by tightening his grip on my hand. “Promise me, Bloody.”

I pursed my lips in anger, but I knew that arguing would only be a waste of time. “Fine. I promise.”

He let go of me then and pushed me gently into the faerie realm. 

This time, stepping into it didn’t feel as magical as it had the first time. Dawn was coming, and the beautiful lights in the sky were gone, as sunlight began to bathe the clearing in a soft golden color. However, the beauty of the flowers—which had once delighted me—did nothing but make my stomach churn. 

The sheriff had already disappeared into the forest, probably following his son’s scent to the creature’s tree. Lucien began walking in that direction as well, tipped off by something I couldn’t sense. A new bout of jealousy hit me out of nowhere because I felt like I was practically useless in this rescue. If it wasn’t for my ability to touch iron, I wouldn’t even have a purpose here at all.

But I shoved it back in because there was no time for that at all.

The walk to the tree was extremely eerie, and I am ashamed to admit that I was relieved Lucien was with me. 

Our journey was abruptly interrupted when we noticed that the Sheriff wasn’t ahead of us anymore. Instead, he was pinned to the same tree I had been pinned to before, and now not one fae, but two stood at its feet. 

Lucien grabbed me by my arm and pulled me forcefully behind a trunk to make sure that we were out of their sight. 

The woman from before—the one who tried to eat Roger—was kneeling on the grass, her face streaked with blood, as another woman stood imposingly above her.

The stranger wore that same wrong smile and the same huge mouth of teeth. The diamond crown on her brow alerted me that this must’ve been the queen.

The first fae’s head twisted dangerously when the other one slapped her, leaving clawed red marks across her cheek.

The sheriff’s eyes locked with mine, and he pursed his lips, which I took as a message to keep quiet. 

“You promised me one of *them* on top of a werewolf,” the queen slapped the first fairy again. “And what do you have for me instead? One measly werewolf that can’t even transform, and his pitiful excuse for a father?”

“I’m sorry, your highness. I’m sorry—” the faerie pleaded, extending her arms on the floor and putting her forehead on the grass. “I promise I had her. But you know how clever they are!”

The queen sneered, and her face turned into the meaning of calmness. Somehow, that was the scariest thing I’d seen all night. She smiled sweetly—or at least as sweet as a smile can be when it’s blocked by sharp teeth—at the bowed fairy and laughed merrily. 

“I will eat the werewolves. It’s never a bad thing to have some of their power. But first, I will eat you.”

The faerie quickly shot up back to her knees, wide-eyed and frantic. 

“No— Please!”

The queen ignored her, laughing merrily once more, as her jaw dislocated even further. The needle-thin teeth glistened in the early morning sun as the queen approached the other faerie.  

Meanwhile, the sheriff was desperately trying to wake Roger up, but it was futile in the end. 

The fairy didn’t have time to move. She didn’t even have time to scream. Because the queen engulfed her head in one big bite, leaving the rest of her body upright for a few seconds before it finally fell to the ground.  

Taking advantage of the distraction that chewing presented for the queen, Lucien moved before I could even process what was happening. One moment, he was next to me. The next, he slammed his fist in her jaw, sending the faerie flying backward into a tree with such force that it toppled over.

I sprinted to the sheriff and started sawing at the branches that bound him. 

He took the knife from my hand. “I got it,” he grunted, after I freed the best part of his arm,  nodding toward the leather bag holding the rod. 

I left him to it as I fumbled with the latch. The sheriff hit the ground with a heavy thud, and he immediately went to Roger, hauling him down. I took a moment to glance back at Roger, and my shoulders sagged in relief when I saw the rise and fall of his chest. He was alive. And his leg was already healing. I thanked supernatural healing before returning my attention to the bag. 

I peeked quickly at the watch, marking eight minutes to midnight, and I cringed. 

Just as I managed to remove the rod from the bag, a sudden shriek cut through the chaos. 

“Lucien!” I screamed as he landed at my feet, clutching a deep gash in his stomach. He grunted in pain as the queen moved her attention to me. For one awful second, I felt like she was looking straight into my soul. She tilted her head to the side. The grotesque mass of teeth, flesh, and blood grew in both size and horror when her scowl turned into a macabre grin. 

A chill ran down my spine when her focus remained entirely on my form, and I barely had time to gasp before she lunged at me. 

I closed my eyes as I braced for impact, almost able to feel the sharpness of her claws raking across my skin. 

Seven minutes to midnight.

But the sheriff intercepted her, shoving his own claws in her abdomen, though the move barely slowed her down, because she was able to lift him off the ground in one swift movement, throwing him across the woods against a tree. 

I strengthened my grip on the rod as Lucien staggered back to his feet. He bared his teeth in her direction, and the sheriff managed to scramble upright as well. Both of them lounged at the queen at once. 

Somehow, they managed to contain her, but I knew that they wouldn’t be able to hold her for long. 

Six minutes to midnight. 

“Do it!” Lucien shouted, grunting as he struggled to keep the queen in place. 

My mind went blank, and my body moved out of pure instinct. I drove the rod forward with every ounce of strength that I had. It went in unnaturally smoothly, the flat surface of the rod sliding in like a warm knife in butter. 

She screeched before going limp in their arms, and she suddenly started to dissolve. Her body turned instantly to ash, blowing away in the wind. 

Five minutes to midnight. 

I was still holding the rod—panting and shaking, likely in shock, as tears streamed down my face. 

For a moment, we all stood there, unmoving, until I felt two ghostly pressure points on the top of my head, just like I did in the in-between. Then, out of nowhere, there was a burning—searing—sensation in my hands. 

I screamed, dropping the rod to the ground. 

My shock intensified when I looked down, because instead of white palms, red and raw skin met my eyes. Burnt skin.

“Wh—” I tried to speak, but my throat had gone dry. I couldn’t stop staring at the skin that had already started blistering. 

Lucien approached me slowly, like I was a caged animal that would bolt if he moved too fast. He took my hands gently, turning them over in his palms. He took a deep breath, and his eyes widened for a second. He quickly schooled his expression and plastered a soothing smile on his face. But I’d seen it. I’d seen the shock in his face at whatever it was that he had smelled. 

He carefully brushed his fingertips across my scorched skin, leaving streaks of his own blood on them, and the relief was instant. The redness instantly disappeared, leaving undamaged skin once more. Like it had never happened at all. 

His eyes found mine, softer than I ever imagined they could be. His other hand rose to my cheek, thumb brushing away the tears that streaked my face. 

“You have to go!” The sheriff yelled, breaking the spell I had fallen under Lucien’s touch. 

Lucien cursed under his breath, checking the watch still latched to my wrist. 

Three minutes to midnight. 

My lungs seized. There was no way I’d make it back to the in-between and into the diner before midnight. I’d be trapped here. Or in the in-between. I didn’t know which sounded worse. 

But Lucien had other plans. He scooped an arm around my waist, hauling me over his shoulder like I weighed nothing.

“You’d better hold on!” He said, breaking into vampiric speed. It took us less than a minute to reach the realm between realms, where Lucien had to put me back on the ground, as super speed didn’t work there. 

We began running as fast as we could, hoping that the in-between could sense our desperation and arrange the doors in a way that allowed us to get to the diner faster. 

And for a moment, I believed that our prayers had been answered. Because we burst through the wall at the diner with no issues. I fell to the floor on my knees once more under the gaze of Martha and all the customers. 

I felt relieved. We’d made it. 

But my stomach dropped when my gaze fell on the clock on the wall. We made it back, sure. But not before midnight. 

I froze when I saw that the clock on the wall marked one minute past midnight. 

That shouldn’t have been possible. Humans can’t cross the border to the in-between once Halloween is over, whether they’re in or out. And I did. 

At that moment, the truth that I’d been trying so hard to ignore stared at me incessantly.

Because maybe I wasn’t as human as I thought.  

I shoved it all in for the moment. Thankfully, to every single person in there, one minute was close enough, and they didn’t even notice that I was late. 

The only people who know the truth, at least for now, are Lucien and Roger. Except for the sheriff, who probably suspects something, since he saw how my hands burned when I touched the iron. 

I got home a few hours later, after Roger came to and we got some food into him. The sheriff helped him to our house, and I told him half jokingly that maybe we should re-evaluate his definition of fun for next time. 

He’s okay. Scared, traumatized, and it’ll be a while until his leg fully heals. The chunk that the faery bit off probably won’t ever grow back. But he’s alive. He’s even joking again, which is nice.

I didn’t ask him about what she said—that he’s a werewolf who can’t transform. I don’t think he’s ready for that conversation yet.

I'm not either, if I'm being honest.

Right now, I’m just trying to process everything. Trying to make a deal with myself that I won’t lie to myself or to you, again. Because I did. 

When I told you the second week that the burn came from the boiler… I don’t remember ever touching the boiler. Only the iron. But the burn was small enough. Insignificant enough that I didn’t want to see what was right in front of me. That time, the burn was barely superficial, nowhere near as bad as this time. 

When I was being sacrificed, and they placed that bundle in my mouth, it was supposed to cause complete paralysis. It didn’t. I only dared tell you that I could move a toe when in reality I was able to move my whole foot. 

I didn’t say anything because I still wanted to believe I was human. I mean, how could I not? I show up in this bizarre town full of monsters, and suddenly I’m not human? It sounded insane.

But I’m not.

I’m not human.

And I don’t know what I am.

Maybe my parents would know. But we don’t exactly have the best relationship. And what Lucien said about my blood type… he’s probably right. I don’t think they’re really my parents.

And yes. I tried going into the in-between again. And… it worked. 

I’m not trapped in the human realm or the town anymore. Something changed that night. Or maybe something that was always there just… woke up.

I could leave anytime I wanted now. But I can’t. Not yet.

Because as much as I want to leave this town, my one goal ever since I got here, I can’t do that anymore.

Now, I need to know what I am.

Who I am.

Why I’m like this.

And why my parents hid it from me.

Why they sheltered me.

And why they hurt me my whole life.

Now I need answers. 

And I know that leaving won't provide them [for me.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1qb0yp3/seven_realms_diner_the_wizard/)
