Karl slammed the door open and rushed outside, taking deep breaths before I could turn off the car.


"Geez Karl, is there anything that doesn't make you sick?"


"S-shut up Tom. I told you I would get car sickness."


"Maybe you should have eaten less for lunch."


"Come on Tom, those switchbacks weren't easy to deal with. If I hadn't been driving, I would feel dizzy as well." I took off my seatbelt and got out of the driver's seat.


"You guys sure you don't want to go back and spend the holidays at home? We are in the wild here! Light years away from civilization!" Said Tom with a smug expression, as he got out of the car.


"Sure, Tom, I bet our Stone Age ancestors lived in a cabin just like the one we rented." Karl opened the Trunk and tossed Tom his backpack.


"Alright, alright but you get what I mean. We're lucky if we got running water inside." Tom was checking his phone. "I barely have any reception."


Karl grabbed his bag and closed the trunk. "It's not off-grid, don't be silly. The keys should be under the doormat, can you check, Ethan?" His face was still pale from the car sickness.


The mountain air filled our nostrils, as the forest extended far beyond our eyes could see. A cozy-looking cabin sat in a clearing where the dirt road ended. 


We initially opted for a camping trip for our sophomore spring break, but our parents-- especially Karl's-- were very worried about the possible dangers, so we settled for a cabin instead.


I flipped the doormat and found a bear paw keyring from underneath.  "There is no spare. I'll keep them if you guys don't mind.."


"Good idea. We can agree Tom isn't reliable," Karl said with a mocking smile.


Tom rolled his eyes. As I opened the door, he rushed inside and went for the kitchen. The cabin had two floors: a living room and the kitchen downstairs and, a bedroom and bathroom upstairs.


"Holy shit, the fridge is stacked." Echoed Tom from the kitchen "There is even a pack of beers!"


We joined Tom in the kitchen as he was examining the fridge. "Shouldn't the owner be aware that we're underage?"


A hissing sound followed as Tom cracked open a cold one. " Who cares, Ethan. It's just a few beers." He took a long sip and handed the can to Karl, who reluctantly also took a sip.


I sighed and waited for Karl to take a sip myself. "Let's unpack our bags upstairs, then let's see what to eat for dinner."


The following night wasn't particularly eventful. We watched one of the Blu-ray movies we found, then stayed up late on the porch, chatting and drinking.


Right before waking up, I dreamed of Karl calling my name, but as I opened my eyes the only noise to greet me was the bedroom window being slammed repeatedly by the wind. I realized I was still wearing the same clothes as when we arrived. 


No one else was in the bedroom. I closed the window as the wind's howling echoed outside, and after a quick bathroom trip, I made my way downstairs.


"G'morning Ethan. What the fuck was that noise?" Tom was lying on the couch. He didn't look like he had been awake for long either.


"There is a strong wind raging outside, it was slamming the bedroom window." 


"No, I mean earlier. Didn't you hear some kind of howling?" He made his way to the kitchen.


I shook my head. "No, must have been the wind."


"Whatever," Tom filled the glass with water, "just wake up Karl and tell him to come down for breakfast."


I gave him a puzzled look. "Wait, what? I thought Karl was here already."


Tom froze, staring at the water in his glass. "He's not here. Where the hell could he have been gone? His jacket and backpack are still there."


I stepped outside on the porch. There was no sign of Karl outside, and our car was still parked. "He's not outside either. I'll call him."


A noise resonated from the kitchen. I went over the counter and examined the source of the ringtone. "It's his phone! Do you remember the last time you saw him?" Moments of silence followed as we tried to think about the events of last night. 


"We watched that movie, then stayed on the porch until... I don't know, 2 AM? Then we went to bed. I don't remember seeing Karl leaving."


"Yeah, me neither. By the way, why were you sleeping on the couch?"


"Because you and Karl were snoring like crazy at some point. But I would have noticed if he ran outside in the middle of the night."


"Chances are he sleepwalked outside and got lost. We better go look for him."


Tom nodded. "Yeah. He can't have gone too far."


We started looking for Karl in the nearby woods. Around ten minutes later, Tom grabbed my arm. "Look, under that tree!"


A flash of blue caught my sight as I strained my eyes. "That must be him" Next to a large old tree, someone was slumped next to the trunk. I recognized the blue sweater Karl was wearing.


"Karl! Are you alright?" He was lying curled up on the ground, cowering his face, as if he were trying to hide in the burrow at the base of the tree.


Karl didn't seem to acknowledge our presence. "Karl! It's us. Are you ok?" I grabbed his shoulder and shook him, causing him to lower his hands. His face was marked with signs of tears, and his eyes were filled with terror.


Karl pushed himself up against the trunk. "E-ethan! W-where is he?" He was panting heavily. His clothes were dirty with mud and foliage, but there weren't any signs of blood or injuries.


"It's just me and Tom, Karl. Are you hurt?"


"N-no, you d-don't understand, he was there, you have to go away..."


"Karl, you're nothing making any sense. Who is there? Did someone attack you?"


He looked around, his eyes scouting the surroundings to search for something.
"N-no, he c-called me last night and I had to f-follow him..."


"Who are you talking about?"


"T-the man with the skull... He lives nearby..."


I gave Tom a puzzled look. He was just as creeped out as I was. "You don't seem injured. Let's go back to the cabin first, then you'll tell us everything--"


A noise like a distorted, low-pitched howling could be heard in the distance. Karl screamed, closing his eyes.


"It's him! Run away! Don't look into his eyes!"


"Calm down Karl, it's just a moose. We are in a forest, remember? Ethan, help me get him back up." We helped Karl stand up. His legs were still trembling.


"Come on Karl, we are not far from the cabin." I put Karl's arm around his neck and helped him walk.


We made our way back to the cabin with Karl occasionally stuttering nonsense and frantically looking over his shoulder. We made him lay on the bed and gave him some water.


"Karl, can we talk now? Do you remember what happened?"


Karl took a sip of water and cleared his throat. "Last night. Someone...He called my name while I was sleeping."


"Who? Did you see his face?" Tom was looking outside the bedroom window.


Karl shook his head. "He wears a horned animal skull. A moose I think. He told me to follow him or he would take you two instead."


"And you went outside to follow him?"


"I'm sorry guys... His voice is very convincing... I don't think he's a person like us. He made me look into his eyes... Those weren't human eyes. That was when I ran away. I can't forget those eyes anymore."


"Are you really sure that didn't happen in a nightmare?"


"Yes! I wasn't dreaming!" He slammed his fist on the nightstand, spilling some of the water into the glass. "We have to leave before he comes back."


"Karl, maybe you should first get some rest upstairs. You look really tired. We can talk again later."


"We can't wait here anymore. We have to go now!"


"Karl, we can't just--" The noise could be heard again. This time it sounded more like a bark than a howling, and it was much closer.


"H-he's here. We don't have time!"


"Karl, it's just an animal, calm down. Right, Tom?"


Tom was looking out the window. As he turned around, his face had become pale. "Ethan... What the fuck is that?"


He pointed at a distant tree. I went to the window and looked closely. A moose skull could be seen next to a tree in the distance. After squinting, I could see the skull belonged to what seemed an absurdly tall human figure.


Me and Tom looked at each other without speaking a word. The realization of what we believed was just a nightmare crept up on us, and my heart started pounding. I was sweating.


"Ethan, maybe Karl is right. We have to go. I'll get the backpacks."


"I told you, there is no time!" Karl had gotten up from the bed. "Ethan, get the keys!"


I didn't even have time to process what happened before I heard the noise again, coming from downstairs. I froze, as heavy footsteps resonated from the ground floor.


"W-what the fuck!" Tom brandished the lamp from the nightstand. We moved as far back as we could from the stairs, as the footsteps grew closer.


"Don't look into his eyes!" I turned my attention to Karl, who tried to hide under the bed. Then I heard Tom scream, and the sound of the lamp dropping on the floor. Out of the corner of my eye, I noticed something else was in the room.


As I turned around, an inhumanely tall figure was standing in front of me. It was wearing a moose skull, but I couldn't see its face let alone the eyes, and the rest of its body was draped in a black fur coat. The eye holes in the skull were nothing but pitch black as it stared at me, motionless, hunched forward to not touching the ceiling.


I tried to scream, but no sound came out of my mouth. I tried to move, but every muscle in my body was frozen. Then my vision faded and I passed out a few seconds later.


I was lying on the bedroom floor when I regained my senses.  "Tom! What happened?"
He was standing there, like frozen in place. There was no one else in the bedroom.


I put a hand on his shoulder. "Tom? Where is Karl?" He had a blank expression on his face and was staring at the wall, like hypnotized. "Tom! Wake up!" I shook him violently. 
"Where is Ka--" He grabbed my hand without looking at me, with no change in his expression. 


"We'll be going. He is with us. You can leave now." His voice was a whisper.


"Tom, what the fuck are you--" I suddenly got pushed to the wall, hurting my head in the process. As I reopened my eyes, I was alone. I bolted downstairs, but he was gone.


I checked outside while calling 911, but nobody was there either. The police told me to come to the station as they couldn't send anyone up there for a while. 


Karl and Tom were filed as missing persons. I went home as they opened an investigation, but no traces have been found so far, after one month. 


What's crazy is that the police told us not to expect much since many people go missing while camping in this area. The local media barely talked about us and dismissed it as drunk teenagers getting lost in the woods.


I had issues sleeping at night after what happened. I often expect to wake up and see that skull staring at me. I thought they were just nightmares, until this morning.


I was still half-asleep when I heard Tom and Karl calling my name. I woke up, but I was alone, and the windows in my room were open. I was sure I closed them last night.
