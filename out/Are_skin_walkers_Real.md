Me and my family recently went on a camping trip in the middle of Texas around marble falls. We had a pretty long drive but fortunately for me it was uneventful. When we got there we got up and went fishing. on our way to go fish we split up, one group taking a truck and the other taking our jeep. In total there were about 9 of us. One group had 5 and the other had 4. I took the truck along with all the other cousins. After a while of fishing we headed back to our tents we had set up in the forest. It soon got dark and we started a campfire. We roasted marshmallows and told ghost stories, after my favorite aunt finished telling one all of us heard a high pitched yell echo from the woods. After the woods went completely silent. My little cousin snapped the woods out of its trance as he began to bawl his eyes out. my aunt and uncle began to comfort him but i could tell that all of us were horrified by what we had just heard. I thought that nobody would be able to sleep that night, but about 20 minutes later we were all in our tents. I shared a tent with my brother who is older than me, and stuck in the phase where he has to be cooler than all of me and my younger cousins. I had tried to express my feelings of worry with him, for once he understood but tried to rationalize the story/what happened. Eventually we both fell asleep due to how tired we were from fishing and playing in the lake.  
  
I woke up later at around 4 in the morning to another scream that had i slightly lower pitch. I urgently woke up my brother without turning on the light scared whatever was making the noises would see or spot me and my families campsite. He wouldn't wake up, I heard the scream again and it was closer. I went completely still, scared half to death. A while later I heard it again but it was much much farther. It kept getting farther and farther and farther with every scream. But every scream that came it became even higher pitched. I was surprised by how apparently none of my other family members that i were staying with were awoken to the sounds of these creature.  I was completely horrified for the rest of the night. and could not fall back asleep. When I woke up my mother could tell how tired I was due to how as soon as i woke up I wouldn't  move. I told her everything and she explained it to the family. We moved campsites and finished our vacation. I still had no idea what it was. For the rest of the time we were there nothing happened revolving that creature or any noises. but I hope whatever did happen does not happen ever again. does anyone know what that creature could be??
