“Kyle!” I shouted, running towards him. “Stop!”

He turned and looked at me in surprise. 

“But grandpa wa—“ He didn’t finish the sentence. I wrapped my arms around him and pulled him away from the window. We crashed to his bed together just as Peter came in. 

“What the—“ he began, his eyes frozen on the creature at the window. 

“Close the curtains!” I cried, pressing Kyle against my chest. I didn’t want him to see anything. I heard Peter cross the room then the swish of the curtains closing. I didn’t know if the creature was gone, but I was glad we couldn’t see it. 

I laid on the bed for a few minutes, just rocking Kyle back and forth. He hugged me tight, scared only because he knew we were. 

“Molly…” Peter finally said, breaking the silence. His voice was low and serious, and instantly I knew something was wrong.  “Come look at this.”

I pried Kyle away from my chest and got him back under the covers. Whatever Peter needed me to see, taking care of Kyle was more important. 

“Hey, baby,” I said, fighting to make my voice sound calm and confident. I played with his curly hair, rubbed the side of his head. 

“What’s going on, Mommy?” he said. Just like his father, his brown eyes were wide with fear. 

“It’s okay, baby. You don’t need to worry,” I said. 

“Why can’t we let Grandpa in?” Kyle asked. I hesitated before answering. I didn’t want to scare him, but I also needed him to know the seriousness of the situation. 

“We’re playing a little game,” I finally said. “If anyone else you know comes to your window, don’t open it, okay? No matter what. Even if it’s me or Daddy. You understand?”

Kyle looked confused, but he nodded. I smiled at him in response. 

“Good boy,” I said, bending over to kiss his forehead. “Daddy and I are gonna go talk, but you just stay here, okay?” I pulled out my phone and placed it on his nightstand. “If you get scared or hear someone outside, you can use this,” I said, pointing to the phone. “You can play or watch any of the games or shows you want, okay? Just don’t open the window. Don’t even open the curtains. You got that?”

Kyle’s eyes brightened at the prospect of screen time at night. He nodded vigorously. I leaned forward again and kissed him on the forehead once more, breathing in his scent. 

“Okay, baby, I love you. Just stay here and call for us if you need anything.” I got up and left the room, leaving the door cracked open. Peter stood in the doorway of the hallway bathroom. 

“Come look at this,” he said. We walked into the bathroom. I moved to turn on the lights, but he stopped me. 

“Keep them off,” he whispered. “So they can’t see us.” He then moved me toward the window that overlooked the backyard. 

At first, I couldn’t see anything, just an expanse of oily blackness that all melted together. Then, as my eyes adjusted to the darkness, I could just make out shapes. A darker black against the background. 

Someone was standing in our backyard. A group of people, I couldn’t tell how many, were gathered in our yard. 

Without saying a word, I shot out of the bathroom and down the stairs. I wasn’t going to let these things terrorize me and my family.

I got to the back door and turned on the deck light. A burst of bright white light flooded across the backyard, casting everything in sharp contrast. 

Just as I’d expected, six people stood in our yard, their backs to us. They ranged in heights, two children among them. They wore normal clothes—jackets, jeans, sweaters—and they looked perfectly normal from behind. But no one normal would act like this. 

I tapped on the thick glass, my nail making a sharp rap into the night. 

“Hey, fuckers, leave us alone!” I shouted, my voice rising with each syllable. I was pounding on the glass now, trying to rid them like a pest. “Get the hell out of our yard and don’t come back!”

I hated seeing them here, hated their presence. This was supposed to be our happy, new beginning, and now it was tainted by these things. 

I opened my mouth to shout again when one of the figures began to turn around slowly. It was only halfway turned when I recognized the face. 

It was me. Pale skin, blue eyes, dark hair. It even had the mole right under my mouth. It stared at me, its face holding a too-wide smile that revealed sharp teeth. The eyes, although the right color, were too long, too narrow.

I stepped away from the door, a gasp caught in my throat. Then two more figures turned around, their faces near-perfect imitations of Peter and Kyle save for the reptilian features.

“Leave us alone!” I shouted, backing away from the door. The porch light flickered, washing the backyard in darkness for just a moment, then it came back on to reveal the three creatures suddenly at the door. They scratched and clawed at the glass window, all while calling out. 

“Let us in,” the not-Peter called. 

“Please, Mommy, I’m cold.”

“It’s okay. You can trust us.”

They cried and cried, still scratching at the wood and glass. The noise bit into my ears, made my whole body ache and tremble. 

I moved toward the door, covering my ears. I didn’t want to be any closer to them, even with the house between us. But I needed them to leave, needed them to stop. I placed my hand on the light switch, and they fell silent, watching me closely. 

“Get out of my yard,” I whispered, “and get out of my life.” Before they could react, I turned off the light. The yard returned to darkness, my terrified face reflected in the dark glass. I waited a moment then turned the light back on, bracing myself. 

But the yard was empty, all of the figures gone. I looked around, making certain they were nowhere, then turned off the light and headed back upstairs. 

Peter and I curled up in our bed with Kyle, his warm body pressed tightly between us. It had been almost an hour, and we hadn’t seen or heard the creatures outside. 

It had taken me at least another hour to fall asleep, and I was surprised at how deep it was. I’d been expecting to sleep fitfully, but I didn’t wake until nearly five in the morning. Not a long rest, but given the night we’d had, I was grateful. 

Kyle wasn’t in the bed with us anymore, and Peter snored evenly on his side. 

Quietly, I snuck out of bed and into the hallway. I crept to Kyle’s bedroom and cracked open the door. The nightlight was off, but I could just make out his little body under the covers. 

I smiled then closed his door before sneaking downstairs. Maybe I could make a big breakfast for everyone when they were awake. It would be a few hours from now, but I could help us move on from the horrible night we had. Then Peter and I would talk about what to do next. 

Before that, though, I walked around the house, checking all the doors and windows. The creatures hadn’t bothered us again, but I needed to check again, needed to make sure. 

All the doors were still locked, and all the windows with curtains had them drawn tight, the brightening darkness kept at bay. I was satisfied with my inspection when, off in the living room, I heard a faint noise. It sounded like birdsong, a chirpy little tune that was in sharp contrast to the evening I’d just had.

But what froze in my place was how clear it sounded. How loud it was. I shouldn’t haven’t been able to hear it that well through glass. 

I ran to the living room and threw all the curtains open, checking and double checking the window locks.

And then, I found it. 

The small window behind the couch, the one that looked right onto the oak tree on the side of the house. It was open just a crack, only a few inches at most. 

A cardinal, bright red in the dawn light, stood on the planter box just outside. I leaned forward to get a better look. The window was fine, but the mesh screen on the other side was ripped, three long slashes from top to bottom. 

My hand flew to my mouth, stifling a sob as I tried to push down the rising panic inside me. Had this been open all night? Had Peter or Kyle opened it? 

Had the creatures gotten in?

The wooden floors creaked behind me, and I jumped, ready to scream and fight if needed. I whirled around, my eyes wide and my hair askew, but Kyle just stood in the doorway, rubbing his eyes with one hand. 

“Hi, Mommy,” he said, his voice still tired.

“Hey, baby. What are you doing up?” I crossed over to him, checked him over to see if he was okay.

“Couldn’t sleep,” he said between a yawn. I kissed the top of his head then crouched down to look him in the face. 

“Are you okay?”

He nodded, his eyes still half shut. He looked like my little boy. The same sleepy face, the same dinosaur pajamas. But did he smell like Kyle? I felt like I was losing my grip on reality. Surely this had to be my son. 

“Hey, what’s this?” I asked, wiping my thumb against a small dark stain on his chin. I brought my stained finger to my nose, took a deep breath.

A smile spread across his face. Did it have too many teeth?

Then, the scent hit me: chocolate. 

“I ate a brownie,” he said with a mischievous smirk. “I hope that’s okay, Mommy. I’ll still be hungry for breakfast.”
