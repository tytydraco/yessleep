I’ve been drinking and smoking a lot since my wife left me. She said she had found someone better than me, and that she wished me well anyway. I could tell she didn’t care. She just wanted to get away from me as fast as possible and get back in bed with fucking “Tyler”.

She hasn’t spoken to me since. Sometimes, I go for long walks late at night and contemplate life. When the train goes past, I imagine myself jumping in front of it and my mangled body all over the train tracks. Then, I imagine her tuning into the news and seeing my intestines scattered all over the floor and my name in bold in the headline. Yeah, that’d show that BITCH!

I throw my fist into the tall street-lamp outside my mother’s house. ***PING!*** ***SNAP!*** I heard a blood-curdling crunch in my hand and blood began to spurt out of my middle knuckle. I groaned in pain over and over again, trying to withstand the beast pressuring me to scream loud enough to wake the whole street. It was fucking excruciating.

I knew a good way to fix this — I’ll head to the bar. A way to take my mind off the physical and mental pain. I begin to stumble there lazily, cradling, squeezing my hand tightly. I finally made it to the bar and pushed the door open with the right side of my body, like when you have to push a door open but your hands are full.

I staggered over to the bar and fell onto the bar stool. The red-haired, wrinkly lady with prominent eye bags came over to me. “What can I get for you…?” she muttered.
“Just a pint of Guiness, please…” I frantically asked, still holding my hand tightly. “Woah, what happened to your hand?” she asked me. 
“I fell on it…” I lied… well, at least tried to. She shrugged. I wanted as little human interaction as possible… just some peace and quiet. 

I watched the lager pour from the beer tap for what felt like hours, but was really a couple seconds. I felt like I could feel the world spin as I daydreamed about when times were good, when everything was happy, wishing I could go back in time to tell myself to enjoy it while I could — it’ll be over soon.

She handed it to me without saying a word. I did the same and dropped the £3.95 into her open hand and took a sip, when I felt a hand slam down next to me which made me jump and spill a little. “Hey, champ, what’s your name?” the strange man said with way too much enthusiasm in an empty bar at 11PM. I sighed but didn’t want to dig myself into a deeper hole so I just said my name, Paul.

He said his name is Tyler. My heart dropped. Eventually, I figured it was just a coincidence… but then it all changed. He pointed at me and said “Wait… are you Paul King? Miranda’s old husband? Oh, shit! What a small world, eh? Yeah, totally sorry about that, you know, the ‘ee-urr ee-urr’, hahaha!”

This wiry little twat was annoying me more and more, him munching his chewing gum like a fucking cow and spitting in my face while I’m trying to have a drink. I was about to go off on him until I realised he was probably on drugs and wasn’t actually really this obnoxious.

I figured I’d just fuck off to the bathroom until he finished his pint and left. I got in a stall and lit up a cigarette, taking drag after drag until I felt a sense of impending doom. I looked up and saw a large, teethy smile and two beady eyes looking down on me. “Fucking hell, what are you doing?!” I yell.
“Sorry. Just a bit lonely. When are you finished?” he said.
“When are you fucking finished?! Just fuck off! Leave me alone!” I shouted at him.

He looked at me with sorrow and stepped off the toilet he was stood on. I heard the door open and then I heard him start talking… again. “Also, Miranda told me what a fucking pussy you are! Fucking pussy! Still stuck working in a fucking school at 37! Can’t even last 2 fucking minutes in bed! Fucking—“… he went on… and on… and on… for about a minute, then I heard a door slam, and one last “PUSSY!” through the door.

I left in about 25 minutes, finished my cigarette and threw it into the toilet and then I made a crack in the doorway and the door and checked if he was gone. YES! He was fucking gone. Some peace and fucking quiet! I strolled back over to the bar and grabbed my drink. I got about halfway and started to feel a bit ill… I felt like I was being lightly punched in the stomach, over and over… and I could hardly keep my eyes open. I lurched outside into the pouring rain, and the last thing I remembered was me blundering across the street, then I blacked out. 

They said they found me sat down against a wall, unresponsive, unable to move and a knife in my stomach at 2:17AM with my jacket missing and all my pockets empty. They say the only reason I’m alive is because he left the knife in my stomach instead of taking it out. I’m currently writing this in the hospital and I have absolutely no memory of what happened after I left that bar. They said I had a minor concussion, probably from when my head hit the ground, and a large amount of Rohypnol in my system. I’ll keep you updated if anything else comes of this.
