I’m aware that this recollection has been a bit…meandering. I want to apologize for that. It wasn’t my intent. This was supposed to be a warning and a confession; nothing more, nothing less.

As a means of narrative restitution, allow me to provide the punchline a little early:

*CLM Pharmaceuticals* used me, and I let them do it. Hell, I think I practically begged them to. As much as I’d like to hate them, as revolting as their methodologies were, as grossly misguided as their endgame was, I have to admit:

They’ve designed a beautiful machine.

At the outset of my first two reports, I carved out space to wax philosophy regarding a pair of cognitive misconceptions: the narcissistic self-deceit of temptation, and the weaponized dreaming of assumption. These preambles may have seemed out of place. In fact, I don’t even blame The Executive for describing those passages to be, in his words: *“grandiose, high-falutin, and profoundly, profoundly dumb”.*

I acknowledge the criticism, but I promise I’ve found the point.

It was the laying of a foundation. Mental groundwork for something much larger. A curated tour through our shared deficits that can only progress forward to a fated destination, the inescapable terminus of our species - something so powerful, so endless, so godamnned cancerous in its will to live, that it has pulled us up from the depths of the primordial slurry just as much as it will eventually push us back under the surface. What goes up, must come down.

Belief. Belief is the hand of God and the key to all of this. Everything else is just cannon fodder.

Objective domains - logic, mathematics, physics, science, rationality, ethics, decency - none of these things govern the world. They have a seat at the table, yes, but when push comes to shove, they all answer to belief. We *should* be objective. Objectivity will keep us alive. It aligns with nature. It’s predictable. Reliable. And yet, objectivity would claim we shouldn’t exist. Our propulsion to the top of the food chain is a one-in-a-billion phenomenon. Add in the birth, maturation, and maintenance of a global society? Those odds become one-in-a-billion-billions.

It’s genuinely unfathomable, but I suppose *that’s* the point.

We fathomed it.

We *believed* we could survive. Our oldest ancestors rebelled against the objective odds and the constraints of nature, the guardrails erected to prevent one particular set of genetics from becoming king, and now, here we stand. It was a lie so potent that reality bent under its weight, changing its shape to accommodate our demands. We grew. We thrived. We ascended to Godhood. We took the earth like we owned it. Like it was made *for* us.

It was an impressive dynasty while it lasted.

After all, what does a conqueror do when there’s nothing left to conquer? They find something new to dominate, some new way to expand, some new foe to defeat, and, inevitably, their growth becomes unsustainable, and they collapse under their own weight like a neutron star. A dying cancer that’s outgrown its vascular supply. Without the fight for survival, they become slaves to their own vanity.  And they only get to that place by continuing to sculpt reality to fit their heroic, larger-than-life, self-obsessed story.

Temptation, assumption, belief.

But enough table setting.

Before The Executive’s narrative intrusion, we left off in May.

At the time, I believed I was a chemist. Believed I was a loving mother to an unclear number of children. Believed I lived with Linda, my wife of ten, or twenty, or thirty years, somewhere within city limits, trekking to the *CLM Pharmaceuticals* compound on the outskirts of that city to work my well paid, dream job.

There was only one fact that defied meager belief; something that was undeniably, objectively, infallibly true.

I ate the oil.

It crawled inside me, and we were unified.

I just didn’t know what happened *after* that.

Or, more accurately,

I believed I didn’t know.

***May 30th, 2025 - Evening***

Linda and I first met in the half-darkness of a rundown dive bar, both mentally in our twenties, though physically much closer to our thirties. One of us was tending the bar, but I can’t recall if it was me or her.

God, she was radiant. Smart as a whip, too. Half-way through her PH.D. dissertation, she informed me. That’s why she was there, I think. Drinking to cool her mind, which had been overheating from the stress. Or maybe she was working there to pay her way through grad school. Or perhaps I was working there to pay *my way* through grad school.

I suppose it doesn’t matter who was on which side of the sticky, wooden countertop: minutes before the bar closed, we kissed under the sharp glow of the Christmas-colored fairy lights strung along the ceiling, and that was that. The exchange was transcendent. We were in love.

Decades later, things were different.

Prior to accepting the position, if anyone was brave enough to ask about the state of our marriage, I’d ice over my features and volunteer an overly generous one-word answer.

*“Strained*.”

And that was *before* Linda began materializing in the empty space created by my company-mandated meditation sessions, face horrifically melded with one of the compound’s security cameras, a single cyclopean lens staring longingly in my direction, her lips contorted into a knowing smile. Shit put me on edge, but it felt irrational to blame her. She wasn’t *actually* infiltrating my subconscious, like some Freddy Krueger to an all-female *Elm Street* reboot. No, I was tormenting myself. Attributed it to unresolved angst regarding her incessant hovering after the affair.

Still.

I couldn’t stand the sight of her, and I was only getting more bitter as time went on.

Her eyes followed my every movement as I prepared for another fruitless day in the lab, badly pretending to appear occupied with a newspaper or a book. When I called her out, mentioned how much I despised the surveillance, she'd deny it, claiming I was paranoid. If I acted even *slightly* off, the barrage of questions that inevitably rained down on my head felt liable to give me a concussion. How are you doing? Are you feeling all right? Headaches? Neck pain? Nausea? Vomiting? Itchiness? Dysentery? Numbness and tingling? Urinary frequency? Blood seeping from anywhere? Blood seeping from *everywhere*? And that wasn’t even the worst of it. One night, I could have sworn I caught her watching me sleep, standing motionless at the end of the bed, looming over the mattress like an omen. That said, I don’t recall confronting her, which leads me to believe it was just another odd manifestation of my ailing subconscious.

Given her relentless supervision, you might assume she’d go nuclear if I actually expressed concern. Maddeningly, this turned out *not* to be the case.

*“Linda -“* I started, sitting at the edge of our bed in the middle of the night, breaking a long streak of selective mutism while in her presence, *“- do you ever hear strange noises coming from the front of the house, early in the morning?”*

Her body sprang upright from under the covers with a shocking amount of force.

*“How do you mean, sweetheart?”* she rasped.

I’d believed she was deep in the throes of sleep, but, judging by the snappiness of her reaction, she must have been wide awake when I posed the question. She startled me, but I tried not to let it show. Being forthright with any emotion, any reaction, any piece of myself - no matter how trivial - was distance from her I was unwilling to concede.

*“I don’t know…they’re like…soft thumps. Creaking. Movement of some kind. I hear them every morning as I’m…getting ready for work.”*

More accurately, I heard them as my daily meditation was coming to a close, but I never disclosed those obligatory sessions to Linda, and she always slept through them. Just another few inches of precious distance from my wife that I refused to forfeit willingly.

I braced myself for the onslaught of follow-up questions. Harsh tension swelled in my shoulders. After a slight pause, she replied.

*“Eh, I wouldn’t worry about it.”*

Linda flopped down like a deactivated animatronic and turned away from me.

*“Just go back to sleep. You have work in a few hours, right?”*

I don’t know how long I remained at the edge of the bed, gaze fixed on an oddly shaped crack in the wall. The plaster was perfectly smooth, save for the crack. A craggy oval no bigger than a thumbprint. She was right, of course. I needed to lie down and sleep, but I couldn’t look away. My eyes traced the defect, looping through its contours, over and over and over again, running a seemingly endless race. Where did it come from? Why was it there? Something about it spoke to me, even if I couldn't understand what it was saying.

It was, in the end, my liberator, my canary in the coal mine,

My dear Ouroboros.

***May 31st - Morning***

The vibrating of my phone’s alarm ripped me from sleep at 4:30 AM. I reached under my pillow, silenced it, and lumbered out of bed. A wide, cavernous yawn spilled from lips. The cool touch of the floor triggered a wave of goosebumps across my uncovered calves. I clasped my hands, deposited them in the hole created by my crossed legs, took a breath, and emptied my mind.

For whatever reason, I found myself dreaming of our first kiss. The smell of stale beer, which I both detested because it caused me to gag and adored because it reminded me of better days, coated the inside of my nostrils. The twinkle of the fairy lights knocked against my closed eyelids. Her lips felt warm and perfect.

Before long, however, tiny flecks of pain began to accumulate in my chest. Quickly, sparks became flames.

I couldn’t breathe.

Instinctively, I tried to pull my mouth away, but I felt myself pulling Linda’s head with me. That’s when I realized our lips were tightly sealed together. Our melded flesh was inseparable. A scream bubbled up my throat, but, having nowhere else to go, promptly rattled down Linda’s throat. The exact same scream seemed to echo back into me, I’d scream once more, and the cycle would continue.

Suddenly, I thought of my eyes repeatedly tracing the crack in the wall.

I experienced a massive, nigh-cataclysmic head rush, powerful enough to send the back of my skull crashing into the bedroom floor, releasing me from that hellscape. Multiple *thumps* made their way to my ears: one was most certainly the collision, but the remaining - who could say? As I recovered, gripping my temple and quietly groaning, the conversation I had with my wife the night prior started trickling into my mind’s eye.

For the first and only time, I called out of work. Tried to, at least. When I phoned HR to report my *“illness”*, all I got was an answering machine.

A few hours later, I watched Linda prepare breakfast from the kitchen table, boiling over with rage, those five words she’d said seeming to create a real, physical pressure inside my head.

*I wouldn’t worry about it.*

*I wouldn’t worry about it.*

*I wouldn’t worry about it.*

*But why the fuck wouldn't I worry about it?*

*“You know, I heard those thumps again this morning!”* I bellowed. I meant for the statement to sound pointed, but I didn’t mean to shout it. Linda jumped at the sound, the grease-tipped spatula flying from her hand.

She caught her breath, bent over with one hand to her chest while the other braced the countertop. Then, she spoke.

*“Honey, honestly, I wouldn’t -”*

I cut her off. For her own benefit, mind you. I think if Linda completed *that* sentence, I truly would have gone ballistic.

*“You know what I think? I think we should install some security cameras. Actually, no, not* ***should***\*, we’re\* ***going*** *to install some security cameras. Someone may be trespassing in our home, goddamnit, it's not safe. I’m going to run to the hardware store. Today.”*

She placed the sizzling pan of bacon aside the stovetop, sighed, and spun towards me. Before she could say anything, we were both distracted by the sound of a frenzied stampede upstairs. Multiple pairs of child-sized feet thudded across the ceiling. We followed the sound as it moved towards the top of the stairs, unaccompanied by giggling or singing or anything appropriately child-like. Abruptly and without ceremony, the stampede concluded. I stared at the bottom few steps from my position at the table, waiting, slightly dumbfounded. Nothing and no one came rushing down the stairs.

Without warning, Linda blurted out:

*“I’ll do it!”*

I turned to face her. She was sweating. Her grin was wobbly and awkward.

*“What?”* I muttered, feeling newly disoriented.

*“I’ll…I’ll do it. I’ll go to the hardware store. You’re sick, right? That’s why you called out of work? You should rest.”*

For some reason, that was enough. I found myself both sufficiently placated and extraordinarily wiped out. I trudged upstairs without eating, made my way down the hallway, intermittently leaning against the walls for support. The bedroom was an icebox. I slipped under the covers and tried to sleep. I’m not sure whether I was successful. If I was, I dreamt of tracing my eyes along the oval-shaped crack in the wall.

By the next morning, someone had installed cameras around our front door.

And I suppose that was also enough.

Because I arrived at *CLM Pharmaceuticals* with a smile on my face.

\- - - - -

***June 15th - Evening***

*“Linda, show me the recordings,”* I growled.

She paced frantically across the kitchen tile, forming small, crooked circles with her feet, one trembling hand clutching her sternum like she was on the verge of an asthma attack, the other holding a crop of frizzy blonde and gray hairs taut above her head. The woman appeared to be unraveling. I felt a dull shimmer of sympathy somewhere inside me, but it was buried under thick layers of confusion and anger and profound frustration.

I would not be dissuaded.

*“Sweetheart, I* ***promise*** *you, I’ve reviewed them all, and there’s nothing to be seen…”* she begged, rejecting my attempts to make eye contact.

*“I. Want. To see it. For myself.”* The words were blunt and drawn out, as if poor comprehension was truly the issue at hand.

Abruptly, she paused her manic spinning. Her eyes darted back and forth across the floor, her hand now clutching her forehead instead of her chest. It was the same expression she adopted when she was forced to do long division in her head. The internal calculations continued for more than a minute. I let her computing go on unabated, assuming she was on the precipice of finally agreeing to let me see the footage around the time of the unexplained *thumping*. Then, as abruptly as they had ceased, the crooked circles started once more.

*“Okay, it should be fine,”* she remarked, pacing, *“but let me just make one quick call beforehand…*”

I’m not proud of it, but I exploded at my wife.

*“Who?* ***Who???*** *Who could you possibly need to call,* ***and why?****”* I screamed.

She couldn’t conjure a response to the question. It barely even seemed to register. My anger grew, and seethed, and writhed, and just when I thought I truly was about to erupt, just when it felt like I was dissolving to ash under the emotional heat, my anger died out. Suffocated in an instant, like a lit match plunged into the vacuum of space. What remained in its absence was a hungry, gnawing disappointment.

*This isn’t the woman I married. Not anymore* \- I thought.

I steadied my breathing, smiled weakly, stepped towards Linda, and placed a gentle hand on her shoulder. She stopped moving and turned to me.

*“Listen - if you don’t show me, I’m gone. I’ll leave, and I won’t come back.”*

There was another prolonged instance of calculation - eyes drifting cryptically around their sockets - but eventually, she nodded.

Linda returned to the kitchen twenty minutes later, holding her open laptop tight to her chest. I reached out to take it from her, but her free hand grasped mine before I could. Finally, she was looking at me dead-on. We stood frozen for a few seconds, eyes and hands intertwined, and then she repeated herself.

*“I promise, Helen, there’s* ***nothing*** *on the recordings. It’s important for you to know that beforehand. It’s critical that you believe me,”* she whispered.

I didn’t understand, but I would not let that fact stop me, either.

*“Okay. I believe you, love. I just need to see for myself.”*

She relinquished the laptop with palpable reticence, and nervously watched as I sat down at the table to review the recordings.

To my surprise, she didn’t appear to be lying.

Every morning was the same. The camera posted above our doorbell recorded dawn’s arrival to our sleepy city street, isolated from the bustle of downtown. No intruders coming or going. No people at all, actually. No explanation for the *thumps* whatsoever. Something wasn’t right, though. I couldn’t put my finger on it, but I felt a tickle in the back of my skull that wouldn’t go away. So, when I was finished fast-forwarding through all fourteen recordings, I started again.

I watched them a third time. My unease festered. What was wrong? What wasn’t I seeing?

There was a fourth viewing, followed by a fifth, followed by a sixth. 

That tickling sensation had progressed from mild discomfort to a full-on feeling of impending doom. I was on the cusp of something, teetering. To keep looking, to keep inspecting, to keep my eyes rolling across the proverbial crack in the wall - change was guarenteed.

I had a choice to make: close the laptop and try to move on, or peel away the veil.

In the end, I continued.

What goes up, must come crashing down.

My eyes went wide. A trembling finger paused the recording.

I rewound it and played the clip once more.

It happened again. I hadn’t imagined it.

The camera was pointed toward the east. In the footage, the sun rose over the horizon, but there was a point in the recording where its position appeared to *jump*. It was subtle, but undeniable. The ball of fire skipped up a few inches in the sky, like some time was missing. I checked the next day: same phenomenon at the same moment, about five minutes after my “meditation” was due to end every morning.

Same with the following day, and the day after that, and then, finally, as I looked deeper, the facade began to unravel.

On the next day’s footage, the city block disappeared. It was there when I reviewed it before, but now, it was gone. In its place, I saw a poorly maintained asphalt street, and beyond that, an empty field.

I moved on to the day after that. The street was gone and there was a fence in the distance, but where chain-link *should* have been, there were panels of reflective glass.

At that point, I couldn't stop myself.

I'd seen too much.

And when I had seen enough, when the sun’s trajectory through the sky became smooth and unhampered, when the veil was fully pulled back, I saw *them* leaving my home.

Naked. Gray, translucent skin. Men and women. Clumsy, arthritic-looking movement. They exited, pulled the front door closed behind them, creaked across the driveway, onto the street, and eventually, out of frame, always to the left.

I slammed the laptop shut and shot up from the table. Unexpectedly, I collided with Linda. She had been silently hovering over my shoulders for God knows how long. I pushed her away with all the force I could muster. She crashed into the wall.

From across the kitchen, I stared at her, and her face began to twist and contort.

*“No, no, no…”* I whimpered.

Her gray hairs multiplied. Her left eye swam up her forehead until it was significantly above her right. Her skin rippled quietly like the surface of a lake, settling after someone had thrown a rock into it.

*“Who…who are you?”*

She smiled, revealing a mouth saturated with pegged teeth.

*“I’m Linda. I take care of Helen. I make sure Helen goes to work. I’m married to Helen. Helen and I have children. Helen and I are supremely happy. I make sure Helen doesn’t leave. I love Helen.”*

I couldn’t take anymore. I sprinted past her and down the hall, grabbing my car keys, spilling out the front door. Although the scenery outside my home now matched the recordings, I was relieved to find my car in the driveway. I threw myself onto the driver’s seat and jammed the keys into the ignition. For a moment, I became paralyzed, overwhelmed, shaking violently, wheezing and sobbing.

I pulled myself together.

Grief could wait.

I needed to drive.

My bare heel collapsed onto the gas pedal. At the same time, I glimpsed a flicker of approaching movement in the periphery.

I had no time to brake. That said, I don’t know that I would have even if I had the time to consider the ramifications.

The ghoulish Xerox of my wife leapt onto the car. She hammered a fist into the windshield, then into the hood, and then she toppled over the front, disappearing under the wheels.

There wasn’t a sickening crunch.

No soggy squish of eviscerated tissue.

The maiming was eerily silent.

I felt the vehicle rise and fall without protest,

like driving over unplowed snow.

Eventually, I did brake, tires screeching against the asphalt. It was reflexive. On cursory examination, I had just run over my wife, although the truth of the matter was much more perverse. I placed the car in park. Wearily, I slid out to see what remained of her.

I shouldn't have done that.

Her body had been trisected, wide incisions made at her knees and her rib cage. Splotches of grayish foam littered the area.

The inside of her chest was completely hollow and lined with gray, rippling flesh. Same with her abdomen.

The top third of her was, somehow, still talking.

*“I’m Linda. I take care of Helen. I make sure Helen goes to work…”*

She fixed her eyes on the overcast sky. I couldn’t tell if she was speaking to me or for her own benefit, reciting her directives in a sort of dying prayer.

My cellphone vibrated in my pocket.

I couldn’t take myself away from the carnage, but I managed to answer.

Static hummed on the other end.

Eventually, they spoke.

*“You must know I didn't want this for you. It's a real shame. Come to the compound. We have some matters to discuss.”*

I turned my head, looked down the road, and saw it.

A dome-shaped building that narrowed at the center and extended high into the atmosphere, only a ten-minute walk from where I was standing.

The line clicked dead. I slipped the phone back into my pocket and turned back to Linda.

She wasn’t speaking, and her head wasn’t to the sky.

My wife was motionless, eyes glazed over but pointed straight at me.

Her expression didn’t strike me as truly happy or truly sad. It was conflicted, but resolute. She lived and died for me, as she understood it.

Bittersweet is probably close.

When I couldn’t stand to look any longer, I turned away and began walking towards the compound.

I thought about driving there, but I found myself unable to get behind the wheel again.

I couldn’t stomach the bright red flashing of the brake lights or the bright green icons on the car’s dashboard.

They reminded me of the Christmas-colored fairy lights.

I imagine the venom of that nostalgia would have killed me outright,

and I still had things to do.
