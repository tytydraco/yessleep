*Hi, Connor. Do you remember what day it is today?*

That’s the first message I get as soon as I walk out of the office. The number isn’t in my contacts, but it knows my name somehow.

I ask who it is.

*It’s Jane. Remember me?*

The name alone sends a chill down my spine. But it can’t be *that* Jane. I text back, asking which one.

As I’m entering the cab, heading home, my phone buzzes again.

*It’s the one you loved so dearly, dummy. The one you haven’t spoken to in a long, long time.*

Can it be a prank? How would anyone even know about Jane? That was ages ago.

I decide not to respond, hoping the sender will lose interest. But the phone buzzes again.

*That’s very rude of you, making me wait. Remember when you said you were going to leave your wife?*

My heart skips a beat. I type back furiously, demanding to know who this really is and what they want.

The real Jane died almost twenty years ago.

*All I want is for you to tell me what day it is today. That’s it. If you don’t, I’ll ring the doorbell in front of me and have a nice little chat with your wife.*

“Is this a joke?” I reply.

*Try me, Connor. You have five minutes.*

Then an image pops up on the chat. I open it to see a photo of my front yard. Near the bottom of the picture, a thin, gloved hand holds what looks like a gun.

*I’m close enough to hear her if she gets a call. If she panics or I hear a siren, she’s dead.*

I glance out the cab window. There are still maybe twenty minutes until I get home. Damn it.

I respond, explaining I’ll cooperate and there’s no need to escalate things.

But I don't understand what the question means. If it’s Jane’s stolen identity, maybe it’s about the day we met?

Jane and I met at the Hilton during a work event. Back then, I still had a long dark hair that touched my neck. A young, ambitious sales manager. She was an even younger accountant. Married for three years at the time, I found something intoxicating in her shy laugh.

The date escapes me, but that’s the answer I give: the day we met.

Seconds later, another message arrives.

*Boo-hoo, wrong answer. I’ll give you one more shot, Connor. It’s now or never.*

The cab turns onto my street. Just a few more blocks.

An obvious answer hits me. Of course—it’s the day she died.

There’s a lot I’ve chosen to forget about those last months with Jane. The fights, the threats, the bitter breakup when I chose my wife over her. The look she gave me when I told her not to keep the child.

In the end, I gave her cash for the procedure and left her life completely. A couple of months later, someone told me she’d died on the operating table during what I presumed was the abortion.

I type in my answer. The phone buzzes again.

*Very good, Connor. That’s almost right. But there’s one piece left.*

The cab pulls up, but I leap out before it even stops, running toward the house. The driver yells after me, demanding I pay.

*On that same day, something else happened.*

I burst through the door, frantic. My wife isn’t in the living room. I shout for her.

She calls back from the kitchen and I find her there, startled by my panic.

I pull her into a hug. Relief floods through me. She’s safe and just stares at me, confused, questioning what’s going on.

Before I can answer, my phone buzzes. Another text.

*Today is also your son’s birthday. The one she died to give birth.*

The doorbell rings.

“Who is it?” my wife asks, moving toward the door.

“I’ll get it,” I say, stepping in front of her.

My cold hands grasp the doorknob, and I pull it open.

Standing there is a young man—thin, tall, with dark long hair brushing the neck. He looks eerily like I did at his age.

In his face, a cold grin. In his hands, a gun rises to meet my head.
