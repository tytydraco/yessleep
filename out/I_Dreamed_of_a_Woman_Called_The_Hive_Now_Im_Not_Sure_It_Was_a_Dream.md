Hey all. I don't really know where else to share this. And I'm to worried to tell anyone in person. So I suppose I'll leave this here. I've been having these visions, or I guess nightmares. And it's consumed my life for the last week. So I decided to write down in my journal after every night about the dream. If anyone else has had a similar dream, which I really hope not, but if you have, it would be nice to know that I'm not alone. If I continue to have the same dreams next week, I'll keep writing what I remember down.



**April 17:**



They say some dreams are messages. Warnings. Or echoes from some deeper part of yourself that doesn’t speak in words. I’ve always had vivid nightmares since I was a little girl, monsters followed me through sleep like shadows. I’m now 19, and this one was different. *Felt* different. It felt like something old had reached through the cracks in reality and laid its hands on me.

In the dream, I was leading a small group down a decaying hallway. The Hallway was cold. Too cold. Like stepping out of a shower into winter air. And it stunk of mold, mildew, and wet dirt. Six people followed behind me, I didn't know who any of them were. But we were all connected somehow. We weren’t talking. We didn’t *have* to. There was this awful understanding between all of us that we were going somewhere we didn’t want to go, but we *had* to go. Flanking and walking alongside our group, were five tall figures. At first glance, they looked like people. Men, maybe, but they were too tall and arms too long. Their skin colour was an off white. Almost sickly grey. They walked with a slow grace, heads swaying gently as if to music none of us could hear. Two mushroom stems grew from the stump of their neck, where a head should be. At the top of the two stems held their own caps, luminescent, blue, and smooth as polished glass. Their clothing was all the same, blue t-shirts, brown jeans, and black shoes, but they were oddly clean. Their movements were strange, almost too fluid, but stumbling over their feet every so often. Beautiful in that dream-logic way where terror hides under wonder. They never looked at us. Never acknowledged we existed. They just walked beside us. Guiding. Guarding. Or maybe herding. And ahead of us, leading the march, was *her*. I’ve never seen anything like her before, but for some reason, I already knew who it was.

We called her the Hive.

I didn’t say it. No one did. But we all just… *knew*. That was her name. Or maybe just what she was. A name that was more of a concept than a label. The Hive was tall, but not abnormally so, like the Mushroom Men. She was probably about six feet tall. She wore clothing of a regular person, white t-shirt, jeans, and basic tennis shoes. Her skin was pale, almost waxy, like a body pulled from water. She had shoulder length brown hair. But the worst part was her face. Her face was haunting, elegant, but wrong. A mouth with no lips, just an open, jagged circle of gums and teeth that weren’t in any human pattern. Similar to that of a Lamprey. The mouth took up almost all of her face. No eyes, nose, ears, or any other defining facial features. Just skin and mouth. The parts of her face that were just skin had small patches of three or four teeth, just scattered about. Aside from her face, all showing skin had bite marks already in the skin, like her own teeth had turned on her. They were all up her arms and on her neck. And still, she was mesmerizing, in that train wreck way where you just can't look away from it.

She walked just ahead of me, silent like the rest of us. The Hallway groaned under our feet, tiles cracked and eaten by age. Faint blue and green lights pulsed from the Mushroom Men, throwing sickly reflections across the ruined walls. Every door we passed was open, but pitch-black. Just voids. Empty, waiting mouths. And then, at the end, was *the pit*; A yawning darkness, cut into the tile like a wound. It didn’t move, but it *felt* like it was breathing. I don’t know how, but I knew something waited inside of it. And I knew The Hive wanted to show us. Or put us in. I wasn’t sure which would’ve been worse.

We were about twenty feet away when she stopped. She turned. Slowly. Her head swiveled first, and then her body followed like it wasn’t used to being inside itself. And she looked *right at me*. Not past me, not through me. *At me.* She reached out, long fingers curling around my arm. Her skin felt clammy, sending a chill throughout my body. Then, she opened that mouth and lunged at my forearm. I raised my fist and went to punch her in the head, then I woke up swinging. My boyfriend didn’t appreciate the sudden hit to the back, waking him up. I quickly apologized and explained to him what happened. As I was doing so, tears formed in my eyes when explaining to him about The Hive. I didn’t even notice that I was crying until he had pointed it out.

But here's the part that scares me most. Even now, awake, sometimes I catch a glimpse of something out of the corner of my eye, something pale and tall, just standing there. Watching. Waiting. But as I turn to see it, the figure isn't there anymore. The Hive isn’t done with me yet.

If I have any more dreams about her in that place, I'll keep writing. But for now, this is all I can remember.



**April 18:**



I fell asleep quicker than usual last night. I didn’t want to, I tried to stay up. But my body gave out around 2:00 a.m. And just like that, I was back. The Hallway was waiting again, but it wasn’t the same. This time, the walls pulsed like veins. Not visibly moving, but you could *feel* something alive behind them, like breathing through fabric. The cold was still there, but sharper now, like frostbitten metal pressed to your skin. I was leading the same group, six of us, all silent, but the air between us felt heavier. One of them was crying softly. I didn’t turn to see who. I didn’t want to. The Mushroom Men were there again too. But they were… deteriorating. Their movements had a jerky rhythm, like marionettes handled by uncertain hands. Their luminous caps flickered like dying bulbs, and some of their stems were peeling. Slits in their necks where the stems grew had begun to darken, thick with something like mold. They still didn’t look at us. Still didn’t acknowledge us. But I couldn’t shake the feeling they *knew* we were watching them now.

And The Hive… she was walking backward this time. Still leading us. Still silent. But her body faced us, her head tilted slightly, mouth hanging open like she was about to speak but never did. Her footfalls were perfect, never tripping, never stumbling, as if the Hallway bent itself to her will. I wanted to stop. I didn’t want to go to the pit again. But I kept walking. We all did. We had to. This time, when we reached the end, the pit was smaller. Like it had shrunk, or maybe the Hallway had grown. But it still breathed. Still pulsed. Still pulled. And when The Hive turned to face it, I noticed something new.

There was a figure inside, not just darkness. I couldn’t see its face. Just a pale body, curled in the fetal position, shaking ever so slightly. The Hive knelt beside the pit and reached out a hand toward it. She couldn’t touch it. She just knelt there with her arm stretched out. Reverent. Like she was praying. Then she turned her head toward me. Not the full body-turn like before. Just her head, twitching too fast, too sudden to be natural. Her mouth widened into that ring of endless teeth. And then she whispered something. A sound, more than words. It was like hearing your name underwater. Distant. Warped. But it *was* my name. That’s when I woke up.

My arm was cold. Not the, I left my fan on, kind of cold. It felt like something had *touched* me. A damp, clammy pressure around my wrist, like fingers had just let go. I checked for marks. Nothing. But I know what I felt. I know what I saw. And worst of all? I’m starting to think that pale figure in the pit… might’ve been *me*. 



**April 19:**



Tonight’s dream took me back to the Hallway again. But it was different. I fell asleep around 9:00 p.m., almost as soon as I got home from work. I can’t stop thinking about these dreams, *her*, more specifically. I’m afraid, of course, but a part of me *needs* to know who was in the pit. This time, I was alone. No group. No Mushroom Men. And most unsettling of all, The Hive wasn’t there. The Hallway was darker without the glow of the mushrooms, but there was just enough dim, sourceless light to make out where I was walking. The cold was sharper than usual, like standing naked in the wind of Antarctica. I started moving forward, and for the first time, I really looked at the doors lining the hall. Each one was a pitch-black void in the shape of a door frame. I stepped closer to one, trying to see inside, but the darkness was absolute. Even entering it wouldn’t help, I *knew* that. I tried a few more, peering into three different empty frames, but they were all the same. Something about them felt wrong, like the dark wasn’t just empty, it was aware. Watching me.

Eventually, I gave up and continued walking. The Hallway stretched on endlessly. After what felt like hours, I came upon the pit again. I hesitated, but the need to know overwhelmed the fear. I *had* to see who, or what, was inside. I stepped closer. The void gaped below, its pull stronger than ever. But when I looked, there was nothing. Just that same, yawning blackness. I blinked, and suddenly, I wasn’t near the pit anymore. I was standing in the middle of the Hallway, staring down its length. And there she was. The Hive. Silent. Motionless. Staring at me from a distance.

Then I woke up. I don’t remember how the dream ended, just that one moment. Her gaze. The feeling of being watched hasn’t gone away. If anything, it’s gotten stronger. I keep catching glimpses of her in the corners of my vision more and more. At work. At home. In reflections. She’s all I can think about. My thoughts are unraveling. I can’t focus. I’m speaking less. Smiling less. And that awful sensation clings to me no matter what I do. It’s like she’s just behind me, breathing down my neck. 



**April 20**



There was no dream tonight. I don’t know which is worse, to be honest. It was nice getting rest without the dreams. But it wasn't just that I didn't have a dream about that place. I didn't dream at all. The feeling has gone down slightly, which has helped me focus at work more. Hopefully they’re gone forever. I don’t know if I can handle more of those dreams anymore.



**April 21**



There was no dream tonight either. The feeling is about the same as yesterday. It’s still there but it’s not as bad. But I will say, I miss having any sort of dreams at night. When I close my eyes it's just darkness. Like I'm staring into the pit again. 



**April 22**



It’s back. I shouldn’t have assumed so quickly that the Hallway, or The Hive, was done with me. After I fell asleep, I was back in the Hallway. It was the same as it was three days ago: empty, except for me. But something felt different. The pulse of the walls was stronger, more aggressive. Like the Hallway had *changed* somehow. Like it was aware. I started walking again, passing the same endless, empty door frames. The Hallway felt more decayed than before. Like each visit was slowly breaking it down, like I was rotting it from the inside just by being there. Eventually, I reached the place where the pit should have been. But it was gone. And in its place was a large mirror. I walked up to it, confused. It wasn’t like a normal mirror, there was no reflection of me. Instead, I saw someone in the distance, curled up in the fetal position. The pale person from the pit. Rocking back and forth. Trembling. It wasn’t a mirror. It was a *window*. A window into a different world. Or maybe... into the pit itself. I watched the figure for what felt like a few minutes. Then it stopped shaking. Slowly, it lifted its head, and looked right at me. And… It looked like me. My first assumption had been right. The thing in the pit was *me*. Or something wearing my face. But wrong. The skin was too pale, corpse-like. The eyes were blank, milky white. And tears streamed silently down its face.

Then, without warning, without a sound, The Hive appeared behind it. She was just *there*. The way things appear in dreams, without reason. She didn’t look at me. She only stood over the figure, staring down. Then she placed her hand gently on its shoulder. And at the same moment, completely involuntarily, I placed my hands on the mirror’s surface.

Then I woke up. I was already sitting upright when my eyes opened. My hands felt moist, like when it's humid outside during the early spring. My boyfriend was still asleep beside me. I haven’t told him about the dreams, aside from that first night, when I hit him by accident. But I *know* he’s noticed how I’ve changed. He just hasn’t said anything. I’m paranoid now. Jumpy. Short-tempered. Today I had a full-on panic attack at work—almost got myself fired. For context, I work at a small family-owned Italian restaurant. During my shift as a server, I was bringing a salad to one of the tables. Then I saw her. She was standing in the corner of the dining room, next to a table. White t-shirt. Jeans. Shoulder-length brown hair. Her back was to me, so I couldn’t see her face. But I *knew* it was her. It looked *just like her*. I froze. Right there in the middle of the room. The salad slipped from my hands and crashed to the floor. I ran to the back of the restaurant, and out the back door. I collapsed outside, crying, hyperventilating. It broke me. 

When I asked my coworker the next day if he saw her, he said she was just a normal customer. Nothing strange. A coincidence, he called it. But I know better. She’s not just in my dreams anymore. She’s bleeding into reality. That constant feeling of being watched is back, stronger than ever. I see her in the corner of my eye more and more now. I don’t want to go back to sleep tonight.



**April 23**



The dream tonight was the same as the first. At least, it started that way. I was with the group again, walking through the Hallway. The Mushrooms cast that faint, sickly light along the path ahead, and I felt myself falling back into the same rhythm. I didn’t say anything. None of us did. Just like before. But something had changed. I noticed it slowly, first a sniffle, then a stifled sob. The people walking with me were crying. Softly. Quietly. All of them. I didn’t turn to look. I couldn’t. I just kept walking forward, eyes locked ahead, pretending not to notice. But I heard them. I heard every shaky breath and quiet whimper. As we passed the blackened doorways, I heard faint whispers. Not voices I could understand, just fragments of words, half-syllables, breaths. They slithered out from the inky voids, like the Hallway itself was speaking. I didn’t dare stop to listen. I just kept moving.

Then, just like the first night, we reached the pit. The crowd gathered around it, and I saw her again. The Hive. Pale, blood-dripping mouth, staring with no eyes. She reached out for me, and I stepped forward, just like last time. Everything about it was identical. Except this time, when she lunged to bite me, I didn’t wake up. I swung again, just like before. But this time my fist connected. There was a sickening crack as I hit her in the head. Her body jerked backward, landing in a heap a few feet away. I didn’t wait. I ran. Out of instinct. I darted into the nearest doorway to my right.

The moment I stepped through, I was falling. No ground. No walls. Just free-fall into darkness. But not silence. The crying I’d heard earlier grew louder, distorted, twisted. Then it shifted, turning into laughter. Not joyous laughter. Cruel, mocking, ugly cackling that echoed in all directions. Images of her, the Hive, flashed all around me. Glimpses of her face. Dozens of them. Hundreds. All with the same repulsive mouth of jagged teeth. Pulsating. And all of them were saying my name. Chanting it. Over and over.

Then, My boyfriend’s voice cut through. Saying my name. He was shaking me awake. I opened my eyes and sat up, gasping for breath. He told me I was trembling in my sleep. Not seizing, just... shaking. Enough to wake him up. When I stood to get some water, I noticed it. On my left forearm. A bite mark. It was a perfect circle. Rings of tiny, precise teeth. Like a lamprey. Or the Hive’s mouth. I haven’t shown it to him. I told him I had a weird dream again and brushed it off. But it’s still there. Red. Raised. Real.

This isn’t just dreams anymore. Something’s bleeding through.
