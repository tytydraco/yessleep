Hey, Reddit, it’s Gus again. For those unfamiliar with me, I made several posts detailing me and my friend, Drake’s fucked up experience participating in what was supposed to be a scavenger hunt in an [abandoned hospital. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/tsrm5a/were_trapped_in_an_abandoned_hospital_finale/)The long and short aftermath of that ordeal was that we saved up and moved out of our apartment. We thought our current one would be better since it had two bedrooms and two baths. Little did we know, it would prove to be much worse.


Listing all of our complaints about this place would bog this post down. Just know the most significant ones have to do with, broken AC, broken heater, the fridge dying, roaches like you wouldn’t believe,  bursting pipes, and not to mention, upstairs neighbors. Personally, I think having kids should preclude someone from living on an upper floor. It also doesn’t help that the walls are thinner than paper. The things I’ve heard our middle-aged neighbors do on the other side of my bedroom wall will haunt me almost as much as what Erickson put us through.


Speaking of whom, I wonder whatever happened to him? Oh well, the less said about that nutfuck, the better. Anyway, I hate this double standard of management always expecting rent on time. Yet we have to complain about fifty times before they finally send someone out. Even then, they always cut corners in the worst way possible. 


If I had to describe the repairs they’ve made in a phrase it would be “bandaids on bullet wounds”. This latest pain in the ass was hands down the worst of all.  It all began last weekend. Our first days off in two months turned into some steaming horse shit. Me and Drake were driving home on Friday night. 


While we have separate vehicles, carpooling saves money since our shifts are roughly the same length. In this case,  we were in Drake’s truck.


“So what are you planning on doing when we get home?”

“Sleeping.”

“Besides that.”

“I don’t know, maybe a movie. Hey, did they ever fix the fridge?”

“I’m not sure. I’d have to check my messages and my phone’s charging. Anyway, I’m starving. Why don’t we grab a bite?”


Glancing out the window showed that every restaurant and grocery store was closed.


“Where?” Drake asked.

“Gas station food it is, I guess.”


We bought some taquitos and coke, then headed to our apartment. Drake swiped his gate key several times and it remained closed. 


“Gus, it’s broken again.”

“I got it. Hang on.”


Rummaging through the glove compartment, I pulled out a screwdriver. Fidgeting with the scanner caused it to beep and then the gates opened.  


“I’m going to check the mail. See you home,” I said.


Drake gave me a nod and pulled into the neighborhood. While I was getting it, I happened to notice one of our neighbors had their blinds open to their kitchen. They were standing and staring off into space. Figuring they were drunk or high, I walked back to the apartment. Drake was in the living room, rolling a joint.


“Hey, man, are you going to want some of this?”

“Maybe in a bit, did they ever fix the fridge?”

“Nope, still leaking and the water's fucking up now too.”


I went into the kitchen to see what he meant. The kitchen faucet made a kind of gurgling noise before water came from it.


“Yeah, we better stick with bottled water for a while,” I told Drake.


He nodded and took a drag of the joint. I decided to partake after all and we passed it back and forth. I made a bowl of caramel cheddar seasoned popcorn. Then we spent the next several hours watching My Name Is Earl.


“How the hell does Darnell put up with Joy?” I asked. 

“Because he's a real one,” Drake replied. “Hey, speaking of relationships, how have things been going with you and Kelly?”

“Oh, well, a couple weeks back we got to talking and thought it would be best if-”

“She dumped you, right?”

“Yeah,” I replied after a pause, “what about you and Amy?”

“Same boat, she told me I was holding her back or some shit like that. All that happened on the second.”


I turned to him in shock.


“She broke up with you on your birthday? That’s fucked up.”


Drake shrugged.


“Not like that's the worst thing that's ever happened to me.”


I thought back to our time in that abandoned hospital and silently agreed with him.


“Well, at least it's only us we have to worry about now,” I said.

“Yup.”


By 1:00, we figured we should get to bed, then got up and went to our rooms. My rest was relatively peaceful, only being interrupted by the occasional noisy neighbor or nightmare. It was around 8:00 when we were woken up by what we thought were people arguing outside.


“The hell are they on about now?” Drake asked when we were out in the hall.

“It’s probably Van and Roscoe again,” I replied as I was rubbing my eyes.


Those two were like fire and gasoline living next to each other and their conflicts got heated enough for the police to be called on numerous occasions. The former was a blue no matter who supporter while the latter was an avid red waver. Although we didn't care much for either of them, Van was the most tolerable. I’ve had some decent chats with him so long as it didn't involve politics. Meanwhile, whenever I talked with Roscoe which was usually prompted by him, things would always go awry.


He’d somehow find a way to bring up how “his people” were going to take back the White House. Then this would be followed by something along the lines of “I don't have anything against X group of people…”. It's a good thing I always have conversation-ending responses ready.


“This is why I hate election years,” Drake said. “Guess we’ll have to leave out the back again.”


The reason for this is they tended to go on for a while and they’d try to rope us into their debates.


“Right, so what are you doing today?”

“Probably hitting the gym. Do you want to come with me?”

“Not this time, I’ll be shopping.”

“Cool, see you in a bit.”


We went out, each of us going in our respective vehicles. While driving to the front gate, I noticed things seemed more chaotic than we'd become accustomed to. Several people seemed to be in a confrontation and indeed Roscoe and Van were among them. I didn't get a good view of it since I was driving. What I did glimpse was one person appearing to bite another on the shoulder and then they were elbowed to the ground.


Rolling my eyes, I waited for the gate to open,  then pulled out of the neighborhood. While Walmart wasn’t the best place to shop, it was cheap, at least comparably. I arrived and parked about twelve minutes later.  It beinginfectionnd, I knew it would be busier than usual. Luckily I’ve been updated on my vaccines so I wasn’t too worried about getting close to anyone. 


That said, anyone coughing still received a wide berth. What I didn’t expect when I went in was the emptiness of the store. This directly contradicted the number of cars I saw outside. Not to mention, while walking through the store I only saw a handful of employees.


“Hours must be getting cut something fierce,” I thought.


Not thinking much more about it, I proceeded and filled my buggy. It was when I was in the cereal aisle deciding if I wanted to get some Cocoa Pebbles or Cinnamon Toast Crunch, well the off-brand versions I should say. Gotta make that EBT money stretch.  As I was saying, I was busy trying to choose when out of my peripheral I noticed a man coming from the other side of the aisle. Instantly, I noticed their lack of shoes and that they were shuffling their feet and taking a step forward instead of walking normally.


They gave me a blank glassy stare that caused me a wave of unease. Two possibilities occurred to me then. Either this was someone with mental issues or they were fucked up on drugs. Given our town, the second one was more likely. Nonetheless, I figured it would be a dick move not to see if they wanted help.

“Hey. are you alright?” I asked.


He kept staring at me, his expression unchanged.  We shared a few moments of awkward silence before I realized this was a lost cause and headed elsewhere in the store. He also turned to leave and as he did, maybe it was a trick of the light, but I could have sworn I saw a wound in the back of his head.


Continuing my trip, I was heading to the meat and seafood section when a scream nearly made me abandon my skin. It came from one of the frozen food aisles. I stopped my kart and peeked over. I wanted to see what was happening, then try to find a security guard. Unfortunately, in light of what I witnessed, I didn’t think an overweight middle-aged guy would have made much of a difference.


There were five people all crouched around something. Judging by the shrieking, it was the person I heard only seconds ago. I was about to leave my buggy there and go for help when I noticed a coppery smell followed by seeing a pool of blood form under the group. My mouth fell open in horror and disgust at the squishy crunching sounds that followed.



I didn’t know whether the cause of this was drugs or whatever, but I had a new plan, getting the hell out of there. It wasn’t as if there was anything I could do to help. At best, I could report what I saw to the authorities and let them handle it. Forsaking the meat and dairy aisle, I  went straight to the exit, hoping someone would be near the checkout. This was easier said than done because I found more of them.


About twelve of them were shambling where I needed to go.  I got a side profile of one of them and with revulsion, I registered that half their face was missing.


“Are these people goddamn zombies?” I thought, still not fully processing it.


My mind flashbacked to our time in that hospital and I  briefly wondered if Erickson was somehow behind this. After all, he didn’t seem the type to let go of grudges. The answer to that could wait. I needed some kind of p escape plan. My only saving grace is I was fortunate enough not to have any squeaky wheels. I thought about the emergency exit. The issue was I wasn’t sure exactly what I was dealing with.


If that guy I saw in the cereal aisle was any indicator, they were slow. Then again, he could have been in the early infection stages. I was drawing from a lot of zombie media. For all I knew, triggering the alarm would cause the horde of them to come after me. If they were runners, I wasn’t sure if I  would be able to make it to my car by myself, let alone while pushing a bunch of groceries.


I know what you’re thinking.


“Just leave the damn buggy. It’s not worth your life.”


My response to that I didn’t want all my time shopping to go to waste. Therefore, I devised a distraction. I took one can of mixed vegetables and chucked it at a random aisle. I managed to hit a shelf, sending several things crashing to the floor. The zombies dashing to the noise confirmed my fears. 


Wasting no time, I made a beeline.  I passed through the tools section and grabbed two axes. I made it outside, ready to bask in relief.  Several dozen of them were already there. I’d only been in the store for an hour and a half. I guess things can go to Hell fast. 


Speaking of, that was where I was about to go because if God exists, I was going to have some choice words for him. I felt as if I was an antelope to a pride of starving lions. The difference was I didn’t have the benefit of being nearly as fast. Even if I was, the sheer number of them would have made evasion virtually impossible and they were headed right for me. That’s when the sound of a truck engine reached me.


I turned to see Drake’s truck barreling down the hill leading to the parking lot,  The driver swerved, knocking the zombies away. The passenger window came down.


“Get the fuck in,” Drake yelled at me.

“Can you help me with this real quick?”


We put everything in the truck bed including the kart. Then we sped out of there like frogs in a boiling pot. 


“How did you know I was in trouble I asked?”

“It’s Walmart.”

“Fair enough so what happened to you?”

“Long story, first we need  to find somewhere safe.”

“What about the apartment?”


He shook his head and informed me it was overrun.


“Shit’s nuts, man. People were literally getting ripped apart on my way to get you.”

“I saw something similar. Thanks by the way.”

“Don’t mention it.”


Eventually, we stumbled across a motel in a secluded area of town. Nobody was there, but the entrance was unlocked. We made sure to do a once-over, making sure we wouldn’t have any unexpected guests. Any doors where scratching and growling came from, we steered clear of.  After that, we got the groceries in and took them to the kitchen. 


As Drake was putting them away, I tried calling for help only to see that I couldn’t. My phone said unable to make call. Try again. I did with the same result. I still had bars so I was confused. I attempted going online and was greeted by this message.


“Due to unforeseen circumstances, your connection is being indefinitely restricted. Sorry for the inconvenience.”

“What the fuck does that mean?” Drake asked after I showed him.

“I don’t know. This shit’s wild, man.”


None of my browsers or other apps could make a connection. Luckily, the Play Store was working fine and I downloaded a VPN. Granted, it’s the free version which makes my internet mind numbling slow. At least it’s enabled us to have some connection to the outside world and it’s also how I’m able to post all this. Right now it’s a little after midnight and we’re about to crash.


Tomorrow I’ll explain Drake’s side of things and hopefully, we have a way out of here. If past experiences are any indicator, though, I don’t think I [should](https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesFromRose/) be [optimistic.
