I stepped off the tour bus and smelled the sea. The laughter of other passengers mixed with the cool breeze as I looked at the cruise ship towering over the dock. The excursion to the historic center had been perfect - local food, souvenirs, and dozens of photos, mostly of street cats. I was looking forward to the dinner on board, during which the ship was going to leave the port and begin a seven-day journey across the Atlantic towards the Caribbean. 

After I changed clothes and freshened up in my cabin, I headed to the main dining room. An announcement was made that the departure is delayed by about 10 minutes due to a pair of passengers being late. Oh well, the second time during the cruise that this has happened. I walked past slightly annoyed looking passengers and reached the dining room. It was a beautiful restaurant, stretching across the width of the ship and towering three decks high. It was decorated with white panels, completed with blue decorations on the tables and the chandeliers. Most passengers were already seated, while I was led to a small table for two in the back half of the hall. I couldn’t see out of any windows, but I wasn’t bothered by it because the food was very good. The other people were talking, laughing and enjoying their vacation.

 I finished the main course and was looking forward to my desert when I first noticed a couple sitting next to a window. The window was slightly dirty and had round corners, but what caught my attention was that they were crying. They didn’t look particularly sad, but there were tears streaming down their face. Without talking, they stood up simultaneously and left. Soon after, I heard shouting and loud noises outside the dining hall, but I didn’t think much of it and finished my dessert. 

I did not see the couple afterwards and headed for a small library lounge on one of the lower decks. On my way, I saw multiple crew members speaking quietly to each other while looking slightly nervous. After I sat down with my book, a crime novel from the 30s, I felt a slight sense of dread. I was sure it came from an overall feeling of unease coming from nearby crew members. After I noticed two of them talking, I started walking slowly in their general direction, pretending to look at the bookshelves. “They were brought to the cooling room on deck 3!”, I heard one of them say, followed by “I heard it was a mess! I am glad we were not there.” They then walked away, leaving me wondering what they were talking about. I wasn’t in the mood for my book anymore and headed upwards towards the open decks to catch some fresh air.

 I walked up the stairs, deck by deck, thinking about the two crew members. What kind of mess were they talking about? Why the cooling room? Just as I reached the top of the stairs, heading for the door leading to the upper deck, a young woman opened the door an came back inside. Or should I say, she just walked straight through the door without even lifting her hand, her Body just walked against the doors and pushed them open while walking slowly forward, like an unstoppable object. She looked straight ahead, not noticing anyone around her, but I immediately saw the tears. Not small ones, but a stream of tears running down her face. She did not even try to brush them away, just kept walking towards the stairs while looking forward. She slowly walked past me. I thought she was going back to her cabin, but she suddenly stopped in the middle of the stairway. 

She slowly turned around with a smile, not a happy smile, but one you would give a crying child, a smile filled with compassion and pity. Suddenly, she bowed down and slammed her head forwards with an enormous force against the edge of a stair. Blood covered the stairs, and the sound of her skull splitting open echoed from the steel walls of the stairwell. I ran. I should have alerted a crew member or tried to administer first aid, but the feeling of unease was so big that I immediately ran outside on the open deck, but what I saw there, made me stop in an instant. About five passengers were outside, ten more were lying on the ground covered in blood. The five passengers all smiled with tears running down their face. One of them had a thin, broken steel rod in his hands, but before I could see what he had planned to do with it, I screamed and ran back inside, past the woman on the floor and straight into my cabin. 

I slammed the door shut and sat down, burying my face in my hands and sobbing. I examined my cabin, everything was clean and tidy. I wish I had a balcony or even a window, but I just stared against the wall. The slow movement of the ship was soothing, and I calmed down a bit. I sat on the ground for what feels like hours until I gathered the courage to peek outside the cabin again. 

I opened the door and looked down the hallway. It was quiet. The handrail on the side of the hallway had red stains on one spot, which I quickly looked away from. I moved towards the lifeboat deck to look for a crewmember. I headed up one deck, and just before the door leading to the lifeboats, I stopped. Letters, written in dried blood, covered the glass window of the door. “Don’t look down”, was all it said.

I hesitated and refrained from pushing the door open. I turned around and saw a woman looking at me from a few meters away. I immediately looked at her eyes, and thankfully, there were no tears, just a frightened look. I immediately felt that her gaze also went straight to my eyes to check for tears. “Did you look?”, she yelled at me. I told her that I didn’t. After coming closer, I asked her if she knew what happened. “Passengers all across the ship have started to cry and hurt themselves! I don’t know what comes over them. I first noticed when I was chatting with a guy in the main atrium, when he suddenly looked out of the window and started crying almost like someone told him his family died. But he did not look like he was sad, he looked like he is sad for someone else. Overwhelmed by compassion. He then… he went and…” she started sobbing, but she did not have to continue. We both knew what happened to everyone that looked. 

After she introduced herself as „Sarah“, We decided to move further to the front of the ship in search of crewmembers who might be able to contact emergency services. It was already strange that no one showed up, we were still close enough to shore for helicopters or the coast guard to reach us. We tried to use our smartphones, but there was no signal. The ships wifi, advertised by the cruise company for being one of the fastest on the sea, had vanished. As we were moving forward, passengers with tears streaming down their faces walked inside from the lifeboat deck, but we never looked at them for long. 

Just before reaching the front of the ship, we saw a panicked crewmember walking towards the lifeboats. He saw us and gestured us to come. Even though the crying passengers were never paying attention to us, he was whispering: “They looked! All of the offices on the bridge, they looked!”. The feeling of unease intensified. If there is no one on the bridge anymore, we cannot contact the outside or turn around. The crewmember, who introduced himself as Jim, told us he is going to try and lower a lifeboat to escape while wearing a blindfold.

With a nod of approval, we prepared to go out on the lifeboat deck, tying a ripped sleeve storing our heads. Jim went first and pushed the door open. Cold air hit our faces like a thousand needles. We slowly moved forward and then to the left. After about 7 meters we reached a lifeboat crane. Jim pulled a lever, and the lifeboat began to ascent from the top of our heads towards the deck level so that passengers could enter. Just before it reached the floor, a part of the crane arm descending from the ceiling hit my head and ripped my blindfold from my eyes. 
The impact threw me to the ground and left me disoriented. I heard the others scream something to me, but I felt dizzy and only heard their voices as a faint rumbling. I opened my eyes.

I saw the waves below me. A beautiful sight, with the moonlight reflecting in the waves. First I saw nothing, then I noticed motion beneath the waves. I thought the motion came from sharks or dolphins judging by the size, but after my eyes adjusted to the dark, I realised. 
Human bodies, moving with the ship. One of the bodies reached its hand towards the hull and started climbing, somehow having a grip on the perfectly flat surface of the ship. The body seemed long drowned but climbed upwards with a wide smiling mouth. 

Poor thing, I thought. It must be so cold and hungry. I felt pity for it, as if I found a dying animal on the road. Tears started streaming down my face. I could feel that it was so hungry, starved for years. If only I could give it something to eat. The tears kept coming. It reached the top and smiled at me. If only I had food on me. Maybe I could give it something of mine? It needs my body more than me. It looks so weak and desperate for food. Smiling so friendly. The sharp edge of the railing caught my attention. If only I could give it something to eat. I was standing in front of the railing, slowly raising my head. I wanted to crack my head open to give the creature food. It filled me with joy knowing that it would finally be able to eat something. Just as my neck muscles prepared to slam down, a hand tried to grab the back of my shirt. It did not bother me, I was concentrated on the railing. 

Suddenly, the hand grabbed me and violently pulled me back, it was Sarah, pulling me into the lifeboat. The smile on the creature vanished, and it opened its mouth wide to reveal many rows of sharp teeth. It’s gaze was suddenly filled with unfathomable anger. It leapt forward, but the lifeboat already lowered. It felt like an eternity to reach the waterline, but as soon as we touched down, I stopped crying. Confused and scared, we sailed towards the coast while the ship slowly disappeared behind the horizon.
