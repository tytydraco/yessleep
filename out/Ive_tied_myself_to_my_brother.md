What’s the point of a satellite GPS phone when the atmosphere glitters with the debris of Starlink and military installations. The ISS is nothing more than a smear across the sky. I took the phone from a cluttered electronics store near the border between New Mexico and Texas, by the Air Force base. It’s clunky, definitely not a new model by any standard, has the worst battery life, and weighs a ton, taking up a solid space in my pack. But it’s battery-powered. That’s the key. It takes four triple-As and uses GPS and radio. Neat, huh? We haven’t used it in a few weeks.

After nights and days of silence or repeating warnings and government alerts, the desperation morphs into some grotesque form of apathetic contempt. Now the batteries go toward our flashlights and other random pieces of junk we happen across. No more radio, and the GPS hasn’t worked since everyone shot down each other’s satellites. We can’t trust anyone in person, so it goes to show that you wouldn’t be able to trust voices over the net. 

The palm of my hand drags against the ground and from my mind entirely not by my own volition.

“Would you quit it?”

Todd hums in response and yanks his hand to the side again, the rope on my wrist pulling taut and wrenching my hand from where I’m trying to put the phone back into my pack. I stop, my face falling flat, and turn slowly to glare at him. He just smiles behind his hand, his elbow resting on his knee. We sit beside each other, nearly thigh to thigh in the dirt. 

“You’re being difficult right now, you know that?” 

His grin just grows. “You’re the one who can’t read a map,” he chides, tugging on the rope. 

I scowl, pulling out the compass. “Sue me, I wasn’t a *scout*. I was too busy having friends to fuck around in the woods. Thought that was your thing, Scout Master Dowser?”

“Fuck you—”

“How about you read the map then?” That question is rhetorical; he’s not touching the map again. I flip him off and place the compass on the water-damaged sheet of paper lying out in front of us. Neither of us really knows how to use a map, but you tend to learn on the fly when trying to avoid populated places. Anywhere with mimics, really. 

The needle point spins for a moment before settling to our right. Todd hums again, his free hand digging idly in the hard dirt. He scoops some of it up and rolls the pebbles between his fingers. I watch the sediment and rocks tumble down, some of it dusting onto the edge of the paper. 

Rolling my eyes, I swipe the mess away, “Watch it. The map’s already fucked up enough as is.”

“Yeah? And whose fault was that?”

“Yours.” His unfortunate dip in the Animas while holding it is why he’s been permanently barred from map duty. 

He barks out a laugh, “Right,” and tosses a handful of pebbles at me. Some of them fall past my collar and into my bra. I sputter and tug at my clothes to get the rocks out, whipping the dirt off as best as I can despite the state of our clothes. 

“Bitch—!” I yank my hand to the side. The arm Todd’s leaning his weight on gets pulled out from under him, and his body slams into my side, sending both of us sprawling. 

Despite being a gangly eighteen-year-old, he still weighs a good thirty pounds more than me. We ignore the six-inch height difference. His boyish giggles are loud in my ear as he uses his dead weight to lie on me. I half-heartedly shove at him, trying to shift him off of me.

When he doesn’t move, I jab my thumbs into his ribs through his thick corduroy jacket. He jolts with a squeal that breaks halfway through and rolls off of me. The rope between us stays taut. 

We lay side by side for a moment before I sit up, scooting back over to the map, reaching over to grab the compass that was knocked to the side in our scuffle. Todd joins me a minute later, leaning over my shoulder to read the geography.

“Why do we even need this again? Isn’t the point to *avoid* all the cities, because they’re, y’know, deathtraps?”

I roll my eyes. “Gee, I sure know how to orient myself without landmarks,” I deadpan, waving my hands towards the wall of trees. “Man, I wish we had some handy ones. Oh, I know! We have towns! Holy smokes, that could work!” 

He bumps me with his shoulder, laughing under his breath. “Shut up. How far out are we?”

I look down again, measuring the distance on the map. I’m terrible at land navigation seeing as we’d barely covered it in ROTC before… everything. We handrailed with the Rio Grande for a week or so before cutting through the Apache reservation to hit the Navajo Dam a few nights ago. That should put us south of Durango. “Mmh… like—30—20 miles? Somewhere around that, I think.”

“Wow, good job.” His cheer is painfully sarcastic, “Your margin of error is only 10 miles this time!” 

I glare at him as he continues, “Much better than Albuquerque.”

“Shut the fuck up. Asshole,” I say, tugging on the rope again as he laughs. He tugs back.

\- - - - -

The fire crackles in the evening sunlight. We’ll have to put it out soon. I watch the sun slowly dip further and further past the horizon. The logs pop and sparks bounce off the toe box of my boots, but little smoke rises. We haven’t gotten the hang of smokeless campfires. 

Todd sits quietly beside me. His shoulder is warm against mine as he leans on me. When the sun finally leaves the sky, I bump my knee to his thigh and move to stand. He slowly follows, limbs leaden with sleep. Together we stomp out the fire, careful to completely put out the sparks and hide the ash. 

“Go to bed, I’ll watch first,” I say, pushing him to sit.

He shakes his head with a yawn, mouth wide. His missing incisor on full display, “No, it’s my turn for first.”

“Go to bed,” I repeat, shaking my head back at him. “You fall asleep on watch on good nights.” I push his shoulder again, finally forcing him and, because of the rope, myself to sit.

His scoff turns into another yawn midway, “Fuck you, no I don’t.” His argument is severely discredited as I watch him fall asleep in real-time. 

The bags under his eyes are dark, deeper than I’d like. I lean down, my breath fanning out on his hair, voice barely a whisper, “What color was the river when I fell?”

He huffs, eyes still shut, and whispers back under his breath, “Red as your hands when you reached for help.”

Before his breathing slows, he murmurs ‘*Wake me up halfway*.’ I won’t. He needs the extra rest more than I do. 

The woods are dark without the sun or the fire. We have flashlights tucked in the side pockets of our packs, but we don’t have very many batteries left since the last time we braved a town. 

I contemplate pulling it out as the dark gets darker. I don’t, despite the fact that we haven’t seen a mimic in over two weeks. And that we’ve never seen one out this far. They like to stay where the corpses are. That, or where there are more of them so that they can feed on each other. We don’t exactly hang around long enough to find out if they’ve resorted to cannibalism again. 

And there’s no thrill to their hunt with animals. None that I’ve ever seen at least. People are much easier to trick. Less instincts and too much logic.

When the moon is no longer overhead, I shift to prod Todd awake. My eyes hurt and I want to take my glasses off. I jab him again when he ignores me. This time he groans, rolling against my leg. I just raise a brow at him when he blinks up at me. His hair is a mess of cow-licked brown locks just a shade darker than mine. Probably closer to what our Mom’s was. Is. 

“Mmmh—“ he licks his dry lips and tries to scrub the sleep from his eyes, “is it my turn?” I just wait quietly for him to wake up.

When he finally sits up, I hum and flop down on my back. I go to take my glasses off but he beats me to it, placing them on what I assume to be my pack. I mumble thanks before I’m out, exhaustion like a cool stream as I sink under the surface into sleep. 

\- - - - -

I blink awake to a hand on my shoulder, fingers digging into the muscle. The pressure is uncomfortable and I’m a second away from shoving the hand off of me and rolling back over to sleep before I’m being shaken. Todd whispers my name, his voice frantic under his breath.

Awareness floods in, sleep being shoved aside by adrenaline. My eyes lock onto the blurry figure of him crouched beside me. I can see his profile, though hazy around the edges, but he’s not looking at me. He’s staring off into the woods. A quick glance towards his eyeline yields nothing, only the wall of trees I can’t distinguish from one another.

My hand creeps to my pack, brushing against the wireframe of my glasses. Slowly, I carry them along the length of my body. Todd’s hand spasms and he tenses. My breath catches. One of the trees shifts, stepping out from behind bark. 

I shove my glasses onto my face and grab my pack, barely swinging it onto my back before Todd’s yanking us to our feet. He’s already pulled out his tire iron, holding it at his side. His eyes still haven't left the figure. My pack cuts into my neck when I yank my bat free from its strap. The worn wood, a familiar weight in my hand. 

The mimic is still formless, bone white, artificial flesh unmolded into a human image. Its facade is eerily uncanny as it regards us with its featureless face, smooth and without eyes. It can still see us, somehow. We know it does because the second we take our eyes off of it, it will shift. Its limbs will contort, skin will darken, and a stolen face will stare back. They don’t shift when they know there are eyes on them.

The lack of sound catches up to me. The soft light of the morning is filtering through the canopy of the trees, yet there are no bird songs. There are no insect calls. There is nothing but silence and the sound of Todd and my own breathing. The unnaturalness of the mimics wards off life. That or the life has already been consumed.

Todd still hasn’t let go of the hand that he used to pull me up and I tighten my grip, feeling him do the same. The mimic stands stationary, waiting. It is waiting for us to move, to make noise. To look away for a moment.

There’s a crack to our right, underbrush being trampled. A beat of silence follows. I can feel a line of sweat roll down my cheek and Todd’s hand shakes in mine. Then the treeline burst open. I choke down a shout and push him behind me, my bat raised. A large elk comes barreling out. Its massive antlers that arc high above its head are tossing around in distress. Todd and I watch in horror as it flails, kicking at nothing, before falling onto its side. Blood gushes out of its throat in a wide spray. Arterial spurts paint the grass a sickening red. The elk’s squeal cuts off with a snap and it falls still, its hind leg still twitching in the dirt.

Todd takes a half step back when the body gives a lurch, a crunch echoing through the clearing. My hand tightens in his and I shuffle back with him. The elk’s chest raises up slightly, its neck curling downwards with the dead weight of its antlers. Blood gushes to the ground in thick rivulets. Then, from beneath the elk’s mauled neck and thick body, a pale arm extends. 

A mouth follows. Not a face, not really—just a bloodied maw splitting its sleek visage in two as if it had unhinged its jaw revealing a mouth full of fangs. With a wet *shlunk*, its teeth unlatch from the elk’s throat and it crawls the rest of the way from underneath the corpse, the elk having fallen on it when it died.

The mimic shakes itself, droplets of blood splattering about. Its mouth slowly seals back together, the seam between lower and upper jaw smoothing into one plate, hiding away the hollow cavern that splits its face. 

I can’t breathe. If I do then it’ll hear. Todd’s grip is painful, like my bones are about to snap, but I can’t let go.

There’s a sound, a shuffle of footsteps, and the bloodied mimic’s head cocks to the side, listening. It isn’t facing us nor does it turn to regard us. Instead it launches itself over the body of the elk and into the form of the first mimic, slamming into it, and sending both of them tumbling into the underbrush. 

Todd heaves in a breath and I’m unfrozen, shoving him back. We sprint as fast as we can, still careful of the noise we make winding through the trees. The sound of the mimics fighting gets quieter with each minute we spend in silence. Then, an awful cry cuts through the woods. It echoes off the trees until it sounds like it’s coming from everywhere. Todd mumbles something I don’t catch, looking over his shoulder. His brows furrow as the sound grows more piercing.

The gurgled, dual-toned wail of agony carries on for a moment longer before suddenly crescendoing and then falling silent. We share a look as we step over a log side-by-side. It’s been a long time since we’ve heard a mimic’s death call.

\- - - - -

The river gurgles across the bank of the eddy we decided to camp out in. The water is cold, almost unbearable, and my body shakes as we stand in it up to our ankles. Todd is trembling as well, his hand still in mine. 

“Max.”

I blink at the sunlight that glints off the rushing water.

“Maxine.” His hand tightens in mine. I hum, squeezing back. “What was that?”

My eyes fall shut and I shake my head lightly, “I don’t know.”

“We’re maybe ten miles out from Durango. They don’t come this far out. How did that happen?”

“I. Don’t. Know.” I raise my free hand to rub at my eyes.

“How—”

“I don’t know!” We both fall silent at that. I swallow thickly around the lump in my throat. 

There’s a beat. 

We both just listen to the birds hopping along the bank before I croak, “I don’t know. They—they must have run out of food and started spreading out. We know they eat each other when the food runs out. So,” I sigh, “I guess they’re starting to hunt again. Animals now too?”

“You can’t know that.”

Red bleeds into my vision and I whirl on Todd, “What the fuck do you want? Answers? I don’t have answers for you! I don’t know what the fuck is happening!” I throw my hands up, ignoring how Todd’s arm jolts with my movement, “We know they stayed in clusters. We know they’re solitary hunters. We know they—they still clump together despite everything saying they shouldn’t. We know that they don’t leave the cities. So, I don’t know why they’re acting differently—I’m not some goddamn expert in this shit! Not anymore than you fucking are.” I turn to face him, my pointer finger making contact with his chest, “But it doesn’t matter.”

Todd snarls and opens his mouth to argue. I cut him off, “No—listen to me. We don’t have the luxury to fight about why mimics do the things they do. So, it *doesn’t. Matter*. We just have to adapt, like we’ve always done. Okay?”

His brown eyes search mine and he nods. I nod back, “This isn’t the end of the world,” he huffs, rolling his eyes, “Really, it isn’t. At least not anymore than it already is. We just keep doing what we’ve always done. We take turns with watches. We store non-perishables and eat fresh when we can. We travel along fresh water,” I gesture to the eddy we stand in, “And we stick together.” At that, I grab the rope. “We stick together and we *stay* together.”

“What about Mom?”

My breath stutters in my chest and my heart thumps. What bravado I had parading as anger fizzles out. “We—she—we’re still going to Rifle. That’s not changing.” His shoulders ease into a slump. His relief is painfully obvious and it hurts, “She said she was waiting for us on Grandma’s ranch, so that’s where we’re going to meet her.”

“Promise?” I blink at him.

“What?”

“Promise me.” His face is hard, serious as he holds my gaze, “Promise me that we’re still going to Rifle to find Mom.”

“What are you talking about? Of course we’re still going to find Mom. Where is this coming from?” I search his eyes.

“Just—Max, please. Promise me that we won’t give up on her.” I swallow, “I promise. I promise we’re going to Mom. We’re only 250 miles away. That’s just two weeks. We’re gonna find Mom.”

His smile is weary but hopeful. I can tell he’s still scared. I am too. I haven’t seen a mimic stalk in a long time. I also haven’t seen them fight like that. It’s easy to forget that humanity is being hunted to extinction when we stay away from their grounds, wandering through the wilderness. It’s easy to forget that people were watched for weeks before being tricked into becoming a meal. Like the mimics play with their food.

I frown and wipe my thumb across Todd’s cheek, smearing the dried droplet of the elk’s blood that has caked onto his skin. 

“We’re going to be okay.”

\- - - - -

The river flows quickly, tumbling over stones and oscillating between white water roaring and a nearly silent trickle. We follow it north until splitting away from it to skirt around Durango’s downtown. The forest fades in parts into too open ground. On a particularly cold night, Todd and I end up pressed side by side to ward off the chill. We’re tucked into a crag, letting the rocks buffer the crisp autumn breeze that signals the end of summer.

Todd snores above me, his head lying on top of mine. Though, I can’t sleep. I fiddle with the rope, running the course, braided material between my fingers before checking on the knots. They’re still holding tight, the rope melted together so that they can’t be separated by accident. We’re going to need to find a new one soon. This one is becoming frayed and there’s a cut near the middle that worries me. 

It was my idea, the rope, and to tie them together. Todd didn’t understand at first. He didn’t see Dad—I squeeze my eyes shut and press my hands hard onto my knees, unintentionally jerking on the rope. My breath catches when Todd huffs something before stilling, sinking back into sleep. I drop the rope from my too-tight grip, the pattern of it imprinted on my palm. 

The mimics learn and they trick. Todd hasn’t seen it firsthand, not even after the elk. He’s only seen the aftermath. The carnage. My eyes fall shut, but blood paints the back of my eyelids. Everything is red and it’s cold—*so, so cold*. 

There’s a wet sound, like fabric tearing or meat being ripped from the bone. Maybe both. 

The scent of blood sits heavy in the air and then I’m no longer lying on rocks. My back is pressed into the wood of our front door. I need to leave, but my body is frozen. My knees shake with the sheer terror that grips me, robbing me of my ability to breathe. The crunching is the first sound that registers. The sharp cracking of bone and the ripping of flesh and sinew. I can’t tear my eyes away. 

The mimic’s mouth is unhinged, jaw splitting all the way down its thin, jutting throat. Its teeth are sunk deep into Dad’s chest, breaking through his ribs and pulling free his heart and lungs with spurts of blood. My teeth. It's my face buried in Dad’s flesh. Its hair falls in its face, light brown drenched a deep red. 

Two bloodied hands reach up from the floor, fingers flickering between disguise and sharp, pale nails, to grab both sides of Dad’s rib cage. With what seems like very little force, he is eviscerated. 

Gore paints the walls and sprays across my body. It runs down my face, drips off my chin, and soaks into my clothes. The warmth on my skin shocks me out of the petrified horror I was stuck in. 

And then it’s not Dad. 

Todd’s weak gasps tear through my core, his hand reaching for me. His mouth is moving and he’s gurgling something, but he can’t speak through the blood that’s gushing from his lips and out the exposed sinew of his esophagus. He can’t even swallow the red, hot liquid down. 

This is wrong, this—this isn’t what happened. 

Todd’s eyes start to glaze over, tears cutting tracks through the gore painting his cheeks. Brown eyes fall dead, empty. 

His grasping fingers fall motionless, still outstretched for my help. 

His body is still rocking with the ripping of the mimic arms buried in his chest. Its mouth devouring, hollowing him out, making him a shell. 

I’m going to throw up. A sob is stuck in my throat and I’m choking on it. 

I grab the door handle and wrench it open. The mimic whips its head up, my eyes meet my own. I can see the hunger. Desperation and depravity watch me until the door swings shut.

Something shakes me awake and I flail, a panicked shout catching in my throat and I bite my tongue. Hands grab my wrists, keeping me from falling off the ledge we’re camping on.

The sound of tearing flesh is gone, only my heavy breathing remains. I shake in his hands.

“Maxine?” My eyes peel open to meet Todd’s. They're lighter than mine, more like our Mom’s. I have our father’s dark eyes.

“I’m—I’m okay. I’m alright.” He doesn’t believe me, his lips pressing together into a thin line. “I am, I just had a dream. It’s okay.” I take a deep breath, hold it for a moment, and let it out in a long sigh, “I’m sorry for waking you up. You can go back to sleep.”

He shakes his head and pulls me to lay back beside him. 

We sit quietly, listening to the distant calls of coyotes. The sky is dark, the moon hidden behind thick clouds.

Todd’s voice cuts through the tentative peace, “Was it about Dad?”

The air in my chest stutters and it’s answer enough. He just pulls me closer. I hear him take a quiet breath, open his mouth, pause, and then finally say, “What did you see when you fell into the river?”

“My reflection staring back at me.”

\- - - - -

“Maaaax…” Todd complains for the umpteenth time, droning my name for a few seconds before I physically cannot handle it anymore. I can feel a vein pulsing in my temple.

“Oh my fucking god! What?” I’m still trudging ahead of him, my left arm hanging back as he drags his feet, his right arm pulled taut. Good thing he’s left-handed. It’s the little things.

“I’m so sick of this,” he gestures to the knee-high water we’re wading through, “stupid fucking route. I can’t feel my toes!” He yanks on the rope again when I don’t slow with him, instead continuing to walk with the flow of the river.

“Just—fuck—!” I slip, nearly tumbling sideways down the slope and into the faster-rushing part of the Gunnison. “Just…give me a break. I don’t really know how much further it is until we hit the T. It could be a few days. Hopefully, the bank widens up ahead and we can dry off for a bit.”

He grumbles something under his breath but stops pulling against me.

Eventually, the Gunnison does widen enough that we can pull off our soaked socks and shoes to let them sun dry for a few hours before the sun sets. Todd must realize how much I’m starting to worry the darker it gets because he rushes to get dressed after me. 

“What’s wrong?” 

I side-eye him with a frown at his fake-casual tone. “Nothing.” 

He scoffs at that. 

“No, really! I just don’t like that we haven’t found somewhere to sleep yet.” I half-heartedly gesture to the little clearing we’re in. One side is a steep incline up the side of the gorge and the other is near white water rapids. The rushing water is loud and threatens to drown out his reply.

“Max.” He sighs, looking out over the frothing water and onto the other bank, “I get it.”

I shake my head and raise a brow, “Get what?”

He continues, voice low, “I know you keep trying to protect me from all of—” He fumbles for a word before finishing with a weak, “this,” gesturing to both the clearing and nothing at all.

“I know about Dad—” he whispers and turns to face me. My heart pinches.

“Don’t.”

“I know what happened. I—well I didn’t see his body or anything but I didn’t need to.” He grabs my shoulders, trying to meet my eyes that are locked onto the fraying collar of his shirt. “It wasn’t your fault.” *Oh fuck*, I bite down on my bottom lip to keep it from wobbling. My face feels hot. “Please look at me?”

My breath shakes. I blink up at him, tears refusing to fall.

“What happened to Dad wasn’t your fault. You couldn’t have known.”

“It was!” I explode, already out of breath, “You don’t understand!” I shake my head, my hands coming up to hold his wrists, “It looked like me! Dad thought it was me and he let it in and it—it—” I choke up. It *was* my fault. The tears fall. 

Then my face is buried in corduroy. 

And he’s rocking me as I sob. 

I faintly register him whispering that it’s okay which I counter with answering apologies. Because it *is* my fault. Dad *did* die because of me. It may not have been my hands that killed him, but it was my face that lured him to his death. It was my voice that laughed at his cries of pain and mocked him when he begged for his life. My mouth that buried deep in his neck. The last thing he saw was me leading him to his death.

\- - - - -

By the time my tears dried and my voice had gone hoarse, the sun had begun to set. Streaks of dying light cut down the ridge and dance across the fast-flowing water.

“Max, it’s okay.” Todd stiffens against me. I blink blearily up at him, my glasses askew. His face is white, eyes wide. “Max, I forgive you.” His mouth doesn’t move.

My heart stops in my chest when I make eye contact with him—it. I can see brown eyes and lanky limbs over Todd’s shoulder. It’s wearing his face.

I grab him by the lapels of his jacket and shove him to my side, reaching for the bat at my waist. Todd stumbles, righting himself quickly, and pulls out his tire iron. We’re both breathing hard, staring down the mimic.

It just stands at the edge of the river, pants to its knees soaked.

*Fuck, it was following us*.

Todd’s gasp tells me that he’s come to the same conclusion.

“Max,” it drawls in perfect cadence, “where’s Mom?”

My jaw clenches when its mouth curves into something imitating worry, and I can feel Todd bristling at my side.

“Shut your fucking mouth!” he spits, hand creaking around the tire iron with how tightly he’s squeezing it.

I glance over my shoulder towards the downstream bank. It narrows again, which means we can’t run along it. Even if we did, I look back at the mimic to watch it take a casual step forward, hands in its jacket pockets. Even if we did, we wouldn’t be able to outrun it.

They’re able to overpower elk and split trees with the force of their bodies. There’s no way we’ll be able to outrun it. I watch the water as it runs by. *If we can get into the rapids…*

I take a step back, Todd follows. Both of them do. We edge backwards toward the end of the clearing, water lapping at our ankles.

It might not follow us into the river. I remember the piles of white, waterlogged corpses bunched up at the bottom of pools. I remember hearing about people fleeing to boats. But, I’ve never seen one swim.

My brows furrow and I tighten my grip on the wood of my bat. I have to tell Todd what to do without the mimic overhearing from where it stands almost 20 feet away. I inhale—it tenses, almost unperceivable—and then it’s right in front of me. False face a hair’s length away from mine. 

Everything goes white, a ringing heavy in my ears. There’s a sound, my name before a splash. Heat blossoms across the back of my head and a sharp ache radiates from my left shoulder and down my outstretched arm. The world is spinning.

I groan, rolling to my front, and try to push myself to my feet. Everything tilts and I land on my hands and knees. What—?

The rope lays across the rocks with one frayed end. It’s still knotted around my wrist. *Todd!* A strangled cry rips itself from my throat. *Where is he?* Panic blurs the edges of my vision.

The ringing is subsiding, the sound of the water roaring back into my awareness, along with Todd’s voice. I can see him on the bank of the river, wading up to mid-thigh as he tussles with…himself. *Oh fuck*.

I shove myself to unsteady feet, ignoring how the world threatens to tilt on its axis. Neither person has a pack on or a weapon, so I watch as they fight to push the other into the rapids.

“Todd!” One of the boys looks up at me, the fear bleeding from his eyes. He goes to shout something before both of them fall into the depths.

My wail echoes down the ravine and I rush into the water. It’s not enough. Todd and the mimic are swept downstream towards the white water and rocks.

I sprint after them, throwing up cascades of water. The rope cracks against my side. I’m already getting waterlogged, my pack dragging across the surface of the river. With a yell, I tear it off of me and onto the bank before pulling myself through the shallows.

I can’t see anyone in the water up ahead. No flailing limbs, no bobbing heads, nothing. 

My thighs burn the longer I trudge along the shallow shelf, the current bolstering me along, and my head pounds with my heartbeat, the last light of the sun glaring down at me.

The path I cut down the river lets me bypass the worst of the rapids, the water crashing off protruding boulders and sharp, pressure-carved stones. The more sections of white water I pass, the more my chest squeezes and the more desperate I become.

“Todd! Where are you? Todd, ple—ase!” my voice cracks as I sob.

The bank widens again and I pull myself out of the water, my knees shaking, threatening to collapse under me. The sun is nearly gone leaving deep shadows to cut lines across the river and its rocky shores. A deep red glow illuminates the sky. 

There is a dark lump half submerged in the water. Wet, matted hair covers his face, but it’s Todd.

I let out a wordless cry, relief coursing through my body. I stumble towards him, dropping onto my knees harshly at his side. The pebbles cut into the fabric of my jeans, but I can barely feel it through the persistent cold that sinks into my bones. 

“Todd?” He doesn’t respond, lying on his front. The water laps against the side of his body. I grab his shoulder, struggling to roll him over and onto his back.

His breath is a weak rattle, a trail of water running from his chin, and his dark hair curling across his forehead. His skin is pale and his lips blue. 

My hands hover uselessly above his stuttering chest. I don’t want to hurt him. He’s already battered enough, by the mimic or by the rocks. There’s a gash above his brow and another on his collarbone that are both bleeding sluggishly. A tear runs down my cheek and I pick up his right hand, his fingers scraped raw. Like he tried to claw his way up the shore. 

His body is torn; shallow cuts and welts litter any exposed skin visible through the rips in his soaked clothes. He still hasn’t woken up, though his wheezes have deepened significantly, calming to heavy pants. 

My arms tremble when I lay my hands down on his chest. “Todd?” He isn’t waking up, but he’s alive. I take a steadying breath. Alive I can work with. 

I yank at the hem of my shirt, ripping a strip free. There’s a first aid kit in both of our packs—packs that neither of us have. So, my shirt will have to do. Trying to be careful, I wrap the makeshift bandage around his head, pressing it tight to stem the blood running down his temple. 

There’s a sound from above me, from up the ridge, but there’s nothing there when I peer up the steep incline. I feel faint as my heart drops in my chest. *Where did the mimic go?* 

My hands still grip the wrappings on Todd’s head, though I’m searching the bank and water for any movement. A minute goes by, two, but there isn’t another noise and no copied faces or featureless, white bodies come crawling out from the river. 

I take one more scan across the clearing before focusing back on Todd who is starting to shift against me. His right hand skips across the stones, reaching for something. He winces, his raw fingers flinching from the cold rocks, so I pull his hand into mine again, holding him gently. I watch him, waiting for his eyes to flutter open, but he remains stubbornly unconscious. His fingers squeeze down on mine for a moment before relaxing again. 

I sigh, “Todd, please wake up.” My voice wobbles, “I can’t carry your heavy ass. Not all the way to Rifle—”

He groans, eyes fluttering behind closed lids.

“—and to Mom.”

He settles and I lean down to lay my forehead against his lax fingers.

“Please don’t leave me.” I finish weakly, barely a whisper.

The sun is nearly set and Todd still hasn’t woken up. I don’t know what to do and I can’t help him. I can’t even cry anymore, my tears are long gone. Just dried streaks down my dirty cheeks. 

I’m trailing my fingertips down his forearm in hopes that it will soothe whatever pain he’s feeling. I’m dancing them over cuts I can’t bandage, over parts that are rubbed of skin all together. My lips thin. He must have been dragged across the river bottom. I thought I’d taught him to swim better, but I don’t know how any experience stands up to rapids. 

I bring my hand back up to the back of his hand to start my fingers’ journey, but I pause. My fraying rope is bunched to my midarm, the loop still intact. My hand spasms. *Where is his rope?*

I drag my eyes from watching his face to the hand against my cheek, before slowly pulling it away. His rope is gone. There’s no loop where there should be. It’d snapped in the middle, right where it’d gotten snagged early on leaving a shallow cut. The loop should have stayed intact. 

The skin on his wrist is too battered to see any specific gouges from the rope. My wrist is burned from the pressure of it straining before snapping. I can’t tell. My eyes burn. Both his arms are so hurt that I can’t tell if he ever had the rope on his wrist. I can’t—

A knife is carving into my chest. I can’t breathe.

—I can’t tell if this is Todd.

The tears I thought I’d run out of are obscuring my vision. My heartbeat pounds in my ears, the roaring of blood mixing with the rushing of the river to create a cacophony of agony. 

“Max?” My eyes snap to his face.

Bleary eyes are peering out from behind lashes. They’re unfocused, but still find mine. I don’t move. I don’t breathe. I’m frozen as I watch him slowly wake up.

He’s still lying half in the river, the shallow water flowing over his clothes and catching his hair where it's grown over his ears.

“Max,” his voice is hoarse and it trails off, “Max what—what happened?”

I stay quiet, gently laying his hand down on his chest. My voice is somehow steady, “What was the color of the river when I fell?”

His brows furrow, “What—?”

I have to know, “The color.”

He squeezes his eyes shut and huffs, “What are you talking about? What is going on?”

I shake my head, the tears still falling, “Please, I need to know. What color was the river—the color of the river when I fell? C’mon, Todd, please.”

He just stares at me, his pupils wrong, only one dilating, “I—I don’t know. Max, my head really hurts.” His voice is nearly a whine by the end.

My head shakes again, “You know this. What color was the river?”

He hesitates, “Brown? I don’t—I don’t remember you falling in a river.” Todd shifts, pushing himself up onto his elbows. His head rolls onto his shoulder, eyes falling half-lidded.

“Todd, please don’t do this.”

“Max, I don’t know, okay? What ha—” He freezes, eyes flying wide. His chest stutters, “The mimic…” he breathes.

I just watch him.

“What happened to the mimic?”

I shake my head for the third time, lips thin with how hard I’m clenching my jaw, and stand. He watches me warily as I take a step back.

“Max, what happened to the mimic?”

“I don’t know…”

His frown deepens and he glances down to my wrist, to the broken rope hanging limply at my side. Then his eyes jump to his own bare wrist.

“Oh.” His brown eyes meet mine, “Max, it’s me. I swear! I—fuck!” His arm gives out, sending him crashing back to ground, his cheek pressing into the smooth stones. 

I don’t think my head ever stopped shaking, “I don’t know that. I—I can’t know that.”

“What are you talking about? It’s me! Are you serious right now?”

“Mimics trick! That’s what they do! It’s been following us, *listening to us*! I don’t know what we’ve mentioned within its earshot.” I swallow, “You don’t have the rope.”

“I don’t know! It must have—I don’t know—come off in the water?” His voice trails off, uncertain, staring blankly at the dark sky.

A beat of silence.

“Finish mom’s poem. What color was the river when I fell in?”

His eyes fall shut, a tear running to mix with the blood from his temple.

“Todd, please.” I’m pleading for anything—anything he can give me to break this horrible nightmare.

“I don’t remember.” His words shake and so does my resolve, “I…”

The mimic could have been trailing us for that long. I could be the same one that took my face. My hands curl into fists. That’s why it took Todd’s face in the first place. It saw me. It saw me and targeted me, hungering for more even though it was elbow-deep in Dad’s body. And now it’s taken Todd. There’s no rope. Even if it’d snapped, the loop should still be there. And Todd’s a good swimmer, much better than me. He made the varsity team as a freshman.

The image of piled up, empty corpses littering swimming pools flashes across my mind. I don’t think mimics can swim. And his bruises and cuts all bleed red.

A beat.

I’ve never seen a mimic bleed before. 

A harsh breeze cuts down the gorge. It brackets against my wet clothes, the cold cutting into my numbing flesh. Todd doesn’t even flinch.

A traitorous part of my mind mentions hyperthermia: the lack of shivering, the weakness, the confusion. 

Mimics never seemed to react to extreme temperatures, as if they’re unaffected by it.

“Max.” 

I meet his eyes. 

“Please,” he sobs. “I’m sorry. It’s me; you have to believe me. Please.” His eyes are wet. They look so *real* and I *don’t know what to do*—

I can’t know if he’s real. I can’t know if this really is Todd until his jaw unhinges and he consumes me. Or until I bring him to Grandma’s ranch and it kills what’s left of my family.

The fear in its eyes looks real as my face hardens. 

“Max! Max, please, it’s me!”

I know what I have to do, but the tears won’t stop falling. It’s scrambling away, or trying to, its legs kicking against loose stones in its panic. It doesn’t even notice that it’s edging further into the shallows, the water coming up to pool over its stomach and thighs.

“Stop saying my name,” I say, voice flat.

I follow it, body numb, and sit across its stomach. My weight sinks its back to the floor. It sputters, coughing when little waves splash over its face.

“I won’t let you take what little I have left. I won’t let you hurt anyone else.” My hands fall on its shoulders and its face goes under the water when I rock my weight forward.

It thrashes almost immediately, its hands flying up to shove at my arms and its legs kicking in an attempt to buck me off. But its movements are sluggish and uncoordinated, still weak from being swept down the river. 

One particularly violent writhe nearly throws me forward, over its head. I plant the palm of my hand hard onto its face—over its nose and mouth—and bear down.

Todd’s eyes stare up at me from beneath the surface, wide and afraid. Rage floods through me. I grit my teeth. It's still wearing his face, even under the threat of death. 

*It’s not fair!* It took him from me and it’s making me look into his eyes.

I push harder, even as its panic ebbs and its hands fall to its sides. I keep holding it until it doesn’t move any longer. Its skin grows pale and brown eyes unfocus. 

Dying light paints my skin red.

I clench my eyes shut. I can’t watch this. I can’t watch the life bleed from his eyes.

I keep holding it until it stops moving altogether. I keep holding it until my hands are completely numb to the icy water. 

I will keep holding it until it stops looking like Todd. Until it shifts back. It has to shift back. If it doesn't, I—I can’t. I’m afraid to let go. 

*Please don’t look like my brother.*
