Hi, can you hear me? I’m sorry I have to whisper. We’re working on the Devil Gene and I do not trust the other scientist. Oh, introductions, sorry!

Hi, my name is Anne-Ray and I will be taking credit for discovering proof of the Devil Gene or you’ll see me back in rehab. Hahahah. I’m kidding…hopefully. Oh, uh, I’m not sure if this speech-to-text thing picks up laughter. But I am kidding. Not about the Devil Gene but about rehab. I can’t go back there. If I don’t get credit for my research I’m not making it back there.

Ha.

Ha.

Ha.

Sorry, I was trying to laugh to lighten the mood. I really hope this thing picks up laughter.

Sorry if you heard that. Someone’s trying to get into the documentation room. It wasn’t an official documentation room. We use an abandoned school so this is more of a storage closet.

“Just a minute! I’m making an audio journal entry!”

Okay, so I am Anne-Ray and I am a scientist, a legitimate scientist, not legitimate like I have a degree or tons of hours in an official lab but I-I-I have an innate curiosity for the world and I had the grades to go to a really good school -trust me I did! I swear- Emory University. No, it’s not an Ivy, they denied me, but Emory is like an Ivy school in the South. I didn’t go to Emory though. I… okay so there was this song. I’m sure you know it. It’s by Future. The chorus is something like Molly Percocet Molly Percocet.

I thought it sounded cool and so I tried um, Molly and Perks. So, I had a small Percocet addiction for a couple of years and spent my college and graduate school money from my parents on drugs and rehab and drugs and rehab. Yep, no one screwed their life over worse than me. Well, except maybe my fellow ‘researchers’ in this lab.

<heavy background obstruction>

“Sorry, I’ll be out in just a minute please!”

As I was saying, my fellow researchers have a surprising incompetence not only in science but in mere existence. And I know they don’t have doctorates, none of them or college degrees, and one might not have a high school degree because he (Paul) did not know what an atom was. And then Vanessa thought I was referring to Adam from the Bible and one kept wanting to talk about Black Adam (that movie with the Rock), and then Paul,the oldest guy (I don’t like him), kept saying; “Why are there so many black heroes? I don’t have a problem with it but why so many?”

<heavy background obstruction>

Shoot! Someone’s knocking hard and you don’t even know what the Devil Gene is. Stupid Anne-Ray. Need an Adderall Anne-Ray. They were right, Anne Ray. Stupid. Stupid. Stupid.

Ah, okay so we are doing experiments to find and isolate the Devil Gene. The Devil Gene is an evolutionary theory that simply states we are the dominant species because we are the cruelest. Our job is to find that in our DNA, and with the help of Dr. Dean Hartman, yesterday I did. It is the gene of both evil and ambition. Imagine the possibilities. Of course, it’s not actually a gene but something much more complex.  You can find the details in the paper I’ll publish but…

Oh, um okay so the recording room is like this converted storage closet that has a small window on the door so you can see outside of it. But I can’t see outside of the window now. The window is red. Like, uh, a bad paint job just a big splat. Nothing’s knocking anymore.

“Hello? Is someone at the door?”

No one’s saying anything. I am a woman of science. I should investigate. I should see what that red coating is. That is absolutely not blood. That’s too bizarre. Irrational. This is why I can come back from all my mistakes because I’m made to be a scientist. I have an innate scientific curiosity and logical thinking! Okay, walking forward now. Almost there.

Opening the door knob…and…and… it’s turning but it’s not opening. I press my shoulder into it and I’m reminded why I used to skip P.E. class. I wouldn’t call myself the strongest 5 ft 4 and 110-pound girl.

Hey, it’s budging a little but something’s blocking the door.

“Stop, it’s not funny!” Again, no one’s answering me. That’s fine, I don't need them. This isn’t my first time being shunned.

In middle school, I was shoved in a closet thinking I was going to play 7 minutes in heaven. In the closet, it was just me and a hamster that I was deftly afraid of.

In high school, ‘my friends’ locked me in the school lab overnight because I ruined the curve.

In the rehab center, (upon request of my former rehabees) I was shut in my room and blocked from attending group meetings because I was ‘annoying’.

So, I’m used to it now, and every time I can get past it.

“Ow!!!”

Oh, wow what do you know I’m out.

Sorry about that. I am free but I appear to have slipped in this strange substance that is not blood but I will indeed be analyzing further.

This liquid might be the result of faulty plumbing; it's dripping from above me.

O-o-o-o-o-o-o- excu-excuse my stuttering please. I-i-i-i- am trying to compose myself to narrate this to you. It, uh, it, uh, has become v-v-v-vitally- oh my God I’m crying- more important. B-b-because this might serve as my final act in life. And I shall end it like a scientist. Please, bear with me through the tears.

I will not grant myself the high of terror. I spent too much of my life high. I will go into death sober.

It is indeed blood and there is a dead body above me. It was hung. The feet are still, the hands are bloodless and curling, and the body swings side to side like a scarecrow in the wind. Blood leaks from incisions on his stomach. Leaks not pours, that might be more important for future investigators. We have a lot of blood as people and if you have as many stab wounds as him it should be gushing out. I count twenty. It is Dr. Hartman. The cuts are large and hand-sized, and his organs are not intact. Why would you take a hanging man’s organs? I, uh, I guess that’s for you to investigate, huh? I don’t believe I’ll be leaving this spot.  Dr. Hartman’s ex-exe-executioner is still here.

<indescribable noise>

I’m sorry I’m crying. I will get this out to you. The executioner is here. They hold the rope that keeps the bloody body afloat. I believe they are one of my colleagues. They are in a red devil mask, lab coat, and khaki pants. In their black-gloved hand is the knife they used to gut Dr. Hartman. It still drips. It is approximately a 7-inch blade. They are taller than me, somewhere between 5’9 and 6’1. They have not moved yet. They only stare at me.

“I won’t run!” That’s me speaking to it. I can’t understand what it says back.

<indescribable noise>

They have dropped the body. It landed beside me with a thud and a splat. As stated, nothing solid spilled out. Again, why would you take the organs of a dead man?  I will not run. As I said I am a scientist so I will observe and record. I will try to find answers but if you find this recording it’s your turn. It’s clear he is going to try to kill me and I am cursed to be neither a lover nor a fighter. It’s up to you now.

“What is it? What do you want?”
