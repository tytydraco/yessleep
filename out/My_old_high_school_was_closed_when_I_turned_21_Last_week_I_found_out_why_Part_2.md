Kira and I had to lay low for a while after what happened at Greenridge High School a couple of [weeks ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/18x33l6/my_old_high_school_was_closed_when_i_turned_21/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). My left hand is completely unusable, luckily they were able to reattach it to my wrist. My shoulder is recovering, but it will be a while until I can use my left arm. 

We decided to take a few days to gather our thoughts and go over what we know. Kira filled me in on what she could remember, and I shared what I could remember. Together we were able to put some major pieces to this puzzle in place.   
  
Kira told me that she didn’t fully remember being murdered in the auditorium. Most of that day was a complete blur for her. She told me that she was on the stage to help set up for a school play. No one else was there yet, she had just left her science class.   
  
I asked her if she remembered the person in the mask, the one who lifted her and killed her. My first thought was maybe this was a bully or someone she bullied.   
  
She did remember the killer but told me that he felt too strong to be another student. He lifted her with ease and held her like she was made of paper. Kira told me that she clawed his wrist, but by the time he had his hand around her neck, she felt like she couldn’t move. She detailed how it felt to be strangled, and the pain that shot through her body when he slammed her to the stage.   
  
She had a scar on her nose where I saw the knife land. I asked her about it and she said she didn’t remember how she got it.   
  
Kira did not remember being stabbed in the face and I didn’t want to remind her.   
  
We talked on the couch for hours. I asked her if she noticed anything weird at school that day and she told me she didn’t. What stood out to me was that she didn’t remember the murders happening. At this point, in our conversation, I made a note to get the names of all of the victims and if I could the survivors too, maybe I could pinpoint the exact date she was murdered.   
  
“Why did you grab me?” Kira eventually asked me. She had been crying for hours, I was surprised she still wanted to talk.   
  
I told her that I had watched her die and felt compelled to do something to try and help her. I confessed that I wasn’t sure I would be able to grab her arm but once I realized I could I knew I had to do everything possible to keep her from going back to the stage.   
  
Someone commented last time about how I “took Kira from death.” I couldn’t agree more. Somehow I was able to reach into wherever she was and pull her out.   
  
Finally, I asked her about the ax-wielding man who tried to kill us. She told me that was the first time she had ever seen that person. We both agreed we didn’t want to meet him again.   
  
That night, I took out an old notebook and decided to write some things down. I knew for sure I would be going back to Greenridge High School, it was only a matter of time before the headaches came back.   
  
For the moment I am calling the two murders, Red Face and Mascot Killer. I know the names suck but whatever. I noted that Mascot Killer was found at the top of the stairs, Kira told me he never came downstairs to chase us.   
  
Red Face never left the auditorium so we assume that is where he will always be found. I know it’s a big stretch to say they will never leave where we've seen them but if Red Face wanted Kira so badly I felt like he would’ve come after her anyway.   
  
After taking my notes, I went to sleep. We spent the next few days staying inside and away from the windows. I had to assume that people thought Kira was dead, so seeing her walking around would raise a lot of red flags.   
  
**Return to Greenridge**  
  
“You’re going back?” Kira snapped at me as she watched me pack a small backpack.   
  
“Yes, I have to go back,” I told her seriously as I put my flashlight under my good arm. I was wondering if I would see the groundskeeper again, in the back of my mind I felt like he knew what was going to happen when I walked into the school.   
  
“You only have one arm.” Kira pointed out as she followed me around the house.   
  
“I know.” I sighed before placing some money on the counter.   
  
“That’s for food. But, only order food as a last resort, we still have leftovers.” I opened the fridge to double-check and make sure there was enough food for her to heat up if she got hungry.   
  
“Let me help you.” Kira pleaded with me.   
  
“No. If we are seen by anyone they will have a lot of questions. Plus, I’m not putting you in the crosshairs of a bunch of murderers.” I said seriously. I took my car keys from the table and stopped at the front door.   
  
“If I don’t come back, dye your hair or something and get out of here,” I told Kira before opening the front door and heading out to my car. I waited on the steps to make sure she locked the door.   
  
The last time I made this drive, everything was foggy. I was in a lot of pain and it felt like everything around me was only getting worse. This time, despite feeling waves of uncertainty pouring over my body, I felt clear. I felt like for the first time in a long time I knew exactly what I was supposed to do, at least as far as going back to school was concerned.   
  
As I pulled up to Greenridge High School I scanned the area for the groundskeeper. I was surprised he wasn’t sitting in the same spot he always was.   
  
I parked my car and walked up to the building. I probably should’ve at least taken Kira with me to be the getaway driver in case I got injured again.   
  
“Back so soon?” The groundskeeper asked me.   
  
I nearly jumped out of my skin when I heard his voice. I turned around and sure enough there he was, holding his rake and wearing the same clothes he was wearing the last time I saw him.   
  
“Are you trying to give me a heart attack?” I gasped. I didn’t hear him coming up behind me.   
  
He only laughed and walked back to the grass to continue working. I watched him for a second before moving my flashlight to try and open the door. I eventually got it but I really should’ve taken Kira with me.   
  
Walking back into the school was like walking through a thick fog. It felt like I had to force myself through the doorway.   
  
I turned my head to see if the ax mark was still in the door and sure enough, it was. My blood was still on the floor too, I was attacked in here. This time my head felt incredibly clear in the building, it was a weird feeling. To know exactly where I needed to be.   
  
I was not going to go to the second floor with one hand, so I decided to continue on the first floor. I had my choice of the lunch room or the gym, and I went with the gym. As I walked towards the gym, I took a second to look around me. There was no sign of Mascot Killer or Red Face.   
  
The gym was down a hallway, like the lunchroom. The locker rooms were divided by the office for the coach. As I walked down the hallway, I heard rustling coming from the girl's locker room. Eventually, that rustling turned into screaming, at first I didn’t want to open the door.   
  
When the second scream interrupted the silence I ripped the door open. The locker room was an absolute mess, blood painted the walls but it was very old.   
“Get away from me!” I heard a girl scream. I ran through the room before finding the girl. I couldn’t believe my eyes.   
  
The girl was wearing a gym uniform. Unlike Kira, her outline was green. She was still see-through though. The man standing before her looked like a giant in comparison. He was wearing the school's hockey uniform and a hockey mask.   
  
I reached out to see if I could reach the girl before she was murdered. She ran backward though, placed her foot on the wall, and boosted herself up to the window. I watched her climb out. She wasn’t killed.   
  
I didn’t have too much time to think about it because the killer turned his attention to me. He was see-through for a second. I watched as his skin slowly appeared, in a matter of seconds he was becoming whole.   
  
I turned as quickly as possible, nearly tripping on clothes, and ran back down the hallway as fast as I could. I was running away from the gym and this killer was following me. I heard his hockey stick hit the wall when he tried to swing at my back. The moment I was out of the hallway the killer stopped following me. He was standing there at the end of the hallway, watching me.   
  
He wasn’t as big as I thought he was, he was probably about 6’4 or 6’5. He had massive shoulders though, his clothing was caked in dry blood. As he stood there watching me I couldn’t help but wonder, who did he kill? It looked like he was guarding the hallway so I decided to back up and head to the lunchroom instead.   
  
I clenched the flashlight tightly, fully expecting something to come running at me the moment I opened the lunchroom doors. I had to push on these doors hard, something was blocking the doors. I was eventually able to get one of the doors open with my good shoulder. I could hear the table scraping the floor as I pushed the door open.   
  
The room was an absolute disaster, someone was clearly trying to barricade the doors shut. The tables were set up in a way to keep the doors pinned. From across from where I was standing I could see the same setup on the other side of the room.   
  
As I walked further into the lunchroom I called, “Is anyone in here? I’m not here to hurt you.”   
  
I stopped walking for a second to wait for an answer. When I didn’t get one I continued to explore the room. I almost gave up before I noticed one of the tables that was still right-side up had a book sitting on it.   
  
I walked over and put my flashlight in my mouth and brought the book closer to me. It was a school yearbook! But something was wrong with it. It was a white book with our mascot on it. Nothing about it looked special, and there was no year. I was going to look through it but I heard the door creak open behind me, I forgot to put the tables back where I found them.   
  
I quickly put the book in my backpack and took the flashlight in my good hand. The moment I got light on the door, something slammed into my leg with enough force to bring me to my knees. I looked down, large glass shards were sticking out of my skin.   
  
I looked up to see where the attack came from and that's when I saw her. She was wearing a long white coat, and large circular glasses that I hadn’t seen anyone wearing in a long time. She had a tall glass in her hand. She must’ve thrown one at me.   
  
I quickly forced myself up and went for an exit before remembering that all of the doors, except the one I came in from, I had to run around her to get out.   
  
As I ran towards the woman, I tried to sidestep her. She slammed the glass into my back and I stumbled forward. I thought she would be weaponless now, but as I turned around to see if she was chasing me, I watched a new glass cup start to take shape in her hand.   
  
I took two steps back and ran for the door, I managed to use my foot to push it open fully before being hit in the back again. Luckily, she was only throwing glass at me. It was something I knew I could walk off.   
  
I ran for the front door expecting Mascot Killer to be waiting at the top of the steps, but he wasn’t there. I could hear the women leaving the lunchroom. As I tucked the flashlight under my bad arm I ripped the front door open and practically threw myself outside.   
  
“See you soon!” The groundskeeper called to me as I ran to my truck. I jumped inside and pulled some glass out of my knee before driving [home](https://www.reddit.com/r/SpectralsMegaverse/).
