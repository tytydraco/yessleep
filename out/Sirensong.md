Hello there internet, my name is Iris Summers and I don’t know what to do. While looking through some things during a recent visit with my father, I came across this. It seems to be some sort of old diary entry of his. I knew he used to journal when I was little and my curiosity was piqued, so I decided to read through it. 

Now I’m regretting that decision.

***

Don’t you just hate it when you’re woken up from a deep sleep but have no idea why? This is exactly how I felt as I laid on my back, conscious but eyes closed. I had been irritated, knowing that this would be one of the last peaceful nights of sleep I’d get after bringing home my precious newborn daughter. But something had me on edge, what exactly? I didn't know at the time, but it felt *wrong.*

 My instincts told me to keep my eyes closed, so that’s what I did, straining my ears and listening for what had woken me up. All I heard were the light inhales and exhales of my girlfriend lying next to me. Wait… the sound wasn’t coming from beside me on his bed, no, it was coming from my upper left. 

I was confused, why would my body be on such high alert when it was just my girlfriend, the love of my life, moving around the bed? Well, I’d soon find that out.

Two small, yet incredibly strong, hands suddenly found themselves wrapped around my neck, causing my eyes to shoot open wide in shock. My girlfriend was straddled on top of me, slowly choking the life out of me. The air supply in my lungs tapered and my chest began to burn tightly. Fight or flight kicked in as I began to kick and scratch at my attacker in an attempt to free my windpipe. 

“W-why?” I managed to raspily choke out, changing my defense plan, blindly and frantically searching the nightstand for everything and anything that would cease the sudden attack. My heart sank when my girlfriend did nothing but squeeze harder- a wicked and sly smile slid onto her face. 

Now seeing stars, I finally got my hand around the glass of water I’d always leave on the nightstand at night. With my freehand and all the force I could muster into my increasingly weakening muscles, I swung and smashed the large glass around my girlfriend's left temple. 

She screamed as the jagged broken pieces of glass sliced her skin open, the stale water mixing with the blood that dripped down her cheek. She released her deathly grip off of me. After gasping in the sweet air my body so desperately craved, I quickly pushed her off. Her body smashed into the wall and she let out another gasp of pain. Cries started to escape from the baby’s crib across the room. 

She brought a hand to her temple and then looked at the other. When she realized what she’d been hit with, she said to herself softly, ”No, No, *NO!* You idiot!”

I had just haphazardly shoved my wallet and car keys into a pocket in my pajama pants. The next thing on my list was to get my daughter away from this psycho, but then I stepped back in horror after staring into my girlfriend's bright green unnaturally glowing eyes. All I saw in them was a deep hunger. *Insatiable.*

Right before my eyes, my girlfriend's shorts and underwear tore into pieces as her legs fused and morphed together into a long, slimy, dark grey fishtail. The baby started to cry even harder once the demented form started crawling towards me and my infant's crib. I drank my ex-girlfriend's new monstrous features in; a maw full of sharp, dagger-like teeth, gross gills that rested on top of her collar bones showing through her wet tank-top, that tail, and the long black claws protruding out from where her fingernails used to be. 

That’s when I knew in my heart what she was, having read plenty of mythology of the very creature in front of me when younger and terribly bored. I was frightened and felt stupid for not seeing it before, for letting myself fall prey to this very dangerous predator.

“What about our baby!?” I shouted after narrowly dodging another attack when she lunged at Me. She’d gone head first into our once shared dresser instead. 

“I could care less,” she admitted honestly, picking herself up. My ex chuckled. “I think I’m going to eat her once I’ve finished picking your bones clean.” 

That’s when she said her first honest words in our entire relationship. “Truth be told, Xzavier, I had planned on killing you months ago, but fate had other plans. After finding out that I was pregnant for the first time, I decided to extend this long con even longer, just to see how everything would all playout. After spending these past nine months pregnant and giving birth to that newborn, I’ve decided that motherhood just isn’t for me. There isn’t an ounce of love for this child in my heart.” She then let out a shrill laugh, “You want to know what the best part of my day was? Going over all the different ways I could kill you and baby the baby!”

A bout of dizziness overcame me as my heart broke in disgust. We needed to get out of there. I quickly grabbed my crying daughter out of her crib and strapped the emergency pre-packed diaper bag over my shoulder. I jumped onto the king sized bed to avoid being directly in the creature’s path. In a last ditch effort to have some protection against the monster laying on his floor, knowing she wouldn’t let her meal escape that easily, I grabbed the lamp that resided on the nightstand 

 “Don’t follow us,” I instructed menacingly, pointing the heavy base of the lamp at the creature. I hopped back onto the floor, turning to leave his hungry-for-bloodlust ex-girlfriend once and for all- baby in hand- when a sharp pain on my right calf caused me to stumble. Reacting quickly, I managed to twist my body in a way where the baby would not be harmed in the fall. I’d taken a quick glance at my aching leg, finding four deep, bleeding, gashes. The adrenaline and shock in my system numbed the pain enough for me to continue inching towards the door, hand outstretched towards freedom. I shouldn’t have, but I looked back to my irate ex-girlfriend- who had my blood dripping down her black claws. She was crawling ever so closer to me and my daughter. 

The only thing I could think to do was tighten my grip around the heavy metallic lamp, hurriedly  striking her in the head yet again, but with the adrenaline and fatherly love coursing through me, it was a much stronger blow than earlier. A loud *thunk* sounded out as the metal made contact with her skull. Taking advantage of slowing down my ex, I swiftly got back on my feet- keeping the baby protected the whole time- and made a run for the door. 

I froze in my tracks, hand on the doorknob and all, when I heard the mother of my child say in a deeply alluring voice, ”I’ll find her one day, and you as well. When I do, I *promise* you…  I’ll enjoy killing the two of you with my own bare hands.” 

I shook her hooks out of my brain, saying nothing. It was then or never. If she tried to bewitch me again, I feared I wouldn’t be able to fight it off. I left the bedroom without looking back for the last time, holding my daughter tightly in my arms- vowing to always keep her safe. No matter what.

So, this is clearly a work of fiction, right? It’s written more like a story than a journal/diary entry. Definitely my dad’s handwriting though, but the man is as serious as a heart attack. Not a funny bone in sight. So this has to be something else, it has to be. I mean, sirens? That’s the kind of creature he wrote about isn’t it? They’re *not* real.

However, the pages in the notebook are yellow and weathered, so they could certainly be twenty seven years old. And my mom’s never really been involved in my life. And the thing that’s really getting me is, this entry or whatever was dated three days after I was born.

Hypothetically, if this is true and that’s my mother, then what would that make me? A monster like her?
