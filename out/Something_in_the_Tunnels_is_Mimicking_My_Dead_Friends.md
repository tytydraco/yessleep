“Charlie? Come over here to us!” Liam calls, voice thin with desperation.

“We found Claudia! She’s here with us! Jack and Katie are nearby too!” Andy calls, a bright edge to his words.

“If that’s true…why don’t you come over here…to me,” I scream into the black.

Liam and Andy went missing while we were searching for Claudia in the forest.

I suspect every friend who vanished was ritually sacrificed by the cult that haunts Cannock Chase.

I’ve been trapped in this tunnel for days with a small fireteam of mercenaries. Their guns point into the darkness.

“It’s been days now, kid. I’d open fire if anything showed up on night vision or thermals. There’s nothing.” Milo whispers.

“It’s been *DAYS*! I’m not going to starve in this damned hole. I’m going to ice them all right now,” a trooper snaps.

“Do not approach them. That’s an order!” Milo hisses.

*Bang.*

A trooper fires into the dark and starts to move away from the group.

“God damn it, man! We cannot split up. Alright—men, we’re moving deeper into the tunnel,” Milo shouts.

We creep forward as a unit.

*laughter*

It comes louder.

“You shot me!” Liam screams.

“Charlie…it’s us! Why would you do that? Please don’t shoot!” Andy cries.

The thing mimicking them doesn’t notice its fatal mistake: Andy isn’t British like the rest of us — he’s Irish, and he always said “that” like “dat.”

Then we see him.

Liam stands alone. No Andy, no one else.

He’s naked, smeared with dirt and blood. Thin, pallid. A thick metallic collar clamps his neck. Hair is gone from his head, body, even his eyebrows. The whites of his eyes are replaced by an almost glowing black.

*bang.*

A trooper fires at Liam’s chest. Liam doesn’t flinch.

The rest of the team joins in until his body slumps to the tunnel floor.

The collar comes away in a spray of sparks and metal.

Liam’s face — the one we shot — peels off his skull like a mask.

Beneath it is Claudia.

Despite fifty rounds, the thing — whatever it is — convulses back to motion. It screams and bolts deeper into the tunnel.

We chase after it.

*Liam’s dead. It was wearing his face.*

*That means…Claudia…no.*

The tunnel splits. The thing could go left or right.

The men divide into threes and fan out. I don’t even get to remind them not to split. I follow Milo. He’s the leader and the only one I trust.

The passage goes on and on. It feels eternal.

We come to a narrow gap where the tunnel opens into a cave. We crawl through one by one. I go second to last. I barely make it.

The trooper behind me starts to struggle mid-crawl.

“I’m stuck. Pull me out, lads,” he says, calm in that ex-SAS way.

We pull him by the arms. He screams. His gut is torn open, bleeding everywhere.

“Looks like I’m brown bread, boys. Leave me a grenade and a handgun, will ya,” the trapped soldier says politely.

Milo hesitates. We all stand there, stunned.

“John, you were always the brave one. I’m not going to leave you to be butchered by those lunatics,” Milo says, solemn.

He stabs John in the neck. John whimpers for a few seconds and goes quiet.

We turned our backs to John’s body and faced the dark.
Our flashlights cut through the black, beams trembling over jagged stone. 

The cave was massive. It was as tall and wide as a cathedral, its walls crooked and raw like something carved by claws, not tools.

And then we saw them.

In the pale reach of our lights stood fifty cloaked figures, perfectly still, watching us.

Two stepped forward and pulled back their hoods.

It was Jack and Katie — my friends who vanished that day. They were grinning.

“Thank you for bringing more to us, Charlie,” Katie said, her smile too wide, too calm. 

“The forest god… Leshy… is very pleased with your work.” Jack taunted.
