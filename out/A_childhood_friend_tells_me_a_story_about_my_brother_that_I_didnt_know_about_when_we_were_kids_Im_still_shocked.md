I'm not going to lie, I've been avoiding the action of sitting down and making this post, but the truth is that I don't know how to handle what an old friend told me recently. Before you tell me "this is not the place" or "go to therapy", I tell you that I already do and I think that sharing, even anonymously, what happened is part of that process.

***In 2001 nobody ate grilled pork***

This was in October 2023, In Montevideo, Uruguay, I remember it was Thursday eve of a holiday, and the damp corner in Downtown that I have for an apartment expels me to get some air, so around 10 pm I go down Aquiles Lanza street to a quiet bar, I sit outside, with my back to the few people in the bar, I take out my notebook and pen with a bitten cover and order the cheapest beer. Needless to say, I don't want to interact with anyone today, I barely look the waitress in the eye, and immerse myself in planning my latest submission to the course i am taking. Journalism, yes I know, how someone who studies that can write so badly, but it's the third career I'm starting, and it's going to be my last, for better or worse.

* "(...)The event worthy of investigation today, is not the same as it was 15 years ago."

I read quietly in the notes when I feel some footsteps approaching,

* Mauro? - I am asked.
* I look up and notice a person I don't recognize, my brow furrows in a clear memorized effort to identify him, since he looks somehow familiar, I just don't know who may be.
* You and your brother. "The Paraguas", right? from the red apartment complex?

That's it, only someone who knew me between the ages of 7 and 10 would tell us by that nickname, so it's clearly from the neighborhood where I spent my childhood. We moved there right after returning from living in Paraguay for a while. We had a little bit of an accent left and they gave us that nickname.

* Aaah what\`s up men? - I say with false surprise since I have no fucking clue who he is.
* You haven't recognized me yet, have you? - he says with a chuckle, standing at the side of the table.
* I´m… No, sorry - I say relieved.
* It's just that I'm a little older than you and I moved in shortly after you two arrived to the housing complex. I'm Matias, ring a bell? How are you? It's your brother doing well?

When he told me that name I could see through his aged face the teenager who played soccer in the hood, with long hair and a nineties headband, wearing the satin and worn-out jersey of the Uruguayan national team, with a big "FRANCESCOLI" printed on the back.

* El Mati! - I exclaimed at length, showing that now I did remember him.

Mati was no saint, he was a brute and bordered on bullying type of child but at that time he was called "derecho de piso", later he calmed down and became quite protective of me and my brother, although he always got along better with him.

* Are you alone? - he asked me.
* Yes, I came to clear my head, I'm up to my hands with a delivery next week...
* good! And what are you studying? he asked , sitting down.

I guess nothing now… I snorted inwardly.

* Journalism - I answered him by filling my glass and closing my notebook.

Matias was dressed in a white shirt without a tie with the first and second buttons detached in clear allusion to an after office that got out of hand, he had an office identification of those office guys style, pinned to his pants. I remember he was about 5 years older than me, so he must have been around 35, with short, gray hair and a big receding hairline. He became a big guy, his face swollen and a little red from the cold and the booze.

* But look how big you are, it's nuts!," he exclaimed as if he recalled the tall, scrawny 7-year-old boy running after the ball a long time ago.
* You've grown a beard and everything," he joked, shaking his tall glass of freshly poured double whiskey.
* Yeah, don't tell me about it, I'm an old man now," I joked too.

The conversation was flowing, catching us up mostly on what our acquaintances were up to at the time, most of whom we had no idea. We knew that Diego lives on the beach and is into holistic spiritual shits and Tamara is still in the neighborhood, married for several years. We lost track of the others, some of them were in jail and more than one of them emigrated.

* Remember when we used to play "ring pum pan"? what fucking assholes we were, it wasn't enough to ring the doorbell and run, we had to scare the neighbor to death by banging and kicking the door", he laughed and let out a snort of innocent nostalgia.
* We were terrible kids!, remember when we used to climb the wall that closed the soccer field of the neighborhood team? I think I had more fun climbing up and down than watching the games for free - I also remembered with real nostalgia.

I was finishing my second beer, Matias had his second whiskey, since he sat down, and the dizziness was already starting to be evident.

* Do you remember that in your staircase lived an old Galician woman, blonde and white as paper, always with impeccable make-up, she wore nightgowns and slippers all the time.
* Yesss!- I answer.
* The "few hairs woman"- I say with enthusiasm and continue.
* She was very Catholic, and we managed to sneak to the front of her apartment and leave black and red candles on her door. She would come out screaming that she was going to call her son to beat us up. The level of mischief we were dealing with was strong.- I chuckle.
* She really targeted my brother for all those jokes, she said he was "the devil" - I said in a low, mocking voice.

Matias nodded validating the shared memory, but he didn't laugh, instead he stared into the void for a few seconds, looked at me and opened his mouth as if to ask me something but instead he let out a slow exhale and leaned back in his chair.

Then he continued.

* You weren't there when we found your brother at Christmas, were you," he said as he took a long sip of watered down whiskey.
* Christmas? are you sure? wasn't it Bruno, who was about the same age?
* No," he said curtly.
* Your brother, Estevan, went missing around 10 p.m. on December 24, 2001," he said accurately.
* That's true! He was 5 years old, we went out to look for him and he appeared behind the community hall after 10 minutes, he had gone to see some fireworks.
* 10 minutes? It was 2 hours! and he appeared there, but he wasn't always there, because we went out with Diego and Tamara to look for him all over that area, along the wall, we jumped on the field, we climbed the little hill. Your parents were terrified, you really… don't remember?- he asked me, surprised.

I looked at him surprised... and straining to bring up more details from my memory I said.

* I remember that we lost sight of him for a moment, then we went out to shout his name around the B complex and he appeared running and crying. My old man shouted at him in anger and my mom hugged him in tears. After that, I have no more memories of that episode.

Matias crossed his arms, leaned back in his chair and looked at me for a moment. The cars passed less and less by the corner of Soriano Street, and the rain fell softly and constantly. Little by little we were the last table in the bar, I guess I just noticed these details because the atmosphere between Matias and I began to thicken. This was not another light and amusing anecdote of our childhood, his gaze was trapped in the memory, the look that seemed to be seeing through things, gradually a gesture was fixed on his face, of sadness and hardness, while he slightly rotated the glass with his fingers.

* Of course. - he said at last, like waking up from a revelation thought.
* Your parents must have never told you, and I doubt your brother remembers, since he was never able to tell clearly about what he saw that night.
* What are you talking about? I asked him seriously.
* Do you remember Silvana? We used to call her "La enfermita". She lived in a very deteriorated house made of sheet metal and wood, past the little hill behind the community hall with her father and 2 sisters. She had a very severe physical and mental disability.
* Severe? -I interrupted him, opening my eyes wide.

She had deformities that I never saw again in anyone, the huge hump on the right side of her back, the contoured body, while walking like a trot, the arm bent and glued to the chest, the exaggeratedly large head, with long black hair, the forehead divided into two balls, the spaced eyes, the non-existent nose, always dressed in the same ragged clothes, my child consumer mind of horror movies could only get scared, I would always run away when i knew she was near.

* I even remember rocks being thrown at her.
* Yes, well, we were children, poorly educated and no one ever explained much to us, we didn't talk about it, anyway; It seemed that they only let her out at night to run through the housing complex, during the day they kept her inside a metal shed, with Diego we would go to explore her back yard and we would hear her squawking and the sound of chains, she couldn't have been more than 15 years old, but she behaved like a 5 year old, she played with bugs in the dirt and sometimes we could hear in the silence of the early morning her guttural cries echoing among the buildings, her father would beat the shit of her and shout all kinds of insults to make her be quiet, she was kept like an animal, among the dogs and... - he interrupted himself.
* I don't know if I want to talk about this anymore,- My old friend said and took a big sip of whiskey.

Clearly all this was starting to stir up disturbing things that made Matias increasingly uncomfortable.

* Are you going to leave me with that curiosity? What does that poor gurisa have to do with my brother's disappearance?
* That poor girl had a shitty family, and my old man used to beat the shit out of me for any stupid thing, but what her father did to that poor girl was much worse. The whole neighborhood knew about it, the neighbors, her sisters, nobody ever reported it, and that's why it ended up that way...

Matias paused, closed his eyes, took a long, shaky breath and finished the watery whiskey. He slowly put the empty glass on the table and looked at me gravely.

* When we found your brother he was in shock, he told us that "la enfermita" invited him to her house and when he entered the house the lights were off and she said to him holding a piece of meat and laughing, "do you want some grilled pork?, Do you want some grilled pork?” again and again. Then he got scared and ran out to where we found him. Between the bushes we could hear macabre and mocking laughter, clearly from her, we ran out in terror to the courtyard between the apartments and when we finally got away, we started walking nervously to your house, your brother, still had a piece of meat in his hand, but it looked raw and bloody, we hit him on the hand to get him to let go and we took him to your parents.

I listened in disbelief as I had been totally oblivious to this story, and really under any other circumstances I would have thought he was lying to me, but the severity of the story, how he could barely make eye contact as he told me this, convinced me he was telling the truth.

* We went weeks without hearing from the sick and disturbed girl after that. when we returned to the back yard, the house was completely boarded up and abandoned, they had fenced all over the property with barbed wire. My mother told me that they had inherited a house in the city of Tacuarembó from a distant aunt. Tamara was told that they managed to put her in a special hospital, and that they moved closer to there, but, nothing is certain.

Matias stood up suddenly and made the universal gesture of bringing me the bill to the waitress, put on his jacket and with an honest smile opened his arms in a gesture of embrace.

* Mauro, it's a pleasure to see you again, send another tight hug to your brother.

Seeing that my face still reflected confusion and surprise for the story, he told me.

* Leave me your contact, I'm going to talk to Diego and Tamara these days and I'll write to you, so we can get together for a drink, let Estevan know too, I haven't seen him for a long time.

I scribbled my number on a piece of paper and handed it to him, he looked at the paper and said goodbye. He walked a few steps and stopped, turned around and said to me.

* I don't think it was grilled pork.
