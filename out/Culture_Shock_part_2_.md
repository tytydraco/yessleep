Part one is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/1GshIQpVZ6)



The first transformation is the worst. No one tells you about the pain – the way your spine splinters like glass, the feeling of your organs rearranging themselves, the burning pressure as wings tear through muscle and skin. I screamed until my throat was raw, thrashing in the banana grove while Susannah and her family watched with ancient, patient eyes.

"Fight through it," Susannah whispered, her clawed hands cool against my fevered skin. "The more you resist, the more it hurts."

But how do you not resist when your body is literally tearing itself in half?

The change came in waves. Sometimes I'd feel almost normal, able to eat regular food and walk in sunlight, though the smell of human sweat made my mouth water in unsettling ways. Other times, usually as dusk approached, my skin would begin to split and that terrible hunger would rise. More than once, I woke to find myself half-transformed, wings partially emerged, my lower body still human while my torso tried to separate.

"It's like puberty," Elena explained over a breakfast of something I tried not to identify. "Your body is learning a new way to be. The change will smooth out eventually."

But it wasn't just my body that was changing. My memories felt strange, as if I were watching someone else's life through clouded glass. I remembered my parents, my job back in the States, but they seemed less real than the sharp scent of fear, the sound of a heartbeat through walls, the way moonlight painted potential prey in silver.

I might have lost myself completely if not for the old woman in the market.

I was buying mangoes, trying to pretend I was still the kind of creature that enjoyed fruit, when she grabbed my wrist. Her grip was iron-strong despite her age, her cloudy eyes fixed on my face. An albularyo – a traditional healer – I would later learn.

"I smell their poison in your blood," she said in Tagalog, which I somehow understood despite never learning the language. "But you're not fully turned yet. There's still time."

I tried to pull away, but she held fast. "I don't know what you're talking about."

"The aswang have marked you, but their claim isn't complete." She pressed a small pouch into my palm. It smelled of ginger and something metallic. "Boil this with holy water under a full moon. Drink it before your heart forgets how to beat in daylight. But be careful – they'll know if you try to turn back. They always know."

I stuffed the pouch in my pocket, but her words haunted me. That night, during what Susannah's family called my "training," I watched them hunt. They moved like shadows through the village, selecting their prey with careful deliberation. Always travelers, they explained. Never locals – that would draw too much attention.

"We're not monsters," Susannah insisted, her beautiful face transformed in moonlight. "We take only what we need. We give the villages protection in return. Why do you think no criminals dare come here? No corrupt politicians? No one who would harm the innocent?"

I wanted to believe her. Parts of me – the new, hungry parts – did believe her. But then I saw the fear in our victims' eyes, heard their prayers cut short, and remembered being human.

The pouch from the albularyo burned in my dresser drawer like a secret sin. Each night, as I learned to hunt, to fly with still-clumsy wings, to silence my human conscience, its presence taunted me. A way back. A way out. If I could trust the healer. If I could bring myself to leave Susannah.

"You're distracted," Susannah said one night as we perched on a church roof, our lower halves hidden safely at home. "Your thoughts smell like doubt."

"Just struggling with the transformation," I lied, though not entirely. My wings still emerged crooked sometimes, and I couldn't maintain the split for more than a few hours. "It's a lot to adjust to."

She stroked my face with clawed fingers, surprisingly gentle. "I know it's hard. I was born to this, but choosing it... that takes a special kind of courage. Or love."

Below us, the village slept. A dog barked in the distance, sensing our presence. The night air carried scents of cooking fires, jasmine, and human life. My new senses painted the world in incredible detail – heartbeats like drums, emotions like colors in the dark, life itself a symphony of smell and sound and motion.

"Do you ever regret what you are?" I asked.

"Do humans regret being human?" She tilted her head, her eyes reflecting moonlight. "We are what we are. The only choice is whether to embrace it or fight it forever."

But later that night, as I watched her feed, I wasn't so sure. The victim – a young backpacker who'd strayed too far from the tourist areas – died quickly at least. Susannah's family was efficient, practiced. They shared the meat with me, a ritual of acceptance, of family. The taste made my new form sing with pleasure while my human mind recoiled.

The next morning, I found a newspaper article about missing persons in the region. Dozens over the years, most written off as accidents, runaways, or victims of human trafficking. I recognized some of the faces. They haunted my dreams, both sleeping and waking.

"Looking for someone?" 

I jumped at Elena's voice. She stood in the doorway, her elegant features unreadable. 

"Just reading," I said, closing the newspaper.

"Hmm." She glided closer, and I caught the sharp scent of ginger. My heart stuttered. She knew. "You know, James, not everyone is suited for family life. Sometimes marriage... changes people."

The threat was velvet-soft but unmistakable. I thought of the pouch in my drawer, the full moon approaching. Thought of Susannah's love, her family's acceptance, the intoxicating power of what I was becoming. Thought of the faces in the newspaper, of the albularyo's warning.

"I love Susannah," I said. It wasn't a lie.

"Love isn't always enough." Elena's smile showed too many teeth. "But blood... blood is forever."

That night, as I lay in bed listening to wing-beats outside my window, I fingered the pouch of herbs. The full moon was tomorrow. Time to choose – humanity or Susannah, conscience or power, my old life or this dark new world of hunter and prey.

My back ached, wings pressing against skin that wanted to split. The hunger was rising with the moon. Soon, very soon, the change would become permanent, irreversible. The albularyo had promised me a way back, but at what cost? And could I trust her medicine more than Susannah's love?

Outside, a hunting cry pierced the night – Susannah calling me to join the family feast. My body responded instinctively, skin beginning to tear, wings unfurling. The pouch fell from my trembling fingers as the transformation took hold.

Just one more night, I told myself. One more hunt. Then I'd decide.

But as I rose into the star-strewn sky, my inhuman heart pounding with the thrill of the hunt, I wondered if I was only lying to myself. If perhaps the real transformation wasn't the physical change at all, but the slow erosion of everything I once believed about right and wrong, love and murder, monster and man.

Susannah wheeled overhead, beautiful and terrible, reaching for me with clawed hands. Below, the village slept uneasily, full of potential prey. And somewhere, an old woman's herbs waited with the promise of redemption or damnation.

Dawn would come soon enough. Until then, I spread my wings wider and tried not to think about tomorrow's choice. The night was deep, the hunger was rising, and somewhere in the darkness, my humanity was screaming for me to remember who I used to be.

Whether I would listen remained to be seen.
