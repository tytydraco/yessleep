POST #1 — WORKING THEORY

Date: March 3

Status: Public

Creepypastas are described as just stories.

Not false.

Not disproven.

Just stories.

That phrasing feels intentional.

Stories are meant to be read and left behind. Not revisited. Not verified. Fiction is a boundary — one people are trained not to cross.

I don’t think belief gives these things power.

I think attention finishes something that’s already started.

This blog exists to test that idea.

If this entry stops abruptly, it won’t be because the theory failed.

POST #4 — JEFF THE KILLER

Date: March 17

Status: Public

Jeff is everywhere. Overused. Mocked. Reduced to a joke.

That’s why I chose him first.

Older versions of the story listed an address. It doesn’t appear anymore. Not corrected — erased.

The house still exists.

It wasn’t abandoned. It was inactive. Like something waiting for the right input.

I saw him through a second-floor window. No movement. No sound.

He smiled before I realized what I was looking at.

I don’t think he intended to chase me.

I think he needed confirmation.

I left.

I wasn’t followed.

I didn’t sleep that night.

POST #5 — ADDENDUM

Date: March 19

Status: Edited

Mirrors are wrong.

My reflection doesn’t always blink when I do.

I keep catching it watching the room instead of me.

POST #7 — 1999 (LOCATION)

Date: April 2

Status: Public

Older uploads of 1999 included directions. Newer ones don’t.

I followed the archived version.

The building was supposed to be gone. It isn’t. No sign. No fence. Still standing in a neighborhood that’s been renovated twice since it closed.

The basement door was unlocked.

Inside felt preserved. Not clean — untouched. Like no one had been allowed to interfere.

I found a mural of children painted over in gray.

The paint is peeling.

The faces underneath aren’t finished.

I don’t remember watching the show.

I remember knowing when I was no longer welcome.

I don’t remember leaving.

POST #8 — TIME DISCREPANCY

Date: April 6

Status: Edited

I keep trying to calculate how long I was in the basement.

Every answer changes.

My phone says twelve minutes.

My body feels older than that.

POST #10 — THE SHOWERS

Date: April 20

Status: Public

I avoided this one.

The Showers aren’t a monster. They’re a place people don’t talk about. Somewhere memory resists.

The address led to farmland. No signs. Just a building with lights faintly on inside.

Inside, the hum of bulbs followed me. No office. No exit except the cellar.

The smell downstairs made my stomach turn before I could identify it.

The hallway was too long. Too narrow. Nails stuck out of the walls like they’d been driven from the inside.

The lights flickered.

I reached a red door. I knocked.

The bulb shattered.

Children stood behind me.

They didn’t move. They didn’t breathe. They didn’t need to.

Something deeper in the corridor made a sound that wasn’t meant for ears.

I ran.

A showerhead leaked something thick onto the floor. It touched my ankle and I gagged.

When I reached daylight, the building was dark.

I don’t remember the drive home.

I smell that place when I panic.

POST #11 — THE FARNSWORTH EXPERIMENT

Date: April 27

Status: Public

Farnsworth wasn’t summoning anything.

He was measuring what breaks first.

Exposure leads to missing time, incomplete memories, written material appearing finished.

Since researching it:

• I lose hours

• Drafts appear complete

• I reread posts I don’t remember writing

This blog is no longer reliable.

Neither am I.

POST #12 — SMILE DOG

Date: May 2

Status: Edited

I never searched for the image.

It appears anyway.

Thumbnails. Reflections. Corrupted previews.

I’ve sent links I don’t remember copying.

People stop responding after viewing them.

I think it wants witnesses.

I think it wants more.

POST #13 — THE RAKE

Date: May 8

Status: Public

The Rake is physical.

That should be comforting.

It follows me at night. Slowly. Patiently.

Like it understands I can’t function without sleep.

I’m afraid to stop moving.

⸻

POST #14 — REASSESSMENT

Date: May 14

Status: Heavily Edited

These stories aren’t warnings.

They’re records of containment failures.

Fiction kept them distant. Investigation reversed that.

I didn’t uncover them.

I made myself visible.

This blog isn’t protection.

It’s evidence.

POST #15 — FINAL

Date: Unknown

Status: Public

I don’t know how long I’ve been writing this.

They’re here. Not all in one place — everywhere. In reflections. In corners. In the pause between sounds.

I keep checking the locks. Nothing’s changed. Nothing will.

I can’t stop shaking. I can hear something breathing behind me but I don’t want to turn around.

If you’re reading this — please stop. Don’t follow this. Don’t think you’re safe because you haven’t seen anything yet.

That’s how it starts.

There’s a reflection in my screen that isn’t mine.

It’s smiling.

It’s closer than before.
