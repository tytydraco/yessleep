Another storm and another night of solitude Emmett didn’t mind. For a little over two decades, he served as a keeper of a lighthouse. Made a home within it and rarely left. It was a lonely job but suited him well because he had never cared for people. The pay was decent enough, though it mattered little; He had no use for material wealth. Far and few possessions and a simple life— as he believed God intended. He was the kind of man who was sharp as a blade, stubborn as a rock, and just egotistical enough to never apologize for any of it. 

But tonight felt different. An unsettling chill filled the air and left him slightly on edge, like those early mornings that just feel off. 

He tried to look through the fog with his binoculars but they weren’t much help. It was one of those shifts he had to be on high alert. He kept them held to his face, scanning his surroundings until he noticed a faint object in the water. It was a woman. 

Emmett rubbed his eyes, taken aback. Peering through once more, he couldn’t believe what he was seeing. A pale, naked woman, just floating there. The waters were rough and unpredictable but she was calm and content, and if it weren’t for the serene grin on her face, he would have thought her dead. 

“Impossible” his breath fogged the lenses and he quickly rushed to wipe them off. He wrestled the thoughts of what he should do, he had to help her, but how could he even be convinced this was real? And just as he began to second-guess the situation, her smile vanished. The woman’s face broke into an angry scowl, then she opened her mouth sickenly wide–unnaturally wide– as if she were screaming, before being ripped into the ocean. It looked like something had grabbed her waist and forced her under. The movement was too fast, too brutal, and too wrong. It wasn’t human. 
Emmett stumbled back, shaking his head, and muttered, 
“What the hell..?” 

He forced his gaze back on the area where the woman had previously been, trying to piece together what happened. For a while, he just stared at the dark, churning waves. Empty, demanding, and leaving him with no answer. What he saw couldn’t be real. He hadn’t been sleeping well and the fatigue had to be taking its toll. He lit a cigarette with a shakey hand and dismissed it as pure exhaustion. Part of him knew this was just to keep himself sane but trying to make sense of it wouldn’t benefit him either. 


The following weeks were uneventful, he followed his same routines and kept up with the lighthouse; although the image of what happened never left and weighed heavy on his mind. He swore he was going crazy.

Then, she appeared again– face down this time. Floating completely still, bobbing with the waves. Emmett scrambled for the phone, dialing for emergency services. His voice was tight with urgency, “There’s a body out there in the water... She’s floating by some rocks. I think she’s dead. You need to get someone out here. Now.”
The silence on the other end lasted far too long, broken only by the sound of clicking keys. “Sir please remain calm.” The operator's voice was steady and professional, the contrast making him feel like a fool. “Describe the situation to me”.
He went on to explain everything; the woman, the scene, the impossibility of it all. His voice was frantic as he pleaded for help. The operator assured him a report had been made, though her tone wasn’t much comfort.

A few days later an officer arrived at the door. With no introduction, he spoke, “Are you sure you saw something?” His voice was jarring and dismissive—like he had no time for Emmett’s story.

Emmett’s patience snapped, “Yes, I know what I saw. Do you mean to tell me y’all couldn’t find anything?” 

All he got was a blank stare, not a hint of concern in the man's eyes. The search yielded nothing, a complete dead end. 


Days bled into weeks, with no new sightings or news on the case. It was harder to shrug it off as plain fatigue and he began to question his mental state. 
Just as he started to fall into his normal routine, she returned. A scream sliced through the previously stormy silence. Emmett shot upright, his heart racing. He stared down at the shoreline with wide eyes. She stood there quiet and unnervingly still. A chilling smile on her face, almost as if she were mocking him. Her hair whipped in the wind, wet and clinging to her body. Despite the harsh weather, she remained a statue.
He yelled out to her, voice breaking and raw, knowing she couldn’t hear. “Who are you? What do you want?”

She didn’t answer, just stared back in what felt like awkward, uncomfortable silence. And then, with no warning, began to sprint toward the lighthouse. 

Startled, he bolted to lock the door, awaiting some painful interaction, not knowing if the wood would hold but he prayed it to be so. 

But the interaction never came. The woman was gone. It was once again completely silent as if nothing had happened. The rain tapping onto the tin of the building was the only comfort of sound he had.

He filed another report, doubting they would take him seriously, but he could always hope.


Quality sleep was like a distant memory, only slipping further from his grasp. The officer arrived a few days later, giving him the same news as before, another dead end. His words echoed repeatedly in his mind: “Sir, there’s no sign of anyone. We’ve thoroughly searched the area. Perhaps you could seek out mental care or some social interaction. I know your line of work can be isolating…” 

Emmett had scoffed at him, cursing under his breath, and slamming the door shut. They thought he was a madman, and even though he hated to admit it, they had every right to. The stories seemed impossible and no evidence was found. Hell, maybe he was going crazy. 
The sound of persistent banging interrupted his thoughts, he ran to the door, heart pounding against his ribs. He swung it open in a hurry, assuming there was some sort of emergency. Yet there was no one. 

A chill crept over him as he stared at the space, his frown deepening at the lone doormat. 

“Hello? Is anyone there?” His voice cracked, words unanswered. The silence was all he received in return. 


The next day, a food shipment was due to arrive. Reluctantly, Emmett knew he had no choice but to go get it. The thought of opening that door made his skin crawl but he was running low on supplies and already thinking of dinner. Quickly grabbing the box, he turned to set it down inside so he could shut the door. 
“Emmett…” a gurgled, death rattle of a voice whispered behind him. His heart sank and without thinking, he spun around, a breath caught in his throat. 
But there was no one there, just that untouched doormat and bitter silence; not a soul in sight.

He promptly forced the door shut, hands shakey as he locked the bolts. He muttered, “This job can kiss my ass”, his voice trembling and quiet. He dropped to his knees, panic consuming him. His mind raced and he repeatedly prayed to any god that could hear him, trying to cling to hope. That night, he ordered security cameras and loaded every firearm he owned.

Assuming it was over for a while, he tried to calm down. She showed up every few days, or weeks. Hopefully, it would be the latter. 

Yet, the banging resumed. This time, mixed with low, guttural sobs and agonizing screams that clawed at his sanity. 

“Stop it! Just stop!” he cried, his voice desperate “Who are you? What the fuck do you want?” 

Silence followed, so long that he dared to hope that she may have left. Feeling slight relief, he decided to check the peephole but was abruptly halted by her ripping screams, “You know who I am! You know!” Her voice lowered into whispers, so faint he couldn’t make out what she was saying. 

Emmett slammed his fists into the door, filled with fear and rage. “I don’t know you! Just leave! You aren’t welcome here!”
Once again, he is met with sickening silence. This time it felt heavier, more twisted, and suffocating; almost like a warning. 


Days later, the cameras finally arrived. He set them up and began to obsess over them. Watching the screens and neglecting the duty of the lighthouse. He would stay up until he succumbed to exhaustion, craving any bit of explanation for what was happening.

One night, as he dined on his dinner, a camera suddenly went out. His heart seized and panic arose in his throat like bile as he spat on the ground, cursing. The dreadful screaming was back. She wailed and sobbed like she was some feral animal in torment. So guttural it could scrape the very marrow off his bones.
“I told you to leave!” He roared, his whole body shaking.

She spoke, her voice fractured and too human, “I just want you to see me” She let out a choked cry, “Understand…” 

Anger bubbled up inside of him, “You ruined the damn camera! How am I supposed to see you now?” 

Quietly weeping, she beckoned “Come outside…” Her fingers hit the door in a wet slap.

“No.” Emmett refused. “Move to the other camera.” He ordered, his voice strained. 
There was silence, and then horror as she unsteadily swayed within view. Her body was discolored and bloated yet still somehow frail. She was wrinkled, sagging, and caked in dry mud. Her face was gaunt and a frothy discharge bubbled from her lips.

“Oh... Oh god…” he stammered, his stomach churning. He fell to his knees and vomited, his body riddled with horror.
She stumbled off of the camera and her voice arose at the door once more, venomous and bitter “You know who I am” she hissed. “You know what you did!” 
Emmett jolted to his feet, pressing his palms against the door as if he was holding her back. “I don’t know who you are!” He protested, his confusion spiraling into rage.

“Admit it! Admit what you did” Her words pierced the air like glass. 

“I don’t know what you’re talking about!” He screamed.

An angry shriek came from her that sounded almost animalistic, and she began to slam her body into the door, demanding repeatedly that he say who she was. This went on for an uncomfortably long time, then there was silence.

A final coughing gurgled sentence came from her, her voice low “You’re the reason I’m dead”.

Emmett erupted in anger, yelling how she was wrong and he didn’t know her. She interrupted him in what sounded almost as a growl “Are you so heartless that I mean nothing to you? Or so full of shame that you can’t admit it?” 

Her words sunk into him like fangs, he froze, not knowing what to do.
She wailed again, raw and desperate, pleading for a response; begging him to admit what he had done. She threw her fists into the door, pure anger taking over. Her voice slowly warping and distorted. The banging had a grotesque rhythm. 

Then came a crack.

A wet, sickening thud followed. 

Emmett held his own body, trembling and consoling himself like a child. Her screams were loud and piercing; her voice was no longer wet and gurgled but sharp like glass scratching metal. Quick, uneven footsteps echoed off and she appeared on the other camera, ripping it from its mount and darting back to the door. 

She set it to face the entrance and he finally saw what the thud was. Her severed arm lay on the ground, blood sprayed across the door.

“Admit it!” She shrieked, her voice high-pitched and inhuman. Over and over, she repeated her words, devolving into a chant. She started slamming her head into the door, each impact like a drumbeat of insanity.

“Stop!” Emmett begged, covering his ears. “Please just stop!”

Slowly, unnaturally, she stood upright and turned toward the camera. Her head tilted, her arm lowered, and a sickening twisted grin on her face. It stretched so wide it made him uneasy. His blood curdled.

“The irony of that.” She rasped, her voice warped. He couldn’t tell if it was from contentness or pure hatred. Without another word, she promptly turned and walked off into the night.

Emmett shook and sobbed, slowly growing quieter. His breathing was ragged and shallow. The silence that followed was sickening and profound. Like a heavy fog, it felt suffocating. 

At last, the silence broke.

A single, sharp gunshot rang out.

The quietness returned. Deeper, darker, and more chilling than it had ever been.
