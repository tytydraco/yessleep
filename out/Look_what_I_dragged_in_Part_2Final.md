In the following month there were practically no incidents with the '[Scrambler](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1q6la49/look_what_i_dragged_in_part_1/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)'. On the odd occasion, I would see something moving in my peripheral at night when leaving the food out. But half the time it was the stray and the other I would just quickly enter the house and leave the door locked. There weren’t any confrontations, no glowing eyes peering at me from every corner I walked past. I even eased up on my curtain rule aside from my bedroom ones. I don't think they'd ever open again as long as I lived. But I was almost feeling secure again, enough that when a couple of neighbourhood kids invited me out, I said yes.

I don’t necessarily regret my decision now. I hadn’t left the house for a reason other than school in months. I was practically going mental locked up inside the house with only my own thoughts for company, and as of late my thoughts weren’t very comforting. There wasn’t much point in staying cooped up for safety if something started killing you from the inside. So I went wandering around the town in the early evening. Just a quick little outing, I had told myself.

That ‘little outing’ turned into five hours where at some point one of the others, Justin I assume, had acquired a bottle of vodka in a brown paper bag. I didn’t drink any, but that didn’t stop me from finding entertainment in listening to them. I didn’t even notice the sun setting until someone else pointed it out, slurring out a “Aw, that looks fuckin’ sick.”, and I turned to watch it with a slight horror digging into my heart. I instantly bid my farewells and a couple of fist bumps before I speed walked away.

We had walked halfway down the nature trail before I copped the time, and it wasn’t a quick walk back. The nerves hadn’t really spiked until darkness started seeping into every other edge I walked by, and I couldn’t stop myself from looking left, right and over my shoulder every minute until my head felt like it was about to unscrew. By the time I was on the cusp of my neighbourhood the streetlights had come on, everything that wasn’t beneath them became concealed. That was about where I started sprinting back, not caring if any people saw me. Logic eluded me, and all of my surroundings whispered danger into my ear.

I stopped at the bottom of our driveway, giving a quick scan to try and find any signs of the “Scrambler”, but it was the same as it had been the last few weeks. Nothing. Suspicious, I took one step forward to better look at the inside of our hedges. Nothing again. I jogged over to the front door, grateful it was locked, and entered the house. I looked through the window as I turned the lock. I saw no movement and stood for a moment, baffled. In the past few months I had learned to anticipate the worst, and that time it had fallen short. A rollercoaster that never dropped.

As the wasted adrenaline wore off I got tired, and while it was a little early I figured trying to sleep early wouldn’t be a bad thing. I had been so desperate for some in recent weeks that I would on the rare instance sleep in the bathtub upstairs. Our only windowless room. I had decided to at least try and wean myself back on to an actual bed. 

Since it was already dark out, I had to abide by the no cat food rule. I felt bad, but it couldn’t be helped. It was a mental block in my head where the possibility of bending it was no longer considered. Not even checking if the stray was out and about I headed upstairs, turning a few lights off along the way. 

I got a few miserable hours of tossing and turning before I gave up altogether. I was too fixated on my curtain, pulling at it every few minutes to ensure it fully encased the glass behind. It was just a bad night, I had told myself. I wanted to go on my phone but the battery was too low. So I decided to head downstairs and get it, only using my flash to navigate through the house. It should have been mostly uneventful, as uneventful as the previous few hours had been.

I glanced around the room, barely able to make out my desk. My charger was still plugged in next to my monitor, my PC blinking a gentle red as it hadn’t been properly powered down. I connected my phone for a moment, and began to reply to a couple messages. An odd feeling overcame me, and I was long past the point of ignoring gut instincts. I paused for a moment, and gently placed my phone face-down onto my mouse mat. 

It was around then that I heard it. I began to slowly back away into the corner of the room, sliding my feet silently against the ground so as to not make a single sound.

I heard a muffled scrape echo from another room down the hallway. The guest room I would learn, and then a piercing rattle. Something heavy collapsed onto the carpet with a resounding thud.

My body plummeted into an agonising hypervigilance that made me want to shed the enamel from my teeth and tear the follicles of hair from my head. Even the way my shirt had shifted with every movement I made felt too loud. I think that my body forced my heartbeat to a near stop out of sheer self-preservation. Don’t think I even robbed a single breath from the  suddenly stale air around me.

The only time it made a sound was when carpet met wood. The boards groaned for a moment before abruptly coming to a stop as if the thing had realised its mistake. And then it was complete, utter, atrocious silence.

I wondered for a cursory moment, if I had conjured up the entire thing in my head. If I was grappling with paranoia again, tugging me against the wall like a skittish rabbit via a tightening noose. My hands pressed against the wall, practically glued due to how clammy my palms had become. I wouldn’t have noticed the creature if it weren’t for my PC’s sparse flickering. 

In the hallway, the mass of something sneaking near the floor moved past the exposed doorframe. The red glowed, and I saw the shape of a vague, bulbous back hunched like a bloody rainbow. It was bony and had ribs that protruded so violently they seemed like the fingers of a hand trapped taut against the body by a thin layer of skin. The light flared on and off, turning its movements into shattered snapshots as it made its way down the hall, so calculated yet oddly sluggish. Those mutilated paws navigated the boards quieter than I ever had, and I could only ignore the pit in my stomach as it continued to avoid the squeakier ones with practiced finesse. Its eyes switched between bright green and black every second, but I still shudder in relief that they never met mine.

I waited for a moment after it was out of view before making my way to the door on shaky legs that only just refused to give out. I tried shutting it as quietly as I could aside from the click at the end, then I locked it immediately afterwards. The guilt of leaving Pip upstairs alone chipped away at me, and it still does now. But what else could I have done? That thing was probably already halfway up the stairs directly between us. I ended up sliding down against the door, heart not really pounding as much as you would expect it to be. I think I knew it would find a way back to me, somewhere in the most primitive sections of my brain. I had recognised its intelligence long before I could put it to words.

I had committed to another long night sat on the floor, curled into a fearful lump. My gut twisted when I heard the familiar sound of Pip jumping off my bed directly above me, which morphed into reassurance when I heard her clacking against the steps in quick strides before fading somewhere deeper into the house. I felt better, if only slightly. And then I closed my eyes, trying to pretend the raspy breaths from behind the door weren’t there. That it wasn’t spewing a rotting stench, seeping under the door to make me choke. I even managed to tune out the sound of something clinking against the metal door handle, trying to pull it down, and the irritated gargle that followed. And then the quiet that encased the dreadful moment, drawing it out and preserving it so I couldn’t ever forget.

I didn’t leave the room until midday when both my parents had returned. I listened to the rattle of mum’s keys and the tumble my dad’s boots made when he kicked them off. As they immediately went upstairs to go take a nap, I tentatively opened the door. Entirely drained and immune to any outside forces or emotions.

I shambled into the guest room next door, dragging my gaze over carpet that was slightly matted from some unknown goop and then to the vent above the closet. It was only slightly smaller than the flap in the kitchen, plenty large enough for a medium sized animal to fit through. We often fought with birds breaking through to nest throughout the year, and now I find it funny how miniscule those problems seem now. I wandered around the room for a moment to see if anything else was amiss before leaving to find something that could board it up. I spent the rest of the day doing just that, prodding it from the other side with a broomstick to see when it would give.

Even despite all the events I have described to you so far, I could tell you I was adapting as much as one can in my scenario. I had learned to live with the restrictions that continued to pile on with no end in sight. The transition was so gradual that I hadn’t even really noticed how much my life had changed until I had typed all of this up. I was confident that if I played it smart, safe and stuck to the rules that I would be fine. I could make it to college, hours and hours away, and then it would be over. I had lied to myself day by day and tricked myself into believing it wasn’t as big of a deal as it was. Even though the weight of it all wore me down in such a way that I couldn’t even realise it at the time.

It’s only now that I realise how deluded I was. How completely awry everything had gone and how horrible things had become.

I still find myself wondering exactly what had gone wrong to allow the next series of events to occur. What weakness in my defence had been exploited. I don’t even know if it was an error of my own, it could have been as simple as my parents accidentally opening something in the night and forgetting to lock it behind them. Or maybe there was a vent in the house that I had failed to correctly batten down. I suppose it’s all inconsequential when it comes down to it, no matter how badly I want someone to blame. Even if it’s myself.

I was sloppy, and didn’t latch my bedroom door. I was so tired I could only stare at the untouched lock, wanting to get up and rectify my mistake but my body couldn’t respond. I told myself that it was okay, that the lock wasn’t a necessity. That the rare sleep I was being taunted with was far more important. That surely, every possible entry point into the house had been accounted for when I did the routine check. That time, I had lied to myself without even knowing. It was deep into the night when my problems reached their crescendo.

I woke up to a glob of something trailing down my neck, it was frigid and left an irritating film trailing behind it on my skin. I assumed it was my own drool, and drearily tried to wipe it with my hand, my eyes still closed. Only when I felt more dribble onto my knuckles did I finally open them to try and catch a leak in the ceiling. 

There was no leak. My eyes never saw the ceiling.

Instead I found myself staring into a fleshy gaping maw. There was infected gum encrusted with a disturbingly ancient amount of plaque, it oozed a pinkish saliva that connected jagged teeth by thin strands. A wave of revulsion hit me as I watched its jaw pathetically twitch in an attempt to jostle it upwards. It appeared to have been broken or mangled in some way to the point it simply wouldn’t close anymore. Instead it was left uselessly hanging, allowing whatever slobber had been festering inside to escape and pour down onto my unknowing body. Its eyes. Oh fuck, its eyes. 

The pupils were so blown out that it was a miracle any white peeked through, especially when its gaze jittered back and forth between seemingly either side of me. Might as well have just been looking through me, I could have been fooled into thinking it was half-blind with a stare like that. All of these observations tumbled through my head in what should’ve been about a couple seconds. I was still dozy from being unconscious not long before, and instead of instant panic gripping me it was a gradual build-up of dread and realisation. I tried grappling for the air that escaped me. I didn’t know what I was gonna do next. Whether it was to scream my lungs out for my parents across the hall or start cursing at it in an attempt of intimidation is unknown. Because instead an excruciating shriek was torn from my body, alongside a helping of shredded flesh.

It tore into my forearm with its top row of teeth, the other dragging uselessly into my back. It fumbled slightly as I began to struggle beneath, a filthy paw with defined digits came up and pressed down on my stomach to try and still me. It did so with shockingly little effort. The inside of its mouth was slick with drool and pus and struggled to find purchase even as canines and incisors shook back and forth to try and delve into my arm as much as it could. It felt like rusty nails were trying to wiggle deep beneath my skin, and my eyes became glassy as I feebly began trying to hit at its eyes. Its neck. Anything that looked weak. But everywhere was either inaccessible or horribly dense muscle for something that looked so skinny. It continued like that for less than a minute, far too long on my end, before it snapped backwards off of me.

Its yellowed teeth ripped free uncaringly, leaving nasty gashes in their wake and I yelled again. Blood spattered and it turned around and smoothly exited the room. Silently and precisely, even when it slid down the stairs out of view from the hallway. That’s when I noticed the lights were on out there. I heard my parents shouting from somewhere unseen, but I couldn’t make out what they were saying. I was practically unreachable by the time they got to me, hysterically trying to stem the bleeding while rambling to my parents about the Scrambler through watery breaths.

When they dragged me outside I almost lost it. The night outside had never felt as threatening as it did in the few minutes it took to get from our front door to the car. Certainly extended by my stubbornness. I kept my head down as we pulled out from the driveway, not needing to check if it was watching from somewhere nearby. I knew it was. It had been watching longer than I realised at that moment. Ever present from the corners of my vision, darting back and forth where it knew I couldn’t see. Where I didn’t want to look. Where I knew it could be but didn’t want to check. I shoved myself as far back in my safe, deaf, blind little capsule I could and was buried so deep I thought nothing could get to me. And then I had the audacity to act surprised when it did. What was wrong with me? I’m puzzled even now by how unbothered by its presence I had been, why I had just accepted its existence and place in my life like nothing had ever really been wrong. Like it had always been there. Like I hadn’t been utterly petrified since it first started poking around my backyard.

I stared down at my arm as my parents drove, unable to muster up the courage to speak. I would sound crazy. I felt crazy, probably wouldn’t have believed my own injury if the pain wasn’t so vivid. If my fear wasn’t so tangible.

I would occasionally lift my fingers to glimpse at the puncture holes in my flesh, like pools of opaque red water littering my arm. The blood had stopped in some places, still seeped steadily in others. It was haphazard, uncoordinated and impulsive. It reminded me of sharks. Exploratory bites to check if something was a prey item or not. I could tell what it had determined me to be from the way it latched on. The way its small, dark eyes had wobbled over my face, disfigured from panic. Interested. Excited. Assured.

When I was patched up at the hospital, I had finally drawn the line. I didn’t care whose house I had to stay at, all I knew was that I couldn’t go back, not for the time being. And my parents seemed pretty understanding of that, to a point, and had decided to let me stay at a friend's house for a week or two. That way I could still go to school, and when winter break hit I could stay with a relative. While I wasn’t as far away as I wanted, it was better than the alternative. I knew it couldn’t be permanent, though, as my parents insisted that they would rejig our locks. Even promised to check our doors and vents at my request. They were sympathetic, but also put off. They just don’t know any better.

I would only be convinced to visit my house during the midday to collect my things and say goodbye to my parents. Pipsqueak was curled up on my bed and watched me walk around the room, shoving whatever I could into my bags. My eyes kept drifting back to my pillow, a puddle of blood and whatever else the creature had expelled from its gob had encrusted onto it. It made me sweat and scratch at my neck, as if it was still there on my skin. How many times had it done that in the beginning without me knowing? If I think about it for too long I get light-headed.

My friend, Justin, and his family were accommodating in ways I could never express my gratitude for. It took a while to feel properly settled. But the guest bedroom was on the second floor, and there was nothing but a couple yards of grass and fence in front of it, somewhat comforting. I just locked the door religiously every night, and then I could grab the few hours I needed before school with minimal difficulty. There was also the upside of never being alone in the house, as Justin was always there alongside one or both of his parents. Neither of them had night shifts to work, so there was always noise ricocheting throughout the place. Even when night began to manifest, I wasn’t completely devoid of human occupancy. Which definitely eased the adjustment process.

The healing process was a different story. It looked pretty gross, to put it lightly. I’ll spare the details, but it got a bit infected not long after I left the hospital. It oozed unknown liquids that disgusted me to look at, and I was quickly put on antibiotics not long after. The wound looks a lot better as I’m writing this, but I don’t believe it has entirely stitched back together beneath the scab. Honestly, looking back on the state of that mouth, I got lucky. 

I think it was about a week into my stay when Justin finally seemed to work up the confidence to ask me about whatever animal had attacked me back home. He brought it up casually after watching me change the bandage on my arm. An off-handed, “Damn, what caused all that?”

I didn’t respond immediately afterwards, fumbling with the zip of his mother’s med kit on the sink counter. I watched my face turn pale in the mirror, and I think he saw it too. He averted his gaze to the ground from the doorframe, like a guilty dog. It didn’t bother me. I was just as curious as he was, unfortunately, and had no satisfactory answer to provide him with.

I didn’t want to describe it to him, I didn't even want to waste that effort. No matter what words I use, I know I will fall short. I couldn’t describe the hunger I saw in that shrewd gaze, the disgusting feeling of diseased saliva and teeth mingling with my own blood. I would be describing a man-eater. And that was difficult to do when there weren’t animals who actively hunted humans where we lived. Not that any of us knew of. All I could do was offer the cold, simple truth of it all.

“I have no idea.”

He didn’t ever ask again after that, and I think he told his parents to never prod either, since they only ever carefully inquired about my injuries from that day on.

I found myself mostly sticking by Justin at school, and only ever went on the occasional hangout afterwards. As time went on I spent a bit more time outside the house, only when the Sun was high, of course. I wasn’t out of the woods yet, I kept telling myself. Even if there were none of the usual signs that adjoined my unwanted company. None of the paranoia that had been trailing me for weeks. The difference was almost jarring. Looking over my shoulder was a conscious effort now, no longer an urge that felt like life or death. It hit me not long after I stepped foot in a house different from my own, like something that had been constricting me for months prior had loosened. Like I had been submerged deep underwater and suddenly dragged up, the bends instead were replaced with elation. I felt good. Better than I had been in a very long time.

There was only one minor hiccup, something that I considered not even mentioning since it seemed so insignificant when it happened. In comparison to the past few months, it was. But as I think about it now, I feel a pit in my stomach born from overwhelming regret and guilt that makes me ill in ways I couldn’t convey to you. 

I had just completed my final day of school before the holidays, which was also the day where me and Justin’s parent teacher meetings aligned. So we stayed behind, wandering the halls and shooting hoops on the court for a few hours. Just passing the time until our parents arrived so they could take us home themselves. A few other kids joined us throughout, coming and going as the meetings went on well after dark. At that point we remained just inside the main entrance, making jokes about the things our teachers would have to say. Considering my recent attendance and performance, my expectations were considerably low. Though I couldn’t convince myself to worry about it. I had bigger things going on, to say the least.

One of the people that had swung by to say hello was Theo. He stayed with us while his parents walked off towards wherever they needed to be. And he remained even after their meeting had ended to stay and talk some more. He lived within walking distance of the school, so it wasn’t that big a deal. There was talk of us heading to his place afterwards, but that never came to fruition. Justin declined right before I did. I’m still not sure if it was because he thought his parents would be too displeased to let him go or if he saw my breath hitch at the thought of wandering the streets at night. Either way, I silently thanked him.

When Justin’s parents emerged from down a hallway, he met halfway to talk with them. Maybe not wanting to be publicly humiliated in front of his friends, I couldn’t tell for definite.

Theo took that as a signal to leave, and to put further distance between me and Justin so he could have privacy, I walked Theo to the main doors. He opened the door, and we did a quick fist bump before he walked out into the dark. I was about to close the door behind him when he whipped around, yelling at me when he was already halfway to one of the open car gates. “Ya better drag your ass down here from your aunt’s place after Christmas!” he jokingly threatened, a laugh at the end betraying its authenticity. I had almost forgotten, his birthday was soon. I only chuckled in return and waved him off as he turned back around. 

For some reason I watched him a moment longer than I should’ve as he headed down the road. Only his upper torso was visible from the wall that surrounded the school. It was a feeling that was as familiar as it was undesirable. I gave into the odd compulsion, and only when he had turned a corner on the pavement could I relax my muscles. My hand loosening on the crash bar that I hadn’t really realised had tightened. Blood flowed back into white knuckles as one of my feet shifted towards the inside.

I saw something dash in my peripheral, from the beginning of the gate to the end. It was so quick that by the time I turned my head it was long gone, and it was so silent that I had assumed it to be part of my imagination. Not even a piece of gravel had been shifted in its path, and for a moment I felt the urge to go over and peek over the wall to prove my theory. But that urge dissolved as quickly as it had formed, and I simply shut the door behind me. I walked back over to Justin and his parents and waited with them until my own had finished talking to the teachers.

I mention this now, because as I sit here at my aunt’s house typing this up, something bad happened a week ago.

I was so zoned in on my own problems for so long, that when I had finally gotten away from them I thought that would be it. That was where the story would remain in limbo until I had returned from break to my home where the horror would begin all over again. I didn’t find myself panicking over it like I should have been. I didn’t fight back against that inevitability, and I’m not even fighting it now.

Instead I feel queasy. It is no longer fear that eats away at me.

It is an all-consuming remorse that picks away at my soul and ravages my body like a devastating disease. Thinking about it for too long makes me itch, picking away at my bandages and the tattered skin I know hides underneath. I am a coward in every sense of the word.

Theodore went missing around a week ago, somewhere between Christmas and New Years. He didn’t make it to his birthday party.

The entire community was in uproar, all of us were shaken and saddened. Police turned the area upside down looking for him, went house to house in a piteous attempt to garner answers. His parents made missing posters, and asked around online for help. Any shred of a lead that would give them even a small push in the right direction. There was nothing out there, not yet anyway. I wish I could tell them that. I want to crush their hope beneath my boot before it develops into something far more cruel. But I think what they found at the house will deliver the message better than I could.

The only remnants that was left behind by the guy was an open front door and a smear of blood on the driveway. 

I listened to Justin and his parents freak out when they heard the news, shocked that their peaceful little town could harbour such threats and accidents. I was sad too, of course. But I had realised long before anyone that this place was not as it seemed. I had learned not to grow complacent, not even in my own home. At the time, I didn’t want to link Theo’s situation to my own. The chances were small, after all, weren’t they? We lived too far away to walk. He lived smack dab in the middle of a housing estate, not by woods and never-ending back roads. His parents didn’t work at night, he wasn’t alone.

By the time I got to my aunt’s house hours away, I had already begun the task of scrutinizing and poking holes at my own story. My sad excuse. It felt apart quickly, only held together by stubborn ignorance and misplaced hope. Theo’s house was only too far for a human to trek, in the pitch black of night there were plenty of hiding places that no longer relied on nature, and most crucially, his parents had date nights. And it’s the alignment of these factors that ultimately ended in his death, in the way he had unknowingly offered an opportunity for something unfortunate to happen. 

I can’t deny what I saw at the school anymore. The creature was there, plain as night, and unknown to me at the time it had selected different prey. Prey that hadn’t known it existed.

Out of boredom, or maybe an attempt at further torturing myself as if that would outweigh the guilt, I searched around online. I looked at infamous cases of animals who hunted humans in the past. All of them feared greatly by the locals, all of them put down by hunters now revered as heroes.

All of them were injured. 

From porcupine quills to shattered teeth, they all had a justification as to why they had to turn to humans instead of their normal prey. I thought it was odd at first, why they would seemingly stoop to humans when there weren’t any other options, I had assumed humans would be more difficult to take down. As if humans were these untouchable things, far above nature and the grisly world that lied between trees and grass. I realise how stupid that train of thought is now, like I hadn’t learned just how vulnerable humans could be in their day to day. How unaware they could be of what goes on in the world around them.

They have yet to find a body, but as they expand the search I know they will. They’ll find him somewhere deep in the woods, picked apart by wildlife. Or perhaps they’ll find him down some road, long forgotten and unused, like so many of the badgers that had come before him. Only half-mauled and mutilated as if something had struggled immensely in trying to wrap its barely usable mandibles around his limbs.

While I remain here and wait for more news, I struggle to put it all together. I know there are probably things I’m missing, things my drained mind and body haven’t deemed worthy to dwell over. Instead I obsess over what I could have said or done to prevent Theo’s demise. I should have gone to his house that night. Maybe urged Justin to let him come over for a sleepover, I don’t know. I should’ve explained it all to him, even if he wouldn’t have believed it. Even just one skittish glance over his head as he walked up the driveway might have been enough. 

But my opportunities have long forsaken me, and I am left alone to simmer with unanswered questions and this familiar acceptance creeping over me. One I have only felt once before when I stared straight into that infected jaw so many nights ago. And as the break crawls to an end, I know things are only going to get worse.

I’m not a hunter. And I am certainly not a hero. I am a kid about to have the label ‘adult’ plastered over me in a few months. I am a guilty, fearful child that is about to walk back into that town as if nothing is wrong, and I can’t bring myself to do anything other than just that. I am the complete toddler that left out a bowl of food one random night on the off chance that some stray would creep in to keep me company, only it was the wrong stray. And now, people I know and love have to deal with the consequences of my choices.

I feel it calling for me, even from so far away. I know it is waiting for me. It knows me. It has infected me with something more than just a sickness or disease garnered from a measly bite. And it isn’t going to go away, not unless I sleep in my own bed. Not unless I leave the door unlatched and the cat flap wide open.
