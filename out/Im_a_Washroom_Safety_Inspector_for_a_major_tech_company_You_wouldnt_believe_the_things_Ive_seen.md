I stepped into the men’s bathroom in the IT department on the 7th floor of the corporate headquarters in \[REDACTED\] at 3:30pm on Tuesday, the 2nd of November, 2024. It was a basic, corporate lavatory. White tile floors, alternating grey and black tile walls, green stalls, white urinals, white sinks with a square mirror hanging above each, automatic soap dispensers, and Dyson automatic hand dryers. I inspected the corners of the floor. Substantially clean. The rest of the interior held no room for concern, either, and there was nothing of note inside the stalls until I noticed the words “BEWARE THE HEAD” written in black sharpie next to the toilet paper dispenser in the one against the far wall. I made a note on my clipboard and exited the facilities.



My name is B. Crane. This is how I spent the last 12 years of my life. As the Chief Washroom Safety Inspector for \[REDACTED\], I was charged with overseeing more than 2000 restrooms in 127 locations across \[REDACTED\] and \[REDACTED\]. My friends called me The Toilet Man. My wife called me Brubear.



It was one week later, when I was in a women’s room on the 15th floor of the executive offices in \[REDACTED\], when it first occurred. The lavatory was surprisingly unkempt, with its sterile white walls, stalls, toilets, and sinks unable to hide the lack of maintenance and care that should have been performed. Slight iron build-up under the third sink due to a small leak. The fourth soap dispenser had developed a 2-second delay, leading the operator to move their hand out of the way before the pink matter dispensed. As such, a small pool had formed on the floor - a slipping hazard. Also, two of the locks on the stall doors were loose. I was cataloguing this information when I suddenly heard a woman scream.



“GET AWAY FROM ME!!!”



“LEAVE ME ALONE! WHOEVER YOU ARE!”



“FUCK OFF!!!”



The voice had somehow seemingly come from inside the room, specifically the last stall. I had already done my inspection of this stall, and unless she was hiding in the toilet, I was sure there had been no woman in there. Nevertheless, I eventually summoned the courage to shuffle over to the now loosely shut door, nervously calling out as I did.



“Ma’am? Are you okay?”



Curiously, when I pushed the door ajar, what was revealed was only the lonely toilet bowl with its lid and seat up. I was sure I had left them down, as I always did following inspection. After waiting a minute to see if the voice would resurface, I was moving to leave when I noticed something written on the bottom of the wall just behind the neck of the toilet.



“BEWARE THE HEAD”



I put the experience out of my mind. Perhaps the bathroom just had good acoustics, and some poor soul on the street had been shouting near a drainage pipe, and the sound had somehow carried itself up through the pipe and somehow expelled itself there. I had heard a story about how outside some of the pyramids in Egypt, there was a place where a whisper could travel great distances. I had heard similar details about old churches. This was likely such a case.



My next stop was the office in \[REDACTED\]. I was to stay a day for a routine inspection but had arranged an extra night on the company’s dime. As an avid history buff, I spent my day off exploring the city and taking tours of government buildings. In the late afternoon, I realized that in all my excitement I had forgotten to have lunch, so I stepped into a cafe outside \[REDACTED\] and ordered an Italian sub with olives - my favorite. While my sandwich was being made, I excused myself to the restroom.



Diagonal black and white tile floor, purple wallpaper, wooden stalls, white sink bar - all surprisingly clean. I assumed this was due to the cafe’s proximity to the monument. I took care of business and went to wash my hands. As I applied the suds, a toilet flushed. A young man in a suit exited the stall and stepped up to the sink beside me. I at once recognized him as M. Teller, the newly elected, controversial diplomat from \[REDACTED\].



“Howdy.”



I nodded in reply as Teller quickly - but thoroughly - washed his hands before grabbing two paper towels off the small stack on the counter. As he dried his paws, I noticed his green eyes glance upward. My gaze naturally followed them to the ceiling, where the words “BEWARE THE HEAD” had been graffitied in red pen. We locked eyes briefly, and as Teller took his leave, he paused to put a hand on my shoulder, lean in to my ear, and say:



“Mind your head, friend.”



The next day, I was busy with my inspection of the 36 bathrooms in the office in downtown \[REDACTED\]. Part of what made my job so interesting was that the company had no standard for how a bathroom needed to be designed. This had both pros and cons for my work. On the one hand, standardized lavatories would make things faster and more efficient, but on the other, it gave variety to what would otherwise be a very menial task. I had grown to love restrooms and all their differences. The floors. The stalls. The sinks. Each bathroom was unique - no two the same. Sometimes, I would catch myself standing next to a urinal or sitting in a stall, lost in a daydream. There was something about the quietness, the calm of a bathroom, that soothed me. One night while my wife and I were eating dinner, she had said that she didn’t know when, but she had lost her husband in the restroom. Like I had gone in one day and never come out. But she was only joking.



I had finished my last restroom and was performing my post-inspection paperwork as I did every day, but there was something bothering me, although I couldn’t figure out what it was. I went over the forms three times and could still find nothing. I even went so far as to retrace my footsteps in my mind, entering each bathroom in the building in my memory, but nothing was awry. As I stared out at the city through a window, wondering just how many bathrooms were in the hundreds of buildings in my sightline, I subconsciously began to count the number of restrooms I had visited that day. That was it! I double-checked and confirmed that I had only inspected 35, and while the official building designs denoted there being 36, the actual list only included 35. So, where was the 36th?



Management informed me that it was likely an error by the building contractors. This seemed believable enough, so I gathered my belongings and made my way to the elevator. As I waited, an elderly custodian pushed his trolley up beside me. The elevator was taking a long time, and as such, my curiosity eventually got the better of me.



“It’s in the basement.”



It was actually on B4, four floors below the building. Riding the elevator down, I happened to look up and notice the ceiling hatch was open, revealing the thick steel cord controlling my descent. When I arrived at B4, I stepped out and faced the dimly lit hallway that lay before me. The custodian had said this floor hadn’t been used since the building exchanged hands over 20 years ago. I passed rooms packed with stacks of old chairs and office tables, out-of-date computers, and fax machines. The door at the end of the hallway featured male and female stick figures to denote that it was, in fact, a restroom. I pulled the door open and stepped inside.



What I found was an abomination. I had seen thousands of bathrooms in my day, but nothing like this. It was more suited to be the set of a horror film than a place to take care of one’s business. Sounds filled the space as the toilets conversed, the sinks gurgled, and the walls breathed. And the smell… my nostrils had ingested what I thought was every smell imaginable, but nothing I had experienced before held a candle. I put a cloth over my nose and stepped further into the depths of the room, already writing the safety report in my head.



There were three stalls, the first two doors hanging open. I made a cursory glance inside, unsurprised by the terror held within, before noticing my reflection in the center mirror. The glass had warped with time, presenting my image as though it were a mirror in a funhouse, my eyes and head distorted to humorous proportions. I suddenly had the urge to reach out and touch my reflection, and when I did, the glass shattered - shards loudly clattering into the sink and onto the floor.



“PLEASE, NO!!!”



“GET AWAY! GET AWAY!”



I was frozen, staring at the door of the third stall as anguished, hollow breathing emanated. It sounded as if whoever was inside was wearing a scuba mask. Not wanting to cause any more trouble but filled with an insatiable need to know who was in there, I silently stepped up to the door and pushed it open.



What greeted me was an image of which I had never before seen and which I wish I would never have. A crown of tangled, strangly, brown hair flowed out from within the toilet bowl, its owner’s head stuffed inside. Dirt-stained arms led to hands which gripped the porcelain tightly but did not appear to be attempting to pull their controller from her place. The lower half of the woman’s body - I cannot find the courage to describe. Upon closer inspection, it became clear to me that her head was stuck. At the risk of more shouting, I finally spoke up.



“Miss?”



“GO AWAY! FUCK YOU!!!”



I stood there in silence before finally moving forward to pull the woman’s pants up, struggling as she kicked and flailed, screaming obscenities at me. I just couldn’t bear to leave her in her current state before leaving to get help. After the deed was done, she quieted.



“I’m going to get some help, okay? You’re –”



“NO!!! Just… Just stay here. Don’t go. Please! You have to help me before it comes back!”



I didn’t know what “it” was, but I thought it better not to complicate things.



“What do you want me to do?”



“Grab my shoulders and pull! I’m stuck.”



After some hesitation, I did as she asked, placing a leg on either side of her and pulling her shoulders as hard as I could without breaking the poor woman in half.



“This isn’t going to work. I’ll get some –”



“Please, please! It’ll work. Just keep –”



FWAP. A wet slapping sound resounded from somewhere nearby. Like a mop hitting a tile floor. It seemed to somehow have come from both inside and outside the room at the same time. The woman’s muffled voice called out.



“You have to run! Go! Before it gets you!!!”



“What’re you –”



FWAP.



“Run! It’s coming!!!”



I was suddenly overcome with an insurmountable fear, as if in this moment I somehow knew exactly what it was that was coming. I hesitated only a moment longer before rushing from the room.



30 minutes later, I was sat in the building lobby with my head in my hands, lost in thought, when a pair of firefighters’ boots, a pair of police duty boots, and the building manager’s loafers came into view.



“Come with us.”



Together we descended. Feeling lightheaded, I tilted my head back against the rear wall of the elevator. The ceiling hatch was now closed. Before I had time to ponder this, the elevator came to a stop, and the doors parted to show the hallway of B4. Dread filled my heart as we grew nearer to the bathroom.



“Is she okay? Did you get her out?”



The building manager responded in monotone.



“Look and see.”



I couldn’t believe my eyes as I stepped inside. The room that lay before me could not be the same I had visited only a few short minutes ago. Shiny, white sinks. Spotless, gray stalls. Mirrors as clear as windows. The subtle smell of bleach mixed with lemon cleaner. I peered into the third stall, its only inhabitant a beautifully clean, porcelain toilet. For a moment, I swore I even saw it glisten. I looked back at the restroom’s entrance, where three sets of eyes stared at me with a mix of annoyance and concern.



My supervisor decided I needed a vacation, and since I had used barely any of my holiday pay, I was free to take as long as I wanted. I decided a week-long trip to Poland, having never had the chance to visit the Nazi concentration camps before, would be a nice, relaxing way to take my mind off things.



A week later, I was 45,000 feet in the air, sipping on my complimentary Coke as I looked out the window, replaying my time overseas. The few occasions on which I had traveled, I’d always found it rewarding to see things from another culture’s perspective. For instance, I had noticed that in Krakow and Warsaw, they labeled their lavatories simply as “toilet” rather than opting for softer language such as “restroom” or “bathroom.” I appreciated the bluntness of the word. It seemed more honest.



So many names. Powder room. Little girl’s room. Washroom. Latrine. Water Closet. The John. The list was never-ending.



For a while, things returned to normal. I was busy with work. Going in a toilet here, going in a toilet there. Such was life. One day, while I was inspecting the interior of a stall off the lunchroom in the office in \[REDACTED\], I had the passing thought that using the toilet was probably the most consistent action taken by humans. All around the world, people spent their days going in and out. It seemed to me to be the most basic societal constraint. In the past, people would just step away from the group to do their business, but in modern society, relieving oneself had been degraded, in a way. Sometimes, you were forced to endure bodily pain simply because there was no available toilet.



So many hours, days elapsed within those echoey chambers. How long had I spent?



A few weeks later, I received a call from my supervisor informing me that I was being put on special assignment. Apparently, the WSI for the \[REDACTED\] government had contracted a vicious case of salmonella, and there was no way to know when she would return to the line of duty. As such, I was to spend the week finishing her inspections of the government buildings in \[REDACTED\] and \[REDACTED\]. They had graciously offered me a complimentary ticket to a taping of The \[REDACTED\] Show (my favorite way to wind down in the evening), and on top of this, I would receive overtime pay for my efforts, making it an offer I simply couldn’t refuse.



The next few days passed as any others had. Checking sink flow rates. Looking for leakage. Then, the night of the taping came. I had a front-row seat for the show. Oh, how I laughed and laughed. The guests were \[REDACTED\] and \[REDACTED\] - a pairing for the ages - and the musical act was \[REDACTED\]. After the show, I was deep in thought as I tried to find a toilet. I soon became lost, somehow ending up in the labyrinth backstage. Eventually, I spotted a men’s room sign and dashed inside before any of the crew noticed my out-of-placeness.



Euphoria washed over me as I stood over the porcelain throne. Given my trespassing, I found it safer to use a stall rather than a urinal. As the sound echoed, my eyes wandered across the graffitied messages that covered the stall’s interior. Quotes and signatures from a host of stars, ranging from somewhat unknown to ultra-famous.



I had finished my objective and was doing up my belt when my gaze froze. Over the past month, I had been able to put the mysterious phrase out of my mind, but there it was, just above \[REDACTED\]’s signature.



“If anyone can hear this, please contact C. Grey at 555-7364 and tell her that Brian didn’t forget her birthday and that her present is hidden behind the box of Trix cereal in the kitchen cupboard.”



The man’s voice that had discharged from the toilet was calm and collected. I waited to see if more would come, but silence befell the stall, and I zipped up my pants.



I moved to wash my hands. In the mirror, I saw a man standing at the middle urinal - odd. I hadn’t heard anyone come in. Nor was there any sound coming from the man. He didn’t seem to be peeing. I quickly rinsed and put my hand in front of the paper towel dispenser’s motion sensor, but nothing came out. I tried again, but the same nothingness occurred. As I moved to the second dispenser, I heard a zip and saw as the show’s host turned himself from the urinal and stepped up to the sink beside me. He released a little anxious laugh.



“Stage fright, am I right?”



I gave a perfunctory fake laugh as I wildly waved my hand in front of the second paper towel dispenser, yelling in my head about how this building’s washroom safety inspector could have done such a poor job.



“I’m just kidding! I didn’t actually need to pee, see? I just like coming in here, you know? It’s quiet. Helps me think.”



“Oh, yea? Me too, I guess.”



“Hey, I don’t think we’ve met before. I’m \[REDACTED\].”



“Crane.”



I wiped my hand on my shirt and shook his hand, then backed toward the door.



“Nice to meet you, Crane. What do you do here?”



“I, uh… I’m a janitor - Head of Lavatories.”



“You’re the head, huh? Sounds stressful.”



I pushed the door open.



“Sorry, I gotta go. There’s a leak on the fifth floor!”



He called after me.



“Watch your head! They’re doing work on the lights!”



I hurried down the hall, past two men standing on ladders. They had orange safety cones set around them and were replacing long, fluorescent rods in square light fixtures in the ceiling. I pushed through a door labeled “Exit” and descended the stairs. I could have sworn I’d heard the host say “eyes” instead of “lights,” but that wouldn’t have made a whole lot of sense, would it?



That night, I had a dream. I was standing in the toilet of my elementary school, but things were different. The stalls were made of glass, giving any passerby a clear view of their interior. The mirrors had been replaced with windows looking out at the playground where I could see my classmates playing.



FWAP. Through the glass door to the hallway, I could see the janitor mopping the floor. He was dragging his mop back and forth… back and forth…



When I faced the window, my skin crawled.



All my classmates were standing stalk still, staring straight at me.



FWAP. The janitor seemed to only be cleaning that single spot of tile. Just dragging his mop back and forth… back and forth… over and over…



When I turned my head, I saw all my classmates’ faces stuffed in the windows, staring at me with big eyes and wide smiles.



Then, I woke up.



The next day, I was occupied with my inspections of the toilets in \[REDACTED\] City Hall. They were surprisingly dirty, as well as in need of an array of repairs. I had finished the 7th floor and had traveled up to the 8th, making marks on my clipboard as I absentmindedly walked down a long hallway, set my “Closed for Maintenance” sign in front of the door to the gender-neutral toilets, knocked, called out “Maintenance” for anyone inside, waited for a moment, and then entered when I finally lifted my head.



It was impossible. There was simply no logical explanation for the image of which was being presented to me. The same dirt-covered stalls. Splatter-marked urinals. The broken mirror shards on the floor. I unconsciously stepped forward, looking around the horror toilet in a fugue state. After some time, I snapped out of it when I heard the second stall moaning. Without thinking, I pulled the door open to find a man in the same predicament as that woman had been. His head stuffed in the toilet, pants down around his ankles, covered in filth.



“Hello? Is someone there?”



His hollow voice echoed in the bowl. I hesitated, a part of me not wanting to respond. To run out the way I came, desperate to escape whatever nightmare I had walked into.



“Yes, I’m - I’m here.”



“What’s your name, man?”



“Crane.”



“Nice to meet you, Crane. I’m Brian F.”



The man was shockingly nonchalant. It made me uneasy.



“What do you do for work, Crane?”



“I, uh - I’m a washroom safety inspector for a company called \[REDACTED\].”



“That’s quite the coincidence. I’m the WSI for \[REDACTED\] - the social media startup? Or, at least, I was.”



He chuckled. My brow furrowed.



“Crane, I need you to listen to me, okay? I’m afraid we don’t have much time, so you might want to write some of it down. I trust you have a clipboard with you?”



“Yes, but –”



“Good man. Now, look, Crane. Have you seen this bathroom before? I mean, this specific bathroom?”



“Yes, about a month ago –”



“Was there someone in it the last time? A woman?”



“Yes, she… she was like you.”



“Did you get any information about her? Her name, anything?”



“She was too scared. I tried to help her, but –”



“Don’t worry about that, Crane. Just listen to me carefully. That woman’s name was Mindy P. She was the WSI for the \[REDACTED\] government up until she went missing.”



“I thought she was sick?”



“Of course that’s what they’d say. No doubt if you look up what happened to me, it will say something similar. What I need you to do, Crane - do you know who M. Teller is? The diplomat from \[REDACTED\]? He’s working with our employers on something. I need you to find out what it is.”



“M. Teller is working with \[REDACTED\]?”



“You need to be careful, though. As soon as –”



FWAP. I turned my head.



“I’m sorry, Crane. It looks like our time is up.”



Brian’s voice was shaking now.



“I’m afraid you need to leave. Do as I said, but be cautious. I think you may be –”



FWAP. The sound was getting closer.



“Go, Crane, now! It’s coming!”



I turned and rushed out the door.



Over the following days, I couldn’t get the encounter out of my brain. But what was I to do? When I looked up the man’s name, I could find no record of him or his position, and as far as the investigation of M. Teller and his collaboration with \[REDACTED\], I couldn’t even imagine where to start. A cursory internet search yielded no link between the two entities.



It wasn’t until two weeks later that I hit my first major break. While doing my inspection of the office in \[REDACTED\], I was in the middle of a conversation with the building manager when I spotted M. Teller following V. Smooth, the sector president, into his office. So Brian was right. Teller was working with \[REDACTED\]. Still, what could I do?



Little did I know I wouldn’t have to do anything. Later that day, Mr. Smooth caught me in the hallway and told me he had installed an ensuite toilet off of his office. When I was let inside later on, I was shocked to see Teller sitting across from him.



“Oh, Crane! This is the guy I was telling you about, M. Yes, Crane, it’s right over there.”



I quickly excused myself to the toilet. When I went to close the door, Smooth waved it away.



“Leave it open, Crane. It gets stuffy in there.”



And so I began my inspection. During it, Teller and Smooth were busy having business conversations. At first I tried to ignore them, but eventually, curiosity got the better of me.



“When you have an organization as powerful as the one we’ve created, its appetite only grows. What better to use as feed than the ones who threaten to expose it?”



“We here at \[REDACTED\] understand, M., but it’s getting harder and harder to… discourage intrigue. At some point, don’t you think the interest rate will grow too high?”



“Every endeavor has a half-life, but what we’ve designed is so extraordinary that no one would believe those who uncover the truth, and even if they do, its morbid nature will lead the average person to choose to ignore it rather than jeopardize their own sanity.”



Again, I suspected my mind was playing tricks on me. I could have sworn Teller had said “organism,” when he clearly must have said “organization.” I finished my inspection, unsure of the context of what I had overheard. I was on my way out when Smooth called me over.



“Crane, the \[REDACTED\] government was very pleased with the work you did for them, and it appears that now \[REDACTED\] is in need of your services.”



Mr. Smooth told me that in a week's time, I was to return to \[REDACTED\] to perform inspections inside various government facilities. Normally, this would’ve excited me. A chance to see the inner sanctums where democracy was kept alive. But, due to recent events, I couldn’t push away the nervous feeling that there was something nefariously coincidental about the series of events which I was currently experiencing.



When I told my wife Susan about the assignment, she was unusually excited at the prospect.



“That’s wonderful, Brubear! They’re finally catching on to how important you are! It sounds like they’re planning on offering you a position. Government jobs can be really cushy, you know.”



I soft-shared my concerns, making sure to hold back on the details, but Susan told me I was being paranoid.



“You didn’t have a problem taking the job at \[REDACTED\]. Lord knows they’re anything but a moral company, B.”



I told her that was different, that we had had no money back then and were desperate to escape the debt that had been following us. But she wasn’t hearing it.



In the afternoon the next day, I closed the door to the toilet in the corner of the house behind the study. I preferred it over the other toilets since it was quieter and felt more contained. As I sat on the porcelain bowl, I stared at the door that led to the chemical room under the stairs. One could make out a myriad of faces in the wood grain, and I had often stared at them as I took care of business, absorbing their expressions and contemplating how they appeared to me as beings frozen in time during a moment of extreme anguish. Similar to how I imagine the people of Pompeii would have looked if they'd had their photo taken at the moment of impact.



It wasn’t until the night before I was set to leave for \[REDACTED\] that I finally got the courage to tell Susan what was really going on. We were having a candlelit dinner in the dining room. Roast beef with carrots and potatoes, cabbage salad and white bread on the side.



She sat in silence, listening intently as I took her through everything that had happened to me over the past few months. The first sight of the words graffitied on the stall wall. The woman’s screams. Etc. Etc.



Once I was done, a few seconds passed. Then, Susan simply dabbed her lips with a napkin, looked me straight in the eyes, and said:



“I’m pregnant.”



My time in \[REDACTED\] was a blur. I was unsure how many buildings I had visited, how many toilets I had inspected. All I knew was the feedback I was receiving was nothing short of suspiciously positive. Daily calls from Mr. Smooth showering me with praise. I began to wonder - how hard was inspecting a toilet, really? Was my job so difficult that it warranted this much attention? I didn’t think it to be so.



On some night, of which I do not know which, I was in my hotel room - a lavish suite in the five-star hotel they had put me up in. While lying in bed watching The \[REDACTED\] Show, unable to sleep, my eyelids were just starting to fall when I saw M. Teller walk out onto the stage and shake the host’s hand. I watched as the two men exchanged light-hearted banter. Not exceptionally funny, but passable. Eventually, the subject matter took a more serious turn.



“Mr. Teller, you’ve, uh – you’ve recently been criticized for saying that quote, ‘\[REDACTED\] is sick.’ Yesterday you said this was taken out of context?”



“Yes, well, I’m afraid it was. What I said was that there is a sickness in \[REDACTED\] - and I want to add that the important part of this is that a sickness can be cured.”



He paused before continuing.



“The people of this great nation have become more and more obsessed with the shocking. The outlandish. This is not their fault. They’ve been propagandized to consume filth by the media, foreign invaders, and my political opponents. That’s why they feel the need to spread vicious lies about me and my family, because they know the masses they’ve trained to believe their lies will eat them up like a side dish at family dinner. The claims they’ve made against me have no backing in truth. There is no great conspiracy at hand, no. Only the addiction and obsession with thinking the worst of those who don’t hold the same opinions as them. There is no monster at the end of the tunnel. Only their worst fears, dreamt up by unstable minds.”



The next thing I knew, I was sitting on the tile floor in the toilet, leaning on the porcelain bowl. I pressed the metal handle and watched as the sick inside spiraled down the drain, replacing itself with clean water.



I didn’t know what time it was, but I couldn't hear the TV playing from the other room, and the doorway was dark, so I concluded that I must have woken up nauseous sometime in the night.



I rested my head on the bowl, finding it strangely comfortable. I thought that maybe I’d just sleep here this night. After all, I may be sick again, and it would be a hassle to have to get up and run to the toilet. I was just about to fall asleep when - an admittedly odd - passing thought brought me back to consciousness.



“BEHEAD WEATHER”



Why had this phrase popped into my head? No sooner had I asked this question than I again heard the words.



“BEHEAD WEATHER”



It hadn’t been in my head. The words were coming from the toilet, and even more perplexing, it was my own voice saying them.



“BEHEAD WEATHER”



I cautiously looked at the water inside the bowl before meekly responding.



“Hello?”



There was no answer.



I woke up in bed, morning light shining through the open curtains. I sat there in a state of otherworldly aura for a moment before looking at the clock and realizing I had slept through my alarm. Even worse, I had 5 missed calls from Mr. Smooth.



I soon found myself in the back of a limo on my way to an undisclosed location, wondering at just what point I had committed the first action that had led my life to spiral from the normal down into the surreal. When I had finally returned Mr. Smooth’s call, I was informed that the location of my inspection was being changed from \[REDACTED\] to somewhere else. The new location was even classified to me, but Mr. Smooth said that I’d know it when I saw it. This prediction grew to be true as I looked out the tinted window of the limo as we pulled up to a gate at the exterior of \[REDACTED\]. I was suddenly filled with an existential sense of dread, unable to quell the feeling that something absolutely terrible was about to occur.



I was brought through security by a man and woman of the \[REDACTED\] who spoke not one word. I was then led through a series of hallways and rooms to a toilet, which I was to inspect. Once I was finished, they led me to a myriad of toilets throughout the day, each one more exorbitant in design than the last.



I was finishing an inspection of a toilet whose walls featured elaborate paintings of governmental scenes I suspected were from the 1700s, but despite my extensive knowledge of \[REDACTED\] history, I had never encountered the like. While admiring one that featured a group of men in a library, surrounding a single man atop a ladder, placing a book high up on a shelf, I accidentally knocked it off its nail - but fortunately caught it before it fell. As I went to hang it back up, I froze when I saw the phrase “BEHEAD WEATHER” scribbled in pencil on the wall behind it. When I turned from the painting, I noticed one of the guards side-eyeing me as he whispered into his walkie-talkie. Moments later, I exited the room, and the officers told me to follow. Apparently I was to meet a few people before leaving for the day.



I was brought into a room similar in appearance to the \[REDACTED\], but it was almost triangle-shaped. To me, it appeared as a movie set. Like it had been cobbled together just before my arrival, to give the appearance of an office in \[REDACTED\], but not actually so. I was just thinking this when a door-sized portion of a wall opened and three men stepped inside. The first was dressed in your average government-issued blue suit, but the other two’s clothing perplexed me. One was in a full cowboy getup complete with steel spurs. Even more odd, the third was wearing a lion costume, holding the head under his arm. The man in the suit shook my hand as he introduced himself.



“Nice to meet you, Crane. I’m Oggi F., Head of Office Safety and Management. This is Dr. Damien F., Head of Office Health, and this is T. Temple, Head of Office Ceremonies. We just wanted to stop by and meet the man everyone’s been talking about before you head off.”



I was utterly disoriented, a million questions flying through my head. But, instead of asking them, I elected to reply:



“Nice to meet you.”



Oggi lifted a hand, motioning to the building.



“It’s pretty amazing, huh? So much history in one place.”



“Yes, it’s – It’s very surreal. My being here, I mean.”



“I’m sure, I’m sure.”



An awkward silence befell the room, the three men looking at me as if they were waiting for me to do something. Finally, Oggi spoke.



“Well, anywho. We just wanted to see you off before you complete your final inspection.”



The cowboy, spurs jingling, stepped over to a statue of a ½ human ½ eagle figure and flipped its beak up, causing a nearby bookshelf to open itself into the wall - a secret door.



A few seconds passed.



“It’s just through there, Crane. At the end of the hall.”



I scanned each man’s waiting gaze but could gauge nothing from them. Finally, I stepped up to the doorway and looked into the darkness within.



“It’s in there?”



“Yes, yes, go ahead. It’s just down there.”



I looked at them, then to the doorway. After a moment, I slowly began my entry.



A short ways into the tunnel, I turned back to see the three men standing at the entrance, watching eagerly. Oggi motioned for me to continue.



“Just a little further, Crane. You’re almost there.”



After a little hesitation, I continued further down the tunnel. Eventually, a door came into view with a small light illuminating male and female symbols at its center. I knew what was behind this door. I’d known as soon as the cowboy had opened the secret passageway in the office. I’d known when the limo pulled up outside the building. But what was I to do? No doubt, if I retreated - ran back the way I came and tried to fight off my assailants - the horde waiting would overpower me and drag me to my doom all the same. No. At least this way, I would go out with some dignity.



As I stepped into the familiar toilet, I was hit with almost a sense of nostalgic comfort. As if the act of returning to a place I knew was enough to provide some semblance of relief, even if what I was walking into was a nightmare. I noticed that each of the stalls was open, and as I peeked into the first, I saw inside a familiar phrase graffitied in big, red letters.



“BEHEAD WEATHER”



I entered the stall, no longer in control of my own limbs.



FWAP.



Suddenly, the door swung shut on its own accord, the latch clicking into place. I fumbled with the lock, but it was stuck.



FWAP.



I looked at the spaces below and above the door - neither wide enough for me to fit through.



FWAP.



The sound was right outside the stall. I took a step back, my leg hitting the toilet bowl.



All sound drained from the room.



The lock clicked.



The door slowly creaked open.



I peered out of the stall and at the empty room.



FWAP. I lifted my head.



Hanging from the ceiling was a creature of which it is impossible for me to describe. An amalgamation of nightmares, coalesced in a single mass of putrid flesh and bile, various faces, eyes, and organs protruding from what one might try to call its head.



As I took a step back into the stall, I was suddenly overwhelmed by the uncontrollable urge to stick my head in the toilet. Anything to escape the sight of the creature as it oozed itself down the wall. Only a second later, I felt my body turn around, watched as my hands grabbed the sides of the toilet, felt the cold water on my face as I stuffed my head inside, and lost myself in the darkness.



Time passed. I could not tell how much or how little. The longer I was stuck in the toilet, the less I was able to form complex thoughts. Soon enough, I could only remember a single phrase.



“BEHEAD WEATHER”



I would repeat it to myself each time the creature returned to do what it always did. It was a mantra of sorts. A way to ignore the horror that I promised myself I would never repeat to any living soul.



At some point, I had a dream. I was sitting on a wooden chair in the center of a public toilet, writing on my clipboard. The room had no stalls, toilets, urinals, sinks, or mirrors. Just a white tile floor and walls.



When I woke up, my foot hit something. I realized it was my clipboard. A surge of adrenaline shot through my deteriorating body as I attempted to drag it closer to me with my foot. When it was finally within reach, I pulled my pen from under the metal clasp. Then, I stabbed it down between my head and the toilet, cutting through my cheek in the process.



Thus, I began the agonizing process of sliding the pen around the inside of the bowl while gently pulling my head upward a millimeter at a time. On multiple occasions, I was certain I was about to slip free, only to be sucked back down into the bowl. The headache I felt was immense, and every ten minutes or so I would have to take a break when the pain became too great.



But, finally, after many hours, I felt my ears pop over the rim, tasted the first breath of “fresh” air I’d consumed in who knows how long, and blinked rapidly as my eyes were overwhelmed by the intense fluorescent light.



I took stock of my body. It was putrid. But - a problem for another time. Now was my chance to escape. I struggled to get to my feet, my legs almost useless. After a couple minutes of massaging them back to life, I stepped out of the stall and exited the room.



I found myself in a \[REDACTED\] office that I would later learn was in \[REDACTED\]. Knowing how I currently appeared - a monster covered in his own filth - I cautiously snuck out by way of a stairwell in the rear of the building. Outside on the streets, no one paid me any mind. I appeared just as any homeless person would, and everyday citizens did their best to ignore me and the horrid stench that followed.



Three days later, I stepped out of my wife’s car in the driveway of our home. I followed Susan inside and collapsed on my bed, where I would stay for the next 18 hours as I slept.



When I finally awoke, Susan forced me to answer the questions of which I had denied her explanations on the phone and in the car. At first, her reaction was sympathy, convinced I had been subjected to some terrible fate (but, obviously, not the one I actually described - for that was impossible). But, in the following days, when I continued to insist the story was true and that I intended to go public, Susan’s mood shifted. First, there was therapy, to which I agreed in the beginning. But when the doctor insisted I be put on various medications, I refused to go. One night, I heard Susan on the phone in the toilet behind the study, whispering to the unseen caller that the only option seemed to be putting me in a mental asylum - just for a short time, of course. The next morning, before Susan woke up, I snuck out of the house, took my car, withdrew all my savings, and drove west.



I am currently sitting in my car outside a service station in \[REDACTED\] as I write this. In the following days, I plan to find a cabin somewhere off-the-grid where I can try to come to terms with what has happened. I haven’t slept more than an hour at a time since I returned home. Every time I close my eyes, I just keep hearing that horrible sound…
