I posted about this on letsnotmeet years ago, not long after the incident took place, but I removed the post as I was scared about being doxxed. It’s been long enough now and my family have moved house so I feel comfortable sharing it, but it seems that sub is no longer very active so I’ll share here even though it’s unfortunately a true story. 


I grew up in a predominantly white country, and my family is white, but the neighbourhood we lived in when I was a teenager had a large East Asian population. It was a nice, middle class neighbourhood with big houses and good schools. Our house had a large window at the front, so the kitchen looked over the road. The kitchen had a breakfast bar where my family and I would eat in the morning or hang out after school or on Saturday nights when we had friends over. 


One morning as we were eating breakfast, my brother and I noticed a car stopped on the street outside our house. There was an Asian woman driving, a teenage girl in the front seat and a younger teenage girl in the back. They stayed for about fifteen minutes without turning the car off and then drove off, so we really didn’t think much of it. 


But the next morning they were back. The same three people were idling in their car outside the front of our house. I suggested maybe the mum was teaching the daughter how to drive, and our house just happened to be where she stopped to teach her the rules of the road. It seemed plausible enough, but when we looked closer, we could see all three of them staring at us through our kitchen window. “Maybe they’re just looking at us because we’re looking at them?” my brother had hopefully suggested. 


Soon any thoughts we had of this being innocent or a coincidence faded. Most mornings and some afternoons, the family was there, engine on, watching us. After a week of this my dad had had enough and decided to go outside and ask them what was going on. Just as he got close enough to tap on their window, they sped off. We’d throw out all sorts of theories, sinister and not, about what they were doing, but nothing made any sense. 


I worked at the local supermarket at the time and one day, a month or so after the visits started, my colleague approached me and said “Hey, you live on XXX Drive, right?” When I told him yes, I did, he told me he’d just heard from a customer that three people had been found dead on my street. Of course I immediately thought of the worst case scenario, that something had happened to my mum, dad and brother, that maybe this family had killed the three of them. I ran off to the break room to call my mum. 


“We’re all fine,” she assured me. “Apparently it was a family from South Korea. The mum put the two kids in the car in their garage and killed them and herself with carbon monoxide.” It was a horrifying story, but I was just relieved my family were alright…until the next day, when we realised the family who watched us from their car didn’t come by. They didn’t come the next day, or the day after that, and we realised they must have been the ones who died. 


After three days of peace, we were sitting in the kitchen when a car slowly rolled down the street and stopped outside our house. It was a different car, but I was hoping to see the family, because as creepy as they were, I took no comfort in the thought that a family who watched us every day died by murder/suicide. But it wasn’t them. It was an Asian man. Engine on, looking in our window. I shouted for my dad who ran outside to talk to him, but the man sped off. 


That evening I was leaving work and I spotted his car in the carpark. I walked past it and the man was asleep in the driver’s seat. The next morning he didn’t visit our house. We thought it might be over. After school I went to work at the supermarket and noticed his car was in the same spot. I thought it was weird, but I was a stupid teenager and lacked the critical thinking skills to do anything about it. I was running late so I went straight in to work my shift. By the time I finished work the carpark was filled with police and an ambulance. 


The man in his car was dead. 


My parents visited the local police station to explain everything that had been going on. The police told them the man was the father of the family who had been living in South Korea and had flown over for the funeral. He had also killed himself, and was likely already dead the first time I saw him in the carpark. No one knew why the family all took their own lives. No one on our street had ever met them or spoken to them. And the police had absolutely no idea why the family had been watching us. Fifteen years later we still don’t know, but it haunts us.
