There's a house in Old Town with a spire that towers above the rest of the little town. The Victorian liveries and French Provincial roof make it the most beautiful home in the area. Even amongst the other ancient homes that share its block, it still manages to stand out as special. It's been owned generationally all its life. Never once up for sale. Even if it was, I could never afford it. I could save every cent of every dollar I'd make in my entire life span, and I wouldn't even have saved half of the amount that building cost.

That house was the first death in my life. Before I could even grasp the concept of casualty, I witnessed the death of an idea. As a kid I always dreamed of living there. My dad would take me for walks around the gardens of the old town. He always loved the sunflower fields that overlooked the river, but I never cared for nature. My eyes were always fixed to the looming home across the street. The family who owned it had freshly painted it a bright sun yellow. The color made the already looming building a giant noticeable splotch of lemon. It not only clashed with the aged wood shingles of the home, but also the surrounding colonial red brick neighborhood. As a child, I hated that they'd ruin such a beautiful building with smudged and awful paint. As an adult, I took it as just another reason the family didn't deserve the building at all.

I don't know if Dad picked up on my disdain for the yellow flowers. They just reminded me of the horrid color of my once stunning home. He picked me up and walked me across the street, the shadow of the spire engulfing us as we walked. The building's color now matching the sun behind it made its vast shadow ironic.
When we climbed the curb we would be met with a tall gothic metal gate. Its dark intimidation once matched the house, until its new sunny disposition. Behind the tall spiked fence was a winding pathway leading to the warped wooden porch of the house.

By the foot of the porch was a large picnic blanket with a family sitting, eating food, drinking juice. The kind of people who look like they were created specifically to be put on the wall of an office building. Every shirt was ironed, every hair in place, every hand clean of dirt. I hated them.

As if noticing my anger, the family looked toward me and my dad. My dad was a kind and shy man. In response to them noticing us, he turned and continued down the sidewalk. But for a brief moment I noticed their faces. The look of anger I gave them was nothing compared to how they looked at us.

Those leeches looked at me and my father like we were extraterrestrial. I thought about their faces all the way out of that neighborhood. All the way to my dad's car. All the way to our little neighborhood. All the way to our trailer.

I never stopped thinking about them, but that day was the last time I thought I could live in that house. It was the last day I would mourn one of my dreams. I grew into the man who could take that home with force.

As I grew I spent night after night studying every person in that home. Every undeserving face. Until the night I killed them all.

You don't wanna hear that story, it's not a very nice one. Though the reality of that house isn't very pleasant either. In truth, the family's demise wasn't interesting. What was interesting was my time in their place. I had the house I had thought about since childhood. I had it for a good few days too. But that's the final trick every rich fuck has hidden underneath their perfectly straight sleeve. There's always someone to come looking for them when they go missing.

But that's getting ahead of myself. After the deed was done and I was covered in heat of the ungrateful family, the first thing I did was take in the room. I cried at the mess I had made of the divine showroom. Carved wooden chair legs now stained with rotten crimson. Victorian damask walls, not papered but painted, were now ruined with brain matter and chunks of who I could only imagine was the family's patron. I had taken my home by force and in that force I had damaged it.

My conquest had left me winded. The only thing that the family's fluid would stain would be the fabric of their unembalmed decor, of which I had plans to burn when the time was right.

I decided to take the night and enjoy a bed I had dreamt about since I was a child. I went to leave the room, noticing the mangled head of the youngest son blocking the way. By a quick inspection, I saw his front row of teeth lay shattered on the floor in front of him, except for two teeth that stood sturdy in the abyss of his mouth. The two structures of enamel were tougher than the rest. Must've had mostly milk teeth. I thought the family was born undeserving of the home; perhaps he was just too young to understand it. I kicked the head to the side, and left the room.
The halls of the first floor were lovingly ornate. Decorative wooden carvings around every archway and cranny. They told the story of a once beloved and cared for hearth. They were carved with the same care and delicate craftsmanship as the frame wrapped lovingly around Napoleon Crossing the Alps, in particular when it found a home in the Louvre. That was until I saw the creations of the former residents.

Jagged and straight slits running up the woodwork of a corner of an archway. The crude and barbaric cuts seemed to have been vandalized there by a pocket knife. Beside each slit, written in bold black Sharpie, were three alternating names. The family had turned the home into a measuring stick. In the morning, I'd tear the woodwork off the wall and burn it with them.

I ascended the stairs, gliding my hand on the smoothly varnished wooden railing. The entire staircase was crafted using walnut shipped down from Canada in the late 1800s. Every step in this place tells a story of the people that built it. I thought about what I'd contribute to it.

The higher I walked up the stairs, the hotter the building felt. Common among old buildings with bad ventilation. Something I imagined would've been a problem for the invaders downstairs. Me on the other hand? I had lived through enough winters with no blankets. The heat wouldn't bother me.
The master bedroom was easy to find on the outside. It was home to the largest window in the building. The window stretched from the floor to the ceiling, and was snapped like a diamond. It was my favorite thing, beside the spire, on the exterior. The interior was harder to navigate.

Open concept was popularized in the nineteen fifties, just about seventy years too late. As such, this house was the opposite of open concept. To most, this would be oppressive, but to me, I found it cozy.

I peeked into every passing room, finding a bathroom and the remaining bedrooms. The master bedroom was the last room I checked, as it was at the end of the hall. The room was as beautiful as the window that framed it.
The room was emanating a red hue from the light leaking in through the crimson sequin curtains. The red moonbeams illuminated the grandiose king sized bed in the center of the room. I waved my hands across the padded comforter. It was already enough cushion to sleep on. I carefully folded it over to reveal the bed underneath.

Lying on that bed felt like snow melting beneath me. It welcomed me with open arms. Like a father's hug, the bed surrounded me. I heard the house's heartbeat in that moment. Silent but echoing. I opened my eyes one last time. What met my gaze was a small picture frame. In it was the family that scorned me and this house. "Just one more piece of kindling," I thought.

The rhythmic thumping grew louder as I stared at the family trapped behind the glass. They looked back at me with the same faces they looked at me with when I was a child. I grabbed the frame and threw it across the room. Marked by the shattering of that picture, my night had come to an end. I clamped my eyes shut, and allowed sleep to overtake me.
I awoke the next morning to a throbbing pain in my foot. The room smelled like berries and copper. I opened my eyes, only now seeing the bloody footprints I had trailed throughout the room. I sat up and felt around for the source of my discomfort. I felt a small abrasion between my big and second toe. When I removed the blanket to reveal my ailment, I was shocked by what I saw—white sharp enamel pointing out from between my two toes.

I pulled it out with mild effort, moving the two toes in an act of relief. I examined the object closely. It was the shattered remains of a small tooth, more than likely belonging to the young boy's head. I thought I had dragged the shard into bed with me that night, where it found a home in my foot. It wasn't much harm, and I had work to do that day. So I tossed it and got ready to start my day.

The closet was verbose: filled to the brim with tailored and fitted suits, and frill-infested dresses. Every article of clothing in the walk-in were the height of high fashion. Despite this, I couldn't help but feel an oppression in the clothing. They had all the money in the world to wear what they wanted, and they wanted to wear the same things every day. Only variation was color. Either way, I had never had the opportunity to wear clothes this majestic.
I tried on everything in the closet. I tried the suits, the coats of which were much too baggy for me. I even tried on the dresses, giving a little twirl to my mirror audience. Before the conquest, the dress would've felt appropriate. Not at that moment. Through blood and bone I had become a man.
I ended up wearing a white colored shirt, covered by a brown wool vest, and black slacks, with a pair of dress shoes to match. I was dressed to the nines. I, however, couldn't afford any more procrastination. Time to get to work.

I walked through the warm hallway down the stairs, taking extra care not to drag my feet against the fine wood. The first floor felt cool and frigid in the morning air. The window I had smashed the day prior was greedily sucking the hot air out of the home. I didn't feel remorse for the window like I usually would. It was an addition the family made years prior.
I turned the corner to the site of my grand retribution, but something was wrong. The air was not right in that house. It was too clean. And when I peered into the room, the air was not lying. It was spotless. Not a body in sight. Not a speck of red or bone. My mouth was agape. The trail of blood I left last night started at the doorway of that room. It was the last remnant of my crime. I wasn't sure if I should be overjoyed or worried. Perhaps the house was looking out for me in that moment. I now know it was not so positive.

I decided it was best not to dwell on it. My trust in the house was all I had. I wouldn't squander that by asking questions. So in an act of repayment, I cleaned the rest of her halls. I cleaned up my footsteps, I dusted untouched crevices, I cut out any signs of defilement from the family before me. I showed my love to the home in every action I performed. Until I saw an anomaly.

The young boy's shattered and severed head lay in the center of the living room. His eyes, fully drained of life, stared up at me. Much like Medusa's, they turned me to stone. Not from guilt, not from fear, but from contempt. He dared defy the house's will? He was at that moment an intruder in my home. I grabbed the head by what remained of its hairy scalp, marched it to the basement, the house cracking and creaking at every step I took. Footsteps turning into the home's heartbeat. I introduced the head to the furnace, throwing it in with a lack of delicacy the situation had earned.

I marched back up the stairs, sweat still lingering on my cold body from the heat of my anger. I slammed my withered body onto the chaise lounge in the showroom. A sharp pain ran up my body. The source was my ankle. I pulled my pant leg up to inspect the wound. What looked back at me was the head of a small shard of tooth planted perfectly in the back of my ankle.

I pulled the tooth out, deciding this time to pocket it. I knew what this was. It was retribution. The head was gone now. No more left teeth to bite me with. The house was clean. I was the victor.

I stood up from my position on the small fainting couch and walked to the kitchen, now with a noticeable limp. At least, it was noticeable to me.

The kitchen was stocked brilliantly, between the utensils and ingredients. If I hadn't prepared my skills in cooking for years prior, the kitchen would've felt out of my league. Even with my mastery of culinary arts, the kitchen was still finer than anything I deserved. I prepared a prime rib steak, with mushroom sauce drizzled along the edge, complete with a side of mashed potatoes sprinkled with fresh truffles. The side took the longest, but I had never had the opportunity to work with fresh truffles before. For all the effort, I couldn't notice a difference.
I sat at the edge of a large dining table, the length of which elongated the room entirely. A candle was lit in front of me. I could've lit it myself. I don't remember exactly, but I like to think it was a sign of the house welcoming me formally. By the time I had finished my food, the wick had burned a quarter of the way down.

The wax built up at the bottom of the candlestick. Without anything to catch the drippings, it created hard white droplets on an otherwise pristine dinner table. It was a nice moment; I figured I'd clean it up in the morning. Perhaps it's neurotic of me, but it bothers me to this day that I never got the chance.

I cleaned my plate in the sink, finished the rest of my glass of wine, and started the long climb up to my bedroom. I stripped off my clothes, adding them to the pile of loosely discarded clothing from the morning. I wanted to feel the warmth of the bed without clothing interference.

The comforter wrapped around my body. The fabric smelt like a familiar dust, one long removed from my senses, but one I could barely taste. I ducked my head underneath to feel the warmth and darkness. It was like a cocoon. Or more aptly, a mother's womb. I was the house's newest child; tomorrow I would be born.

There was no sound when I woke. No screaming, no doctors. No manger, no stars. Only cold stone and the thick smell of a burning furnace. I eyed the glowing visage of its rusted iron grate. I stared up at it, my left eye still feeling the cold radiating off of the floor. I was too weak to stand. I lay there, naked and exposed. I was a newborn and my predator was the cold.

I clawed at the floor. The warmth from the furnace would save me, I knew that. I clenched at the smooth stone beneath me, inching my way slowly toward the light. I was a sea turtle and the fire was my ocean tide. When the time came, and I felt the first ember of heat, it was only then that I cried. Once my body was warm, I felt my strength return to me. I sat up, my back to the furnace. It was in the light that I saw myself. I was pale, my fingers bright red. I didn't know how long I had been in that basement or how I got there, but I knew I had to leave.

I spent some time sitting by the fire, at one point even opening the grate to hopefully heat up the rest of the room. However, the darkness that enveloped my surroundings was all encompassing. The only semblance of a real object was the furnace. The greater landscape didn't exist to me.

I felt the strength to stand. My legs wobbled but I made it upright. It was then that I felt the heat in my head. The blood was pulsating through the inside of my skull. It pounded and vibrated like it was trying to bust out through my eyes. I knew what this feeling was. I had a fever.

My situation was dire. I could've ventured in the dark and up the stairs, but I saw no proof that they would be where I had left them. I was not a fool. The house had moved me here in my sleep. I thought it was testing me.
To my luck, the house had granted me a boon. It came in the shape of a wooden stick. When examined in the light, I realized it wasn't just any stick. It was the corner of the archway, the ones with the height lines cut into it.

It felt fitting. A previous act of territorial vandalism would burn brightly as my torch—like killing two birds with one stone. I found a dry cloth wrapped around one of the pipes jutting out of the furnace. I wrapped it around the stick and lit it ablaze.

The furnace had granted me all that it could. I closed its visage shut, said my goodbyes, then set off, giving it just one last glance before entering the void.

The heat from the torch only kept me superficially warm. I was still exposed, a fact that was only exaggerated by my new dark surroundings. I started looking around where the stairs had been the morning prior. My suspicions were confirmed that they were no longer there.

I kept on my journey, at first in search for the missing stairs, then for something to cover myself with. I stumbled across a pair of ancient and half-rotten suitcases and trunks, the contents of which were mostly destroyed, except for a gray and scratchy wool blanket stuffed unceremoniously underneath destroyed or worthless trinkets. I wrapped it around me, turning the blanket into my cloak.
Whenever the fire dimmed I would tear a bit of cloth off the foot of the cloak. It would work for a while, but the fabric had become a finite resource. I would need to keep searching for more sustainable light.

I walked; my feet eventually started bleeding. The cold stone would burn the cuts and blisters covering the surface of my bare feet. I walked, having no company to keep me sane. The torch became my only friend. I never gave him a name. Didn't want to have to mourn. If I moved out of this place I couldn't bring him with me. The torch was made of desecrated wood. A part of me always hated him for that.
I walked, passing the boxes and trunks. Each one chronicling the different owners of the house. I'd find East India Trading Company charters, packed neatly next to souvenirs from the world's largest shoe.

I walked, but my eyes never adjusted to my darkness. I was never made at home there. I had seen light in the house; I was not equipped to see the dark. I never feared that a monster was lurking around me. I only feared what I couldn't do. What if I couldn't find an exit? What if I wandered forever? I knew I could kill a predator. I had killed five of them the moment I entered this building.

I passed by the trunks but they meant nothing to me. Not anymore. They were worthless memories, lost by worthless people. I now know what that basement was. It was where the people who wasted the home's time went. I never found anything belonging to the builders, the men who fought to bring beauty to the halls. The ones who didn't simply inherit and live. The ones who fought and claimed. I mourned my situation. I had fought for the house, but I squandered that effort by living like the family before me. I wouldn't make that mistake again. I walked.

At one point, I lost my torch. Whether from exhaustion or indifference, it slipped from my hand, crackling to the floor, the flame snuffed out. I didn't give it a moment to part. I just kept moving. I couldn't see it anymore anyway. It changed nothing anyway. I still walked. Only now did I smell the dust.

I could've been walking for years, or maybe an hour. Eventually, in my blindness, I hit something. My hand hit it first, then the rest of my body. A wall. Just as cold as the floor. I felt the wall like it was the body of my soulmate. Only then did I feel an ornament that proved my assessment wrong. This wasn't a wall; it had a doorknob.

I wrapped my hand around the brass ball, barely believing it was even there. Not believing it'd turn at all. Slowly, and as gently as one holds a child, I turned it, allowing all my worry to disappear as the stone door opened, revealing the first bit of light I'd seen since my torch died.

I struggled to walk through, light almost as suffocating as the darkness was when I had first awoken. But I was only afraid of what I couldn't do. I could walk through that door. I took my hands on either side of the archway, and pulled myself through.

I fell to the ground on the other side. The heat of my surroundings was oppressive. I flipped myself onto my back. I saw something that gave me pause. The door I had entered through was left ajar, but a deep and dark basement void wasn't on the other side. On the other side of the door was a bathroom, one from the turn of the century. Pink subway tiles arched their way across a small domed ceiling.

A quick inspection of my surroundings revealed that the hallway was also pink, but not tiled. Pink and cream wallpaper dotted the hallway. Parts of it were peeling, and water damage ravaged the ceiling. I stood to take in my position better, feeling the blisters on my feet as I did. Looking down in the light, I saw that they were blisters at all; they were clusters of sharp white ivory teeth.

I didn't make much of a fuss about them. I was already used to the pain. I just limped my way down the pink corridor, the teeth growing further away from my mind with each step.
The halls never changed in their dingy consistency, nor in their emptiness. The pink hue dulled my vision almost worse than the darkness. The lack of complimentary colors allowed the halls to blend together in one big meaty cacophony. Like someone painted walls with bits of stomach, and tiled with bone marrow. The rooms were the color of Pepto-Bismol, and it was making me nauseous.

Any furniture was sopping wet. They lacked almost any hue of color, turned saturated by what I could only imagine were years of hydration. They were falling to pieces, no less destroyed than the forgotten boxes and trunks in the cold void I had left behind me.

The halls had no rhythm. They jutted and spun and warped in never-ending corners and halls. No one yard the same as the last, all making up a long and endless tract of pink. Was this some lost floor? Hidden behind the walls of the yellow spired house? At that moment, I was its sole inhabitant. The hallways were made with no architectural logic in mind, some outright twisting at my presence. Floorboards often splintering against unexpected edges, almost creating patches of wood splintered grass.

I imagine those halls are how a gerbil feels, trapped in colorful tubes and cages. Little useless ornaments meant to keep it from losing its sanity.

The halls made very little noise outside of my limping footsteps. Every so often the sound of light dripping could be heard from the overflowing puddles in the ceiling. The drippings provided me with much-needed drinking water, and the occasional splash of something cold. The heat in the halls was overbearing, only exacerbated by my body's adaptation to the cold of the basement abyss.
The only other sound that reverberated through the halls was a drum beat, a hum subtle at first but as I walked, ear-piercing.
Closer and closer I limped toward the heartbeating drum. Blood dripped from the holes in the side of my head. I'd clean the blood trails off with an edge of my itchy cloak, the bottom of which had become damp from the moisture. After the twentieth time, I gave up cleaning them entirely. I never tried to find the source of the bleeding. I figured I'd only find more teeth growing inside. Instead, I walked.

The wallpaper of the halls became wet and sopping the longer I limped across each board, my toothed foot crunching down on the withered plank like a dog chewing on bone. It splintered underneath, causing splinters to shred the unenamelled parts of my leg. I barely registered the pain above the sonic booms ringing in my bleeding eardrums. The heartbeat became a ticking clock. How long would I last in that infinity? It was digestion, slow and melting.

That was until the noise shifted. It would've been barely perceivable if I hadn't been a captive listener to its song. The beat had shifted slightly to my left ear. It could've been my right ear going deaf, but I had faith. The house had given me a clue. The sound wasn't omnipresent; it was emanating from something. I could find the source.
With newfound purpose, newfound drive, and newfound retribution, I marched to the noise. My footsteps and its stoic beat creating an orchestra in opposition. Two drummers in opposition. One stoic, locked in place, laying in wait. The other, a hunter, coming to snuff out its drum beat.

I marched. I was a soldier now, going to kill the enemy. If I was born anew in that basement, these halls grew me up strong and capable. The house was my mother. These haunted rooms and halls were like a father—rigid, hard, and disciplined.
I took the leg of a soggy and grimy sofa, not as a tool, but as a weapon. The ornate carving on the warped wood made it closer to a ceremonial shillelagh than any primitive club. It would be perfect.

The booming of the beat far passed any decibel point I had ever heard up until this point. I knew I was close. The left wall was vibrating. I kept my hand on it as I walked. Thump, thump, thump. Step, step, step. Until I saw it: an old, rusted grandfather clock.
It stood tall, taller than any piece of furniture I'd seen in this place. At my appearance the wise old clock sprung to life. Its door opening on its own, revealing not gears and pendulums, but entrails and meat. Blood trailed out from the bottom of the opening, like it was a newly opened wound.
The entrails moved back and forth, wiggling and dancing to the beat of the overwhelming drum. I approached carefully, shillelagh at the ready. In response the clock slowly stopped its movement. Guts and organs slowing their dance until they did nothing but droop half-heartedly. Whatever life the clock had in that hall had ended, even as an attacker. I was happy I could witness it.

The conic booms did not end with the death of the clock, however. It still shook the walls of the endless pink corridor. I marched closer, touching the side of the clock. The carved livery was made in the style of George Graham—gold rims around the clock itself, with smooth wood surfaces, beside the artistic wear and tear only time can produce. He was beautiful, but he was in my way.
I planted my toothed foot on the side of the clock and pushed it. It toppled over with a sharp crunch. Any remaining blood drizzled out the side, creating a crimson mirror pool. I saw myself in the depths of that puddle of iron. What looked back at me was survival incarnate.

I turned my attention back to the pulsating wall behind the clock, my target hiding behind the fleshy wallpaper of the hall. I wielded my weapon high into the air and slammed it down onto the wall. A crash rang out followed by a mighty roar. The drum beat sounded faster, more erratic. I had found my prey, and it was scared.

I slammed the wall again, and again, and again. The wood behind the pink paper didn't splinter; it was too wet for that. It simply cracked and bent out of place. After the fourth swing, a dusty old room revealed itself. Behind the fragments of wood and wallpaper stood tall the living room of the house, now dark and damp as the hall I stood in.

I fell into it, happy to see her again. I grabbed at the floor, wrapping the carpet in my arms. Two lovers intertwined. My happiness, however, was short lived. I felt the presence of something foreign in the room with us.
I looked up at the sofa and saw five familiar and wicked figures. It was the family: shriveled and rotten, pieced loosely back together with nails, scraps of wood, and loose wires. Their eye sockets were empty, but I could feel the emptiness staring at me.
They were huddled together, shivering like they understood what the cold was. These monsters had cursed this house in life. In death they were parasitic, using its body to keep theirs alive. Parasites in life and death.
I started with the eldest daughter, cracking her weak and rotten head open with one swing of my club. Then her little sister, grabbing her jaw and tearing it. The father tried to fight back but one hit from the club had him on the ground. His head didn't hold up against my boot.

The mother and the son were curled up in the corner, sharing little whispers of comfort to one another. None of it was legible; their vocal cords were probably rotted through. I only made out four distorted, weak words. The mother said, "I love you honey." She was a liar to the end. The rich aren't capable of feelings.
I had made a mess of the room again, this time over top of my original mess. The monument of two identical battles. In all the commotion I hadn't realized the elephant in the room, however. The drum beat had not stopped, and it was coming from behind the sofa. Any attempts to move it were met with failure.

The room was dark, the windows barricaded by wallpaper. Any attempt to peel it only revealed more layers of paper, all with different patterns and colors. I felt around the pockets of the decrepit family. The cloth that warped itself around their bodies was soft, vibrant, and beautiful. However, the bodies they encased were nothing short of grotesque—shriveled and dark, as if I had dug up bodies from a century prior.

I acted as any graverobber would. I looted them for something useful. Luckily for me I found something. The father had a lighter paired with a full pack of cigarettes. He even had wearable clothes. I stripped the corpse, revealing more inorganic Frankenstein parts. Parts of his skin had been supplemented with bits of wallpaper. With my scavenge outfit, I threw off my cloak, allowing it to fall to the ground. It served me well. It would be missed.
I lit the lighter and shined it at the foot of the couch, revealing what had been stopping it. The leg was nailed down to the floor. An easy enough fix. I took ahold of my club and slammed all four legs until they were torn from the couch. Moving it after that was as simple as the clock outside.

As I pulled the couch to the floor, I finally saw what had been causing the drum beat: wires and pipes and splintery wooden roots pulsated in a small cubby in the wall. In the center of the mess of wood and copper was something I had seen before—the picture of the family, the one that had stared at me from the end table of my bed. Shards of broken glass still gathered around the edges of the frame.

The family had bewitched the house, burning themselves into her heart. At that moment, my mark on the house would be set in stone. With one motion, I brought the lighter to the picture and set it ablaze.

Within seconds, the pulsating mass went up in flames. The heartbeat thumped and echoed throughout the room. A loud groan could be heard along with the house shifting. Embers bellowed out of the cubby, spreading the fire to the floor and carpet. Its flames absorbed the bodies and spread to the wallpaper window, burning away each layer until it revealed something behind it. A cold gust of wind blew into the room. The smell of midnight air wafted into my nose for the first time in what felt like a century. I was prepared to let the flames take me, but I knew in that moment that I was meant to live.

I ran past the cursed dead. They deserved hellfire; I delivered it to them. I dove headfirst through the window, landing without an ounce of grace. I hit my head on the fall, a fall that was only partially broken by the grass beneath me. I didn't have time to take in the pain. I had to stand up. I had to find help.

The house's cries echoed into the night sky, its windows glowing from the growing flames inside her. I couldn't find the strength to stand. I had spent years in her dungeon. My body had finally given up. My leg was nothing more than an ivory stump. My ears drowning in blood. I was forced to lie there—sick and weak and broken.

Eventually I found the strength to crawl. I moved toward the shelter of a bush that acted as a perimeter of the property and collapsed in its embrace. Me and the bush had front row seats to my act of matricide.

Eventually the firefighters came and snuffed out the flame. The house was burned from the inside out. They went in looking for the bodies of the wicked family that caused this whole mess, not sparing a single man to check on the house's condition.

I lay there for hours, watching the men scramble. They pulled the bodies out of the shell of the house and dragged them away to be identified. I would learn later that they believed internal damage was to blame for the fire. They found an obtusion lodged inside one of the walls, causing an outlet to burn from the inside of the wall.

The family was a tumor on the house. My contribution to its legacy was burning out that tumor. In the end, I lost the leg. The teeth had disappeared by the time I reached the hospital, days after the fire. All that was left was a rotted foot.

My ears were no better, requiring the use of hearing aids. They said it was "sudden sensorineural hearing loss," brought on most likely by head trauma. I didn't let my injuries tear me down. I went to school, got my degree with full honors, and became an architect. I wore my inspirations on my shoulders. Any chance I got I would immortalize aspects of my mother home into my buildings. In some ways, I passed on my mother's bloodline through my designs.

She still stands there, tall and looming over the red brick homes of Old Town. I like to take my son there, like my father before me. We stare up at the great spire, take in the concave roof, and appreciate the new charcoal-painted facade. Not a spot of that ugly yellow remains. The spire peaks up into the sky, as black as ash or the void I was born in.

The change in weather has a funny way of digging up old feelings for me. A yearly rotation of nostalgia. Standing past the gate becomes much harder around this time of year, but the cold makes me yearn for the heat of her hallways. Maybe one day a new buyer will come along. Maybe they'll try to build a home. Maybe they'll ruin her and I'll have to get back to work. Until then, the wind blows through her once silent walls. Some say the sounds are just that, the wind. I alone know the truth. She's crying.
