**Entry 1. Thursday, January 6th, 2022**

Alright. I cannot believe I am stooping to this level, but quite frankly, there isn’t much else to do. I could:

1. Ruminate over my inauspicious circumstances, wallow in self-pity, and listen for any indication of life above my head. 
2. See how far I can spit. Perhaps with some practice, I’d reach the rat droppings (at least I *think* they’re rat droppings?) at the other end of the room. But then again, I’d require head momentum, which is in limited supply these days.
3. Defecate and assess whether rashes truly form quicker on chafed skin. 

Over the past four days, I’d already done all of those things. Multiple times. Well, except for that last one. Shitting myself once proved to be plenty. I’d hoped it’d provide a pretense to see more of the house, but Mrs. Ingram took one whiff and said she’d let me stew in it to *“teach me a lesson”*. 

And teach me a lesson it had. After sitting in my own dung for a couple of days, I was much obliged to relieve myself into the bucket she brought by twice a day. 

“Once after breakfast and once after dinner,” she coached, her expression indecipherable, as though she had done this a million times prior, “Your bladder will adapt with time.”

An objection bubbled up in my throat, but Mrs. Ingram wagged her index finger like I was a snot-nosed kindergartener gnawing on a piece of Jenga.

“Five more days,” her eyes flickered, “Like we agreed.”

Five days! Even Aron Ralston lasted longer than that in 127 Hours, although, of course, he wasn’t getting hash browns served to him at breakfast. Granted, at this point, I’d been here for five days already. And as for my alleged consent… Well! I took her word for it. 

See, the contextual clues were sparse enough as it was. The flashy New Year’s party I’d attended with the other writers from the magazine was the last thing I remembered. Janine had gotten piss drunk and passed out in one of the bathroom stalls. Even the Armani floor tiles couldn’t save her teeth. 

I spent the first two hours of 2022 camped out on a bench near the hospital entrance with a makeshift flask and a packet of smokes for company, when my sight was obscured by a black duffel. I suppose I could have simply passed out from the booze - three Jacks, seven tequila shots, and some obscure German lager certainly made that a feasible possibility. All the same though, the suffocating wool against my skin, the flutter of stomach acid, the subtle scent of chloroform… Or was it the cherry vodka in my flask..?

My body was already neatly strapped in when I awoke. Secured to what felt like an adjustable examination table, my back pin-straight with only minor leeway for movement. 

In retrospect, it wasn’t all too uncomfortable. Or at least, I could appreciate how it could have been much worse. My ankles appeared to be clamped down, but my hands were mostly free to roam. Not that there was much point in plowing the air. Still, I thrashed about like the big man I was, until the sentiment sunk in and I settled down enough to examine my surroundings.

The room was dimly lit but bright enough for me to make out its fissured ceiling and coarse, discolored walls. Wooden racks towered against them, laden with books, boxes, and plastic rubbish bags. I could not see a door, but a narrow ascending staircase suggested that it was simply out of my line of sight. All in all, the room resembled a run-of-the-mill cellar. 

“Hello?” I called out, the back of my throat plastered with cigarette tar. Well, the health warnings on the packs had certainly delivered, “Hello, anyone there?”

Footsteps feathered the top of the stairs and began their gradual descent. I held my breath. If there *was* a door at the top of the stairs, it had never opened. Whoever the footsteps belonged to had been hiding out in the darkness and listening, waiting. 

“Oliver?” Her voice was surprisingly demure, dwindling my expectation of a callous executioner into obscurity. Perhaps this was a *contemporary* remake of the Hostel series? Inclusivity is popular nowadays. Surely, this woman was just as capable of cutting my face off as the guy in the movie. Better, even. With cleaner cuts? I’d read somewhere that women have steadier hands. Although, I couldn’t actually see her. Whoever she was, she remained shrouded by darkness, “Oliver Cohen?”

I gawked as she moved close enough for the amber ceiling light to touch her face. She wasn’t nearly as delicate as her voice had made her seem. Standing at about five-foot-nine, she was stout and in her early fifties. Her graying hair was pulled into a tight bun and the short-sleeved blouse she wore under her white apron showcased a pair of well-built arms.

“Oliver,” she repeated, a sudden curtness in her tone indicating her capacity for pleasantries was running out.

“Y-yes,” I smacked my dry lips, “Oliver.”

She took a step closer and I recoiled about two inches, which was just about as far as my confines would allow. A waft of body odor emanated from beneath the collar of my shirt, “Wait! Don’t! What do you… W-where am I?”

Concern shrouded her expression and I couldn’t help thinking how in any other context, this woman would have surely been the protagonist. 

“It’s alright, son,” she held out her outstretched palms, an overt demonstration of benevolence, “It’s only a temporary arrangement.” 

“Where am I?” I demanded, doing my best to keep my tone from wavering.

She exhaled slowly as she considered my question.

“You’re in the Ingram home,” she said eventually, “Our guest.”

A patch of gooseflesh cropped up beneath my shirt as I mulled over the very real possibility the woman in front of me was clinically insane. Did she — *or they* — make it a habit to chain their guests in the cellar? If so, I needed to change my tactics, and fast.

“Mrs. Ingram,” I spoke with the cadence of a seasoned reporter, praying she wouldn’t pick up on the quiver in my voice, “Can you tell me what happened?”

I felt like a fool and sounded even worse, but Mrs. Ingram didn’t bat an eye.

“You showed up at Hopleigh Hospital late last night with your friend,” she stated just as matter-of-factly, “The girl with missing teeth.”

“Janine,” I muttered under my breath. She’d be wondering where in God’s name I’d disappeared to. 

“While you were in the waiting area, my colleague Anita asked if she could put you down for a social experiment conducted by our Neurology department,” she paused as if to give me a chance to object, but I knew better than that, “We were thrilled when you agreed to partake.”

A decade of journalism experience couldn’t distill the stunned silence that ensued. She was *lying* to me. Deceiving me right to my face. Sure, I’d been inebriated, but not to the degree I’d do something that extends so far beyond my comfort zone. And not nearly enough to forget the chloroform duffel over my face…

But wait. Did she say ‘*neurology department*’? Could she be lying to me on purpose? Was this a part of the experiment? *Was that even legal?* I thought back to the Milgram experiment I’d researched a couple of months prior. Was all this but a cleverly designed simulation?

“An-and this experiment,” my chest felt tighter now, and the odor under my shirt - considerably more pungent.

“Social experiment,” she corrected, observing me with keen interest, “It will run for a total of ten days. No action is required on your part. You are to remain where you are for the entire duration. You will spend the first five days… acclimating to your surroundings, but the five that follow will be a little more… stimulating.”

Nothing in her tone suggested malice, but the way she said it unnerved me. 

I swallowed, “W-what’s on day five?”

It seemed as though my apparent fear amused her. 

“Nothing to be concerned about,” she smiled, “You’ll only have to do the thing you do best.”

An intricate web of scenarios spun through my mind. *She’ll ask me to fuck her, won’t she?* No. That’s… that’s really weird, Oliver, why even think that? *She’ll probably use me as a piece of furniture.* That’s a kink, isn’t it? That must be why she’s keeping me in this position. To prep me for—

I could see her eyeing me with blatant curiosity, “I thought you were a journalist?”

“What?” I sputtered, my brain working overtime to connect the two, “I mean, yes! Yes, I am.” 

*How in God’s grass-fed earth did she know that?*

“At least that’s what you indicated in the form you filled out,” she added sheepishly, but her eyes gleamed, “You work for Affleur magazine?”

I nodded, despite having no recollection of filling out any form. Of course, I wasn’t exactly a cashier at a local newsagent. Affleur was a substantial publication with global offices, its own television channel, and Armani-tiled bathrooms. *Perhaps she simply recognized me? Was the deceit purposeful? Could I have really signed off on something I don’t remember?* 

“In that case, the second part of the experiment should be a breeze,” the corners of Mrs. Ingram’s mouth quivered, as though she was stifling a smile, “All you’ll have to do is write!”

In spite of myself, I heaved a sigh of relief as the mental images of senile pornography and human furniture ebbed from my mind. 

Write. All I’ll have to do is write.



**Entry 2. Friday, January 7th, 2022**

You know, at first, I employed methodical defiance. I mean, despite her best efforts to convince me, I was certain that, wasted or sober, I had never explicitly agreed to be locked up in Mrs. Ingram’s cellar. *Social experiment, my ass!* Why should I bother adhering to any of her demands, even if it was as natural to me as writing? 

Granted, I started with a measured approach. I figured that if this really *was* a social experiment, I should be able to withdraw my consent at any point. *Right?* During the Milgram experiment, its participants were led to believe that their involvement was compulsory, despite that not being the case. So, I figured all I really had to do was keep asking. But Mrs. Ingram’s continued denial of my requests to “opt out” of the cellar newsletter only upped my resolve, eventually resulting in the infamous butt rash.

After that ill-famed day, I gave up my feeble attempts at protest. I figured that under the autocratic cellar rule, dissent would do more harm than good. 

“Anything you want,” she told me, after I had inquired whether she wanted a specific genre, “I am not the target audience.”

She refused to elaborate further, but she wasn’t exactly asking me to run a dairy farm. I was a journalist, for God’s sake. I could write. And what’s more: 

1. I could not refute the possibility that Mrs. Ingram was, in fact, crazy. While no expert on human psychology, I was certain that tantrums and retaliation were ill-advised when dealing with nutjobs.
2. If writing several journal entries was what was required to complete this alleged ‘social experiment’, then wouldn’t I be extending my stay by demonstrating overt non-compliance?
3. I grew bored. Painfully so. 

So, I picked up the plastic pen and notepad Mrs. Ingram had graciously supplied me with and started writing, assuring myself that my entries would put Stephen King’s Misery to shame. I mean, my situation was inherently worse, *wasn’t it?* Paul Sheldon hadn’t been tied to a chair. Wait, *had he?* I mean, I guess my legs weren’t broken (yet!) and Mrs. Ingram wasn’t demanding I write an entire novel (yet…), but—

“Hello,” a nasally voice said. My eyes shot up from my page, “Who are you?”

I squinted into the darkness in front of me. A young man was watching me from the middle of the staircase. About twenty-five, he sported an Adidas shirt and a botched goatee.

“I, uh…” the pen was suddenly slick between my fingers, “I’m Oliver.”

The man seemed to deliberate this for a moment, “Oh, okay.”

*Okay?* Just *‘okay’?* He wasn’t at all surprised to find a man tied to a chair in his basement?

“And… and what is *your* name?” I asked, as colloquially as I could muster. He seemed distant and uninvested. I typically encountered this when interviewing children and knew a change of tone was in order, “I… I haven’t seen you around!”

He shrugged, “I’m not allowed to come down here.”

I stared at him in stunned silence. *Wasn’t the guy going on thirty?* 

“You know,” he cleared his throat, “I really hope you’re the one… Mom’s tired.”

A slow chill started creeping up my spine and I held my breath, waiting for him to elaborate, but he stood silent. *So this was the son,* I thought. His gauche posture and disheveled appearance set him apart quite a bit from his mother. I realized a little too late that he had disregarded my initial question, but somehow his name no longer seemed relevant.

“W-what do you mean *‘I’m the one’*?” I tried to keep my voice level. One of the key principles of interviewing children was maintaining a positive approach while using clear and concise language. And yet the man in front of me was not a child… *And what the hell did he mean by ‘Mom’s tired’?*

“Gordon!” Mrs. Ingram’s voice sounded at the top of the stairs, “Gordon, didn’t I tell you not to go down there? Come here this instant!”

Gordon held my gaze for a moment and then turned on his heel, obediently trudging back up the stairs. Just before the door slammed shut, I overheard Mrs. Ingram hiss, “Go play with your train set until dinner.”

I stared into darkness, my head ringing. 

“What the fuck,” I whispered to whatever skeletons lurked in the darkness of the Ingram home, “What. The. Actual. Fuck.”

Mrs. Ingram came downstairs again during dinner.

“I apologize for the earlier misunderstanding,” her tone was laced with sympathy, “I’ve told my son countless times not to disturb our guests, but… Well, I suppose curiosity is the wick in the candle of learning!”

She paused as if waiting for me to bring up the other famous saying about curiosity. When I didn’t, she continued.

“Gordon has…” she trailed off, “A condition. Social cues are challenging for him.”

I wondered what she expected me to say. I mean, this certainly shed some light on the peculiar mother-son dynamic I’d witnessed earlier, but didn’t explain the meaning behind Gordon’s strange phrasing. Still, I sure as hell wasn’t going to ask Mrs. Ingram about it.

“I’m sorry,” I mumbled.

But she shook her head, “No need to be sorry. We have our hurdles, but we manage. I am doing all that I can to give Gordon the life he deserves.”

She dabbed her eyes with the back of her sleeve.

“Here now, eat. You must be starving. I will come by later with your bucket.”



**Entry 3. Saturday, January 8th, 2022**

Gordon snuck downstairs again the following day. Albeit having no real means of telling the time, I knew it must have been early. At first I thought it was Mrs. Ingram with my breakfast and in spite of myself, I perked up. 

Mrs. Ingram was a fantastic cook, serving up full homemade meals three times a day without fail. Her breakfasts were particularly immaculate, with strips of crispy bacon, sunny-side-up eggs, and golden hash browns.

“You need to keep your energy up,” Mrs. Ingram remarked, loosening the stiff restraint around my neck, “Mental labor *is* labor.”

Honestly, the food was so good, I wouldn’t have minded if the Ingrams were, in fact, trying to “fatten me up” for their own Thanksgiving feast. Almost jittery with delight, I drew in a lungful of air in hopes of smelling what she’d cooked for me that day.

My jaw clenched at his nasal greeting, but my disappointment was promptly replaced with frenzy. Without so much as a head nod, I ranked my questions in terms of importance and perceived appropriateness. Mrs. Ingram had been visibly upset the previous night, and her family history seemed no less than harrowing. 

Perhaps her son simply longed for light conversation? Some noncommittal small talk with a stranger. Maybe instead of over-analysing his remarks, I ought to be focusing on my upcoming release. After all, I technically only had to endure two more days of this. Today didn’t co—

“Hello,” Gordon repeated, louder, an edge to his tone, “Are you sleeping?”

His question confused me since I was certain he could see that I was awake. Wait. He wasn’t blind, was he? 

“Hello, Gordon,” I raised my hand as if to test my theory. He responded with the same and I heaved a sigh of relief, “What are you doing up so early?”

“I came to say goodbye.”

Alarms blared in my mind, “*Goodbye?*”

He nodded solemnly, turning on his heel and heading back upstairs, when I realized the gravity of my mistake. 

“*No!* Gordon, don’t go! I was just— Look, I am not sure I caught your m— I am not sure what you meant.”

He paused, uncertainty etched into his lips.

“Good-bye,” he enunciated, as if he thought I was dense, “Good-bye and good-luck.”

Gordon flashed a toothy smile and stuck out a thumbs-up sign as if I’d just won a free milkshake at a drive-thru. 

“Gordon,” I began, trying to keep my voice steady, “Do… Do you know why I’m here?”

He nodded eagerly, “My mom is a doctor.”

This didn’t clear anything up, so I tried again, “Gordon—”

“Every time I come here, there’s a new one,” he piped up again, “A new man that needs help.”

I blinked, my lungs suddenly devoid of air, “*Help?*”

He furrowed his brow, “Mom said you’re very sick… What do you have?”

“But I…” my throat was dry, “I’m not *sick?*”

Gordon let out a nasally chortle. 

“If mom can fix you,” he said, matter-of-factly, “Then all will be well. She is a doctor and that is what she says sometimes. *All will be well*. But if she can’t…”

A thud sounded upstairs and Gordon shot an apprehensive glance towards the door.

“I have to go now,” he said, pressing his index finger to his lips.

With that, he disappeared into the darkness, leaving me with a myriad of unanswered questions, a stripe of gooseflesh, and a creeping sense of impending doom. 



**Entry 4. Sunday, January 9th, 2022**

“You haven’t written very much,” Mrs. Ingram remarked, looking over my measly bundle of pages, “I was expecting a bit more from an up-and-coming journalist. ”

I was about to tell her that this *“up-and-coming journalist”* got to drink first-rate brandy on weekdays and ride in limousines with C-list actors, but decided to hold my tongue. She didn’t seem like the type to be impressed by lavish booze and celebrity gossip.

“Sorry,” I muttered, “I’ll get more done tonight.”

But Mrs. Ingram shook her head.

“I am afraid we are out of time. You’ll have to do it during the procedure.”

My blood ran cold.

“Wh-what procedure?”

I was convinced she’d get me to do something lighthearted like ‘sign my release forms’, but her expression was deadpan.

“It’s time, Oliver,” she placed a hand on my shoulder, causing an immediate outbreak of goosebumps, “Your ten days are almost up. Time to see if the effort was worth it.”

I gawked at her, stupefied, “What do you mean?”

But she was silent, turning her back to me and retrieving a cardboard box from one of the wooden shelf compartments.

“I am a trained surgeon,” she affirmed, as though this was somehow a redeeming factor, “So you are in capable hands. Brain surgery is my bread and butter at Hopleigh Hospital, although the typical procedure is not quite…”

Blood seeped into my eyelids, painting the entire room a bright red hue. 

“Wait!” I protested, “*Brain* surgery?! Mrs. Ingram, please. Please. Seriously. Look, I don’t need—”

But she raised her palm, “I know.”

There was a moment of deafening silence.

“I know you don’t *need* brain surgery, Oliver,” she said once the quiet got too much to bear, “But my son, Gordon, *does* need a new brain. His condition has no known cure. And…”

She turned away again to rummage through the box she had picked up, but I could hear the rigidity in her jaw as she continued, “...And as his mother… I *have* to find one.”

Desperation filled my lungs.

“Look, ma’am I have money. Lots of it! I can fund research for your son’s condition. Hire the best professionals, write dozens of articles to spread awareness. I can—”

“And what good will bringing awareness do?” Mrs. Ingram’s voice was icy cold, “My Gordon doesn’t need his face plastered across the front page. He needs a new brain.”

Her grave expression spoke volumes, but she wouldn’t relent.

“And not just *any* brain,” she barked, “He must have the *best.*”

Mrs. Ingram began arranging medical instruments on the counter beside me. My heart sank as I caught a glimpse of electrical tools, scalpels, and a device resembling a dilator…

“My brain isn’t *even close* to being the best!” I cried, in a feeble attempt to bargain with what little chips I had left, “It’s not even halfway decent. Mrs. Ingram, I smoke two packs of cigarettes a day, and that’s on a good day, too! And I watch porn. *Lots* of porn. Have you heard of the one with the man and the jar? Or two-girls-one-cup? Well, I’ve jacked off to both of those! And - and there was another one with a horse, a black stallion! Your son doesn’t need my brain, ma’am, it’s… it’s a total shitstorm up in there!”

Mrs. Ingram turned to meet my frantic gaze, clearly amused by my radical change in demeanor.

“Son, your brain is made up of… Well, let’s call them *compartments*, for simplicity’s sake. There’s a designated space responsible for movement, personality, telling right from left, memory, the list goes on. I am not looking to take away your livelihood. The idea is, that if the surgery goes according to plan, you’ll get to keep your… *obscene* memories, and Gordon will be able to use expressions such as ‘halfway decent’.”

She paused just as Gordon’s words echoed in my mind, ‘*Every month there’s a new one*.’

“Of course, you cannot both retain the same… aptitude for language,” she heaved a sigh, “However, I’d say it is a small price to pay in the grand scheme of things.”

“P-please,” I whispered, “H-how many people have y-you…”

She shot me a reproving look as if she knew exactly what I was going to say next.

“I’ve tried a total of eight times,” her tone was flat, “Each failed because the brain matter dies before I can preserve it. But that’s not an excuse to quit trying. Always *remember* that. Now, you shouldn’t feel a thing. I’ll just tighten this strap right here…”

As she spoke, she pulled on the restraint around my neck, pressing my head firmly against the headrest.

“You *should* be lucid for the entire procedure. At least that was the way of things last time and the time before that. Here, I’ll just numb your scalp, pop it open, take what we need, and you’ll be all set!”

I seemed to be fully numb already, without any anesthetic. Involuntary tears streamed down my cheeks, slipping beneath my shirt collar.

“And don’t worry,” Mrs. Ingram suddenly sounded considerably perkier, “You can’t actually *feel* your brain. So I’ll ask you to continue writing… Or actually, that might not be too comfortable, given your position. Careful now, we don’t want tear stains on the pages… And I can’t have you flailing about like this. Perhaps just finish up the entry now, and then we’ll get to work.”



**Entry 5. Monday, January 10th, 2022**

I was jolted awake by a pounding headache. Fighting the urge to poke through my throbbing temples, I ran my palm across my face. My beard was definitely getting out of hand, but I was still the same old me, only with extra whiskers.

Reaching for the glass of water perched on the edge of the countertop, I noticed a couple of Aspirin pills laid out next to it. As I popped them onto my parched tongue, I was suddenly overcome with an inordinate sense of gratitude. She’d done it. She really had. And what’s more — I was alive! 

Squinting at the primitive light above my makeshift cot, I pulled the covers from my torso and swept a critical gaze over my body. I certainly seemed to be in one piece, save for a few brain cells. Probably. 

“Ah!” I called out, half-expecting to discover a critical error in my voice. But no. Still all there. 

I couldn’t shake the deep sense of gratitude I felt. In fact, I suddenly found myself grappling with emotions more profound than I could fully grasp. Was this what Stockholm Syndrome felt like? But wait. *Stockholm Syndrome?* Wouldn’t that only apply to those in captivity?

As promised, the surgery had been totally painless. The entire process was explained to me as it was happening. I learned the names of all the instruments used for the surgery and was even allowed to hold the hemostatic forceps.

Suddenly, brain surgery seemed like a ride along a lazy river. The waiting had, without a shadow of a doubt, been the most terrifying part. I couldn’t help raising my brows and mouthing *“That’s it?”* to a cluster of imaginary spectators, awaiting their turn in the fabled chair of doom. 

My stomach rumbled, demanding sustenance. I wondered what was on the menu this morning. I could have killed for some hash browns and sausage. *What time was it?* 

My gaze swiveled to the leftmost side of the room. There he was, still and serene, his eyes gently closed. Clearly fast asleep, a trickle of dried blood stamped across his temple. He looked so peaceful, so tranquil. 

As I jotted down my innermost thoughts in the journal that was set out in front of me, I couldn’t help feeling pleasantly surprised by the aptitude of my own skill. It seemed as though words were flowing through me in a way they never had before. 

I thought back to the Internet forums I’d frequent that, try as I might, I’d never had the capacity to engage with and wondered if this time might be different. Perhaps these entries would be my ticket to being part of the outside world?

“Look, mom!” I flashed the open journal at her as she descended the stairs laden with a wooden breakfast tray, “Maybe now I can be a writer, [too?](https://www.reddit.com/user/genuinelygrim/comments/1f8rx34/grims_treasury_of_twists_turns_masterpost/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)”
