Does your town have any creepy stories? Urban legends? Mine does. It actually is somewhat well known. Have you ever heard of Crybaby Bridge off of Egypt Road. It is in Salem, Ohio. Where I was unfortunate enough to be born. If you don't believe me look it up. Really, I insist. The story is somewhat vague, you know like the normal scary stories that get passed around when buildings get abandoned, when bridges start to rust. I don't know it exactly but what I do know is that supposedly some woman long ago took her baby there and drowned it. I don't remember why and I don't know if the story actually gives a reason or not. I'll tell you what I do know: it's said if you go to the bridge at night you will hear that poor little unloved baby thrown away by its own mother.

This piqued my interest. I grew up in a relatively boring town. I went to church every Sunday but I didn't pay it much attention. Especially since I didn't go to Sunday school anymore. I was competitive and wanted to be the smartest person in the room. It was the only reason I ever paid the teacher any attention. I much rather would be watching old horror movies or listening to people talk about horror stories. I think that my interest in horror stories may be due to my parents interest in it. Even when I was little I wanted to watch what was horror to little kids. You know, things like Beetlejuice, The Nightmare Before Christmas, or those old Creepypastas. They all held about the same level of scare while also obviously catering to younger audiences. Although, I dont think those old Creepypastas did it on purpose. Of course as I got older my taste in horror became more refined towards things with actually scary content. Things like Mother Horse Eyes and Bring Her Back.

My favorite movie is still Beetlejuice but that has more to do with nostalgia and my name than anything. My parents named me after Delia. After my sixteenth birthday I decided that to celebrate getting my license I was going to drive out to Crybaby Bridge and listen for its gentle cries. My parents didn't care, after all what is the worst that could happen here? Nothing ever really happened. We were in a suburb in the Midwest.

So I called a couple of my friends and asked them to go with me. I didn't expect Alice or Maiah to go with me, and they didn't. But Andie, forever trying to prove how brave she was after the incident with the spider, eagerly agreed. She didn't believe in ghost stories anyway. I suspected she chose not to because she didn't want to think of the implications of them being real. She was one of the few people in town who didn't attend one of the multitude of churches in town. Don't be fooled by the amount of churches however, there are just as many bars.

I pulled up to Andie's house and sent her a text that I was outside. Usually I would've honked to her annoyance but considering it was midnight I decided to be considerate of her neighbors. When Andie came out she was carrying a camera that looked older than me.

"What kind of ancient camera is that?" She glared at me, It was the reaction I wanted, before she answered.

"It's a home movie recorder. They still make them you know so obviously they are not that old. And how are you going to question me when you own a polaroid camera?"

"Relax, Andie I was just asking. Plus can you really tell me you didn't grab it out of some box in your dad's basement?"

Andie fiddled with the camera obviously done indulging me. Every time we met up I tried to get under her skin. I don't know why but it was so entertaining to watch her scowl at me. It was almost too easy to get a rise out of her. As I pull out of her driveway and begin on our path I ask become genuinely curious about the camera.

"In all seriousness why are you bringing it? We have phones that have way clearer images than that thing could possibly take."

Andie stopped fiddling with the camera to smile at me. "Yeah, but I mean isn't part of what makes things like The Blair Witch Project creepy the grainy footage? If we do hear anything and catch it on camera I want to be able to scare people with it."

It was a good idea. Still, I wanted to mess with her. "Andie if we do hear anything the only person that footage will scare is you."

She scoffed and rolled her eyes but there was a slight smile. We'd been friends since grade school. She knew I was only joking and she was too interested in getting the camera to work to give me any real reaction.

Anticipation built in my stomach as we arrived at the bridge off Egypt Road. I stepped out of the car, almost giddy with a smile on my face. It wasn't just the chace of seeing something supernatural. It was the fact that I got to drive here in the middle of the night without any adults. Andie and I stepped out of the car. I could see she was genuinely nervous. I didn't tease her about it. I teased her about a lot of things but I never wanted to genuinely hurt her feelings. From the look on her face this would.

We stepped onto the bridge carefully. It was old and had rusted steel sides. There was moss growing on the bridge and trees creeping over the sides. My giddiness subsided and a small fear took its place. The trees looked to be reaching for me. I convinced myself I was just psyching myself out and stepped forward. I reached for my phone and opened the camera in preparation in case anything started to happen.

Quietly I heard something. It tugged at my chest. It sounded horrible. The sound of the crying baby grew. I pressed the record button and stopped walking as the button seemingly wouldn't work. Panic flooded me as my phone screen froze. It promptly shut itself off. My breath picked up and I turned to look at Andie. She was stuck in place with terror. Tears were welling in her eyes. I shouldn't have brought her here.

"Delia my camera wont turn back on. I got it working but it wont start now." She looked at me with fear and something else. She was begging me to tell her that it was an old camera. That I set up the crying baby to scare her. But I couldn't. Because I didn't. Instead I ran towards her and grabbed her wrist. I brought us towards the car and quickly got in and locked the door as we both slammed our doors shut. Neither of us said another word as I shook and tried to turn on the car. Tried. It wouldnt start. Why wouldn't it start? It was a new car. We had it inspected. Then again, my phone was new too.

I hit the steering wheel in frustration.

"Fuck!" Tears were now welling in my own eyes. I liked horror movies don't get me wrong, but, I didn't want to be in one. I hadn't really expected a damn thing to happen. I thought maybe I'd creep Andie out a little bit and we would go to taco bell afterwards and I would sleep over at her house while we watched some indie found footage horror film in which I would tease her about her clutched hands around her pillow. But here we were in the middle of the woods.

My mind flashed to the news story I read when I was looking up the tale of Crybaby Bridge. A woman died here once. She was strangled to death. Her charred remains were found near the bridge. The news story was a big thing, parents didn't let their kids out anymore and rumors of a cult living in these woods gained traction. Of course itd been about 15 years. Nobody paid those rumors much attention anymore. The only people who did were cat owners.

I began crying as I pictured myself and Andie, strangled by cultists and burned afterwards as a sacrifice for some deity or satanic ritual.

My thoughts were cut off by adrenaline and panic flowed through me at the sound of something hitting my window. Andie was staring at whatever was hitting my window. Moonlight shone onto it casting a shadow in the car. I attempted to ignore its human shadow and stared forward trembling. Andie began sobbing. If we did survive she would never be my friend again would she. I wish I never brought her here. I wish I didn't come. I should've celebrated my license with Handel's like Alice did. Oh God I know I haven't been exactly faithful but I swear I'll pay attention in church. I will read my bible. I'll pray every hour if that is what it takes just save me please.

I heard laughter from outside of my window. I slowly turned towards the window. An old man was staring at me with crazed, wide eyes. They were a sickly shade of green and had blood vessels burst He was licking the window and panting like a rabid animal. I almost screamed like Andie but my throat felt like it was closing in on itself. No. Not now. I was having a panic attack.

My vision blurred as choked sobs escaped me and I begged a God who I didn't think was listening to save me.

He began to pull on the door handle wildly. This is when I began to try to turn on the car again. As I heard the engine roar to life the man became startled. He jumped back from the car and looked angry. It was terrifying but what was more terrifying was the way he ran away. It was on all fours like a cat. The way he moved was so wrong his neck seemed to become limp as he ran away. I sat there for a moment processing what had happened.

As I sat there I realized something else. I didn't hear the baby anymore. Actually I hadn't heard it for a couple of minutes. It stopped right before the car turned on. I pulled out of the place I was parked like a mad man and sped away towards Andie's house. If the police saw me I would definitely be pulled over. I didn't care. If we got pulled over we'd be with people who had guns. As I approached to Andie's house I slowed to the speed limit. When I stopped in front of her house I wordlessly unlocked the car. Andie just sat there for a momet.

I took the opportunity, "Andie, I didn't know. Im so sorry."

Andie looked at me, fear was still in her eyes and this made guilt overcome me. Andie began to speak, "You should drive home in the morning when it's safer."

I knew her words were an acceptance of my apology. Its how she always accepted my apologies of taking things too far. An olive branch.

God, how I wish I could say that was the end of it. But that satanic thing had seen our faces.
