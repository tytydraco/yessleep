Alright, I dont really post on reddit often and dont know how to begin by just saying i was inspired to write what happened to me when i read the post below and thought it sounded pretty similar. I generally am lazy so I'll do my best to actually tell you the full account of what happened.  


 [LINK TO POST I READ THIS MORNING AFTER MY EXPERIENCE](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2ir1au/a_couple_hours_ago_i_heard_somebody_talking/)

So this happened about 9pm AEST last night for me. (its 3pm as i type this).

I was sitting in my room watching a random youtube video and browsing on my phone and I heard this sort of distant screaming sound, only not too distant. And I am pretty sure now that I think about it that I have heard it before, but I always thought it was a couple cats fighting or a really young kid being a really young kid about their vegetables or something, and because i disregarded it I never like, stopped what i was doing or watching to actually open my window and listen properly.   
This time, it just sounded so... like gutteral and deep and disgusting. Like as if someone was being tortured or something i didn't really know what to make of it, I haven't heard anyone scream like that in my life. Anyways a few minutes go by and it keeps going on and the youtube video is still playing and my window is still closed but i can still hear it intermittently like once every minute or two there would be a long, 30-50 second sort of scream/belch and it sounded just right fucked up. 

eventually i start to think "what if a kid is actually being abused or something?" and i cant really shake the thought of the guilt I'd feel if something did happen and i didnt report anything so i resolved to listen in and try to find out what it was. Eventually turned down the volume of the video, walked into the corner of my room where the window is. (Newtown is a pretty urban place, my apartment is above a restaurant and theres a very narrow alleyway in between my building and the next building over which looks kind of derelict and super suspect)  
I heard it more clearly through the window and I could pretty much confirm it was a person, they kind of sounded very close and underneath my building, my best guess is they were in the alleyway next to the building and the echo was sort of playing off the walls or something I dont really know).  
I opened the window, which is fairly old and it made a loud noise. I didnt really care cause I still wanted to just listen in on the voice, but it definitely heard me. This time it was much closer and it was saying something in maybe some language I dont know, I'll leave that for the reddit detectives.

It sounded just evil to be perfectly honest and I was like "yeah, nah thats enough for me thanks" and i closed the window and walked away to my desk a bit shook. I thought about calling a friend and just telling him what happened but the more I thought about telling him the more I realised that either:  
A. he wasnt going to believe me  
or  
B. even if he did he wouldn't really ever understand what I heard or how spooky it was. I wouldn't be able to emulate it

On top of that my mates would probably take the piss and make fun of me lol. So i was like 'fuck it, I'm gonna try and get a recording to show them' and so I did.

Let me explain what you'll hear and what I linked below:

Immediately after I was spooked I sat back in my chair and put the youtube video volume up to mask my own noise cause it sounded very close, and I was legit fkn spooked to the shithouse. And that's when I thought to get the recording. What I did was I opened the voice memo app on my phone and walked over to the windowsill and placed my phone on the windowsill with the microphone side of my phone raised and up against the window. I didnt open the window again cause I was like fuck that, that's how people die in movies. I pressed record, backed away from the window and walked over to my computer desk and lowered the video volume (that I was hoping was disguising my presence a little) and then literally walked out of my bedroom.  


This is all genuine, really happened, and my friend who I ended up calling is coming over tonight around 8 to see if we hear anything again. Just want to get your thoughts and/or similar experiences or, if we're lucky, any translations or insights into what the fuck I heard last night.
