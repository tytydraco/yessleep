“You came here searching for answers, but got questions you weren’t expecting,” the tarot reader commented as she laid down our cards in front of us. 

Tess drank her coffee and gave me an icy glare. She still didn’t understand why we’d stayed in Oak Peak when clearly law enforcement and forces beyond our understanding were out to get us. 

I was not keen to admit supernatural things were happening, but the bloody message in our motel room and the strange murder of a weather girl had me feeling otherwise. 

Now, one of Chloé’s close friends was claiming they had information from beyond the grave that might hold the key to the whole nightmare. I wasn’t sure we could trust the fortune teller, but so far no one else had offered us help. 

The attorney that had contacted us was busy with a new job as an archivist downtown and the sheriff that we’d saved was trying desperately to hire new recruits before her predecessor found and eliminated her once and for all. There was a lot happening, so we needed all the assistance we could muster. 

“Chloé was murdered, you said her spirit told you who was behind it,” I said, trying to focus on the conversation that had brought us here. 

“The owls. They circle this town the same way vultures do. They sent messages of warnings ahead of time that bad things would happen if Chloé failed to confess, and now… that is exactly what has come to pass,” the card reader replied. 

 “Zeph, you aren’t telling us anything we don’t know. Tess found the town [forum](https://www.reddit.com/r/OakPeak/s/tVSkOKsejB) days ago. Lots of weird stuff happens here. Doesn’t mean it’s all connected. If you don’t have solid lead to go on, we can leave,” I told them. 

“Don’t be hasty Detective. The warnings for all Oak Peak went unheeded, and terrible things will happen as a result. Did you not see the connection amid the confessions?” 

“Give me the cliff note version,” I said tersely as I noticed rain was starting to fall. Perfect time for a meteorologist to die when random storms start brewing, I thought. 

“This is what the spirits told me. Nature is out of balance. The residents of this town have abused the resources and now, something evil is circling amid the air. The confessions were meant to restore order…. But the cards tell me that it wasn’t enough. Not until the truth can be revealed,” Zeph told us. 

“The truth about what?” I asked. 

Before we got an answer though, Tess’ phone buzzed. Her brother had found the results we needed on Chloé. I paid the fortune teller and we ran across to the diner to see what Walt had for us. 

“This probably comes as a shock to no one, but Chloé Cladise was a false name,” he said. Tess gave me a knowing look and I reluctantly paid her money. We’d bet that the name was fake and I had foolishly thought maybe our victim had been the one person telling the truth. 

“Took a while to find out more, but it looks like she came from somewhere in the Midwest. A town that doesn’t even exist anymore called Mooncreek,” Walt explained as he digitally sent the files. 

“So why did she come here to North Washington?” 

“My bet is to follow the breadcrumbs of whatever this is,” Walt said as an image popped up on screen. It looked like three semi circles stained against an old radio tower. I’d seen it somewhere here before in Oak Peak. Then I remembered. 

“Tom was living near somewhere that had a symbol like this. It’s some kind of institution,” I took out the phone directory for Oak Peak and flipped through it. 

“Scientific Association of Normal Events, or SANE for short. Looks like they’ve been in town for about 6 years or so. Stationed just east of Oak Mountain,” I commented. 

“Six years? That’s about the same time that Mooncreek was wiped off the map,” Walt remarked. 

“Sounds like we need to go ask a few white coats some questions,” Tess decided.

The storm was almost flood worthy, making it impossible to visit SANE that same night. I called ahead and made an appointment with the Head of Research, a professor named Ethan Paytrol; who seemed eager to talk with us. 

“Apparently Chloé was working for them. It seems odd that they were on such good terms if they are responsible for her death,” I told my partner as I cooked some take out in the small microwave oven. 

“Stranger things have happened, Colton. Like this Mooncreek stuff that Walt sent me. How does a town of four thousand simply vanish overnight? It’s like everyone was vaporized or something,” Tess responded. 

“Has he been able to find out what Chloé was doing there?” 

“No not yet. But he will. No one can hack like my brother.” 

We went to bed that night restless, I was excited to bring the case to a close. But I kept focusing on the card reader’s warnings. 

Oak Peak has a large population much like that other town. What if something had wiped out everyone here? What if the mystical warnings were meant to evacuate the town? 

Were we all sitting ducks? Was it even possible to prevent it from happening?

My mind refused to give me rest as I worried over these details. 

I knew the answers had to lie with whatever SANE and Chloé had been working on. 

I just wasn’t sure I was ready to know what it was.

The facility stood out like a sore thumb, bold and bright amid an ocean of trees. It was probably only built within the past decade, given what Walt told us; but it still looked brand new. 

“Professor Paytrol will see you now,” an older woman at the front desk told us. 

As we were escorted to a sublevel, I noticed the place had an unusual number of security cameras that focused on the skies above Oak Mountain. 

Soon that imagery faded away as we descended to the bowels of the facility, nothing but iron and cement greeting us. 

“We will need to speak with you separately, if that’s all right,” the woman told us. I gave Tess a nod, not even thinking that might be an issue and then followed my escort to the next room. 

Paytrol looked to be about mid fifties, a short graying beard and a bit on the pudgy side. He stood to greet me. 

“I’ve heard rumors that there was a detective looking into Chloé’s case but I guess I didn’t believe it until you made the call. Pleasure to put a face with the name, sir,” he said. 

He seemed friendly enough, but I kept my guard up. 

“Thanks for agreeing to meet me. Seems like everyone else in Oak Peak is just moving on, pretending she was never here.” 

“Oh they’ll put on a show for a little bit. A funeral in the morning, a post or two saying this or that. But Chloé was never a part of them anyway. She was destined for something greater,” Ethan responded as he offered me a drink. 

“About that. What was she doing for your facility before she was murdered?” 

“We use this mountain to research weather patterns, test different methods to measure precipitation, earthquakes… that sort of thing,” he responded. 

“There are quakes out here?”

“Yes. In fact Chloé was supposed to be determining where the epicenters might be next to hit before she was taken from us,” he responded. 

“Do you think that research is what got her killed?” I asked. 

“Who would murder someone for that?” Paytrol said with a shrug. 

“Maybe it had something to do with Mooncreek then?” I suggested. 

Ethan paused, clearly taken aback that I knew that name but at first he pretended it meant nothing. 

“I don’t know what you are getting at, Detective but again I urge you to look into Chloé’s private life. I’m sure this is obvious but the people she was closest to are likely the culprit,” he said. 

“She knew no one around town, except maybe a few loners,” I told him and then gave him a dead stare. 

“But like I said, I think the reason she died is because she was not who she claimed to be and someone here figured it out,” I told him. 

“I’m not quite sure I follow,” he admitted. 

“Mooncreek. An entire city wiped off the map and your facility somehow connected. I can show you the pictures if that will ring any bells,” I responded. 

Ethan paused and then a buzz from behind him made him turn to see two agents dressed in all black entering the room. 

“Professor, we can handle this from here,” a redheaded man said. 

“I must’ve touched a nerve if you’re calling in your federal pit bulls,” I remarked dryly. 

“Professor Paytrol is not connected to the work we’re doing here, Balinor,” the woman said as we had the room to ourselves. 

“So then I take it you might be to blame for what happened in Mooncreek?” 

“What happened was an oversight. One we are trying to make sure doesn’t happen again,”
The woman corrected me. 

“And Chloé? Was she collateral damage?” 

“Miss Cladise is the reason Mooncreek no longer exists,” the redhead responded. 

I found my palms becoming sweaty at the unexpected revelation. Fear immediately gripped me. Chloe had killed all those people?

“That doesn’t make sense,” I told them. 

“Believe what you want, it’s the truth. We only recently realized the connection ourselves. We were going to make her confess… but it seems someone else got to her first,” the woman answered. 

“I don’t believe you. I think you are hiding something.” 

“Believe what you want, Balinor. Tomorrow after her funeral we will publish an official statement that will show the real culprit, and Oak Peak will never again repeat her name,” the woman said. 

“The real culprit? You found the killer?” 

They paused and a view screen appeared on the right wall, footage from the highway where Chloe’s body had been located a few days prior. 

I watched quietly as I saw the weather girl walking out of the forest, seemingly covered in blood being chased by something. 

A few moments later I saw myself walking out of the same woods, holding a long thin blade to kill her. 

I didn’t bother watching the rest. 

“This is doctored.” 

“Doesn’t matter. You’re a drifter. Oak Peak will accept this story and you’ll be labeled a murderer. Unless you leave now. Forget about Mooncreek. Forget about Oak Peak. Go back to whatever hole you crawled out of and do business there,” the redhead ordered. 

I was trying to not be scared out of my mind so I argued “you’re scare tactics won’t get to me.” 

Instead they upped the ante. “If we can’t convince you to cooperate than we will target your partner as well. Tess, is that correct? I suspect you care for her a great deal.” 

“Leave her out of this.”

I was sweating, wondering what they might do to us. 

“Your cooperation will require we show you that we mean business. We can easily label someone else as the murderer here from SANE, but to do that you’ll need to stop digging. Only way to get you to do that is by show of force, it seems,” the woman answered. 

The view screen changed to footage from the room Tess was in. She was being questioned by another woman. She said her name was Linda. And then Linda told Tess to look straight into the agent’s eyes. It was literally like a scene from Men in Black, except it looked like the agent’s eyes turned entirely dark and some weird wave of energy transferred between them.  

“No!!” I shouted but it was too late. A second later I saw how dazed and confused my partner was and I knew what they had done to her. 

“We are letting you leave here with your life, Defective. All we ask is that you destroy any clues or evidence you might have found. Let the real authorities handle that from here on out,” the redhead ordered. 

I told them I would cooperate. My hands were tied anyway, not like I could use anything as a bargaining chip.

“Just please let Tess and I out of here.” 

Thirty minutes later we were riding up the elevator. Tess was still blurry eyed and silent. 

We said nothing until we got to the car. 

Then I heard a voice that wasn’t hers, coming from her pocket. she reached and fished it out and I realized it was Walt. 

“Wait. Have you been listening the whole time?” I asked him. 

“She put me on silent but I heard everything. Colton, is my sister okay?”

I wasn’t sure how to answer that. My
Stomach was in knots. 

“What did you hear Walt?”

“That agent… Linda Raywood. She said she didn’t have a choice but to make sure my sister was taken care of. But she promised she would send something. Something that might reveal what Chloé was looking into” 

A moment later a file pinged and airdropped onto her phone. 

“I think I just got it. It’s old. Encrypted. Idk what it means,” I admitted. 

“It’s not safe to keep it. Linda said get it leaked somehow. It will show that SANE had Chloe killed. I’ don’t know what this big conspiracy is, Balinor but it sounds like it’s way over our pay,” Walt told me. 

I tapped the weird symbol on the file and saw the notes. Chloé was getting close to exposing the SANE research team. But it didn’t specify about what. 

“This isn’t much to go on,”
I admitted. And I wasn’t sure I knew who to even give the information to. 

I made it back to the motel and helped Tess lay down. She was still quiet, walking in a stupor from what the feds had done to her. I could tell she would never be the same again. 

My foolish ambition had cost her so much I thought. 

That just means I need to see this through to the end, I realized as I contacted the lawyer. 

If anyone knew how to make the public of Oak Peak aware… it was him. 

In the morning, before the funeral; I got a text. 

“Send the file encrypted to Oak Underground blog. Patrick was compromised… but this might wake him back up,” the text said. 

There was a link to a VPN account for some kind of tabloid paper. 

I thought about not sending it. I thought about doing what the feds wanted and driving out of here. This time we got lucky and walked away with our lives. What if next time they decided we were too much of a liability?

Then I saw Tess struggle to even do basic chores in the morning, walking like a robot. When I helped, she gave me a blank stare. 

It wasn’t accusing. It was one of helplessness. Like she didn’t even know why any of this was happening. 

I couldn’t walk away. This had already cost us too much. 

Beside, I still didn’t understand my own connections to any of this. 

Oak Peak was my home now for the foreseeable future, whether I liked it or not.
