This isnt the craziest story but sure creeped me out. This was a few years ago when i was 28.So I was working out of town in a very small town in my province. It was old and was historical and this town is known for a lot of drugs and violence. We stayed at a motel that looks super sketchy and I've heard from many people that the place is really haunted and weird stuff always happens there.

I do believe in the paranormal but never experienced it myself. I usually jock up most of the stories as fake. 
I was getting ready to go to bed in my room for work the next morning. It was about 830 at night in the winter time, so it was dark. 

I have a bright hot pink scrunchy I always use to sleep in. I left it on the bathroom counter when I took a shower. Right on the counter. It was a very small bathroom and it was the sink counter with one long leg in the middle. Basic set up. I went to grab my brush in the other room and put my hair up. I go back in the bathroom and the scrunchy was gone....wtf?

The bathroom is small so I checked it over 3 or 4 times and in the shower. Wasn't there. I went into the room where the bed is. The beds are still made, I checked the desk. I looked in my back pack. I haven't even opened my luggage yet. I went back and forth between the room and bathroom another couple times. 

I got angry and yelled what the hell is going on! I was on the verge of tears because I just wanted to get to bed and not have to deal with this. But then something clicked about the motel being haunted and maybe it was a spirit messing with me so i said, put my scrunchy back !! I went back into the bathroom and there it was sitting on the sink counter. I checked many times before and it was not there. It's hot pink and I would've seen it. The counter was so small. Something was definitely in my room that night and was messing with me. 

The story of that motel is a lot of junkies and prostitutes stay at that motel because it's only one of few in that town. I was told quite a few people have died there and have been killed and a lot of overdoses. So I definitely wouldn't be surprised if no one crossed over and are just roaming the motel trying to mess with people. It was terrifying for me and I covered my head under the sheets. 

I finally get to bed and I kept hearing little things in the night. Not really loud stuff but maybe somethings moving around or being touched. I convinced myself that I was just scared and that previous incident just messed with my brain at this point.

In the end I'm glad it was something silly and not something violent. I don't think i would've been able to keep it together emotionally in that room. 

That was my first and hopefully last paranormal experience.
