My name is Mikandis Ogulash and I am, or rather was, a Topeli-born and raised Major of her Imperial Majesties 9th division Ether Exploration Division. 

Currently, I am some no-name bum typing this out on what looks like an ancient piece of junk hoping I can give some of the people here a fair chance to prepare for what I and my people experienced.

For starters, as some might have guessed from the fact that my home country does not exist on your planet, I do in fact come from a different universe than yours. Approximately one decade ago the largest and most powerful vassal state of the Imperium Topeli, my home country, was chosen to send a total of two hundred of me and my brothers and sisters in arms into the cosmic clusterfuck that can best be described as a hole in reality.

It popped up in our planet's orbit one day, we never exactly figured out how and when, and started destabilizing reality in various ways. We could at first not see it, not before our star was corrupted enough to change its lightwaves to illuminate it, but we suspect it had been there for around 5 years prior to us fully discovering it. 

Or at the very least that was the time events started to become... illogical and chaotic in a frequency that quickly made clear was beyond the explainable. The oceans of our once-purple world turned a deeply saturated neon blue that glowed in the dark, gravity and time was no longer constant but shifted rapidly across the globe, and people disappeared from one second to the next. 

It was initially believed that they were erased from existence completely, but I have now come to understand that they were instead teleported to different dimensions or universes. Likely via the reality distortion disease that from our best estimates every living being experiences at one point or another after enough exposure to the field. There was some speculation about the exact nature of the hole and why it has the effects that it did but nothing concrete could ever be established due to its very illogical nature. 

Some members of my crew thought it was a military attack of some alien threat, while others bet on more natural phenomena akin to a black hole that was so strong it destroyed reality itself. 

But as scary as the whole wave of chaos is gonna be, that is not what you need to worry about since you can't change any of that. What you need to be scared about is the green hue on the edge of your sight that comes with the RDD. Because once you start seeing green? That is gonna indicate you will have to participate in a cosmic game of chance for... well forever as far as I can tell. 

As soon as you begin to discover your vision is getting shaky you can see that signature faint green light surrounding the edge of your vision? Just close your eyes and pray you end up somewhere good on your first couple of cycles. 

To continue with the life lessons, seriously I cannot stretch this enough do not worry about the whys and hows, you have enough trouble on your plate. You do not even have the technology to begin not comprehend this thing so trying is a waste of time. I do not mean to sound callous or arrogant but my civilization was approximately seven thousand years or so ahead of your own, and we could only scratch the surface of the thing.

You cannot stop what is about to occur, nor comprehend it, but only prepare so you may survive it as long as possible and make the most of your foreseeable eternity. 

There are certain rules you will need to follow so as to better prepare yourself for the incoming future you and your species are about to experience. I have managed to survive 9 different cycles via my methods and have tried my best to include the instructions I have received from other travelers like myself who have survived for longer to offer the most optimal advice.

I have come to call them the three Ps to make them easier to understand and memorize: Prepare, Persevere, Protect and they will be as good of a guide for the ensuing chaos as you are likely going to get. 

Rule Nr.1: Once the "weirdness" starts popping up, it is imperative for you to PREPARE yourself and your loved ones to follow the buddy system. The more people are linked together physically at the time of travel, the greater the amount of surrounding area will get transported with you. 

I have heard reports by a family of six that managed to bring their whole home and surrounding backyard into the next dimension via being linked at the time they began to experience the green hue, so it is worth it to surround yourself with as many friends and family members as you can on that basis alone.

Rule Nr.2: Gather as many supplies and pieces of tech as you can from the dimensions with technologically advanced civilizations on them so you can PERSEVERE. What you have currently will probably only last you a cycle or two at most. In my own home dimension, we have a device that can use the surrounding air, dirt, and water to construct a large library of meals, technologies, and tools called a Patak. Get one of them or the closest alternative as soon as you can no matter what it takes. 

From what I can tell, the device that it most closely resembles is what you people call a 3d printer although you will require a bit of time with the included instructional AI to get used to handling it. 

Construct tech of any kind are an absolute must to survive on your extended trips since not all planets and dimensions you will land on can offer you the basics of survival you will need to last until the next cycle. 

Rule Nr.3: Under no circumstances should you put anything about the task to PROTECT others and yourself from the dangers of the multiverse. You will need allies and not enemies. Once the end of your cycle occurs, and it WILL end one day no matter how well prepared and lucky you are, you are dependent on the kindness of others to survive the first reboot cycle since that one you will have to start fresh without prior prep work or allies for a while.

The multiverse is an infinite plane of misery and death so anything that is sentient is your friend since they too will have gone through or are about to go through the same thing as you and I. The closer you are to them (negatively or positively) the higher the chance you will drift together in subsequent reboots given enough time so better not go making any lasting enemies on account of that alone. 

I have seen eldritch monstrosities taller than the largest of your towers emerge from the depth of the oceans of my last cycle that were so alien that even my universal translator could not pick up on their garbled words and instead of crushing me under their tentacles embraced me and my spawn into their midst. That is what true comradery means, and it will prove invaluable in your survival. 

If you have any questions I will try to answer them to the best of my abilities but to conclude for now? Follow the three Ps, and get ready to make some weird new friends, because you will need them.
