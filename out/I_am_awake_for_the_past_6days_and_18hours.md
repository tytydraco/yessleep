Hi, I am David, 

As the title states it's been 6 days and 18 hours since I last slept, this won't end with just 6 or 7 days, they are everywhere and they are waiting for me to sleep, I can sense them looking at me but when I try to look back they are gone, they blend into the shadows, move without any sound and hide in plain sight, they make me feel their presence, I think i am at my limits so I have to share what's happening with me here, 

\_\_\_\_\_Night 1\_\_\_\_\_  

It all started 7 months ago, I work as a financial adviser in a well-known firm and I earn a good salary, as every day I complete my work and were coming back when my colleague Liam invited me for some drinks at a nearby bar, we had some fun time there and it was already late, I was a little drunk but still I got into my car and was on my way,



I live in a secluded estate which I got as an inheritance after my dad passed away, I still remember that time when I was driving, it was a little foggy outside and It wasn't clear and then my phone rang it was my ex we broke up just a week before. Instinctively I checked the time it was **02:53 am** and I started to wonder why did she call me at this ungodly hour, while I was in such a state of mind suddenly someone or something was in front of my car, I couldn't see them clearly and in a panic, I tried to avoid them by steering left but I couldn't, I ran over someone and then came to a halt,



At first I was blank couldn't understand what was happening, my phone was still blaring I ignored it and got out of my car and rushed to see if that's a person or any animal, to my horror it looked like a person at a glance, as I neared it dawned on me it wasn't a human, I have no words of describing it other than a pile of blackish-red, fleshy mass, I was horrified but at the same time relieved that it wasn't a person and thought it was some rotten flesh which some animal dragged here and thought of leaving it here and go back to my car when I turned my back to leave I heard the most disgusting sound I have heard till now it was horrendous I felt sick I haven't felt such disgust even when looking at it but now this sound made me feel such fear and hatred towards that thing, I was shaken to the core and then it sounded like it was moving closer and closer I was frozen in shock and fear, I pinched myself to make myself clear, with all my remaining strength I rushed to my car and got inside without looking back, I booked it out of there and then I saw it in my rare view mirror the thing which I hit is now not a mass of flesh, there was a person looking at my car, to be more specific it look like he was coming out of that flesh there was still more than half of his body inside the flesh just his torso is out and his hollow eyes are looking at my car.



To describe what I saw He was a human naked, with damp sagged skin and very few long strands of hair on his head, his body was wet and gooey like there was mucus all around, he wasn't blinking his eyes, and he was staring at me with a smile on his face a wide creepy smile, The steering wheel felt slick with sweat in my hands. My breaths came in ragged gasps, fogging up the windshield even more. I made it my resolve to never take this route in the future and went home, I tried to sleep but I couldn't so I drank myself to sleep and hoped this was the end,



I think I slept around 3 to 4 hours when I was in deep sleep I felt something crawling on my left hand, even in my sleep I felt some movement it was like a millipede was crawling onto me and leaving a trace of sticky viscous liquid behind it and this liquid reminded me of the thing on the way and I was jolted awake to check what it was but there was nothing on my arm I searched for it all around my bed and the room but couldn't find anything odd, so I thought this was just my imagination playing with me and was about to go back to sleep when I heard something being dragged,



It felt like someone was dragging something heavy on the floor, I opened my door and was searching for what it was, I checked every room but there was nothing, at last, I turned towards the kitchen and saw my refrigerator door was open I moved to look why it was open as I was closing in I heard sounds of chewing and tearing It made me stop on tracks as I tried to peek behind the opened door the door closed and there I saw the same figure of a man whose body is stuck in the pile of blackish-red flesh only his torso and arms were our he was eating raw fish which I stored in for the next day with a horrifying smile, I screamed with all my might and In the next moment I woke up on the bed this was a dream.



The dream felt so real, I was annoyed at myself for being so scared and then looked at the clock it was 7 am, I had to reach the office by 9 so I had a nice long bath and went into the kitchen to cook some breakfast as I was walking into my kitchen the floor felt a little sticky, it was odd I had a maid who comes daily, she comes at 11 am every day, she has her own set of keys so she cleans and leaves, I thought of calling her and asking her clean the floor again and went to the fridge, I restock it from time to time and cook my meals but as I opened it I was shocked to see it was nearly empty and the fish which should be neatly packed is now a torn pack.



My heart skipped a beat and thought of the dream so Was my dream real what I saw and felt the other night horrified me, I was shaking and crying at the same time, and with lots of confusion and dilemma, I headed to the office empty-minded.

\_\_\_\_\_Night 1\_\_\_\_\_
