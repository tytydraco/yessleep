What describes average? Is it a nice home, a nice family or a nice job? Ill identify as all three. Since i lived in a ruralish area my family were more than good with money and owned some land that me and my siblings were very common with since playing there was a sort of "full time job".

Ever since my pet dog who we called 'gympie' past away just last year, the family were always sobbing and crying over having to get a new pet around the property. You may think that my parents were meaning to have another dog, and your absolutely right until one night out of the blue, i stopped eating dinner with the fork full of food halfway to my mouth i got an idea that sparked so bright. 

Little did i know, it may have been an idea too bright, because we would regret ever doing so. That idea was to get a worm farm or colony whatever you may call them. When i was at the table eating dinner everyone kind of recoiled and questioned why, and i imply just answered with "because why not?". So that very week we got a worm farm.

Since it was my idea they all voted to place the farm in my room, to give you perspective of the farm, it was kind of like a reptile enclosure, with glass walls and a glass roof to feed the worms. I dont know exactly how much worms we got but there was enough to fill the dirt with. 

Over the weeks it would be a routine, wake up, feed the worms, go to school then sleep. Until one afternoon after school, it was clear that somehow the glass shattered, dirt and worms everywhere. I looked confused on how this could happen because the glass needed to be hit with force to break, i was confused.

What was unusual was the different behaviour these worms were adapting to, for example the worms started to feel less interested in fruit and some died due to starvation, thats when things got weirder, the worms ate the dead worms beginning to act more aggressive to one another, headbutted eachother like what you see in bull fights and rodeos.

One day at school i was doing a test for my math which was important for me since i knew i was on track for getting an 'A'. That was until the silence that was filling the room got disturbed violently by my ringtone on my phone, it was my mum calling. She was suppost to be be at home since there was a break at work for her so she was the one that fed the worms today, the blank stare of the teacher obviously furious at my disturbance was ignored by me answering the phone.

Expecting my mum to say something i said "hello?" In a whisper voice, no reply, i look at the phone kind of confused and hang up, i said sorry to the teacher as i continued to the exam, a quiet huff came from the teacher at her desk.

As i was on the way home (i walk), and got more view of my house, i stopped suddenly, i had the strongest feeling that something bad happened in the house, my gut was telling me and i just shrugged it off. I got to the front door, unlocked it and went inside. I notice from my view that dirt and glass was peaking from my bedroom door, just a little bit to notice.

I sighed because it was pobably the glass from the worm farm but when i looked in my bedroom, my whole body shook, like a heart attack my blood felt like turning to lava and cooled to hard rock that was unbreakable.

My mum, was laying on the ground, small blood trails travelled through her skin as those goddamn worms were litteraly biting my mother, every hole in her body was covered in worms as her eyes lay only centremeters from her head. Holes in teeth and oh god her ears were the worst, her brain looked stretched out from her head through her ears and layed down on the ground. The last thing i noticed was her phone in her hand still on the screen to call me. After witnessing this i ran towards the door, throwing up and coughing.

The police came, i honestly dont know what for, they were fucking worms. But out of everything they suspected that mum was trying to feed the worms, fell and broke the farm open, there was no doubt that couldve happened but i think otherwise.

The funeral was 2 weeks later, in that time period i fixed the worm farm, placed it outside and set it up in flames. And oh god you wouldnt believe it, they were fucking screaming, tiny squeels like fucking baby birds, it was fucking disturbing.
At the funeral we did normal funeral stuff, i may not sound very sad or depressed that this happened, its because i cant right now. 

Im writing this now because they are coming, the worms. They havent left, im laying on the floor because they broke my leg, dont ask fucking how but they planned something against me, they arent dumb. Oh god my leg hurts, they move, and they move fucking fast, if anyone sees this whether it be at my house or on the internet, please oh god please dont trust the worms they arent as friendly as what they were. 

Holy shit, the are crawling up my legs, GET THE FUCK OFF ME, omg im gonna die, dad if you see this i loved you so so so much, that time we almost threw up on the roller coaster after having a milkshake, good old times. It hurts, DONT TRUST THE WO.....
