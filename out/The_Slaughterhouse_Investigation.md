  

I never wanted to write anything like this out.  Never in several lifetimes did I think this was going to happen.  Words cannot express my sorrow.  But I will try.  If nothing else, it will explain what happened to my friends.  They didn’t deserve to die like that.

Current year is 2022.  About 10 years ago me and my two friends, Pikes and Wolowski, decided to hunt for ghosts. No, a ghost didn’t kill one of our family members and we vowed revenge or anything like that. It was initially a goof. 2012 was probably the height of ghost hunting mania, thanks to ghost adventurers on the travel channel and the dozen or so other similar shows.

I have always been a fan of scary stories and dark mysteries. Pikes was the same, going a little more into the darker side of it. Demonic and Satanic shit was more his speed. Wolowksi, who we just called Wolo for short, was along for the ride. There was only one thing we liked more than ghost hunting at that time, and that was drinking. And drinking was what Wolo gold medaled in.

So, after work once or twice a week we would get our seven dollar EVP recorders from Wal-mart (which were regular voice recorders,) and search for paranormal activity. I was in charge of researching the haunted places near us that would hopefully yield any kind of evidence. After our first two or three “investigations,” we were all standing outside Wolo’s truck after work. Typical pre-game, pre-ghost hunting ritual. I can remember it like it was yesterday.

All of us worked the same shift but somehow Pikes got out 10 minutes before me and Wolo did. I had a fresh 12 pack of Milwaukee’s beast on ice in Wolo’s truck bed. As he and I made our way outside we both found our buddy Pikes waiting for us. We also found that about 4 of the 12 ice beers were already gone.

“Good God man, you destroyed four beers in ten minutes?” I said, raising my eyebrows at the 6’5’’ German tank. He was fully born in America but had an all-German family. He sheepishly smiled and gave both of us a look like “I have no idea what you’re talking about.”

Wolo laughed. “Shit dude, I’m gonna need to catch up real freakin quick now. You guys start sweet talking demon pussy when we get there, and I’ll go pick up another sixer. And maybe a bottle.”

We all laughed. Pikes and I looked at each other. Here we go, kind of look. Referring to Wolo’s drinking habits. We all drank, but.. he took it a little far some nights.

I went to the cooler where Pikes had subtracted a 1/3 of our beers for the night and pulled out three airplane shot bottles of 100 proof peppermint schnapps. Spooky.

As we commenced the preshow ritual Pikes stopped, pulling his bottle back just a hair before the toast. I looked at him with slight confusion.   
 “What’s up man?” I asked.

“We need a name.” Pikes finally ousted.

“A name?” Wolo responded.

“Yea man, we are gonna make it big time bros. We’ve already got some great EVP’s and even you got what looks like a shadow person Wolo. We need a brand, for when the big networks start calling!” 

We all laughed, clearly, he was being funny. Though I did see he had a tiny shred of genuineness behind this. He really did like doing this. I smiled, looking down at my chilled bottle of high-proof peppermint schnapps. Pikes and Wolo’s laughing trailed off. 

“Uh.. what’s up bro.” Pikes said.

I looked up, realizing I was probably staring at that shot for an uncomfortable amount of time.

“I got it.” I said quietly. I laughed to myself, finally meeting eyes with my compadres. I was met back with raised eyebrows. I took a long look at my shot. And I raised it to the heavens. My bros followed me, blindly, which I appreciate. 

“These, my friends, are Spirit Shots.” “And we are investigating the paranormal.” Both guys laughed, still following me but not.. following me. 

I felt like Rick Grimes saying his iconic line in the comic and show. “We… ARE the walking dead.” I finally dropped the suspense. We are SSPI.. I studied their faces. Still covered in confusion. Spirit shot paranormal investigators.

“HEY!” Pikes yelled and slammed his shot into ours. We threw down the peppermint, winced, laughed, and got ready for our investigation. I can’t remember what particular haunt we were in that day when the name was born. I don’t remember much of that night to be honest, hopefully none of us drove home after that. But if I’m honest I’m sure Wolo drove us, that was one of our big mistakes, continuing to let him drive.

We carried out our typical SSPI romps almost weekly. Impressive, for three guys with full time jobs and families. Thankfully the respective wives understood, or at least tolerated it. One of our most successful nights found us at a public park. It was small, open to anyone. The reports online were laughable, which made us want to investigate it that much harder.

Halmich Park, in Warren, Michigan, is laid out with your typical playground area, park benches, areas to picnic, and four baseball fields. Mainly occupied by softball players. At any given time during the week, you could find anyone from tee ball squads to hardcore adult beer league softball players smacking the oversized baseball around.

According to a random, unsubstantiated account online, the legend goes that softball players would purposefully try to hit bombs beyond the outfield fence to hit and kill kids. When they did, they ran out and circled the dead child, chanting. I can remember me and Pikes dying laughing as we read this. Not a fucking chance this was real, but it certainly was entertaining. The other more well-known legend of Halmich was that when you drive into the park after midnight, your vehicle will “hit,” some unknown object. When you check to see what you hit, nothing is there. As you look up, you see taillights leaving the park. The story being that was some kid was killed by an unknowing driver in the past and sped away as to not get into trouble… for KILLING a child. A lot of places in the US have a super similar story.

The preparations were complete. As usual, I did.. all the preparations. I researched the site, bought our booze, and made sure we were all ready to spend the night in this park after hours. Wolo got the peppermint schnapps, so I guess I didn’t do everything. 

As we entered the park, I felt the front of my ’98 mustang hit something. No .. way. I looked at pikes in the passenger seat, and then Wolo in the back. For once, we didn’t have anything to say. I slowly got out of the car. Thankfully I remembered to put it into park. I slowly approached the hood, searching my surroundings, not seeing any animal, or person laying on the ground. What I did see though. .. was a gigantic speed bump. I stood up straight and looked at my boys sitting in the car still. I tried to continue the mystery by scarily pointing in front of my car as if I had hit something.

Pikes got out to look. Wolo stayed in the back. I’m sure he either was deep into his 9th beer, or he didn’t really care. Pikes slowly made his way to me from the opposite side of the car. He let out a gigantic laugh after he saw we just hit a speed bump a bit too quickly. So, I put this together very fast.

The legend said that as you enter the park, you “hit,” something. When you look, nothing can be found. Then you find taillights. I failed to mention that I actually did see taillights as I left my vehicle. The legend most likely comes from people like myself, hitting that huge speed bump, thinking it’s a person. The entrance to the park is one-way, so seeing taillights leaving isn’t that insane, as there’s only one way in and one way out.

The rest of the night’s investigation did yield some fairly decent EVP’s. After reviewing our findings the next day, hungover, I did hear a scary other-worldly voice breath in and say “Death.. MOVE.” It was pretty good evidence. Scary evidence, at least.

For many different reasons, this was our last investigation for over half a year. No fall out or anything, we just had too many obligations elsewhere. More important obligations. We still worked together, were friendly, but had to do the normal grown-up things that most people our age do. Until Pikes came to me one day with an idea for getting the gang back together. He was as giddy as a schoolgirl walking through the pink aisle at target on her birthday.

“Slaughterhouse.” I stared at Pikes. Surely there must be more that follows that one word. Especially a word like that that could illicit one thousand different emotions. I kind of closed my mouth, puffing out my upper lip in conjunction with raising my eyes at him, the universal sign for “Ok. .. I am waiting for the rest.”

Like a wind-up toy that was stuck for a moment, he snapped back to his prior animation.   
 Apparently, Pikes has a buddy that he grew up with that works in a meat packing facility. Said the place was getting slow and if he wanted to come in and hang when it was closed, he could make that happen.

I stopped him. “So, your friend just randomly invited you to hang out in a meat packing plant. I don’t get it. And you also said slaughterhouse. What am I missing,” I confusingly asked him.

He shook his head and rubbed his face, like he was resetting. When his giant paw left his mouth, he was once again smiling.   
 “Ok, yes, it’s a meat packing plant, but they do dispatch their products on site, so it is technically a slaughterhouse. And that sounds more bad ass. And second, he said it’s haunted dude!”

Now I get where this is going. Look at my big German friend, scouting out a location to investigate all on his own. Like a big boy. “Nice, bro, nice.” I beamed. He went on to give me the details, which I relayed to Wolo. He was in. No doubt about that. 

After I was filled in a bit more, I found out that Pikes friend knew he liked scary ghost adventure stuff and said that he has some first-hand accounts of creepy happenings while he was working. Intriguing. We’ve half-assed “investigated,” a good half dozen or so locations. But this one seemed different. We had someone that claimed to hear things, see dark shadows, and even watched what he described as a “creeping figure,” come toward him, only to disappear once they were face to face. This was going to be good.

Commence pre-show ritual. This was “SSPI,” after all. To summarize, we drank. A lot.

So, this place was a slaughterhouse. I’ll ask you to think about that for a bit. What comes to mind? Yes, me too. Bloody meat hanging from the rafters. Troughs filled with blood. Furnaces burning the blood off of tenderloins, t-bones, porterhouse cuts, and the like. Well, it wasn’t like that. Not a bit.

The room where the business took place was way in the back of the building. Very small. When you walked into the front it looked more like a retail store than anything. They had books, bread, toys, and glass counters with animal products wrapped up. It was a very professional operation. When Pikes contact saw him, he excitedly ushered him and us behind the counter.

Apparently, the scary part was nowhere near the butchered animals. The dark energy lived in the basement. “Of COURSE,” I blurted out, not entirely meaning to. I gave a look to wolo, motioning the bottle I had in my left hand. “Gotta, pull it back a bit,” I said, barely getting it out before we both started laughing.

After we started trailing the laughter off, I looked at Pikes friend. Who never did tell us his name now that I think of it. He was not laughing. He only left us with this:

“Look, there’s no history of a girl getting suffocated down there by an 1800’s serial killer. There is no documented history of Ouija board use, or a portal opened to hell down there. It’s… It’s just… bad. Pikes, I know you want to do use, I just ask you use extreme caution.”

With that, Wolo and I were not laughing anymore. In fact, he wasn’t even by me. I looked at Pikes, who was talking to his friend, saying something like thanks again for letting us fuck around down here. I did hear him say it wouldn’t be too long.

I caught eyes with Pikes when his bud left. We were still excited.

“That sounds.. pretty wild man, this might actually get some results,” I said to him. Pikes raised his eyebrows and bit his lip. 

“Yeah, I’ve never seen him that serious before.” As he said that, his buddy opened the cellar door that led to the basement. 

Pikes and I cheered. With our beers, not like literally raising our arms and yelling. “Wait,” he said. “Where’s the big dummy?” Referring to Wolo.

I told him he was right here with me when the monologue about how dangerous and/or scary the basement is. As I was about to continue my sentence, I heard creepy laughing just off in the other room, not the basement, but on our level. Pikes and I looked at each other. “Go time,” he said. “Dude did you hear that? I think it was..”

And as I slinked into the other room I saw… Wolo… and I almost threw up. He was talking with one of the other employees I had not seen earlier, she must have just showed up. She looked like.. well, do you remember “Mimi,” from “The Drew Carey Show?” Wolo was notorious for hitting on anything with a pulse. He would probably fuck a chair if it had a heartbeat, or maybe not… The worst thing was I THINK she was chewing tobacco. Pikes and I shared a look. And then tried to stifle our laughs.

“Hey, you want to just leave him out of this one?” I said, knowing that at this point there was no redeeming Wolo for a ghost hunt. Pikes shook his head up and down, holding his mouth with his giant hands to stop from audibly laughing. “Good,” I snickered. Then, let’s go.

Immediately, the tone shifted. We weren’t in Kansas anymore. We weren’t in a slaughterhouse anymore. We were in what looked like the basement of a house set in the “Blair Witch project.” It was eerie. 

Getting right to business, Pikes started an EVP session. I started to video, using my phone. 

“Um.. (clearing his throat,) anyone here… umm.. if anyone is here, say your name or… making something move or something.” I looked at him, squinting my eyes and scrunching my nose like “what the hell was that we’ve done this before.” 

“Dude,” Pikes said, “Something just feels weird, sorry, just caught me off guard.” I understood. It was different, much different of an air that we’ve ever encountered. “No sweat mean, ju-“ WHOOOOSH

What the fuck was that. Something just moved right by my ear. As I tried to whip around to tell Pikes what happened… I couldn’t find him. I couldn’t see either. There was already little light, but now it felt like I was blind. My phone. Thank you, brain. I fumbled for what felt like hours, finally turning the flashlight on. It illuminated the space, thankfully. With it, I found Pikes, kneeling.

“Hey, you ok?” He nodded, acknowledging my question, but not answering. I told him something felt like it ran past me. He kept his position, not moving. Now, getting concerned, I wanted to grab his arm and maybe say let’s call this whole thing. 

“Hey big guy, maybe this one is – GET THE GUN

Both pikes and I flew onto our asses, respectively.  It wasn’t gentle either, like something pushed us both at the same time. Like something *Physically* pushed us. Beside the fact that two grown men were seemingly just tossed to the ground like children, the voice I heard was loud. Ear-splittingly loud.

Without thinking, I asked him to replay the last minute on his recorder. Without asking, he did. We both sat in silence, waiting to hear what I thought I heard. The replay told a very different story.

I did indeed hear what I thought, and judging by Pike’s face, it’s what he heard as well.

“*Get the gun… the gun..*

An other-worldly voice whispered. Whispered.. No way. I heard the voice of God. I think he did too. Stupidly, we were both carrying that night. (No one, including law enforcement, is allowed to be carrying a handgun, or any gun, while under the influence. The realization that something was actually here made my blood freeze. Speaking of blood, that’s what I saw. I yelled for Pikes. I yelled for Wolo. No response. Now in full panic-mode, I found the stairway. I climbed, in slow motion, toward the top. A black mist appeared. I don’t know if it was human. I’m sure it wasn’t. The “head,” of this “thing,” appeared to grow horns. That’s the last thing I remember.

Waking up, I was in the vehicle that brought us to the slaughterhouse. I groggily made my way to the door. Locked. I looked at my phone.  Called Wolo, called Pikes. Nothing. I texted, nothing. A text notification popped up. 

“What did you do?” From my wife. I tried to respond, but my hands went numb. I… don’t know, is all I could think. I said at the beginning that my friends died, but I don’t know that for sure. I’ve never seen them again. I never told anyone about this. I don’t know where I’m at this moment of you all reading this. I ran. I should have done the right thing and turned myself in, even though I pray that I had nothing to do with their disappearance. But again, I don’t know anything for sure. I’m just sorry it ended like this. And to my friends and family, this was not your fault. I hope I’ll see you again in another life.
