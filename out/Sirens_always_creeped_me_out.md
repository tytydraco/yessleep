**Sirens.**

Sirens always creeped me out. Whether it was an air raid siren like the ones from a horror movie like *Silent Hill*, or the screech of a fire siren echoing through small towns in rural Pennsylvania, I could never explain why—they just always creeped me out. Maybe it was what they represented? Or maybe it was simply the sound they made, so sudden and jarring.

That is until, my family and I moved out of town into the countryside, they bought a nice house with hundreds of acres, that now meant however, we were far enough away from town that we no longer had to be jolted awake by sirens whenever a poor family was dealing with a fire somewhere in the county.

Now with that all being said, on a fine summer evening, as I lounged in my bedroom playing video games on a Saturday night *(like any typical teenager)*, I was pulled from my immersion by the sound of my mother calling my name. But she wasn’t using her usual tone—the one that meant I needed to wash my dinner plate or take the trash out. No, this time, she sounded almost panicked. Confused.

I paused my game and came downstairs, stretching my arms and yawning after sitting in one spot for hours, my young bones cracking with sweet relief.

"Yeah, Ma?" I said grudgingly. But there was no response.

I scanned the living room. It was empty, the tv was on but the lights were off.

I walked into the kitchen. "Mom? What did you want?"

Still no response.

I groaned and walked to the front door, noticing it was open. Outside, I could hear multiple voices having a muffled conversation. I stepped up to the screen door and saw my mother talking to my dad and one of our neighbors. The bit of conversation I caught sent a chill down my spine.

"--Military checkpoints are being set up in town. They’re urging everyone to head home and stay indoors."

I chimed in, "Mom? Dad? What’s wrong? Why did you call me?"

My mother was biting her nails, standing anxiously as she bombarded our neighbor with questions. My dad walked up to the screen door, opened it, and beckoned me outside.

"Charles, something weird is going on. The army's in town. Stay inside. And don’t even think about riding that damn bike of yours into town like you always do. You hear me?"

I raised my brow curiously. "The army? Why are they here? Are terrorists coming to get us or somethin'?"

I wasn’t really scared. At that age, I had been desensitized from playing so many video games that military presence barely registered as a serious concern.

"I know just about as much as you do, bud," Dad said, his voice tense. "But I know one thing—your ass is grass if you leave this house. Do you understand me?"

"Yeah, Dad," I groaned.

Our neighbor chimed in. "This might have something to do with those strange electrical storms I saw while driving past the cornfields a few miles out of town. The sky looked an unnatural red color, and the clouds swirled like a tornado was about to touch down. But the strangest thing? They’ve got tanks down there. What the hell do they need tanks for if it’s just a storm?

The more they talked, the more I wanted to sneak out that night and take a nighttime bike ride into town. That is, if my dad hadn’t put the fear of God into me. I knew I’d be dead meat if I got caught, so I shut that idea down quickly.

I threw up my hands "Alright, I’m going back upstairs," I muttered, trotting back inside to continue my gaming session.

Before I knew it, 9 p.m. turned into midnight—that strange phenomenon all gamers experience when they lose themselves in a good game. My eyelids were getting heavy. I passed out with my game paused and my bedroom window open, letting the cool breeze tickle my cheek as I snored.

Then, thunder shook me awake.

We’ve all been there, when a rainstorm creeps up in the middle of the night and wakes you with a house rattling crack in the sky. I looked over at my alarm clock.

"3 a.m.? Ugh."

Groggily, I stood up, rubbing the sleep from my eyes. All that soda had caught up to me, so I rushed to the bathroom to relieve myself. On my way back to my bedroom, I moved to shut my window until I noticed a shape  far out in the yard.

I squinted, but it was all a blur. I fumbled around my bedside table for my glasses.  When I turned back, I saw her clearly.

A woman.

A very attractive blonde woman.

She was slightly closer to the house now, facing me. Something inside me felt...strange, though i couldn't formulate my thoughts as to what "it" was, it was like the first time I tried marijuana, I was incredibly relaxed but stuck in a thought loop. It was then I realized her eyes locked onto mine, flirtatious and inviting. She looked like a princess poised and radiant in the moonlight.

I noticed this at the time but couldn't bring myself to question it—there was a mist curling around her feet, it was subtle but visible, it was an eerie wine-red haze, creeping and writhing like living tendrils across the grass, it should have been unsettling, but it wasn't, It was beautiful, the way it rolled and pulsed at her heels, And with each coy step she took forward, the grass beneath her wilted and withered.

I barely noticed.

A knot formed in my stomach, but i couldn't look away. I felt compelled, like love at first sight. Then suddenly she stopped, still staring into my eyes, that flirtatious look remained.

I felt like i was dreaming, her presence felt intoxicating. Then, she started humming a soft, innocent melody.

A vision overtook me.

She was taking me somewhere. . . a paradise. A dream come true. I felt numb, weightless. I needed to go to her. That was all I knew. A voice whispered in the back of my head beckoning me to come outside.

Then, my mother's voice shattered the scenery around me.

"Charles! CHARLES! WAKE UP! Come downstairs, hurry!"

I gasped, ripping my gaze away, my head snapped toward my open bedroom door. My mother's voice was urgent. I hesitated, glancing back at the woman—she hadn’t moved, still staring. I exhaled sharply, then ran downstairs in a strange bout of frustration.

Outside, my parents stood on the deck, pointing toward town.

I could hear it now.

The sirens.

Above the town, a crimson, swirling cloud hovered, its core a gaping hole. It wasn’t natural. I tried to tell my parents about the woman, but they wouldn’t listen.

"We need to leave. Now."

I rushed to get my shoes on—no socks, still in my pajamas. As I ran outside toward the car, I saw my neighbor standing in the yard, motionless. His expression was blank. Empty.

And the woman was there.

Humming.

He shambled toward her like a zombie, Her expression remained flirtatious—until he was close enough. Then, it changed.

Her eyes turned black. Her lips twisted into a malicious grin. Her teeth turned jagged and sharp. He dropped on his knees Infront of her looking up to her like a subservient dog.

She looked down at him and grinned, she placed her hand gently on the back of his head… and with her long sharp nails, slit his throat gingerly, like a violin player ending a crescendo.

The worst part of all of this was his reaction, he didn't make a sound. His body convulsed and spasmed violently as she pulled him to his feet, drinking from the gaping wound. His skin turned pale, then slowly withered as if the life had been drained from him, he looked like one of those frozen corpses hikers would find in the Himalayas.

I couldn't look away, my body's response to fear has always been freeze, It felt like I was paralyzed and unable to move.

I felt... that awful, gut-wrenching drop in my stomach hitting all at once. Distant sirens wailed, their echoes bouncing between the houses, and somewhere beyond, gunshots cracked through the air like firecrackers on the Fourth of July. It was then i felt My dad's grip on my shoulder rough and urgent as he yanked me toward the car, throwing me into the back seat and slammed the door shut. With shaking hands, he jammed the keys into the ignition, And the engine roared to life. The tires screeched against the pavement as we peeled out of the driveway.

That’s when I saw her.

The woman.

Standing in the street. Smiling.

A slow, knowing smile that sent a shiver down my spine, crawling up my arms like a thousand tiny insects. I turned away, pressing myself against the seat, but her face burned itself into my mind.

As our house faded into the distance, my father spat out curses between clenched teeth, gripping the steering wheel so tight his knuckles turned white. "We gotta go through town," he muttered, barely above a whisper. "Only way out of the county."

My mother sobbed quietly in the passenger seat.

I slouched down, heart hammering, my mind running a thousand miles an hour.

The sky had turned blood-red. Not a sunset kind of red—something worse, something sickly. Almost wine red, thick and seeping, like the whole world was bleeding out above us. Thunder rolled overhead, deep and guttural, the kind you feel in your ribs. I craned my neck, looking up at the swirling mass of clouds. Something was inside. Something moving. The lightning flashed, striking buildings too close for comfort. And for a split second between the lightning strikes illuminating the area, I swore—if I squinted just right—I could see them.

Silhouettes. In the eye of the storm.

Winged.

Circling.

Watching.

The car jerked hard to the right, tires skidding. My dad swerved to avoid something, but my stomach turned as I looked out at the streets.

Bodies.

Men in military uniforms littered the ground like broken dolls, their faces hollowed out, skin shriveled and gray like dried fruit. Every single one of them drained—withered—lifeless.

And then there were the women.

Dozens of them. Maybe hundreds. Standing. Watching. And the soldiers—they weren’t fighting. They were walking toward them, arms limp at their sides, moving like puppets with their strings cut. No weapons. No resistance. Just... surrendering.

It was a sight I wouldn’t wish on my worst enemy.

We sped past them. The car weaved through wreckage—tanks driven into the sides of buildings, overturned vehicles, toppled streetlights. More bodies. More carnage. I caught glimpses of soldiers held up by their throats, feet dangling above the pavement, the life draining from them in slow, agonizing moments. Some were already on their knees, waiting for it to happen.

My dad slammed his foot down on the gas pedal. The engine whined, the whole car rattling as we tore past the last row of buildings, heading straight for the cornfields.

The moment we cleared the town, he exhaled, voice shaking as he grabbed my mom’s trembling hand.

“We’re gonna make it,” he said. “God help us, we’re going to ma—”

The car jerked violently.

A flash of movement.

The world flipped.

Then—

Nothing.

I came to, hanging upside down.

The car was wrecked. Metal twisted and broken, glass shattered everywhere. My head throbbed, my vision blurred. My ankle—something was wrong with it. Felt hot, swollen.

I called out.

No answer.

My mom and dad were gone.

I twisted, crawling through the shattered window, dragging myself out onto the cold, damp grass. The sirens still screamed from town. I looked up. The cloud had grown bigger.

Something moved in the corner of my eye.

My dad.

Shambling into the field.

My mom was chasing after him, stumbling, arms outstretched. “David!” she screamed. “David, come back!”

Tears burned my eyes, hot against my dirt-streaked face.

Then—

A shadow fell over her.

A winged shape dropped from the sky, its arms wrapping around her like she weighed nothing at all. She barely had time to scream before it lifted her off the ground, carrying her upward, vanishing into the storm.

My dad kept walking.

He never turned back.

I lay there, staring up into the swirling sky, my chest rising and falling with shallow, shaky breaths. The stars were gone now, swallowed whole by the storm. The humming started again—a low, familiar tune that sent a shiver through my bones.

A shadow loomed over me.

The woman.

That same smile on her face.

She knelt beside me, brushing a strand of hair from my forehead. Her fingers were ice-cold.

My final thought creeped in

"My paradise is waiting"
