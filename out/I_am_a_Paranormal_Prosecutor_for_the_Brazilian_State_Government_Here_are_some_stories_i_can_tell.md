Throughout history, there have been tales of the paranormal, of ghosts and monsters, rituals and curses. Although easy to dismiss such stories as the product of the fertile human imagination, unable to fully comprehend the natural world, most of them are true or have a foundation of truth within them, and I am a Paranormal Prosecutor.

“Prosecutor” is what my office is commonly referred to as. A joke, that became a nickname, that became a title. But I am, really, a state-sanctioned ghost hunter, a public employee that deals in matters otherwordly. I am, by day, a lawyer. I work cases from theft, robbery, drug traffic, and even murder, and at night I venture into the nooks and crannies of town to fulfill whatever task have been assigned to me.

First off, why share? Well, I’ve been on this job for about ten years now, I have been a lawyer for about twelve, and I haven’t written anything that isn’t an academic paper. Since this is a place to share this type of story, I figured it would be fun. It’s not really a very secretive job and I can talk about anything that isn’t in secret of justice – and even what is I can give you some broad strokes. These are some accounts of mine I can tell you about.

I had my initial jobs working on hauntings since they’re entrance-level stuff. The very first assignment I had was in a graveyard where a little girl’s spirit was supposedly roaming the place. I’ll tell you, no matter how prepared you think you are to face the supernatural, it will always affect you in some primal way, a natural response of fear is triggered no matter how tough you think yourself to be, this being also the main reason why many people quit so shortly after being invested into the job. I had stayed up from 18:00 to 03:00 and was starting to get drowsy, sitting on top of a large ornamented tombstone, when I felt a cold hand on my shoulder. Suddenly I turned around in a jolt just to see nobody behind me, but I could hear the sound of laughter mixed with the crying of a little girl.

This being my first encounter, I was ill-prepared, but had read and heard accounts from veterans on the job. Despite horror movies painting ghosts as scary and evil, they’re sad and lonely things – but scary, yes. I recognized that, as despite the initial shock and dread of the situation, a sad melancholy started to set in, and the light, chill breeze of the evening started blowing. That night, although scared, I sat there talking to the air as you would to a child. I sang some nursery rhymes, what stirred the air with a seething tingle of anger, which made me notice this kid probably thought she was “too grown up” for such childish singing. I played hide and seek, told unfunny dad jokes, and, with the chirping of morning birds, felt the melancholy fade into a nice serenity. The little girl decided to, finally, rest.

This line of work is quite fulfilling, but not always so charming. As a Paranormal Prosecutor, under the watchful eye of the Public Ministry and with the helping hand of the State Civil Police, your “office” job gets much more hands-on than the usual “Dr.” work. I might expand on the interesting little judicial quandary that is this piece of the world further down the line if anyone is interested. But, for now, so as to not bore the less academically inclined, on with it.

The other story I have to share is that of the first curse I worked on, the second or third case I got. It’s got a very anticlimactic ending but I guess could work as a sort of cautionary tale for the reader.

This was a regular nuclear family home, but they were having some marital problems and the son was the grouchy teen type, who loved to curse. A Christian homestead, however, won’t allow the foulest of vulgar words, so he chose the more innocuous ones like “damn it”, “curse this”, and even the occasional “hell”. Thing is, words, like objects, have power. You can have a good or a bad luck charm. In a religious environment, stuff like that get turned up to eleven, and the influence of words – which is really just the amazingly powerful human conscious and unconscious mind doing its thing to affect the world around it – can do some pretty undesirable things.

Lo and behold, that family was cursed. “Disgrace” is a pretty common kind of curse. This calls forth some usually hidden beings to feed off on the negative energy, and to also scare and traumatize you to get more negativity out. That’s to say, you curse yourself into being haunted, a bargain of one for the price of two. As I entered the house, it had a heavy, foreboding feel. You could feel a looming presence as long as you stood close to the family. In actuality, the house was no problem, but the people within it. I roamed around, snooped, and peeked everywhere so as to not discard the possibility of an actual autonomous haunting, did an interview, and then left.

Really, you know what helped those people? Therapy. That and some salt sprinkling, chant singing here and there, and a priest – that was mostly for show, however, because they had to feel like something was being actively done. But all in all, the good old earthly treatment is usually the best way to get you fixed up, especially when it comes to things that feed off emotions. The solution to an extraordinary problem does not have to be fantastical. Most of the work that comes through is like this - you only hear about the cool parts, though.

I would also like to go on about the first time I met a “creature”, to finish off strong. You see, for a Paranormal Prosecutor, as for a regular one, you have “levels” of entrance – initial to intermediate, and then to final, when you get the more complex cases. You start off dealing with initial entrance stuff, in determined “low-level” areas, the “ghosts” as you call them, minor curses, and dismantling already finalized rituals. Things to get you on the groove of the job. Actual physical beings are usually intermediate to advanced, and they show up in more rural, wooded, or just generally secluded areas.

Where I live and act, in the Capital of the southernmost Brazilian state, and its metropolitan area, as is in the country in general, there is a big incidence of physical paranormal occurrences, referred to sometimes as creatures. Yes, that includes the well-known werewolves, chupacabra and imps. There’s also the happy local residents, such as the mapinguary, headless mules and boitatás.

I had recently been assigned an advisor, which here is basically a partner – until my first three months I was all by myself, but later on I got a full, very competent consultancy team. Her name was Agatha, a stocky, short, long black-haired, and deeply religious catholic woman with an attitude. She also was a newbie and as such we got along very well figuring out the ins and outs of the work – because despite the amount you have to study to pass the exam and the initial course and lectures they give you to get acquainted, when dealing with practical problems you always find yourself in a learning position.

It was about 02:00 and we were heading to a location where, supposedly, a ritual for a curse was taking place earlier, so I had to go dismantle it and deal with any potential fallout that might have been left. Driving my trusty Chevrolet Chevette, windows down, the warm summer night made bright with the orange lights from the street poles, and alive with the sound of Layla blasting from my speakers, we arrived at the place around 02:10, empty streets making the drive more enjoyable and, especially, faster.

The apartment complex the call was related to was shoddy and decrepit. We entered through a broken down wooden door and, just as we got in, there wasn’t the usual sense of wrongness a curse brings with it, no heavy air, no cold, nothing. A wrong call? Sadly not. Agatha carried an old .38 revolver and kept a crucifix on her neck, I had a dog skull in hand and brass knuckles in a fist.

Now, the weapons go without saying, but the trinkets are very handy things you ought to have in the job, they help keep evil at bay by working as power objects and good luck charms. They need not be inherently magical, the simple act of having them and the attachment you have to them are enough to keep lowly phantasms, bad luck (which is a hassle, believe me), and lesser curses at bay. A little penny you cherish will scare away a monster as much as a cross. That being said, Agatha is a Christian gun nut; I used to be a brawler and like to collect skulls, and this one specifically is from an old dog I had cared for when I was younger – morbid, yes, effective? You bet.

The rotting walls and dirty floors of the complex were not a welcoming sight, but not an unusual one downtown. We kept going up the badly lit stairs to the second floor and, as we finished our ascent, we saw it. The thing was weirdly emaciated yet muscular, had pale, wet skin, with a long, fine black mane that ran from its head down its thick neck. It walked on all fours with a hunched back, hooves on the hind legs, and long, skinny, and clawed paws on the front. A human-like face with wide cross eyes in their sunken sockets stared at us, and a large, long mouth hanging agape that was as that of a horse, sharp irregular teeth within it, drooled over the floor. We smelled the metallic scent of blood, and the stench of rotting meat, but saw nothing on the way in.

We had no idea what that thing was. Still don’t. I had never heard of anything like it, and to this day I have not heard of something alike. In training they give you broad instructions, and when in doubt, by a quick assessment, we were told that the feeling of a situation and the look of a thing, in regards to this line of work, was enough to tell you right away if it warranted a friendly or hostile response. The moment we saw that horse-man-thing, fight or flight kicked in, adrenaline pumped and, well, hostility started.

Agatha cocked her weapon and fired a shot, one besides the thing to see if it would run. It didn’t move, but tilted its head as would a curious dog. She fired again, aimed at the head. The gun jammed. Bad luck finds a way sometimes. In moments where you don’t know what to do, such as new and unexpected situations, you reset back to what you know, and so my usual run-it-down response kicked in – an utmost bright idea, may I add. I rushed the creature, with full intent of throwing it off balance with the charge, it standing still as I drew in closer. On contact, it got thrown to the side, quickly getting up and letting out a high-pitched horse-like shriek.

As it lunged at me, I realized the trouble I was in the moment its mouth opened wider than it was before and those teeth came flying towards my face. I prepared the good old knuckle dusters for a heavy impact at the center of mass, but a shot to the creature’s face stopped it just in time. 

“*Whatever the fuck was that, Doc?*” my advisor asked, shaking from the adrenaline, her .38 smoking.

“*No idea. Let’s find out, I guess. Get the forms in the car, I’ll get a look at this pretty boy while you’re at it*.” 

As I said that, trying to hide my own shock, I turned around to notice the thing was gone. Just gone. It made no sound getting up, we, although right beside it, saw nothing thanks to the dim lighting and rushing thoughts. Its blood, chunks of flesh and bone from the surprisingly easily blown off head laid there on the floor still.

After the whole ordeal, as is praxis, we called the police, looked around for anything, knocked on a few doors, and left. People had called the department about weird animals in the same neighborhood but that thing’s description never came up. The samples we got came back with no matching results. All in all, I was very fond of having found a new cryptid you could call it, but the experience shook me and, while not necessarily traumatized, it helped me understand the value of preparedness even when given a clear summary of the task.

There have been many reports of missing toddlers and children in that area, and the next day we had been told that, although no infants lived in that apartment building, all the local pets had vanished overnight. Whatever that thing was, I honestly am scared to find it again, because although I deal in the supernatural, I haven’t seen any living, physical beings that would so nimbly and quickly get away without their head. God forbid something like that shows up again. Honestly to this day one of the freakier and creepiest things I have seen.

For now, to not bore you all, this is what I have to share. If anyone is interested, I can post a follow-up talking about other interesting things I have dealt with, as well as shed light on this, honestly, very thriving and fulfilling line of work. Looking forward to answering any questions in the comments as well!
