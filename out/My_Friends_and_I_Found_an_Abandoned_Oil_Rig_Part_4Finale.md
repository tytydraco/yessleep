The silence was broken only by Savannah’s uneven breathing and Maria’s quiet sobs. The harsh glow of the maintenance corridor flickered intermittently, casting our solemn shadows dancing across the rust-stained walls.

Savannah had stopped crying and now stared blankly into space, her face hollowed by grief and disbelief. Maria sat huddled nearby, her eyes red-rimmed and unfocused, mouthing a word over and over. Mark’s body lay between us three, evidently unmoved for years.

None of us dared speak. Words felt useless. All that remained was the cold, creeping dread.

I checked my watch again, though I knew that by now, time had ceased to mean anything. I thought back to Mark, his panicked insistence that we only had five hours left, even though we had closer to seven. I shivered at the thought, the nauseating truth slowly crystallizing in my mind. The distortions, the inexplicable shifts. Mark’s body, a dry husk, only minutes old. 

Time was splintering, fracturing around us—and we were caught in its collapse.

The intercom ahead crackled to life, startling us all. The voice was strained, exhausted, desperate. There was something more than fear in it this time, there was sorrow. I could hear them crying.

“Please, please come back. I know you’re hurt. I know it seems hopeless, but I think there’s still a chance. You  can still help me, and maybe… maybe I can still help you.”

Savannah’s eyes snapped to the intercom, fury blazing behind her grief.

“Help you? Help YOU?! Mark is DEAD! Julian’s DEAD! You promised us answers and safety, and now they’re gone! What do you want from us?!”

Her voice cracked, breaking into choking sobs as she collapsed against the wall. The intercom sat silent for a long moment before the voice spoke again, almost a whisper.

“I’m so sorry. I thought… I thought it would go differently this time. But please… I think things can still be made right. I NEED your help. Savannah, Maria… Elijah. We can make sure it goes right. We can make sure they never die.”

Maria’s head shot up, her eyes suddenly clear, desperate hope cutting through the tears. She rose to her feet, her legs shaking but decided.

“You said that last time, and now both Julian and Mark are… they’re dead. That can’t just be undone.”

Static buzzed softly through the speaker, punctuated by the faint dripping somewhere far away.

“You’ve seen it already,” the voice said softly. “How time here is broken. We’re caught in something we don’t understand, but if you can get to me then I can help. There’s a console in the room I’m in, and I think it controls the facility. I don’t know how to use it, but together, we might be able to fix it. Together. There’s still hope.”

The speaker clicked off abruptly, leaving the three of us staring at the floor. Savannah looked hollow and defeated, Maria desperate. Both of them turned their heads my way, and I realized that now, the decision fell to me.

I swallowed hard, forcing down the lump of dread lodged deep in my throat. My voice trembled.

“We don’t have a choice,” I said. “We could leave now, but twenty-eight hours in the lander could become a thousand years, and we’d just end up like Mark—or we move forward. Maybe we can.. I don’t know, go back and save them? Maybe we have a chance. But only if we keep going.”

Savannah’s face darkened, defiance struggling against despair. After a long pause, she stood shakily, tears still streaming down her cheeks.

“I can’t… I can’t leave Mark here. Not like this.”

Maria moved closer, placing a gentle hand on Savannah’s shoulder. She gave me a look, and I sighed.

I stooped down to the ground, gently picking Mark up. His withered corpse was much lighter than I’d expected, dried and lacking all substance. I stood, and silently made our way to the junction we’d now crossed several times before.

Savannah trailed behind as I carried him down the unexplained corridor straight ahead, marked as Habitation. It didn’t take long to find a suitable place to lay him to rest. A door to our right laid cracked open, and inside was what appeared to be a communal bedroom. One bed stood out among the rest, positioned neatly in the middle of the room, illuminated by a single light from above. The sheets were dusty and ragged, but neatly laid across the bed.

Maria gently lifted the sheet, coughing as a cloud of ash and dust arose from beneath, tattered and rotted clothes filling the space under the sheets. Savannah gently removed Mark’s boots, and I laid Mark down in the bed, amidst the ash and the tattered rags that matched his. Savannah went to place the boots in the corner of the room, where dozens of identical pairs in varying states of decay already lie waiting.

As I gently covered up his body with the sheets, I prayed that this was the last time he’d need to be laid to rest here.

Together, in heavy silence, we retraced the steps we’d made through the twisting labyrinth of the maintenance corridors. Rusted pipes and warped metal walls seemed tighter with every step we took back toward the triple bypass chamber. Every sound echoed- our footfalls, our breathing, even our heartbeats reverberated around us, amplifying the tension that etched away at my nerves.

Finally, as we descended the final set of stairs, the bypass chamber lay ahead of us, its heavy reinforced door waiting ahead. The room beyond and the voice trapped within waited in silence. 

The three valves, spaced evenly apart, stared back at us. 

“Okay,” I said softly, forcing a shaky confidence I didn’t feel. “Savannah, Maria and I made it down here before, and to get through each of those needs to be turned simultaneously. It’s the only way forward. I’m guessing the pressure will force the door open fairly quickly, so get out of the way as soon as you can. On three, we turn.”

We moved into position. Maria on the left, Savannah on the right, me at the center. My palms were slicked with cold sweat as I gripped the rusted wheel.

“One.”

I heard a small sob from Savannah.

“Two.”

Maria closed her eyes, mouthing something silently. Julian’s name.

“Three.”

The valves turned, metal grinding against rusted joints, groaning in protest until something within the walls clicked into place. A loud hiss echoed through the chamber as ancient locks disengaged. We backed away quickly, waiting for the door to swing open before us. 

The door cracked slightly for just a moment, and cold, damp air rushed out, filling the room with the smell of salt and decay. As it did, my stomach lurched, as a familiar blue shimmer shot through the air. As I blinked, I gasped in shock to find myself when I stood seconds prior, immediately in front of the door. As the door creaked and begun to swing open rapidly, I leapt back just in time to see another flash pass through Savannah and Maria.

Maria shimmered in the air for a second, similarly reappearing where she had stood opening the valve. She didn’t have enough time to react, and as the door burst open, it slammed into her, knocking her off her feet and sending her flying before she landed with a dull thump on the steel floor.

As I ran over to aid her, I turned back towards the door. I wish I hadn’t. 

Savannah had similarly been reset in per position, her body where it had been when she’d turned the knob. Occupying the same space, however, was the immense metal door that had swung out. Her outstretched arm twitched, poking through the solid metal like a tree emerging from the ground. Her face, half swallowed up by wrought steel, locked in a gasp. Her eye locked on to me before spiraling into a spasm, as a trickle of blood began to run out of her exposed nostril.

The intercom crackled frantically, the voice barely audible through thickening static.

“The loop is destabilizing! You have to get in here NOW! There’s no more time!”

I turned back Maria and attempting to rouse her from the floor. Her skin was cold to the touch, and as I felt for a pulse, I could discern a weak, unsteady heartbeat.

“Maria please, please wake up. We have to go, we have to go now, please!”

No response. 

I looked towards the outstretched door. Inside was our last chance at fixing this, we couldn’t wait a second longer. I pulled Maria into a fireman’s carry, and trudged towards the outstretched door. As we crossed through it, it slammed shut behind us, and I heard its three mechanical locks click shut. 

The room inside was almost as cavernous as the one we’d encountered in the research wing, its high ceiling swallowed by shadows. Countless monitors flickered around us, screens cycling through meaningless data and distorted video feeds. Thick bundles of cables snaked along the floor, disappearing into a pit almost as large as the one that the one that had swallowed Julian up. Immensely large pumps filled the room, some pipes siphoning from the depths below while others passed through the wall to whatever chamber lie ahead. 

Across the way there was another heavy bulkhead, emblazoned with familiar white letters: “W&H TEMPORAL ANOMALY CONTAINMENT – OBSERVATION DECK”.

A terminal beside it blinked urgently. I carried Maria across the hall, and without hesitation, I moved to the control panel, hands shaking as I attempted to access the observation deck from where the voice called out.

A new warning flashed on-screen, bright red:

CONTAINMENT COMPROMISED – OBSERVATION DECK FLOODING IMMINENT. MANUAL OVERRIDE REQUIRED.

As I stared at the screen, the intercom hissed to life, frantic now. 

“Through the door, hurry! I’m in here, activate the purge and get inside! Please! It’s almost too late!”

I slammed my fist on the override. The chamber shook violently, alarms blaring as all the pumps in the chamber shook violently, and began furiously pumping water into the pit below.

Beside me, Maria coughed suddenly, her body shaking against the wet floor as she began to seize. I rushed to her side, lifting her gently, panic rising in my throat as I found her pulse become more erratic, her breathing shallow.

“No, Maria… come on, stay with me!” I shouted desperately, but she lay unresponsive in my arms.

I turned back to the intercom, fury eclipsing my fear.

“Did you know? Did you know that I’d be the only one to make it this far? Has this all happened before?”

The voice crackled back, broken and defeated:

“I’m sorry… please, just open the door…”

Rage overtook me. A boiling, uncontrollable anger. 

“I won’t let this happen again. I can’t let you live.”

My hand hovered over the control, hesitating and trembling - then slammed onto the flood control override.

The pumps paused for a moment, and I heard them roar back to life, pumping water back into the small room. Water roared violently behind the bulkhead door, overwhelming the speakers, drowning out the voice’s anguished screams.

I waited until the room fell quiet again. Then, with numb fingers, I reactivated the pumps. Slowly, the floodwaters receded behind the sealed door, leaving the chamber silent once more.

The door hissed open, and with Maria limp in my arms, I stepped inside. She was cold in my arms, her head resting against my shoulder, her breath slow and faint.

The observation deck was quiet. Water pooled in shallow layers across the floor, sloshing beneath my boots as I stepped forward. The monitors inside still hummed with life, bolted to the floor and walls, seemingly waterproofed.

Banks of equipment lined the walls, lights blinking in slow, useless rhythms. A ring of thick conduit cables fed into a central pedestal, at the center of which stood a chair, its frame dripping with more of that strange, blue fluid we’d seen in the research wing. It oozed from the machinery like blood from a wound, seeping across the floor and spiraling through the water like octopus ink. Everything here smelled of salt, copper, and something sweetly rotten.

And then I saw them. My breath caught in my throat, and I froze mid-step.

Floating in the far corner of the room were two bodies. Face down on the floor in a swirling pool of that blue ichor, like insects in amber.

The nearest one was wearing my clothes.

I walked over, steps unsure, with shaky breath. I stared down at my own drowned face, eyes wide and blank, a tangle of dark hair waving in the shallow water like seaweed. 

Next to the other me, her hand barely touching mine, was another Maria.

I staggered back, nearly slipping on the wet floor as I felt my body lurch to vomit, disgust surging through me. I looked down at the Maria I carried - real, injured but breathing - and then back at her lifeless corpse.

This had already happened, and it was happening again.

Or hadn’t happened yet.

I didn’t know anymore. None of it made sense. Things were folding in on each other like houses in a storm. Julian. Mark. Savannah. Me.

Maria.

We’d all been here before. We were here now, and maybe always.

I set Maria gently down into the chair, brushing her wet hair from her forehead. Her pulse was still weak, but steady. I glanced up at the camera in the corner of the room, blinking slowly through condensation.

It was several hours before I couldn’t stand to look at our own bodies anymore. With effort, I hoisted them up, and pushed them into the pit that lay in the chamber behind me. It wouldn’t matter, there would be another chance. That wouldn’t be me. 

My hands trembled as I sat at the terminal beside the chair. The keyboard was stiff, half of the keys jammed with salt and rust. I wiped the screen with my sleeve, and a prompt appeared:

SATELLITE UPLINK STANDBY – CONNECTION ACTIVE
– ONLINE MESSAGING ON STANDBY

I stared at the cursor blinking back at me, and I began to type this all out.

I don’t know who will find this. Or when. Or if anyone even can.

My name is Elijah. 

I came here with my old UrbEx group, Mark and Savannah. My sister, Maria, her boyfriend Julian. 

We were just supposed to explore a rig. One last big adventure.

I’ve watched them all die. One by one. Some more than once.
Time is broken here. It loops. Collapses.

But it always ends the same.

I think I’ve reached the end now.

The chamber is starting to flood again.
The water’s creeping up past my boots, Maria’s still unconscious beside me. I think… I think she’s breathing. Maybe this time, she’ll wake up before it fills the room.

I want to believe we’ll get out.
I want to believe this isn’t the end.

But if it is…

If this message somehow gets out—if this upload reaches you, whoever you are, don’t come looking. Don’t follow the signal.

The pumps are failing again.

I’m looking at the monitor beside me, flickering with the video feeds of the facility. As I write this, something is catching my eye.

One of the feeds is labeled “Cam-01. Surface Platform.”

I can see the helicopter.

I can see us unloading our bags.

Tiny on the screen, just dots on the helipad. But I’d know us anywhere.

Mark. Julian. Savannah. Maria.

And me.

We’ve just landed, and we’re laughing. Alive.

I’m watching myself comfort my sister as she stares out into the blackness of the sea.

I know they won’t be able to hear me until the morning, when they go to check the broadcast I’m sending to the control deck up top, but I know that I’m going to ask for their help. I’ll warn them of everything that I think the’ll understand, as little as that would be. I’ll do my best to get them down as quickly as possible, to rescue Maria and I down here. 

Maybe this time they’ll listen to me. 
Maybe this time will be different.
