I made a post yesterday. Talking about Saintviews- my hometown. The only home I've ever known. And how it's unraveling before my eyes. 

Here's the post: (https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/8UXyH60jev)

A few days ago. I noticed there's a cloud here. It doesn't move. It stays perfectly unfazed by all the elements. And unaffected by time. It's been there for 17 years. And I'm the only one who seems to have noticed. 

I'm not sure if I regret making the post and asking for help. But I know one thing for sure- it made things worse. 

At the very least- reddit has kept me somewhat sane. I even made a post on two sentence horror. It was fun. Helped me forget my situation for a few minutes. 

I was scrolling my phone, laid on the bed of my rundown motel room. A few reddit users responded to my first post. One caught my attention. This has happened to someone else before. And I'm researching it later tonight- if tonight happens. I'll come back with what I can figure out. 

But yeah, when I say "if tonight happens"- I mean, time is acting... strange. 

At first I thought it was my phone. I caught a glimpse of the time- 2:59pm... and went on searching on whatever site I thought would help me get some leads. 

Then... the clock kept counting. 

2:60pm...

2:61pm...

2:62pm...

I sat up. Breathing heavily in the silence- silence I realized wasn't there just a few moments ago. My neighbors aren't the considerate type. But their music just cut off at the 2:60pm mark. 

I climb out of bed. Into the midday sun. The outside corridor is littered with beer bottles and reeks of piss. But I will myself to go knock on their door. 

No response. 

Not that I expected one... 

I wandered on to the front desk. The office itself smelt of mildew and was vaguely organized just for convince. 

"Motel-12, A lovely rest in Saintviews, just waiting to happen"- the posters on the walls read. The carpet was prickly against my bare socks. And I felt mildly embarrassed over being in my pajamas. But I had to figure out what was happening. 

I check my phone again... 2:65pm. 

"Hello? I hate to disturb you... ma'am- but do you maybe have the time?"

Nothing. 

She's hunched over on her work desk. Her hair tied into a tight bun. Pitch black along with her dress-shirt. She's writing something down. It must be important since she didn't at all hear me. 

I ask again. "Ma'am? Do you know what time it is? I think my phone is broken"

Nothing. 

My frustration builds quickly. But dies down almost immediately as I take another step. Glancing down at her desk. The messy landscape of... actually I'm not sure what she was filling out. She works in a motel... 

My eyes follow her hand. The delicate grip on her pen. Writing out- Room 17. 

Then...undoing it.

Not erasing it. No- I mean undoing it. Going backwards. The ink somehow drawls it's way right up her pen, her lovely penmanship curling in on itself- as if it never existed. 

Then the moment the line is blank, she once again writes - Room 17. 

I stood there until 2:72pm. 

She did it. Over and over and over again. Perfectly. Like a video on some twisted loop. There was no mistake to be made because this wasn't human nature. 

Her expression is blank with exhaustion. From a hard day of work. But with enough observation, her entire body is reseting. The creak in her shoulder. The tap she makes against the desk, every time she writes the first 'o'. And how the first and second tap switch their pitches when she undid her writing. 

I stepped back. Until I reached the door. Knowing that this isn't just my imagination. 

...

Right now. I'm on a park bench. 

The dog park, near the Presbyterian church. 

It's 2:109pm...

It wasn't just the lady. 

My entire town is on a loop. Steps taken and retracted. Fluttering in the breeze being undone. Turns being unmade, then made again by families in their cars. 

I passed the homeless ex-soldier on the way here. He's chewing on something that didn't look edible. It still had fur. He's bitting in on meal, blood dripping out and climbing right back up is jaw.

It's unsettling- sure. 

But what makes it worse is the silence. 

The scribble of her pen back at the motel? Cars that should be making some whine from their engines? Steps from dog owners and dogs alike? Nothing. They simply undo their own existences in perpetuity. 

I'd panic. But...why would I? There's nothing to run from. 

It's peaceful. Not in a comforting way- but... even the sun is stood still. Probably stuck on a loop of it's own, just too big to comprehend. Scorching us in place. If it has no hope of escape, how do I?

I stare at my potential jailer.

Can you outrun a cloud? The only constant? Still floating above us all in it's divine condescension. 

It has something to do with this, I know it does. 

My town is unraveling. 

And I don't think I have much time left here.

I'm going to try to leave tonight... again.

Wish me luck. I'll keep you updated.
