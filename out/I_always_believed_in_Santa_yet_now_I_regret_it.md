Lying beneath my feet is an impossibly small figure. Something about its shape sets my teeth on edge. Those pointed ears, now matted with blood, remind me of the elves from Christmas stories—but no elf was ever this grotesque. A deep dread settles in my stomach as its crimson blood seeps into the fibers of my carpet.

It started with scratching sounds from downstairs. At first, I dismissed it as the house settling, but then came the unmistakable rip of wrapping paper being torn. My first thought was mice—or maybe a burglar. Grabbing the baseball bat I kept under my bed, I crept downstairs. Each step groaned beneath my weight, no matter how carefully I moved.

The Christmas tree lights were still on, their multicolored glow casting strange shadows across the walls. At first, I didn’t see anything unusual—just the faint hum of the lights and the faint smell of pine. But then, beneath the tree, a figure moved. Small, hunched, and precise, it was rummaging through the presents with almost mechanical precision.

It wasn’t an animal. It wasn’t a child.

My heart thudded as I reached for the light switch.

The overhead lights blazed on, and time seemed to freeze. The creature turned to face me, and I almost wished it hadn’t. Its features were a twisted parody of humanity. Bulging, oversized eyes dominated its face, and its grin stretched too wide, revealing teeth like shards of glass.

For a moment, we stared at each other, paralyzed in mutual horror.

Then it moved.

It screamed—a sound like nails dragging across a chalkboard—before leaping at me. Its teeth sank into my arm, a fiery burst of pain ripping through me. I swung the bat without thinking. The crack of impact was deafening, followed by a wet, sickening thud.

I stumbled back, panting, staring at the crumpled body on the floor. My arm throbbed where it had bitten me, blood dripping onto the carpet. Oh God. Oh God, I killed it. I killed something.

But as I tried to process what had happened, the air shifted. The temperature dropped sharply, and every instinct screamed at me to turn around.

I didn’t want to.

I couldn’t stop myself.

Behind me, in the doorway, stood a man in a crimson suit. Massive and imposing, his form seemed to fill the entire room. His snowy beard couldn’t hide the wide, gleeful smile stretching across his face. But this wasn’t the Santa of childhood stories.

No.

The lights from the Christmas tree cast his shadow on the wall, but it didn’t match his shape. The distorted silhouette loomed with spindly limbs and clawed hands, twitching in unnatural ways.

I tried to run, but my feet slipped in the blood pooling on the floor. The bat clattered from my fingers as I fell.

He laughed, the sound hollow and echoing, coming from everywhere and nowhere.

“Oh dear, oh dear,” he said, his voice like frost scraping against glass. “What a mess you’ve made. But don’t worry—we never waste a potential helper.”

Before I could scream, his gloved hand clamped over my mouth, the other wrapping around my torso like a vice. He lifted me effortlessly, as though I weighed nothing at all. His eyes glittered with an unnatural light, and a cruel warmth seeped into his smile.

That’s when the change began.

It started with my bones. They cracked and splintered, then reformed with an audible pop. My limbs twisted, shrinking, contorting. Pain consumed me as my muscles tore apart and stitched themselves back together. My skin burned like it was being peeled away and replaced. I clawed at myself, trying to stop it, but my fingers—now impossibly small—scrabbled uselessly.

But worse than the physical changes was the shift in my mind. Something alien took root, pushing me out, shoving my thoughts into a tiny, locked corner. Instincts I didn’t recognize rose to the surface: a need to serve, to obey, to create toys, to prepare for next Christmas.

I screamed in my head, but the sound couldn’t escape.

Finally, the transformation stopped. He set me down gently, brushing a gloved hand over my newly pointed ears.

“Welcome to the family,” he said warmly, his voice like bells and thunder. “We have so much work to do.”

I wanted to fight, to scream, to resist, but my new instincts overpowered me. They forced me to smile—a grotesque grin stretching far too wide across my face. “Yes, sir,” I chirped, the words spilling out unbidden.

As I followed him toward the chimney, my new feet leaving bloody prints on the floor, I caught a glimpse of my reflection in a silver ornament.

Staring back at me was a twisted little elf, its face split into an unnaturally cheerful grin. And behind me, the creature I had killed began to stir, its features slowly reverting to human.

My shadow danced in the ornament’s distorted surface, no longer my own.
