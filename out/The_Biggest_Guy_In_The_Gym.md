For starters, I’m seventeen and I’ve been bodybuilding since I was fourteen. Anyway, this summer, I had the beautiful liberty of going to the gym at one o’clock in the afternoon, when it was the least crowded in the day. This in mind, you can likely imagine how much I was dreading having to go at three o’clock, when it is most crowded, after school everyday. 

So with this in mind, I decided that, when school started, I would wake up at four in the morning and get my lift in before having to go to school. There is something so surreal about working out when it is night. You feel oddly more focused and content, especially since the gym is so empty at that time. 

The morning that this story regards started like any other. My alarm woke me at four, and I promptly took a shower, deodorized, brushed my teeth, and drank about 32 oz of chocolate milk in order to stuff up on carbs before hitting a lift. I got in my car and drove the twenty minutes to my local gym. When arrived, I drank my nitric oxide and pre workout, and got ready to destroy back, which is my favorite muscle to train. I entered the gym and saw that, like every morning, it was completely empty except one other guy. 

He was the only other person who came to the gym this early in the morning, and he was absolutely huge. He could absolutely be a competitive bodybuilder if he chose to. His shoulders and chest were his strongpoints, both of which being absolutely gigantic and striated, though he did not necessarily have weak points. His lats were incredibly wide, his arms incredibly thick and veiny, and his legs were extremely dimensional and big. Even his calves were extremely plump. Needless to say, that was the physique I was working towards. 

He always wore a dark tank top and long pants that were usually the same color, black vans, and a backwards baseball cap. He also had an eternal buzz cut, which was the same length literally every time I saw him, as if he cut it every day. He was clean shaven, with a strangely dimensional face, as if he had removed every drop of fat from it and had somehow found exercise that size up the intricate muscles in your jaw. 

Of course, his strength matched his size. He would frequently move 405 on the incline smith machine bench for no less than 10 reps every chest day, and I could not count how many pull-ups he could do, despite him likely weighing more than three hundred and twenty pounds, all of which pure muscle of course. One morning, I managed to get a photo of him, which I later showed to my mom. She said that he looked “grotesque” and that she absolutely did not want me to be like that. 

I was not exactly a genetically gifted lifter, and had pondered taking steroids on many occasions. With this in mind, I genuinely wanted to ask him what stack he was doing so I would know what to take if I ever gave in to those urges, but decided not to. I know that the biggest guys in the gym are generally the nicest, but even then, I could not work up the courage to speak to him. It was not his huge muscle size that scared me, but his aforementioned face. It looked almost fake. I had never seem someone with that little facial fat and so much facial dimension. It looked like an alien was given an overly detailed description of the human face and molded it out of clay. I can’t really explain it, but he gave off the same vibe as a hornets nest, where the best course of action is just to be wary around it and mind your distance. 

Anyway, I warmed up and started my back day with pull-ups, which I did four sets of as many as possible. The first set I did I managed to get eleven, and the last set I got six. From there, with a nascent lat pump brewing, I did four sets of pulldowns, which felt way better after pull-ups than if I did them stand alone. From there I did T Bar Rows, which are my favorite back exercise as they really fold open the lats at the bottom and squeeze them really hard at the top. During the entire lift thus far, the big guy remained very distant from me, as he was going nuts on his biceps in the free weight area, and I was staying in the machine area. I eventually moved on to single arm plate loaded machine rows, and after I finished my first set there, I decided to look over at what the big guy was doing. 

He was doing seated dumbbell curls, grunting brutishly as he moved the ninety pound dumbbells. I watched his horrifically massive biceps striate as they stretched and their veins pop as they contracted. I was decently big, with a noticeable amount of muscle mass on my upper body compared the average boy my age, though I was never really that lean, so seeing those biceps be so huge yet so shredded really captivated me. I guess I spaced out while still looking in his direction, because after he finished his set and rested a couple minutes, he heaved his mass off of his bench and lumbered over toward me. His shadow falling over me was the thing that brought me back to reality. He was breathing like a pregnant woman in labour, taking several seconds to inhale and several more to exhale, his upper body muscles flexing and relaxing subconsciously as he did so. 

As I said earlier, he gave off a very unstable vibe, again, like a hornets nest, and I could feel this energy get more powerful as he approached and stood still in front if me. This vibe caused my heart to start beating faster and my stress to go gradually creep up. He was not doing anything but standing before me and breathing, but again, he just felt so dangerous. I could feel the skin on the back of my neck tingle and tighten as a violent wave of dread forced its way through me so hard that I shook a little. 

He stood their, silent and respirating heavily for an entire minute or so before I eventually conjured the courage to speak. I opened my mouth but my tongue and throat wouldn’t move, like the muscles in them were paralyzed. I remember that I had to put genuine effort into speaking. I had to mentally connect with the nerves in my lips and tongue in order to verbalize what I wanted to say. It was so strange. As when you talk, you just talk, simple as that, but in this moment I really had to think about how to modulate my larynx, lips, and tongue in order to speak to this man.

“Shit, I’m sorry if I was staring at you. I didn’t mean anything by it.”

The giant man cocked his head a little bit upward, his eyes shifting down to keep me in his vision. I remember seeing one of the veins on his left bicep inflate and deflate a little as he did so. It so alien. He breathed a few more great, laborious breaths before he spoke.

“Hey kid, do you want to know how I got so big?”

His voice was deep, but not strangely deep. He did not have an accent, which was strange, seeing as this was Western North Carolina, in which most people, including myself, have a slight draw to our speech. When he spoke, my almost inability to talk vanished, as if hearing his voice somewhat alleviated my brain’s subconscious perception of him as a threat. I thought about this question, and despite me still being very very wary of this man, I decided to reply with:

“Oh my God, Yes.”

His lips twitched upward into a smile for only a fraction of a second as he raised his right hand. He made a fist, leaving only his pinky finger up. He took another heavy breath, and all of the veins on his body started to inflate and deflate as his pinky slowly turned completely black. I was way less shocked at this sight than I should have been. I suppose I was just very immersed in the conversation.

“Now, I can make you even more of a monster than me, but I just need one thing from you.”

He said, his veins still inflating and deflating metronomically. I was so desperate to become a mass monster like him, I had genuinely spent hours online looking for illegal anabolic steroids. I was willing to do anything to have one of the greatest physiques of all time, even if, in the case of steroids, it meant a premature death. Needless to say, my curiosity was peaked, even though I remained very cautious of the man.

“What’s that?”

I asked curiously.

“Ten pints of your blood.”

He answered. I chuckled awkwardly. Beads of sweat began to form on my head.

“That’s funny.”

I said. He was clearly joking. What he said just sounded so unbelievable. It had to be some kind of gag. I was proven horrifically wrong as he grabbed my arm with his left hand. His grip was so strong I felt as if my bones might splinter. And then I felt it, every piece of soft tissue in my body shrinking as the blood was forcefully pulled out of them. I looked at my arms and could see the skin on them wrinkling and turning bright white as the muscle underneath them shrank rapidly like a leaking water balloon. I felt my mouth become excruciatingly dry and my heart slow down as it ran out of fluid to pump. When I inhaled in shock, it burned the inside of my throat and lungs, as my mucus membranes had dried up almost entirely. 

With this in mind, I couldn’t even scream in pain. I felt my cheeks go from being warm deposits of fat to essentially sheets of paper. I could feel my eyes dry out similar to my mouth, and in response I felt my tear ducts open, but nothing came out of them, and my eyes became so dry that the stationary air around me felt like fire. My vision became filled with white spots as I felt every single part of my body shrink and dry out. 

From what I still had of my eyesight, I saw that the giant man’s left arm, the one that he grabbed me with, was now bright red. I could see the numerous veins on his body had almost tripled in size and his muscles were now slowly expanding, becoming even larger than they already were. He was taking my blood. He was taking my blood through his hand and somehow it made his muscles and veins even bigger and more grotesque than they already were. And the entire time that this was happening, he was staring directly into my shriveling eyes. He didn’t say a word. He didn’t even breath.

After what felt like hours, but was in reality only a minute or so, he released the grip in his left hand. I was mummy at that point. Every drop of fluid in my body was gone, and yet I was still alive, somehow. It hurt so much to exist in that state. I felt like I was on fire, and I couldn’t move, and absolutely every single cell that made up my body was screeching in pain. I could still see somewhat my arms through my raisin like eyes. All of the skin, muscle, and fat on my body had shrank and shriveled and dehydrated so I was now like a skeleton sealed in paper. I could see each individual bone in my fingers, and I could see the empty gap between the two bones in my forearms.

The pain that I felt overwhelmed the fear that I had towards that giant man, who, using the blood he had somehow sapped from my body, had now obtained even more muscle tissue than he already had. He moaned, likely relishing in the feeling of his muscles and veins swelling underneath his skin, before he took his black right pinky and jabbed it into what was left of my right shoulder. 

Almost instantly, the tissue in my body swelled as it rehydrated back to normal. The burning pain stopped, and an unbelievable wave of absolute euphoria overtook me as the nightmare ended. Through my now normal and pristine vision, I could see that my skin had returned to its normal, rich color, and that the muscle underneath it had grown back to normal. Saliva filled my mouth, and I could finally breath without it feeling as if I was breathing in chlorine. But then I noticed something else. 

Though I had returned to normal and the existential pain had left, a knew pain overtook me. It was my skin. I hadn’t returned to my normal self. I was becoming something more than that. I looked at my arms and I could see why my skin was beginning to hurt. My muscles were inflating and growing rapidly, squirming and twitching as they did so. Every muscle on body was now slowly growing, and it felt like my skin was being ripped apart. Then I remembered what the man had said. He said that in exchange for my blood, he was going to make me even bigger than him. I had fulfilled my end of the deal, now he was fulfilling his. 

It did not hurt as much as being drained of blood, but it still was agonizing to feel my body growing at this rate. Veins began to bulge out of my rapidly inflating muscles as the skin stretched even further. It only took me three minutes for me to finish my transformation. I turned my head to look in the mirror, my gigantic traps flexing and cramping as I did. I was stunned. I was now just like that man. My skin was so thin that I could see each individual strip of muscle fiber. My muscles were so grotesquely huge it was hard to move. Veins the size of garden hoses were visible all over my entire body. I had become a monster, just like him.

My skin stopped hurting after a minute, and I couldn’t help but flex my biceps in the mirror as soon as it subsided. They were the size of soccer balls, and they doubled in size as I flexed them.

“Looking huge, big guy.”

The big man said as I examined what was now my body. I didn’t know what to think. I had my dream physique, but at what cost? It hurt so much when he took my blood from me. I immediately left out an incredible cry of absolute agony and ran out of the gym, the big man’s gaze following me the entire time. I fit my new, massive body into my car and began to sob. 

As I write this, I’m still sitting here in my car, in the parking lot of the gym that I once loved going to. The big man is still in there, and he has gone back to his workout, monotonously moving weight as if he had not just changed my life in such a horrific way. I’m putting this on this sub because I don’t know what to do? How do I explain what happened to my body to my parents; my friends? Please help me.
