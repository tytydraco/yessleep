**Part I - Amy**

I wish you could’ve known Amy before. She had the kindest eyes anyone could have, the softest skin to touch. The most beautiful smile.  
I... I really don’t know how to explain what happened.  
I just know I failed.

It all started a few years ago:

I woke up at 3 a.m. to a call from Amy. She was crying—sobbing. Another fight with her mom? Probably. They hadn’t spoken in over a month, but who knows.

“*I need your help*.”  
That’s all she said. And that was enough. It didn’t matter that I had a shift in four hours.

I washed up, grabbed my coat, and left. Her house was only ten minutes away, but it felt like an eternity. I was riddled with worry. When Amy called me like that, I always knew there was something wrong.

As soon as I got out of the car, I could hear her crying. "Oh no", I thought. This time it sounds serious.

“*Hey, Amy, it’s me, Dan! What happened?*”  
I knocked, and she appeared. She looked so fragile, yet hugged me with such strength I thought she’d never let go. But she did.

“*I need to show you something.*”  
She looked at me with tearful eyes and waited for a response.

*“Are you okay?”*  
I asked, and she just nodded.

*“Just… come with me.”*  
She took my hand and pulled me inside. I felt uneasy—especially after the last time I’d been there. Speaking of which, a question popped into my mind: where were her parents?

I didn’t get the chance to ask. She stopped in front of the bathroom door.

*“It’s… in here.”*  
She looked serious.

*“What? Is there something in your bathroom?”*  
I was already getting annoyed. If she called me at 3 a.m. because of a bug or something, I was going to be pissed. But that wasn’t it.  
She wasn’t scared. She was just different. Almost... hopeful?

*“It’s over!"* \- She shouted, her face bearing a blank look of disbelief. - *"I trapped it in here!”*  
Suddenly, a strange smile appeared on her face as she hugged me again.  
*"What the hell is going on?",* I thought.

*“Amy, is it a rat? I mean, I can handle a bug, but a rat is—”*  
*“It’s over, Dan! I found it!"* \- She interrupted, gleefully. - *"I trapped it forever! Now I can move on!*”  
Her smile widened, and she started crying again.

*“Move on from what? What do you mean, Ames?”*  
I was beyond confused. What had she done?

*“Don’t worry. Now we can be happy.”*  
She looked at me, eyes filled with the most genuine joy I'd ever seen.

*“Amy, I don’t understand. What’s in there? What did you do?”*  
She just hugged me again.

*“Let’s go to bed, love. You have work in like, six hours.”*  
She said it confidently—like nothing had happened over the past six months.

I tried to get answers all night. She just kept repeating:  
*“Just don’t open the door.”*  
*“It’s okay, I trapped him.”*  
*“He won’t come out unless I let him.”*  
*“Now we can be a normal couple. Everything’s fine!”*

Nothing seemed fine. After we went to bed, I was up for a while, my head spinning with theories.

Then, I felt Amy tug at my arm, her grip strong with despair. She was having a nightmare, thrashing from side to side, mumbling louder and louder. I touched her cheek and turned her face toward me. Her eyes were open.

Suddenly, she started screaming, almost crushing my upper arm:

*“DON’T OPEN THE DOOR! PLEASE! FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, DON’T OPEN IT! HE’LL KILL ME! I DON’T WANT TO DIE! I DON’T WANT TO BE ALONE!”*

I shook her, trying to wake her up, and she thrashed for a bit before going still. She stared at me until she broke the silence.

*“Just don’t open the door.”*  
Her eyes cut through me.

*“Okay, love, I won’t—”*  
*“Promise.”*  
She pressed my arm, gently.

*“Promise me, and we’ll be happy. Together.”*  
*“I… I promise.”*  
We went back to sleep.

With time, Amy got better. Happier. Happier than ever. Her parents stopped hurting her. She finally believed me when I told her she was beautiful.

Months flew by. We got engaged. Then, almost suddenly, married. I moved into her house, just to make sure the door stayed shut.  
Eventually, we kind of forgot about it all.

We enjoyed our early married life. Dates, friends, laughter. A happy, normal life.  
Sometimes I’d pass by the door. Always closed. Always locked.  
We were too happy to care.

But *it* hadn’t forgotten.

It started with a small red rot on the wood, right by the doorknob.  
I noticed it one morning after waking up. No idea how long it had been there.  
Amy hadn’t noticed, so I carefully removed the rotten wood, filled it with wood putty, and painted over it.

A few weeks later—it was back.  
I fixed it again.  
Next day, it returned.  
I fixed it again. And again.  
Each time I repaired it, it came back, exactly the same, for weeks.

I began waking up an hour earlier just to fix it before Amy noticed.  
See, Amy was a painter, so she usually woke up much later than me to work on commissions.

I got used to the routine. Had my own cabinet for tools and putty.  
When Amy asked about it, I called it my “Husband Cabinet.”  
She laughed and joke-bragged abou how she married a “strong, handy man.”  
If only she knew.  
But she couldn’t know. She’d panic. God knows what she'd do.

Things were fine the way they were. I was happy to help.  
And she was… she was happy.  
I adjusted to my new morning ritual.

Then the nightmares started.

Every other night, I dreamt that I forgot to fix the rot, or missed a crack.  
I started going to bed worried that this time, the dream was real.  
I’d wake up multiple times a night just to check the door.  
Each morning, I was more exhausted—and more afraid.  
Then I’d see Amy, sleeping so peacefully.  
“It’s worth it,” I’d think.

But soon it wasn’t just one rotten spot.  
Two, three more showed up—this time on the hinges.  
I started fixing those too. But they were getting bigger.  
I had to wake up even earlier just to fix them.

It got to be too much.  
Eventually, Amy caught me.

*“What are you doing?”*  
She appeared behind me one morning.

*“Oh, hey love! Umm… just fixing the door…”*  
I looked at her as panic crept over her face.

*“Why? What’s wrong with it? What are you doing?” -* She asked, starting to panic.  
*“Love, it’s okay!”* I hugged her. *“I’m fixing it, I always do, it's really no problem!”* I said—without thinking.  
Then I realized what I’d just confessed.

*“What do you mean always? What is going on? How long has this been happening?”*  
She looked scared. Really scared. Her eyes were locked on the door like a deer in headlights.  
She was in danger.  
I got serious and said:  
*“It’s been happening every day for the last few months. But it’s okay. I can fix it. I* ***do*** *fix it.”*

She kept staring.  
*“Then* ***we*** *need to fix it.”*  
She didn’t really speak to me for a whole week.

After that, she started waking up with me to watch me fix it.  
Then she started helping.  
Then, she started obsessing.

She checked the door hourly.  
Cleaned it. Tended to every crack.  
It became her only concern.  
She grew cold, tense. She could never relax.

She stopped going out, stopped seeing friends, stopped watching her TV shows.  
She painted facing the door, always watching.  
She abandoned everything else.

She eventually painted the door bright blue—so the cracks would show more clearly.

It became our secret habit.  
And it was about to get worse.

One night, I was leaving the other bathroom to go to bed when I heard it.  
A faint scratching noise—subtle enough to go unnoticed at first.  
But it was there.

The first time I ever heard anything *from the other side* of the Blue Door.

I backed away.  
I went to bed, resisting the urge to open it.  
I tried to sleep.

I woke up five times drenched in sweat.  
Each time, I heard the scratching again. Louder.

This went on for about a week.

The sounds started changing after that. Sometimes I'd hear things falling, people talking, calling me in. Other times someone would scream extremely loudly, then silence. All accompanied by that same scratching noise.  
Then, one night… the sounds stopped. All of them.

I looked around, then stood up.  
Through the bedroom door, I saw something I never expected:

The Blue Door was ajar.

I crept through the house, careful not to wake Amy.  
I approached the door. Somehow the rot had grown again, but this time it was everywhere. The whole door was filled with red veins of red rot, while the cracking noise grew louder and louder.  
I stopped walking when I heard a noise.

Someone was… crying?  
The sound came from inside.

The door was slightly open, but I couldn’t see anything.

I tried to hold back. I swear I did.  
I stood there, questioning every decision I’d made.

What if it was Amy? What if she went in? What if—  
I had no choice.

I entered, flashlight on.

It looked like a normal bathroom at first. Beige tiles, brown patterns.  
But as I turned to see more, everything changed.

Decay covered everything.  
Moss and black mold consumed the walls.  
The sink cabinet was rotting. The pipes leaked dark, rusty liquid and so did the faucet.  
A putrid stench filled the air and made me gag, my eyes watering with the foul odor.  
Then, I wiped my eyes and I could see again—I saw her.

*“Hi, love.”*  
My wife sat on the toilet. Her clothes torn and filthy.

She was hunched over, cradling a dark, bloody mass in her hands.  
She stared at it as blood dripped between her fingers.  
It was moving, turning on her skinny palms.

*“I should be happy, shouldn’t I?”* she whimpered.

Her body was in ruins.  
Bones showing under pale, dried skin.  
Her delicate hands now skeletal, soaked in blood.  
Her eyes—black, sunken, ringed in purple.  
My Amy… what the hell happened?

*“Amy, what… what is that?”* I asked, barely keeping calm.  
My heart pounded. My brain couldn’t process.

*“He has his father’s eyes, doesn’t he?”*  
She stared at the grotesque thing in her hands.

"Well, you know what they say about closed doors!" She looked at me with a crooked smile. The door slamed shut behind me.

Before I could react, Amy slowly tilted her head forward—  
And sank her rotting teeth into the bloody flesh.

Then, I woke up.
