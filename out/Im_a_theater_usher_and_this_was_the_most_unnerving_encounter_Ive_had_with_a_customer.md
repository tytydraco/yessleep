Hey Reddit, long time viewer first time caller. I’m writing to see if I’m crazy or not. No one at my job seems to believe me, but I know what I saw. 

I work at a movie theater as an usher. I spend all my shifts checking theaters for people being assholes, sweep floors, take out garbage. The usual stuff. Depending on the movie release, my days can be boring as shit with very little to do. Cast (yeah staff is referred to as cast…) and managers often spend the boring days just shooting the shit and trying to stay sane. Sometimes we like to tell spooky stories to the new kids to creep them out. One story we have is about how when the theater opened in 1991 a dude got shot in the lobby. It’s a simple one, but telling teenagers that someone got shot can spook them. Another is Theater 12. Two managers had to fix a ceiling light in Theater 12 and experienced something spooky. No physical entities, Hat Men, or bed sheets. The air in the theater was just… uneasy. One of them swore they heard talking but didn’t see anyone else. Being the little shit I like to be, I told one of the new kids a hodgepodge of the stories. I told them that a guy got shot on opening day in Theater 12 and his spirit haunts the theater to this day. Little fun to keep us sane. 

That’s what I thought.

The other night I was doing my normal closing routine. I was bum-rushing to clean the theaters. I made my way down to Theater 12, the theater hadn’t sold all day. It’s common. Some movies do diddly dick and don’t sell. So I went to clean (or pretend to clean because there’s nothing to clean). The second I entered the Theater the vibes felt off. The air just felt… wrong? Is that the correct word? It felt wrong. I turned the corner to the rows of seats to see one person sitting and staring at the screen. It was a woman, about maybe mid-30s? She was Asian, possibly Chinese. She just stared at the screen. Nothing was playing but she was engrossed like there was something there. I cleared my throat. 

“Ma’am? It’s closing time."   
  
The woman blinked, like I broke a trance or something. “Oh,” She said. “Sorry. I just couldn’t get over this movie. It’s so good.” Clown in a Cornfield was in that theater. I highly doubt that. It was the end of the night, I’m tired, and I want to clock out and go home. Being nasty to a woman in the wrong theater isn’t going to do anything.

“Well, sorry ma’am. Gotta go.” 

She politely got up, collected her things; purse, popcorn bucket, and cup. At least she had the common sense to do that at least. Her items were… weird. The bucket and cup looked like one of the older cups and buckets the GM has up in the projector booth. Hadn’t used those designs in years. Okay, so maybe she just likes vintage theater memorabilia? As said, it was the end of the night, I don’t care, and she’s hot. As long as she got the hell out. She handed me her ticket. “Here. I’ll save you a sweep. I didn’t eat much of my popcorn.” After that, She left. I tossed the ticket in my dust pan without thinking and went through and swept. She was right, not much of a popcorn enjoyer. Didn’t eat much at all. Easy clean. The can was empty too, must’ve taken her stuff home with her. I cleaned the rest of the theaters in that hallway and listened to random YouTube videos.

Afterwards I went back into the lobby, my closing manager was cleaning the rest of the concessions stand. “Everyone out?” He asked. 

“Yup.” I say. “Hey, are you sure Theater 12 didn’t sell today?” I asked.

Manager grabbed the closing sheet, looked over it, and handed it to me. “Yuh. Empty all day.” I scratch my head in confusion. “Why? Was someone in there?”

“Yeah, some lady. Didn’t see anyone leave that hallway?” 

“Just you, babygirl.”

I held up my dustpan, rifled through it, and pulled out her ticket. I examined it closely. The Silence of the Lambs. I showed it to my manager. “She gave me this to save me a clean.” We both examined it again. One thing stuck out. The date on the ticket. March 14th, 1991. We both stared at the ticket, then to each other, then down the hall to Theater 12. After that, I wouldn’t go in that theater without anyone else present; manager, co-workers, even customers. That theater really freaks me the fuck out now. No one believes me that I saw a ghost. My closing manager says I must've just found an old ticket under a seat.

But I know one thing for fucking sure… 

I refuse to be alone in Theater 12.
