Today is finally the day, I get the newest VR headset. 
This is supposed to be the best gaming experience in the world, and I'm going to use it! 

I used all the money I had saved to buy the headset, but I had forgotten about the most important part of it. 

**THE GAME**

The games for this headset cost atleast $35 , I have about...... $10.

Disappointed, I started walking back home. 
"I'll buy it next month" is what I thought before something caught my attention. 

It was a sign that said "games available for the newest headsets at low prices" pointing towards a dark alleyway. 
I went in there to find a store, It was a store full of games for different consoles, pc and headsets. 

I started looking around but all of them costed $15 or more. That's when I found one. 

"Shadow dungeons" I read it's name. It's cost was $6 . I bought it and went home. 

Ready to play the game, I set up the vr and put the game in. I put on the headset and it started "scanning body, scanning movements, link complete" and then I saw my character. It looked just like me! 

I clicked on the game and the character customization screen appeared. 

Name : Ragnarok
Class : Swordsman 
Ability : shockwave 

I created my character. There seemed to be different dungeons, I chose the first one called "Shadow tribe".

Monsters : shadow wolves, shadow tribe men, shadow apes

Boss : shadow chief

Drops : the sword of darkness, tribe robes 

It was time to choose my support characters. I chose the following 

Layla : Healing magic 

Jake : Reinforcement magic

Everything seems set, Let's go! 

I spawned in, It seemed I was in a jungle with a path engraved in it. My character was exactly copying my movement "This really is the best" I thought to myself. 

I clicked on "start dungeon"

The first monsters were shadow apes, some of them threw rocks at you while some punched you. 

"Let's get the rock throwers, they are annoying"
I broke through their lines and slashed up the apes. 
Then two apes jumped me but thanks to Jake's reinforcement magic, I dodged and slashed them. 

This kept going until I got them all, Then a loud voice said "You think you can get away by killing my men!"

"This really does seem like real"
I kept going 

Then I encountered some shadow wolves. They were fast and attacked in groups. I got some of them but then one bit my hand , Thanks to Layla's healing magic I survived. 

Finally it was the end of those wolves, when another voice said "Face us yourself Coward!". Seems like he didn't like my support units. 

I went on and finally found the shadow tribe men. They had weapons and actually planned their attacks unlike the ones before. I dodged their attacks but then one stabbed me with his spear and they all started stabbing me. 

"Falling short on manpower?" The voice said

That's when I used shockwave to knock them all back but something is weird..... An attack like this is supposed to knock them back not kill them. It seemed to me that something about this game is off. 

"You... stay in the other world behind a screen completely out of danger, while killing US! You will not be forgiven" The voice said

My blood ran cold, The voice knows that it's in a game and is capable to think like a human. Something is really really wrong with this game. 

Then the chief appeared in front of me, "I'll fight you myself" He said. Then we started fighting. 

His ability was to manipulate fire and spawn shadow tribe men. Dodging his attacks was hard already but the shadow tribe men made it impossible. Finally I used shockwave but........ The chief got knocked back as well. 

"Abilities like these aren't supposed to work on bosses, how is this happening?" I mumbled

The chief started laughing maniacally

"You fight us in the safety of your world, but what if we come in yours?" He said while raising his hand towards me. 

I quickly took off the headset but it was too late, A shadow tribe man was standing behind me. 

He threw a spear at me, I barely dodged it and made my way out of the house through the window. 

I ran and the tribe man just looked at me. I stayed with my friend Timmy that night , I told him about my experience but he said that I just need sleep. 

I went back home the next morning , nobody was there , just my VR headset. I hesitantly put it on. 

**The player has left the experience**
