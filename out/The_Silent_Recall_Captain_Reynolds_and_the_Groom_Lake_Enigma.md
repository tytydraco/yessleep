From the sworn testimony of Captain Julia Reynolds, given before the Congressional Oversight Committee on Unexplained Phenomena, regarding the incident at the Arctic Research Station, October 2023.

Q: Captain Reynolds, can you describe the nature of your assignment at the Arctic Research Station?

A: I was tasked with overseeing a multidisciplinary research team. Our primary focus was climate modeling and the study of glacial melt, but we were also there to investigate a series of anomalous signals picked up by satellites in the region.

Q: When did you first realize something was wrong?

A: About a week into our deployment, we started noticing strange interference on our equipment. It wasn’t just our radios—it was every piece of technology we had, down to our personal devices. At first, we thought it might be geomagnetic activity or a solar flare, but it quickly became apparent that this was something… different.

Q: Different how?

A: The signals weren’t random. They were patterned, almost like a language. We were picking up something that didn’t match any known communications or environmental data.

Q: What did you do next?

A: We attempted to isolate the signal, to understand its origin. We set up additional monitoring stations and began to triangulate its source. It took us to an uncharted region of the ice shelf, an area that had been previously inaccessible due to severe weather conditions.

Q: And what did you find there?

A: We found a structure, buried beneath the ice. It was massive, ancient. The technology it contained was unlike anything we’d ever seen. It was there that we encountered the artifact.

Q: Describe the artifact for the record.

A: It was a large, obelisk-like object, about thirty feet tall, composed of a material we couldn’t identify. It emitted a low, pulsating hum, and the patterns in the signal seemed to originate from it.

Q: What did you do with the artifact?

A: Against my better judgment, we brought it back to the station for further study. Our team was divided—some wanted to report it immediately to command, while others, driven by curiosity or ambition, insisted on analyzing it first.

Q: What happened next?

A: The closer we examined the artifact, the more things started to go wrong. People on the team began to experience vivid, almost hallucinatory dreams. Some reported hearing voices, seeing figures in the ice. Then, the incidents started—people disappearing, strange lights in the sky. The artifact… it was doing something to us.

Q: Did you attempt to destroy the artifact?

A: We tried. We attempted to cut power to the station, to isolate the artifact. But nothing worked. It was like the artifact had integrated itself into the very fabric of the station—and into us. It started showing us things, revealing knowledge that… wasn’t meant for us.

Q: What kind of knowledge?

A: It’s hard to explain. It was like the artifact was teaching us, communicating with us directly. It showed us images of the past, of civilizations long gone, and of things yet to come. It was knowledge that was both awe-inspiring and terrifying. But the cost… the cost was too high.

Q: Explain what you mean by ‘cost.’

A: People started losing their minds. The knowledge it imparted wasn’t something we were meant to understand. It was like giving a child the power of a god. Our minds weren’t equipped to handle it. Some of the team went mad, others… worse. They became something else, something not human.

Q: What do you mean, ‘not human’?

A: Their bodies changed. It’s hard to describe. It was like they were being remade, reformed by the artifact into something beyond human comprehension. We had to… we had to lock them away.

EVIDENCE LOG, CASE 330A

PIECE R-01

Security Footage from Arctic Research Station, Camera 5.

Recovered from the remains of the Arctic Research Station by Lieutenant James Harrow, badge #2547.

The footage is grainy, but what it shows is unmistakable. Captain Reynolds and her team are in the research lab, surrounding the artifact. There’s a low hum, and then the lights flicker. One of the researchers, Dr. Samuel Reyes, suddenly collapses, convulsing on the floor. His body begins to twist and contort in unnatural ways, his bones cracking audibly as his form changes. The other team members back away in horror, but the camera catches glimpses of Dr. Reyes’ transformation—a grotesque fusion of flesh and something else, something metallic, his eyes glowing with an eerie light.

End of Footage.

Q: Captain Reynolds, can you explain what happened after the footage ended?

A: I don’t think I can. Dr. Reyes wasn’t the only one. Whatever the artifact was, it was rewriting us, changing us into something that could understand it, something that could serve it. We lost three more members of the team before we realized we couldn’t stay.

Q: How did you escape?

A: We didn’t, not really. The station… it wasn’t a place you could just leave. It had become something else, a part of the artifact. The only reason I’m here now is because the station… released me. I don’t know why. I’ve been trying to figure it out ever since.

Q: Captain Reynolds, you were the only survivor of the incident. Do you have any idea why you were spared?

A: No. But I know the artifact is still out there. It’s waiting, watching. And I think… I think it’s learning from us.

Q: Do you believe the artifact poses a threat to humanity?

A: I believe it already has. We just don’t realize it yet. It’s not something we can fight or destroy. It’s a part of something bigger, something we can’t even begin to comprehend. And I’m afraid we’ve only scratched the surface of what it’s capable of.
