If you're reading this... know that Emma and I are alive.

That night was beyond anything I could’ve ever imagined. I was able to break free and grab Emma, but not without resistance. It fucked me up pretty good when I tried to jump toward her bed. When I lunged, reaching for Emma, it let go of her and threw its arm at me, whipping its thin, spindly fingers across my body like jellyfish tentacles. They scratched me deeply, but my adrenaline pulsed so hard that I barely felt it. 

I pushed through the onslaught and grabbed her. I ran out the door, holding her in my arms… not looking back. I could hear him pull himself out of the wall and give chase. I slammed the door to the hotel room and sprinted to my car, jumping in and speeding out of there.

We were out and on the road in less than five minutes, leaving that… thing… behind. We left everything else behind, except for this laptop and the clothes on our backs. I drove until the sun came up, never once looking behind me or even trying to think about it. The wounds I had sustained drenched my clothes in blood, which worried Emma. She cried for a while until I was able to stop by a dollar store and grab some medical supplies to clean myself up.

We drove for hours. I pushed myself until I physically couldn’t anymore before finally stopping.

I’m not saying where we are now. If you’re reading this, it means my plan worked. I've setup my computer to upload a cached version of this post that I left buried in an encrypted backup server that I used for work. It’ll ping once, upload this message, and then vanish, leaving no trace we were ever there in the first place.

My mind tells me that this was all in my head… that it was all just a really long, fucked up dream. But when I look into Emma’s eyes, I know that’s not true. I know what I saw and felt was real… and that’s almost too much for my mind to handle.

I no longer trust anyone or anything. I think that was its purpose. Perhaps it was meant to make me lose faith and isolate myself… and it succeeded.

Maybe I have gone crazy… maybe what I’ve been through pushed me over the edge…

I don’t know… All I can say is that I know now that I am the only one who can keep my daughter safe. The cops did nothing but send us somewhere that almost killed us. I don’t trust them…

I surely don’t trust the walls… hell, I barely trust this screen.

I pulled the rest of the money I had out of the bank and headed into the mountains… somewhere nobody will find us. There's no phones… No social media… Nothing. I can’t take the chance of that thing finding us again. Lucy’s father was weak. He allowed that thing to take control and lead him to do what he did. That won’t happen to me… I've made sure of it.

I paid cash for a cabin tucked in a gulch, surrounded by mountains and trees, and moved everything we had left into it. It’s hundreds of miles from anyone or anything. I've spent the last five days gutting it. I rebuilt every wall… no more studs and drywall. I made a trip to the hardware store and got everything I needed. I haven't slept... all I've done is work.

All the walls are now made of quarter-inch steel with handfuls of salt and scripture in every corner. I also researched some books on the occult and warding off demons and implemented some of the suggested remedies. I painted the floorboards in lines of black sand and iron filings.

I don’t let Emma near the walls... I keep her in the center of every room as much as I can. We have only been here for about a week, but she obeys the rules I have set. She doesn’t speak about what happened, but sometimes, late at night when I’m pretending to sleep, I hear her whispering.

“Three for the girl… four for the father…”

I’ve asked her about it, but she doesn’t remember. She doesn’t remember anything anymore… the wall… the hole… Mr. Long… none of it. Mostly, she just sits and stares at the wall.

Sometimes she draws… but not friendly monsters with googly eyes anymore. In her drawings, there’s always a tall, thin figure watching from the edge of the page. It doesn’t have a face or a mouth, and its arms extend like branches across the page toward a crude drawing of what I can only guess is herself.

He’s not done with us… I can feel it.

Yes, we escaped. I was able to get her out, but it cost me… and not just in a physical way. The days have blurred together. I don’t even remember what month it is anymore.

She hasn’t eaten much… and I don’t eat unless she does, which has been maybe three or four times since we left the hotel. Along with the rebuilt walls, I’ve boarded every door and bricked over every mirror. I’ve finally secured this place to my liking. Nothing is getting in or out of here now.

I still hear tapping behind the walls sometimes… something begging and pleading to come through.

He’s not gone… He’s just waiting for his chance. He has us exactly where he wants us.

Unsuspecting fathers, please take care of your daughters. Hug them tightly and never let them talk to strange imaginary friends. If you do, you’ll end up just like me… lost and broken… with a daughter who is scarred by trauma.

Remember to stay away from the walls… always! And if you hear a rhyme coming from your daughter’s room that you don’t recognize… especially if it includes Mr. Long… RUN and NEVER look back!

Mr. Long doesn’t forget… He lets you run and run like a rabbit trying to escape a hunter. He hungers for the chase… Feeding on your sanity and fear.

…

Rabbits... that's it... That's all we are...

…

Run little rabbit, as fast as you can, don’t look back…

…Don’t…Look…Back…
