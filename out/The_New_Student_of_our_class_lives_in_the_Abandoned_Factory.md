The 7th street of our city is located at the very bottom of the city. It's a jungle of small buildings, surrounded by houses, retails and small bazaars, it is an intersection with no extraordinarily large buildings. To describe it easily, It's a normal, quiet neighborhood, a peaceful residential area with no crime, but the people who live at this intersection are afraid to step out of their homes at night. It has been an unspoken tradition for the residents of this intersection to never leave their houses at night.   
  
And it is all because of an abandoned factory at the very bottom of our street.   
  
The factory itself creates a phenomenal sense of pressure on its inhabitants. In the day, it stands motionlessly as the background of every angle of the street, as if the factory was bound to our lives despite not a single one of us being workers or anything. Worst part is that this is just the feeling in the day, we sense a different emotion in the night.  
  
People who look at the factory at the night state that the factory doesn’t seem to be just standing in the night, but actually comes alive in the night with one purpose, to stare at us, stalk us and laugh down at us, as if the factory was an sentient being laughing at how pathetic humanity is compared to the size. During the day we feel pressured, but at night we feel completely powerless.  
  
People then started saying that the factory actually speaks to them, there are actually some brave people who actually went at the steel doors of the factory at night as a test of their courage, and they say they can hear the voice of the factory, an unpleasant voice of laughter, an sinister, sadistic laughter.  
  
The factory has been the center of a lot of strange stories, but there is one thing that we all know that is true, and it is about the reason why the factory had been abandoned, the owner.   
  
To say that the mysterious owner of the factory is one of the vilest men to ever set foot in America wouldn’t be an overstatement. Practicing child labor and hiring ruffians as the guards of the factory, the nameless owner and his thuggish minions had tortured, abused and outright murdered countless factory workers, men and women, children and elders, and controlled the factory with an iron fist for decades. A lot of people died and disappeared in that factory. The reason why the factory had stopped working was when one of the workers had the factory fence blown up, and every laborer and slave of the factory took this as an opportunity to run.   
  
It wasn’t a happy ending to say the least, the factory owner had never been heard from again, and it is likely that he had escaped the hands of the authority figures before they came to apprehend him for his tyranny. The cops secured the area for investigation, and that was when they discovered a mass grave of at least 1000 bodies in the middle of the factory with one tombstone with a carving: Work is honor, dishonor is death.  
  
The police have left the factory abandoned, and the factory remains as one purpose these days, a place to tribute the fallen who have suffered and perished by the hands of that nameless monster. It was a controversial decision however, since there were some people that were wondering if they should leave an extremely vile piece of history in the streets where people live. But that controversy did not last long.  
  
Still, the factory is not seen with goodness of any kind, if anything, the factory is the most loathed place in the entire city. The history, the atmosphere, everything about that factory can just be described as plain 'evil’, as I described, it feels like the factory is watching us, and with such vile history behind the origins of the factory, its presence feels more evil as time goes on.  
  
Not only that, for the past few weeks, people have seemingly reported people from their residential area who visited the factory to disappear without a trace. As if they never existed in the first place.  
  
My school is located on the same street where that damn factory is, the bus that leads to the school stops at the station right in front of the factory. So it is common for me to pass the factory every day to go to school and back.  
  
That day wasn’t a usual day, our class encountered a new student, a guy by the name of Kevin Smith, entered the class without any explanation. He sat right next to my desk, which was usually occupied by a guy named John, but he was sick that day, so it was no brainer for Kevin, and eventually, we started talking to each other.  
  
Something was off about Kevin however, despite him being at least in 5th grade like me, his English was somewhat worse than a preschooler. He could speak English, but he lacked grammar knowledge when he and I were writing for an assignment.  
  
In fact, it looked as if he had no idea what English even is, he referred to our language as ‘language’, and he stated that he had never heard the term ‘english’ before. He knew the term ‘American’ so he always believed that the language we are speaking is ‘Language’ or whatever.   
  
After a few hours of talking with him, I immediately knew that this guy was something off… To say this guy was stupid would be a lie, but he was very Incompetent.   
  
He didn’t know basic math, or spell words like ‘bee’ and ‘apple’, heck, even though he knew his name was ‘Kevin’, he had no idea how to spell his name, he always wrote as ‘Cabin’ and me writing the right spelling was a revolution to his life. I don’t want to mock this guy, but this guy was really…. Off.   
  
Lucky for him, he had me, and I was one of the few students in the entire school to be called ‘brainiac’ due to my magnificent intelligence. I dragged Kevin down the library at lunch and started to teach him basic knowledge and for some reason, he was willing to follow the things I am saying, despite me just being a mere student like him. That session, I taught him basic addition and subtraction, and later taught him how to spell other people’s names since he was spelling my name: “Nathan” As “Naysan”.  
  
After the break, he sat somewhere else and I ignored him for that session. When hometime came, I was walking home, and that’s when I saw Kevin in the streets doing something weird. He was going through a small hole that had been carved in a brick wall that had a place surrounded in fog, Because of the fog, I decided to stop following him and headed to the apartments to my house.  
  
Once I reached the hill which the apartment was at, I turned around and saw what was behind the fog. It was the factory, for some reason, the fog made the factory look way sinister than anything in this town. Eerie, demonic, creepy, every words that describe something bad could describe how I felt about seeing the factory that day.  
  
I was also Impressed how Kevin was able to go through the factory despite the notorious presence. I was thinking like that.  
  
Then I looked at one of the pillars to see Kevin walking across a bridge, leading to a pillar with a door in it. When he stopped there, I saw no movement or anything, until the door opened and Kevin entered.  
  
I was wondering If I saw something wrong, never in my life, heard someone open any door in the labyrinth of the factory, it is commonly known by other that every door of the factory is broken and it is impossible to open any doors. Instead, I have witnessed what could be a revolution just like how Kevin witnessed the real spelling of his name as a revolution.   
  
He entered a room, the door was open. And it was not like he knew how to open the door, someone from the inside of that room had opened the door for him, it can’t be… That is his home? Is that factory where he lives? So the people inside that strange tower are what, his family?  
  
  
I couldn’t stop looking at the factory after seeing what I had seen. If my thoughts are not as complicated as it seems, what i have seen just proves one thing, that there is someone living in the abandoned factory.  
  
At home, I just couldn’t keep my eyes off the window to see the factory. Back then, I would try my best to look away from the Factory when I sit near the window so I don’t see that ruin as a scenery, but today, I discovered that something else is in the factory that I do not know how to react, a human life.  
  
Besides, even if we are not talking about that particular factory, it was weird for someone to live in an abandoned place.   
  
I Was probably overthinking, but just looking at life in that factory was the reason why I started to overthink, who was the man that opened the door for Kevin? He was too old to be considered a friend and this was not some meeting between friends, and secondly, how did they even manage to open the door in a factory that is known as the place where no doors are open to the public.  
  
Suddenly, I saw at the same tower that somebody opened the door. It was Kevin that was coming out of the factory, and he was holding something in his hand, something that looked like a fish. Another boy, who seemed younger than Kevin, came out and were also eating something fish-looking,   
  
I Quietly inspected the scene and saw the same old man that opened the door for Kevin to enter, come out with a bag of something, he released the bag on the bridge to the ground, where multiple fish pieces were falling into the ground. After that, the man walked away as birds approached their appetite that fell to the ground, the three men then walked into the room and closed the door shut.   
  
I Slowly walked away from the window and moved to the other side of the house to see if I could see what fell down. Unfortunately, There wasn't any way to see what had fallen to the ground from my house. I walked out of my house and reached the factory gates, there was no sign of any meat from the point of view from here.   
  
I then walked back to where I saw Kevin enter the factory through the iron fence gate that had a hole in it. Come to think of it now, it looked as if the hole was man-made, not made by an explosion nor the rust of the metal, but it looked as if it was cut with utilities, the thing I am thinking of was fence cutters that are used in movies when people cut down a part of the fence in order to make a hole to escape,  
  
I slowly entered the hole and for the first time in My life, I saw the factory from the inside. The gigantic monstrosity of a building mixed with the feeling of uneasiness have filled me with unshakeable fear. Might be funny, but just looking at the factory made me fear for my life. The atmosphere and scent of death and disease was sprawled, sprayed. It felt as If I was legitimately walking through a mass grave.  
  
I soon found myself in the middle of the factory, the rusty building and chains were shaking in the wind, and there I saw what I believed to be a message from the heavens for me to run away.  
  
A decaying corpse was lying in the middle of the factory, its face was skeleton, and he had no arms or legs, instead, a skeleton of what looked like chicken wings with skin intact were placed across the corpse. It looked as if somebody had eaten the body, and it was eaten recently.   
  
I then sensed a bigger dreadfulness on what this could possibly mean, what this factory's true horrors were, it was not the past, it was not about the atmosphere, but the people that are probably living in this place.   
  
I looked around the area where I had found the corpse, and realized that a lot of the buildings that were supposedly locked had open doors, some even without one. I was possessed by dreadfulness and curiosity, and moved my footsteps into one of the buildings. On the ground of a wooden ledge was a small sign that has the words ‘S, H, O, L.’   
  
‘School’ was the first word I thought. It wasn’t a farfetched one. What I saw inside the house was a small blackboard, like the ones you find in the vintage schools. Since there were child laborers in the factory, it was possible that the factory owner had established an educational area for kids to learn while they are working in the factory, that is a logical explanation.  
  
In context, we know why a school has been built in this factory. The Owner of the factory had an ambitious plan to establish a civilisation restricted in his factory, he would prohibit his workers from leaving the factory and would create a small educational area to teach child workers instead of letting them go to school.   
  
Well what I find disturbing about the ‘school' part of the factory is the contents that are taught in the factory. A small drawing of human anatomy was scribbled in the middle of the blackboard with lines being drawn on the middle of the neck, it almost looked as this anatomy was basically depicting a way to decapitate someone. This got me to thinking about what this place could actually be, and by fixing the historical facts on this place, I could come up to one conclusion: A school dedicated for the psychopathic supervisors, learning how to kill the ‘ungrateful’ workers, probably.   
  
As I subconsciously walked into the room, I heard a small crack under my foot. I looked down and saw that I had accidentally stepped on something. The missing arm skull of the dead skeleton lying in the middle of the factory grounds, such were bad omens, bad omens indeed.  
  
Disgusted, I walked out of the abandoned school and went back to the outside of the factory, the sun was half hidden in the pillar where Kevin entered, and I was sure that Kevin was still in that mysterious room with the people. I slowly moved my feet aimlessly, hoping that I would walk back to the hole and get out. Due to the sunlight, I could barely walk straight. Still, I walked the general direction of where the hole is located until I could open my eyes.  
  
When I did open my eyes, I realized I was not at the fence where the hole is at, instead, I was right inside the main factory. I could tell that I was in the factory because a tombstone-shaped rock with the letters ‘W, D, H’ was found in the middle of the factory’s production line. It was the place of honor, dishonor and death, the main reason why the factory had gotten notoriety, as we all knew that 1000s were killed by the honorless monster and there were where multiple remains were found.  
  
There is now a giant hole surrounding the abandoned propaganda sign, after all, the police have taken every skeleton that have been found in the mass grave, but the problem is that even though it has been 10 years since every skeleton have been removed from the factory, the mix and matching of the skeleton’s owners were still ongoing. The nameless monster, that way, was still giving us a pain in the ass.  
  
I kicked down the ‘motivational propaganda’ onto the hole and decided to walk out of the factory since the sun was not shining in the direction of the hole.  
  
That was until I heard a voice, someone asking “who’s there? Is it you, dad? Have we got more meat?”   
  
It made my blood freeze, that voice belonged to Kevin, No doubt, Kevin was in that hole doing something. Without even thinking about the next scenarios, I jumped into the hole and landed on a soft pile of sand… With arms sticking around.  
  
Kevin was watching as I landed on the hole, on his right arm. He had a severed arm with teeth marks which he seemingly bit from, and on his mouth was blood of the victim, the victim that he seemingly butchered, and definitely had eaten.   
  
We both looked at each other for half a minute in silence, and then we both knew what was going on, the person that we were looking at were planning to kill the other person. I immediately grabbed a rock that was luckily underneath my feet, and Bashed onto Kevin’s head, Kevin dropped the cleaver and was crawling.   
  
I didn’t know what I was doing, other than my survival instinct controlling me, I had zero Idea on what was happening right now. When I finally reached my senses, I was looking at a pile of people who had been eaten by Kevin and his family, and the body of a teen was lying, half of his face was ripped, and the body had no pulse.   
  
I couldn’t believe anything, what I witnessed, what I had done, anything. I could only know the fact that I witnessed something gruesome, and I may have taken too far to calm down my fear, as the thing that had been causing my sudden wave of fear stopped its hideous actions and calm downed, and died.  
  
I didn’t know what I was doing, so instead of trying to scream for help, I decided to bury the body of the fool in the ground, the soil which had covered Kevin’s former victims were now covering their killer, and When I looked out to see the coast was clear, I took this as an opportunity to flee the factory.   
  
When I walked out, I realized that things were going to go out of hand, tens of people were surrounding the factory, waiting for the killer of one of them, me, to appear. A man with a pig mask, who looked like the leader, had a cleaver on his right hand, showing the fate that I will suffer if I get caught.  
  
Without hesitation, I charged at the man and ran past him, barely missing the killing blow. I could hear nothing, only footsteps of the people that were going after me, it looked as if this was the first time in a while where they saw a young man who were fit and healthy, which was a good food source.  
  
I just kept running, Running until I reached the hole where I came into, and then I barely escaped a blade that were ready to cut my foot, and then I turned around to give the cannibals a middle finger, showing that I have no intent to return to the factory, and to insult them as I have killed one of them.  
  
As soon as I reached my house, the fear that i have been hiding for a while had suddenly captured me, I was started to fear about the possibilities that those cannibals can do, and since I have murdered one of them, it is safe to say that I am their next target, and they might do anything, probably even come out of their lair to get me killed.  
  
I suppose I will be staying home for the next few weeks.
