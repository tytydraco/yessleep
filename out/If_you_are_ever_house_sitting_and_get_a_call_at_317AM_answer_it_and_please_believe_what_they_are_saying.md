I was standing in the basement when headlights swept across the small window near the ceiling. My phone's flashlight was still illuminating the wall of shelves. The wallets. The jewelry. The driver's licenses of eight women who never made it out of this house.

The front door opened above me.

"Check the basement first. If she found the bolt cutters—"

Claire's voice. Cold. Nothing like the woman from the gym.

I looked around frantically. There was a window, small, near the ceiling. I didn't know if I could fit through it.

I didn't have a choice.

It didn’t start like this.

I met Claire at my local gym a few months back. She was struggling on a machine and I helped her out. We struck up a conversation and ended up chatting to each other whenever we were both working out. That was the start of a relationship I would really come to regret.



Last week she approached me when I was in the middle of a HIIT workout. I didn’t hear her at first because of the music blaring through my headphones but she eventually tapped me on the shoulder. She told me her husband had planned a surprise vacation for their anniversary and that they needed someone to house sit for them for two weeks.



I hesitated at first. I didn’t really know her that well, I wouldn’t class her as a friend just a casual acquaintance. But, when she told me they’d pay me five hundred dollars for staying there, I couldn’t refuse. You see I’m kind of in between jobs right now and my savings are dwindling by the day. They only lived a couple of streets over from me so I thought what the hell why not. It’s easy money.



Around a week later I headed over to Claire’s house. I was greeted warmly by them both. They made me tea and we chatted for a while. Then Claire said they’d bought me my favourite pie from the bakery around the corner. That was the first thing that set me a little on edge. I didn’t ever remember mentioning that to Claire. But, I brushed it off, maybe I'd mentioned it in passing and just forgot about it. 



After we’d exchanged pleasantries they took me for a tour of the house. Everything seemed pretty normal. They told me their cat needs feeding twice a day. Once at 7AM and once at 7PM. Easy enough for me, at least the cat would give me some company. We walked past the basement. It had a large padlock and chain on it. They didn’t say anything which I thought was strange but I guessed I wouldn’t need to go down there. 



They then took me upstairs and showed me the main bedroom which I would be sleeping it. It looked comfy enough, there were a few family photos and some artwork which made it more homely. The second bedroom was more of the same and they let me know I could sleep in whichever room I felt more comfortable in. The second thing that creeped me out was the third bedroom. It had a lock on it. They told me to not go into the room under any circumstances. They used the excuse that it was a storage room and they were embarrassed by it but the way they both acted made me think otherwise.



They left shortly afterwards and I settled into my home for the next two weeks. The first night was pretty normal. I fed the cat as instructed and just relaxed and watched a movie with a bottle of wine. The cat was friendly but sometimes she’d just stop right in front of the basement door and stare at it, like she could see through it. That definitely creeped me out. But, If you’ve ever owned a cat I’m sure you know they do lots of weird and wonderful things. It was when she started hissing that freaked me out even more. I went and inspected closer and the basement door looked exactly the same, still locked up, so I just went back to watching the movie.



It was the second day when I really started to feel that something was wrong. I went outside to smoke but my lighter was empty. I decided to have a look in the kitchen to see if they had one lying around. I searched a couple of drawers and didn’t find anything. I noticed in the living room the coffee table had a drawer. I opened it up and searched around but nothing again. Just as I was about to close the drawer, out of the corner of my eye, I spotted a key ring with an ‘M’ and a blue key. My heart dropped. I picked up the key ring to inspect it closer. It was my keys, the ones I lost or at least thought I lost. My head went searching for answers. Maybe they had found them recently and were going to give them back to me. Maybe they didn’t know they were mine. But, it just seemed too much of a coincidence.



That night I lay awake tossing and turning for hours. I finally drifted off to sleep after what felt like an eternity. A sound woke me up. It took me a second to realise what it was.



My phone was ringing. 



I picked it up, the light was harsh against the darkness of the room, I squinted my eyes and looked at the time.



3:17AM



I jolted up. An unknown number. Who the hell could be calling me at this time. I hesitated for a second before answering. I decided to be brave.



“Hello?”



A woman answered back “The locked room. The key is under the sink. Unlock it before it’s too late.” The line went dead. I sat there for a moment staring at my phone. Who was that? How do they know about the locked door? I could feel a shiver running down my spine. How did they get my number? 



I didn’t know what to do. I was too afraid to get up. Maybe it was someone trying to trick me into leaving the bedroom. I stayed frozen for a long while before I built up the courage to move. I crept towards the door, put my ear against it and held my breath. I listened out but didn’t hear any movement. I opened the door and darted over to the bathroom. I slammed the door behind me. I reached for the light switch and turned it on. That gave me a sense of safety. The sink stood right at the back of the bathroom. It stared at me, daring me to look. I hesitantly moved towards it and ran my hand underneath. 



A key.



It didn’t make any sense. Was this Claire messing with me? I pulled the tape off and grabbed the key before making my way to the locked bedroom door. I slotted the key into the door and turned it. The click of the door opening made my stomach turn. I opened the door slowly. As the room was revealed droplets of sweat formed on my forehead. There was a corkboard on the wall. In the centre was a picture.



Me.



I stepped closer. It was my whole life. My routines, my favourite foods, where I shopped, where I lived. I looked to the right and there was a computer monitor sitting on the desk. My legs felt like jelly, I struggled over to the chair gripping the desk to keep myself upright. I sat down and turned it on. CCTV cameras flooded the screen. Every room in the house. I was being watched wherever I went.



I stared at the screen in disbelief. There I was, sitting in the chair, looking at myself looking at myself. A horrible feedback loop. My eyes darted across the different camera feeds. The bedroom I had been sleeping in. The bathroom. The kitchen. The living room. Every single room.

Then it hit me.

If I can see myself right now, they can too.

I jumped up from the chair and started pulling open drawers, looking for something, anything that would explain what was happening. But there was nothing. Just cables and batteries and USB sticks that I was too afraid to plug in.

My phone rang.

I looked at the screen.

3:17AM.

I stared at it. That couldn't be right. I'd been awake for at least twenty minutes. I'd searched the bathroom, unlocked the door, found the cameras. There was no way it was still 3:17.

I blinked and looked again.

3:17AM.

The number was unknown. The same one as before. I answered, my voice barely a whisper.

"The basement. That's where they keep the evidence. Bolt cutters are in the garage, top shelf behind the paint cans. You need to see what's down there. Then you need to run."

"Who are you?" I asked. "How do you know all this?"

"There isn't time. They know you're awake. They're already driving back."

The line went dead.

I looked at my phone again.

3:18AM.

Time had started moving again.

I didn't let myself think. If I thought about it, I'd freeze. I moved downstairs as quietly as I could and slipped into the garage through the side door in the kitchen. I found the bolt cutters exactly where she said they'd be. They were heavier than I expected.

The basement door loomed in front of me. The chain and padlock looked even more menacing in the dark. I positioned the bolt cutters and squeezed. It took three attempts before the chain clattered to the floor. The sound echoed through the silent house. I froze, listening. Nothing.

I opened the door. A wooden staircase led down into the darkness. I used my phone's flashlight and descended slowly, each step creaking under my weight.

The smell hit me first. Damp and something else underneath it. Something I didn't want to identify.

The basement was larger than I expected. Concrete floor. Shelves lining the walls. I swept my flashlight across them and my stomach lurched.

Personal effects. Jewelry. Wallets. A pair of glasses. A watch. A phone with a cracked screen. A university lanyard with a photo ID. The woman in the photo was smiling.

I counted the items. Eight wallets. Eight driver's licenses. Eight women who had come to house-sit and never left.

On a workbench in the corner I found a journal. The cover was worn, the pages wrinkled like they'd gotten wet at some point. I opened it to the first page.

*My name is Caitlin Marsh. I'm house-sitting for two weeks. Easy money.*

I flipped forward. The handwriting got shakier as the entries progressed.

*Something's wrong. Found some of my stuff in their drawers. Stuff I thought I lost months ago.*

*There's a room they told me not to go in. I found the key.*

*Oh god. Oh god. There are cameras everywhere. They've been watching me. There are folders with other women's names.*

*I found the basement. I know what they do.*

The final entry was barely legible, the pen pressed so hard it had almost torn through the paper.

*They came home early. I can hear them upstairs. If anyone finds this, please. Tell my mom I love her. Tell her I'm sorry I didn't call more.*

Nothing after that.

I closed the journal. My hands were shaking so badly I nearly dropped it.

Headlights swept across the small basement window.

No. Not yet. I wasn't ready.

I heard the front door open. Footsteps above me. Claire's voice, sharp and cold, nothing like the woman from the gym.

"Check the basement first. If she found the bolt cutters—"

I looked around frantically. There was a window, small, near the ceiling. I didn't know if I could fit through it. I didn't have a choice.

I shoved the journal in my jacket and climbed onto the workbench, knocking over a jar that shattered on the concrete floor.

"She's down there!" Claire's husband shouted.

I punched out the window with the bolt cutters, glass raining down on me. I hauled myself up, the frame cutting into my stomach, my legs kicking against the wall. I heard footsteps thundering down the basement stairs.

I squeezed through and fell onto the grass outside, gasping. I scrambled to my feet and ran.

I didn't look back. I didn't stop. I ran until my lungs burned and my legs screamed at me to stop. I ran until I saw the lights of the gas station on the main road. I burst through the doors and collapsed against the counter.

"Call 911," I gasped. "Please. Call 911."

The police found everything. The room. The cameras. The basement. The personal effects of eight missing women, cases that had gone cold years ago. Claire and her husband were arrested that same night. I gave my statement so many times I could recite it in my sleep.

Caitlin Marsh had been missing for three years. Her mother cried when they told her they'd found the journal. She asked to meet me. I couldn't do it. Not yet. Maybe not ever.

I'm back home now. New locks. Security cameras of my own. I still don't sleep much.

Last night my phone rang. I already knew what time it would be before I looked.

3:17AM.

I answered.

"You made it out." The voice was clearer now. Stronger. Almost proud.

"Caitlin," I said.

"There are others like them. When I find them, I'll call."

The line went dead.

I looked at my phone. A new contact had appeared that I didn't add.

Caitlin.

So if you ever get a call at 3:17AM from an unknown number, please answer it. It might just save your life.

It saved mine.
