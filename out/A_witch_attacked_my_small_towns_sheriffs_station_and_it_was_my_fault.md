My Environmental Group was responsible for a fire that caused the deaths of ten people. Five of which were other members.

We called ourselves GAIA and had hopes for a better world. 

We planned the attack for two months. ‘*Venker Watts* *Lumber’* was the target. They moved into the area, scooping up thousands of acres of wooded land for disposal over five years. Including Old Growth that’d been “re-zoned.”

It should have been a money machine. 

Only… it had strange shutdowns in the early days. Then there was the high turnover among the staff. Targets weren’t met. Deadlines fell behind. Accidents happened. 

Looking back, we could have let it collapse in on itself without lifting a finger. 

But then there was Bennie, one of the leads on the job with an even darker edge than the rest of us.

Bennie decided we should attack then and there. Make sure no one came back. 

I’ve been a part of different groups and participated in runs on meat-packing plants, torched lumber yards and a few obnoxious ski resorts. 

None ever resulted in loss of life or even injury. They were all well-planned and executed by senior members who’d aged like vinegar. 

Venker Watts was supposed to be the same. 

We pulled together a six person team for the night run. We carried heavy accelerants and C4 with detonators. We dressed like shadows. 

There was a single road that led into the Venker Watts property. Every other direction was dense forest, except for where they were cutting. So we moved parallel to the road, but thirty feet into the trees. 

Once we got to the property, we hit the first fence. We cut through it easily. 

But the second fence was electrified with horizontal wires, so we used a modified, rubber-trim scissor-jack that cranked up to three feet, which gave enough room to climb through. 

From there, we followed the fence along the perimeter of the property and got to the back loading docks.  

We broke in. We set the charges in opposite ends of the facility and covered every surface in accelerant. 

We got out and engaged the detonators. 

We watched the fire explode outward from the facility, spreading faster than we’d anticipated. 

The chemicals inside the building—whatever they were—caught and sent flames roaring into the tree-line. The fire spiralled out of control.

We ran. 

Sully shouted something about knowing a way out, but Bennie didn’t give him a chance to take charge. He led us further into the woods, away from the road and deeper into the heart of the forest.

At first, we just focused on moving. 

The fire was spreading, and the roaring behind us urged us forward. But the deeper we went, the more the woods seemed to close in. The trees weren’t just trees anymore—they seemed... alive. Watching us.

The air grew thicker, heavier, like the forest itself was bearing down on us.

Each breath felt like pulling through wet sand.

Sully stumbled, his foot catching on a root, but when he tried to stand, his leg seemed stuck. He yanked at his boot, gritting his teeth, but the mud wouldn’t let go.

“The ground’s pulling at me!” he shouted, his voice ragged with panic. I rushed over to help, but as I grabbed his arm and pulled him free, I felt it too—the earth wasn’t just wet. It was *clinging* to us, like hands trying to drag us down.

The others saw it too. The dry ground that once cracked under our feet was now a swamp, sucking us deeper with every step. It didn’t make sense. There’d been no rain for weeks, but here we were, sinking into mud that seemed to swallow our boots whole.

Bennie snapped at us to keep moving, but even he seemed rattled. His usual swagger was replaced with clipped words and quick glances over his shoulder, as if he was afraid to look too long at anything.

But we had no other option, so we kept moving, the fire chasing us from behind, the forest smothering us from the front.

That’s when it started to happen. The woods themselves seemed to twist, subtly at first—branches shifting direction as if bending toward us, roots tangling our feet, slowing our escape. 

But it wasn’t just the trees. The air felt wrong too. Thick. Suffocating. Every breath felt like a weight pressing down on my lungs, making it harder to think.

Sully was the first to break. He collapsed to his knees, his breathing erratic, and grabbed the sides of his head.

Theresa knelt beside him, and tried to get him up. 

But Sully’s gaze was now locked on something far ahead, deep in the forest. 

I felt a cold rush. The trees seemed to close in tighter, the branches reaching in. 

My head pounded, the pressure in the air was unbearable. I opened my mouth to say something, but the words wouldn’t come.

Theresa turned back to me, her face pale, eyes wide. “Do you hear that?”

I nodded. It wasn’t just the wind anymore. There was a low hum, a vibration that seemed to pulse through the ground beneath our feet. A sound that echoed deep in my bones.

And then we saw it.

My skin prickled, my blood ran cold, and for a split second, my heart seemed to stop.

No one moved. We all stood there, transfixed by what we were staring at. Our bodies refused to move forward.

*It was something watching us.* 

Eyes glowing yellow from the darkness, a figure, made up of moss and vines and sludge and earth, barely visible through it all.

I couldn’t breathe. My legs locked beneath me.

But a burning, falling tree collapsed beside us and snapped me out of it. 

We ran, leaving Sully behind. But I kept thinking about those glowing eyes, the figure lurking in the shadows. 

The further we ran from the entity, the easier it became to move, the air thinning just enough to let us breathe. 

We cut left, away from the fire, finally reaching the main road.

We made it back to the car just in time. The fire was raging and it chased us down the country road, every curve and corner. 

As we finally got a straightaway and put more distance between us and the fire, I looked back and could’ve sworn I saw those glowing eyes staring out at us. 

We made it back to a pill house we used as a safe house and planned to stay for a few days. 

The house reeked of stale cigarettes, damp wood, and a bitter chemical stench. But it had a generator and enough food and water to survive. We had no choice.

We scattered throughout the house. Bennie barked out orders, though his voice trembled at the edges.

He claimed the living room, his back to the wall and facing the door, always watching, waiting for whatever might enter.

Theresa and Eddie took the ground floor bedroom. I found my way to the attic—a small space with slanted walls, a single window covered in grime, and a trapdoor leading down to the main hallway.

As I sat on the creaky floor, the events of the night washed over me in waves of nausea. 

My heart hadn’t stopped racing since the woods, and I could still hear Sully’s voice. His panic. The way he’d looked right before we left him, crumpled on the ground, mumbling about it. 

*We left Sully…* I thought. *We left him out there to die.*

I tried to shake the guilt. Bennie’s voice echoed in my head—*We had no choice.* But that didn’t change the fact that we’d abandoned him. 

The house was silent now, save for the occasional creak of the wind pushing against its decaying structure.

I lay back on the floorboards, trying to calm my breathing, the cold seeping up through the wood, into my bones. Exhaustion tugged at me, and for a brief moment, I thought sleep might actually come.

Then, a scream pierced the air.

It wasn’t loud, but it was sharp—like someone being cut open. 

My eyes snapped wide, my heart pounded in my chest. At first, I shrugged it off as maybe someone downstairs watching a movie or something.

Then it came again. Louder. More urgent.

It wasn’t a movie.

I sat up quickly, every hair on my body standing on end. For a moment, I considered staying in the attic.

Whatever was happening down there, I didn’t want to be a part of it. But something inside me—maybe guilt, maybe fear—forced me to move. 

I crept over to the trapdoor and slowly pulled it open.

The hallway below was dark. Quiet.

I crept down the rickety steps, every creak of the wood beneath my feet magnified in the silence. I reached the bottom and stood in the hallway, taking everything in. 

There was a new noise. It was movement this time. Shuffling. Groaning. Whimpering.

It came from the lower levels. I made my way down the stairs, onto the first floor and finding light…

It came from the basement door. A faint glow, flickering. That was where the sounds were coming from. 

I moved to the basement door and stepped forward onto the first step.

The wooden stairs leading down creaked ominously as I descended into the damp darkness below. The basement smelled of mold, stale air, and something else—something metallic. Blood.

As I hit the bottom steps, there was a scream. Guttural. Wet. 

I stopped, frozen in place, and stared.

Theresa lay on the ground, half-dissolved, her body nothing more than a horrific patchwork of flesh, bone, and muscle. Her left arm was gone, the skin around the wound peeling away, revealing the raw tissue underneath.

Her face… her eyes were wide with fear, but her mouth twitched as if she was trying to speak.

She saw me. Her remaining hand reached out, trembling, fingers curling weakly toward me.

“Help…” Her voice was barely a whisper, a sound that grated against the rawness of her throat.

I wanted to run. I wanted to turn around and never look back. But I couldn’t leave her. 

I took a step forward, reaching out, but then I saw *IT*.

In the far corner of the basement, just beyond Theresa’s writhing form, something moved. At first, it was just a shadow, but as I focused, I saw it clearly.

It was twisted and hunched, like a mass of tangled roots and rotting earth. 

Its face—if you could call it that—was a grotesque mask of moss and decay, its yellow eyes glowing with fury.

Its body was covered in layers of thick, wet soil, and its arms stretched impossibly long, dragging behind it like the roots of an ancient tree.

And there, beneath it, was Eddie.

Or what was left of him.

His body was melting, dissolving into a pool of blood and flesh, his skin sloughing off in sickening chunks. His eyes were wide open, staring up at the creature, his mouth open in a silent scream as his body disintegrated beneath its touch.

The creature’s eyes locked onto mine. It smiled—a twisted, gnarled smile that sent a jolt of terror straight to my core.

I couldn’t move. I couldn’t breathe.

Theresa let out another strangled cry, her hand reaching toward me, but I couldn’t do it. I couldn’t help her.

I ran.

I bolted up the stairs, my legs barely functioning beneath me. The house groaned around me, the walls seeming to close in as I tore through the living room. But halfway through, I slipped on something. 

I fell into a disgusting mush of dissolving flesh, bones and organs. I’d fallen into a sickening puddle of what was once Bennie. 

I threw up and managed to get my footing. 

I burst through the front door, into the cold night air, my feet pounding against the ground as I ran down the street, covered in the remains of Bennie. 

I didn’t know where I was going. I just ran, every shadow, every tree feeling like it was reaching for me, pulling me back toward her.

Before I knew it, I was at the sheriff’s station. The fluorescent lights flickered, buzzing in the quiet night. My body moved on instinct, my mind too scattered to register anything but the need for safety. I stumbled inside, barely able to catch my breath.

“I need help,” I gasped, collapsing against the front desk. My voice cracked with panic. “There’s something… something killed them…”

The deputy behind the desk—Wyatt, his name tag read—stared at me, his expression shifting from mild annoyance to deep concern. He leaned in closer, his brows furrowing.

"Sit down," he said. "We’ll send someone out to check."

I collapsed into the chair, my heart still racing, my pulse thundering in my ears. 

I tried to catch my breath, tried to process what I’d just seen, but it was impossible. I felt like I was still running, like it was still behind me, just out of sight.

Wyatt picked up the phone, and I waited.

But I already knew.

No one was coming back.

I waited and watched Wyatt, wondering when the call would come back and what his reaction would be. 

It didn’t take long. And when Wyatt’s eyes found mine, I could tell going there was a bad idea. 

Wyatt threw me in a cell and called the Sheriff. 

Sheriff Campbell arrived at the same time as Deputy Dale, who’d been on scene at the pill house. When I saw Dale, it was clear he’d been inside the house. Inside the basement. He looked shaken to the core. 

After a few minutes, the Sheriff came to my cell. He’d gotten a rundown from Dale and Wyatt who’d done a background check on me in the interim. 

They knew who I was, who I was affiliated with, and the types of things we did. 

The Sheriff started off by asking if I knew anything about an arson fire that blew out of control and burned up several hundred acres of trees that evening.

Turns out he’d been up all night with multiple county fire departments trying to control the blaze, to limited success. 

I shrugged. 

The Sheriff nodded. 

I told him we just didn’t know the fire would spread like that. But that there was something else happening. 

His brow furrowed, and he leaned forward through the bars: "Didn't know. Didn’t know the fire would spread, didn’t know about the chemicals, didn’t know about the deaths. What *do* you know, son?"

“That something else is going on,” I said. “Something killed my friends.” 

The Sheriff eyed me, searching for a crack. But there wasn’t one. I stayed silent. The Sheriff sighed and walked to the cell door, his keys jingling as he stepped out.

"We’ll let the FEDs figure it out," he muttered. "You can explain it to them.”

The heavy clunk of the cell door locking echoed through the room. I sat back on the metal bench, staring at the flickering light overhead.

Time dragged by slowly, and I couldn't shake the image of Bennie's mutilated body, or that thing, whatever it was, that crawled out of the woods.

Every time I blinked, I saw its yellow eyes boring into me, its misshapen face twisting with something that resembled hunger.

Suddenly, a voice peeped out from the cell next to me. I hadn’t seen the guy’s face cause he was sleeping on his bench, but I could see it now. 

His name was Jacob. He was a native from the nearby reservation. 

"You don’t know what you did," he muttered, leaning back against the cold wall. His eyes flickered toward me, dark and unreadable. 

"That land... that fire... you didn’t just burn trees. You burned her home.”

"What?" I asked, trying to keep the edge of panic from creeping into my voice. I was on edge, my nerves frayed. 

"Let me tell you a story," Jacob said, his voice almost too calm, too measured. 

"A long time ago, there was a woman who lived in those woods. She was a healer, a protector of the land. People came to her from all over, asking for help with their crops, their livestock, their families. She had a connection to the land, and she used it to help the people who respected it."

Jacob’s eyes grew distant as he continued. 

"But then the settlers came. They didn’t care about the land. They only saw it as something to take. And so they tricked her. They made promises, gave her trinkets, and slowly took her land from under her. When she realized what had happened, it was too late. She was cast out. Desperate, she went back to the forest, pleading for the earth to help her."

He paused, his voice dropping to a whisper. 

"And it did. The earth took her in, body and soul. She became part of it, her rage and sorrow growing with every tree that was cut, every fire that was set. She became a protector of the woods.“

Jacob’s eyes locked onto mine, unwavering. "You burned her home. And now she’s coming for you."

Before I could respond, the lights in the station flickered. Once, then again. 

The quiet hum of the station was suddenly broken by strange sounds—like whispering voices that echoed through the walls. 

The temperature dropped sharply, and the windows of the sheriff’s office fogged over, as if smoke was creeping in from the outside.

I stood up, my heart pounding. "What the hell’s happening?"

"She’s here."

Minutes passed. The tension in the air was suffocating. I could hear the creaks in the walls, the strange sounds like something crawling inside them. 

I wanted to scream, to run, but I was trapped in this small, suffocating cell.

Finally, Dale, the youngest deputy, rushed into the holding area, panicking. He grabbed his keys and fumbled with our locks. 

"We have to get out of here," he croaked, sweat beading on his forehead. "Something’s wrong."

The door clicked open, and Jacob and I stepped out, the weight of dread crushing my chest. We moved quickly through the dimly lit station, Dale leading the way, his hand shaking on his gun.

As we rounded a corner, I noticed something that made my blood run cold. The potted plants scattered throughout the station—the ones by the windows, by the desks—were empty. 

Their soil was gone, the contents missing. Like something had taken them.

And then, we saw it.

*HER.*

She loomed large and terrifying in the centre of the station, her body a mass of tangled roots, decaying moss, and wet earth. 

The Sheriff was half-melted at her feet, his lower half a twisted, soupy mess as the soil and plants from the office floated toward her, melding with her body and expanding its size.

Her eyes glowed a sickly yellow, fixating on us as she continued to absorb everything around her.

Dale didn’t hesitate. He raised his gun and fired, each shot tearing off chunks of her body—pieces of earth and moss spraying the room. But it only enraged her. The shots weren’t slowing her down; they were just pissing her off.

With a deep, guttural growl, she surged forward, her long, root-like arms stretching toward us.

"Go!" Jacob yelled, pushing me toward the exit. I didn’t think. I just ran, my feet pounding against the linoleum as Dale fired more shots, trying to buy us time.

But as we reached the door, I heard Jacob cry out behind me.

I turned just in time to see the Witch’s long arms wrap around Jacob, lifting him into the air. 

His face twisted in pain as her roots burrowed into his skin, and within seconds, he began to dissolve, his body breaking apart like the Sheriff’s had.

Dale fired one last shot before the Witch’s roots engulfed him, dragging him into the mess of earth and flesh of her body. His screams echoed through the station as his body melted away.

I didn’t wait to see more.

I burst through the back door, stumbling out into the cold night air. My stomach lurched as I saw what was left of Wyatt—his body a soupy, gory puddle on the ground, his face twisted in terror, barely recognizable.

But there, amidst the carnage, was his utility belt, with the keys to the squad car.

I grabbed them, my hands shaking, and raced toward the cruiser. The engine roared to life, and I sped away from the station, leaving the massacre behind me. 

And then I remembered: the old parking structure in town. Multiple levels of nothing but concrete. No trees. No grass. Just cement. It was the safest place I could think of.

I floored the gas, speeding through the dark, empty streets until I reached the parking lot. I raced up the ramps, level after level, until I reached the top floor.

Concrete. Safe.

I grabbed the shotgun from the cruiser, locking the doors behind me. My breath came in ragged gasps as I fumbled with the radio.

"This is… this is the only survivor from the sheriff’s station at Mount Pleasant,” I stammered, my voice trembling. "I’m at the parking structure on Main Street. Please… please, send help."

The radio crackled in response, but no voices came through.

I sat in the cruiser, unlocked the shotgun from its holder, and stared out into the empty lot.

And then, I heard it.

A whisper. Faint at first, carried on the wind, growing louder.

*Soon.*

I gripped the shotgun tighter, my heart pounding in my chest. The concrete beneath me felt solid, unyielding. Safe.

But the air felt thick. Heavy. The whispers grew louder.

I didn’t know if anyone was coming for me.

But I knew she was.

The sound grew louder. Closer.

I grabbed the radio again, my voice trembling. 

“Hurry,” I whispered into the receiver. “Please, hurry.”

The radio crackled back. No response.

I slammed the door locks down and huddled in the seat, my breath coming in shallow gasps, and waited.

Eventually, the police arrived. They cuffed me. Took me away. 

I never told them what really happened. Who would believe it?

The official story was simple enough. An arson attack that spiralled out of control. The fire consumed several hundred acres of forest, and five members of my group died in the blaze. 

They pinned it on me—said I was the last one standing, the only survivor. 

They don’t know about the land.

They don’t know about *Her*. 

But I do.

And I know she’s still out there, waiting, watching.

I’m behind bars now. Multiple life sentences. No parole. You’d think that would scare me. You’d think I’d miss freedom, the open sky, the feel of fresh air on my skin. 

But there’s something comforting about these concrete walls, the cold iron bars, the sterile fluorescent lights. No dirt. No grass. No trees. No Earth. No… *Her*. 

I never take outdoor time. Not after the first day they offered it. They gave me a moment to step outside, to feel the sun, to let the wind wash over me.

The second my boot touched the grass, I felt it—the ground shifting beneath me. The faintest shudder. 

I bolted back inside before anyone could ask why and haven’t been back since.
