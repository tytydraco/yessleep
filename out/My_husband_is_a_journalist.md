My husband is a journalist.

When Lee came home, I was prepping dinner in the kitchen.
He looked exhausted as he plodded in and took a seat at the dining table, giving a dramatic sigh as he did so.

“Hard day, babe?” I asked, getting him a beer from the fridge. 
He grunted in response, but I didn’t take it to heart. He rarely had rough days, mainly covering the light entertainment side of the local newspaper he wrote for.


I honestly wondered how hard it could’ve been interviewing the town’s oldest game boy player – a legitimate story he had covered not long ago! – but I let him relax instead of prying. Everyone was entitled to be in a mood every now and then.




I finished the dinner dishes and went to the Lounge to watch a show with Lee, our usual evening tradition.  But his seat on the couch was empty, and I quietly snuck upstairs to find him sleeping. I went to pull the blanket over him to keep him warm when I noticed he was clutching a piece of fabric. 

It was furry looking, bright green with pink and yellow polka dots.
I gently pried it from his hand and placed it on the bedside table.

The next morning there were dark circles under his eyes, his hair was messy and knotted, as if he had been running his hands through it non stop.


I gave him a soft smile and made his coffee, asking if he wanted eggs or cereal for breakfast, but he grunted he wasn’t hungry. 
I turned around to ask him if he was okay, but he was gone from his seat, the mug of coffee steaming and untouched. 


I made my own breakfast and while doing so, heard the shower upstairs running. I supposed he was getting ready for work, and I busied myself cleaning my breakfast dishes while I waited to see him off for the day.

After 20 minutes and no sign of Lee, it was getting close to the time I needed to leave for my job. 
I hesitated at the bottom of the stairs, feeling strangley unsure but of what – I had no idea. I called out to Lee, instead of going up. I don’t know why, it just felt safer for some reason.

When I didn’t get a response, I resigned my self to chastising myself for being so scared of nothing. I ignored my racing heart and made my up the stairs.

Lee was on our bed, still in his pyjamas. He was wringing his hands together – the piece of fabric from last night being rubbed like a talisman – and his eyes were darting back and forth between the doorway to our ensuite and where I was standing.


I didn’t know what to say.

I tried to make a joke out of the fact he had run the shower but hadn’t gotten in it, but my voice came out uptight and terse, more like I was telling him off rather than trying to ease the tension.

Lee didn’t seem to notice, he just nodded along nervously to what I was saying, not particularly paying attention, his eyes still diverting back and forth to the ensuite door.


He tried to smile at me, but it didn’t reach his eyes. It looked like a desperate sort of smile, a grimace.



“Everything okay?” I gestured towards the bathroom and saw my husband’s eyes light up with fear.
His lips opened and he said “yes” slowly, but he was wildly shaking his head the whole time.

If I wasn’t so terrified, I could’ve laughed at the absurdity of the situation. My tall, strong husband looking like he’d seen a ghost, and me, feeding off his newfound anxiety. It was silly. I shook my head as if to snap myself awake, and before Lee could say anything, I stomped over to the ensuite and flung open the door.

It was empty.
Still foggy from the shower just being on, but empty.


I did give a small and nervous laugh then, shaking my head at my own silliness. Of course the ensuite was empty. I felt better. I felt sane.
When I turned back towards the bed, Lee was gone, that green piece of fabric in his place.

I tried to push the strange events of the morning out of my mind and concertante on work. By the time knock off rolled around, I had pretty much forgotten the oddness of it all. It seemed rather like a bad dream than a memory. 

Perhaps I’d thought too much of a small situation, made it stranger than it truly was.
When I got home, I knew that wasn’t the case.

Lee’s car was in the drive, and my arms were filled with indian takeout – our favourite.
If Lee was having such a hard time at work, it was my job as his wife to help him relax. A movie and take out would be perfect.
I unlocked the front door and called out I was home, setting the food on the counter and getting two beers from the fridge. 

I couldn’t find Lee anywhere, and not for lack of looking. I assumed he’d gotten home and gone out again for a run or something.
After what felt like an hour, I gave up, and settled down on the couch to finally drink my beer – and try and settle my worry about Lee. I made a vow to get him to talk to me, to tell me what was going on, so I could help him. He wasn’t his usual self.

I was halfway through the second beer when I heard the floorboards creak behind me.


My heart instantly started to race because while we heard the odd creak or moan of the house, this sounded different, like someone shifting their weight. 


I reasoned I hadn’t heard footsteps, I hadn’t heard the front door open or close. I was obviously on edge from how strange lee was being.
I turned my head slightly, not expecting to see anything. 

Certainly not expecting to see a figure encased in fur behind me.
I screamed and the figure moved forward, towards me, at lightening speed, and within seconds it was face to face with me, and I was staring into glass beeady eyes, green fur with pink and yellow polka dots.


It wasn’t a costume like I’d ever seen before. It was sewn haphazardly, it looked more sinister than sweet.

My brain understood it was the fabric I’d found my husband clutching. What I couldn’t comprehend is why the hell.. of how.. he had made it into a .. costume. The fabric covered him from head to toe, think sully from [monsters.inc](http://monsters.inc) but without the cuteness.


I screamed again, but this time it wasn’t out of fear but out of anger.


“What the hell is wrong with you, you scared the shit out of me! Not funny.”

Lee didn’t even reply, just stood there staring me down before slowly walking off out of the room.

Lee kept his distance from me that evening, and I was pleased for it. I was beyond pissed off at his attempt at humour, and even as I was about to climb into bed, I couldn’t help but feel my rage bubbling over as he came out of the ensuite, still wearing the damn costume.

I sarcastically asked if he was going to be wearing that monstrosity to sleep, and he replied silently by turning off the lamp, and climbing into bed. Within minutes, I could hear him snoring while I simmered in anger.


He knew I wasn’t a fan of fucking costumes, especially ones so creepy. I couldn’t believe he could be so selfish to find it amusing enough to not give up the stupid joke. I was glad he was feeling happier, but not at my expense.

I woke up to an empty bed, strips of fabric on the sheets and hoped that Lee had finally taken off the stupid costume. I could hear the shower running, and gave a sigh of relief.
I was still pissed, but knowing the joke was over, o felt myself relax and calm down. I went downstairs to make us breakfast.

The newspaper was sitting on the front step. I waved to the paper boy as I collected it.

I sipped my coffee and made my way through the articles, looking out for Lee’s weekly write up. Usually we would read it together, but I could still hear the shower running, and I also wanted to find out what had set him off. Was it a really boring interview he’d been sent to? Something he didn’t morally agree with?


I had to know.

But there was no article from Lee, there was just a small printed note advising an apology that this week’s article wouldn’t be going ahead but to keep an eye out for next week for a bumper review!

For the first time in 10 years, Lee had not had his weekly article published.
I wondered if he had missed a deadline. I couldn’t imagine any other reason. But missing a deadline didn’t make sense either because He had written hail, rain or shine, sick and spewing, hungover, jetlagged.. he was just that reliable type of person.

When Lee came down stairs wearing the costume, I stifled a scream. I steadied myself against the counter, slowing my breathing to calm my racing heart.

“Honey, don’t you think it’s a.bit hot today to wear that.. outfit?” I made an effort to keep my voice neutral even though I was shaking inside.
Lee moved his masked head in my direction, bobbling it up and down in a horrificly comical nod, while his voice spoke and said the opposite, muffled from being inside the mask.
“No.”

I squirmed around, unsure what to say from his response. I asked him if he was having trouble at work, and again, the mask bobbled up and down in a nod, but his voice said No.
I asked him if he would please remove his mask, if not the whole outfit, just so I could kiss him. 


This time he didn’t nod nor speak, but instead stood up and reached out for my hand.
I didn’t want to touch the costume. The thought of the fabric touching me sent shivers up my spine, but [for.mu](http://for.mu) husband, I took a deep breath and sucked up my fear, and put my hand in his.


Silently he led me upstairs to the bedroom, opening the door and walking in to point his furry hand down at the bed.
Another costume, this time the faux fur was bright orange, with blue tiger stipes and purple polka dots. 

It looked as if it [was.my](http://was.my) size.

I wanted to scream.
I told him in no uncertain circumstances would I put that costume on. I loved him. I wanted to help him. But there’s no bloody way I would be wearing that. Ever.

I realised that my husband was obviously having a nervous breakdown. 
I told him I would be taking the day off so I could take him to see the doctor and get him some help.

The costume’s shoulders shrunk, as if inside it Lee was withering in defeat. 
He let me take him to the car, buckle.him in. I gave up on asking him to take off his costume, ignoring the looks from our neighbours as I held the hand of this furry creature while we walked to the car.

The hospital was busy, with hardly any seats And the nurse who took our details, looked sceptical when I asked aboutu husband seeing someone from the mental health team.
Her “We will see what we can do.” Didn’t seem very convincing, but I had.no.other option but to wait.

We were. Receiving constant stares and murmurs from the other patients in the waiting room, and I felt my ears burn with embarassment but Lee didn’t seem to.notice. he waved at a few people who quickly looked away in horror.
I buried my head in my phone and kept myself busy while we waited.

The doctor was an older man, with kind eyes and graying hair.
He listened intently,.nodding so often as I spoke, and when he replied he spoke softly himself as he looked over my husband.


“He’s.perfectly.fine.” the doctor told me, a knowing smile.on his face. “It’s you that I’m worried about, to be honest, Mrs Write. You’re showing signs of paranoia regarding the costume. If you’ll just put it on, you’ll see you’re making a big deal out of nothing.”

I couldn’t believe what I was heading. I felt.goosebumps, the hair on the back of my neck standing up as I considered if I was insane, or if the doctor had really said what I thought he said.


As if he could read my mind, the doctor nodded again, “The costume isn’t the problem, dear. It’s perfectly fine. Now are you going to be a good girl.and put it on?”
He was looking at me expectantly, waiting for my reply.

My husband was staring at me from his costume, waiting for me to reply. I couldn’t see his expression due to the mask, but I could feel it – worry, sadness, a glimmer of hope that I would do what the good doctor ordered. 

A bag beside him rustled and I realised he had snuck the costume in without me knowing. I felt sick.




I ran out of the room without looking back. I didn’t know where to go, I didn’t want to home, it didn’t feel safe.
I found myself at the newspaper, at reception and asking, rather loudly and tearfully, to speak to Harold, the papers editor. It was an emergency, I said, regarding my husband, Lee Write.

Harold pulled me into his office swiftly, his brow creased with worry before I’d even began talking.
He pulled the blinds down, pacing in silence for the first few moments.


Wordlessly he went to a cabinet and pulled a bottle of jack Daniels out, pouring two nips into shot glasses.
He skulled one and passed the other [tto.me](http://tto.me), which I just stared at dumbly.


It was 10 in the morning.

Sensing I had no interest in drinking it, Harold sighed and told me it [was.in](http://was.in) my best interest. I’d need it, for.what I was about to hear.

I didn’t need telling twice, and downed it without another minute delay, feeling the burn in my throat.

“On Monday, Lee was sent to cover a story. This was a run of the mill, hole in the wall type of puppetry performance made by a local weirdo – and yes, yes I get the term isn’t nice, but trust me, these guys aren’t your usual cup of tea. 


Anyway, he’s supposed to talk to this bloke who does the play -  a one man play, mind you and with bloody puppets – and the guy only talks to him for the interview through these weird home made puppets. 


Whole interview gave me the creeps and I don’t scare easily. We decided not.to. run it. I told lee and was expecting his response to be not too pleased, I mean I was going to pay him regardless but he couldn’t have cared less. He was more concerned about what he was doing – just holding this bit of fabric, and smiling. Odd stuff, right? 

Anyway, he announces he’s leaving for the day and it’s only like 3pm at this stage so I ask where hes off too, considering it’s not even knock off, and he tells me hes going to watch the show. 


The fucking puppet show. 


I don’t believe him, cause why the hell would he? I mean, i cant even describe how weird it all was. 
One dude holding a bunch of creepy puppets in a basement, like this is weird, right? 
So I follow him. 


And he isn’t lying, he goes back to the address we gave him, the same place he’d been just hours before. He gets outta the car and goes into the house, and I am kinda creeped by now but thinking what the fuck, so I obviously follow him.


The thing is, when I get down to the basement, the fucking things empty. No puppet show set up to be seen. Weird, cause I watched the footage of a shitty.homemade stage that was there just hours before. 


But even weirder, Lee is just standing Infront of an empty space on the wall, and laughing his damn head off.


He’s.not. looking at nothing, just blank wall. I ask him if he’s okay and when he turns I see he’s crying. He shakes his head like he’s saying he’s not okay, but he tells me he is. The whole situation feels weird and I try and drag Lee out of there but he doesn’t wanna go. He tells me he’s enjoying the show.


I want him to be joking and playing a joke on me but I can tell he’s not. I got the hell outta there.”



I take all this in with fear rising in my stomach. None of this makes sense.
I tell Harold about the strangeness going on at home and with the costume, and about the odd things the doctor said.

Harold nods as I speak, like it all finally makes sense.
I am feeling better getting it off my chest., finding an alley who can help me solve whatever the hell is going on.
Harold opens his desk draw and rummages around for a few moments.


He pulls out a notebook and pen, and his face is a picture of concentration as he scrawls out words.


After a moment or so he stops writing, and rips the page from the notebook, carefully folding it in half before passing it over to me.

I’m focused on the note, on the secrecy of writing it in the first place and not just speaking to me when I’m right Infront of him.

I barely.notice Harold getting up. 
I barely hear the window sliding open.

I definitely hear the crush of Harold’s bones as he combines with the pavement below, while his words glare up at me from the notebook.

“Wear the costume or don’t – it doesn’t matter anymore. We are all affected, it is too late for us now. Wear the costume or take the easy way out, like me. You can’t escape, there’s no point to even try.”



I gave the police my interview, numb from shock and depleted of emotion. I was cold, hungry and confused. I didn’t know where my husband was.

The police gave me a lift home, offering to have a look through the house for me when I related my fears of strange happenings.
The house was.empty, no sign of Lee or anyone else.for. that matter. 


The younger officer patted my hand as she was leaving, a sincere look on her kind face as she told me to just put on the costume.
I was too shocked to speak, I felt numb as I watched the patrol car drive away.


I called Lee who didn’t answer, leaving a message for him to call me.

 I called  my mum, my usual sounding board for when things weren’t going right. She answered on the third ring and soothed my cries for an hour, before sighing and telling me if I just put on the costume, things would be so much easier.


I was horrified and hung up without saying goodbye.

The sun’s set and the stars are out, and my husband is finally home.
His costume has started to smell a bit, the green fur has mattered and looks dirty, making it more grey than green now.
I fix him a coffee which he doesn’t drink.
I ask him if he is feeling better now, and his face shakes wilding left to right, while his voice confidently booms “Never better”.

I spent hours searching forums online. And I don’t like what I found.


So many people having the same experience, after seeing an odd home made puppets show they cannot seem to find the information for anymore.
Out experiences were all different but the same.

Parents finding their kids in costumes they didn’t make, the kids refusing to take them off. 
Stressed and worried partners posting about their husband or wives newfound costume love, and how strangers and people they know are encouraging them to try it out.


There’s even some posts from people with the costumes, the ones who started it all, I guess.
They say how good it is, how nice and safe you feel tucked up into a costume.


They say, it’s better.
They say, just try it. You won’t regret it.

At the start, I hated the idea. I was so.scared of a bit of fabric,a bit of faux fur.. and why?


Now I realise how silly I have been.


It is so lovely, so nice and safe in the costume.
You should try it, you would love it.
