I hated that I had to clean out my grandfather’s house after the funeral. The finality of it hurt almost too much to bear but somebody had to do it.

My grandfather lived in the White Mountains, small cabin nestled in the foothills. I remember coming here as a kid, hiking and hunting with him.

You’d think it would be quick—small cabin, right? Unfortunately my grandfather was a bit of a hoarder so it took days to sift through what was valuable and what wasn’t. He loved to collect old things that were tied into stories and fables. Most of it seemed like junk to me at the time.

Most of it was real junk, until I found a journal, leather-bound, right on his bedside table. It was old and dusty. I picked it up, and when I opened it all I read was names, dozens of names. As I kept reading through the names, some of them would be jumbled and half written.

Halfway through the journal, the pacing changed for the names—closer together, barely legible—and that’s when I realized… it wasn’t a bunch of names but his name. Over and over again. Half the time it wasn’t even spelled right.

I closed the book, its cracked and dusty texture moving in my hands.

I took a deep breath. He was pretty old, and he had lost his wits toward the end. I tried to move past it and kept cleaning out the cabin. He had still kept a lot of the toys I played with as a kid growing up—I hadn’t been here in a few years, life had gotten in the way.

Most of the toys were where I remembered them: a little wooden moose carved from pine, a slingshot he whittled for me one Christmas, an old metal compass that never pointed north. I turned the moose over in my hand, running my thumb across the worn grooves. The paint had chipped away, but it still felt sturdy. Real. Like the sort of thing a childhood should anchor itself to.

There was one toy—if you could even call it a toy—that I didn’t remember playing with. It was a small bell with a braided cord wrapped around it. I turned it over in my hands as I noticed how old it really was.

The metal was dark with age, not rusted but dulled, as if it had been handled too many times. The cord was frayed in places, braided tight in others, like someone had rewoven parts of it repeatedly. The bell barely made a sound when I shook it—just a faint, tired rattle, like whatever was inside had worn itself down to dust.

I didn’t know why, but holding it made me uneasy.
Not scared.
Just… wrong-footed. Like I was touching something meant for someone else.

I tried to think back—had I ever played with a bell here? Maybe when I was really young? But the harder I tried to place it in a memory, the further that memory slipped away. At one point I thought I had something—a flash of my grandfather lifting me up, the bell in his hands—but when I focused on the image, it dissolved instantly. Gone.

I studied the bell again. Along the rim, someone—maybe my grandfather—had scratched a word into the metal. The letters were so faint they were almost invisible. I brought it closer to my face, squinting, and for a second I could’ve sworn I knew exactly what it said.

Then my eyes slid off the letters like they were oil.

I blinked hard. Looked again.

Nothing.
Just scratches.

A cold draft moved through the cabin then, brushing the back of my neck. Enough to raise goosebumps. Enough to make me set the bell down quicker than I meant to.

The moment it left my hand, the cabin felt lighter.
Like I’d put down a weight I didn’t realize I was carrying.

I stepped back from it, breathing a little too fast.
Maybe it was stress. Maybe grief. Maybe I was just tired after days of sorting through his things.

But as I turned to walk toward the kitchen, I heard something behind me.

A single, soft tick.

The bell settling.
Or something inside it shifting.

I froze.
Waited.

Then another tick, quieter this time.

I swallowed, told myself not to be stupid, and forced myself to look back.

The bell hadn’t moved.
At least… not that I could tell.

But the braided cord?
It looked tighter.
Coiled.

As if someone had just pulled it.

⸻

I laughed at myself and shook my head at how paranoid I was being. I tried to brush it off but I couldn’t—something told me to go back to the journal. I made my way back into the bedroom and picked it back up.

I studied the cover, cracked and dusty like before, but this time I could make out a faint word on it.

Nafn–

I squinted. Tilted it toward the lamplight.
Letters surfaced beneath the dust, faint and uneven, like they’d been pressed into the leather rather than written.

nafnlaus?

The word felt heavy in my mouth.
Wrong.
Like speaking it gave it something it had been waiting for.

I shut the journal quickly, suddenly cold.

I had never seen that word before in my life…
and yet it felt disturbingly familiar.
Like something my grandfather had whispered to me once, long ago, and I had just now remembered.

Or maybe—
maybe I had just now forgotten.

I whispered it once to myself, testing the sound of it in the room.
Trying to place it in my head.

“…nafnlaus.”

It felt heavy on my tongue. Like a word I wasn’t supposed to say alone.

I opened the book again.

And it was empty.

Every page.
Blank.
Soft and yellowed, but untouched—no ink, no names, no frantic handwriting, nothing at all.

Just paper.

I flipped through it faster, my heart pounding. Page after page after page. Completely clean.

I stared down at the journal in disbelief.
I knew what I had seen. The names. His name. The pages torn by the pen. The ink. The smudges. All of it.

Now it looked like something bought from a craft store.
Unused.
Unbothered.

It shouldn’t have been empty.

But more than that—
I realized, suddenly—

I couldn’t remember a single name that had been in it.

Not even his.

⸻

I closed the book again, taking a deep breath.
In that moment I made a decision to take the book with me—
I had to understand it.

I slipped it into my backpack and left the cabin without looking back.

The drive home blurred by. I kept thinking about that word—nafnlaus—rolling it around in my mind like a stone I couldn’t put down. I tried to remember where I’d heard it before, or why it felt familiar, but every time I got close to the answer, it slipped away like a dream I’d forgotten as soon as I woke.

When I got home, I pulled the journal out again.
Still blank.

But as I ran my thumb along the inside cover, I felt a faint indentation.
Like someone had pressed hard against the page once.
Not writing—
just pressure.

I tilted it toward the light, but nothing appeared.
No ink. No marks.

It shouldn’t have meant anything.

But I couldn’t stop staring at it.

A weight settled in my chest again—the same one from the cabin.
A quiet pull I couldn’t explain.

I closed the book gently.

I told myself I was only keeping it out of respect.
To preserve whatever strange thing my grandfather had been working on.

But the truth was simpler, and far more dangerous:

I wanted to know what he knew.
I wanted to know what he found.
I wanted to know what nafnlaus meant.

And why saying it out loud felt like remembering something
I should’ve forgotten.
