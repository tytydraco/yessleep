It was winter in Clearwater. We were twelve. I had always been a lonely kid, owed to my lack of siblings and inability to talk to others. Until I met Noah. He changed everything. 

If the middle of nowhere had a name, it would be Clearwater. Clearwater was not a town where things happened. It was a two day drive from the nearest other place with human life and was entirely landlocked by desert. Most of the people I never spoke to from my school growing up came and went. Two large towers that hung in the skyline permeated black smoke into the air at all times, and I was sure more than half of the citizens would develop lung cancer. It was a mining town, and people would fly in and out for work. Me and my mother, however, were stuck there. My father had moved us there before I was born for better work. He didn’t stick around too long, and my mother never had the money to leave. 

I met Noah Baker during seventh grade in detention. This is not so much my story as it is his. Detention was a rare occurrence for me, and not one I wanted to repeat due to the chewing out my mother gave me when I got home that night. Usually I sat in the very back of classes and tried to keep my head down as much as possible, but I had seen Noah kicked out of enough classes to know he had a reputation. He was loud-mouthed and the type of kid I never thought I’d utter a word to. Then he complimented my band shirt. Though I was scared of the teacher chastising us for talking, I was too excited to stop. I’d never thought anyone else in Clearwater listened to the type of music I listened to. His older brother had my favourite bands entire discography on CD. Later that week, I went over to Noah’s house and we listened to them for hours. 

Detention became more of an occurrence for me after I met Noah. My mother got over it eventually. He was a beacon of light. The only good thing buried in the soot of Clearwater. I never knew the type of person I could be before Noah. 

It was midday Wednesday. Noah and I were in the shopping centre, all the way across town from school. The old men at the kebab shop used to kick us out and usher us back to school, but they’d become so used to us by now they just tossed us whatever leftover food they had.  We’d exhausted our skateboards for the day and had already ransacked the junkyard for anything cool. As usual, there was nothing to do but kill time in Clearwater. 

Noah was on his third meat-amalgamation kebab when he showed me his phone screen with a shit eating grin. “Look at this.”

“Ew, what the fuck? Don’t show me that, dude. Gross.” I shoved his phone away from me as he cackled. His screen was flooded with pornographic images of middle aged men, complete with their names and ages. 

“What, you hate gays or something?” Noah asked. 

“No, dude! There’s a bunch of dick and balls on your phone!” The kebab shop owners shot us some strange looks after that one. 

Noah laughed. “Relax, man. It’s a dating app.”

“Why would you sign up for a gay dating app? I thought you had a crush on Katie.”

He rolled his eyes. “I’m not trying to get some old man to dick me down, you moron.” Moron was not the word he used, but I won’t repeat what he said. “I made a fake profile. I wanted to see if anyone we knew was on here. Clearwater’s not that big. Come here.” He patted the seat next to him. Reluctantly, I joined. 

Despite how much some of the pictures invoked the feeling of vomit entering my mouth, it was pretty funny. Noah had used his older brothers photos, Charlie, and put the account under a fake name. We recognised some of the guys as macho miners who spent their nights at the only bar in town getting way too drunk and punching the first person who dared speak to them. We even saw our gym teacher, who was married with children but we’d always had an inkling about. None of the other grown men we knew waxed their legs. 

By the time we’d stopped our manhunt, the fake account was flooded with messages. Most of them were just lewd images that we photoshopped to be smaller and sent back to them- but one stood out to us. It was an account with no picture and the name Anonymous. The message said he could treat a beautiful boy like us to anything we wanted. 

Noah started typing. I grabbed his arm. “Um, what are you doing? We don’t know who this guy is.” 

Noah rolled his eyes. “Stop being a pussy. This guy’s probably lying anyway. Why not fuck with him?” 

“Because we have better stuff to do?” I was desperately failing at hiding my reluctance to talking on strangers online, something my mother had vehemently warned me against. The phone I had at the time was her old flip phone, so I couldn’t even if I wanted to. 

“I’m tired of playing Dark Souls. We can’t even beat Manus, anyway. Besides, it’s fine. He doesn’t even know who we are.” 

I relented. Noah, all too pleased with himself, went on about typing his message. He requested a pack of cigarettes and fifty dollars, for a lewd photo in exchange. It took about ten seconds for Anonymous to reply. He agreed, and asked us where we’d like to meet. 

“We are not meeting up with that guy. What if he’s a serial killer?” I said. Noah shushed me, and went about asking the guy to drop the cigarettes and cash in a mailbox down the road from his house. 

Within five seconds, Anonymous agreed. We killed thirty minutes skating inside the shopping centre before being chased out by the sole security guard. Noah realised he missed a message. It was a photo of a pack of cigarettes and a fifty dollar note in the exact mailbox he’d requested. 

We couldn’t skate to Noah’s street fast enough. My shaking was so bad that I thought for sure I was going to go into anaphylactic shock. Sure enough, when we arrived at the mailbox, an unopened pack of cigarettes and a fifty dollar note sat inside. Noah burst out laughing, holding the Marlboros high above his head like he had just won a noble war. I couldn’t help but smile. We were the richest kids in Clearwater. 

My excitement was subdued by a white SUV, far too clean for the desert we lived in, parked at the end of the street. Noah assured me the truck had always been there, but something about it made me feel uneasy, like the truck itself was watching me. I was more reassured when I saw the truck was empty, though. We raced back to Noah’s house to steal his mother’s candle lighter. After throwing up in his toilet from smoking four cigarettes back to back, I let Noah have the rest of the pack to himself. We took the fifty dollars and went to the only store in town that sold video games, and left with Dark Souls II and a few skater games. All of our weekends were spent in front of Noah’s Playstation 3 eating pizza until we inevitably crashed at three in the morning. Noah fell asleep on my shoulder countless times, and I never had the heart to push him off. I saw his mother more than I saw my own. 

As for Anonymous, Noah blocked him and deleted the app as soon as we retrieved our bounty. We never heard from him again. If I knew then what I know now, I would’ve forced Noah to flush his phone down the toilet. I’m not sure it would’ve done much, though. 

That’s when the night terrors started. They only nights I was free of them were the ones I spent sleeping on Noah’s floor, but I never told him that. It felt far too corny. He probably would’ve told me it’s because I was in love with him. 

I’d wake entirely paralysed. It was a strange form of sleep paralysis, because I never saw any figures or entities at the end of my bed which I guess is meant to be common for that type of thing. The only thing I could make sense of was the unbearable ache in my legs and the creaking of my floorboards. The wood was so loud it was like a cat shrieking. By the time my paralysis subsided, tears would be running down my face and my throat would be raw from screaming for my mother. She’d rush in and hold me, then let me sleep in her bed for the night. I omitted that part whenever I told anyone about the night terrors, especially Noah. As soon as my mother would come barrelling into the room, my floorboards would stop creaking instantly. I’d asked her countless times, but she told me she could never hear anything through the walls. For the longest time, I assumed it was just my mind trying to scare me. 

We went to the junkyard a lot because no one in town had the desire to be there except us. It was our haven that reeked of shit, but we got used to smell after a while.  We spent most of our hours slamming baseball bats into car wrecks or pretending we were Gran Turismo drivers. Sometimes we’d dig through the piles of muck and find decently new action figures or sports cards. The best one we’d found was a Spiderman with a missing leg. 

“Look! A new one!” Noah called from across the yard. I was covered in dirt by the time I reached him. Sure enough, a new wreck stood before us just waiting to be conquered. The car was so compacted it was almost halved, with missing wheels and blown out windows. I eagerly hopped into the passenger seat, avoiding the broken glass, as Noah took his usual spot in the drivers seat. He made revving noises as he pretended to whip the car around and I pretended to hold on for dear life. We acted out a pretty believable crash where both of us miraculously survived. 

After that, Noah went quiet. His hand was still on the gearstick as he spoke. “Maybe we could fix one of these cars up.” 

“You’re too stupid to be a mechanic, though,” I said. Noah punched me in the arm. His smile was short lived. 

“I’m serious. I’m sure we could figure it out. My dad has a bunch of old car books.”

“Why do we need a car, anyway? We have our boards.” 

“So we can get out of Shitwater. This place blows. I’ve never even seen the city.” 

I smiled, getting far too swept up in an unobtainable fantasy. “What would we do in the city? Like for money.”

Noah thought for a moment, then his eyes lit up. “I’d become a famous skater, obviously. Then we’d both get really hot girlfriends.” 

“And what about me?” 

“You’d live with me, obviously. You wouldn’t need a job. I’d pay for everything with my skating money,” Noah said, as if I was stupid for not knowing that in the first place. He pressed his foot down on the accelerator as if we were shooting down the highway towards the city. 

“That’d be nice if we could drive,” I said. Our licences were still a good few years away. 

“Let’s fix up one of these cars. Then when I can drive, we’ll take it to the city.” 

I surveyed the wrecks that surrounded us, making the junkyard look more like an endless stretch of mountains. Most of them were just soulless hunks of crumpled metal. “I don’t know if any of these can be fixed, though.”

“Whatever, dude! You’re bumming me out. Now, let’s see what they’ve left for us in here this time,” Noah sighed. He leant over me and pressed the button that opened the glove box. As the contents fell onto my lap, my blood ran ice cold. “Holy shit, score!” Noah cried out. 

An unopened pack of Marlboros sat in my lap. The exact same brand and size as the ones we’d received in the mailbox a few weeks earlier. A fifty dollar note was wrapped around it. 

“Dude,” I said, my hands raised in fear. Noah seemed to realise my meaning when he saw how wide my eyes had shot. 

He snapped the cigarettes up, tearing the plastic off the wrapper like it was Christmas morning. “You don’t think it’s the same guy, do you?” 

I was too afraid to move, or do much of anything really. It felt like my breathing was speeding up but I couldn’t really tell. 

“Hey, dude. You okay?” Noah asked, a lit cigarette in his mouth that I hadn’t noticed him light. He passed it over to me but I shoved it away. 

“Why the hell are you smoking that? You don’t know what could be in it!” I said. 

“Tastes fine to me,” Noah shrugged, flicking ash out of the broken window. Smoke flooding my nostrils made it even harder to breathe. “Even if it is the same guy, so what?”

“So what?” I repeated incredulously. “Why would he leave them here of all places? That means he knows where we are.” 

“You’re so dramatic,” Noah rolled his eyes. “Look, the note was covered in dust. It’s been in there for a while.”

Realising Noah was right eased my breathing somewhat, but not all the way. “You didn’t text him again, did you?” 

“What? No! You saw me block him!” Noah seemed offended I’d even asked.  

Suspicion wracked me. “Noah, check your phone.”

He sighed in protest, but pulled his phone out of his pocket nonetheless and shot me a mock salute. The screen turned on and revealed a wall of empty notifications. Anonymous hadn’t texted him, after all. I felt kind of stupid by this point. Maybe I was being too dramatic. 

“So you don’t think we should go to the police? Or maybe even tell your mom?” I asked. Noah’s mom was way calmer about things than mine tended to me. 

“Are you crazy? And tell them what? Mom would kill me if she knew I was smoking, better yet that I’d catfished a guy with my brothers photos. I’m sure the cops wouldn’t like that too much, either. You’re just being dramatic.” 

Words escaped me. Noah was usually right about things. He had always been smarter than me, despite how hard he tried to make it seem like that wasn’t the case. Maybe he was right about this, too. 

“Should we go to Gamestop?” he asked as he waved around the fifty dollars, putting out his cigarette on the steering wheel. 

I shook my head. “Keep the money. I don’t want it,” I said. I felt melodramatic as I was saying it, though. 

“Your loss,” Noah shoved the fifty dollar note in his pocket. “You’re such a baby sometimes.”

“At least I won’t have mouth cancer by the time I’m thirty,” I said, the smell of smoke still clinging to my hair. 

“We live in Clearwater, dude. We’re all dying of smoke inhalation anyway.” I laughed. The mood seemed to ease after that as we went about our usual day of doing nothing and firing through the pack of smokes. We ended up at the video game store after all, but nothing caught our eye. Despite how uneventful the rest of the day was, I was more reserved than usual. I just couldn’t shake the feeling I was being watched. Every white car I saw put me on edge, which Noah made sure to torment me for. If only we had just swallowed our pride and gone to the cops. So much could’ve changed. 

The night terrors were only getting worse. The floorboards only got louder as the weeks passed, and my usual paralysis was now accompanied by bright flashing and whirring outside my window. The natural conclusion I came to was that it was a UFO. Aliens were watching me and planning to beam me up to their home planet. I can’t describe the fear I felt during these nights. It just isn’t possible to put into words unless you’ve lived it. 

On the nights my mother spent in my room, the paralysis didn’t happen. The flashing stopped and so did the floorboards, but I could never sleep during those nights either way. I eventually settled on sleeping on the couch every night. With the TV on throughout the night, I almost couldn’t hear the creaking coming from my room. My mother still professed she couldn’t hear it, but she promised I’d start seeing a therapist as soon as she could afford it, which I was less than thrilled for. 

My fear began to slowly subside, though it was ever present and stained everything I did. One weekend Noah made me watch Alien and I cried so hard I threw up. I couldn’t look at the stars anymore. I was too scared of what might be up there. 

A few weeks later, it happened to be one of the rare occasions me and Noah were both at school. We were mid crude portrait of our english teacher, one of our many works of art, when the principals voice came over the PA and summoned us both to the office. I’m sure my face was beet red from everyone in our class having their eyes on me. I was certain the principal wanted to see us about how much school we’d been missing, but when I saw my mothers concerned face and Noah’s mother next to her I knew immediately. This was something else. 

Noah and I took a seat across from Principal Welles’ desk, and he shot me a look that told me everything was going to be okay. 

The principal asked if we’d met anyone strange outside of school. Noah and I both denied it, but I was fighting the urge to spew out everything strange that had happened to us over the past few weeks. The only thing that held me back was the presence of Noah’s mother. She shot me a kind, sympathetic look. She’d always been nicer to me than my own mother. 

Principal Welles then told us what we were about to see might be alarming, but told us he needed us to explain. My mother was stifling back sobs so hard she had to leave the room. The principal placed a manilla envelope on the desk and poured the contents out, square pieces of white paper. It took me a moment to realise the contents of what I was seeing. When the pictures finally started to make sense, I wanted to grab the nearest trashcan and expel my lunch. 

Some of them were polaroids. Others were grainy images that had printer lines through them. The photos all had one thing in common- Noah and I were in every single one. Some of them were in the junkyard we’d spent so many of our days. One of them I recognised as us sitting in the front seats of a wrecked car, with Noah smoking a freshly found cigarette. Some of them were us hunched over Playstation controllers on the floor of Noah’s room. Most of them were of me sleeping, though. I was crying in most of them. I wanted to cry now, too. My body wouldn’t let me. There must have been hundreds. 

The principal asked us if we had any idea what these photos were. Noah was the one to tell him that we didn’t. His hands were balled up and shaking in the corner of my vision. Principal Welles explained that the envelope had been dropped in the schools mailbox, and was addressed to me. There was no return address and no sign of who had sent it. The only contents were the photos. Welles talked about what the process was from here, handing over the photos to the police and how the school would help us file a report, but I wasn’t really listening. I was looking at Noah. His face was blank. 

I was barely listening when my mother was yelling at me in the hallway, too. My head was spinning too much. I remember being deathly afraid that she was going to kill me over the photos of me smoking, but she either didn’t notice or didn’t pay it any mind. Noah and his mother were further down the hallway. She was knelt down and holding him close to her chest, whispering something I couldn’t make out. 

I only saw Noah one more time after that. My mother didn’t want me to talk to him anymore. I could still hear my floorboards creaking from the living room every night. 

Noah pulled me out of class one day to go for a walk. We hadn’t really said much to each other after the principals office. Every time I called him it went to voicemail, and every message got left on delivered. I didn’t really know what to say to him anyway. Everything scared me. 

We were standing out the back of the school building. Noah pulled out a cigarette and lit it, offering me one. I took it, though I knew I’d end up letting him finish it. “I’m sorry,” he said as smoke filtered out of his mouth. 

“I wish you would just talk to me,” I said, my frustration finally bubbling up. “I don’t understand.” 

“I just… I haven’t known what to do,” Noah said, avoiding eye contact at all costs. I’d never seen him look this afraid, or this tired. 

“What do you mean?” I asked. 

“It’s just… nevermind,” he sighed. “I haven’t been able to sleep. We’ve had animals living under our house. We can’t find them, though. They’re really loud at night.”

My stomach churned. “The aliens are at my house, too. That’s why I get paralysed.”

“What? Dude, what are you talking about?” 

“The floorboards! They creak really loud all night.”

“Dude, you probably just have an animal problem, too. It’s super common here. Especially because it’s cold lately. Aliens aren’t real.”

“Oh,” I said. He was probably right. He always was. His cigarette butt was promptly crushed beneath his shoe as I handed him what was left of mine. 

“Anyway,” he said. “I wanted to talk to you because we’re moving.” 

“Moving? Where?”

“To the city. My dad got some good job there. I think we’re going at the end of the month,” he said. 

“Oh,” I said again. I wanted to be happy for him. But I couldn’t deny the boiling jealousy in my gut. The city was meant to be our place, not just his alone. I didn’t want him to leave me, even if we weren’t talking as much lately. “That’s cool. You’ll have fun there.”

“Uh-huh,” he said blankly. Then, as if sensing the sadness permeating my being, he spoke again. “You know I won’t forget about you, right?” 

“You already have,” I mumbled. 

“It’s not like that. I’ve just… felt bad. It isn’t anything to do with you. You’re still my best friend.” 

I nodded, but I wasn’t sure what to say to make him understand. I might’ve been his best friend, but he was the only friend I’d ever had. “Will you call me again and stuff? When you’re in the city.”

“Dude, when I can drive, I’ll come pick you up. We can skate around the city and stuff. You can even live with me.”

I smiled. I had finally gotten my friend back. “Cool.” 

Noah hung out with me for the rest of the day like he used to before all the bad stuff started happening. It was like nothing had changed. Looking back, it was probably one of the best days of my life. The school day ended, and I said goodbye to Noah Baker. I wanted to come over, but he said he had to pack for the big move. I didn’t know it would be the last time. 

For the next few months, it was silent. None of my calls went through. None of my texts delivered. Noah was gone, and he’d left an aching void in his wake. I didn’t have anything without him. No one at school really spoke to me, and I spent all my afternoons on the couch watching anything that could numb my mind. My skateboard was forgotten about. It wasn’t fun without him. 

My mother did her best to comfort me. She said Noah’s family had probably moved sooner than he thought, and he hadn’t had time to say goodbye. He was probably busy in the city with his new life, and he’d call me eventually. I knew that wasn’t true. Noah had completely forgotten about me. 

The creaking under my floorboards stopped. I got a few nights of peaceful sleep without paralysis or any UFOs- before the smell came. It was subtle at first. Then, within a week, my whole room stank like something had crawled in there and died. I had never smelled anything so strong, and I pray I never will again. I couldn’t even set foot in my room without my stomach churning and my eyes watering. 

We sprayed the entire room down with cleaning products, but it was a short lived solution. The smell returned, even more pungent than before. It was like invisible gallons of expired meat and faeces left in the sun had been poured into my bedroom. My mother, equipped with a mask and gloves, went into my room and tore apart every piece of furniture. She even called some of the guys who worked at the mine to come and help. Even when my room was entirely barren, the smell still lingered. 

One of the men said it was the worst thing he’d ever smelled, like something had crawled under the house and died. My mother said she’d check the crawlspace. We found the source of the smell that night. 

My mother told me to lock myself in the bathroom and not come out until she said to. From how kind she was acting, I could tell something was very wrong. It was minutes before police sirens echoed down my street. From the bathroom, I could only make out the red and blue lights from the window. I was in the bathroom for an hour, though it felt like an eternity. The figure of an SUV loomed down the street. It was white. I kept my eye on the car for the entire hour, but it didn’t move once. 

Eventually, the lights and sirens died down and my mother told me to unlock the bathroom door. Her eyes were bright red, but she smiled when she told me that it was just an infestation of small animals who had curled up and died right under my bedroom. I wouldn’t have to worry about the smell anymore. I questioned why police would have to come over a few small animals dying, but assumed it must have just been a really bad infestation. It certainly smelled like it. When I went to check outside, the white SUV was gone. Maybe it was just an undercover police car. 

We didn’t bother moving all the furniture back into my room. We sold the house and moved into a small unit across Clearwater, about an hour away from our old house. Despite my night terrors entirely stopping, things only got worse. Our unit was incredibly cramped and I never got away from my mother. There was only one bedroom. She tormented me. The unit was covered in security cameras, and the door had five locks on it. My mother kept tabs on my location at all times, and never let me leave the house alone unless it was for school. 

It was like that for a long time. I never told her the truth about what Noah and I had done to lead to the photos. I didn’t trust her anymore. My mother’s paranoia consumed her entirely, and it was suffocating both of us. 

It was two years later when I finally got any sign that Noah had existed at all. I had escaped to the shopping centre after school, and knew it was only a matter of time before my mother drove over and chastised me for not coming straight home. That’s when I saw him in the parking lot, leaning against his Dodge on the phone to someone- Charlie Baker. Noah’s older brother. It was like seeing a ghost. 

When he saw me, his eyes lit up. He hung up the phone and almost ran to me, sweeping me into a hug. It was a bit of an extreme reaction, Charlie had barely said two words to me in all the time I’d spent at their house. But it’s not like I wasn’t happy to see him. 

“What are you doing here?” I asked. He was vastly different from the last time I’d seen him. His hair was long and he was covered in piercings and tattoos. I wouldn’t have recognised him if he didn’t look so much like Noah. 

“Just visiting the family. I’m surprised you’re still here, Jonesy,” he said, messing up my hair affectionately. 

“Your family? Don’t they live in the city now?” I asked. 

Charlie’s eyebrow quirked. “No, just me. They were gonna move there. Then, well. You know,” Charlie said, his mood sobering. 

My mouth ran dry. Noah had never left Clearwater. Neither had his family. They’d been here the whole time. “Before what?”

Charlie’s eyes widened. It was as if he was trying to decipher if I was kidding. “Jonesy, she never told you?”

He explained everything to me in the gentlest way he could, but there was nothing gentle about his words. My world was collapsing. It took everything I had within me not to crumble into the parking lot and never get up. Everything I’d come to know over the past two years had been nothing but a facade. 

Noah Baker was found dead the night the police came to my house. His decomposed body was found in the crawlspace, directly under my bedroom. He had been asphyxiated so badly that his windpipe had caved in on itself and one of his eyes had popped out of his skull from the pressure. His autopsy revealed something worse, though. He hadn’t died a virgin. 

After his death, they’d found messages on his phone to a number that Noah’s parents didn’t recognise. Noah would ask for cigarettes and money, then a few minutes later he’d send a photo of himself. Charlie didn’t tell me what the photos contained. I could’ve guessed. 

Charlie was holding my shoulders when he told me, then wrapped me into another hug when he was done. I collapsed into him, but I could barely feel his skin against mine. Everything was numb. 

Charlie bought me a drink from the gas station before he left and gave me his number, telling me I could call him anytime. I thanked him and watched his Dodge disappear out of view as I sat with my back to the wall of the shopping centre. The sun was disappearing behind the smoke stacks, painting Clearwater golden. Noah was buried here, somewhere. And I’d never even visited him. I’d never even told his parents how sorry I was. I’d never gotten to tell them the truth. Maybe they could’ve caught the guy if they knew. There could’ve been a semblance of justice for what happened to my best friend. 

When my mother’s car finally whipped into the parking lot, she stomped towards me and started with her usual ‘where were you? I called you fifty times. You 
 scared me to death.’

“Fuck you,” I said, standing on my aching legs. There were only a handful of times in my life I had seen my mother speechless. This was one of them. 

She knew instantly. How could she not? She must’ve known I’d find out eventually. Or maybe she thought she could keep me in the dark forever. I’ll never know what her plans were. 

It took a long time for her to convince me to come back home. She was breaking down crying by the time we got in the car. She swore she’d only ever done it to protect me. She knew how much Noah meant to me, and she was going to tell me eventually when I was ready. She just didn’t think I’d be able to handle it. I was almost blind with rage and shut myself in the bedroom when we got home. My mother’s pleas for me to come out of the bedroom fell on deaf ears all night. 

The world had robbed me of the greatest friend I’d ever had, maybe the only friend I’d ever make. Then my mother had robbed me of two years worth of grieving. 

I stopped going to school. I visited Noah’s grave a week later. It wasn’t real to me until then. Until it was much too real. I couldn’t bare to be there for more than a few minutes. I left the Spiderman action figure with a missing leg by his tombstone. 

I don’t think the world will ever give me answers. I’m not that lucky and I’ll die with my questions. Who Anonymous was, and why he had robbed me of the best thing I’d ever known. Most of all, I’ll never know why it was him. I’ll spend every minute of the rest of my life wishing it was me instead. 

Soon after my conversation with Charlie, I swallowed all the pills in our bathroom cupboard. I’m still not sure if I’m glad it didn’t work. 

I’m writing this from my psych ward room. The three year anniversary of Noah’s death is tomorrow. My psychologist said last week that  I’ve been improving a lot lately. With the amount of meds I’m on, I could be ready to reunite with civilisation soon. 

Due to Clearwater only having one hospital, and not a great one at that, the psych wards I’ve been sent to have been in the city. Charlie visits me on the days he’s not working, and we talk about Noah a lot. The city is everything he dreamt it would be. He would’ve fallen in love with it. Even from the windows of my room, I can picture him skating down the streets weaving in and out of the swarm of people. If I stare long enough, it feels like he’s really there. It’ll always haunt me what I could’ve done differently to make that a reality. That’s what plagues me most of all. 

The city is much too crowded for me, though, so I’m not too upset about leaving. I’ll miss Charlie, but he promised he’d drive inland to see me at least once a month. I haven’t seen my mother for the better part of a year. A lot of my therapy work has involved getting over how much I resent her. I know now that she was just a mother, terrified for her child’s life. Terrified I’d have the same fate as Noah. But I don’t think that rift between us will ever be mended. She will never be my mother again. 

In all of my countless therapy sessions, I’ve never once told any of them about Anonymous. It was the one thing I still had tying me to Noah. The things we shared will be ours and ours alone until the day I die. Memories are all I have left of him. I won’t let them be desecrated. 

Sometimes I wonder where Anonymous is. If he left Clearwater or if he’s still there, lurking under floorboards and outside of windows. Every time I get an alert that someone has gone missing in Clearwater, my thoughts rush to him. Maybe I’ll have to make my peace with never knowing who the monster that took my best friend from me is. Or maybe not. 

My mother signed the release papers today. I’ll be back in Clearwater tomorrow.
