I run a private campground.  I have a set of rules to ensure everyone stays safe and on Halloween, I failed to do my part to protect people from the dangers of my campground.  [I went trick-or-treating with the man with the skull cup.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/dqb5zm/how_to_survive_camping_i_went_trickortreating/)  Now I have to deal with the consequences of that decision.  If you’re wondering about the significance of the rules, you can start at the beginning with [this handy link](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/clp5h4/how_to_survive_camping/).

We keep the deaths and injuries that happen on our campsite quiet from the outside world largely through the cooperation of the local police.  The campground falls within the jurisdiction of one of the few towns that sits nearby and they’re the ones that respond whenever something happens.  They don’t come by to arrest or prosecute anyone.  They bring paperwork and assurances for any out-of-town campers that something will be done.  Then I bury the bodies and they make up some story and we continue on as if nothing unnatural has happened.

Perhaps this is wrong of us.  What else can we do, however?  Our legal system makes no allowances for things that are not human and so forces us into a lie.

Our relationship with local law enforcement was formalized shortly after my grandfather took possession of the campground.  I’ve mentioned the “scandal” that drove my great-aunt out of ownership before.  It’s a little more complicated than simply a child out of wedlock.  We’re not certain at what point our land transitioned to being old land, as it happened gradually.  There have always been strange things in this world and our town was not without its troubles.  It wasn’t until someone sat down and looked at all the reported incidents and saw the concentration on our land that everyone put it together.

The locals began to say that we should break up our land and sell it.  We weren’t putting it to good use, after all, except to collect monsters.  Back then, it wasn’t *really* a campground, not like it is now.  They opened up some land to campers, but it wasn’t the sole usage of the land.  Rather, we owned the land just to own it.  My family was among the first settlers of this area and had significant holdings.

One of the reasons we dedicated ourselves fully to running a campground was because it altered the local perception of the family.  We weren’t entitled, elitist landholders anymore.  We had an honest living.

But at the time of my great-aunt, we had that against us still.  Then she showed up with a baby.  She tried to keep it quiet but word got out and rumors started churning through town.  Having a child out of wedlock was one, of course, but there was another, more dangerous, rumor that began to spread.  They said the child was a changeling.  And Bryan’s ancestors were among the most vocal proponents of that rumor, on account of their heritage.

Great-aunt decided to turn her enemies into her allies.  She went to them, with the child, and let them inspect the baby.  And she told them the real story and the identity of the father.

Great-aunt took that secret to the grave.  So did Bryan’s grandparents.

I don’t think there was anything *unnatural* about the father.  Bryan’s grandparents would not have been swayed to great-aunt’s side otherwise.  I think it was local politics.  Someone influential.  Possibly an affair.  My great-aunt must have liked him quite a bit to not drag him down with her.

The campground was transferred to my grandfather to make the town happy.  It settled most of the grumbling.  Great-aunt could step out of the public eye to raise her confirmed not-a-changeling baby in peace.  The transition to my grandfather let people believe that now that the land had changed hands, the monsters wouldn’t keep showing up.

They were naive.  My family, less so, but we had bought ourselves some time to recover from the scandal.

Then something started robbing the graveyard.

My uncle liked to tell this story.  He was twelve years old at the time.  My father was fourteen.  Dad doesn’t like to talk about this because I think he pitied the things he killed.  He had a soft heart.  Even though it was necessary, he didn’t like to kill things simply because they were acting on their nature.  He didn’t like killing *anything*.  In this, at least, I take after my mother.

The first handful of graves were quickly discovered by the groundskeeper and he buried them again, telling their relatives nothing.  Not about the holes, the disturbed headstones, and certainly nothing about the shattered coffins and the missing bodies.  He understood that these things happened and it was best to not upset people unnecessarily.

The first grave theft that was discovered by the town was when one of the local families made their routine Sunday trip to the cemetery to leave flowers on a relative’s grave.  He’d died unexpectedly, possibly from a heart attack.  The story that went around is that on the day of the theft, the mom thought that something was strange because there was loose dirt strewn all around the cemetery as they were approaching the gravesite.  She believed at first that maybe the groundskeeper was doing some maintenance but told the children to stay back.  She had a bad feeling, she said.

The grave had been partially dug up.  A hole that exposed half the coffin, dug in a slope like a dog digs, kicking the loose soil all across the ground around the grave.  The coffin itself was shattered, the wood splintered and snapped apart, exposing the dark hollow of the coffin inside.

Then one of the children shrieked, coming across a human skull, and the mother ran to them and told them they were leaving.  The skull was fake, she said.  It was just someone’s idea of a bad prank.  She knew.  She could tell it was a fake skull.

In her heart, she knew the truth, but this little lie at least distracted the children until they were old enough to handle the reality that something had dug up their father’s grave and devoured all  of it but the skull and a few ribs that had fallen into the grass when it cracked the sternum free.

Perhaps it would have ended there, if the oldest of the boys hadn’t climbed out the window when he and his brother heard their father’s voice calling to them from outside.  The boy, too, was devoured.

The mother blamed our campsite.  We aren’t *that* far from the cemetery, as it was placed on the outskirts of town and we’re not *much* further than that.  She also needed someone to blame, I suspect, and we were still at that time an easy target.  A town meeting was held.  The issue of whether our land should be split up and sold was opened once more.  Grandfather went to the meeting - the entire family went to the meeting.  They stood in the back, silent and watching, and perhaps this was deliberate.  To remind the town of just how long my family has been around and how many of us there actually are.  To remind them of how hard our eyes are, the grim set of our silent stares, the strength of our will.

Grandfather told the town that our family would take care of this creature, regardless of whether it came from our land or not.  We weren’t the only ones whose land harbored strange things, he said.  We *were*, however, the ones that had the resolve to *deal* with the things it attracted.  And let them come to our land, he continued.  We - none of them - could keep the things *out*.  They all knew someone that suffered dead livestock, strange claw marks on doors, apparitions and visions without explanation.  We would do this, and more, if they at least had the courtesy to treat us with respect.

Then he walked out without even giving them a chance to respond.  The meeting continued but without the family there it felt hollow, lacking in purpose, and if any decision was reached no one remembers what it was.

Grandmother set to the work of turning our land into a proper campground and opening it up fully to the public.  The more campers we brought in, they reasoned, the more money they’d spend on the local economy.  Certain goods wouldn’t be available on site.  Food, for instance.  The general store’s supplies were kept deliberately lean and maps of local shopping was printed for the main office.  In time, we *would* expand, but not before being certain that our campers would still dump a significant amount into business outside our property.  But at that time, these were all plans for the future.

Grandfather dealt with the more immediate problem of the monster stalking the graveyard.

It was a simple plan for a simple creature.  He and his sons stood watch in the graveyard each night until the monster returned for another body.  My uncle was scared.  He’d never hunted anything more dangerous than rabbits and could only think about how the boy that had been eaten was only a few years younger than him.  Fear tightened around his neck like a noose and the shadows took on life, hunkered under the thin moonlight like malevolent beings, waiting for him to turn his back.  His knuckles were white as he gripped his rifle like a lifeline.  It was an effort to keep his gaze poised on the side of the graveyard he’d been assigned to watch.  Grandpa and my father were at his back, watching the darkness beyond the edge of the faint bubble of light their lantern permitted, and he ran this through his head as a mantra to fan the flames of his dwindling courage.

His father and brother were there.  He’d be safe.

On the third night my uncle fired on something that was moving around the edge of the graveyard.  The gunshot echoed through the night, followed by the rustle of grass as something fled.  Grandpa scolded him for firing.  It was too small, he said.  He probably fired at a groundhog.  Don’t shoot until you’re certain of what you’re shooting at.  Didn’t he remember that, from when he went hunting for rabbits?

And my uncle, embarrassed, swore he wouldn’t make that mistake again.

It almost got my grandpa killed.  But no one held that against my uncle and my uncle, for his part, knew it wasn’t entirely his fault.  He was only twelve, being asked to do something that the grown men of the town wouldn’t do.

He saw it, in the corner of his vision.  A subtle streak of movement, like water flowing along the ground.  Pale, dead flesh.  A trick of the light.  The latter is what he told himself it was, as he forced his fingers to relax their grip on the rifle.  They ached from hours of strain in the cold night air.

It came up just at the edge of his vision, sliding between the tombstones, in a blind spot where none could see it clearly.  It moved like a dog, belly to the ground, the yellowed flesh draped loosely on its bones.  My uncle, so determined to not shoot at shadows again, kept his gaze fixed on the darkness at the edge of the graveyard, searching for something *real,* and missed the faint impression of movement at the edge of his eyesight.

Missed it, until it was almost upon him.

Grandpa didn’t leave his sons entirely on their own.  He watched over them as well as his own third of the graveyard and he saw the ghoul before it could lunge at my uncle.  He stepped between them, raising his shotgun, but the creature was in mid-leap and it hit him squarely in the chest.  My uncle screamed and threw himself backwards.  My grandpa hit the ground hard, the air knocked out of him in a rush, and the creature landed on his chest.  It clawed at his shoulders and his neck until my grandpa got the barrel of the shotgun interposed between them.  The ghoul threw its full weight against the gun, stretching out broken fingernails towards my grandpa’s eyes.

My dad was the one that knocked it off him.  He’d been standing by in agony, unable to find an opening with which to shoot the creature, not without risking hitting my grandpa.  He didn’t trust his aim, not with the two twisting and thrashing on the ground.  The ghoul bobbed like a bird, kicking and clawing, trying to land its teeth in something vital enough to put an end to my grandpa’s resistance.  Then, in a flash of inspiration, he ran around to the side of the combatants and stuck the rifle down and angled the barrel back up into the ribcage of the monster.  It froze for a second, but it was too late, and my father pulled the trigger.

The bullet ripped through its chest and exited up and out.  The force of the gunshot threw it off my grandpa and it landed just a few feet away, directly at my uncle’s feet.  My uncle stood frozen, clutching his rifle to his chest.  It seemed pathetic, rolling on the torn grass in front of him, its skin rippling as it convulsed in pain from its injuries.  Its cries were like that of a cat, whimpering and mewling.

It raised its head and stared up at my uncle.  Its lips were peeled back from a row of perfect white teeth, its eyes were bright, and its face was familiar.  He’d met this man before, in the grocery store when my grandma took him on her errands.  While he was still alive, before he died of a heart attack and was buried and before the ghoul dug him up and ate what scraps of flesh remained on his bones.

My uncle couldn’t move.  He couldn’t think, he couldn’t breathe.  The human face staring up at him with mindless hate in its eyes robbed him of all reason.

Then grandpa got to his feet and limped over.  He shot its legs and then caved it skull in with the stock of the gun.  He didn’t stop until its head was a mess of battered tissue, a gelatinous heap the consistency of cold oatmeal.

My uncle said that he didn’t hesitate after that.  These things were monsters, he realized, regardless of whose face they wore.  He taught his children the same and they were the ones that went hunting when we had something on our campsite that *could* be hunted.

After the ghoul was dispatched my grandpa went back to the town hall and told them the problem was dealt with.  If we had the cooperation of the town, he said, and especially the police then we could continue to deal with these things.  We could keep our old land as old land and all those *things* out there would flock to it and with nowhere else to go, they’d be trapped.  Contained.  And everyone else would be safe.

This is the arrangement we have with the town.  I wonder how many of our campground inhabitants are here by choice, how many are here because they have nowhere else they can survive, and how many we’ve compelled to stay.

I need to find out if anything falls in the last category.  It’s not something I’ve ever considered before, but I feel it will soon be very important to know this.

Every now and then the town starts to forget the dangers and question if our role is necessary.  My parents were called to the town hall three times in their tenure as owners of the campground.  They were polite and diplomatic, but also firm.  The campground would remain in our hands.  It would remain old land.  Didn’t they realize what would happen, were we to displace our inhabitants?  They would go to the farms and the houses and the town would have to deal with something far worse than whatever had temporarily slipped out of our grasp.

Now it was my turn to stand before the town.  I said all this and perhaps I wasn’t as eloquent as my mother and perhaps I have too much of my father’s anger in me, but for a brief moment I thought I had convinced them.  A sea of bobbing heads stared up at me, nodding faintly as they remembered that things could be so much worse than a few people being poisoned on Halloween.  The sheriff stood near the back, arms crossed, his scowl deepening as I talked.

I thought that my parents would be proud of me, were they still alive.  Here I was, defending our family line.

I was so close.

Then, as I finished talking, a man I didn’t immediately recognize stumbled in through the doors of the town hall.  They creaked on their hinges and a hush fell over the room.  His footsteps lilted, one landing more heavily than the other, and it was like listening to a bell toll as each step landed, the dragging foot whispering on the wooden floor like a trailing rope.  His expression was distant, his eyes cast upwards towards the heavens, and his mouth hung slightly agape.

His arms swung loosely at his sides and one hand clutched the hair of my uncle’s severed head.  He threw this, when he was halfway down the aisle, and it rolled across the floor and came to a stop at my feet.  Then the stranger fell face-down onto the ground and has yet to regain consciousness.

The doctors at the local hospital do not think that he will ever wake up again.  They are less complicit than the police, but they understand my campground.  They are familiar with the casualties it produces.  At some point they will have to contact the man’s family and tell them where he is and that he won’t wake up.  There will be no mention of murder.  It’s one kindness the police can afford for the man’s family.

We *do* have contact information for his relatives.  I found it.  For while the people in the town hall panicked and screamed or wept I stood there, silent and still, staring down at my uncle’s face that was frozen into an expression of mute surprise.  I thought about the stranger and wondered why he seemed familiar.  I thought on this for a long time, even while a police officer (and I don’t recall who, which is strange because I know them all) took me by the arm and led me away and took me back to the campground.

In my office I went through my records until I found the name that felt familiar.

The stranger has camped here every year for almost twenty years.  He’s one of my regulars.  I had his registration from last year on file, including his emergency contact.

I remember something else.  The man’s shadow, as I walked past his prone body.  How the edges were tattered.  Fraying, like an old scrap of cloth.  I’m not sure anyone else noticed.

My uncle was murdered on the campgrounds.  The staff report that the man came by, asking for me, and my uncle said he’d talk to him instead as I wasn’t around.  They heard a gunshot and by the time they arrived at the scene, the man was gone and my uncle’s head was gone with him.

The town reconvened their meeting a few days later.  I was not present.  I don’t recall if I was invited or not and it doesn’t seem to matter right now.  Very little feels like it matters.  The funeral for my uncle is this weekend.  I feel like that day is endlessly far away, or perhaps it has already happened and this is merely an echo.  I’m struggling to understand *when* I am at any given moment.  This is shock, I suppose.  I tell myself it will pass.

The sheriff stopped by this morning.  I didn’t talk much.  I’m very tired.  I haven’t been sleeping much.  He said that the town was out of patience and needed proof that we could do what we claimed - that our campground being old land actually did contain the various *other* creatures in this world, rather than act as a beacon to bring them in and let them prey on the innocent.

(I know the secrets of this town.  Few of us are innocent)

Look what happened to my uncle, he continued, and I lost what else he said after that.  Hatred boiled inside me and it took all of my focus to contain it.  It coursed through my veins like molten iron.  How *dare* he use my uncle’s death against me.

Christmas is coming, he was saying, when I was able to register his words again.  Yule.  Midwinter.  12th Night.  There would be no deaths - no *incidents* \- during this time.  Think of it as a test, he said and he smiled when he spoke.  A trial to regain the town’s confidence.

It is nothing more than a pretense.  I do not think this it is possible to do as they request.  The powers of this world converge in the winter and ancients walk the land and they go where they will and they do as they want.

I need to find out why the sheriff is so determined to destroy my campground.  I need to find out how long this has been going on and who else is involved.  And I need to find out how long the sheriff has been working with one of my camp’s occupants and who exactly is the master in that relationship.

You see, while there are many creatures on my campsite that can influence a person’s behavior - perhaps even driving them to murder - there is only one that does so by eating their victim’s shadow.

Rule #17 - Be wary of a friendly man that may approach you in shaded areas. Try to convince him to move into the sunlight. If he casts a shadow, you can assume it’s another camper and proceed accordingly. Otherwise, end the conversation immediately. He is trying to earn your trust.

I’m a campground manager.  I can’t protect everyone, not even the members of my own family.  This doesn’t mean I’m going to stop trying, however.  I’ll use whatever means are available to me.  Most of the time, this means providing people with a list and more recently, telling you about what happens to the people that don’t follow the rules, so you understand the importance of them.

One of my campers didn’t follow the rules.  He allowed the man with no shadow to befriend him and now my uncle is dead.

We haven’t contacted the camper’s kin yet.  We don’t *have* to.  No one knows he’s here.  People vanish all the time.  I think I will go to the hospital and ask if I could have something of his.  He’s not going to come out of his coma so I believe they will give me what I want.  They don’t have to endure the hassle of keeping him on life support if he doesn’t have a head anymore, after all.
