I sleep in the basement of a 1 story house out in the country. Never seen or heard anything unexplainable until out of nowhere weird noises could be heard outside our house.

About 3 years ago now the first noises were heard by both me and my mom. We had let the dog out around 12 at night and we’re letting him back in and talking when we heard a sound that no animal could make. It sounded like a large cat that had its throat slit it was like a gargling meow. We both immediately stopped talking and looked outside to see if there was anything just outside because that’s where it sounded like it was coming from just beyond where our houses lights could reach but we saw nothing. It was like something just letting you know it’s there then not doing anything or making another sound.

The next incident happened a couple months after when I was sleeping outside my room since I didn’t have a bed at the time and the futon couldn’t fit through my doorway. It was late at night I was watching tv and I heard what sounded like someone moving stuff around just outside my laundry room. The layout of my basement is pretty open so from where I was laying I could see almost everything in the basement except the laundry room and another open area at the bottom of the stairs so I thought someone might’ve come down to get something from the fridge or freezer so I just went back to watching tv. A couple seconds later I heard someone walking around bare foot and since the floor is concrete you can hear it pretty clearly so I sat up and thought someone was gonna turn the corner but then the walking turned into a full sprint and that’s when it happened I watched as the footsteps ran past in front of me but nobody was there. They disappeared into our unfinished bathroom and stopped instantly and when I say instantly I mean no slow down in the footsteps just an abrupt stop. My dog used to sleep in that bathroom but after that he wouldn’t even come downstairs.

After that I had my first and last sleep paralysis episode where I heard the same footsteps before a pitch black person on all fours crawled at me and got right in my face before disappearing under the futon.

The final incident happened probably 3 or 4 months later when I was finally back in my room. I was laying in bed when I heard those footsteps again but it sounded like they were running around aimlessly. After a good minute of this they stopped in front of my door and it went quiet but only for a few seconds before my doorknob began to jiggle back and forth. I’ve never had that sense of dread ever in my life and I’ve never been so scared. I ran to my door grabbed the knob and sat with my back up against the door and my feet pushing against the wall opposite. I even looked under the door and there was nothing there. I probably sat there for 30 minutes before I got the courage to move and throughout those 30 minutes I kept looking under the door. I slept with a steel bar that night.

Since that night nothing major has happened but sometimes when I come back into my room and close the door I’ll turn around and my door will be open again.
