[\[Part 31\]](https://www.reddit.com/user/RandomAppalachian468/comments/1ikf92w/the_call_of_the_breach_part_31/)

“We keep our search simple and methodical.” Standing before a massive white sheet hung from the rafters of the hanger, Chris angled a wooden pointer at the map projected onto it by the electronics provided by ELSAR. “We have two locations to search, both within twelve miles of each other. As soon as we get a hit with the beacon, Hannah and the scouts move in to try and find the entrance. Once it’s located, we all go in together.”

Our forces had converged in one of the cavernous hangers at Barron County’s only airport, which had been greatly expanded by ELSAR during the occupation. Everyone assigned to go into the Breach was here, seated in long rows of metal folding chairs like some kind of bizarre high school graduation, ELSAR special forces on one side, coalition troops on the other. There were close to 150 of us in total, with over a dozen heavy armored vehicles, some small mobile mortars, and enough ammunition stacked in the trucks to melt every rifle we had. Those who wanted to had been able to get brand new ELSAR-made M4 carbines, and had been sighting them in all day at the range in Black Oak University, a noisy but necessary process. I’d opted to keep my Type 9, as it was like a part of myself at this point, and ELSAR had flown in plenty of 9mm rounds anyway. However I did take up the offer of borrowing some armor from an Ark River girl who wasn’t going in, the steel plate cuirass worn under my chest rig for extra protection. Vecitorak’s mutants didn’t use bullets, but they did have spears, arrows, and edged weapons, so a little metal could go a long way. Chris wore a similar setup, a blend of the green coalition uniform jacket with the camouflage-painted medieval armor over it so that he vaguely resembled a lost knight who had somehow stumbled into World War One. I had to admit, it was a good look for him, dashing enough that it had drawn a few wandering eyes from the handful of female coalition soldiers in the hanger.

*Look all you want girls, but he’s mine.*

From where I stood off to one side, I rubbed an appreciative hand across my neck and let my mind drift back to the few lovely hours Chris and I had spent together. With tradition now firmly on our side, Chris proved to be a voracious yet gentle lover, and I found that I could barely keep up with him at times. Admittedly, I’d come out sore in ways I hadn’t anticipated, but the ‘learning process’ had been smoother than expected, and I relished the mild aching for what it meant. There was something indescribable in being connected to Chris in this new way, as if the two of us were privy to a secret joke no one else would ever know, one that made our eyes light up like giddy children every time we looked at one another.

However, now that evening wore on to dreaded night, it became a melancholy sensation. I wanted nothing more than to go back to bed with my husband, to pour myself into the fires of a passion I had never dreamed possible in all my years being single, but I knew where we were going. Even if ten thousand of us marched down that cursed road, not all would come out the other side. Thinking of that, imagining the rest of my life alone, without Chris’s tender caress or loving whisper made me want to be sick, but I held myself in check as the brief continued.

“And we didn’t go three hours ago when it was still daylight because . . ?” One of the mercenary NCOs in the front row asked with a cynical raised eyebrow.

Standing to the opposite side of the stage, Colonel Riken didn’t interrupt his men, a policy of innate trust I’d noted amongst these particular soldiers. They were supposedly the elite forces of ELSAR’s contingent deployed to the Barron County project, all former Army Rangers, Navy Seals, or Marine Scout Recon. Unlike other regular units, these men were given much more leeway in how they interacted with their officers and subordinates, the NCO’s treated like kings for their knowledge and experience in past conflicts. All were seasoned veterans, many with tours in both Iraq and Afghanistan, along with scars to prove it. Colonel Riken talked to them like a father might to his adult sons, without any of the barking condescension I’d noticed in the Organ officers or even a few of the regular foot soldiers. In return, the mercenaries seemed to worship the ground he walked on, his callsign whispered among them like the reverent name of some astral demi-god; Primarch.

At the soldier’s question, Chris nodded to me, and I swallowed a nervous lump in my throat as I climbed the steps to join him on stage. Part of me expected the grizzled fighters to roll their eyes at a scrawny girl coming to explain their next moves, but they simply waited in expectant silence, all eyes on me.

Resisting the urge to scratch at a loose string in my uniform collar, I faced the hanger full of people and cleared my throat. “I’m Captain Brun, Head Ranger of the coalition ground forces. As to your question, all sources we have indicate the Breach only opens at night, shrouded with intense electrical stormfronts. It works in a sort of toll system, like a theme park, only you have to pay to leave, not get in. You have to give up something valuable to you, something you can’t replace, like a family heirloom or personal trinket. In some instances . . .”

I paused, hearing again the thunder in my mind, memories not my own, and remembered the words from Madison’s account.

*It’s only a matter of time before the Big One takes more innocent people.*

“. . . in some instances,” Blinking away a bout of dizziness, I steadied myself and continued. “body parts or a life can even be exchanged for safe passage out. But that’s only if they mean something to whoever is leaving them behind. That’s the point; the sacrifice has to be important to you, or it won’t work. Did everyone bring a personal item as directed?”

Nods flashed around the hanger, the men digging into their pockets to retrieve various small things like watches, wedding rings, pictures, etc.

“What happens if we don’t leave anything?” One of the mercenaries gripped a small knit doll that looked as though it had been made for a child, perhaps a son or daughter.

My lips formed into a grim line, and I hated what I had to say, but knew no other way to do so. “Then you won’t leave. According to our intelligence, if anyone stays too long inside the Breach they start to mutate, until they lose everything they once were. The only instances of non-mutation seem to be the hostages taken by our main enemy, which means they have some way of preventing the process from happening. Unless there are any further questions, I’ll turn the main brief over to Colonel Riken.”

Arms folded across his chest, Colonel Riken stepped forward to examine his men with a patient impassiveness. “We have multiple objectives once inside the target zone. First is to locate and secure a section of high ground to use for our liminal detection beacon system to ensure proper signal strength. Second is the elimination of the enemy leader named Vecitorak. Third is the recovery of multiple civilian hostages within a cluster of old mining buildings about a mile or so into the zone. Expect heavy contact upon initial entry.”

One of the junior officers in the front raised his eyes from the compact notebook he was writing in. “I don’t suppose we’ve got any artillery or air support?”

At that, Colonel Riken granted the lieutenant a slight nod of approval. “I managed to get the suits to fly in four Abrams this afternoon. While the beacon has been specially designed to withstand extreme radiation and electromagnetic frequency, there’s no guarantee our comms will work once we’re inside the Breach, and we can’t risk any aircraft in the zone. Our coalition partners have agreed to rig up some of their trucks with mortars, but that’s as good as it gets. So, if you’ve got grenade launchers or rocket tubes, bring extra rounds. Hell, bring *all* the rounds if you can find space for them. I want every rifleman carrying a minimum of 360 rounds on their kit, and double the belts for our gunners. We’re going to need it.”

Mute glances and whispers between the mercs told me this answer hadn’t been what they hoped for, but none dared grumble aloud in the presence of their esteemed commanding officer.

I turned my head to peer out at the long tarmac of Black Oak airport, where the chinooks were still unloading more aid, and a row of four main battle tanks sat next to our ASVs, like prehistoric behemoths of steel. Had anyone showed such machines to the old Hannah, she would have thought nothing could withstand them, but I knew better.

*We could have a battalion of tanks, and I wouldn’t feel safe doing this.*

At Riken’s silence, Chris stepped back in. “Our hostages should be in the same vicinity as the beacon setup point. Once we recover them, I honestly don’t know what physical condition they will be in. We’ll need a medivac standing by.”

“Gonna have to be ground.” One of the mercenary officers tapped his boot on the floor in though, and I noticed a patch with wings on his uniform, demarking an experienced pilot. “If we can’t get any air assets that close in, it’ll mean a half hour drive back here at least, and that goes through the north central plain. There’s some big freaks there, flying ones, and they always go for our choppers if we fly too low.”

“Osage Wyvern.” Chris let slide a cynical grin of recognition. “We’ll send teams of our men who aren’t going to cover the supply routes. We should be able to scare anything big off with a few rockets or a heavy machine gun.”

“If we push hard and fast, the Abrams can get us close.” Riken pointed to the map and traced the route as he directed his men. “We can load some heavy ordinance on our MRAV’s and the coalition ASV’s have the 90 mm guns. Between those, we should be able to handle anything that comes at us.”

“And what of the Oak Walker?” From the seats of our coalition, Adam stood up in his full battle armor, long cruciform sword at his side.

Everyone looked to me, and I fought a racing heart.

*If only they knew how little I knew . . . yikes, this could get ugly.*

“Once we take out Vecitorak, it shouldn’t be an issue.” I gestured to Chris and did my best to appear confident before the troops. “Our team will be handling that. If worst comes to worst, intel suggests the Oak Walker doesn’t like fire, so hit it with everything you’ve got.”

“You all have the new headsets command sent down?” Riken eyed the group, and everyone in the task force reached down to pull plastic bags from under their seats, with black metal objects inside them. They looked like headbands but with a square battery compartment attached, and a soft cloth lining to keep them from digging into our scalps. ELSAR had flown them in less than an hour ago, the helicopters moving back and forth from the county line in an unending procession to keep aid flowing.

Opening his own packet, Colonel Riken held up the headband device so everyone could see. “These are special-made rush orders from our technicians in the high command. Per intelligence provided by our coalition partners, we have reason to belief the enemy can use a type of psychic force to manipulate human brain activity. These interrupters should put out a mild electronic field to jam such forces, so you will wear them at all times until we have exited the mission zone. Understood?”

Curious, I turned my own interrupter over in both hands, noting the workmanship on something ELSAR considered ‘rushed’.

*Like my old doggy-beeper, but worth a small fortune. I can see why ELSAR gets so cocky. If I had the budget to just whip up stuff like this on short notice, I’d probably want to rule the world too.*

“Alright then, platoon commanders take charge of your platoons and await final orders. Dismissed.” Chris waved them off, the hanger rumbling with scraping chairs and boots on cement as we all surged for the tarmac.

We made our way to the column of armored vehicles, where those who were going climbed into the waiting ELSAR-made MRAV armored trucks or our captured ASV’s. The air tased of diesel exhaust, and it had dropped several degrees from the afternoon. Drifting from the thin clouds, the snowfall was light, which was good for road conditions, but it meant we had to give extra care to our weapons to ensure they didn’t jam from the cold. I could see my breath in the air as we walked, Chris and I side-by-side down the line of trucks.

One of the ELSAR sergeants looked up from adjusting his plate carrier, and as our eyes met, it hit me that I recognized him.

“Hey.” I stammered out, and slowed to a halt beside his truck, Chris waiting behind me.

“Well, I’ll be damned.” His eyes widened with measured surprise, and the sergeant looked me up and down with a chuckle. “I thought I recognized you on that stage. Looking a lot better than last time we met.”

I smiled, remembering the man from the ELSAR team that brought me into their hospital after Jamie handed me over. He was kind to me upon noticing how sick I had been, even carried me to the gurney before the surgery that saved my life, and it tempered my negative view on ELSAR’s regular soldiers to a degree. True, that surgery had been the most traumatic and painful experience of my life, but it wasn’t the sergeant’s fault. He’d gone beyond his orders to treat me like a human being, and had even expressed remorse at my condition, which was more than any of the Organs could say. It was yet another reminder that, in another life, this man had likely been a hero of the American military, a defender of the nation I once called home, someone I would have cheered for in a parade. We had only ended up on opposing sides of this war due to men like Koranti, who viewed his hired guns with the same expendable mindset as he did the civilians of Barron County.

*With the way Riken spoke of his boss, perhaps that won’t be for much longer.*

“I’ll feel even better once we put this whole ugly mess behind us.” I made a polite nod of my head to the sergeant and his crew. “Then we can finally get things back to normal, or as close as we can, anyway. Hopefully you guys get a nice long vacation after this.”

A wry grin slid across the man’s face, and the sergeant shrugged his shoulders. “Oh, trust us, we plan on it. This place wasn’t the first long-term assignment we had, and some of us haven’t been home in over a year. Rumor has it the colonel is going to fix a nice long furlough for us, somehow. Either way, we’ll be out of your hair soon.”

Thunder boomed in the distant sky, far to the south, towards New Wilderness. Everyone in the tarmac lifted their heads to look that way for a moment, and my chest tightened in nervousness.

“You think we have a chance?” The sergeant surprised me with his question, his face a mask of grave thought. “To stop it, I mean? They wouldn’t be sending so much firepower if this was going to be a surefire thing.”

Pushing a hand into my pocket, I grasped Madison’s necklace and bit my lower lip. “I don’t know.”

We exchanged a brief glance, before parting ways, and I carried on down the line with Chris as the sergeant loaded his men into their armored trucks. It occurred to me that I never caught his name, but then again, I figured it didn’t matter. If we succeeded, hopefully the man could go back to his family and spend a long time enjoying whatever backpay Koranti owed him, watching TV and grilling steaks in the detached comfort of our modern world.

As we made our way into the section of the convoy that made up our forces, I spotted a golden-haired figure in heated debate with Adam and couldn’t help but overhear the words she flung at him like a storm of arrows.

“I belong with you! It’s not right! This is a fight for all our people, you can’t just shunt me aside!” Eve wore her battle armor, but her face was red with a mixture of anger and disappointment, enough that I could guess the cause of their quarrel without needing Adam’s response.

“I have never shunted you aside for anything, *amica mea*.” Adam had his arms crossed, but I could see the hurt and guilt on his face, as if Eve’s fury was enough to sap all the strength from him. “But this is not a task I want to share with you. Our fate is uncertain, which mean you must remain here, to lead the others if I don’t return.”

Tears brimmed Eve’s golden eyes, and she balled her fists at her sides enough that I wondered if she would swing at him. They had always been kind, subdued people, resolving things with a patience that I admired. While their various married couples had their flaws, I had yet to hear of a divorce among the Ark River folk, and they rarely spoke to each other in such raised tones. I’d never seen the devoutly religious couple fight before, and it was unnerving to know even they weren’t immune to the stress weighing down on us all.

*Can’t say I blame either of them, at this rate.*

“How could I live with myself if you fell?” Eve half pleaded, half shouted, her nose inches from his as she did so. “Do you think I want to raise our child alone? Our baby deserves a living father, not a golden handprint on the church wall!”

Adam’s patience cracked, and he glared back at her, his voice dropping an octave in warning. “Our baby deserves to *live*. If you go into that abyss, you might be wounded or killed. You will stay, because our child’s life is worth more than anything else.”

“*You* are worth more to me than anything else!” As if set off by his change in temperament, Eve screamed with a rare anger that stunned me, loud enough that others from the surrounding area turned their heads. “I have no one but you! You stupid, prideful fool, if you go in there and get yourself killed I will *hate* you for the rest of my life!”

Her voice broke with sobs at the end of her last sentence, and Adam reached for her. Eve tried to fight him, pounded her fists on his armor, but eventually gave in to bury her face in his neck. I saw tears on Adam’s cheeks, grief etched into his features, as if he truly believed this would be the last time he saw his wife. The thought haunted me, knowing that this was my fault, my doing, my plan.

*If he doesn’t come back, I won’t be able to look her in the face; I couldn’t stand the shame of it.*

“Best keep moving.” A low voice echoed behind Chris and I. “Let raging seas tame themselves. Not our business anyway.”

I turned to find Peter, his dark air covered in a camouflage bandana, a gray Kevlar helmet stuck under one arm. He’d traded most of his pirate attire for one of the combat uniforms ELSAR gave out to anyone who needed it as part of the aid we agreed upon, though there were holdouts that remained from his 18^(th) century costume. Peter’s sword was strapped across his back to poke out above one shoulder instead of swinging by his left hip, and his brace of pistols had been strapped over the chest rig that held his rifle magazines. A long dagger hung from his belt, and Peter still wore a red sash over his gray uniform jacket. He didn’t have any armor like Chris or I but had managed to locate a pair of studded-knuckle gloves somewhere, which he wore on both hands. None of the other pirates were with him; Peter had forbidden any one of them from volunteering as he did. I knew that ordering him not to come would be a waste of time, as the wily buccaneer had a habit of finding his way to wherever he wanted to be regardless of gates, locks, or guards.

Chris grinned at Peter, the three of us trudging to the ASV that would be ours. “Didn’t know swords were standard issue.”

“Someone had to buck the trend.” Peter fished around in one of the voluminous jacket pockets, and produced his notorious flask to down a small gulp. “Besides, the golden hairs carry pikes to the bathroom, so why not a cutlass? Figure I’ll shove it right down Vecitorak’s throat next time I see him.”

Another figure moved out of the shadows between the vehicles to fall into step with us, a scarf wrapped around the steel coalition helmet on her head. She had ditched her ‘borrowed’ suit of Ark River armor, and returned to her old coalition garb, with the patches removed to prevent anyone from looking too closely. A small black duffle bag on one shoulder kept her Kalashnikov out of the way of prying eyes, and she said nothing at our glances, even throwing Peter a mild nod.

*No one will see her in the gun turret, and Peter won’t snitch. That, and once we’re knee-deep in a screaming army of mutants, I doubt anyone will care that Jamie isn’t in the southlands starving to death. I just wish I could have ordered her to stay like Eve.*

Just before we clambered into the narrow confines of our ASV, Chris stopped me a short distance away from the other two. “Hey, um . . . how are you feeling?”

It took me a second to realize what he meant, and my face warmed with a sheet of fire. “You mean since the last time you asked?”

His cheekbones tinged a similar crimson, and I wanted so badly to kiss him. “A man’s supposed to ask. Besides, if the vehicles go down, we might need to do a lot of running in there. Are you sure you’re up for this?”

*Oh wow, you really weren’t kidding about the virgin thing. It’s cute. God on high, I wish we had ten minutes to spare.*

“You didn’t cripple me, Mr. Dekker.” I flashed him an ornery grin, but the wonderful sensation was only momentary as levity gave way to grim reality. “Besides, I’m the only one here who doesn’t really have a choice in the matter. We can’t let Vecitorak win. Either we face this today, or he’ll come after us tomorrow.”

Chris folded his arms and studied his boots with a sigh. “So, what’s *our* plan? Forget Riken, forget the beacon, what’s the move? How do we kill Vecitorak, and pull the hostages without losing anyone?”

Slipping a hand into my pocket again, I took the necklace out to look at it under the airstrip floodlights as they flickered on one-by-one. “This didn’t come to me by accident. The way I see it, it must belong to Madison, which means it might have been her sacrifice that she intended to leave behind once she killed the Oak Walker. Obviously, she never got out, so maybe we can use it to rescue her. Vecitorak’s journal seemed to think that she was tied with the Oak Walker’s spirit or something, so maybe once Madison is free, it will weaken the Oak Walker. Without its strength, Vecitorak will be vulnerable, and we can kill him.”

He looked at me, and Chris’s expression softened. “He’s gunning for you, you know. That freak will pull out all the stops as soon as he knows you’re there. Promise me that if worst comes to worst . . .”

Chris’s eyes flicked to the Mauser pistol on my war belt.

“It won’t come to that.” I reached out to grip his hand, unsure if my lie would convince him more than it did me.

“I hope not.” He tried to smile, but Chris’s fingers tightened on mine. “I’ve gotten used to sharing the blanket. All the same, I’m not letting you out of my sight.”

Like a long steel train, our convoy drove for hours through the darkening countryside, past woods and valleys, down whatever roads were still intact. It was strange, moving without fear of attack from ELSAR, stranger still riding in tandem with their vehicles. We stopped a few times due to the road being washed out, blocked by fallen trees, or rigged with explosives left over by our own insurgency, but soon we found ourselves closing on familiar territory. Dark clouds roiled overhead, and I noticed signs of lighting on the horizon, the breeze frigid with specks of snow. I’d never seen a thunderstorm in the wintertime before, but judging from the greenish-yellow lightning, it wasn’t a normal one.

In the front passenger seat, I checked my map and noted that we’d come to one of my marks on the road. “Stop here.”

At the wheel to my left, Chris pulled the rig over, ours one of the first in the vanguard. As the rest of our column ground to a halt I shoved open the hatch above my head and slithered out into the crisp air.

*Okay, now what?*

Jumping down from the hull of the armored car, I clicked my flashlight on, and wandered around, taking in the lonely stretch of roadway. No matter how much I peered into the darkness, however, nothing seemed to stand out, no sign of anything abnormal. There were weeds in the ditch, tall grass up the side of the embankment, but no secret road, no door the unknown. A part of me worried that we might not be able to find it, that I was too late, or that Vecitorak somehow had more control over the road than I thought and could prevent us from finding it. So much rode on this mission and bathed in the bright glow of dozens of headlights, I felt as if the entire world had its gaze set on me.

My foot slipped on a patch of mud near the roadside, and my boot plunged into the cold water of the drainage ditch.

*‘Strawberry upside down . . .’*

Images flashed through my head, twisted creatures chasing me through the tall grass, multiple voices calling out in distorted, gurgled tones as grimy hands clawed out of the shadows from every side. I tasted the acidic fear, felt her sorrow, her pain, her loss. She had been here, a long time ago, hurt and on the run. All she wanted was to make the anguish stop, and so she had thrown herself over that bank, down the grassy slope, down, down, down into the icy water of the ditch . . .

Blinking, I stepped back from the ditch and sucked in a deep breath to steady myself.

*Where are you, Maddie?*

“See anything?” Chris poked his torso from the driver’s hatch on our ASV, scanning the nearby trees, rifle in hand.

I gulped down the rising anxiety, and my saliva tasted strangely of mud and blood. “We’re close. It’s not here though. Let’s try the next spot.”

Further in plunged our column, soon coming within a few miles of New Wilderness. I remembered these roads, both from my first night in Barron County, and from my numerous patrols as a ranger. In my head, I silently begged whoever was listening to help us find what we were looking for, even as the wind picked up, fresh snowflakes blew across the narrow bulletproof windows of our vehicles, and thunder drummed within the enormous clouds.

*Come on, come on, give me something.*

A flash of jade green caught my eye, and just like that, in my mind I was back in that beat-up gray Honda, clutching my camera in the backseat as Matt and Carla gushed about our new video. “There!”

Our tires screeched on the cracked asphalt of the county road, one of the trucks behind us almost ramming into ours from the abrupt stop. Unphased by the muffled curses over our radio headsets, I stared out the armored truck window, awash in déjà vu.

There it stood, a rusty metal road sign, half hidden by the brush around it, leaning and faded, but still legible. Beyond stretched a long gravel road, straight as an arrow, going on and on into inky blackness. It bore the same increasing snowfall as the rest of the county, but something told me this was no more than a clever front, a ruse, the colors of a chameleon to stay hidden from the birds. There were no tires tracks, no footprints, nothing in the thin layer of white that settled across the even gravel to indicate the road had been used recently, but I knew better. Electric shivers went through me at the sight of the old white painted letters of the sign, and I whispered them to myself as a bolt of lightning split the sky above us.

“Tauerpin Road.”
