***\[Transcript Begins\]***

**Charles:** Alright Mr. Ricci. The tape is rolling. Are you ready to go through it now?

**Ricci:** Y-yes… yeah, I think so.

**Charles:** Alright. Whenever you’re ready. Can you start by giving your name please?

**Ricci:** Matteo. Uh, Matteo Ricci. I do video stuff for the Matthews Brothers, um… least I used to, I guess…

**Charles:** Were you present on the night of June 12th?

**Ricci:** Yes… I… I saw the whole thing. I don’t know how much got filmed. I dropped my camera pretty early on but, maybe there might be something there?

**Charles:** Why don’t you walk me through it. Let’s start at the beginning, alright? Tell me about the Matthews Brothers, and what you were doing in the woods that evening.

**Ricci:** We were filming. Uh… Gavin and Mitch, they did a lot of prank videos, streams. Stuff like that. They got in shit for it a few times, but it pulled in views, got people talking. That’s how you make money. I think they even ended up in a Moist Cr1tikal video at one point? Or maybe it was someone else. I don’t know.  Anyway, we filmed a lot of videos on this one hiking trail. You get a lot of joggers, cyclists and dog walkers passing through, so if you wanna like, set up a fun scare prank, you can do it there.

**Charles:** Scare prank?

**Ricci:** Yeah, it’s like a prank where you scare someone. Those always did pretty well. There’s some pretty heavy forest along the trail, so there’s a lot of places on the trail where you can hide and pop out. Gavin and Mitch always played it up a bit. They’d use costumes, actresses. Stuff like that. 



The whole idea was to go as hard as possible and scare the shit out of whoever was passing by. I remember one time, they got these realistic raptor costumes… like, *super* realistic, with moving heads and articulated tails. And whenever someone would pass by, Mitch would walk out onto the trail in front of them. I’d be in the woods playing these roaring noises on my phone, and while they were trying to make sense of what they were looking at, Gavin would come out behind them. 



Soon as he saw Gavin, Mitch would charge at them, and when they turned around they’d run right into Gavin… people usually lost their minds, started crying, took off into the woods. One guy even pissed himself… *\[Pause\]* 

**Charles:** That’s considered a prank?

**Ricci:** It was funny. We wouldn’t hurt them. I mean, this one lady broke her ankle when she fell off the path, but that was it. She really tried to tear into Gavin but like, he told her to chill out. He said it was just a prank. It wasn’t our fault she freaked out and fell off the trail like that. 

**Charles:** And you did this often… with the raptors?

**Ricci:** I mean, the Raptors was a one time thing. We did lots of other stuff. Clowns, serial killers, fake kidnappings, fake muggings… look I know it sounds bad, but it was just for fun. You know that old comedy show? Just for Laughs? They did these kinds of pranks all the time! It was exactly like that!

**Charles:** Sure… so what was the prank on *that* particular day?

**Ricci:** We were doing like a slasher type thing. We had this one girl we worked with sometimes, Steph, with us. She’d run out of the woods, screaming, covered in fake blood. Then Gavin would come out of the woods after her. He like, had a mask and a machete - it was a prop, like a fake one, and he’d run Steph down and pretend to kill her. Then Mitch would come out and stare down whoever was on the path and he’d be holding his own machete. Then he’d start chasing them. Not too far. Just far enough.

**Charles:** Right… so what exactly happened?

**Ricci:** Well, we were shooting for a bit around dusk. You don’t see as many people around then, so it’s easier to space out the scares. I’d set up a few hidden cameras to film the pranks, but I had a handheld to get the behind the scenes stuff for our YouTube channel too. Things were going pretty good. We’d gotten some solid reactions! It was going good… then Gavin said he needed a minute. 



He was just going to go and take a leak, I mean we were in the woods, so he went a little deeper in to take care of business. We should’ve been able to see him. I mean, I saw him stop by this fallen tree a good maybe… I dunno, fifteen, twenty feet away? I took my eyes off of him cuz Steph was reapplying some fake blood and talking… plus like, I didn’t really need to watch the man pee. And that was the last I saw of him.

**Charles:** I see. How long until you noticed he was missing?

**Ricci:** Five, ten minutes maybe? Mitch said something about it, asked where he’d gone. I told him that Gavin was just over by that tree, but when I looked there was nothing there… so I went over, tried to find him. Fuck…

**Charles:** What did you see?

**Ricci:** Nothing at first. I was calling for him, but I didn’t see him around anywhere… least, not until I saw the shoe.

**Charles:** The shoe?

**Ricci:** I saw a shoe on the ground not too far away. I knew it was his. It was one of those sneakers… y’know, the ones celebrities come out with sometimes? I don’t remember anything else about it. They had this really distinctive tread on the sole though, so I knew it was his. I went over to take a closer look… and that’s when I saw his leg… w-what was left of it, at least… fuck.

**Charles:** Mr. Ricci?

**Ricci:** Just… just gimme a minute. Fuck! There was just this… this piece of his leg sticking out of the shoe. I-I could see the bone… just jutting out of it… and that’s when I noticed the movement in the woods. 

**Charles:** Movement from what?

**Ricci:** I… I don’t… *\[Pause\]* 

**Charles:** Mr. Ricci?

**Ricci:** It was there… standing in the trees. I don’t know how I didn’t notice it sooner. It was getting dark at that time, and it’s body was dark, I guess? It was hard to get a good look at it but I remember the skin had this texture to it, like rock or wood. I guess if you weren’t looking for it, it was easy to miss. There were some feathers on its head… just a few, sort of like a headdress. It wasn’t prominent, but I still remember it. I saw the eyes first. Big orange eyes looking at me from the woods. 



It was low to the ground so they were almost at the same height as me… then I heard it. There was this low humming sound. I could feel it in my chest, like it was making all of my organs shake. It reared up… God… it was tall… so… so fucking tall… 15 feet, maybe? Bigger? I… I don’t know. 



All I know is that its eyes never left me for a moment. Its mouth opened… it wasn’t like you see in the movies. In the movies, it always has an overbite, to show off the teeth. But no… you didn’t see the teeth until it opened its mouth… and I knew it was going to kill me… I knew.

**Charles:** What was going to kill you, Mr. Ricci? I’m sorry, what exactly did you see in the woods?

**Ricci:** Fuck me… fuck… *\[Laughs\]*

**Charles:** Mr. Ricci?

**Ricci:** It was a motherfucking T-rex, Detective. Just like you’d see in a movie only… Christ… this one was standing right in front of me… it moved closer, but it didn’t make a sound as it did. All I heard was that low, hum I could feel in my bones… then Steph… God, Steph… 

**Charles:** She saw you?

**Ricci:** Yeah… she started screaming. The Rex… it just looked over at her, sizing her up. Mitch was right beside her, just frozen. Can’t imagine he knew what to make of this thing either… either way, guess the Rex found them more interesting, cuz that’s who it went after. It let out another low rumble and went after Steph… God…

**Charles:** What happened to Stephanie Hauser?

**Ricci:** It just… one minute she was there and the next… I could hear her screaming in its mouth… in its throat… it just… swallowed her. There was some blood, I think… but she was just gone… fuck… she was just…

**Charles:** What did you do?

**Ricci:** I… I saw Mitch had started running. I did the same. I think… I think that’s when I dropped my camera. I don’t really remember. I just remember looking back and seeing that thing staring at us. Then it started moving. It didn’t make a sound. You would’ve thought it would’ve made a sound when it walked, like in the movies, but there was nothing. It wasn’t even running after us… but it was still catching up. *\[Laughs\]* Fuck me…

**Charles:** How’d you escape?

**Ricci:** There was a creek up ahead, with a little bridge going over it. Not a lot of room under there. Maybe two feet, give or take? Mitch dove right under and I went with him. Barely made it in time… it was right behind us. I could see it standing just at the edge of the bridge. We could hear it sniffing around as it tried to figure out how to get to us… I kept waiting for it to just destroy the bridge. It started nudging it at one point… then suddenly it lost interest. That’s when I heard someone else screaming.

**Charles:** Someone you recognized, or…?

**Ricci:** No. Someone else on the trail, I think. Maybe a jogger or a cyclist? I never saw them. That got the Rex’s attention for a bit though. I saw it move away from the bridge… thought it might eat that poor bastard but…

**Charles:** Mr. Ricci? 

**Ricci:** *\[Silence\]*

**Charles:** Mr. Ricci, what happened?

**Ricci:** There was a clicker. L-like the kind you’d use to train an animal. I heard it… followed by a whistle. Someone *whistled* at that fucking thing, like it was a goddam dog! Whoever we heard screaming? I could hear them running away. The Rex didn’t chase them. It… it wanted *us.*

**Charles:** Are you sure?

**Ricci:** It never left, Detective. I remember at one point, it put its foot on the bridge. You could see the wood sagging under the weight. Mitch started freaking out. He was terrified it was gonna crush us! Maybe it would have. I saw the wood starting to splinter… and that’s when Mitch tried to run. Emphasis on *tried.* 

He panicked… tried to make a break for it. It got him immediately. The moment he was out far enough, it grabbed him. I could hear him screaming… God, the screaming… pain… terror… fear. One of his legs came off. I heard the bone snap and saw it drop into the creek right in front of me. I could still hear him screaming from its gullet. It… *it ate him alive, Detective. It swallowed him fucking whole, and he was still screaming for God only knows how long afterwards.* 

God… oh God… oh God… oh God… I… I don’t know how long it lasted. He went quiet after a little while. I… I don’t know if he suffocated or what, but I was *sure* I was gonna be next. I was *sure* of it…

**Charles:** Clearly you weren’t.

**Ricci:** *\[Laughs\]* Yeah… clearly.

**Charles:** So the… animal… did it leave after attacking Mitchell Matthews?

**Ricci:** No. It was sniffing near the spot where he’d been. Still looking for me. It started pressing down on the bridge again… and I was sure this time it was going to break… but that’s when I heard the clicker again. The Rex just paused, like it was listening. 

Someone whistled, and that was when it left and for a moment, everything was quiet. Then I heard footsteps. Someone walking over the bridge. I saw them step down into the creek… and they spoke to me.

**Charles:** What did they say?

**Ricci:** She said I could come out… that she’d sent *it* away. I didn’t want to… but I didn’t really have much of a choice either. She helped me get out of there… she was smiling the whole time. I recognized her face… she was pretty hard to forget.

**Charles:** You knew her?

**Ricci:** Kinda… you remember the Raptor prank I told you about? She was the one who fell off the trail. I remembered her cuz she’d been this sorta hippie vegan girl look to her. Plastic rimmed glasses, long frizzy brown hair, freckles. She looked at me and just gave me this ear to ear grin. She… she asked me: *“What’s wrong? You’re not scared are you? It’s just a prank!”*

**Charles:** I see…

**Ricci:** I… I didn’t know what to say. I just stood there… looking at Mitch’s severed fucking leg, shaking like a leaf… and she just… she just patted me on the shoulder and walked away like it was no big deal. 

**Charles:** That was it?

**Ricci:** *\[Pause\]* Yeah… yeah, that was it…

**Charles:** I see. So… just to be clear, your official story is that your friends got *‘eaten by a Tyrannosaurus Rex.’* That’s the gist of it, right?

**Ricci:** *It’s not a fucking joke! That* ***THING*** *was in the fucking woods, she fucking sicced it on us! EVERYONES FUCKING DEAD!*

**Charles:** *\[Pause\]* There’s no need to get aggressive, Mr. Ricci.

**Ricci:** *I know what I saw, Detective! I know what I fucking saw!*

**Charles:** Of course… *\[Sigh\]* No further questions at this time.

***Addendum by Dr. Lana Bloom***

*This just gets funnier every time I read it.* 

*Is it coldhearted to not give a damn about the trauma of some prank YouTubers cameraman? Maybe. But they weren’t exactly the most sympathetic people themselves, if you ask me… and besides, I thought they liked dinosaur pranks?*

*Oh well. Mine was funnier.* 

*I’ve taken the liberty of financially compensating Detective Charles for providing this transcript to me, along with any video footage that was obtained during the test. Upon review, you can actually see the animal in the background of a few shots, but it is quite easy to miss. The camouflage works quite well - although I’m sure I can make it even better with future generations.*

*I will admit, I was aware that Dr. Hinton had some doubts about me testing the new product in this fashion. But after my success with the last test, he seemed willing to allow me to proceed and I don’t doubt for a moment that he’ll be satisfied with the results. Not only have I demonstrated the animals capability in the field, but I’ve demonstrated that it can be controlled - which is really half the battle.*

*I really never understood those old movies where the mad scientist or evil general gets ultimately torn apart by their own creation. If they were ACTUALLY smart, they’d have built in failsafes or a way to properly control it… but I digress.*

*The new product has met all expectations.* 

*Now if I could only think of a name…* 

*I know that technically speaking, it’s not a real Tyrannosaurus Rex. It’s just the closest I could biologically come to replicating one. (Although I’d like to think I did quite well, especially with the silenced movement. People don’t realize it, but the latest studies do in fact suggest Tyrannosaurus was a stealthy ambush hunter, and this is backed up by footprints showcasing cushioned pads in their feet).*

*But there really just isn’t a better name for this than… well… Tyrannosaurus Rex. Why mess with a good thing? And I suppose it’s certainly a closer match to the original animal than my Pavoraptors were… those were functionally just movie monsters made manifest. (Alliteration! How fun!)*

*Oh hell. Tyrannosaurus Rex it is! Who’s going to complain about it?*
