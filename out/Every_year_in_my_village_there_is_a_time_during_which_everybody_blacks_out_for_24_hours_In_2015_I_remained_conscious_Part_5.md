Should I just leave? If I do, then, what about Edlynn? She proved quite absent for somebody who promised to keep me safe while I slept. Was that her?

"Edlynn? Edlynn is that you?" I called. The culprit just ignored me and the thumping sounds continued.

Going there without any source of light was not happening. I went back to the kitchen in search of anything useful and only found a matchbox. Disappointed but still determined, I made my way back to the basement entrance. Its darkness contrasted with the flowery setting of Adelaide's house, a fact that watered down my fear and fueled my curiosity about why a florist had a hidden basement. I remember my 13 years old self hoping not to find a giant carnivorous plant in there as I stepped on the staircase.

With the heavy gun still in my hand, I lighted the first match that I immediately dropped because my whole being trembled at the unknown, waiting for me in the depth of Adelaide's basement. I lighted another match and progressed, the thumping sounds getting louder, and I finally reached the end of the staircase after the fifth match. On the wall next to me, I spotted a wooden lever which I pulled, despite knowing there was no electricity. To my surprise, after hearing a clicking sound, the thumping noises stopped, and I saw several wall torches light up to reveal a much more disturbing scenery. 

Multiple dry bones littered the floor, and paintings covered the walls, all leading to a shrine made of countless human skulls above which there was a big representation of Redeye. A few meters away, there was a desk covered with books and notes, as well as four metallic doors each provided with a small and square vision panel. Three of the doors were closed and one was open and broken, revealing the darkness inside one of the rooms.

"Edlynn?" I quietly called, immediately answered with two shining white eyes appearing on the vision panel of one of the closed doors. I gasped and jumped back.

"You're not her." The soul said.

"Who? Who are you?" I asked.

"Please, please! Let me out, please help me before she comes back!"

"Who? Before who comes back?"

"Edlynn. She's crazy! She killed them, she killed them all. She will kill us too if she comes back. She's crazy, can't you see her shrine? Please, let me out! Help me!"

Almost knocked out by such a revelation, I advanced, taking a closer look at the shrine, before I turned to the desk, while the prisoner kept on pressuring me for help. I opened the first book my hand landed on, and was immediately greeted with what resembled witchcraft symbols, ritualistic imagery and instructions.

"Wait! I know that souls like you are super strong. Why didn't you break the door?" I asked.

"Take a closer look boy." He answered.

I approached the metallic door and could see what prevented him from leaving. There was a layer of something viscous that had dried and that was mixed with sea salt.

"She put it everywhere. On the door, the walls, the ceiling, except the floor. I tried to dig but the ground is too strong." The soul said.

"The noises? It was you."

"This nullifies our power upon contact, and it burns. I can't even punch it or kick it. And— I don't have any clothes I can use, and it's cold here please, help me!" He pleaded.

"How do I open this?" I questioned.

"I wouldn't do that." Edlynn suggested behind me.

Terrified, since I have seen her in action before at Mrs Robinson's house, I turned around, handling the gun with both hands and aiming for her head.

"Hey, hey! Easy Terrence. Easy. I don't know what that freak told you, and I understand what it looks like." She spoke, gesturing me to calm down.

"What you waiting for? Kill her, now! Shoot her!" The soul shouted behind me.

"Is this what you guys do?" I asked, gesturing to the shrine with my head while keeping my eyes on Edlynn.

"Don't listen to him Terrence. This is not me. This Adelaide's doing. Her house, remember!" Edlynn said as she started approaching slowly.

"He mentioned your name Edlynn. From what you told me earlier, he can't know Adelaide. You souls don't share our memories. He knows you." I replied.

"Because I was there earlier. I found him trapped here. It's true." She said.

"She will kill us both. Kill her! Shoot!" The prisoner shouted.

"Do not get close, or else...!" I warned, sweating, trembling, and nervous about my next move. My life depended on it.

"Listen, Terrence. We, the souls involved in this, the blackout, we're divided in three groups. Those who are against Redeye, the rebels, like me, the neutrals, who only care about their desires, and those who follow Redeye, the devotees. Flavio, the soul inside that guy behind you, he's one of them. The only thing he wants is to join the others out there." Edlynn revealed, still approaching.

"Kill her before she kills you!" Flavio shouted.

"Edlynn don't come close! Don't make me do this." I spoke, still shaking and slowly stepping back.

"Watch out!" She shouted, pointing at Flavio behind me.

A strong hand seized me by the collar and yanked me towards the metallic door. In absolute panic, I pulled the trigger several times, shooting until no bullet was left. In the struggle, Flavio's forearm made contact with the salted mixture, and he released me before screaming and crying in pain. I stepped away from the door and dropped the weapon, while a crouched and curled up Edlynn slowly stood up. We both looked at Flavio's cell door in silence for a few seconds.

"Is it that bad?" I asked her.

"Yes, really, really bad." She answered, showing some severe burns on her right hand. "I woke up in one of the cells, without a single cloth. I had to pull out enough hair from Adelaide's head, wrap it around the hand to safely punch open that door." She told me, pointing at the broken door.

"Adelaide. Maybe a line of salt in front of the door would have done the job. At least she tried." I said.

"There's a pile of that salted mixture in the corner of the cell. I bet the key was buried under for her to use when she comes back." Edlynn said. "I hadn't found the time to tell you earlier. Your dear Adelaide is a human devotee. This is fucking insane. Rebels are just a very few and devotees are many, didn't know they were that many." She added.

"Humans too? This is going too far."

"I checked her notes and books earlier. I found some interesting things but I could not read it, you know..." She spoke.

"Can you show it to me?" I proposed, and she walked towards Adelaide's desk. "Edlynn?" I called. She turned to me, amplifying the shame I felt for what had occurred earlier. "I'm sorry. I'm sorry I doubted you. It's just— I tried apologizing.

"Little boy got some manners. That's great! Else, I would have beheaded you with one punch. Don't worry, I'm not mad at you for shooting at me." She said. "Come on, we still in a hurry, and that Adelaide of yours got a lot of explanations to do." She added, walking toward the desk.

"From what I saw, she trying to achieve something on her own and in favor of Redeye's plan. She kidnapped and used some of the villagers for her rituals. You can see that most of them didn't make it. Dude in the cell will surely know the same fate after the blackout when she comes back, unless you survive and expose her." Edlynn spoke, after opening a book on a certain page and showing the content to me.

"An outlander? She's trying to create an outlander. That's what is written." I revealed.

"Sick witch!" Edlynn said.

"Nobody can create an outlander. You just a bunch of ignorant fools." Flavio spoke.

"And nobody asked you shit, nutcase. Just shut the fuck up!" Edlynn replied.

"Just what's that plan? That Redeye man, what does he want from me? Why he doing all this?" I questioned.

Edlynn took another book, and quickly turned pages until she stopped on one with the drawing of several spirits being absorbed by a strange shining scepter.

"I have an idea of what's written. But I have to hear it from your mouth and make sure." She said.

"It says that, this is a ritual called 'Transcendence' and that—"

"Transcendence? That's what our leader warned us about: assimilation and annihilation. Terrence, we're all in trouble. Everyone here is in danger. If he gets a hold of you—"

"That's not what the transcendence means, you ignorant!" Flavio interrupted. "Believe me Outlander, you'll regret trusting her. You'll regret." He added.

"Just shut it Flavio!" Edlynn said.

"Still can't believe Adelaide is involved. Do you think there are more like her?" I asked.

"There are. Let me check, I'm sure I found some sort of diary earlier. Yeah, that's the one." She said, before finding and handing me the diary. 

The diary was mostly filled with pictures. Pictures of the people she kidnapped, people that I knew. Pictures of the inhuman things she did to them, their pains and suffering immortalized in those sick photographs. I kept on turning the pages, until I saw several group pictures. They all stood next to Adelaide, all of them smiling at the lens, and dressed in red ceremonial cloaks with the symbol resembling the compass on their chest. Disgusted, I looked at them, until familiar faces struck me with surprise and disbelief.

"No, no, no it can't be, not you, no,..." I said in complete denial. I felt sick and dizzy again and dropped the diary. I just wanted to get out of that basement, therefore, aided by the wall, I painfully walked towards the exit, hyperventilating and ignoring Edlynn.

"Terrence? Terrence what's that? What's happening?" She kept on asking.

When I reached the living room, I heard Edlynn close the secret entrance to the basement and the closet. However, something more ominous had come our way, as I saw several shadows through the windows taking the direction of the entrance door. I ran back to the bedroom.

"They found us, they're here!" I told Edlynn in the corridor.

"What? Ok, I'll handle that, hide in the room quick!" She suggested and went to receive the visitors, who already took the freedom to open the door and make their entrance.

"Edlynn, what a fucking surprise." I heard one of the souls say. I recognized the voice, it was the soul inside Carla.

"Not nice to see you, Razor! Even in a cute little girl's body." Edlynn replied.

"Oh Edlynn I'm so touched by the compliment. Well, one of my guys swear he heard gunshots coming from this house. And you know, as fucking good and concerned citizens, we just came to check on whatever was going on here." Razor said.

"Your guy gotta be high, what gunshots?" Edlynn answered, while I entered Adelaide's closet, standing right in front of the secret basement door.

At that point, I could no longer hear clearly what was being said even though I tried hard for a few minutes. Afterwards, I could then hear several people searching the house. I thought about hiding in the basement until Edlynn finds me there later. I did not even open the basement door, when I heard one of the intruders open the cupboard's door, and with a hoarse male voice, he quietly said two words that meant the end for me:

"Got you!"
