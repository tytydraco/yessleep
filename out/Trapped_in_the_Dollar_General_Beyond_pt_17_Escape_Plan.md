Hey there everybody.


I know you've been curious to know what happened since we came back from the ceiling.


Well, we've been planning our escape. 


The first day was for sharing information. We sat around the Coleman stove as we ate and listened to Gale's story, hoping there would be something in there we could use to help us escape. We had both been to the other side, but Gale had been there for quite a while. His insight would likely be instrumental in an escape attempt from the Dollar General Beyond, and, anyway, it was time for a sharing of knowledge all around.


Celene seemed almost bashful around him, not really sure what to say. She was glad to have him with her, that much was clear and glad to have me and Buddy back too, but she didn't seem to be sure what to say to him now that he was back. They hadn't seen each other in what I assumed was a very long time, and though they looked exactly the same, they had likely existed for decades apart.


As Gale sat, the soup in his lap forgotten, he told us all about the ceiling.


"I know you've seen it, kid, but it's like an endless black-and-white store. It's THE store, I think. The stores we travel to just take their shape from there. The black and white stores can be whatever we want them to be, and by existing in them we subconsciously create the stores."


"But wait," I said, not understanding, "You had been to the stores I had seen. You told me as much, and I saw your mark on them."


Gale shrugged, "I dunno, maybe you just aren't very creative."


There was silence for a moment and then he laughed, breaking the tension.


"More than likely it's because I've existed here about a hundred times longer than you, kid. Even so, you've written down more than a few stores that I had never been to until you took me to them. I think the longer you travel the stores, the more you influence them. I don't really know, of course. I'm mostly just guessing, but I do know that the stores are taking more people than we thought."


He took a little sip of his soup then, but it seemed like it was more to wet the pipes than to fill his belly.


"While you were up there, did you run into any of the black and white people?"


I nodded, "Yeah. To me, they looked like photo negatives, but I guess I could see them being black and white."


Gale nodded, "To me, they reminded me of the old Tex Avery cartoons I used to watch, especially the ones that played toward the end of the lineup. The ink and paint sketches, the ones that looked kind of unfinished. That was what these places looked like to me, like unfinished ink tests from some production company. They moved strangely, back and forth like angry ghosts, and when I first encountered them I thought they might be part of the miasma's defenses. Once I got to the crystal cocoons, though, I knew what they were. Those are the ghosts of the people they've used to power the Beyond. We thought we were alone, but their just saving us for a rainy day. These stores are just their pantry, the maze they keep the rats in till they need more food for the snake. How many of the ghost people did you see while you were up there?" he asked suddenly.


I thought about it, "Two? Maybe Three?"


"I saw about thirty while I explored, and most of them were children."


He let that sink in for a moment as he took another sip of his soup. It was chicken noodle, something name-brand tonight, but it had turned to ashes in my mouth. Suddenly I knew what had probably happened to Jasper's missing grandson, what had happened to Rudy and Margo, and what had befallen so many other nameless kiddos who had gone to the bathroom and wound up somewhere else.


"You called them cocoons," I said, "To me, they looked like trees."


Gale nodded, "They did to me too, at first, but once I realized what they were for I couldn't think of them as anything but cocoons. They hold them there after the Miasma gets them. They hold them there and they drain their life away. I say they take mostly kids, but I don't think they're very picky. They want life force, and they take it where they can get it."


"Then," Celene began, looking up from her soup as if unsure if she wanted to continue, "why don't we go break these cocoons? We could smash them up and mess it up for this Miasma or whatever they are."


Gale had started shaking his head when she talked about busting them up, and it only got more pronounced the longer she went on.


"Na, Celene. If we did that, we'd be trapped here just like them. They'd have us cornered then, and it would be all too easy to just use us as a power source until we were used up. No, our best chance is to just escape and never set foot in one of these stores again. It's the only way to be truly safe. Once we escape, if we escape, we never go near one again."


"No worries there," Celene said, "I think I've seen about enough Dollar Generals to do me for a lifetime."


"Yeah," I added, and Buddy barked as if in confirmation.


After Gale finished with his story, I laid out everything I had seen Outside. I told them about how the Miasma had been there too. I told him about the mushroom forests and the brackish water. I told him about the strange creatures I had seen there, and how I had found the remains of Kenneth. I told him about the Hermit's journal, and about the rain that had hurt me, and then, finally, how I had come to be back inside the Dollar General Beyond and how I had found Celene. They both listened, though Celene had heard it all before, and Gale just laughed as I wrapped it up.


"Into the Ceiling, into the Outside. You've just broken all the rules, haven't you, kid?" 


I shrugged, "I guess so."


Celene then told us everything she knew about the journal, and about her experiences with Jasper the Hermit. 


"When I met him, he was barely hanging in there. I got him some meds, there's a store that's basically just a pharmacy, and for a while, it helped him. He told me about a place after the snowy store, a place where the darkness hid something. He said there were lots of the shadow creatures there, the Miasma, but that he believed it was an important place. He thought they guarded it because there was something special there, but he was too afraid to go and see what it was. I think thats our way out. The Miasma are there, but maybe, if we're sneaky, we can find out what they're guarding and see if it will help us."


Gale nodded, "Agreed. I think I'm more than ready to be out of this place. It's been a long time since I saw trees and grass and something other than shelves of goods."


"Well then," Celene said, "We're in luck because I might have an idea on how to fight the Miasma."


Gale and I stared at her like she was crazy, and even Buddy looked a little skeptical.


"This would have been valuable information to someone going into the ceiling," I said, a little perturbed, "The place where the Miasma LIVE."


Celene shrugged, looking a little sheepish, "It didn't seem like the time to test it, and, believe it or not, I haven't really encountered a lot of Miasma in my time here. I have taken steps to avoid them, actually, but while I reading Jasper's journal, I remembered something he had given me while he was still semi-lucid. He wasn't writing very clearly by then, and the pills didn't seem to be doing a lot for his dementia, but one day, when I came to visit, he presented me with a sheet of paper and said it was a first-hand account of how to fight one of the shadow creatures that lived in the ceiling. I put it away, thinking it was nonsense, but I looked over it again while you were gone and I think he might have something. The logic is sound, at least it seems to be, and I suppose if we're going to take the fight to them then it would be nice to have a little surprise for them."


"Quit stalling," Gale said, humor and intrigue at odds with each other, "let's hear it."


"Well, he claimed that any light source could disrupt them, but only the point that the source was touching. He speculated that this was why the lights always go out when they come out. It's easier for them to move in low light or total darkness, which makes them more substantial. He has a diagram here too, though it looks like a bunch of flashlights taped together. He's pretty clear that this won't kill the Miasma, just make it less substantial. If it isn't solid, then it can't hurt you. At least, that's what he thinks."


We were both nodding, but I was still a little miffed that she hadn't shared this with me before I went into the ceiling.


"Tested or not, I could have used that upstairs."


"Yeah," she said, a little exasperatedly, "but imagine if it didn't work? You're counting on this hail mary and it doesn't work. I didn't want to give you false hope. Hell, I'm still not sure it will work. I'm with Gale, our best bet is to sneak into this place and hope to be missed. The Miasma here are supposed to be absolutely massive. Maybe they'll miss us if we can move quietly and find the doorway of portal or whatever it is that takes us back to our world. This just gives us options and possibilities, and that might give us an edge."


I nodded, her logic making sense. It was definitely something I might have tried after being cornered by all those Miasma, and if it hadn't worked it would have drawn a lot of attention to Gale and I. We would have likely not survived if they had seen us, and not knowing had probably stopped us from doing something desperate. Buddy stuck his head under my hand then, taking away a little of my irritation as I petted him. 


"Okay, so we need to go have a look around it seems like. If we get the lay of the land, then we can make a plan to get there without being seen."


Gale was nodding, "That seems like a solid plan. We can figure out what's in there and form a plan of attack. I'd really like to test that theory about the lights too, and I think I know the perfect place for a test."


Celene looked lost, but I was nodding as I realized what he was talking about.


The burnt-out store.


Gale wanted to use the burnt-out store to test a hypothesis, a hypothesis that had the potential to go very badly.


"We don't have to," Celene began, but Gale cut her off.


"No, if it can help then I'd like to know how much. If we're going to get out of here, then we might need every trick in the book to manage it."


That was when we began preparing to test Jasper's Theory. Gale has a bunch of these big ole seven hundred and fifty candle lights he's been setting aside, Something to light the place if the power went out, and Celene has a bunch of these halogen lanterns she's hoping will do the trick. I've been playing around with these super bright clip-on lights, the kind of things joggers use, and hopefully, we can make little fields around ourselves that disrupt the shadows. We worked furiously, though I guess we didn't need to. It wouldn't matter how fast or slow we worked, we were still stuck here in this timeless void. 


As we worked, I couldn't help but notice little things about my conspirators either. They were working close together, smiling and laughing more than I had ever seen before. It makes me wonder if Rudy and Margo were the only secret/not so secret couple at the Dollar General. I've been trying to give them space, Buddy and I taking a lot of walks on the back aisle, and I've become pretty close with the pooch. I wonder if Celene would mind him coming back with me? Would that even work? How does the return process work? 


So many questions, but not many answers. 


So that's where we're at now. I'm making this update while those two take inventory of what they have in both hideouts.


I'd be lying if I said I wasn't a little excited. 


It's a chance to escape, the best chance we've had so far, and if it fails then I guess at least it will fail spectacularly. 


They're putting something together now, working on something that will help us combat the Miasma, and I should probably go help them.


Hopefully, there won't be many of these left to go, and I'll be back in the real world soon enough.


Till then, pray for me.
