Dear Dr Eastley,

I'm afraid to say I was disappointed, but unsurprised, to receive your letter of resignation. As you know, we take the emotional well-being of our research teams very seriously at IPSET.

However, I want you to know that the threats you made, both legal and otherwise, prompted us to take recourse. I felt it would be prudent to remind you of a few truths. As much as I accept that I am the, as you put it, "*bastard that dragged* (you) *into all this shit",* it would be wise to remember the reality of the events you rather childishly refuse to accept responsibility for.

Firstly, your enlistment with IPSET. Nobody forced your hand to sign the contract. Yes, I do accept that under the circumstances you were somewhat incentivised to do so. However, as you frequently pointed out in your letter, "(you) *would rather die than work another day for* (us) *freaks"*. I'd like to remind you that when given the freedom to choose between death and IPSET, you chose IPSET. We cannot be held responsible for you feeling you made the wrong decision after the fact.

Secondly, your tenure in the nursery of the North Sea Facility. As per procedure, you were given a full brief of the acidity of the larval-stage Entity-0090 secretions. I have seen the safety video myself. Human Resources could not have been clearer about the need to maintain a 19ft radius at all times. I don't care how often you repeated yourself in your letter, but *"*(we) *didn't tell* (you) *they could fucking talk"* isn't an excuse. I have seen the footage of the incident. I do accept that your injuries looked painful, however, IPSET holds no responsibility for your inability to resist telesuggestive speech patterns.

You'd seen photographs of Entity-0090 in your orientation. Despite your youth back then, the way you panicked was, in no uncertain terms, unprofessional. Your wailing and shrieks overexcited several larval-stage Entity-0090 specimens. Yes, I understand that "(you) *watched* (your) *fucking flesh melt until* (you) *had a fucking bone hand that* (you) *had to snap off* (yourself)". Need I remind you though that Security Sergeant Wilson's husband had to bury a box of melted flesh that, even though we took great lengths to seal the shoebox-sized coffin, carried a distinct aroma of dead fish? My ability to sympathise with your amputation is limited given this context.

Besides, as I'm sure you don't need reminding, the bionic arm we provided as a replacement is more than suitable. As unpleasant as the installation surgery may have been, I'm sure a woman of your intellect understands the necessity for the recipient to be conscious when augmenting the nervous system with advanced wetworks. At least, I'd hoped a woman of your intellect would understand. I would be lying, Dr Eastley, if your expansive letter didn't make me question my own judgement.

The third example you cited, that of your family, infuriated me. I'll be honest Dr Eastley, I struggle to comprehend where you found the nerve to level such a charge against IPSET, myself, or anybody at the Marathon County Facility. I found the gall you showed in doing so, to be totally blunt, offensive.

You were fully aware of Event-0216 when you **volunteered to study it**. I emphasise this because you seem to have completely forgotten that it was **you who requested your family be transferred with you to the Marathon County Facility**. It was a testament to your abilities that IPSET Human Resources went to such great lengths to accommodate your requests. I see now that this was a wasted, and unappreciated, investment of time and finance.

As I recall, you were incredibly excited about the discovery of [Entity-E0216](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/p0eu4c/someone_tell_the_army_to_drop_a_bomb_on_my_house/). The blame cannot be placed on myself or IPSET for what transpired over the six months after your first contact. IPSET contamination protocols are specific and thorough for a reason. I have reviewed the security footage, and upon exiting the test chamber you very clearly **did not** remain in the decontamination chamber for the mandated 120 minutes. 118 minutes 27 seconds isn't two hours. I am aware of your repeated reports of "*that snivelly bastard* [Harper-Girard](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/pgmrcu/we_unearthed_a_time_travellers_ship_at_an/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)*".* These accusations were found to have no merit. The Entity-E0216 breach was found by IPSET HR to have been caused by lax adherence to policy, not sabotage. As director, I stand by the findings of that investigation. The blame for what happened to your family lies with you, not Dr Harper-Girard.

I was under the impression this matter was put to bed after the hearing. It truly saddens me that this wasn't the case, Geraldine.

IPSET cannot be held responsible for the E0216 crustaceospores being small enough to fit through the air vent in your, quite frankly, more than comfortable on-site accommodation. It is no fault of ours that your husband and two children slept through the infection process. We were not aware the E0216 spores secreted anaesthetic from their exoskeletons (although the observation has proved helpful in future research, so at least their deaths weren't in vain, eh?)

I'll be completely honest, even *I* found the footage of the emergence terrifying. Not as much as when I was there. It was quite an experience watching the surveillance video back before I wrote this, watching us both screaming in the lab while security took down Gregory. Sorry, that was callous, it wasn't Gregory. It was the Entity-E0216 that Gregory had become. Suffice to say though, the fatal shot clearly occurs *after* full transformation had occurred. We did not "*murder* (your) *fucking husband"*, we put down the monstrosity your negligent attitude to Health & Safety policy allowed him to become.

I was fond of your family, Dr Eastley. It pains me to believe that you're deluded enough to think I hold any responsibility for your children and husband becoming… well, you know what they became. I'm looking at the photos as I write this; little Tiffany's spine stretching, the new legs shredding out the skin of her back. It's the still from the moment her eyes fell out that disturbs me the most, Geraldine. They still have their old skin, you know, in the lab. I know you're aware of the E0216 corpses they left behind, you were on the team that dissected young Steven's after all. I didn't know if you knew about the skin though, the human skin I mean, the skin they'd shed.

Do you remember that night, Geraldine? I'm sure you do. We're long-lived, but we're not indestructible. Gregory and your children are even less so. Do you remember the months they spent in the infirmary? Do you remember how I'd visit them as though they were my own? I was just as horrified as you when their faces started elongating. The mandibles that mangled and pushed their jaws out of the way bought tears to *both* of our eyes, Dr Eastley, not just yours.

I'm sure you remember how we ran through the Marathon County Facility when they started chasing us. Goddammit, Geraldine, very few times have I actually been scared, but knowing those E0216 monstrosities, with their centipede bodies and fresh-rending face claws, were once little Steven and Tiffany still gives me nightmares. I was there holding your hand in the North Sea Infirmary when Gregory was caught up in whatever project I had him on. They were my god-children, Dr Eastley. Even though I've seen my fair share of both, that title still holds emotional significance to me.

I am trying to keep this letter professional, despite you not having shown me the same courtesy, but fuck you for placing your families death on me. I was crying at the funeral too, Geraldine. You know full well that **everything** we do at IPSET has meaning, no matter how much it upsets us. I don't recall you protesting when we were both cowering in a corner listening to your infected children getting gunned down in the corridor.

This is where I'd also like to remind you that, for a "*twisted heartless fucking immortal sociopath",* I took your requests for compassionate leave incredibly seriously. You were the first IPSET employee to receive a sick day, did you know that? That was specifically because of my intervention. HR wanted you labelled as a compromised asset. Perhaps I made a mistake in overruling them.

This is why your letter disappointed me, Dr Eastley. I'd grown fond of you, not just as a colleague but as a friend. Very rarely has this happened during my long, long career. It brought me no pleasure at all to read your take on your time with the PLR team.

If you'll recall, you **begged** me to be transferred to Paranatural Literary Research. I warned you, and I know you remember that. I made it very clear that, just because you'd be working with books rather than bioentities, you weren't any safer (emotionally or physically). I find it genuinely shocking that you've managed to omit the fact I denied your request **seven times** before agreeing to have you transferred to the London Facility. You were a key asset in the bioentity team, Dr Eastley. Moving you in with the page-turners was done at great expense to IPSET's long term strategy. It's insulting that you think "(I) *put* (you) *on Event-HAHRE as a twisted fucking punishment*". I put you on Event-HAHRE because you were the most valuable fucking asset in PLR as soon as you touched down in the UK.

Do you think Dr Anand could have deciphered that damn book? Or that idiot Boxstead? Three of the team that brought it in gouged out their damn eyeballs within a week. Four more had to be terminated when they tried to resign and join that damn cult you identified. You were the only person on Event-HAHRE who wasn't broken by that [little red book](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/pfwgik/my_housemate_was_a_genius_i_dont_regret_burning/). It even broke Dr Bridger, and he was reassigned to HAHRE after three decades of studying a copy of [*The Taealim Alrajul Al'akhir*](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/pbfsl7/never_light_a_corpse_wax_candle/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)*.*

Think about that, Geraldine. Dr Bridger spent thirty years working with a multidimensional, sentient, endlessly self-writing literary event-entity that was actively trying to kill him. Before he retired from the field, the man rescued five agents from an[ Entity-E0879](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/oy5z6e/i_want_a_sandwich/) pocket dimension. He was as tough as they come. He'd had *The Taealim* project since the ’90s and hadn't broken, Event-HAHRE managed it in a damn afternoon. I didn't exactly have many options.

Look, Geraldine, as upset with you as I am, I can't help but stop once again to thank you for what you achieved during your time on the Event-HAHRE team. That's partly why I don't accept your accusations re how you lost your arm. You're one of the most teleresistant assets we have. Our understanding of Event-HAHRE has grown exponentially, and I'll be the first to admit we knew next to nothing before you were reassigned to PLR. Given what you uncovered, we would have been in serious trouble if we'd let it slip through the net. Jesus, even I'm scared of the damn thing, and I've been in the Over-Library and communed with the Listener. Sorry, that's [Entity-E0001](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/ow30vc/we_made_too_much_noise_in_the_library_and_im_the/) to you.

The point is, I want you to understand something. I am truly sincere when I say I regret your tenure in PLR ending the way it did. One of the few criticisms I do accept is that "(I) *could have fucking done fucking something to fucking pull* (you) *out of there.*" This I do apologise for. However, given what we were learning of Event-HAHRE, I will not apologise for keeping my most valuable asset on the project.

I'll be blunt Geraldine. Those researchers you killed? They meant nothing to me. Nothing. Given the scope of threat Event-HAHRE represents, I'd satiate your bloodlust with a million more if it meant keeping you in the room with that damn book. Let's be honest, ripping out their eyes to stop yourself from going blind is the first time you've ever needed research assistants anyway. I did not "*make* (you) *eat their damn eyes"*. The book made you do that. I just refused to open the door. I still would. If I had, you'd never have slipped into that trance, and we'd never have learned about the [mask](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/p3met4/we_broke_into_a_museum_i_cant_unsee_what_we_found/).

Their lives were a minor inconvenience. Your sanity, however, was a great loss. I did not inject you with the immortality serum only to lose your mind to madness. However, as long as your instability doesn't interrupt your work on Event-HAHRE, it may not be too much of a setback. There is a great deal to uncover in that book. I'm sure we'd get a good few centuries out of you before I'd have to allow HR to designate you a compromised asset. I'm sure they'll be thrilled when the day comes.

So, in short, I am writing to you to respectfully decline your resignation. I don't know where you are, or how you escaped, but we will find you. Accessing the database to copy everything was smart, I'll give you that. Emailing a resignation letter to me to gloat about your plans to leak the files you've stolen was, however, stupid. It was perhaps the most disappointing thing in your thirty-page letter, Dr Eastley.

I was like a father to you Geraldine. I was there at your wedding, deep in the bowels of the North Sea facility. Sending IPSET security to collect you, knowing how rough they can be, genuinely broke my heart. We cracked your location in about thirty minutes. Technology was always Gregory's forte, wasn't it? Maybe if it was you that we lost to Entity-E0216 I'd be worried right now, instead of just heartbroken.

Keep on the move all you want, Geraldine. We'll find you sooner or later. Or, you know, you could voluntarily return? Either way, IPSET cannot afford delays to the Event-HAHRE project. You'll be back in your cell by the end of the month, just to forewarn you. How much violence occurs between then and now is your call.

Oh, and don't be stupid and post this on the internet somewhere like you did with that fisherman's crayon letter. Yes, I know it was you that leaked the [Entity-0090 nursery breach](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/p8ydma/theres_a_waterslide_in_the_middle_of_the_north_sea/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) account. I'm already upset with you Dr Eastley. Don't make me angry with you too.

Warmest regards,
