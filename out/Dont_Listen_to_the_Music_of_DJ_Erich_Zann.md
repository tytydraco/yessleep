I need to find DJ Erich Zann.  

Or, more specifically, the DJ formerly known as Erich Zann.  He’s changed his name; his Spotify and YouTube all his socials have been nuked.  He’s definitely left New York.  But he’s out there somewhere.  Making more of his strange, disynchronous, yet hypnotic music.  Building a new fanbase.  Luring them in, before… well, a repeat of what happened at The P\*\*\*\*\* in Bushwick.  

Twenty-nine people dead.  An electrical fire, the investigators claimed.  Faulty wiring.  You know how it is with these poorly-maintained, converted warehouses.  A fire, the local news repeated.  “Fire” was the story they were sticking to.  If anyone from the FBI or the CIA or any shadowy X Files agency knows any better, they aren’t saying anything at all.  

\*\*\*\*\*

A bartender buddy of mine, Andy, recommended me for the DJ Erich Zann gig.  

*Dude you up to work a concert in Bushwick?*  He’d texted me.  *A guy called last night, said he found my business card.  But I’m already booked on the Lower East Side.  Pays $100 for the night, plus tips.  Really small gig, shouldn’t be much work.*

I said I’d do it.  I recognized the address.  The P\*\*\*\*\* was an old warehouse at the ass-end of Bushwick, wedged into a corner between the Queens County border and the cemetery, surrounded by other abandoned warehouses - tagged up, with metal-roofed awnings and those huge roll-up doors you see on industrial properties.  The owners had re-wired and re-designed the inside, to be rented out for art shows, concerts, and club nights.  

Andy sent me a photo of the event’s promotional flier.  It was shiny black, with a childlike drawing of a stick-figure girl leading a huge, fluffy monster on a leash.  The design appeared cute at first glance, but the longer you looked at it, the more disturbing it became.  The monster's crudely-drawn human face was too large for its body.  Its toothy mouth seemed less a friendly smile than a threatening sneer.  *DJ Erich Zann.  10pm.* 

I spent some time internet-stalking DJ Erich Zann.  The guy played up the mystique, for sure.  I found only one photo of the DJ himself, and it wasn’t a particularly revealing one.  Just a man, in a Cthulhu mask and turtleneck, standing behind a sound board, with long sleeves and gloves on his hands.  

I clicked into his YouTube.

*DJ Erich Zann*, the profile read.  *We live on a placid island of ignorance in the midst of black seas of infinity.*  

H.P. Lovecraft.  He’d also stolen his stage name from an H.P. Lovecraft story.  Adorable.

I hit play on a video titled Asenath #14.  25K views; 1,500 likes; comments disabled. 

The music started slow and low, pounding bass over a hazy, barely-perceptible electronic rumble.  On the video screen, against an empty background, bits of white light swirled and exploded and pulled back together, then split into pulsating stars in primary colors.  A trilling instrumental melody stretched over the repetitive bass-line, rising and falling and shooting off into a million different directions, as the colorful stars on screen spun like pinwheels, light blending and shifting and modulating, before a frenetic piping overcame the instrumental tapestry…

“Wow!  FIFTY percent off!  Bill’s Better Secondhand Furniture post-Labor Day sale!”

I muted my laptop as an ad replaced the hypnotic EDM melody.  Asenath #14 had been really short.  

Except, it wasn’t.  Asenath #14 was 33 minutes, 45 seconds long.  

I frowned.  No way I’d listened to that song for over a half an hour.  

\*\*\*\*\*

I called the number Andy gave me; no one picked up.  So, around eight thirty, I walked from the train station to The P\*\*\*\*\*, down an alley to the back parking lot and employee entrance.  There was clearly something going on - I could hear the *thud, thud, thud* of electronic bass.  But, unlike every other time I’d worked the venue, there were no roadies trudging in and out with heavy equipment.  There were no people around at all.  

No cars in the back parking lot either, except for one camper van.  That, in and of itself, wouldn’t be surprising - plenty of touring musicians live out of vans.  But this one was odd because it was completely blacked out.  I’m not talking about tinted windows.  Someone had taken the effort to cover every spot where light might seep through with opaque, dull black material.  

*Asshole’s committed to the aesthetic*, I thought.

Even stranger, the rolling door of the loading dock was still closed and locked.  As was the employee door. There was a handwritten sign posted there: ABSOLUTELY NO ENTRY UNTIL 10PM.

My next thought was the one that, in a roundabout way, saved my life.

It went: *screw that upside down, backwards and sideways.*  

The promo fliers said the event started at 10:00.  Which meant, the moron who’d posted the sign assumed I’d be able to set up a full bar while dealing with a line full of guests wanting to get liqueured up before the show.  Lucky for me, I’d poured wine at a gallery popup at The P\*\*\*\*\* two weekends before.  And I’d forgotten to return the key.

The way The P\*\*\*\*\* is set up, the bar is in a separate, smaller backroom, connected to the showroom by a squat hallway.  The employee door opened into the backroom, where I found my crates of liquor already deposited on top of the bar.  The throbbing bass line I’d heard outside emanated from the showroom, rhythmic and looping.  I saw moving shadows.  I assumed the tech guys were all in there.  

I got to work organizing bottles as the last of the summer evening light faded to darkness, bass booming in my head, guiding my movements like a conductor.  An hour later, I had to pee.  I didn’t want to annoy the roadies, or piss off whoever didn’t want me in The P\*\*\*\*\* before ten, but the venue’s only bathrooms were in the showroom, and the building was isolated amongst a sea of empty warehouses, and my only other option was to whip it out in the parking lot.  

So I went.  At the end of the hallway, I froze.

There were figures setting up the stage, but they weren’t roadies.

They were pitch-black automatons shaped like naked, featureless, sexless humans; mannequins at the mall become animate.  Their skin looked the consistency of clay.  They moved fluidly, more organic than robotic.  There were six of them.  Each had arms and legs and, in lieu of a head, a cube-shaped protuberance emitting small peals of grey smoke as they lifted crates of lights and arranged amps on the main stage.

I yelped.  I backpedaled.  My foot caught on something; I stumbled, a weight gave way, and the music stopped.  I realized the looped bass-line had come from a laptop, plugged in on the floor.  I’d tripped over it.  I’d hit a button or two.  I’d killed the music.  

SLAM!  CRASH!

Metal framing was dropped.  The sound board hit the elevated stage with a hollow THUD!  Everything the claylike, pitch-black, humanoid faux-roadies had been carrying fell to the ground.

As the faux-roadies themselves melted, like butter in a pan, into gelatinous black puddles.

\*\*\*\*\*

After The P\*\*\*\*\* incident - after that night - I scoured the internet for people who knew DJ Erich Zann.  People who could explain to me who he actually was.  Or who he’d been before he was DJ Erich Zann.

*He kinda just appeared on Spotify in 2021*, one Redditor wrote.

*I thought he was an AI*, said another.  

*Didn’t he die in a fire at his concert in Brooklyn?*  Asked yet another.  *I dunno, maybe start there?  His family must’ve said something.*

His family - if they existed - hadn’t uttered a word.  I’d scoured the internet for an actual photograph of DJ Erich Zann, or even a recording of his voice, and came up with nothing.  

Finally, User Gregg87 direct messaged me.

*DJ Erich Zann was my roommate*, he wrote.  *I’ll be in NYC next week for Tech Week.  I can tell you everything.*  

\*\*\*\*\*

Gregg87 is a real guy, with a real name and a family and a life in Pasadena, California.  But for privacy purposes, I’ll refer to him here as, simply, Greg.  Greg is an aerospace engineer with a Master’s degree.  We met at a quiet coffee shop in Williamsburg.  He’d known DJ Erich Zann while they were both college students in the late two thousands. 

“James Hadley,” Greg told me.  “That’s his real name.”

James Hadley and Greg shared a Pasadena apartment, a few blocks from the university they both attended, during Greg’s senior year of college.  James, though a year younger, was already three years into a Ph.D. program in theoretical physics.  Their residential situation had been arranged by university student services; for half a semester, Greg said, it felt more like living with a skittish cat than another young adult.

James spent every minute he wasn’t on campus barricaded in his room, working through equations or practicing his electric violin with headphones in.  Whenever he inadvertently found himself in the same room with Greg, he’d lower his eyes and scurry away like a cockroach in the light.  

Greg felt sorry for him.  He made it his mission to befriend his reclusive roommate, approaching the task as one would set about domesticating a feral pet.  Greg stopped studying in his room; instead, he’d arrange himself on the couch in the common room, hook his laptop to the TV, and play old Star Trek episodes as background noise.  On the rare occasion James emerged from his room, Greg would invite him to sit and watch.  At first, James might linger for a few minutes.  Then, he started sitting down beside Greg.  Finally, after a month of warming up, he brought own work into the common room so they could study together.  When that became comfortable, James - at long last - began to speak.

“It was school stuff, at first,” Greg told me.  “His area was string theory unification… universe-building stuff, the interchange between particle physics and a potential tapestry of infinite planes… I’m not even sure I can explain it correctly.  Eventually, though, I got him to open up about his life outside his research.  You know, his family.”

James Hadley had been the beloved only child of successful parents.  When they’d realized their seven-year-old could solve advanced algebraic equations and play Mozart on the violin, they lobbied James’s small private academy to skip him from second grade to seventh. He excelled both academically and musically, but his relationship with other children was a source of anxiety.  The bigger boys in the neighborhood bullied him for being “weird,” while his pre-teen classmates treated him as more spectacle than friend.  

Finally, his parents pulled him out of school altogether.  His mother - a professor at Cal State LA’s School of Education - taught him at home until, aged thirteen, James was accepted into a prestigious university.  His mom and dad switched off driving him to and from college, even after he finished undergrad and began his Ph.D. coursework, until that year.  That year, his parents both died: his mother, in March, after a long battle with breast cancer; his father, in July, from a sudden heart attack.  Without them, James felt alone in the world.  They weren’t just family; they’d been his cheerleaders, his most enthusiastic supporters, his only friends.

“I don’t know how to live in society,” James admitted to Greg.  “I want friends my own age.  I want to go to parties, to socialize, to find my people.  I just… can’t.”

“How about music?”  Greg asked him.  “Maybe try and find a band to play with.”

James took that advice to heart.  He bought himself a guitar and practiced in garages with stoners he met on Craigslist.  But it wasn’t a fit.  The guy wasn’t built to be a rocker - he was too self-conscious, too anal, a black hole of charisma.  Then, Greg had an epiphany.  Electronic music was still relatively niche then, still geeky.  James was intrigued.  A cousin of Greg’s bought ProTools to mess with as a hobby, then lost interest; Greg convinced him to sell his entire setup to James at a discount. 

“As a DJ, he could play a character,” Greg explained.  “He could venture out into the world, be the life of the party, surround himself with people - without bursting his bubble.”

And it worked.  It worked better than Greg could’ve ever imagined.

James, a musical prodigy with technical skills, took to ProTools like a duck to water.  The ability to produce sounds no human voice or human hands could produce, for him, was the purest form of creation.  His music blended sounds and rhythms together that shouldn’t have mixed, yet did, into hypnotic harmonies that transfixed listeners.  Greg connected him to high school buddies at other LA universities; soon, James had built a small following and a solid side hustle as a frat party entertainer.  He went through a few names: DJ Schrodinger, StarboyXJH, Majorana Fermion.  

“It should’ve stayed that way,” Greg said wistfully.  “I thought he was happy.  But James always wanted more.”

One night, Greg was out studying at a friend’s house when he got a text from James.  *Come home now*, the text read, with twenty exclamation points.  Greg did as he was told.  When he arrived, he found his usually-restrained roommate bouncing around like an excited puppy.

“You have to see this!” he exclaimed, dragging Greg into his room and shutting the door.  He turned out the lights, typed a few keys on his computer, and closed his eyes as music flowed forth.  

“There was a recorder, piping over a string quartet, over a brass band, over a bass line that sounded like a train approaching” Greg said.  “I thought I heard screaming cats in there somewhere, too.  All the different melodies came together, then broke apart, then… curved.  Can music curve?”

Mesmerized, Greg eventually realized he was no longer in James’s room.  

They were outside - he felt the warm air against his face - on an alien planet with a rich maroon sky.  Obsidian-black tundra stretched forever into the distance on all sides, dotted with throbbing golden orbs emitting the feeling of rough sandpaper.  James stood there with him and, before them, a black swamp bubbled.  Tar-like globules crawled out.  Like snakes to a snake charmer, or flowers to the sun, they reached with wormy black tendrils towards the music, and began to sway in time with the rhythm.  

“I don’t know how long it lasted,” Greg said.  “Time meant nothing.  Then, I was back in James’s room, balled up on the floor.”

As soon as the room stopped spinning and Greg regained his ability to speak, he demanded James tell him what he’d done to them.  James grinned from ear to ear.

“The promise of string theory,” he said.  “I manipulated matter with my music.  I changed our vibrations.  I took us to another dimension.”

“Shit, James,” Greg stammered.  “What if… what if we couldn’t get back?  Or if we got hurt or something?”

James smiled wider.  “You don’t need to worry about that.  We’re ghosts there.  Nothing could touch us.”

Greg had to admit: the experience of transporting himself to another dimension, through music, had been cool.  Soon, James incorporated interdimensional tourism into his live sets.  He conjured up bubbly pink jungles with cute flying felines, or forests full of multicolored plants and bugs that resembled the drawings of sugar-high kindergarteners, or stark rocky seashores where blood-red waves met a blanket of thick, blue snow.  He gained himself a reputation, amongst Southern California sorority girls and underground EDM fans, as the DJ whose music could generate hallucinations without drugs.  

James should’ve been happy.  Yet still, he wasn’t satisfied.

On a rainy winter night, Greg returned home late.  He heard violin music emanating from James’s room.  The song was fast and frenetic, jumping around from high octaves to low, jarring and nerve-rattling.  Tired and annoyed, Greg went straight to James’s room and shoved open the door.

Lights flashed from his computer, which James was connected to via his headphones.  Acoustic violin at his chin, James’s hands danced like dying spiders, racing up and down the neck of the instrument.  His eyes stared straight ahead, bloodshot and unthinking.  On his face, an expression of unspeakable pain and horror. 

Greg ran to him and pulled off his headphones, accidentally dislodging them from their jack in the process.  Music - the music that had driven his roommate to his current state - filled the room.  And Greg felt himself tugged violently into James’s nightmare.  

They were trapped in an endless cave, illuminated only by a greenish glow.  Metallic spikes, jagged stalagmites, covered the walls and ceiling and floor, jutting out as though to impale prey.  A milky-white substance, the consistency of glue, moistened the spikes like saliva.  

A grey thing lurked behind James.  

A faceless man, made of grey liquid steel.  Bubbling and dripping and re-congealing, it arms wrapped around his waist, leaving his arms free to fiddle like a madman.  It bent its hulking form, head over James’s head, lips locked to his temple as though it were drinking him.  

Greg froze, so disturbed by the liquid steel monster he didn’t immediately notice the small creature sniffing at his feet.  It was a thing the size of a puppy and the shape of a hamster, resembling a sentient steel wool sponge.  It opened a mouth, much too large, and flashed dripping grey teeth like the surrounding stalagmites.  It stared up at Greg with gelatinous yellow eyes.  

Then, the world spun.  Everything went black.

Greg woke sometime later, sprawled on the floor of James’s room, behind his desk, surrounded by silence.  A trickle of blood dripped down his forehead.  He pulled himself to his knees and fell against the wall, eyes clinched shut, grasping for a timeline.  James got stuck in another dimension.  Greg heard the music, he went there too.  They were supposed to be ghosts; nothing was supposed to touch them.  But something did, a creature of molten metal, and it attached itself to James.  Greg passed out.  As he fell, his body slammed against James’s computer, cutting the music and launching them back into their appropriate reality.

*James.*  Where was James?

Greg forced his eyes open.  James lay on the ground hear him, breath shallow, eyes wide and distant.  Greg crawled to him.  James’s lips moved.  

“A thousand,” he muttered.  “A thousand.  A thousand.”

Then he fell quiet, and his eyes finally closed.  

Greg couldn’t wake his roommate.  He dragged him to bed, wrapped him in blankets, and watched him for hours, terrified he’d stop breathing.  Finally, exhausted, Greg fell asleep in James’s desk chair.  When he awoke the next morning, James was gone.

He found his roommate in the kitchen, brewing a pot of coffee, smiling.

“What the heck, James?”  Greg stammered.  “Last night… what was that?”

James eyed Greg strangely.  “Um, nothing happened last night?  I have no idea what you’re talking about.”  

Greg gaped.  He reached up and felt the welt over his eye, scraped off dried blood, just to remind himself he hadn’t dreamed the entire thing.  

“Your violin playing!” he insisted.  “The cave with all the spikes.  The metallic lava man…eating you.  The steel wool guinea pig?  You don’t remember any of this?”

James shrugged.  “Get a therapist, man.  I think you’re hallucinating.”

As he turned his back, Greg saw an odd mark on James’s neck.  A bruise the size of a hickey.  Grey and shiny, like a smudge of silver metallic paint.

After that day, James became a different person.

Wallflower James, who lived in sweats and anime t-shirts, began wearing polos and styling his dirty-blonde hair.  Shy James, all of a sudden, attracted an entourage of frat boys who’d carry his DJ equipment and chill with him at dive bars.  James, who’d previously spent his free nights reading pulp sci-fi and commenting on classical violin blogs, cultivated a Facebook wall full of photos from drunken club nights, his arms draped around inebriated girls in short dresses.  Virgin James, who couldn’t look a woman in the eye without blushing, now texted Greg three times a week to stay out of the apartment - because James would be occupied there with a one-night playmate.  

“I should’ve been supportive, I guess,” Greg admitted.  “I’d been trying to lure him out of his comfort zone.  But that cocky womanizer with bottle service - he wasn’t James.”  

It was nearly May by then, and Greg had been accepted into MIT for a Master’s program.  He’d also begun dating his future wife.  With finals looming and his roommate inflicted with douchebag brain worms, he was more than happy to spend his days in the library and his nights with his girlfriend. 

“I’d basically moved out already”, he said.  Then, he sighed.  “A professor of mine lent me a book, and I’d forgotten about it.  I wanted to return it before the school year ended.”

Determined to collect the borrowed book, Greg reluctantly returned to the apartment he shared with James - for the last time, he promised himself.  But as he approached the door, he felt  and heard the familiar rumbling of an EDM bass line.  

*Great*, Greg thought.  *He must have a lady friend over.*

To save himself from an unsolicited porn soundtrack, he hooked his earphones up to his iPod and blasted 90’s hip-hop as he unlocked the door.  Quick as he could, he located the book under a pile of menus, then did a round of the common space, picking up random odds and ends he didn’t want to leave behind.  

Then, *Party Up* by DMX was interrupted by a woman’s scream.

Greg acted on instinct.  He ran to James’s room and forced his way through the locked door.  In the process, his earphones were torn from his ears.  And James’s music dragged him, kicking and screaming, into oblivion.  

He was back in the subterranean cave with jagged spikes and the ghostly greenish glow.  The spikes, ever so slowly, moved.  Curled and extended, refracting the hazy green light into colors and shades Greg couldn’t describe with words.  The milky-white glue substance extended from spike to spike like a spiderweb, dripping down in thick globules. 

And James was there.  He stood stock-still, the faceless grey liquid steel man behind him.  Embracing him.  Moist, metallic tentacles wrapped around his arms and legs and torso, gripping his neck and face like long-fingered hands.  Bleeding into his skin.  Enveloping him, like a defective superhero’s suit.  The grey man was James.  James was the grey man.  His eyes were wide, bulging, and empty.

There was a shuffle at his feet.  Greg looked down - and doubled over with nausea.  What was left of a brown-haired young woman lay on the ground.  Her throat had been torn out; her head folded back unpleasantly, unspooled muscles and tendons splayed like streamers.  

A creature buried itself in her chest.  In a gruesome second, Greg recognized the thing as the steel wool hamster, now the size of a Rottweiler.  Its metal fur curled menacingly like a tangle of barbed wire.  It jerked upwards, turned its large face towards Greg.  Its putty yellow eyes glowed with malice.  It clutched a hunk of red meat between jagged teeth.  With a turn of his stomach, Greg realized the chunk of flesh was the dead girl’s heart.  

The creature tossed its head, swallowing the heart whole.  Then, it redirected its rabid attentions towards Greg.  

It lunged.  

Greg, in a fit of survival instinct, grabbed his earbuds and forced them into his ears.  James’s reality-altering EDM creation was blocked out by DMX.

The steel wool monster gnashed its teeth angrily, pressed up against an invisible force field, restrained like a dog on a chain.  Greg turned up the volume on his iPod.  He knew he didn’t have much time.  Avoiding the living spikes, he found his way to James’s computer.  He tore wires, slammed the laptop against the wall, kicked and stomped and smashed the expensive sound board until it was reduced to a shattered hunk of plastic and rubber and metal.  

Finally, he pulled out his earphones.  

He’d returned to James’s room.  The air smelled like pennies, with an under-scent of sulfur.  The girl’s destroyed body rested in a pool of blood and entrails.  And of course, there was James.

James lay on his back, bloodshot eyes wide and unblinking.  As Greg stood over him, he barely seemed to breathe, his chest contracting weakly under a pit-stained tank top.  Greg saw a new marking on his arm - a long, blue-grey bruise.  Like the hickey on the back of his neck, it caught the light like rusting metal.  

His lips moved.  He forced out words.  

“Nine…hundred.  Ninety five.  More.”

Greg fled the apartment.  He banged on a neighbor’s door, called the police.  The cops arrived to find the young woman, dead, on the bedroom floor.  

James had disappeared.

\*\*\*\*\*

“The Bushwick concert, that wasn’t the first,” Greg insisted.  “There’ve been others, in South America.  Ibiza.  He keeps moving.  Keeps changing his name.  He never allows himself to get too popular.  It’s always small shows… thirty people or less.  Because if he were some big celebrity…”

*He’d attract too much attention.*  Yeah.  Fame would be anathema to a creature like DJ Erich Zann.  Best to chip away slowly, a couple dozen doomed fans at a time.  

“What did it mean?” I asked Greg.  “The last thing he said to you.  Nine hundred, ninety five more.”

Greg met my eyes.  *He knew.  He knew I knew.*  

“That girl,” he said.  “Her name was Devyn Slade.  She’d been an art student, recently aged out of foster care.  And she wasn’t his first, either.”

What composure remained on Greg’s face broke down.

“Four other girls went missing, around the same time.  Over the next few years the police found all of them, buried in shallow graves on opposite ends of the county.  They never connected the dead girls back to James, not officially.  But… well, I did.  Because they’d been mauled.  Their hearts torn out of their chests.”

\*\*\*\*\*

Greg’s story ended there.  Mine… didn’t.

That night, at The P\*\*\*\*\*, I’d killed the music. DJ Erich Zann’s black automaton roadies melted into gelatinous black puddles.

Heart stuck in my throat, stomach in knots, I eased over to a puddle.  I extended a toe.

*Bump, bump, bump.*

The bass started up again.  The puddles bubbled in time with the music.  Gummy arms popped out of the mess, pressed against the ground, formed torsos.

“I said, no entry until ten.”

I whirled, away from the re-emerging humanoids and towards that grating, robotic, alien voice.  My pulse pounded in my ears.  Beads of perspiration formed on my palms and the back of my neck.  My neurons rejected my eyes, and I couldn’t breathe.  

James Hadley - DJ Erich Zann - stood in front of me, shirtless and bare-faced.  

His flesh - if you could call it flesh - alternated between metallic blue-black patches that refracted light and rotting dark-green tissue that sloughed, hanging off him, dripping foul-smelling liquid.  Bits of his arms had disintegrated, revealing silver-stained muscle.  He had no nose and no lips and no teeth, just gaping black holes.  He was bald; black mold extended across his scalp.  His bulging eyes, cloudy-white, stood out in bas relief - and, though I couldn’t see pupils, I felt fury laser-focused on me.  

Footsteps, behind me.  His black putty roadies had stabilized.  

And they’d blocked all the exits.

What saved my life that night was a combination of luck and the venue owners’ carelessness.  I’d bartended many events there.  So I knew, behind the stage, a secret trapdoor and hidden staircase lead to the basement.  I knew the basement was accessible via another staircase that opened, through cellar doors, to the street.  And I knew the owners constantly forgot to lock said cellar doors.

I ran, then walked, then collapsed into a heap and cried.  Then ran again, walked, cried, rinse and repeat, until I sank onto a bench along Eastern Parkway in Crown Heights, legs too numb to move.  I should have, I realized then, called the police.  

*The police would’ve thought I was high*, I told myself.  *And even if they’d believed me, it wouldn’t have made any difference.*

\*\*\*\*\*

Twenty-nine people died at the concert.  The youngest was nineteen; the oldest, fifty-one.  They were students, baristas, poets, stockbrokers, teachers, biologists, taxi drivers, spouses, and parents.  Music lovers, who’d only wanted to lose themselves for a night.  

Their loved ones were told they’d all died in an electrical fire, due to rats biting through the wires.  The press, outside of a few local outfits, didn’t pay the incident as much attention as I thought it deserved.  Who cares about a few dead hipsters, right?  But many people - family and friends, reporters, low-ranking cops and paramedics who’d seen the aftermath - weren’t satisfied with the answers they were given.  And, as often happens when answers are scarce and higher-ups shut down, certain individuals started asking questions a little louder.  

For instance, if all twenty-nine victims died in a fire, why had autopsies revealed no smoke in their lungs?  Why were the bodies they’d recovered, recovered in pieces?  How had an electrical fire torn limbs from sockets with the force of an elephant, or bitten into chests with jaws as wide as a shark’s?  Why was every single recovered torso missing its heart?

And - as a frustrated investigator asked, while showing me a photograph I’m sure he wasn’t supposed to reveal - what was the meaning of the words written on the wall?

I stared at the words, scrawled in jagged letters, as though by the nails of a broken and bleeding hand.

*5 MORE.*
