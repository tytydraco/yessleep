“Don’t forget,” I heard myself say. 

I seemed to be seated upright on the bottom bunk of my bed. It was night and the room was entirely quiet. I noticed that my clothes were damp and my heartrate was up, though I couldn't recall for the life of me the dream that had awoken me with such a fright. I looked around at the other bunks in the to see that the boys were still fast asleep. I pulled my blanket over me and closed my eyes without thinking too much more about it.

The next afternoon, one of the councilors had come into our cabin in a huff. “Where’s Brendon?” she asked sternly, “his instructor said that he wasn’t at crafts this morning. Do you know where he is?”

We all shook our heads.

“Well, when did he wake up? Did you notice what he was up to when you got dressed for breakfast?” 

Again, we shook our heads.

The councilor frowned and crossed her arms. “Guys, he’s your bunkmate. Did no one see him go out this morning?”

The councilor was adamant that Brendon was last seen in our cabin, no matter how much we told her that Brendon had never been assigned to our cabin. “We’ve always had an extra bunk,” we told her, which prompted the councilor to run off in a hurry to go over the registration forms with the head councilor.

That night, I awoke again to the words “Don’t forget” being uttered by my mouth in an urgent whisper. Again, I was sweaty and again I looked around the cabin to see that not a single detail about the bedroom was amiss. I was a light sleeper and wondered if it wasn’t the sound of a raccoon scrambling around outside that was waking me up. Unsatisfied that I still didn’t know for certain, I went back to sleep.

I was awoken by the councilor the next morning, looming over my bed. “Hi. Yes. Good morning. Are you awake? Where’s Derrick?” she asked.

“Derrick?” I repeated groggily.

“You can try lying to me that Brendon was never in your room, but I know for a fact that Derrick was with you yesterday when I was last here. They snuck out of camp, didn’t they? And you’re covering for them then? Well, if that’s the case, then I really hope you know where they are for your own sake, because there will be severe consequences to be had if you don’t help us find them this instant.”

I was at a loss. I didn’t know how else to explain it. How could they not know that the cabin had always belonged to just Michael and I? But no matter how much I pleaded my case, the councilor unfairly refused to believe me, even when Michael came by and told her the same thing. She told us that we weren’t allowed to leave our cabin for the rest of camp, while the rest of them formed a search party to go out and look for the two missing boys.

When it was just Michael and I alone, I scoffed, “Can you believe that they forgot that it's just been us in here? And then they go and yell when they're the ones that can't keep track of people. They should really know by now that it was their mistake.”

Michael nodded along. “It’s weird though,” he said, and with shift in demeanor, he added, “can I show you something?”". He rolled up his sleeve to reveal his forearm, the words, “Don’t Forget”, sprawled across his skin in black marker.

Seeing the phrase sent a current down my spine. I recalled saying the phrase that same morning. I told him exactly that and he looked back at me with a solemn face.

That night, after making plans to take turns standing guard, I awoke with a jump when I heard a thud against the floor. Despite it being dark, the room was lit in the center by the fluorescent white of a flashlight that lay on the floor.

“Michael?” I called. There came no answer. Across the room, I noticed that his bed was empty.

“Michael?” I called again as I got out of bed. Still, the cabin was silent.

I picked up the flashlight and noticed that the handle was still warm. I shined the light towards the washroom. “Michael?” I said again, my voice coming out unevenly. The black void of the entrance stared back at me in silence.

I crept closer, the light in my hand beginning to shake. Shadows melted as I crossed the threshold. From out of my periphery, I caught a glimpse of something black, and I turned in time to see the light flash in my eyes, as I looked directly at the bathroom mirror. On it, written in black marker, were the words, “Don’t Look Away”.

I stood there frozen. And as it slowly started to dawn on me, I became aware of a crunching from inside the bedroom. I shined my light into the room, and where the flashlight had once been, there was now a puddle of crimson on the floor, like wider than a coaster. As I watched in shock, I saw another droplet fall from somewhere above, and land in the puddle with a ping.

With a weight in the pit of stomach, I inched out of the washroom with the flashlight aimed just high enough up the ceiling to see. In the light I could see a pair of sneakers hanging in the air. They were shaking, violently. I gasped, and leaned out more, until I could see the frayed jeans of Michael’s spasming legs, dangling from the rafters above from a hideous mass in the shadows. Bones crunched from the jaws of something large. As my light illuminated it more, I could see that its skin was nearly a translucent white, and its cold, lifeless, black marble eyes glittered in the light, without a hint of interest anywhere in them. Limbs with needle-like fingers held the remnants of the body in place as it funneled them into its mouth, blood dripping from the creatures jaws in globs as it mixed with sticky saliva.

My instincts were to run, but I hesitated as I remembered the message etched on the bathroom mirror. What would happen if I looked away?  I remembered the councilors being in my room, insisting that the two lost boys had lived with us, and I remembered the words that I had woken up to on each of those mornings. *Had I somehow forgotten?* Had I known those two boys as well as I knew Michael, and had somehow been made to forget them? Looking at the last of Michael's shoes disappearing into the gnashing jaws, I wondered if I would forget him just as easily if I looked away.

I felt sick. I wanted to run. But I worried that I wouldn’t be able to warn anyone else if I did. But as the jaws finally closed, I realized that I would shortly be next. The creatures eyes rolled towards me as I prayed to God that I wouldn’t just forget the horror the second that I looked away.

And as my eyes shifted towards the door, and I shifted my weight to run, I thought to myself... *“Don’t forget”.*
