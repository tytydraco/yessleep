It was a long drive. The kind that makes you feel like the world outside doesn’t exist anymore—just the stretch of road ahead and the black nothing swallowing the rest. The highway was dead quiet. No streetlights, no passing cars, just the glow of our high beams catching glimpses of the trees.

It was me, my boyfriend Will, and our two friends, Charlie and Sam. Four of us, packed into Will’s car, heading home. We weren’t talking much. The radio was on, but barely—a low murmur of music that neither filled the space nor broke the silence.

Then Will did something strange.

Without a word, he flicked on the interior lights.

The sudden brightness felt like an interrogation lamp in the middle of the void. Charlie winced, raising a hand to shield his eyes.

“Dude, what the hell?”

Will didn’t answer.

I turned to him, about to ask what was up—then I saw it.

Her.

Sitting directly behind him.

I know she wasn’t there before. I **know**. But there she was, her skin too pale, hair hanging too dark around a face that didn’t quite make sense. Not in the way a person should. She was too still. Like she was waiting.

For me to see her.

I forced myself to swallow, but my mouth was dry. *A shadow. A trick of the light.* That’s what I told myself.

And then she **tilted her head**.

And looked at me.

I grabbed Will’s arm. Hard. “Switch seats with me.”

He frowned. “What?”

“Just—” I scrambled for an excuse. “I don’t like this seat. Just switch.”

I needed something—**someone**—between me and her.

Will sighed, but we swapped. His body was warm next to mine, grounding me. I dared to glance in the mirror again.

She was still there.

And she was still watching me.

Charlie shifted in his seat. The air inside the car had changed—thick now, like the moment before a storm. Then, without a word, he raised a hand and made the sign of the cross.

The second he did, the temperature in the car dropped.

I felt it. We all did.

A pressure, invisible but crushing, **pulled** against the space around us. Sam made a soft sound in the back, barely a breath. I clenched my eyes shut.

*Don’t look again. Don’t look again. Just let it pass.*

And then—

A shift.

Like something let go.

I opened my eyes.

The seat behind Will was empty.

No one spoke. No one questioned it.

Will exhaled slowly. Charlie reached over and shut the lights off. The darkness rushed back in, hugging the car like a second skin.

Eventually, Sam let out a laugh—thin and brittle. “Guess we picked up a hitchhiker.”

A joke. But no one really laughed.

An hour later, we stopped for gas. Sam and Charlie went inside to grab snacks. Will got out to stretch. I stayed in the car, scrolling my phone, trying to shake the feeling in my chest.

Then—out of the corner of my eye—I saw it.

The back seat.

The middle cushion.

It was still **pressed down**.

Like someone had just been sitting there.

I stared. The indentation was deep, distinct. My breath turned shallow as I reached out. My fingers brushed the fabric.

It was warm.

And then—

The radio crackled.

A voice cut through the static.

“—Authorities advise caution. Subject is considered unstable. Last seen near Route 6 at approximately 10 PM. The escaped patient, a young woman, is known to enter vehicles undetected—”

My stomach flipped.

The cushion. The radio. The cold grip of realization crawling up my spine.

She wasn’t a ghost.

We never heard her get in.

And worse?

We never heard her **leave**.

The car door opened. Will slid into the driver’s seat. “Everything okay?”

I opened my mouth. Then closed it.

No. No, something is **wrong**.

But I nodded. “Yeah. Let’s go.”

Charlie and Sam climbed back in, tossing snacks into the back. The car rumbled back onto the road, the darkness swallowing us once more.

I glanced at my phone. My last text was sent three hours ago.

But the drive should’ve only taken two.

I stiffened. *That’s not right.*

Charlie frowned, rummaging through his bag. “Where’s my knife?”

Will’s knuckles tightened on the wheel. “Didn’t you leave it in the glovebox?”

Charlie yanked it open. Empty.

No one spoke.

Something about the air felt **off** again.

I swallowed hard, reaching into my pocket. My fingers brushed something—small, crumpled. I pulled it out.

A **motel key**.

Not mine.

I stared at it, my heartbeat hammering. A memory stirred—hazy, disjointed.

A dimly lit motel room. The smell of bleach. A girl sitting on the edge of the tub, whispering something I couldn’t hear.

A **flash of red** in the sink.

A voice—*“We can’t leave her like this.”*

Another voice—*“She’s already dead.”*

I gasped, the air rushing from my lungs.

We never picked her up.

She was **already with us**.

And then—so quietly I almost didn’t hear—

Will whispered,

“…what if she never left?”
