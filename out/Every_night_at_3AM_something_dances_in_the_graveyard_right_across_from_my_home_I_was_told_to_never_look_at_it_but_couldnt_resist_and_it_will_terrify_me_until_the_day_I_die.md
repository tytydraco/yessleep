A month ago, I moved into an apartment that had a giant window overlooking a cemetery. 

When I met my next-door neighbor, some of the first words out of her mouth were, “don’t ever look into the graveyard at 3AM.” She had the same view of the cemetery out her window. Of course, I asked why. 

She said, “there’s a shadow dancer, and we cannot disturb it.” I flinched but dug in deeper, “what is a shadow dancer?” My neighbor had to be about 65 years old. She wore jean shorts with tall, striped socks, a Grateful Dead t-shirt, and had no bra on even though she had big, sagging boobs. 

“I just made up that name as I didn’t know what else to call it,” she said. “Some have seen… a supernatural entity… a ghost… I don’t know… that likes to dance in the cemetery at that time. Not always… but you just want to be really careful as you don’t want to disturb it.” 

I think she realized how freaked out my face became and tried to change the subject by saying how a great community garden lay just around the corner and that rent control may be more fantastic than sex. 

When I toured the place, nobody mentioned to me about ghosts in the graveyard. The building exuded charm. Gingerbread trim. White picket fence. Rent control. Eight units. Four on top. Four below.  A parking lot in the back, between the building and the cemetery. A wall separated the properties. There was both a front door and a back door, with my own private set of back stairs that led to the parking lot. 

Having a cemetery across the way didn’t really bother me. It actually sounded peaceful as I had moved out of my last place because of noisy neighbors. I told her all this. She assured me that since she’d lived there, which had been over twenty years, there had only been one issue when she first moved in. And it became the reason she warns everyone now. 

The cemetery lay behind the building. I rented the upstairs end unit which was the closest to it. Mine and my neighbor’s units were the only ones that overlooked the cemetery because a mausoleum building and some trees blocked the other units’ views. 

She told me that past neighbors, who lived in my place, and other neighbors, who had lived in the building a long time, told her stories. I asked for more details. But she had to go to the YMCA for her swim class. So, she told me to, “just close your blinds at night, so you’re not tempted to even glance out there and we’ll talk more about it later.” 

I started unpacking and designing my room. I couldn’t help but stand at the large window that overlooked the boneyard. I beheld such a beautiful view. Being on the second floor, much of the well-maintained grounds could be seen. The tall trees and vibrant green lawns seemed more like a park. I’ve lived in the city all my life, and in apartments to boot, and this by far exceeded the best views I ever had. 

Later that night, I gazed out the window as a crescent moon shined bright, casting a magical light over the burial ground, and spilled into my room. At that moment, I couldn’t fathom keeping my blinds closed at night. 

I decided right then and there that I wouldn’t keep my blinds closed, ever. The window was one of the main reasons I fell in love with the place. 

That night I went to bed and for some reason I woke up in the middle of the night. I looked at my clock which read 2:57AM. I didn’t normally wake up in the middle of night but had to pee. I thought of the 3AM rule and glanced at my window. I thought about looking because this had to be preposterous, right? 

Earlier, when my neighbor returned, I got to ask her what had happened before with the previous tenants. She told me that she didn’t know specifics but that the people immediately moved out after. She had just moved in herself so didn’t know them well enough yet to share contact information. She said she just heard the screaming and when she went to see what happened, the whole family looked white as snow. The mother had gone into cardiac arrest and had to be taken away by ambulance.

I went to the bathroom and decided not to look. Why tempt fate on my first night in my new place. 

The next day, I told my best friend about this. She laughed her ass off and said, “this has to be some kind of prank!” I thought that would be a pretty dick move. My friend told me that when she moved into one of her first apartments that one of her neighbors told her that the building had an underground pool, and the entrance lay just around the building. My friend looked and looked but couldn’t find it anywhere. She went back to her neighbors who were all giggling. There was no pool. They then brought her food and drinks as welcoming gifts. 

My neighbors didn’t bring me anything. I hadn’t even met my neighbor below as supposedly he’s a traveling salesman and barely home. 

That night, I went to knock on my neighbor’s door to ask her more and test my friend’s theory. But I saw that her lights were off and her parking space empty. My parking space sits right next to hers. 

I went to bed and thought of my friend’s funny prank. My neighbor did seem kind of out there so maybe she was playing a joke on me. 

I fell asleep but once again woke up at 2:57AM. I thought this had to be some kind of subconscious thing. My mind totally consumed by this 3AM rule. It should be noted that I never did rules well. 

I had to pee so got up and walked by my window. I thought of looking again but didn’t. The crescent moon cast a soft light. 

As I walked back into my room, the clock ticked to 3AM. I looked at my window and then back at my bed. Oh, what the hell, I thought, let’s just see… 

I ambled over to my window and gazed out. The cemetery rested quiet and tranquil. Nothing moved. Nothing seemed out of place. The tall trees shadowed parts of the grounds. The whole place looked enchanting. 

I thought to myself, see this isn’t anything and probably a prank and what a great joke. I turned to go back to bed when something grabbed my attention. 

When I looked back, I saw something stir in the shadows.

Right then, I should have run back to my bed and never looked out there again! Yet, I couldn’t pull my eyes away. 

I watched the inky-black silhouette then move into the moonlight. I couldn’t see its features. But it was a person. A slender woman. Its hair looked long, and it wore a black, flowing dress. 

She danced modern style as if she were performing some type of story but with dance. Her moves were graceful but strange and a little creepy. 

I then stepped back so it wouldn’t be able to see me very well. 

Yet just then it stopped dead in its motion, its head tilting up towards me. Even though complete blackness shrouded its face, I just knew it looked right at me. 

I froze like a statue. My whole body puckered up. What the hell should I do? 

It then ran through the graveyard straight towards me! About a hundred yards lay between us. I started shaking and my mind raced. 

My vehicle was parked right there, just below my window and next to the wall. It would get me immediately if I went for it. I thought about running out the front door and down the street or maybe to a neighbor. 

The thing moved fast, and it got to the wall and started climbing it. My limbs wouldn’t move. I stopped breathing. I still couldn’t see its features. It seemed like it was just a shadow. 

It glanced up at me again and then ran right under my window to the building. To my private set of back stairs that led right up to my place. 

I heard its feet pounding up the steps. 

I bolted out of my room to the front door. I heard it banging on my back door. Incessant banging. I exited my front door and knocked on my neighbor’s door. Her car still wasn’t there but I wanted to try. She didn’t answer. 

I then moved down the front stairs but stopped when I saw the shadow lurking at the bottom of the steps. 

Abruptly, the dim corridor light went out. I screamed. 

The thing then rushed up the stairs at me. Its footsteps booming through the hall. 

I quickly scrambled back inside, slammed my door shut, and locked it. 

The thing banged on the other side. Slamming its body against the door. Rattling my door handle. Trying to get in. 

I backed up into the living room. I dialed 9XX on my cell phone. They answered and I quickly rambled on how someone was trying to break into my place. But then my call dropped. I tried to call again but I had no service. I screamed for help! 

The thing then stopped banging. 

Meanwhile the whole place had gotten colder. I could see my breath. I could also hear the thing just outside. I heard scratching on the wood door. 

After what seemed like an eternity, I heard the Dancer move away from the front door. Its nails then scratched against the outside walls as it stepped down the front stairs. Slowly, one by one. 

I stood there for a moment not knowing what to do. I then compelled myself to go back to my bedroom. I wanted to see if it would go back to the cemetery. I stayed in the shadows, hoping, praying it wouldn’t see me again. 

I then saw it sauntering back to the wall. It slinked over but then stopped. It sat there on the wall staring up at my window. I held my breath as time seemed to stop. 

The thing then waved at me and jumped over into the cemetery. It strolled back to where I originally first saw it and then it vanished. There was nothing around it. Nowhere it could have hid. It just disappeared into thin air. 

My mind rattled. I couldn’t believe it waved at me. What did that even mean? Was it saying goodbye or hello? What would it have done to me if it got inside? 

I stayed up all night, hiding in the shadows, and staring out the window at the bone yard. Thankfully, I didn’t see anything.  None of my neighbors came to check on me.  Some of them must have heard my screams. Did they all know about the shadow dancer and just assumed the worst? 

The next day, I checked my front door. Scratched on the door in janky letters read, “welcome home.” My mind spun, just like her wave, what the hell did this mean? 

I told my neighbor what happened. She felt guilty that she didn’t warn me well enough. 

I then moved out that day. I broke my year lease. They can take me to court. I don’t care. I’ll file bankruptcy instead of staying in that place another night! 

As of right now, I will never look out any of my windows at night ever again in fear of seeing that Shadow Dancer. Yet even though it haunts my nightmares, is it absurd that I want to know what it is, where it comes from, and what it wants? 

If you live across from a cemetery, be warned, as one may dwell in your graveyard…
