I wear a sleep mask. 

   The sun is so bright through the massive window in my room that it wakes me up if I don't. It also lets in an ungodly amount of heat, though I'm used to that by now. I have curtains, but I didn't bother to measure, so they are the exact size of the window, which isn't what you want in a curtain. You want the curtain to be larger than the window, so the light doesn't barge through anytime there's a gust of wind in the room. 

   Outdoors, I wear sunglasses. Even at night. The flourescent streetlights cause a pain in my eyes like someone is actively hammering a nail into them. And everyone insists on driving lifted trucks, with those stupid xenon headlights or whatever because they saw it in GTA and thought it would be cool. It may be cool to you, but to me it's like staring directly into the sun. They always have their brights on, I guess. 

   I also sleep like a vampire, which probably fits my all black aesthetic, or like a mummy, but horizontally. On my back, arms to the side rather than crossed over my chest, in a sleeping bag that feels kinda like a coffin. I sleep on a bed, but no blankets because I roll around like a rotisserie chicken before and during my sleep. I might have that thing where your body isn't locked into place when your brain shuts off. For example: One time I lost a pillow for 3 days. It was under my head when I went to sleep, and when I woke up, it was nowhere to be found. It's like it glitched out of the universe. Like it fell into the backrooms or something. I must've gone down to retrieve it on the third night, though, because when I woke up it was back under my head. And I only have one pillow, so there's no mistaking it for a different one. 

   I was having some insomnia trouble, not because of the sun, and saw on Google something about sleeping on your back being the most efficient way to get to sleep. So I've been doing that for a few weeks, and it actually works super well. I fall asleep within a minute, two at the most, when previously it would take hours. I also have a white noise machine to drown out whatever sounds may be happening around me. I don't know if it's bad for your hearing, but I keep it right next to my bed, essentially just by my head. I could use it as a pillow it's so close. 

   There is a downside to sleeping on your back though. You are apparently more likely to get sleep paralysis. The article left that part out, it seems. That's also been happening for a couple of weeks, having started not long after I changed my sleeping position. After the fourth time, you'd think I'd stop, but I can't sleep any other way. 

   So I had a falling dream, which is pretty common, but when I startled awake, my body didn't startle. I was frozen in place, as a searing pain passed through my nervous system like I was struck by lightning. I guess my body tried to jump, but couldn't. And then I felt that familiar sensation, footsteps on my bed. It's not an animal, because I don't have any pets, and I only ever feel two feet. At least I assume they're feet. 

   This is also when you realize that a sleep mask is a double-edged sword. If you can't move to take it off, then all you can "see" is pitch black, even with your eyes open. However this creature's proximity to my face is given away by it's surprisingly cold breath. It never speaks, which I think is intentional in order to increase the fear level. I would try and talk to it if I could move my mouth and vocal chords. 

   This is by no means the first time this has happened, though. Actually, it happens almost every night, and yet the fear never goes away. However, I do tend to miss him a tiny bit when he doesn't show, kinda like a part of my routine was skipped over. But tonight he was there, like my own personal, potentially demonic, alarm clock. 

   I've gotten pretty good at waking my body up now though, since it happens so often. The trick is to start with the fingers and toes. Just keep trying to wiggle them until it actually starts to work. I was pretty quick at it tonight too, however he left, just before I could get my whole hand going.  He vanished without a sound, just as he came in, like he was carried away on the wind, and now I'm up for the rest of the night. I figured I might as well start my day, get on the grind, even if it is 3:30 in the morning. 

   It's pretty chilly out tonight, but my all black outer layer keeps me from feeling it too much. As usual, I quietly slank (slinked? slunk?) out the door, sunglasses on, and started my seemingly eternal trek. Not really eternal, maybe like 20 minutes or so, but that feels like quite awhile when you're walking. I did my best to avoid the street lights, slipping off of the sidewalk as I encountered them, or if one of those tall trucks passed through. Do they never sleep? Why would anyone be out this early in the morning? 

   Just barely on time, 3:55. There were more people out tonight, but that's the result of it being Friday night. Or maybe Saturday? All the days run together for me. As I passed by the front of your house, I snuck a glance in the window, making sure you were actually home, and not out with one of these nuisance teens that like to rev their engines when they pass through the neighborhood. Sure enough, you were there. If I had the ability, I imagine this would've been the moment where a big dopamine rush occured. Regardless of the chemical response, I silently crept in through the window in your bathroom that you always forget to lock. When will you figure that out? When will you realize that that's how I get in? As quiet as I am, your white noise machine picks up the slack for me, because I've definitely knocked things down before. 

   I know your bedroom door has a lock on it, so why don't you use it? It's not like I phased through a wall or anything, I just passed through the openings that you'd left for me. Intentional or not, an unlocked entrance counts as an invitation, you know. 

   As I peer down at you, fast asleep with that cheap, plastic, noisy pillow you got from Amazon, I can finally remove my sunglasses. I hate wearing them, especially at night. It's so hard to see in the dark with sunglasses on. But my eyes would give me away to anyone driving past, or peering curiously out of their window. Did you know, the interior lights in a cop car are red because that wave of light travels the least? As in, it's the hardest to see from far away. I call bs on that though, because my eyes are all that people ever see. 

   As I step toward your bed, I always have the same thought: "It's so cute how you swaddle yourself in that sleeping bag." And convenient too! It makes it so much easier to step around you as I make my way toward your face. When I get to the perfect spot, I bend down and get just face to face with you. 

   "Here goes nothing" I think as I scream in your face as loud as I possibly can. There's no way you don't hear me, but you never seem to react in any way. I always try it as many times as I can before you get that damn finger to wiggle. Tonight I only got one scream out, and 'poof!' just like that, I'm carried away, back to my bed,  to startle awake like a falling dream, just as the sun peaks over the horizon, and barges through my window.
