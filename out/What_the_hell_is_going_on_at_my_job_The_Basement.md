Hey y'all. Sorry it's been like a week. I've been pretty busy dealing with this shit and actual work. I did end up going back to work, I couldn't take not knowing what happened. And I wanted to get in touch with the other closers. Thanks for the suggestions! They've been helpful and good material to think on. It actually helped guide me a bit. This is only going to be about the next day, I wanted to break it up so I didn't write a book for y'all. I'm at a place where I have a little more spare time now, sorry to keep y'all waiting!

So, the next day I went into work still very much freaked out and horribly curious. Luckily  I came in before the opener left so I could ask her about the cameras. Once I clocked in and put my stuff away I went to find her. She was in the back taking care of the boarding dogs and prepping dinners. I jumped right in to help her grabbing some bowls for dinners and to talk. 

"Mona!" I called out, waving. She waved back though she seemed really out of it. 

"Hey! Good, I need to talk to you." She mentioned as she sorted through the feeding guides and dog food brought by the parents for their pups. She updated me on the work stuff first, which dogs left or any new or important info about the dogs staying. We went back and forth a bit as we finished prepping the meals, then she touched my shoulder. "Also, listen. I did watch the cameras from last night. I want you to come into the office with me." I nodded, muttering an 'okay' and followed her back to the office. I could feel my heart beat- it almost felt like I was in trouble. We both took seats at the desk with security monitors. 

"So, it was really weird. I saw you left at like 11:40 last night," She shuffled back through the video and paused it. "and I was wondering if you saw anything inside? You can see a light shining from outside, like someone with a flashlight looking in." She looked at me, waiting. I swallowed, my mind racing.

"Well... Maybe? It's hard to say. I heard something from outside but when I looked in... It was too dark, even with my phone light."

She nodded turning back to the monitors. "That tracks. Watch." She played the video starting from 11:40pm. You can see me turning off the lights, turning the alarm on, and locking up for the night. After I left it was still for a minute until there was a weird graininess at the top corner by the basement door. It was small and slight at first but the speckling and weird darkness started growing, shifting, and getting faster. It moved first just around the top corner but slowly drifted down towards the floor. "Do you see that?" Mona asked pointing at the screen.

"Y-yeah... I do." I felt my breath catch in a lump in my throat. So I wasn't losing it. Here was proof. 

"I've seen this before but never this bad. " She explained leaning her head onto her hand. The mass shifted, getting darker and darker and growing until it encompassed most of the bottom corner, surrounding it with darkness. Soon it was the same kind of unnatural black I saw even though this was a night vision camera. "Like, what the fuck even is this?"

"I have no fucking clue. That's so scary." I watched my light shine in from outside, still not penetrating the thick inky black depths. "It quite honestly scared the shit out of me. I thought about never coming back." 

"Thank god you did!" She put a hand on my shoulder again, pleading with her eyes. "I appreciate it so much. Listen, this is wild. Will you be okay closing tonight?"

"Yeah." I told her softly, though I really don't know why. "I'll keep an eye out and be careful." She gave me a look of concern, I'm sure I didn't sound confident. 

"If you need anything at all, just call me. I'm here for you, okay?" 

"Okay Mona. Thank you." We both stood up when I remembered to ask. "Oh, hey, actually. Can I get the numbers of the old closers? I want to see if they saw anything weird like this." I was nervous. She turned to me smiling, but it seemed... off. 

"Oh, yeah! Great idea! I'll reach out to them for any info. I'll let you know what they say. You can leave the detective work up to me!" She winked. I nodded with an 'allright' and we both left the office, getting back to work. 

I was worried and anxious, and the whole interaction with Mona seemed off, but I did trust her fully. She had been close with me since I started and was one of the only people I could rely on. I just hoped she had the same urgency as I did to find answers. I'm sure she doesn't want to lose another employee though. Replacing employees is no where near as easy as it used to be. Especially with how our business paid. I started doing my back duties much jumpier than I had ever been with all the dog noises. I also felt this creeping sensation of being watched though I summed that up to being extra heightened after last nights events.

I waded through most of my shift with unease but also without incident. Everything went fairly smooth save for a few unruly dogs, but that was normal. I chose not to wear my earbuds that night so I didn't get surprised by anything.
