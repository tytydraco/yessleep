I don't want to be extraordinary. I don't want to be weird. If I could choose a superpower, it would be invisibility. I don't want to stand out. Which is why, I don't know who to talk to about this.

It started out less noticeable, like something out of the corner of my eye while I was walking down the hallway at school. Or, waking up in the middle of the night and thinking I saw something in the corner, but it was gone after I turned the light on. I think that's a pretty basic, human experience. Maybe I'm slightly paranoid. But, it's gotten worse and more frequent. By frequent, multiple times last week alone.

On Monday, I was heading to class, it was later in the day and overcast outside. This is important because in this particular hallway, due to the massive windows we have above the cafeteria and the weird designs on the panes, a cloudy day can make different shapes and figures dance on the walls depending on how the light hits them. 

However, I caught something out of the corner of my eye that stood out. It wasn't on the wall, where a shadow should be, it was in the center of the hallway. It was tall, taller than me (standing right at 6 foot), definitely a humanoid shape, but longer and ganglier than a human could possibly be. It had no face, no discernable features, and it stood there frozen, in the middle of the rushing students. Until I moved. Then, it's faceless head followed me as I rounded the corner to class. 

It didn't actually follow me, though, and it was gone by the time class was over. No one else seemed to have noticed it. 

Tuesday was even more unsettling.

Everything at school was fine that day.  Grandma picked me up afterwards, but instead of going home, we were going to visit my uncle, at his new house which was near the school. Though for context, my school's kind of in the middle of nowhere. 

We began the drive, and the late evening sun shone bright orange in the windshield, which left us squinting as we continued onward. We were driving through orchards, and the trees cast long shadows down the road. It was actually quite pretty. 

Maybe I was more tired than I thought, or maybe my imagination played a trick on me, but all of a sudden, a clear-as-day man was in the middle of our lane as our car barreled towards him on the unmarked, county road. He had orange plaid on (the color of the sunset we'd been watching), with blue jeans and leather boots. I could make out his dark hair and dark eyes as we got unimaginably close.

“GRANDMA!” I screamed in horror as I braced for impact and witnessed our car plow through him, but then he was gone. No impact. No guy. Nothing. 

“What?! What happened?!” Grandma looked over to me frantically, and did an outstanding job controlling the car despite her fanatical passenger. 

I just sat there, jaw open, and said, “There was a guy. I saw a guy. We were going to hit him…” 

“What guy? Where?” She asked, genuinely concerned. 

“I- I don't know. He's gone. Or, wasn't real? But, I saw him so clearly...”

Grandma didn't question me much further, and the rest of our ride was uneventful. 

Next was Wednesday night. 

I was well past when I should've been asleep for a school night, but I have an affinity for drawing, and the time between homework and falling asleep is the only time available to draw during the week. 

Knowing I was going to regret my choices in the morning, I slowly lifted my legs so that my cat would get the message to jump off my lap. I gathered all my pencils into their pouch and went to place them off to the side of my bed with my drawing pad, when I noticed a dark shadow moving up the wall. A place where nothing in my room should've been causing a shadow. 

A sense of dread came over me, but I slowly followed the dark figure up, from the awkward position of having my knees on the bed, half of myself hanging over the floor, one arm bracing myself, and craning my neck to look above me; I couldn't have felt more vulnerable. 

The tall, thin shadow stretched to where the wall meets the ceiling, and it sprawled onto the ceiling itself. Looming directly above me were small, dimly lit, gray eyes. 

My frozen state was broken when, from the corner of my bed, my cat hissed, arching his back, and I saw he was looking directly at the eyes too. There was no mistaking it. 

I scooped him up, and hopped to the other side of the bed, and much like a five year old, hid under my blanket. I slowly peaked out, and the figure was gone. My cat, having had enough of me, wriggled out and went back to his corner at the foot of my bed, his back to me, and seemed to have no worry about what had just happened. 

My heart remained racing, and I barely slept, but I tried to calm myself down because my cat was no longer afraid, so that thing must've been gone. 

Thursday was uneventful, but Friday morning was not.

I woke up. I know I woke up. I sat up, and turned my lamp on. I never wake up before my alarm, so I started to reach for my phone on the bedside table to see the time, when it spoke. 

“I hate you.”

It was a deep, scratchy voice, and I couldn't move. My head faced straight forward, and the voice got right beside me, speaking into my right ear. 

Louder now, “I hate you.” 

Almost hissing, it continued, “I hate you! I hate you! I hate you!”

A silent tear rolled down my cheek, and I silently prayed, “leave me alone, in Jesus name. Leave me alone, in Jesus name!” 

It was all I could think to do.

Yelling now, the voice kept repeating itself, and I kept repeating myself, until all of a sudden it stopped. 

I leaped out of my skin when my alarm went off! I don't know why the blanket is my go to, but I flung it over my head, and darted my hand out to turn it off. Nothing bad happened. I slowly lowered the blanket, and it was just my bedside table, lamp, clock, and phone. 

I grabbed my phone and in one, swift motion, rolled to the other side of the bed. That's when I could hear my grandparents waking up. Before he headed to the shower, I could hear Grandpa mumbling that his alarm didn't go off. 

I'm never the first one awake, but this day I was. My cat's always in my room, but this morning he wasn't. Just me and the voice. Maybe it was a disembodied voice, or maybe it wasn't, I couldn't or wouldn't turn my head to see. 

I got ready for school, and the rest of the day was fine. I slept on the other side of the bed that night. I didn't even dare look at that lamp. 

Saturday morning I needed to talk to someone, so I confided in my grandma about the morning prior. 

She didn't question it. Instead, she told me her story:

Grandma said when she was a girl, she and her sister didn't have a room in the main house, but they stayed in a trailer beside the house. Next to Grandma's bed was a little hole in the wall. 

“At night, after I could hear my sister's snoring begin from across the room,” Grandma recounted, “The Funnies would talk to me.”

“I don't remember what they said now, it's been too long. Their voices came from the hole, and I never answered them. They just talked to me every night. I was afraid at first, but they didn't do anything bad to me. I named them 'The Funnies' to make it less scary. Maybe they told me jokes? Who knows. I didn't tell anyone about them either. I was young, and it was just what happened.” 

Grandma and I talked more that day, and I at least didn't feel as alone. But, my “Funny” doesn't seem so peaceful. In fact, it seems to quite literally hate me, as it chanted that morning. And, it hasn't been back since. But, what will happen when it does make another appearance? 

I still won't touch that lamp, and I close my door all the way so my cat can't leave me in the middle of the night. I stayed up late to type this out, and I have to get to bed now. It's a school night.
