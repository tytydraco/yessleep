I'm panicking a little bit as I type this but I'll try to explain the best I can.

There's a family standing in my driveway. I don't know who they are or why they're here but I know that they're dangerous.

I woke up to a tapping on the window above my bed. It was such a faint *tap tap tap* that if it wasn't dead silent inside my home, I wouldn't be able to hear it. I stared at my blinking alarm clock sat on my bedside table telling me that it was 1:13 am. I assumed the tapping was just from the wind or something so I could eventually fall back asleep but when I started to doze off, the tapping got louder. 

I pulled my blinds down until I heard a click and guided them upwards to have a look outside. I saw a woman, who looked to be about 15, with her face against the frosted glass. She had her hands and her chest pressed against the glass as well and I watched as she used her long slender nails to tap in intervals of 3. Her long black hair covered her forehead and eyebrows and draped down her shoulders. She was wearing barely anything except for a thin, red, spaghetti-strap top and a short black skirt, despite it being the middle of winter, and she was so unbelievably skinny that she looked like she hadn't eaten in weeks. 

I panicked and pulled the blind back down before sprinting to my right, down the hallway, and into my living room before turning the light on and checking to make sure both my front and back door were locked. After doing that I walked back to my living room and sat on the white couch, staring at my wooden front door. Infront of me was another large window with the blind pulled all the way down. 

I suddenly felt the urge to look outside. I once again pulled the blind down until I heard the familier click and guided it upwards but what I saw made me froze, not necessarily out of fear but more out of confusion. 

I should probably mention that my house is sat on a hill so my living room and kitchen is above my garage with stairs leading up to my front door and sort of a ledge infront of my bedroom so I was looking down at my driveway at this point. 

I saw that same young woman that I saw at my bedroom window but this time she wasn't alone. She was standing next to a few more people this time. An older man and an older woman, both looked to be in their mid-50s, and two young boys, most likely twins, who looked to be about 10. They looked like the stereotypical perfect family 

I stared down at them as they stood as still as statues, looking at my garage. I eventually found the courage to step away from the window, basically tip-toeing away, but as my foot reached the ground, I heard the floor make a loud creak. 

The family snapped their heads around to face me. I stood there for a few seconds, not knowing what to do, before I bolted to my bed room.

I grabbed my cell phone from my bedside table before sprinting to my bathroom and locking myself inside. I dialed 000 and sat against the white door, waiting for somebody, anybody, to answer.

After what felt like an eternity, someone picked up.

"000, where is your emergency?" The man asked in a hoarse voice.

"Hello, my name is Jade Lockwell and there's a family in my driveway", I stuttered, "I think they're dangerous, or maybe insane or something. I don't know" 

"Okay, ma'am, lock yourself in the nearest room and tell me your address" the man said.

"XXX stockholm street", I told him, "and I'm in my bathroom" 

As I shook in fear I heard glass shatter from my kitchen. I put my phone down on the floor, silently, and covered my mouth as I sobbed.

There was a family standing in my driveway

Now there's a family standing in my home.
