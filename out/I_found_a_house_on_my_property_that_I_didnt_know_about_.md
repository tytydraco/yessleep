I maneuvered the car down the long, winding road. It was a pile of white chalk and fat stones that barely qualified as a road. I was glad that I hadn’t seen any other vehicles, because it would have been questionable if we could have passed each other without one of us falling into the deep ditches that flanked it. Beyond these ditches, barbwire fences cut through a forest of low trees.

My wife sat in the passenger’s seat. Her eyes were locked on her phone as she studied the map, occasionally taking unsure glances around her. With no landmarks and a bad signal, finding our destination was a difficult task.

I slowed the car to a crawl as we rolled past a sturdy looking metal gate. No trespassing signs lined it. A thick chain and a big padlock were in place. Purple paint adorned the surrounding trees. There was no address on it, but I decided that it wasn’t the one that we were looking for. So, we pushed on.

The metallic colors of beer cans stood out against the rocks and scraggly weeds in the ditch. Other debris joined them, more random splotches of color. Whole bags of garbage and even old furniture had been dumped on that backroad.

We rounded a corner and I suddenly braked. There was another gate. The chain hung off of the connecting post. The lock was nowhere to be seen. A faded For Sale sign was wedged into place on it. I got out and opened the gate.

The journey down the driveway took about five minutes, felt much longer. I was worried that I might bottom out the car as I navigated down the pair of parallel ruts that passed for a road. We longed for the chalk lanes that had gotten us there.

The dirt path curved around a copse of high trees. Behind these we finally found the house.

It was two stories of brick and wood. The place looked new. The site had said that it was only a year old, but I hadn’t really believed it. Angela had. My wife had expressed total faith in the place and the deal. Then I reminded myself that we hadn’t seen the inside yet.

There was a single car parked outside, a newer looking compact. The [realtor ]()greeted us warmly. I was shocked to discover that the inside was just as nice looking. I was expecting a disaster area and found an immaculate interior. We told the realtor that we’d take it.

As we walked back to our car, my wife gave me a little, prideful smile, “See, I can pick ‘em.”

I grinned back at her and wrapped my hand around her waist, “You certainly can. I just don’t understand why it was all so cheap. I was looking for the catch the whole time.”

“It’s thirty minutes from a decent sized town. No grocery store or anything for a half an hour. The metroplex is over three hours away. A lot of people just don’t want to deal with that.”

“True. It also might be haunted.”

She poked me in the ribs, the force somewhere between playful and a bit vicious, “Don’t say that!”

 

\*\*\*

 

Two weeks later.

The moving van started making its way back down the dubious driveway. Now it was time for the monumental task of getting everything unpacked and ourselves settled in. Luckly, we had help. My brother, Daniel, and his girlfriend, Courtney, arrived shortly after the van left.

She was still fairly young and giggly. He was still fairly young, but time in the service had blunted his attitude a bit.

After the usual greetings we got to work. The stairs were our biggest obstacle.

The place that Angela picked to do her art was technically a breakfast nook. I helped her get all of the paints, charcoal, and other material unpacked, but it would be up to her to get it setup how she wanted it.

One thing that she did want me to do was hang those drawings that she had kept for inspiration. A few were charming pictures of cats playing and embarking on little adventures. But most of them were much darker in nature. She had dreamed up frightening creatures and desolate, alien landscapes. These were things from the nightmares of Giger and Goya.

It’s a bit embarrassing, I don’t know why I feel that way, with how dating is nowadays. The truth is that we met at, of all places, a horror convention. Her booth with her dark art happened to be right next to the stand where I was hawking my scary novels.

I put up the last picture, a charcoal drawing that always gave me bad vibes. I had always wanted to write a story based around it, and yet, I could never bring myself to do so. A faint light source at the bottom of the picture only just managed to illuminate a pyramid. A jagged arch of weak light sat above it, barely visible. She hadn’t sold the painting, even after receiving a number of generous offers.

Now that I was done helping her, I headed upstairs to get my office arranged. My desk was a big thing made of solid wood that I’d found next to a dumpster at my apartment in college. I put horror movie posters and my diploma on the walls.

The bookshelf took up most of one wall, the majority of its contents the most notorious horror. It was my dream to add something to that pantheon. So far, I had only helped a few thousand people get through long plane rides or kill time at the laundromat. Despite this, I still took pride in the modest success I’d had.

 

\*\*\*

 

We ate a big dinner. All four of us were already worn out, our big meal certainly didn’t help. They were staying for the weekend in what we had decided would be the guestroom.

Before we called it a night, Angela made a suggestion, “We should go exploring tomorrow.”

“There’s nothing in town,” I said.

“No, I meant hiking.”

“I’m a little wore out to go on a long hike, but I think there’s a national park close by.”

“No,” I could tell that she was starting to get a little bit frustrated, “I mean our land.”

“Oh,” I said mechanically, “I guess that I hadn’t thought about that.”

The land, fifty wild acres, had come with the house, or at least that was how I saw it. The land alone was worth a lot more than what we had paid.

“There might be something interesting,” Courtney suggested.

Angela nodded, “To be honest, I’m also worried about there being something illegal.”

I narrowed my eyes, “Huh?”

“She’s right,” my brother said, “I’ve read about cases where someone had a marijuana field or a meth lab on their land that they didn’t know about and ended up getting in trouble for it.”

I forced myself to smirk, “You guys are freaking me out here. Fine, we’ll go exploring tomorrow after lunch.”

After lunch we filled some bottles up with water and set out. My brother took a simple pump-action shotgun which he had brought. He explained that it was for any angry animals that we might run into. When my wife saw him run the weapon’s sling across his back she frowned but didn’t end up saying anything.

The terrain was mostly made of up thick, short trees with nasty, thorny branches. We stuck to the clearings, which sported chalky white gravel and clumps of tall grass.

The sun was making itself known but wasn’t oppressive. What made it difficult was the soreness from the previous day and the fact that we spent most of the journey either heading uphill or downhill, which can be just as bad if it’s steep enough.

“Look!” my wife proclaimed, “A cave!”

We followed an invisible line that went from her outstretched finger to the side of a hill. There, an oval shape could be seen, a void black against the chalk. We walked over to it. Sure enough, there was a cave, something that the realtor hadn’t said a thing about. I had looked at the paperwork pretty closely and I was certain that this fact had been absent from it as well.

Daniel had brought a flashlight. He shined it into the cave entrance. Rusted metal could be seen amongst the rocks. The remains of several pieces of old equipment sat there, slowly crumbling away. I guessed that they were old, as they sported massive gears. Chains hung from the ceiling. The tunnel stretched out of sight.

We couldn’t get a closer look. Iron bars, just as rusty as the equipment, had been placed over the cave entrance. There was no gate. It was just a row of bars that ran from the ceiling to the ground, across the length of the cave’s mouth. Each individual bar had been embedded in the rock, both in the roof of the cave and in the floor.

Angela walked up and placed her hands on the bars like she was a prisoner in an old movie or cartoon. She gazed inside, trying to take in all of the details. I saw in my mind’s eye the picture that she would create from the scene.

Daniel focused on the bars, running the flashlight up and down them. I knew from growing up with him that he was searching for a weakness.

“See,” Angela said triumphantly, stepping away from the cave and turning around to examine the view from the hill, “We did find something cool.”

“Yes, we did,” I admitted, “Too bad we can’t explore the cave. I wonder why someone put these bars up?”

It was Courtney that answered, “To keep curious idiots like us from going in there and getting hurt. I bet that they mined it out a long time ago.”

“Well, we aren’t the first people to find it,” Daniel proclaimed, “Someone tried to dig one of the bars out, but they are sunk *deep*,” then he pointed to a spot where a notch had been cut into one of the bars.

I got up close to examine it. They must have used a wire that they wrapped around it, instead of a saw. The notch was on the inner side of the bars. He pointed out a few more spots. Then something terrible occurred to me.

Maybe there was a cave system. Maybe someone had entered the system from another place and gotten lost. They had tried to cut their way out before giving up and moving on. They might still be down there, or at least their body might be. I suggested this to the others.

Danial shined his flashlight onto the chains, which had started to sway, “Well, there has to be another entrance. Look at that air flow.”

“Let’s keep looking,” my wife said, already starting off.

We stood there stunned. Tucked among a collection of high trees, there was an old, two-story house.

We were still my property. We hadn’t gone that far. And we hadn’t encountered any fences. The words of the realtor had confirmed my knowledge of rural areas. My property was separated on all sides from other land by, at the very least, a few strands of barbwire. And yet, she hadn’t said anything about there being another house.

I’m no expert, but it looked like an old design. It was clearly abandoned. The paint was so chipped and faded that it was practically non-existent. No window was intact. The roof had more holes than shingles.

Angela started up the steps, her shoes creaking on the grey boards of the porch.

“Wait, there might be someone inside,” Daniel said in a hushed tone.

Her answer was quick and simple, “If someone is squatting then we need to know about it.”

We followed her inside. I noticed that my brother had unslung his shotgun, choosing to hold it instead.

The inside was a disaster area. Animals had been in there. Leaks in the roof had caused extensive water damage. Dust had piled up. There was no evidence of squatters or anyone else.

Whoever had lived there, they hadn’t moved out. It looked like they had left everything behind. The furniture would have been expensive antiques, if time and nature hadn’t ravaged them. If I looked beyond the ragged state of the furnishings and the water-stained roof and walls, I could see some approximation of the lives that the residents had once lived.

We carefully ascended the stairs, which creaked badly enough that we were all nervous. The upstairs was just as bad as the downstairs.

Daniel had given the flashlight to Courtney. She nervously shined the beam into the old rooms. It found the rotten remains of beds, pealing wallpaper, and crumbling bureaus. In one room, we found a desk. After looking in the drawers, I found a book.

It was a journal, the contents of which told the story of a journey from a small town on the east coast. It had no solid dates, but I would guess from the details that it predated the civil war.

One entry stood out, “Beatrix didn’t make it past the Paluxy, just as Josiah predicted. How will we find the sanctuary that she saw in her visions without her?

“I have grown desperate. Those that hunt us will not relent. They see us as heretics and murderers. From their point of view, we certainly are.”

I looked through the next few entries. They detailed the rest of the journey and its many difficulties. At last, they found what they were looking for.

“I’ve decided that I won’t send word back east. If the church is discovered, I don’t want our enemies to follow the trail to us. They will understand.

“Here, we will not only find refuge, but a citadel from which to grow our following. We will become the power that we were always meant to be.”

The others gave the journal a look.

Daniel closed the book, “At first, I thought that they were just pilgrims. But the further I get into it, the more I start to think that they were fanatics.”

“We should give this to a historian,” I said.

“Yes,” Angela agreed, “Let’s find more for them.”

Again, she took off, forcing us to follow. She suggested that we split up, but Daniel nixed it, insisting that we stick together. After exploring the rest of the second floor she led us back to the first floor. After searching it again, we found a flight of stairs, which led down to a heavy wooden door.

There was a cast iron lock on it. Strangely, the key lay on the floor under it, covered in decades worth of dust. My wife picked it up and put it in the lock without hesitation. Courtney objected, citing countless horror movies and the things which dwelled in old basements. After about ten minutes, Angela had managed to convince her to go further.

My brother kept quiet. Maybe he wanted to show off in front of his girl, not that his bravery was in question. He did have that shotgun, after all.

As for me, I was scared out of my mind. Nothing about this sat right with me. But I didn’t say anything. You might think that I was the one who wanted to show off in front of his mate. But that wasn’t it. I think that a normal person would have gotten out of there. But I’m not normal.

A normal person doesn’t write horror novels. A normal person would write cozy mysteries or sci-fi epics. Hell, a normal person probably wouldn’t write anything at all. The real reason why I followed her down those steps was because I wanted to see what was down there, and I wanted to use it for a story, some sick and twisted tale that would get under peoples’ skin.

With nothing more than the beam of the flashlight, we went down the steps.

What we found turned out to be a simple dirt-floored cellar. A crude board shelf held jars of preserves. A few odds and ends sat against the walls, old things that evoked images of old west settlers. 

The only thing that stood out was a door, which was propped open with a wooden bucket. Behind this door, there was a tunnel, a natural cave. A tunnel ran right past the basement. It was wide and tall enough that we could travel down it.

We returned the next day, equipped with lights and backpacks full of provisions. My brother brought his shotgun again; no one objected to this.

We were aware of the risks of exploring an unmapped cave without any training. And yet, we simply didn’t care. For my brother and his girlfriend, it was an adventure, something to tell people about when they had to go back to work. For my wife and I, it was something more.

The air in the cave was cool. I could smell the minerals. We stopped to marvel at stalagmites and peer into crevasses in the walls.

The tunnel descended at a gentle sloop. We headed upward first. After about twenty minutes we found where it reached the surface. The opening was so small a child would have difficulty squeezing through it. And you’d have to clear the thorny vines out of the way first.

Next, we headed downward. We passed the entrance to the cellar, which was thankfully easy to spot, even with just our flashlights and headlamps. As we made our way along the winding tunnel, my anticipation steadily grew. If I was lucky, I could slap “Based on a true story” on the cover of my next novel. And I knew that Angela would get a few great pieces of art out of it.

I slipped on a patch of loose gravel and fell, landing flat on my back and bumping my head. My brother helped me get back up. As I stood there rubbing the back of my head, he pointed out that if I had landed just a bit to the right, I’d have smashed my skull on a large rock.

After a few minutes we heard the sound of running water. A little underground river had worn a deep groove in the rock. It must have taken many decades at the very least for this to happen. Jumping over it in the pitch dark was nerve racking. A broken ankle would be a disaster.

After about twenty more minutes we reached a fork. This was fine. We’d planned for this. Each of us had a bunch of those disposable foam earplugs, which were neon orange. With these, we’d leave a trail of breadcrumbs back to the exit.

In a few places, the cave thinned out. We had to duck and even crawl at one point, pulling our bags along behind us. We giggled and joked as we squeezed through a tight spot, sidestepping along.

From there, we encountered several more forks. We took dead ends, had to gather up our neon breadcrumbs as we retraced our steps. The tunnels sometimes went at an incline for a bit, but they always trended toward downward slopes. After about a half an hour I started to wonder just how far underground we had gotten.

We stopped for a break in a wide spot. Munching on protein bars, we half-jokingly discussed the logistics of bringing any treasure we might find up to the surface. This brought us to the subject of how far we were going to go. Unless we found another exit, every step that we took forward would be a step that we’d have to take back. We agreed to give it another hour or so.

Courtney and Angela had both been making a map as we went. Courtney had been using a tablet, her map was simplified. Angela had been doing it the old-fashioned way, with a pencil and a sketchpad. We compared the two and found that they were close enough, which we took as a good sign.

After that, we found ourselves at a section that required some light climbing. It wasn’t any worse than what you would experience descending a hill while hiking a trail in a national park. But in total darkness it was another matter.

We followed another tunnel, reached another fork and took a right. A three-way fork awaited us after that. As we stood there trying to figure out which way to take, the sound of sliding rocks behind us made my heart skip a beat. Terrified that the cave was collapsing, I turned around, shining my light back up the tunnel.

The rocks hadn’t fallen on their own. Something had pushed them as it shuffled along. Something that wasn’t that far away. I let out a gasp, drawing the attention of the others. They let out their own cries of shock and disgust.

It was some kind of insect. The exact classification is beyond my ability to categorize. All I can do is describe it to you. The thing was massive, taking up most of the tunnel. It moved on spindly, segmented legs. The underbelly of its long body was pleated. The thing’s vile head sported a set of serrated pincers.

Worst of all, its exoskeleton was completely transparent. Our lights went right through it, illuminating organs as they pumped and pulsated.

I’m not sure which one of us bolted first. But we picked a tunnel and ran for it. I don’t know how long we ran for. We failed to leave behind earplugs at several junctions. The need to get away from that thing was too much. We only slowed down when we reached the big cavern.

The beams of our flashlights were only just able to reach the ceiling of this hollow and didn’t find the edges. It wasn’t empty.

We ran into the cavern. As we moved deeper in, our lights ran across structures. Realizing that there was no sign of the thing that had chased us, we stopped. My brother unslung his shotgun.

We frantically moved our lights around, trying to spot the creature before it attacked, trying to make some sense of the situation. There were stone buildings all around us. Some were several stories tall. These were constructed out of large, carved blocks. It was an entire village.

The ground was solid rock, completely even. Our lights were able to illuminate a few stalactites, the milky colored spikes pointing down at us like teeth in some great beast’s maw.

The great bronze braziers and iron lamps that dotted the city were unlit. In that open space, the darkness seemed to press in, so that anywhere that the light didn’t touch felt like tendrils of black reaching toward us.

Off to one side, our lights danced as we lit up the edge of an underground lake. Near it, our beams found a mushroom garden. The wide caps were a head taller than us. The rows were perfectly aligned and spaced.

Still keeping an eye out for the creature, we admired the stone architecture, the obelisks and statues. It dawned on me that this wasn’t a little village. There had been a whole civilization down there.

We found a main avenue. Shining our beams up this, we caught sight of a pyramid. The thing was so tall it’s apex nearly touched the domed roof of the cavern.

We spotted several square holes that had been carved into the ground. We cautiously approached these pits. Peering inside, our lights were reflected back at us. The sheen of wet, translucent skin, the reflections rolling around as it undulated. The organs oozed along under the transparent flesh. The intestines were like nests of worms.

I don’t know what kinds of animals were in that spawning vat. I hope that I never do. The thought of what the inhabitants of that underground city used them for plages me.

That was when we saw her.

What was unmistakenly a woman was standing in one of the doorways. She had pale skin, paper white, and flawless. Her only garment, a belt, contrasted with this paleness. It held a few small tools, one of them a long knife. Her eyes were just as white. They had no irises, just dead white. I have to admit, I found myself just as enticed as scared. This came to an end when her mouth opened, and she let out a demonic shriek.

Other voices took up the call, echoing the terrible shriek. I plugged up my ears, both because of the volume of the sounds and because of their nature.

We turned to flee, but found the way blocked by other pale beings. White eyes stared at us, the vestigial organs seeing nothing. And yet, they knew that we were there. I sensed that they could perceive us far better than we could them.

More dead eyes appeared out of the darkness. They drew their daggers and started moving forward. We had become encircled.

My brother was shouting for them to stay back. I got the impression that this was an automatic impulse. Perhaps he had fallen back on his training.

They didn’t care. The horde kept advancing. He yelled out threats. They kept coming. Even the sound of a shotshell being racked into the chamber failed to deter them. The only thing that seemed to have any effect was our lights. When the beams ran across their eyes they winced, often brought up a hand to shield them.

Then my wife shouted, her voice louder than his, which caused him to go quiet. I am unable to repeat her words. They weren’t in English. They weren’t in any language that I have ever heard. Each word sounded like a blasphemy, felt like a violation. The horde came to a halt, started chattering, their words just as vile.  

One of them strode out of the crowd. It was a male. He wore a golden crown or perhaps it was a headdress. It bore symbols which I did not recognize, even though I had spent months researching satanic and occult imagery for a writing project. He spoke to Angela. She spoke back.

After exchanging several sentences her fear had faded completely. Now there was only joy.

“What’s going on?” I demanded.

“We had thought that they were gone. Some of our order survived the purge. We were afraid that the hunters had found them. But they went down here. The visions were real! Down here, they have grown close to the forsaken goddess.”

“I don’t understand.”

She called out in a triumphant voice, “At last, the Shadow Church and the Lost Temple will be reunited!”

The crowd cheered. They called out in their foul language. The nature of these exaltations was hidden to me, but I somehow know that this fact is a blessing.

She got up close to me, I heard a tremor in her voice, “I’m sorry. If I didn’t care for you, the sacrifice would have no meaning.”

“Sacrifice?”

“Yes. Your blood will seal our covenant in the eyes of the old ones!”

Without a word, my brother leveled the shotgun and squeezed the trigger. Nothing happened, just a sad click.

Angela held up something shiny. I recognized it from research I had done while writing. It was the weapon’s firing pin, a critical component. Without it, the gun simply wouldn’t function.

Angela said something and the horde rushed forward, a tidal wave of pale flesh and gleaming daggers.  

They set upon Daniel and Courtney, stabbing and slashing. The couple screamed in pain and terror. Their headlamps were torn away. Their lights fell to the cave floor, the darkness shielding their deaths from my eyes.

There was nothing that I could have done. I still have to tell myself this. So many others have told me this, that it must be true. I was unarmed, I didn’t even have a pocketknife.

I ran. I put everything into it. Terror had made everything else impossible. The light bounced up and down as I fled, illuminating the tunnel in quick bursts.

I jumped a gap without thinking about it. For a moment, the beam of my flashlight reached downward, but it failed to find the bottom of the pit.

After running for a long time, I saw a light ahead. A wave of relief momentarily drowned out the terror and grief.

This gave me a burst of strength. I sprinted toward it. When I reached the exit to the cave my heart sank. I instantly recognized the derelict mining equipment, the hanging chains. Sure enough, the exit was blocked by metal bars.

I ran full speed into the old gate, hoping to knock some of the mangled bars out of place. Pain shot through my body. I felt something give on one of the bars. Over my heavy breathing, I could hear them. They were still after me. 

I backed up and slammed into them again. The effort failed, only causing more pain. Again and again, I did this, until finally, I burst through, flying out of the cave, landing hard on the rocky ground. A piercing sensation in my side blasted past the rest of the pain, pure agony. A piece of one of the bars had stabbed me. It was stuck deep. I grabbed hold of it, braced myself for the ordeal of pulling it out. Then, I remembered that my brother had once told me that in such situations, it was best to leave it in. Taking it out would make it bleed worse.

I looked toward the cave. The creatures reached the entrance, stopped in their tracks, let out cries of discomfort, and placed their hands over their eyes.

I got up, started heading toward the house. The light was fading. I knew that if I didn’t make it back before the sun went down, they would get me.

The sheriff himself came to interview me in the hospital. I knew that he’d never believe me.

The best kind of lie is the one where you tell the truth, only changing the important parts.

They had killed my brother and his girl. They had my wife. I think that they were on something. Who knows what they were up to in that cave.

The sheriff assured me that he would go down there and deal with it.
