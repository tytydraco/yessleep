The next day came and I was both alert, yet unprepared at the same time, if that makes any sense. I was exhausted, having, for reasons already mentioned, not gotten any rest. The giants came and collected me, rolling me and four others, three of which were different from those of the day before. The last one was the victor of that day's match. I recognized him from the scowl he was wearing while in the cart with me and the others, the exact same he had when slaying his brother. Whatever innocence, whatever reason or goodness he might've possessed before all of this, it no longer existed.

Looking back, I detract from my earlier statement, about being the only one that could see and understand the phenomenon of death. I think he understood it, too, in that moment after killing the child in the pit. I think he understood it and took pride in it. Life was nothing to him now, save an inconvenience. The lives of all others had no value at all. I remember the way he looked at me and the others. There was no mistake, he was there to end us all.

*“You better watch out, kiddo... They might give you a run for your money.”*

We made it once again to the domed room and immediately, the scent of decay permeated the air. Looking at the pit, I could see numerous red streaks, trailing from the center and away from the pit altogether. The first thought to enter my horrified mind right then was just what could've happened. Even after what'd happened with the child, there wasn't these stains when we'd been taken from the room. Who and when, then, could've done this and how? How many "matches" had there been in the stretch of time between the one I witnessed and now?

Just like before, the five of us sat at each corner of the star in the middle of the pit. The torches' glare upon the room made the child's glaring all the more demented. When he sat down, I could see his body shaking. His glare was focused at the forward wall, where I'd seen the window the previous day. I was about to turn behind me to try and see what, of really anything, his stare might've been focused on when I felt the boom of the God being's voice shake the entire room.

**"Good morning once more, little ones. I hope you've all rested well. This morning, we will continue the process."**

Just like the previous day, two giants approached the pit. This time, I was brought to my feet along with another. The other child turned his head about the room, cooing in awe or curiosity while I simply stared at him, trembling. I was about to have to fight. No, not just fight-- I was going to have to kill!My head swung round the room. My eyes darted everywhere, desperately hoping for some way out or something. Two of the three other children focused their attention on me while the last just glared daggers at the pit itself.

**"Begin!"**

Just like the two from before, the first five to ten seconds were spent merely staring each other down. I can't speak for what might've been going through his head at that moment, but I know my mind essentially overloaded. There was no way out, not without spilling my own brother's blood here. I couldn't do it, and even if I was crazed for blood like the one child was, I was in no shape to fight. Nevermind the fact that, like I said before, I hadn't slept at all, I didn't even know how to fight, nor was I eager to learn.

**"Corvitz."**

I watched the giant approach the pit and I cringed. In one hand, he was brandishing the exact same stick he had in his hand the previous day. I closed my eyes and brought my stubs up to my face like they'd have had any chance at defending me from his stick. I waited with my eyes closed until I heard the pop noise again and realized that I hadn't been touched.

When I opened my eyes, I saw my opponent on the ground, clutching his stomach while softly wailing. I went to try and help him up, which was when I, too, received a sharp sting from the giant's stick. I staggered back, clutching my temple where I was stung. Electricity surged throughout my head and down through my body, cooking me, it felt like, from the inside out.

The heat raged the hardest in my stomach, where my organs melted, turning to slag inside my stomach which caused me to defecate this reddish-black ichor all over the center of the pit. I collapsed, more of the ichor pouring out of my rear. Faintly, I heard the giant exclaim, "Christ, you little fuckers are disgusting!" The heat in my body intensified and, with it, a newfound aggression found itself swelling inside me.

They'd hurt me. I mean, they had been this entire time up to now, but this felt different. Maybe it was the degree of pain I'd been put in, or perhaps it was the giant's added insult, or hell, maybe it was an amalgamation of the two, plus everything that came before, all blended into a surge of violent rage. Whatever the case, I wanted now to hurt the giant in whatever way I could. With the giant still in my eyes, I started thinking of him, writhing on the ground the way I and my opponent were.

Then, thoughts started slowly forming into actions as I started finding my feet again. I stood up, adrenaline surging furiously through me, causing me to start shaking. The more and more my body vibrated, too, the more I realized that it wasn't just my body shaking, but the entire ring as well. I didn't care, though, in fact, a part of me reveled in this fact.

I felt powerful. I felt invincible. No force could stop me, either by the giants or even the God being himself. An immense pressure began building in my head and I couldn't take it anymore, so I let out a deafening roar of rage. Around me, I could hear what sounded like the shifting of rock and, eventually, I could feel the ground begin lifting into the air. The pressure continued building and I let out another roar, which this time caused the levitating section of ground beneath us to splinter into at least a million tiny shards of rock. Briefly, I could see my opponent, suspended in the air where he'd fallen over in the ring, staring back up at me in terror. I could see this, but it didn't register with me. Nothing of it mattered to me now.

Now, I was God, and everything else around me was nothing, mere dust to be kicked away. The pressure spiked one last time and I howled in rage and pain. This time, the impact this one made took every ounce of energy I had and I collapsed unconscious. I was awake just long enough for the dust to settle and hear the God being say, "Well now... What'd I tell you boys? He's it."

After that, I faded out. This, I think, was the first time I'd ever experienced what I now understand as "dreaming". I can remember how strange it felt, too, seeing something happen so vividly, despite knowing in your heart that it couldn't possibly be true. For me, I saw something similar to the light I used to have in my room, the one with all the "little mes", only instead of them, it was the other children, my brothers, all joined hands, dancing about happily. Just like with the "little mes", though, when I reached out to join with them, I watched them get pulled further and further away from my grasping stub.

I extended further and further out, but none of it mattered. They were pulled until finally disappearing altogether. Freedom, tranquility, and fellowship were once more denied to me. The last part of this dream I can remember is how my little arms continued to reach out, screaming out, while the scenery blinked out of existence.

When I awoke, I was in my room. The dark, cramped, empty, soulless room. I felt every bit as empty as the room was, too. As empty, in fact, as the entire world itself. That was my entire world, you see; that building. It was the world I was born into, the only one that existed at all for me. Empty and hollow, yet still home to me and my brethren.

It didn't feel to be too long this time, though, before I was roused by the sound of stomping footsteps. This time, when the giants entered the room, there was no struggle at all to apprehend me. I essentially flung myself into their arms, or at least leaned into them. What point was there to resistance?

As a reward, I suppose, for compliance, I was at least placed a little more gently into the cart than on previous occasions. The others, minus the bloodthirsty one this time, were all cooing in wonder while I once more remained silent. We entered the domed room again and my eyes fixed themselves to the pit. I wouldn't take my eyes off of it, not even while I was being placed in my spot, now covered in copious dried stains, streaked across from it to the star itself.

The God being's voice boomed through the room again, and I still kept my attention on the star. Because of this, I didn't hear much of what he'd said this time. It wouldn't matter to me, though, as I would not be a competitor in this match. Two of the others stood in their places and the two beside me cooed at them, perhaps cheering for them in their own way. That's how I knew this was their first match altogether, for if they would've understood what was really happening, I'm certain they wouldn't have expressed any such excitement.

The two standing immediately sprang into action, slapping each other around with their stubs in the middle of the star. At one point, one of them was knocked down and his opponent took the opportunity to wail on him. Even this, though, I could tell was only a game with them, with the way the both of them cooed and laughed with each other. I watched this and, deep down, I hated it.

This match served to me as a painful reminder of the previous night's dream. I watched these two knock each other around and all I could see were them and a few others, dancing merrily in front of me, all while I couldn't do anything, save observe them.  This didn't last long, though, for apparently their performance wasn't what the God being was wanting from them. One of the giants used his stick to poke the one dominant, causing him to shriek in pain. As he did, the echoes bounced inside and around the walls of the domed room and everything in it.

The others all covered their ears while I, though just barely, managed to keep my stone cold composure. I then watched him split into three different identical versions of himself like an amoeba. Each of them had a look in their eyes similar to the bloodthirsty brother. Him and... And...And myself.

This caused my mind to briefly reflect back on my first match. All that power, all the aggression, the surge of energy I wielded, it was exilherating, of course, but now... Now I realize I, too, had exhibited that same malicious urge as my brother. The urge to squash any and everything that laid at my feet, battered and broken. It didn't matter whether they were innocent or guilty of some wrongdoing to me, either. No, I just wanted to conquer, same as my brother, same as the giants. And most of all, the same as the God being himself.

The brother and his new partners then proceeded to pile on top of the opponent, viciously biting and tearing at him. The fallen brother attempted to try swatting his attacker off of him but it was pitiful at best. His shrieks and wails of pain echoed the loudest in my head-- something that, to a degree, still persists to this day, even as I write this now. Regardless, his opponent was ruthless and continued ripping more and more away from him until all that was left of the poor child's face was a half-eaten cranium with his tattered face just loosely covering it like old drapes over a window.

The three other duplicates of the victor then collapsed into the original, reverting him back into one being again. The giants then entered the pit, same way they had before, and collected the broken, deceased body of the loser while the winner actually attempted to turn his aggression on the giant himself. It started with him simply batting away at the hands of the giant when he tried seizing him. This, of course, prompted the giant to use his stick on him again, where everything would quickly spiral out of control for the giant as he once again split into three other copies of himself and attacked the giant in the same manner he had against his brother.

The giant roared in pain as the copies each bit into and tore away at his face. His cheeks, his nose, eyelids, and ears, everything, every patch of exposed skin was grounds for mutilation to them. His partner, who was about to collect the rest of us, abandoned that objective in favor of aiding his friend. He ran over and began prying the child, or at least one of his duplicates, something that was all but impossible to discern the difference between, off of him, which only resulted in him being open for attack as well.

As this happened, my attention was pulled elsewhere. Namely, toward the front, just like before. There, just under the window, stood the shadow, once again pointing upward. There, just under the window, stood the shadow, once again pointing upward. I resisted the urge to look up, both out of enthrallment with the events unfolding with the child and the giants, and out of sheer frustration with this pathetic game of charades. I continued watching the child and his duplicates tear apart the one giant while the other desperately swatted at the one climbing all over him like he was a fly buzzing around. Neither were having any success, though, and eventually, the one being mauled the most was reduced to little more than a bleeding, raw carcass that laid on the ground, twitching.

The other one managed to bat the one on him off and apprehend the child via seizing his arms and pinning them behind his back. At first, the child jerked and squirmed. This then turned into ear splitting shrieking that sent shock waves throughout the room. The force pushed the giant back, sending him crashing against the wall behind me. Coincidentally, too, the area where his body would land would be right at the feet of the shadow.

I faced the shadow again. His slitted eyes bore into me now, as if his glare alone would stab straight through me. His hand straightened further, stretching further out into the air.

I finally resigned and turned my attention once more to the ceiling. This time, I found something, something I somehow hadn't seen before. Just above the window, I spotted what looked like a hole, a small, wide hole or opening in the ceiling. Dark as it was, both in that room and inside the hole itself, it wasn't hard to overlook. That said, what, I wondered, was the shadow's point? What about this point on the ceiling made it so significant to them that they were so adamant that I give it my attention?

Now my attention was effectively diverted. The giant had just begun staggering back to his feet when I started to waddle over to the area underneath the hole. The giant regained his balance, if only barely, and started stomping back toward the pit. I could hear him seething with rage, growling, with what I think was foamy spittle dripping from his mouth.

I remember stopping and cringing dead in my tracks, thinking he was about to seize me, but no, his focus was aimed forward toward the pit. With this, I continued ambling forward. When I reached the window, I looked up again.

Standing directly under the hole, in the spot where the giant's body was thrown, I remember feeling a cool sort of breeze billowing down from it. This, and the sight of the hatch dangling down from it, seeming to just barely cling to it by the corner, made me realize this hole was actually the vent to the room.

But what made this something of importance? What, I wondered, was so special about this vent that it was supposed to warrant my attention? Coincidentally, as though they could hear me, I watched the shadow then ascend from the ground, floating straight up toward the opening above me. I reached up, but to what, I wasn't really sure. The shadow, perhaps the vent itself, I wasn't sure, and it made little difference anyway.

Frustration found itself building inside me once again as I continued reaching further and further, touching only the lukewarm stream of air. It was happening again, I was being denied again a chance at... well, I suppose at freedom, lost a concept as it was to me. I couldn't take it, not again. I'd already been teased three times by this concept, and I had given it up. And now to have this be thrown at me again now?

No, no I wouldn't be denied again like this! I would reach the vent, this hole in the ceiling. Where it would lead or what I'd see when I got there, I didn't know or care. I would see it for myself, what laid beyond.

My body shook more and more violently with each passing second. My stub stretched more and more, to a degree that was painful, as though they would detach from my body entirely. From behind, I could faintly hear the sound of elephantine footsteps approaching me. They were going to seize me. I couldn't let that happen, I knew it.

Combinations of frustration, of rage, of desperation, all started conglomerating into one infuriated fire that began burning inside me with the intensity of at least a hundred suns bearing directly down on top of me. Suddenly, this caused a small radius of the ground around me to split from the rest and begin floating up into the air, carrying me aloft and toward the vent. I was rising rapidly, though to me, my ascent to freedom was slow and glorious. Remembering this very moment, I suppose one could compare it to beliefs of one's supposed "rise to Heaven".

The vent was my "Heaven". My tranquil salvation from the Hell that was the domed room, the pit, now littered with broken bodies and agony. I was going to make it, I was going to escape.For a moment, I imagined the "little me's" again, all dancing around merrily. I was seeing them, distantly, beyond the scope of the vent. They were moving further and further away from me, just like they had in the dream, but this time, I'd catch them. I'd catch up to them and I, too, would finally dance with them.

I made it about halfway to the vent when I felt something tightly grasp my ankle. My eyes averted downward to see the giant, tightly grasping my leg, trying to pull me downward. I could see it in his eyes, he wasn't about to let me ascend any further. I kept reaching further and further out towards the vent. The giant began pulling me down. I could see the vent, the "little me's" growing more and more distant by the second.

I was rapidly descending again and that's when I lost all sense of the world around me. The same way it had earlier in my match against my brother, my mind more or less detached itself from my body. The world began shaking again and light began emitting from my body again. Pressure built up in both my mind and body until suddenly, another shrill screech like the one from before burst forth from me, which then sent a blinding white light flooding across the entire room.

Much like the last time, I couldn't feel anything. The difference, however, is that I knew this time that I wasn't unconscious. Somehow, some part of me knew that I was still aware, in some way, of myself. I knew that I was alive, even if perhaps I didn't know that I was. Numb and unable to perceive anything else, I would've sworn I was dead. The white cloud persisted for a time before slowly dissipating, revealing the area to be not but a hollowed out husk of a building.

All around me was the skeletal structure of the domed room. Around this was a brightened terrain, colorful and blinding. Almost immediately, I recognized this to be the very same terrain I'd seen in both my dream and the light. The lush, green, lively ground that swayed to and fro with but only a gust of the wind, the bright blue overcast that bathed me in warm, radiant light, and in its center, there rested a large, burning orb that glared down upon me. All of it was there, all of it was real, and it was all overwhelming to me who, up to this very moment, had known only darkness and confinement.

Now, there was color. Now, there was freedom. Now, there was life!

I crumpled my small body into a ball. I began to cry. This produced the shockwaves, but with there being virtually nothing there to destroy, they went largely unnoticed; mere pitiful little wails that, save for kicking up a bit of dust and knocking over a few of the girders that stood protruding from the ground, were just that: wailing.  I had attained freedom, but what was I supposed to do now?

After everything, all the effort and destruction, and all I could achieve was making myself become lost. I was free, but alone, cut off and without any knowledge of myself or the world around me. I remained like this until the giant blazing orb slowly fell from above me and the baby blue overcast turned to a more familiar dark, lifeless one. This must've restored at least a fragmented familiarity within me because I found the strength then to pick myself up. Either this, or because I'd simply ran out of the energy to cry any longer.

I ambled forward, taking my first steps onto unknown soil. The ground was soft, sort of spongelike, sinking just slightly beneath my stubby feet. I actually stumbled a bit with those first few steps because of this, having before only been familiar with the cold, unforgiving stone floor from "home".

That's what I will refer to the place and the life I knew before as: "Home", despite the absolute revulsion I feel anytime I even think of the horrid place. For better or worse, it was home for me.From where I'd awoke that night, I remember how I actually spent days roving the terrain. It was over the span of many days-- the exact number I couldn't tell you as I lost the count after about the fifth or sixth-- which I eventually learned how to discern because of the routine rising and falling of the giant orb, hailing the bright, colorful overcast. During these hours, I wandered around, searching for-- well, for something.

Freedom? Well no, I already had that. Home, perhaps-- except that I'd destroyed my home. Then it came to me; perhaps I could seek a new home, start a new life. How this would be achieved or where, I didn't know, of course, but just like with the vent, despite all uncertainties, I would make a way to seek out a new home and begin a new life.

One of the very first trials I would face while setting out on this quest was the dark skies itself. Specifically, what I could and/or couldn't do while the giant orb was no longer up. I learned quickly, after almost finding myself going off of a cliff due to lack of adequate light to aid my sight, that trying to move about during this time wasn't a wise idea, so I established a rule that I'd only move around while the orb hung high overhead. It was during these times that I'd also learn some of the certain noises that would be made during this time.

Ranging from clicks, to titters, to the whirring of the air rustling the leaves, I'd hear all sorts of noises that both frightened me, having never before heard anything like them, and piqued my curiosity, as I wondered what their sources would look like out of the cloak of darkness.During these hours, I would merely curl into a ball, curling all four stubby appendages up in front of my face and wait for the orb to make it's return.

The only times I would break my rule regarding movement during the dark hours was when I felt the cold, wet droplets of rain from the sky. Those were some of the worst times, I must say, for not only did I have no protection from this, and not only was this yet another foreign sensation to me, but it was so, so cold, and my tiny body had no real insulation. These nights, I'd more or less pass shivering until the orb would rise to warm me and dry me off. One night in particular, I remember laying there, shaking profusely, and looking up at the sky.

In that moment, I distinctly remember asking myself, was any of this worth it? Was it worth it to cause the destruction I had, to have, at least as far as I was aware, obliterated everyone I once knew, for only this? Then, just like they had before, back in the domed room, there appeared the shadow, standing in front of me, leering down at me with his beady, slitted eyes. I reached out to them and cried out.

They stood motionless. I climbed back up to my feet then and stumbled toward them. Two steps I took forward and the shadow never moved. I took two more steps then and stumbled over a miscellaneous pebble, falling back on my face and when I looked up, the shadow was right on top of me. I reached out and cried a second time. This time, the shadow moved their arm into the air again.

When I looked up, I saw that a bright orange tinge had bled into the sea of black, mingling with it, and when I followed its trail back toward the horizon, I found that the orange orb was once more rising. This was when two things happened for me. The first is that I was reassured that my actions, my journey, wasn't in vain. I was free, and thus, I was allowed hope, hope for a brand new beginning. Like the sun's rise on that stormy night, I felt that my struggle was only temporary and that the light would always come again.

The second realization was that I now knew of the shadow's purpose. Each and every time up to that point, they'd always appeared at a time when I was lost to guide me toward freedom. The first time they appeared, it was to show me a glimpse of my potential, the potential to have an impact on things around me, including things far bigger or greater than I. Then, when he pointed upward, it was to guide me out of that horrid place.

The shadow disappeared again and from there, I set my sights toward the horizon. Slowly, the blazing orb rose higher and higher and the world was given color and hope again. There were plenty of nights following that had similar circumstances, but in all of them, I simply remembered to look to the horizon and remember, the light is coming again.

Eventually, my efforts would finally pay off when I came across a place that wasn't a simple stretch of land. It had structures, many of them, just like I'd seen with home. Not just this, though, there were other giants. All of them resembled the ones from home, except the clothes they wore, the way they smiled at each other, rather than scowl and/or bark at one another, were vastly different from them. Some of them, I saw, held each other's hands, smiling, much like the["little mes"](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/14gxr0b/this_was_how_i_was_born_and_i_was_made_to_kill_my/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).This, I thought, was the reward for freedom. This was life now. No longer was I made to murder or suffer because of the God being or his giants. I was now given this as a new [beginning](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/14g2bpp/this_is_how_i_was_born_and_i_was_made_to_kill_my/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), and I was going to take it.
