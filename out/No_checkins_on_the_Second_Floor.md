I worked overnights at a motel back in 1994. My schedule allowed it back then, and the pay was generous for relatively menial tasks. 

We had simple rules:

Don't check anyone in without an ID.

Don't leave the front desk unattended

Lock the back entrance before midnight (guests can and do walk through from the back rooms if its open)

One particularly frigid night, I sat comfortably on the worn green suede chair, swiveling gently from side to side, at once trying to stay awake and subtly lulling myself into the forbidden space between sleep and focus. 

"Did you read the note?" My coworker, Marta said, tidying items on the desk that were already tidy.

"Hm? No..." I said, straightening my posture and scanning the desk. 

"No check-ins on the second floor. For now."

"Why?"

She shrugged. 

"And any noise complaints *about* the second floor, document them but we arent supposed to investigate." 

"What? Why? Is something broken?"

"I do not know Sam, I got here the same time as you." She said impatiently.

"Maintenance will check cameras in the morning. We can refund if needed."

A few check ins rolled in around 11, a couple that rode in on a motorcycle smelling like whiskey, an older man with a pair of dry cleaned suits hung over his arm, and two young women that seemed to be having a rough night. 

I thought to check on them, or at least keep an eye out for anyone lurking around their door. Ive seen that dynamic play out more than once. 

Just past midnight, the phone rang. 

"Front desk." Marta said

"Oh, I see" she darted her eyes over to me, and I sat up curiously. 

"Sir, I-yes I understand. Unfortunately we can't do anything about the noise right now."

She looked at me, turning her free hand up in frustration. 

"We can offer you a refund-oh he hung up."

"Let it go," I said, and I stood to make a pot of coffee. 

Peeking over my shoulder, I saw Marta scribble into the log 

*Clicking sounds above 106- refund offered*

The man called twice more that hour

*Grinding sounds above 106*

*Dripping sounds above 106*

Some time after 1am, the shrill ringing of the phone jolted me awake with a gasp. 

Marta eyed me, shaking her head softly in disapproval. 

She grabbed the receiver

"Front desk." 

"Sir, as I had mentioned-"

"Sir-"

The man's voice was suddenly audible from where I was sitting, a panicked low-fi bellow from the reciever that shook me to my core. 

*They're screaming! They're screaming like theyre being torn apart!*

She looked at me, mouth agape.  Eyebrows furrowed. 

I could barely speak

"Call the police," I whispered 

Tears welled in her eyes and streamed down her sallow cheeks as she shook her head delicately.

"What?"

"The line's cut off" she said, and I noticed her pushing the switchhook frantically. 

From outside, rapid footsteps crunched over the gravel drive.

Marta whimpered and pointed towards the glass door, where the silhouette of a man was pacing frantically. 

"HIDE." I hissed, pulling her under the large wooden desk. 

I peered painstakingly through a crack between the desk's wooden panels. 

"It's just the caller," I whispered.  "The dry cleaning guy." 

She pressed a finger to her lips to shush me and I obliged, wondering why he would linger rather than get help.

A banging strike to the glass rattled the lobby, then another, and another. 

Marta and I pressed our palms over our mouths, each looking to the other for a way out but both petrified. 

Shaking, she slowly lowered her hand and mouthed to me, 

*Did you lock the back door?*

A searing panic gripped me as I realized the weight of my mistake. 

The sound of  crunching gravel grew faint before the back door squeaked open. 

Hyperventilating into my palm, I squeezed as deeply into the corner as I could. 

"I called, and called!" He bellowed into the quiet lobby, stepping heavily from one foot to the other. 

"You really had to make me come to you?" He growled crouching down to our eye level, a manic sneer stetching across his mottled face, and the last thing I saw was my petrified reflection in his black, lifeless eyes.

I'm forever grateful to the two young women who ran two blocks to a payphone to call the police, and I'm lucky to be alive. 

But something wasn't right about that note.
