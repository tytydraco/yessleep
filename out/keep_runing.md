When I was younger, my parents would often drop me off at my uncle's cabinet in the woods for summer vacation since they couldn't take any days off, I really enjoyed my time there, you would think a nine year old city girl and a fifty seven year old retired officer living in the countryside won't get together well, but we were best friends. Every day we would wake up, watch cartoons, have breakfast in bed, go by the lake, learn how to fish, get groceries down town, I really liked taking walks in the beautiful forest by the cabinet, my uncle never let me go alone though, as a kid I didn't see it as him watching over me, more like him spoiling my adventures. However, one night, I snuck out, it felt so cool at the time, I saw myself a spy sneaking around. The forest was as beautiful at night as it was during the day, I wanted to go by the lake which I thought knew by heart, but as expected, I got lost. I realized I never cared about finding my way back home since my uncle was always there to take me back, suddenly the whole place turned eerie, I started hearing things, seeing things at the corner of my eyes, I was crying, at some point I crouched down and waited for my uncle to find me, I remember being so scared back then, I was shacking when I felt a hand on my shoulder, looking up I saw my uncle, finally I was safe, he took my hand calmly and led the way, we kept walking for a while, I knew something was off, why wasn't he saying anything ? Shouldn't he scold me? just then I heard my uncle s voice screaming from behind me... **lily run!**   
  
I was stunned, looking back, I saw my uncle running towards me, I looked again at the hand holding, instead, I saw black skinny fingers wrapping around my wrist, I tried pulling my hand out, trying not to look up, I heard the whispers coming from the stranger above, a cold sweat traveled down my spine, just then, a gunshot went off, very close by...my uncle had shot the creature, it let go, finally gaining some courage, I went off running, my uncle yelled ***run to the left ! just keep running!*** I cried while running, I was worried, I felt like throwing up, I tripped so many times, but I got up and kept running. Finally I saw the familiar highway, there I found my uncle's car, it was opened so I got in and hugged my knees, after what felt like hours, my uncle got in the car, breathing heavily, scared and bruised, he gave me his phone and weakly instructed me to call the police at some point, he passed out. Everything after happened in a blur, my uncle was taken to a hospital, my parents were called, I was asked by the police about what attacked my uncle, but I couldn't talk, so I was left with my parents, after that, I never went there for summer, my family never brought it up, my uncle said he didn't remember what actually happened that night. I'm 21 now, I can't tell if what I saw that day was real or just my child brain making things up, for so long, it seemed like a dream, a story to tell around friends, near a fire in the woods, that is...   
  
until a month ago, when my uncle came to visit me, for the first time in a long time, we went out for dinner, watched a movie, then came back home, as I was getting ready for bed, I got a call from my uncle...   
  
Saying ...**~~he couldn't make it~~**, he had some urgent matters to take care of, I lost contact just as I saw my bedroom door opening slightly, as long black fingers pushed by. . .
