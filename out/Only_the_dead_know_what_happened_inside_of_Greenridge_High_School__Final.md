13 kids were murdered and now we finally know [why](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1id875r/only_the_dead_know_what_happened_inside_of/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button).

The pain that was shooting up my leg slowly faded as we got back to my house. I was still bleeding, but it was hard to focus on the injury. My mind and body felt disconnected; I moved my hand to slide my phone out of my bag before even realizing what I was doing. 

“What are you doing?” Emily asked me as she checked the mirrors.

“Calling Caleb.” I spit out. My hands were shaking so badly that it was hard to hold my phone. 

The call only rang twice before he answered; a wave of relief washed over me the moment I heard his voice. 

“I need you to come back to Greenridge…” I coughed. I could feel myself crying again, but I didn’t know why. The first time Caleb and I explored the school, it was not this intense, yes I was scared, but this felt different. Caleb told me that he was already on his way back. I can’t tell you how happy I was to hear that. 

\-

As we pulled into the house, I winced and reached down to grab my leg. Emily jumped out of the car and motioned for Noah to pull in behind her. “We need to get you inside,” Emily said as she helped me up, I grabbed both of the bags and watched Noah come running towards the door. 

“Kira!” I yelled, and the front door swung open. 

“What happened to you?” Hunter questioned, but I couldn’t explain right away. I felt like I was going to throw up. Caleb was going to kill me for letting random people into his house, but it felt like I didn’t have a choice. 

Emily put me on the couch; I watched her dig around in her bag and pull out a first aid kit. I could hear Noah as he moved around to make sure everything was locked. The cut on my leg looked serious; the wound had a deep purple glow to it. The moment Emily applied the medicine, another wave of pain shot through my leg and into the rest of my body; my eyes rolled back, and I passed out. 

\-

“Cassandra?” I heard Caleb's voice say as I felt my body being nudged. He pushed at me a few times before I gave in and opened my eyes. 

I quickly sat up and checked my leg; it was wrapped up, and most of the pain was gone. I turned my attention to the room; Caleb, Emily, Noah, Hunter, Kira, and Coraline were all waiting for me to get up. 

Caleb gently put Hannah’s bag on my stomach. 

“If you’re going to search it, you have to do it soon,” Noah said seriously. I watched him spin a white knife in his hand, it looked fancy and came out to a curved point. 

“Why the rush?” I asked as I slowly opened the bag and started searching every pocket. 

“We have to kill the principal to shut down the school once and for all; when that’s done, we have to get out of dodge. All of us, together.” Emily said as she moved to check my leg. 

I turned to the kids; they were quiet and watching us intensely. I could tell that they were scared and to be honest, so was I. 

“How are we supposed to do that? He shrugged off your bullets like they were nothing. Also, what about those people who we left behind?” I asked Noah before thanking Emily for helping me with my leg. 

“Using this knife. It’s hard to explain, but we are like you and Caleb. I am capable of using these objects, they’re special. Only these objects can kill one of those…monsters.” Noah explained. I was still so damn confused. 

“I told them about how I saved Kira; I told them everything that happened to us before. I also did my best to explain how you can talk to some spirits and were looking for information about your sister.” Caleb told me. 

I looked towards Emily, “What can you do?” 

“Spot these places of Paranormal Occurrence or Paranormal Phenomena, or whatever. We haven’t picked a name for buildings like the school yet. The point is, I can see them, the objects, and spot other people like us. Luke and Tiffiny weren’t like us but they wanted to come with Noah and me, anyway.” Emily mumbled.

“I’m sorry about your friends.” That is about all I could offer. I couldn’t believe what I was hearing, but in a way, it made some sense. Still, what happened to Luke and Tiffiny was awful, and going back to Greenridge with our lives hinging on a knife didn’t sound too promising.

I slid a notebook with my name on it out of Hannah’s backpack and put the bag on the floor. When we were younger, we would leave each other messages all the time. As I sat there looking at the notebook, it hit me; I don’t actually remember much about our childhood. I remember Hannah and my parents, and the school I went to; it was a private school just a few miles from here. But I couldn’t remember much else and the harder I tried to remember, the more painful it became. 

The first page read: 

“Hi Cass, I don’t know if you’ll get this or not, but I figured that it wouldn’t hurt to try. I wanted to leave you a proper note at the house, but Mom and Dad are acting weird. I think that the best place to leave this notebook is in my backpack. If you found this note, that means that you went to my school.” 

“I tried telling our parents about what had been happening, and they brushed me off. Told me to leave it alone, and grounded me for a month. Since they won’t listen, I’ll just tell you. Mom said that I was getting sick and would have to go away for a while.” 

“A few weeks ago, a girl was murdered in our auditorium. I don’t know the details, but the whole school was on edge. She is not the only one to die or go missing this year, mom and dad said these things happen sometimes. The teachers have been weird too, not all of them but…I caught the lunch lady sniffing me yesterday. The principal said that I should be flattered and that I must smell nice. I begged Mom and Dad to keep me home the next day but they said that I have to go.” 

I turned my attention to the second page. 

“A lot of my friends are gone, Cass. Not just my friends either, others are gone now too. Kira, Wayne, Hunter, Coraline, Liam, James, Chloe, Tylor, and Taylor are gone. I saw three students being taken out of school by some guys wearing hazmat suits. My headaches are getting worse, I think we are all sick or something.” 

“Mom said that they’re sending me to the ChestCreek Hospital in Mercy. I have no idea where that is but if you get this please, find me.” 

\-

I got up from the couch so fast I nearly kicked things off of the coffee table. I felt like a new wave of life had washed over me. Though I still couldn’t walk fully, I knew where we had to go and what we had to do. 

“Are we all packed?” I asked as I watched the kids put their jackets on. 

“Yes but what the hell got into you?” Caleb asked as I passed him the notebook. 

“Let’s go finish this once and for all,” I said as I limped towards the front door. As I ripped it open, I took another look up and down the street. People were leaving their homes, some people were returning home. Could they really not know what’s been going on right down the street? 

As we loaded the cars, we came up with a proper plan: the kids were going to wait in Noah's car while we finished up at the school. Once that is done, Noah and Caleb will take his car, and Emily and I will take my car and we will go try to find Hannah. Noah seemed to think we should always be on the move, but wouldn’t give us the exact details. 

\-

Arriving at Greenridge for the final time was extremely tense. As we pulled into the parking lot I scanned the outside of the school; I was hoping to see the groundskeeper. I wanted to have one last conversation. But he wasn’t outside and maybe that was for the best; Caleb did tell me that he attacked him. 

“Are you ready for this?” Emily asked me as we stepped out of my car. I could hear Noah and Caleb getting out of Noah’s car. Everything felt surreal. 

“Not really,” I admitted to Emily as the men caught up with us. 

“Remind me again why we have to shut this place down?” I asked Noah as we slowly walked towards the door. 

“If we don’t, it is going to keep luring people here and collecting bodies.” Noah sighed. Something was weighing on him, but I didn’t want to push him further. We all had to be focused on this. 

“Cassandra and I will go for the principal,” Noah said to the group as we got to the front door. I was extremely surprised that none of the killers ever came out to meet us; it actually made me wonder if they knew we were here when we pulled in. 

“Why are we splitting up again?” Caleb mumbled under his breath. 

“As soon as we walk into the building the weapon that Noah is carrying will ring the dinner bell. With all of the killers distracted that means Caleb and I have the opportunity to search the school and maybe bring a few more spirits back. Cassandra and Noah will go together because she should be able to have a direct conversation with the killers.” Emily explained as I reached for the door and slowly pulled it open. 

Putting an end to this, finding my sister, and maybe giving a few more people a second chance…all of these thoughts were fueling me. But I would be lying if I said that I wasn’t terrified. 

As soon as we walked into the school, Noah motioned for me to follow him. We made our way towards the gym, but this time, we took a turn down a hallway that I hadn’t explored before.

“We are looking for the principal's office. I’m hoping that’s the best way to draw him out.” Noah said as we continued exploring. Unfortunately, we didn’t get very far before we heard the same whistling I heard during my return trip. 

I turned around quickly while Noah clenched the dagger. 

“I’m not scared of you.” I snapped. 

“You’re so full of shit.” He snarled at me and walked at us faster. I hadn’t noticed it before, but it didn’t look like the principal could run. His legs looked like they were moving in slow motion. 

As I opened my mouth to say something back, I felt something hard hit the back of my head. I could hear Noah fighting something, but I lost consciousness shortly after being hit. When I opened my eyes, it felt like I was choking on blood; I spit as much out as I could. 

“Cass-” I could hear Noah mumble to me. 

Slowly, my head stopped spinning, and I could see where we were sitting. It was a classroom, my blood was all over the desk in front of me. The room was bright and empty aside from the rows of desks. 

“Tell me you have a plan,” I mumbled to Noah as I slowly got up. 

“Yeah, I have a pretty good idea. We will have to fight this guy the moment he comes into the room. We can’t waste any more time…” Noah said as he pulled himself out of his chair. 

“I just want to have a conversation.” The principal said as he opened the door to the classroom. 

I was shocked, he wanted to talk to us. After trying to kill us? I decided to play along, hoping that Noah would take the opportunity to kill him while I held him in a conversation. 

“Cassandra, I need you to stay here with me.” He started to say as he slowly shut the door. 

“I’m not staying here with you.” I snapped. As soon as the words left my mouth, he charged at me. I let him get as close as I could before turning to run. He grabbed my hair and I screamed. I brought my arms up to grab his wrist before I was suddenly let go. I could hear the principal screaming, and as soon as I turned around, Noah was sinking the dagger into his chest. 

The building started shaking, and I mean really shaking. I could see dust falling from the ceiling. 

“We have to run,” Noah said as he pulled out his dagger, and we made for the door. 

\-

I took off running after Noah, and that is when everything started falling apart. I could keep up with him for a second, but the ground cracked; it split right down the middle of the hallway. I screamed and was thrown to my side. 

As soon as I got back up, I screamed for Noah, but he had made it too far ahead of me. I couldn’t continue down the hallway because the ceiling was falling, so I had to turn around and backtrack. As I ran, I didn’t have time to think about the others. I took a left, and a baseball hit the wall three inches from my head. 

I slid in place and nearly fell for a second. There was nowhere else for me to go, so I charged forward, took a baseball to the shoulder, and screamed. I could feel my shoulder break. I tried to steady myself but as soon as I lifted my head; the man dressed in a baseball uniform slammed into my body. He pounced on me as if he was an animal. 

I shrieked as my back hit the floor and tried to use my good arm to push him back. His flesh was…peeling. His breath smelled like death, and it looked like his eyes were…melting. He was speaking, but I couldn’t understand. As I pushed on him with my good arm I could feel the ground beneath us give way. 

The feeling of weightlessness was intense; as I hit the ground under the floor, I screamed and wheezed. Before I could even attempt to get up, the killer put his hands around my neck and I bucked my hips. I moved my good arm to his neck and pushed the killer off of me. His flesh peeled off in my hand. 

As he stumbled back, a piece of the ceiling fell and crushed him. I could feel my eyes twitch before breaking out in screams. It felt like I couldn’t breathe. But there was no time to process; I had to keep running. 

\-

I must’ve landed in the basement, I scrambled to my feet and made a run for the first door I could see. I pushed it open, ready to run up a set of stairs or something. Instead, I found myself standing outside of the front door. 

“Cassandra!” Caleb yelled. He took my arm and tugged me to the side. My eyes were adjusting, everything was so bright it felt like my eyes were on fire. I was breathing heavily, my hands were shaking, and I felt like I was going to throw up. 

Once my eyes adjusted to the light I could see Emily, Caleb, and Noah standing before me. Pain surged through my body. I turned around to watch the school crumble, but it didn’t fall apart in the way I thought it would. The building itself cracked a few times before…disappearing and no I’m not joking. 

Once I could breathe again, I took my hurt arm in my good hand and started limping towards my car. 

“Did you guys bring anyone back?” I asked Caleb as we walked. 

“Two from the football field,” Caleb said before stopping me. 

“Are you going to be okay?” He asked me. I could feel his arm shaking, but I did appreciate that he was trying to stay calm for me. I told him that I was going to be okay, and that was the end of it. 

You won’t hear from us for a while. We need a break, and we have to focus on finding [Hannah](https://www.reddit.com/r/SpectralsMegaverse/comments/1iixmxm/spectrals_megaverse_2025/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button).
