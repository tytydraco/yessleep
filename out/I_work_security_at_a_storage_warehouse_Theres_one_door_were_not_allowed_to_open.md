As I realized that my company granted key card had failed to open the employee entrance, I was left with no option but to hammer on the door until someone finally heard me. After my hands were raw from slamming them against the metal surface for a minute, the door A minute later opened and I was met by a man in his early sixties, tall, well built, with heavy bags under his eyes.

“You’re the new guy?” he half asked half stated.

I nodded.

“Alright, come on in,” he said as he gestured for me to follow with a small wave, “I’ll show you everything you need to know for the job.”

He led me inside a small locker room and instructed me to change into a gray uniform.

“Number sixty-five is yours.”

The uniform consisted of pants, a shirt, a pair of shoes, and a thicker jacket to survive the cold within the warehouse itself. The whole thing was a size too large, with the shoes too snug, but it didn’t seem that we were spoiled for options. I felt something hard within the inner jacket pocket: a hip flask, still filled to the brim with an unknown liquid. I pulled it out to show the man.

“Yeah, good old Wallace. He worked here about ten years back, five people have worn that uniform since then. The flask is still there.”

“So, I just keep it?”

“Well, it’s become something of a sacred artifact by now. Throw it out if you dare. Myself, I’m superstitious,” he joked, but I put the flask back, nonetheless, deciding not to stand out and to keep the tradition going.

He then led me into a set of long, narrow corridors still existing from the cold-war era where everything was constructed with concrete, pretending to be able to withstand a nuclear blast. With only a few doors on each side, one for the kitchen, the other for the storage facility, and the last for the surveillance room, there was little effort needed to memorize the layout of the facility, which served me well seeing as the interview had taken place off site.

“How many questions did the suits ask you before deciding to give you the job?” the man asked.

“Eh, I think they asked around a dozen or so by the end,” I explained.

“That’s not what I asked,” he interjected, “I asked how many questions they presented before they decided to give you the job.”

“How should I know?”

“I would have. I reckon they decided to give you the job before you even showed up for the interview. Everything else was just a formality.”

Deciding not to push the matter any further, I was led into the surveillance room. It was a confined space with a single window leading outside, and a set of nine monitors above a narrow desk covered in personal affects, magazines, and half emptied pizza boxes from the prior shift. In addition: a red, rotary phone connected to a landline lay on desk in one of the corners, covered in an inch thick layer of dust, unused for what must have been decades.

“This’ll be your office for the foreseeable future,” he said.

I wondered silently how pissed my colleagues would be if I cleaned the desk on my first shift and got rid of the garbage, but I figured it best to stay low until I’d been accepted as a part of the team. After all, I would be starting out covering exclusively the night shift alone. If I had any hope of being moved to the day shift, I shouldn’t start out by making enemies.

“Any place I can smoke?” I asked.

“Cigarettes, I assume?”

I nodded.

“Open the window and hope you don’t trigger the smoke detector.”

The man sat down by one of the computers that had a scanning device attached. Without looking at me, he reached out his hand gesturing for me to hand him something.

“Your keycard,” he clarified, “I need to activate it.”

I handed him my keycard, and he swiped it across the scanner.

“There, now you have access to almost every door in the warehouse.”

“Almost every door?” I repeated back to him in the form of a question.

“Yeah…” he paused, “let´s get back to that.”

From there, he briefly explained how the system worked, how to turn on and off the cameras, and how to access recorded footage. There wasn’t all that much to it, and apart from a few notes on a piece of paper, I had it all down to memory.

“Working hours for the night shift are eight PM to four AM, followed by a brief change of guard, then at five the day shift officially takes over. Couldn’t tell who’s relieving you in the morning but won’t be me this time.”

“So, that’s it?” I asked, “I sit here and watch the monitors, prevent anything from getting stolen?”

“Do you own a firearm?” he asked.

I shook my head.

“You’re not a cop, you’re not an agent, you’re not an action hero. If you see anything on these monitors, you call ‘911’ and hide until help arrives. Your job is to alert the authorities if anything happens, not to step in and get yourself killed. I need us to be absolutely clear on that,” he said, his demeanor suddenly changing from laid back to strict in a heartbeat.

“We’re clear,” I responded, slightly caught off guard. “Do you expect these things to come up on a regular basis?”

“God, no, this is going to be the easiest job you’ve ever had. You can sit around and binge-watch your favorite show all night for all I care. I’d recommend that old radio podcast ‘Unheard,’ they have a great episode about the 1993 missing cosmonauts.”

“Never heard about it.”

“Fair enough. Now, about these cameras, they are going to do ninety-five percent of the job for you. As long as you can recover footage and point at the screen, you’re golden.”

“And if the cameras go out?” I asked.

“Son, these things haven’t malfunctioned since 1998. If something happens to the wares and you can’t show us the recording of it happening, I’m going to assume you did it.”

“So, the cameras are infallible, got it.”

“Except for Camera number six, but that doesn’t matter, cause you ain’t going to need it.”

“What?” I asked.

“We’ll get back to that,” he repeated, “now let me give you a tour of the storage facility.”

We returned to the narrow hallway and went for the door in the middle, which took us into a large warehouse. Inside there were rows upon rows of gray, plastic boxes of identical make and size, each marked with a three-digit number, but with no indication of what was kept inside. I had never thought to ask what exactly would be stored within the warehouse, thinking it would be miscellaneous wares like every other storage facility in the area. Still, due to the peculiarity of the place, something felt *off*.

“What exactly are we storing?” I asked.

“Wouldn’t know, never asked.”

“And how long have you been working here?” I went on.

“About twenty-eight years,” he replied, “it’s a good job, Son, with good pay and benefits. Don’t waste it asking too many questions you don’t need the answer to.”

I sighed. I could abide by his instructions, but my curiosity was piqued. I just nodded in agreement and tried my best to focus on information essential for the job. My job instructions were clear enough, after all. But just as I had come to terms with ignoring the mystery, we then stopped in the middle of the outer section of storage shelves. A single door was placed on the wall, wooden with a simple lock, not compatible with our keycards or any modern technology for that matter. If I didn’t know any better, I would have assumed that it belonged to a residential building.

“What’s this?” I asked, immediately realizing that this would be another question left without a satisfactory answer, but unlike before he was more accommodating that time around.

“Yeah, this is one of the things I needed to show you,” he began, moving closer to the door as if inspecting it as one would a foreign object not belonging.

“Well?”

“I haven’t the faintest idea what’s behind this door,” he announced.

“You’re not being serious, right now, are you?”

“Serious as a heart attack, Son. There’s a reason I’m showing you this. You are not, under any circumstances to attempt to open this *thing* or to enter whatever on God’s green Earth is hidden behind this door. That is not a suggestion, that is an order.”

“But you don’t know what’s behind it?”

“When I started here back in 97, I was told the same as you: do not open this door. And from the tone of my supervisor, I knew to obey that order. So, no, I haven’t opened it, which is why I can’t tell you what lays on the other side.”

He paused, knocking softly on the wooden frame around the door.

“I’ve had twelve guys under my supervision since them. All of them obeyed the same order, no questions asked, all except for two.”

“What happened to them?”

“I don’t know. I just know that once they went inside, no one ever heard from them again.”

I couldn’t form adequate words to argue against him, so I just ended up staring at him with a dumbfounded expression on my face. He sighed in response.

“Look, you’re going to be sure I’m messing with you. For the next few days, even weeks, you’ll almost be certain that I’m pulling some kind of practical joke on you. So, let’s make this simple. You as much as try to open this door, and you’re fired. Got it?”

“Yeah, I got it.”

He nodded in acknowledgement, before starting to lead me back to the office.

“And one more thing,” he said, redirecting his attention to the door, again, “it might not always be right here.”

“Excuse me?”

“It moves on occasion, takes the camera with it, as well. Always one the outer walls, just not always here.”

“Then how I am I supposed to know which door it is?”

“Just look at it. It doesn’t exactly match the rest of the interior, does it?”

“I guess, but…” I trailed off.

“See that stain on the wall, next to the door?” he asked.

I nodded.

“Yeah, they definitely need to clean that. Looks like mold,” he said, completely deviating from the subject at hand.

Overwhelmed by the introduction, I left it at that and decided just to follow any rules the man had parted upon me, no matter how bizarre. He brought me back to the surveillance room, where he finally decided to introduce himself.

“Oh, right. The name’s Robert Baily,” he said, offering his hand.

“Anthony River,” I responded, shaking his hand.

“Good luck on your first day, Anthony,” Robert said, “I’ll see you in a few days.”

\*\*\*

My first shift had started, and as Robert had promised, there was little to be done but to watch the nine, or at least eight functional monitors before me. Throughout the night nothing changed, no one tried to break in, nothing malfunctioned. The aforementioned forbidden door remained in view of camera six and didn’t move throughout the night. By all means the job was boring, but secure.

And that is how it went for the next few days, weeks, months. I’d be relieved by guys who hardly exchanged two words with me at the shift’s end, only to start again the following night. On the occasional night that Robert handed the shift over to me or relieved me, I’d get the chance to exchange a few pleasantries. It wasn’t much, but it helped me slide into a comfortable routine, and with the end of each month as I was paid my salary, it felt like I had found something to keep me over for the coming couple of years.

It wasn’t until half a year had passed before something even remotely interesting would happen. It was an otherwise calm night. I had finally gotten around to checking out Robert’s recommended radio podcast, which I could vaguely recall having heard as a child. I glanced at the many monitors, as I did about once a minute, only to realize that camera number six had turned into a mess of static, accompanied by a distant screech that wasn’t coming from the monitor directly.

Remembering Robert’s advice about possible malfunctions on camera six, I didn’t think much of it, but I decided to check the warehouse out. I entered into the narrow hallway, walking through the door to the warehouse for the first time that night, where I looked for camera six. I knew it to be located on the outer, southern wall, a short distance from the surveillance room.

After a brisk walk, I was there, standing in front of a moldy stain on an otherwise empty wall. The door wasn’t there. I made a double take and scanned the rest of the wall, but there was nothing there, even the door’s accompanying camera had gone missing.

Robert had told me that the door changed locations on a whim, but up until that point I believed it had been a turn of phrase, a joke not meant to be taken literally. But sure enough, though I knew with absolute certainty where every camera in the building was located, I was standing in front of a naked wall. The door had vanished or had maybe moved just like Robert had said.

Knowing better than to search for the missing door, I returned to the surveillance room, intent on continuing my shift as if nothing had happened. But upon arrival, I was met with a full set of functioning cameras, even number six had magically switched itself back on, again showing the door that had vanished, unchanged but for the fact that it had changed to an entirely different wall.

Confirming that the door still existed, I decided to check the warehouse again, not yet ready to believe the event my own eyes were witnessing. I rushed back into the warehouse and started my search. I began with the empty southern wall where the door had originally existed, then the western, naked apart from the main exit, and then the northern wall, which had inexplicably created a new, wooden door in its build. It was really there, the door didn’t match the rest of the interior, looking akin to a fragile, wooden door taken out of a fifties residential home. It had a handle and a simple lock absent its accompanying key. For the first time, I was tempted to open it, but the earnest warnings of Robert Baily remained clear in my memory. I wasn’t ready to lose my job just yet.

Leaving it at that, I continued my shift as normal until my colleagues came to relieve me. As fate would have it, Robert was the next one in line, giving me the chance to broach the subject with him, but before I was allowed to mention the moving door, he noticed that something was off.

“It happened, didn’t it?” he asked, but it was a question he didn’t need answered.

“So, it’s true,” was all I could think to respond.

“I can’t judge your skepticism. I didn’t think it would take this long before the door moved,” he said, “though, I have to hand it to you, I’m impressed you didn’t go inside.”

“I was tempted to.”

“We call that discipline. You didn’t give in to the temptation, and if you value your life, it’s absolutely essential that you never do.”

“You really don’t have any idea what’s inside?”

“No, nor do I want to know. As I said, I’ve already lost people to whatever lays beyond the threshold of that door. As you might have noticed by now, it doesn’t exactly abide by the laws of physics we know and love.”

“I’m not going to go inside. I promise,” I said, completely believing my own statement, at least for the moment.

“Atta boy,” Robert responded as he patted me on my shoulder, letting me go home for a well-earned rest.

\*\*\*

Work continued in an undefinable haze of monotony for another year, in which the door changed locations two more times—first to the eastern wall, then back to the southern wall, placing itself directly on top of the moldy stain, covering up its unwelcome slimy presence. I stayed on task, keeping an eye on the packages, never coming around to find out what secrets they kept, nor did I intend to. The pay was, as Robert had stated: too good to risk foolish endeavors.

Everything was going splendidly, until one day it wasn’t.

Not much had changed as I arrived for the night shift that evening. The door had changed positions and was noted by Robert before I took over. He’d kept some leftover pizza saved for me from the dayshift and explained that he’d be relieving me in the morning again because one of our colleagues had called in sick.

I gave monitor number six a glance, and sure enough, the door had relocated to the western wall. Apart from the known anomaly, nothing was amiss.

“I’ve only seen it on the western wall a couple of times. It’s odd, but don’t let it worry you.”

He left me with the pizza and went home for the night, leaving me to watch my next series while the night slowly passed by. Midnight came and went without incident, and my series had reached its mid-season climax, I wasn’t going to be falling asleep anytime soon. I opened the window for a smoke, noting how quickly the box had emptied, promising myself I would reduce my cigarette intake in the coming year.

Then, as it had on a few occasions, monitor number six went dark. Thinking the door would change locations again, I paid it little attention. Minutes would pass, but when the monitor came back to life, something had changed, something that immediately sent a surge of adrenaline rushing through my veins.

“It can’t be,” I mumbled to myself as I stared intently at the monitor, now displaying the door on the western wall, open.

After almost two years on the job, I had seen the door change locations only a handful on times, always closed. During the same time, nothing of note happened during my shifts. Seeing it open for the first time was a shock on its own. And though I remained intent on following the strict orders given by Robert, I had to investigate at least a little bit more closely.

Leaving my post in the surveillance room I entered the warehouse, immediately heading for the west wall. There, in the south-western corner was the door with its accompanying camera hanging above, a red dot blinking, signifying that it was actively recording. The door itself stood wide open, revealing a narrow hallway that stretched as far as the eye could see, even beyond the boundaries of the warehouse. It was an impossible construction, yet there I stood, witnessing it with my own eyes.

It was an unprecedented situation. I wasn’t sure whether to ignore the phenomenon and return to my office, or to close the door and maybe attempt to barricade it. Two, maybe three scenarios loomed in my mind. One: maybe someone had broken in and entered the room, leaving them in unknown, but immediate danger; two: some unknown entity had broken out, now roaming within the warehouse, putting me in danger; and three: it had just opened because that’s what the door felt like that day. Just another variation of the strange phenomena.

As I stood there contemplating my next move, something called from the depths of the hallway, faint at first, barely enough to overcome the buzzing of the fluorescent lamps lining the warehouse ceiling. But then it called out again, a voice, begging for help.

“Can anybody hear me?” the voice, that of a man, called out from the hallway, far away, obscured by the dark.

“Hello?” I called back, “I can hear you!”

No response was heard. I took a few steps closer to the open door, getting a better look at the hallway beyond its threshold. The ground was lined with hardwood flooring, and the walls were covered in crisscross patterned, yellow wallpaper, partially torn and cracked from years of neglect. Warm lamps hung from the ceiling, dimly lighting up only a few sections of the hallway until it was left in complete darkness at its end.

For a moment I wondered if I’d hallucinated the calls for help, or if the door itself was purposefully messing with my mind, but after a short break, the voice called out again. It was getting closer.

“Please, I’m begging you. I need help!” he called in desperation.

“Hey, I’m here, can you hear me?” I called into the hallway, again left without a response.  

“I can’t move. Please, it hurts,” the man cried.

“I need to know where you are. Come on, just answer me. Tell me you can hear me!” I begged, but the man would not reply to anything I said, he would just keep screaming in agony and begging for a rescue.

“I don’t want to die,” he went on.

I pulled out my phone to call the police, only to be met with a useless piece of equipment not able to garner a single bar of signal. So, I rushed back into the surveillance room to use the dust-covered landline to call the police, but upon picking it up there wasn’t a dial tone or any indication that it had been active for the past decade. There was nothing I could do to call for help. I either entered and risked my own safety not to mention losing my job, or I followed the instructions given and ignored the man pleading for help.

The decision was quickly made. Though I appreciate the job, and though I remained fairly certain that the hallway beyond the door held unknown horrors, I wasn’t ready to cower in my office and let an innocent man die. I quickly jotted down a note, grabbed a heavy flashlight from the utility closet, and went to start my rescue efforts.

“Hello, can you hear me?” I asked, “do you know where you are?”

I had taken one step through the door, my hand still lingering on the door frame as I wasn’t yet entirely ready to proceed without confirmation that the man could actually hear me.

“Hello,” he responded, “can you hear me?”

It would have to suffice, and with that, I proceed to walk down the hallway. No sooner had I taken my first steps inside than I felt a remarkable increase in temperature caused by an uncomfortably heavy atmosphere. My ears popped from the pressure, causing me to wince from discomfort. I decided to call out again, hoping that he could finally hear me once I’d stepped deep enough inside.

“Where are you?” I asked.

I paused, a sudden sense of dread washing over me. I turned back, considering whether or not I should leave him be, but the door I had entered through had already closed shut. I was about to run over and kick the door down, but then the man called out again.

“Where are you?” the voice asked, the desperation turned to almost apathetic exhaustion.

“I’m here!” I responded, again getting nothing immediately in return.

Feeling I had made a terrible mistake, I returned to the entrance in an attempt at getting help for the rescue effort, but the door that had closed on me would no longer budge. It wouldn’t even rattle, as if the door had fused with its surroundings as nothing more than a decorative piece of wood to break the monotony of the wallpaper. I was sealed inside.

I started moving down the hallway, walking straight ahead as I listened intently for the man trying to communicate with me. Minutes passed, but apart from the lights above starting to dim ever so slightly there was no change in the hallway’s layout.

Step by step, I moved, darkness looming above to the point where I was forced to use my flashlight to see even a few feet ahead. Then, as I cast the light ahead, the flash was broken by a new set of walls that ended in a T-junction going left and right. I approached, met with two dimly lit hallways both bending around corners. It wasn’t until I heard another call before I knew where to go.

“I’m here,” the voice called out from hallway stretching in the left direction.

“I’m coming!” I responded.

I followed, not sure what would meet me at the end. Then, around the corner, I was met with another set of branching paths. The voice repeated its call and I diligently followed. I was moving around within a seemingly endless maze that was stretching impossibly far beyond the facility grounds. So, to mark a path leading to the exit, I started to tear pieces of wallpaper off at each junction, revealing a stone wall beneath with a faint red discoloration that felt wet to the touch.

“I’m coming,” the voice said, it’s emotion fading with each call. Something was wrong, something more than the hallway existing under impossible conditions. Whatever it was that was calling out for me, I wasn’t sure it was human.

But as I contemplated my next move I came upon the first open area of the maze—a room lined with the same floor and wallpaper. It wasn’t particularly large, nothing more than a small room, but definitely a change in the maze’s monotony, shrouded in darkness in the absence of any light source. I swung my flashlight around to get a better bearing of my surroundings when I stumbled upon something hanging from the wall. It was an odd mass covered in a smooth, drape-like structure plastered to the wall. I took a few steps closer, it was moving, expanding then retracting as if breathing. Only then did I realize the vaguely humanoid shape it held, hidden behind a pale, pink cover of what could only be flayed and stretched out, human skin, kept alive and fresh by unknown means.

There were arms, legs, even a head with non-distinct facial features in the form of empty eye sockets and a mouth with overgrown skin, moving as if desperately trying to scream, but unable to produce a single audible sound. I gasped from shock, but the person trapped appeared to be unaware of my presence. I should have been afraid, and though most of the emotions I felt could be categorized in the same realm as terror, the being fused to the wall elicited no such emotions, but rather an overwhelming sense of pity, as if instinctually knew that what hung before me was the victim and not the monster.

“What happened to you?” I asked, but they didn’t respond. I then tried to reach them with a slew of questions, asking about their name, how they got here, and if they could hear me, but no response came. In their condition, I doubted they even knew I was there.

With what I suspected to be the victim’s own skin plastered to the wall, keeping their insides trapped against the wall, there was nothing I could do to free them without killing them, though I briefly wondered if that might be the kinder course of action. In the end, having no tools but my phone and flashlight, I just reached out and put my hand on them, hoping to bring them a brief sense of comfort.

“I’m so sorry,” I whispered.

But as I stood there in disbelief, I recalled that a voice had called out for help, and if it wasn’t whoever was trapped on the wall, someone, or something else had lured me in there. Then, the voice called out again.

“What happened to you?” the voice called out, now completely rid of any human emotion, letting its mask slip as it again repeated my own words back to me.

I turned to run, only to realize that the path I’d come through no longer existed. The hallway had collapsed into itself in a twisted amalgamation of wood, stone, revealing raw flesh hidden beneath the thin, stone façade as the maze broke itself apart.

“I’m so sorry,” the voice called, now with a loud, guttural cry that reverberated through the room.

With the floor twisting around, I swiftly lost my footing and fell on my back, dropping my flashlight in the process. As I lay there, I could only witness as the room started to contract, tearing itself apart in an effort to swallow me. In the process, the lump of human fused to the wall was consumed, crushing the person trapped within, their bones shattering, their organs ripped to shreds.

I tried to crawl backwards, leaving the room into another hallway that led deeper into the maze. Once on semi-solid ground, I shot to my feet and ran blindly down the hallway, praying I could find a path that looped around, leading me back towards the exit. But instead of finding any diverging path, I was once again led into another room, this one far larger than the one before.

No sooner had I entered the room than the hallway behind me closed shut. Wherever I now found myself, I was trapped there. But, as dire as the situation was, the room appeared intact, not actively trying to eat me. Without my flashlight, I pulled out my phone to light the way, only to realize that it had shattered during the escape—without it, I was left with little more than a lighter to light up the path ahead.

The fire of the lighter was weak, not able to hit any of the room’s four walls nor the ceiling above. I stretched my arm up as high as it would reach, but above loomed nothing but a black void, stretching for a seemingly infinite distance up into nothingness. With no other options left, I started walking forwards into the darkness, praying for a miraculous escape—instead, I found something that sent shivers down my spine, an abomination that couldn’t have been conjured by my own wildest nightmares.

Before me hung a mass of flesh, similar to the one I’d found before, with pale skin stretched across it, but far larger, and with no human features that could be discerned. A large hole was revealed in its center mass, a mouth with rotten teeth of different sizes.

I froze, unable to move, not even able to form a coherent thought. The monstrosity before me remained inactive, but its mere presence had rendered me paralyzed.

“What is your name?” the thing asked in a loud, broken voice that echoed throughout the large room. 

I didn’t respond at first, still awestruck by the sight. A thought had begun to form in the back of my mind as I finally began to understand, but it was too vague. The monster needed something from me, that was the only reason I was still alive.

“Who are you?” the monster repeated.

“My name is Anthony River,” I said, “what do you want from me?”

The room fell silent for a moment, as if the mass of flesh analyzed my question.

“What do you want from me?” it repeated back to me.

“What the hell are you?” I let out in almost a scream, a mixture of anger and fear.

“I am…” it began before trailing off. “I am the memory of all of mankind. I am what remains.”

“What do you want?”

It didn’t respond. Again, the temperature increased, but the creature didn’t attack. It waited for me to speak.

“What happened to the people that came in here?” I asked.

“We are the same,” it responded.

“What does that mean?” I asked.

“We are the same,” it said again, “you will join us.”

“No,” I meekly responded.

With that, the ground started to move again beneath my feet, pulling and shifting in an attempt at making me fall. With the entrance closed, I started to move towards one of the other walls, still out of sight in the darkness. But with one misstep in the moving structure, I was sent pummeling to the ground, almost knocked unconscious in the process. I could feel myself sinking into the shifting floor, the wood and stone giving way to flesh as it began to wrap around my body.

A sharp pain shot through my chest as the floor constricted, as if something hard and small was pushing against it. I reached for my jacket to find the hip flask that had belonged to my predecessor, still filled with alcohol. Unable to claw myself out, I went for the only strategy I could think of to avoid becoming one with the collective flesh. I poured the alcohol out around me, grabbed the lighter, and lit it on fire.

Within a split second, a bright light formed on the flesh riddled floor as the alcohol combusted, spreading the flame across the dried, hardwood floor, quickly reaching the wallpaper which immediately followed suit. The flesh retracted, letting out a horrific screech as its muscles and nerves burned, producing thick, black smoke in the progress. The walls retracted as best they could, revealing an exit.

I shot to my feet, the floor to preoccupied by the fire to consume me. I started running, blind from the smoke, unable to breathe. Yet, even as the oxygen was pulled into the flames, the screeching continued, letting out a thousand agonized screams in different languages as each and every one of the victims of the flesh burned.

Using the marks in the wallpaper as a guide, I tried to make my way back to the entrance, but with the fire spreading and the smoke thickening, I couldn’t see, much less breathe. My vision began to turn blurry, and my muscles weakened. I felt my legs give in under me, and with a clouded mind, I fell to the floor, passing out before I could make an escape.

There I lay, the smoke above me, barely a thin layer of oxygen to keep me just on the brink of consciousness. My thoughts lingered on the fleshy amalgamation in the maze. I wondered how many had succumbed to its trap, and where it had come from. I wondered if the fire would kill it, or just slow it down as I died, giving it a much-needed respite before luring in its next victim. I wanted to stand up, but my body was too weak, too wounded.

Then I felt something grab onto me, and I was too weak to fight back. But rather than feeling myself getting pulled down into the ground, something lifted me up, and the grip wasn’t rough and hard like the maze had been, but soft and comforting. I looked up, seeing a familiar face glaring down at me.

“Stay with me!” Robert yelled as he pulled me away.

“How did you…” I began before finally losing consciousness.

\*\*\*

I woke up on the floor of the warehouse, Robert standing above me, and the sound of sirens blaring loudly outside. The door I entered through no longer lingered, having erased itself from the wall alongside any evidence of the fire.

“You’re going to be alright,” Robert promised, “it’s over.”

Robert looked equally pissed off and afraid, and though I didn’t quite understand how he’d found me within the maze, I’d never been happier to see a fellow human being.

“Do you realize stupid that was?” he asked.

I could only respond with a weak nod.

“We could have died, both of us.”

“I’m sorry,” I managed to get out, barely a whisper.

A squad of the fire brigade entered the warehouse, donning fire-resistant uniforms, gas masks and oxygen tanks. And though the hairs on my body had been zinged away, and my face was covered in soot, the danger had already passed, leaving the rescue team confused and annoyed. Nevertheless, with low oxygen saturation and second-degree burns covering my body, I was brought to the hospital where I was held over the course of two weeks while I recovered.

No one came to visit during the first week, not even Robert. I tried to call into work using the hospital phone, but no one answered. It wasn’t until the second week before one of the company supervisors visited to inform me that following a thorough investigation that I had been fired, and that I was no longer welcome on company properties. No questions were asked about my experiences during that night, nor would they give me the chance to explain myself.

I asked to speak to Robert, needing at least one person to understand what had happened, and why I had chosen to walk into the maze. Again, my request was denied, though they did inform me that Robert was put on administrative leave pending investigation, and without any current contact information, I’ve been unable to get ahold of him. To this day, he hasn’t made any attempts to contact me, but I keep waiting for the phone to ring. I just need to talk about this with someone that understands, and above all, I need to thank him for saving [my life.](https://www.facebook.com/richard.saxon.author)
