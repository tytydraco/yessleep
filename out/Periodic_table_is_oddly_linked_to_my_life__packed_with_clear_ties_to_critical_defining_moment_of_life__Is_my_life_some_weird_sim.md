In short, I sustained a nasty bout of acute lead poisoning, probably 70 ug/dl + (near coma sleepiness day of, awful colic beginning 1-2 weeks later enduing 1.5 months, ataxia) that left me in nasty mental shape, with all sorts of brain damage + mental illness. This was an enormous tragedy that struck me at my peak at 16 years of age, I had just finished junior year, best year of my life, summer was amazing, received 36 on ACT late June, AP test results, 5 5's 7/21, 800/800 Math 2/Chemistry SAT 2s, then this came 7/25. And here's the thing: my parents forced me to go with the threat of no celebratory dinner for these academic achievements because they thought I needed socialization (was getting weird, mom claimed), ironically this left me with little connection to these achievements and no sense of identity, just sort of being robbed of it all. But as I sort of became socially disturbed and lost connection to people I seemed to gain a sense of empathy and remorse for racism and mockery of disabled people (Flint lead poisoning was happening at same, and I had a sort of weird identity around making fun of those with down syndrome in high school). I guess I was sort of a high functioning psychopath, and yet in the 2 weeks prior to the event I had a sort of registering of the notion liberals had it right on race. But this was shallow.

Here's the weird thing:

Several things in the periodic table left me believing the whole thing was somehow meant to be, and that I was god's chosen person in part because of these "coincidences", ironically as I stumbled through college and later life semi-vegetative, yet progressively discovering these things and convincing myself to continue through life because of them. Here they are: Lead's symbol is Pb. My first and most enduring/memorable crush was Peyton Burns. 82 is lead's atomic number. My student ID is 1108. 1+1=2 0 is spacer 8. 8\*2=16, age it happened. Born on 8/3, next element over. My first name is Nick. Nickel's atomic number is 28. As opposites meant to attract? Next biggest crush has initials Sn. Atomic number 50. Tin is element closely related to lead. Person to find me dry scraping lead paint without a mask has initials Pd, like Pb with b reversed.

&#x200B;

Last person I tell about my ACT score (36) as a person who can still identify with that score has initials RK, Element with atomic number 36 has symbol Kr.

Event happens on 7/25, My zip code is 60025, 706 Beaver is my address. Address connects the 2.

&#x200B;

Supplement L-Theanine makes me feel autistic, most memorable autistic person in my life has name Theo.

&#x200B;

And holy shit, the song The Middle came playing on 7/26 (btw Dihexa helped my recover from pb poisoning, 26, DON'T TRY, DANGEROUS). And it just connected and allowed me to enter denial of the situation.

&#x200B;

Here's my interpretation of some key lyrics:"Hey, don't write yourself off yet... It's only in your head, you feel left out " - lead poisoning isn't really happening, everything will be fine"

&#x200B;

Live right now, yeah, just be yourself... It doesn't matter if it's good enough (Good enough)For someone else " - mom shouldn't have forced me to go, "let me live my life, I don't need to live up to your standards, I'm an independent and intelligent teen"

" Everything, everything will be just fine... Everything, everything will be alright, alright " - Nice and comforting, reassuring

Then I would return to this song in college, and it would sort of be my new identity, particularly the music video: It showcased the part of the college experience I most yearned for: meeting an attractive girl at a college party. And the protagonist even reminds me of me. [https://i.imgur.com/Jb3Lost.pngSome](https://i.imgur.com/Jb3Lost.pngSome)

Other weird things about me:

1. I have photographic memory
2. I recall sticking fingers in outlet as a child, being shocked, and remember this as a changing moment, almost like a beginning of current conscious
3. 16 y/o me looked a bit like Nikola Tesla, and had a right eye that resembled William Shockley's right eye
4. [https://i.imgur.com/WjzaF0u.png](https://i.imgur.com/WjzaF0u.png)
5. My nose ended up looking a bit like Benjamin Franklin's, and he was the first to discover and experiment with electricity. My theory here is somehow I may have inherited bits of these people, as though nature had put their spirit into the universe, like the first people of certain intelligence/personality to try these things to later enter another person with certain traits/intelligence. Another thing: mother enduring Chernobyl, Tesla experimented with electricity with electricity and radiation. Radiation alters genes and is passed on.
6. I seem to have had a weird link to the world, where if I make a bet with god in my mind, and I didn't always allow myself to, like guessing if something is, for example if time was exactly this, something was true. Almost always accurate.
7. I was probably too intelligent for my parents genomic set.
