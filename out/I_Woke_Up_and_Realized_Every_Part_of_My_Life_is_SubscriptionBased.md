I woke up this morning to a soft hum beneath my mattress. It used to calm me. Now it reminds me that if I don’t pay my monthly Comfort Access Renewal, the bed will start shaking violently at exactly 07:00. I hold my breath, hoping it won’t tilt too hard this time.

I make 160,000 credits a year. That used to be enough for a normal middle-class life. Now almost 75 percent goes to staying alive without penalties. Back in 2080, my father told me people could own a home, a car, and raise 2 kids. I look at my empty wallet and wonder how he could have believed that.

The bed stops humming, tilting slightly as I stand. A warning. People in my building have broken wrists from forgetting to pay. Some call it discipline. I call it a leash. I shiver and step off slowly.

I walk to the bathroom. The door scans my face and doesn’t open. A notification flashes: “Your DoorEase access has expired.” I tap the one-day pass. It costs more than breakfast. The door slides open with a grudging groan.

The mirror is fogged. Fully fogged. The MirrorClarity subscription ended last night. I consider wiping the steam, but I remember last week someone tried that and the mirror locked them out of their own reflection for 24 hours. Tamper prevention. I stare at my blurry self, wondering if I even exist anymore.

I pick up my toothbrush. The bristles retract. A subscription counter floats above it like a tiny judgmental eye. I authorize the recharge. The bristles return. Every extra minute of brushing adds a microcharge. I count silently, terrified of an accidental debt spike.

My brain implant pings. “Motor assistance for limb movement expiring in 2 hours.” I can still move, but my muscles feel like concrete. People who don’t renew shuffle slowly, dragging invisible chains. I imagine myself like that, trapped inside my own body.

The cupboard opens only halfway. WardrobeEase detected my Clothing Authenticity subscription is overdue. My shirt already has a faint stain at the collar. Permanent. They designed it to punish me if I miss even one day. I touch it nervously. It feels like shame stitched into fabric.

I step out of the apartment. The hallway lights flicker because the building didn’t hit its subscription quota this month. The elevator charges per second. Most take the stairs, which have a separate “safety railing access” subscription. I curse under my breath and climb slowly, counting every step.

Outside, my car waits. Sleek. Clean. Beautiful. Held hostage. It scans me and lists features I don’t have active. Airbags paused. Braking assistance paused. Night vision paused. Climate control paused. Even reverse mode is locked. I grip the wheel tighter.

The drive meter begins rising immediately. Sitting costs money. Breathing costs money. LungFlow Premium keeps oxygen from feeling like poison. Without it, I wheeze and cough silently, hoping no one notices.

My monthly breakdown floats on my windshield. 24,000 credits for basic human functions. 8,000 for devices that used to be bought once. I swallow hard. That leaves me with barely enough to eat.

The city passes by in flickers. Street signs blink. Only subscribers see the full map. Last month, a family drove through a toll they couldn’t see and their car shut down mid-bridge. They waited 5 hours before the rescue drone arrived. The bill almost destroyed them.

At a red light, the man beside me looks exhausted. His windows are opaque. WindowTransparency lapsed. I glance away quickly, not wanting to see what happens when a human becomes just another unpaid function.

I imagine living a single day without this. Inconvenient, yes. But free. Real. My chest tightens. I realize I haven’t felt free in years.

The light turns green. My LaneGuide subscription is active for 7 more days. Just 7. I exhale slowly, aware that every inhale costs me.

I am not owned by me anymore. The city owns me. The subscriptions own me. My life is a thousand little leashes disguised as convenience. And every month, they pull a little tighter.

It’s 3:00 AM now. Just a thought I had in the quiet hours. A simple story. A future no one wants, but somehow feels uncomfortably close. Remember this the next time your toaster wants to “upgrade.”
