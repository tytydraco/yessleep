*Lane-locking should be avoided no matter the inconvenience. Watch out for common signs that lane-locking is fast approaching:*

* *Road expansion at an increasing pace.*
* *Constellations disappearing from the sky. Stars may appear to sputter or blink out.*
* *Truck stop attendants growing cold of personality. Smiles turn to frowns. You may be ignored entirely.*
* *Increased hostility from non-human road inhabitants.*
* *A prickle on the back of your neck and the unsettling knowledge that someone or something is paying more attention to you than usual.*

*Employees are responsible for watching for and reporting any such signs. Log your trip times and compare regularly with previous trip times. Management refuses to accept liability in situations of employee inattention.*

I make no exaggeration when I inform you all that the pure terror in Randall's bulging eyes might still be the most satisfying sight of my existence.

While I’ve never been a particularly massive guy, Randall was even less so. I had at least forty pounds on his scrawny self; his attempts to push me off him were weak, pathetic things. I knelt on his chest and arms. One of my hands clamped over his mouth. The other squeezed his windpipe.

“If I let you breathe, will you scream?” I asked.

Despite my grip, he managed to jerk his head back and forth. I narrowed my eyes, then tentatively, *cautiously* loosened my grip.

He screamed.

It turned into a strangled whimper when I slapped him hard across the face. 

*What a fragile thing*, I mused. *Power*. 

People invent entire hierarchies in their minds, based on job positions, societal norms, looks, and a million other trivialities. In the end, when you get to the raw churning stomach of it, all that really gives you power over another person is what terrible things you can stomach to do to them.

A line of red trailed from Randall’s nose. His eyes were bloodshot.

“That probably didn't feel good,” I said. “Shall we try again?”

He didn't nod, but once again I pulled my hands from his throat. This time he only gasped for breath.

“You’re psycho,” he snarled. “*Insane*.”

“Indeed. A week alone on the road will do that to you.”

“We weren't trying to kill you. You should have just followed the rules.”

“I *did* follow the rules, thanks very much. Lucky for you, that isn't why I'm here.”

“*Fine*,” he spat. “Take another raise. Just let me go!”

“Wrong again.” I paused. “Yeah, I will take that though, thanks. No. I'm here because we had a bargain. I fulfilled my end. Your turn.”

“I *know*.” He wriggled to free his arms but gave up. “For goodness’ sake Brendon, you didn’t even let me say hello! You really think so low of me? That I forgot about our agreement? You could have just sat down like a *sane human being*, and we could have had this conversation civilly. You didn't even give me a chance.”

“Ah, but this *is* your chance. Please understand, I am fully prepared to harm, break, maim―fill in whatever pain-inducing verb you desire―if you try to lie to me. I haven't actually done anything to you yet, have I? Hopefully, after this warning, I won't need to. Does that make sense?”

He swore at me.

I shoved him hard against the ground, and his head smacked the wood.

“Does that make sense?”

“Okay! Just let me up. I'll answer your questions.”

I did. I patted under his desk for a panic button (nothing) and sifted through his drawers for a gun (none). Finally, I gestured for him to take his seat. His receding hair was in disarray, his chin dripping with blood. I remained standing between him and the locked door.

“No lies,” I said.

“What do you want to know?”

“What was the thing in the trailer?”

He grimaced, sighed, and raised his hands in submission. “Honestly? I don't know. Management is secretive. They won't―”

I punched him in the face.

Pretty much all I knew about punching was to keep your thumb outside your fist. Otherwise, you might break it. Judging by the crunching, the screaming, and the altogether outpouring of blood, I guessed I’d done a decent job. 

I shook the pain from my own arm. “I repeat. No lying. Do we understand this time?”

He clutched his nose―broken for sure―and moaned. Blood flowed from his cupped hands.

I pulled back my arm. “*Understand?”*

He whimpered but nodded and shrank back into his seat, pale and shuddering.

“Very good,” I said. “Let’s try once more. What was the thing in my trailer?”

But first.

A pause. 

To understand the disaster that comes next, I need to rewind a few weeks, explain a few things. I realize now that while I’ve done a decent job at describing my experiences on Route 333, I’ve woefully neglected saying much about headquarters.

From what I can tell, other trucking companies often have things separated out. The truck yard is in one place. Offices and dispatch (not that most have dispatch the same as us) might be in another. Here though, it’s all lumped together: one enormous parking lot at the edge of the forest, a mile or two from the nearest town. A double story office building at the center. Route 333 starts just a few bends of the road away.

The truck yard is the same place we pick up our rigs, drop off our keys, and hang out before we head home. It’s rare we overlap, but when we do, it somehow always turns into a group of us, not just two or three―maybe the others plan this in a secret chat without me?

Despite my ever-deepening people-aversion, I don’t mind running into other truckers. Even if they’re decades older than me. They’re usually *also* people-averse people, which makes the exchanges easier. *Oh, you feel awkward too? Great! Let’s keep this quick.* 

We congregate in the breakroom to chat, grab sodas, or when there’s enough of us, an occasional round of poker. So it was a few weeks ago, when I discovered―after six consecutive rounds of sliding red chips into the pot―that I was, in fact, incompetent at poker.

“‘K, I’m out,” I said.

“*Bah*.” Chris shoved a cigarette in his mouth. He couldn’t actually smoke them inside, but he liked the “taste,” apparently? “You’ve still got more chips.”

“That’s sort of the point. Leave while I’m ahead.”

“You’re behind.”

“Leave while I’m *less* behind,” I clarified.

“What are they teaching young people these days?” Deidree said. “First, no more smoking with your teachers. Now, no more gambling addictions?”

“We’ve really gone off the deep end,” I agreed.

Vikram pulled the sizable pot of chips to join his mountain of a pile. “Entertaining as this has been, I must agree with the boy. I should be getting home.”

“*Garbage*,” Chris said. “You’re just high-tailing it with our money before we can win it back.”

“With what?” Vikram eyed Chris’ handful of white chips―even more pitiful than my own. “*Those*?”

“Just a few more rounds,” Deidree insisted.

“Really. My wife will be expecting me.”

“Message her you’ll be late,” Chris said.

“Not likely,” Vikram said. “There is never reception here.”

Deidree rolled her eyes. I had to agree. I’d almost never had an issue sending messages or calling.

“No really,” Vikram insisted. He demonstrated his phone and the *No signal* tag.

“Let me see that,” Chris said, and Vikram passed it. “Looks fine to me. 5G and everything. See.”

We did see. And when Chris passed it back, we all saw the *No signal* tag that popped once again onto the screen.

That’s how we learned about the *line*.

It took some experimenting. We tested with each of our phones and carriers, but eventually, we learned an invisible line perfectly bisected the breakroom. On one side? Full bars. On the other? Not even texts could get through.

“You guys didn’t know about this?” I asked.

Deidree shook her head. “I’m usually connected to the Wi-Fi. Suppose it makes sense, though, since we’re a ways from town in the middle of a building.”

“Let’s not forget the important thing,” Chris said. “Vikram can now text his wife and I can now win back my money.”

Vikram did.

Chris didn’t.

“It wasn’t human,” Randall said. “If that’s what you’re worried about.”

His voice came out stuffy, as if he’d shoved his nose full of cotton balls. He spit blood in the trashcan under his desk. 

“It was an impossibility,” Randall said. “That’s what we call them―*impossibilities.* Paradoxes manifested in the physical. Things from another place. Sometimes, they’re alive like the one from your most recent trip, but usually you’re only transporting non-sentient ones. Physical paradoxes and whatnot.”

“Like what?”

“They’re not comprehensible. That’s the issue. Plants that are both alive and dead. Water cups that are both full and empty. They’re an infection. If you leave them too long somewhere in the real world, they start to spread and affect stable things around them. I once heard of an entire neighborhood where every person turned inside out because the impossibility didn’t get taken care of in time.”

“Well, the thing in my freight sounded like a person,” I said. “A child. Crying.”

“First off, you shouldn't have been talking to it. Second, the forest-dwellers sound human enough too. The inhabitants of the road, the ones who work at the gas stations―they all seem like people, but they’re not real.”

“They are.” I remembered what Tiff told me nearly ten days ago now. “They’re just a different type of real.”

“Sure, fine, whatever you need to believe. They aren't human, though. That thing in your trailer? Do you know any child who could go five days without food or water?”

“It was still alive.”

“It was *malevolent*,” Randall said. “If you’d let it out, that thing would have dissected you piece by piece in whatever order kept you alive the longest.”

My teeth gritted. “I don’t believe you.”

He snorted―or tried to. The wince on his face reminded both of us his nose was still very much broken. “Claim what you will, but you haven't punched me again, Brendon. Inside, even you know I’m telling the truth. Whatever obsessive parental attachment you formed with that thing was one-sided. Let it go. It wasn’t a person. It was cunning. Enough so it knew the only way you might let it go was by not asking you to let it go at all.”

“Maybe it was a scared child that didn't know to ask.”

“Why can’t you accept you were helping remove something evil? This should be a good thing. You didn’t do anything wrong. *Hurray*.”

Why exactly *didn’t* I want to believe Randall? Ever since the earth had opened up, ever since the shrieking and crunching and that terrible silence, my stomach had churned endlessly. For five days that one sickening moment had repeated in the back of my mind like the hum of an air conditioner. Occasionally forgettable. Always present.

*It doesn’t have to.* 

*It could stop.*

Here was my out, juicy and ripe for the plucking. The creature had been trying to trick me. I’d been smart in resisting it. I’d done the *right* thing.

“You can’t stand yourself,” Randall said.

“What?”

The shift in his voice was so sudden, I experienced a wave of vertigo.

“That was why you took this job, wasn’t it? You were trying to run from something in your old life, but you’ve realized the thing you were running from was you all along.”

“You don't know anything about me.” 

“You despise yourself, and now you look for any excuse to continue despising yourself.”

Here Randall was, covered in blood from a wound *I’d* given him and yet he’d once again resumed his position of authority. His hands were folded neatly. His body bent just a degree in my direction as if to signal that, *Yes, Brendon. I am still your owner. In the end, you will still do what I say and believe what I tell you.* Any trace of his fear for me was gone, replaced entirely by smugness. 

So infuriatingly smug.

“You know what I think?” I asked. “I think if our cargo really *were* so evil, you and the rest of management would have told all of us from the start. Why shouldn’t you? Me and the rest of your lackeys would be more than happy to help out―instead, you hide the truth, which means there’s something that’s worth hiding. That’s what I think.”

I drew a box cutter from my pocket, extended the blade, and rested it on the desk.

Randall’s smirk faltered.

“Let’s continue,” I said.

“You forgot these!”

I trotted up to Chris, dangling his keys, who waited for me at the doors of his rig. We’d both just come from a breakfast with Tiff (breakfast at Tiffany’s, yeah, yeah, I got it). Even rarer than the days when we all happened to meet in the breakroom were the days we happened to meet up at Tiff’s diner.

 I think we all went out of our way, if merely subconsciously, to fill up at her truck stop when reasonably justifiable and visit for a few minutes. She was lonely. She had no one. When she heard we were coming over her radio, she would spend hours preparing a full-buffet breakfast of burnt bacon, watery eggs, and soggy pancakes. The least we could do was eat.

Plus, she was still the only place to get a decent cup of coffee.

“Much obliged,” Chris said, taking the keys. “Don’t tell management, but my memory’s not what it used to be.”

“Happens to all of us.”

He sighed. “Maybe―you know, sometimes I forget the way to Route 333. I leave from dispatch, and I just… *forget*. It isn’t even far. It all just looks unfamiliar.”

I considered. “You are pretty old.”

He laughed and slapped me on the back of my head. “I’ll still whoop you in poker.”

I laughed too―he wouldn't though. 

Chris was worse at poker than me.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

“Route 333 is a corridor between two worlds,” Randall continued. “Or possibly multiple worlds. We don’t know totally, just that it’s the only way to get rid of the impossibilities.”

“It sounds like they keep getting through though. Wouldn't it be better to seal off the road entirely?”

Randall shook his head. “Paradoxes fall randomly into our world, not by the road. There's whole teams dedicated to predicting where and when. Route 333 is merely one of the stable ways to get them back.”

“Okay.” I tried to wrap my head around this all. “So we’re taking them back to the place they came from. That’s what our cargo is.”

“Not exactly.”

I gripped the box cutter and nodded pointedly at it.

“Gosh Brendon, take a Xanax. I’m *trying* to explain this. It’s not so simple, okay? The highway is like…well, like nothing. It’s like the nothing between the repelling sides of two magnets. It’s not actually its own thing. All it wants is that these two magnets don’t touch. 

“You’re not taking things back to their origin, because the road won’t let you. It recognizes you don’t belong over there and it stops you―or tries to. Someone like you who can traverse the road so quickly could probably make it. It would take weeks. You’d be driven mad by the time you arrived, but you could do it. Usually, the most we can do is drop them off far out on the highway and hope they take up residence.”

“The creatures on the road,” I started, “the Faceless Man and Highway Patrol, they’re all just living impossibilities we removed from this world?”

“Some of them. Others we’re not so sure about. Faceless Man has his own set of rules―I'm not sure if he was our doing or something else entirely. The forest-dwellers were cargo once though, long before my time.”

“But they’re so close. Why don’t they just come back?”

“Close for you,” Randall said. “For them? They’re hundreds of years from escaping. Like I said, the road knows they don’t belong here.”

“They’re lane-locked,” I said.

For a moment, just a moment, Randall’s expression faltered. Almost like… guilt, perhaps?

“Why did they all want the thing in my trailer?” I asked.

“The road can be known to make deals at times. They trap another living impossibility in their place and get to proceed freely. They could cross back to our world in hours. Just as long as the balance of it all is maintained.”

“The road is sentient then?”

“Not in the sense you’re thinking. A computer isn’t sentient, but it calculates.”

“Is it evil?”

“Is a computer evil?” Randall threw back at me.

*Fair enough.*

Everything he’d explained…it raised so many more questions, but there was a sense of overall cohesion. The explanation flowed quickly. He wasn’t merely spouting off nonsense or making up lies. There were so many more things I needed to ask―why no phones, what about the meat storm, who collected these impossibilities―but one question would drive to the heart of it all.

“Why don’t you just tell us?” I asked. “If this is all true, if we’re really preventing infections in the real world, then why not just include this as a section in the employee manual? Why so much mystery?”

“To be fair, you haven’t even read the employee manual.”

“I’ve read *most* of it!” I calmed myself. “It isn’t in it though, right?”

“Nah.”

“Then why?”

He shifted uncomfortably. He made a grand show of glancing at the clock. Stalling. I’d hit on something. We’d finally reached the part Randall was truly dreading.

“My shift ended half an hour ago,” he said. “They’re going to come looking for me. You can’t keep me here forever.”

“I can for now.”

“What will you do when somebody else comes? Fight both of us? This was a dumb idea, and you know it. Let me go now and I promise―”

I slammed my fist on the desk. “Answer the question!”

“They’ll see my car,” Randall continued. “They’ll *know* I’m here. They’ll come find me.”

I laughed. “They won’t see a thing. The streetlight was burnt out. Your office door is closed. We have all night.”

“Are you joking?” His voice was calm, slow, each word enunciated. His eyes were wide. “The streetlight. Was it really out?”

“Uh… yeah?”

I’ve never understood what it meant for somebody’s face to go white. I always assumed it was an expression, a way to say “scared” or “nervous”, a descriptive phraseology if you will. 

Turns out I was wrong.

Randall’s face went entirely, completely white.

He swore. “We need to go. I’m not joking. This isn’t me trying to get out of our interrogation. Brendon, if the streetlight is really out, it might already be too late.”

“We’re staying,” I snarled. “I’m not falling for another lie.”

“I’ll answer anything you want later, literally anything, I swear it on my wife and kids―

“You don't have kids.”

“―on my *future* kids, okay! But we need to go.” His voice lowered to a whisper. “*Please*.”

It was that word that caught me off guard. I’d seen Randall in a variety of situations now. I’d seen him angry and laughing, smug and terrified. I’d never, however, heard him *beg.*

It took me so by surprise, it might have actually worked. I might have believed him and put down the switchblade and done what he said…

Before I could, he seized a glass mug and lobbed it at the one and only light.

The light snapped out. Glass shattered. Out of instinct, I covered my head to avoid the raining shards, just enough time to miss the scramble at a lock. The opening of a door.

“NO!” I roared, but he was already gone.

I tore after him, down the hall. All lights except the late-night emergency ones were out and the luminescent EXIT signs. Shadows lengthened. I caught the flash of a heel around the corner. The slam of a hallway door.

I knew where he was going: down the stairs. I took a side stairwell. Just as he reached the bottom floor, I launched myself at him. We toppled.

Randall screamed and kicked under my weight. “You don’t understand!”

It was true. I didn’t. Very likely, something very terrible was about to occur, but what I *did* know was that I was fed up. No more half-truths and blind orders. I’d spent a week thinking I was protecting some helpless creature. Maybe it hadn't been, but I’d *thought* it was. My life was whiplash, existential crisis after existential crisis, and I didn't even get to know *why*. 

“What aren’t you telling me!” I demanded.

“Let me go!”

I shoved him, once, twice, *thrice* against the ground. *You’re not leaving. You’re not escaping. I am the one in control.* “Answer!”

“We know,” he gasped. “Before a trucker gets lane-locked, we always know.”

“*What!*”

“It’s a trade. Them for you newbies. There are signs we don’t tell you about. Route 333 marks the next candidate it wants to claim, and we make sure it gets them. Otherwise, none of you could traverse Route 333. We can't let that happen. It’s too important.”

“Who’s next!” I demanded.

“Chris. Now, let me go. *Please*.”

Some subconscious, simmering part of me wanted to hit him, to *keep* hitting him until he was nothing but a bloody pulp. A different part of me, though, did what he asked.

Randall stumbled to his feet, gasping in the gloom of the reception room.

“How dare you all,” I said. “You sacrifice us like―”

“We’re not alone.” He tapped his lips with a single finger and signaled at the street-facing windows.

It was all I needed to shut up. The mood shift was stark and definite. As much as I loathed him, as much as my blood boiled and my fists screamed to lash out, I forced myself to crouch next to him behind the reception desk. 

In the darkness of the parking lot, something moved. 

“What is it?” I whispered.

“Something only the streetlights were keeping at bay. Our circuits must have tripped.”

“Why would that matter? Isn’t the city powering the streetlamps?”

“We aren’t part of the city.”

“That doesn’t make any sense.”

“We’re on the road.”

It took a full ten seconds for me to register what he meant. Not just any road. We were on *that* road. Dispatch was located on Route 333.

I nearly told him he was wrong. The idea was ridiculous. The highway didn’t start for a few more streets. We were safe here. I’d used my *phone* in the truck yard, for goodness sake, and no meat storm had ever appeared.

Then I remembered the breakroom―the clear line of reception vs. no reception. What if it wasn’t just the breakroom? What if headquarters was divided by the boundary between two worlds, a boundary that didn't allow communication from one side to the other?

And Chris. Telling me he would forget the way from dispatch to the start of Route 333. What if he wasn’t forgetting? What if the way was just changing? *Lengthening*.

Randall and I held our breath as the thing outside once again shifted.

“I hate you,” I said.

“I assure you, the[ feeling’s mutual.](https://www.reddit.com/r/lucasGandola/comments/1lklmnq/welcome/)”
