My wife, Mia, and I recently moved into this beautiful new town to start our new life together. The house we bought was just built in this small neighborhood, with the main road connecting to the town itself. When we bought the house, we were the first and only couple to bid for it, which was weird because the town itself seemed like it was heaven on Earth. There was literally zero crime reported, and everyone was happy; there wasn’t even a police station built because there was no need for one. It almost seemed too good to be true. As a result, I was a little suspicious of it, but my wife urged me to buy it because we both agreed we wanted to get our new life started as soon as possible. Looking back now, I should’ve said no to her and acted like this town never existed.

The first day we moved in, everything was perfect. We didn’t have a lot to move in, so we didn’t really need help. The house already came furnished, so that made it easier for both my body and my wallet. After I finished unboxing the living room and putting everything away, I heard a knock on the door. I opened it, and it was an older gentleman smiling with his wife standing right next to him, holding a tray of cookies.  
  
“You must be the new folks,” he said, smiling.

“Yep, that’s us,” I replied, trying to match his enthusiasm. 

“Lovely, I’m Jim, and this is my wife, Sarah. We live a few houses down from here. We just wanted to stop by and say hello.” 

“Nice to meet both of you, and I’m Ryan,” I replied with a smile on my face.

“Sarah made these for you,” he said, nodding toward the tray. “If you ever want more, just stop by. She’s always baking.”

I chuckled, thanked her, and took the cookies graciously.

“Where’s your wife?” Sarah asked.

“Oh, she just went upstairs to take a nap; she’s exhausted from all this moving we have been doing,” I replied.

They chuckled like any stereotypical old couple you see on TV.

“Tell her we said hello then,” Jim said. “We’ll see you around.”

He then handed me a sticky note with their home phone number on it in case there was anything we needed. I chatted with them for a few more minutes, and they went on their way. The cookies admittedly smelled delicious, and I had one. They tasted a bit odd for my liking, but they were still comforting, nonetheless. I wasn’t really that big of a social person throughout my life, so people coming to my door made things a lot easier for me. I put the cookies on the kitchen counter and proceeded to turn on the TV to relax a bit. I was going through the channels hoping to find something interesting, but then I noticed something odd: there were only five channels to choose from. Four of them were local news stations, and the other was your generic movie channel. 

*How does a town of only a hundred people need four different news stations?* I thought.

As I was watching the movie, Mia came down the stairs looking even more cute in her bed head and headed towards the kitchen. I always found her natural beauty more attractive. 

“Since when did you start baking?” she asked, smiling.

“Never,” I said. “The neighbors stopped by earlier and brought them over.”

She came over, cookie in hand, and proceeded to lie on my chest, watching the movie with me. I’ll admit, even though it was our first day here, I have never felt more at home. After an hour had gone by, the movie finally ended, and I saw how dark it was getting, so I proceeded to go upstairs with her to get ready for bed. Mia is a heavy sleeper, so it doesn’t take long for her to fall asleep. I got used to coming out of the bathroom and her already being out cold. I’m more of a night owl, so I usually spend an hour either reading or doing some last-minute work before I eventually doze off. 

This time, though, as I was reading, something felt off. It was unusually quiet outside. There was no chatter, wind, or even bugs making any kind of noise. It’s almost as if it felt staged. I didn’t really think anything of it until I started to close my eyes.

It started with the sound. 

A low, distant rumble that didn’t belong in a neighborhood this quiet, deep enough that I felt it through the mattress before I fully registered it. At first, I thought it was thunder, but the vibration didn’t fade; it only grew heavier, layered, like multiple engines moving in slow unison. The floor beneath the bed trembled faintly, the kind of movement you feel more than hear.

Then the light appeared. 

A harsh white glow cut through the window in the corner, sliding across the wall and climbing the ceiling in a slow, deliberate sweep. I couldn’t see outside, only the beam’s reflection and the warped shadows it dragged along the curtains as it moved. The engines idled somewhere below, close enough to make the glass hum softly. No voices followed. No sirens. Just the steady presence of something passing through.

A brief crackle of static broke the silence, sharp and sudden, before cutting out just as quickly. The light lingered for a moment longer, then drifted away, and the engines began to roll on. When the darkness returned, it did so instantly, swallowing the room whole. The silence that followed felt heavier than before, like it was waiting to see if I would move. I couldn’t sleep after that. I just laid there, staring at the ceiling, listening for something, hell ANYTHING, to break the silence other than my beating heart. When the sun finally began to rise and pierce the same window, I reached over and gently shook Mia’s shoulder, needing to know I wasn’t alone in what I’d heard,

She stirred, blinked at me, and frowned.

“What’s wrong, honey?” she asked softly. “You look exhausted.”

I hesitated before asking, already unsure of myself.

“Did you hear… anything last night?” I asked, my voice shaking.

She thought for a moment, then smiled softly and rested her head back on my chest.

“No,” she said. “Nothing at all.”

As I laid there holding her, watching the sunlight fill the room, I wondered why she sounded so certain and why, despite everything, part of me felt relieved to hear her say it.
