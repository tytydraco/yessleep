Hello, NoSleep.   
I had been perusing this thread for a while until I realized that this would be the perfect place for someone like me to write down what's been happening to me as of late. 

Now, for background context as to why I think this way, I need to state the following for you to understand: 

1.) I am a 35-year-old man that lived alone in a remote neighborhood along the outskirts of Chicago for 10 years. 

2.) I have never had a wife or kids that were mad at me, and my parents died years ago, so I have zero living family who could possibly be doing what I am about to describe to you. 

3.) I have exactly three personal nurses that tend to my needs, ( food, water, wheeling me around, etc.)   Their names are Jason McComb, (24 male), Elena Sanchez (30 female), and Garry Willcox ( 28 male.) These three individuals are always around me, as my condition doesn't allow me to use the majority of my basic motor functions by myself. 

4.) I was checked into the hospital because I felt as if I could not exist in the world anymore without my "substances". Without them, I felt and still feel as if I am not whole. The meds they make have made me forget the type of substances I was taking. 

The people here thought I was insane, but I know something they don't, I know what they've been doing to their patients. 

Now that that's out of the way I hope you'll be able to fully understand my situation, as I've been made to feel like I'm a fucking lunatic and I'm sick of it. 

Ever since I checked myself into the hospital the patients that I used to socialize with disappeared. There's almost zero evidence of them ever being here either, as their stays usually look like this:  
1.) check in   
2.) be given a room  
3.) go to the recreation center and chat with me   
4.) they disappear in the next week 

I think the people who run the hospital have just been trying to keep my friend's disappearances as covert as possible. It would completely ruin their reputation. So far, there have been exactly 10 of my friends missing since I checked myself in in the midst of the lockdown.

 That's exactly why it must be the nurses, or they have to have some huge part in whatever this scheme is. 

It makes total sense, as all of them have sob stories of their loved ones needing organ transplants, or something that would require their vital organs. Elena's brother was on the brink of death and needed a heart transplant but suddenly got better,  Jason has been rumored to sell the organs to make an extra buck, and Garry is just plain crazy. 

I know it has to be them, it just has to be. The most recent example of my new friend Becca should confirm it. 

Becca was an odd-looking woman in her mid-thirties, and while she was odd I couldn't help but find her enticing. She was everything that I looked for in a friend, someone to keep me company as long as I would be staying here under my nurses' orders. We met in late October of 2022 and hit it off right away. We were so alike, we both enjoyed the band Abba, both agreed that Friends was the shittiest TV show to ever exist, and best of all we both thought there was something up with the nurses. 

She had seen how off they sounded and looked around me, they gave me cruel and ugly stares that made me feel horrible. It was almost as if they were looking right through me.. like they knew that I knew, and when I mentioned it she saw it too. I told her that these people were trying to steal any human contact away from me because if I had nobody to confide in then their dirty secrets would never be unveiled. 

We confided in each other about how these people have been monsters, and how selfish they were to be so ignorant of their residents' feelings. We chatted during the same time for about two weeks before I invited her back to my room to come forward about the ordeal. That was the last night that I saw her.

I knew that it wasn't a good idea, I should've known that those monsters inside would have gotten to her. 

We were sitting down on the wooden table placed in the middle of my room, sharing a drink before the meds that those damned nurses gave me finally wore off, I finally had my substance, and Becca was the dealer. 

I whipped the butcher knife out of my coat pocket, and cut her thumb off, warm blood oozing out of her severed hand. I gobbled up the substance, merely satisfied. I then bit into her right leg before I stopped myself, knowing I wouldn't be able to survive without the rest of her so I had to wait until I ate again. 

I put tape over her mouth and tied her up and threw her into the closet. I kept all of my friends in there before those damned nurses came in and took them back to their homes. I wondered how much longer I would have had with her before she was taken away from me. 

I think it has to be Jason if I were to suspect one of the three, as he's always the one that comes into my room after inviting my friends to my room to bring them back to their rooms, and he's always the one that tells me I have to stay here longer and I'll never see my friends ever again. 

So, now I hope you believe me that the nurses that work at the hospital are evil, and hopefully one of you guys could come down and help me out!
