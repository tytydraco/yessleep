The hall darkens, swallowing the light like it's alive.

Each step I take echoes into the void, then dies. No return sound. No comfort in knowing the space around me. Only the abyss ahead. The air is brisk, and unnaturally cold—the kind that doesn't just touch your skin, but seeps into your ribs, wrapping around your heart like a tightening fist.

I move forward. One step. Another. My boots scrape against cracked concrete. My breath comes slow, shallow, trying to make no sound. Without realizing it, I start counting.

One. Two. Three.

By twenty, I see it.

The thing that Luke was hunting. *"If I am not back in an hour, don't follow. Just run, understood?"* That was five hours ago, and if it's here and he is not... No. He is stronger than that. He's a soldier, and my best friend, my anchor. The man who pulled me from the twisted metal of that bus, whose hands never shook when the sky rained fire. He's the one who taught me how to tell if water was safe by smell alone, how to sleep with one ear open, and how to shoot without closing my eyes. He never asked for thanks. Never once made me feel like a burden. When the dark pressed in, Luke made me believe we could still push it back.

My heart races at the thought of him alone and hurt, or maybe worse. I will save him. I *have* to save him.

It stands ahead—a walking ruin of what used to be a man. Decayed flesh clings to its bones like wet paper. It sways in a slow rhythm, like a song only it can hear. Its head hangs forward, oblivious to me. My flashlight bathes it in harsh light. Blood stains spread across its torn shirt from battles untold, the tatters of its jeans hanging loose around skeletal legs.

Before the world rotted, he could have been anyone—a neighbor, a father, a man with morning coffee and a half-read newspaper. But now he's reduced to nothing but hunger.

I search the shadows for any sign of Luke, but there's only emptiness. My fingers tighten around the rifle. Luke always told me hesitation killed faster than any monster. I steady my breath, lining up the shot—

Something shifts behind me.

Not a sound I hear, but one I feel—a tremor through the floor. A subtle quiver in my bones.

The smell hits first: wet, rancid meat, sharp copper, and a sweetness like fruit rotting in the sun. Then comes the breath—hot, damp, and heavy on the back of my neck.

I turn, almost falling in my panic.

The Beast's chest is the first thing I see. Broad. Wrong. Its skin is a deep purple where rot hasn't yet claimed it. Where its jaw should be, there's only a torn cavity, strands of muscle twitching faintly. Above, two empty sockets lock on me. I feel its stare like ice water poured into my veins.

It moves first.

Its arm whips out—the impact shatters my ribs before I even realize it's swinging. I barely have time to brace before I'm airborne, slamming into the wall behind me. Pain flares hot and bright. My M4 clatters as it flies from my grasp, metal ringing against stone before settling just out of reach.

It steps over the weapon in its hunt for the next meal. Each meaty footfall sends a shiver through the ground, as if the earth itself fears it. My hope fractures with every step.

But Luke... Luke's the reason I'm still breathing. He's patched me up after fights that should have ended me. Pulled me away when I wanted to stay and die.

I will **NOT** let him die here.

I tear my knife from its sheath. The sound of metal on leather cuts through the silence. I swing with everything I have. The blade bites deep into the side of its skull. A crunch runs up my arm as it lodges in bone.

It doesn't stop moving.

No flinch. No stagger. Just the slow, steady turn of its head toward me.

The next blow comes fast—its left hand swings wide. I duck, only for its right to slam into my head. My skull rattles like loose bolts in a jar. The wall behind me crumbles under the force. I drop to the floor.

I taste blood.

The world tilts. My arms refuse to lift me. My legs feel foreign, disconnected.

I can't move.

It looms over me, shadow swallowing what little light is left. Slowly, it raises one arm for the finishing strike

Is this how it ends? Alone?

**BANG!**

The gunshot tears through the moment, swallowing every other sound. My ears ring as a bullet rips through the side of the creature's head, ricocheting off my knife's blade still in the monster’s skull. The thing folds inward and collapses beside me.

A tall figure steps out of the dark—broad shoulders, blond hair damp with sweat, blue eyes catching the weak light.

It’s him. Luke.

My breath catches.

He holds out a hand. I reach for it, but my knees give out. Luke grabs my arm before I fall, hauling me upright.

"You okay?" His voice is steady, but his eyes scan me for damage.

"I've been better," I gasp out with a shaky laugh.

"Let's get you back." His voice is as strong and comforting as ever.

"Thank—" I start, but everything changes in an instant. A small canister, no bigger than a bottle, flies into the room. Luke's eyes widen in recognition his hand flies to shield my own but just a bit too slow.

The ringing in my ears swells to a deafening roar. Hands—someone's hands—grab me, pulling me down. The last of my strength slips away, draining like water through cracked stone.

From light to darkness.

And then, nothing.

CHP.2

Consciousness returns like surfacing from deep, black water.

The first thing that hits me is the smell—sharp disinfectant trying to drown something rotten underneath. Chemicals burn my nostrils, but beneath it lurks the sweet-sick stench of decay. My stomach lurches before I'm even fully awake.

Cold metal presses against my spine. Every muscle in my body feels like it's been wrung out and left to dry. When I try to move, leather bites into my wrists. My ankles too. The straps are old but strong, worn smooth by how many others who've lain here before me?

The room swims into focus through the haze of whatever they pumped into me. Dim fluorescent light flickers overhead, casting everything in sickly yellow. Concrete walls. No windows. A single door with a small glass panel, dark on the other side.

My jacket hangs on a chair across the room like a taunt—close enough to see, far enough to hurt. Someone cut my shirt away. Crude black stitches march along my left side, the skin around them angry and swollen. When I turn my head, bandages pull tight against my skull, and the world tilts sideways.

Voices drift through the door. Low. Clinical.

"What's the situation with the first subject, Jen?" The man's voice carries the kind of authority that's used to being obeyed.

"Extensive trauma. Multiple fractures, severe blood loss." The woman—Jen—speaks like she's discussing livestock. "He's stabilized, but barely responsive. Not viable for the program."

Luke. They're talking about him like he's already dead.

My chest constricts. The leather straps suddenly feel tighter, cutting off circulation. I want to scream his name, to demand they tell me where he is, but something keeps me silent. He taught me that—sometimes staying quiet keeps you alive longer.

"And the other?"

"Concussion, lacerations, but stable. Young. Strong. They'll do well in Phase One."

Phase One. The words settle in my stomach like swallowed glass.

I've heard whispers about places like this. Research facilities that popped up after the world ended, run by people who decided the collapse was an opportunity rather than a tragedy. Luke called them vultures—picking over the bones of civilization for anything useful.

The door swings open with a soft hiss.

A short man in a pristine white coat steps in, wire-rimmed glasses catching the harsh light. He moves with the careful precision of someone who's never had to fight for his next meal, never slept with one ear open. His hands are soft, unmarked by the violence that's shaped the rest of us.

"Good morning, Alex." His smile is practiced, empty. "I hope you're feeling better."

The casual use of my name makes my skin crawl. How does he know it? How long have I been here?

"Who the hell are you?" My voice comes out rougher than I intended, scraped raw.

"Dr. Marcus Chen. And you're in a very special place." He pulls up a small metal stool, settling himself just close enough to make me uncomfortable. "You've been through quite an ordeal, haven't you? That creature you encountered—we've been tracking it for weeks."

"Where's Luke?"

His expression doesn't change, but something flickers behind his eyes. "Your companion is being treated. His injuries were... extensive."

"I want to see him."

"I'm afraid that's not possible right now." He adjusts his glasses, the gesture somehow making him look more predatory. "But let's focus on you. You showed remarkable resilience out there. Survival instincts like yours are exactly what we're looking for."

The word 'looking' sits wrong in my mind. "For what?"

"To help rebuild. To create something better than what we lost." His voice takes on the fervor of a true believer. "The old world failed, Alex. Weak. Unprepared. But from its ashes, we can forge something stronger."

I think of Luke's hands pulling me from the wreckage of that bus. His voice in the dark, teaching me how to stay alive. The way he never asked for thanks, never made me feel like dead weight. That's true ***strength***. Not whatever sterile nightmare this man is peddling.

"You're insane."

His smile never wavers. "I prefer '*visionary*.' Now, I need you to remain calm while we begin the preliminary assessments. The restraints are for your own safety—the medication can cause disorientation."

"What medication?"

But he's already standing, moving toward the door. "Rest now. Tomorrow we begin in earnest."

The lock clicks behind him, leaving me alone with the flickering light and the smell of chemicals masquerading as cleanliness.

I lie still for a long moment, listening. Footsteps fade down what sounds like a long corridor. Somewhere in the distance, machinery hums. And underneath it all, if I strain, I can hear something else—voices, maybe. Or screaming.

The strap on my left wrist has seen better days. The leather is cracked, worn thin in places. Whoever buckled it didn't account for how much weight I've lost since the world ended. I work my thumb against the metal, feeling for give.

Luke's voice echoes in my memory: *Always look for the weakness. Every system has one.*

The buckle shifts. Just a fraction, but enough. I twist my wrist, ignoring the bite of leather against bone, until my hand slips free. The relief is immediate and dizzying.

The other straps follow more easily. When I sit up, the room spins like a carnival ride, and bile rises in my throat. I grip the edges of the metal table until my knuckles go white, breathing through my nose until the worst of it passes.

A medical cart sits beside the table, loaded with supplies. Gauze, bandages, bottles of clear liquid with labels I can't pronounce. And there, nestled between the ordinary medical supplies like it belongs—

A syringe filled with electric blue liquid.

The label makes my blood run cold:

*NEURAL ENHANCEMENT SERUM - BATCH 7* *For cognitive acceleration and pain suppression* *WARNING: EXPERIMENTAL - Effects unknown* *Administer only to consenting subjects* ***WARNING:*** ***DOSES OVER 10ML MAY LEAD TO DEATH*** 

Consenting. Right.

But beneath my fear, something else stirs. If this is what they plan to pump into me anyway, maybe I can control when and how. Maybe I can use it.

Luke always said knowledge was the best weapon. Even poisoned knowledge.

I hate needles. The sight of them makes my stomach turn and my hands shake. But I hate being helpless more.

The syringe is cold in my palm. The blue liquid inside seems to glow with its own light, like something from a nightmare. I think of Luke—his steady hands when everything around us was chaos, his voice cutting through my panic: *Do what you have to do to survive.*

I find a vein on my inner arm, press the needle against skin that's already marked by too many small traumas, and push the plunger. Making sure not to go over the 10ml mark still leaving over 40ml

Fire races through my veins.

At first, nothing

 But then the world explodes into sensation—every nerve ending suddenly alive and screaming. Colors become too bright, sounds too sharp. I can hear my own heartbeat like thunder in my ears, feel the individual fibers of the bandages against my skull.

My knees buckle. Bile floods my mouth, and I barely manage to turn my head before vomiting across the floor. The pain is beyond description—like being turned inside out while lightning courses through my bones.

Then, as suddenly as it began, it stopped.

The silence is deafening.

I'm still on my hands and knees, still shaking, but something has changed. The room is clearer now, edges sharper. I can hear conversations through the concrete walls, detect the subtle electronic hum of surveillance equipment.

And I can think. God, I can think with a clarity that's almost frightening.

Footsteps in the corridor. Moving fast.

Time to go.

Chp.3

The footsteps are getting closer.

I grab the syringe—still well over half-full of that electric blue poison, and press myself against the wall beside the door. My enhanced hearing picks up every detail: the soft squeak of rubber soles on linoleum, the rustle of a lab coat, the slight wheeze in someone's breathing.

The lock clicks. The door swings inward.

Dr. Chen steps through, eyes immediately going to the empty metal slab. In the split second it takes him to process what he's seeing—the undone restraints, the pool of vomit on the floor—I move.

My hand clamps down on his shoulder, spinning him toward me. His eyes widen behind those wire-rimmed glasses, mouth opening to shout, but I'm already driving the needle deep into the side of his neck. The plunger slides home with a soft click.

"What did you—" His words dissolve into a strangled gasp.

Whatever that blue serum does, it works fast. His legs buckle, hands clawing at his throat as convulsions wrack his body. I shove past him, snatching my jacket and shirt from the chair. The fabric feels foreign against my hypersensitive skin, every fiber amplified.

Chen hits the floor hard, retching and twitching. I don't wait to see if he recovers.

The hallway beyond stretches in both directions—sterile white walls broken by identical doors with small observation windows. The air reeks of industrial disinfectant trying to mask something much worse underneath. Blood. Fear. Death.

At the far end, one door stands different from the rest. Tinted glass instead of clear, and behind it, a faint glow that makes my stomach clench with dread.

"A... Alex..."

The voice is barely a whisper, but I'd know it anywhere. Luke.

I run toward the sound, my bare feet silent on the cold linoleum. Through the tinted glass, I can make out shapes—medical equipment, monitoring devices, and in the center, a figure strapped to a table that's been tilted nearly vertical.

The door isn't locked. Why would it be? Who would be stupid enough to break into this place?

The smell hits me first when I step inside—copper and antiseptic and something sweet that makes bile rise in my throat. Then I see him.

What they've done to Luke.

His face is a map of fresh cuts and old bruises, blood crusted in his blond hair. They've stripped him to the waist, and his chest is a canvas of precise incisions—not random violence, but methodical exploration. Clinical. His left hand is bandaged, but I can see where his thumb used to be.

But it's his eyes that break me. Those ice-blue eyes that used to be so steady, so sure—now they're hollow. Defeated.

"I... I'm sorry," he croaks when he sees me.

"For what?" I move to his restraints, fingers working the buckles with desperate efficiency.

"I told them... everything." A tear cuts a clean path through the grime on his cheek. "Your name. Where we've been. The others in your group. I couldn't... I'm sorry."

The betrayal should hurt. Should make me angry. But all I feel is relief that he's alive, and rage at what they've done to him.

"We'll deal with that later," I tell him, my voice steadier than I feel. "Right now, we're getting you out of here."

The last restraint comes free, and Luke's weight sags against me. He's lost too much blood, too much strength. When I try to help him stand, his legs give out immediately.

"I can't..." he gasps.

"Yes, you can." But even as I say it, I know it's not true. I ease him down against the wall, his head lolling back.

The cold kiss of metal against the base of my skull freezes every muscle in my body.

"Step away from him." Dr. Chen's voice, but wrong somehow. Slurred. The serum should have dropped him for hours. If not, kill him.

I turn my head just enough to see him in my peripheral vision. He's upright, but barely. Blood runs from his nose, and his hands shake violently. Whatever that blue stuff does to enhance the human nervous system, it's tearing him apart from the inside.

"You should be unconscious," I say.

His laugh is wet and broken. "Enhanced... metabolism. Part of the... program." He presses the gun harder against my skull. "Now step away, or I put a bullet through your enhanced brain."

"Okay." I raise my hands, moving slowly away from Luke.

"The serum worked faster than we expected," Chen continues, his voice gaining strength as he talks. "Accelerated healing, increased pain tolerance, cognitive enhancement. You're already becoming something more than human."

More than human. The words should terrify me, but instead, I feel a cold clarity settling over my thoughts. Every detail of the room becomes sharp and clear—the distance to the gun, the tremor in Chen's hands, the way Luke's breathing has become shallow and labored.

"I'm going to enjoy dissecting you piece by piece," Chen snarls. "After I kill your friend, of course. Can't have loose ends."

Luke's eyes meet mine. Even broken, even dying, there's still fight in them. Still the man who pulled me from burning wreckage and taught me how to survive.

He moves.

Despite the pain, despite the blood loss, Luke's good hand snaps out and grabs Chen's ankle. The doctor stumbles, cursing, and I feel the gun's pressure leave my skull for just an instant.

It's enough.

I spin and drive my shoulder into Chen's midsection, slamming him back against the medical equipment. Monitors crash to the floor in a shower of sparks. The gun flies from his grip, skittering across the floor toward Luke.

Chen recovers faster than he should, the serum in his system giving him unnatural resilience. His fist catches me across the jaw, and stars explode behind my eyes. But the enhanced metabolism works both ways—I can feel my body processing the pain, compartmentalizing it.

We grapple, crashing into cabinets filled with surgical instruments. Glass shatters. Chen's elbow drives into my ribs, right where the fresh stitches pull against inflamed skin. I cry out, but don't let go.

Luke's fingers close around the pistol.

The gunshot is deafening in the enclosed space. Chen jerks backward, a bloom of red spreading across his white coat. He looks down at the wound in his abdomen with something like surprise.

"Code red," he gasps into a radio clipped to his collar. "The subject has escaped. Lock down all exits."

Then he collapses.

Keys spill from his pocket as he hits the floor. I grab them with shaking hands and turn back to Luke.

He's even paler now, if that's possible. The gun trembles in his grip.

"Go," he whispers.

"Not without you."

"Look at me, Alex." His voice carries the authority it always had, even now. "Really look."

I do. And I see what I've been refusing to acknowledge—the gray pallor of his skin, the way his breathing hitches with every exhale, the spreading darkness beneath the bandages on his chest.

"You can't carry me," he continues. "Not far enough. Not fast enough." He shifts the gun, pressing it against his own chest. "There are others who need you. People like us, still fighting. I'll buy you time."

In the distance, I can hear them coming. Boots on linoleum. Shouts. The mechanical hum of doors sealing.

“You’re strong Alex, I know you will make it”

I *need* to tell him. I need him to *know*. If this is the last time I'll ever see him then-

“Luke I ***Lov..”*** 

The first gunshot cracks from somewhere close by. Too close.

 "Go!" The word comes out like a command, like the soldier he used to be. His eyes are clear now, focused. "Make it count."

I run.

The corridors blur past in a maze of white walls and fluorescent lighting. The keys Chen dropped fit the first exit I found—heavy steel doors that open onto a loading dock. Rain hammers down from a black sky, washing the sterile smell of the facility from my lungs.

A parking area spreads before me, vehicles arranged in neat rows. I hit the unlock button on the key fob, and somewhere to my left, headlights flash.

I sprint toward the sound, rain soaking through my clothes in seconds. Behind me, the facility erupts in noise—alarms, shouting, the crack of gunfire.

Luke, I’m sorry

I slide into the driver's seat of what turns out to be a black SUV, hands shaking as I jam the key into the ignition. The engine roars to life. I throw it into drive and floor the accelerator.

That's when I see it.

A figure stands directly in my path, tall and impossibly thin. Even through the rain-streaked windshield, I can see that its proportions are all wrong—limbs too long, joints bending in directions they shouldn't. Its head jerks and twitches like a marionette with tangled strings.

This isn't one of the infected from the city. This is something else. Something worse.

It glides toward the SUV with fluid, predatory grace.

I slam the gear shift into reverse, tires screaming on wet asphalt. The creature moves faster than anything has a right to, flowing across the pavement like liquid shadow. It leaps, landing on the hood with a wet thud that spider-webs the windshield.

Through the fractured glass, I see its face—or what's left of it. Skin stretched taut over elongated bones, eye sockets black and empty, and a mouth that tears open far wider than human anatomy should allow.

I jam the transmission into drive and hit the gas.

The SUV lurches forward, tires fighting for purchase on the slick pavement. The creature's claws rake across the windshield, but the sudden acceleration sends it tumbling off the hood. In the rearview mirror, I watch it roll and come up in a crouch, already preparing to give chase.

I don't slow down.

The facility's gate looms ahead—chain link topped with razor wire. But the SUV is heavy and moving fast. Metal screams and sparks fly as I punch through, fragments of fence clattering across the roof.

Behind me, muzzle flashes light up the rain. Someone is still shooting, still fighting.

Luke.

Every instinct screams at me to turn around, to go back and help him. But his voice echoes in my head, as clear as if he were sitting beside me: ***Don't waste your life. Make it count.***

The road stretches ahead, black and endless, disappearing into the storm. I grip the steering wheel tighter and press down on the accelerator.

Rain mixes with the tears on my cheeks, and somewhere behind me in the darkness, the gunfire finally stops.

Chap 4.

The windshield wipers beat a steady rhythm against the storm—*thump-scrape, thump-scrape*—and my enhanced brain immediately catalogues the sound: 72 beats per minute. The same rate as Luke's heart when he was calm. When he used to sleep beside me in whatever shelter we'd found, his breathing was deep and even, one hand always resting near his weapon.

I grip the steering wheel tighter, knuckles white against black leather. The enhanced cognition won't let me push the memory away. Instead, it sharpens every detail with surgical precision: the way his chest rose and fell that last morning, the exact angle of sunlight across his face, the small scar above his left eyebrow from when he'd shielded me from flying glass three months ago.

Seventy-two beats per minute. Now zero.

The SUV's engine note changes as I crest a hill, and even that simple sound triggers a cascade of memory. Luke's voice explaining how to listen to engines, how to tell when one was about to fail: "It'll sound different, Alex. Trust your ears—they'll save your life when your eyes can't."

My foot slams on the brake.

The SUV skids sideways on the rain-slick asphalt before coming to rest at an angle across both lanes. I'm gasping, hyperventilating, my enhanced nervous system processing oxygen at an accelerated rate that leaves me dizzy and nauseated.

Through the fractured windshield, I can see an abandoned gas station maybe fifty yards ahead. Dark windows, weeds growing through cracks in the concrete, gas pumps standing like sentinels over a graveyard of the old world.

I need to stop. I need to think. Need to—

*"I told them everything."*

Luke's words echo with perfect clarity, and my enhanced brain immediately begins dissecting them. Vocal stress analysis indicates shame, regret, but underlying determination. Micro-expression review: tightening around his eyes suggested he was lying about something. Heart rate elevated beyond what physical trauma alone would cause.

The realization hits like ice water in my veins.

He was protecting me.

My enhanced cognition starts running calculations, probability matrices based on interrogation psychology and Luke's behavioral patterns. Ninety-three percent chance he fed them false information. Eighty-seven percent chance he deliberately prolonged his own suffering to buy me time. Seventy-four percent chance he never broke at all—just made them think he had.

I slam my fist against the dashboard, and the impact sends lightning up my arm. Even pain feels different now, sharper and more immediate, but also strangely manageable. As if the serum has rewired my relationship with suffering.

The gas station wavers in my vision. I put the SUV in drive and coast toward it, pulling around behind the building where the SUV won't be visible from the road. My hands shake as I turn off the engine.

Silence rushes in to fill the space left by mechanical noise.

I lean my forehead against the steering wheel and close my eyes, but that only makes it worse. With visual input elimiTristond, my enhanced hearing picks up everything: rain drumming against the roof in an irregular pattern that my brain immediately starts trying to decode for meaning, the subtle tick of cooling metal, my own heartbeat thundering at 127 beats per minute.

Nearly twice Luke's resting rate. Twice what his will ever be again.

The sob that tears from my throat doesn't sound human. It's raw, animal, the sound of something breaking beyond repair. But even as grief wracks my body, part of my enhanced mind remains coldly analytical, observing my own breakdown with clinical detachment.

Crying duration: four minutes, thirty-seven seconds. Respiratory rate: elevated. Probable psychological trauma manifesting through enhanced emotional processing. Recommendation: compartmentalize for later analysis.

I want to scream at that calculating voice in my head, but I can't. Because it's me now. This is what the serum has made me—a thing that can perfectly remember every moment of loss while simultaneously treating it like a data point to be filed away.

I remember the needle sliding into Luke's neck. Remember the exact pressure required to depress the plunger. Remember the way his pupils dilated as the blue liquid entered his bloodstream, the specific shade of gray his skin turned as the serum began its work.

But wait.

That's wrong.

I sit up straighter, blinking rain from my eyes. I injected Chen, not Luke. Luke was already dying when I found him, already broken by whatever they'd done during his interrogation. The enhanced memory is perfect, incapable of error, and it shows me the truth with crystalline clarity:

Luke died from his wounds. From torture. From blood loss.

Not from anything I did.

So why does it feel like I killed him?

The answer comes with the cold logic of enhanced cognition: because I chose to leave. I calculated the odds, weighed the variables, and decided his life was an acceptable loss to ensure my own survival. My enhanced brain had processed the tactical situation in milliseconds and reached the optimal conclusion.

Luke would have called it the right choice. He'd trained me to make decisions like that, to put survival above sentiment. But the human part of me—whatever's left of it—knows better.

***I LEFT HIM TO DIE ALONE.***

The rain is letting up, and in the growing quiet, I can hear something else: the distant throb of helicopter rotors. They're looking for me. Of course they are. Whatever that facility was, whoever was running it, they wouldn't just let their enhanced test subject walk away.

I should move. Should find cover, put distance between myself and any pursuit. The logical thing to do.

Instead, I sit in the SUV behind an abandoned gas station and try to remember what it felt like to be human.

Luke's final words echo in my enhanced memory: *"There are others who need you. People like us, still fighting."*

He'd given me a mission. Purpose. Something to do with the poison they'd pumped into my veins, something to justify the thing I'm becoming.

But as I start the engine and pull back onto the empty highway, I can't shake the feeling that the person Luke died protecting is already gone. The enhanced cognition, the accelerated healing, the perfect memory—they're not additions to who I was.

They're replacements.

The helicopter sounds are getting closer. Time to disappear into the wasteland and figure out what I am now. What I'm supposed to do with this curse disguised as a gift.

The road stretches ahead, black and endless, and somewhere out there, people are still fighting. Still hoping. Still believing that humanity is worth saving.

I press down on the accelerator and try to remember why I once believed that too.

Behind me, the gas station fades into the storm, and with it, the last place where the old Alex existed. Whatever drives north into the darkness, it's something else entirely.

Something enhanced.

Something lost.

CHP 5.

The deer doesn't hear me coming.

Two weeks ago, that would have been impossible. I was loud, clumsy—human. Now I move through the forest without disturbing a single leaf, my feet finding purchase on ground that should crunch and snap under my weight. The deer continues grazing, unaware that death stands fifteen feet away.

I've been hunting for three days. Not because I'm hungry—that's another thing that's changed. Food tastes like ash now, and I can go longer without eating than should be possible. I hunt because something inside me craves it. Something that whispers in frequencies I shouldn't be able to hear.

The bow I scavenged from an abandoned sporting goods store feels natural in my hands, like I've used one for years instead of hours. My enhanced—no, that's not the right word anymore—my *changed* vision tracks the deer's pulse point beneath its fur. I can see the blood moving under its skin, can hear its heart beating from here.

Seventy-eight beats per minute.

Faster than Luke's resting rate. Slower than his final moments.

I draw the bowstring back, and that's when I notice my hands.

The fingernails are longer than they were yesterday. Sharper. There are faint marks on my palms—ridges that weren't there before, patterns that look almost like scales. When I flex my fingers, the joints move with too much flexibility, bending at angles that make my stomach turn.

The deer's head snaps up. Its eyes meet mine across the clearing, and what I see there makes me lower the bow.

Terror. Pure, instinctual terror.

It's not looking at me like I'm a human with a weapon. It's looking at me like I'm a predator it's never encountered before, something its species evolved to fear on a genetic level. The deer's pupils dilate, its breath comes in short, panicked bursts, and then it bolts—not just away from me, but away from what I'm becoming.

I watch it disappear into the underbrush, my enhanced hearing tracking its flight long after it vanishes from sight. Part of me wants to follow. The rational, human part.

But there's another part now. A part that whispers about the chase, about running prey to ground, about the warm taste of fresh blood. A part that knows exactly how far the deer will run before exhaustion takes it, knows which path it will choose, knows how to cut it off.

I force myself to turn away.

The abandoned cabin I've been using as shelter sits in a small clearing maybe half a mile back. I found it four days ago—windows boarded up, door hanging off its hinges, clearly empty for years. Perfect for someone who needs to hide from both human hunters and whatever else might be out there.

The walk back should take fifteen minutes. I make it in seven without consciously trying to move faster.

Inside, I've set up a crude living space: sleeping bag in the corner, my remaining supplies stacked against one wall, a small mirror propped against the windowsill. It's the mirror I head for now, dreading what I'll see but unable to stop myself.

The face looking back at me is still recognizably mine, but wrong in subtle ways. My cheekbones are more pronounced, my jaw slightly elongated. My eyes—God, my eyes. The iris has developed flecks of gold that seem to move in the light, and sometimes I swear I can see things in my peripheral vision that aren't there when I turn to look directly.

But it's my mouth that makes me step back from the mirror.

My teeth are changing.

The canines are longer, sharper. When I run my tongue over them, I taste blood where they've cut the inside of my cheek. Behind them, I can feel other teeth shifting, reshaping themselves for purposes I don't want to think about.

I grab the med kit I took from the SUV and pull out a small flashlight, using it to examine my mouth more closely. What I see makes my knees weak.

It's not just the teeth. The roof of my mouth has developed ridges, and my tongue—when did my tongue get so long? When I extend it fully, it reaches past my chin. The surface is rough now, covered in tiny barbs that scrape against my lips.

I drop the flashlight. It hits the floor and rolls under the table, beam spinning wild patterns across the cabin walls.

This isn't enhancement. This is transformation.

My mind races back to the facility, to Dr. Chen's words: "Neural Enhancement Serum." But that was a lie, wasn't it? Or at best, a half-truth. They weren't enhancing my brain—they were activating something that was already inside me.

Something that wasn't human.

I sink onto the sleeping bag, hands shaking as I pull up my shirt to examine the surgical site. The stitches are gone—my body absorbed them days ago—but the scar remains. It's not the clean line of a simple incision anymore. The tissue has formed a complex pattern, almost like...

Like it's covering something underneath.

I press my fingers against the scar tissue, and pain lances through my side. But underneath the pain, I can feel something else. Movement. A rhythmic pulsing that doesn't match my heartbeat.

Oh God.

They put something inside me. During the surgery, while I was unconscious, they implanted something. And the serum didn't enhance me—it woke it up.

I remember the creature outside the facility. The way it moved, fluid and wrong. The way its face was stretched and distorted. The rage in its empty eye sockets when it saw me.

It knew. It recognized what I was becoming.

I scramble for my backpack, pulling out the small notebook I've been keeping. My handwriting from two weeks ago looks foreign now, the letters too rounded, too human. I flip to a blank page and start writing, trying to document the changes:

*Day 14: Fingernails 1.2cm longer than baseline. Joint flexibility increased approximately 40%. Dietary needs are reduced. Sleep requirements decreased to 3-4 hours.*

*Day 14 (cont.): Dental modifications progressing. Canines extended 0.8cm. Additional tooth buds detected behind molars. Tongue length increased significantly.*

*Day 14 (cont.): Surgical site active. Unknown implant responding to serum activation. Purpose unclear.*

I will stop writing. The clinical tone is wrong, too detached. This isn't a medical journal—it's a horror story. My horror story.

*I'm turning into one of them.*

That's the truth I've been avoiding for two weeks. All the enhanced cognition, the perfect memory, the improved reflexes—they're not gifts. They're symptoms. I'm becoming whatever that creature was, and there's no way to stop it.

Luke's voice echoes in my memory: "There are others who need you. People like us, still fighting."

But what if I can't help them? What if I'm becoming the thing they need to fight against?

Outside, something moves through the underbrush. My head snaps toward the sound before I consciously register it. Whatever's out there is big, moving with deliberate purpose rather than the random wandering of infected.

***Humans***.

I can smell them now—sweat, fear, the metallic tang of weapons. Three of them, maybe four, approaching from the east. Their heart beats thunder in my ears like war drums.

Part of me wants to run. To grab my gear and disappear deeper into the forest before they can find me.

But another part—the part with too-long teeth and skin that's starting to feel too tight—wants to see what they taste like.

I clamp my hands over my mouth, horrified by my own thoughts. The human part of me is screaming, but it's getting quieter every day. Soon, it might not be strong enough to hold the other part back.

The footsteps are getting closer. I need to decide: hide from them, or let them find me and hope there's enough of Alex left to warn them about what I'm becoming.

Through the boarded windows, I can see flashlight beams cutting through the growing darkness.

Time to find out which part of me is stronger.

The human part, or the monster
