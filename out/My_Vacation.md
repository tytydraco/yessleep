I recently got back from vacation, and I found something that has puzzled me to no end: a journal, written in my handwriting, containing a detailed account of things that I do not remember experiencing. If not for the journal having been written by what looks to be my hand, I would have dismissed the thing as nothing more than some strange souvenir that ended up in my bag by happenstance. The ravings of a lunatic, accidentally dropped in my bag during some sort of airport shuffle. But, as I said, the handwriting tells me that I wrote these words. Another puzzling thing is that before I found the journal, if you had asked me, I would have told you that I had a great time away from the hustle and bustle. I'm not sure I would have been able to give you details, though, because I have spent more than a handful of nights at this point trying to stretch my mind in order to remember just *one* detail of my vacation.



I am still sorting through most of the writing, trying to stitch together some recollection of what may have happened, but I feel like I need fresh eyes on what I'm reading. I don't want to share more than the first ten pages, mostly out of fear that I may give up my personal identity. If someone I know or love were to read what I've written down and trace it back to me, well, I'm not sure how they would react.



Just know that when I close my eyes at night, I feel myself falling.



The Journal



“Am I dead?”



“Excuse me?”



My brain feels like it's hovering somewhere behind and above me. Is it? I feel like I can almost see the back of my head. I see someone next to me. Are they dead?



“Are we dead?”



I look to my right and see a wild-eyed expression on a weathered face on a weathered face. This person is scared. Why are they scared?



“Are we dead,” I ask again.



They flash a quick smile and turn away from me to look out the window. My gaze follows theirs. I see clouds. Are we flying?



“Are we flying,” I ask them.



They nod their head, laugh to themselves, and say, “Did you take a Xanax? They used to make me feel pretty weird, too. Do you need some water? Let me see if I can get a flight attendant.”



Flight. The word grounds me. I can almost hear the sound of my brain being sucked back into my skull.



*sssssphumbt*



Here I am. I'm on a flight. I was just visiting some relatives. An aunt? No. An uncle? I don't know. Was it a friend? Someone. I remember they invited me out to get my mind off things. Things? I don't remember what things, so whatever we did must have worked.



*ksszzzzzzzzt*



A shock of pain starting at the base of my skull, scraping and scratching its way toward my eyes. I fight back the competing urges to scream and vomit.



*ksszzzzzzzzt*



The sharp split in my head is mostly gone, but a new feeling is taking its place. This is not my first time on this plane. This is not my first time on this flight. How does that make sense? That can't be true. Did I take a Xanax like this presumptuous stranger suggested? I don't remember taking any. Would I remember if I did? My head feels like simulated death. Am I hungover? Why can't I remember anything?



*ksszzzzzzzzt*



I feel the static being dragged across my spine now.



No pain this time. Just memories. Are they memories? Maybe visions, hallucinations. A clear vision of a small man in the front of the plane. He's nervous. He stands up and screams. He's holding something made of plastic. It looks cheaply made, like if Ikea made a toy gun. Simple, small, white, not meant to last more than a single use. The screaming is becoming more clear. What is he saying?



A flight attendant is approaching from behind, and at first, he doesn't notice her. She has duct tape. She appears to be close to hyperventilating. As she gets closer to him, she trips and hits her head on the aisle armrest just behind the screaming man. Is she unconscious? I think I see blood on her forehead. At the sound of her head meeting thin carpet, the screaming man looks down at her, yells, and runs to the front of the plane. He scrapes through cabinets of food and pillows. His back is turned. A larger man from the front of the plane takes this opportunity to intervene.



From the first moment, though, his approach is clumsy and loud. The screaming man is ready for him and looks prepared to use his violent toy, but the larger man anticipates this and hits the floor just before the gun fires. The bullet hits a passenger in the fifth row. Blood hits the ceiling as the passenger rolls over themselves in their seat. The screaming man is screaming again, but it's because the larger man has tripped him by the ankles and pulled him into an untrained choke-hold. It seems that the screaming man has forgotten that his gun only has one shot as he points the shards of plastic in his hand up at the larger man's head and repeatedly pulls the limp trigger.



It looks like the larger man has gained control of the situation. The screaming man is no longer screaming and might not be breathing. His face is past purple. Tears and snot streaming down his face, blood on his hands, the larger man pulls himself to his feet. He slowly returns to his aisle seat and slumps down into it.



I can feel the collective exhale from the cabin as those of us bystanders remember that we need to breathe. A few people are weeping. Some are staring at the flight attendant. The blood from her temple is soaking into the carpet below her cheek. It looks like she's losing a lot of blood. Is she breathing? Why is nobody checking on her? Should I check on her? I wouldn't know what to do even if I did check. I should take a first-aid course. Why haven't I done that?



The flight attendant coughs. Another collective exhale. She's alive. That's good. Another cough. That one didn't sound good. Is her leg shaking? Are both legs shaking? Yes, and her arms. She's convulsing. Someone nearby has run to her side. Where has this guy been the whole time? He is yelling for a doctor.



“Is there a doctor on board?”



From stunned silence to rabid fervor, everyone on board begins turning to every other person on board and asking “IS ANYONE HERE A DOCTOR?” No luck so far.



A loud bang. Was that the gun again? It came from the front of the plane. It's the screaming man. He's using something to try to pry open the door to the cockpit. What is that? I can't tell from where I'm looking. The larger man seems to have noticed and is taking action. He's running into the galley area.



*fumpth*



The sound of sharp steel meeting soft bone. The larger man's body drops under him, and he hits the ground hard. His forehead has caved into itself. More blood.



A light flashes outside. Is it storming? I hear a loud bang from the cockpit and feel a shift in my center of gravity.



Something has hit me in the face. A small, yellow mask with a clear bag attached to it is hanging in front of me. Oxygen mask?



The mask isn't there for long. It's starting to float back up to the compartment it was dropped from. I have a moment to consider how that's happening before I feel my stomach hit my feet. The cabin fills with violent noise. Many people are screaming now. I turn to my right and see that the person next to me has lost consciousness. Their arms float in front of their face, and their soda water collects in the air. I feel my arms floating. I feel the blood draining from my face and hands. A warm sensation from below the waist. I'm peeing. I can't help it.



I have to get the oxygen mask. It's just out of reach. I won't let myself die here. I unbuckle my seat belt while maintaining my grip on the armrest. I move to grab the mask just as I feel the nose of the plane dive. A matter of milliseconds, but too late all the same. I'm floating. My seat is getting further away.



I'm trying to use my hands to grab my seat and pull myself back down, but it feels useless. My hands are almost completely numb. They're basically rubber. I think I remember reading about this. I'm experiencing some type of depressurization sickness. Was there a fix for it? Not that I'd have the ability to do it at this point, seeing as I'm floating above other passengers. Just a curious thought. I think I'm peeing again. I wonder how long it will be before we hit the ground.



I am slammed into the back wall of the cabin. Before I pass out, I observe through the pain that my shoulder blades are touching my heels.



*ksszzzzzzzzt*



I'm back in my seat. What was that? A dream? I feel wet. Did I actually pee? No, I think I'm sweating. My mind and body feel stretched thin, like a rubber band with an abusive owner.



Someone is talking to me. I look up to see a thin smile and tired eyes. It's the flight attendant, the dead one. I can't rationalize any of this. I don't think that was a dream. The pain was not a dream. My nerve endings are still firing off. I felt bone crunch into bone.



The flight attendant is looking at me. I think she may have asked me a question.



“Wuh?” is what I can manage.



Her body language reads as annoyed. She asks, presumably for the second or third time, “Sir, do you feel that you need medical attention?”



“Why?”



“Your friend sitting next to you asked me over to check on you. They believe you may have taken something? Do you remember what you took?”



“Who are you?”



“I'm your flight attendant. I have my first aid and CPR certifications, but you'd be surprised at how many passengers end up being medical professionals. It feels like every time I've run into an emergency in the air, the universe has put the right people there at the right time. I'm sure there's a doctor on board, God willing.”



Something she says clicks me back into place, and I remember the screaming man.



“There's a passenger in the front of the plane with a gun,” I hear myself say.



“Excuse me?” The flight attendant raises her eyebrows at me.



“There's a passenger in the front of the plane with a gun. I'm not sure what seat he's in, but it's the left side of the plane and somewhere around the fourth or fifth row. He's going to try to crash the plane.”



The flight attendant says, “Sir, I'm going to get you some water. Try to relax. I like to focus on my breathing when I'm nervous. I'll be right back.”



“No” comes out of my mouth much louder than I want it to, but I don't want to feel myself fold in half again.



The flight attendant's eyes are wide open as she turns back, her eyebrows almost touching her scalp. I'm freaking her out. I put my hands up.



“I'm sorry. I can see that you're scared. I don't want to scare anyone. I had a vision. I know that sounds beyond nuts, but I'm telling you that there is a man on this plane that wants to hurt people.”



“Sir, I'm going to need you sit down.”



I'm standing? I look down to see my feet below me. I am standing. I don't remember standing. I feel like I'm vibrating. I touch my hands to my face and try to regain some sense of what I'm doing. My hands come back soaked with tears and snot. I'm crying? I suddenly feel that I can't breathe anymore. I'm pulling air into my lungs and forcing it out. It's not helping. It feels like I'm drowning. Why does it feel like I'm drowning? Am I drowning? It seems unlikely, but the feeling is overwhelming. I'm going to drown. I'm going to drown if I don't do something. I'm going to drown, or feel my body fold in half, or get shot if I don't do something.



Do something.



“There is a man on this plane with a gun,” I hear myself yell.



That was the wrong thing, but it's already left my mouth.



Right on cue, a frenzied voice comes from the front of the plane:



“All who rage against you will surely be ashamed and disgraced!”



A man, the screaming man, is standing up in his seat. I can see from here that his eyes are almost as red as his hat. He's been crying.



“Those who oppose you will be as nothing and perish,” bellows the screaming man as he aims his plastic pistol and unloads it in my direction. A loud pop follows a dull thud. Screams come shortly after. Have I been shot? I don't feel anything. I look up to to see misted blood on the ceiling in front of me. It looks like someone a few rows ahead took the bullet.



“Someone stop him from crashing the plane! The gun only has one bullet!”



Eyes are on me. People are looking at me, but no one is doing anything. The screaming man is scrambling toward the cockpit. What is he yelling about? I need to get to him before he hijacks the plane. I don't think there's much time.



“I will make you into a threshing sledge, new and sharp, with many teeth,” I hear him say to himself as I tiptoe toward him. He's pulling on something in the refreshment area of the galley, just outside of the cockpit. It looks like he's trying to rip one of the metal cabinet doors off of its hinges.



Before I know it, I'm right behind him. Shit, I don't have a plan. Should I just try to grab him? Maybe choke him like that big guy did? I don't know how to do anything like that. I should have had a plan. I guess I didn't have much time to think of one.



He turns slightly and sees me. Before I know it, he's on his feet and swinging the cabinet door down on me like a makeshift machete.



*fumpth*



My head caves in quickly. A moment of immense pain. Just one moment, but once again, I feel every bit of it. Metal through flesh through bone through membrane through brain matter. And then, the lights go out. I am in the arms of darkness.



No me.



No time.



Nothing.



“Am I dead?”



“Excuse me?”



My brain feels like it's hovering somewhere behind and above me. Is it? I feel like I can almost see the back of my head. I see someone next to me. Are they dead?



“Are we dead?”



I look to my right and see a wild-eyed expression on a weathered face. This person is scared. Why are they scared?



“Are we dead,” I ask again.



*ksszzzzzzzzt*



My eyes roll into the back of my head. I can't stop them, just as I can't help but surrender to the profound agony scraping its way through my skull. What is happening to me? Am I having a seizure?



Visions fill my mind. In these visions, I see myself witnessing the visions from before. I see myself die a couple of times, I feel the pain. It's impossible to bare.



*ksszzzzzzzzt*



I suck in air as my perception pops back to the front of my skull. The familiar stranger sitting next to me is looking as nervous as ever.



“Are you okay?” I hear them ask. I feel compelled to answer, but I don't really know how. Am I okay? Right now, maybe, but in a few minutes, I feel like that answer is going to change. That brings me back to the problem at hand: how do I stop this from happening? Obviously, what I tried in my last “life” did not work. Yelling the truth at people seemingly changed nothing other than stirring up more panic.



“Are you okay?”



My scared friend. They're still asking.



“I'm just a nervous flier. Scared of heights, you know?”



They nod their head, laugh to themselves, and then say, “Did you take a Xanax? They used to make me feel pretty weird, too. Do you need some water? Let me see if I can get a flight attendant.”



I'm not sure how, but I laugh and shake my head. I tell my neighbor, “No, I'm okay. I think I just need to rest my eyes.”



Maybe there is some prosaic explanation for what's going on. Maybe I'm encountering a rare type of altitude sickness, and the weird visions I'm having are a byproduct of that. Maybe I did take a Xanax. Did I? What was I doing before the flight? I don't remember. Why don't I remember? What is the last thing I remember?



My past feels hazy. Trying to remember anything about who I am or what I'm doing feels like trying to look through a window smeared with Vaseline. I can make out distorted shapes but no details. What's my name? I don't remember my name. Do I have a wallet?



Just as I begin to reach into my pocket, I hear him. The screaming man.



“The angels will come and separate the wicked from the righteous and throw them into the blazing furnace, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth,” screamed the man. He is standing with his gun in his right hand. “I have come to throw you into the furnace.”



“What is he saying?” the person next to me asks, but before I can answer, we both watch as the screaming man turns to a woman crying close by and shoots her in the head. Blood splatters the screaming man's face. His eyes are wide open.



The screaming man sprints toward the galley, probably onto the next part of his sadistic plan. I can hear him grunting and ripping the cabinet door off the wall. The flight attendant that tried to stop him before is running toward the cockpit with duct tape. Trembling and wet with tears, she accidentally lets the roll slip from her fingers just a few feet behind the screaming man. I see him turn slightly, stand, and put all of his strength into slicing the cabinet door down into the flight attendant's head. Her knees knock into themselves as her legs give out.



Judging from the sound, the screaming man is currently trying to break into the cockpit. It won't be long now. Should I try intervening again? Should I have done so earlier? Is there a point in it? Can I change what's happening? I tried once before, and I ended up like the flight attendant. The thought of my head getting sliced open sends a tin foil feeling up my spine. My stomach hurts.



A light flashes outside. Is it storming? I hear a loud bang from the cockpit and feel a shift in my center of gravity.



The oxygen mask hits me in the face, and I reach out to grab it. My hands are slick with sweat, and I can't get a good grip. It slips from my hands and starts to ascend back toward its compartment. Once again, gravity drops beneath me. Bile is rising in my throat. I turn to my neighbor and see their unconscious body hovering a few inches above their seat. The lap belt is keeping them attached to their chair. Not sure how much that will matter here shortly. I can't feel my feet or hands, and my head is spinning. Windows, seats, people, and clouds are rotating through my vision, blending into a kaleidoscopic nightmare.



Suddenly, something in my head stabilizes. I see dark sky. There's something in the darkness. A black shadow.



*Solve our puzzle?*



I feel the jolt of something rupturing inside of my skull. A small but profound 'pop.' My body is writhing against the safety belt. My mouth and sinuses are filling with something warm. Tastes like pennies. I'm drowning. I'm choking on my blood. Everything is red.



“Am I dead?”



“Excuse me?”



My brain feels like it's hovering somewhere behind and above me. Is it? I feel like I can almost see the back of my head. I see someone next to me. Are they dead?



“Are we dead?”



I look to my right and see a wild-eyed expression on a weathered face. This person is scared. Why are they scared?



And why do they look familiar?



*ksszzzzzzzzt*



Memories. Pain. Darkness.



Darkness. The shadowy object that I saw in the clouds. Did I actually see that? My head was spinning out of control, and the plane was basically vertical at that point, so I'm not sure that my perspective was very clear. I could have been experiencing the bends. Is that something that happens to your brain, or is that something that happens to your bones? I can't remember. Hypoxia? I think I remember reading about that in a magazine.



What else do I remember? What was I doing before that nutcase started shouting about teeth? My wallet. I was going to look for my wallet.



*ksszzzzzzzzt*



Coming back feels less jarring this time. I didn't feel the whiplash I seem to have felt before when my visions have ended.



“Are you okay?” asks my friend to my right.



“I'm okay. Just having a moment, sorry.”



They nod their head, laugh to themselves, and then say, “Did you take a Xanax? They used to make me feel pretty weird, too. Do you need some water? Let me see if I can get a flight attendant.”



I shake my head and say, “No, thanks. I'm good.” I don't have any time for this. I need to start putting some pieces together if I'm going to have a chance of figuring any of this out. My name seems like an easy place to start.



I reach into my pocket and feel the worn leather between my finger tips. It's thin. I can already feel that there might not be anything in it. I pull my hand out to see a black rectangular card holder. It's seen quite a bit of use, but now it holds nothing, so it feels loose in my hand. I check the different folds of the wallet to see if I can find anything.



A scrap of paper is shoved into one of the pockets. I rip it out and unfold it. Words written in clumsy cursive.



There Are No Answers



“We're all going to die,” says the person to my right.



They're staring at me. There's something strange about their body language.



“I mean, eventually,” they continue. “I don't like to think about it, but I can't help it when I'm in the air these days. People are too crazy.”



“Are *you* okay?” I ask. They laugh and nod their head.



“I actually took a zanny right before we took off. That's why I asked earlier. What's that paper about? 'No answers?' Cheat sheet for a test with no questions? Sign me up for that class.”



They laugh to themselves again. I catch myself smiling. It strikes me that I can't remember the last time I smiled.



I hear a gasp from the front of the plane, and then I hear an angry voice. The screaming man.



“All who rage against you will surely be ashamed and disgraced. Those who oppose you will be as nothing and perish!”



He's standing in the aisle, thrusting the gun toward the faces of those closest to him. Each one recoils into themselves. It's a fruitless gesture, just a fight-or-flight response, but I feel for them. Knowing that death is standing directly in front of you, what else can you do?



There Are No Answers



So much for the wallet. I feel like I got hit by a truck. Or like I keep getting hit by a truck over and over again, and I'm watching as the driver turns around for the fourth time.



“The angels will come and separate the wicked from the righteous and throw them into the blazing furnace, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. I have come to throw you into the furnace!” At his word, the screaming man wraps his free arm around the throat of a college kid just unlucky enough to be sitting in grabbing distance. Poor kid.



Should I try to stop this guy again? I feel hollow, gray. Part of me wants to help, but I feel that creeping sensation of splintering bone and severed brain matter. And what happens after? I get in the way, maybe save the kid, maybe somehow survive; does that mean that everything just goes back as it was? We land on the other end, mostly unharmed, and I live with whatever happened to me? I try not to feel haunted by this?



If I don't have to go through any physical trauma again, it's worth trying.



“Take me,” I say as I stand into the aisle to face the screaming man. “You're trying to punish sinners or something? I'm probably more of what you're looking for than that kid.”



Once again, I find myself approaching this psychopath without a plan. Even worse, he's facing me this time. His red eyes narrow, and he presses the gun into the temple of the trembling, freckle-faced 20 year-old.



“You don't know what you're getting into, boy. Do *not* interfere. I am filled with the fire!” It looks like the kid can't breathe. “And the fury!” The screaming man's arm is shaking. He's trying to choke the kid. “And there is nothing on this earthly plane that will stray me off of my course.”



“What course is that? What are you trying to do?” I ask, hoping to learn anything of value.



The screaming man looks me in the eyes.



“I was a young fellow once, like this one here. I had dreams. Selfish pursuits. Secular. All bullshit, excuse the language. This world is fed to us, force fed to us, as something worth participating in. Find yourself a place in it, and you'll be fine. Bullshit, sorry, but it is. This world is poison, that much is obvious. You've got the people at the top, eating cake, and the people at the bottom, eating shit. I got tired of eating shit, and then it hit me. The world is supposed to be this way! We're not supposed to want to be here. This whole world, the violence, the famine, the abuse, the suffering, the adultery, the homosexuality, the selfishness, the blasphemy, the immigrants, it's all just a big ass neon sign blasting us in the face, saying, 'This ain't right.' There's nothing for us in a world propagated by sin! Nothing lasting, nothing eternal. That peace, that salvation lies elsewhere. It lies beyond. It lies with God.”



He has an empty smile on his face. His eyes are elsewhere, looking at something only he seems to be able to see.



“So, myself, and others like me, have decided to fix things. We're going to send a message that this world needs a shift in direction. Some of us are going to go meet God in the process, like me. That's okay. Other folks will stay behind to reinforce the message. Whatever it takes.”



*Solve our puzzle?*
