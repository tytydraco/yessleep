I used to oversee the factories where we make the paddies for McDonald’s burgers in Missouri, factories here specifically have unique state laws that allow for loopholes that aren’t in other states, so burgers made in Missouri STAY in Missouri.

The loophole allows up to 2% of ground meat in a burger to be not the same meat as that burger, so a beef burger can have 1% pork and 1% chicken in it as long as it’s 98% beef. 

Well, you know how companies are, they want things CHEAP and I mean as cheap as possible. So we’d get shipments and shipments of meat from this one company that was so cheap they were losing money from the shipping costs they were agreeing to pay. It was really weird because they were so desperate to sell to us too and the meat was quality, so fresh it looked like it had just been cut but it definitely wasn’t beef… we don’t know what it was, but one of my friends smuggled some home one day out of curiosity. He tried it and said it smelled like pork when he cooked it, but the next week at work he was acting weird, talking about how he was so hungry no matter how much he ate. 

And then he starved to death on a full stomach. They even took him to the hospital and put him in a feeding tube: no matter how much he ate no matter how much sugar they pumped into his veins he would not gain any weight, the hunger would just not go away…  

 I visited the hospital my co worker was at a for few days before he died and asked a lot of the staff about his condition, half out of curiosity half out of concern for my friend. 

 the expressions on the faces of the staff clearly told me that something else was going on and they couldn’t explain it, so they just didn’t. 

I tried talking to my “boss”about this and he just stared at me, and told me that I was making things up. then went in this weird cooperate sounding tyrade about company loyalty, and serving the greater good… dude were making burgers for MCDONALDS. 

I didn’t out rank him but I was in a position where he couldn’t fire me or get me fired. Plus he already had sexual harassment strikes on his record so he had to be on good behavior

I was pissed off. I’m not paid enough to deal with whatever the shit this was. I was going to satisfy my curiosity then leave this fucking place. I started aggressively poking around asking everyone I could, I even went on the pickup run with the delivery driver, which was weird af: the driver told me before hand but I just had to see it for myself) we drove into a parking lot with enormous solar panels shading it out in the middle of nowhere. The meat was just already there in refrigerated crates. Just there waiting for us. 

I asked the driver if he ever came early and saw the drop off, he said yes he did and it was just there anyway. So he came earlier, same thing, just really weird behavior like that. 

At this point jack, the asshole manager started noticing my poking around and he was not happy about it at all. He confronted me, moved his face an inch from mine and started chewing me out in his best drill Sargent impression. 

I couldn’t even hear what he was saying I was so tired of his self entitled bullshit, so I just walked away and he grabbed my shirt and started yanking me towards him. So I started walking backwards fast into him and upon walking backwards into him I rammed my head backward into his face and braced my legs knocking him off balance into the floor. I bet the guys in security were laughing their asses. There’s 3 cameras in this area. I looked down at the asshole and yelled 

“What’s in the meat jack?”
He said angrily 
what are you insinuating 
So I said again but more calmly, 
Jack, what is in the meat. 

Then again 
Enunciating each syllable except with a lot of anger. 
Jack. What the fuck is in the meat”

You don’t have a right to know that’s company property. 


I was fired after that interaction with my boss but I received a very aggressive phone call from an untraceable number threatening my safety if I told anyone. I told them to fuck off and I was assaulted first. The man on the other end sounded just sounded hateful, it shocked me the second I heard his voice just the level of impact it had on me. I could feel that this man clearly wished me harm

He said “I don’t care about jack just don’t talk about the fucking meat to anyone” 

The fact that I was letting a McDonald’s employee intimidate me into anything just dawned on me and I fell into a fit of rage. 

“Oh yea, bitch you wanna intimidate me?? I’m gonna tell everyone about your little scams selling expired meat. Fuck you for thinking you could intimidate me. how dare you “I screamed into the phone smashing the phone down. I felt like a toddler. I just hated that job, hated the smell of that god damn factory, hated the way there was no heat ceiling on how hot they were allowed to let the place get either. People were getting heat strokes left and right 

Plus this is America and I live with my grandmother who enjoys her second amendment rights a little too much imo. She’s a Vietnam vet. These bozos aren’t gonna try anything even if she wasn’t a vet they wouldn’t. It’s McDonald’s!
