I used to oversee the factories where we make the paddies for McDonald’s burgers in Missouri, factories here specifically have unique state laws that allow for loopholes that aren’t in other states, so burgers made in Missouri STAY in Missouri.

The loophole allows up to 2% of ground meat in a burger to be not the same meat as that burger, so a beef burger can have 1% pork and 1% chicken in it as long as it’s 98% beef. 

Well, you know how companies are, they want things CHEAP and I mean as cheap as possible. So we’d get shipments and shipments of meat from this one company that was so cheap they were losing money from the shipping costs they were agreeing to pay. It was really weird because they were so desperate to sell to us too and the meat was quality, so fresh it looked like it had just been cut but it definitely wasn’t beef… we don’t know what it was, but one of my friends smuggled some home one day out of curiosity. He tried it and said it smelled like pork when he cooked it, but the next week at work he was acting weird, talking about how he was so hungry no matter how much he ate. 

And then he starved to death on a full stomach. They even took him to the hospital and put him in a feeding tube: no matter how much he ate no matter how much sugar they pumped into his veins he would not gain any weight, the hunger would just not go away…  

 I visited the hospital my co worker was at a for few days before he died and asked a lot of the staff about his condition, half out of curiosity half out of concern for my friend. Half out of horror that he’d died so quickly and of something so horribly painful. 

 the expressions on the faces of the staff clearly told me that something else was going on and they couldn’t explain it, so they just didn’t. 

I tried talking to my “boss”about this and he just stared at me, and told me that I was making things up. then went in this weird cooperate sounding tyrade about company loyalty, and serving the greater good… dude were making burgers for MCDONALDS. 

I didn’t out rank him but I was in a position where he couldn’t fire me or get me fired. Plus he already had sexual harassment strikes on his record so he had to be on good behavior

I was pissed off. I’m not paid enough to deal with whatever the shit this was. I was going to satisfy my curiosity then leave this fucking place. I started aggressively poking around asking everyone I could, I even went on the pickup run with the delivery driver, which was weird af: the driver told me before hand but I just had to see it for myself) we drove into a parking lot with enormous solar panels shading it out in the middle of nowhere. The meat was just already there in refrigerated crates. Just there waiting for us. 

I asked the driver if he ever came early and saw the drop off, he said yes he did and it was just there anyway. So he came earlier, same thing, just really weird behavior like that. 

At this point jack, the asshole manager started noticing my poking around and he was not happy about it at all. He confronted me, moved his face an inch from mine and started chewing me out in his best drill Sargent impression. 

I couldn’t even hear what he was saying I was so tired of his self entitled bullshit, so I just walked away and he grabbed my shirt and started yanking me towards him. So I started walking backwards fast into him and upon walking backwards into him I rammed my head backward into his face and braced my legs knocking him off balance into the floor. I bet the guys in security were laughing their asses. There’s 3 cameras in this area. I looked down at the asshole and yelled 

“What’s in the meat jack?”
He said angrily 
what are you insinuating 
So I said again but more calmly, 
Jack, what is in the meat. 

Then again 
Enunciating each syllable except with a lot of anger. 
Jack. What the fuck is in the meat”

You don’t have a right to know that’s company property. 

I was fired after that interaction with my boss but I received a very aggressive phone call from an untraceable number threatening my safety if I told anyone. I told them to fuck off and I was assaulted first. The man on the other end sounded just sounded hateful, it shocked me the second I heard his voice just the level of impact it had on me. I could feel that this man clearly wished me harm

He said “I don’t care about jack just don’t talk about the fucking meat to anyone” 

The fact that I was letting a McDonald’s employee intimidate me into anything just dawned on me and I became completely incensed 

“Oh yea, bitch you wanna intimidate me?? I’m gonna tell everyone about your little scams selling expired meat. Fuck you for thinking you could intimidate me. how dare you “I screamed into the phone smashing the phone down. I felt like a toddler. I just hated that job, hated the smell of that god damn factory, hated the way there was no heat ceiling on how hot they were allowed to let the place get either. People were getting heat strokes left and right 

I was not in the right mind set those days, I was very green to how truly harsh the world could get, and frankly I was really stupid. 

I thought that no matter what i was doing I’d be safe because I could arm myself with whatever the hell I wanted. I grew up in a very intensely military family, all the women served, most of the men served, my grandma especially served and if she still could she would.

I tried to serve but they didn’t let me in because I had a “lack of sense of self preservation”… I think that’s how they phrased it… 

So I just lived with granny and we always had a lot of guns… for better or worse… before I was rejected I had practiced a lot for combat that I never ended up going into. 
I had trained my whole life and there’s nothing I could do with it. So I decided to work good ol slave wages for the local McDonald’s factory. That was by far the worst and possibly most dangerous and painful experience I’ve ever had in my life and I’ve been in the hospital with kidney stones shaped like chunks of granola. 

Years of solid training, but lack of experience bread this irresponsible sense of invincibility. And with that came a very misguided sense of responsibility. 

like a kid who’s read iron man too many times and starts to try to make an iron man suit from the tin foil in her parents pantry I plotted. I would find out who is beneath this. I would send evidence to the police. I would be the hero of this town. And I would go at it alone like a total idiot. 

around all of this was this childish glow of childish innocence and a fascination with weapons completely ignoring any sense of responsibility that should be attached to them. 

So as I was about to lay siege to a fucking McDonald’s factory, I had a bit of a set back. Reality set in. I decided to go down the legal route and investigate my friend’s death 

Except unfortunately McDonald’s already had already caught wind of what was going on and had sent an enforcer… 

They sent a guy in clown makeup who knew exactly where each camera was and walked on the blind spots was at my house. I don’t know how he got in but he was there faster than I could process. I felt his hand grasp the side of my hand, he then smashed it into a wall dazing me, and pulled me closer so my ear was pressing into his stomach, my mouth upwards. 

With his other hand he was holding something. Oh god. Oh no it was a burger… 

He moved, like how you’d imagine an angry chimpanzee moves.

I tried to scream and I did, I opened my mouth, but that was what he wanted, the second my mouth was open he violently rammed his menacing burger wielding hand down my throat, then turned his arm so that his elbow was pointing to the ceiling, this had the effect of wrenching my head to the ceiling too, then thrust his hand further down my esophagus far past my throw up reflex. I couldn’t throw up that burger if I wanted to. 

The contents of my stomach flew up into his hand again and again building up in my throat burning it again and again, the pressure expanded it and I felt like it was going to explode. He then pulled his hand out which was immediately followed by the inevitable explosion of vomit from my throat. 

The clown then whispered “don’t fuck with The McDonald mother fucker” in my ear and vanished off into the night completely silently of course. 

I couldn’t stop throwing up for 5 minutes straight. And then I desperately went through the pieces of the throw up looking for pieces of burger, but I couldn’t find any. I think it made way into my system… 

I think granny came down with the shotgun and found me but all I remember was searing pain from the acid being forced into my throat for that long. The pain burned and radiated outwards consuming my entire chest. Imagine heart burn except your chest has actually been set on fire from within.  it was so fucking bad and I felt the urge to cough but every time I did it put me in an even worse hell. 

I was convinced I was going to die. I think the technique the clown used stoped me from aspirating vomit but I’m unsure. 

Then all the sudden I could hear the taste of the throw up the world just started spinning, like that feeling when you get caught in a wave and you just start spinning, all the sudden you don’t know what’s up and what’s down. I started seeing clowns in my head, clowns everywhere. An entire world made of clowns. Trees made of clowns being gently nurtured by the disturbingly joyful smiling glowing clown face that took place of the clown sky. 

 I would be in the hospital for the next two weeks, the nurses told me. I couldn’t stop screaming and babbling incoherently for the first 3 days then the next 4 were pretty smooth sailing actually. 

I remember bits and pieces of the assault, unfortunately the strongest memory is still of the clown shoving his hand down my throat. 

Police believed me, there was clear evidence of a break in, the part that confused and terrified all of us was just how high tech the gear was they used to get in. All 4 door pad locks had been silently cut with a laser. 

I asked the doctors who saw me in the hospital after the break in whether or not they found a burger in my system when they performed stomach surgery to fix the damage the clowns arm had done. He said they found no such thing, but they did find pieces of bread, I must have just imagined there was meat in between the buns. 

One of the drugs they found in my system was an experimental hallucinogenic known as klownamine… it’s intended purpose was to produce vivid hallucinations of clowns. Funding for the drug was stopped almost as soon as it was started nobody knows how enough was produced to be in this person‘s body since producing the drug was extremely expensive. I get the feeling that whoever was after me was trying to flex on me by using such an expensive drug.

It felt like getting teabag in the video game after getting utterly destroyed, but it was real life. He’s assholes had enough money to not care around when they’re clowning around with my life.

but they found a lot, one of the cops was quoted as saying was “enough to get a party of elephants high”. There was another drug too which they said they nearly missed. it had been sent through several labs in hopes that someone could identify it. But they said there were still consistent amounts of it being found in my blood? It wasn’t going away. 

The other odd thing is that now all of my labs show up with elevated white blood cell counts. I’m afraid, what else was in that whatever the clown gave me? I keep asking them to run more tests but the doctors seem to be getting frustrated with me because otherwise I’m fine. And the elevation in white blood cell count is almost unnoticeably over normal levels and that it’s probably just my baseline. I know it’s not. Neither is the 99.1 fever I’ve been having or the random scabs that have been appearing all over my skin. Or the fact that blood comes out of my pores in my sleep. It’s only a little bit, just enough to stain my clothes once in a while. Never enough to cause suspicion.  Am I paranoid? Is something happening to me? Am I dying?

If I’m dying I think I’m going to go out fighting just like grand dad did…
