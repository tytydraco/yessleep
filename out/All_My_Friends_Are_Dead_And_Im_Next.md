I am going to die

When it hits midnight, something from the pits of hell is going to come and devour me.

I’m not writing this as a final message or as some kind of summary of my life. I’m writing this as a warning. Whatever you do, do NOT perform any kind of ritual you see online.

Just over a month ago, my friends and I went camping. It was nighttime, and all five of us were sitting around the campfire. We had gotten bored, and it was still early in the night. Sam mentioned something about doing this ritual he found online. He was obsessed with urban legends and the things that went bump in the night.

Originally, I was hesitant. Growing up, my family was Catholic, and they warned me about messing with the occult and demons—that while these pagan rituals might not actually do anything, the act of inviting something from the other side was dangerous.

Isaiah insisted that it was just a story Sam had found online, while Nate joked about me being a wimp, so I caved. We each performed the ritual, one after another. Sam went first to show us how it was done. Next was Nate, then Isaiah, then James, and finally me.

I will not tell you the name of this ritual, nor any of the steps that we performed. I will not have the blood of anyone on my hands, even after my death.

The ritual was supposed to summon a spirit from the dead that would have knowledge from the afterlife. Isaiah was the most skeptical, mentioning something about bias and how the brain interprets information to justify preconceived notions. James said that most supernatural stories are invented to cover up government plots. Sam insisted that the ritual would work, and Nate bet him $10 it wouldn’t.

Once we all performed the ritual, we waited. The wind howled through the trees, and the fire crackled as we all looked around expectantly. Suddenly, a surge of icy cold wind snapped by us, extinguishing our fire. A few of us jumped at the unexpected gust.

We tried to reignite the fire, but nothing worked. Calling it a night, we all went to our tents and went to bed. I slept horribly, plagued by unsettling dreams.

I was standing at the edge of a tree line, looking at an open field. The moonlight illuminated tents that had been erected. The dream shifted to one of the tents. A long claw attached to a wrinkled tan finger slowly pulled on the zipper to the tent, revealing the sleeping form of Sam inside.

The shriveled, gnarled hand slowly reached into the tent, taking two of its clawed fingers and delicately sliding them into Sam’s closed eyes. Sam began to shake, his arms flailing wildly. The hand pulled Sam out of the tent and raised him up into the air. His mouth opened, releasing horrible screams. He grabbed the fingers that were currently impaled into his eyes, trying to pull them out.

Another weathered hand slowly reached toward the convulsing form of Sam and, with one clean swipe, slit his throat. Sam’s hand clasped his throat, trying to stop the loss of blood. Streams of crimson poured out from between his hands and fingers, and Sam’s hands slowly dropped to his sides.

This thing repeated this for the others. Nate. Isaiah. James. Its finger, now stained in blood and vitreous, pulled open my tent. As it reached its hand inside, I snapped awake.

It was morning. I was covered in sweat and had managed to remove myself from my sleeping bag. Peering outside, I saw everyone else sitting around the campfire, talking, laughing, and making breakfast.

We later packed up and were taking the drive back home, and I asked if anyone had dreamed anything last night. Everyone shook their heads. They asked me if I had dreamed anything. I told them what had happened, leaving out the violent manner of their deaths.

Everyone thought it was weird but assured me that it was nothing—that the ritual we had performed had gotten me on edge, and my worry had bled into my sleep. Nate poked fun at me, asking if they needed to call my mom to come pick me up. Everyone shared a laugh, and Nate told me not to worry. I reluctantly agreed, but I still felt wrong.

A week later, I got the news.

Sam was dead.

One of his roommates had found him in his room and called the police. While the report of the death didn’t include any details other than that he bled out, I was able to meet with his roommate and talk with him.

He was obviously distraught by this. The manner of Sam’s death was unsettling, to say the least.

Sam’s eyes had been gouged out, and his neck slit.

I quickly brought this up to everyone who had done the ritual. Everyone thought it was unusual and very upsetting but weren’t convinced—even after I mentioned how Sam had died in my dream. Isaiah was convinced that I was misremembering my dream to match Sam’s death to justify my paranoia, saying that dreams were simply the mind’s way of processing excess stimuli.

But I knew there was something more. What we had done, what Sam had believed that night, had invited something evil into this world, and it wasn’t going to stop until it had come for each one of us.

Researching was difficult. The ritual had few additional details, and I couldn’t find anyone else who had performed it. There were no reported deaths that matched Sam’s, and no online legends or myths had anything remotely related.

Another week quickly passed, and I woke up to a text from Nate in the old camping group chat:

“Something’s here.”

No other texts after that. Once again, same as last week, I got the news.

Nate was dead.

He had always been the charismatic glue of the group, and with him gone, there was nothing to keep the remaining two in check. Their panic was coming in at full force now, and they fully believed me. And if this macabre countdown continued, Isaiah was next.

We strategized on what to do. The hubris of youth made us think we could prevent this inevitable march toward death. We went to sages, shamans, priests, witch doctors, and medicine men, collecting any item that was said to ward off evil spirits.

On the night of Isaiah’s demise, we stood in his room, waiting. We had placed salt at every door and window and placed talismans in every corner. We drew seals of protection around Isaiah and held crucifixes, ready to brandish them at this entity.

We all waited anxiously as an old grandfather clock ticked in the corner. It began to chime, announcing the arrival of midnight. And the arrival of death.

James and I stood in the room when Isaiah’s eyes started to dart back and forth, until they settled on the doorway of his room.

“Something’s at the door,” he screeched.

Neither I nor James saw anything, but Isaiah continued to look panicked. I urged him to stay in the circle.

The handle to the door slowly turned, the sounds of age and rust ringing. The door slowly swung open, but nothing was there.

“What is that thing?” Isaiah stammered, his knees shaking, the color draining from his face. “How is this possible?” James and I exchanged a look. Neither of us saw anything.

“Don’t come any closer!” Isaiah yelled out, holding his crucifix in front of him. While his voice may have carried some semblance of courage, the quivering of his hand betrayed him.

I could make out the sounds of footsteps quietly approaching Isaiah. As the steps came closer, Isaiah’s tremors became more and more violent.

Isaiah backed away, stepping out of the circle and toward the edge of the room.

“What do you want?” he whimpered, as the sounds of dripping water could be heard, a dark spot appearing on his pants. James and I tried to intervene, brandishing our own crucifixes and burning incenses.

Stumbling and tripping, Isaiah scrambled away from this intruder until his back was against the wall. His eyes, which had begun welling up with tears, frantically glanced toward James, then me, pleading.

“Please,” he whispered. “I don’t want to die.”

We did everything we could. I grabbed a chair and threw it in the space in front of Isaiah, while James threw holy water. The fear that remained on Isaiah’s face told us nothing had worked.

Suddenly, he screamed. Deep red pits formed in his eyes, and his head was pinned to the wall. He flailed desperately, throwing his arms and legs around wildly. At that exact same moment, I felt a searing pain in my eyes, like hot nails being driven into them.

I howled in pain as I reached my hands to my face and felt warm liquid leaking from my eyes. I looked over at James and saw a river of blood was stemming from his eyes. Dropping to the floor, I clawed at my eyes, the pain worse than anything I had ever felt. I glanced over to Isaiah, vainly attempting to prepare myself for what would happen next.

A massive gash formed in his neck, and his severed arteries spewed fountains of blood, turning his screams into gargles. The gouges in his eyes leaked blood, giving him tears of deep crimson. He hysterically clawed at the invisible hand that had pierced his skull.

My neck erupted in a burning white pain that threatened to leave me unconscious, though I wished it did. I curled up into a ball on the floor, tears mixing with the trails of blood that ran down my face as I sobbed in pain.

With a final shake and gasp, Isaiah stopped moving.

Isaiah was dead.

I slowly pulled myself up and looked at James. There was nothing we could do to prevent this grim fate that awaited us.

James was in a panic. His inevitable death was only seven days away. I only saw him once that week before he died. He was pale, with deep purple splotches beneath his eyes. He hadn’t slept for days, and I understood the feeling.

The nights following Isaiah’s were difficult, with sleep eluding me. I vainly stayed up into the late hours of the night, hoping to be enveloped by a dreamless sleep. If only I could be so fortunate—my dreams turned into hellish nightmares of gory demise, all from the perspective of whatever this ancient evil was.

I found out that he tried to run from whatever this thing was. The plane was midair when it hit midnight. I didn’t even need the morning news to know what happened.

James was dead.

There was something almost peaceful these past seven days. Knowing when and how you’re going to die is somewhat assuring. I was destined to meet a grisly end, my eyes gouged out and my throat slit. The thought of leaving this world on my own terms crossed my mind, but I couldn’t bring myself to do it. I would meet the same end as everyone who had gone on that trip—who had done the ritual.

Reflecting on the past few weeks, a thought occurred to me. All this time I blamed Sam for performing this ritual and dooming us. I never once thought about my own actions. I was the one who told everyone about my dream. I was the one who was afraid to perform the ritual. My own thoughts and beliefs had given power to this evil.

I never should have told them my dream. Maybe they would still be alive. I can see them all, standing in the room while I write this. Their eyeless faces stare at me, watching me tell the story that doomed them.

I write this now, not as a cry for pity or a cry for help, but a warning. Do not mess with forces beyond your understanding. Do not tempt fate. Do not invite something from the great beyond. Because something might accept that invitation.

The clock on the wall has just hit midnight.

There is something at my door.

In a few short moments,

I will be dead.
