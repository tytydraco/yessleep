One by one, I called out every single employee’s name in the office, signaling them to walk into the boardroom to speak with the new CEO, Sayuri, under the premise of a layoff. In reality, it was so that she could feed on them. I didn’t know the details of how, and I didn’t wish to ask. At least the boardroom was left spotless, despite her appetite.

It took a week to go through the list for the financial and administration teams. Both had been significantly downsized from a total of 500 employees down to 227. In the aftermath, I saw many colleagues, once whom I used to consider acquaintances, seemingly express hatred towards me. I suppose it was because I didn’t act like Dakari, all sweaty, nervous, and apologetic about the whole thing. I acted like I either enjoyed the process or didn’t care about it at all.

After a few days in this role, I noticed that I started to care less and less about my happiness and well-being and more about the company’s well-being. Actually, Sayuri’s well-being, not the company’s. I seemed to obtain feelings of happiness and joy when Sayuri seemed happy, as rare as that was. But I also seemed to gain feelings of annoyance and anger when she expressed them, which was far more common.

Day and night, I did every task for her. Often, I would set up meetings for Sayuri that were more occult-related than professional. These meetings took place in dimly lit rooms, filled with the scent of burning incense and the soft hum of chanting. Attendees were a mix of business professionals and mysterious figures, their faces hidden in the shadows. The discussions were cryptic, involving ancient texts and forbidden rituals.

Sometimes, I would make questionable deliveries. One evening, Sayuri handed me a small, ornate box, its surface covered in strange symbols. "Deliver this to the old bookstore on North Road," she instructed, her voice cold and commanding. The bookstore was a decrepit place, filled with the scent of mildew and the weight of forgotten secrets. The owner, a gaunt man with piercing eyes, took the box without a word, his gaze lingering on me a moment too long.

Another time, I was tasked with retrieving a package from a rundown warehouse on the outskirts of town. The package was heavy, wrapped in layers of cloth and rope. As I carried it back to the office, I could feel something shifting inside, as if it were alive. I never dared to ask what was inside.

There were also the rituals. Sayuri would summon me to her office late at night, the room lit only by flickering candles. She would chant in a language I didn't understand, her eyes glowing with an unnatural light. My role was to assist, handing her various objects—an array of strange rocks and crystals, and a somewhat sizeable quartz monolith. During these rituals, I could feel the presence of something otherworldly watching us.

Relaying cryptic messages became a regular part of my duties. Sayuri would hand me a list of names and numbers, instructing me to make contact and relay her messages. The conversations were always brief, filled with coded language and veiled threats. I could hear the fear in the voices on the other end of the line.

Through it all, I felt myself slipping further away from who I once was. My days were consumed by tasks that defied logic and morality, yet I couldn't bring myself to resist. My unwavering need to serve Sayuri had become my only true motivation in life now.

Today, however, I was given a unique assignment. I entered her office for the first time since my promotion. The room was quite large, with high ceilings and a sense of spaciousness. A large, mahogany desk dominated the center of the room, its surface meticulously organized with a sleek computer, a few neatly stacked files, and a single, elegant pen. Behind the desk, a bookshelf lined the wall, filled with an assortment of business manuals, financial reports, and a few leather-bound volumes whose titles were written in languages I couldn't decipher.

The walls were adorned with framed certificates and awards, a testament to Sayuri's professional accomplishments. Yet, amidst the typical office decor, one item stood out—a peculiarly nice decorative black crystal. It was placed on a pedestal near the window, catching the light in a way that made it seem almost alive. The crystal was smooth and polished, its surface reflecting an array of dark, swirling patterns. It exuded an aura of beauty and mystery, drawing my gaze and holding it captive.

As I stood there, taking in the details of her office, I couldn't shake the feeling that the crystal was watching me. My thoughts were interrupted by Sayuri.

“Well. Come now. Sit down,” she said sternly. “I do not have time to waste on you gawking at my office.”

I sat down immediately, my heart pounding in my chest.

She continued, “Do you remember all those employees who were laid off?”

I nodded in silence, unsure of where this was going.

“Well, I need you to assess them and recruit some of them back,” she said.

“But how?” I replied in confusion. “Aren’t they all dead?”

“Definitely not,” she said with a chuckle. “They are trapped in a world normally out of reach for humans. However, you will be able to visit. Usually, this would be done by me, but I need to find someone special.”

“I can do that for you,” I said without hesitation, the words escaping my mouth before I could fully process them.

“Good. You have 60 days to finish this assignment.” She hesitated a bit, then continued, “Right. When you go to my world, you will have no sense of time. So keep it short, as that world tends to run faster in time than on Earth.”

“Do I need to keep anything in mind or prepare for anything before I go?” I inquired, trying to mask my growing anxiety.

“No. I need you to go now. You see that crystal over there?” She pointed at the black crystal on the pedestal. “Go there and hold it with both hands.”

I walked over to the black crystal, its surface smooth and cool to the touch. I held it with both hands as instructed, feeling a strange energy pulse through my fingers. I waited for five seconds, my mind racing with questions.

“Then what should I do… next?” I began to ask, but my voice trailed off as the room around me dissolved into darkness. When the world came back into focus, I found myself standing in a forest of large crystal obelisks. They seemed to be made of white quartz, their surfaces shimmering in the dim light. The air was thick with an otherworldly energy, and the silence was almost deafening.

The pedestal was still there. I placed the black crystal back on it and mentally noted its location. This seems to be my way back to the company.

I took a tentative step forward, the footstep echoing loudly. It looked like I was stepping on black glass or crystal, perfectly smooth with no rough edges whatsoever. I was surprised I didn’t slip with each step. The ground beneath me seemed to shimmer, reflecting the eerie light from the crystal obelisks that surrounded me.

As I ventured deeper into the forest, I noticed faint, ghostly figures moving among the obelisks. They were the trapped employees, their forms barely visible, like shadows in the mist. Each one seemed to be twisting and morphing into excruciatingly painful positions. Limbs snapped and reconnected, facial features such as eyes appeared and disappeared in all sorts of places, and even their clothes melted in and out of their bodies. Despite the grotesque transformations, I couldn’t hear anything. The silence was deafening, amplifying the horror of their suffering. Their expressions were contorted in agony, mouths open in silent screams, eyes wide with terror.

Yet, somehow, I felt nothing. I wasn’t moved by their pain and suffering. It was as if a part of me had been numbed, detached from the reality of their torment. I watched them coldly, my mind focused solely on the task at hand. 

I knew I had to find a way to communicate with them, to assess their state and determine who should be brought back. The first monolith I saw imprisoned Kimberly, I think. I double-checked the twisted and tortured person for recognizable features. Brown hair, blue eyes, and that annoying green hummingbird necklace that she wore every day. Yup. That’s her. Now, how do I get to her?

I watched her body twist and morph in extremely excruciating ways. At one point, her spine seemed to bend backward, appearing to snap in half. But her body remained in one piece. However, watching this endless torment didn’t help me assess her. I needed to see her state mentally, so I decided to get closer to the quartz crystal and put both hands on it, trying to get a better look.

As I touched the crystal, a cold shock ran through my body, and my vision blurred. Suddenly, I was no longer in the forest of obelisks. I found myself in a strange world that looked like someone’s apartment, but with features that defied the laws of physics. The walls seemed to bend and twist, the furniture floated in mid-air, and the light sources flickered with an unnatural glow.

Kimberly was there, sitting on a floating chair, her eyes wide with confusion and fear, all the while sobbing and hugging her teddy bear. She looked at me, and for a moment, I saw a flicker of recognition. “Help me,” she whispered, her voice echoing in the distorted space.

Then I heard electronic tapping sounds behind me. I turned around and saw Kimberly—well, another version of her—prancing towards me. This one appeared to be happy, in a twisted sort of way. She was holding a paintbrush and a canvas.

“Do you want to see what I painted, mister?” she said with a crooked smile.

She showed it to me. It was painted masterfully, each stroke seemingly bringing life to the canvas. It depicted a brown-haired girl escaping from a prison cell. The painting was vivid, almost too real, and I could feel the desperation and hope emanating from it.

As I looked back at the first Kimberly, still sobbing and clutching her teddy bear, I realized that these different versions of her represented fragments of her mind, each one trapped in its own torment. The physical twisting and morphing of her body in the crystal mirrored the mental anguish she was experiencing here.

A small part of me, buried deep under layers of suppression, wanted to help her, to repair the shattered pieces of her mind. But I felt no motivation, no drive to act on that impulse. Each day, I could sense my old self slipping away, piece by piece.

Seeing the fragments of Kimberly’s mind made me realize that she still had some humanity left, a spark of what she once was. This realization left me feeling disgusted, not with me, but with her. How could she still be clinging on to hope when none presented itself to her? The feeling of revulsion grew stronger, and I knew I couldn’t stay in her mind any longer.

The disgust triggered something within me, a desperate need to escape. Then, I found the surroundings of Kimberly’s twisted apartment and her shattered mind dissolve around me, transporting me back to the crystal that imprisoned her.

I moved onto the next crystal and found Dakari trapped in it. His body seemed to morph in ways far more excruciating than Kimberly’s. I figured that his mind might be completely broken and could be a good candidate to rehire. I placed my hands on the crystal, and my surroundings once again dissolved. This time, it was a twisted version of his kitchen.

Dakari’s favorite place was the kitchen; he loved to cook. But here, in this twisted version of his kitchen, everything was wrong. The countertops were warped, the appliances floated in mid-air, and the walls seemed to close in on themselves. The air was thick with the smell of burnt food and despair.

I found one version of Dakari crying inside the fridge, his body contorted to fit into the cramped space. His sobs were heart-wrenching, a stark contrast to the confident, cheerful man I once knew. “I just wanted to cook,” he whispered, his voice barely audible over the hum of the fridge.

Then I heard a voice echo loudly in the kitchen, yelling, “Why would you do that to yourself?!”

It was definitely him, well, another version of him. An angry version of him, with his rage well placed. However, I couldn’t find this one. Then, I heard the sounds of metal tapping all around me.

His voice echoed loudly again. “How could you stoop so low?!”

This annoyed me, so I replied, “I want to survive. I’m tired of living with nothing. Barely getting by with so little keeping me off the streets. If serving the devil means keeping me alive, then I’ll take it. And I know you would too.”

I heard a loud, angry roar, and the sounds of fast footsteps all around me. I couldn’t see him when I looked around me, left, right, and center. Then I decided to look up, and I saw him running towards me from the ceiling, defying gravity, with his favorite kitchen knife in hand. His eyes were filled with fury, and his movements were unnaturally fast, like a predator closing in on its prey.

He lunged towards me and stabbed me right in the gut. The feeling of searing, hot pain was unbearable, and I screamed loudly in response. Then he pushed me to the ground while keeping his grip on the knife. I remained still and silent while he talked.

“The way I see it, this is well deserved.” He then let out another roar as he pushed the knife deeper into my gut. I screamed again as the pain intensified.

Then I saw another version of him walk towards me and stop behind his angry counterpart. This version seemed calm and levelheaded. When he looked at me, I could see the pity and disgust on his face.

“Someday, I’ll escape,” the calm version of Dakari said. “Although I might be broken, twisted, or deformed from this hell your boss put me in, I will come out a much better man than you’ll ever be. Let this pain serve as a reminder of a small fraction of the suffering that you’ll inflict on so many others if you continue to serve her.”

He paused and then spoke to his angry version, “Do it.”

The angry version nodded, acknowledging his statement. I moved my gaze towards the knife, expecting the worst. Then he twisted the knife and quickly slid it across my gut. I closed my eyes and let out a terrible, agonizing scream. As I felt the blood leave my body, so too could I feel my soul leave. Bearing the pain no longer, my vision and consciousness seemed to fade into utter darkness.

I woke up lying on the floor with my hands on my abdomen. I looked down and noticed the blood stains on my favorite white dress shirt, with a tear in it, presumably from the stabbing motion. However, my body seemed completely fine. There was no wound and no fresh blood on me. I quickly stood up, assessing my surroundings, and found myself back in the crystal forest, in front of Dakari’s crystal.

Dakari’s pose seemed more confident now. He was standing in front of me, staring at me with pure anger. His eyes burned with intensity, and his expression was one of unyielding rage. Despite his body continuing to twist and morph in terrible ways, there were no signs of suffering on his face. It was as if his mind had found a way to transcend the physical torment, channeling all his pain into a focused, vengeful energy.

Remembering the pain he inflicted on me, I spat on his crystal and moved onto the next one. 

I am not familiar with this person. This woman is in the fetal position. I could see nothing extraordinary about her though. I watched her for a while and noticed that she didn’t move from that position at all. I decided to touch the crystal to see what’s going on in her mind.

As my surrounding once again morphed, I could see nothing but darkness all around me. I kept looking around until I saw her, seemingly under a very bright spotlight. I continued examining my surroundings, checking to see if there was any other version of her I could find, but found nothing. 

I approached her and I could see that she was in the fetal position. I greeted her, but she remained quiet. I asked what her name was, and again, kept silent. After a few minutes, this began to bore me and I decided that I needed to leave, but then a realization kicked in. Her mind was completely broken, devoid of any emotion, anything human whatsoever. 

Once someone loses everything, if they have the slightest ounce of hope, however small or false it might be, they cling to it forever. This type of learned devotion would be extremely useful to the company.

Seemingly making up my mind, pen and paper materialized in my hand. I approached her and told her that the company is willing to rehire her. All she needs to do is read over and sign this document. At first, she didn’t move, then I saw her slowly grab the pen and contract in front of me. She read it over, signed her name and passed it back to me. 

“Welcome back to Interstellar Bytes,” I said to her, extending my hand, gesturing for a handshake. “Sayuri will reach out to you shortly.”

She stood up, her movements hesitant yet filled with a glimmer of hope. Her eyes, though weary, sparkled with a faint light as she reached out and shook my hand. I noted the slight tremble in her grip. Then she sat on the ground, remaining silent while her gaze focused on the floor.

After that, my surroundings once again materialized back into the crystal forest. I repeated this process 270 times. Overall, I only found 12 others who would fit the needs of the company. I also amusingly tallied how many times I died, which was 53 by the way. After the third time, I got used to it.

I walked back to where I came from and found that familiar pedestal, displaying the beautiful black crystal. Beside it, I noticed an exact copy of my clothes, pristine and neatly folded. Considering how dirty my attire was from dying several times, I decided to change into the fresh clothes to be presentable. I picked up the black crystal with both hands, and suddenly found my surroundings morphing into Sayuri’s office.

She was sitting at her desk, her eyes fixed on me as I entered. She gestured me to have a seat. I did and gave her a rundown of how many I recruited.

“12? That’s what I expected,” Sayuri said, her tone neutral. “We can start assessing the others and see if we can rehire some of them again in, say, another month or so.”

She paused, then continued, “Oh, by the way, you were late by 3 hours. I will need to put you on a performance improvement plan. Don’t let this happen again.”

I nodded, acknowledging her words. Then I stood up and left her office. When I returned to my cubicle, the weight of my failure crashed down on me, and I sobbed violently, knowing that I had disappointed my boss.

As the tears subsided, a steely resolve took their place. This will never happen again, I vowed to myself. I will not fail my boss ever again. I will prove to her and the company that I am truly valuable.
