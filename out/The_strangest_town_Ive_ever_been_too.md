So I don't know where to start with this, even thinking of this still makes me feel ill. I just need to get it out. If I told anyone in person about this they'd think I'm crazy or trying to procces a traumatic moment.

 So back in March my mates and I were talking about taking some time off work and going on a road trip. The original plan was to meet up at 6am and leave Brisbane, head to Canberra then head back, camping along the way. 

It was going well for the most part. Taking turns with the drive experiencing more of Australia we've been wanting to do it since we were in school. Taking in absolutely beautiful sights, listening to the footy as our nights entertainment, getting burnt by our harsh sun. Good thing we didn't do this right after Christmas that heat would've been unbearable. 

We took a map, map book and a journal with us the idea was to not get lost when we lost internet along the road and mapping out our drive. We made it to Canberra and decided to book a hotel for a couple of days. Sleeing on an actual bed for two days was amazing. I also was mapping out our return, writing when we should stop where we can buy more supplies, since we decided to go on a new route on the way home. This was the worst mistake we ever made. 

On our 5th day on the way home I can't remember if we were in Queensland or New South Wales. Our driver must've taken a wrong turn along the way noticing the signs were all wrong, nothing was right. Even the air was wrong. None of us had phone reception or data connection. So many shops were all closed down and covered in a thick layer of dust. The windows had gone yellow so much was dilapidated and run down. We had managed to find a few locals and I thought to ask them for directions. They were elderly, all of them. I didn't see anyone under 60 or 70. I was asking if they knew the way back to highway. They would just stare at me. The only one who spoke to me was a tall angry creep. 

"You better get out of here boy." His teeth were all rotten and yellow. He smelt like he hadn't showered in years. His skin looked like leather. "We've got nothing left for you after you took all from us." As he kept poking my chest and pushing me. 

I got back to the truck and managed to find a bakery. Maybe it was just one grouchy guy. The bakery didn't look like it was fit to open. Not a young person in sight. The Fridges were still stocked but broken the juices looked rotten, the milks had gone thick green, the coke labels had gone white. Mouldy bread loafs in the corner of the bakery, the cakes and slices had melted into a disgusting brown sludge. The Cashier was disgusting her nails were long and yellow, her hair looked like it was falling out. Scabs all over face, her uniform her polo shirt had holes through out. And she stared at me as if I killed her mother and her lips were shaking. 

Before I could even get two words out she was screaming at me. "GET OUT WE DON'T SURVE YOU'RE KIND! GET OUT!"

 After leaving the bakery my friend pointed down the road, it was the scariest thing I had ever seen. There had to be hundreds maybe thousands of Old people slowly make their way toward us, there's no way they we all heading to the bakery. Back into the truck we had to get out of here! We felt trapped I was going through the book I felt tears swelling up in my eyes these streets weren't in the book. We were lost. The truck was definitely speeding, Tom was definitely in pain as the esky slammed into him as the truck swerved. Matt's face was pale I didn't even realise. We were going around in circles we were heading back to the bakery. I had sat in silence Matt was definitely crying at the wheel but he never stopped moving. It seemed like we drove for hours past burnt out houses, dilapidated shops, old unearthed sign posts, rusted metals. 

I don't even know how long it took everything felt like a blur after going around in laps. Matt managed to find and empty road. And managed to get us out it was eight o'clock by the time we found an actual tar road. I took over the truck. I let Matt sleep and helped Tom in the back. I kept my eye on the fuel gauge hoping I can find a servo to top up or sleep at until they open. 

The rest of the trip was mundane. This event sucked all excitement and energy we could ever have. We back home six days earlier than expected. Matt was back in the driving seat dropped Tom and I off. We never spoke to eachother ever again. I heard back in early June Matt took his life and it seemed like Tom disappeared his apartment was completely cleared out and no one, not his family or his partner have seen him since. I'm just worried something is going to happen to me. I swear I still see them the tall leather skin man, the wart face Cashier, anyone in that disgusting horde.

 I still feel like I could wake up anyday and see those people making their way towards me. I know I can never live a normal life again, I just need to pretend that never happened, pretend I don't deeply miss my friends, pretend I don't feel guilty for what happened. I know I'm scared to leave the city ever again.
