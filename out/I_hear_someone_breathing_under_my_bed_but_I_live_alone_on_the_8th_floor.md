I know this subreddit is full of strange stories, but I swear what I'm experiencing right now isn't made up.

I live alone in a small apartment on the 8th floor of a modern building. No pets, no roommates. And tonight, as I was going to bed, I heard... someone breathing under my bed.

At first, I thought it was my imagination. I turned off the music, the TV, and listened. There was breathing. Steady. Human. Slow. As if someone was trying to be discreet... but was having trouble controlling their breathing.

I froze. My phone was across the room, I didn't dare move. I waited. For a long time. Then I whispered, "Who's there?"

No answer. Just that breathing... and the sound of very slow scraping against the wooden floor. I jumped out of bed, turned on all the lights. There was nothing under the bed. Nothing in the room. I checked the door: locked. The windows: closed. I searched the whole apartment like a madman. Nothing.

But now that I'm sitting here, writing to you... I hear it again. Beneath me.

And this time, it's not just breathing.

Something is whispering my name.

Part 2   
I froze. This time, it wasn't a hallucination.

Someone, or something, had said my name. A low whisper, barely audible... but too close. As if it were right under the mattress.

I jumped out of bed again, my heart pounding so hard it felt like it was shaking the room. I looked under the bed. Again... nothing. Absolutely nothing. Not even a draft. Not a bug. Nothing.

I took a deep breath. Maybe I was just being paranoid. Maybe I'd dozed off for a moment and my brain was playing tricks on me.

But as I stepped back, my phone buzzed. I grabbed it, relieved to have a distraction.

A message from an unknown number:

"Why are you ignoring me?"

I didn't answer. A minute later, a second message:

"I'm cold in here. You could at least say goodnight."

I almost threw up. I'd never given anyone my number these past few days. I'd been living a secluded life. No social media. No people to talk to about my nightmares. I've always been a bit antisocial. That's also why I like living alone.

But at that moment, I didn't feel alone anymore.

I decided to leave the apartment. I grabbed my keys, my phone, and flung open the door. But the hallway was... darker than usual. As if all the lightbulbs had been covered in a black veil.

Then my phone vibrated one last time. A message. This time, it contained a photo.

A photo taken from under my bed.

It showed me... a few minutes ago, lying on my back, eyes wide open. I ran back into the apartment, screamed like a maniac, overturned the bed, moved everything. Still nothing. Not a single object moved. No trace. But that photo was there. On my phone.

And now... there's a new notification.

"You should come back to bed. I'm still watching you."
