“Yeah… I’m here. I’m just trying to make sense of what you’re saying.” I responded, reluctantly.

"Yeah, this all sounds crazy… we were just playing a game. What’s the worst part?" Zoey asked, her voice trembling with a mix of fear and disbelief.

“Well, right after I read that message… I heard a knock at my door.” Tray said apprehensively.

I shivered unexpectedly, this felt more like a nightmare than reality. “At your real door? Like, the door of your actual house?” I asked, my voice shaky with disbelief.

 “Yeah,” Tray said, his voice cracked. “Guys… what do I do? Should I answer it?”

“No! Don’t you dare open that door!” Zoey shouted.

“Just… just stay on the call,” I added quickly, my heart pounding faster. “It could be a coincidence, right? People knock on doors all the time; it doesn’t have to be Cabman. I mean… It could be the girl scouts.”

Tray didn’t reply immediately, but when he spoke, his voice was a whisper. “I think… I think I can hear someone trying to open the door.”

The game flickered again, and Cabman’s glowing eyes turned to face us. The screen shifted to display a disturbing close-up of his ghostly, cadaverous face. His unnaturally large, gleaming eyes seemed to peer straight into my very soul, they were stripped of all humanity—cold and sunken, as if staring into an endless void.

“Guys, the pounding is getting louder and I’m starting to freak out…” Tray’s voice cut out unexpectedly.

“Tray?” Zoey asked cautiously. “Tray are you still in chat!?”

“Zoey, we have our own Cabman problems…” I interjected, my voice thick with urgency. “I can’t move my mouse, and his freaky face is filling up my entire screen!”

“Forget about the stupid game!” Zoey shouted. “I don’t even care about it anymore, I think Tray is actually in danger!”

I couldn’t take much more. Zoey’s frustration was grating on my already waning sanity, and the ever-changing horrors unfolding in the game left me reeling. This game was once my sanctuary from the otherwise crippling monotony of life, but now, there was no solace. No comfort, only chaos as I stared into the screen; greeted with only a frenzy of flickering monitors and those terrible whispers.

Don’t get me wrong, I was worried about Tray, but I couldn’t shake the gnawing feeling that his situation and what was happening in game weren’t separate events. They felt linked, like the game and the real world were bleeding into each other, causing all of our fates to be strangely bound together.

"This can’t be happening," I murmured under my breath. "It can’t be real. This is just a stupid game… it can’t really affect the real world, right?" My hand sat trembling on my mouse, I had to do something, anything that could make this all stop. My gaze never shifted from those unblinking, unyielding, glowing eyes, as if being slowly pulled deeper into madness.

"Cabman!” I shouted, my voice shaking. “Stop this! Do you hear me!? Just stop it! All of this has to stop!" My words reverberated through our headsets, like a desperate plea cast into the void. For a moment, I stared at the screen, watching those haunting eyes, like two burning candles flickering in the darkness. It felt as if they were reaching through the screen, trying to drag me from this world into their suffocating, malevolent grasp. I waited, breathless, for something… anything to change.

“You… you know he can’t hear you! Your in-game microphone isn’t on,” Zoey said, her voice teeming with anxiety.

“No! He has to hear me!” I screamed, anger burning in my throat. “This has to end, Zoey!”

“Calm down, it’s going to be okay!” Zoey answered, her tone softening, trying to calm me. “It’s just a game!”

“It’s not a game anymore… can’t you see that?” I shouted, my voice cracking with hysteria. “It started as just a game, sure, but don’t pretend you haven’t noticed the shift! Don’t act like this isn’t all connected!”

The flickering of the screen intensified, as the image began eerily zooming in on Cabman’s disquieting, deadpan face. The lights in my room started to dim, casting unnatural shadowy silhouettes along the walls that looked like shrieking faces, amplifying the palpable sense of dread in the air. Suddenly, the computer screen turned black, my mouse stopping mid-blink before disappearing into the dense, cold darkness. A faint, otherworldly light faded from around the edges of the monitor, and for a fleeting second, I could have sworn I saw a distorted reflection of my own face staring back at me, looking as though I had Cabman’s glowing eyes. With the last glimmer of light gone, the room felt unnervingly silence.

“Zoey?” I called out in distress. “Tray? Are you there?”

There was no response, just the oppressive silence in the inescapable darkness of my empty room. I sat there, motionless, as my eyes adjusted to my surroundings again. I started to make out the blackened screen of my monitor.

It began to crackle with a faint electrical noise. Then, a shape started to pull itself out of the screen. At first, it was vague, just an indistinct outline, but as it took form, dread washed over me. I could feel my breathing increase as I realized, with mounting horror, that it was Cabman.

There was no mistaking those glowing eyes as he pushed through the screen. The monitor had become like a window, its surface parting like mere curtains he lightly brushed aside to make his entrance. His grin stretched unnaturally wide as his smoldering, sunken eyes stared directly at me, feeling as though he were staring through me.

“No… no, no, no!” I stuttered, scrambling backward as my chair tipped onto two legs after getting snagged on the worn-out carpet under me. It was useless, I couldn’t escape. His elongated arm stretched out from the screen, and I could see his cold, gray, bony fingers emerging from the sleeve of his tattered peacoat. His hand latching onto the side of my head, trapping me in his grasp.

I tried to scream, but the sound was little more than a hoarse whisper, so quiet it faded the moment it left my lips. His fingers pressed against my temples, curling like the tendrils of a spider, before sliding down to my eyes. “Look,” he commanded, his voice was gruff and thick with malice. “All I needed was an opening. A moment of weakness, the faint crack so tiny you didn’t even notice. Now, see with my eyes. Witness what I am.”

Pain shot through my skull as his fingers plunged deep into my eyes. It was like he passed through my eyes, and reached deep into my subconscious, tearing through my mind like paper. My sense of self was gone, dissolving into something or someone else. I began to hear his thoughts as if they were my own. Then, images flooded my mind. I couldn't feel myself anymore, it was like I had stepped into Cabman, or maybe he had forced me to become him.
