# The Book

My name is Logan Reed, a twenty-seven year old man from Chubbuck Idaho. Born and raised I grew up there, a smaller city. A city where most people stuck to themselves and minded each other’s privacy. My relationship with my family is that of a typical American family. My father Mark Reed served in the military in the 1990s. A strong man, not only physically, but emotionally as well. I’ve yet to see a tear shed from that man’s eyes. If only he knew where I was right now, maybe that statement would be proven to be false. Rough around the edges, visually speaking, he’s an American marine to the core. He takes great pride not only in his family but his country as well, maybe that's where I take from. I love my father and I know he loves me as well.

My mother, how I wish I could still feel the warmth of your embrace right now. I know I’m grown, and should be strong, but right now I feel like your hugs or words would be the only things to make this all better right now, and it saddens me I’ll probably never get to experience those again. My mother is a wonderful woman. Kimberly Reed, married to my father since their graduation in the early 1980s, I know their love for each other is unfaltering since the day they married. Just writing down my thoughts about my family helps me feel connected to them, even though I know my hope is slim to ever feel their presence again. My mother is a beautiful lady with long wavy blonde hair, always adorned in flashy jewelry and family heirlooms that she holds close to her heart. A true family woman, one that would jump in front of a train at the thought of danger for her family. Her love for both Dad and I is undoubtedly the strongest I’ve ever felt from any other person. I love her dearly, and I desperately hope that somehow, someday she’ll be able to read the words I'm scribbling down here about her. That way, in my last few days of being alive, she knows I’m thinking about her and the love I have for both her and Dad.

A day has passed since I last wrote here. I had to hide the papers since my captor had returned to bring food and check on us. Yes, us. I wish I could say it was only me down here, but unfortunately that’s not the case. I’m surrounded in filth, stench, and horrors that would make any man’s stomach twist violently as if an icy hand had gripped their insides and wrung them out. I don’t want to get into too many details now, as it’s not the most important. I want to document my story and how I’ve ended up down here. Hopefully, if this ever gets out, it can help bring my family closure as I know my family is grieving in my absence. 

I pray every damn night, to any deity that dares listen to my pleas that authorities find me before I succumb to these conditions like some of the other poor souls down here around me. The heavy odor down here wraps around me like a heavy shroud. It’s a sickly sweet scent, mingled with a hint of something earthy and damp.  The air feels dense and oppressive, making each breath a struggle. I struggle not to gag as the odor is constantly clinging to the back of my throat everytime I inhale. Maybe the stench will take me before these deplorable conditions do, or my abductor decides to end it for me. Hell, at this point, he’d probably be doing me a favor. I want out, but I have to get this off my chest. I need people to know what's happening here.

Okay, he’s gone so I can continue writing. My abductor has been increasingly visiting more often, checking on the rations we have down here. He finds pleasure watching us struggle when he comes down, so I’ve decided to play along to the act, I figure that’s how I’ve lasted as long as I have, I feed him his desires. If I give up fighting and resisting, he may lose the sense of joy he gets from me. If my writing seems scrambled or my thoughts don’t come out completely coherent, it’s because this isn't all written down in the same sitting. I’m slowly adding to this letter of captivity. Anytime my abductor comes, I have to hide this letter, and pretend like I’m using these crayons like my abductor intends. More on that later.

So a little about me. I’m a stalwart, resourceful man. I take great pride in my Nation, and my constitutional rights, probably inherited most of this from my Dad. I like to practice bushcraft and am an avid backpacker. Ever since the lockdowns, I’ve felt the government of our country going into turmoil is not only plausible, but imminent. Self-sufficiency and low governmental impact on one’s daily life is dwindling faster than I’d ever have expected to prepare for. Some would call me an extremist, some would call me a lunatic, and others may call me smart, aware of what’s happening to our nation and its current state of political unrest. I always have known it’s my damn duty to this nation to protect our constitutional rights and not be infringed upon. Communism scares the hell out of me. Call me crazy, but I feel it getting closer every year I’m alive. My values instilled by my father are strong, and I cherish this. I would gladly catch a bullet before kneeling to a Statist Regime. This is why I would prepare to be self-sufficient. Teaching myself the lands in which I live, how to survive without relying on other people, or my country. America was founded on these principles, and most have almost yet forgotten these damn things. It makes my blood boil. That’s why I’m here. You see, for the past four years or so I’ve been training to live off-grid. To be able to navigate the woodlands and thrive if shit ever went south, a SHTF plan if you catch my drift. I typically bring a 40L rucksack, stuffed with the typical bushcraft-wilderness type gear you might expect, and my rifle. I never leave home without it on these types of trips. 

Most of my friends and family believe these to be my “getaways”, vacations of sorts. I typically take 4-5 days off from work and travel a few hours north up to Salmon-Challis National Forest here in Idaho. The lands here are beautiful and vast. A blank canvas for someone like me wanting to hone my skills on self sufficiency and wilderness survival. I tend to ruck in with all the gear I intend on bringing in a single trip, not only as a way to save time, but more so of a way to practice if it were ever the “real deal” if you catch my drift. My bag is heavy, but nothing I’m not used to, I’ve been doing this for years up to this point. I typically park at a trailhead, let my family know which trailhead I’ve decided to park at, and give them a flight plan. You know, the typical things such as how long I’ll be gone, where I’ve parked, those sorts of things. I am positive I followed this procedure this trip, so I know authorities have already searched, probably found my Tacoma parked near trailhead #3, sent cadaver dogs out in desperate attempts to bring my lifeless body out of the woods to bring some closure to my surely grieving small family. If only they knew, if only they could find me. 

As I lay here night after night, eyes heavy with exhaustion, I feel myself slipping into the embrace of sleep. But the fear, the unrelenting fear clings to my chest nightly as if the hatch will yet open once again to my abductor descending down the steps to inflict upon us only the most sadistic of treatments, all for his own pleasure. I pray nightly as I try to calm the anxiety of these fears that I’ll hear dogs barking, helicopters flying above, or authorities shouting “over here!”, something to signal hope is not all but lost. Sometimes I think about these things so much that I begin to hallucinate them into reality. On more than one occasion I’ve believed people up above yelling “Hey! Guys over here, we’ve found the site!”, so much so that I’ve caught myself responding to my own hallucinations. “Guys! Down here!” trying to catch the attention of these apparitions of my own mind, desperate attempts to cope with the situation I’ve found myself within. 

On the 7th of June is when I left for this trip. A trip that I intended to last no longer than a week. The idea was to hike off trail, set up a small campsite, and practice some of the skills I’ve been working on. Setting up lean-tos, Paiute Deadfalls, some typical Fixed-Snare traps, nothing too abnormal for the bushcraft community. Typically on these treks, I pack food to last the entire duration of the trip but I restrict myself from eating from my own rations if at all possible to get used to processing and eating the food I can forage for myself. A way to practice sufficiency here in the woods if I ever was in a situation where rations weren’t a luxury available to me. To some this sounds absolutely ridiculous, and I must admit, to some degree they wouldn’t be entirely wrong. I know my types of camping trips are drastically different then the typical hiker/camping folk around these parts. 

Along with bringing the typical tools and supplies you might expect on an escapade like this, as mentioned, I also bring a rifle with me. A standard AR-15, 14.5” barrel chambered in 5.56 NATO, perfectly legal to bring into the depths of these woods for self protection. I don’t consider these trips hunting trips, as that’s not why I bring firearms with me. It's more for the protection of myself in the off chance a Grizzly or some other wild animal that I’m not equipped to defend against decides to attack. 

So there I was, the 7th of June, trekking up through trailhead #3, making triple sure I locked my truck behind me as the woods slowly engulfed my surroundings. Ecstatic as always to be able to escape my reality for a week and be on my own, The solitude is always a welcome companion. Allowing me to breathe deeply and appreciate the symphony of nature around me. With no distractions or obligations, I felt a liberating joy in the simplicity of my surroundings. The gentle rustle of leaves and the distant call of birds were my only companions, and I reveled in the peace that came with being alone. Here, in the heart of the wilderness, I found a deep happiness in my own company, a rare and precious gift in the modern world. Most people aren’t capable of being their own company for a week, seemingly losing their minds before the first 3 days are over. I find joy in knowing I’m not a part of that crowd, being solo is what allows me to truly feel at ease. 

I must’ve hiked for the entirety of the first day, way off the trail almost immediately as I entered the engulfing canopy of Pines, as I specifically don't want to use the campsites designated for other campers. I was traveling North according to my compass, a new area that I had yet ventured on any past excursion out to this beautiful forest. I always pack small fluorescent orange or pink flagging tape to mark my direction as It makes it easier for me in the situation I get turned around out here. I mark the trees as I travel further into the bush and tear them down as I make my way back. A ritual I’ve been practicing for years and have never made the mistake of forgetting. This trip was no different. I hope everyday that someone will notice my unmistakable fluorescent tape and decide to follow it. In fact, I’m quite surprised that if the authorities have already found my truck, which I’m sure they have, how they haven't already noticed the tape. I began marking the trees less then ten minutes into my hike and didnt stop until I found my site I had settled on. On the days after finding my site, I typically make morning coffee and set off on little mini-hikes as I explore the woods around me, nothing abnormal as sitting at my site the entire day would be a waste of my trip. Exploring the woods around my campsite was a delightful adventure. Each step I took on the winding paths built by nature felt like a journey into a hidden world, filled with the vibrant chatter of birds and the rustling of leaves underfoot. I marveled at the intricate patterns of sunlight filtering through the canopy, casting dappled shadows on the forest floor. The air was fresh and invigorating, carrying the earthy scent of pine and moss. I paused to examine curious mushrooms, trace the rough bark of ancient trees, and listen to the soothing murmur of a nearby stream. 

I decided on settling on a site nearby a small stream so as to not run out of fresh water. As any hiker would know, water is the heaviest asset to your trek in, the less you have to carry in, the better. I always bring water filters and drink from the water I source from the forest rather than relying on bottled water overpriced as the nearest supermarket. Bringing seven days worth of water on my person into the hike would have left me immobile, nobody can carry that much weight on their back along with the other necessary supplies to live out in the boonies for a week. I typically always try to locate water on my first day, its top priority for me, and I hardly ever stray too far when settling on a site, for water is crucial to anyone out here. I must have made it over 10 miles the first day hiking in, not wanting to stop until my feet couldn't take it any longer or until the sun decided to set on me. Not entirely sure where I ended up, but I’m positive I didn't falter from marking the trees with my tape as I always do. I had a direct line of trees marked in tape from my site somewhere past 10 miles into the woods all the way to the trailhead where my truck was parked. This is what I latch onto everyday as I pray I’m found. Unless, of course, my abductor has found them and taken care of them.

A day has passed since my last entry here. There's a woman down here, goes by the name of Amy. My abductor took her last night up to the surface and that was the last I’ve seen of her. As he dragged her up by the feet, I could hear the desperate cries for help as her nails dug into the dirt covered wooden floor we’re all laying on, some shackled, some not. I could see the tears running down her cheeks as her fingers left a distinct streak of abrasions against the small wooden ramp up. It’s traumatizing to even lay eyes on them as it serves as a constant reminder to not disobey. The terror in her eyes, the banshee-like screams as she howled for mercy, and the unnerving muffled struggle that ensued when she was no longer in sight only to end with the loud thud followed by a light distinct ring of metal reverberating as Amy’s cries for help immediately ceased. Must’ve been a shovel or something, but I can’t be too sure. All I know is that it was blunt, metal, and seemingly took Amy’s promising life cut too short by a monster. A budding future snatched away by sadistic actions. My abductor came down last night and demanded Amy to put on her diapers, pacifier, and begin coloring in her coloring book. I distinctly remember Amy spitting on his shoes followed by a soft but stern “Fuck you, you sick fuck”. That ultimately would be the decision that determined Amy’s fate. It wasn't but a few moments later the metal was clanking on her lifeless body up above, and I can only imagine we’re all in for the same treatment if we decide to react like Amy.

I don’t want to keep interrupting myself on these pages but as things progress, I have to document them. It’s important not only for any authorities who may happen across these documents, but also the families of the victims that reside here with me. Sorry If I’m rambling, it’s hard to keep my head straight with all of what’s going on. The second and third night of my trip went seemingly well. I got to practice the skills I’ve been studying. I got to hike up and down this small stream of water, catching glimpses of birds and fish alike, all allowing the beauty of nature to unfold around me.  I watched as the water danced over rocks, creating a soothing, rhythmic sound. Nearby, a family of deer grazed quietly, their presence a reminder of the serene coexistence within this natural sanctuary. The clear water glistened like diamonds under the sun. As the second night drew to a close, the sky transformed into a canvas of brilliant oranges, pinks, and purples, the sun setting behind the distant mountains. The first stars began to twinkle in the deepening twilight, and the forest gradually settled into a peaceful hush. I knew there was no other place I’d rather be at that very moment.

The third day happened to be much of the same. Go down to the stream, collect filtered water for my coffee all before heading out to hike around my secluded site, wondering what other observations I would be able to make that day. All seemed normal until I noticed my rifle was missing. “Weird” I thought, as I never left it out of arm's reach, but in a state of mild panic I talked myself down from overreacting, I must’ve placed it somewhere close by the night before and forgotten. The routine of that morning quickly divulged into just locating my firearm, securing it, and making sure I was safe and not losing my marbles. I’ve made trips like these for years and this is the first time I’ve ever made a careless mistake to misplace my firearm. Embarrassingly, the first thought that seeped into my head was the price of the damn thing. Not that it was the most important thing, but I knew I was mad that I may have lost the damn thing that cost me a few paychecks. I never expected to use it on the trip, so the fear of a hunting trip cut short wasn’t a thought, but the fear of being unarmed in an environment that could pose danger was a lingering thought that began to fester and grow the longer I struggled to locate it. 

I began to retrace my steps the day before. Stretching my memory as thin as I could to go back to every location I had been to the second day wasn’t hard, as I really hadn’t traversed that far away from my site, but to no avail. I sat there, scratching my head, was I losing my mind? I distinctly remember placing it next to me in my lean-to made of tarp and shrubs harvested from the forest floor. I never leave that thing, and I mean never. I don’t bring intoxicants on these trips, for good reason. I don’t smoke, drink, or do anything that could impair my judgment or memory. I trust myself enough that I fell asleep next to my rifle, as I’d rather have clear access to it in the case of an emergency in the middle of the night than having to scramble to find it in the darkness. This was the last memory I had of it. I didn’t hear any bumps in the night, in fact that night was one of the quietest nights out here. The forest seemed to come to a collective agreement to rest. The usual chorus of nocturnal creatures fell silent, and an eerie stillness enveloped the woods. Not a single rustle of leaves or chirp of insects could be heard. The trees stood motionless, their branches hanging quietly in the cool night air, as if even the wind had decided to sleep. The silence was profound and absolute, creating a sense of tranquility and reverence. It was as if the entire forest had taken a deep breath and held it, shrouded in a peaceful, undisturbed quietude. I distinctly remember how peaceful of a sleep I would have, going undisturbed by any stray sounds that the forest typically would echo throughout the night. 

Nonetheless, I continued to scour my camp and areas I visited the day before to locate my rifle, no luck. “Damn it” I clearly remember uttering to myself under my pursed lips, riddled in frustration. By the middle of the afternoon I had decided to not let this misplacement of my rifle be the end of my otherwise wonderful trip, so I put it behind me. Telling myself “I’ll just get another one when I return. “Hell, maybe even an upgrade” seemed to not only calm me, but helped to readjust my mind from disappointment to anticipation and excitement. From that point on, I didn’t let that single moment define the rest of my trip. Did I feel a little vulnerable from that point on? Yes, of course. But I’ve been doing this for years, not once have I actually needed my rifle so I felt this trip wouldn’t be any different. If only I knew. If only I had the damn thing come the fourth day of my trip, my entire future would be different. But here I am, scribbling my sorrows and mishaps on a fucking coloring book.

The rest of the third day seemed to be much like the second, except for that night. In the forest that night, sleep was a foreign concept, as if every inhabitant had agreed to take turns keeping watch over the realm of darkness. Owls hooted in the distance, their haunting calls reverberating through the trees, while insects buzzed and chirped in a cacophony of activity. Branches creaked and groaned under the weight of unseen visitors, and the occasional scurry of small animals added to the restless energy that permeated the night air. The boundaries of night and day seemed to blur that evening as if the forest had completely forgotten its unwritten agreement it seemingly made the night prior. I had a restless sleep that night. Whether it was due to the constant sounds of the forest not sleeping or the weight of not having my rifle and not knowing what happened to it, I couldn’t tell you. All I remember was having a hard time sleeping that night.

On came the fourth day into my trip. I was groggy all morning. The coffee tasted much the same as it did the day prior. Besides my body not getting a full night's rest, the rest of the morning followed much of the normal routine. Stream, water, coffee, pack my day bag, bear bag my food up into a tree in case a hungry predator decided to get a little too nosy near camp, and off I went. This morning I distinctly remember walking in a different direction than the days prior. Not for any particular reason, other than wanting to see different landscapes I was living amongst on my trip.

Instead of walking along the stream bed, like I had done the couple nights prior, I decided to head off the opposite direction, farther into the canopy. Stepping this direction into the forest, I was immediately enveloped by a cool, dim embrace. The kind of embrace nature has on a man’s soul when he knows he’s exactly where he should be, at that exact moment in time. Towering pines stretched their branches skyward, their leafy canopies intertwining to form a natural ceiling that filtered the sunlight into a gentle, dappled glow. Shadows amongst the forest floor began to almost dance in uniformity I can’t quite describe here, creating a near mosaic of light and dark patches that moved in harmony and synchronicity of the swaying canopy up above. Again, making sure to tag the trees as I went. Despite how entranced I may become of the nature surrounding me, I never let my “awe” of the land deter me from my practice and rationale. 

Time seemed to dissipate as I was under constant observation of the land. The fungi that grew upon fallen tree limbs, the scamper of small critters dashing in and out of bushes like a Scooby-Doo cartoon, the insects that seemingly knew exactly what to do without being told. The entire trip that day was, while not anything new to me, nonetheless still mesmerizing. Sorry, I’m rambling. I tend to go on minor tangents as a way to cope and distract myself of my situation.
