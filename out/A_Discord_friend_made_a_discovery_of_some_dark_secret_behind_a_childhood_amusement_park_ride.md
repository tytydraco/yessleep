When I was a kid, growing up in a small town in the country, there was this local amusement fair of sorts. It had one of those weird-ass octopus arm rides with the many arms and rows of seats. It was one of my favorite rides growing up in this joint. However, I didn't think much of it back then, thinking it was some stupid ride from my childhood. But then I had a convo with one of my friends from Discord who had also visited the fair back then. But she knows way more than me of the event for some reason. And as such, she ended up spilling the beans on something hidden in plain sight.

I've included for you below a transcribed copy of the Discord messages with the anonymous friend. My messages will be in italicized standard. The friend's messages will be labeled in **bold**

>*do you remember that one ride in the town. you said you visited it when you were a kid*

>***The one that looks like a lady? Yeah, uh, no. I’d rather not***

>*lady? y not?*

>***Oh, you probably haven’t heart about it, huh.***

>*huh?? wat do you mean??*

>***Wow, you seriously don’t fucking know.***

>*UST TELL ME WHAT IT IS OKI*

>*wait, what does it look like again*

>***Yeah, yeah. You got it, already.***

>*shir, really*

>***Yeah***

>*??*

>*that was easy.*

>***Mm, you’re kinda correct.***

>*bruh, you’re telling me im correct than kinda? am I or not make up your mind*

>***You got the main gist.***

>*oki are you gonna tell me the full aaa thing*

>***Yeah I am***

>*THEN WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR*

>***OK CHILL I will! Gimme a minute***

>*sute*

>***So the theme park was built around the 2000s right? Like, they were peak during that time. Though, starting out, they also had to deal with a lot of troubling people— or customers. It depends if they paid the ticket or not.***

>*vontinue plz*

>***Anyways, the word going around says that there used to be this 19-year-old college lady who would always come here and tag her sign in a TON of the posts or rides.***

>*all of it?*

>***Yeah, all of it. She’d always come back if they washed it or removed it. Which.. wasn’t often, actually.***

>is that a bad or good thing

>***Apparently the paint she used was really hard to get rid of. And it just made the staff— and obviously the owner— frustrated.***

>*well, i mean. i would be as well.*

>***But not anymore, they caught her one day.***

>*oh dang.*

>***She apparently was around that area— she pointed to the ride— when she was doing her “duty”.***

>***That’s… honestly, kinda stupid of her.***

>*PFFT i get ya on that*

>***Yeah, cuz why the fuck would you be spraying in an open area???***

>*maybe she got cocky.*

>***Maybe.***

>***Yeah. So, they surrounded her and that’s how they caught her. I guess you know what happens next.***

>*I… wow.*

>***Yeah, apparently this place is rumored to also be run by some cult. — haha, so absurd—***

>***Hey man what if it’s true :(***

>*girlie, these are rumors. you reallyy think I’m gonna believe some oral lore type shit here TOT*

>*ugh then keep going*

>***So, cult. Cult used girl in some random ritual. Girl ended up as an amusement park rid****e.*

>*ohhhhhh*

>***Yeah.***

>*oohhhhhhhhhh.*

>***Yeahhh.***

>*How…. How.*

>***I don’t know. That’s just black magic.***

>*yeah but jow does it work? the specifics i mean*

>***Well, that’s why I don’t wanna go on that ride.***

>*Oh…*

>***As a mechanic, you have to go inside the “body” right? To fix the ride and such? Yeah, apparently not all of it is metal and wire.***

>*Ohh….*

>***Sometimes people can hear the walls beating. That the walls look rather fleshy..***

>*Eugh..*

>***And that they can hear whispers whenever they’re inside the internals***

>*jesus that's enough. i may be sick after this*

>***HAHAHHA— That’s exactly the same expression I had!***

>*i mean honestly, 1st of all, what kind of bumblefuck would make a rumor about this? and secondly, why this specific and graphic??*

>***Who knows? Maybe it is true***

>*do not say that I will kick you in the damn mouth*

>***FIINNNEE I WON’T . You’re so sensitive like Jesus!!***

>*WELL, BE HONEST, WHO WOULD WANT TO HEAR THAT*

>***OK you make a good point there.***

>*why thank yoi*

>***But yeah, call me crazy. But it’s why I don’t wanna go inside. I remembered my sister went in there once.***

>*oh shit.*

>***She told me she kept hearing someone calling for her.***

>*WTF*

>***It was faint but she said she heard***

>"**They tore me open"**

>oh shit

>*you wannaaaa go somewhere that’s not here next time we visit?*

>**Sure thing bucko!**

I'm busy in College right now, will get back to her eventually if there are more incidents like this. It feels like there's something right under our noses where I live. Heck, maybe the entire world.

I will report on more curious findings when I'm free.
