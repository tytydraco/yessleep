I went on a several-day camping trip to an old forest in the Pacific Northwest, seeking the peace that had become increasingly elusive in recent years. After months of working in the cramped, overcrowded New York City, I wanted to feel free again, to return to my roots, and breathe air untainted by the noise of the big city. I was a writer, or perhaps just trying to be one. I lacked inspiration, felt burned out, as if every story I tried to write died before it even had a chance to be born. The old forest, known as Inis Forest, is located in Washington State. It was supposed to be a place where I would regain my muse, reconnect with nature, and my own thoughts. I found this forest by chance while browsing old maps for places that weren't frequented by tourists. People spoke little of it, and what locals said was vague enough to pique my curiosity. They spoke of dense vegetation, dark trees that seemed to have a life of their own, a place where man becomes an intruder, an unwelcome guest. Before heading to the forest, I decided to stop by a local store.

When I entered the store, I felt a relief from the oppressive cold that had surrounded me since I left the car. The small room was filled with warmth and scents that reminded me of home—old wood, dried herbs, and something else I couldn't quite define. A soft chime from the bell above the door rang as I closed it behind me. Behind the counter stood an older man with a face wrinkled like old wood, but his eyes were alive and warm. I decided to approach.

"Good day," I said, trying to sound confident despite the growing unease. "My name is Henry. I need a few things for camping."

The man raised his eyebrows and smiled kindly. "Hello, Henry. What brings you here? The forest isn’t as popular as it used to be."

We talked for a few minutes, discussing the items I needed. I felt the conversation becoming more natural, and the atmosphere in the store was warm, almost friendly. The shopkeeper seemed like a nice, older man simply running his business. When I left the store, I got into my car and drove toward the forest.

I had longed for the silence, for that fleeting sense of solitude that could only be found in the heart of nature. As soon as I arrived at the spot where I planned to set up camp, I was struck by its raw wilderness. The trees were taller than anywhere else, their crowns intertwining to create a green roof through which barely any sunlight penetrated. It smelled of wet earth, decaying leaves, and something else—a sweet, almost overwhelming aroma that was hard to define. I set up my tent by a small stream that gurgled softly, as if telling its stories. The silence around me was unsettling from the start. Not the usual nighttime silence. It was a dense, anticipatory quiet, as if the forest was holding its breath.

The first night passed quietly, though I felt a creeping sense of unease. I thought it might be the wind rustling through the leaves or strange animal noises coming from deep in the forest—how wrong I was.

The next day, I decided to explore the area. I wandered through the forest, trying to lose myself in thoughts and forget the unsettling noises from the night before. Even though the sun was shining, the forest seemed dark, as if time had forgotten to reach it. I walked for a long time until I came across a place that caught my attention. It was a very old and strange tree, with a trunk so wide I couldn’t wrap my arms around it. Around it grew twisted bushes, and the ground was soft, as if something had recently dug it up. Then I noticed them. Tracks. They were under the tree. Large, deep impressions that didn’t resemble anything I had seen before. They looked like claws, as if something huge, on four legs, had walked this path.

A shiver ran down my spine, thinking it might be a bear or something like that. Instead of returning to camp, I pressed on, driven by a disturbing curiosity. With each step, the forest seemed more alien, as if it lived its own dark life. Suddenly, I realized something and stopped. Behind me came an additional step. Something was following me. The forest around me became dense, almost thicker. Cold sweat ran down my neck as I turned, trying to see what lurked in the shadows of the trees. Nothing. Only silence and trees.

I returned to camp sooner than planned. I felt that the forest was no longer a friendly place. I sat by the fire, trying to read a book, but I couldn’t focus. Each line of text seemed to blur before my eyes, and the night noises were too loud, too intrusive. When the wind stopped, I heard it for the second time—faint, almost imperceptible footsteps, interrupted occasionally by the crack of a breaking twig.

I wasn’t sure if it was actually footsteps or just my imagination playing tricks on me. But with each minute, they became clearer. Something was moving around my camp, circling between the trees. It didn’t approach too quickly; it toyed with me, testing my reaction. I held my breath, listening. For a few minutes, there was silence until suddenly I heard something that froze the blood in my veins—a quiet, unnatural breathing, as if a large, wild animal was inhaling through its nostrils, searching for my scent. I panicked but tried not to show it. I went back to the tent, zipped it up, and sat, trying to calm my breathing. But whatever it was didn’t leave. I could hear it slowly, methodically circling the tent, stopping every now and then, as if listening to my movements. It was getting closer. Each creak of the forest floor was like a death sentence, my heart pounded like a hammer when I heard the sound of heavy, measured footsteps right outside the tent. The tent moved. I froze when I realized that something was right in front of the entrance, separated from me only by a thin layer of fabric. I heard a faint, unnatural sound, as if something was dragging across the canvas, probing it with claws. Then I saw a shape—a shadow, unnaturally tall, with long limbs and a head that seemed too large for the rest of its body. I couldn’t see the details, but that outline was enough to make me feel as if someone had drained all my courage. Whatever it was, it wasn’t supposed to exist; it was now standing outside my tent, as if deciding what to do with its prey. It paused for a moment, as if listening to my quickened breathing, and then I heard the worst—a cold, dead voice that broke the silence:

"Don’t peek."

I heard the zipper slowly sliding a few centimeters, and then suddenly, without warning, it went silent. Whatever it was, it stopped trying. I didn’t sleep that night. I sat in the tent with wide-open eyes, listening to every sound. I waited to hear it again. But nothing happened. The silence was as terrifying as the earlier noises. In the morning, when I finally dared to leave the tent, the ground was covered with strange tracks. They were deep, long, as if gouged by something with enormous, powerful claws. I knew I couldn’t stay there another moment. Whatever it was, it wasn’t going to let me go.

I realized I couldn’t stay any longer. Something was wrong. The forest, which initially seemed beautiful, now felt menacing, as if it fed on my fear. I hurriedly packed my things, but I felt that I wasn’t safe.

Eventually, I made it to my car, feeling my whole body trembling with exhaustion and fear. I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was watching me from behind the trees, that this nightmare wasn’t over. I got behind the wheel, trying to steady my trembling hands, and started the engine. The tires screeched as I sped away, nearly hurting my ears. But I didn’t care—I just wanted to get as far away from that cursed place as possible. The road was narrow and winding, passing through a dark, dense forest that seemed endless. Even though it was morning, the darkness still cloaked the area, and every shadow seemed to have a life of its own. I glanced frequently in the rearview mirror, hoping not to see what had been stalking me.

 Yet, I still had the terrifying feeling that something was close, too close. Suddenly, out of nowhere, I heard a loud crash, and something hit the side of the car with such force that I lost control of the steering wheel. The car skidded, and I went off the road, crashing into a tree. Pain shot through my body as I hit my head on the steering wheel. I struggled out of the vehicle, feeling warm blood trickling down my forehead. I was injured, but I couldn’t stay where I was—whatever it was, it was still there, hiding in the shadows. I wiped the blood from my forehead and, staggering, began to run. Every step was a torment, but I knew that if I stopped, I would die. The forest now seemed more sinister than ever, and the shadows that filled it seemed to move and change shapes. I thought I could hear the crack of branches, heavy footsteps, and faint breathing echoing in my head. I ran, not knowing exactly where I was, driven only by desperation and survival instinct.

Finally, curiosity got the better of me, and I turned around. That’s when I saw it—a massive, dark silhouette among the trees. It wasn’t an animal shape. It was… unnatural. Its skin, if you could call it that, was as dark as night, matte, with no reflection of light. It resembled the damp bark of a tree, covered in mold and fungi that seemed to grow on it like living, breathing organisms. Its body was covered with what looked like roots, writhing like snakes, coiled around each other in a chaotic network that pulsed and lived its own life. The most terrifying feature was its eyes—deep-set, like two glowing red points in the shapeless mass. They didn’t blink, didn’t move, just stared straight at me, piercing me through. That gaze was empty, devoid of any human emotion. Its jaws were wide, disturbingly flexible, with rows of teeth—long, thin, and dagger-like—that seemed endless. When it opened its mouth, it made a quiet, grating sound that resembled bones breaking.

Whatever it was, it moved wildly, yet sometimes with almost graceful precision. I was paralyzed with fear. I was alone, and it was getting closer and closer. I don’t know how long I ran. It felt like the forest stretched on endlessly, and I couldn’t escape.

Eventually, after what seemed like an eternity, I saw a small light in the distance—a store where I had stopped before entering the forest. The light from that place, though faint, seemed like my only hope. Barely able to stay on my feet, I reached the store’s door. I was soaked, covered in mud and blood, and every breath brought searing pain. I pounded on the door with my fist, almost collapsing from exhaustion. The door opened suddenly, and there stood the old shopkeeper, the same man who had warned me about the forest.

“For heaven’s sake, what happened?” the shopkeeper asked, horrified at my condition.

I fell to my knees, grabbing his hand. 

“Help me… Please… Something… something is in the forest…”

The shopkeeper helped me up and led me inside, then quickly locked the door and pulled the bolt. I felt the presence of something unnatural, as if the darkness from the forest was still with me. The shopkeeper looked into my eyes, as if searching for answers, then his face paled, and an expression I couldn’t understand appeared in his eyes—a mixture of fear and recognition.

“I saw something,” I said, feeling the fear returning.

“It was… something strange that was following me and…”

His face went pale and his took on a deep sadness.

“I’m sorry to hear that, Henry, but I have no choice.”

The shopkeeper slowly moved toward the counter.

I began to back away, but my legs refused to move, as if the ground beneath them had suddenly become sticky and heavy.

“That thing… has a name, Henry.”

“I’m sorry to hear that, Henry,” he said softly. “I’m really sorry…”

The shopkeeper reached under the counter, and I saw a glint of metal. Without warning, he struck me on the head with a crowbar. The pain was unbearable—darkness engulfed me, all I felt was the increasingly distant pain.

“Its name is Inis,” I heard his voice before I completely lost consciousness.
