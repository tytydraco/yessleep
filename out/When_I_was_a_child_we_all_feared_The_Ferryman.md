I never thought I'd end up telling this story.
In fact, I’d buried these memories so deep, I hadn’t thought about them for nearly two decades. Not until I saw the news the other night and then suddenly, every childhood memory I’d forced into the basement of my brain came screaming back.

Growing up, my town had its own local horror story. You know, the kind every place seems to have—the boogeyman parents would use to keep kids from wandering too far. Ours was called "The Ferryman."

The story went that he stole kids who misbehaved. What he did to them after… well, that changed depending on who was telling it but no matter the version, the message was always the same:

"Listen to your parents, don't talk to strangers and never wander off on your own or else The Ferryman will take you away."

We used to scare the hell out of each other with it. I swear kids love being terrified when it’s still a game.

The year was 2007 when everything became real.

I was eleven that summer. It was me, Jimmy Raddick, and my cousin Matt. The three of us were damn near inseparable back then. We were poking around in the woods near the old abandoned mines, looking for raccoons or maybe a spot to build a “fort.” You know, stupid kid stuff.

Matt was the first one to spot it.

“Yo,” he said, pointing through the trees. “You see that? Looks like a shack or something.”

We pushed through some underbrush and there it was, this weird, half collapsed shack made of rusted tin, moss covered plywood, and tar paper flapping like black skin in the breeze. It looked like it had been dropped there by a tornado and forgotten for decades.

“Bet a hobo lives here,” Jimmy muttered, kicking an old can aside. “Or like, a murderer.”

“Or maybe it’s where the Ferryman sleeps,” Matt grinned, leaning close to the busted doorframe.

“Shut up,” I said, trying to laugh it off. “It’s just some old shed. Probably full of raccoon shit.”

We went in anyway.

Inside, it smelled like mold, metal, and something… sweet. Sickly sweet. Flies buzzed near a corner where something was definitely rotting. The floor was dirt, the ceiling sagged then there were the jars.

So many jars.

Some were filled with cloudy water. Others had dirt, or bugs. Another one though had a photo inside, an old Polaroid of a small girls face, all bloated and blue like she’d been underwater for too long.

Matt held it up, frowning. “Dude… I was joking before but what if this is his place? The Ferryman's shack?”

That was it.

We all bolted.

Ran like hell through the trees, branches slapping our faces, roots trying to trip us. I swear I heard footsteps behind us but not in rhythm with ours. Slower. Heavier. Deliberate.

Like he wasn’t in any rush to catch us.

We didn’t stop until we were back in town, gasping and shaking.

Jimmy tried to laugh. “That was just some homeless guy’s shack, right?”

Matt looked pale. “There were bones, man.”

“They were animal bones,” I said, but I didn’t believe it.

None of us did.

After that… things got strange.

Jimmy started getting nosebleeds. Every day. The kind where it just poured out of him like someone turned on a faucet. He said his ears rang constantly, like a whisper he couldn’t quite make out.

Matt started sleepwalking. His mom found him one morning standing barefoot in the middle of the street, staring down the road like he was waiting for someone.

Me? I couldn’t sleep. I kept feeling like I was being watched. I started locking my closet and pushing a chair in front of the door to try and get some peace of mind at night.

Then one day, Jimmy was just… gone. No goodbye, just… gone.

I remember knocking on his door and Mrs. Raddick answered but something was off. Her eyes were red. She looked at me like she couldn’t place my face.

“Is Jimmy home?”

She swallowed. “We’re… we’re moving right now. You should go home, sweetheart.”

“What? But—”

She shut the door before I could say anything else.

It wasn't until I went back to school, that I started hearing the truth. That Jimmy had disappeared. It was like everyone was too afraid to talk about it though. The whole town seemed to look the other way. 

A week later in the middle school, someone spray-painted "FERRYMAN IS REAL" across the gym wall in dripping red letters. They repainted it the next day, but the whispers never stopped.

I asked my mom once. She was washing dishes, humming along to the radio. I just blurted it out.

“Mom… do you believe in the Ferryman?”

She laughed. “Oh, honey. That old story? I told that to you when you were five to keep you from sneaking out at night.”

“Yeah but… what if he’s real?”

She turned around, wiping her hands on a towel. “You have such an imagination. Honestly, maybe it’s time you stop hanging out with Matt so much. You’re starting to sound like him.”

I bet she regretted saying that because a month later...

.. Matt disappeared.
