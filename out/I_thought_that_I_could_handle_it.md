Just now the three of us were chatting. Me and my friends. Just now there was a young couple outside their apartment, waiting. 

I wave an *ofuda* about, hoping for a miracle, let it fly.

Nothing.

I ignite a paper talisman, watch its familiar blue streak into a corner.

Nothing. They’re still gone.



I take out my phone. It’s currently 12:31PM. No signal, but it still says “emergency numbers only”. I hope against hope that it somehow works. Nothing. I leave it on the table.



I look out the window. There’s nothing but… static?



I plead with whatever it is to let my friends go. They’re innocent, come out and fight me! Nothing.



I recite the Lord’s Prayer, spray holy water around, please something, anything happen, even the slightest warp in this illusion will do, tell me I’m on the right track here. Nothing.



Why didn’t they tell me what the damned thing was?! I thought that this would be simple, routine, ten minutes at worst. It’s currently… 12:31PM. I want to laugh, scream my throat dry.



But however routine it was, I shouldn’t have let civilians in, right? This isn’t something that self-defense skills can get one out of. I shouldn’t have brought them in. Now they’re gone. They’re gone, and I have no idea how to bring them back. 



If they’re even alive…



No, no, this isn’t happening, this isn’t happening. This is just a bad dream and I just have to wake up in my warm bed and never get up today. 

I slap myself once, twice. It stings badly.

*Nothing.*



I fall on the sofa. Is this where I’ll spend the rest of my life? Alone? In this small apartment. The door’s locked, and it’s not like this entity would have created anything to look at outside anyway.



I just wanna go home…



*clink*

What’s that sound? It seems to have landed on the table. 

I get off the sofa. It’s probably a rusty nail though, or a piece of ceiling-



It’s a finger. Specifically, a thumb, slowly leaking some bluish fluid, more than what the thing could have possibly held. Dripping off the table, and onto the floor.



My legs turn to jelly, and I hold myself upright by the sofa. Calm down, Akemi. It showed up, which means that I can actually fight it. 



The fluid surface is disrupted. Instantly filled back, as if something was dipped in it. Text is appearing on the floor. “Can… you…”



I draw all my talismans and ignite them at the text. The blue lights fly into the area- and detonate midair?

But I can feel the illusion weakening. Fuzzy cracks have appeared!

Another splattering of fluid appears. I draw my *ofuda* and go in-



*“You don’t have to do this! Call it off!”*



Oh great, the entity is mimicking my friends’ voices! Damn you-



\-it released another spray of fluid at me. My face is now blue. Is this stuff toxic? I unleash my barrage and rush towards the washroom. Thankfully the water still works.

What tools do I still have? A few bottles of holy water, a jar of salt, a bell… this should probably do. Just another strike will do.



The entity is waiting outside. There’s a fuzzy outline, light reflecting wrongly around it, standing unsteadily. Like a mere kick would put it down.

I do not *have* kicks. I have my tools, though-

*“Akemi! Please stop already! Allison, do* not *try to-”*

How does it know our names?! Also where even *is* Allie anyway?

I raise the bottle. Looking at this, just the one should be enough-

*“It’s me! Evelyn! Please stop! You’re hurting her!”*



…logic tells me that this is the entity trying to trick me. My gut tells me that this *is* actually my friend. 

But if I’ve been hitting this figure and the illusion has been breaking ever since, shouldn’t it be clear what the truth is? I open the bottle.



*“Allie, this is ridiculous… fine.”*



The sound of bottle breaking, water splashing, illusion shattering coalesces into the most wonderful sound I’ve heard.



…



The young couple waiting outside lay on the ground. Evelyn is outside checking for a pulse. She’s holding a piece of cloth, stained blue. Thank the gods, she’s given me a thumbs up.

My heart is seemingly trying to rip itself out. 

I’ve just realised the blue patches have gone away. Perhaps they were part of the illusion as well?

Never again will I bring non-combatants to-



Allison is lying on the floor, face up, in a puddle of blue, bleeding from the mouth, throat open, spasming weakly. Her glowing red eyes meet mine. Sparks shoot out her chest.

She smiles at me sadly. “I cannot even blame you for this.” Sighs. 



There are bottle shards embedded within.
