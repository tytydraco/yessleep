In for a pound. That was Reg’s motto. You had to finish what you started. Otherwise, what was the point? He always tried to see things through and regretted it when he didn’t. He had gone to school to study law and halfway through the first year had realised it wasn’t for him. The sticking point was having to represent someone you knew was guilty. All the best lawyers could do it but he knew deep down he wouldn’t be able to. 

Still he had stuck it out for the four years and got his degree. He had made friends he still had today and he had enough legal knowledge that when he was unfairly dismissed from the insurance firm he worked for, he was able to represent himself. He won the case and saved a bundle in legal fees.

He had stayed married to Dolores, his first wife, even after the relationship went sour. They had two kids together. Tom and Diane. A kid is an 18 year commitment but the rot in their relationship started to set in after 8. She would snipe at him, even insulting him in front of their children. He knew any love between them was gone. 

But being a Dad wasn’t a job you could quit so he stayed for another 10. Dolores was vindictive and he was more than sure that if he had divorced her, she would have taken the kids just to hurt him and he wouldn’t have seen hide nor hair of them in their teens. And those times, though turbulent, he wouldn’t trade for anything.

He even watched Game of Thrones to the end. That wasn’t easy. Then at a role-playing convention, he had trauma bonded with another fan who had suffered through the finale. That fan, Lucy, later became his partner. She was a great person and he loved her more than he could articulate. Life kept teaching him that it was good to see things through. In for a penny, in for a pound.

Maybe it was curiosity that made him stay to the end. He remembered a book he had read. The Incredible Shrinking Man by Richard Matheson. He wasn’t really enjoying it. It was a depressing tale about a man who is exposed to a gas that makes him shrink and shrink.

His wife forgets about him and keeps him in the basement. On his shrinking journey he has a brief romance with a little woman from a visiting circus but he shrinks past her too. In the basement he gets so small that he has to fight for his life against spiders, using a pencil as a spear. 

Things looked bleak. Every time he went to sleep he would wake up smaller again. He was now miniscule and thought this night would be his last. But this time when he wakes up he has passed over to the subatomic realm where an exciting new frontier of adventure awaits.

Reg was glad he had kept reading to the end.

The philosophy of seeing things through had served him well in his 45 years but Reg’s brother Pat was a different story. Pat never finished anything. He dropped out of his English degree because the other students were too pretentious. He quit his job as a tour guide because his boss was an asshole. Reg tried to tell him, most bosses are assholes but it didn’t seem to matter. You put up with it, you do impressions of them in the break room, then you go home and put work behind you.

Reg had watched Pat break it off with girlfriend after girlfriend for the flimsiest of reasons. This one wasn’t funny enough, or smart enough. They had too many “red flags” but to Reg the flags looked pink. The same kind of little flaws everyone had. 

One lady, who he knew Pat regretted dumping. Her name was Alice. She was gorgeous, kind and great craic. However, she was always about 20 minutes late. “What’s the big deal?” Reg had asked his brother. “Just read a book, go on your phone.” But no, she was imperfect so she had to go.

After all the quitting and dropping out, Pat ended up without much of a life to show for it. No family, no job, and only one friend, Reg himself. Finally he had done the ultimate dropping out, ending his life at the age of 43. 

Amidst the maelstrom of grief, Reg kept coming back to the same question. Why kill yourself at 43 when 44 could be the year it finally all came together? Why walk out of the movie before the third act?

Reg missed him. He was a dour man, sure, but once he was done talking about his own problems he was a pretty good listener. He was also a great guy to watch a crappy dumb movie with. 

Not long after Pat did what he did, a publishing company got in touch, they wanted to publish one of his poems.With Reg’s help it was published posthumously. You just didn’t know what was around the corner.

It was a Sunday and Reg had nothing on. He intended today to be nice and relaxing. Lucy was out with her friends, at the Korean place in town. She was with her three besties and he knew they would eat Gochujang, and stay for hours, having drinks and catching each other up. 

He had the place to himself for the next few hours and he knew exactly what he would do. Listen to podcasts and finish his lego Death Star. He adored Lucy but it was nice to have some time to reflect on the week.

He had everything set up and ready to go when he hit a snag. Literally, there was something snagging on his cardigan sleeve. He carefully rolled back his sleeve and found the culprit, it was a hangnail, protruding from the left side of his left thumb. Irritating but nothing he couldn’t deal with. 

He had a system. He would fill a small dish with warm water and soak the nail to soften it. Then taking his trusty tweezers, he’d rip the bugger out. He prepared his surgical bay, placing the dish and tweezer on the arm of the couch. The whole thing shouldn’t take more than a few minutes, and soon he would be in his lego happy place.

His phone connected to a bluetooth speaker and the familiar jingle of the podcast intro rang out. It was his favourite, Pod People. It was dedicated to the dark side of life. True crime, cults, conspiracies and the like. 

This episode was dedicated to the terrifying case of Josef Frizel, who kept his daughter locked in a basement for 24 years, where he raped her and fathered children with her. He felt a twinge of guilt at listening to something like that but reassured himself that he wasn’t the only one, or the podcast wouldn’t be popular.

The hosts were two American friends, one Christian and the other into death metal. They had a running gag where the wholesome one would accuse the other of getting off on the macabre stories. Listening to it felt like being in the same room with some good friends. 

He set a timer on his watch and soaked his thumb, removing it after 2 minutes. He took the tweezers, the same ones he used to pluck his unibrow, and gripped the extruding end of the hangnail.

He winced at the pain he knew was coming. But it was necessary. A hangnail would seriously affect his dexterity when it came to building the movie accurate exhaust channels of the Death Star. The errant keratin would have to go. 

He braced himself and pulled. He felt the expected pain, saw the expected blood, but felt none of the expected relief. Dabbing away the blood he saw the hangnail was still attached, now jutting from the joint in his thumb. He paused, his mind working. This was a turn up for the books. He had never known a hangnail to extend this far and he examined it with fresh curiosity.

How was it even possible? Wasn’t the soil of a hangnail, so to speak, the nail bed? Could this be growing from some place deeper? The bone maybe? Thoughts of soil turned his attention to his garden. He looked out the living room window which gave a view of the back garden. 

It was a modest 5 by 7 metres with a small tool shed. He took particular pride in his roses. Scarlet Carsons. They were sleeping right now but he looked forward to spring when they would break free with their customary bold shade of red.

He wanted to turn his attention to happy things, lego, the garden, maybe a nice cup of tea, but the hangnail was now hogging all of it. The laughter of the podcast hosts grated on him and he realised he would not be able to really relax until He dealt with it. 

It was a hangnail, just a particularly long one, so the solution was the same, pull it out. It would be a funny story to tell Lucy when she got home. Perhaps he would even keep it and show it to her, though that would be cruel, as she didn’t like ghastly things.

He took the tweezers and started to pull. It was deeper than he expected and felt like ripping a cable from underground. All he could do was keep pulling, in a continuous motion, hoping that at any moment it would be torn free. He watched in confused horror as it kept going....showing no signs of reaching an end. Feeling light-headed and needing a break from the pain and exertion, he stopped, although the sought for relief was nowhere, the thing was still attached.

This was becoming...unacceptable. He felt sadness as he felt the prospect of an easy Sunday slipping away. The hangnail now emerged from the base of his thumb, at the place where his thumb met his hand. It was almost two inches in length. At a loss he decided to google it. Using one hand to work his phone while the other awaited its fate.

Google offered no salvation. People had hangnails that had to be surgically removed. There was also something called bone slivers but they only happened in serious accidents where the bone was shattered. He looked at the pictures with morbid fascination. They were horrifying but didn’t look like what was happening to him. 

While on the phone he got distracted and bought a book he didn’t need. He knew he was procrastinating and he had to deal with this before he coud return to his life. 

He grabbed the hangnail, it was long enough now that he didn’t need the tweezers and could use his other hand, and began to pull. The pain was...intimate. He felt like a robot that had gone crazy and was pulling out its own wires. 

The podcast hosts started to advertise a health drink. He didn’t want to let go of the nail so he couldn’t skip it which added to his torture. He had seen the drink on YouTube, it was green and looked like something you would give a sick cow.

He had to stop again and when he did the hangnail (if it could still be called that) was sticking out of his wrist. Just above the strap of his casio digital watch, which he removed. To his amazement he realised that he would actually have to remove his shirt as it still wasn’t over. 

He had to drag the sleeve over the hangnail and his fresh wound, causing a cruel jolt of pain. He threw the shirt aside. There was a wellspring of blood and the paper towel couldn’t cope, it was completely red with blood except for one white corner. He would need a towel.

He went to the hot press to get one. On the way he left red spots where his blood dropped on the living room carpet. He would be in trouble when Lucy found them. He found a white and red tea towel and wrapped it around his arm. 

He noticed how calm he was being but he knew he was like that, anxious most of the time but calm when the shit hit the fan. He sat back down on the couch, holding his hand in the towel like he was afraid it would fall off. The absurdity of the whole thing made him laugh.

He cleaned up the blood as best he could then used the towel to get extra purchase on the nail. In for a penny in for a pound. He started a new round of pulling. The uprooted nail dug a trench down his arm as he pulled it out. He screamed from the pain, which was like hot needles driven though his bone. He had to keep screaming to keep going. 

He wondered if the neighbours could hear. Norris, the man living next door, was a retired doctor. Rationally he knew he should be seeking medical help. Maybe it was some macho programming but he just wanted to take care of the nail himself without getting anyone else involved. The nail was now almost at the joint of his elbow, he could wrap it around his right hand to get a good grip. Doing so made him gag.

He took a second to rest and breath deeply. The thing was now almost at his shoulder. He could see the carnage he was wreaking on himself but he resisted his mind’s attempts to comprehend it, knowing it would probably steal all his conviction. Every single inch had been hard won, like ground in World War 1. With destroyed flesh the casualties.

He tried to pull again but this time the pain far outweighed any progress. He shifted it maybe a millimetre and was rewarded with an artillery shell of pain that hit his shoulder but sent shrapnel everywhere else. It also blasted away his resolve. 

I just need a second, he thought and leaned over face down on the couch. His nose was pressed against the cushion and he could smell the smell of the house. There was a faint hint of the curry he and Lucy had had last night.

Thinking of Lucy cut even deeper and he produced a little sob. When crying he never managed to get out more of a sob or two before something stopped him. That macho programming again. He’d give anything to be in her arms. Telling her about this rather than actually going through it. He thought of her coming home and finding him in this posture of defeat, and he hated it so he sat up.

Thoughts of defeat led to thoughts of capitulation. Maybe he and the nail could co-exist. He could cut it off at the shoulder, keep it covered under clothes and trim it every now and then. Maybe it wouldn’t be so bad. 

No, he drove out the thoughts. He couldn’t trust the nail. What if it wasn’t content with his flesh? What if one night as he slept it inched its way towards Lucy, searching for new lands to colonise. No, no peace. There was only room in his body for one of them.

His brain tuned back into the podcast. They were aughing at what that woman had gone through. How could they? He thought. Didn’t they know people were suffering?! Still he didn’t turn it off. Somehow he thought the silence would be worse. Just then he got the notion that running his arm under a cold tap would do the world of good, would cure him in fact.

He went into the kitchen and placed his arm under the tap. He looked at the water because he couldn’t bring himself to look at his arm. It ran red for much longer than he would have liked. He didn’t like that he was being afraid so he forced himself to look. What he saw made him throw up. It looked like he had shaken hands with a combine harvester.

He stood by the sink, the tap still running, washing away a rancid cocktail of vomit and blood. the taste of vomit in his mouth. It felt good to get it out of him but he knew he’d never feel right again until he got *it* out of him.

How long had it been in him, he wondered. Reg had always had a bad constitution, getting sick every flu season, tiring easily. Was it because this stowaway was there all along, taking the nutrients that were rightfully his to fuel its abominable growth? 

Reg’s curiosity was enflamed. How far did the thing go? He would find out, even if it killed him. He turned off the tap and dried himself with a mostly clean tea towel. The one he had gotten previously lay on the counter, soaked with blood and useless. He hated to think about how much flesh he had lost and how much more he would lose before the day was over.

To ensure victory he would need better weaponry. His thoughts turned to the garden shed where he kept his DIY stuff. His mind was filled with images from an old movie. In it the character loses his hand, then goes to the toolshed and with a few adjustments transforms himself into a killing machine with a chainsaw for a hand. He thought a chainsaw would be overkill but he still liked the imagery.

“You’ve got a big surprise coming to you” he said to the hangnail. It was approaching 2 feet in length. It had a stiffness to it and bobbed alongside his arm like a sinister erection. Just looking at it made his stomach lurch. He went to the backdoor and put on his coat and boots to go outside. 

Blood from his arm stuck to the lining inside the coat and the numbness in his left hand made lacing his boots difficult. It overcast outside, Mid-December in Ireland. Despite human attempts to derail it, Nature was keeping to her schedule and had made it chilly.

On his way to the shed he stopped by the rosebed. There was nothing to see and he wondered if he’d be alive to see his beloved roses bloom. He opened the door to the shed, or armory as he thought of it. He took his red toolbox from a shelf and placed it on the worktop. He rummaged around for the pliers, feeling a sadistic pleasure thinking of what he could do to the hangnail.

Then his eyes landed on something that stopped him searching and made him grin. In the centre of the worktop was a vice. What better tool to hold the damned thing in place while he ripped it out of him.

Knowing he would lose his nerve if he hesitated he guided the hangnail into the jaws of the vice and turned the wheel. The nail was thin so he had to turn the wheel all the way to clamp it in place. 

He realised the best thing to do was to sling the hangnail over his shoulder and turn away from the vice. That way when he moved forward he could rip it out. The shed was small and he was able to reach out and get the fingers of his right hand around the door handle. He was glad at how secure it felt.

He was atheist except for the most dire occasions and he mentally whispered a prayer. “Please God, let most of me be intact.”He pulled himself forward. The nail bit into him and scared it might re-enter him that way he found an old sheet used for painting, folded it into a kind of belt and placed it under the nail. 

He dragged himself forward again. It felt unnatural to cause himself so much pain, like asking a maniac to stab him in the chest.

Gouts of blood splashed onto the ground. With the nail slung over his shoulder he was reminded of the Strongman competitions he used to watch with his father and brother when he was a boy. He didn’t care much for sports but they had enough of the freak show to be fun. He thought now of those mountains of men, dragging train cars behind them. In their teeth he seemed to remember but that couldn’t be right.

“I’m weak, I can’t do it, I’m weak, I can’t do it.” He thought. Yet he was doing it. His mind was useless in this situation. It was only his will that mattered. He assessed the damage, there was a meaty canyon extending from his shoulder to his left nipple. He couldn’t actually see his nipple which might have been in laying with the blood on the ground. Oh well, he thought, I wasn’t using it anyway. The nail looked stronger than ever, its base an inch across and slightly concave. It had some nerve, acting like it was a normal part of his anatomy!

It was obvious where the final showdown would be. His heart. The soil where it gorged itself on his blood. Its roots like a cage around his heart. 

He kept pulling forward. It was like the nail was bonded to him at the molecular level and ripping it out split the atom, triggering atomic explosions of pain. He kept pulling himself forward. In for a penny...

His consciousness wavered and he held onto the door handle as much to keep himself awake as upright. His body begged for a chance to shut down. He didn’t have to look to know the hangnail was now coming straight from his heart, like a knife left by an unfaithful lover. It was only when he stopped screaming that he realised he had been. Somewhere in the distance he heard a lawnmower. That’s right. It was Sunday. Lazy Sunday.

His chest was almost level with the door now. So he opened it and let himself fall to the ground. As he fell he heard something snap as one of the nails moorings broke. The pain was like a point blank gunshot but he didn’t care, it was his first taste of freedom.

He could feel a puddle of blood underneath him, like taking a hot bath in the November air. This was the heart blood, life’s blood. He could feel the satanic claw of the nail loosen its grip. He didn’t care if it killed him, as long as he died free. 

He resumed pulling, and screaming. He was grateful for the money he had spent on the vice, which prior to now had mostly been used to crack walnuts. He grabbed handfuls of dirt and grass and dragged himself forward with strength that must have been drawn from the earth itself. He was numb to the pain, numb to the damage he was inflicting on himself, deaf to his own screams, he just wanted it gone…

He awoke and knew it was over. It was gone. He felt empty. Like a gutted fish. He could feel wind howling in the empty spaces inside himself where the nail had been. But it was gone. 

In a panic he looked around to check where it was. He didn’t want it to crawl back inside him. He didn’t think he could face another round. It lay in a black circle of blood soaked earth. It looked desiccated, like a dead spider. Looked dead, but he didn’t trust that. The base of it, where it had infiltrated his heart, looked like a mockery of a heart made out of twisted thorns.

He looked down at his chest and saw the sheet he had used had been remade as a bandage to cover the gaping wound. It was soaked through red. Although he could still see the little flakes of white paint. The part near his heart was crumpled up and looked just like a rose. 

That’s when he noticed there were arms around him. Lucy? No, they were a man's arms. White and strewn with freckles. They held him up in a sitting position. The owner of the arms spoke and it was Norris, his next door neighbour who must have come when he heard screaming.

“You’re awake.”

“Yes.” He answered weakly.

“What happened? Was it an accident with one of the tools?”

He must have seen the trail of blood from the shed to Reg’s resting place.

“No, a hangnail.”

Norris laughed.

“Yeah, right.” Norris said.

Reg gestured to the remains of the hangnail.

“What is it, some kind of root?” Norris asked.

“Some kind,” Reg answered.

“We need to get you inside where it’s warm.” Norris said, sounding concerned.

“No,” Reg said firmly. “First we get rid of it.”

“Okay, what would you like me to do with it?”

Reg wasn’t sure if Norris was just humoring him. But it didn’t matter as long as they did what was necessary.

“The compost bin,” Reg said, pointing to the end of the garden where there was a large black rectangular bin.

“Right,” Norris said, gently lowering Reg down. Reg continued to watch him, using a herculean effort to keep his head raised. Norris reached for the hangnail.

“No!” Reg shouted. “For God’s sake don’t touch it.” The thing could just be playing dead. 

“Go to the shed,” Reg instructed him, “there’s another sheet. You can use it to wrap it up. Carefully.”

The urgency of Reg’s tone must have gotten through to him and Reg was glad to see Norris now approached the nail with proper caution. Taking the sheet he gingerly wrapped it while being careful not to touch it himself. Norris took the mummified form over to the compost bin and lifted the lid. Reg watched him so closely that Norris could feel his eyes on him. 

Reg took composting seriously and the compost bin was big, about half the size of a skip. Layers of decaying matter would be left there for months until they turned into a rich fertiliser that was destined for Reg’s beloved rose bed. It would make a good tomb for his foe.

Norris dropped the nail inside.

“Close the lid”, Reg said.

Norris came back over to Reg. Swiping his hands together to signify a job well done. He helped Reg to his feet and carried him wounded soldier style back into the welcoming warmth of the living room. With a great delicacy he managed to get him onto the couch with only minimal agony. 

The couch, where the whole nightmare had begun, what seemed like an eternity ago. The podcast was still going but had moved on to another episode, this one about the Heaven’s Gate cult. He knew all about it but still he let it play.

“Where do you keep your bandages, Reg?”

“Upstairs bathroom, medicine cabinet.”

Norris had been in his house before and knew his way around. He had been over several times for a cup of tea. (he was the generation of Irish person where this was simply expected) He got to work and Reg could tell he felt much happier in the familiar territory of helping a patient, rather than whatever the hell had been happening with that strange root...

Reg had never thought highly of Norris, he had always seemed a bit aloof. He was a canny businessman as well as a doctor. He had purchased a floundering medical journal, restored it to glory and then sold it on for a phenomenal profit. Although they exchanged the usual neighbourly banter there was no disguising the fact Norris’s house was twice the size of Reg’s and he even had a Koi pond.

Clearly he had misjudged him because here he was, helping him in his time of need. You never knew who would be there for you. It was mid-way through these reflections that Reg passed out again.

He awoke to the sound of gentle mirth and clinking spoons from the kitchen. Lucy was home. The knowledge of that flooded him like a powerful tranquilizer. The haphazard dressing on his chest had given way to more expert bandaging. Norris’s handiwork. It was dark out. He checked his watch. He’d been out for 4 hours. 

The podcast was silent. Lucy didn’t like it, called the hosts as “cackling ghouls”. There was a steaming hot mug on the coffee table. He picked it up, the small movement was like doing the last rep at the gym but he was rewarded with a soothing sip of tea. Ah, tea, nectar of the gods.

“Hello”, he called out, announcing his presence.

Lucy entered the room. He blinked away tears and held out his arms, feeling like Karloff’s The Mummy. She hugged him tightly and he yelped.

“Sorry,” she said, and embraced him more gently.

“It’s okay.”

Tears stung his eyes as he gave in to the feeling of being looked after.

“How did you know I’d be awake?” He said, glancing at the tea.

“I didn’t, I just kept making them. That’s the fifteenth one. I wanted you to have something hot when you woke up.”

“Oh, I do,” he said, winking.

She shook him gently and he felt waves of pain emanating from his track of wounds.

“Ow.”

“Do you think you’re in a fit state to make those comments?”

“I am,” he said smiling.

“Why didn’t you call me?” She asked, becoming serious.

“I don’t know.” And he didn’t. Why not enlist her help in battle? She was his greatest ally after all.

“Silly man,” she said and leaned in for a kiss. Norris entered with impeccable timing. He held a cup of tea and wore a friendly smile. Lucy pulled away.

“Ah you’re awake.” He said. “How are those bandages holding up?”

He came over to Reg and started expertly tugging at the bandages. He seemed satisfied. He entered Doctor mode:

“I’ll be back tomorrow to change them. The ones on your arm aren’t that serious, it’s your chest I’d be worried about. You should really go to A and E.”

Reg shook his head. The Irish healthcare system was a complete shambles. Unless you were actually knocking down death’s door you’d be waiting 10 hours to be seen. In a cold waiting room with fluorescent lights, surrounded by strangers. He didn’t fancy it.

“I’ll take my chances”, he said. “I have a good nurse.”

“Suit yourself.” Norris said, shrugging. “Make sure you get plenty of rest and drink plenty of fluids.”

“You patched up my wounded soldier,” Lucy said to Norris. “How will I ever repay you?”

“Don’t worry,” he said, “the tea and biscuits should cover it.”

And you have enough money already, Reg thought and felt bad for thinking it. Money or not he was obviously a caring man. Feeling deep gratitude, Reg held out his hand to Norris who accepted it.

“Thank you,” Reg said.

“Not at all.”

“So,” Lucy said, “Norris said this was all caused by a hangnail? Is that right?”

“That’s right,” Reg said.

Lucy was incredulous.

“It’s true,” Norris said. “I saw it myself. It was...” He struggled to convey it. “One for the books.” This gave him an idea. “In fact, it would make a hell of an entry in the journal. Of course, I’d just have to take some pictures...”

“No,” Reg said adamantly, “no one goes near it.”

Norris retreated. “You’re the boss,” he said. “Well, the wife has been sending me texts. She’s ready to send out search and rescue. I better be off. Thanks for the tea, Lucy. Reg, mind yourself. No more life and death battles, for a while at least.”

“Understood,” Reg said.

Norris left by the front door, exchanging a string of goodbyes with Lucy as he went. With Norris out of the way Lucy gave him his deferred kiss. It too was one for the books and made the whole day of fighting seem worth it. She helped him up the stairs which had somehow transformed into Kilimanjaro. 

He got into bed with her, something that never failed to make him giddy, despite the 5 years they had been together. Under the covers, she began to talk to him in the conspiratorial whisper he knew well.

“Reg, hun, was it really a hangnail?”

“Yes,” he said, feeling indignant.

“But how did it get so big?”

“Beats me.”

There was a silence into which he felt like interjecting lots of things, but they all felt impolite. Finally he found what he wanted to say. “You believe me don’t you, Luce?”

Whether she did or not she chose to. “Yes, hun,” she said, and gave him an affirming kiss on the head.

She went to sleep quickly, as was her way, and he was left with the pain which was like a chorus of voices, vying for his attention. “Remember me?” They seemed to say. He found by resting his head against Lucy’s chest he could quiet them, and like this he slept.

It was March. A Sunday. Reg had taken the last 3 months off as sick leave but was scheduled to return Tomorrow. He looked forward to the return of normalcy. He stood in the living room, hot cup of tea in hand. 

The blood stains in the carpet had long since been cleaned. Lucy had put up a show of complaining but he suspected she was glad it wasn’t the outline of his body she was cleaning.

He felt like a new man after getting the nail out. There was a spring in his step and some days he felt 25 rather than the 45 he was. He guessed not having an unwelcome passenger siphoning his lifeforce would do that. 

He had finished the lego Death Star and a number of other builds as well. Including Mt. Doom from Lord of the Rings which was over 7,000 pieces. 

People asked him what his secret was and he felt like telling them it was buried in the back garden. He looked out at the rose bed. He was delighted to see small green dots that showed they were starting to bud. Lucy had been applying fresh compost during his convalescence and it had done its job. He marvelled at nature, its resilience and immortality.

He noticed something else sticking out of the soil, whitish grey, and curved like a banana. A piece of trash that had blown over the wall he assumed. He went outside to pick it up. He wanted his roses pristine. His heart froze when he saw what it really was. The nail. Alive and about the thickness of his wrist, it extended about a foot from the soil and pointed at him threateningly.

Well, he thought, going to the shed to retrieve a trowel, in for a penny in for a pound.
