I live in Smeaton, Australia. A small, rural Victorian town you’ve probably never heard of. And I mean small. Population maybe 250 if that. Don’t get me wrong, I like it that way. Peace and quiet. Well, that’s why I moved here anyway. I'm not sure about that now.

See, ever since I bought my home out here, I’ve been experiencing some strange happenings. My house sits near a small valley drop off which leads down to a creek. I promise, that's relevant to the scene here. See about a week after I moved in, I looked out the window to see a trail. A trail that was definitely not there before. It went straight up the valley, as if something had walked through there and stopped right at the top. Right outside the fence line separating my house from the valley drop-off. Things didn't stop there.

About a week later, I was up late at night, struggling to sleep. So, I resigned to make myself a cuppa and watch some late night movies. Some time during the night, I heard the sound of leaves rustling outside, out the window where I noticed that trail the previous week. I took a bit of a sneaky peak out the window and I saw someone running off down the drop off. Worried that vandals or maybe burglars were targeting my home, it was at this point I decided to keep a diary, just in case I might need a document of events to give to law enforcement later on. 

I’ll paste the diary below, and let you be the judge...



*3rd November: Happened again tonight. Almost asleep and I hear those footsteps running up the valley. Still not sure why whoever it is keeps coming up from that way. I know there’s a few local druggies that live across the creek. Maybe scoping my house?*



*12th November: They cut the fence this time. Woke up around 11pm to an enormous racket. Turned on the spotlight out the side to see the fence was cut straight through. Must have used bolt cutters. Whoever this is seems organised. Unsure why they would cut the fence and just leave? Maybe a show of force. Had a bolt put on the gate. Might have been just trying to prove a point, no bolts gonna stop them, ya know? Beginning to fear for my safety.*



*15th November: Woke up this morning to find my entire side fence line flattened. Cut straight down on either side. No idea why anyone would do this. Have reported to local law enforcement. Investigations underway.*



*18th November: Local druggies down the creek have been arrested on charges of property damage. Hopefully this brings an end to these visits.*



*23rd November: Window was smashed in last night. How I didn’t wake to the sound of it I don’t know. Side window, the one looking out over the drop off, very clearly smashed inwards, and what looks like scratch marks around it on the outside. Have reported to Police.*



*December 1st: Whatever is happening it’s not the druggies. They haven’t been back in town. This morning, woke to find footsteps in my yard. These are not normal. Too big. Have purchased a CCTV system. Hopefully get some real answers.*



*December 5th: Have moved out of the house. Further incidents ensued, prompting me to check the security footage. Have not reported anything further to law enforcement. Too bizarre. On two occasions, shadows could be seen just beyond the tree line. On final night spent in house, I witnessed something reach out from those trees. A long, spindly arm, followed by a tall figure, dragging itself out of the trees, up the valley and into my yard. From 11pm until 4am it just stood there, looking into my window occasionally. It would walk around my yard, occasionally shuffling its way up the front stairs and peering in through the windows. At times, more of its kind would lumber out from the trees and join it. It seemed as though they were waiting for something.*



That’s the end of my diary entries. Toward the end, it became very apparent to me that I was dealing with something not of this earth. The diary became less of a means to pursue any kind of legal action, and more of a record of my final days should anything happen to me.

No idea what exactly it was that I saw on those security recordings. It was clearly something we humans are not meant to witness. I know we’ve got some pretty frightening critters down here in the down under. Supernatural or otherwise. And I’m sure I saw something that fits into the former category.

Whatever it was, it wasn’t there to play. It was very clearly taunting me. And I’ve no doubt it woulda done a lot more than that, had I ever shown my face. As for why it never came into the house? I dunno. Maybe it did? There were those scratch marks up the wall the night my window was busted in. Maybe they were inside that night, and I never even knew it.

Scary stuff…
