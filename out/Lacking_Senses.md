Our footsteps tapped down the corridor with echoes. The silence was becoming unbearable, and all we could do was anxiously wait for the next attack.

I looked over to my right and saw Alex shaking as he gripped his rifle. He had only started relatively recently and had been showing me photos of his family before this. The guy that died earlier had been Spencer and while he had one of the biggest egos I’ve ever seen,  he still didn’t deserve what happened to him.

None of us should have been in this place, but we were the ones stupid enough to take this mission. It was no longer a 3 man job but a suicide mission.

I signaled a hand to halt and Alex stopped dead in his tracks. We both looked at each other and held our breaths as we looked into the dark examination room.

My heart skipped a beat every time I turned on my flashlight for fear of seeing one of those things again. I swung the light from left to right and didn’t hear a sound. I motioned for Alex to keep following.

“You sure you didn’t see any of those things?” asked Alex.

“Keep your finger on the trigger just in case,” I replied.

We stepped in and slowly made our way around examining the bodies of the dead scientists. All of them had nasty slash marks that cut deep into the flesh or had entire parts of limbs missing with shattered bone sticking out. We never saw what happened to Spencer, but deep down we knew it was probably this.

“Ok, room is secured. Just grab whatever files are here and let’s get the hell out. I’m tired of sitting around like a rat in a cage here,” said Alex.

I looked around for any sort of documents or leads while Alex shone his light on the entryway but found nothing like all the other rooms.

I looked back over at Alex, but he wasn’t looking at me. I realized what he was staring at and whipped my rifle around and laid as many shots as I could into the flesh creature behind me. The being almost looked human but it was lacking any facial features and its head was a misshapen spear. I fired just enough shots to stun it and keep its clawed hands away from me. 

“Go!” I shouted.

Alex didn’t need to think twice about that and sprinted past me as we ran down the hall as we occasionally turned around and fired. We sprayed our shots down the hallway but were only able to take down maybe one or two with each clip. There was an entire hoard of them, and we could only fend off against 1 or 2 at a time before they almost grabbed us. 

Pure terror seized me as I watched Alex’s body suddenly fly into the air. He screamed as one of the creatures had pulled him into an overhead vent. 

“Help me it’s got a hold of me!” screamed Alex.

I aimed my rifle up at the vent, but by the time I did I saw Alex’s feet slide in. I cursed to myself and unloaded another clip into one of the creatures two feet away from me before taking off into a sprint. 

I felt every ragged breath as I sprinted but felt almost weightless even with the equipment on me due to the adrenaline. I rounded a corner and kicked one of the creatures that popped out of a side vent. I saw a large open door and squeezed in as the horde rose behind me. 

I just managed to close the door as a claw scratched against my cheek and drew blood. I winced from the sting and took a deep breath in my moment of rest. 

I saw a person rise from a desk and pointed my gun at them. I saw that it was one of the scientists and that he was alive.

“Put your hands in the air and don’t move!” I shouted.

The man obeyed and put his hands above his head.

“Care to tell me what you guys were doing here?” I asked.

“They’re beautiful…” the man said.

“What, the monsters out there?” I asked.

“I truly envy them. They feel none of the five senses. They never have to feel pain. They just are,” he said.

“How do they get around then? If they can’t feel anything?” I asked.

The man just broke into a long and hard laugh as he gripped his hair and stared at the ground. I tried to drag him out of there but he refused to move so I left him. I found an emergency exit on the second level of the room and sprinted through corridor after corridor until I found a ladder that led to an exit. I could hear footsteps tailing behind me as I scrambled up the rungs. 

As I stared at the empty desert before me I felt no sense of happiness or accomplishment. It was only a matter of time before these things escaped the facility and made it to civilization. By the time everyone realizes it will be too late. Even though they can’t feel anything they have some way of finding you.
