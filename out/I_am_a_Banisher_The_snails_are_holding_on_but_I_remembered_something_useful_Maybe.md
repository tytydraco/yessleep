Didn’t plan to post again so soon after the [events yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1o1hfpi/i_am_a_banisher_and_the_snails_followed_me_home_i/), but I am still at a loss. It’s been another full day since the snails showed up, and the little bastards just keep coming.

I don’t think there’s anything inherently creepy about snails, as such. It’s just really odd to keep finding them around the apartment, y’know, *five floors up*. It’s not like they can hurt me, or at least they haven’t tried? I figure I’d win in a fight against a snail anyway, in case they were to try something funny.

And I guess that’s the thing: So far, it seems they are just normal-ass snails. They do… what I would call snail things. Go in a direction with their mouth-bodies tasting the surface, leaving a thin trail of slime behind them that dries into a flaky, white substance. Mildly disgusting, but not worse than other stuff I’ve had to deal with over the years. 

Except for the whole, appearing-everywhere thing. It is getting to me, a little. I don’t know why. I turn around, and WHAM! Snail. I turn back, oh look, another snail. There’s not an overwhelming amount of them, but enough to make it feel uncanny.

At first, I was terrified of hurting them in any way. I felt a little bad for the little fellows. Imagined this is probably just as weird for them as it is for me. I put the first few snails I found in the sink yesterday into a bowl and brought them outside.

Didn’t matter. Within an hour, there were just… more. More snails. Different shells and sizes, and in the weirdest places. One with a yellow shell was sitting confidently on the light switch to my bedroom, face peeked. Another was making spirals around the bathroom mirror. 

I’ve done everything I can think of. Salt lines, iron, burnt herbs. I even double and triple checked the plumbing with the help of Dr Google, just to make sure they weren’t coming up from the drains. I kept the windows shut, and except for letting the little suckers outside, I haven’t left the apartment. I’ve also checked the corridor, the elevator and the stairway, just in case. No sign of entry, as far as I am concerned.

I can’t sense the tether, either. Not as strongly, at least, if I feel anything at all. I didn’t sleep well, so that could be why I guess. The idea of waking up to snails on me makes me *very* uncomfortable. I did try to force a quick nap on the couch about an hour ago, and that’s why I’m back here I guess. 

As I sat up, I heard the all-too familiar crunch of shells breaking open beneath my foot, and felt the snail…. guts (?) spilling out between the cracks, sticking to my sock.

As I inspected my foot, the sound kept playing back to me in my head. That unholy crunch, smothered by soft meat and wetness. 

The sound, and the unmistakable smell of moss in my apartment, brought me right back to my childhood, and the reason why I became interested in the supernatural and occult to begin with. I really don’t like talking about it and I am pretty sure at least two separate therapists have told me specifically *not* to (I tend to obsess over things a little), but until I find one of you to help me figure this crap out; I’ve nothing better to do than stare at snails, which is about as boring as it sounds. So let’s do it. Let’s *talk*.

When I was eight, I still had a twin. There is no better way to word that. 

Gustav was the kind of kid who always wanted things to *mean* something. Found faces in the clouds and thought scratches on trees were messages from the fairies. That kind of stuff. He was the leader, I the follower. He always came up with, or heard of, new games for us to play. Usually strange and or very creative ones. 

Our parents were not on great terms that summer, so we spent a larger portion of it in our grandparents’ house. Red wood paneling, white edging, right in the depths of the Swedish woods. Isolated and quiet, but in a cozy and dare I say magical way. There was just nature; rocks of varying sizes, bigger than we ever saw in the city, and pine trees older than grandpa, or so he’d say. The forest had piles of stones, rings of flowers, and all things just the right amount of mythical.

After a splendid day of fishing in the river and playing soccer on the lawn, bellies full of raspberry squash and sugar covered strawberries, my brother said he had a new game for us to play. He called it “The Forest of the Lost Things”.

According to him, it was definitely a real place between places. If you followed the rules of the game exactly, you would get to peek into where everything that had ever been misplaced, anywhere in the world, had ended up. He swore up and down that that’s where my Game Boy would be, as well as all the missing socks from the drier, and the neighbours cat that had disappeared the year before. If we timed it right, we might even see the people who never came home.

That scared me, a little. My brother with a whole four-minute advance in age seemed very confident, though, so I didn’t let it show. Part of me thought it would be very *cool* to see all of the lost things, tried to imagine what that would look like. Wanted to believe, probably.

The rules were simple enough: You needed at least two people, preferably twins. Then, go to the treeline, where the deep woods start, right at sunset. You needed to shut your eyes, tightly, and hold your partner’s hand. You then needed to spin five times clockwise while chanting “I am here to see The Forest of the Lost Things”, without letting go of the other person’s hand. You were not allowed to open your eyes at any point while spinning, either. This was of *utmost* importance. 

I figured it was just a fun thing to do. Kids both there and back home had their own versions of this. Chant “Bloody Mary” three times into a mirror in an unlit room, knock on the church door at midnight, whisper your crush’s name into the well. Lots of myths, most tried and nothing happened. This wouldn’t be different, but there’s excitement in the *what if.*

So, we did everything exactly as he said. 

When the summer sun dipped below the treeline, we snuck out. Everything was bathed in oranges and pinks, the kind of light that makes everything seem dreamlike, unreal. The air was still warm, but the dew settling on the ground told us it was getting colder. I remember the way the trees looked, ancient and tall, with their shadows stretching long toward us as we stood, hand in hand, below them. 

We closed our eyes, and started spinning. Five times, clockwise. 

The first two turns were full of giggles, both from playing our silly little game but also from the excitement of being able to sneak out like this, in what to us was basically the middle of the night, and not get caught. Our worn sneakers scuffed against the dry ground.

I could still hear Gustav chanting the rhyme until we began our third spin, then it faded. The air got colder. By the start of the fourth, the ground under my feet felt damp, and a cold drop of water hit my cheek, even though the sky had been clear just a few moments before.

By the fifth, I was freezing, and the world was completely silent. I could only hear the sound of my own breath, and feel nothing but the weight of Gustav’s hand in mine. 

Then, we were running. 

There was no… transition. Just this sudden awareness that, yes, we are moving, and pretty fast for two eight year olds. Branches slapped against my arms, and the smell of wet moss was thick in my throat. My eyes were still shut, or maybe it was too dark to tell. At the moment, nothing mattered but the movement. We *had* to keep moving, or *it* would get us. It was big, probably, and scary, and smelled like rot and moss and damp and it was *right behind us*. So, I ran. Faster, as fast as my short legs would let me. Gustav’s hand was there, warm and sweaty, in the palm of mine, until it wasn’t. I could still hear him pant right behind me, though, so I kept going. I didn’t look back.

The world around us was still entirely silent. Just our panting, heavy and wet, and the sound of our soles hitting the ground below, something both soft and hard breaking below them. Wet cracks with every step, something *squishing* under my feet. I couldn’t see, couldn’t feel it, but I could *hear* it. The same damn sound as today, like stepping on a field of small, fragile bones. 

I knew it was right behind us, still. I could feel its breath on my neck. Each breath felt as if I had already swallowed it by the time it left my mouth, hard and heavy, and I was *so scared*. 

It was getting closer, and closer, until it was impossibly close. Right there, or inside of me, or everywhere outside of me. I was enveloped, slowed, the quiet forest about to claim me as its own.

Then, right as my legs gave out, a bright light. White, sharp, artificial. A flashlight cut through the trees somewhere, and I ran *straight* into it, full speed. At least that stopped me.

After that, it’s mostly fragments. I do not know how much of this is real or, y’know, whatever my brain decided to fill out the gaps with. I remember a red jacket, smell of chain smoking as a kind lady and a weathered old man stayed with me until the police came. 

They were carrying long metal sticks, for poking. I remember I thought that was odd at the time, the sticks. As time has gone on, I guess I know what they were for.

We had been missing for a total of two full days, even if I swear it felt like a few minutes to me. 

They never found Gustav. That was that, and life went on. 

I’ll reiterate: that fucking crunch is *unholy*. It’s also unmistakable that it’s the same crunch, but I do not know what that means. 

It just figures that if anything were to haunt me, it would be one of the least terrifying creatures of all time. 

Did anyone else ever hear about the game that Gustav and I played? I am pretty sure he made it up, as kids do, but I wouldn’t know. Maybe it’s a hint.

It’s been forty-five minutes and hell (or angry snails) hasn’t come raining down on me yet, so I figure crushing them didn’t seem to piss something, or them, off. I am leaning more and more towards these suckers just being normal snails.

Someone suggested pouring salt on them, or at least outside my house, and I figure I am not really above anything. To be fair they don’t seem to care about the salt in the doorway, but I will try to sneak some downstairs.  I’ve had these really intrusive thoughts of waking up to snails climbing on my eyeballs, and I really need to sleep.

I think that’s what I’ll do. I’ll text Henning, and then I’ll sleep. I am so tired.
