I’ve worked a lot of crappy jobs in my life, but nothing prepared me for what happened during my time as a security guard at Southlake Industrial Complex. It was a simple gig — or so I thought. My post was in a small guard shack near the warehouse’s entrance, where I’d sit through my shifts, mostly waving at the occasional truck driver or employee leaving late or processing a truck or two in and out. Nothing unusual ever happened during the day. But then I started working the second shift. 10 AM to 10 PM

It was a slow weeknight when it all began. I showed up around 10 AM, just as the day shift was starting. By 6, the place was practically deserted. The air was thick with that strange autumn stillness that only happens when the wind completely dies down, leaving everything eerily quiet. The sun was setting, casting long shadows that made the rows of warehouses seem like jagged teeth in a giant, open mouth. My shack was perched right by the entrance, facing out toward the road, with my back to the rows of empty warehouses.

The first night was uneventful. I passed the time by watching some videos on my phone, occasionally getting up to stretch or gaze out at the empty parking lot. Every now and then, a raccoon or stray cat would scurry past, breaking the silence. But nothing out of the ordinary.

That changed on the second night.

It was a little after 9PM when I first noticed something strange. I was leaning back in my chair, fighting off sleep, when I saw movement on the security monitor. The camera feed showed a stretch of the industrial park just beyond the closest warehouse — a place no one should be after hours. I leaned forward and squinted at the screen. There was definitely someone there, standing at the far end of the lot, just at the edge of the camera’s range.

I grabbed the radio and checked in with the other guard working on the far side of the park. His gruff voice crackled through the static. “Nah, man, I’m over by the loading docks. Haven’t seen anyone. Probably just a shadow.”

I wasn’t so sure.

The figure stayed in place for what felt like minutes, unmoving. It was too far to make out any features, just a dark shape in the distance. Then, in one quick movement, it disappeared from view, vanishing between the rows of warehouses.

I tried to shake it off, but something about the way it moved bothered me. It wasn’t normal — almost like it glided out of the camera's range. But I convinced myself it was a trick of the shadows and settled back into my chair, though I couldn’t stop glancing at the monitors.

A few hours passed, and I was starting to relax again when I heard a noise outside the shack. A tapping sound, faint but deliberate, like fingers drumming against the glass.

I froze, heart hammering in my chest. The shack was mostly windows, so I had a good view of the lot, but there was no one in sight. I stood up and opened the door, the cool night air rushing in. Nothing. I stepped outside, scanning the area, and called out, “Hello?”

No response. Just the low hum of the distant highway and the faint rustling of leaves.

I chalked it up to nerves and went back inside, locking the door behind me. But then it happened again. This time louder. More urgent. A series of quick, sharp taps on the window directly behind me.

I spun around. My stomach dropped. There, pressed against the glass, was a pale face, staring directly at me.

I stumbled backward, knocking over my chair as I fumbled for the radio. My hand was shaking so badly I couldn’t get a grip on it. The face just stayed there, watching me with wide, sunken eyes. Its mouth was open slightly, as if trying to speak, but no sound came out.

And then, just like that, it was gone.

I didn’t waste any time. I grabbed the radio and called the other guard, my voice trembling. “There’s someone here. At the shack. I…I don’t know what the hell it is, but I need backup.”

He arrived within minutes, but by the time he got there, the face had disappeared, leaving no trace. We searched the area together, but there was no sign of anyone. I tried to explain what I saw, but I could tell he didn’t believe me.

“Probably just some kids messing around,” he said, though his voice lacked conviction. He left me to finish the shift alone, promising to send a report up the chain.

I couldn’t focus for the rest of the night. I kept staring at the monitors, half expecting the face to appear again. But it didn’t.

The next few nights were quiet, though I couldn’t shake the feeling of being watched. Every creak, every gust of wind, set me on edge. I thought about quitting, but I needed the money, and part of me was convinced it was all just in my head.

That is, until the last night.

It was just after 8 when I heard the tapping again. This time, it wasn’t just faint. It was insistent, rapid, like someone was frantically trying to get my attention. I didn’t want to look. My instincts screamed at me to keep my eyes down, to pretend I didn’t hear it. But I couldn’t.

I slowly turned around, and there it was again. The same pale face, but closer this time, pressed harder against the glass. Its eyes were wider, more desperate, and its mouth gaped open in a silent scream. But it wasn’t alone.

Behind it, dozens of shadowy figures stood in the parking lot, all facing the shack, unmoving, watching me. I felt the cold seep into my bones, a paralyzing fear that kept me glued to the spot.

And then they moved — not like people, but like shadows, gliding toward the shack, closing the distance impossibly fast. I could hear the sound of tapping growing louder, more frantic, coming from every direction.

I didn’t wait to see what would happen next. I bolted out of the shack, running as fast as I could toward the parking lot. As I glanced back, I saw the figures standing at the edge of the light, watching, waiting.

I never went back after that. I quit the next morning without even collecting my things. The company called me, asking if I wanted my last paycheck. I didn’t care.

Some things just aren’t worth sticking around for.
