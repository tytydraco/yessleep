I'm Kate, and ever since I checked into this hotel, everything in my life has spiraled out of control. I've revisited and updated some old blog posts to provide context, hoping they will guide you to understand my current nightmare. Perhaps you can offer insight or spot something I've overlooked. Or better yet, take my warning, and steer clear of this hotel at all costs.
——————————————————
Hello! I'm thrilled to share that I've started a new blog, just a little practice, as I embark on an exciting journey to a new apartment in Saint Louis. The place I'm moving into is actually an old hotel, which means there will be plenty of activity around. But the lady over the phone said most of the permanent residents are older folks, so I’m anticipating a peaceful atmosphere that I can really enjoy. I'm also starting anew in the big city, and hey that’s really exciting. I’m a writer but I don’t know, being away from my family is hard and they’re all scattered around that area. Maybe the culture out there will inspire my writing, in a bizarre way. Right now, I'm busy packing for my flight, and I can't wait to get there. I’ll probably get some more writing in while I’m in the air.

Navigating the airport was quite the ordeal, but when is it ever smooth sailing? TSA can be a pain in the ass, and everything seems overpriced, but we made it onto the plane, which is a win. I treated myself to a delicious bean paste bun and listened to a true crime podcast while waiting to board. The flight will take a few hours, so I brought a neck pillow and might catch some sleep, but I wanted to make sure to write a little something.

It felt like an eternity waiting for my luggage, does that ever happen to you too? I really dislike the moving process, even though I'm excited about my new job. It can just be so overwhelming. Right now, I'm in the car heading to my new home. It’s getting late, so I’ll probably head straight to my room and get some much needed rest.

I got to the building, it had a big neon that read “Meadow Hills Resort.” It flickered, makes sense for its old age. I have to stay excited, right? I got my suitcases through the street, it was hard though, there was three of them packed with clothes and whatever else I could take on the plane. When I walked in I was greeted by an old woman, I think it was the woman I talked to on the phone about renting a place. She said the building still functioned as a hotel but it wasn’t as popular as it used to be so they were transitioning towards being apartments. 

The woman exuded warmth, her voice soft but slightly raspy. Her grey curls framed her face, cascading around her ears and resting gently on her neck. She wore a charming blue blouse with white polka dots, a flowery lace collar. Her long, matte black skirt brushed her ankles, and she stood confidently in high-heeled shoes that added a good amount of height.

“Hello, dear! Here to check in for a room?” she greeted as I entered.

“Um, no ma’am, we spoke on the phone. I’m Kate,” I replied.

“Who, dear?” she asked, a hint of confusion in her eyes.

“Kate, the new tenant.”

“Ah!” she exclaimed, as if a light bulb had gone off. “I remember now! You’re renting room seventeen…” Her voice trailed off, as if she were lost in thought. It was endearing, though I wondered about her memory. The hallways felt a bit eerie, with their checkered black and white floors and nauseating yellow-striped walls.

She led me to my room, where I began to settle in. The space was already furnished, typical of a hotel, but she mentioned I could redecorate if I planned to stay for a while. By “a while,” I suspected she meant permanently, but at my age, I wasn’t ready to commit just yet. The room itself wasn’t too bad though, the furniture was rather unattractive, but it did come with a small oven and stovetop, plus there was a laundromat conveniently located in the building. I think I might just enjoy it here.

Bored, I decided I should explore through the corridors of the building, plus figure I should get familiar with this maze of a building. But then my eyes fell upon an enormous painting that sat in the hallway. It depicted a man in colonial attire. He was captured in the act of signing a document, his quill poised delicately above the parchment. Yet, something sent a shiver down my spine, a shadow lurking in the background, an ominous presence that seemed to loom over him as he wrote. This shadow, unsettlingly created this , it bore an uncanny shape, thin and elongated.

As I examined the painting, a neighbor emerged from her doorway, her gaze piercing through the dim light. She was an elderly woman, her attire similar to the receptionist's, and her voice carried a gentle tone. “Staying at the hotel for a night, dear?” Her smile was a warm, inviting a glow into the dark corridor. “Oh no, I’m a new tenant,” I replied, returning her smile. She shuffled closer, her frail frame stood right next to me, her eyes fixated on the artwork.

“Um, who is that?” I asked, my curiosity gnawing at me. “He bought the land. In a way I suppose, he’s the founder of The Hotel,” she replied, her words felt shallow somehow, hollow. I felt a shiver crawl up my spine, but I still had questions about the painting. “Did he build it?” She turned her gaze toward me, her eyes nearly swallowed by the deep creases of her skin, a sight that for some reason, made my heart race. “No. He built a house. Died in it.”

I shifted my focus back to the painting, a creeping unease settling in my gut. Her unwavering stare bore into me, why’d she keep staring at me? “What about the shadow?” I pointed at the ominous figure lurking in the artwork, a presence that created a feeling of discomfort that I felt in her company. She fell silent, her attention drifting to the open door of her apartment. “Wait— how do you know all of this?” She locked eyes with me once more, and in that fleeting moment, she seemed to pulse with life. Then she walked steadily, retreating into her apartment and the door closed. I’d remember the numbers on her door, “92.”

This was the very beginning of my current predicament. The rest of this day was a lot of nothing so I deleted a lot of those sections, after that I went back to my room, moved some furniture around and then went to bed. The next day was also a lot of nothing, I unpacked my suitcases into the dressers and explored around the city. The streets were rich with culture, a bit of a depressing place in some areas but there was a lot that inspired my writing. I got back to the hotel and the lady at the desk wasn’t there. I peeked around the lobby room to see if she was busy doing something but I didn’t see her anywhere. 

I brushed it off, retreating to my room for some peace, but that’s when the whispers began. As I settled in, ideas for my writing swirling in my mind, an unsettling murmur crept through the floorboards. Initially, I dismissed it as a neighbor’s television, yet the whispers grew clearer, echoing from beneath me. Straining to listen, I caught a fragment of what they were saying, “part of the family.” Those words have lived in the back of my mind rent free ever since, and I couldn’t shake the feeling that they were directed at me.

I approached the front desk, where the usual attendant sat absorbed in a book. Her demeanor had shifted, the warmth from our last encounter was replaced by a sharp edge. “Need some help with something dear?” she asked, her tone laced with irritation. I hesitated, then asked, “Do we have a basement?” Her eyes narrowed, surprise flickering across her face. “No dear, we don’t have a basement. Why do you ask?” I swallowed my shock and pressed on, “Who’s the lady in room ninety-two?” Her irritation deepened, “My sister, Mabel. She’s a sweet ol’ gal, lil’ older than me.” I turned, curiosity gnawing at me. “Is this building..family owned?” She nodded, “Yup, since its birth.” My mind drifted to the eerie painting in the hallway. “So you’re related to the guy in the painting?” I asked. “Yes, that was my great-great grandfather. Cornelius.” I hesitated, then asked, “If your grandfather is the man in the painting, do you know whose shadow stands over him?” She chuckled, a sound devoid of warmth, “It’s just a painting dear.” The folds of her skin stretched into a disturbing smile that wasn’t at all comforting. A chill crept over me as I thought of their responses, it rubbed the wrong way, I didn’t want to probe anymore.  

I left the hotel, kind of freaked out, and dialed my mom, inviting her for tea, hoping to find comfort in familiar warmth. I have some things I need to get done but I promise to share those logs as soon as I can.
