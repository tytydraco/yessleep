Before I begin, I need to clarify a few things. When I first attempted to put this story on paper, I tried to hide as much information as possible for the sake of privacy and... well… safety. Unfortunately, I quickly realized that this is not always possible. To put some events into context, I had to put some important information here and there. For this reason, I can't be sure that it's completely impossible to track the places I will be describing based on that. I'll be as blunt as possible - don't look for them. I can’t overstate this enough. Don’t get me wrong, you probably won’t find anything anyway. Hell, you might even find out that there are some inconsistencies between my descriptions and what you find. And in that case, good for you. The last thing I want is to put anyone else in danger. Treat this story as a warning and nothing else.

The following is an excerpt from a paranormal forum post I made in 2015. Yes, I was using forum boards in 2015. For the record I was sixteen when I made it. There are age discrepancies in the post – ignore those if you can. I was lying about my age constantly back then, because after all, who would ever treat a kid seriously, right? The event I was describing was actually the thing that got me interested in the supernatural in the first place. It went as follows:

*\[…\] the story I want to tell begins in Croatia. No, I’m not Croatian, I’m actually Polish. It’s just that back when I was a kid in primary school, no older than eight, my parents would spoil me with foreign trips. A lot of them in fact; two or three times a year was the bare minimum. In my twenty years on earth I visited Slovakia, Czech Republic, Turkey, Italy, Spain and of course Croatia – the crowning jewel of our travels. I mean it. It’s a wonderful country. Almost worth the eleven hour drive. This was my second trip there.*

*We started our journey at around 6PM in Subcarpathia and were heading to Pakoštane (that’s in the very far west of Croatia, right off the coast). We didn’t have a GPS back then; they were pretty rare. So it was my dad behind the wheel, my mom holding the map and little shit me in the back watching cartoons on a car DVD (anyone remember those?). In retrospect I pity my father. He was too good for this world. Poor guy couldn’t even turn on the radio, just so I could watch my pirated cartoons in peace. But I suppose that was kind of the ultimatum of the situation – you either have to listen to the crappy animated movie audio for eleven hours or me crying about being bored. It’s the textbook definition of the lesser of two evils. Now, the reason I’m telling you this is because I want to make it absolutely clear that I’m physically unable to fall asleep in a car. I still can’t bring myself to do it, even though it would be really convenient sometimes. It’s probably about the combination of the constant shaking and sitting without the ability to change position. Also our Daewoo Nubira’s seats were hard as bricks. If there is anything else I remember from that trip, it was my ass feeling numb afterwards. But I digress. The point is that I need to occupy myself somehow, and cartoons just happen to make for a great anchor in the waking world. If at any point I lose track of the plot, if I need to rewind just to see that I don’t remember seeing a certain scene, chances are I was asleep. And that night I certainly wasn’t.*

*It was somewhere between 2AM and 4AM. The sky was clear and the moon was full. The stretch of road around us was completely desolate. Not just of cars; I mean the overall surroundings. We were in the middle of nowhere. It was just the road and a sad, flat, empty field around it. I mean, sure, there were a couple of trees here and there and a power line to the right, but that was it.*

*I was watching an episode of Pat & Mat when it happened. I looked to the left and saw… something. Something huge. It looked like two interconnected spheres – a big one (about five meters in radius) and a smaller one (about three meters) half-melted into it. They rested on top of a large cone, probably twenty five meters in height. Perfectly symmetrical. They had an unearthly yellow tint to them, it’s hard to explain. It kind of had a texture of a star, as seen on computer generated renders. It gave off a faint glow, but it made no sound that I could hear. It was almost hypnotizing in how uncanny and out of place it was, only amplified by the music playing in the background. If you don’t know, Pat & Mat is a very old stop motion show with no dialogue. It has a very cheery, idyllic soundtrack. Something about that weird tower of light in the middle of nowhere with that jolly, low quality audio playing in the back was so unbelievably eerie and distressing that I could barely move. And yet I couldn’t take my gaze off it.*

*“Dad…” I whispered, but there was no response. Maybe I just wasn’t loud enough? No, I don’t think it was that. My parents didn’t seem fazed by the giant tower next to us in the slightest. Without anyone to console me, I just waited and soon enough the weird thing disappeared behind us. With a sigh of relief I just looked through my shoulder. The glow was still there; an ominous beacon in the distance. At that moment the DVD player was the only comfort I had.*

*We stopped at a gas station some time later. My dad went inside to pay, while me and my mom stayed in the car. The summer night breeze blew through with a whistle, which in the current scenario seemed somewhat menacing. I was sitting in a fetal position with my legs on the seat. My mom opened the door and upon exiting stretched with a prolonged grunt. She walked up to me and I think her motherly instinct kicked in as soon as she saw the state I was in.*

*“Hey, champ. How are you feeling?” she said in a voice that was cheerful, but hid some underlying concern.*

*“I… I think I saw a UFO,” I said almost immediately and with such unprecedented bluntness, that my mom had to process it for a few seconds.*

*Heh, right, I guess I should take a few seconds and explain that. In the mind of an eight year old child, what I saw wasn’t a tower, a monolith or anything like that. It was an unidentified flying object. You know, the most stereotypical one, straight out of a 50s sci-fi movie. With the bigger sphere being the ship proper, the smaller sphere being the cockpit and the cone underneath it being a tractor beam.*

*“Really now?” there was a bit of relief in her voice. I guess she was just happy that I simply imagined something or had a bad dream instead of suddenly getting ill and ruining the whole trip.*

*I spent the next few minutes explaining the event to her. I sure am lucky I was eight, because in any other circumstance it would sound like ramblings of a maniac. I was clearly shaky with excitement. Not necessarily of the good kind.*

*“Well, crap. Looks like I slept through the whole thing,” she sighed with almost convincing disappointment. She definitely tried to play along, but I just looked down, slowly realizing that we were probably not going to be having a meaningful conversation.*

*We both heard a bell on the gas station door. My dad slowly stepped out holding two hot dogs in his hands and a petrol canister under his arm.*

*“Mustard or ketchup?” he asked.*

*“Ketchup,” I answered quietly and got handed a middle of nowhere gas station hotdog, which tasted about as good as you’d expect. I watched my dad walk behind the Nubira and put a can of car juice into the trunk. He slammed the lid and sat in the driver’s seat.*

*“Our kid saw a UFO on the way,” mom said and he almost choked on the sausage. She patted him on the back a few times.*

*“Yeah?” he said, still gasping for air. “When was that?” That answer made me lose all hope.*

*“I dunno, like twenty minutes ago..?” I was talking more and more shyly by the second. I felt like I was losing my mind. I was starting to doubt if I’ve actually seen it at all. He tapped himself on the chin a few times, clearly processing something.*

*“What did it look like?” he finally asked.*

*“Like a giant ball. I mean two. Two giant glowing balls with a tractor beam. It looked like a little sun… I mean the beam was, like, connected to it…” struggling to find the right words, I tried showing it with my hands.*

*“So kind of like a lighthouse?” he asked carefully, still scratching his chin. He was clearly taking it just a bit more seriously, however little it might have been.*

*I thought about it for a few seconds.*

*“Yeah, I guess,” I finally decided. We all took a short pause and just sat there in silence for a while. I think even my mom was starting to wonder what I might have seen there.*

*“Huh,” my dad let out an exaggerated exhale.*

*“Huh,” my mom mimicked him.*

*“Well, that’s a conundrum…” he started slowly. “I don’t know. I don’t know what that could have been. I’ll think about it.”*

*Sensing that further conversation wouldn’t bring any result I simply shut up and, with a gloomy face, ate my hotdog. To my father’s credit though, he seemed genuinely fascinated (or at the very least amused) by the idea. He knew that it wasn’t a game to me, so he chose to pursue the topic. The revelation wouldn’t come to him until about two hours later.*

*“You know, I think I know what you may have seen,” he said with a finger snap. “I don’t know a specific location, but there was a watchtower somewhere in that general area. A pretty tall one too. They WOULD have to turn the lights on at night, so I guess maybe that’s what you saw.”*

*I thought about it. There was no way in hell it was a watchtower. No light on earth could ever make it shine like this. But then again, I only saw it for a few seconds. Half a minute at most. And it was the middle of the night. Also I was eight. So maybe? “God damn it,” I thought to myself, “how could they have missed it?” That’s what was bothering me the most. I feel I was a reasonable kid for my age. I knew my own cognitive abilities or cognitive limits in that case. And so, as bitter as it always is, I started to see the possibility of me just being dumb.*

*“Maybe,” I replied.*

*Now, take that as you may. After all, I am sort of admitting my guilt here. That being said, however, I do feel sort of obliged to talk about a few things that happened later.*

*During the third day of our trip, I suffered from what was later diagnosed as a heatstroke. A particularly bad one. It started with me feeling dizzy, puking, ended with me passing out in the bathroom. Picture Danny in ‘The Shining’ (foaming at the mouth and everything). At that point I was back home in Poland; my parents were very quick to react. I don’t remember much from that time, it’s all a black hole in my memory. Supposedly I stayed at the hospital for three days, after which I was discharged. I regained consciousness at my grandparents’ house with the biggest muscle pain of my life. Let me tell you, nothing more painful has happened to me ever since.*

*Now, that on itself wouldn’t be anything particularly surprising. Croatia is a very hot country and spending the whole day at a beach without any proper head protection is practically begging for a disaster.*

*The problem is that it was raining. A lot. For those out of the loop - rain in Croatia is a bit rare. Rain in the west Croatia in the middle of the summer is REALLY rare. And usually it’s like a twenty minute dribble, but this…! This was a god damn tempest! It was out of nowhere too, completely contrary to what the weather report said. We barely left our rented house during those three days. How I was able to get a heatstroke in these conditions is beyond me.*

*And as for the watchtower theory… It was doomed to fail. The tower was there, my dad later told me. Somewhere around those parts anyway. But it was demolished for safety concerns two years prior.*

*I have visited Croatia two times since then and I have not seen that thing again. To this day definitely the closest thing to a paranormal encounter. Ever heard of anything like it?*

Shortly after publishing that post, I got a few responses. Some of them curious, some of them mocking. None of them helpful. Don’t get me wrong, they had some fun ideas. I especially liked the one about the sun aliens. You know, like the kind living on or close to the surface of the sun and therefore taking a bright, sun-like appearance. Fun times. Then again I really didn’t know what I was expecting. Embarrassingly I couldn’t even tell them where exactly the supposed watchtower was supposed to be located. My parents weren’t of any help; the heatstroke incident was the only thing they remembered from that trip. Ultimately it didn’t help me get any closure, but speaking about it allowed me to forget about it for a few years. Until around two years ago.

I woke up to a DM from the user Yuro Kei. I have to admit, I stopped using the forum two years before, so the sudden email notification really confused me. The message read:

**<Yuro Kei>** *Hey, I saw your post. It’s archived so that’s the only way I can get to you, sorry. Is it real? Because if so, I think we could be of help to each other.*
