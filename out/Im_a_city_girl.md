It was kind ironic that Eric and I were having a conversation about how dark the woods are. We were on a country road upstate, on the way to our Airbnb. It wasn't like totally unpopulated, but the houses came in clusters, there would be a few houses and some fields and then nothing but long stretches of woods and winding backroads with long distances between streetlights.

We live in a big city so it's never all the way dark at home. The light pollution makes the sky glow. The streets are well lit. There's always people around; though the later it gets the sketchier the people get. I was saying I'd rather be alone in the woods than with some of the people out in our neighborhood at 3am. We don't live in a bad neighborhood but after last call the vibe is not great. 

He said he'd much rather be with people than alone in the woods. I had flicked on my high beams because we had exited the nearest neighborhood. There was nothing but trees. Even I had to admit it was a little spooky. You get a real sense of the darkness encroaching on you when you're alone like that. The high beams help you see farther, but by contrast the woods seem even darker. There's no way of knowing what's out there in between the trees, beyond the small cone of light and the car. As we talked I managed to tap into whatever sense of agoraphobia I have. The darkness felt like a vast unknown, and I started to feel chills staring into it and wondering what could be out there.

We hadn't gone more than few miles past the last cluster of houses, which I think is what passed as “downtown." Out that way there are  entire towns that have maybe a couple hundred people in them. I was driving over the speed limit but it was 11pm in farm country. There was no one else on the roads.

I was only half paying attention when a shape burst from the treeline ahead of us. 

It was so sudden. I acted on reflex. I slammed on my brakes and the car wobbled, the wheels struggling for traction but eventually bringing us to a halt in the middle of the road.

My heart was pounding. In a lot of ways this was the culmination of the conversation we'd been having. The dark spitting an unknown onto our path.

It was a person.

The trees loomed large and dark around us, the road empty for miles.

I didn't know where they could have come from, which was more unnerving to me than their presence.

“What the hell?” Eric exclaimed.

“I'm calling the police,” I said.

“Who is out in the woods at this time of night?”

The person was standing there, frozen like the proverbial deer in our headlights. 

“Drug addicts,” I said. My phone had no service, of course. We had picked an AirBnb that was off the grid so I could actually get away from work for once. 

The guy looked normal, I guess. Dark pants and a white T shirt. He didn't have shoes which was super odd, especially if he had been in the woods. But he looked clean, he hadn't been rolling around in the dirt, nor did he have any blood on him. 

“He might be having some kind of medical emergency?” Eric said. “Do you think there are some houses nearby? Where did he come from?”

“I don't know and I don't care,” I said, glancing behind us in the mirror. I had a feeling like maybe someone else was coming up behind us. We don't live in a country where there are highway bandits or anything like that but… I guess it was the agoraphobia kicking in. I didn't really know what was around us. There could have been anything. The whole situation felt off. 

The last stretch of houses on the main road wasn't that far back. One of them probably had a landline.

I cracked my window an inch. “Hey,” I called to the guy. “We're not far from civilization. If you wait here we'll go get you some help.”

He seemed to have recovered from his shock as he started walking towards us.

“I'm sorry sir but please don't come any closer,” I called, and then rolled up my window.

“What are you doing?” Eric asked as I threw the car in reverse.

“Getting out of here and calling the police.”

“Are you crazy? What if he needs help? We can't just leave him here.”

“We can and we will,” I said, beginning to inch the car backwards. It was a narrow road so I suspected it was going to be more than a three point turn to get us headed in the other direction. 

The man saw our car beginning to move and held his hand out, shaking his head. He jogged over to my window and I stopped the car, unwilling to hit him by accident.

He stood next to the driver's side window expectantly. 

“I'm sorry sir, but I'm not going to roll down the window,” I called. “If you want to talk we can do it through the glass.”

I didn't like his face. There was nothing wrong with it, I just – didn't trust him. I had an uneasy feeling about the whole situation. I would have felt more comfortable if he had been in distress - a car accident or something would have explained why he was out here. Or the lack of shoes. But he seemed perfectly calm.

“Are you serious?” Eric asked me.

“Yes I'm fucking serious,” I said, turning to face him. “Random guy in the middle of the night? Absolutely not. He seems fine. He can wait here for an ambulance or a ride or whatever. I'm not letting random men in my car.”

“If he wanted to get in the car he'd already be in,” Eric grumbled. “Everyone out here has guns. You're so fucking paranoid.”

“Yeah, well, its my car. Also my safety.”

I turned to face the guy again and nearly jumped out of my skin. He was up close to the window now. He had been a foot or two back before, but now his breath was fogging up the glass. “Jesus Christ,” I yelped. “Did you see him move?”

“No, he teleported,” Eric said sarcastically.

“Okay fuck off, Eric, I am not in the mood. If you're so worried about this guy you'll let me turn the car around and get him help faster.” I raised my voice, “Sir if you could step back, we're going to get you help. The sooner we leave the sooner we can get someone out here to help you.”

He mouthed something unintelligible and pointed to the back of my SUV.

“Nope,” I said. “Sorry, we don't have the space for you.” The glass was tinted so maybe the lie held muster. I didn't really care.

He mouthed something else.

“You're going to have to speak a little louder,” I called. 

“For God's sake it's like the deaf leading the blind,” Eric said, and rolled down his window. 

“Hey!” he yelled. “My girlfriend is paranoid, but what do you need, man?”

The man looked over and began to walk around the car. He went around the front so I took the opportunity to back the car up. I was probably scraping it up with the branches, I backed it off the road and well into the bushes, but I managed to get pulled back pretty far.

“Are you fucking kidding me, Eric?” I said as I was inching the car back, while eyeing the man for sudden moves.

“Are you kidding me? This is stupid.”

I rolled up his windows and hit the lock button. He hit the button a couple times and said, “The child locks? Real mature.”

He unbuckled his seatbelt and cracked open the door. The car pinged a warning.

“Don't you fucking dare,” I said.

“Relax, he's not dangerous,” Eric said. “He looks perfectly normal. It's an asshole move to leave him here. Let me talk to him. The least we can do is lend him a pair of sneakers.”

“This is a waste of time,” I said. “We're not taking him. We're not giving him anything. We're lucky he hasn't slashed our tires. He could be a murderer for all we know. Who comes running into the road in the middle of the night?”

“Someone in trouble,” Eric said. “If it were you I would hope someone picked you up and didn't leave you stranded.”

I wavered a bit. “I don't think this is a good idea, he could be anybody…”

“It'll take like two seconds to see what this guy needs. Can you just put the car in park for like two seconds?”

The guy was mostly around the car now, and Eric stepped out to talk to him. He was standing with most of his body blocked by the door, his feet were on the pavement and his head over the window, so sort of half in and half out, I guess. I kept my foot firmly on the brake but I was still in drive. 

“Sorry my girlfriend is completely paranoid,” he said. “She doesn't like strangers. What do you need, man? Ambulance? Taxi? Where'd you come from anyway?” 

The man's mouth moved. I couldn't hear what he said, but apparently neither did Eric, because he said, “You're going to have to speak up, I didn't catch that. You okay?”

The man moved quickly. All of a sudden he was right in Eric's face and Eric said, “Whoa man, I'm going to need you to back up.”

He pushed the door outward to force the man away, but the man caught the door, leaned over, and whispered something in Eric's ear.

Eric turned to me, a horrified expression on his face, and that was the last I remember seeing him. I don't know what happened exactly, it all happened so fast, but he was ripped away from the car, into the woods…maybe he sprinted on his own, I almost think he did, but that doesn't make any sense to me. I don't know. All of a sudden he was gone, into the woods, and I had lost sight of the strange man. Out of instinct I slammed my foot on the gas and whipped the car around with more force than speed, but managed to get the car all the way around facing back the way we came. The momentum closed the passenger door. I paused, heart pounding, the car creeping forward without my foot on either pedal. I couldn't just leave Eric.

I glanced over and screamed. The man was next to my driver's side window somehow, still mouthing something at me. I slammed on the gas again and took off, tires squealing. The door hadn't latched all the way closed so my car was still pinging every few seconds. As soon as we hit a straight stretch of road I unbuckled my seat belt and reached over and closed the door. It had been mostly closed, I had to grab the handle to get the mechanism to fully open and then I slammed it shut. 

I whipped into the first driveway I saw. At that speed it was only a couple minutes from where I lost Eric. They had more of a field than a yard or even a driveway, so I didn't feel as bad churning up some dirt as my car fishtailed. The car activated the motion sensor lights on their house, so an insanely bright floodlight illuminated my car and blinded me. I heard a thump and then their other lights on the side of their house also came on. A dog started barking from inside. I couldn't see anything due to the glare. I killed my engine and fumbled with my seatbelt for one second, and then five.

“Come on come on come on,” I mumbled, my hands shaking too bad from the adrenaline to be able to press the button.

I heard a megaphone from the house.

“Stay in your car,” the voice squawked. “Police are on the way. If you move you'll be shot. Blink your headlights if you understand.”

I sat for a moment trying to understand, Because I was numb and I didn't. The voice repeated themselves. I turned my car back on, flashed my high beams on and off a couple times, and then sat back, seat belt still on, and heart racing.

It took nearly forty five minutes for the police to arrive.

The voice blared from the upstairs window from time to time, updating me on the police's arrival time and, oddly, once mentioning this was, “For your own safety.”

The lights flicked off after a few minutes and then the one at the front of the house came back on. The voice announced it had turned the lights on and the motion sensor off. 

I kept checking my phone for a signal and I kept not having one. Forty five minutes is a long fucking time to wait in a car. I kept the car idling in case I had to make a speedy exit, but I tried not to move around too much because I got the feeling the homeowner had a gun trained on me and wouldn't hesitate to shoot if they so much as suspected I was trying to get out of the car. 

When the police arrived they did a sweep of the area before coming to me and letting me out.

There was an ambulance too, they ushered me into it and drove me to the nearest hospital, which was some miles away. I kept asking after Eric. The police said they would send someone to investigate the area he went missing.

I asked about him a few times but the hospital staff just kept saying they didnt know. They insisted on doing an exam even though I hadn't been in an accident.

There was a police officer hanging around who at one point just shook his head and then put his head in his hands.

In the morning, barely - it was 5am by that point, which is bed time for some of my friends - someone who seemed more important than a regular officer came to talk to me. He was very reassuring and told me they had a search and rescue team looking for Eric, and they would hopefully find him within a few hours. He then paused and said if he were injured somewhere they couldn't find him, the odds after twenty four hours were not as good, that I should prepare for that as an outside possibility.

I thanked him and made sure he had my contact information. They had already been in touch with Eric's parents.

I was gathering my purse and shoes when someone who worked at the hospital stopped by my room. They were in scrubs but I wasn't sure if they were a nurse or an admin. 

“Your boyfriend didnt make it, sweetie,” they said.

“Oh my god, what happened to him?”

“Well – look, the truth is I don't know. But he's not coming back.”

“What do you mean you don't know?”

They shook their head and glanced to the side. “I'm sorry, but the… man who took him doesn't leave anyone alive.”

“So you're just letting a serial killer run loose in this town?”

“Look, you didn't hear this from me. But they're not going to find him in the next twenty four hours. They're going to find him in a few weeks or months from now and any coroner will say it looks like he was mauled in a bear attack. But his teeth will be missing.”

“What the fuck…”

“You didn't hear this from me. You didn't hear it at all. You mention this to anyone and I'll get fired - because it's the truth and they're covering up what they can't control. I need this job to pay the bills, but I'm looking for an excuse to get out of this hellhole and I'm sick of lying to people. So it's up to you. You can do with this information what you want, I don't care. I've done my part.”

They walked away and I was too confused to chase them. I thought it was possible they were a mental patient who was somehow wandering. 

I got my car back when I left the hospital. It was at the police station. It seemed fine, it was covered in a coat of dust from some of the unpaved roads we had driven earlier, but when I looked at the back there were handprints. A couple with flat palms wrapped around the sides of the car, the way someone would grab hold if they were trying to brace themselves on a moving vehicle. There were also some linear smudges around the trunk latch, in groups of four, that looked like they could have been from fingers.

See, when I had been driving, after Eric… was taken, I had heard a weird scraping noise, which I had assumed was a branch caught in a body panel dragging on the ground. But a branch wouldn't have left marks like that. There were other marks in the dust that were clearly leaves from the bushes I backed into. They didn't look anything like handprints. 

I asked the guy in charge of impound if he touched my car. 

He said, “No ma'am,” but paused when he saw the look on my face and followed my line of sight to the handprints on the car. “Well, sometimes the guys might fool around, I'll have a talk with them, but nothing is damaged. Don't worry about the dirt, it'll come right off. He rubbed some with his sleeve, erasing one of the handprints. 

I just took my car and left. I checked the back seat, the trunk, and even the undercarriage before I left the station, but it all seemed fine. 

It occurred to me later as I was driving home, still shaken, that they had never asked me anything about what Eric looked like. His height, his skin color, what he was wearing. They usually ask that when they send out a search team to find someone right?

They didn't find Eric. I'm back home now, in our shared apartment. My cat keeps walking around looking for him. It's heartbreaking. I've talked to his parents a few times but they're completely distraught. I know Eric doesn't necessarily come off the best from what I've written, we were both cranky, and tired, and overworked that night. But he was a good guy who went out trying to help someone in need. I struggle a lot with guilt right now. I wasn't as caring as he was, but it saved me. I want to be a better person. I'm angry with Eric for being such an idiot. Why didn't he just sit back down in the car, and I could have taken us both to safety? I'm angry with myself for not talking to that man - it should have been me. I'm hopeful they'll somehow find Eric, hungry and dirty but alive, in some ditch with a broken leg, even though I know at this point it's basically impossible.

It's been two months. They found some remains out there last week, and they did call. They called to ask if he was possibly wearing a red windbreaker - which he wasn't. 

I got a sympathetic clerk to tell me more than she was probably supposed to when I called back yesterday to inquire. She felt bad about calling me over the false lead. They identified the body as female from her pelvis. They ended up finding most of the larger bones, including pieces of the skull, but the teeth were missing. It looked like a bear attack, she said. 

At this point, I'm never leaving the city again, and I'd advise any of you to do the same. I don't know how people can stand it. I used to think maybe I wanted a house out in the suburbs someday, but I think if I ever have kids I'll raise them in an apartment. You don't - you can't ever know what's out there, in the dark.
