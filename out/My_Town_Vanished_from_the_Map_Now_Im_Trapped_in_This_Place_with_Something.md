You ever heard of Mainlard? Of course not. We used to be a town in the American Midwest, but now, we're just a name lost in the annals of oblivion â€“ a place that one day adorned every map, known for its picturesque beauty, warm atmosphere, splendid wildlife, and flora, a prime tourist destination. Then came what we, the town's people, call the "Mainlard Effect."  
  
I was there on that day when we vanished from collective consciousness. At first, something felt off, but no one could pinpoint exactly what. First, the cars stopped passing through the highway for a very, VERY long time. We went 12 hours without any cars, which, for us, was unprecedented. Then came what we now call the "last breath." One of our communication towers picked up a message from a plane pilot:  
  
"Attention, Mainlard Tower F, do you copy?"  
  
"Tower F, copy."  
  
"Where... Where is the city?"  
  
"What do you mean? We're here."  
  
Static and screams echoed through the communicator. It continued for 5 minutes until there was nothing but silence, the kind of silence that would persist until now.  
  
It didn't take long for the Black Heads to arrive (I shouldn't call them that; they don't like that nickname). Military patrols, or something resembling it, started sweeping the streets. They set up with large trucks at the city's edges, striking fear into anyone who dared approach. It was through them that the supply shipments reached the city, distributing food, water, and clothing.  
  
A curfew was declared too. From 10 PM onwards, no one could roam the streets under any circumstances. The most you'd hear are boots hitting the asphalt, from those on patrol. We learned early on what happened to those who disobeyed: Frank, a local drunk, refused to obey the curfew early on, in the second week. We heard his screams on his last night, followed by gunshots echoing through the empty city.  
  
Humans adapt to anything surprisingly quickly. Gradually, we returned to what was expected of a society. Schools reopened, sports centers, even a small local radio, reporting the news of the residents. I liked it because it was the only thing to do after 10 PM; I sat next to a small battery-powered radio that I had. It was during one of these nights, listening to Katie's news, that I made a mistake and saw the Jubilee.  
  
You see, the Jubilee is a ritual that started shortly after the militia arrived. Every last Friday of the month, they choose a citizen by lottery to be sent back to the "real world" (which I suppose is where you are). This person is taken in the supply truck, and then we never see them again (and we assume they forget about here too). At least, that's what they told us. The Jubilee happens at night, and we're forbidden to spy or eavesdrop; they say that merely observing a phenomenon of this magnitude can alter it. It's common to see the guards in the Jubilee week covering the windows, and here we get to the sum of everything: Over time, like almost every human activity, the patrols "relaxed." Yesterday was Friday, the last of the month, and they forgot to cover my window completely.  
  
And while I, as mentioned before, listened to Katie's drawing news, a movement of light in the window caught my attention: I looked as I saw the Jubilee passing. The supply truck, with the chosen person, Mary, the hairdresser's wife, in its bed. She was (as instructed) tied to the truck to prevent, according to them, "getting lost in quantum tunnels." A troop escorted her while looking at the streets. I could swear one of them stared at me, but if he did, he seemed to ignore it; my window is on the second floor and only has a small gap. This convoy continued for a few more meters until one of the edges, where the city ended, and the dense forest began. Although they were far away, it was still possible to recognize their outline.  
  
The soldiers moved away from the truck a few meters, and then one of them threw something, I don't know, maybe a grenade? It released a flash of light. Suddenly, something began to writhe; I could swear I saw Mary struggling until the thing came. From the ground, an incomprehensible creature, a kind of worm with several tubular mouths full of teeth, emerged; it writhed with its tentacles while grabbing the defenseless woman. The mere grip of the creature on the sides of the truck was enough to dent the metal. The woman was lifted from her place, breaking the ties that held her violently. She was lifted above the creature's head, and then each of its tentacles grabbed one of her limbs, pulling in different directions. Her arms and legs detached from her torso, which fell straight, along with the sea of blood, into the creature's mouth, which then devoured each of the limbs it was holding.  
  
The officers simply turned around and headed back to their support center; a cultural hush settled in. The creature, as quickly as it emerged, had sunk into the ground again. I couldn't sleep that night, not the next. I fell asleep on Sunday, finally exhausted, after isolating myself completely over the weekend.  
  
I woke up with the first rays of Monday's sun, and when I remembered what awaited me, I trembled. The Monday after the Jubilee is when the next name is drawn. We headed to the central square as the big bowl of names was shaken; I saw the guard's hand groping from side to side until finally pulling a small white strip of cellulose. He cleared his throat as he read the paper: Daniel Sinclair. My name.  
  
I don't know if this will reach anyone; I hid this in one of the food bags they take to reload, sewed a false compartment on top; I hope it worked. In case you're reading this, no matter where you are, I beg you to try to contact Mainlard somehow. We need help; our town disappeared from the map, and something is devouring the inhabitants.
