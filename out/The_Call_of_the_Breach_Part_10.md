[\[Part 11\]](https://www.reddit.com/user/RandomAppalachian468/comments/1hg2han/the_call_of_the_breach_part_11/)

Perched atop my command truck, I stared off into the misty blackness, a thick wool blanket wrapped around my shoulders, the Type 9 cradled in my arms. Dawn was close, but even in the dark the fighting had barely petered off, enemy patrols doing their best to track our distraction sorties in the dark. Curtains of thick white fog hugged the surrounding hills like tufts of cotton, and occasionally lit up from artillery on the horizon. Most of us had bedded down in prearranged hide spots many hours ago, digging in and waiting for the sunrise. With the sheer amount of mutants out there, Vecitorak notwithstanding, it was safer to stay inside the wire.

*Not that it’s much safer in the daylight with all the shells flying back and forth.*

Palming the modified radio, I clicked the talk button again and checked my watch. “Last call, Sparrow One Actual to Falcon, come in Falcon. If you can read me, please respond. Use your morse key if your signal is weak.”

Static hissed in the speaker, and I sighed in disappointment. We would be on the move soon, so I felt confident enough to risk a radio transmission before we set off. With how far north we were, I’d figured reaching Jamie would be impossible, but still I wanted to hope.

*“You there, Sparrow?”*

My heart leapt, and I almost dropped the radio in excitement, my face split with a smile. “I’m here! I’m here, I can hear you. Your signal is really great, are you somewhere safe?”

Static crackled, and Jamie’s voice came through in a weary chuckle. *“Sort of. Good to hear your voice, Brandi-Badass. How’s the game going?”*

Even though we hadn’t had much time before her banishment to set up a formal code system for speaking over the radio, I knew Jamie well enough to recognize what she was talking about.

“Seems good so far.” I shrugged, remembered she couldn’t see me, and stared at the radio speaker, missing my old phone. “I haven’t been in the thick of it, mostly. Just running errands.”

*“Mr. Wonderful got you on the sidelines?”*

Her teasing brought a rare grin to my face, and it felt good to laugh. “Nah, it was Big Man’s call. Though if I’m being honest, Chri—Mr. Wonderful, probably doesn’t mind me being away from the rough stuff. Of course, once we get to where we’re going, I doubt anyone will be able to stay out of it for long.”

*“Yeah.”* Jamie paused for a moment, as if unsure what to say next.

*Come on Hannah, you’re already talking about yourself while she’s the one who’s sleeping in the woods alone.*

Mortified at my own selfishness, I clicked the talk button again. “So, how are you holding up? I’ve been worried sick about you. Are you getting enough to eat?”

*“Still on the move.”* She sighed. *“Food’s been light, but I’ve managed to snag some fish and small game here and there. I definitely won’t have to worry about fitting into my bikini next year.”*

The rueful sarcasm in her voice made my chest hurt, and I winced despite myself. “I miss you, you know. I think about turning around to go pick you up all the time. I’m sure Mr. Wonderful would come with me if I did.”

She laughed at that, though it ended in something that sounded like a sniffle. *“I miss you too, you amazing little dork. Remember how we used to go jogging around the fort in the mornings? Used to take extra-long lacing up our shoes so the guys would already be shirtless and running by the time we started.”*

I tried not to tear up at the melancholy that overtook me at the warm memories, and it felt like I was speaking to Jamie’s ghost, as if she were already dead. “It certainly made the run a little nicer. Remember how the kabob stand would sell those barbeque specials on Saturdays? I could have eaten those things all—”

*“Clear the air, clear the air; all units stand by for orders.”* Sean’s voice thundered over the headset I had looped around my neck, the volume turned up so I could hear without the speakers pressed to my ears. His strained tone made my blood run cold, and it took me a moment to realize I still had the talk button pushed down on my special radio.

*“All Rhino, Stag, and Sparrow units, I say again, all combat units, converge on Rally point 13. Rhino One Actual will take command on the ground and direct the teams from there. This is an immediate priority, break camp, and move to target as fast as possible. Hilltop out.”*

My throat felt dry, and I sucked in a tense breath.

*Rhino One Actual, that’s Chris. Sean’s sending in everyone, us included. This is it.*

“I-I gotta go.” Both legs screamed with pins-and-needles as I struggled to my feet.

*“I heard.”* Jamie rasped from the other side of the radio. *“Must be a big one. Be careful out there, okay?”*

“You too.” I grimaced, wishing I could hug her through the speaker. “Talk to you again soon. Stay safe, Falcon.”

Our small patrol base came to life in moments as the other officers exploded from their tents to wake their respective troops. Tents spotted the ground, some built onto the side of our vehicles, but they swarmed with motion as we leaders ran to wake our groggy soldiers. In total, our forces stood at 183 fighters from New Wilderness, and roughly 720 from Ark River, the remainder of our 1,000 strong populace either too old, young, or medically unfit to fight. Each mobile fort was made to house two or three ‘platoons’ of roughly 25 men each, thus making our forces harder to spot, track, and shell from the air. Not all were front line fighters of course—there were medics, logistics crews, messengers, and the odd headquarters radio operator, but all carried weapons, and when push came to shove, everyone was a rifleman.

“Let’s go, everyone up!” Heart pumping like mad, I ran down the line of tents holding my men and rapped on the tent poles with the buttstock of my Type 9. “We’re going in, get up! NCO’s get your guys in order, we’ve gotta move!”

Engines revved, tents were ripped down in record time, and the fighters dressed as they ran, faces pale with anticipation. Headlights flared to life to bathe the area in white cones of light, the tangy scent of diesel exhaust filled the air, and the various pack animals in camp snorted with pent up energy. As fast as they could, my crew formed ranks, and I counted off tousled heads until I got my total.

*Twenty-five. Will there be twenty-five come tomorrow? Will there be any?*

“Okay, you’ve got five minutes!” I shouted over the roar of the engines and ran to help Lucille finish collecting my own tent and gear. “Get your gear squared away, hit the latrine one last time, and mount up. Squad leaders, let me know when your trucks are ready to roll.”

Barely visible between the fog, long streaks of crimson, orange, and pink nibbled at the sky as we rolled out of the makeshift gates, the support platoon of Workers behind us laboring feverishly to tear down the fences and packing the coiled wire away for the next time. Cool air rushed into our rolled down windows, the worn tires kicked up showers of gray mud, and I found myself at the head of our small convoy as we raced through the dilapidated countryside towards our rally point.

Like golden ants emerging from a nest, more headlights soon appeared from roads all over and flooded into a wide rolling field about five miles northwest of our campsite. Men with reflective flags waves to us from the ramparts of another temporary base squarely in the middle, itself in the final stages of teardown. Here the old wheat had long since been scorched by wildfires, and the grass had grown up to create a wide swathe of emerald green. Column after column circled the tiny camp, and as we all rolled in, I copied the other commanders to leap from my command truck and raced for the flags in a breathless sprint.

A familiar broad set of shoulders came into view, and my frantic heart skipped an overjoyed beat.

*Hello Mr. Wonderful.*

Poised in the midst of the stampede of faces, Chris stood on the hood of his armored pickup, and scanned the field with his eyes as we all came in. He looked exhausted, dark circles under his blue eyes, his uniform dirty and even speckled with dried blood in places, but he was still in one piece. Our eyes met across the crowd, and I saw him fight back a smile of relief.

“Okay, listen up!” He shouted over the crowd as lieutenants and platoon sergeants clustered in around his truck. “We’ve just received word from a forward scout unit that they discovered an enemy field depot not far from here. According to their reports, we believe this is the main supply hub connecting all ELSAR units not currently in Black Oak or stationed on the border.”

Two of his men held up a map so we could see, and Chris traced a route with a stick as a pointer. “Our objective is here, an abandoned road maintenance station which ELSAR has converted into a forward operating base. Now this depot will have fuel, ammunition, meds, everything we need to keep our momentum up. I don’t have to tell you what that could mean for us, if we capture it intact.”

Heads nodded, and a multitude of eyes flashed in eager, if nervous understanding. This was huge, our biggest effort yet in the past few days. I couldn’t help but share the excitement in the moment, though my poor intestines writhed like snakes in dread at what was to come. I *hated* killing other people, had done it only a few times, but enough to know it was terrible. Now that the lives of others were in my charge, I felt ready to vomit at the prospect of taking them into the hellish inferno of human warfare.

*But if I don’t, they’ll die anyway. ELSAR, Vecitorak, starvation, it makes no difference. Either we fight now or die later.*

Straightening up, Chris surveyed us with a stern line across his lips. “We are less than fifteen miles south of Black Oak, but with this heavy fog, they’ll have a hard time bringing any air support to bear. If we can pull this off, ELSAR’s men will be forced to withdraw into the city for lack of supplies, giving us cover to reach the gates. By taking this depot, we could have a chance to end the war in a matter of days.”

Pencil in hand, I hurried to copy the map as best I could in my own notebook and waited alongside the others with bated breath.

“However, the enemy is not completely unprepared.” Chris turned back to the map, and pointed out each objective by name. “They’ve got three machine gun bunkers on the north, east, and western sides in a triangular formation to cover all approaches. They likely have mortar and rocket positions on the warehouse rooftops, along with snipers. From the activity inside, we’re looking at a garrison of around 120 men, most of which are bedded down in a two-story office building near the eastern bunker. It’s going to be a tough nut to crack, but if we close the distance fast enough, we can overwhelm them with superior numbers.”

He swiveled to angle his pointer-stick at each group of lieutenants as he went. “In the first phase, I want all the howitzers and mortars brough in line-of-sight range, to focus on the concrete bunkers. Those have to be destroyed before we can move in, but we *cannot* shell the areas with fuel or ammo, otherwise the entire place will go up. Snipers and battle-truck gunners, I need you to circle the enemy on three sides and engage the rooftops to keep them from bringing their artillery and rockets to bear. In the second phase, after the barrage has suppressed the defenses, our infantry will move in and clear the base from west to east in an L shaped assault. Cavalry and scouts, you guys are to dismount and move in with the rest of our infantry on foot. We’ll bound forward under covering fire from light machine guns in the rear. Any questions?”

Heads shook back and forth, and Chris put both hands on his hips in satisfaction.

“Alright then. We go on my flare. The operation stops when I call ‘cease fire’ over the radio, or if I shoot another flare. Remember, we only have a limited window of time to get in, smoke the defenders, and call our logistics boys in to haul away the loot before the fog clears. That means we have to be thorough, we have to be fast, and above all else, we have to be vicious. Do *not* stop your attack for anything, otherwise, if we get bogged down, they’ll drop a JADAM on our heads. Understood?”

*“Yes sir.”* The crowd rumbled, and I raised my arm in salute with the rest, a mix of emotions in my chest. I was proud, both of Chris and myself, that this moment had come to us. However, I knew Chris would be at the front as always, and so would I. The odds of either of us catching a bullet would be high, and even with all the captured supplies from ELSAR, our medics couldn’t save everyone.

*If I walk into an aid station and he’s there getting his legs sawn off. . . oh God, I’ll lose my mind.*

“Alright then, take five minutes to brief your platoons, and stand by to move out.” Chris hopped down from his truck, and everyone flew into motion again.

Standing there, I fought to make myself move, frozen in the moment. I knew I didn’t have time to go see him, not when so much was happening, but my heart ached at the sight of Chris’s exhausted face, my mind pleaded with me to run to him, and the raw human part of me craved his reassuring touch now more than ever. He’d always been there to guide me through the rough patches before, but I couldn’t be there for him now. We’d been entrusted with positions of power, handed the reigns of the future, and that meant sacrificing everything for the betterment of the war effort.

*Others have gone through worse to get me this far. It’s time I repaid that favor.*

Reluctantly I turned back to my column and jogged to 4^(th) platoon.

Once we briefed our troops, we drove northward for a mile or so and staged our vehicles behind a small clump of hills opposite our target. The air was cold, but we scaled the wet clay slope in single files lines, nervously scanning the trees and brush around us for any signs of mutants. We all knew this was an enormous risk, but none were as nervous as I was, my tattoos itching in recognition of our danger. True, this gamble could pay off in high reward, but if Vecitorak were to pounce on us now, we would lose more than a few of our number.

At last, we crested the ridge and looked down on our target.

Ringed with a chain link fence backed up by wire mesh cages filled with dirt called Hesco barriers, the depot was impressive in its size, and I could see three large sheet metal warehouses inside, along with round fuel storage tanks on one end, and a two-story office building on the other. Sandbag positions on the nearly flat rooftops spoke to where the rockets and snipers were, and squat concrete boxes blocked the approaches on three sides, these undoubtedly the machine gun nests. Numerous military trucks, both armored fighting ones like ours and unarmored cargo ones were arranged in rows inside the wire, pallets of boxes clustered in between. This place clearly had a lot of supplies packed into it, and judging from the few soldiers we could see walking in the open, they weren’t expecting an attack this early.

Huddled to the damp grass at the base of the hills we’d climbed over, I sucked in a breath and checked my wristwatch. The tiny black metal second hand ticked in sync with my heart, a familiar weight of dread heavy on my shoulders. It was still cold, the morning young, and the sun didn’t yet have the strength to disperse the damp curtain of mist. Dew wetted the cloth of my uniform, and I fought shivers that came both from cold and fear.

*Any second now.*

Behind me, fourth platoon lay concealed in the grass, their painted faces hidden by the shadow of their steel helmets, each waiting for me to give the word. Hunched in the tall weeds of the unkempt Appalachian countryside, our world had been narrowed to the immediate area within line of sight, and like rabbits we were hesitant to poke our heads up from the relative safety of our hiding spot.

*Boom, boom, boom, boom.*

With a thunderous roar, the quiet was shattered, and bone-chilling whistles hurtled through the air overhead to impact in the trees not far off.

*Ka-boom.*

Dirt flew into the air, tree trunks splintered, and bits of debris rained down in a hail of broken earth. Despite our artillery being over a hundred yards to our rear, I felt each detonation in my chest as if the shells had exploded right next to me. Mortars screamed in at high, shrieking arcs, while the howitzers lay entire groves to waste, felling great oaks, pines, and maples in a single shot. Fire caught in various places, stones the size of car tires were thrown into the sky, and I hugged the ground along with the rest of my command in sheer terror at our bombardment.

*Nobody could survive that.*

However, the tiny voice of experience within myself knew better than to create false hope, and as I held my fingers to my ears, I squinted between blades of grass at the hazy outlines of entrenchments across the old county road. ELSAR didn’t hire fools for their security forces, their field troops well-trained and battle hardened. I had no idea if God existed, but once again, I found myself praying, hoping that someone, anyone, could take time out of their celestial existence to watch over us pitiful few.

*Pop . . . hiss.*

Into darkened sky, a red flare shot like a comet, leaving a long, bloody trail in its wake.

My gut clenched, I pulled the fingers from my ears as the guns fell silent and heard the cries of the other platoons to our left flank, along with the shrill tin whistles each officer had been issued.

Machine guns roared to life with heavy *bam-bam-bams* and crimson tracers cut through the night from our surplus militia ammunition. The other platoons lunged into motion, a tidal wave of drab uniformed figures screaming like banshees until their throats were sore.

 Bright green tracers began to slice through the air toward us from the garrison, the bullets snapping around my ears like angry bees. The fog swirled from the detonations of hand grenades thrown in waves by our advancing men, dirt seemed to rain from the sky in a constant hail, and the shadows were broken by the bursting of explosions in yellow sparks.

*Old man in heaven, if you’re up there . . . please don’t leave us now.*

Putting my own metal whistle to my lips, I blew a long, hard blast, and leapt upright, submachine gun in hand. “Fourth platoon, on your feet!”
