There is no excuse for this. I am supposed to keep the commitment and post at the days I myself alluded to in the first post. Please accept my sincere apologies. However, my family gets the priority in this matter and it is for them that I have been absent during those past days. Of course, a lot has happened in that time frame, therefore, here are the events spanning from last week Thursday to this Wednesday.

My supervisor and a few other higher-ups I have never seen before applauded me as soon as I arrived to the workplace last Thursday. On the other hand, Dylan was boiling with resentment and rage. Why? A brand new car. One of the most luxurious SUVs on the market was the surprise gift that the company decided to award me with after my previous and disastrous shift. I did not want it, and could not smile, after all, I just witnessed a person die recently and being disposed of like mere trash. They all dismissed my expressions and body language, resolute to carry on with the facade.

During the shift, midnight and the rest, I stayed in the black room, broken and crying, trembling and coughing up blood. I did not pay attention to anything or anyone and just left in the morning without taking the black SUV with me. I went directly to the hospital to see my wife and kids.

On Friday, while commuting, I had an interesting chat with Connor, still on his way to the city I live in. The conversation did not go exactly like that, but this post does not need to be unnecessary long, so I have just included the most relevant parts:

"When we meetin?" I asked.

"Soon." He answered.

"Who are you anyway? Why should I trust you?" I questioned.

"I'm the one who want to help. At least, the closest one. I know what's going on exactly, I know what to do. And you don't. I've been linked to that company, I have been in that town, and I know what I went through back in 2013 and later."

"You worked there?" I asked.

"Not directly. And whatever that surprise gift is, don't take it!!!" He replied.

"Why?" I questioned, just curious about his reply.

"It will be your downfall. You know what they say, if you can't beat them, join them. Unless I help you and we try something, I only see two options for you. The grave or you become the next supervisor. The latter is the worst." Connor replied.

"So you know what all those things are? Why me? Why my family? What do they want?" I asked.

"Why you? Man, you applied for a job there. What you think a corporation want to do with you? They want to squeeze the juice out of you to the last drop, and all for their own benefit. They don't care about you, your life, your freedom, your family, your kids... You not a human to them, you a selected productivity unit, in this case, a mere cow for a ritual, where the entity is the farmer and the company owns the farm, or is the farm. This is bigger than us, and it runs deeper, with the government of this country, things like WFH vs RTO, and much more..." He revealed.

The chat went on and he eventually sent me a link to his own [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/sbcihn/midnight_survival/). If I did not go through my own experiences with the entity, I would not believe his terrifying encounter with the enforcer. However, his first suggestion is something that can easily make me believe that he tried to kill me. Connor advised me to break all the rules established by the institution except the one to avoid seeing the entity. Connor mainly wanted me to talk to it.

Later on, I started the shift as usual but stayed once again in the black room all the time. My supervisor who still has an eye on me during my shifts called me, but I ignored him, preferring to reflect on my life and all the events. Who was that clown mask guy? Was he just a thief? What will happen to my kids? What will happen if I directly interact with this thing?

At midnight, the entity came to the door and told me that it was preparing a surprise for the moon. I fought hard internally, trying to build up the courage to address it directly, something it always tried to make me do, but I refrained. Then, maybe frustrated about my silence, the entity did something I never thought it could do. With one precise, mighty strike, it broke the door of the black room open.

I almost caught a glimpse of it, briefly seeing a yellow and warm light while the door flew in my direction. I curled and turned around, got hit by the door but kept my ground. I then open my eyes while facing the wall and saw the reflection of my shadow, surrounded by the one of the entity which extended countless limbs all around the doorframe as it still could not enter inside the room. We could both hear my heart beating and my heavy breathing. Each time I moved by even an inch, the entity moved too around the door frame, with unnatural movements that I cannot not find words to describe yet as I could not even make out its appearance. I could not talk to it. I really thought it would make it strong enough to finally end me inside the black room.

"I shall feast on your heart when the time comes." It quietly said with a soft woman's voice then its shadow disappeared a few seconds later, leaving only mine against the wall. As you probably guessed, it was 01:00 am, but I remained petrified for at least thirty minutes.

There is no way I could talk to it. I told Connor the truth about that later that day in the morning. A human cannot just confront that thing. He understood my fear and notified me that he had arrived in the city. He asked me to directly go to the hospital where he was already waiting for me.

We went to the kids room almost immediately and woke up my wife as we arrived. After closing the doors and windows, switching the lights off and plunging us in the dark, Connor pulled out his own fancy flashlight from his backpack and used the UV mode right on the kids. It revealed something shining from inside their chests and they just began convulsing while slowly vomiting something black. On his instructions, I had to hold my wife and prevent her to scream at him and the horrifying spectacle, until the black objects were completely out of their mouths. They were the missing gloves. My kids woke up almost instantly, seemingly cured on the spot.

After what the entity had showed me on Friday, my wife and I contemplated the idea to just run away from all that even if we had to start over somewhere else. We had even started preparing our escape during the weekend. Therefore, I did not post anything here, and subsequently, I did not go to work on Monday and Tuesday. Connor was against the idea and reminded me that it did not really worked for him. He only alluded to it in his post, but he had to fight back for his family and himself, just like I have to do, especially if I want to stop my own health affliction. A problem needs to be resolved, not ignored or abandoned. I had to return there, not to continue being their slave, but to end it once for all.

Meanwhile, my supervisor left many messages, apologizing for the more and more aggressive behavior of the entity, begging me to return to work, and offering me to meet the 'management board' on Friday. I could no longer understand that man. He is becoming an enigma in the same way the entity is. Nothing makes sense in this company. However, there was something that I could easily understand: danger. Just today at midnight, by the window, I saw a silent police car, with lights off, moving up and down the alley, as if the officer, or should I say the enforcer, waited for the right moment to strike.
