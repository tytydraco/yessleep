Detailed incident #qr-13lm. #325-a

He couldn’t believe what he was doing.
A year ago, if you told him he’d be with the white-haired fat man, talking himself up enough to steal the man’s thumb by force, he might have believed you.

He was reckless and liked ending up in weird situations, but he’d have had questions.

Tonight, after chasing the white-haired fat man down and knocking him unconscious with the broad end of the flashlight, there would be no questions, only actions.
He gritted his teeth as he held down the man’s wrist, pressing the thumb into the meat of the three-day-old Wendy’s baked potato.

Then, before the man could regain consciousness, he lifted the knife, aligning it with his shoulder, and brought it down hard, severing it with an almost surgical precision, muttering to himself, “Damn it,” when the thumb hung onto the remaining flesh, refusing to separate.

But with another quick, deliberate slice, it was properly detached, though looking like a jagged puzzle piece that had been ripped out of place, the little cardboard-like fold of skin flapping like an eel placed on a cutting board.

He let go of the potato, letting it hit the ground, but grabbing the thumb, wrapping it quickly with an old gym towel.
The man, now fully awake and caught between shock and grief from unexpected loss, sat up, stifling his tears and reaching into his black leather doctor's jacket, pulling out his cell phone.

The man grabbed the phone, putting it in his pocket and replacing it with a 3D-printed .22, popular with people with these kinds of hobbies, and pressed it into the man’s fleshy forehead, pulling the trigger and cussing when it broke off, falling on the ground next to a pool of a few rogue sinews and blood.
“
I guess you lucked out today, but now you’re dead, okay? I killed you, got it? So get dead, disappear, or I’ll come back for real, I swear to God,” then kicking the frozen, shaking lump of a man for good measure, upset when the anticipated wailing that usually followed this kind of encounter never came.

He was going to tell him again that if he didn’t disappear, he’d come back, but he was sure he got the message.
As he turned to leave, he saw the man’s red, flat-tipped “don’t trip” hat and said, “I’m keeping this too.”

The man just continued to look at the ground, waiting until his attacker went away.

And he did, but not without telling him one more time he was doing him a solid: “I could have killed you alright, okay?” he asked, expecting no response and not being disappointed with the expected outcome of that verbal encounter.

So, just then his voice got unnaturally loud, and he blurted out, “Get dead, okay? For both our sakes,” then as he started to leave, the huddled-up mass of flesh spoke low but loud enough to be heard by the two of them in that one shared moment, “Some game, huh?”

His attacker just nodded, caught up in the trajectory of making a clean escape as he repeated the words to himself, “Yah, some game.”

The blood from the separated thumb slowly soaking a silver dollar sized hole, like a reverse sponge, staining his back pocket as he left casually but with purpose.

Chapter 2
The trial 
As Mr. Jackson continued to drone on about god knows what, she knew why they nicknamed him "grey noise."

The words and sounds that continued to escape his mouth produced an almost sleep-inducing effect, causing her eyes to get heavier and heavier, so that when the pencil fell out of her half-clasped hand, she was almost in between a much-needed sleep but so on edge that even the light resounding thud of the pencil on the grey padded carpet was enough to jar her out of whatever momentary escape she had gone to, 

clinging to the few seconds not caught in a reality as chemically unbalanced as her brain, now in its fourth year of being fed happiness in pill and powder form—the only regret that she hadn’t stumbled onto this form of coping much earlier in her life.

She honestly was miserable, not content with how that feeling felt but without enough hope needed to either pull oneself out or do the only sensible thing and stop the tape.

Fingers crossed that the grand director or whoever is running the show, this show called life, has a sense of humor and will allow for non-positive feedback.

Lately, she felt completely numb, and not just a side effect of the opiates, uppers, and highly alcoholinated mouthwashes, not even concerned that before a new mouth-freshening product could even be considered to take home, it must be checked for alcohol content.

And it wasn’t that getting so messed up time felt movable and fluid; it was also the perfect antidote for an anxiety that’s not merely a disorder but more of a secondary lifestyle that accompanies those with superior intellects but inferior motivation.

God might not have a sense of fairness, but he has a very believable motivation and a specific skill set.
Why do I bring up God, you ask?
Ruining a perfectly good introspection with Catholic guilt?

Because you have to want to know what that feels like, at least for her sake; if not, she won’t even get a chance at a fair character representation; you’ll only see the after skipping past the before picture of one who birthed something so sinister  and labeling them guilty by creation.

Just because a man makes a bomb, is he responsible for the chaos the bomb inflicted?
You might not agree, but your verdict is more than just an indictment of her and what she built; it’s a representation of what bad people do to kind-hearted geniuses pushing them.
Yes, people were… affected.

Affected and embalmed by what she made, and those were the lucky ones; if you’re not changed by raw human cold, sweating, hard-beating pain, then maybe you should be on trial.

He nodded at Sara, giving the jury one last brainwash, letting his opening remarks settle in.

The courtroom was cold, not a climate condition but a mood forced upon by a girl who tried to change the world by piling up casualties and making them examples.
