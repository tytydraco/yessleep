Something I just stated I have a vision of where I want to take this without going where everyone thinks it might if you want to hear more let me know. Any and all feedback is welcome 

He couldn’t believe what he was doing.
A year ago, if you told him he’d be with the white-haired fat man, talking himself up enough to steal the man’s thumb by force, he might have believed you.

He was reckless and liked ending up in weird situations, but he’d have had questions.

Tonight, after chasing the white-haired fat man down and knocking him unconscious with the broad end of the flashlight, there would be no questions, only actions.
He gritted his teeth as he held down the man’s wrist, pressing the thumb into the meat of the three-day-old Wendy’s baked potato.

Then, before the man could regain consciousness, he lifted the knife, aligning it with his shoulder, and brought it down hard, severing it almost with an almost surgical precision, muttering to himself, “Damn it,” when the thumb hung onto the remaining flesh, refusing to separate.

But with another quick, deliberate slice, it was properly detached, though looking like a jagged puzzle piece that had been ripped out of place, the little cardboard-like fold of skin flapping like an eel placed on a cutting board.

He let go of the potato, letting it hit the ground, but grabbing the thumb, wrapping it quickly with an old gym towel.
The man, now fully awake and caught between shock and grief from unexpected loss, sat up, stifling his tears and reaching into his black leather doctor's jacket, pulling out his cell phone.

The man grabbed the phone, putting it in his pocket and replacing it with a 3D-printed .22, popular with people with these kinds of hobbies, and pressed it into the man’s fleshy forehead, pulling the trigger and cussing when it broke off, falling on the ground next to a pool of a few rogue sinews and blood.
“
I guess you lucked out today, but now you’re dead, okay? I killed you, got it? So get dead, disappear, or I’ll come back for real, I swear to God,” then kicking the frozen, shaking lump of a man for good measure, upset when the anticipated wailing that usually followed this kind of encounter never came.

He was going to tell him again that if he didn’t disappear, he’d come back, but he was sure he got the message.
As he turned to leave, he saw the man’s red, flat-tipped “don’t trip” hat and said, “I’m keeping this too.”

The man just continued to look at the ground, waiting until his attacker went away.

And he did, but not without telling him one more time he was doing him a solid: “I could have killed you alright, okay?” he asked, expecting no response and not being disappointed with the expected outcome of that verbal encounter.

So, just then his voice got unnaturally loud, and he blurted out, “Get dead, okay? For both our sakes,” then as he started to leave, the huddled-up mass of flesh spoke low but loud enough to be heard by the two of them in that one shared moment, “Some game, huh?”

His attacker just nodded, caught up in the trajectory of making a clean escape as he repeated the words to himself, “Yah, some game.”

The blood from the separated thumb slowly soaking a silver dollar sized hole, like a reverse sponge, staining his back pocket as he left casually but with purpose.
