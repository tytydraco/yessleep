This update is shorter than the first one, but it was too odd to wait until next week. If you didn't catch what started this whole thing, here is [Part One](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/z1kdi2/i_work_at_a_coffee_shop_my_boss_offered_me_a/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).

\--------------------------------------

So after I posted the events of my first day at The Drowsy Spectre, I went to sleep. It seemed wise to me to keep to my work schedule so that my mind and body would train more quickly to a new daytime sleep pattern. Right after posting, I became too tired to stay awake. That post was made late Tuesday night (or Wednesday morning, if you prefer). When I woke up though, it was Tuesday afternoon. That didn't make any sense, however, as I just had an entire day off. All of Tuesday already happened. Yesterday could not have been Monday. The post was made Monday night, so there was evidence, which was impossible since I was on shift. What on earth? It makes no sense at all.

I got a text from a number I didn't recognize. The contents identified the number as Selene's, who must have gotten mine from Richard. It read;

"Hey did anything weird happen to you"

"Like what?" I didn't want to out myself and rant about an entire day having not existed.

"A whole day being gone"

That saved me the embarrassment. "Yeah, sort of."

"Same for everyone working Monday night. Richard is going to call you"

None of her texts had punctuation at the end. I was half way through a text when the call came in. Selene's texts suggested that Richard might have some sort of answer, or at least have something to say about the strange experience.

"Hey Axel. How are you?" He did not sound happy.

Not very good, but I wasn't going to say that. "Good, thanks. You?"

"Good, good. Hey, so Selene said the first day went well. That is good. There seems to be... an issue, however. What day was yesterday?"

I didn’t want to get in trouble, so I answered with what I knew. "Tuesday."

"That's what the rest of last night's shift said. Yesterday was Monday and it turns out the store didn’t open at all on Monday and I have some angry… customers making complaints. But don’t worry about that right now. Listen, Axel, I got a question for you. You saw some stuff last night on your shift, stuff that shouldn't be real; are you... normal?" That was a weird question, but he explained. "Like, are you a human, I mean."

"Uh..." How is someone supposed to answer that?

Apparently my hesitation was answer enough. "Yeah, sorry I asked that. You must have caught on by now, I hope, that there are some things that come in that aren't people. Not normal people, at least. I just had to check."

"Have you hired any... non humans?"

"Listen, I might need you to come in Wednesday night." Question dodged, or better yet, completely ignored. "Someone called in sick and I need a fresh pair of eyes on the Wednesday shift. When people get used to a place, used to people, they stop noticing the flaws. Maybe a dirty corner doesn't catch their attention because it's been dirty for a while. You get me?"

"I guess." Not really. "I'd be happy to take the shift."

"Well I need you to take a look at the store with unbiased eyes. Tell me if you see anything strange, something that stands out so badly that anyone with a brain should be able to spot it. Can you do that for me?"

So... use my eyes? "Yeah, I can do that for you."

"Great, great. Anyways, let me know what you see and give me a call around 9:00pm. I'll handle the rest."

‘Handle?’ The Drowsy Spectre was weird, but Richard was weirder. "Yes sir." Before he could hang up, I had to ask. “Richard, what happened to my Tuesday?”

"Listen, don’t worry about that. I’ll figure it out.”

“Yes sir.”

“Thanks. Alright, bye."

In a way, that was sort of his catchphrase. He always ended calls the same way. Anyway, I found this entire situation worth mentioning. I did some research about "lost time" and could only find stories of alien abduction. Look, I'm being forced to believe in the supernatural, but that doesn't mean aliens are real too. I wasn't abducted, I am certain of it, and I'm sure aliens would have been mentioned in the new-hire packet if they were hanging around. No, something else happened and I can't find anything about it. I'll try to make a post this weekend about Wednesday's shift, assuming I don't get killed. Maybe I'm lazy, but I don't feel like writing on Thanksgiving. Do I have plans? No, unless you count Waffle House. Thank god for the skeleton crew.

\--------------------------------------

I was about to post this but wanted to get some water before giving it a once over. The front door to my apartment has a large window on top. I could have sworn I saw a face looking at me, one that darted away as soon as I saw it. Only... I was on the second floor, the balcony outside looked over the parking lot, and that face was too far away to be on the balcony. Crap, that was Tall Ben, wasn't it? The rules said nothing about him coming to my house! I went to the window next to the door and peeked out. The apartment complex is shaped like a large 'L,' taking a turn to my left and going straight ahead.

It was him. I could see his lanky, tall form hiding behind the other end of the complex. There were people down there in the parking lot that paid him no mind at all! He knew I could see him, I was certain of this when he waved at me. He waved at me! Then, as if we were old pals, he pointed a thumb at a park down the street. If it weren't for street lights, the park would be in total darkness. Even with the lights, it was barely visible. Was he inviting me to a children's park?

I shook my head. Honestly, when his shoulders sank, I felt a little bad. This was some sort of demon, some monster, why did I feel guilty? He just seemed like he wanted someone to hang out with. Maybe, since the rules about Tall Ben only mentioned the coffee shop, it was safe to go outside. I could speak with him, get questions answered that only something of the unnatural world could know. This was an opportunity, a trade; I could give him the socialization he needed, while I'd get answers to my many questions about anything cryptid.

Something wasn't right, I wasn't thinking for myself. I was being... pulled. No, inspired, that is a better word. Thinking about it now, it was incredibly foolish to open the door. It would be even more stupid if I would have stepped out. Thankfully, my mind returned to me the moment I saw Tall Ben RIGHT outside my door, leaning against the balcony, ready to do who knows what to me the *moment* I stepped outside. He looked so eager. So... hungry? I couldn't tell. Maybe he wanted to eat me, or maybe he was just really excited to spend time with someone. I lifted a foot.

And thankfully his widening eyes forced my foot back down. I am not that stupid, even when someone else is in my head. But it should be safe to talk to him, assuming I don't go outside, right?

"Who are you?"

"I'm Ben, man. You know me. Want to grab a drink or something?" He was acting like one of the guys, as if went way back. "Well? I'll buy."

That was an offer that was hard for my poor ass to refuse. "Well, if you're buying, then- Wait, no! I've never met you before. What are you, exactly? Why did you follow me to my house? They didn't say anything about you stalking any of us."

"Just wanted to catch up, honestly. Didn't mean to come across that way. Honestly, I'll tell you everything. It is great weather out here, just the right amount of chill to be refreshing. You know I can run a six minute mile? I could show you, man. We need to catch up! Hang out!"

That was pretty fast. Damn him, of course he could run that fast, he was a giant! "I. Don't. Know. You."

"Selene, tell this guy to get out here. We haven't talked in ages!"

I wasn't going to peek my head out, but Tall Ben looked to his right (my left) as if there was someone there. I did my best to look down that way without exiting the doorframe and, to my surprise, I did see Selene there.

"Come on, Axel. We can make it a date. Ben's a bit of a big third wheel, I know, but it'll be fine."

A date? I hadn't been on one in- "No, no! The rules were clear."

"The rules for the shop, you idiot. This is different!"

Why would Selene come to... "Wait a second. How did you find out where I live?"

"I just asked Richard, of course!"

"Richard doesn't know. I didn't put down my real address on my application." That was true, thankfully Richard didn't verify it. Why did I do that? A story for another time.

Selene relaxed, losing all expression, then slowly deflated. She poured, like putty, underneath the balcony railing and vanished completely. That was very high on my list of the most terrifying (and grossest) things I have ever seen.

"Worth a try." Tall Ben sighed.

"That was disgusting."

"Just come outside, man."

"Why would I do that?"

"I don't know! Come on, it could be fun."

"Yeah, I am going to bed." I began to close the door.

I expected some sort of protest, some new scheme to get me to step out, but all he did was wave an arm and say; "Lame."

\--------------------------------------

So yeah, that happened. I wouldn't have taken the job if I knew that some monster was going to harass me at my own apartment. Richard should have told me, warned me, said *something* about the nature of The Drowsy Spectre. Selene, Barrow; someone could have warned me! I didn't break any rules on my first shift. Although, it seems as if my first shift never really happened. I don't know how any of this works. What I am certain of, however, is that I will be getting some answers from Barrow or Selene on Wednesday. Whatever answers I get, they'll be written here.

Wish me luck. And if some guy is peeking through your window, inviting you to a dark park, don't open your door. God, I am stupid.
