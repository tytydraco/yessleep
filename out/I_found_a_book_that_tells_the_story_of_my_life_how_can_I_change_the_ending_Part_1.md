I went to a book fair on Friday and felt drawn to a plain red, leather-bound book with my first name printed in black on the cover. I laughed to myself thinking maybe I'm a little conceited being drawn to something simply because my name was on it, but I bought it anyway. Since reading it, I keep asking myself would I prefer to have never found this? To not know what was coming so I could have continued living as normally as I can, while I can? Or am I glad to know what to expect? Maybe try to prevent it? *Can* I prevent it? And my biggest question of all, who wrote it?

I started reading it on the bus going home from the fair, it didn't take long to realise this book was detailing my life in story form, including accurate dates. I felt the blood drain from my face as I read the exact story my parents had told me umpteen times about my traumatic birth, the book had every detail correct down to the date, time, hospital and my parents names. I felt dizzy as it went on to describe the first time each of my family members met me, including my Grandfather who died in an accident a week later.

Further chapters tell intimate details about my life and I have no idea how the writer could know any of it, my disaster of a first kiss to the time my parents caught me smoking. It even details events that I have never uttered out loud, such as the time I stole a chocolate bar from the corner shop as a kid, I felt so guilty I went back the next day and left a pound coin on the counter when the shopkeeper wasn't looking. It's like I've had someone watching over my shoulder my entire life writing it all down, but why? I have had a pretty uninteresting life, nothing of significance has ever happened to me yet someone has recorded every moment within a novel.

Obviously I have not put the book down since I connected the dots, when I got to the ending last night my blood ran cold and I vomited. You'd think the story would end before I found the book because how could it possibly go past that point? But no. I read about myself going to the book fair, buying the book and realising the story was about my life on the bus. How could the writer have known these details to add it in before it had even happened? This is what has me completely freaked out about the ending.

According to the writer, I was so engrossed in the book I didn't notice a man at the back of the bus carefully watching me, I also didn't notice him get off at my stop and follow me to my home. Where apparently he has been watching me, from the tree line in the park across the road since Friday. The book says that in a weeks time this man will ambush me and brutally murder me, that my body will never be found and my family will never know what happened to me.

I've called the police and told them I was concerned someone was stalking me and that they were watching me from the park, they have checked the park and told me they have found nothing of concern. They have asked me for any proof of the stalking and of course I have nothing, so they're not taking me seriously anymore. I can't exactly tell them a book told me someone is stalking me, they will think I'm crazy or that I wrote it myself. I'm scared to tell my parents as I know they will rush over here and I am worried that I will put them in danger. I don't know what to do and I wonder if I'm insane for even entertaining that this could be true. All that keeps rattling around in my head is that the book has been accurate so far, so why wouldn't the ending be accurate too? At least if he does kill me, I've got my concerns about a stalker on record so my family should get some idea as to what happened after I die. Will this change to the story be enough to change the course of what's going to happen?
