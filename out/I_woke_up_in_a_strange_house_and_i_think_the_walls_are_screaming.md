Let me preface something first off, this computer is not my own, I know not who's house this is, nor do I know who's account I'm posting on, what I do know is when I awoke a few minuets ago, it was on the floor of a room that is strange to me, its somewhat sparce, with the only furniture consisting of a bed, one chair and a desk, of which a computer lies upon. I am currently typing on said computer, as when I booted it up, it opened on this reddit page, so I'm recounting todays(?) events on here in the hopes that one of you may know what is happening.

  
Let me take you back (what I hope to be) a few hours earlier in the day. I live in the town of West Hollow, its a somewhat smaller town in the English midlands, not as big as places like Birmingham, but not as small as Coventry, with a population of roughly 437,000 people (I mention this now as it will help paint a picture of my situation later.) 

It all started with a phone call, I was on my break period at work when I received an invitation to go out later that day, it was my best friend, Ebony's 21st birthday and we had made plans for our small circle of friends to go to Frankie and Benny's for dinner, some of you will be familiar with the restraint chain and its outright heinous prices, but it was a favourite of ours. Well Ebony had called me to let me know that we would be leaving earlier than planned as we were going to go to the bar afterwards for a few drinks

Fast forward to the end of my shift and I'm getting ready to meet up at her house, I'm walking down the fairly busy street (It's around 5pm at this point so everyone was heading home from work) when the first peculiar thing happens. As I'm walking along the street, I see a flash for a second only just come into my peripheral vision, of course I just brush it off at first as it could be anything, what made it strange though was the further four times I see the same flash along the 20 or so minuet walk to Ebony's place. When I get there, she and our other friends Jess and Kevin are waiting for me, we waste no time and call a Taxi to ferry us into the Town Centre.

  
When the driver picks us up, we have a pretty uneventful 15 minuet ride and eventually arrive at the restaurant. The second weird thing to happen was when I exited the Taxi, the driver said ''Hope you have a fun night tonight Liam'', thinking nothing of it I just smile and said thankyou before he drove away, it was only a few seconds later when the thought hit me... how did he know my name? i was positive nobody had said it in the Taxi as all my friends refer to me with my last name instead of my first, i started to think more about it but was interrupted by my friends, eagerly discussing what they would have to eat and so i started thinking too, disregarding my prior thought as another easily explainable thing, perhaps my friends had said my name and i forgot, either way, still a pretty weird thing to say as a Taxi Driver.

  
We all eat our meals, pay the bill (which was overly high as usual with this chain) and started hitting up clubs, its at this point where I'm still a little fuzzy on what happened, but we started bar hopping and when we hit up our 3rd bar of the night, Neon Glory, the time had come for me to ''break the seal'' as it were, it was then that it happened. Whilst using the urinal, another guy walked in to do his business and he broke the number 1 rule of the gentlemen's bathroom, he used the urinal next to mine. Luckily i had finished up and headed over to the sink to wash my hands when the man started talking to me. He started saying things such as ''You know, i think tonight will be one to remember'' and ''Me and my friends are having so much fun, we've been planning this for ages'', somewhat uncomfortable, i assumed he was just drunk and trying to be friendly, after all, who of us haven't said random stuff when pissed. It was when he said something along the lines of ''Your help will be greatly appreciated'' i went to pay more attention to him, i went to look back at him to respond, but that's where everything goes dark on my end, and the next thing i know, I'm in this room with a huge headache.

I don't know what happened, but the bruises on my knuckles indicate a fight, and what i hope to be someone else's blood on my clothing, all i know is that I'm in a strange room, in a town of 437,000 people, i could be in any building and could have been taken by anyone, my hopes of being found are low but please if you can help me, anything at all, please try...l because I'm not alone... I think i can hear the walls screaming, or whatever lies beyond them, and i think i can hear someone walking up to the door
