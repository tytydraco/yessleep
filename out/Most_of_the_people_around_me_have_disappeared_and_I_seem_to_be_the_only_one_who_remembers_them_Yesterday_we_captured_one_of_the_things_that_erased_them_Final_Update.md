*“It...he tricked me. I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to guide it to you."*

The Grift crawled down the wall.

*“Remember- it craves a perfect unity. The pervasive absence of existence.”*

It scuttled across the floor at an incomprehensible speed. Low to the ground, he placed both hands at the tip of her right foot.

*“Don’t give in.”*

He wrenched his fingers apart, and her foot split in half. I could see her blood. The bone. The muscle. None of it spilled out. His form collapsed - flattened as if his body had been converted from three dimensions to two. Silently, he burrowed into Dr. Wakefield.

Once he was fully in, the halves of her foot fell shut.

The imprint of his face crawled up her leg from the inside. Her body writhed in response: a standing seizure. His hooked nose looked like a shark fin as it glided up her neck.

Finally, the imprint of his face disappeared behind hers, and the convulsions stilled.

She looked at me, and a smile grew across her face.

I thought of the man I’d kidnapped. Somehow, he was important. We both were.

I needed to get to the sound booth, but she was blocking the path.

The whistling started again.

Sure, there was fear. I felt a deep, bottomless terror swell in my gut, but the memory of Sam neutralized it. I was consumed by rage imagining what it did to him.

At the end of the day, my anger was hungrier than my fear.

Whatever it was, I prayed that invisible barrier would protect me,

And I sprinted towards the Grift.

\- - - - - 

Despite being a steadfast atheist, I’ve always enjoyed religious stories.

Not for the lessons in morality, and certainly not for the glorification of humanity. There isn’t a stronger neurotoxin than the belief that any of us were *“chosen”* to exist. After all, if you truly think you're the center of our cosmic narrative, then any action is justifiable, right? The main character always has time for redemption; act three is always somewhere around the corner.

But I digress.

No, I enjoy religious stories because they make me feel seen. The whole of me: the good and the bad. The wicked and the virtuous. Because I’m both, and I identify with both sides of the coin - the protagonist and the antagonist. You see, purity is a lie. None of us are one or the other. We’re all a patchwork of sin and grace. Existence is beautiful dichotomy. We kill to create. We live to die. We perform evil acts for good reasons, and the righteous things we do often have evil ends. We are all both Christ and the Antichrist.

With one exception.

The Grift.

It has no duality. It is completely pure. It is existence’s foil - absence incarnate.

The insatiable hunger of emptiness given form.

And now that it’s here, I’m not sure what there is left for us to do.

\- - - - - 

The man I kidnapped at Dr. Wakefield’s request remembered the erased. So did I. There was something important there. We needed to stick together.

I don’t know what I expected, bolting full-tilt at the thing dressed in Dr. Wakefield’s skin, but I expected *some* sort of resistance. Snarling teeth, or sprouting tentacles, or a psionic offensive. Just…something. But it gave me no such resistance. 

The Grift smiled at me, hands at its side: world-eater abruptly turned pacifist. It even shifted a few steps to the side, graciously opening the path between the cathedral proper and the recording studio. The concession gave me pause, but maybe that was the intent, I considered. Maybe it wanted to infuse doubt. It seemed to feed on confusion.

Or maybe I was a gibbon speculating about nuclear physics. The Grift was some incomprehensible cosmic entity: who *knows* why it does what it does, so what chance did I have to understand it? 

I hugged the corner, creating distance between me and the Grift. It watched me pass, but it didn’t lash out. The antechamber to the sound booth had a peculiar scent: sweet but metallic, the fragrant honey of a living machine.

It was the scent of blood, of course. 

An hour or so prior to that moment, I’d mangled two of the captive’s fingers by repeatedly slamming the door into them, but that memory didn’t resurface until it was too late. In the interim, I’d witnessed an eldritch being shed Sam’s skin like a layer of caked mud, throwing gray clumps of him to the floor with ruthless abandon. The violence I inflicted may has well have occurred eons ago.

I’d seen the Grift - but Vikram, our captive?

He’d simply been in that room, disfigured and fuming, just waiting for me to return.

I…I don’t know exactly what to say here.

I just wasn’t thinking straight.

The legs of the heavy end-table scraped against the floor as I heaved it out of the way, and I slammed my body against the door.

A poorly timed flash of déjà vu struck me. When I’d interrogated Vikram, he’d asked a peculiar question:

*“What would you have done if I had been hiding next to the door? I could have pressed my body against the wall. Waited for you to come in. The door would have swung into me. You think you would have figured out where I was quick enough?”*

As I flew into the sound booth, I attempted to vocalize a slipshod white flag of surrender.

*“Vikram! I was wrong, and we - “*

My body pivoted with the hinges, peeking around the edge to visualize the corner quickly becoming hidden by the door, expecting to find the captive lurking within the newly enclosed space, but he wasn't there. No, I'm fairly confident he'd been hiding on the *opposite* side of the room. 

He was a clever man. He got into my head. Nearly as well as the Grift had, honestly.

From outside the sound booth, I heard that voidborne deity commandeer Dr. Wakefield’s throat to twist the metaphorical knife: a bit of theatrics to light the waiting fuse.

*“Hurry Vanessa! Kill him.* ***Kill the Grift,****”* it screamed. 

I couldn’t see it grin, but, God, somehow I could *feel* it.

A muscular forearm wrapped around my neck.

I flailed and thrashed wildly, trying to strike Vikram.

I attempted to speak, to explain, to let him know I’d made a terrible mistake, to tell him we’d been manipulated, played for fools since the very beginning - I simply didn’t have the air. He had my larynx practically flattened.

It wasn’t clear whether he was intent on killing me. Maybe he was going to choke me out only long enough that I lost consciousness.

But I couldn’t risk it.

As my vision dimmed, my hand shot into my pocket and procured Sam’s knife.

I flicked my wrist and deployed the blade.

He swiped at the weapon, trying to dislodge it from my grasp, but the only hand he had available was the one I’d previously mangled. His digits were horrifically crisscrossed, forming an “X” of broken flesh. It didn’t have enough power to stop me.

I just wanted him to let go so I could explain.

I just meant to stun him, incapacitate him - get him *the fuck* off of me.

The knife slid into his thigh with revolting ease. 

His grip on my neck loosened. Warmth gathered over the small of my back, as well as the cusp of my hand. Sticky dew trickled down my skin like melting candle-wax.

He fell backwards, and I gasped a few ragged breaths. Constellations of stars spun around my dazed head. Once my equilibrium stabilized, I spun around to assess his wound.

That’s when I noticed we had an audience.

The Grift wearing Dr. Wakefield’s skin stood between the antechamber and the cathedral, not having moved an inch. But there were more, and they lacked disguise. A pair crawled across the wall, feet and palms silently interfacing with the stained glass. Another handful lingered in the antechamber - standing ominously, sitting on the dusty leather sectional, leaning against the wall - observing us with a disconcerting intensity. The closest one had its head peeking over the top of the doorframe, eyes perched along the termite-eaten wood, locks of hair limply hanging down. I couldn’t see the rest of its body. Presumably, it was stuck flat on the ceiling, concealed within the half-foot of space not visible from within the sound booth.

Excluding Dr. Wakefield, they were all perfectly identical: a legion of men with short brown hair, narrow eyes, and hooked noses.

The stillness was suffocating. I felt like my gaze was the only thing holding them in place.

But I needed to see what I'd done to Vikram.

I needed to bear witness to the consequences of my blind trust in Dr. Wakefield.

Tired bones and aching muscles clicked my neck to the side.

The only other person who remembered the erased had become a human-shaped raft adrift in a lake of crimson. Whatever internal architecture Sam’s blade had eviscerated, it’d been important, apparently. His eyes were open but glazed over, staring at the wall. Even in his final moments, he couldn’t stand the sight of me.

I understood why. 

I felt a profound shame as the potential point of all this clicked. 

This man and I, we were different. We remembered. That protected us: meant the Grift couldn’t touch us, couldn't *erase* us. Not yet, at least.

So if it couldn't erase us, why not orchestrate a situation where we'd do the work *for* it? 

This intersection was planned out from the very beginning.

Somehow, it created circumstances where we'd be pitted against each other, and, for the first time, I found myself pining for the Grift’s merciless dementia.

I wished I could just forget.

Without warning, the legion descended on us.

Their movements were imperceptibly quick and almost piranha-like in their ferocity, swarming around me and Vikram’s corpse, vicious blurs that whistled as they spun. Whatever barrier separated us and them, they were attempting to push their way through it. There was pressure. So much goddamned pressure. I wanted nothing more than to join Vikram on the floor - to give up completely and be devoured - but the legion’s assault kept me fixed upright, pressure on my chest and abdomen counterbalanced by equal pressure on my back. They were desperate to break through the threshold. I watched their faces ripple back as they fought, like a Pitbull’s head stuck outside a car’s passenger-side window going sixty miles an hour, jowls flapping in the wind.

Time seemed to slow. 

The onslaught took on a hypnotic, dance-like quality. My panic dissolved. My worry evaporated. I become one with the rhythm and whistling, the push and the pull.

I’m not sure how to quantify what came next. 

Maybe it was a stress-induced hallucination. Maybe I was on the precipice of death or erasure, teetering. Maybe the Grift reached into my mind, or maybe my mind reached into its.

In the end, I suppose it doesn’t matter.

The passage of time suspended completely. 

One of them was in front of me - smiling or weeping or laughing, it was always so hard to tell - petrified mid-attack. I don’t know what compelled me to extend my fingers towards the Grift. It felt right, or, more accurately, it felt like I had no other option, so it was right by default.

My nails met its skin, its poor excuse for a shell, and I peeled it back like I was opening a book. Its tissue creased without resistance. Inky blackness poured from the resulting hole. It was small, the size of its face, but paradoxically as massive as the entrance to a cave. 

I knew I could fit, so I crawled in.

The tunnel stowed within the Grift seemed to extend infinitely. I attempted to breathe, mostly out of habit, but found myself incapable. Wherever I was, there wasn’t an iota of oxygen nearby, but, curiously, that didn’t appear to be an issue: I pushed on all the same, without the burning of oxygen-starved lungs. Obsidian emptiness surrounded me in every conceivable direction, including below. I didn’t fall, though. I believed I would. Multiple times. Still, I remained safely confined within the bounds of the tunnel.

Minutes turned to hours, which then turned to days.

I wasn’t deterred.

At some point, the encircling blackness became dappled with fragments of faraway light. The pearls weren’t a comfort or a guide, but they were an agreeable change of pace. The tunnel seemed to have no turns, or cliffs, or inclines, so I was free to focus my gaze on the dim specks of light, drinking in their quiet charm to help the time pass as I mindlessly crawled forward. 

Millions and millions of tiny pearls stripped of their oysters, shining for me and me alone.

Days turned to weeks, which then turned to months.

I soon began to detect the faintest of echoes of a melody in the distance, and I knew I was getting close. Though to what, I couldn't be sure.

I'm calling the noise a melody, but only because I don't have a better word for it. Which is to say this: it wasn’t beautiful like a melody. Nor was it heavenly, or blissful, or radiant. I think that’s because it wasn’t crafted to be enjoyed. That doesn’t mean the sound was entirely separate and unrelated to music as we understand it. There was something recognizable within the notes. It was the music before there even was music to speak of: an ancestor.

The melody was beguiling, like music - it just wasn’t pleasant to listen to.

Slowly, the notes became louder. More alluring. Significantly less tolerable: an atonal mess, devoid of rhythm, blaring from the heart of this endless miasma. I picked up the pace, sprinting on all fours like a starving coyote. At first, the noise was just uncomfortable, but it wasn’t long until that discomfort morphed into frank pain. The throbbing in my head rapidly spread across my entire body like a violent flu.

Panting, frenzied and feverish, I hunted for the source of the melody. After what felt like months of nonstop forward momentum, I tumbled off the outer edge of the tunnel into something new.

I careened face-first into a hard, flat surface with the consistency of glass. A low groan spilled from my lips. I put my palms on the floor and pushed myself up. From what I could discern, I appeared to be in a transparent, cube-shaped chamber, a few stories high and long enough to squeeze a commercial airplane within its boundaries.

It was the heart of the endless miasma.

And I wasn’t alone.

There was a man at the opposite end, pacing frantically, whispering to himself in a harsh, guttural language I didn’t understand, sporting a wispy, violet-colored cloak that perfectly matched his violet-colored blindfold. It took me a moment, but I recognized the texture of the language, even if I couldn’t comprehend what it meant.

It *was* the melody.

Something on the ground caught my eye: ovoid and gleaming with flickers of pearly light.

An egg of sorts.

Instantly, I leapt to my feet and began bolting towards them.

For reasons I have difficultly describing, I was helplessly enraged.

One of them *needed* to die.

The skin of reality was blistering and bleeding on account of their indecision.

The flesh and the bone and the marrow were surely next.

Fury swelled behind my eyes. 

I wasn’t sure *precisely* what I’d do once I reached them.

But I knew it’d leave one of them dead.

Seconds away from having my hands clasped around his neck or my foot above the egg, he noticed me.

Then, I was subjected the full, unbridled horror of the melody.

Before I could even blink, I was repelled: forcely rejected from the heart of the miasma, driven from that transparent cube at an impossible speed.

My consciousness cascaded through the tunnel.

I finally closed my eyes.

When they opened again, I was in the sound booth, with the Grift smiling in front of me. After what felt like months of endless travel through dim and dark spaces, I was back in that room, still besieged by the swarm, those goddamned locusts.

The passage of time resumed without ceremony, but something was different. I was different.

I still wanted to lay down and die like Vikram, yes, but I now realized that wasn’t an option.

It was like the tunnel.

The only way out was through.

I pushed back against the whistling swarm, their merciless pressure, and forced my body forward.

Dr. Wakefield had been manipulated, just like the rest of us, but I prayed she was correct about one thing.

I prayed that the mirror we’d hung on the back of the door could harm it.

To my surprise, I took a step forward.

Then another.

The ones that were trying to dig their way inside Vikram noticed my resistance. They moved away from him to push back against me.

Despite their cumulative efforts, I took another step.

My trembling hand reached out to pull the mirror down. Once my fingertip touched the reflective surface, their buzzing abruptly ceased. I stumbled forward and collided with the corner of the room, not anticipating the quick release of pressure. I ripped the mirror from the wall, placed it front of my body like a shield, and flipped around. 

They were clustered in the opposite corner, packed as tightly as they could, watching me intently but otherwise silent. Gradually, I inched my weathered body out the door.

I need you all to know something.

I wanted to take Vikram with me.

I wanted to give him a proper burial.

It was just too risky.

Once I was back in the cathedral, their buzzing resumed. I could only see Vikram’s legs via the open doorway, but I watched as they spun around his body, pushing hard against the invisible barrier, trying to break through it. 

I’m terrified of what they’ll learn if they succeed, and the one wearing Dr. Wakefield's skin was nowhere to be found. 

\- - - - - 

I’ve been on the road for the last few days. Leaving Georgia, I’m surprised at how normal everything looks. People going about their business without a care in the world.

Will they be as blissful when the Grift arrives for them, too?

I grabbed Dr. Wakefield’s laptop before I left the church. There’s a label on it with a barcode and an address, only a few states over. If anything comes of the trip, I will post an update.

In the meantime, I have two questions.

Does anyone else remember the erased?

And does anyone else hear the melody? 

Because I do now. All the time. 

It’s been calling to me, and I think I could find my way back to it, to the heart of the miasma, if I wanted to. 

I would just need to open someone up, crease their skin like the edges of a book,
