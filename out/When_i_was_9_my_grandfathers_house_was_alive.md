[Part 1] squatters rights


When my grandfather got divorced, he didn't take it well, and after all the court proceedings were done and everything had been finalized, he just stayed alone in his house for months. I don't think being alone in a big house was good for him, though; I mean, I don't think it's good for anyone really. I've always preferred smaller houses; the big ones felt like museums or hotels. They gave me the feeling that I really shouldn’t stay too long. I guess grandpa felt that too because after a few months he moved to a double-wide flat on his property and stopped taking care of the big house. It stayed like that, just rotting and growing, for almost 20 years. 
 


When my dad started talking about going out to Grandpa's to clean up the big house. I, of course, wanted to go with him. Being a 9-year-old in northern Appalachia, I was always kind of outdoorsy, and Grandpa's house was in the middle of a beautiful forest that stretched for miles in every direction. At night I would look up at the stars and make binoculars with my hands to try to see heaven. I never did, but that sky was pretty close.
 


In hindsight, I don't really know why my dad let me come with him; it's not the best idea to bring a little kid into a 100-year-old collapsing house with hermit trash and 20 types of black mold, but despite that, I ended up right behind him as we walked in the front door. 
 
 

When the door opened, it let out this terrible rusty groan that reverberated through the house; it was so loud it shook my whole body. That held my attention for a little bit, but then I noticed the smell; it was a primordial funk that had fermented and distilled for 20 years until it became something closer to an emotion than a smell. At the time, I thought it smelled like teargas, but I was 9, and I didn't know what teargas smelled like, so I was probably wrong. The second thing I noticed was the unrealistic amount of trash. There were piles in every corner, covering every surface. Some piles towered over me, and I thought they might swallow me whole. Even at 9, I thought it was way too much for Grandpa to have accumulated in his months as a shut-in, but I chalked it up to him being a hoarder, and we started to go through the house room by room and get an idea of what we were dealing with. 
 


You know how sometimes if you're walking with another person and your footsteps are just out of sync enough, it can sound like there's a third person walking with you? I remember having that feeling multiple times as we walked from room to room, but I just brushed it off because it was a big house and we had a lot of ground to cover. When we finished our tour of the ground floor, we headed to the second floor. I remember my dad pausing for a little too long when he got upstairs; the only reason I remember that was because I got annoyed waiting behind him, and I was anxious to see more of the creepy old house. He muttered something under his breath, then walked in.
 


The second floor was cleaner than the first, and it was much more open with the stairs leading into a large central living room and one hallway with 2 bedrooms on either side. But those didn't matter to me because in the corner of the living room there was a bed—well, kind of a bed. It was 6 mismatched couch cushions arranged in a rectangle, and I remember it reminded me of something I'd make for a pillow fort, which I thought was awesome, but next to it was an old Coleman grill, a pot, a few cans of chili, and expired pet food. 


My dad said, “I thought no one lived here,” 


and I remember thinking it was dumb because obviously no one lived here; Grandpa already said that. But either way, all of the stuff looked like it hadn’t been used in a while, so I guess my dad assumed the owner of the pillow fort bed was gone.
 


We finished checking out the second floor, and I was heading for the third when my dad sternly informed me it was a bad idea as the floor had already collapsed in several places, and if I went up there, it was my fault if I died. I had been looking forward to the third floor and was disappointed that it would have to wait, but I did what I was told and went downstairs. The trash wasn't actually that bad downstairs, mostly just weeds and old food cans, but it still took us well into twilight before we only had some moldy furniture left and decided to start on the second floor. It was a lot darker up there, and I convinced my dad to let me use his super expensive flashlight. He'd gotten it from my mom on their anniversary, and we both thought it was the coolest thing ever. 



After about an hour of work upstairs, my dad told me he was tired and we should call it a night. But part of me still wanted to see that third floor; something about it felt like it was calling to me. As my dad was leaving, I went over to the steps and looked up. You can imagine my confusion when I saw my dad standing on the top step. I went to go up after him, excited to see what was up there, and then I paused. He's too short,  I thought. No, he was crouching. I couldn't see very well because of the darkness, but I could tell he was looking down at me. Then I heard the tearing bellow of the front door opening. And when I looked back up to my dad, I saw him slip back into the darkness. I was horrified; I turned and sprinted out of the house. I exploded through the front door down the porch steps, and I fell onto the damp evening grass. 



I heard my dad say something like, “Isaiah, are you okay? What happened?” 



And as the gears in my head began to spin again, I had a funny realization, and I started to laugh at my stupidity. No one lives in that house; Grandpa said so, and I had already assumed there would be some kind of animal living there so it was either that or my imagination. I told my dad I just wanted to race back to the flat.
 

[Part 2] Flashlight
 

 When we were walking back to the flat, I had the feeling that I had done something wrong, but I didn't know what it was. Then I realized, the flashlight—I had dropped it when I ran downstairs. It was still somewhere in that house, and if I lost it, my dad would kill me. When we walked inside and greeted my grandfather, I could feel a quiet terror squirming in my spine. And I knew I would have to go back in.
 
 

I didn’t sleep that night; I couldn't get my mind off that house, and I was dreading having to explain myself, so I worked up the courage and convinced myself that I could go in and grab it before anyone would notice I was gone, and if I was going to go, it would have to be now. The sky was so beautiful that night it soothed my nerves like the sedatives they mix into a lethal injection. When I got to the front door, I was hardly afraid at all.
 
 

The omnipresent roar of the front door announced my entry to the house, and I figured it was probably loud enough to send any animal into hiding. I could feel the house shifting in that silent night. I didn't realize it was so quiet until I started to hear my heartbeat in my ears. The first floor was just how we left it: just dirt and couches. So I went up to the second floor, confident it would be a short endeavor, still unshaken by the opaque darkness.
 

 
 I saw the flashlight immediately when I hit the last step. It was right there, waiting patiently for me next to the banister. I picked it up triumphantly; I didn’t notice the heavy breathing. I was too excited to have my flashlight back. When I flicked on the light, I froze, fossilized in place by fear, my mind refusing to let me comprehend the danger I was in. Standing just a few feet in front of me was a man. He was tall and slouching; his ribs were showing through his ripped shirt like there were trying to claw through his pale kin, his ashgrey hair hung down past his knees in thin whispers, his brown teeth stood patiently in his hanging jaw; his hungry eyes, already consuming me. 


His throat cracked and popped as he spoke like it was the first time he had done it in years, he said, “Come over here.” 


Those words, like cold water, snapped me out of my trance and forced my body to move. I ran as fast as I could out of the room barely staying ahead of the roaring tarantula catching up to me. He sounded like he had too many legs. i could hear his skittering getting closer until I felt his damp breath on my neck. When I crossed the threshold of the front door, I felt my hair slip between the starved fingers on his hand. Some instinctual part of me said he was trying to pull me back into that silent night and devour me. I knew he wanted to pick my bones clean and i knew if i stopped for even a second he would have his wish. I didn't stop running until I got back to the flat, and for a while I could still hear him pacing and grunting outside like a rabid dog waiting for a baby bird to fall from a tree. I was so paralyzed I didn't even wake my dad; I just sat on the floor and waited till I heard the familiar downbow of the rusty hinges. My exhaustion overwhelmed me, and I let sleep claim my weary mind.
 
 


In the morning I woke abruptly to the sound of my dad getting up from the futon. I was still consumed with fear; I could barely tell my dad what I saw. 


All I told him was, “Last night I saw a man in the house.” 


He was confused and tried to ask more questions, but I just sat there, consumed by my own thoughts, unable to look up from the floor, his voice drowned out by the memory of what the man had said. Eventually he gave up trying to question me and just started hugging me and telling me I was ok. He ended up talking to my grandpa about it, and they decided to check the trail cameras my grandfather had on the property. They were old, and it would sometimes take a while to record after the motion sensor would go off, so they weren’t always reliable, but after they looked, my dad told me we had to go, and Grandpa would come stay with us for a while. In the backseat of the car on our way off the property, we passed the house; the front door was wide open, calling me to go back inside.
 

My dad wouldn’t tell me what he saw back then, but I’m 25 now, so I asked him about it. He told me he wished I had forgotten that, but nonetheless he told me.


“He was looking at you through the window all night. He didn't move an inch until sunrise.”.


Being alone in a big house for a long time does something to a person. I'm glad I never stay long.
