My wife has been in an in inpatient unit for a few weeks now. It breaks my heart, but we can’t currently have her at home. I’ve been juggling zero paternity leave, taking care of the baby, taking care of her, and just trying to survive this hard time for my family. I wanted to share her journal entry that staff shared with me in hopes that it may help another family recognize the signs and, more importantly, the risks, sooner than I did.

*06 February 2024*

I’m a new mom, but I don’t know where my baby is.

I hear phantom crying at all times of the day, and all hours of the night while I lay in a strange bed, in this cold and sterile room, unable to sleep. That shrill, incessant, terrible noise constantly claws at my eardrums. I feel the blood seeping slowly out of my ears, and these people keep telling me there’s no blood there, but I know they’re lying. They’re lying directly to my face. They don’t care about me. They want to see me suffer.

There’s no baby to soothe. It’s just me here, and my kidnappers who come in sometimes. I want to clamp my hands over my ears as tight as they will go until I can both hear and feel my own heartbeat, but I know nothing can block out the crying. I couldn’t cover my ears anyway, because they have me chained up.

The people who took me are not kind. They are bad, bad people. They poke me and prod me. They leave me here laying in my own filth. They come and clean my bed and then just leave me once again, ignoring my cries and my pleading to please for the love of god let me out. 

Once in awhile they let me out of my shackles. They chain me back down when I fight back. I managed to get a chunk of hair off of one of them; I didn’t see that one again. She was crying when I ripped the stupid hairs from her skull, but why was she crying? She’s the one who took me away from MY baby. 

I don’t remember when I got here. I can’t fathom how they managed to take me. I don’t remember my baby’s face. I remember my husband, and I hate him. That son of a bitch just stood there and watched as they carted me away while I was screaming and thrashing, attempting to break free. I remember pretty lights as they threw me in the back of their van. The van is where the torture started. They shoved needles into my arms and injected me with things. I blacked out, and when I came to I was chained to the bed in this unfamiliar room. I spent what felt like days, weeks, months awake, staring at that disgusting brown patch on the ceiling, being driven crazy by the drip drip drip of the broken faucet in the corner and the never ending sound of an inconsolable baby. I just wanted to find that stupid kid and shut it up once and for all. I couldn’t listen to another second of that unending crying anymore.

I know they’re watching me. I can see the cameras they have all around me. I think they’re experimenting on me because whenever they come in they inject me with unknown liquids that make me feel funny. That make me feel enraged. That make me lose time, lose memories of what it is they’re doing to me. 

There are other victims here. Sometimes they make us see each other. Some of the others are more calm than I am. They must be the ones who have been here the longest. They’re even nice to our assailants. They chat with them and laugh with them, and I don’t understand it. Why would you be friendly with these people? We should be working together to find a way out. 

I decided they must be pretending, so I decided to pretend too. They must be on to something because when I play nice they’re more lenient. Today they let me have some paper and a pencil, but a dull one, probably anticipating that I may shove it into one of their jugulars at the first opportunity. Not only are they bad people, but they’re idiots too. They kidnapped me and thought I wouldn’t use this opportunity to tell people the atrocities I’m suffering at their hands? They thought I’d just continue to sit back and take it, and tell no one?

I called my husband yesterday to tell him how much I hate him. He told me they’re just helping me. What an awful man. They’re not helping me. He won’t help me. I wonder if he ever loved me; I seriously doubt it. I’d never let something like this happen to someone I love. He keeps telling me I might hurt my baby, but I would never do that… but I do want the crying to stop. It just never does and sometimes I feel so angry that I’d do anything to end it. But I’m not a danger. I wouldn’t hurt my baby.

I don’t know where I am. I am so, so scared that I will never get out and need to continue to endure this unrelenting torture. I have no hope of getting out. The windows are bolted shut and there are bars on them, further cementing that this is a prison sentence. This must be a professional criminal organization. They have me. Someone please, please save me. I just want to see my baby. I need to know he’s alright.
