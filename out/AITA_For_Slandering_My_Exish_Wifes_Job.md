Hey, so I gotta be honest here. This whole situation has got me feeling lost, and I don't know how to process it all. We've been happily married since 2011, met in college, and it has been pretty smooth sailing. We hardly ever have serious fights, just the usual stuff like me forgetting to take out the trash. Our routine was simple: work during the week, chill together at home, do things we enjoy like gardening or reading.  
  
About a year and a half ago, my wife, super smart neuroscientist, got really into sleep. She believed it had a deep impact on us beyond surface level. So when she found this new retreat in Tennessee, she was over the moon. It was supposed to be this whole experience that integrated technology and medicine into sleep and was supposed to “revolutionize” the way humans dream. I checked out their website, and honestly, it seemed like bullshit. Some interesting bits, but mostly excessive. Still, I didn't want to hold her back, so I encouraged her to go.  
  
When she came back, everything had changed. And I mean everything. First, she stopped saying "I love you." It used to be her thing, but she just cut it off. Then she got really into meditating. At first, I thought it was just a new relaxation habit, but now she spends HOURS meditating every day. I can't help but wonder if she's doing it to get away from me or something. And the worst part? She started treating me like I'm nothing. Barely looks at me, ignores me when I try to talk. It's like I don't exist.  
  
I have no clue what happened at that retreat. Maybe she met someone else or had some mind-blowing experience. All I know is that things went downhill from there. I tried expressing how I felt, telling her I wanted to work it out, but nothing got through to her. I got frustrated and started yelling, which only made things worse. Then, I made a huge mistake and asked if she wanted a divorce. I wish I could take that back. Maybe things would be different now. But she took me up on it, moved out immediately, and even landed a job with the retreat's parent company. Go figure.I haven't even been able to sign the divorce papers yet.  
  
That's when I went down the wrong path, I think. I blamed the retreat for everything that happened. I called them, hoping they could shed some light on what went wrong. But they refused, citing privacy concerns. So, I resorted to leaving some nasty reviews, calling them out on every platform, spreading shit about them. The worst part? I got a cease and desist letter. I had to delete all my accounts. It's a mess, and I regret it all. I hate that I've lost my wife, and I'm questioning if I'm actually as terrible as I feel. Am I the asshole here?  
  
If anyone else has experienced something like this with that damn [retreat](https://www.somn-us.org/sleep-retreat), please, please reach out. I can't be the only one, right? I've asked around, but no one seems to know anything.
