There's this incident that occurred in 2005, in the Gushan District of Kaohsiung, Taiwan that ended up being the inspiration for a horror film called Incantation. There's little to no news source outside of Taiwan, and what few sources we do have create an inconsistent picture of what happened.

It also appears to me that there are contradictory retellings of this story thanks to the sparse amount of solid sources, so take everything I'm about to post here with a grain of salt.

When I first heard this story, I couldn't sleep properly for days. It must be my fragile mental health. But I am sharing this with you here because as far as anyone outside of Taiwan is concerned, this story *needs* to be told, lest someone else experiences something similar, something that may have been prevented.

In 2005, a family of six with the surname of "Wu" resided in Kaohsiung City, Taiwan. The dad was a 56-year-old painter, the eldest daughter, Wu Fengjuan, is a nurse, and the others had their own jobs in the catering, hairdressing and printing industries ([https://www.laitimes.com/en/article/3qros\_47goc.html](https://www.laitimes.com/en/article/3qros_47goc.html)). In February 2005, the youngest sister claimed to be possessed by the deity “San tai zi,” who the family worshipped for many years (The LaiTimes article claims this entity, also known as the Third Prince of Nezha, "borrowed her mouth" or something). Under possession, the youngest daughter claimed that the oldest daughter, Wu Fengjuan, was also suffering from demonic possession and needed to return home immediately.

The mother heeded the warning and brought the eldest sister back, but upon returning home she claimed to have bad dreams about being r\*ped. She became too scared to sleep at night and only slept during daytime as a result.

On the 2nd of March, 2005, she received a phone call. No info is available as to who called the eldest daughter but after she got off the phone she too began claiming she was possessed by another entity: "Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara." Under possession, the oldest daughter claimed to want to dispel the evil for the world through her and also began committing acts of self-harm. According to the LaiTimes article, the family took her to a temple for an exorcism, which ultimately failed.

Upon returning home from the exorcism attempt, the rest of the family claimed to be possessed by various entities: the father claimed to be the Jade Emperor, the mother called herself the Queen Mother, the eldest daughter was Guanyin Bodhisattva, the second daughter claimed to be possessed by the Seven Fairies, the younger daughter was the Third Prince of Nezha as we explained earlier, and the son was allegedly possessed by the Living Buddha of Jigong, whoever he's supposed to be.

The most messed up part of this is that while the family believed themselves to be possessed by various gods from Taiwanese folk religion, they believed EACH OTHER to be possessed by demons who were actually disguising themselves as these benevolent deities. Let me repeat for those who got confused: All six family members were claiming to be possessed by these various gods and goddesses from Chinese folk religion but each of them believed that they were the only one possessed by a deity while everybody else was possessed by demons.

Under this delusion, the Wu family members began to self-harm and beat each other, throwing rice and salt, urinating and defecating on each other and even force-feeding themselves their own feces!

A month into this madness the family members somehow began to think that by starving themselves, they could starve to death the entities possessing their bodies. They only consumed holy water as sustenance. The neighbors heard what was going on, but were too scared to help or even call the police.

At a certain point, also unknown in this already-disturbing saga of events, the family began to focus their violent beatings all on the oldest daughter, whom they were convinced was demon possessed and to be the instigator of this entire mess. As a result, Wu Fengjuan died on April 9th. However, the family didn't think it was their daughter who died but the demon who possessed her.

To make things even crazier, the mother soon claimed to be possessed by her daughter's spirit. Eventually they realized the eldest daughter was in fact, dead as a doornail, and so they deposited her body at a hospital before fleeing into the night. She was found the next day by medical staff reporting for duty that morning. What's even weirder is that after everyone realized the eldest daughter was in fact dead, they snapped out of their stupor and regained their sanity.

Police were called, and upon investigation, it was discovered that the whole house had transformed into a poop-smeared mess. According to some news reports, the sight even frightened the cops, who responded by placing a Taoist protection instrument of some kind in the police station.The family was not charged with murder, per se, but rather "Reckless abandonment of an individual, resulting in their death". Police forcibly sent the family to a psych ward for questioning but the staff there were unable to determine what could have triggered this spiral into madness.

The case remains unsolved to this day.
