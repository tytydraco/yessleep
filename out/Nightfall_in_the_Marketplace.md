On a warm and sunny spring day, Colton found himself trapped in a crowded marketplace, crowds of people moving around him like a river. He felt lost and out of place as if he didn't belong there. The buildings and streets were very familiar, the architecture around him was neat he could see the carvings in columns, the graffitis on the walls and the features on everyone's faces were clear, including children playing under the fountain water, crowds of tourists taking selfies, and people speaking different languages. His mind was as clear as ever and his senses were more focused than before. He could also hear the distant wail of sirens and the hum of machinery in the shops. As the day progressed, the sun grew hotter, and Colton felt as though it was burning everything, but the people around him seemed oblivious to everything except their daily routine. He started walking around, hoping to find something to help him blend in, but to no avail.

As the day wore on, the pink sunset disappeared, and night began to fall. Colton's world was about to change. The moon rose into the sky, bigger and brighter than he had ever seen before, casting an eerie glow over everything. As the moon rose higher, the people around him began to change. The children's laughter turned into bloodcurdling screams, the tourists' smiles twisted into grotesque grins, and the people's faces contorted into horrifying expressions.

Colton's heart pounded as he realized he was trapped in a nightmare. The air grew thick with a putrid stench, and Colton noticed that the ground was slick with a dark substance. The people around him transformed into humanoid creatures, each more terrifying than the last. The creatures could sense his fear and estrangement. Walking past him, the creatures gazed into his shattered soul through his gloomy eyes. Some smelled his fear, while others were thirsty for his blood. Colton tried to run, but the ground felt like holding him in place. He could feel the creatures' hot breath on his neck, their talons scratching his skin, their tongues licking his sweat. He screamed, but his voice was drowned out by the creatures' howls.

Colton was no longer a stranger; the creatures had recognized him and started following him. Colton tried to run away, hordes of creatures followed him, waiting for him to trip or make an abrupt, out-of-place move. He ran through the streets, hoping to escape this nightmare, but the creatures were always one step behind him.

Colton's lungs felt like on fire, he had run for miles and was soaking with sweat. All hope seemed lost, and Colton began giving in when he saw a shimmering light in the distance. As he got closer, he realized it was a portal, a way out of this nightmare world. Colton ran through the portal with hope, and everything around him dissolved into darkness.

When Colton finally regained consciousness, he found himself back in his own world, safe and sound. Despite his relief, he became consumed by the mystery of how he had ended up in that strange, mirrored world. He scoured countless websites, searching for someone who had experienced something similar, but his efforts proved fruitless. As the years passed, his obsession only grew. Little did he know, the mirrored world was biding its time, waiting for Colton to return and claim its only surviving victim. Years later, on a warm and sunny spring day Colton was out for a walk with his wife and children when he inadvertently stepped on the same cobblestone that had transported him before. In an instant, he was back in the marketplace, which he recognized with a sinking feeling. Desperate to escape, Colton walked for what seemed like days, knowing that the coming nightfall would bring unspeakable horrors. Despite his determination, he was weaker and older this time and eventually stumbled and fell. The creatures pounced on him, tearing into his flesh and drinking his blood. His screams echoed through the streets, but no one was there to hear them. The next morning, the marketplace was bustling with activity, but no one noticed the absence of Colton like he had never existed. His screams could still be heard at night when the moon was at its fullest and brightest.
