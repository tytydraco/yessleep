I don’t know if anyone will see this. I’m sitting on the floor somewhere I can’t even begin to describe, and I don’t know if I can get out. I’ve never been one to believe in the paranormal, but after this… I don’t know what’s real anymore. I’m hoping someone out there can give me some guidance, or at least tell me if they’ve ever heard of anything like this. This is my first update—I’ll try to keep posting if I can.

This all started three days ago. Just an ordinary Saturday afternoon in October. I was at home, alone, in my small house outside Duluth, where it’s quiet and isolated. My closest neighbor is a few houses down, but we don’t talk much, and I’m used to being on my own. Around 1 PM, there was a knock at the door. It was strange, especially since I wasn’t expecting anyone, and I rarely get visitors. For some reason, I didn’t answer. I just didn’t feel like talking to anyone, so I ignored it and went back to my day.

It was a little later, when I went to grab a drink from the fridge, that things stopped making sense. When I opened the fridge, I saw it—a door. Not behind the fridge, but inside it, set right in the middle of the shelves. It looked old, ancient even, with splintered wood and a handle barely hanging on. I knew it hadn’t been there before. There was no possible way a door could fit inside my fridge, let alone appear out of nowhere. My heart was racing, but I couldn’t look away.

Almost on instinct, I started pulling the shelves out, clearing the way until the door was fully visible. Every part of me was screaming not to open it, but I couldn’t help myself. I reached for the handle, turned it, and stepped through.

I barely remember deciding to go in. It felt like my body moved before my mind could catch up. And the second I crossed the threshold, I knew I’d made a mistake. I turned around, but the door was gone. Instead, I found myself in the middle of a long, narrow hallway, dimly lit and lined with faded wallpaper. My stomach dropped, and I could feel panic clawing up my throat. I had no idea where I was.

I tried to retrace my steps, hoping I could find my way back, but every door I opened led somewhere else entirely. And none of it made any sense. One moment, I’d be in an empty office building, with rows of abandoned desks and dust hanging in the air. I’d walk through a door, and suddenly, I’d be in the middle of a dense forest, silent and still, with no sky above me—just an endless, flat ceiling stretching overhead.

Nothing connects. Every area I walk through feels completely different, but they all share this heavy, unsettling silence. Yesterday, I found myself in a vast ballroom, its marble floors gleaming, reflecting chandeliers that flickered without any visible source of power. My footsteps echoed, but they weren’t the only ones. I’d stop, and the footsteps would stop with me, but every so often, I’d hear one more echo, just a half-step out of sync, as though someone was walking just out of sight.

Today, I wandered through what looked like a hospital corridor, the walls lined with doors labeled by faded room numbers. Some rooms were empty, some had beds and equipment left untouched, but everything felt off, like a set in an old movie that hadn’t seen life in years. I opened a door at the end of the hallway and found myself standing in my own living room—but it wasn’t right. My furniture was there, but it was covered in dust, the air thick with age. It was like stepping into a version of my house that had been abandoned for decades.

The worst part is the feeling that I’m being watched. Every time I stop to rest, I feel it—the prickling sensation on the back of my neck, the creeping certainty that someone is standing just out of sight, waiting. But I’m always alone. Sometimes, I think I see shadows moving in the corners of my vision, but when I turn, there’s nothing there. Once, I could’ve sworn I heard a whisper—my own name, carried by some invisible draft. I called out, hoping for a response, but the silence that followed felt even heavier, almost like it was pressing in on me, waiting for me to make a wrong move.

I’m running out of food, and my water is low. My phone battery is almost dead, but I’m using what little I have left to post this. If anyone has any advice—anything at all—I need help. I feel like this place is a maze designed to keep me wandering forever, but I’m afraid if I don’t find a way out soon, I’ll just… disappear.

There’s something else I haven’t mentioned. I keep finding versions of myself—old shoes I know I used to own, a coat I recognize as mine, hanging on a hook in one of the rooms. I even found my watch, the one I lost a year ago, sitting on a dusty table in the middle of an empty library. It’s like this place is collecting pieces of me, little by little, and I don’t know why. I’m scared that if I keep moving, I’ll eventually find something I can’t come back from.

If anyone reads this, please, just tell me I’m not going crazy. Or if you’ve heard of anything like this before… anything at all. I feel like I’m slipping away here, piece by piece.

This is my first update—I’ll try to keep posting if I can, but I don’t know how much time I have left.
