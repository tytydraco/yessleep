Yeah, it was the night after those UFO hearings. Remember those? Just a couple of weeks ago. If you don’t remember, well… then you gotta pay more attention to the news.

Around that time, there was this increase in sightings. No surprise, right? People are talking about UFOs, that means people are going to convince themselves that they’re seeing ‘em. More lights in the sky. More mysterious figures in farmer’s fields. That kinda shit.

Anyway, this whole summer, the hardcore scene here in Hamilton, Ontario was ramping up to something special. I don’t know why or how, it was just a feeling at that point. The shows had been tight. The pits had been rowdy, but not overtly violent. Seriously, I think there was only one major fight and that was at Corktown because they fuckin had their hardcore-slash-metal night upstairs on the same night as a country show downstairs. Those two scenes taking smoke breaks at the same time? Oil and water, man. Oil and water.

It just felt like something special was coming. It was a magic summer. Field of Dreams shit, y’know?

Then, one night, the stars aligned.

Local hardcore shows don’t usually have any pyro or even decent lighting, especially not if you’re playing outdoors, but Dead Venom was supposed to play in August as part of their North American tour except, get this, their visas got rejected. Thing was, all their equipment still made it to Hamilton. I guess the tour management got some wires crossed.

So all this shit is just sitting around at the Bayfront auditorium and then Dead Venom’s management sends the word out real quiet-like and what they’re saying is “you know, right now it’s just a loss but if someone were to steal that shit then we could claim it on insurance.”

Rusty Teeth was like “say no more”. They’re a local band. My friend Rachel is their drummer.

Anyway, the band walked into Bayfront after closing and walked out with about 300lbs of pyrotechnics and strobes and other shit. They couldn’t use that stuff anywhere close to the city, not after this venue – I think it was Kill Room -- got popped for something as stupid as not having a liquor license or whatever. Way too risky.

So they hit up an abandoned farm 15 minutes outside of town. You know Rusty Teeth’s bassist is an apprentice electrician, yeah? The stage just needed to be close to a power hookup they could hijack.

Boom. It’s on. About 500 show flyers later and the entire scene is drawing straws to figure out designated drivers.

I got to the field early to help set up. You know I love that audio tech shit. I’m laying cable, tying ‘em together with zipties. Soundchecks. Also, I thought they might let me blast some of the pyro as part of the test, which they did. That shit is HOT. I don’t know how Gene Simmons’ makeup doesn’t melt off.

So the show starts after sundown and it’s just as much of a rager as we all expected. It’s going DOWN. I’m talking 200 moshers at least after only TWO songs and people are still showing up because there ain’t no capacity limit in a field. Rusty Teeth can’t even believe it, this is turning into a fuckin stadium show.

And they aren’t crumbling. They’re playing up to the expectations. It’s almost like the bigger the crowd gets the more seriously they’re taking it. Band-Aid – that’s the singer, he’s going by Band-Aid now – isn’t even drinking beer. He’s drinking water. Keeping his voice hydrated.

The joy is off the charts. This is what the scene was waiting for.

But the best was yet to come. See, Rusty Teeth, they’ve got this grand finale planned. Their biggest hit, everyone’s fave. If you’re ever in Hamilton you might hear it blaring from a car stereo. It’s called “Fuck My Feet”. They’ve got all the pyro rigged. They’re just waiting for the right moment.

They finish a song and there’s dead silence for a few seconds. Band-Aid turns to the guitarist and nods, which is the signal. He explodes into the opening shred of “Fuck My Feet”. The pyro starts blasting. The strobes are flashing. The lights are blinking blood red and bruise purple. Everyone goes nuts. It’s pandemonium. Within seconds the headbangers, the two-steppers, the slam-dancers – everyone – is enveloped in an absolute earthquake of a pit.

I was right in the middle, fighting for my damn life. Elbows and knees traced comet tail arcs through the air, landing with meteorite impact on the soft spots of other dancers. A dozen people doubled over with violent joy and pain, only to bounce back up a moment later, limbs swinging.

As I threw myself and was thrown, I kept feeling a pair of small, soft hands rubbing against me.

You get used to this shit at hardcore shows, not that it makes it any more acceptable. I started throwing elbows at what I imagined to be the owner of those invasive, nasty hands.

“Get fucked you perv,” I shouted as a blow hit home. The hands jerked away.

Then they came back. It’s like, get the message you creep. I threw some more elbows – left, right, left, right. I’m not sure how many made contact, but eventually I didn’t feel the hands on me anymore. 

So I’m enjoying the music, kinda wishing I had brought earplugs, and I start to notice, like, aren’t there more lights than there’s supposed to be? I helped with set up. I should know. Also, does the air seem… thicker somehow? Like right before a thunderstorm, the clouds getting closer to earth causes the pressure to skyrocket. Give my mom headaches.

The last note of Fuck My Feet rings out over the crowd. Everyone is already screaming, begging for an encore. Rusty Teeth obliges, says they’ll be back in 5 minutes.

The pit started to clear.

Then, a single high-pitched scream cut through the night. I spun around.

There, in the remains of the mosh pit, a small gray body was laying face down. Not moving. Its soft head, large and olive-shaped, was dented in a dozen spots by obvious blows.

I touched my elbows. My fingers came away wet with a blue fluid. The same blue fluid that was slowly pooling around the extraterrestrial corpse, not even soaking into the earth beneath it.

Everyone was staring at me. At my elbows.

“I thought he was just a little guy,” I said, and you know how loud and screechy I get when I feel threatened. “I thought he was just a little pervy guy!”

A low thrumming, lower even than the lowest notes on Darren G’s bass, began to pulse through the venue.

“A little weirdo,” I was shouting now. “You know! A little weirdo perv!!!”

A massive object began to reveal itself in the sky, its cloaking device draining off it like rain running along a car window. A bright light beamed down, encircling me. The few moshers who hadn’t yet backed away from me were now skittering out of the light like cockroaches.

“Do you have pervs on your planet,” I shrieked up at the craft. “Do you???”

You ever think about, like, different perspectives and shit? Like how the dopest local hardcore show this town has ever seen might look, from above, like the lights of a landing pad for an alien ship? Like how the pyro and strobes might be a sort of unintentional semaphore language saying “touch ‘er down right here”?

Then those aliens beam down a representative expecting, I dunno, a normal welcome from a peaceful race and, instead, they get absolutely pulverized into interstellar ground beef by the entire Hamilton hardcore scene.

And then you think maybe, just maybe, those pervy hands feeling you up were actually pleading hands, begging hands, the hands of a dying alien just looking for someone to help them escape the pit.

You ever think about that shit?

So I’m spotlighted and everyone around me, they’re all gawking up at the spaceship, but also sorta backing away, just leaving me stranded alone on that island of light.

The ship is lowering, lowering, lowering, and all I can think is “I’m fuckin screwed” but then… there’s this fizzing noise and a loud pop and suddenly everything goes dark. The ship broke the hijacked powerline, which blew the strobes, amps, the whole set up, but it also must’ve blown the ship’s spotlight.

It was like everyone snapped back to reality at once. Absolute chaos. Screaming, crying, people running for their cars and bikes using only the starlight to guide them.

I didn’t need an invitation. I ran like hell, jumped in someone’s backseat, I don’t even know who’s, and tried to stay out of sight until we were back in the city.

So now there’s been sightings of lights in the sky all over the world. That lady that was cut in half in Iowa? And In BC they found these hikers that had been, like, turned inside out? A scientist in the arctic circle got jellified while out digging ice cores. He looked like one of those aspics your grandma makes for holidays.

Then I saw the before photos and… fuck man… the Iowa lady and one of the hikers and that scientist? They ALL looked a hell of a lot like me.

So yeah. I’m not sure who actually dealt the killing blow to that lil gray cocksucker, but I’m not taking the fall for that, no way. Staying indoors for a bit. Til the heat dies down anyway.

Still, it was a great fucking show though.
