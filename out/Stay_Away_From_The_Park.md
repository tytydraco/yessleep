Last week, I agreed to meet up with my friend at midnight. It was a spontaneous decision, sparked by a late-night conversation about how we hadn't done something adventurous in a while. We had just reunited after finishing high school, having gone to different ones, and we decided to go to the park—a familiar place where we used to hang out and catch up.

We arrived at the park around midnight, the air cool and still. Usually, a large map at the entrance detailed the trails and paths, but tonight it was missing. The park was unusually dark, with the lights that typically illuminated the pathways completely off. It struck us as eerie and unsettling, but we shrugged off the discomfort and decided to explore further.

We walked down the main path, the gravel crunching under our feet in the darkness. The deeper we went into the park, the more unsettling it became. That's when we started noticing them—clothes, scattered everywhere. There was a grey long-sleeve shirt slumped over the barrier on the side of the gravel path. A pair of jeans was draped over a bush, and a red jacket hung eerily from a tree branch. There was no rhyme or reason to it. It was like someone had emptied out an entire wardrobe into the park.

We kept walking, our pace a little slower now, eyes darting around to take in our surroundings. As we ventured further, we kept finding more clothes. There was a pair of jeans draped over a low-hanging branch, a colorful scarf twisted around a bush, and even a lone sneaker lying in the middle of the path. The further we went, the more it seemed like the park had turned into an eerie, open-air closet. Each step felt heavier, the air colder, as if we were walking into the unknown.

We decided to push forward, even as the uneasy feeling in the pit of my stomach grew. Jorge and I continued along the path, the night air growing colder with each step. It wasn’t long before we spotted more clothes—shirts, pants, even a pair of sneakers—scattered haphazardly around. Just as I was about to suggest turning back, I caught a glimpse of something in the marshy water off to the side. For a split second, a figure stood there, partially illuminated by the dim moonlight. It had a humanoid shape, but something about it was off—its proportions were strange, giving it an uncanny valley effect. I froze, my breath caught in my throat, and when I looked again, the figure was gone. Jorge, noticing my reaction, whispered urgently, "Did you see that?"

Jorge and I agreed that turning back was the best choice if we wanted to stay alive. We retraced our steps towards the park entrance, but Jorge suddenly froze. "Hey, my phone's missing," he said, his voice tense as he checked his pockets.

I frowned, glancing around. "Man, we literally covered half the park. The only way back is either around the trail or through the pond. And honestly, I don't think you wanna go  through that pond considering we *just* saw that thing in the marsh."

We tried to push on, but the trail seemed to stretch endlessly before us. The darkness around us grew deeper, and despite our best efforts, the familiar landmarks that had guided us before were nowhere to be seen. "What the fuck, dude? This park isn't even a full block big, and I don't see the entrance," I muttered, a chill creeping up my spine.

Despite our growing unease, Jorge and I decided to keep moving forward. Sitting ducks in the middle of the park didn’t seem like a good idea. We continued along the trail, the path seemingly endless. My heart pounded in my chest, and every rustle of leaves made me jump.

Then, I started to notice something strange. I could hear footsteps behind us, almost in sync with our own but slightly off. It was subtle, but enough to set my nerves on edge. I turned slightly towards Jorge, mouthing, "Stop walking. We're being followed."

We came to a halt, and in that moment, I felt something bump into me. It wasn’t like bumping into a person; it felt more like colliding with a stack of sticks or a frail, thin wall. It was as if I had run into something insubstantial yet unsettling. I screamed and spun around, but there was no one there. Jorge’s eyes were wide with fear, matching my own. We stood there for what felt like an eternity, straining our ears for any sound, but there was nothing.

After a while of more walking, the footsteps seemed to disappear. The fear that had gripped me started to lessen, but a chill ran through me. I reached to zip up my hoodie, only to realize it was gone. My heart skipped a beat. How could it have just disappeared?

Panic started to set in again, and we quickened our pace. As we turned a corner, my breath caught in my throat. There, in the middle of the trail, was a scarecrow-like figure, wearing my hoodie. It stood eerily still, its form barely visible in the dim light. My blood ran cold, and I felt a shiver run down my spine.

Panicked, I grabbed Jorge’s arm and pulled him to sprint in the opposite direction, deeper into the park. We tore through the darkness, our breaths coming in ragged gasps. The fear drove us faster, but the park seemed endless, the trees and shadows blending into one another, making it hard to tell if we were actually moving anywhere.

After what felt like an eternity of running, we finally stopped to catch our breath. The fear of being followed had subsided slightly, but we were still completely disoriented. I looked around at the unfamiliar surroundings, realizing we had no idea where we were.

“We need to mark our path,” I said, trying to keep my voice steady. “We’ve already seen how the clothes are scattered everywhere. Let’s use our clothes to mark where we’ve been.”

Jorge nodded, still catching his breath, and we began to strategically place our clothing items along the trail. I tore my tank top in two, draping one piece over a nearby fence and the other over a low branch. Jorge threw his shirt onto a nearby tree branch. We kept moving, leaving behind a trail of our belongings to track our way back.

We stumbled through the darkness until we finally spotted a tall fence with barbed wire at the top. It was our only hope.

“Jorge, we need to get over this!” I shouted, panting heavily.

Jorge boosted me up, and I grasped the top of the fence, preparing to climb over. I was just about to swing my leg over when I saw Jorge jump to grab my hand. As he reached up, his foot got snagged by something—a branch twisted in the shape of a hand. It yanked him down with a powerful force. I heard his scream—frantic and filled with terror—as he was dragged into the bushes and swallowed by the darkness.

I dropped to the ground on the other side of the fence, my heart racing and my hands shaking. I ran, desperate for help, ignoring the pain of my cuts and bruises.

When I returned with a group of people, the park was eerily normal. The clothes were gone, the scarecrow was nowhere to be seen, and Jorge had vanished without a trace. The park was as calm and serene as it had always been.

The police, skeptical and concerned, treated me as a delusional madman. I was arrested and charged with Jorge’s disappearance and presumed murder. They dismissed my frantic pleas and the story of what had happened.

As I sit here in my cell, I find myself scribbling this letter. It’s all so surreal—my sense of reality has fractured, and I’m left with nothing but this story. I am a patient in a psychiatric ward, and perhaps this is my last attempt to make sense of the nightmare that has become my life.
