I remember moving on endless spiraling stairs. I felt like I would be walking on them forever. Part of me was not sure if it was a dream or reality. Maybe I had been walking on them this whole time, and everything else I thought had happened was really the dream.

But the dream faded, and I woke again, in the same barren room I had just earlier gasped back to life in. I saw Sherrie when my eyes focused. She had a small bottle of water and was raising it to my lips.

“Drink something. I know you might not want to see more water right now, but you are probably dehydrated. Almost drowning in salt water certainly didn't help. So no more swimming for a while, doctors' orders.” She flashed a smile at me to try and lighten the mood.

I managed a weak nod and tried to sip some water. I felt exhausted, despite having been sleeping for who knows how long. I managed to sit up all the way and get a better look at the room we were in.

The place was devoid of any real architecture. It was little more than a stone square. The only things in the room besides us were my recovered backpack, a green rucksack that must have been Sherrie’s, and an odd protruding handle, which may have been part of the only door leading out of there.

I asked the question that I had to ask, but feared the answer.

“Where are we?” Sherrie’s face darkened, and she looked thoughtful for a moment.

“Well, it's hard to explain. Unfortunately, we are still on the stairs right now. This is sort of an unused room or oubliette. We are relatively safe here if we are quiet and lucky enough to avoid the attention of certain things that live here. There are a handful of creatures that could give us some trouble if they found the door, but I don’t think any are close at the moment.” Her eyes shifted to the exit instinctively, then she looked back at me.

“Sorry. Like I said, it’s safe enough. Just don’t yell, and if you hear a ringing in your ears, cover your eyes and ears, hide in a corner and don't listen. Oh, and maybe pray to whatever higher power you believe in for deliverance.” She chuckled at the morbid statement, but she looked away nervously as she laughed, leading me to believe that specific anecdote might have happened to her recently.

I decided to save the question of how she knew about that for later. Instead, I asked a few others,

“How did you know about the noises of those blind things and the water?” She regarded me thoughtfully and responded,

“Well, after I found out you had escaped the first time, I had to try and help again. This place changes constantly, even though it looks the same at a glance. Sometimes useful patterns can be gleaned; you just have to pay attention to what happens and when. I knew that when there are new people, and the grabbers don’t get them, the smell they leave behind causes the blind ones to show. As I’m sure you are no doubt familiar with now.”

She flashed an apologetic smile as the name immediately reminded me of the horrifying blind monsters that nearly slaughtered me earlier.

“Yes, we had a run-in before my little swim.” I acknowledged grimly.

“Yeah, they are more dangerous than the grabbers, but are easier to predict and avoid, assuming you are careful enough. I tried to warn you in the message, but I was in a hurry and had.....other things to take care of. As for the water, well, that one is weird. But I guess there is sort of a tide, just like a beach. It rises below in the lower levels from somewhere. I don’t know exactly how it works, but the blind ones know when it is coming. So, they start signaling the rising waters. It is a warning, since salt water seems to burn them like acid. They will only risk going near it if there's potential prey.” She looked at me with sympathy, cleared her throat, and continued

“Anyway, I’m glad I found you in time.” She looked down at her hands as if she was remembering something concerning, but did not want to speak about it just then.

“How did you find me? Not just now, but last time as well. Did you know I was here? Could you see what I was doing?” She paused thoughtfully, considering her words.

“Not exactly, I can sometimes see ripples on the steps, motion from things that are not from here. It’s hard to explain. I can tell if someone new comes in. I was hoping I could find you before anything else did and warn you. That’s why I left the messages.” I nodded my head and understood what she risked by trying to help me. I was grateful for her help; I would not have survived so far without it. I suddenly felt very guilty when I considered how she was trapped here. The thought of her being stuck in this nightmare was heartbreaking, and I wondered just how long it had been.

“Well, I appreciate the help a lot. I owe you my life. One other thing, though, and sorry if this seems unimportant, but why the rhymes with the warnings?” I asked, trying not to be rude, but curious about the extra detail she added to her messages.

“Oh, that.” She smiled and brushed some hair out of her eyes.

“It helps me remember. Mornings due, helps warnings too, and friends will see your wisdom's true.” She looked away and scratched her head in a bashful way that was kind of cute.

I nodded my head and offered her my thanks again. I guessed that it was just the way she processed things.

She was grateful when she saw my reaction and sighed. I wondered again just how long she had been stuck in here all alone. I finally decided to ask,

“Hey Sherrie, how long have you been here? I saw the message in my room, it said you went into the stairs, but there was no date.” She paused for a long moment, considering her response.

“I don’t actually know, it feels like a lifetime. I have no way to track time, no phone or watch. There is not even sunlight to tell when a day is over or when it begins, so I couldn't really say.” She gave a resigned little laugh, and I could tell the idea troubled her.

“It's a long story, but I suppose we have some time now.” She said while trying to brush off the discomfort of her thoughts. She looked behind us at the door again, and I saw the jagged scar near her neck. The sight reminded me that we were not in a safe place to discuss things in detail after all. Not really. I wanted to find a way back and get us out of there, so I asked Sherrie if she had any idea how we could get out.

“Is there a way out that you know? Have you been able to find a door? You helped me get back to safety the first time.” Her face darkened, and the expression did not inspire confidence that she had a way out for us.

“Well, the thing is...” She started speaking, but then fell silent abruptly and looked past me to the door. She paused for a long moment, and I thought I saw her eye twitch.

Suddenly, I heard a slight ringing sound in my ears, and before I could register what was going on, Sherrie was holding a finger on her lips and pointing to the corner of the room with another. She had a deranged and terrified look in her eyes, and I realized we were in trouble again. I went to the corner and covered my ears just like she had been doing. But the ringing sound only got louder.

I felt a wave of distortion, and I thought I would vomit. Then, when the debilitating effect was over, I felt an odd compulsion to go to the door and open it. After all, why not? It was probably someone there to save us; they finally found us both and were going to rescue us.

I stood up to greet our rescuers, but Sherrie practically tackled me to the ground. It seemed like an odd way to receive the deliverance we had been expecting. She tried to speak to me, but as I saw her mouth move, all I heard was the intense ringing in my ears.

Suddenly her voice came through, faintly at first, then stronger as she repeated them, softly, but sternly,

“Ringing heads, singing bounds. The minds of listeners, devoured sound, and those who heed will lie in the ground.”

Her sing-song rhyme, coupled with the pleading look in her eyes, made something snap into place in my head. I realized no one was here to save us; in fact, something was on the other side of the door, and it did not have friendly intent. Sherrie held onto my hand and tried to cover her ears with her other arm.

I huddled down with her, and the disturbing waves of manipulating ringing carried through the room. The impulse to leave and walk into the waiting jaws of whatever was out there waiting was weakening.

We managed to hold out until the sound died away. It felt like it took hours, but maybe it was only minutes. When it was over we were left there in the room, drained, but alive.

“What the hell was that?” I managed to whisper hoarsely, after just realizing that my whole body ached, and I felt oddly feverish after the encounter.

“Deceivers.....consciousness eaters. At least that is what I call them, but I don’t trust anything I have heard about them, since they mess with the minds of whoever they are near. They try to get in your head and make you offer yourself up to them. The first time I encountered one, I was only saved by the fact that I got stuck in the room I was hiding in and couldn't leave, despite trying to go to the sound I heard. I couldn't block out the ringing and eventually it sounded exactly like my mother, calling to me. I tried to get to her for an hour before the thing grew tired of waiting and it left. After that, I realized it was best to try and avoid them and block off all your senses when they are around.”

Again, I marveled at how she had survived as long as she had. This place was a nightmare come to life, and she managed to survive and keep trying to escape for who knows how long against truly terrible odds. I was impressed and a little enamored by her resilience and spirit.

“Thanks....for saving me again,” I said, slightly louder than I had meant to.

She smiled, as if caught off guard by the remark.

“Of course, I know you would do the same for me, right? I mean, you sort of did, coming in here after all. It means a lot to me. I know you barely remember me, but I always thought you seemed nice at school. I’m sorry I never said anything before we left.”

My heart fluttered a bit when I considered she seemed to have felt the same way about me back then. I had no idea how or why we were there together at that point, and I knew it was crazy to think about our situation, but I still smiled when I considered such a simple thing.

I was about to ask her more about her life before getting trapped, when we heard another sound. It was a scraping, shuffling sound outside the door. Then heavy footsteps and more scraping on the walls. A familiar feral cry echoed just outside the door.

“More trouble...” Sherrie whispered. “Grabbers, it sounds like dozens of them. We have to move, sometimes they use these rooms as storage for their...collection.” She looked shaken as if recounting another terrible memory.

She grabbed her bag, then bent down and hefted my backpack, and tossed it to me.

“You might want to keep that knife handy. Grabbers are tough, but not invincible. They have a weird pouch near the neck that I think is directly tied to their lungs, so if you give it a good poke, they die.” She pulled a stiletto out of her bag and smiled grimly.

“Tight grips though, so don’t let them get ahold of your neck, or anything else you don't want broken for that matter.” She turned back to the door and crept up to it. She leaned in and listened, then turned back to me and whispered,

“Five or six, they are going in waves. We need to head up and out of here when the next group passes. The last few might be carrying their latest spoils, and they are going to be kicking down the door if we are still here.”

I nodded my head and nervously clung to the hunting knife I had brought. I was hopeful that Sherrie had a plan and she could help us find the door and escape.

As she held onto the handle, she looked at me one last time.

“Get ready to run, don't try and fight, only defend yourself to get them off of you. If you take too long and more than one gets you, it's over. We have to reach the top. We have to get to the pinnacle. Thats where it is.” She looked up as she spoke, and the fervor in her eyes was almost distracting. But I was confused by what she said. I thought we were escaping.

“Wait, where what is? Aren't we looking for the door?” I asked.

She blinked hard as if snapping out of a daydream and responded,

“Sorry. Yes of course, we do need to escape, but there is something important...” She was cut off when the door swung open and a hunched form walked straight in, holding a large burlap sack in its massive fists.

“No time.” Sherrie hissed, and she struck out with the stiletto and pierced the shadowy creature's throat. It fell noiselessly, and we bolted out the door. The clamor of the others down the stairs was heard as they turned and pursued us as soon as they heard our footsteps.

Running up the stairs was much different than going down, and I tried to keep up with Sherrie, but I found myself tripping on every other step and barely able to fly upstairs with the same speed and grace as she did.

I heard the frantic sounds of the grabbers below practically tripping over themselves to get to us. The eerie howling sounds intensified and I did not think I was going to make it. Sherrie paused for a moment and jumped down several steps. As she traveled through the air she managed to kick a grabber just as it was about to lay its oversized hands on my leg.

She held onto my arm to lead me along and we kept sprinting. My heart was hammering, my blood was pumping and my vision began to tunnel. The grabbers did not seem to be tiring and I knew I was going to get us killed.

As we fled upstairs and I thought I would pass out, I saw something amazing. I saw deliverance. It was the outline of a door. It looked slightly ajar and a small piece of cut rope was hanging near the corner of it. I couldn't believe it, I had found my door. I shouted out to Sherrie,

“Wait! Here it is. It’s my door, we can escape, this way, hurry!” I reached the door just as Sherrie was reaching out. I thought she was going to jump in with me, but to my surprise, she held onto my arm and paused at the door.

“No, you don’t understand. I can’t.” It was too late. My momentum from the mad dash pulled us both along those last few feet and then we fell in through the door. I heard it swing shut behind us, sealing off the slavering grabbers and the echoing madness of the stairs.

“We made it!” I gasped. I looked up and around my room and breathed a sigh of relief. Then I started looking around and my heart sank. Sherrie was nowhere to be seen. I had no idea what had happened. Where could she have gone? She was just with me, I pulled her through, we were supposed to be safe now, we were supposed to get out.

Then I remembered what she had said right before going through.

She had said "I can't" right before we fell through the door. With dawning horror, I realized she meant she couldn't leave. She couldn't leave the stairwell for some reason. She was still trapped, while I was out, alive and safe. Nothing made sense, but I knew I had to find out what was happening. I knew I had to find her again and save her, before it was too late.
