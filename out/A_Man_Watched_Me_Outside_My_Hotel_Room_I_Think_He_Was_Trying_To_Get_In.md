I was traveling alone for a work conference and booked a Comfort Inn near the convention center. Nothing fancy. Just clean, cheap, and close.

The lobby smelled faintly like old coffee and lemon-scented floor cleaner. The guy at the front desk barely looked up when I checked in. Just slid the keycard across the counter and muttered, "Room 309. Elevator's to the left."

The elevator ride up was uneventful. No one else got in with me. When the doors slid open on the third floor, I immediately noticed how quiet it was. Too quiet. No distant TVs, no doors slamming, no muffled conversations. Just a long hallway with patterned carpet and yellowish lights buzzing faintly.

My room was at the far end. 309. Past all the other identical doors.

As I rolled my suitcase down the hall, I noticed something.

At the very end of the hallway, standing near the stairwell door, there was a man. He was facing me. Not moving. Not doing anything. Just standing there, watching.

I slowed for a second, confused. Maybe he was waiting for someone. Maybe he was a guest locked out. I kept walking. Tried not to stare.

As I got closer to my door, I glanced back.

The man turned without a sound and slipped through the stairwell door. Gone.

I shook it off. Told myself it was nothing. Maybe he did not want to make it awkward. Maybe he was embarrassed.

Inside the room, everything felt a little too still. The air smelled faintly of old detergent, like the carpets had been cleaned but not aired out. I noticed the desk chair was turned to face the window. Not where housekeeping usually leaves it. A small detail, but it stuck with me.

I turned on the TV for background noise, tossed my bag onto the bed, and settled in.

The evening passed without anything else. I ordered delivery and ate on the bed, flipping through cable channels. Every now and then, I thought I heard faint footsteps in the hallway. Very soft. Not constant. Always stopping when I muted the TV to listen.

Around 1:50 AM, the room phone rang.

The sharp, old-fashioned ring cut through the quiet like a knife. I sat up, startled.

I answered.

"Hello"

Static. A faint crackling sound.

"Hello" I said again, louder.

There was breathing on the other end. Not a voice. Just steady, audible breathing.

Then a click. Dead line.

I hung up, staring at the phone. It could have been a prank. A crossed wire. Old phone system. Hotels are not exactly known for perfect maintenance.

I laid back down, facing the door.

Maybe twenty minutes later, there was a knock.

Three slow, deliberate knocks.

Measured. Not frantic. Not playful.

I sat up and listened. Another knock.

I got up slowly, walked to the door, and looked through the peephole.

The hallway was empty.

No footsteps. No elevator ding. No stairwell door swinging shut.

I stood there longer than I should have, holding my breath, waiting.

Nothing.

I backed away and grabbed my cell. Called the front desk.

"Comfort Inn, front desk," the same man answered.

"Someone knocked on my door," I said quietly. "And someone called my room."

"Room number"

"309"

A pause.

"Sir, external calls cannot be connected to guest rooms," he said. "Only internal."

Another pause.

"Stay inside your room. I will send security up."

About five minutes later, I heard the elevator ding faintly. Then slow, heavy footsteps coming down the hall.

There was a knock. Normal this time.

"Hotel security, sir"

I looked through the peephole. One staff member. Middle-aged guy. Black polo with the hotel logo. Radio on his hip.

I opened the door with the chain still latched.

He asked if I wanted him to walk the hallway and check the floor. I said yes.

He disappeared down the hallway, moving slowly. Checking doors. Looking into the stairwell. He even checked the emergency exit at the far end.

When he came back, he shook his head.

"No one out here now. Could be someone messing around," he said. "Happens sometimes late at night."

"You should keep your deadbolt locked," he added.

"I have," I said.

He gave a short nod and walked back toward the elevator. I watched until the doors closed.

I locked everything again and sat back down on the bed. I left the TV muted. I wanted to hear everything.

Around 3:00 AM, I heard it again.

The door handle moving.

Slow at first. Then a little firmer. Like someone trying to see if it was unlocked.

I got up carefully and looked through the peephole.

It was covered. Like something was pressed against it from the other side.

I backed away immediately. Heart pounding.

I grabbed the nearest chair, jammed it under the door handle, and sprinted to the room phone. I called the front desk.

"Someone is at my door," I hissed. "Trying to get in."

"Stay inside. We are sending security up right now," the man said.

Less than two minutes later, I heard footsteps. A knock.

"Hotel security, sir"

I checked the peephole carefully. The cover was gone. The same staff member was outside.

I opened the door with the chain still on.

"There was no one here when I got up," he said. "No one in the hallway."

I demanded they check the cameras.

He agreed and called the front desk on his radio. After a short wait, he came back.

"The feed is down," he said. "Wiring issue. Cameras on this floor have been glitching. They are supposed to fix it tomorrow."

I stared at him, not knowing what to say.

I relocked everything, reinforced the chair, and sat on the bed, wide awake.

An hour passed. Around 4:00 AM, I realized I was not going to sleep.

I decided to go downstairs to the lobby. Maybe just sit there until sunrise.

I grabbed my room key, unlocked the door, and stepped into the hallway.

It was completely silent. Still.

I started walking toward the elevators.

About halfway there, I glanced down the opposite end of the hall.

The man was there.

Head to toe in black.

Standing perfectly still.

Watching me.

I froze.

He took one step forward.

Then another.

Then he broke into a full sprint straight toward me.
