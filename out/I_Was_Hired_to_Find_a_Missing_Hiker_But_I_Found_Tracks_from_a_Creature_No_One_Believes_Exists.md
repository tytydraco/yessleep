My name is Jake, and I’ve spent most of my life navigating the mountains and forests of the Pacific Northwest. I guess you could say I'm a tracker by trade. People come to me when someone goes missing in the wilderness because they know I’ve got a knack for finding folks, even when others give up. I don’t talk much about the things I’ve seen out there—most of it’s not worth repeating, and some of it no one would believe anyway.

Before I became the go-to tracker for missing persons, I spent several years in the military. I served in the Special Forces, where I was trained in reconnaissance, survival, and tracking. The skills I honed there have been invaluable in my work since leaving the service, but they also come with their own set of memories—some I’d rather forget.

One mission stands out, a training exercise that took place in the dense jungles of Central America. We were tasked with locating a high-value target who was supposed to be hiding in a designated area. Our team had to track him down without being detected, using only the natural environment as our guide. It was a test of everything we had learned in training, and failure wasn’t an option.

We started at dawn, moving through the thick undergrowth with a practiced ease. The jungle was alive with sounds—chirps, rustles, the occasional growl of a predator. Our instructor had given us a basic location, but beyond that, it was up to us to find the target. We followed the trail with meticulous care, our eyes scanning for the smallest clues: a broken twig, a disturbed patch of ground, an irregular footprint.

The real challenge began when we hit a false trail. Someone had tried to mislead us, leaving behind misleading clues and false tracks. It was a test within the test, and it required every bit of skill we had. We had to retrace our steps, analyze the patterns, and figure out what was genuine and what was deception. I remember crouching by a small stream, examining the muddy water where someone had tried to hide their tracks. The water had been disturbed in a way that didn’t fit with the natural flow of the stream. I saw the faintest outline of a footprint on the bank—something that hadn’t been there before.

Using a combination of logic and intuition, I followed the true trail, ignoring the false leads. It wasn’t just about physical tracking; it was about understanding the mindset of the person we were hunting, anticipating their moves, and adapting our strategy accordingly. We finally located our target, hidden in a small cave, just as the sun began to set. The success of that mission wasn’t just a testament to our training but to our ability to read the environment and outthink the opposition.

The skills I developed in the military—detailed observation, critical thinking, and a keen sense of the natural world—have been crucial in my work as a tracker. The precision required to navigate and interpret the subtle signs left by someone in the wilderness mirrors the skills I used in those high-stakes missions. When I’m out in the field, it’s like a part of me is back in those jungles, analyzing every detail, every disturbance in the environment.

In a way, my military background has shaped my approach to tracking. It’s not just about following a set of clues; it’s about understanding the bigger picture, piecing together a puzzle that often doesn’t have obvious solutions. Each case is a new mission, with its own set of challenges and variables. And just like in the military, there’s no room for error. Every detail matters, every sign is significant, and every decision counts.

As I think back on those days, I realize how much they’ve influenced my work now. The training, the experiences, and even the tough lessons have all contributed to making me the tracker I am today. It’s a skillset forged in the crucible of high-stress situations, one that I rely on every time I step into the woods to find someone who’s gone missing. And while I might not be in uniform anymore, the lessons learned in the field continue to guide me, helping me navigate the complexities of the wilderness and the mysteries it holds.


I’ve been doing this job for years, and it’s earned me a reputation in town. People know that if their loved one is lost out in the woods, Jake’s their best bet. Maybe that’s why I’ve never been good at anything else. The wilderness makes sense to me in a way the rest of the world doesn’t. People are complicated; the forest is straightforward. It’s a place where I can use my skills without dealing with the mess of human life.

I’m not the kind of guy who spends a lot of time socializing. My usual routine after a long day of tracking is to head to a local bar on the edge of town, have a drink or two, then head back to my cabin to sleep. The bar's a small, quiet place with a handful of regulars who know how to keep to themselves. That night was no different—or so I thought.

I was nursing a beer, trying to wind down, when I heard raised voices near the entrance. I turned my head slightly to see a middle-aged couple talking to the bartender. They looked out of place—city folk, by the looks of their clothes and the desperation in their voices. The woman’s eyes were red from crying, and the man’s voice had a pleading edge to it.

“Please, our daughter’s gone missing,” the man was saying. “She was hiking in the forest near the old logging road. Has anyone seen her? We need help.”

I kept my eyes on my drink, but my ears perked up. I knew the area they were talking about. It was remote, hard to navigate, and not a place for inexperienced hikers. People got lost out there all the time, but they usually showed up after a day or two, scratched up but alive. The fact that this couple was here, in this bar, asking for help, meant they were running out of options.

I finished my beer and stood up, making my way over to them. “I couldn’t help but overhear,” I said, keeping my voice calm. “I’m Jake. I’ve been working as a tracker around these parts for a long time. Maybe I can help find your daughter.”

The couple turned to me, and the relief on their faces was palpable. They introduced themselves as Tom and Karen. Their daughter, Emily, had come out to the mountains to hike a few days ago, and they hadn’t heard from her since. She was supposed to check in with them, but her phone was going straight to voicemail. They’d contacted the authorities, but the search hadn’t turned up anything so far.

“Do you have a picture of her?” I asked.

Karen fumbled through her purse and pulled out a photo, handing it to me. Emily was in her mid-twenties, with dark hair pulled back in a ponytail. She was smiling at the camera, standing on what looked like a hiking trail. I studied the picture for a moment, then handed it back.

“Where was she last seen?”

Tom pulled out a map and unfolded it on the bar. He pointed to a spot near the old logging road, about ten miles from town. “Here. She told us she was planning to start from this point and follow the trail up into the mountains.”

I nodded. I knew the area well—dense forest, rocky terrain, and not many paths to follow. It would be easy for someone to get lost out there, especially if they weren’t familiar with the land. “I’ll start first thing in the morning,” I said. “I’ll need a description of what she was wearing and any other details you can give me.”

They provided everything I needed—a list of what Emily was carrying, her planned route, and even the brand of hiking boots she wore. I listened carefully, making mental notes. The couple offered me money, but I waved them off. This wasn’t about cash. I had a bad feeling about this, a gut instinct telling me that time was running out. If Emily was out there, I needed to find her, and fast.

I left the bar that night with a sense of urgency I hadn’t felt in a long time. I packed my gear as soon as I got home, making sure I had everything I’d need: maps, a compass, a flashlight, a knife, and enough food and water to last a couple of days. I knew the terrain would be challenging, and I didn’t want to waste any time coming back for supplies.

By the time I went to bed, I had a clear plan in mind. I’d head out at first light, start from the trailhead where Emily was last seen, and work my way up the mountains. I’d check the main paths first, then move on to the less-traveled areas. If Emily was lost, she’d likely try to follow the trails to find her way back. But if she’d been injured or had gone off-trail, it would be a different story.

As I lay in bed, staring at the ceiling, I knew that this search would be different from the others. I’d found plenty of lost hikers before, but something about this case felt off. I couldn’t put my finger on it, but I knew I had to be prepared for anything. I just hoped that whatever I found out there, I’d be able to handle it.

I set out at dawn, the morning light just starting to filter through the trees. I drove my truck to the trailhead where Emily had last been seen, parked, and got my gear together. The forest was quiet, the only sounds the rustling of leaves and the distant call of a bird. 

I stood there for a moment, taking in the scene, letting my instincts guide me.

I started on the main trail, moving slowly and carefully. My eyes scanned the ground for any signs—footprints, broken branches, anything that might tell me where Emily had gone. After about an hour of searching, I found a torn piece of fabric caught on a branch, a few yards off the trail. It matched the color of the jacket Emily was wearing in the photo. I made a note of the location and kept going.

A little further on, near a small stream, I found a water bottle half-buried in the mud. I picked it up, turning it over in my hands. It was a common brand, the kind you’d find in any convenience store. I checked the area for more clues and noticed some scuff marks on the rocks near the stream. It looked like someone had slipped or stumbled here. Maybe Emily had tried to cross the stream and lost her balance.

I crossed the stream myself, moving carefully. On the other side, I found more signs of passage—more scuff marks, a broken branch. Someone had come this way, but the trail was getting harder to follow. The forest was denser here, the underbrush thicker. I pushed forward, keeping my senses sharp.

That’s when I found the tracks.

They were faint at first, just impressions in the soft ground. But as I moved further, they became clearer. Large, clawed footprints, unlike anything I’d seen before. I knelt down to get a better look. The prints were deep, suggesting whatever made them was heavy, and they had a stride longer than a man’s. I took out my phone and snapped a few pictures, knowing I’d need to study them later.

I couldn’t identify the tracks right away. They didn’t match any animal native to these parts. Bears and wolves were common, but these tracks were different. The size, the shape, the claws—it was all wrong. I felt a knot form in my stomach, but I pushed the unease aside. I had a job to do.

I continued following the tracks, letting them guide me deeper into the forest. The terrain was getting rougher, with steep slopes and rocky outcrops. The air was cooler, the light dimmer as the canopy thickened overhead. The tracks led me off the trail entirely, into areas few hikers ventured. I knew I was getting into dangerous territory, but I couldn’t turn back now. Not with Emily still missing.

After another hour or so, I came to a small clearing. The ground was littered with animal bones, and there were markings on the trees—long scratches that looked like they’d been made by claws. The tracks continued into the clearing, but I didn’t follow them right away. I stood at the edge, scanning the area, trying to piece together what had happened here.

The bones looked fresh, some still had bits of fur and flesh clinging to them. Whatever had been feeding here, it hadn’t been gone long. I felt the hairs on the back of my neck stand up, a primal warning that I wasn’t alone. I slowly circled the clearing, keeping my eyes and ears open.

Then I saw it—another piece of clothing, partially hidden under a bush. I moved closer and realized it was a shoe, a woman’s hiking boot, half-buried in the dirt. My heart pounded in my chest. I was on the right track, but the evidence I was finding painted a grim picture. Emily had been here, but so had something else—something big and dangerous.

I picked up the shoe and examined it. There were scratches on the leather, like it had been clawed. I placed it back on the ground and took a few steps back, trying to get a sense of the area. That’s when I heard it—a low, rumbling sound, like a growl, coming from somewhere in the trees.

I turned, scanning the forest, but saw nothing. The growl came again, closer this time, vibrating through the ground. I felt a chill run down my spine, but I didn’t move. I knew better than to run. Whatever was out there was watching me, and if I ran, I’d be prey.

I stayed still for what felt like an eternity, listening, waiting. The growl didn’t come again, and slowly, the forest seemed to settle. I took a deep breath and backed out of the clearing, keeping my eyes on the trees. When I was sure I was a safe distance away, I turned and headed back toward the trail, moving quickly but carefully.

I needed to regroup, to think about my next move. Emily was still out here, and I was closer to finding her, but I wasn’t alone. Something was hunting in these woods, and I had a feeling it wasn’t finished yet.

The more I followed the tracks, the more uneasy I became. The forest around me felt different, The usual sounds of wildlife were absent. No birds, no rustling of small animals in the underbrush. It was just me, the trees, and the growing sense of being watched.

I kept moving, each step more cautious than the last. The tracks were leading me further away from the established paths, into a part of the forest that even I wasn’t familiar with. 

The trees here were older, their trunks wide and gnarled, branches twisted together to form a thick canopy that blocked out the sky. The underbrush was dense, every inch of ground covered with ferns and thorny bushes that made progress slow and painful.

As I walked,  the tracks didn’t meander the way animal tracks usually did. They had a purpose, a direction. Whatever had left them was moving with intent, and I was starting to suspect that intent involved me. I couldn't tell if it was a trap or if I was simply closing in on something the creature wanted to protect. Either way, I had to keep going. Emily was out here somewhere, and I couldn't afford to turn back.

I kept moving, each step more cautious than the last. The forest around me felt different, almost like it was holding its breath, waiting for something to happen. The usual sounds of wildlife were absent. No birds, no rustling of small animals in the underbrush. It was just me, the trees, and the growing sense of being watched.

I climbed over a fallen log, the bark rough under my hands, and paused. There was a noise ahead—a faint, rhythmic thumping, like something hitting the ground over and over. I crouched low and moved toward the sound, careful to keep my movements quiet. As I drew closer, the thumping grew louder, and I realized it wasn't just one sound but many, layered on top of each other. My heart raced as I recognized what it was: the sound of multiple creatures moving, their footfalls synchronized as they circled an area up ahead.

I crept closer, pushing aside a curtain of leaves, and saw another clearing. This one was larger, with a boulder at its center. The ground was churned up, dirt and leaves scattered everywhere, and around the edges of the clearing, several figures moved. They were hunched over, their bodies covered in matted fur, faces hidden in the shadows. Their limbs were long and thin, ending in hands with too many fingers, each tipped with a claw.

I froze, my breath catching in my throat. The creatures were pacing around the boulder, growling softly, and I realized that they were communicating with each other. They were too coordinated, too intelligent for any animal I’d ever encountered. I watched as one of them raised its head and sniffed the air, its eyes glowing faintly in the dim light. I ducked lower, praying it wouldn’t see me.

I stayed there for what felt like hours, watching the creatures circle the clearing. They moved with an eerie grace, their movements almost hypnotic. I could hear them growling to each other, a low, guttural sound that sent a chill down my spine. I strained to hear more, trying to pick up any words or patterns, but it was all gibberish to me.

Finally, one of the creatures broke away from the group and approached the boulder. It reached out with one of its clawed hands and touched the stone, tracing patterns on its surface. The others stopped pacing and watched, their eyes fixed on the creature at the boulder. The air seemed to thrum with energy, and I felt a pressure in my ears, like I was standing too close to a speaker blasting a low-frequency sound. My head began to pound, a dull ache that grew sharper with each passing second.

Then I saw it—a flash of color near the base of the boulder. It was a piece of fabric, caught on the rough stone. The same color as Emily’s jacket. My mind raced. Was she here? Had these creatures taken her? I scanned the clearing, looking for any sign of her, but saw nothing but the creatures, the boulder, and the oppressive silence.

I had to get closer, but there was no way to do it without being seen. I weighed my options, my mind racing. I could try to draw them away, make a noise, and lead them on a chase. But if I did that, I’d be leading them further into the forest, away from Emily. I couldn’t risk losing whatever chance I had of finding her.

I inched back, careful not to make any noise, and retreated into the forest. My only option was to circle around, approach the clearing from another angle, and hope I could get a better look without drawing their attention. I moved slowly, keeping to the shadows, my eyes constantly scanning the ground for any sign of the creatures.

It took me nearly half an hour to find a spot where I could see the clearing from a different angle. When I did, my breath caught in my throat. There, near the base of the boulder, was Emily. She was lying on the ground, her body lifeless, arms sprawled awkwardly. Her clothes were torn, and her face was pale, eyes staring vacantly up at the sky. I knew immediately she was dead. Her skin had a bluish tint, like she had been out here for days.

The creatures were gathered around her now, growling softly as they sniffed her body. One of them lifted her arm, its claws grazing her skin, and I saw the marks—deep scratches, bite marks. They had killed her, and now they were toying with her remains, examining her as if deciding what to do next.

I felt a wave of nausea wash over me, bile rising in my throat. I had found Emily, but there was no one left to save. The reality of it hit me like a punch to the gut. I had come all this way, risked my life, and she was already gone.

Suddenly, one of the creatures lifted its head and sniffed the air, its eyes narrowing. I ducked lower, but it was too late. The creature let out a loud, guttural sound—a call to the others. In a blur of movement, they all turned in my direction, their eyes glowing.

I knew I had to leave before they found me.

I turned and bolted through the forest, branches scratching at my face, underbrush tearing at my clothes. Behind me, I heard the creatures crashing through the trees, their growls growing louder. They were fast—too fast. I knew they would catch me if I didn’t think of something.

I veered off the path, diving behind a large fallen tree. I pressed myself against the ground, listening as the creatures came closer. They stopped nearby, sniffing the air, growling to each other in those guttural sounds that sent a chill down my spine. I held my breath, praying they wouldn’t find me.

For a few tense moments, they were right on top of me. I could hear them moving around, the sound of their claws scraping against the bark of the trees. One of them let out a low snarl, and I felt the ground vibrate beneath me. I closed my eyes, willing myself to be invisible, to be nothing more than another part of the forest.

Then, just as suddenly as they had appeared, they were gone. I listened as their growls faded into the distance, the sound of their footsteps growing softer. I waited a few minutes, making sure they weren’t coming back, before I dared to move. When I was sure the coast was clear, I crawled out from my hiding spot, my heart still pounding in my chest.

I knew I had to get out of there, had to get back to the trailhead and warn the others. Emily was gone, but there were other hikers, other people who could stumble into these creatures' path. I had to make sure no one else met the same fate.

I moved quickly, retracing my steps back to the trailhead. Every sound made me jump, my senses on high alert. I kept expecting the creatures to appear out of the trees, but the forest was quiet again, almost peaceful. It was as if the whole place had been holding its breath, waiting for the moment to strike, and now it was over.

When I reached the trailhead, I saw Tom and Karen waiting by their car, their faces lighting up when they saw me. As I approached, they hurried over, desperation in their eyes.

“Did you find her?” Karen asked, her voice trembling. There was a fragile hope in her eyes, a hope I was about to crush.

I hesitated, feeling the weight of what I was about to say. “I found her,” I said softly. “But... she’s gone. I’m so sorry. Emily’s dead.” The words felt hollow, unreal even as I said them.

For a moment, there was silence. Then, Karen let out a wail, a raw, agonizing sound that echoed through the trees. She collapsed to her knees, clutching at her hair, sobs wracking her body. Tom fell beside her, his face crumpling as he pulled her into his arms. I watched, feeling helpless, knowing that nothing I could say would ever make this better.

Tom looked up at me, his eyes red and swollen. “How?” he choked out. “How did she die?”

“There’s something in the forest,” I said. “Some kind of creatures. They... they killed her. I saw them. They’re not like anything I’ve ever seen. We have to leave, get help, warn people. No one is safe here.”

Karen’s sobs turned to screams, each one more desperate than the last. “No! No, it can’t be true!” she cried. “My baby, my Emily, she can’t be gone!” Her voice broke, and she buried her face in Tom’s chest, her body shaking with the force of her grief.

Tom held her tightly, his own tears falling silently. He looked at me, and in his eyes, I saw not just sorrow, but anger. A deep, burning rage that I knew was directed at me. “You promised to find her,” he said, his voice thick with emotion. “You promised to bring her back.”

“I’m sorry,” I whispered. “I tried. I did everything I could. But those things... they’re dangerous. We have to leave. We need to get help.”

Tom shook his head, his face twisting with grief. “You said you’d bring her back. You said you’d find her. You promised.”

“I know,” I said. “And I failed. But we have to go now. If we stay here, we’re all in danger.”

Tom’s expression hardened, and for a moment, I thought he might hit me. But then he turned away, his shoulders slumping as he pulled Karen closer. “Just get us out of here,” he said quietly. “Get us away from this place.”

We made the call to the sheriff, and within an hour, a small group of armed men arrived at the trailhead. I showed them the pictures on my phone, described what I’d seen, and led them back into the forest. Every step felt like it took an eternity, the tension mounting with each passing second.

When we reached the clearing, the creatures were gone. Emily’s body lay still at the base of the boulder, untouched since I had last seen her. The sight of her, so small and still, tore at my heart. The sheriff’s men spread out, searching the area, but there was no sign of the creatures. It was as if they had vanished, leaving no trace behind.

Tom and Karen stood over Emily’s body, their faces pale. Karen knelt beside her, gently brushing the hair from Emily’s face, her tears falling onto her daughter’s cold skin. “My baby,” she whispered, her voice cracking. “I’m so sorry, Emily. I’m so sorry I couldn’t protect you.”

Tom placed a hand on her shoulder, his own eyes filled with tears. “We’ll find who did this,” he said. “We’ll find them, and they’ll pay. I swear it.”

I stood back, watching as the sheriff and his men began to gather evidence, taking photos, marking the area. The scene felt surreal, like something out of a nightmare. I had done what I came to do. I had found Emily. But the cost was far higher than I could have imagined.

As we walked back to the trailhead, I glanced back at the forest. I could feel the weight of it pressing down on me, the knowledge that something was still out there, watching, waiting. Emily was dead, but the danger wasn’t over. The creatures had let us go this time, but I had no doubt they were still out there, hidden in the shadows, waiting for their next victim.

Tom and Karen were inconsolable, their grief a palpable thing that filled the air around us. I knew that they would never be the same, that the loss of their daughter would haunt them for the rest of their lives. And as much as I wanted to believe that I had done everything I could, a part of me knew that I had failed them. I had failed Emily. And that knowledge would haunt me forever.
