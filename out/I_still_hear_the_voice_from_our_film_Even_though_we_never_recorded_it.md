I was hired as a boom operator on a low-budget drama shooting in rural Pennsylvania. Four-person crew, six actors, one week of filming. The director, Ben, was one of those serious indie guys who spoke softly and used the word “cinema” without irony.

We shot at a small farmhouse that belonged to one of Ben’s relatives. Isolated, quiet, barely any signal. It still had power and running water, though, so it worked. The film was a character drama about two brothers arguing over what to do with their late father’s home. It was simple and intimate. No horror. Nothing supernatural.

The first strange thing happened on day two.

I was reviewing audio that night alone in the kitchen. Most of it sounded normal. But in take three of scene fourteen, I heard something odd. After one of the actors finishes his line, there’s a pause. Then I heard a voice I didn’t recognize say, “You shouldn’t be here.”

It wasn’t one of the actors. I rewatched the footage. Both of them were in the shot, and neither one spoke. The voice was low, muttered, like it was meant to be heard only by someone listening closely. I asked Ben about it the next morning. He brushed it off and said it was probably me breathing too close to the boom mic. That wasn’t it. I know what my breathing sounds like.

I let it go.

Then the script changed. Not officially. There were no new drafts or revisions emailed to us. But that night, one of the actresses, Mallory, asked me if she had been supposed to say something about the basement.

I didn’t remember any line about a basement.

She showed me her printed copy. Page twenty-three. There was a handwritten line in the margins that said, “He’s still down there. I heard him moving again.” It didn’t match her handwriting or pen. I checked my own script. That line wasn’t there. We weren’t even filming near the basement. Nothing in the story involved anyone being “down there.”

I showed it to Ben. He laughed and said Mallory was probably just playing a prank.

The next night, we lost power during a thunderstorm. Everything shut off. No lights, no cameras. But the old cassette deck in the living room clicked on. It played static for a few seconds, then a voice, that same low voice from before, said, “We’re not done filming.”

We had never used that cassette deck. Nobody knew it even worked. Nobody had touched it.

Mallory left the next morning. She didn’t say goodbye. She just got in her car and drove off.

Ben insisted we finish. He said the weirdness was “feeding the atmosphere of the shoot.” At that point, I was too tired to argue. We only had a couple days left.

On the fifth day, we filmed a quiet scene with the lead sitting in a bedroom. It was just one shot, pushing slowly toward the door from the hallway. No dialogue. Natural light.

When we reviewed the footage, we saw something we hadn’t seen in the room.

There was already someone sitting in the chair when the shot started. Just a silhouette, faint and blurry, but there. The actor walks into the room near the end of the shot, and by the time he gets there, the chair is empty.

No cuts. No tricks. Just gone.

Ben said we should keep it. Said it “adds mystery.” That was when I decided to leave. I packed my gear and walked off set that night. Didn’t get paid. Didn’t care.

A few days ago, a link showed up in my inbox from one of the PAs. She found a rough cut of the movie uploaded to Vimeo. It was under a different title: He’s Still Down There.

That was never the name of the project.

I didn’t watch it.

But the thumbnail is just a black frame, maybe from a night scene. In the corner, barely visible, there’s a shape. Someone sitting, just watching. Not one of the actors. Not anyone I recognize.

I closed the tab. I haven’t opened it again. But sometimes, when I’m alone and things are quiet, I think I can still hear that voice.

We’re not done filming.
