I don't wish to disclose my name. I don't wish to disclose my town. Just know that I am a town police officer in Maine, and I just saw something that keeps me awake tonight. My eyes are burning from staring at my phone all night. It's 2am right now,  what happened was around 11. I tried everything,  silly videos, drowning it with something scarier, taking benadryl just to knock me out. I still can't help but see that poor girl when my eyes close. This is the hardest part of the job, something I know I signed up for but you don't really expect to happen in your little nothing town. 

I was so close to done my shift. So close to not having to be horrified with what I saw. But me and my partner got dispatched, a girl was calling claiming that she saw a face in her window. 

When we got there, the neighbor's dogs were barking like crazy. There were dog prints all over the yard, but nothing else was disturbed. The girl couldn't have been older than 16, she had locked herself in the bathroom. She was cowering, shaking, covered in a blanket in the tub with the shower curtain pulled and a serated steak knife trembling in her hands.  Even though we announced our presence beforehand, she still jumped when we pulled back the curtain. 

We didn't find anyone,  or any way to track someone, so we advised her to lock her doors and we left. Something bothered me about the statement she gave. She said all she could see were the eyes, bright animalistic eyes. She looked like she wanted to say more. But she was shaken and, against my better judgment,  I let her be.

We got a second dispatch,  to the same house. We got there and found her this time in her closet, cowering on this shelf that she just barely fit in behind some blankets. 
"It was by the door this time," she warbled, "and I heard a terrible scratching noise." Tears and snot streamed down her face. Indeed, the  back door was terribly scratched. We took closer inspection of the dog prints by the door, there were some weirder prints. Similar to a raccoon's, but larger. 
"Do you have a dog?" My partner asked.
"No, but the neighbor's do. They don't leave the yard, and don't ever go out at night. Their little yapper dogs." 
"Where are your parents, ma'am?" I asked.
"Their in a food service training thing, down south. They'll be back tomorrow." 
We had nothing else we can do. The prints were odd, but it's not like a stray dog was doing this. We left, telling her to call immediately if she found something else. I wish I didn't.  I don't know what else i could've done. Maybe stay there with her, sleep in my car, take her to my house, heck even take her to the jail just until her parents came back. But I followed protocol. I'll forever be haunted my her muttering as she cried. "I really don't want to die."

We got the final call, and arrived to find a hole torn through the back door, one that faced a thin strip of woods. My stomach turned when I saw those dog and unknown prints covered in blood in the snow. It got worse when I got inside. It all smelled of metal, of pennies. Of blood. The whole way we followed bloody tracks, as cold fear sunk into my bones. The couch was ripped up, walls were clawed, and thin traces of blood everywhere. The real gore was when we got into what looked like the parents bedroom. 

She was torn in half, that's the only way I could describe it. There was no guts, no bits of flesh. It was just her torso, her legs, and red everywhere else. I contaminated the crime scene a little with my immediate reaction.  I just threw up and convulsed and tried to ignore the blank eyes that stared at me like it was my fault. It was my fault, and god forgive me for following the rules. The stupid stupid rules. 

We're investigating the cause. But I didn't come on here to calm my nerves. That was an afterthought. What I really came here for was to see something in the wild, something that rubbed my spine weird. In that dead girl's hand was her phone. While we where there, a message dinged.
