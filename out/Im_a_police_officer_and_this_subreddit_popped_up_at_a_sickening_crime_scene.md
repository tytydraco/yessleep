I don't wish to disclose my name. I don't wish to disclose my town. Just know that I am a town police officer in Maine, and I just saw something that keeps me awake tonight. My eyes are burning from staring at my phone all night. It's 2am right now,  what happened was around 11. I tried everything,  silly videos, drowning it with something scarier, taking benadryl just to knock me out. I don't want to drink, or take any drugs. I still can't help but see that poor girl when my eyes close, I can't imagine what my mind will do to me if i get inebriated. But it's tempting, seeing something like this. This is the hardest part of the job, something I know I signed up for. But you don't really expect to happen in your little nothing town, you know? You expect the worse bust you ever do is that some guy decided to streak in front of the movie theater.

I was so close to done my shift. So close to not having to be horrified with what I saw. It could've all been someone else's problem. Then again, who would I rather have seen this? I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy.  My partner and I got dispatched, a girl was calling claiming that she saw a face in her window. 

When we got there, the neighbor's dogs were barking like crazy. There were dog prints all over the yard, but nothing else was disturbed. The girl couldn't have been older than 16. She had locked herself in the bathroom. She was cowering, shaking, covered in a blanket in the tub with the shower curtain pulled and a serated steak knife trembling in her hands.  She atleast she was smart, or cautious.  Even though we announced our presence beforehand, she still jumped when we pulled back the curtain. 

We did a full sweep, up to the small woods in the back of the house that seperated it from the street behind it. We didn't find anyone,  or any way to track someone. So, completely powerless despite this girl's shakeness, we advised her to lock her doors and we left. 
"Something bothered me about the statement she gave." My partner said in the patrol car. 
"She said all she could see were the eyes, bright animalistic eyes," he continued, "But she looked like she wanted to say more."
"Maybe she was just shaken. Or who knows, maybe we're lucky and its just her freaking out about being home alone and it was the neighbor's dog looking in the window." I replied. Oh how I wish I was right.

We got a second dispatch,  to the same house. We got there and found her this time in her closet, cowering on this shelf that she just barely fit in behind some blankets. 
"It was by the door this time," she warbled, "and I heard a terrible scratching noise." Tears and snot streamed down her face. My partner comforted her while I checked it out. 

Indeed, the back door was terribly scratched. We took closer inspection of the dog prints by the door, there were some weirder prints. Similar to a raccoon's, but larger. 
"Do you have a dog?" My partner asked.
"No, but the neighbor's do. They don't leave the yard, and don't ever go out at night. They are just little yapper dogs." She replied, "why?"
He shot me a glance, and I knew why.
"Where are your parents, ma'am?" I asked.
"Their in a food service training thing, down south. They'll be back tomorrow." She said. That made me feel worse. If she had someone here, I would feel so much better.
"Is there someone you can call to stay with, or to come stay with you?"
She shook her head, "not for a bit, and not at this time of night. My uncle is the closest relative or freind, and legally he can't drive at night from his night blindness. My parents took my car since their's is getting repaired."
We had nothing else we can do. The prints were odd, but it's not like a stray dog was doing this. We left, telling her to call immediately if she found something else. I wish I didn't.  I don't know what else I could've done. Maybe stay there with her, sleep in my car, take her to my house, heck even take her to the jail just until her parents came back. Maybe put her in my patrol car and drive her wherever myself.  But I was tired, I wasn't thinking straight.  As uneasy as this made me, I still couldn't help not wanting to stay there and think. As I walked out, she grabbed my arm. 
"Sir, I..." she paused. I couldn't tell what was crossing her mind but eventually she said "I don't want to die." Her whole voice sounding as if she were drowning.

We got the final call, and arrived to find a hole torn through the back door, one that faced the thin strip of woods. My stomach turned when I saw those dog and unknown prints covered in blood in the snow. It got worse when I got inside. It all smelled of metal, of pennies. Of blood. The whole way we followed bloody tracks, as cold fear sunk into my bones. The couch was ripped up, walls were clawed, and thin traces of blood everywhere. It was a large struggle, clearly. Pots and pans were bent on the floor, the tv had been smashed. I found shreds of clothes and hair along the trail too. But the real gore, that was when we got into what looked like the parents bedroom. 

It was red. Everywhere was red. And it smelled like rust. It smelled like wet coins and it choked at my lungs. The jewelry box was overturned, and the girl was clutching the silver jewelry in one hand and her phone in the other.  Oh god, the girl. She was torn in half, that's the only way I could describe it. There was no guts, no bits of flesh. It was just her torso, her legs, and red paint everywhere else. It looked fake, to be honest. It looked fake to see two peices of a limp ragdoll body. But it was real. It was pale, and stiff, and real. I had talked to her moments ago. She trusted me. I contaminated the crime scene a little with my immediate reaction.  I just threw up and convulsed and tried to ignore the blank eyes that stared at me like it was my fault. It was my fault, and god forgive me for following the rules. The stupid stupid rules. I ran outsie for some fresh air. I couldn't take something like this. I decided to make use of myself and follow the tracks. I followed them into the woods. My boots crunched in the snow as my flashlight illuminated the awful prints and the broken twigs. I came into the street, and into the park of the elementary school. To think this happened so close to where kids will be the next day. The moon illuminated the fact that the tracks went across the baseball feild of the school, and into the treeline behind that. I had to remember to tell the crime scene investigators when they got here.

We're still investigating the cause, and we have no suspects. Im not a religious person, but for the first time ever i prayed to god for forgiveness. I know this is my fault. I could've stopped it. Imagining what her poor parents will think makes me swear of kids forever.  What's worse, whatever did this is still put there. I feel eyes on my back even now, like it knows I'm here and that I helped it suceed. But, I didn't come on here to calm my nerves. That was an afterthought, an idea after i read what I just finished reading. What I really came here for was to see something in the wild, something that rubbed my spine weird. In the morning, I will dig further, maybe bring this up for the investigators. In that dead girl's hand was her phone. While we where there, a message had dinged.
