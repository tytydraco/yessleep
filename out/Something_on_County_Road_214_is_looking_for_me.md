I’ve been working for a corporate delivery company for almost 3 years now. I have one route that I run and I thinks it’s safe to say I know Carroll County better than anyone else. I know everyone and their dog, and every road has become so familiar to me that I could do my job with my eyes closed. And that’s what makes what happened the past couple of days all the stranger. 

I split my route into 3 sub-routes: Highways, In-towns, and Outskirts in that order. This happened in Outskirts. 

I say “this happened” but I really don’t even know what happened if anything did at all. I remember dropping off a package on a connected road and getting about a quarter of a mile down County Road 214, but that’s it. Literally the rest of the day is a blur and if I try to think too much about it I get really nauseous. 

The only other things I can remember from that day was laying in bed with my wife and a weird dream I had. I’ll try to describe it as best as I can. 

I was standing in the woods, nowhere I know of but it was familiar. I didn’t have any clothes on and my eyes stung so bad. Kind of like when you rub them after touching peppers, but I remember it feeling so much worse and I couldn’t stop trying to blink the pain away. I remember thinking everything looked like an old silent film with how janky things were moving. I couldn’t see much of anything besides the silhouettes of swaying branches, but all around me I could hear voices. All saying “Where are you?” It was like how a child would say it I guess. Like “Where arrrrrrre yooooou?” They weren’t speaking in unison either. Each voice was like it was part of a completely different conversation than the others. And they weren’t yelling or talking loudly but my ears were ringing from it all. Right before I woke up, all of the voices suddenly died out and there was one last voice off in the distance that — in that same childish way — said, “Come fiiiiiind meeeee.”

When I woke up my eyes were burning. Not nearly as bad as in the dream, but it was enough to make my tears fall down the side of my face. I felt like I hadn’t gotten a single bit of sleep that night. 

Which brings us to yesterday. I had way too many stops for what I was getting paid for as usual and as I got into my routine, I forgot about my unnerving dream. Everything was smooth sailing, and I even got to meet up with my wife in town for lunch. But when I turned onto County Road 214, I once again lost the rest of the day. This time I didn’t even remember falling asleep; I came back to in the same woods as before. My eyes were burning the same as before. I was once again naked, and I was once again surrounded by the countless voices saying “Where arrrrrrre yoooooou?” My skin started to itch and tingle as if thousands of bugs were crawling all over me. I tried to scream but when I opened my mouth they all crawled into it and down my throat. They filled my lungs and the last thing I heard before blacking out from lack of oxygen was,

“Come fiiiiiind meeeee.”

I woke up in bed next to my wife this morning. It was 5:00 AM and she was sound asleep. I got up to start getting ready for my two hour drive to work, but when I looked in the mirror —toothbrush ready for battle — I saw my body covered in bug bites. Not like a few scattered bites. My entire body was covered in them. They weren’t random either. They spelled out something. At least I think they did. I kind of feel like those people that hear “Hail Satan” when they reverse a song or something. Anyways I was late to work because I spent the morning with a pen connecting the dots. I think this is what it says: 

“Found you.”

Has anyone else heard of this kind of phenomenon or something similar? I did some research into it but haven’t found anything useful. 

I’ll try to read and reply to comments but I’ve got another long day ahead of me today and I think I have to drive down County Road 214 again.
