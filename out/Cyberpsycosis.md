Hey all, I was told by a friend to post here. If not for some help then as a way to document my findings and research. 

I’ll start from the beginning, my closest friend victor and I go way back, we were friend’s from the beginning of first grade and kept being friend’s till after college, where we are now. We live in a small town a hour away from the coast in Oregon, due to this we became very close friends since we were the only boys who shared the interest of video games and messing around in the woods after school, I remember as soon as the bell rang we would get on our bikes and ride into town where we would fail at doing bike tricks and going to the public library to use the computers to play internet games or look up pictures of cool stuff we liked. 

I apologize, I’m getting side tracked. The reason I’m posting here is that victor has disappeared, I usually text him every weekend to hang out but he didn’t respond, after a week of no response i went over to his house to find it empty( he gave me a spare key). I didn’t really have any of his family’s numbers, his dad left him and his mom when Vic was just a kid and his mother isn’t answering her texts either. I’ve already talked to the sheriff about it and he said that victor sent him an email that said he was going away for a while and that he’d be back, for context he and the sheriff were pretty close because Vic had a pretty long internship with the local department. I told him that his place is empty but the sheriff just said “he’s probably just moving in with his mom for a bit”. I know this isn’t true, it’s not like him to just leave and not respond to anything. 

Nothing strange happened weeks prior, it was just the same old thing, we’d meet up at one of our houses and play games and get high. The only thing really out of the ordinary was that he was talking a lot about technology, which isn’t out of the blue because Vic was always into tech. Even as kids, he got his first computer at 12 and I remember that because we stopped using the free ones at the library. Ever since then he had been obsessed with it, upgrading and getting new computers and things like that all the time. Though I can’t remember when his obsession started. He would always rave about it and try to sell me on it but I never understood it. My family only got a computer a couple years before I moved out.   

I stayed here and worked after college but my parents moved because of my dads work. It was only me and Vic. He was one of my only true friend I had left in this town, other than one of our mutuals Derrick, who was also a tech nut, i really need to tell him about this too. 

Anyways, what makes this even stranger and just verifies my suspicions is that I got a package from an unknown sender that contained a computer pc and a cryptic note that said “obsession is the gateway”. I new who’s computer it was, it was Vic’s. I’ve plugged it into my monitor and I’ve yet to go through it. I’ll update when I do, bye.
