I am Duke, a medium who has always been able to sense the presence of the supernatural. I've never had any control over my abilities, but I've always known that the world is full of dark and evil presences that most people are oblivious to. As a young man, I've had countless experiences with the paranormal, some of them more terrifying than others.

One of the most chilling experiences I've had was when I was walking home from a late-night party. The streets were deserted, and the only sounds were the echoing of my footsteps and the rustling of the trees in the wind. Suddenly, I felt a cold breeze wash over me, and I knew that I was not alone. I turned around to see a shadowy figure lurking in the darkness. It was a malevolent entity that seemed to be feeding off my fear.

I tried to run, but my legs felt heavy, as if they were weighed down by a leaden force. I could feel the presence of the entity growing stronger with each passing moment. My breath became short, and my heart raced with terror as I struggled to break free.

Just when I thought I was doomed, I felt a sudden surge of energy coursing through my body. It was as if some unseen force was protecting me, shielding me from the entity's malevolent power. The entity let out an ear-splitting scream and vanished into thin air.

Since then, I've had many more encounters with the paranormal. Some of them were harmless, but others were downright terrifying. I've seen ghosts, demons, and other malevolent entities that are beyond human comprehension.

One of the scariest experiences I had was when I was exploring an abandoned house. The house was rumored to be haunted, and I was curious to see if the rumors were true. As I walked through the empty rooms, I felt a chill run down my spine. It was as if the house was alive, and it was watching me.

Suddenly, I heard a voice whisper my name. It was a ghostly voice that seemed to come from all around me. I tried to run, but the door was locked. I was trapped in the house, and the ghost was closing in on me.

As I cowered in fear, I felt a sudden burst of energy surge through me. It was as if my own supernatural powers were awakened by the terror. The ghostly voice grew louder, but I focused all my energy on banishing it. The house shook with the force of my power, and the ghostly voice let out a blood-curdling scream before fading away.

But the power had taken its toll on me. My body was weak and trembling, and I knew that I was not going to make it out of the house alive. I closed my eyes and waited for the inevitable.

When I woke up, I was in a hospital bed, surrounded by my family. They told me that I had been in a coma for weeks and that they had found me unconscious in the abandoned house. I knew that I had come close to death, and that my powers had saved me. But I also knew that the dark and evil presences in the world were stronger than ever, and that I would have to face them again one day.
