I'm being followed or stalked by someone.

I was working two weeks ago, checking something when I looked up from my phone and I thought I saw someone, but they weren't actually there. it was like looking at the sun for a second then looking away and seeing the spots in your vision, but it was a person. I can't even describe him, it was instant and then he's gone, not hiding behind freight pallets or something just gone. I thought I was just tired so I went about my day, feeling off and went home. After a day I was back to normal and even joking with my friends about it, then on Monday when I went to my local shooting range and fired my Sig, I fucking saw him again. It was the same as before, I had just emptied the magazine at the paper target in my lane and looked over to my left out of the corner of my eye and saw him staring at me, then he was gone like the last time. I dropped my gun (it was safe at this point, unloaded), picked it back up with the rest of my shit and got out, then went straight home and had a panic attack.

I've seen him three times this week, I've lost sleep, and I can feel him watching me type this. I'm legitimately terrified and haven't left my apartment's in a day and I didn't sleep at all last night, there's no pattern or anything to make him show up but when he's there everything in me screams to run and I cant fucking take it anymore. He doesn't make a sound, but its like hearing something through loud music, you know someone is speaking but there's nothing you can actually hear, but I can feel the hatred in his words. I can tell my dishes have been moved along with remotes and blankets, like someone picked them up and tried putting them back in their original position, but I can see it from a mile away. My tap water is at a lower pressure too. I feel awful, like I have no energy. I can't even get out of bed unless its to sneak to the kitchen and grab food before having a damn near panic attack in my room with a bag of hamburger buns or granola bars. Yesterday I grabbed as much non-perishable foods as I could and brought them to my room. My phone's been ringing non stop and I can hear someone knock at my door every few hours but I can't leave. Its not even safe to drink the water from the sink anymore, but I have some bottles of beer and soda until I can boil more water to drink tomorrow. I haven't heard the knocking in a while, but I'm not going near the door. 

I'm on the verge of tears now, he showed up again and my heart is ready to explode and I feel his anger and malice please for the love of God does anyone have any idea what I should do??
