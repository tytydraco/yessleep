I would like to start this off by introducing myself. My name is Saburo Sato. My family had moved to America when I was 15 (I am now 20). I had recently moved out and back to Japan. A small city called Nanto. I had a friend living here, so I didn’t have to meet entirely new people. My house was a Minka, or as you would probably know them, a traditional style Japanese house. The ones with sliding doors, matting floors, all of that. It was beautiful.

Now, some more information, I had never believed in the supernatural. Though back when I was in school in America, there was a classmate who did. She was really into Tarot cards, magic, and everything else. I always thought it was unthinkable. But after what I had experienced, I fully believe there's more to this world than we think.

Now, let me begin. I had invited my friend, Izumi over for a few drinks after fully settling in. He came over around 9pm to 10pm. I do not fully remember the time, nor is it very important. Me and him settled in and began talking while watching the TV. That is when Izumi stopped and pointed out the window. We spoke in Japanese for the majority of my tale, but I will translate it my best into english.

“Your neighbor is staring.”

I live next to an elderly woman named Asahina Emi. She seemed polite when we first met. The room me and Izumi sat in had a large window, and we were clearly visible through it. She stared for a second more before turning away and disappearing out of view. I looked at Izumi.

“What was that about?” I had asked.

Izumi shrugged.

“I do not know.” Izumi said as he turned his attention back to the TV.

I looked out the window towards Asahina's house once again, questioning why she was staring at us. I shrugged it off as just an old person thing. She possibly had Sundown syndrome, which is caused by dementia. Though that’d be a bit strange considering the lack of caregiver. Nothing much happened after that until a few days later.

I had begun to look closer at my neighbor's house, trying to see if her staring was a one time thing, or not. As I studied her house, I noticed something. Asahina had a daughter. Or possibly a granddaughter.

She looked no older than I. I would say around the age of 23. She was absolutely gorgeous though. I once saw her heading into her grandmother's house after I had gotten groceries. I called over to her and waved.

“Hello!” I had said to her.

She looked my way and waved, “Hello!”

“Is that your grandmother's house” I had asked

“Oh, yes actually. My name is Toko Emi.”

“I am Saburo Sato. It is a pleasure to meet you.”

“Likewise, Mr. Sato. I have seen you around, but I never really met you formally.”

“Yes, same. I didn’t see you when I first moved here.”

“Ah, yes, I had recently gotten back from a business trip, just 3 days ago.”

I nodded before glancing down at my bags of groceries. “Very nice. Well, I must be heading inside now. I hope to see you around, Ms. Emi!”

She smiled and bowed, and I bowed back before we both headed into our homes. I set my groceries down and put them in the fridge. Nothing much had happened for a while after that. Me and Emi had begun to talk though. We had begun to discuss going to dinner. Practically the start of a movie. Though, then things had changed. I hadn’t noticed Asahina. And I had begun to notice a lot more dead animals. I had noticed a few ever since I moved here, but the number of them had increased an alarming amount. 

I had originally thought it was only wild animals. But I do not think the amount of corpses I’ve been seeing is natural. Animals kill for food. The corpses would not be left. Yet, they were. My suspicions of something being very off was confirmed a day later. I had been walking home from the store, when I noticed something. A swarm of sparrows. They were circling above me. It had startled me greatly. Their cawing was very unsettling. Especially as they circle above you at night while you are alone. I dramatically increased my speed, wanting to get home as soon as possible. As I reached my home, the sparrows above me scattered as if they were terrified. That was when I saw Asahina leaving her house. I looked back at the disappearing sparrows before turning my attention to Asahina.

“What was that about?” She asked.

“I do not know.” I said. I bowed my head to her as I entered my house. 

I opened my laptop and began searching for answers. I sat in the same seat as I did when I saw Asahina staring. I did not know what to search for though. Sparrow swarms above head did nothing. Neither did “Sparrows following me home”, oh which only brought up guardian angels. Though. That may have been a sign. I kept thinking about it until finally, I thought of something. “Sparrows yokai”. I searched it up thinking I would find nothing. But then I found out about Yosuzume. 

Yosuzume are sparrow yokai that swirl around lone travelers at night. In different parts of Japan, they are thought to warn of something or bring evil. In some parts, they are bad omens and bring evil. In others, they warn of okuri inu. But, what I saw, is what I believe they meant for me. They warn of other Yokai.

That is when I heard a tap on the window. I spun around and saw the top of Asahinsas head, her eyes staring right into me. I stood up and begun to back away.

“What the hell.” I said. I tripped over myself and fell onto my back. Asahina’s head came more into view until I could see it fully.

But her head did not stop rising. Her neck. 親愛なる神よ、彼女の首よ... It was far too long. Her head reached the top of my window, and then she smiled. Her smile was inhuman. Disgusting.

“What’s wrong, Mr. Sato? Are you scared?” Asahina said. She then began to laugh. She began slamming her head against the window again. And again.

I stood up and ran into another room, screaming. I grabbed my phone and called the police. I yelled for them to come as Asahina continued to laugh and bang her head. I then heard her speak once again.

“When I get inside, I’ll drain your corpse of its blood!”

The banging then ceased. The police arrived but minutes later and I told them everything. The Yosuzume. Asahina. The banging. I knew they didn’t believe me, but they were kind enough to go over to Asahina's house. I do not know what happened next, but I do know there were no arrests.

After the police left, I called Izumi.

“Hello?”

“Izumi. It is important. Something is wrong with Asahina. Very. Very wrong.”

“Like what? Is she a stalker? A murderer with a secret basement full of bodies?”

“Why so specific?.. But no. Neither. I think. But I do know she is a Rokurokubi.”

“... What the hell are you talking about?”

“Asahina. As I was walking home earlier, I saw Yosuzume. But I did not know what they were. So I had looked them up. As I found out about them, Asahina had tapped on my window. She was staring at me through it. Her head then began to rise, and I saw her neck. It was inhumanly long.”

“Are you sure you are not high? Or drunk?”

“No. Neither. Just come over, please.”

Izumi sighed, “Fine. I will be over shortly.”

The hour long wait was one of the longest I had experienced. I spent the entire time looking out the windows at the next door house. When the doorbell rang, I genuinely jumped. I took a few deep breaths before walking to the front door and opening it. Izumi stood there.


“Hello, Izumi” I had said, welcoming him in.

“Hello, Saburo” He said, taking his shoes off before entering.

We walked into the living room, and we stared at it.

“So, you’re sure of what you saw?” Izumi asked.

“Very. I remember her laughter. I remember the banging. And I remember her mocking words.”

“What’d she even say”

“‘What’s wrong Mr. Sato? Are you scared?’ and then ‘When I get inside I’ll drain your corpse of its blood.’”

“Eugh. Creepy.” He shook his head before looking at me. “So, what are we going to do?”

“Go next door, get inside, and confront Asahina and Emi.”

“This is a very stupid idea. Even if she was a rokurokubi, a dangerous one at that, what would we even do?”

“... I am still working on that.”

“So we're going into a potentially dangerous house with no plan?”

“Yes”

“I swear, if we get arrested for breaking into an old lady's house because we think she is a Rokurokubi, I am going to be pissed.”

“We will get proof. I know what I saw. And, I will have a plan by the time we get there.” I turned and began to walk before stopping. “Just in case. I had gotten something from America just in case of emergency.”

I walked past Izumi and into my bedroom where I opened my closet. Inside was a safe. I put in the code and removed my gun from it. I put it in my back pocket, put on a jacket to cover it, and walked back out to Izumi.

“What did you grab?”

“Nothing important. Just something for protection.”

Izumi looked at me, questioningly, but ultimately ended up shrugging it off. We exited my house and walked around to the neighbors. We walked up to the nearest door, and opened it. I was slightly surprised that it was unlocked. I assumed someone like her would keep her home locked like a safe. We entered and saw how dark it was inside. I pulled out my phone and turned on its flashlight. Immediately, I saw many oil lamps on the ground. I looked at Izumi, and he seemed surprised at them. It seems he finally actually began to believe me at this point. He then put his finger to his mouth and gestured for me to listen. I did so, and heard the sound of a TV further in the house.

We began to venture further into the home, stepping over each oil lamp as to not break them. We reached the doorway to the living room, and I grabbed the sliding door, turning off my flashlight and putting my phone in my pocket. I slowly opened it slightly, and peeked through the crack. Inside, was Asahina, sitting and watching the TV. She was positioned so that she was not facing us. Izumi came close and peeked through.

“She’s just watching Television.”

Immediately after he spoke, Asahina's head spun 180 degrees towards us. She saw us, and smiled. The TV shut off and the house went black. I quickly grabbed my phone, and turned on the flashlight. I aimed it in the living room, and saw that Asahina was gone.

“Shit!”

“Where the hell did she go?”

“I do not know.” I said as I entered the living room.

I began to look around. Izumi walked up and began looking around as well.

“This was a very bad idea.”

“But, a bad idea, yes. But a necessary idea.”

We heard a scrape in the hallway and spun towards it. I walked out into the hall, Izumi following close. We looked down one end, before focusing on the other. That's when we saw her. Peeking from a corner. She began to come out, or so we thought. Her neck extended until her head was fully visible. I would say it was about 1 and a half meters by now. Or, 5 feet for americans. 

“What in the actual fuck?!” Izumi screamed as he backed away.

“The Rokurokubi…”

“You come into my home for what reason? Is it because of my threat? If so, you just made it so much easier for me to carry it out, Mr. Sato.”

“We’ve come to put an end to you, Rokurokubi.”

“I’d love to watch you try.” She said, beginning to laugh. Her head then suddenly lunged for us.

I barely ducked out of the way before reaching for my gun. I pulled it out and shot at the Rokurokubi twice. The bullets barely missed its neck. She hissed at me before attempting to bite me. I ran out of the way and down the hall. I turned the corner and glanced behind my shoulder. Asahina was mere inches away. That was when Izumi bashed an oil lamp against her head.

“SON OF A BITCH!” She screamed before facing Izumi.

I fully turned the corner and saw Asahina’s body standing there. I aimed my gun but before I could fire I felt her neck wrap around my legs. Her head rose up behind me. I elbowed her before stomping on her throat. She screamed and her neck retracted, Asahina coughing as she did so. She hissed at me before ripping through a screen door leading to her kitchen. She disappeared by the time I looked in there. Izumi turned the corner and I saw blood dripping from his neck.

“Are you alright?”

“Yes. Yes. I’m fine.”

“Good. We must find Asahina and put an end to her.”

“Agreed… Wait, what about her granddaughter?”

I had forgotten about Toko. I looked around and gripped my gun tightly.

“Do you think she is also a rokurokubi?”

“Possibly.” Izumi said as he picked up another oil lamp.

I stepped into the kitchen and looked around. I walked up to the knife block, grabbed one, and handed it to Izumi.

“Better than nothing.”

“Oh. Thanks.”

Izumi set the oil lamp down and grabbed the knife instead.

“Where could she have gone?” Izumi asked

“I do not know. But what I do know is that we must find Toko. If she is a hostile rokurokubi, then we must end her. If she is a docile one, then she may be able to help us. Though, if she’s a normal human, we must get her to safety.”

“Agreed.” Izumi looked around. “I will look to the right side. You to the left.”

“You have no truly reliable weapon.”

“I will be fine. Probably. Hopefully. And plus, she seems to want you more than I.” 

“Very well. Best of luck, Izumi” I said, walking past him.

“Best of luck to you as well.”

I looked back and nodded. I exited the kitchen and headed for the left side of the house. I held my weapon tightly as I looked around. I entered what appeared to be Asahina's bedroom. There were many oil lamps, small dead animals, and shoes scattered about. I went further in and noticed something. A small handle on the floor next to Asahina’s bed. I went closer to it and moved some of the objects blocking it. I took a deep breath and opened it.

The smell was rancid. It smelled of rotting flesh, not like the room was not before. I flashed my light down. It was a small room. Bare of furniture and decoration. But, multiple dried corpses made up for that. I had counted 6. 6 poor men, faces trapped eternally screaming. That's when I heard an actual scream. I stood up and sprinted to where I heard it. I saw through a sliding door, the silhouet of Asahina. I rammed through it and took aim. But that's when I saw what she was doing.

Izumi was lying on the floor, and she was biting into his throat. I could only stare in horror. She looked up, and smiled, giggling as she did so. Blood dripped from her lips. But it then got worse. I saw her wrinkles begin to fade. Her hair darkened. And her laugh began to change.

“..... toko?”

Her laughter continued. Getting more… and more horrifying. I looked down at Izumi. He was barely breathing. His eyes had rolled back in his head, and he was twitching.

“Did you miss this face?” She asked.

“You’re… You… You killed…”

“Not dead…. Yet.” 

She stood up and smiled wider.

“Now. Let’s play a game. Hide and seek. You hide. And I seek.” 

Asahina then collapsed to the ground, her limbs contorted and bent in inhuman ways. She then crawled into another room at an inhuman speed. I fell back, breathing heavily. I got my bearings and crawled over to Izumi. I grabbed him and felt his pulse.

“Dead.”

I began breathing heavier before I punched the floor.

“FUCK!” I screamed. I then let out an agonizing yell.

I punched the floor again and again before standing up. I slapped myself and tried to gain my composure. 

“No time to mourn… I’m sorry, Izumi. Forgive me.”

I turned and walked out of the room. I removed the magazine from the gun and looked in it. 10 shots. 10 chances to kill the Rokurokubi. Atleast at a safe distance. I reloaded the gun and began to walk down the hall. I heard a scratch from behind me and spun around. Nothing. I then felt something land on my shoulder. I touched it and looked at my fingers. Blood. I slowly looked up.

Asahina was on all fours on the ceiling. Her body was contorted and her limbs bent in disgusting ways. She had a blank expression on her face, and her eyes had rolled back in her head, making them appear white. 

“Hello.” She said.

She then screamed, and attempted to bite me. I moved out of the way, but her neck wrapped around my waist. Her body dropped from the ceiling as her head rose. She attempted to bite my neck, but I grabbed my gun and shot her twice in the neck. She screamed and her body attempted to crawl away. I grabbed her neck and began to strangle it. Her head thrashed around as I put the gun up to her throat point blank. I fired shot after shot. She bit me in the hip, but I hit her head with the gun. 

I ran out of bullets. I grabbed her head and right hooked it before grabbing a vase and breaking it over her head. I began screaming. Not in fear. I had lost that after Izumi died. Instead. It was of rage. Of hatred. I grabbed a large shard of the vase and stomped down upon her neck once again. She tried getting away, but I wouldn’t let her. I began ripping into it with the shard.

“IZUMI HARU! I AVENGE YOU! THE DEATH OF THIS ROKUROKUBI SHALL BE MY PAYMENT! ASAHINA! HEAR ME! THIS IS YOUR DEMISE. ALL OF YOUR CARNAGE. ALL THE SUFFERING. I STOP NOW!”

She lets out one final scream before her head falls limp. I continue hacking away at her neck. The shard has torn into my hand, but I did not care. I decapitated her, and dragged her head to me. I began stomping on it. Making sure she will never return. I stood up, blood covering me, and I turned. I looked for matches and oil. I found some. It wasn’t hard. I grabbed them and walked over to the body. I poured the oil and trailed it to the room I found Izumi in. I picked him up, and walked. I lit a match, and dropped it into the oil. A great fire began to engulf the halls as I walked out with Izumi in my arms.

A neighbor of ours had called the police due to the screams. They showed up as I emerged. They saw me and told me to get on the ground. I was arrested, but after investigating, and finding the Rokurokubi’s corpse, they let me go. I now sit here, writing. I survived. And I avenged the fallen.

To Asahina, I hope wherever you ended up, you’re suffering. Your carnage has ended. And I stopped you. No more bodies. No more blood. No more oil. Good riddance, you long necked bastard.

And to Izumi. I’m so… So sorry. I shouldn’t have dragged you into it. I avenged you, but the guilt I carry is still immersible. I will never forget you. And I will never forgive myself for dragging you into a battle you shouldn’t have been in. Goodbye Izumi. I am sorry.
