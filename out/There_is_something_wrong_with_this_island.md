I have seen some things today, some weird things I can't explain. It's like the island is showing me its secrets. Opening up its pages but they're in a language I cannot understand. But maybe I should start at the beginning. 

I'm a 20 year old man. I moved to a small island off the coast of my home country a little less than 3 years ago. When I say small, I mean small. Its 14km long and about 4km wide on the widest part. You can go anywhere by bike or bus, which is what I most often use. 

I had to go to work today, like most of us. I work as an all rounder on a holiday park, but more often then not I am at the snackcounter, behind the restaurant, working with the fryers 8 hours a day. Its a boring, thankless job, but most guests are nice and my colleagues are amazing. 

Today was a pretty busy day for winter time. The guests came, ordered, got their food and went back to their own lives, while I was still stuck in this dead end job without a degree. But we make our choices and deal with the consequences.

Around 7pm I went out for a smoke. The snackcounter had calmed down and I could finally get a little break before the chaos started all over again. I sat behind the restaurant, the toxic smoke filled my lungs and calmed my head. A rat ran past me and hid beneath the garbage can in the corner. 

One thing you need to know about me is that I absolutely adore animals, my house is filled with pets and I cannot see an animal without stopping and having a look. So, as always, I tried to coax the rat from underneath the garbage can. 

"Hey little buddy," I said as I squatted before it, my feet planted in a puddle of filth I'd rather not know what it once was. "Is it interesting under there?"

I heard some shuffeling but the rat did not come out, they never did. 
"Its busy today," I told the rat, "but a cigarette helps. But not for you, bud! You're definitly too young." 
I chuckled at my own joke before sitting back down in the chair to finish the rest of my cigarette. 

To my amazement the rat came from under the garbage can, sitting down in front of me and staring at me with small, beady black eyes. Its fur shined in the light coming out of the restaurant. 
"Wow!" I said," you're a big boy! The garbage must be good here."

The rat scuffled a little closer, smelling my shoes. I tried to stay as still as possible as not to scare it off. The rat had weird little paws, more humanlike then they normally were. Its snout was longer and pointy teeth were barely poking out from under its lips. 

"I have to go, buddy," I told the rat and I took one last drag from my cigarette before putting it out on the ground. 

The rat got spooked and bit down hard into my shoe. I tried to shake it off but it had a tight grip. I grabbed its body and pulled it off, flinging it towards the garbage can before it could strike again. As soon as it hit the ground it sprung up and ran towards me. 

I quickly ran to the restaurant door, closing it behind me and I saw the rat slowly walk away through the window. 

"Whats wrong?" Chloe, the cook, asked as I stepped into the kitchen and popped a mint into my mouth. "You look like you've seen a ghost."

"There was this weird fucking rat," I told her. "It bit into my shoe and wouldn't let go."
I showed her my shoe where the rat had left two little holes. 

"Jesus," Natasha cursed, "that doesn't look like rat teeth."
"Yeah, I know. It had these fucked up canines or something. Like I said, it was a weird rat." 
A guest walked into the snackcounter and I greeted them, continuing my work. 

Nothing of note happened for the rest of the evening. I gave some kids a free ice cream and a woman had yelled at me because we didn't have any milkshakes. 

Around 9pm I went home. Natasha offered to drive me, but I live about 10 minutes away and had to swing by the store the next day so I politely declined. 

I said my goodbye's, put on my gloves, turned my e-bike on and left. 

Like I said, I live on a small island. It has 4 villages and between them is mostly farmland or forest. For some reason, the local goverment had decided that just the villages needed streetlights, so for most of my way home it was pitch black. I knew the road blind, thankfully, as my bike light only lit up the white dividers which I followed to stay on the road. 

I was about halfway, enjoying the quiet evening and carefully watching out for crossing bunnies, mice and whatever else woke up at sunset. 

In the corner of my eyes I saw a deer standing on the side of the fields. Deer were a rare sight on the island so I stopped my bike to watch it for a bit. My breaks peeped as I squized them and the deers head shot up, staring at me. 

"Hey there," I said, eventhough I knew the deer was too far away to hear me. "Wow, you're so pretty!" 
The deer cocked its head. 
"Don't pretend to hear me, buddy, I am all the way over here." 

Then the deer rose up, still watching me. It stood on its hind legs, its front legs hanging by its side eventhough its joints shouldn't be able to bend that way. My heart started racing in my chest as the, definitly not a deer, kept staring at me. 

I stood frozen on the road. I had to go past it, there was no other way home. I could go back to work, but everyone had left. What was I supposed to do? Wait there until sunrise? 

No, I told myself, I am just seeing things. The deer must have ran off already, it was just a tree, or a weird crop or something, but that was not a deer. 

I started cycling again. The closer I came to the not-deer the clearer it became. 
That was not a tree, I could see its eyes fixated on me. Its pointy antlers up in the sky. 
I tried to convince myself it wasn't real, that my eyes decieved me, but I was very unconvincing. 

My speed picked up, 20km per hours, 24km, 28km, 30km. I made it home in record time, only slowing down as I rode into my street. The cold air burned in my throat with every breath I took. I put my bike against the fence, not wanting to waste time to put it in the shed. 

I slammed the door behind me harder then I should have, scaring my cat who had been waiting by the door. I stepped into my illuminated kitchen trying to catch my breath. 

My boyfriend stood up from the coach and came up to me, concerned.
"Whats wrong, baby?" He asked and I tried to find my words. 
"There was this rat at work," I said, "and, and this fucking deer. But it wasn't a deer. And its joints bent..."

My boyfriend stopped me and sat me down on the coach. 
"Take a deep breath," he said, and I listened. "Okay, now, try again."
I took another breath. 

"I was smoking at work," I told him, "and this weird fucking rat bit me. It had canines and it was huge, like, abnormally huge. Then, I went home and I saw a deer in the field."
My boyfriend was patiently listening as I finished the story. 

He handed me a glass of water and I drank it in one go. He put his arm around me and gave me a hug. 
"Couldn't you just have seen a tree?" He asked as he pulled away and I shrugged. "I mean, it's dark and your mind could be playing tricks on you."

"It could," I answered, "but it was so vivid. I could not imagine a tree looking like that."
"Maybe you just need some sleep."
"Maybe." I was quiet for a bit. It wasn't a tree, it couldn't be. 

So, here I am, laying in bed. My boyfriend is sound asleep next to me but I just can't catch it. I have another shift tommorow. Maybe I should ask some people who were raised here whether they have ever heard of stuff like this. Maybe, in the daylight, I'll see it actually was a tree, and not a deer. Maybe the rat was just malformed and well fed. 

But I don't know, I really don't know. It just seemed so real. I'll update you all when I know something more.
