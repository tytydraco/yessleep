&#x200B;

The boat arrived today.

&#x200B;

I could see them unloading our things from the windows of the house, as Ma and Pa showed us around. The house has its charms and is not too dissimilar from the farmhouse we have left behind. It is sturdy and warm, yet the emptiness of it unsettles me a little. There are memories of a past life here. Not mine, but the former keepers. It feels as if we are stepping into the life of someone else. The furniture remains as they left it. The beds are made but I still smell someone else in the sheets.

&#x200B;

I did catch a brief glimpse of them as we departed the boat. Another family, waiting by the docks. There were only three of them. A weary eyed man, his taciturn wife and a child younger than my brother and I.

&#x200B;

I wonder who’s bed I am now occupying… this room does not seem like a childs room.

&#x200B;

Pa did briefly stop to speak with the prior lighthouse keeper, although I was not privy to their conversation. Ma had escorted Christian and I to the house so that we could begin to get everything in order, and within no short amount of time the work had begun.

&#x200B;

My main duty was tending to the animals. There was a small barn a short distance from the house, near the edge of the endless forest where a few pigs, goats and chickens were kept. I fed them, ensured they had unfrozen water and ensured they were in good health. As far as I can tell, they are. Tending to those animals made me somewhat nostalgic. I thought of the farm back home. Of the animals we had kept there, and when those thoughts entered my mind I could not help but feel a slight grief for what we had lost. I know that misfortune is inevitable and that our farm was not the only one touched by the blight, but that our crops had suffered the worst while others had managed to make do still bothered me. I know it was just random chance, but that did not take the sting out.

&#x200B;

I know there is no point in dwelling on the misfortunes of the past, but…

&#x200B;

…

&#x200B;

I did allow myself a moment to look out at the forest. It was beautiful, even in winter. Pale, naked birch trees stretching skyward amongst a field of unbroken white. Even in the visual, there is a cold that cuts me to the bone, yeti is still beautiful all the same. Ma called me in before I could lose too much time looking, but I cannot help but think that if I must be exiled from my old life, then at least my exile will be a beautiful one.

&#x200B;

My heart aches for home… but I am still optimistic about our future here.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Excerpt from the Diary of Emily Finch**

**December 15th, 1933**

&#x200B;

We continue to settle into our new lives here, and I cannot deny the quiet out here is mostly peaceful. The weather has taken a turn for the worse - but this was something Pa had expected. With the flurries, comes the necessity of the foghorn which did grate on me initially… although I am surprised with how quickly I have grown used to it.

&#x200B;

After some time, the periodic drone of it fades into the background and while I am always aware of it, I’ve learned to accept it as has my family. I’ve noticed the way that conversations will fade at intervals so that the horn will not drown us out, before resuming as if nothing had happened once it had sounded. Even though I did not sleep the first night we had it, I’ve since learned to ignore it.

&#x200B;

It is strange. Even the drone of the fog horn does little to dispel the odd serenity I feel out here, so far away from the rest of the world. The spray of the sea has frozen to the lighthouse, draping it in thick icicles that obscure the tower beneath and transforming it into a breathtaking castle of ice. The light still shines through at night, but in daylight it is a sight to behold!

&#x200B;

I still miss home… but for the first time since we left, I feel my optimism for the future is not just a simple act. I've noticed that Ma and Pa smile more, now that the farm is a fading memory and the fear of beginning anew has started to pass. As we settle into a new routine, I can sense the burden off their shoulders. I even caught them sharing a moment, laughing at a funny little coincidence in their outfits for the day. Matching overalls, with different colored shirts. Pa's red flannel, hers yellow and with a floral print. Just watching them - for a moment I forgot about the misfortunes that had plagued our family and driven us out here. Their infectious happiness brought a smile back to my face and I could not help but wonder if someday I too might share such contentment with my own future husband.

&#x200B;

Even Christian seems to be in better spirits. He's been mighty interested in helping Pa tend to the light, considering how it will likely become his responsibility one day, if we do wind up staying here… And in truth - I hope we do. It's no harder than the life we lived on the farm and despite the dreary weather we're already happy here. For the first time in a long time, I truly feel as if we might be okay and that kind of hope feels better than anything right now.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Excerpt from the Diary of Emily Finch**

**December 17th, 1933**

&#x200B;

I awoke today to find that something had been skulking around the barn last night. Something killed our chickens. Tore them to pieces, spilling blood and giblets all over the place. It took the eggs too. The nests were empty, with only a few broken shells to prove there ever had been eggs to steal in the first place. Not a single bird survived and the meat is no good to eat. Something else has been gnawing at it.

&#x200B;

Pa says it’s probably a wolf, a fox or a coyote. I know he’s likely right, but I don’t remember ever seeing one of those critters tear open a chicken coop before.

&#x200B;

The coop was almost completely reduced to splinters, as if whatever killed them had darn near torn it apart just to get at them. I asked Christian if he’s ever seen anything like it, since he’s older. But he just shook his head and said he hadn’t.

&#x200B;

The other animals are scared.

&#x200B;

I went in and checked on them. The goats were in a panic and the pigs wouldn’t stop screaming. I think they can still smell whatever was creeping around the barn last night. Pa says we need to lock it up extra tight, but after what that animal did to the chicken coop, I’m worried it won’t be enough. I think he is too.

&#x200B;

I noticed him unpacking his rifle before supper. He and Christian went out soon after, although I didn’t hear any gunshots. The wind and the horn probably drowned them out.

&#x200B;

I should have asked to go with them. Pa told me that I was too young to shoot a gun last year, but I’m almost 14 now! I ought to be able to handle it by now, and considering what that animal did to our chicken coop it might be a good idea to have someone else who can shoot.

&#x200B;

The snow is getting a little worse.

&#x200B;

A few nights ago, I could still see ships in the distance, passing by in the night. Now I don’t see them anymore. I don’t feel that same serenity I felt before… all of a sudden it’s turned. The isolation doesn’t feel as peaceful now. Now I just can’t shake this heavy feeling in my guts… I tell myself that this too shall pass. But I also said that about the Blight.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Excerpt from the Diary of Emily Finch**

**December 19th, 1933**

&#x200B;

It’s still in the woods.

&#x200B;

Christian and Pa have been out looking for it. They shot a fox, and Christian hopes that it’s the same animal that killed our chickens, but I know better. We all know better.

&#x200B;

The other animals in the barn are still scared. At night, I can hear them screaming, even from my bedroom. Their screams cut through the howling wind outside. I can’t help but wonder if they know something is close by… and if they already know that the barn will not protect them. As I lay in my bed I find myself wondering how safe we are in this house.

&#x200B;

*My bed…*

&#x200B;

No… not my bed. Not really.

&#x200B;

I can not sleep tonight. Not after what I found today.

&#x200B;

I don’t know much about the family that used to live here, that tended the lighthouse before we came. I know that Pa told us that we would be staying at the lighthouse. He told us that when he could no longer tend to the light, the job would fall to Christian, then later to his children and my children. It would be the responsibility of our family… as I suspect it once was the responsibility of the family who lived here before.

&#x200B;

The family who built their lives here.

&#x200B;

The family who had left this place behind.

&#x200B;

I saw the grave as I was outside feeding the animals this afternoon. It was a short distance away from the barn, by a large tree on the edge of the forest. I had not paid much attention to it before, but one of the younger goats, who I’ve taken to calling Little Miss (Miss being short for Mischief) had gotten out and it had wandered over toward the tree. I had to pick the poor thing, who was shaking from the cold and carry her back to the warmth of the barn… but as I collected her I noticed the small, snow covered wooden cross pressed up against the bark of the tree.

&#x200B;

On that cross was etched a name.

&#x200B;

*Tom Pattinson.*

*1917-1933*

&#x200B;

A grave.

&#x200B;

I came back to inspect it after I had taken Little Miss to safety. Even without the year carved into the wood, I could tell that the cross was relatively new. Was this why the previous keepers had left this place? A tragic loss?

&#x200B;

I remembered that the child they’d brought with them had been fairly young… and I am quite sure that it was that child's room that Christian had claimed as his own. It was the larger of the rooms we had to choose between, and I remembered that he had spent a day taking down the circus wallpaper, and putting on a fresh coat of paint to make it more to his taste.

&#x200B;

My room required no such alterations. The bed was large and comfortable, needing only fresh linens, although it did smell as if someone else had once slept there. The walls were plain and painted in a neutral white, and the sparse furniture in here was bare. An empty desk, an empty dresser, an empty night table… no trace of whoever had been here once upon a time.

&#x200B;

I’d thought nothing of it back then.

&#x200B;

Now; I cannot dispel the thought that I am sleeping in a dead man's bed.

&#x200B;

Or… not sleeping, I suppose.

&#x200B;

The wind is howling outside.

I cannot hear the ocean.

The animals are screaming.

And I wonder if they’re warning us.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Excerpt from the Diary of Emily Finch**

**December 20th, 1933**

&#x200B;

It came back last night.

&#x200B;

It tore its way into the barn, ripping the doors off their hinges. Most of our pigs and goats are either dead or missing, including Little Miss. It… it tore her in two… feeding on her innards…

&#x200B;

I only hope she died quickly.

&#x200B;

What few animals we have left are not safe.

&#x200B;

Something is strange about this animal. It slaughters almost indiscriminately. It feeds… this much I can be sure of. But it kills almost out of spite. There’s a cruelty to it, one I cannot fathom.

&#x200B;

I cannot stop thinking about Tom Pattinson.

&#x200B;

What killed him?He was a young man… judging by the dates on his grave, he must have been about 16. Was it illness? An accident? Or were the former keepers of this lighthouse fleeing something? Had we simply gone from one bleak situation to the next?

&#x200B;

I do not know.

&#x200B;

Christian and Pa went out looking for some of our animals. They found a couple of goats, but none of the pigs. Better than nothing, I suppose.

&#x200B;

Pa managed to repair the barn, but his repairs are not very sturdy. There is little that would protect the few animals we have left from that creatures return.

&#x200B;

As I write now - they are watching the barn. Pa is on watch now, and soon Christian will take over while Pa sleeps. I hope they can deter it.

I want to have faith.

But I feel I’ve wasted the last of my optimism.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Excerpt from the Diary of Emily Finch**

**December 21st, 1933**

&#x200B;

The gunshots woke me up. Several of them in quick succession, ringing out through the darkness of the early morning.

&#x200B;

I rushed out of my bed and ran to the window to look out, although even though the storm was much lighter than it had been, I could see nothing through the darkness. I could hear Pa and Christian yelling, and knew that our unseen tormentor had returned.

&#x200B;

When daylight broke, we saw blood in the snow. So if nothing else we know that whatever is out there *can* be wounded and in all likelihood can die. That brought me some comfort, and Pa clapped Christian on the back and told him he’d done well in hitting our unseen tormentor, as that would make the creature easier to track. Christian did not say a word as Pa went back inside to prepare for their impending pursuit of this thing. He only stared at the blood in silence, standing like a statue in the drifting snow.

&#x200B;

I asked him what was the matter, he did not immediately reply. I had to ask a second time before I got an answer out of him. He told me that he had seen it last night. While it had been creeping out of the trees and making its way toward the barn, he had seen it.

&#x200B;

I asked what it had looked like - had it been another fox, or a wolf or even a bear. He simply shook his head.

*“No…”* He said. *“It was a man.”*

&#x200B;

The certainty in his tone gave me pause. I almost wanted to ask if he was sure about what he’d seen, but it was obvious to me that *he knew.*

He knew without a doubt what he’d seen.

A man…

&#x200B;

Without a further word, he turned around to follow Pa inside. We did not speak again until I said my goodbyes as he and Pa left an hour later to track down our mystery beast.

&#x200B;

They did not return.

&#x200B;

As night fell, and Ma’s worry grew, we could only watch darkening woods while the storm began to pick up again and the snowfall grew more intense.

&#x200B;

As Pa had not returned, it fell to me to tend the light. Pa had explained some of it to Christian and I, but I did still struggle with it. Despite my inexperience I do believe I did a good job… and that small amount of pride taken in my work is just about the only comfort I have right now.

&#x200B;

As I write now, Ma stokes the fire in the hearth and right now there is little difference between her busywork and my writing. We are trying not to think about the stark reality we may soon be facing if Pa and Christian do not return home soon.

&#x200B;

There is a radio in the house that we can use if needed, but the storm has made it difficult to reach anyone too far away, and even if we could reach someone, help may not arrive for us any time soon. If Pa is not back in the morning we will still try.

Even if he does return, we may still try.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Excerpt from the Diary of Emily Finch**

**December 22nd, 1933**

&#x200B;

Pa stumbled in from the woods this morning, frostbitten and rambling. Christian was not with him.

&#x200B;

Ma now stands vigil by his bedside, although she cannot pull the gun from his hands. He clings to it for dear life and will not let go.

&#x200B;

We have tried to raise someone on the radio.There is no response.

No one can hear us.

I see no ships on the horizon. I see no sign of civilization outside of the frozen lighthouse.

We are alone out here.

&#x200B;

I do not know what happened to Pa and Christian out in the forest.

I do not know what he saw.

But I do know what it all means.

&#x200B;

In coming here, we have traded one hell for another, and unlike with the Blight, there is no escape this time. There is nowhere to run. Outside, there is nothing for us but miles and miles of hell that makes the cold embrace of the frozen sea seem welcoming. For it is not the sea that I fear, it is the forest.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Excerpt from the Diary of Emily Finch**

**December 23rd, 1933**

&#x200B;

It returned last night, while we slept.

&#x200B;

Predictably - the animals in the barn are all dead. I do not need to go and check, for I can see the blood on the snow from the house and there is a telling silence in the air. They are dead. The meat cannot be salvaged… and that is not all.

&#x200B;

The previous keeper of the lighthouse maintained a small pantry in the cellar. There was not much there, but there might have been enough to get us through the winter, if we rationed it. Now though - that pantry is gone. Something dug through the wall. Something broke in and ransacked everything.

&#x200B;

Pa says that this is not just the work of a hungry animal. He swears that this was an act of spite. Revenge, taken upon us for the sin of wounding this demon that stalks us from the trees. He almost seemed ready to go out after it again, but Ma forced him to reconsider. The cold would kill him long before the creature would.

&#x200B;

He still clutches the gun as if his life depends on it, and I can see a newfound madness in his eyes. Were I not more afraid of whatever is stalking us outside, I may have been afraid of him. He watches the windows, searching for any sign of movement. He still has not spoken about what he saw out there. He has not even spoken about the light, which I have continued to tend as he is in no condition to do so.

&#x200B;

Ma does not like me going out to climb the tower, but I have insisted. Despite the dangers of whatever lurks outside, as well as the (by this point, laughably mundane) risk of ice sloughing off the frozen tower and crushing me, the work must be done. Should the light not be tended - someone could crash upon the rocks here, and be subjected to a worse hell than the one we now occupy.

&#x200B;

Ma and I have tried to salvage what we can from the pantry… but there is so little. Pa has discussed butchering the dead animals to try and salvage what we can. We are still trying to call for help on the radio, but no one has answered. I fear we may not have any luck until after the storm has passed, and even if we could get through to someone then, I know that help would not come until the new year.

&#x200B;

I want to hold on to hope - but I have none left. In my heart, I already know the truth. We are going to die here. Be it from starvation, cold or the beast, we will die out here… and there will be no headstone to mark our graves.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Excerpt from the Diary of Emily Finch**

**December 24th, 1933**

&#x200B;

It came again.

&#x200B;

The first time was last night. I did not see it, but I heard Pa shooting at it. He said he saw it retreat back into the woods, and posted a vigil out front, waiting for it to make its return. He did not move for several hours, and only relented when Ma forced him to come inside.

&#x200B;

He has not been sleeping much and the exhaustion is clear on his face. Ma guided him to his armchair and he was asleep the moment he sat down. She didn’t even have time to brew him some coffee.  After that incident, the day passed without any further excitement. There was little for us to do but wait and watch, and Pa did not wake again. I think the exhaustion had finally conquered him.

&#x200B;

As dusk fell I bundled myself up to go out and tend the light. As I did, I watched as Ma gently pulled the gun from Pa’s sleeping hands.

*“If you’re going out, I want you to take this.”* She told me. I told her that I did not know how to shoot, and she showed me.

&#x200B;

It was not much of a lesson… but I suppose she reasoned it was enough for the fifty feet I’d need to walk to reach the lighthouse.

&#x200B;

Under the darkening sky, the frozen lighthouse looked like a chapel to honor winter itself. A thick layer of pale ice seemed draped over it, turning it from something mundane into something beautiful. I clutched the rifle close as I made my way through the wooden door and inside, where it was no warmer than outside. From there, I started up the stairs to clean the reflectors and light the lamps.

&#x200B;

The snow was not as bad as it had been, but I still  let the fog horns blare, to warn any oncoming ships away from the Hell we now occupied. Then, once my work was done I stared out at the sea, and allowed my mind to wander back home. Back to the farm where we had once been happy… where I had grown up, playing under the warm sun, dreaming of the person I’d become and never once imagining I’d die cold, young and so far from home.

&#x200B;

I really did try to be optimistic…

I really did…

But optimism only gets one so far.

&#x200B;

As the sun set, I thought I caught a few glimpses of the moon behind the clouds, and as I sat on the stairs of the Lighthouse, I quietly wished myself a Merry Christmas.

&#x200B;

Christmas… I’d forgotten about that up until that moment. We hadn’t even set up a tree. Swallowing down my lamentations, I descended the stairs to return to the house. It was only after I’d reached the bottom and opened wooden door to step back out into the cold that I heard the screams.

&#x200B;

Through the snow and the darkness, I could see the lights of the house, and I could see the shadows moving in the windows.

&#x200B;

One I recognized as Pa.

The other I did not recognize… but it was far too big to be a man.

&#x200B;

I could not see much, but I could see some kind of struggle… and a moment later, the back door to the house flew open as Ma ran out into the cold. I heard her screaming my name. Telling me to get back into the lighthouse and to barricade the door… then I saw the shape emerge from the house behind her.

&#x200B;

I could not see it clearly through the snow, but it moved faster than I had ever seen anything else move, bearing down upon my mother and grabbing her with dark, frostbitten hands. She screamed in terror as he dragged her to the ground, burying her in the snow. Her limbs thrashed in wild panic, desperately trying to throw this *thing* off of her and even from where I stood I could see the terror in her eyes as it tore into her with long, jagged fingernails. I heard the croak in her voice as the life was violently ripped from her body and knew that there was no saving her. She was already dead… and Pa almost certainly was too.

&#x200B;

I slammed the door, and tried as best I could to block it with a wooden table nearby. I already knew it would not hold, and so holding Pa’s rifle close I raced back up the stairs hoping that I may find salvation up there.

&#x200B;

The distant sound of something reducing the door of the lighthouse to nothing more than a pile of splinters told me that there would be no salvation to find… and near the top of the stairs, I found my tomb. There was nowhere left to run… and the sound of deaths heavy footsteps on the iron stairs behind me grew louder and louder with each passing second.

&#x200B;

I turned, unable to breathe as I looked down the stairs to see what it was that came for me… and even now I have no words to describe it.

&#x200B;

Christian had described it as: *‘A man’.* But that word does not do it justice.

&#x200B;

It held the shape of a man… but in no other way would I have described that *thing* as human. Its skin was blackened with frostbite, and clung too tightly to its bones turning it into a gangly, feral looking thing. Its hair was long and matted, and it had a tangled, knotted beard slick with frozen blood. Despite the beard - its face was utterly inhuman, looking more corpselike than mortal. The lips had long since been chewed off and the flesh was tattered and putrid. The nose was absent, leaving only a ragged hole in the center of its face… yet the eyes… the eyes were the only thing about it I *would* describe as human, as even though they were bloodshot and wide, I still saw intelligence in them. I still saw a soul.

&#x200B;

It was as I looked into those all too human eyes that I pulled the trigger the first time. The ghoul recoiled as the bullet struck it, slumping against the wall of the lighthouse, but it did not stop its frantic pace up the stairs.

&#x200B;

I fired again. The second round either missed or only grazed it, as it did not slow. It drew closer… and was now only a few feet away from me.

&#x200B;

I hastily chambered my final round as it raced toward me, its blackened, tattered mouth opening in a feral scream. I almost dropped the bullet, but by the grace of God I chambered it… and pulled the trigger.

&#x200B;

The final bullet tore through its head, spattering a smear of blood and viscera on the wall behind it. Its eyes glazed over, although its body did not stop moving. The limbs flailed as it lost control and it seemed to lose its balance, sending it plummeting back down the stairs about a half flight. It hit the railing before tipping over it and plummeting down to the floor far below with a final thud.

&#x200B;

As the silence set in, I stood there unmoving. My blood rushed in my ears and I waited for the sound of movement to begin again, but there was nothing.

I was alone.

I *am* alone…

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Excerpt from the Diary of Emily Finch**

**December 25th, 1933**

&#x200B;

The ground is too hard and the snow is too thick to bury Ma and Pa. I have placed what remains of them outside… and only pray nothing else scavenges their corpses.

&#x200B;

I did not extend the same courtesy to the creature, who I put several more bullets into and beheaded, before dragging its corpse to the edge of the cliff and throwing them onto the rocks below. The head, I smashed with the axe.

&#x200B;

Better to be sure.

&#x200B;

The house is damaged - but I think I can manage to make a few repairs to keep me from the cold. I do not know how long I can make my limited supplies last though, even if I ration them. I will do what I can, but I am trying not to instill myself with false hope.

&#x200B;

I will still tend the light for as long as I can, as I can not determine any benefit to letting it go out. But when I am not with the light, I will remain by the radio and continue to attempt to call for help. I must not instill in myself the hope that I may be rescued… yet there is a part of me that clings to it anyway.

&#x200B;

Apparently after everything, I’m still an optimist.

&#x200B;
