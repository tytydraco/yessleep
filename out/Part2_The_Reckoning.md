*"Once spoken, a word is a seed. And sometimes, it grows into something you can't take away."*

Years don't necessarily bring peace. Wounds are closed up and silently rot beneath them. It had been almost a decade since the night that I had made the joke. A decade since I had looked into the face—or absence thereof—of that which I had addressed as. The bride had three kids now. My cousin, with whom I walked home that evening, had long moved away, as if space could elongate the memory. But I stayed. And I remembered.

Every day.

I tried to tell myself it wasn't real. A hallucination of fear, the darkness of the woods, the weight of tradition and the lateness of night. But that excuse perished the day I heard of the fifth village to fall ill. The patterns were too cruel to ignore. Always west. Always after the passage of a traveler. Always quiet before the sickness had spread like rot.

And the shame clung to me like a second skin.

Humans forgot, as humans are prone to do. The dead were buried. New crops pushed up through the earth. But I could not forget. I stopped laughing. Stopped sleeping. I would stand outside my hut at sundown, staring out into the distance, hoping the shape would return—half-hoping it would, half-hoping that it wouldn't.

When my hair went gray and my back started to slouch, I knew I couldn't wait any longer. Regret is a stagnant thing. It festers when left to itself. I had to *do* something—even if I failed.

I began with the ancient. Those whose memories were deeper than wells. I asked questions no one wished to hear. I paid in grain, oil, favors. Most rejected me. But one man—blind in both eyes, fingers darkened by time—spoke a name. Not the monster's name, but the kind of being it was.

*Panvati*.

He spat when he said it, as though the word had somehow polluted his tongue.

They don't come from places," he rasped. "They come from moments. From wrongness. From invitations not meant to be issued, but spoken nonetheless.

I pleaded with him for more. Where did it go? How could it be prevented? He spoke to me of a shrine, far in the Ghats, older than any village, constructed for unmaking. Not to worship—but to *undo*.

I left the next day.

My legs were weak. My joints ached with every movement. But I went. Guilt pushed me forward, every step an expiation. I moved through the towns that had survived, but you could still feel it there—the unspoken fear, the early closing of the windows, the manner in which no one laughed too loudly after dark.

I listened more and spoke less.

The road to the shrine was half-hidden in vines and myth. It took days. When I found it, it was a ring of stones at the top of a hill, weathered by wind and time. And yet, it pulsed with a presence—as if silence had mass here.

I knelt down. I placed my hands on the ground.

I withdraw that statement,\" I added.

Nothing spoken. I tried it again, louder. "I unsay what I said. I was wrong. I was foolish. I spoke in jest, and now I kneel in sorrow. Take it back. Take *me* instead."

The air grew heavy. The woods fell silent. And then the shadows separated.

It appeared—not from behind a tree, but from the silences between moments. As if it had been there all along, waiting for the words. Still on four legs, still blind, still not speaking.

But this time, it spoke—not with a voice.

You can't undo what bore you.

I pitched forward, brow on the ground. "Then let it end with me."

It came closer, so near I could hear the wet shift of its skin.

**It doesn't end,**" it went on. "**It waits. For another voice. Another laugh in the dark.**

I began to cry. Not because I was scared—but because of its size. I was not alone. I had not opened it alone. But I had opened it first.

The creature turned. It walked away. Again.

And I knew then: this was not something that could be killed. Or reasoned with. Or undone. It had shape only because *we* gave it shape. It had life because we—humans—had filled it with careless breath.

Now I speak to anyone who will listen. Children, strangers, tourists. I tell the story. I do not lie about it. I do not gloss over it. Sometimes they laugh. Sometimes they sneer. But sometimes—sometimes only—a face will go white, and someone will ask:

Did you actually see it?

And I'll tell you only this: "No. I *invited* it." And then I remind them not to babble into the void. Not because something might respond, but because something already has. And it's still listening.
