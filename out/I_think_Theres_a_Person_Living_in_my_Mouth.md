“Yes, Dr Kelstein, everything seems good, I do have to thank you one more time, you’ve been a real help! You practically saved my life!”“The pleasure is all mine,” Replied a heavily Austrian accented voice on the phone.“I will be leaving the country tomorrow on business leave so you won’t be able to contact me after tonight, I wish you a wonderful evening, goodbye.”“Goodbye,” I said before hanging up.I inspected my mouth in the mirror. Moving it around. I couldn’t help but marvel at its smoothness. My jaw brace had made me the laughing stock of school which would probably last until I graduated but now it felt worth it. I smiled wide, I had gotten braces as well and the results were clear. Sparkling white teeth shined at me. I can hardly believe these are the same yellow crooked teeth I had before. I figured I couldn’t look any weirder with the jaw brace and decided to get braces as well. Dr Kelstein had said that it would be added free of charge. In fact, to my surprise, at the end of the procedure he had said that everything would be free of charge. He was awfully kind, but I got goosebumps and a shiver down my spine just thinking about him. He wore black goggles all the time for some reason,making him look like a giant bug and his pale skin combined with the sterile environment made him seem almost inhumane. When I had given him a handshake his hand was ice-cold. Thinking back to the hard stainless steel operating table I had been on and the tight leather restraints keeping my hands and feet in place I wonder why they had done that. There had been something about it being a new procedure but I still don’t know why they did that for a jaw surgery… I opened my mouth wide, my mouth would have clicked painfully before but now they opened smoothly. I could feel that my life would be easier now, gone were the days of having my toothbrush scrape my lips just trying to reach my back teeth. I peered down the back of my throat. I had never been able to open my mouth this wide before. A pair of eyes stared at me. I snapped my mouth shut. Did I just … There’s no way, I must be crazy or hallucinating or something.I looked again but there was nothing. Maybe I was still feeling aftereffects from the anaesthetic or whatever drug was used during the surgery. But then again that had been weeks ago . . . I looked one more time just to cool my nerves. It was staring right at me. It was smiling. My sweat ran cold. It seemed to smile wider. A hand blocked out the face making its way up out of my throat. I dashed backwards, biting my mouth shut. What the hell was that? My breaths were heavy and fast. I clawed at my mouth and dashed back to the mirror. "Get out, get out!" I shouted but there was nothing. When I peered again, there was nobody there. I knew I wasn't crazy, I hadn’t imagined the person! That was [real!!](https://www.reddit.com/r/Shrike_Stories/)
