For a little bit of context, I'm 27 and I'm a writer. I have three published books. 

The one relevant to this story hasn't been finished yet. It's about a serial killer. It has 9 relevant characters, not including the killer. All characters are based around real people that I know, or know of. Some are friends of mine, some colleagues, my girlfriend, my younger brother, one celebrity, and the main character is based around me, which is kind of weird, I know. 

The killer isn't really based on anyone, it was simply a pigment of my imagination, inspired by a combination of other famous serial killers. 

The killer uses a variety of creative and painful methods to torture and kill in my book, to instill fear. If he catches you, you better pray you die a quick and painless death, which never happened. 

The first to die was Jonathan, he was based on a celebrity, and he too was a celebrity in the book. He was kidnapped on a friday night, while walking home for a long weekend where he had already informed everyone to not call, because he wouldn't answer. Which was the perfect time for the killer to strike. 

Since he was an actor, the killer tortured him by permanently ruining his looks, his face, his arms and legs. Over the 48 hours, they were burnt, cut, damaged, tattooed. His tongue was cut out. His misery was ended by a gun. A simple gunshot to the head, quite an anticlimatic finisher for all the torture he had to go through. 

As you know most serial killers keep a souvenir from their victims, this one did too, and a weird one at that. He always took their left shoe and sock. 

You might be wondering why I am telling you all this? I already said how the characters in this book are based on real people. Well one of them died last week, exactly as described in my fucking book. The actor that I just told you about. He was kidnapped on a friday, tortured by ruining his entire body, and then killed with a gunshot to the head. I saw it on the news a couple days ago. It was gruesome.

How the fuck is that possible? It can't be a copycat, the book isn't published yet, only a very select few of people even know of its existence. 

I decided called my mom, who was one of the characters in the book to talk about this.

"Did you see the news?"

"Yeah." My mother responded

"What the fuck?" I blurted out

She sighed. "I'm sure this is just a big coincidence." 

"Yeah right, down to the fucking missing left shoe and sock." 

She gasped. "That wasn't in the news?" She said, confused.

"I know, I googled." The document was on my laptop, which was always in my apartment, and also locked with a password only I knew. 

"Who else knows of the book?" My mom asked, I think she began thinking what I was thinking. 

"Only the eight people I used as a reference while writing and my editor." 

"Will you call them?" A deep sigh escaped my mouth. 

"Yeah." I muttered out. 

"Alright, let me know, love you." 

"Love you too mom." I hung up.

The rest of the calls to the rest of the people went the same. None of them had told anyone about it or shared the first draft I had given them. The actor never knew there was a character based on him. Now that I think about it.. No one knew this was the actor I was using as a reference point.. So how the hell? my head was hurting from all this thinking. Maybe it was just a big coincidence. 

The following few days I read the first few pages again, to see just how accurate it was to the crime that was comitted. It was 100% accurate. The copycat, or whatever it is didn't miss a thing. I kept reading, the second victim was coming up. It was based on a close friend of mine. She got into the wrong cab, thinking it was her uber. She was awoken in a dark, cold and empty warehouse, tied to a chair. Her torture was by far the worst. She's a therapist, so the killer made her feel. Really feel. All five of her senses were turned into pure pain. Her entire body was made to hurt with every little movement. Her ears were made to bleed by blasting disturbing sounds into her ears beyond what a human can handle. Her eyes were glued wide open, if she tried to close them, she'd feel the skin trying to rip away from the glue. She had something very hot, not spicy, but temperature hot shoved into her mouth. And then her mouth was tied shut so she couldn't speak. 

This was pain alright. She died 17 hours after being kidnapped from shock. 

This close friend who the character is based on, her name is Sasha, she was reported missing three hours ago. She was supposed to get into an uber and drive to one of our mutual friends for drinks, but she never arrived there. Her phone was off and there was no way to contact her. They called the cops. 

This is too real.. just too real. How can this be happening? It can't. It just.. it can't. 

Someone is killing the people in my book. I was in shock. I was crying. I needed to go to the police. I needed to tell them. Maybe they could still find Sasha, I mean I had the location as well, not the exact one, but a warehouse should make the search much, much easier, no?

I dialed 911. 

"Hello what is your emergency." A kind, warm, but alarmed voice asked from the other end.

"I uh.. I don't know how to say this uh.. My friend, Sasha, she was reported missing a couple hours ago and well, a couple days ago a celebrity was kidnapped and murdered.. And I have an unpublished book.. this book describes these kidnappings and murders.. I think someone is copying the killer from my book.." It felt like a heavy rock was lifted off my shoulders when I finished speaking, but my heart dropped when the voice responded.

"Listen, this is 911, we don't take kind to prank calls, so unless there's an actual emergency going on, I'm going to hang up." The voice sounded annoyed, almost angry.

"No! Wait! You don't understand! Someone is killing people in my book!" I blurted out desperately. 

"First the actor, now my friend who went missing, then there's more who will die!"

No response. I look at my phone. The call has ended, they hung up. I just began sobbing right then and there. It took me a while to calm down, but once I did, I made a decision. If they're not going to help me, then I will find Sasha myself. 

I got into my car and began driving, with no real destination in mind. I just knew she'd be in a warehouse. She had to be. 

I drove to every local warehouse around her last location, both abandoned and not. Because I was stupid enough to not specify that in my book. 

I got to the third before final warehouse on my list and got out of my car to investigate. It was abbandoned. There was a side door entrance and I tried the handle. It was locked. I walked around the entire building, there were no cars in sight. The warehouse was pretty spacey, and had two metal gates that could be opened from inside. I found no way to get in, and I couldn't just break in. So I sighed and got back into my car and drove away. 

The next two warehouses were much the same. Feeling defeated I checked in with the other friends, to see if they heard anything from Sasha, but the answer was unfortunately no. 

I drove home feeling helpless and hopeless. Blaming myself for what might currently be happening to her, for the pain she's going through. I cried myself to sleep.

I woke up the next morning to a bombardment of messages from friends and family, some telling me how sorry they are, others asking what the fuck was going on, and if they were going to die too. I put the two and two together. Sasha was found. I quickly opened the news and sure enough she had been found. Dead, strapped to a chair, in an abbandoned warehouse. The address was on display. My blood froze. That was one of the warehouses I was at yesterday, I just couldn't get in. If only I got in I could have saved her. 

It's all my fault that Sasha is dead. My mom called me and we talked about it again. She tried to console me, but it wasn't working. 

I decided to try and go to the police this time, instead of calling. I was turned away once again, because, and I quote: "No one has the time to entertain your theories of a serial killer." 

I cursed them out then and there, which got me thrown out, luckily not into a jail cell. 

I'm determined to save my remaining friends and family, I can't let them all die. According to my book the next to fall victim is Illiya, my ex. I already called her and she agreed to meet up, which is happening in less than an hour. 

I will try to update you all as soon as we come up with a plan.
