I’ve been telling myself these past few weeks that I wanted to get things back on the right foot, and a lot of that means being open to others about some of the stuff I’ve seen and, frankly, been an accessory to. I can’t really prove a lot of it, so I don’t think reporting anyone would do much good. I blew a lot of that when I had the chance. I don’t want to tell my family. I can’t afford a shrink. 

All of the names I’ve used are fake, save one, so as not to identify myself. What information I have has been given to the police and, as expected, they did nothing. I’m convinced a lot of the people ancillary to the situation were probably totally unaware that anything sinister was going on and it wouldn’t be fair to throw them under the bus. For the record, as far as I can tell, everything I did during the period of time I’m writing about was done under my own free will and with a sound mind. 

In June of 2020, I lost my job due to complications from the COVID pandemic. I was already having trouble making ends meet, so losing my job was obviously very stressful. I had to borrow money from my cousin and was at the point where I was strongly considering getting a loan from a shady business. Moving back home wasn’t really an option at the time.

I used to live in Nashville, TN, which is an extremely expensive place to live - even a smallish apartment on the outskirts of the city can run close to $2,000 a month in rent and that isn’t including utilities. All of this is to say: I needed a new job and fast or my life here was going to spiral out of control. I made a post on social media asking for help finding work.

After just a few hours, a guy I know texted me. I didn’t know him too well - we met at a concert shortly after I moved to the city and I was trying to meet and befriend as many people as possible. He was a nice guy though, and he told me that they were hiring at McKay’s - the store he worked at.

McKay’s is sort of a legendary store in Nashville, at least among people I know. I know that at one point it was a chain with several stores in Tennessee, but I’ve never been to them. It’s a massive second-hand space specializing in books, DVD’s, and music but they also carry comics, video games, and old electronics. People line up in the front of the store and fill giant crates with their old shit to sell and then the store shelves it. I can’t really describe just how big it truly is, so I encourage you to look up pictures. They have on-site security when you walk into the door. It’s a big store with a seemingly endless amount of media and there are a lot of hidden gems if you know where to look.

I got hired on as a stocker for the records. Every day, I’d come in to what seemed like hundreds of albums. I’d load them up on a tiny shopping cart, get on the elevator, and shelve them accordingly. It sounds boring, and it usually was, but my manager Kelly was really cool and she let me listen to earphones as I did it. I’d put on a podcast or my favorite playlist and spend the next several hours getting into the flow and putting albums away. 

Kelly was a nice lady. She kept her hair in a sort of Bettie Page hairdo and had thick glasses. I always thought she was really attractive and she was also a pretty cool boss. When you’re ‘behind the scenes’ at a place like McKay’s it’s easy for it to feel like working in a warehouse. You forget that you’re surrounded by awesome music, movies, and books. But Kelly would always make little comments about the materials we received. She was really into goth music like Gene Loves Jezebel or the Banshees or whatever and we bonded over that sometimes.

About a year went by…I think it was August of 2021 when we started to get more in the swing of things and allow more people into the building, etc. All of that time sort of blurs together, so I may be getting the dates wrong. Anyway, I remember having a Friday off and Kelly texted me asking if I wanted to grab drinks with her and some other people from McKay’s. I still didn’t have too many social friends in town, so I agreed to join them at this 50’s style tiki-bar called the Pearl Diver a few minutes outside downtown Nashville. It’s a really fun place. 

The bar closed at 2 AM, so it was probably at around one when we started to head out. I was pretty drunk, and Kelly offered to Uber me home. We had a discussion outside the bar and, well, one thing led to another and we decided to just go to her place. The next morning, I remember waking up without a hangover and Kelly fixing eggs in the kitchen. We made small talk, ate, and sort of skirted around the awkwardness of me having a hookup with my boss. A part of me wanted to ask her out. Even if it meant finding a new job, I had started to get pretty lonely and having a cool girlfriend would have done me a lot of good.

But before I could even bring it up, Kelly asked me if I knew about the ‘basement’ at work. Now, when you go to McKay’s, there’s two floors - on one floor is where you sell your stuff, buy movies, books, etc. and then upstairs is the music section. To anyone going in shopping, or even using the elevator, there is no basement. Kelly told me that, when McKay’s was built, physical media was significantly more popular and there was essentially a mid-size warehouse under the building. If that was true, it was news to me.

She told me that, on occasion, the general retail manager (a guy named Murphy) rented the space out to a group he knew and trusted. It was sort of an off the books thing, but sometimes if an employee was cool he’d let them come down and check it out. Kelly described it as sort of a ‘social club’ - there would be drinks, some dancing, just general entertainment. She was going to the event that night at 11 and asked me to join her. It’d be a good chance for me to meet some people, so I said I would. 

I Ubered back to my place and watched Netflix for a couple hours. I was about to fall asleep when I got a text, purportedly from Murphy. Murphy is a weird guy. He was really tan, skinny, and had a goatee. I won’t post his real name, but if I did you could look up some really weird, messed up shit he did in the late 90’s. Pretty much everyone at McKay’s knew about his past, but he was everyone’s boss’s boss. 

The text just said ‘2112212211112’. I’ve punched those numbers so many times in the elevator that I can type it without looking. I even have a little song I used to sing to remember it. But this first time, I had no clue what they meant. I texted back a ‘?’ and after about twenty minutes another number (to this day I have no clue who sent the second text) just said ‘Elevator buttons’. So I figured it out from there. 

I had no clue what to wear, so I just put on a fairly nice polo, some nicer jeans, and a jacket over all of it. Again, Kelly described this as a ‘social club’, so I was expecting more of a book club setting - after all, McKay’s did sell books. I got to McKay’s at around 10:40 and stood around in the parking lot. Every now and again, someone would arrive and go in, but I was waiting for Kelly and wasn’t really paying attention. About ten minutes went by and Kelly arrived in her car. Being the awkward jackass I am, I’d scripted in my head the way I’d tell her how nice she looked.

But what I got far exceeded my expectations. Kelly was wearing a spandex corset and a green mini-skirt. Obviously not book club attire. We went inside and got in the elevator. Immediately, she leaned up against me like we’d been together for years. I reached into my phone and told her I guess I’d do the honors.

I put in the code just like the text said. A few seconds went by, and I felt the elevator move downwards. And downwards. And downwards. As we descended, I could start to hear the soft hum of loud music. When the elevator finally opened, it was at full blast and my jaw dropped. 

“Self Control” by Laura Branagan blared from a seemingly infinite number of speakers, deep red and blue lights flashed around the room, and what had to be close to three-hundred people filled the space. Across the basement was a massive dance floor, and a more secluded bar area off to the far right corner. A DJ dressed like the biker from the Village People danced at the edge of a raised platform. There were nude dancers in cages hanging from the ceiling. It really was like something from a movie.

I could have just stared at the whole thing for hours, but before I had time to let it sink in, Kelly took me by the hand and led me across the room. I noticed everyone was dressed as scantily - or more so - as Kelly. Lots of leather, piercings, and tattoos. Lots of skin. I started to feel self-conscious about my own outfit. 

We ended up at the bar at the far end of the space, and it became pretty obvious to me that Kelly knew most people there. I don’t remember everyone, but she introduced me to several people. One of these people was Murphy. I had met Murphy at work, he was basically my boss’s boss, but we’d had minimal contact outside all-hands meetings at work (and those were pretty rare). As I mentioned before, Murphy had a reputation for being a weirdo, but - to his credit - that night he was pretty okay. He bought us drinks, kept the conversation away from work, and before I knew what was happening he had sort of vanished. 

I bet we were there until three in the morning. Kelly and I took turns dancing, drinking, having fun. I think at some point she took some ecstasy because she’d disappear for several minutes and then come back all touchy-feely over everyone. At some point, I sorta lost track of her and danced on my own. I remember giving a dancer forty dollars and talking to a blonde lady named Liza (I’m guessing that’s how it’s spelled by how she pronounced it). As the night went on, the crowd sort of dwindled until there were only a couple dozen people left - most of them McKay’s employees. I found Murphy and asked where Kelly was, but he only told me that she was ‘in the back’ and that he’d make sure she got home okay.

Looking back, I should have been skeptical of all this, but I was drunk and tired and ready to go. So I went up the elevator, got an Uber, and that’s the last thing I remember. I woke up at noon on Sunday, ate something, threw up, and then went back to bed. 

On Monday, I went to work like normal. I saw a lot of people from Saturday night there, but by the way they were acting you’d never know we had been partying together. No one seemed too distracted or disengaged or hungover. Even Kelly seemed distant. Murphy was there, but holed up in an office. And I wouldn’t have wanted to talk to him anyway. 

On my way out, I saw Kelly getting into her car. I stopped by and asked her if she wanted to grab dinner some time, maybe get to know each other a little bit better. I figured after the night after the bar and Saturday, she’d feel similarly, but she told me she wasn’t looking for a relationship. You’d think that would be the end of it, but later that night she sent me a text. 

It was a date a couple months out - around Halloween - and a little note that said “Don’t forget” or something like that. That next day, I got to work super early and waited for Kelly. Not something I’d normally do, but it pissed me off that she’d ignored me at work and then texted me randomly. When she got to work to help open up, I stopped and asked her what was going on. She sort of leaned into me and took me aside, telling me basically that “what happens in the basement stays in the basement” but she wanted to go with me again for the Halloween event. 

Being told someone wants to hang out with you but only in secret and under a very bizarre circumstance is really jarring. I didn’t like it. Leading up to the Halloween show, I started getting more distant at work. I called in a few times. Kelly went out with friends, but I was never invited. One day at work, I was shelving records and listening to some sports podcast (I’m a hockey fan) and Murphy tapped me on the shoulder. Again, I very rarely ever interacted with this guy and his rep for being a piece of shit made any sort of conversation with him unnerving. I don’t remember what he said - something about remembering to do this or that - but I brushed him off and said “Yeah, whatever” or something to that effect, and shoved his hand aside. He gave me this look like he wanted to deck me right there, but he just turned and walked away. Other than that, it was a totally normal day. 

As I left for the day though, Kelly stopped me. She talked to me in her ‘boss’ voice which, even before we started hanging out, had never happened before. She told me I’d been written up by Murphy and that Lucas wanted to talk to me. 

Let me tell you about Lucas. 

Kelly was - I dunno - a shift manager or something? I guess I never really figured out her title. Just a manager. Murphy was a retail manager - he was in charge of day to day logistics at the store. Lucas was the store manager. He was everyone’s boss. The only person above him was the store owner, who I never met or heard about but I’m told since all of this happened that he was in a nursing home. It was a weird setup.

No one ever saw Lucas, though. He was there before anyone arrived. He left well after close. He didn’t go to staff events, he didn’t interact with customers, and he didn’t walk around the store. Lucas stayed in his office and, as far as I could tell, only talked to Murphy via work phone. So, needless to say, having to go up there and talk to him and explain why I was a dick to Murphy was terrifying. 

Lucas’s office was on the second floor. As I took the elevator up, I considered whether or not he even knew about the basement shenanigans. By the time the elevator opened up, I didn’t have a whole lot of time to think about what to say. One obvious solution was just to go back down and quit. Say fuck it. Get a new job. People do that all the time. But as I opened the double doors into the ‘corporate offices’ of McKay’s, something convinced me to stay.

I’d been upstairs lots of times. It’s where I did most of my work at the store. But I’d never gone through the doors into the office. Kelly was always on ‘the floor’ and she was my direct supervisor. When you walk in there, the first thing you see are these old, sun-faded movie posters. One was for ‘Exit to Eden’ (a bad comedy from the 90’s) another was for Queen of the Damned. There were a few more, but I forget which ones.

Anyway, there was also a receptionist desk, but no secretary. Instead there was a mannequin sitting at the desk wearing a creepy-ass mask. On either side of the desk was a door - one was closed, one was cracked open - I could hear typing coming out of that one, so I headed in.

Lucas was sitting there, typing away at a computer that looked to be nearly thirty years old. It was one of those big, gray looking machines with an ancient CRT monitor to match. Lucas himself had platinum-blonde Draco Malfoy hair and these weird glasses that were sort of a half-moon shape and had this off-purple tint to them. He was pretty scrawny.

He didn’t look up at me, so I sort of coughed and he motioned me to sit across from him. He spoke in this deep register, like a boss in a video game, and had this weird, slowed-down drawl to his voice. He asked me if I had been in the basement for the past ‘event’ and I answered in the affirmative. We talked slowly, back and forth, mostly about work stuff. He complained about the computer system needing replaced, how Covid was still having an effect on cash flow. Boring stuff that I really didn’t care about, but I had to listen and pretend to be interested so I did. I sort of told myself that he probably just called me up here to scare me. 

But just as things started to wind down, he casually mentioned the “chambermaid”. I don’t even remember what he said, but I asked him what he meant and he told me he was talking about Kelly. I get Lucas maybe not liking the idea of me having a sexual relationship with my boss, but why call her a “chambermaid”? How would he even figure any of this out? Like I said, Lucas didn’t hang out with the staff and as far as I know, he wasn’t in the basement the night of the party. 

He didn’t explain though. Just as I thought things were winding down, Lucas just got up, walked behind me, and locked the door. That alone made me uncomfortable and seemed like a bad HR move. I got out of my chair, just as a nervous reaction, and this guy socked me in the nose. He hit me hard. I’m not some big guy, but I wasn’t expecting to fall ass-backwards on his desk. Lucas screamed at me, cursed me out, called me names that would probably get me kicked off of Reddit if I typed them here. He told me that if I was going to “be a part of this” that I needed to know my place. That “chambermaids were not my concern” and that if I “fucked with his business” or showed Murphy anything but the utmost respect, he’d ruin my life. Those were his words. Ruin my life. 

So…yeah. A lot to take in. I sat there, on the floor, dumbfounded, and he stormed out of the room into the other office - slamming the door behind him. I probably sat there for five minutes trying to get my head back on my shoulders before I realized my nose was bleeding. When it became obvious Lucas wasn’t going to come out, I got out of there.

The store was closed at that point, but that didn’t matter much. I had no clue what to do - call the cops? I had no evidence of anything I’d tell them. Quit? Obviously now, I recognize that would have been the best option, but I’m an idiot. I felt engrossed by the mystery. Honestly, Lucas threatening to ruin my life didn’t mean a whole lot to me. I didn’t have much of a life to ruin at that point. I wanted answers, so I decided to talk to Kelly. 

I still had her address from when I ubered to my house from her place, and it was early enough in the evening that I figured she’d be awake. My face still hurt from where I’d been punched, and that sort of motivated me to go through with it. On my way there, I kept fighting with that part of me that was telling me not to show up at my boss’s house to confront her about her boss’s boss threatening me.

But I did it anyway. 

Kelly had a nicer place outside of town. I think she had lived with several roommates when I first met her, but somehow she’d since bought the home entirely. I pulled into her driveway and sat there for a moment. Right as I started to get out of my car, I saw Kelly step out onto her front porch, with a sort of “What the fuck?” look on her face. 

I told her everything. Including how upset I was that I’d felt ignored ever since we’d been together at the basement gathering. And including what happened with Lucas. I asked her what the hell a chambermaid was.

She seemed to feel halfway guilty about the whole thing, so she invited me inside and fixed me an interesting milk-based drink. I bet we sat in her living room for four hours or more, and ninety percent of that time was her just…talking. Telling me things I could tell she’d wanted to say for years. It was a lot. And given the crazy day I had just had, it made me feel good to have that context. 

At one point, Kelly was married. She didn’t go into detail, and frankly I wouldn’t post those details here because it’s totally unrelated to what happened, but after that marriage ended I guess she decided to explore herself sexually. She joined a sort of off-beat dating site looking for a sexual partner and at some point became a ‘third’ to Lucas and another lady. Kelly told me she had become bored of ‘vanilla sex’ and Lucas and his partner gave her an outlet to explore her own fantasies. I’m a pretty open minded guy, and these were consenting adults. No biggie…but it gets weirder. 

Months after meeting Lucas (keep in mind my only interaction with this asshole is him hitting me and threatening me), he invited Kelly to a sex party at his apartment. It was her, Lucas, and a handful of others - including, turns out, Murphy. One thing led to another, and Kelly got herself a job at McKay’s. It was a unique experience for her, because she was working with (and for) her lover, but she picked up pretty quickly that most employees there were involved with Lucas sexually. It was around this time that she noticed some employees referring to others as ‘chambermaids’ and ‘chambermen’. 

And a year or so into her job at McKay’s she was introduced to the parties downstairs and, according to her, they changed her life. She didn’t go into much more detail, but she told me that she really liked being with me…that she had grown apart from the others and appreciated a fresh face who actually wanted to spend time with her. All sorts of stuff. She sort of struck me as the kind of woman who would probably never really be happy. But, to be honest, she was the only person I really had, so as I left her house I agreed to go to the Halloween party in the basement with her. 

A few days go by, and it’s the day of the Halloween party. Actually, it would have been October 30th, because Halloween proper was on a Sunday that year, but I digress. I picked up Kelly and this time we went together. She was dressed up as a sort of 50’s pin-up girl, so I just went in a leather jacket thinking I’d come across as a 50’s greaser. I thought it was kind of cute at the time. Anyways, I put in the numbers in the elevator, and down we went. This time, when I went in, it was “Sin” by Nine Inch Nails was playing and, let me tell you, it was loud. I have no clue how people driving by the McKay’s building didn’t hear that shit.

Everyone was having a blast. People were dressed up, dancing, the people in the cages were back. Kelly immediately started grinding on me. Someone, out of nowhere, handed me this weird drink. I was about halfway done with the drink when a device hoisted onto the ceiling started spraying fake blood on everyone like a lawn sprinkler. I just remember looking at Kelly and she was laughing and having such a good time. I remember thinking that despite the weird circumstances that brought me here, maybe this wasn’t so bad.

Fast forward an hour or so and, once again, Kelly goes missing. I’m enjoying myself at this point, so I stumble over to the bar to look for her and grab another martini. Sitting at the bar, the music slowed down and this song called ‘Trick or Treat Dancefloor’ played and people started slow dancing. It was like a twisted prom scene in an old 80’s John Hughes movie, and I realized that I was alone for the entire song. That really bummed me out. 

I got up to take a leak and I noticed Murphy hanging out by a door near the bar. He sort of motioned me to come over to him, so I went over. We’d been cool ever since the incident that led to Lucas slapping me around. I shook his hand and realized that, unlike me, he was totally sober. I asked him where I could find Kelly, and he pointed to the doorway. She had apparently wandered off, so I went in and went down a long hallway. I got about halfway when I realized Murphy was following behind me. That alone made me nervous and it kinda hit me that I was probably being set up.

I had no family here. No real friends outside of work. If he wanted to, Lucas could have Murphy whack me and that’d be that. I’d be a statistic and my parents would spend the rest of their lives worrying about me and assuming I killed myself or ran away.

But none of that happened, obviously. I was just freaking out and what-if’ing and the walk down this hallway seemed to take forever. But I made it to the end and entered another room. Sure enough, there was Lucas. And Kelly. But it was the situation they were in that was so strange.

Lucas, for what it’s worth, was totally naked except for some weird black harness he wore on his chest. Who knows with that guy. Kelly, though, was in a tube. Like…if you’ve ever been on the Extraterrorestrial ride at Disney? With the Alien in the tube? It was a lot like that. A giant tube in the corner of this little office and Kelly was inside of it. She was on her knees, sobbing, and sort of pawing at the glass. The visual was unnerving, and to be honest I’ve had nightmares about it for years. I probably will for the rest of my life. 

By this point, I realized I probably wasn’t going to get whacked and I decided that I was big enough to take on Murphy and Lucas (keep in mind I had been drinking plenty of liquid courage). So I got assertive and demanded to know what was going on. Lucas kind of laughed and Murphy entered the room, shutting the door behind him. He basically told me that she was a chambermaid and she was in the chamber. I had no clue what that even meant, so I told them to let her go, but they told me she wanted to be in there. This was my take a breath and walk away moment, to be honest, so I told Murphy to get out of my way so I could leave. I’d have rather worked at Burger King than deal with this cryptic shit.

But I guess they didn’t like that idea, because as I started to push Murphy aside, he yelled out, “Don’t touch me, motherfucker!” and hit me really hard. I didn’t go down though and went to swing at him when Lucas grabbed my head with both his hands and Murphy started wailing at me. He kicked me - hard - in the small of my back and sent me to my knees. 

I don’t remember Lucas’s exact wording…he basically told me I had one chance to see how the sausage was made, so I better figure it out the first time. I hadn’t noticed the giant valve wheel on the wall when I first went in, but it was there. Murphy held me by the shoulders, digging his skinny hands into me while Lucas went to turn the wheel. It was loud, the squeak of the turning and the hiss of compressed air filling the room, but it was nothing compared to Kelly screaming. She seemed to toss herself into the walls of the tube, clawing at herself, yelling at the top of her lungs, and at the same it looked like she was in ecstasy. This probably went on for ten minutes. I’ll be honest, towards the end it went from being horrifying to almost fascinating. Almost like I was hypnotized by whatever was happening to Kelly. But then, Lucas turned the wheel again and Kelly seemed to go back to normal.

She looked at me. I looked at her. Murphy let go of me and Lucas opened up a door panel on the tube, letting Kelly out. She staggered to me, grabbed hold of me, and we walked out together. As we did, Liza the party before was walking towards the chamber room. I heard her say something to the two men inside as we re-entered the party while everyone was dancing to the Pet Shop Boys. It was as if nothing had happened. Kelly wanted to dance, I wanted to drink, and on the way home I don’t think we said a word to one another. 

The next day, on Halloween, I woke up from a nightmare about Kelly flailing around in that tube at like two in the morning. I tossed and turned in bed until maybe seven and I called my mom, just to hear a familiar voice. She had just had surgery and was glad I called, but every time I tried to be honest with her I found myself changing the subject. So after that phone call, I went back to bed. When I woke up again, I said fuck it and called Kelly. 

She didn’t answer at first, but a half hour later she called me back. At this point, I expected evasive bullshit from anyone who has anything to do with McKay’s, but to my surprise she actually offered to come to my place and talk. So I put on some coffee and she showed up maybe half an hour later. It was quiet at first, as our conversations usually were, but over the course of a cup of coffee she answered my questions. She didn’t know what the ‘chamber’ was, to her knowledge not even Murphy did, but being in it seemed to trigger some kind of primal pain and pleasure sequence in the brain. In Kelly’s words, it made her feel everything she’d ever wanted to feel - good and bad - and cranked up to eleven. 

That was how you become a chambermaid. You let Lucas put you in the chamber. You give him control over that most vulnerable part of you and, in return, he lets you feel it. It was a messed up concept and, frankly, I expected no less from the likes of Murphy and Lucas. I sat there in silence for a few minutes, taking all of this in. What the hell was this thing? Some sort of intense placebo? Had Kelly been conditioned to react a certain way when she was in the chamber? Had all the others? 

Or was there actually some weird stuff going on under McKay’s? To hell with it, I figured, I wanted a piece of the action and I had a plan to get away with it without that douchebag Lucas. I told Kelly everything, exactly how I’d do it, but I would only do it one way - with her. Despite being tired as all hell and scared out of my wits, I had the best sex of my life with Kelly there on the couch.

It was that next Wednesday that our schedules aligned and we decided to go through with my plan. Around eleven o’clock at night, I picked her up, we drove to McKay’s, and she let us in with her keys. It was strange being in there with no other people, and even weirder when I put in the elevator code and we were in the basement. The whole place was spotless. The bar, the stage, the cages - they’d all been torn down. But it was easy enough to find the door that led to the chamber, and to my surprise, it was unlocked. 

I flicked on the light, opened the chamber door, and Kelly kissed me before hopping in. I left the door ajar, and started turning the wheel. Immediately, I noticed her moaning, tripping over herself, etc. I took out a leather strap I had torn off from an old laptop case I had and wedged it in the door…and then I hopped in. 

I had no clue what was going to happen or how things were going to work, but I swear on a stack of Bibles that the second I stepped in and closed that door I felt a headchange. Immediately, my heart started racing, my blood pumped ten times faster than it ever had, and my skin started to tingle. Kelly, who was more used to this than I was, immediately started kissing me. She tried to talk, but her voice just came out as moans and gargling. It was kind of funny at first, but then whatever I was feeling seemed to turn upside down. 

The best way I can describe it is to imagine someone flaying your skin off your body while shocking your sense of self with an electrical cattle pod. I immediately felt jolts across my body, sending it knocking against the tube. My head started pounding and I realized I was sweating profusely. Then that pounding turned into splitting. The splitting into shredding. My brain was in a meat grinder and my limbs were sort of hanging limply as Kelly clawed at me and…well, that stuff is personal. It was crazy good, but there was a problem. 

In the back of my head, a voice was talking to me. It was telling me that, eventually, I was gonna need to get the fuck out of here with Kelly or god knows what would happen. I could tell that voice was receding further and further and I had no clue how much time had gone by. I was freaking out, Kelly was clearly used to this and so wasn’t keeping track of things so minutely like I was, and so as soon as I could, I grabbed the leather strap and pulled hard. To my surprise, it worked and the door went ajar and I was able to roll out. Kelly didn’t seem to mind. She continued to roll around as I went to the wheel and turned it off. 

And there you had it. All of the fun, but none of the douchebags. It was a good system. And we exploited it constantly. 

Over the course of the next year or so, we visited the chamber dozens, maybe hundreds, of times. We had so much fun. Obviously in the chamber, but half the fun was sneaking in and knowing we hadn’t been caught. I remember one time, actually, we were leaving the chamber room and we actually heard someone coming down the elevator. I legitimately nearly shat my pants, and we managed to hide in an adjoining closet. I assume it was Lucas and one of his girls. Who knows. 

 We both loosened up at work. We continued to go to the parties, where she, in her own way, paid tribute to Lucas in the chamber and I kicked back at the bar. Kelly and I even made plans to move in together. She was more nervous about that than I was. But for the first time since I moved to Nashville, things seemed alright. 

And then, she disappeared. 

I came in on a Monday, no Kelly. 

Tuesday, no Kelly. 

No answers to my texts or calls. No one else seemed to know what had happened. Murphy didn’t know. I drove to her house, and her car was there. She’d given me a key to her place and I used it to let myself in. But Kelly was nowhere to be found. 

I went to work Thursday and was freaking out at this point. I went upstairs just to see what was going on, and to my complete shock, Lucas was on the floor. Interacting with customers, even. I cannot stress enough that this never happened. I let him finish his conversation and walked up to him. He smiled, waved, and asked how I was doing. I told him, bluntly, that Kelly was missing and not responding to me. If he knew where she was, I wanted him to tell me. My next step was calling the police. I’d tell them everything. 

He sort of chuckled at this and leaned into me to whisper something. Kelly was fine, he said, she was just doing stock in the basement. If I came in at eight that night, I could help her. He patted me on the shoulder like a complete dick, and then walked off. I don’t think I talked to anyone else that shift. I was stuck in tunnel vision: Kelly was in the basement and I was going to have to save her. 

That evening, at home, I considered buying a gun. But would that solve anything? Did I really want to risk going to jail or something? So I decided to just text my parents that I loved them, that I was thinking about moving closer to home, and headed back to McKay’s. 

Murphy was there at the elevator when I walked in. We talked for a bit, and he basically told me that they had known for weeks that we’d been using the chamber. He told me that if I tried to run, he would shoot me in the head. I’d never been threatened that way before, so I started to tear up a bit. Murphy led me into the elevator and told me to put in the code. I did, and we went down.

The basement was empty, but there was music playing over the speakers. I googled the lyrics months later and I think it’s ‘Runner’ by a band called Tennis. We went to the chamber room and, sure enough, there was Lucas in his dumb looking harness and Kelly in the chamber. 

She looked bad. Real bad. Like she hadn’t eaten or slept in days. Had they been using the chamber to torture her? As soon as she saw me, she started weakly slapping at the glass. Lucas told me about how, when he met Kelly, she had no one. No family. She had left her husband. She had nowhere to go, she just sort of made his fucked up lifestyle her default. The whole situation made me sick.

I asked him what he wanted. If it was money, I had very little. But that wasn’t what he wanted. He told Murphy to show me his gun and, sure enough, he had some sort of handgun. I’m still pissed that I considered bringing one but chickened out, but what the hell was I going to do? Have a Clint Eastwood shoot out with this piece of shit? 

So at this point, my options were limited. I could do what they said, or get shot. Lucas told me to turn the wheel and activate the chamber. I looked at Kelly and she looked so defeated. Lord knows how many times they’d put her through this. At some point, the chamber probably just drains you. I told Lucas what I thought of him…that I loved Kelly…and that he could go fuck himself. But if I turned around and went for the door, I knew what would happen. So I took the wheel and turned it. I looked over to Kelly and mouthed that I was sorry, but by that point she was on the ground and just sort of…squirming. 

I didn’t like looking, so I just looked down. I was crying and her screams were getting louder and louder and louder. Then, about like I expected, she stopped and I knew what I had done. I barely registered that Lucas and Murphy had left the room and I ran to the chamber, opened the door, and held Kelly for a long time. I hated myself, I still do, but I really, really hate Lucas and Murphy. 

That night, I packed my things, put them in my car, and drove out of Nashville. I had no clue where either of Kelly’s tormentors lived. I swung by a gas station and used the phone to call the police. The dispatcher took me seriously when I told them about Kelly, and asked me to stay on the line but I got scared and hung up the phone. 

I have no clue who works where now, but I’m fairly certain Murphy is in jail for some unrelated charge relating to him violating some sort of restraining order. I only know that because someone reactivated an old work group chat to tell everyone. Lucas, as far as I know, is still in the city and I look forward to the day he gets what’s coming to him. 

I’m back home, far away from Nashville, but like I said - you experience shit like that and it sticks with you. It leaves a pattern on your brain, and it won’t rub off. I hope posting about all this will help, but the fact is that it’s probably not going to get any better. If you’ve got a Kelly, hold them a bit tighter after you read this - the world is a messed up place and sometimes its the messed up people that make it a little brighter.
