Hi! I'm Ash! If you're new here, definitely check out part one ([https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/16clztx/i\_am\_a\_fae\_scorn\_hunter/](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/16clztx/i_am_a_fae_scorn_hunter/) ) to figure out what's going on. This is the rest of my introduction, and I apologize for leaving as I did!  


Ok so quick refresher if you're caught up. I met a fairy named Myff, I'm now butt-ass naked in the Fae realm, Myff is recruiting me as some kind of hunter and then he broke my neck, the little pixie fucker.  


"MYFF!" I yelled his name once more. The dappled clearing that was once a shining example of serenity now brought me a feeling of fear. The soft sunlight no longer felt like it was nurturing my soul. Now, it felt like the sun wanted to blind me. It was hard to breathe through my twisted neck. Each step rocked my world back and forth.   
  
  
At this point, I was utterly terrified. Myff brought me to the Fae realm after he attacked me, and now he broke my neck and flew away because I was sad? What the fuck was I thinking when I trusted that little unicorn fucker?    
  
  
But, all's well that ends well.    
  
  
Myff shot out of the forest at blinding speeds, just barely registering as something perceptible in the corner of my vision. He flew to where I wobbled and stopped in front of my nose. I must've looked like a wreck; head upside down, ugly crying that made me drool, which then ran into my nose and over my eyes, and through my hair.   
  
  
"You look disgusting." Myff commented, obviously disgusted.   
  
  
"No shit you pompous mosquito! You broke my neck!" I yelled and flailed my arms again, but I quickly stopped because it made my head bounce around, and that was no bueno.   
  
  
It was then that I noticed Myff was glowing green and yellow. He was radiating a buzzing energy that tickled the back of my eyeballs and gave my ears an erection. It's hard to explain. Have you ever Q-tipped your ears and hit it juuuuuust right? It was like that, but better somehow.   
  
  
Myff's face of disgust disolved into his stoic, deadpan, resting bitch ass bitch face. "Has it not occured to you yet that something outside of your understanding is happening?" he questioned me flatly.   
  
  
"Of course, it has!" I ugly cry screamed. "You broke my fucking neck! I just didn't want to be the wrong person for the job!"   
  
  
Myff did his shitty little shitty shit shitface chuckle, and then asked me a very obvious question. "Why aren't you dead, Ash?" One of his eyebrow's raised quizzically.    
  
   
I was at a total loss for words. Actually, why wasn't I dead? There's no way I should have been able to survive having my head spun like top while it was still attached to my body.    
  
  
Myff placed one hand on my forehead, calmly caressing my cheek with the other. The energy he was giving off made my eyes sneeze. That's the only way I can describe it, sorry. He embraced me, warmly swaddling my spittle slicked head. I felt my worry melt away instantly. It was intensely calm. Confusing, right?   
  
    
Myff leaned over to my ear, and I heard him inhale a shallow breath before he whispered, "Ash?" His little breath tickled my ears. "You're being a big bitch." He then counter-broke my neck. Unbroke it? He threw my chin like the baseball your dad never threw for you.   
  
  
My new scream of surprise came out like a turkey gobble as my head snapped back into place. I felt like a leggo for some reason. I looked up at Myff just in time to see him wiping my snotty drool out of eyes. He looked a little green around the gills. Not that he has gills. Gills like the figure of speech or whatever that's called. He looked sick. But not like... cool sick... Like ill. But not like totally dude gnarly ill, but like he was going to vomit. Serves him right.   
  
   
Now that my head was right, I just went and sat down. Boring? I know. What else are you supposed to do when a fairy breaks your neck and then unbreaks it? Dance? No. I went and sat down on my toadstool stool, breathing deeply, before I asked “Why didn’t that kill me?”.   
  
   
Myff buzzed over to me, looking at me incredulously, before he went on to explain in incredible detail, and with lots of necessary information, exactly what’s going on. He spoke for a long time, telling tales of ancient fae power, humans being born with latent fae abilities, and fae being born with human abilities (they get depression and develop a fear of doorbells, tragic).   
  
  
As it would happen to be, I am someone with latent Fae powers. I’ve had them my whole life, and they were always active. I’ve just never “basically died” before to know it. I guess I should explain the power before I get too far ahead of myself. According to Myff, my power makes me a Stitcher, or a medic of sorts. We’re called stitchers because our abilities allow us to take on a lot of big boo boos and we’ll stitch ourselves and our wounds back together from the brink of death. We can still die though. Like, cut off our heads, take too much blood, drown us , smash us, boil us, mash us, stick us in a stew  etc etc we die.  
  
   
The reason my neck didn’t unbreak automatically was because I didn’t set it straight for my powers to work right. That why Myff broke and unbroke me, to demonstrate. Also a neck break would still typically be fatal, even to a stitcher. But our powers are amplified in the Fae Realm.  
   
I'm just now realizing that Myff is always violent when he wants to show me something... I’m going to keep that in mind.   
   
Beyond Stitchers, there are Riddlists, Savagers, and Etherealists. I’ll go into more details about these in the future. I know this update was short, and I apologize. I just felt awful about leaving you guys with a cliffhanger.    
   
I’ll update soon enough with a story that involves my cat and a Brownie, and my first encounter with a Fae Scorn.
