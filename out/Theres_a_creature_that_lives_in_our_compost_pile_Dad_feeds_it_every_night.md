Every night after dinner, my dad takes the day’s food scraps and casts them onto the compost pile out back. It’s a ritual he’s done for as long as I can remember. 

“The compost must be maintained,” he’d say. My siblings and I would watch him from our bedroom windows as he hiked his way through the woods and dumped the discards. 

We never knew why he did this every night or why he was so dedicated. We just figured, *He likes making dirt for his garden.* 

It wasn’t until Thanksgiving last fall that we discovered the truth of why he was out there. 

Our revelation started after I’d flown in from university. My brother, Joey, and sister, Ayla, were ecstatic because we hadn’t spoken in months.

“Long time, no see!” Joey said and slapped my back as we loaded my bags into his car. 

I hugged Ayla and hopped into the passenger seat. As Joey drove…

“Guess I should break the news before we get home,” he said, pulling away from the curb.

“What news?”

“Perky got hit by a car.”

“You serious?” I glanced back to Ayla. “Why didn’t anyone tell me?”

“Mom said it’d be better to tell you in person,” she said, wiping a tear. “Somehow, she snuck outside and… that was it. At least, that’s what Dad told us.”

***

When we got home and started unloading the bags, Mom and Dad came out to meet us.

“Hiya, sport!” Dad said and wrapped me in an embarrassing hug.

“Missed you, son.” Mom kissed my cheek and helped Dad drag my luggage inside. 

Joey, Ayla, and I trailed after them. When we reached the porch, Joey whispered into my ear.

“I hope you’re ready for some spy work tomorrow.” 

“What for?”

“Ayla and I are gonna follow Dad to the compost pile after dinner.” 

“No way…”

“Sis and I heard him talking to someone out there. When we tried getting a closer look, whoever it was heard us and got away. We figured with the three of us, we could try and see what’s in the woods.”

***

The next day, after Thanksgiving dinner, we made our way through the side yard, careful not to be spotted by any family who were still in the house.

“Here we are,” Joey hissed, pausing at the wooded path, which led to the pile.

Ayla winked and disappeared into a thicket of flannel bush. Joey tapped my shoulder and ducked behind a large tuft of grass.

I waited alongside the trail, thinking, *Are we really doing this? What if Dad spots us? Even if he isn’t pissed, will he tell us his long-held secret?*

I was about to find out.

***

The footsteps started moments after I had found my hiding place. I peeked around to see Dad enter the clearing.

“Sorry to keep you waiting, Sonny.”

*Sonny?* I watched as he dumped a bucketful of eggshells, onion clippings, and banana peels onto the mound.

“Please come out. I’m sorry it took so long.”

*Who’s Sonny?!*

I gasped as something moved inside the pile. A hand emerged from the earth, then a head and two shoulders. Soon a humanoid shape, about six feet tall, rose out, its body decorated in rotten fruits and vegetables. It smelled of mulch and old leaves.

“There you are,” Dad said, then settled onto a tree stump. “It’s good to see you.”

The thing just looked at him. 

“I can’t talk long, Thanksgiving and all. But I wanted to connect. My son, Bryant, just flew in.”

The beast bellowed, “Bryant.”

“That’s right,” my dad said. “He’s studying to be a structural engineer. Isn’t that wonderful?”

“Wonderful,” the monster bleated.

“Now, remember, for the next few days, we need to follow the rules. You have to stay in this pile, and eat *only* what I give you. Understand? We can’t have any more accidents.”

“Accidents.”

“I’d love to chat, but I’ve got to spend time with family.” Dad rose and turned toward the house. “I know you love eggplants. I’ll bring some tomorrow. See you then.”

“Tomorrow,” the creature groaned, then descended into the pile.

***

The next morning, Mom and Dad had a huge breakfast on the table. Eggs and bacon and pancakes, all the works.

My siblings and I exchanged nervous glances. We had met earlier and decided it was time to confront Dad. Since I was the oldest, I’d take the leap. 

“Dad, I need to tell you something.” 

“Sure, sport, what’s up?”

“Joey, Ayla, and I followed you into the woods last night.”

“You did what?!”

“We saw the creature… the one you called Sonny.”

“You didn’t speak to him, did you?”

“No, we —”

He SLAMMED his fist onto the table. “You must never speak to Sonny without me! It can be dangerous.”

“Henry, please!” Mom scooted out of her seat, grabbed Dad’s arm. 

Dad tilted his face away from us. “I’m sorry…. it’s just… I haven’t shown him to anyone except your mother.”

“What exactly… is he?” I asked.

“A gift.” He took a deep breath. “I suppose it’s time I showed you.”

***

It was almost 10 am when we reached the pile.

“Sonny, we have visitors.” Dad tossed a handful of onion circles onto the mound. “You can come out.”

Sonny’s hand erupted from the mulch. Next, his head and shoulders. Soon, the figure emerged, like a newborn from its mother. The smell was even more horrid up close.

“Sonny, these are my children. You’ve met my wife.”

The creature nodded.

“They want to know who you are, Sonny. Will you show them?”

The abomination gazed at us with empty eye sockets. Rotted pumpkin pulp dripped from its fingers.

“Tell us who you are.”

The behemoth plunged its hands deep into its chest and pulled out a shriveled object, as black as an olive.

Ayla squealed as the monster placed the item in Dad’s palm.

“What is that?” I gasped. 

“Come closer,” Dad said. “I want you all to see it.”
 
My siblings and I circled around. The item resembled a tiny organ, fleshy almost, but it had a hard, shell-like quality. It almost seemed like…

“A seed. I found it in the woods years ago. I didn’t know what it was, so I tossed it into the compost. Months later, a tiny creature had sprouted. Now, it’s the specimen you see before you.”

I shifted my gaze to the rotting behemoth. The thing was breathing heavier now, studying the trees. A grey squirrel scurried by on a branch, chittering nervously.   

“Your father and I didn’t want you to know about it,” Mom confessed. “We were afraid you’d think it was…”

“… Dangerous?” I asked.

Dad deposited the seed in his pocket. “We’ve had a few incidents with animals.”

“What animals?”

“First, there was the squirrel and the owl. Then… the neighbor’s cat. But worst of all…” Dad’s voice shook. “We had the accident on Monday…”

I panned to Mom’s horrified expression, then Dad’s. Their faces told me everything.

“Wait… you’re saying that Perky… was eaten by this thing?!”

“I wanted to tell you.” Dad ran nervous fingers through his hair. “But I didn’t know how you’d take it.”

“You lied to us?” Ayla gawked, mortified. “About our cat?!”

“Sonny only eats fruit and vegetables. But lately his cravings have changed. I always tell your mother to keep Perky inside —“

“Don’t blame this on me, Henry!” Mom shot back.

“You’re right… I apologize…” Dad slumped his shoulders. “I was stressed and prepping our house for the holiday. I forgot to close the back door.” 

It was then I noticed a tuft of tabby fur next to Sonny’s foot. The behemoth noted my gaze, followed it down, and picked up the object.

I gazed in horror as I recognized the bloody remnants of Perky.

“Oh, Jesus, Dad.” I stepped back, retching.

Sonny held the carcass over its nonexistent mouth. The grass and dirt where its jaws should’ve been opened up and swallowed the remains, then closed over it like it was never there.

“What the fuck, Dad?!” Joey gasped. “You can’t let this thing live out here!”

“Sonny’s my friend. I’ve been tending him for years. He’s still learning what it means to be human.”

“It’s not a human! It’s a monster!” Ayla spun on her heel and dashed back toward the house. 

“Ayla?! Where are you going?!” Dad called after her and groaned. “Oh god, what have I done?”

***

We were still lingering near the pile when Ayla returned, carrying a fuel canister. 

“Ayla! What are you doing?!” Dad screamed. 

“Getting rid of this thing!” She darted past him and started dumping fuel all over the mound. 

“No! Wait! The compost is flammable!” Dad wrapped his arms around her as she continued to fling fuel.

“Get off me!”

“Please, Joey! Bryant! Don’t let your sister hurt him.”

I stood back with my mom and brother, too shocked to even respond. Ayla’s actions were insane, but so were my dad’s.

Joey and I locked eyes for a moment. He stepped forward and pulled a matchbox from his pocket. “Sorry, Dad, Sis is right. This thing can’t exist…” He struck a match and tossed it into the pile. 

FWOOSH.

“No!!” Dad let go of Ayla and hopped into the compost, trying to stamp out the flames. “Run! Sonny! Run!”

But the creature didn’t move. It just stood there, observing the unknown substance, like a child unaware of its own destruction.

***

Mom took Dad to the ER afterward to treat his leg burns. Joey drove to his girlfriend’s place, trying to forget what had happened. 

Ayla stayed home and locked herself in her room, refusing to talk to anyone.

I wandered outside to the compost pile. The entire mound had been burned to ash. There wasn’t a trace of Sonny left.

I said a silent prayer for Perky, started back for the house. Felt something hard beneath my shoe. 

I looked down. It was Sonny’s seed, pulsing with yellow light. It must’ve fallen from Dad’s pocket during the skirmish.

I retrieved it, held it between my thumb and forefinger.

I wondered… what to do with it.
