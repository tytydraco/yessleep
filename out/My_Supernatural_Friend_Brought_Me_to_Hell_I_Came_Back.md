Awaiting my doom or destiny in the attic, through this post on my phone I present to you what may be my last thoughts, the final entry of a guy who has seen the unseen parts of Earth. The rain smacks down on the house like knocks on the door begging me to come out. And I will have to, to face her, to kill Omertà before I die. Peeking out the window is a nauseating horror show. Mr. Alan and his daughter Benni's dead body float outside in the gigantic flood waters there. On occasion, Benni and her Dad flop on top of each other creating a stomach-churning sadness, as choppy as the waters outside the door.

Omertà and Benni were best friends, and yet she did this to her. Like I said before, all this hate was once love. And yet what I didn't realize was the hate was always there; it was just aimed in a different direction.

The slurping, sloshing sound of a flooded basement taunts me. If Omertà chose to, she could appear through there and, like some sea serpent, drag me through the flood water, transport me to the ocean and places deeper than the Mariana Trench.

She wants worse than that for me based on our last phone call.

"Death on the surface is too good for you, traitor," she said. "Where the light of the sun could give you a little joy? Aww, did you want the privilege of getting your screams heard? Did you want to close your eyes on the setting sun and accept death?"

How did I not see all this hate sooner? The hate didn’t even really show up when we called her out for it after I got back from the Farm. It took me a while to bring up the Farm, it was too painful. Yet, I must tell you about how we brought up the Farm to Omertà because that is the second most important part of this story. Of course, the end is the most important as it always is.

The night I called her out, it was all of us best friends—Benni, me, Jay-Jay, and Omertà—attempting to relax and acting like everything was normal after my trip to the other world. Ironically, we were in the basement of the house I might die in now.

Omertà and Little John lounged in beanbag chairs tossing a ball back and forth. Benni paced in the room filling me in on what I missed while I was gone. Benni’s words never reached me as I swiveled in a desk chair, my thoughts battling with the most important question in my life. Cutting off Benni I said,

"Omertà, where was I?"

"Oh," she said, getting up and taking my hand in hers. "That was the Farm. It's actually on Earth but not the worst place here. Ever been to Jersey?" She laughed, and Benni chuckled. Little John grunted, and I remained silent.

"Tough crowd," Omertà said. "But yeah, it's the last slave state. Lincoln actually did get rid of slavery in our world too."

"How do we free them?" I asked.

"Look at this guy," Omertà joked and pointed a thumb at me. "He's Harriet Tubman now. You know we had our own mermaid Harriet Tubman. Guess what her name was?"

"What?" Benni asked.

"Mermaid Harriet Tubman." Omertà laughed at herself, and she was the only one.

"Did you send people there to be slaves, Omertà?" I pressed.

"Better than sending them to Ohio," she laughed and raised her hands to retrieve high-fives. "Am I right, Gen Z? Skibiddi-toilet and all that."

No one moved.

"Fine," Omertà admitted. "Yes, I sent people there to be slaves. They all deserved it."

"I'm not sure if anyone ever deserves to be a slave," Benni added.

"They were bad people," Omertà said.

"Mermaids kiss," I said and then stuttered because my mind was racing as I put two and two together. "When—when—whenever we said a bully or teacher was giving us a hard time you said you gave them a mermaid kiss. Is that—did you send them to the Farm?"

"Yes," she said.

"Omertà!" Little John barked.

"They were bad people. So, you replace them, put them in slave bodies, and put their old bodies on auto-pilot. Stop looking at me like that. They were bad people!"

"Some of them were 12," I said. "Some of them just had a bad day."

"Omertà, you've been with me since I was 5," Benni stuttered out and then she gasped. "Kayla McCarthy! Omertà no, my kindergarten bully! Omertà, you didn't!"

"Oh, c'mon. Kayla McCarthy: terrible name. She would have grown up to be a—"

"She was five," Benni said. Malice laced Benni's voice for the first time since I'd met her.

“Well, she’s not five now if it helps.”

“Omertà,” Benni said icy voice shooting daggers. “That’s evil.”

“That’s farming, cull the bad so the good can grow,” Omertà countered cooler than any rage Benni could muster. The torturing of a child, the loss of parents before you could read a chapter book, the fear a five-year-old must have being dumped in a wasteland, the evil damning nature of judging someone by their mistakes a year after their potty trained all meant nothing to her.

“What do mermaids know about farming? You live underwater.” I asked, desperate to make some point, something she couldn’t refute.

“Not always,” she shrugged, and that fear she put crept on me again. “We weren’t always under the sea.”

"You changed my Dad?" Little John said, his tone wavering in its neutrality.

"Yes," she said and pointed to him. "Yes, yes, yes, he hurt you and I fixed him. What's the problem?"

"He's not really my Dad anymore?"

"No, not really, and isn't that a good thing?" Omertà beamed a smile as white as a pearl at Little John, and he nodded slowly.

"People can change," I said. "I've changed! I was only in there for a week but I promise you it changes you."

Omertà waved me off.

"What, you think people can't change? I was an animal there, Omertà. I drank piss. Was that what I always was?"

Omertà didn't answer. She blinked at me.

"I'm not!" I screamed to her and myself. "If I can't change then you might as well have left me there because that's where I belong."

"Hey, no. You belong with me because you're good. You're all good people. You'll always be good people, like me."

"You have to give them a chance, Omertà," Benni said. "People can change."

"No," I cut in. "You have to give them a chance because that's what humanity is. A bunch of people changing. Telling somebody exactly what they are and putting them into this box... that's Hitler shit, that's Stalin shit, that's how you start a genocide and I won't be a part of it."

"Oh, that's great," Omertà said and hugged me. "Because you were never a part of it. All you have to do is be my friend and I'll do it."

I pushed her away and I found myself screaming in her face.

"No," I said. "I'm not standing by and letting you damn a bunch of people."

"Hey, I'm your friend. I didn't mean to get you sent there. I promise you I tried so hard to get you out! I promise!"

"It's not about that."

"I can show you magic. I can make you forget about the time at the farm. I got revenge by the way—the guy who sent you there is dead! I would never let what he did to you slide. I promise you I'm your friend."

"I'm not yours, Omertà."

"Jay-Jay, I have asked nothing of you but friendship! I'm not using you. I was never using you. You're like my brother!"

"I know, Omertà."

"Jay-Jay! Jay-Jay! Please!"

Once we found out what Omertà really was and what she was doing, and after two weeks of trying to convince her to stop, we left her. But that wouldn't be enough. That wouldn't be justice. We had to stop her. She was a slaver, a monster, who wouldn't listen to reason. Omertà had to be put down.

I had what could kill her, a trident of pure silver. Silver is a mermaid's deepest desire and the only thing that could kill them. I won it gambling with her. Ironically, she let me keep it because she knew I could never hurt her. She was half-right.

I couldn't kill her. I couldn't go that far. Little John volunteered though; I knew he could. He always believed he was destined for something special, and was this not special?

We met on top of the parking garage to his apartment building in the middle of the night. It hung over the city so you could see the skyline.

Little John was already there, out of his car; he stared out at the parking garage looking over the city.

I parked beside him and grabbed the suitcase holding the trident out of my car. Awkward about the method but positive it had to be done, I wobbled with it toward Little John.

"What's up?" He said, still not bothering to look at me, which did seem to be a bit unnerving.

"Hey," I said back. "I've got it if you want to take it." He ignored me. I took my place beside him, and this made him smile.

"You ever seen Scarface?" He asked.

"No, not my type of movie."

"I loved it. Look at that city. The world is yours. The world is yours." He began to sing the chorus of the Nas song with the same name.

He was a terrible singer. Yet, the city was beautiful; the flashing lights of the building looked like stars.

"So is Scarface good?" I asked. "Should I watch it or something?"

"Yeah, it's good but don't watch it. You should live it."

"How am I going to live it if I don't watch it?"

"Want a drink?" He asked me and brought out a beer. I hated beer, too bitter, especially after drinking all the mystical stuff. But I saw how he pleaded with me in his eyes so I accepted.

"Scarface is about this immigrant kid, right? An immigrant like me, except he's here legally. Don't tell the feds." He said, putting his finger on his lip to signify it was a secret, and then he would bob and weave his head like he was trying to avoid the gaze of the cops. He always did this whenever he talked about his immigration status; it always made me laugh. "And so Scarface makes an empire for himself then he dies. And people always vilify him because he was a criminal and it was wrong to do what he did but I get it. That's what happens when people make you feel small, y'know? People will go through all sorts of lengths if they feel small. Like they're going to do the thing that makes them feel big. You get what I'm saying?"

“Do you feel sma- -” I cut myself off. *How could someone who was given the name Little John not feel small?* Poor guy, but I didn’t understand what he was getting at, yet.

I didn't finish my beer. The tension in the atmosphere wiggled and tightened like a string.

"No, explain it to me," I said.

"Ah, don't worry about it. I'm glad we got to have a drink together, man."

"Too many more!" I said and raised my beer. He burped and before he could toast he spilled his drink.

"Oops," he said, and we laughed, and the spill of the drink took the tension. We looked at our city and laughed about our adventures and talked about all the women and fairies we thought were the hottest and how if we ever made it back to that mystical world whom we would ask out. It was all so funny, so us, until he paused.

"Hey, Jay-Jay, what if we are better?"

"What?"

"What if we are better than who Omertà sent down to the Farm? In fact, I know I was better than my Dad; he sucked. He came up with the name Little John, y'know, because I was so fat as a kid. He came up with a lot of names for all my siblings," And with a deeper voice, much quieter: "He hit like a demon."

"I mean that doesn't mean he deserves to go to Hell."

"Says who?"

"John?"

"No, I think it was a good thing he's there. He can rot."

"John?"

"Yeah, Jay-Jay. I'm starting to think we are better because no matter what I went through, I wouldn't have done what he did to me."

"She sent more than your Dad down there. She sent a five-year-old. John, you're not thinking straight."

"Why, because I believe in myself? I believe I'm good enough for something?"

"No, man. It sounds like because you believe no one else can be."

"Well, maybe they can't. Do you know how far I've come? I came to this country with nothing and now I'm my own man."

"Yeah, yeah, man. You've done a lot."

"And I deserve to be treated like it. I deserve what I have and I won't give it up."

"Alright, how about no more drinks, huh?"

"You're right, just water," he said and brought the fresh cold bottle of water from his cooler.

When he said water, time slowed down for me. Water, the one element Omertà could transport from. I understand everything perfectly: Little John wasn't going to use that trident to kill Omertà.

Our conversation that night made sense. What he said before...

"People will go through all sorts of lengths if they feel small. Like they're going to do the thing that makes them feel big."

"I deserve what I have and I won't give it up."

And without Omertà if we had to live in the real world. We were so small. He chose life with Omertà over justice, mercy, and me.

I ran before he could release her from the water bottle. Before she could break my neck as she did to Benni’s Dad. I hopped in my car and drove off. Grateful to be alive but mourning my mistake, I left the trident.

Reader, there is another twist to the tale that answers the most pressing question I asked in my first post: Can humans change? I asked you this at the beginning of my tale and thanks to a recent development I have an answer for you. About two hours ago, before the house was completely flooded, the hum of an engine outside brought me back to the present day. A silver Cybertruck pulled into the driveway. I knew exactly who it was. Little John—what could he want with me?

My husky friend hopped out of his car, with the case containing the Trident. Impossible, I leaped the stairs in my rush down them. In a couple of hopeful bounds, the door was before me. With a twist of the knob and a wide swing, I welcomed my prodigal brother. He had betrayed me but he had come home.

Omertà saw him come home as well. And that she would not stand for. By her will, the rain turned to hail. Hail shattering into the ground the size of coins, then golf balls, then coal like she was Santa Claus and she had gifts for her naughty children. The hail created a cracking demented sound that crushed the world outside of the house.

Many lives were on the line but I begged Little John to place the trident over his head for protection. Who cares if it got damaged—Little John was my friend, my brother, I wanted him to live. Hard-headed—but not as hard as hail—he ignored me.

Hail dented Little John's head as he stepped—slow and agonizingly—forward. Red chasms peppered his head. The hail rolled in the holes in his skull like golf balls trying to fall into their homes in the green. The assault was as vomit-inducing and unnatural as a Dalmatian's spot being cut from it in inaccurate circles. Little John hugged the Trident as that precious mind, the one he thought would allow him to change the world, the one Omertà valued so much cracked.

Plop.

Plop.

Plop.

By the time he made it to the door, he was a trypophobic nightmare, unrecognizable to even his mother, too many balls of hail dropped his face.

And Little John was a hero. I brought his body and the case in. Careful to stay under the roof.

Now, Reader, I bring you to right now perhaps my final moments. The cyber truck has washed away, the house I’m in will fall to the flood soon.

Trident in hand, now I journey to the top of the roof. By Omertà's will the hail stopped. The wicked woman wants me to go into the water. She floats in front of me, half of her head above the surface, so it appears her eyes rest on the water like an alligator's. I will leap through the attic window and dive in to battle her.

I did not know my purpose or what I wanted like Benni and Little John, but I knew what I hated.

I hated the bullies in school who treated me like I would always be worthless and the teachers who didn't do anything because they believed I could never be anything.

I hated Omertà who damned everyone who did wrong in her eyes because she believed man could not change. And that taught me I loved humanity.

To be human is to err and change.

Therefore, it is good to fight against anything that denies us of that. Today, I fight for Little John, the abused child to a self-righteous hero to a selfless champion. Today, I fight for Benni, the shy outcast-turned-evangelist-turned-chainsaw-wielding savior.

And I fight against Omertà, whose greatest sin is that she believed she was without sin and demanded to throw stones at flowers that didn't get even a chance to bloom. I will not write back whether I win or not because it doesn't matter. All that matters is that the sensitive kid who could never stand up for himself, who was made into something lower than even an animal, got back up and changed again to stand for something.

I will fight a monster because that is the most sacred part of humanity—the ability to [change.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Finchink/)
