Now that I read the title, I already know what kind of knucklehead you’ll think I am, but bear with me. This happened last year, I graduated from college, and after majoring in videography, I was ready to travel the world. Our last assignment was to make a documentary on a country of our choice, and I had saved enough for my travels to go to Southeast Asia and do both. Live out my dream of partying on sandy beaches while also creating a documentary about a country that had always intrigued me, Brunei. 



Don’t get me wrong, I spent my first month partying and almost catching Syphilis on my way through Thailand and Malaysia. But then it was time to hit Brunei. Having lived in America, you often forget how your eyes are left to expect colors in very specific places and expect the dull when you go about living your lives. You expect color in screens, billboards, strategic places like malls and exclusive events like concerts and parties, but never in everyday life. Everyday life was boring, mute, dull, and the only hint of color would be pastel. 



Be it the posh suburban neighborhood that I was lucky enough to be born in or my college of Arts, which ironically was plastered in brown, black, and mostly off white. Pick up my mom or dad from work, and all the corporate life would remind me that it was a big advertisement for the color grey. Hell, I used to expect more color among the cars that would weave through traffic than the rest of my life. But this simple trip to the other side of the world made my eyes crave color more than ever, it was as if I unlocked a piece of my childhood, as though the kid in me that would buy multicolored pencils, purchase weird erasers and carry at least three different crayons in his pocket at all times had suddenly woken up. 



I now craved color everywhere I went after my first month. And it wasn’t just the major cities like Bangkok, Krabi, Ipoh or Kuala Lumpur. All the villages I decided to walk into on a whim seemed to soothe that child inside me. But this changed when I reached Brunei. That country reminded me of where I came from, it was just that it had a different color palette. Long story short, what was once a dream had become an assignment. Though I was applauded for the unique, politically correct perspective I submitted in my documentary, I’ll confess that I left the country with mixed feelings. It wasn’t bad, I mean, who doesn’t want no taxes, free health care and education? But unfortunately, they come at a price. 



And so this is when I decided that my next trip to Asia would end on a positive note, little did I know, it might’ve been the end of my life had I not had luck and some dear friends on my side. But I am getting ahead of myself. After graduation, my friend Carl (not his real name btw), I and a few of his rich friends decided to open up our own little production house. Nothing fancy, just enough to get a few investors to get Carl excited about what we could do in the future. Carl and I have been friends since we first met each other in the second year, and we’ve been inseparable ever since. 



My parents do well, and I’ve worked enough part-time gigs to get some decent savings, but when I say Carl is a whole nother level of rich? Trust me, he is, he doesn’t drive a fancy car, nor does he wear fancy clothes, but his family has houses all over the world. At least a dozen in our country, and then a few in Europe and Dubai. What does his father do? He runs an investment firm, but I am pretty sure a lot more happens behind the scenes if you ask me. Either way, I am not asking that pot-bellied abuser who looks like the Grinch aboard the Axiom in Wall-E questions about his business. 



Carl isn’t too fond of him either; he simply abuses his family and throws money at therapy to solve problems, and those therapy bills aren’t going down any time soon because the man refuses to change his behavior. And so once this was done, we decided to visit India, and though we expected it to be an overstimulating experience for our eyes and stomachs, things turned out to be rather pleasant. That first week, though, was rough; the number of times I prayed on that toilet will beat the amount most people pray during their entire lives. And the sounds coming from my bathroom were nothing short of a fecal exorcism, but I digress. 



We started from North India in the Himalayas, then visited the East and finally made our way south. We missed the West Coast, yeah, but neither Carl nor I were too keen on the hot and humid climate most of the West Coast offered during our trip. We knew we were missing out, but planned to keep it reserved for our next visit. It was then, during our trip when we visited the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, that my mind was plagued by an idea that I simply could not let go. See, I always knew about North Sentinel Island, an isolated part of the world where the Sentinelese resided. 



I knew about the murdered missionary from 2018, yet when I was on the Tarmugli Beach and learned that the Island was only 20 miles away, it was as if the seed for an obsession was sown in my creative mind that had always been a fertile ground for all the wrong ideas. We returned from Andaman a week later, and two more days later, we were at the Chennai International Airport, looking at our pictures and posting them on all our social accounts. Carl was over the moon; he was constantly on the call with Rose, telling her all about our escapades and reassuring her that he wasn’t cheating on her whenever he mentioned a girl we met on our travels. 



He had definitely cheated on her, but I wasn’t about to rat him out. Sadly, I wasn’t as excited as him, I wasn’t happy, it was as if some unseen force was using half of my brain to obsess about the island and how close I had been to it. I had been researching it for the past two weeks, how it was affected when the Britishers tried to colonize it in the 1800s, how the Sentinelese survived the two world wars, how they survived the tsunami of 2004 and how their origin was still a mystery. Their skin color and stature might suggest that they belong to the Indian subcontinent, but their hair and other traits might also suggest African descent. 



During the time they allowed contact in 1991 with the members of the tribal welfare from India, their language was completely incomprehensible even by the indigenous neighboring tribes of the Andaman, and this left everyone puzzled. But there are rumors that recordings from that time were analyzed years later, and experts behind closed doors found the language and dialect to have been inspired by those found in the Dominican Republic, Papua New Guinea, and some areas of Indonesia. All these unanswered questions were buzzing in my mind like a beehive. It was as though the island was the queen bee, and all these questions were just looking to nest in my brain until they turned the rest into nothing but oozing red honey. 



And thus, unaware where this incessant obsession would lead me, I made the first huge mistake: I told Carl that I was going to stay behind. He was taken aback at first, thought I was joking, he thought I was suffering from FOMO, but I quickly convinced him. That day I realized the power of phrases like “finding myself”, “discovering my meaning in this world”, “a calling from this land” and above all “want to go on my spiritual journey”. These work rather well on us tourists for a reason. 



But once Carl was gone, I was faced by the existential dread of my decision, I had just decided to stay back in a country that I did not know, a country that isn’t exactly known for upholding its laws, a country they warn you is only beautiful and welcoming as long as you’re a tourist. Maybe it's the reason why I did not mind when the Airlines took 3 hours to process my refund and cancellation. Perhaps I wanted to stay in the confines of the airport as long as possible but by the time I had come to this conclusion, I realized I had been researching the island on my phone all this while. 



It was as though having the North Sentinel Island on my mind had become a second habit; it was like a drug that I needed, it was my nicotine…and I had become addicted to it. And so I did the only thing you can do as a white man in a third-world country. I opened Google, looked for registered guides and hired a young man with great ratings and hoped for the best. An hour later, Bala (pronounced Bah-luh; he was pretty particular about that) showed up. 5’8” or 9”, curly hair, dark skinned, decent build. He was like any other overly welcoming Indian I had met during my travels. He shook my hand for a bit too long and then began to tell me about the city. I stopped him right there and told him what needed to be done (not the Island part, god no). 



I told him I needed a place to stay and that I would need to employ his services for at least the next two months. He tried to hide his excitement, but I knew the opportunity seemed quite tantalizing to him, and when I said that getting a place near him would be ideal so that neither of us would have to travel a lot, he was pleasantly surprised. Bala asked me about my plan, and so I concocted the story of trying to find myself by experiencing the country's real life, away from the hustle of the city, and wouldn’t you know it, the man turned his work into a vacation of his own. He convinced me that I must visit rural India if I want to experience true India. 



Bala’s said that his family home was in a nearby village, and if I was serious about this, we could both go there and experience all I needed for my “spiritual” journey. At that moment, I knew we would get along just fine; he was like me and liked turning work into vacations, and I couldn’t say no. So two days later, and after much travelling, I ended up in the village of Vedal. Now, to keep it brief, I will skip the part about my stay in the town, but I thought I took the village life pretty well. I had a decent routine of waking up, exercising, visiting the temple and then spending the day locked up in my room, trying to contact anyone who could get me more information about the island. My first and biggest hurdle was keeping my conscience clean. 



The Sentinelese have been isolated for hundreds of years, and the biggest risk we outsiders pose to them is germs. Unknowingly, I or anyone tagging along for the ride could be carrying pathogens or bacteria that could wipe out the entire population. And so I looked up ways to ensure that nothing of the sort happened. I exhausted all resources on the internet and after some awkward conversations with my ex-girlfriend Cynthia, who is a doctor, I learned that the best possible way was to get tested again and again for everything possible before embarking on my journey. And as a necessary precaution, I decided to bathe in diluted bleach before approaching the island. I know, I know it's stupid, and this all changed when the plan was executed, but I felt pretty good with this idea back then. 



The next part was contacting people who would help me in this illegal act. Visiting the island is prohibited, and the coast guard keeps a vigilant eye on it, so I decided to hit the dark parts of the internet in India, but quickly realized that the gangsters online were either teenagers looking for some clout or people that wanted at least $5000 upfront even before discussing the plan. I quickly realized that this was dangerous and I could end up getting myself doxxed or worse, so I decided to try a local approach. There was a rather shady man in the village who seemed like the perfect candidate for my requirements. 



He was the village drunk, and though I knew he couldn’t help me, I also knew he could lead me to people who might. So one night I decided to follow the man, but that is when everything fell apart. Bala had been keeping a close eye on me, and being a small village, he already knew what I was doing. And so that night, on the steps of the temple after he caught me tailing the town drunk, I had to come clean. Now that I look back at it, it might have been some sort of holy intervention. Because when I told Bala what I was trying to do, he told me he would help me. It turns out he, too, was curious, and he wasn’t about to let go of a golden opportunity like this. 



However that’s when the good part ended because I knew that we both had fucked up by coming to the village. So the next day, Bala decided to get in touch with a few of his contacts to find a way to the island, and thus he was gone for two days. Two days, 48 hours, after having almost spent two weeks here, they should’ve passed by like a breeze, but no, my obsession was at its peak, and my anxiety was slowly crawling from my nerves towards my bones. I became jumpy, less receptive and by the end of the second day, I decided to dig myself into a deeper hole. What if Bala was calling in the authorities? I mean, the government would give him a hefty reward for getting me captured, right? What if his family was keeping a close eye on me so that I wouldn’t run away? 



My mind was a mess, and I couldn’t sleep that night. And when my guide returned the next morning, I quickly ambushed him for some answers. I hit him with a barrage of questions, offered him a lot of money in exchange for not handing me over to the authorities, and this went on for a few minutes while the man stared at me with a dumbfounded expression. When I was done, he simply sat me down and began laughing. Turns out the police in the country work in mysterious ways, and if I were to trust him, he would only be bringing trouble to himself if he handed me over to the authorities. 



But this is when he hit me with the bad news: none of his contacts were powerful enough to see the entire job through, but one man, a former guide, his mentor, gave us some hope. The man had heard a rumor of an orphan who was found at sea around 30 years ago. He was taken in by a local family in a rural village, and that was the end of the story, but not the rumors. According to the rumors, the child, though around the age of 7, didn’t speak any language that his rescuers could understand. He had sunburns all over his upper body; the part of his body that was in the water was pale, wrinkly, and had several bite marks all over it. 



Some rumors even claim that he had a huge gash on his back that had become septic by the time he was found. The kid had curly hair, yes, but different, just like the Sentinelese. This was an urban legend decades old, now lost to time and remembered only by a few, a few like Bala’s mentor. And so we waited with baited breath for two more days, and this time I decided to pass the time the only way I knew, through alcohol and cigarettes. And then on the night of the third day, when I had given up all hope and had almost driven the queen bee out of my mind, Bala pounded on the door to my rented apartment. I was drunk on alcohol, but Bala was drunk on excitement; the call had come, and his mentor had located the supposed Sentinelese child that was found out at sea. 



I tell you all about this because I need to do something so I can sleep at night, and anonymously letting people know about my story gives me hope that I might live on through this tale. Because I know my end is near. I’ll be posting more soon, but I need to gather my thoughts, I need to get the story straight so that it does right by all those that are involved in it, I’ll never be able to repay them, but I can make sure I tell you all about them and what we saw when we reached the island.
