I woke up this time in the mall’s theater. The old kind, with red velvet curtains and sticky floors. The screen buzzed gray and staticky, showing nothing at all.

But then, my own face flickered onto the screen.

I flinched.

It was a moment I didn’t recognize. I was walking through the kitchen with blood on my apron and I was… smiling?

I wasn’t me.

And behind me in the shot, blurred like bad reception; it was him. Tall. Slouched. Watching.

The Time Maker.

I sat there frozen until the film sputtered and burned out on the reel. Then I noticed it. Carved into the armrest of the chair next to mine:

“The Time Maker is weak when we remember.”

I squinted at it until the lights started flickering, and a low hum filled the theater. That sound meant change. A shift was coming. But this time, I braced myself.

When I blinked, I was in the employee back hall, that cursed corridor behind the food court. And taped to the wall this time, not pinned, just messily taped, was a photo.
Jonah’s. Below it:

*Rebellion Detected. Kitchen Duty: Permanent.*

No.

No!

I ran. I screamed his name through the echoing halls. I passed mannequins slumped in store windows, people frozen mid-purchase, like time had paused for everyone but me.

In a dark service hallway, I found a metal box that had never been there before. A security control panel, dusty but humming faintly. I wiped it off.

“SYSTEM: UNSTABLE. MANUAL OVERRIDE REQUIRED.”

A crack in the code. A door left open by mistake.

The corridor beyond the control panel stretched longer than it should have. Every step I took echoed, but only my footsteps made sound. Jonah’s name still caught in my throat. I felt him; near, far, and nowhere at once.

At the end of the hallway was a door I hadn’t seen before. No label. Just rusted steel, pulsing faintly like it had a heartbeat. I pushed it open.

Cold air hit me. Stale. Chemical. Wrong.

Inside was a maintenance room, but stripped bare, as if everything had been scavenged except the floor tiles and ceiling bulbs. At the center stood something that looked like an electrical chair made from mannequin parts. Wires spilled from the arms like veins.

Someone was sitting in it.

I staggered back. My heart rattled in my chest like a trapped wasp.

It was me.

Or… something shaped like me. It had my face, my haircut, even my nail polish, but the skin was waxy, slightly melted, and its eyes were glossy black marbles. It stared without blinking.

Then, it smiled.

A red line split across its face, from ear to ear. Teeth like cracked porcelain.

“I remember you,” it said in my voice.

I turned to run, but the door behind me had sealed. A monitor blinked to life on the far wall as grainy footage began to play. 

Jonah, scrubbing dishes in the kitchen, silent tears mixing with the suds.

Then it cut to him in the bookstore, blood on his hands. Then to him curled on the floor of the arcade, whispering my name to no one.

I choked down a scream as my own tears began to drip down my cheeks.

The thing in the chair laughed.

“You’re not the first,” it whispered. “We all get copied eventually. When you start to remember too much, he builds a backup. Just in case.”

It leaned forward. The wires jerked as its head twitched to side.

“But he never gets it quite right, does he?”
The air snapped like an electrical surge. Lights buzzed and flared.

Suddenly I wasn’t alone in the room.

All around the walls, mannequin versions of me stood. Dozens. Each one marked with a red tag around its neck: Scenario Failure. Recycle Pending.

I inhaled through clenched teeth and took a step back.

The mannequin in the chair tilted its head further, and its smile twisted into something feral.

“He knows you’re trying to break out. And he doesn’t like to lose.”

Then the ceiling opened.

A shriek tore down from the rafters; metallic, layered, inhuman. A shape dropped from the darkness above, long limbs, too many joints, a face like a broken vending machine. Its fingers were keys. Its mouth was a barcode scanner.

The Time Maker’s puppet.

I had no weapons. Just a plastic clipboard from the wall and my memories.

I dove as it lunged. Wires slashed across my back. Pain bloomed hot and wet. I crawled between mannequin legs, heart hammering, and slammed the clipboard into the emergency panel by the exit. Sparks flew.

The door shook open an inch, then jammed.
I turned to see the puppet climbing over the wax copies of me, limbs cracking like splintering wood. It screamed again.

I shoved my arm through the door gap, fingers searching for anything to pry it wider. I felt something cold and flat, a crowbar? I yanked as hard as I could. The puppet shrieked, inches behind me.

I pulled harder.

The door flew open and I fell through, slamming it behind me with a crash that echoed like thunder through the walls of Edenridge Mall.

The room I landed in wasn’t real. It was a food court, but the tables were all in perfect rows. The food on the plates looked molded from plastic and everyone, every person, was staring at me. Not moving. Just staring.

Every table was occupied.

Every face familiar.

Jonah. Me. The woman in the red apron. The janitor I saw mopping once in a looped hallway. The little girl with the balloon who vanished when I blinked.

All versions.

All failed scenarios.

All perfectly still.

I backed away, trying not to breathe too loudly. The lights above hummed. Then, without warning, every version tilted its head at the same time.

*Snap. Snap. Snap.*

I ran.

Their bodies didn’t move. But their eyes followed. Hundreds of eyes. Watching me.
And as I sprinted through the fake food court, something chased me.

Not footsteps. Not breathing.

Laughter.

My laughter.

High and broken and wrong.

It came from the walls, the speakers, the ceiling tiles. Overlapping, looping, spiraling into shrieks.

I found a door labeled STAFF ONLY and barreled through as darkness swallowed me again.

When the lights came back, I was standing in front of the Arcade. The same arcade where Jonah once told me his name, under blinking lights and fake 8-bit music.

But this time, all the machines were dead. Screens cracked. Cabinets smashed. Tokens scattered like teeth.

And in the center of the room, sitting cross-legged on a carpet stained with old soda was a child.

She was building something… from bones.

Little ones.

I froze as she looked up at me.

“No one leaves,” she whispered. “Not really. They just shift deeper.”

I opened my mouth, but the words felt trapped.
She held up a rib bone, small and white.

“Do you want to forget again?” she asked sweetly. “It’s easier. He’ll make you someone new. Happier. You could be the girl at the jewelry kiosk. Or the perfume rep. Or the lost child crying near the fountain…..”

“No,” I said, finally.

“No?”

Her smile vanished. 

She dropped the bone, shattering it on the carpet like glass.

“You’ll regret that,” she growled, as the arcade evaporated like steam.

I was running through a shoe store now, ankle-deep in black water. The walls wept. The mannequins were gone but the storm had followed me inside.

Thunder cracked above, but there was no ceiling. Just sky, purple and churning and full of eyes. Watching. Always watching.

I screamed for Jonah.

The store shelves stretched into rows of hospital beds. People were strapped to them. Dreaming. Their eyelids fluttered like moth wings. Screens above their heads showed mall footage, looped clips of shopping, working, dying.

I staggered past them. Every face was someone I remembered. People I’d seen in other timelines. Trapped, just like me.
Some of them whispered as I passed.

“Don’t wake up.”

“Don’t break it.”

“Don’t remember.”

I pressed my palms to my ears and kept running. 

Eventually I found a mirror. It was in the middle of a mattress display. One of those standing full-length ones; unbroken.

I stepped in front of it, but didn’t see myself; I saw Jonah.

He looked terrified. I reached for him and realized, he wasn’t looking at me. He was looking through me.

I turned.

The Time Maker.

He changed. Now his form scraped the ceiling. His limbs bent in impossible directions. His face was a blender of identities, changing every second. Jonah. Me. The child. The mannequin. The manager. The butcher.
And in the center of his chest was a pulsing red light. 

I didn’t think. I ran at him with rage as he shrieked like a collapsing building.

I jumped, sank my fist into the core and time shattered. For a moment, maybe a lifetime, I was in every scenario at once.

Bleeding in the bookstore. Cooking in the kitchen. Watching Jonah vanish in the mirror. Screaming in the theater. Crying in the rain.
Trapped. And then..Stillness. Silence. Dark.
One final voice echoed through it all. Not Jonah’s. Not mine. The Time Maker’s.

But softer now. Smaller. “You win,” it rasped.

I woke up again. But this time, not in a scenario. Not in a store. I was lying on the floor in a familiar hallway. 

———

Everything here is dull and lifeless now. The air smells stale, yet still electric; like an old battery running on fumes. 

Jonah is here too. We know what we have to do. 

There is only one door left that started it all and it’s still written in red. 

**ORIENTATION.**
