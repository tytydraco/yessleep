I’ve known him since we were twelve. Caleb, I mean. We went to middle school together in a small town in Idaho, just along the edge of Salmon Challis National Forest: the fourth largest forest in the United States.

I wasn’t a fan of cities, but Caleb was another breed when it came to the outdoors. In class I’d watch him scribble in his notebook about survival plans and gear he’d need for simple camping trips he’d go on with his father on the weekends. They’d only be gone a couple of days but Caleb would always come home with fantastical stories as if he’d been some lone survivor of a plane crash. Thinking about it now, I think that’s what he really wanted.

When we grew older I would often catch Frank, Caleb’s dad grumbling about how he regrets being so open to the outdoors with Caleb. He would talk about how unpredictable Caleb had become and how much his mother worried for him.

Caleb ran away for the first time in grade seven after telling me one of his many survival plans at recess. We had been sitting against the cement school, looking out at all of the other students. It was nearing winter and the air was just beginning to have some chill to it. 

The schoolyard bordered a thick forest that students were forbidden to go into, but Caleb would often disappear into it for hours and when he was eventually found, he would be thrown into the principal's office and his parents would have to sit and have a talk. I would simply go back to class and continue my work, wondering what would become of my best friend.

The other students were just what you would expect from a group of seventh graders; The boys wandered around the tarmac with their hands in their pockets, looking at the ground and sharing their stories about girls and overusing each and every curse word in the book. 

The girls were gathered in little clumps in every hidden space on school grounds, sitting in circles and sharing their deepest secrets, like who they had a crush on and what their mom called their dad the other day over dinner. Sometimes I felt as if me and Caleb were the only kids in the whole school, or the whole world that actually thought about things. Who noticed things and realized things, not just lived.

Caleb and I sat against the school wall and watched. I had my hands between my knees and Caleb had his legs pulled up under his chin, his arms wrapped around them.

“So you know that rock just outside the highway on your way into town, right?” He asked in his shrill little voice. His voice never changed from that of a pre-pubescent teenager’s, even after he graduated high school. 

I nodded at his question. I’d gotten used to his stories and theories and ideas, so I would just nod in agreement to just about everything he said. I would grow to regret that.

“Well I figured, when me and my dad were driving past it that there was this cave, like on the side of it and I think that’d be a good spot to set up, at least for the first few nights.”

His words only crossed my mind and left me. I’d heard this idea before, somewhere between the treehouse theory and the steal-a-car-from-the-dump idea.

“What do you think, Kurt?” He’d asked me with wide eyes, but before I could answer, the bell rang for class and we retreated back inside for math.

The next day, I sat beside an empty desk. No one questioned his absence but me. I suppose nobody else cared whether little old Caleb lived or died…they had their own friends and drama. I didn’t, though. Caleb was my only friend. We’d both been the only kids from our elementary schools to come to Parks Middle, so we’d attached to one another right away.

When I came home, my mother asked me if I’d seen Caleb at school today. That’s when I knew something was wrong. 

As it turned out, Caleb hadn’t been home at all that day, not even in the morning. 

I’d instantly regretted all of my decisions. I guess I thought he was bluffing or something, I never really thought he would do it. I should have never acted so passive about his ideas, especially the cave. I thought he had been imagining this cave that he’d spoken of yesterday, but when my dad sat me down at the table and forced every bit of information out of me regarding Caleb’s disappearance, he told me one very unsettling fact.

There was in fact a cave on the side of that rock along the highway into town, and it was usually populated. My dad told me, with the coldest expression, that that cave Caleb had supposedly gone to was a hideout for “bad people,” as he’d called them. 

He made me feel like it was my fault that Caleb was in danger, and I carried the weight of that shame for a long, long time. Even after Caleb was found in perfect health by the town sheriff and officers. He had apparently been stocked up with canned beans, a blanket and a flashlight, but he had forgotten a can opener and was apparently very embarrassed about that. 

My mother had told me, three days after Caleb had initially gone missing, that he had been found and was safe, and doctors were checking him for any injuries or anything. There were no bad people at the cave, at least not when Caleb was there, and I was convinced my dad was just trying to make me feel bad for Caleb’s disappearance. Even if it was a lie, my dad was right about one thing: I should never be so flippant with Caleb’s words ever again.
