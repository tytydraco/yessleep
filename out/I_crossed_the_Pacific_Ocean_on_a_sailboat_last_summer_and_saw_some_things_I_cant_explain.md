I was on an ocean crossing from San Pedro, California to Papeete, Tahiti on a 60' sloop, we left in early July. 5500 miles. It was me, 1st mate, another crew, and a First-time captain. I was the head nightwatchman along with the 2nd mate.

 I had always heard stories from saltier sailors than I about the things that can happen when your out for that long and that far, but I always took it as sailors making up tall tales to tell drunk. I had spent the last 2 years on and off at sea, mostly in the Yasawa region of Fiji, and the Hawaiian Islands.

 I had seen plenty of weird things on land, but being at sea always seemed safe apart from storms. You can almost forget that anything goes on under the inky darkness of the sea.
The first almost week of the trip went by almost without a hitch, other than a small diesel tank leak that we were able to fix pretty quickly and a few odd scraping and bumping sounds coming from the aft of the ship that we concluded were the autopilot.

Everything seemed fine, and me and (we'll call him mark) Mark, the 2nd mates night watches were pretty dull. Nothing but black ocean for eternity. That is, until the voices started. I'd heard this story before, the disembodied voices that call out to sailors on long trips, urging them to their doom. But this was different. The voices only sometimes seemed to be talking to us.
Most of it seemed like ambient conversation, far off and distant enough to where you can't make the words. 

 This would happen almost  exclusively at night, while me and mark were on watch. They didn't seem malicious for the most part though, we were just silently sailing through their part of the world, and we were of little consequence to them. Nobody wanted to be the first one to mention that they were hearing voices at night, so whenever mark finally brought it up at dinner one evening, me and the captain breathed a sigh of relief that we weren't the only ones hearing them. 

We continued to hear the voices almost the whole trip, and could sometimes as we got used to it, make out actual accents, British, Australian, American. They became almost comforting. The comfort did not last for long.

It was the night of day 12, and we were 1000+ nautical miles from any land. Since we were smack dab between the Marquesas Islands and Los Angeles, there were no ships on the AIS for hundreds of miles. We were outside of the shipping lanes. If anything happens to us out here, it would be days before rescue, and that's if we get a signal out. 

It was around 3am, 2 hours before my shift was done, and we had a policy of only using red light in the cockpit at night to save our night vision in case we need to go forward and fix something, which happened quite often. I was looking at the nav when I felt something watching me from the aft of the ship.

There's not a lot of interaction with anything other than the crew out there, so you know when there's another "presence" almost. Happens when there's whales or dolphins too, hard to explain. The ship had a swim step on the stern, and then a 2ish foot tall transom until you got into the actual cockpit. | looked back at the stern and crouching on the swim step so only it's forehead, eyes, forearms and hands were visible was a blackish grey... Thing. It was bald and looked shiny, and it was staring intently at me with beady eyes reflecting the red light do the cockpit. 

My first thought was," we're going a little fast for a seal to get on the swim step..." but as I thought that it raised its head enough for me to make out what looked like a nose that opened vertically, & it raised its arms so that it's palms were still flat on deck but it's elbows jutted out far behind it. I froze, and after meeting it's gaze for a few moments, stared directly ahead at the nav, not being able to look at this thing any longer.

 A moment later I heard a splash which made me look back, and it was gone. I was still frozen, and mark, looking forward, hadn't seen or heard anything.

 I'm not sure why I didn't call the man overboard, maybe because I knew it wasn't Mark or the captain. To be honest I was more happy it was off the ship than I was that it was a person I didn't say anything about it for a couple days.

Then, at dinner one evening the captain told us of something he head seen in the early hours of the morning ring that day. A dark, slender thing treading water next to the ship, lazily bobbing there but never taking its eyes off the captain. I then relayed my story to him and the 2nd mate, and we couldn't come up with an explanation.

 We didn't see anything else for the rest of the trip, but we all did get that sense that we were being watched while we were on deck at night.
Finally we put into Tahiti after 24 days, and I had pretty much forgotten about the thing or written it off as a seal in my mind. That is until we went below the transom to unload, where the autopilot is. There, next to the hatch that leads to the swimstep, the extra life jackets had been shredded and moved to open a place where something could lay down. 

The latch to the swim step hatch was broken, and the 3 of us knew that it wasn't the autopilot making the scratching noise the first two weeks. Does anyone know what thins thing could've been? I'd just like to get it out of my mind, sometimes I think I still see it in shadowy corners o ships or dark rolling waves, blinking behind the swell
