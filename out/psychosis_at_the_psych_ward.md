So I was admitted to the psych ward for what I didn't know at the time was biopolar 1 psychosis. I had gotten it in my head that my father was secretly abusing my grandmother and that I would be next. In a rage, I drove to my grandfather's house to tell him what I thought was happening but I blacked out while driving. Apparently i jumped out of my car, walked for a bit before collapsing on the ground. During the blackout I had visions where I saw my soulmates and they would tell me it was ok for me to go on, then i would proceed to die and be reborn again. Each time i would meet a soulmate the rebirth was shorter. It was horrible, i felt like i experienced death a million times and it wouldnt stop until I woke up in the hospital. When I arrived I was greeted by one of the patients. 

Tall young guy, about my age. As we talked i found out he was a year younger than me and had gone to ( college near me). When his parents divorced and the pandemic hit, he was forced to drop out of school and to move into an assisted living facility with a bunch of old people due to his diagnosis with schizoaffective disorder. He seemed very normal to me, nice even. As expected, he asked me why I was there. I explained to him that I was only on antidepressants before and had these weird visions all of a sudden. In the middle of explaining what I saw he asked if I saw soulmates. I really freaked out that he knew that and then I remembered one of my visions. I remembered seeing myself seated at a table across from a man just like I was at that moment. I got really scared. He then pointed to the TV and when I looked I started having auditory hallucinations. It sounded like a radio frequency from another dimension. I had never experienced that before. I told him to stop what he was doing and he did. Suddenly the auditory hallucination stopped.Â 

 He then proceeded to do it again. I was overwhelmed but he was calm and kept talking like everything was fine. Suddenly, I got scared of him. Something felt wrong. It was probably the psychosis but how could one person control another's psychosis? I tried to stay calm and not offend him. We talked some more about some personal issues we were experiencing. He confessed to me that due to his medications, he couldn't feel anything and he gathered that I have a problem where I feel too much. At this point, I wanted to stop talking with him but was afraid to upset him. Eventually I found a way out of the conversation. Later another patient went up to me and warned me to not talk to the "guardian angel". Confused I asked her who she was talking about and there he was standing near by. I took her warning and stopped talking with him.
