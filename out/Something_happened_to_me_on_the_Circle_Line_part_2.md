I’m not proud to admit it, but at this point, I was panicking slightly. I have really bad night blindness, so I couldn’t see anything at this point, and I wasn’t sure how long my battery would last if I turned on my phone flashlight.

I don’t remember how long I was just sitting there panicking. I guess it doesn’t matter. But at a certain point, I calmed down enough to realise that there were lights further down along the train. Not the train lights coming back on, just tiny little points of light in the dark. I don't know what they are, but they're all I have. Once I feel like I can breathe right again, I stand up and start walking towards the lights. 

Now, the lights are pretty distant, and like I said, I’m night-blind as shit, so I can’t exactly make out the source. But they’re the only thing grounding me right now, so I try to get closer to them as best as I can. They’re moving around like little white fireflies, and no matter how long I walk, I never seem to get any closer to them. Full disclosure, I don’t really have a great intuitive sense of time. I have no idea how long exactly I was walking, but it *felt* like a while. It *felt* like I should have made a decent amount of progress down the train, but I had no sense of where I was and it didn’t seem like I was any closer to the lights. I shouted out into the train, 

“Hello?”

No answer. No sound but the train rumbling along the tracks. 

And then there’s this… other sound. I don’t exactly know how to describe it. The best I can do is tapping, or maybe a low clicking. It seems like it’s keeping time with my own steps. At first, I think maybe it’s just the train itself making a weird noise, or maybe the electricity trying to come back on or something. But it’s so rhythmic. It’s kind of like a metronome, actually.

I can feel my chest going tight and my shoulders tensing up at this point as the lights get no closer and the sound seems to follow me. Eventually I decide battery be damned, I need to turn on my flashlight so I can see and stop panicking. I fumble in my pocket for my phone. The second my hand touches it, the other lights go out. All in perfect sync, blinking out with what sounds almost like a sharp gasp. 

I stumble back and flail out to the side, trying desperately to find the seats so I can sit down again. My eyes are watery and I can’t breathe right and it feels like my head is full of fuzz. I can’t shake the feeling that I’m not where I’m supposed to be. I mean, obviously, I’m supposed to be meeting Jess by now probably, but this feels deeper than that. I can’t really articulate it, and maybe it’s just anxiety, but there’s just this deep, pervasive sense that I should not be on this train now, and I never should have been. I don’t know what train I’m on but it isn’t the Circle Line from Paddington. 

I eventually manage to take out my phone and turn on the flashlight. I still can’t see a whole lot, partly because my eyes are all watery and also because, like I said, it’s an older phone, so the light isn’t very good anymore. But it’s just enough to illuminate a little of the area around me, the seats and the sticky floor and the support pole just to my side. The tunnel is still dark and I don’t know where we’re going, and for some reason, I lift up my phone and point the flashlight at the window, hoping I’ll see a sign or a station or something to give myself some sense of where I am. But of course I can’t see into the tunnel at all, just a hazy reflection in the window. The bright flare of the light, my own face… and something just behind it. For a moment I think it’s just a smudge on the glass or something, but it looks altogether too much like another face. Or, almost like a face. It doesn’t look right. It’s like a police sketch or a composite photo or something, if that makes sense. The sight of it makes me shiver, and I turn around, lowering my light slightly so as not to flashbang the person- or, what I assumed was a person- as I did.
