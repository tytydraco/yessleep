(The woods, and the market.)
It was a beatingly hot day, and Ms. Lane hoped it would be at least some measure cooler in temperature when she reached the market; but it was not to be so. She fanned her porcelain face, stepping with distracted grace through the motes of dust that inhabited the dirt paths. Her red shoes were soon quite covered in the stuff, and she patted at her muslin dress- skirt to ensure it would not suffer the same fate. She was rather bogged down by the heat, but still, her spirits soared now that she'd left the confines of the Lane House. 
Vendors and customers alike milled about, each invested in their own dear quest, whether it be to sell their wares, secure the best bargain on the choicest cut of meat, or simply to keep cool.

Ms. Lane's chosen quest was to seek out a stall with an ice chest; a goal she achieved after only brief pursuit, coasting to a stop under the blue striped awning of a refreshments tent. Shaking hands slid under the lid, slipping on the condensation slick Coca-Cola bottle. She palmed the man behind the counter a smoothed dollar bill; her "allowance" of sorts, set to her by Mr. Lane.

Coke in hand, our illustrious Ms. Lane soon veered into the shaded park, treading about the outskirts of the dusty, raucous, market. She pried the lid of the bottle off, reveling slightly in the relieving fizz of air. She raised it to her lips, the contrast of the cold, bright, sweetness so different from the muggy air that seemed to try and stifle even her smallest breath- and before long, a wasp had tracked the alluring sugar scent, and hovered about her head incessantly. Ms. Lane wrung her free hand in dismay, flailing at the creature in alarm. It was finally removed from her air space, and yet, our heroine noticed that it was not her blow that had ushered it away. A woman stood beside her, uncomfortably close, and pinched between her thumb and forefinger, was the wasp, struggling quite valiantly for its small, and violent, life. Ms. Lane gasped. The woman only smiled grimly, and she spoke in a tone reminiscent of grass rasping in the wind. "Begone, little beast, and bother this lady no longer". With this she released it; and it flew away with a broken whir. 

Our Ms. Lane was quite agape in awe, and the sight of it seemed to provoke a smile from the lovely woman. And she was very lovely, with a bone straight curtain of dark hair, pointed features, and the strangest eyes- they were quite too reddish to be called brown, and Ms. Lane likened them to garnets set perfectly on either side of a sleekly positioned nose. Her lashes brushed her cheeks on the rare occasion that she would blink- Ms. Lane noticed that this instinct was perhaps hampered in her new acquaintance. The taller lady smiled, beatific, as she gazed upon Ms. Lane. "There, the danger is gone." Ms. Lane shivered at the sound of her voice, and as dazed as she was, she felt that the danger was not, in fact, gone- and having thought this she stepped imperceptibly backwards. "Is it, truly?-" Lane inquired. The woman reached out, grasping a strand of Ms. Lane's golden bob, much in the way that she had trapped the wasp.
She rolled it between her fingers contemplatively before she answered, Ms. Lane holding her breath the whole while. 

"It will not be terribly long, before it is you that will be a danger." The girl finally hedged. Ms. Lane blinked confoundededly. Her? A danger? The only time she'd reckoned herself a danger was when she'd rode the strawberry palomino through a poker game in the garden- the rest of the day had been spent avoiding the gaze of Mr. Lane's gentleman friends. Still, it left her with an odd taste in her mouth, one of, almost, desire. She wondered what it was to be dangerous, to be feared.

 It caused her to shudder, and she told herself that this was revulsion. It was a lie. If she was feared- she thought ponderingly, what would she even do? Run off the occasional burglars from the manor herself? Or perhaps swan about without a care in the world of what was thought of her. Somewhere in these fevered imaginings she entertained a bloody image of the baker's son, pinned to a wall via a shining knife- she had great distaste for the man, he had a violent relationship with the florist's daughter, whom Ms. Lane had gone to school with.
 
She hated to see the plum colored bruises patterning her friend's arms and face, but it was always brushed off as a fall.
She'd next carry off the Smith father- he seemed to always treat his son like a disease, simply because he had yet to take a wife; the town speculated that he never would, some in more cruel tones than others. Ms. Lane flicked away a drop of sweat, jolted brutally back to the swampy summer heat. Her acquaintance offered a hand, stepping closer to the treeline. Ms. Lane acquiesced without hesitation. The woman led her under the tree canopy, and Lane noticed at once that the air was cooler here, perfumed withthe same pine-and-night scent that her guide carried. In a bout of giddy relief, she flung her leather shoes off without care, stripping off clinging stockings. Green moss cushioned her feet, releasing the slightest moisture if she were to move; she took a minute to delight in the cool feeling of it between her toes. She gave a tentative bounce, and the moss reciprocated, rising back up as she did. She felt somehow unashamed; though the woman watched her, her look was not of judgment. Once she tired of the moss, she followed the woman deeper, and still deeper into the woods. They were now fully among the trees, the only light filtered through thick green leaves and sprays of evergreen. It was here that the woman stopped; and the next few hours would pass for Ms. Lane like a dream, spent chasing eachother between the trees, peals of laughter upon being caught, spent falling to the ground, breathing heavily, chests heaving and arms just barely touching, before springing back up to repeat the energetic charade once more. She returned home just before sunset,  buzzing with a newfound and bolstered energy that was not to be dulled by a rather snappy Mr. Lane at supper. (The first night.)

Ms. Lane retired to her bed shortly after supper, not so much tired as at a loss of how to continue forwards in her new, strange, state of being. She lay upon her bed, curtains halfway drawn, and presently she found herself very overheated. The white curtains swayed in a mocking of some unearthly phantom, that brought no cool air; through their gap blue moonlight lay in rays across Ms. Lane's covers. She shifted impatiently, waiting for sleep. It was so very hot, even in night the summer's warmth had not been much doused. Her feet still ached from the extended walk in the market, drawing her to be uncomfortably aware of every sensation that came to her attention. 

Across the room a fly buzzed pathetically. Ms. Lane wrung out her sweaty hands and stowed them under her cheek, forcing her eyes closed; but it was no use, as the next time the curtains stirred, she opened them wide and they remained fixed upon the window. She felt almost as if she was in a trance, eyes locked on the window. The heat was sweltering now, and her high necked nightgown seemed too close about her neck- suffocating. Her lashes would now and then brush her cheek when she could manage to blink, but it was less a comforting reminder of life and more the evocation of a tiny scuttling thing- spiders. The lady was very much bewildered at her lack of rest, and quite bothered. 

Minutes passed, or perhaps hours- she rather felt as if they were years- and then. Then. A pale, paper-cut-out silhouette. Lavender against the navy sky, darker from behind the frothy lace curtains. Ms. Lane felt a shiver of part fear, part delight, creep up her spine, as she lay petrified before the shadow- the curtains felt a rather weak barrier, between her and It; yet she almost desired even that futile resistance be broken. Soon enough, perhaps too  soon, these half-desires were realized. A dusk blurred hand clutched at the curtain, a flick of the wrist parted them in two- here Ms. Lane stifled a gasp. The moonlight poured in from the curtains widening gap, and exposed the angled features of the one behind them. Burgundy eyes surveyed Ms. Lane, smooth tanned arms supported the lady's frame as she bent over Ms. Lane's prone form. It was the woman from the woods, still perfumed with that odd scent of pines and night, still wrapped in a strange static leisure that bordered on the predatory ease of a large cat. A hand brushed Ms. Lane's cheek, and she hardly dared to breathe, afraid it would break the spell. Her day on the whole had been so oddly dreamlike that she feared this, that she'd wake to a reality without this strange creature. 

The hand gave a gentle tug at Ms. Lane's hair and caused her lips to part in surprise; the figure hovered lower, breath ghosting over her face; Ms. Lane trembled restlessly, caught again between prey instinct and hypnotized wonder. She lifted her sweating, linen covered arm, hand grasping for purchase and finding it in the other lady's long, dark hair. It was reminiscent of when the illustratious Ms. Lane, in her childhood, had stroked a falconer's peregrine at the county fair; soft, and sharp. The woman bent still lower, and Lane felt her wicked smile curve against her collarbone. 

Her head was bowed against Ms. Lane's chest, and with a jolt she realized that the woman had somehow fully entered the room now. Ms. Lane held quite still, her heart fluttering in her chest like a captured dove- its rapid pace seemed to excite her visitor, who at once pushed yet again closer, nestling her lips in the side of Lane's neck. The pressure was soft at first, just rapid flutters- and then the lips settled in the hollow of her neck. Soft nubs circled her skin, growing gradually harsher; Ms. Lane bucked in terror as they dug in, lengthening in such a way that they quite pierced her skin, she could feel the slow, wet spread of her own blood, smelt it's coppery tang, and she tried futilely to wrest herself from those consuming points. The creature held her steady, uttering a soothing hum as she lapped the red bloom from Ms. Lane's neck. Ms. Lane felt quite faint; and she was rather terrified that the longer the sensation lasted, the less she wanted to resist. She felt needed, desired, like a part of some divine rite- not at all how lying beside Mr. Lane felt. Her heartbeat drummed in her ears and she grasped the back of the woman's head, this time not to push her away, but to pull her closer. The woman gave a muffled noise of delight, and Ms. Lane clung to her in the sea of darkness and moonlight. (The second night)

   


Ms. Lane's room was ready this night; she had swapped her white cotton sheets for a dark red, in hopes of it perhaps camouflaging any trickles of spilt blood- though she knew her visitor would quite disdain to to waste even a drop. Tonight Ms. Lane observed that her unearthly visitor seemed almost to examine her, as if looking for change, but as of yet finding none. (The third night)

Of this night Lane remembered very little,  only a hazy snapshot of her own teeth set into a lithe neck, of thick blood filling her mouth. And a name, slippery like it was doused in rainbow slick oil, fading and re-emerging at its own discretion: Lucia. She could not recall having spoken her own name in the woman's presence, but it's form was uttered many times that night, echoing against night. (Frances Margaret Lane)
    
 

She woke to Mr. Lane standing above her, a grim look on his bearish face- he swiftly hauled her up and dragged her to the crest of the cliff that their shared seaside home rested upon. Ms. Lane was shocked into silence, and paralyzed to do anything but listen to Mr. Lane's winding tirade that seemed focused on a single strand of hair. She quickly realized, with a start of dull fear, that he had found one of Lucia's dark strands, plastered incriminatingly on Ms. Lane's pillow sham. She now began to struggle weakly, still believing that surely he would not truly harm her. She knew that he'd had...dalliances. But Ms. Lane had never dragged him to the top of a cliff, never hung him precariously close to the grass covered edge. 

She did not assume ownership, and that, she supposed, was the difference. Rough hands dug into her waist, pushing her yet closer; if she were to fight now she would only fall to her death. Tears, hot and salty, pooled at the corners of her eyes. "Please." Ms. Lane begged, heart speeding with every light breeze, blown up from the water far, far, far, below. 
Mr. Lane only gave a borderline apologetic grimace- he barely seemed to hesitate when his arms released her, and then gave a violent shove. Ms. Lane reckoned that the fall should be taking longer; her scream trailed behind her in agreement but she had not yet reached the water. 

It would be alright, death was not fearful, not really- but her attempts to convince herself faltered as her body hit the crushing waves at a bruising speed. Immediately she was pushed under, the surface seemed so far away down here, barely perceptible brighter water above her. She would not make it in time, already her lungs screamed hungrily for air; she could not resist any longer and let the dark water course down her throat.

 Ms. Lane found that, shockingly, she was not drowning- cold water swarmed into her lungs but did nothing to hinder her breathing. She experimentally breathed in again, and still it did not harm her; in fact her lungs somehow seemed to take what precious oxygen they needed from the dark gush of ocean. And, the longer she stayed under, the more Ms. Lane could see, as if her eyes were no longer beholden to mortal constraints of dark or light. 

She rolled in the water, twisting each limb wonderingly; they were each unharmed. Ms. Lane kicked upwards, carving a path through the cool resistance, buoyed gently by the salt currents. It was a short swim to shore, and an even shorter climb back up the cliff, despite her
legs that trembled like a newly born fawn's, and in spite of her sea-drenched tea dress.
(Mr. Allen Jacques Lane)


She could not fault the man. Rather, it was society at large that was to blame. And, so forth, she reasoned, they would be in part to blame- for this. And it was spectacular, her teeth boring, scraping, seering his flesh. She bit in with a ferocity that would cause a todd fox to cower in his den, drive a soldier to tears, reduce a lioness to a shaking pile of fur. His scream was primal, one of fear, while hers faced his with glee, a thrill of the hunt finally unleashed from a burdened heart. Ms. Lane drew his blood into her throat, tongue driving red circles into his flesh as he thrashed; soon his cries subsided. 

She lowered the body to the ground, snatching at the soil, scooping it every other wich way. A shallow grave. Ms. Lane swept rich gravedirt over the corpse; when she had finished, she felt a great deal lighter. The cool evening air wafted over her skin, soothing her phantom sweat, and she was glad of it. She could feel freedom bouying her heart into the bright blue sky, and she left the cliff feeling weightless and grounded, free and oak-solid. (Frances and Lucia)

Frances found herself among the trees, where her journey of sorts had started. Lucia was quick to arrive, lithe arms thrown about Frances's neck in delight. Frances felt herself, moreso than she ever had. Looking at Lucia she could tell the other woman, if indeed that's what the two even where, felt similarly. They moved through the forest with ease, and the trees themselves seemed to hunger for their bond, forged in blood and kisses and Coca-Cola (The American dream)
                    
Beware the darkest forest, if you stray too far, you may well find something terrible and blood stained, glittery and glamorous and not at all safe- yourself.
