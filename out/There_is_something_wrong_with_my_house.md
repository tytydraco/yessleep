Hello everyone, I had just graduated college recently and got my first job. I’m an accountant. Not the best job but the pay is decent. I lived with my parents for most of my life. I have noticed they have gotten tired of me, so I had them help me look for a new house. 

I got a realtor stan. Stan took me on a tour on a few houses that were too expensive for my price range. Then He takes me to this house. Has 2 bedrooms, a kitchen, 2 bathrooms and a crawl space. The price was relatively cheap for a house like that. I asked why the price was so low. He told me its been vacant for a couple of years. 

He didn’t tell me why. But I took the deal because this was a decent house. I said goodbye to my parents moved into the house. I was going around after I moved in the house I noticed a drivers license. I figured the previous owner left it here.
 I thought nothing of it and went out with my friends. 

I got home and noticed a weird noise in the vents. I couldn’t figure it out. But nonetheless I took a shower, Put my PJ’s on and went to bed. I was sleeping since I didn’t have work until 7:30.
 I heard a knock on the door at 5 am. It was clearly way too early for people to be knocking at the door in this morning. I went to open it. 

I saw 2 pairs of shoes…. I was weirded it out by this, I called the police to report it. They came asked me questions, and took the shoes into evidence. I went to work that day. 
I got an unknown number calling me. I ignored it, It was a voicemail. 

It was a raspy voice breathing, I was about to delete it then I heard the same noice I heard from the vents last night….. I turned off my phone and went to work. I couldn’t stop thinking ab it. I remembered the guys name. 

I looked it up on my computer. 
He has been missing for 3 years. 
One day He just left, his car was still in his garage. Along with his personal possessions. His sister has asked if any information to call her. 
I called her while on my way home. She sounded weird on the phone. 

I mentioned her brother, and she started crying thinking this was a joke. I told her what happened. And she stopped. She told me “Don’t go back to that house.” 
I didn’t know what to do so I hung up. I got home I got an email from a unknown person It says “play me, Theres a surprise.” 

A link was attached. I watched the video, It made me sick to my stomach. The guy on the video was the guy who’s been missing. Tied up, begging for help. 

I hear that same noise i heard from the vents last night and The video went black. And he was screaming louder. I exited off the link and threw my computer across the room, I kept my light on and my tv. 
While I went to sleep, I had a nightmare That I was tied up, seeing something and right before I was attacked I woke up.

In sweat…. I hear another knock on my door. I grabbed my knife in case. Its a pair of jeans and a T-shirt. I called the police again, They came took my statement and took the shirt and pants for evidence. 

I asked “whatever happened to the guy who lived here a few years ago.” The cops told me the investigation was still going. His parents had died in that same house, and ruling he had a mental breakdown and ran away. 

I tried to show them the email, I remember i broke my computer. So they left, I went to work Seeing a picture on my passenger side seat. 
Its a picture of the house….. I ripped the picture.
 I stayed at work a-little longer that day. I looked up my house seeing reports on the news about missing people. That lived here, I called my parents to explain the situation but they didn’t want to hear it. I went to sleep. I woke up at 3am, to get a drink of water. 

I thought my mind was playing tricks. But i swore I saw something in the window on my porch. 
I turned on the water and saw blood for a second then it came back to regular water. I wasn’t thirsty anymore. I went to bed had a locked door. I woke up at 5. The knock came. I got my gun, and what i saw…… Was Skelton remains. I saw a note saying “You’re next.”  

I threw up, called the police and they identified the Skelton remains as the previous owner. They questioned the guy’s family and denied involvement. The police took me to the station for protection but I don’t feel safe. 
I asked the police “why me?” They told me “this house has had a history of people going missing, and people moved out of the house.” The previous owners said they never played the video but noticed all those weird signs. The worst thing is the people who saw what I saw on that video.
 Have gone missing….. 

The Police searched my house and they found things I can’t describe. Pictures of dead bodies the people who we’re missing. Clothes, Personal items etc. idk what to do….. I just got a text message from an unknown number. Saying “I am here.”
 If i don’t make it out alive. Pass this message, if you’re looking into buying a house. Make sure to know the history of the house. Before it is too late, before you end up like me, and the people missing…
