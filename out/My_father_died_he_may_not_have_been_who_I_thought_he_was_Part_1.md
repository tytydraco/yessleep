I remember vividly the precise moment in which I learned of my father's death. It was bitterly cold as the clock struck three in the morning, winter rain pounded mercilessly against the windows of the little apartment I shared with my best friend in the world, who had, without my knowing it, in an instant become the only person I had left in the world. Those misty panes of glass all around our small home rattled in the freezing wind that blew through town that night, carrying the icy rain with it as if searching for something, or someone. It was a mournful climate that had taken the city at that hour, the sky beating at the earth with wailing winds and raging rain. Perhaps the world itself had known before even I had learned of the events that had occurred mere hours before.

When my phone rang and faintly broke through the roaring downpour outside, waking me up with a sharp noise unlike the muffled rumble of the winter storm roaring through the night, I took a moment to let it ring so that I could determine who was calling me at three in the morning. There was no caller ID. I nearly let my head drop back onto my pillow, but I answered the call intending to give the person on the other end a piece of my mind if they turned out to be a scam-artist or some sort.

"Is this Lukas Woode speaking?" a pleasant-sounding woman asked as soon as I had groggily mumbled a greeting. I had to turn my phone's volume up as far as it would go to hear her over the weather. Once I confirmed my identity, the woman spoke again, keeping a brisk and chipper tone despite the hour, though she sounded significantly less cold as she continued. "I'm afraid I may have some bad news for you. Earlier this evening, a man was reported dead on the scene of a traffic accident, and we have since verified that that man was Markus Woode. Your name was the one he claimed as his next of kin. Do you know the man I'm speaking of?"

I don't remember what I said next, if I said anything at all. What I do remember is that the woman on the phone told me who it was that had called me, which was all I had really cared about at the time. I hung up the phone and dressed myself quickly, loudly, uncaring as to whether or not I woke my roommate and friend, Adam. I thundered out of the house in simple clothes that were soaked through quickly in the rain. I had no car to drive myself to the hospital, and neither did Adam, so I walked. Ran, more like it. The brutal rain and wind harassed me from all sides as if I alone was its target, but the deafening roar and numbing cold weren't the things that fogged up my mind, sapped all the warmth from my veins, froze my heart in my chest even as it hammered louder than any storm. To my mind, there was nothing that mattered except myself and the road, and my father at the end of it.

Fifteen minutes later, I crashed through the front entrance of the forensic medical centre, walking water and mud into the tile of the lobby. The woman at the desk spoke with the voice I had heard on the phone when we spoke. I could have been more polite to her, but I suppose she dealt with more than a few distressed people working where she did, and so she went to speak with one of the forensic examiners, a doctor that introduced himself with a name I did not care to commit to memory when we spoke some time later. The doctor escorted me through the halls of his workplace and brought me to the man they thought was my father. A fraction of my heart, a heart that was screaming at me from within my own head even though it sounded as distant as the rain that had soaked me to the bone in transit, still did not quite believe that my father really was dead. I didn't know what he was, if not, but I needed to see it to believe.

The room I was led to was dark, the overhead light only faintly illuminating the room even at such a time as three-thirty in the morning. That flickering bulb buzzed and hummed as it struggled to stay alight. The black tile of the floor drank in and swallowed that weak light, dull and lacking shine as my wet shoes squealed against them. The similarly dark walls made the small room appear to lack borders, as if I could have stepped off the tile and into black nothingness, a void that pushed in on my senses as I stepped closer to the middle of the room. A table stood in the middle of the black, morbid space, lengths and surfaces of silver that did gleam in the dying light from above, covered in a thin white sheet that conformed to a humanoid shape underneath. I approached the table and hovered above that shape, but hesitated to uncover it and see for myself.

The doctor did it for me. He brought the sheet down to expose the shape's head, and I was forced to grip the table so that I my knees did not buckle. My father and I had always looked alike. I had his nose, straight and narrow, though his had been broken a number of times, his pale skin and eyes, though his were far paler than I hoped mine would ever be as the pallor of death had washed over him, and his dark, thick hair, some of which was missing from his head along with fragments of his scalp. I gagged, and would have emptied my stomach if it had had anything in it. The ghostly image of my deceased father drove me to silent tears as I confirmed for the doctor that they had gotten the details of his identity correct.

A torrent of emotion tore at me until I had nothing left to give to that scouring rush of insane grief that left me feeling mad in its wake. It was about ten minutes later that I could stand without leaning on the table that supported the corpse that had once been a father to me mere hours ago, when I had been wrung out and robbed of all the emotion that I found it possible to express at three o'clock in the morning. It was only then, when my mind had been emptied of all preoccupation and I was utterly vacant, that my mind latched onto detail that was unfamiliar to me. The patches of his scalp that had been torn from his skull. The slash across his cheek. The burn that had left his ear a melted mass of skin and cartilage. I briefly wondered if it might have been a trick of the light, but my eyes caught on one thing in particular among my father's many small injuries.

Black stained his neck, covering his skin in long, flowing lines that streaked his flesh in the pattern of veins. I pulled the sheet down further to expose his shoulders, and the left shoulder bore the same pattern snaking down around the joint through the skin and further along his torso. I attempted to pull the sheet down even more to investigate more thoroughly, but the doctor stopped me with a hand on my wrist when I tried.

"I understand that you may be curious, but I am still conducting my examination," the doctor said with his imperious, cold manner of speaking. "If you wish, I can send you the results of my examination, once it is done, but until then, I apologise, but there is no more that you can do to aid us in our work."

I said nothing more except to apologise to the woman at the front desk on my way out for tracking dirt in upon my arrival, and left. On my way home, I walked through the rain again, but I wasn't concerned with getting sick or with the cold. What in the world could have done all of that to my dad's body? They had said that he'd died in a traffic accident, but anyone who knew my father would have known that that was nonsense. For one thing, my father had never driven a car in his life; we had lived in such a walkable city that neither of us had ever really needed to learn how. For another, he hadn't left his house in months after slowly transitioning into an early retirement from his job as a private investigator. He was only fifty-four, but his active lifestyle was catching up to him fast, so he had decided to check out early. What had he been doing out and about?

The real burning question was one I was almost afraid to even ask. What could have caused that strange black marking on his skin? That wasn't natural. My father hadn't had any skin conditions that I had known of, and it didn't look like scarring, so what? That was the thing that stuck with me as I stomped up the stairs of my apartment complex and clumsily dried my shoes before entering once again. I only stayed awake long enough to change out of my wet clothes and halfway dry my hair before I passed out in bed just as the clock struck four-thirty. It was indeed the the very early morning of the eighteenth of September, and even if my father might have died before midnight, I had only learned of it once the date had changed. What a wonderful twenty-seventh birthday gift.

When I woke up in the morning, I had a more in-depth conversation with the forensic medical examiner, and after that came to realise something that hadn't occurred to me before. As I was an only child and my mother passed many years ago, and my father hadn't remarried and had no living family at all other than myself — Magnus Woode had never been a family man — I was the sole inheritor of all his worldly possessions, as was later explained to me by the executor of my father's will, a lawyer he had saved from false accusations of malpractice back in the day, when he'd still been working as a PI.

Thus, I spent my birthday — which usually would have been spent with Adam getting so drunk that I could taste colours — combing through my father's house to mark what I wanted to keep and what I wanted to sell, since it was all mine now, including the house. My father had owned the place and, after I checked my bank that afternoon and realised that I'd inherited all the money he'd saved up over his long, lucrative career, it would be paid off for a long while if I didn't do anything stupid.

The house itself was an ancient place right in the heart of the city, hidden away between an office building and a sprawling manor that once had been the estate of a wealthy family before being renovated into a museum dedicated to the history and culture of the city. The outside of the place was narrow and tall, dark even as a bright, pale winter sun shone down on it with its sterile light, its aged wooden frame seeming to sway slightly in the breeze, or perhaps that was an optical illusion given the building's decrepit looks. I had only visited a few times since my father had bought the place, which had been when I had gone off to college almost ten years ago, so it was still mostly unfamiliar to me. Adam had volunteered to come along with me and help out with the sorting of things, but I turned him down. This was something I felt I had to do on my own.

The inside of the house was equally as dark and grimy. The house was so old that there were no overhead lights, so I had to take a quick trip to the store to buy flashlights; I wasn't about to waste my phone batteries, not when I was expecting more calls throughout the day. I went from room to room, exploring and marking everything that wasn't nailed down as something to sell or something to keep. I don't remember exactly what I had expected, but I was done by ten o'clock, and most of the work was able to be done in a sort of haze, going around and more or less absently judging everything that my father had owned for the last nine years of his life without expending much effort. My father had always been the kind of man to place little value on material possessions. A phone call with the executor of the will later confirmed that the entirety of the material collection I'd been left was indeed simply the house and everything in it, as little as that really was.

The mundanity and monotony of it lulled me into a state close to falling asleep on my feet, especially after seeing my father's body just hours before in the small hours of the morning, which had been such a shock to the system that my sleep after that point had been horrible and filled with horrible dreams I can still only half-remember. What brought me out of that state was discovering a door where I had never known there was one. The door was found right at the end of the long, narrow hallway that curved slightly to the right due to what I assumed was an error during the house's construction, which was shrouded in darkness even as I focused my flashlight on it from down the hall's meandering length. I walked down and opened the door, opening up a passageway I had never realised was there.

The door let out into a flight of stairs that curved and twisted around itself. The steps of the staircase moaned under my weight, and the frame of the twisting stairwell definitely swayed slightly as *I* descended the dusty corkscrew of steps. At the bottom, the stairs let out into a small basement that was even darker than upstairs had been due to the absence of windows and any sort of natural lighting. It was so dark that the beam of my flashlight seemed to dim slightly when I shone it into the room, as if the shadows in there were eating away at the brightness, or perhaps as if the light was fleeing the dark. The second I crossed the threshold into the room, goosebumps erupted all over my skin and I shivered in the cold that made all the hair on my body stand on end. I looked around vaguely, as if I would see anything outside the area my flashlight illuminated, which shrank the further I pushed into the room.

That basement must have been older than the rest of the house, given the rotted wooden beams holding up the ceiling, and the musty, stale air that made me cough and wheeze until I caught my breath. Dust swirled around my feet when I walked, and the floor was smooth, paved stone or hard packed earth, rather than wooden floorboards. There was nothing down there except for a decaying old stand made out of a dark wood that was glossy and shone like marble under the glow of my flashlight, and something that gleamed with a purity that was out of place in this disintegrating place, something that was placed atop the stand like a holy relic upon a pedestal. I approached it and shone my flashlight down onto it from above as I took a good look.

It was a book. The tome was thick, the yellowed pages within rested slightly unaligned with each other, giving it a homemade look. The covers were pitch black leather, matte and unreflective as it consumed the light I shone onto it. What did shine was the gilding on the front cover. It was silver leaf, gleaming and bright and pure, arranged in the shape of an eye that possessed a disquieting air of intellect, within a gilded noose that twisted around itself and closed in around the eye, whose pupil was a void of black leather at the very middle of the cover. The hair on my head stood on end, my usually messy, dark hair straightening out as it floated above my head when I moved to touch the book. Blood roared in my ears as my heart thudded in my chest, my limbs buzzes with energy as a charge filled the air around me, like electricity given form. My chest burned as I tried to breathe and couldn't suck in air. All these phenomena grew more sever the closer my hand came to touching the book.

What on earth was this thing, and why was it inducing such a reaction in me? I had no clue as to what I was provoking by doing this, but all of a sudden, my sleep-deprived and emotionally fatigued brain decided that this was the time for anger. This was my house now, this was my basement, and this was my book by association. I had lost more than I had really come to terms with just hours ago, and I was not in the mood for this. I owned all of this. That book was mine. I could touch it if I liked. And, with that, I did touch it.

The book was smooth to the touch, and had the feel of moisture even though the cover was as dry as everything else down in that basement. The silver gilding on the cover was cool, enough to sting slightly, and hard. The instant I pressed my hand down onto the cover of that book, thunder boomed overhead, the sound of the sky striking the earth, and the charge that had built in the air was released in a rush of air that was colder than I have words to describe. The foundations of the house shook, the rotted beams supporting the ceiling groaned, and the staircase wobbled. Distant, muffled impacts, rain landing upon the roof of the house in chaotic rhythm, drew my eyes upward. The load-bearing beams and boards that held the house up above my head creaked and groaned, and the floorboards of the ceiling — which was the living room's floor, if my memory of the house's layout was accurate — visibly flexed under their own weight.

I cradled the book in my arms and ran to the staircase just as another roaring crack of thunder rang out directly above the house, by the sounds of it. The foundations of the house trembled again, and the tearing of decayed wood filled my ears as the ceiling collapsed right behind me. I pulled myself up the staircase that churned and protested loudly, and flung myself up to the ground floor as fast as I could. When I stumbled out of the stairwell, I half-sprinted and half-staggered through the hall and out into the living room in a panicked daze. A thrill shot up my spine as I looked upon the destruction wrought by whatever it was that had just happened. The entire floor of the living room, which had supported a coffee table, a recliner, and a television, had caved in within a matter of seconds, and I laughed out loud as exhausted mania took me. I was having an insane day, and the only way I knew to stave off the despair and terror was to laugh.

Looking down at the book, I turned it over in my hands. The back cover was gilded in silver just like the front, but the image it made was vastly different. The image the back cover bore was that of a great tree with nine branches and three roots, all gnarled and twisted together to form a great clustered web of natural life. Upon the tree were perched three groups of three birds, each with one little eye, though what kind of bird I couldn't discern. There was a kind of hum to the book, like the charge from before but less intense, though it still gave me goosebumps. It pulsed in a rhythm, which was identical to the rhythm of the thunder roaring thousands of metres above my head. It was the rhythm of a heartbeat — *my* heartbeat. The charge of the book, the thunder shattering the sky above, the waves of rain soaking through the ancient wooden structure around me, it all came with the irregular heartbeat rhythm of my own fear.

An immense impact made me jump halfway out of my skin and yelp in shock and fear. That did *not* come with the tempo of my heartbeat. Neither did the sound of scattering, broken glass a second later. Making my way to the source of the sound, I discovered that a window in the kitchen had been shattered and the glass thrown across the floor around a bird that frantically flapped its wings for a moment before slowing and falling still. Blood began to pool around the dark bird, and its dead eyes fell on me in its final moment. It was a large, black bird with a gleaming beak and a shock of feathers around its neck that rose like a dog's hackles as it died; using my limited knowledge of avian species, I decided that it was a raven and not a crow.

Between crashes of thunder, this time accompanied by the flash of lightning outside that lit up the dark kitchen for less than a second, the croaking call of another raven drifted in from right outside the window. And then another. And another. And yet another. In a flash of blue-white lightning that cast deep shadows across the alley between my father's house and the office building beside it, I caught sight of black shapes circling around above the dark, gaunt building. Dozens of raven's calls were drowned out by the subsequent crash of thunder, louder than all the rest before it, as the house shook once again.

I hesitated for a moment to leave that house, a monument to my father, but my choice was made for me by the tidal wave of black feathers that pounded against every window of the house in an unrelenting surge of corvid suicide. The reverberating sound of glass shattering from every angle drove me to run, but I had hesitated too long. The ravens came for me while I was running through the main hall, diving and scratching at me, trying to catch me in the face with their razor-sharp claws and beaks. I screamed as my face erupted with scorching pain, and I tried to swat the ravens away from me using the weight of the book to bat them aside as I fled. The house shuddered in time with my quickening heartbeat as the thunder and lightning above surged, and the second I stepped outside with the book in hand, my vision was filled with blue-white light that came with a boom that took my hearing. My attackers disappeared as if struck down by the lightning.

Staggering onto the street and quickly becoming drenched by the driving rain that fell upon my at an angle propelled by the mournful winds that wailed as they blew, I turned back around and stared at what had become of the one material possession my father had bequeathed to me. From the very peak of the lonely, frail, ancient house, sparks flew and caught on the wooden panels making up its roof, upon which started a fire. Somehow, despite the rain and the wind and the cold, the wooden house all succumbed to flames, one wooden board catching and spreading it to the next, until black smoke began to waft into the air and sirens rang out from a distant street. Blinking rapidly so that my vision would properly clear up, I surveyed the small yard in front of the house to find dozens of shrivelled, black forms of a vaguely avian shape laid about as they let off a foul smoke that smelled of burning oil.

Panic took me then. Where did I go from there? What did I do with the book? What even was the book? Why had any of that happened the way it did? I had a hundred questions and no answers, so I tried to think of a course of action that I could take that would give me any semblance of comfort. My first thought was to get the book out of the rain so that I could have a chance to investigate it further at home once things calmed down. However, once I took a good look at it, I discovered that although I had become drenched from head to toe in the rain, the book had stayed perfectly dry. As I watched, the drops of water falling from above touched the book and seemed to slide around and off of it as I had seen from hydrophobic substances in high school science classes. The book was totally fine. Unfortunately, I was not, as the rain made the scratches and punctures on my face from the ravens' attacks sting even more.

I did not get all the time I would've liked to think about my next move. As storm clouds gathered overhead, winged shapes emerged from all around and began to circle around the flaming ruins of my father's old house and croak at my from the air. My feet pounded against the hard sidewalk as I sprinted away down the street, clutching the book close to my chest and pushing my tired body to move as fast as it could, which was not amazingly fast even at the best of times. This was decidedly not the best of times. I slipped and slid along the slick pavement as I ducked and dodged under attacks from ravens that tried to claw or peck my eyes out. One got my eyebrow, which stung so much that I actually shouted out in pain as its nasty little claws broke the skin in three shallow lines just above my eye, but no damage was done, so I pushed on.

The walk home was too far to make it on foot while being pursued by a whole flock of ravens. Did you know that the collective noun for a group of ravens is called an *unkindness*? I had away blown that little tid-bit off as a joke told by kids who wanted to sound smarter than they really were, but as I ran what felt like the length of a city while under attack from bloodthirsty corvids, I began to understand why they were called that. I needed a place to hide, and I needed it quickly. My only problem was that I didn't know any nearby shelters. I scrambled to maintain my footing on the slippery sidewalk as I pivoted on the spot into an alley and managed to shake off the murderous birds for only a few moments before their airborne agility allowed them to easily catch back up with me.

There was one idea that I could try, but I had no idea whether or not it would've worked, and what I needed in my life right then and there was just a little bit of certainty. I decided to take the risk anyway. There was no other choice; it was the closest place I could think of.

The church came into view as I turned a corner and smacked one of the ravens so hard that a sound like crunching paper came from its body as it tumbled toward the ground and went still. I had managed to outrun the storm that had started over my father's home; the dark, flashing clouds gathered above me had in fact been centred on the house, and not on me, or the book. I had no idea how the book was relevant, but I was sure it was. I didn't slow down as I crossed the street, and I may have even sped up a little bit as my goal drew closer with every step. Narrowly dodging a car or two didn't slow me down either as I slammed into the massive double doors of the haunting, pale building that stabbed up at the darkening sky with spires and towers that seemed fit for a castle. The dark wooden doors opened when I pushed hard on them, and I all but fell inside before scrambling to my feet and leaving the book on the marble floor to slam the doors shut behind me and lock the ravens outside.

I leaned against the door and slid down to sit with my back against the cold, hard wooden barrier between myself and the flock of ravens outside. My shoes slipped and screeched on the smooth floor of the church as a puddle of rain water gathered beneath me. As that puddle grew out from the floor beneath me as my soaked clothes dripped onto the marble, the swell of water warped itself around the book that I had dropped on the floor, the puddle grew *around* the book so that the tome would not get wet. Before, I had thought the book was simply waterproof, and so I'd had the ability to ignore it. As I sat and stared at the book, watching as the water flowed out from under me in every direction and flowed *around* the book and *only* the book, my theory that the book was somehow relevant to everything that had happened at the house started to solidify as fact in my mind.

A booming, drawling voice — it wasn't deep, but it did hold a resonance that helped it carry — rang out in the silence that had blanketed the inside of the church since my arrival. "It seems the Lord has sent us a guest."

Looking around, I don't know what I had expected, but the church looked unlike anything I had anticipated. The first thing that surprised me was that it was occupied. The central nave lined with pews was packed with dozens of people of all ages, some of which clustered together as the younger ones shied away from my dishevelled self as if sheltering family from a danger. Those dozens upon dozens of people were lit up by rays of multicoloured light, beams filtered through the stained glass that warped the sunlight that hit them; the storm had not yet reached this place. At the far end of the hall, the sanctuary with its altar loomed above and apart from those who had gathered together in prayer before my entrance. The lectern upon the altar held a Bible that laid open as a lector stared at me from all the way across the church. Behind that lector, the massive crucifix bearing the depiction of Jesus Christ towered over everyone, and Christ seemed to stare down at me in particular. It made me feel small and vulnerable despite my victory over the ravens.

"Sorry, everyone," I stammered. I stood and clutched the book to my chest since I didn't have to worry about it getting wet. "Didn't mean to interrupt, I promise, I just needed to … get out of the rain." I gestured vaguely to my drenched self and hoped they wouldn't ask me to elaborate and come up with a lie.

"That's alright, friend," the lector said, holding his arms out in what looked like an attempt to calm the congregation. "We are welcoming of all who seek shelter from misfortune."

A small shape passed over one of the stained glass windows, fluttering by and casting a long shadow over the pews before it was gone in an instant. I stared at the window as the relief that had washed over me dried up just as fast as that shape moved. Shifting on my feet brought another squealing whine from my soaked shoes, and made me wince. I went and sat on one of the pews closest to the entrance that was empty; I didn't want to bother anyone with a puddle. My wet clothes made too much sound for my liking when I moved, and the staring didn't bring me any more comfort. If it was a miracle that I hadn't gotten sick after exposing myself to the elements last night, I was tempting fate doing it again just seven or so hours later.

The lector continued his speaking when I was seated. "For there is hope of a tree, if it be cut down, that it will sprout again, and that the tender branch thereof will not cease. Though the root thereof wax old in the earth, and the stock thereof die in the ground; yet through the scent of water it will bud, and bring forth boughs like a plant. But man dieth, and wasteth away: yea, man giveth up the ghost, and where is he? As the waters fail from the sea, and the flood decayeth and drieth up: So man lieth down, and riseth not: Till the heavens be no more, they shall not awake, nor be raised out of their sleep. O that thou wouldest hide me in the grave, that thou wouldest keep me secret, until thy wrath be past, that thou wouldest appoint me a set time, and remember me! If a man die, shall he live again? All the days of my appointed time will I wait, till my change come."

Two minutes could have passed as I sat and listened, or perhaps two hours. The lector's words were eventually drowned out in my mind, and perhaps my mind only, by the low, raspy croak of a calling raven that just barely penetrated through the closed windows. I stared at the window that had briefly been thrown into shadow by a passing shape in the air. That distant call made my blood run cold, and my hands tightened around the book as I peered down at it and was tempted to finally look inside. Before I could look, though, I flinched as an impact rattled one of the stained glass windows with an immense BANG. The congregation stared as a black shape fell from the window, causing shadows to shift along them, and I stood when I realised what was happening.

The lector said, "Well, that was certainly surprising," in what must have been an attempt to soothe the people, but they began to murmur among themselves anxiously. Another impact, this time on the other side of the building, slammed against the stained glass and caused another fright among the churchgoers. A third raven flattened itself against another window, and another, and another, until the stained glass began to crack and chip. My entire body throbbed in time with the pulse of the book, in time with the impacts hammering at the windows. Over the panicking congregation, I met the lector's eyes, and his face tightened as his faze fell on me and shifted down to the book that, despite its pulsing charge, was still as cold as it had ever been. I began to understand that none of my body heat transferred to the thick tome despite the length of time that I had held it in my hands.

A surge of black feathers broke through the stained glass, dark raven's blood splattering across the congregation's faces and backs as they flinched away from the scattering glass that sent flashes of every colour imaginable across the church. The waves of black poured into the building like a liquid and flowed through the air, but not toward me, even as I staggered back and fell over as I tipped over the pew. The flock of ravens filled the air above the pews and altar, and the lector shouted, "Please stay calm, friends! You may evacuate through the front doors!" The congregation all moved as one mass, flooding the aisle between the rows of pews and sprinting forth to escape the black-winged invasion of their holy place.

The ravens dove, but not at any person. They swarmed around the crucifix, the depiction of Jesus Christ, croaking and crying their sickening calls as they assaulted the symbol of divinity looming over me. The dark attackers clawed the son of God's eyes out, and scratched at his hands and feet, and pecked holes into his sides. Stigmata, the legendary, Biblical wounds suffered by Christ, had been inflicted upon his image once again. I had never been a devout man, my mother had not raised me to believe in any one thing and now that I'm thinking about it, I don't know what my father believed. That no longer mattered. A terror like none I had ever experienced before, dread colder than the worst winter and panic hotter than even the sun, streaked through me in a lightning strike of fear.

That lector, I regret never learning his name, gathered up a broom and attempted to dissuade the ravens from attacking the symbol of his faith, and paid the price. The few birds he managed to strike with the length of his broom swerved in the air and dove at him, and the arms he threw up to defend himself were not enough. I started forward for a few steps before freezing abruptly as goosebumps erupted along my arms at the sight of what those foul corvids did to that poor man. Nausea threatens to rob me of the contents of my stomach even thinking about it now. By the end of it, the lector who had welcomed me into his place of worship was an eyeless mess of blood running down his face, which was frozen in the terror that had taken him in his final moments; his hands were pierced right through the palms, and his shoes had been torn apart and the soles of his feet had been punched through as well. The sides of his torso had been penetrated by those razor beaks and forced wide enough for his innards to spill out onto the altar he collapsed upon.

The lector screamed as he writhed in pain from suffering through the wounds as his lord had two thousand years ago, through which that lord's depiction had been destroyed anew just moments ago, as I would be destroyed if I stayed. With tears in my eyes — I had never seen a person die before — I turned and ran out the doors with everyone else. The sunlight outside blinded me for a moment, just long enough for me to run head-first into a person and stagger back with an apology. As my eyes adjusted, I kept on running, my frantic eyes scanning everything around me in my panic. A hundred ravens or more circled above the church as the ones inside defaced the image of Christ and ate away at the lector. The pulsing of the book beat in time with the rhythm of my sprint down the street toward home. The fatigue of sleep-deprivation and bodily exhaustion was beginning to catch up with me, and my staggering gait was slow and sluggish, but enough to take me away from the ravens, who for some foul reason seemed more interested in the church than myself. For now.

The black, oily smoke pouring into the sky in a thin, faint plume was distant and faded by that time, but I could pinpoint my position in the city relative to my father's old house using it as a north star. Firefighters must have arrived to the scene and tamed the blaze by now, but there was no way that I was going to go back there. Home. That was the only place I had left. That would, however, put Adam, the only *person* I had left, in danger if the ravens followed me there. My mind screamed questions at me as my body simply moved without conscious input. Where to go? What to do? Who to trust with this? What even was this? Why was this happening to me? Was it the book? How was my father connected to this? Why now? I had no answers for any of it. There was one thing I knew for certain, though; I needed rest, and to rest, I needed to go home.

As soon as I exploded into our shared apartment, Adam, who'd been sitting on the couch watching a movie, shouted in outrage. He went to say something if the look in his eye as I violently locked the front door told me anything, but he seemed to realise something at the last second and abandoned his complaint. "Why are you drenched?" he asked as I marched across our living room.

"I'll explain," I promised as I gently laid the black-and-silver book, the ancient tome that was my only real material inheritance from my father, on the coffee table. "First, help me make sure all the windows are closed."

Adam stared at me like I was crazy. I certainly *felt* crazy. "Why?"

"Just do it!" I roared, and I must have looked even crazier for it, because he immediately complied.

As we went around our apartment and ensured that all the windows were shut and locked where that was possible, I calmed down a little bit. The ravens could have broken the glass if they had really wanted to get in, but that was what I could do in the moment to secure our home against the corvid stalkers, and it helped me feel better. After that, I collapsed onto the sofa despite Adam's complaints about my half-dry clothes and breathlessly told him the story of my day so far. He seemed to think I was joking when I told of what had happened at my father's old house, but when I told of what had occurred at the church and we moments later heard sirens racing down the street outside in the direction of said church, Adam's face paled and he began pacing nervously.

"Assuming I believe you," he said with a incredulous scoff, "what do we even do now?"

"I don't know," I said hoarsely. My voice was totally drained of emotion after all I'd been through during the nine hours since learning of my father's death at three o'clock that morning. My eyes never left the book as I talked, its cover of leathery midnight and its gilding of heavenly silver, arranged in that image of the eye within the loop of a noose. What in the world *was* it? "I don't know." I spoke more to myself than to Adam then.

I really did not know anything. About the book, about what had happened that day, and about my father, if his house was where all this had begun. It was becoming clear to me as the day went on that I may not have really known my father. That had always been obvious, we'd never been close because of his work; his investigative career had taken him across the country, everywhere except home, where my mother had fulfilled his true duty for him before her unexpected death over a decade ago. Why had my father had this book in his basement? Because I was sure the book had somehow *caused* everything with the storm and the ravens and the basement collapsing in on itself, how had it done that? What had those dark markings on my father's pale, dead flesh been?

I knew nothing. I didn't intend to stay ignorant, though. Looking up at Adam, the book between us on the table as I sat and he paced, I caught his attention with a sigh and asked him the question that changed our lives forever, and not for the better. I wish I hadn't, but I did. Because I did, what happened after that between us was and continues to be my fault. I acknowledge that now. However, in that moment, none of that mattered. I simply wanted a friend by my side as I navigated this frightening, unbelievable, insane time in my life. I didn't have my father to rely on anymore — if I ever had in the first place — and Adam was the only person in the world that I could trust with this. So I asked him. I asked, and doomed us both to what would come next.

"Do you believe in magic?"
