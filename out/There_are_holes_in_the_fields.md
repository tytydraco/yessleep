It's raining, as it is most days. I usually like the rain, like to watch the wind carry the little raindrops from side to side. I like the soft sounds of it hitting the windows and the roof. 

But while I'm driving on the highway, rain is nothing but a nuisance. It's a long way to my grandpa's house and I just started my journey an hour ago. With my luck, I'm sure I'll be travelling through the storm for at least another hour. 

I wonder if it still looks the same. The old lighthouse I mean. Grandpa was a lighthouse keeper all his life. He took a lot of pride in his job. I remember when he taught me and my little brother all about his duties when we spent the summer breaks with him.

We watched him maintain and repair the lights every time. We used to visit him a lot. I haven't seen grandpa for almost ten years now and sadly, I won't ever see him again.

Maintaining the lighthouse is essential for the safety of the ships and they couldn't find a new permanent lighthouse keeper on short notice. I don't mind helping out. I miss the summers me and Josh spent playing in the fields and on the beach. Good memories.

The feeling of being a kid and having such vast grasslands all for yourself is incomparable to anything else. We could run forever in whichever direction we wanted and still always find our way home. The lighthouse was always there on the horizon. Grandpa was always waiting in his little house next to it.

We haven't visited anymore since Josh found the hole. 

We were playing catch on a sunny day in July. There was no wind and not a cloud in the sky. He tried to escape me as he suddenly stopped mid run. I almost pushed him over when I caught him. 

"Gotcha!", I laughed.

He didn't respond, just stared at the ground in front of him.

"Millie, what is that?", he pointed at a perfectly circular hole in the grass in front of him. About thirty centimetres in diameter. Its walls looked as clean cut as a hole punched through paper. 

My smile faded. I kneeled down to get a closer look. Moving my head over the abyss was dizzying.

"I don't know. It looks deep though. We should.." 

I was interrupted by grandpa calling us back for dinner. I grabbed my brother's hand and we rushed back to the house.

We decided not to tell grandpa, fearing he wouldn't let us play in the fields if he knew. And after an evening of playing board games and telling stories, I didn't even think about the hole anymore.

That was until the next morning. 

Me and Josh were on our way to the beach, just down the cliff, as I spotted something wrong in my periphery. A brown spot that was supposed to be green.

Another hole.

It looked just like the first one, clean cut, perfectly round and leading into never ending depths. 

Josh sat down next to it.

"Do you think that belongs to an animal?", Josh asked, barely looking up.

"I don't think so. Animals wouldn't be digging straight down like that. And if it was an animal it must have been huge. That hole is as big as you" 

"Maybe a badger?" 

"Maybe… But we better leave it alone. I want to go to the beach now." 

I grabbed my little brother by the hand and we made our way down the wooden staircase along the cliff side and played pirates until the tide came and we had to return.

"Do you think there are more we haven't found yet?", Josh asked as we climbed the last steps and the lighthouse came back into view.

"More what?" 

"More holes!" 

"I don't know. They're not very interesting after all" 

"I think they're cool." 

I was fascinated as well but didn't want Josh to know that. He shouldn't be getting stupid ideas and fall into one or something. I stayed silent.

"Millie, I want to find out how deep they are!"

I sighed.

"Only if you promise not to tell grandpa" 

He smiled and made a cross gesture in front of his chest. After supper we snuck an old rope and an oil lantern from the shed and made our way to the first hole we found.

To our surprise, we saw quite a few more on the way there. All far apart, all the same precision and size.

We kneeled down across from each other. Josh stretched out his hands for me to give him the rope.

"Uh uh, that's way too heavy for you. I'll do it"

He looked grumpy but nodded. 

I began tying one end of the rope to the lantern handle before lighting it. Josh watched with big eyes. I balanced the lantern over the hole and lowered it in slowly. Deeper and deeper, bit by bit. We watched as the light travelled downwards and got smaller until it was only a dot. 

By three quarters of the rope there was still no end in sight. The lantern was only a small speck of light in the vast darkness. Josh was bent over the entrance, curiously watching. 

Suddenly my hands slipped and I lost hold of the rope. It rushed down the hole, accelerating quickly. Josh decided to grab it. He immediately got pulled down with it. 

In a split second I managed to grab his legs. He was already to the waist in the ground. With all my strength I pulled him back towards me. I fell on my back, he rolled over me.

For a moment we just lay there in the grass, looking at the cloudless sky. My heart was racing like mad. When I saw his tiny head disappear in that hole, I thought I lost him. I never felt fear like that before. Not that I could remember at least. As I managed to catch my breath again he was already up. 

He stared at the hole with such empty eyes. He must be traumatised, I thought.

I pushed myself up from the ground and stood on shaking legs. I needed to look brave for him now, I thought, even though I wasn't less of a child. I took Josh's hand and we walked back to the house. 

We barely talked during dinner. Grandpa was worried, seeing us like that. We didn't tell him what happened so he didn't know what to do about it. I couldn't blame him. 

That night I had strange dreams. Of places I had never seen. Just flashing images, gone too fast to make any sense of. And of Josh, screaming my name as he fell into deep nothingness. Again and again. I woke up to his face in front of mine. 

"Josh?", I rubbed my eyes. Hoping they would adjust to the darkness. Darkness. It was still night. Josh was standing in front of my bed. 

"Why are you up?" 

I looked him up and down. His pyjamas looked wet, there was mud on his knees.

"I have to show you something", he whispered with a peaceful grin.

"Have you been outside? Go to sleep, you can show me tomorrow", I said rolling over.

"Ok" he whispered. I listened to his footsteps on the floor and the creaking of his guest bed. Good, he's back in bed.

He wasn't when grandpa came in to wake us the next morning. Neither of us heard him leave so we immediately started searching. Grandpa started looking through the lighthouse, I ran outside to the grass fields. 

It didn't take me long to find him. There was a new hole behind the shed. Josh was sitting still, just staring inside. I rushed towards him and pulled him away.

"You bloody idiot! What are you doing? Do you wanna fall in again?" I was on the verge of crying, just thinking about yesterday.

Josh was so calm, it was unnerving.

"I'm just listening, that's what I wanted to show you."

"What are you talking about?" I started to calm down a little. The immediate danger was over but there was still so much frustration for his carelessness. 

"You gotta listen to the hole", he smiled softly. His expression felt oddly soothing.

We both looked towards the circular hole in the ground. 

"That's bullshit. Don't go close to it. I swear, grandpa will lock us in for the whole rest of the summer if he finds out!" I pulled on his arm. He resisted.

"Just try it once. Please, Millie. You have to hear it", he pleaded.

I don't know why, I truly can't explain it, but at that moment the urge to check if he was right was too much to ignore. He said it with such conviction, something I wasn't used to seeing in my little brother. 

So I did what he said. I kneeled down and held my head over the opening in the ground. It was silent.

"You gotta go closer.", he whispered.

I tilted my head and lay down on the wet grass. I took a deep breath, concentrated. Nothing for a long time, then I heard it. I couldn't tell what it was at first. It wasn't words. More like a melody. A melody that contained a message, one that I couldn't quite understand. It was so quiet, so subtle. I wasn't even sure if I really heard it or just imagined it. It was the softest little music. An ancient language. Barely audible. It tied me to the ground. The grass felt so much softer than before. My fear had vanished almost completely. I forgot the world around me existed.

"Can you hear it?"

Josh's voice ripped me out of my trance. I got back up.

"Don't tell grandpa", was all I could muster to say. We left the hole, but the feeling stayed. The melody kept repeating in my head and I didn't want it to stop.

I started visiting the holes with Josh every day. There were so many by then. A new one seemed to appear every time we checked. We wondered how grandpa never noticed. Josh and I spent whole days just listening to their stories, although I never understood a word. It became a beautiful routine. We didn't realise how time passed. We didn't feel hunger or the need to go home, but of course, we always did. 

In the evenings, when we were alone in the guest room, we discussed them. We tried to describe the experience, but soon realised, that words could never suffice. Josh seemed closer to them than me. He understood meanings where I only heard songs. He told me what the holes whisper. He couldn't remember their wording, but he gave his best to describe their meaning. 

And at night, we dreamed of them. They showed us places. Strange places we had never seen. Beautiful forests, vibrant beaches, lakes that reflected rainbow coloured lights. I only remembered single pictures of those dreams. Josh remembered far more than that. He said those were the places the holes were talking about.

The holes grew more every day and so did our longing for them. I wanted to dream of them again and again. I was never able to remember enough of those dreams. I was starving for more. I wanted to listen to their melodies forever. I can't remember a single one of them now.

Josh tried to draw the places with crayons for me, so I wouldn't forget. He got so frustrated because they never looked quite right. Of course they didn't. How should a drawing capture something as beautiful as paradise? 

He said he wanted to find the lake. That we would go there when we were older. I loved that idea.

That summer was a strange but beautiful dream. It was until Josh disappeared.

The sky was grey. Dark clouds gathered above the lighthouse. It was going to rain. 

When he wasn't in his bed that day, I thought I would find him sitting at the holes as usual, but he wasn't there. The holes weren't either. All patched up like they never existed. 

We searched for hours until mom picked me up and we drove home. The police were still there when we left. Mom told me, they stayed for weeks. It was a horrible time of uncertainty.

After two months they gave up. They never found him. The official theory was that he fell into the ocean and got carried away. Many didn't believe that. There was always some suspicion on grandpa. I wasn't allowed to visit him any more. 

I always remember his face as we drove away. I could tell he blamed only himself. That was the last time I saw him before he died. I could never tell him that I knew he was innocent. I always knew where Josh was. I still see him every now and then when I dream of the lake, the forest and the vibrant beach. He made it and once I make it through this horrible storm, once I'm back at the lighthouse, I will finally see him again.
