I want to thank everyone who gave me suggestions on how to die – and more importantly, how to stay dead – in my last post.

[If you don't remember me,](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/zalgdo/every_time_i_die_the_world_comes_back_a_little/) I’m the girl who had a lot of fun dying until it stopped being so fun and started becoming terrifying. With every death, the universe became a little clearer to me, and now, while I have a few interesting abilities – like the power to take a sip of apple juice and tell you exactly which tree the apples grew on – I can’t enjoy any of it.

How can I?

Each moment is a sensory nightmare. Every waking moment of every day, the sound of hoarse screaming and demented laughter clogs my ears. Bitterness and rot fill my nostrils, and everywhere I look – god, *everywhere* I look – I see *Them.* Tangled, demonic-looking creatures the color of television static. Creatures that are watching me. Stalking Me. Waiting for Me. Waiting for what? I’m not sure. But I sure as hell don’t want to find out. And that’s why this time when I die, I need to stay dead.

So, starting today, I’m going to keep a log of all the different ways I’ll be attempting to die. Of course, a log will be futile to me if I do succeed, but if anyone else out there is like me – bless your wretched soul – then perhaps it will be of use to you…

Before I start, I will add that before attempting any of the proposed solutions, I did attempt to track down the person who originally killed me, but it ended up being a lot harder than I thought it would be. My town isn’t New York City or Los Angeles big, but it’s sizable enough that after roaming the streets for days in my little VW bug, I was still at square one. I even checked in at all the local truck stops. Although, to be fair, I wasn’t coasting off a lot of information. The conversations mostly went something like this:

“Name of driver?”

“No idea.”

“Appearance?”

“Blurry. But I think white? Maybe? But like, tanned white. And brown hair. Or maybe sandy blond. Well, he had hair in any case. Unless it was a wig.”

“Right. Plate number?”

“I barely remember if the dude had hair, and you think I remember a license plate?”

At that point in the conversation, whatever underpaid, overworked cashier manning the gas station would start to get upset. A few of them thought I was playing a practical joke on them for YouTube views, and the less jaded ones just thought I was delusional. I’m pretty sure I confirmed that belief at the last gas station, when, in a moment of weakness, I finally snapped at the annoyed cashier and told him that while I might not remember petty details like plate numbers or truck models, I definitely remember the sensation of metal slicing through my ribcage and piercing my lungs.

The cashier kicked me out after that, and I decided to give up on that side of the equation altogether.

And that leads us to now – I have a pen in hand, a letter titled ‘POST TO MY ACCOUNT IN CASE OF DEATH’, and a hopeful smile on my face. And since I’m dying to get dying, let’s dive in.

Death 101: Burn Her Like a Witch

12/1/2022 – 6:30 PM

Technically, someone suggested I cremate myself, but it’s quite hard to find a mortician willing to do this to someone who is alive – I guess old habits are hard to break. But that’s okay. I’m just going to soak my house in gasoline, smoke a Newport to calm myself, and then flick some of the ashes onto the ground. You know, the old-fashioned way to set yourself on fire. Simple enough, right? Okay! Let’s do this.

Hello darkness my old friend…sigh. I really wanted that one to work. But honestly, it was a little less painful than I expected. Still really fucking painful, don’t get me wrong – but I think that was user error more than anything else. The first sixty seconds were hellish, but after I exhaled enough smoke, I passed out from lack of oxygen, and from there it was just your standard death via suffocation. And honestly, the red-hot flames licking up my calves and melting through my epidermis wasn’t even the worst bit. No. The worst part was the way *They* laughed at me as I burned. They don’t have mouths like we do – don’t have expressions like we do, either – but I can always tell when they’re laughing. They make this high-pitched keening noise, like a rabbit bleeding out in an alleyway. Disturbing pieces of shit.

Death 102: The Killing Joke

12/4/2022: 11:30 PM

Seeing how difficult it was to find a crematorium, I thought finding a vat of acid to dissolve my entire body in would be equally hard. But after doing a little research online, I realized that acid is a lot more common than you’d think. I thought about pouring a cocktail of chemicals into my bathtub, but after the fire incident, I decided I wanted to treat myself a little, instead. I read some horrific tales online about people falling into acidic hot springs, so I used my credit card to book a first-class ticket to a national park that I had always wanted to visit, along with a one-night stay in a luxury hotel – *They* though it was very luxurious, too. The money, of course, will all reset like everything else does once I die. And if it doesn’t reset, I won’t have to worry about that – or anything else – ever again.

Welp. Time to take a bath, I suppose…

Shit, that hurt!! Jesus. It was like going to get a Korean body scrub if the gloves were made of chicken wire and if the water they poured over you was battery acid. Which would have been fine, except for the fact that I’m still fucking here! Sorry. I don’t mean to sound heated…it’s just, someone said that acid would destroy me on a molecular level, and that sounded really smart and like maybe it would actually make a difference and I guess I just…well, I guess I just let myself hope.

And instead, all I got was a whole lot of pain and a little bit more clarity. When I woke up this morning, those *things* were already gathered on the foot of my bed, waiting for me. I always thought they didn’t have expressions, but now I’m starting to realize they do. And I don’t like that. Not one bit.

Death 103: Jesus Take the Wheel

Although no one suggested another car accident, part of me wonders if dying in a second car accident will somehow complete the cycle or something. I don’t know. It sounds improbable, but I’ll try anything once. Or, twice now, I guess. But at least I’ve learned from my previous deaths. This time, I’m popping a handful of Ibuprofens before I get behind the wheel and –

I’m sorry that I stopped the log mid-sentence like that. But I’m putting the Death Records to rest for now. I have to. Because, as I was writing that, someone knocked on my door. No. Not knocked. Someone pounded on my door – so hard that the entire frame shook. For a moment, I actually thought Death 103 was going to be via violent home invasion.

And honestly, I was fine with that. I haven’t been murdered in that way before, so might as well add it to the log, right? Only, when I swung open the door, it wasn’t a robber or a murderer or a Jehovah’s Witness at the door.

Instead, it was a tall man with light brown hair and a desperate expression in his eyes. An expression that I recognized clearly, intimately. An expression I saw reflected back at me every time I glanced in a mirror.

Without a word, the man stepped into my apartment, and shut the door behind him.

“You,” he said, his voice gruff. “Are you the one who’s been looking for me? Are you...." He cleared his throat. "Are you the one I killed?"
