 I had the most disturbing night of my life last night. I am sitting here writing this and not sure what I should do. 

The day started out relatively normal. I was working my normal shift at Krispy Kreme. Our location was a 24 hour a day operation and my typical shift is from 4pm to 2am. A weird shift, but it allowed me to have the day to myself and most of the clients I dealt with were a bunch of burnouts and rowdy college kids.  

Last night started out normal enough. Food prep, cleaning, and taking sporadic orders through the drive-thru and online. Things started going sideways at around 1am. A car pulled up to the speaker and my headset pinged to let me know someone was there.

:Ping:

“Welcome to Krispy Kreme! Can I interest you in our Valentine’s Day Strawberry Dream donut?” I asked through my headset with a sardonic smile.

I was waiting for my eardrums to get wrecked when the person order inevitably started screaming at the microphone, but no one replied.

“Hello, are you ready to place your order or do you need a few moments?” I asked.

:Static:

It was not that odd that people pull-up and abruptly pull away without speaking to us but this was not the case. Last year, there were a string of robberies in the area so the crew petitioned management to get cc cameras put up, so we see who is pulling up. The car, an immaculate Buick Roadmaster, was just idling. From my angle, I could see there was a man, a woman, and at least one child in the back seat. 

“Hello Sir, I am ready to take your order whenever you are ready. Just let me know whenever you are ready.” I said through the headset and continued with my other duties.

About 3 minutes went by and the car was still sitting at the menu. The husband and wife just sat there staring, and smiling, almost painfully so, but instead of staring forward or at the menu they were staring at the camera, straight at me.

The man was wearing a crisp blue suit and a matching fedora. The woman had a 1950s poodle cut hairstyle, and a pink frock from what I could see. Due the time of day and shadowing I was unable to see the child.

I called back to my co-worker Fred to have him come look at this but I guessed he was in the bathroom because he didn’t respond.

“Excuse me Sir, Ma’am, is there something I can suggest for you today? We really need to keep the line moving.” I said shakily through the headset.

I knew for a fact there was no one behind them but I really wanted them gone.

In a jerking movement he turned his head to the speaker and finally responded.

“He-llo.” He said in a monotone almost robotic tone.

“Hello, can I take your order?” I asked again.

“He-llo. Fi-ne ni-ght we are hav-ing would-n’t you-u say?”

It was kind of dreary, cold, and rained off and on the entire evening, but whatever got them out of my life.

“Yes, sir. How can I help you?”

“My go-od-ne-ss what ni-ce man-ners you-u ha-have son.”

“Thank you, Sir. What can I get started for you today?”

“We-e are cele-bra-ting to-night. We-e are cele-bra-ting ou-r new son Bob-by. We-e wa-nt-ed to ha-ve a spe-cial tre-e-at.”

“That is really great. Babies are always a celebration. I tell you what tell me what three treats I can get you, your wife, and it will be on me.”

“Tha-nk you-u Ted-dy.”

I never gave these people my name. I don’t even have my real name on my nametag. It says Steve. I just don’t like people having my real name.

“Do I know you? How do you know my name?”

“You-u do not know us, but we know you-u Ted-dy.”

Okay this shit was getting out of hand. I needed these creepy fuckers out of my line and out of my life, like yesterday!

“Okay just pull forward I will throw some items together for you. Just please move forward.”

I threw together a bag of literally every item that would fit in a bag as fast as possible and included two boxes of assorted donuts I had previously prepared for good measure. I opened the drive-thru window and balanced it all on the ledge. I promptly shut and locked window as the vintage car came leisurely up to the window.

As the items were lifted down and away from the window I was mortified to see the man and woman smiling at me. I was correct when I saw them from the cameras. They were wearing clothes just as vintage in style as their vehicle, but what was haunting was their skin, hair, and eyes. It all had the sheen you would see on a wax scupture. It was all shiny and completely artificial in appearance. Their eyes were vacant when they looked at me, and their rictus grins never faltered.

I was completely taken aback, and I knew that whatever these things were they were not human. The woman leaned over the man and started to speak to me through the glass. Like her husband, she had a similar tone. It was when she started to speak I noticed in horror that her mouth never opened. She was speaking through her manic smile.

“Tha-nk you-u Ted-dy. Bob-by will lo-ove the-ese.” She said. “We-e were ho-ping to find Bob-by a bro-ther to-night as a tre-eat but what gro-wing boy does not like swe-ets. M-m-m-m. Yum-my Yum-my in my Tum-my. Ha-ha-ha-ha.”

She abruptly snapped forward and stared out the window.

“Tha-nk you-u a-gain Ted-dy. Ha-ave a won-der-ful ni-ght.”

With that, he too snapped forward. As the car started to pull away from my window, the radio started playing. I started to sigh in relief until I saw the boy in the back window. He was not like his new mother and father. He was a normal young boy. He was crying and beating on the window of the car. He mouthed “Help Me. Help Me.” I opened the window and stuck my head out. I watched him frantically begging for help until the car was lost to distance and all I could hear was the sound of rain and the light echo of Earth Angel in the night.
