Two days ago , I was chilling with my younger cousin . I'm 13 and hes 7 . For personal reasons , I'll be using our  first name initials . Call me Z and him Q .

So we're lying on the bed , scrolling through Tiktok when all of a sudden I felt this presence . Like , that feeling you get when someone's watching you and you KNOW it . I look around frantically yet I tried to keep my cool , as to not alarm my cousin . Spotting nothing , I closed my eyes and inhaled deeply . Deep breaths , Z .

" Oooohhhh ! Z look ! That Mr has a frog face ! " Beamed Q excitedly . I looked towards my phone , but nothing was related to frogs or yet a frog face . Me  , being as scared as I am retorted rather rudely . " Q , stop talking nonsense or else we wont watch Tiktok anymore . " 

Being a 7 year old that hated being told no , he kept on whining , and my fear grew .

" But Z ! Just look ! Hes by the curtain ! " He pointed towards the left curtain . I could hear the wind softly brushing against the material , swaying it from side to side .

Giving in to his whining , and pushing myself to be confident , I looked at the curtain , but to my relief , saw nothing . 

" Oh . Hes gone now . " Q muttered in a sad tone . I brushed it off as an imaginary friend and carried on watching Tiktok .

However , Q wasnt one to have imaginary friends . 

The next day I was plagued with the thoughts of this ' Mr FrogFace ' . Was he real ? Was Q hallucinating ? Was there a ghost in our house ? Was there a frog monster who happened to look like a gentleman ? 

I couldnt bring myself to answer any of those , but a frog in a top hat is quite an interesting imagery . 

I was snapped away from my overthinking by my mother . She asked what's wrong and I explained to her in brief detail on what Q said . She laughed at me and said " Dont go out of your way to make fun of your cousin , its pathetic " 

Pathetic ? You're calling my anxiety PATHETIC ? Pff , for a mother you're pathetic .

Angry , I stormed off to my room , finding Q once again there , staring at the curtain . 

" Q what are you doing ? " I asked with unease , my body tensed as I looked at the boy . He turned around , a small smile on his face . " I was just talking to Mr FrogFace ! " He beamed with such innocence of a child , the sun baby from Teletubbies would be absolutely jealous .  

" Q....Mr FrogFace isnt real . " i said sternly , my anxiety once kicking in . 

" Yes he is ! Close one of your eyes and you will see him !! " He pouted and pointed towards the curtain . 

Groaning with annoyance , I complied and guess what I saw ?

Nothing . 

" Q , stop making things up " I growled , getting fed up wih his nonsense .

" I'm not !! " He turned around to look at the curtain once more , a soft ' oh ' emitting from his high pitched voice . 

" Z , hes looking at you now ! " Q looked at me again , hopeful for a more convinced reply . 

In that moment , I saw a slimy black arm-like limb crawl out from underneath the curtain , grabbing Q's foot and dragging him under said curtain .

I watched .

I watched as he screamed .

I watched as the tears streamed down his face .

I....couldnt move . 

My body was as still as a rock . My anxiety was through the roof . My eyes were flooded with hot , salty tears . My brain begged my body to move . My body wouldnt listen .

A loud thud brought my consciousness back , and there he was . Q was lying on the floor , his face had a horrific expression , but ...

Where was the rest of his body...? 

My breathing quickened and that's when I saw it . It slithered from under the curtain , reaching a height for atleast 9 feet. It's back was arched . It's teeth were bared . It's eyes were glowing in the now dark room . Its face resembled a frog .

A black substance dripped from all parts of its body . Tilting its head , it formed the creepiest grin . A grin intent on murder . It licked its lips , the remaining blood of Q still scattered across his horrifying features as it made eye contact with me .

It lunged at me , and at that moment I was already aware that I needed to go. NOW . 

I ran downstairs as fast as my long legs would take me , bumping into my mother , my aunt next to her . 

" Mom please ! We have to leave now ! Q's dead and t-that THING killed h-him !! " My words were fumbled , my body was shaking . 

" What the hell ? Calm down , say it slower " She said firmly , a genuine look of worry on her eyes . 

I closed my eyes and took a deep breathe , hearing sounds of struggle and choking not long after .

Mr FrogFace was on the staircase , Its elongated limbs grabbing my mother and aunt by their necks . 

I watched in horror as It completely devoured their flesh at an uncanny speed , their blood painting the rocky floor a beautiful but menacing red . 

I shouted as hard as I could . In that moment i just wanted to curl I'm into a ball and cry...but I couldnt . I had to do something .

With tears streaming down my face like a waterfall , I rushed out of the door , running as fast as i could . My breathing stopped for a bit and i looked around for any house that seemed to be friendly . 

I looked at the familiar white house with black accents adorning many crevices . Of course ! Aunt F was the most wise and supporting person ever ! 

I knocked on her door and a familiar face greeted me . I rambled on and on , breaking down as my sobs filled the quiet atmosphere . 

She welcomed me in , holding me tightly . I continued to sob in her arms , my body losing its feeling and my knees going weak . 

She led me to a guest room  and sat me down on the bed , patting my back . 

" I'll check up soon . Please get rest . "  She whispered and left me alone , closing the door behind her .

I lied sprawled out on the clean bed , looking at the lovely red curtains .

And with another thud , Aunt F's head dropped out from under the curtain .
