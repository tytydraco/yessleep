I don’t know why I was drawn to Trevor.

He wasn’t at all like the other guys I’d go after. Not that I ‘went after’ a lot of guys at the club. Anyone who goes to them can tell you that those herds are not the best pickings for a long-term partner.

No, I looked for men who could give me a night. Someone to get free drinks off of to keep me nice and buzzed. To hold me while we danced so that I could get thoroughly lost in the music instead of my thoughts. Means to an end, I suppose.

At the end of the night, I’d give them my number out of courtesy, then usually ghost. If I liked them enough, I’d let them take me back to their frat house or dorm. Sometimes sex. Sometimes not. Regardless, it was back at to the club the next night. Those boys who had already gone through the cycle and been spit out the other side would either see me again and know I wasn’t worth the trouble, or they wouldn’t remember me at all like I didn’t to them.

Yeah, a lot of the guys there were tools. Plenty of them were doing the same thing that I was every night. Still, some of them weren’t, and when I lay in bed some nights, now sober, I can’t help but think back on some of the more kind faces I so hastily pushed away.

Like I’ve said before, I’m not a great person.

In the small college town that I went to school in, there was a constant revolving cast of characters each semester. On weekends, the place to be was called The Warehouse. As the name suggested, it was a sizable building of sheet metal and girder beams that was once a storehouse for some company that went out of business. Once the college went up, a business owner saw potential and moved in, turning it into a dance club complete with pool tables and a massive bar. I’ll bet that first fall semester he made an absolute killing.

It was the last weekend of the term when I met Trevor. He stuck out to me because of how much he looked like he didn’t belong. While everyone was jumping and thrashing to the blaring music on the dance floor, I caught him through the crowd lingering on the edge of his group. They were near the wall, and he was using it to his advantage, leaning against it and hiding behind his bangs with a cider in his hand. Clearly, he’d been dragged out against his will.

I remember that I was already dancing with someone, but the longer the night went on, and the longer I saw him standing there, the more I was drawn to him. He wasn’t having a good time. He wasn’t dancing or really even touching the drink in his hand. I was watching someone drown among a sea of disorienting lights and gyrating bodies. By all accounts, he did not want to be there.

I think deep down, even though I was always putting out the contrary, part of me really didn’t want to be either. Maybe that’s why I made my way over.

At first I danced near and hung just a few feet away, seeing if he’d notice me. Needless to say, he definitely did. I’m not exactly subtle when I get drunk. He was too shy to make the first move, and while that might turn some people away, I thought he was cute, and compared to the bold personalities, he was an interesting change of pace.

Looking back, I hadn’t even considered in my drunken state that he wasn’t interested at all and was probably wondering why some whacked out weirdo was staring him down. Regardless, I barged over like a bull.

He finally lifted his head at my approach and offered me a polite smile when I flashed him one. I leaned against the wall next to him and leaned close, calling over the music, “Alright; what’s the deal?”

He gave me a confused look, then leaned close to me, “I’m sorry?”

“What’s the deal?”

The fear on his face was a little amusing. He was so out of his element.

“I-I’m sorry, did I do something? I didn’t mean to offend—”

I rolled my eyes and nudged him with my shoulder, giving him a chuckle that I could tell eased his worries, “No, I mean why are you being such a Debby downer over here by yourself? You know you’re supposed to come to the dance club to *dance* right? Or at least play pool or something.”

The ice broke away, and he gave me a smile, “Look, I showed up. That’s all I was asked to do, and that’s all they’re gonna get out of me.”

“Not your scene, huh?”

“Not quite. I prefer a more laid back night.”

“Yeah? Laid back how?”

He shrugged, “I don’t know—Anywhere that I can actually *hear* the pretty girl I’m talking to.”

That one caught me off guard, and my eyebrows actually raised in surprise. I was not expecting the shy wallflower to come out flirting like that. It was a little cheesy, but still, it was sweet.

“Pretty, huh? That *cider* hitting you a little hard?” I teased.

At my abrasiveness, he pushed back with a smirk, “Bold to assume I meant you.”

“Well, I *am* the only girl you’ve talked to the whole night, so…”

“So you’ve been watching me? That’s a little weird, stranger.”

“Hensley,” I told him, holding my drink out.

He tapped his cider to it and smiled, “I’m Trevor.”

“There. No longer strangers.” I said before taking a drink.

The harsh straight vodka stung the back of my throat before settling into my gut. I was several in by that point, and was already more than a little drunk. A frazzled mess, undoubtedly, and I’m sure I reeked of liquor and perfume to him, but if it was a red flag, he didn’t show unease.

“So, Trevor, if this isn’t your scene, what is?”

He shrugged, “Bonfires, smaller bars to just chill in. stargazing. I like being around people just… not this many at one time.”

That last one caught my attention, “Stargazing, huh?”

“Oh yeah,” he smiled, wiggling a hand in the air mockingly, “Wild, I know. It’s nice, though. Just sitting with someone and talking. There are some deserts around here too where you can see some beautiful skies.”

“No, I think that’s cool. When I was young and couldn’t sleep, my mom would take me to the back balcony of our apartment and we’d look at the stars till I got tired. I have fond memories. Like you said, the talking; it was nice…”

“How about you? This your usual scene?” he asked.

After his heartfelt answer, I felt a little sheepish admitting that this was pretty much my only scene. If I wasn’t laying at home in bed doing homework or, most of the time, nothing at all, I was here so that I could thoroughly cloud my senses.

Still, I doubled down, “Pretty much. I like dancing and going out with people. Nothing like jumping and screaming at the top of your lungs to blow off the steam from the week.”

Trevor smiled, “I’m sure the liquor helps too.”

I guiltily raised my glass with a smile and pounded back the rest of my drink, to which he took another sip of cider. It was pretty clear that the gulp was going to hit me like a truck in a few minutes, but taking a note from every movie ever, he still asked, “Can I buy you another?”

I smiled and put a hand to my chest in faux shock, “Wow, you’d leave your wall for *me*?”

He snickered, “Well, you basically fell out of the sky while I was sitting here brooding. I know when to take a sign.”

Maybe it was the liquor, but the way his eyes fixed on me in that moment, and the way his lips curled into a warm, genuine smile… I don’t think I’d been looked at like that in a long time. For the life of me, I couldn’t figure out why. I’d really done nothing but tease him so far, and we’d only exchanged a few words. Maybe he somehow found me just as fascinating as I found him.

Whatever the deal was, for the first time in years, I didn’t feel the need to get more drunk. I wanted to be clear headed for whatever happened next.

“You know, I think I’m good on drinks,” I told him taking a step closer, “Tell you what though; Come dance for a bit and let me show you my scene for a while.” Feeling emboldened, I set my empty glass on a nearby ledge then took his hand, “Then, maybe later, you could show me yours? Show me some of those starry fields you were telling me about?”

I lowered my face a bit and stared past my lashes, my heart beating fast with nerves. Rarely had I made the first move like this. Trevor seemed scared out of his mind too, a cute little look of shock on his face. To my relief, it slowly turned into a smile.

“Yeah. Yeah, I think I could do that.”

I smiled back and began to move for the dance floor with him in tow, but before we could, one of his friends grabbed his shoulder. Trevor stopped and looked back, leaning close so that his friend could tell him something, but over the blaring music of the club, I couldn’t hear. Past the flashing lights and the swirl in my head, I thought the man looked vaguely familiar, but I couldn’t quite place it. Whatever he told Trevor, though, it caused him to turn back and give me a glance. He was sly about it, as if he didn’t want me to notice.

His hand didn’t leave mine while he pondered something, then he leaned back to his friend and spoke a couple words. His friend nodded, patted his back, then that was that.

“Everything okay?” I asked.

“Oh, yeah, he was just seeing where I was going.” Trevor said, smiling that smile again, “Alright, lead the way.”

We made our way onto the dance floor, and it was a nice change of pace dancing with someone I’d actually built some rapport with *before* leaving the club. We bounced and jammed out for a while, getting close at times, but nothing explicit. The most I think he felt comfortable with was holding my hips and swaying with me to a couple beats. For as witty and flirty as he was, he was still clearly a shy boy deep down.

Admittedly, I wasn’t having nearly as much fun with my usual hobbies that night as I had talking with the boy moments ago. Before long, my head cleared a bit of its haze, and I found myself wanting to go back to the wall where we’d began. A song ended, and I leaned close, my breath dusting his ear.

“Did you still want to show me your scene?”

He didn’t respond. He just pulled away, smiled at me, then taking my hand, we escaped the bar and ventured out into the starry night.

Now that I have parts of myself literally fragmented out into separate people, I’ve been thinking a lot about past moments. Who was in the driver’s seat at what given time when I did something stupid or when I was acting a certain way. The scary thing is, as I review most memories, I can only find Hope in fragments or slivers. Rarely do I feel that I embodied her unwavering optimism.

I’ve found myself starting to blame certain aspects of my life on my third clone now that I’ve met her. Since the dust settled, and I’ve gotten to see her colors outside of conflict, it’s clear that she’s the Yin to Hope’s Yang. She’s snippy, abrasive, blunt, and all the things about myself that I never liked, yet unfortunately embodied most of the time.

Still, she’s me, so I’ve been trying to be patient with her.

It’s hard though. The first thing that really tested my resolve was the name she chose to go by. It really set the tone going forward.

After we got her settled, Hope had asked her so sweetly what she wanted to be called, even putting her classic positive spin to it.

“—The good news is you get to go by anything you want,” she told her, “You’ve got the chance to finally change your name.”

“Why would I want to change my name?” Hen 3 asked, “Hensley *is* my name—the one that Mom and Dad gave me. Why can’t we both just be Hensley?”

God, watching Hope try to deal with his girl was like watching a comedian bomb their set on stage. She could not handle the heat.

“Because it’s confusing,” I jumped in, “what if we’re in a dire situation and Hope quickly needs to call for one of us? If she just yells ‘Hensley’, and we don’t know who she’s talking to, that split second of confusion could cost us everything.”

She scoffed at me in amusement then crossed her arms, “Then why don’t *you* go by something else? I have just as much a right to our name than you do.”

It was petty, and I know she had a point given that she technically *was* me, but I couldn’t stop myself, “Because I’m the original.”

I saw anger flash in her eyes, but she stayed cool about it, “That’s dumb. Just because we came out of you doesn’t mean we aren’t you. We have all your thoughts, memories, and experiences; philosophically, that makes me *you.*”

I snickered incredulously, “*Philosophically* huh? So now we’re intellectuals?”

“Hey, cut it out!” Hope jumped in, “I get it, it’s annoying,” She addressed to Hen 3, before pivoting between both of us, “But we have way bigger fish to fry here than nicknames. That beast isn’t going to care what we’re called when it’s chomping us down, so can we just figure something out without fighting, please?”

Hope’s sudden sternness honestly surprised me, and I think it did with #3 as well. Me and my anti-self looked at one another, and for the first time, I saw actual remorse in her eyes. I knew what she was feeling cause I’d been her so many times before. Remorse for being an ass.

“If you really don’t want to go by anything else, then I guess we can just have you go by Hensley, and you by Hen.” she said, pointing to me.

“No, it’s fine,” Hensley said, chewing her cheek and looking to the floor with a scowl, “I’ll go by Ann.”

A lump formed in my throat, and Hope and I looked at one another. I could tell she saw that I didn’t like that, and though I knew she was uncomfortable with it too, she wasn’t showing it as much as I was. Still, she took one for the team and prodded into it softly.

“Um… but, that’s Mom’s name.”

Ann looked up, “Yeah? And? I chose a name; is that one forbidden? If I have to choose one, I’d like to at least be called something I’m fond of.”

“I-I mean, that’s fine with me,” Hope said, turning to me with an uneasy smile.

I clenched my fists as Ann looked to me next for approval. She may have been being honest about her reasoning, but I could also tell part of her choice was out of spite. I hated backing down and rolling over for her—I really did—but Hope was right. We didn’t have time for arguments.

“Fine,” I said, “Now are you up to speed? Can we finally get moving?”

Ann nodded, “Lead the way.”

While the bird was still raging outside, we headed up to the radio room to do some inspecting on the map. As we thought, the scientist's body now appeared as a dot on the terminal, but that wasn’t the thing that stood out the most.

There were two. The first was that Zane’s rig message was different. It no longer said that a cell was loaded; it now read, *‘No conduit detected; Critical failure’*. The flashing red that it was doing before was now much more intense, the whole space around it blinking within a circle to really hammer home it’s warning.

Luckily, looking out the window toward Zane’s, it still looks normal, and has since we’ve left it, so whatever is going on within hasn’t spread to the outside and doesn’t seem like it will.

The second thing of note on the board was rig 3. It was different now too.

*‘Cell ready for harvest; Critical malfunction detected.’*

“That’s what the first rig said before it turned into Zane’s,” Hope noted.

“So that means there’s another one of those places up there?” Ann asked eagerly, tapping on the icon.

“There must be,” I told her, “Although that’s different…”

“What is?”

“That.” I said plainly, tapping on the word ‘critical’. “The last one only said ‘malfunction detected’. There was no ‘critical.”

“Do you think it’s because of what happened as we were leaving?” Hope asked.

“It could be. Although Zane’s says it’s in a full on failure. If it was going full meltdown like the jungle, I think it would have more of a warning.”

“Either way, it can’t be good. It has to be more dangerous,” Hope said, chewing her thumb nail.

“Well, we don’t really have a choice,” Ann sighed, leaning on a desk and crossing her arms, “You two almost had answers from that last scientist before she bit it; if we can find another one, they might be able to get us the out of here before they bleed out too.”

Hope shifted uncomfortably at the thought of dealing with another dying being, but I shook it off, “There’s only one problem. We can’t get up there.” I said, pointing to a line on the map and dragging my fingertip along its path, “That rig is at the top of the cliff, and we can’t get across the broken bridges at the edges of town to get to the top.”

“There was probably an elevator or staircase in the Kingfisher compound to get up there, but seeing as we don’t know the code…” Hope shrugged with a discouraged sigh.

“Is there anywhere we can climb up?” Ann asked.

I snorted, “Nah. It’s a sheer cliff. You and I both know we know nothing about rock climbing. Not that we could even if we wanted to with how shitty our bodies are.”

Ann scowled at my mocking, “Well *sorry* I’m just trying to come up with ideas here! That’s the only logical next step unless we want to wait around God-knows-how-long for a different rig to pop up.”

“We still have more bodies to collect,” I said, pointing to the scattered dots, “We’ll probably need as much juice as we can get once we get that door open. It’s just as much of an importance as the rigs are.”

“Oh, yeah, the bodies that you said give piss-all charge and that we don’t even know what they’ll do once the door opens? Real great next plan.”

“My God, are you just going to be like this the whole time you’re here with us?” I snapped.

“Hey, I didn’t *ask* to be puked up and born into this hell hole! All I want to do is get home.”

“You don’t think I don’t too?”

“Of course I do! But I think you’re being our usual, passive, pussy self about it. We need to push hard if we’re going to get out of this place.”

“Guys,” Hope cut in.

“Yeah, cause your rash overthinking is really going to be much better. What was it, 12 hours ago when you almost ran off into the dark and got eaten by a giant bird?”

“Oh, fuck off,” Ann disdainfully laughed while shaking her head, “I didn’t know what was going on, and I woke up to you and Ms. Sunshine over there lumbering over a screaming body that you guys didn’t even bother to get any info from—”

“Shut up!” Hope shouted.

Both Ann and I turned to her.

She looked red faced, and it wasn’t just from the terminal’s light, “S-Sorry, you two just… you gotta cut it out. I get that we hate ourselves—or at least you two do—but we’re all we have right now to get through this. Nobody is coming to save us except ourselves. So please, can you just get along with each other long enough to get out of this mess alive?”

Once again, I looked at Ann, and she looked at me.

“Yeah…” I coughed up.

“Sure,” Ann sheepishly nodded.

“Good,” Hope sighed like a stressed mother, “Now if you’d been paying attention, you’d have heard that the bird is gone. Are we going to move that body or what?”

I turned my head to the skylight and saw that she was right. The tower light was off, and the sounds of the bird throwing a tantrum across town were no longer present. I silently thanked God that the creature was one who gave up easily.

The three of us moved back downstairs and began hauling the corpse toward the entrance, it’s faint, sour scent of death and rot already beginning. Her songs, in contrast, were strong and potent, perhaps due to her being so fresh. Listening to them made me feel sick inside. There were a lot of memories of her laughing. Recollections of piano music and wind rustling through trees. My brain painted a somber picture of her life as we lay her in the wheelbarrow we’d taken from the hardware store in town and began wheeling her to her cold metallic grave.

The people that died here, no matter how much I was beginning to villainize them with each unraveled clue, were still all just people with lives and families and friends at one point.

One of the things that made me the most sick was a name I kept hearing as her record played on. Shae. Whoever she was, she was close to him. She cared about him a lot. In the end, though, Dr. Shae clearly didn’t care enough to not stab every single colleague of his in the back.

Hope was walking a bit in front of us, clearly needing a break after Ann and I’s incessant bickering. That left me and my third clone to move side by side, and I could tell by her uneasy shifting that she was also disturbed by the body’s song.

“Jeeze…” She muttered after a moment.

I tossed a glance to her, surprised to hear her speak, but quickly fixed my eyes back forward.

She spoke again softly, “I mean, reading about all the stuff was one thing, but… it was so unbelievable. Seeing it in person though…”

I gave her another side glance, then cleared my throat, “Um, yeah… I get that. It’s a lot to take in at once—I’m still not fully used to it all.”

Ann nodded, then bit her cheek, “Hey, I’m not trying to be an ass… I know I am being one, but… I’m just still freaking out, you know?”

I finally made full eye contact, then cleared my throat, “Don’t worry about it; you’re fine. I haven’t exactly been the most welcoming. I’ve just been here so long now that I’m used to all of this stuff. I probably would have been acting the same way had my situation been different when I got here.”

“Well, you have it a little easier too,” she smirked lazily, “You don’t have the whole ‘clone’ conundrum to stress over.”

“Why are you stressing over it?” I smirked back, “You’re me, *philosophically* *speaking*.”

“Shut up,” she said with a sharp laugh.

“And don’t worry, it’s my problem too. I already told Hope, but once we get out of here, we’ll figure out how to get back to our old life together.”

“Yeah, and how do you think Trevor is going to take having three girlfriends?”

My stomach sank a bit; a question I was hoping she wouldn’t ask. While I didn’t plan on cutting any of them out or abandoning them, there were certain aspects of our old lives that I wouldn’t be able to share. Hope and I joked about it during our talk, but we’d resolved to discuss it later. I was hoping that’d be the last time this topic would come up before we left.

I tried to pass it off with a joking remark, “Pfft. Best day of his life, probably.”

Luckily, that tactic worked, and Ann snickered the concept off. Although it was clear other things were on her mind. Once her laughter wore off, she sighed deep and looked toward the endless dark sky, “God, I can’t believe I said what I did to him before we left. I’m such a bitch.”

“*We* said,” I reminded her, “And not even *we*. *I* technically said those things; you didn’t even exist yet. Don’t blame yourself.”

“Yeah, but isn’t the running theory that Hope and I are part of you? Maybe it was just me saying what we said before I came out,” she darkly growled.

I was beginning to feel hope’s issue of not knowing how to talk now, “Well, whoever said it, we all know we didn’t mean to hurt him. He knows that.”

“Sure,” Ann nodded, “I swear though, we cannot die here without getting a chance to tell him ourselves. Do you know how much it will ruin him if that fight was our last words ever before we just dropped off the face of the earth?”

I opened my mouth to speak but truly came up dry this time. She had a point. That would be awful, and the worst part was that right now, it was the most likely outcome. I was saved on having to respond when we finally reached the hatch, but my emotions weren’t as I began to stew on that thought.

“Alright. Ann, could you get the hatch?” Hope asked, grabbing the scientist's legs and looking for me to grab the torso. I did so as the dark maw of the chute hungrily opened, and together, we funneled the body away to its destiny.

Ann shut the lid as thuds rang out, the poor researcher's body clanging against the wall the whole way down. After a few seconds, the mechanical whirring started, and Hope and I watched the gauge with anticipation.

My heart leaped when it bumped its progress up by a whole quarter of the way.

“Holy crap!” Hope gasped.

Ann quickly stood straight and furrowed her brow, “What? What’s so crazy?”

“That’s the most progress we’ve ever gotten from a body,” I barely could mutter in surprise.

“Why do you think that happened?” asked Hope, “Do you think it’s because it’s so, um… fresh?”

“I don’t know,” I shot back, my eyes glued to the gauge, “The computer at the tower said the cell was ‘ready for harvest’. Maybe the rigs are specially designed to collect this ‘imprint’ stuff.”

“What were the cells, then?” Hope questioned, “Because it didn’t look like originally those cores had a body stuffed into them.”

“I wonder if they even knew that bodies had that property to begin with.”

“These wires,” Ann cut in, shining her flashlight to the cables running along the cliff face and into the frame of the giant metal door, “In your logs you said these are all over this town.”

“Yeah, they’re everywhere. They were in Zane’s too.”

“Well a rig is usually used for harvesting, right? Like an oil rig? They probably were pumping whatever that stuff is straight from them.”

“Why bother with the hatch then?” Hope asked.

Ann looked to me, “That scientist, what did you say she called you before she croaked?”

I gave her a confused look, then remembered, “She said that we were ‘just tributes’.”

Hope put her hand on the hatch handle, then cranked it open, allowing the horrible stench within to bellow up, “That smell doesn’t come from a few bodies, and even if the scientists trapped here before used the same method to get out, I think they were using it for corpses even before that. If there was a difference between scientists and ‘tributes’, then maybe they were only throwing the latter in here.”

“She mentioned looking for gods or something,” I muttered, “Maybe tributes were some sort of sacrifice.”

“And if the drill runs on imprints from tributes…”

“Then they needed more in order to dig deeper.” I said, looking off toward the edge of the shelf where I knew the abyss was, “Oh my God, this wasn’t even their final destination. This is just a halfway point.”

“The traffic cam…” Hope muttered, staring at the wet pavement.

Ann and I turned to her.

She looked up, specifically to her fellow clone, “One of the last things I remember is passing that traffic cam in the woods. Remember that? How weird it was that it was in the middle of nowhere?”

Ann nodded with a confused look.

“What if it wasn’t a traffic cam?”

“What do you mean?” I asked.

Hope shrugged, “Exactly that. What if it was something else? The bright flash, then a few minutes later we come across the town? We were out in the middle of nowhere; what if they set up some sort of machine to drag new subjects here where they could easily manage how many people go missing?”

“I didn’t feel any different after passing it, though,” I told her.

“But you said the shift into this place happened slowly,” Hope said, “Like you were sinking through layers of a reality or something. First the people went, then the sound, then the bridges and lights and then you were here in this rotting version of it.”

“So that means their little experiment is still on,” Ann spoke, “Even though this place came crashing down on them, they were too in a hurry to scramble that they forgot to turn the damn thing off.”

My eyes fixed on the hatch, and intense nausea overtook me, “All those innocent people who looked like civilians that ended up here. All those dots…” I looked at my clones, “How long has this been happening? How has nobody outside noticed?”

“If these Kingfisher people had enough money to do all of this,” Ann gestured around us, “I doubt covering anything up would be a problem.” She spun on her heels and began walking along the cliff face while looking up, “One thing is certain though, we need to find a way up to that next rig. If that Shae prick was able to use the drill to get out like his buddies said, that means it drills up as easy as it does down.”

“We’re still far off from filling it,” Hope noted, “It was drained when we got here; that means it probably took a full charge to run it long enough to get out.”

“Well, hopefully by the time we get the next one, the other two will be ready,” Ann said, shining her beam up the cliff as she moved.

It made my anxiety spike seeing her basically project a beacon onto the wall for anything in the abyss to see, but it fell to the wayside when her light caught something that wasn’t just stone and moss.

“What is that?” she muttered.

Hope and I stepped close to where she was and looked up with her, unable to believe our eyes.

It was a catwalk that had been hidden in the shadow all along. A fire escape, to be more specific. The rusty metal was drilled into the side of the cliff face and coiled its way up into the dark out of sight, but it was clear where it led to. If there was a way up the mountain from this side of the door, we’d found it.

The only issue was, the emergency access wasn’t very accessible. At some point, something seemingly massive must have done a number on it. The bottom half was missing, and about 80 feet into the air, the part of the catwalk still intact looked like it had been mangled and torn, its frame seeming like it had the strength of a paper clip with how badly it was bent sideways. The nausea that I had begun feeling intensified.

“Remember when I asked if there was a way to get up, and you told me it was a sheer cliff,” Ann accused at me with a scowl.

“Yeah? And how do you plan to get up to it?” I shot back.

“There’s gotta be a ladder around here or something.”

“No ladder tall enough to get us that high,” Hope said, still transfixed on the fire escape.

Ann moved her beam away and shined it around the alley, looking for anything that might aid the situation. There was nothing but grimy dumpsters and piles of soggy cardboard boxes, but her beam eventually did stop on something that caught her attention. The wheelbarrow.

“You said there was a hardware store in this town?” Ann asked. “Were there ladders?”

I shrugged, “Yeah, but Ann, there’s no way we can use them to get up there. Stacking them would be way too unstable—”

“No duh; I know,” she huffed in frustration, “Just take me there. I think I have an idea.”

I looked at the tower to make sure the light hadn’t come back on, then to Hope who shrugged before leading the way. I couldn’t get too upset about Ann’s relapse in sass. After all, she’d just found us a possible way forward.

We started off through the streets together, and Hope spoke, “What are you thinking?”

Ann bit her cheek and looked back off toward the wall, weighing her imagination against reality, “Remember when we moved into our first house, Dad had us help him hang those shelves in the garage, but the wall was concrete?”

“Yeah.” Hope and I both nodded.

“We had to use those stone anchors cause’ the bolts wouldn’t hold otherwise. If we can find some of those, we might be able to make our own ladder up straight into the cliff wall.”

“That… doesn’t sound very stable,” Hope asked with a wince.

“Do you have any other ideas, ‘better half’?” Ann jabbed.

Hope didn’t respond.

I was about to say something too before we reached the edge of the block that turned onto the hardware store street. I was on lookout when they hitched on light gleaming between some buildings. It wasn’t a lot, certainly less than Zane’s, but it was still brighter than the vending machines. I stopped and put my arm out.

The other girls instantly saw what I was looking at.

Ann caught on fast, “I presume that light hasn’t always been there?”

“No.” I plainly answered.

“It’s not moving,” Hope noted, “It must be a building.”

That was all any of us needed to know. Slowly, we crossed the road and began moving closer.

The light was coming from the end of the road where a line of houses were built into a hill. All of them were their usual dark selves, but in front of one, there was a streetlight that was casting its amber glow onto the road. Other than that, there was nothing in the space that looked out of order. That was, until I noticed it.

My steps gradually tapered off in disbelief, and Hope and Ann quickly followed suit, stopping at my sides.

One of the houses in the line stuck out. The old, two story 60’s style home stood just a little taller than the rest, the cream-colored paint on its slats chipped to all hell and its shingles a rock throw from falling off. The water stained windows stared coldly in the reflection of the streetlight, and the front lawn was filled with weeds and cracked pathways. The whole thing was lit perfectly in the eerie yellow glow of the light, as if placing itself on display for our horror.

It was our old childhood home. Our first house that Ann was talking about mere minutes ago.

My heart beat fast as I looked at the nostalgic, yet all too sickening sight. I had never wanted to look at that house again after we’d left it, and if I was going to, I certainly didn’t want it to be in this place. My hands were shaking as I took a small step forward and swallowed, the nausea in my stomach growing stronger.

“Why is that here?” I asked aloud, as if Ann or Hope could give me a valid answer.

Ann certainly couldn’t, but Hope did know one thing.

“I think this is Rig 2.”

She was right. This was the spot we’d come to check after Zane’s showed up, but it certainly hadn’t been our house last time we were here. I hated knowing that. I hated it because it meant we would now have to interact with it. We had to go inside. I knew that was going to happen with the 3^(rd) rig too, but it seemed far enough off with the task of scaling the cliff that my brain hadn’t confronted it, let alone imagined the form it was going to take.

I really didn’t want to go into this place.

“I guess the good news is that we get to put off our climb for now,” Ann said. She didn’t sound smug or curt anymore. Her tone was soft and breathless. She was probably feeling the emotions that I was; most likely worse considering the parts of me she embodied.

Then again, maybe she wasn’t feeling worse than me, because at that moment, the sickness in my guts became too much, and I felt a familiar tightness in my throat. Before I could even let out a curse or a noise of disagreement, I collapsed to my hands and knees and released a new bloody mass onto the sidewalk.

Hope placed her hands to her mouth, and Ann watched in horror. I just panted softly before wiping my mouth and gritting my blood-stained teeth.

“You have got to be fucking kidding me…” I muttered to the small, meaty flesh.

At least it bought us time. Time to avoid the house, even if just for a day. I knew we wouldn’t put it off, though. As soon as this Hensley was up, we were going to have to give her the rundown and come back, wether she was ready or not. We didn’t have time to wait when the beast below was apparently getting closer with each day.

Though, after what I saw at Zanes, I genuinely think that whatever is waiting for us in that house—whatever it is that the abyss plucked from the recesses of my mind—it has the potential to be worse than whatever the whispers and snapping bones are.

Without a word, I reached down and grabbed the mini me, much to the disgust of Hope. I wasn’t going to leave her to grow in the streets, and frankly, I was over this by now. I just wanted to get the hell out of here.

…A few months into dating Trevor, we were laying in bed one night talking. He held me tight, and I clung to him thinking back to that first night in the club. It had been a long while since I’d spent so much time on one person. Since I’d *let* myself spend so much time on one person.

As our first time talking fondly played through my head, I couldn’t help but remember that moment when we went to walk away. Where his friend caught his arm and whispered something in his ear, then looked at me. I don’t know why it stuck with me so much, but it had been something I’d been curious about long after that night. Finally, I decided to ask.

“Hey Trev?”

“Yeah?”

“Do you remember the night you met me, before we started dancing, your friend stopped you and told you something? I think it had to do with me; do you remember?”

He thought for a moment in silence, trying to recall. When he finally did, he snickered softly, “You really want to know? It’s kinda rude.”

I scrunched my face, “Well yeah, now I *definitely* want to know.”

I felt his chest rise and fall with the memory, “He said you’d hooked up with him before, then ghosted him the next night. He told me that he saw you there all the time hooking up with people and that you weren’t worth it.”

My stomach got tight, and I snuggled a little closer, “Oh…”

“Don’t worry about it. He was a dick.” Trevor said, “There’s a reason we don’t talk anymore.”

I didn’t respond for a moment, chewing on his words, but then another question came to mind, “Why did you still come dance with me?”

“Cause I didn’t care,” Trevor answered.

“You were fine with me using you?”

“No,” Trevor said plainly, softly kissing my head, “I knew you weren’t going to.”

I snickered in amusement, “How’d you know that?”

“Because I could see it in you,” he told me, “You weren’t dangerous. You may have come out strong, but I could see beneath that. When you talked about your mom, you had this look in your eyes. You were like me. You were just scared.”

“Scared of what?”

“Of everything,” He whispered, taking my hand, “But I had this feeling if I came with you, I wouldn’t be alone anymore.”

“Do you still feel alone now that you know the real me?”

He snickered and brought my hand to his lips, kissing down it softly before bridging his mouth over to my forehead, “Absolutely not. If you hadn’t pulled me away from that wall, I would have been there forever.”

I smiled at his words, and couldn’t help but sit up to place my lips on his. I wish instead I would have told him that the same was true for me. I wish I would have told him that he saved me that night as much as I supposedly saved him.

If I ever make it out of here, it’ll be the first thing I say.

All my reminiscing about Trevor has gotten me thinking about Ann, though. That night at the club, despite my drunkenness, abrasiveness, and the words from his friend, he somehow saw enough in me to give me a chance.

She may already drive me crazy, and we may not get along very well, but maybe despite her flaws, I just need to focus on the good parts of her too.

That said, I *really* hope this new Hensley isn’t half as irritating as her, and if I survive the house, I guess you’ll hear all about her soon.

Wish me luck.
