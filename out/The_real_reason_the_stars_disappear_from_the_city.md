It was December 31st, 1999 and we just blew out my first double-digit candles. 

My parents moved from Louisiana to inner-city Seattle, this means that I was surprised and kinda shocked to have my birthday party in Graham, in the countryside. 

We just blew out my candles. It was 11:50 at night. Everyone was tired and knocked out due to eating ungodly amounts of Southern food that my mother had cooked. 

I was laying on a big branch in the forest, not too far from the farm, I just needed to breathe while everyone was asleep. I'm a fast sleeper, so the noises almost carried to Sandman's graces but my mother popped out of nowhere. She was carrying a bundle of fireworks. 

My mother was a nice and intiutive woman. They say that women in general have intuition. I just say that insane intuition is an my-mom only type trait. She always knew that I wasn't good with social gatherings and liked to listen to nature...sounds. not be in nature.  

My mother climbed on top the giant branch.

She told me a story. A story about the stars. 

She told me that the stars in heaven are ghosts. The ghosts always liked to be together and they never really wanted to be too alone. 

When we were in the city, we never saw the stars. 

I asked my mother, "When we were in Seattle, we don't ever see no stars. Why?" 

My mother stopped and started to think. She followed it with, "My child, the stars are people too. Maybe we if saw them in the city where there are lots of people, we would find their most mysterious secrets. Now, they don't want that just like we have secrets we don't wanna tell."

"Mother, that's kinda dumb, what secret might they have that we don't know?"

"My boy, that's a secret only God knows."

We didn't speak for the rest of the night. We just shot fireworks. We didn't see the stars that night. We only saw fireworks as the rainbow explosion covered the sky of Heaven over Earth.

That was the best memory of my mother.

She died in her sleep of a brain aneurysm. Instant Death

When they let me coordinate the funeral, I had the coffin covered in a massive golden leaf star. We put the coffin back in her home in Louisiana. 

This happened when I was 15. I spoke to a psychologist, Dr. T, as he was commonly referred to by his other patients due to his facial hair.. Dr. Tallman helped me through my mother's death. This kickstarted my passion for psychological research. Later when I was 25, I was a leading researcher for both psychology and astronomy for astronauts and others that were exposed to bizarre events or circumstances that affected psychological health as well as recording events in outer space. 

On April 25th 2018, I was called down to NASA. I had a Level 7, also known as Level Apollyon. I had to move to a military base in Washington in the Rocky Mountains. I was still in a state of confusion. I was called down and I was told to never reveal the secret as it was top-secret classified information. 

I walked down to the Solar Observation Room, the room specifically dealing with observation of the sun's inner sound. They said that they had a theory that only the Level 10s, specifically world leaders and leading researchers in the entire world know about.

They said that they are only allowing a certain piece of information to be allowed to Level 7 for researching events that happened concurrently to this revelation.

The stars were alive. 

The stars had hearts inside which pumped. 

We found them out in 1986, when a satellite, was near the sun and found a crater that showed a beating heart. 

The stars were alive

The stars are real

The stars are alive?

I was dumbfounded to say the absolute simple least. The stars however were lately releasing unknown radiation or energy that was affecting Earth, it started happening in West Virginia.

We had multiple messages in 1986 after the sun was discovered as a organism. 

"WE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN HERE."

"SLOW DOWN"

"NO LEARNING"

"WOLVES KILL SHEPHARDS"

We have no idea what the hell these messages are talking about. 

This was the beginning of the end. We really had no way to going back, we didn't know we were supposed to.

May 29th, 2020, West Virginia.

I was writing down ideas in my notebook for years. Google Doc upon Google Doc filled with theories and explanations. 

Known effects on West Virginia have only been tied to West Virginia. 

These known effects are:
- Merging of human and wildlife.
- Carnivorous herbivores.
- Raining specifically on cemeteries. 
- Bizarre lightning related activities around churches

Nothing too wild compared to the events that are happening right now in Seattle, New York, Los Angeles, and Miami. 

Special teams called the Flashbangs are sent out after a bizarre event. These use a special gas to make them forget approximately 10 hours. Some civilian who may be immune are euthanized in secret. 

The first of these events happened in West Virginia. 

At 6:30 PM, the rain had turn from clear to a red color and had started to rise up back into the air in the form of droplets. The water factory in West Virginia had to stop all water after finding out that a third of the water had turned into sheep blood.

The citizens and people at the factory were visited by the Flashbangs.

I landed in Virginia for the second event that happened. It was unusually snowy, it was reported in the forest. I drove on an ATV, alone into the thick wood. The trip was 7-ish minutes until I came up on a meateating doe was feasting a rabbit. The glowing eyes stared into my head. 

"YOU ARE STILL LOOKING UP. STOP."

"THIS IS A WARNING"

"HAVE FAITH"

I immediately reported the findings to my superior. 

I decided that I needed to breathe. I went to my home in Seattle and took a paid leave. 

April 12, 2022

I decided to take around and out of the city for a minute. I was watching the sky as I was driving in my car. The stars were not there. It was just light pollution. I started to crack a smile as the stars begin to pop up as I went further and further away from the city.

I started to think, if the stars were trying to warn us, why didn't they tell the public?

I stopped the car when I looked down and saw another fucking doe. 

The neck started contorting into a weird shape, new flesh was growing into the throat of the deer. The deer looked like it was going choke on it's own neck. 

"Stop looking up."

It spoke calmly. More calmly than the last doe in West Virginia.

Then more of them showed up.

"Stop looking up, STOP IT."

They went away.

I immediately drew a connection to the stars in the sky.

This may be what I can write at the moment. I need to sleep.

My alcohol is getting low and I don't wanna talk about this. I'm going to speak on this, tomorrow.
