I spent my thirtieth birthday sitting in a booth at Denny’s, watching the candle on a singular cupcake melt into the icing. The waitress didn’t even sing. She just dropped the check and walked away.

That was my life. I was gray noise. I was the person you bumped into on the subway and didn’t apologize to because you didn’t even register I was there. I was invisible.

I didn’t want to be famous. I just wanted to be *seen*.

That night, scrolling through a forum for "hopeless cases" people discussing extreme loneliness I got a DM. No username. Just a blank space.

*“Do you want to matter?”*

I should have blocked it. But the gin and tonic in my system made me brave. I replied: *“Yes.”*

They sent me an address. It was a warehouse in the garment district, the kind of place that smells like rust and old copper. I went the next night. I met a man there who introduced himself only as "The Sculptor." He didn't look like a doctor; he looked like a butcher who had washed up. His hands were stained with something that looked like ink, but smelled like formaldehyde.

"Loneliness is a deficiency," he told me, his voice sounding like wet gravel. "Your presence is weak. Your bio-electric field is dormant. I can wake it up. But once the battery is on, it drains fast. You’ll need to... recharge."

I didn't ask what that meant. I didn't ask the price. He didn't ask for money. He just looked at me with those hollow, assessing eyes and pointed to the chair. I sat down and let him hook me up to a machine that looked like a dialysis unit rigged with car batteries. He pumped a thick, silver fluid into my veins. It burned. It felt like he was injecting liquid dry ice into my arm.

I passed out screaming.

When I woke up, I was alone in the warehouse. I felt... heavy. Solid.

The change wasn't immediate, but by the time I took the subway home, I noticed it. People didn't just look at me; they *stared*. A man offered me his seat. A woman moved her bag so I could stand more comfortably. I felt a hum in my chest, a vibration that made my teeth ache.

For a week, it was paradise.

My boss, who usually called me "Ellen" (my name is Elaine), suddenly promoted me to lead the new marketing pitch. "You have a magnetism I never noticed before," he said, his eyes slightly glazed over.

I got dates. Three in one week.

But then the hunger started.

It wasn't a hunger for food. I ate a steak, and it tasted like ash. I drank water, and it felt like sand.

The hunger was in my hands. My palms itched. My fingertips felt hot, like I was holding them over a candle. The only time the itching stopped was when I touched someone. A handshake. A pat on the back.

Last night was the turning point.

I brought a guy home. Mark. He was sweet, a gym trainer with a nice smile. We were on my couch, kissing. The vibration in my chest was deafening, like a hive of bees under my ribs.

I put my hand on his chest. The relief was instant. It was better than any drug. I felt the heat from his body flow into my hand, up my arm, and into that buzzing void in my chest.

"Wow," Mark whispered, his eyes rolling back slightly. "Your hands are... warm."

I pushed harder. I couldn't help it. I needed *more*.

Then I felt something wet.

I pulled back. My hand wasn't just resting on his chest. My fingers had sunk *into* him.

There was no blood. It was like his skin had turned into warm clay. My fingers were buried knuckle-deep in his pectoral muscle, the flesh fusing seamlessly with my own skin.

I screamed and yanked my hand away.

There was a sickening *squelch*.

Mark didn’t scream. He didn't even look at the four distinct holes in his chest where my fingers had been. The skin around the wounds was gray and shriveled, like a piece of fruit that had been sucked dry.

He just smiled at me, a lopsided, vacant smile. His eyes were completely black. No whites. Just void.

"That felt nice, Elaine," he slurred. "Do it again."

I ran into the bathroom and locked the door. I’ve been in here for three hours. Mark is still out there. He’s scratching at the door. Not aggressively. Just a slow, rhythmic scratching.

*Scritch. Scritch. Scritch.*

"I'm cold, Elaine," he says through the door. "I need you to warm me up."

I looked at my hand in the mirror. The silver fluid in my veins is glowing faintly under the skin. And the worst part?

I don't feel guilty. I don't feel scared.

I feel *full*. And looking at the door, listening to Mark's weak voice... I’m realized I’m starting to get hungry again.
