I moved into my own apartment about two months ago. It was an older building, tucked away in the quieter part of town. As I walked into the confines of my new home for the first time, I was met with the smell of old wallpaper and the faint vestiges of the lives people had lived here. It had its charm despite the signs of age, and the price was reasonable for a recent college grad like myself.  
The first couple of weeks, everything seemed normal. It was about the third week when I first heard the whispers. It was faint. I brushed it off as my mind playing tricks on me, adapting to the silence and solitude of living alone.  
But they persisted. The hushed whispers, too low to distinguish any distinct words but loud enough to notice, began to grow louder over time. They seemed to echo around the room, always out of reach, but always there.  
One night, after hearing what sounded like murmurs just behind me, I snapped. I yelled, demanding whatever entity messing with me to show themselves, expressing my frustration and terror. The whispers ceased momentarily. My heart was pounding in my chest when abruptly, a chilling sensation coursed through me as a clearly articulated whisper echoed in my ear, "You're not alone."  
Fear wrapped itself around my heart, squeezing my chest tightly. I slept with the lights on that night, the whispers contrasting eerily against the otherwise silence of my apartment, my heart pounding to its rhythm.  
Refusing to let my fears overwhelm me, I decided to reach out to a local paranormal group. The team arrived with their specialized equipment, hoping to catch these elusive whispers. As evening fell, the whispers returned - this time seemingly agitated. The investigators' equipment started going haywire, recording anomalous readings fruitlessly as they couldn't catch the whispers.  
It was when spiritual medium, Lily, arrived when things took another unsettling turn. As soon as she stepped into my apartment, she recoiled, pointing at the air and saying "It's them." The whispers cascaded around us, growing in intensity. Through her, we learnt that these were unrested spirits, whispering their tales, their regrets, stuck in an ethereal echo.  
Lily performed a session to help the spirits move on, the process draining her significantly. As the sun began to peak from behind the horizon, the whispers quietened. I held my breath, listening carefully. All I could hear was the normal early morning sounds of the city. No whispers. Just silence.  
Lily left with a tired smile on her face. I thanked the team for their help, my apartment finally feeling like mine again. But as I closed the door behind them, a soft, almost imperceptible whisper echoed around me, a soft "Goodbye". I looked around my empty apartment, the chill of the whisper still lingering in the air, leaving me doubtful on whether the spirits had left or given a terrifying decree - That I'll never be alone.  
I share this with you now, as I sit here in the deafening silence of my apartment, the memories of chilling whispers the only company I have in the quiet. It's a tale that haunts my dreams, a reminder that sometimes, the unseen can have a voice - one that can instill fear like no other.
