It was October 12th, 1984.  
  
My first day of highschool was tommorrow. Our first day starts on a Friday, strange, but  i brushed it off.  
  
It was late, I yawned -   
And yelled out to my mom,  
  
'' Goodnight! ''  
  
I woke up the next morning, Excited— I backed my bag, ready to head out the door.  
  
I caught the bus. Many of the kids were talking about some strange new rule that had taken place.   
Confused - i sat down next to my two friends.  
  
I asked,   
  
'' What's this new curfew rule that everyone and their mom is talking about? ''  
  
They replied, in sort of a joke-like tone.   
  
'' Oh! that! it's so the monsters dont eat us! ''  
  
 They giggled. They were clearly as confused as i was.  
  
We rode the bus, and soon arrived at school. We all headed into our first class, I could hear kids whispering about it.  
Thoughout the day, i tried getting more information on it.  
  
No luck.  
  
Lunch soon rolled around, We ran to the cafeteria.  
   
''Attention all students.'' Came a male voice over the intercom.  ''As you've probably all heard by now, There's a new curfew rule taking place over the Parkville Area.''  
  
I gasped, ''I live there! '' I looked at my friends, Then going back to pay attention to the annoucement.  
  
''You must all be in your locked house's by 7:56pm.'' The Intercom voice said.  
'' If you are caught outside your house after that time'' - The intercom made a crackly noise, breaking up.   
  
The cafeteria went silent, Confused.  
  
I glanced around— The rest of the students were heading to the second class, like nothing happened.  
  
It's like they were..Robots..?   
  
A few hours later, School ended.  
  
I walked home.  
  
The streets were empty.  
  
But i didnt feel alone.  
All i could hear was the wind brushing aganst the trees, my own breath.  
  
I rushed home, By now it was 6pm—Where'd all the time go?  
  
I Walked upstairs, grabbing the homework from my bag, I sat down on my bed, grabbing a pen.  
I must've been doing my homework for ages. It was 7:50pm now. six minutes away from the curfew.  
  
My mom yelled out for dinner Or so i thought.—before i could even go downstairs, there was a sound out my window, it sounded like footsteps..  
Scared, I slowly crept upto my window, peering through the curtains.  
  
I saw something, It looked like a person, although something was different—The being had no hair, A very pale complexion and was quite boney.  
  
 It started to turn it's head slowly towards my home, I quickly ducked down before it could see me. I sat on the floor below the window,   
  
Then i realized.   
  
The being had no eyes. IT HAD NO EYES.  
  
 Just..black...gaping..holes...   
  
 I slowly, but shakily peered out the window again, I locked eyes with the being as it had a terrfying grin on it's face. As it snapped it's head towards me once more. I was terrifed, I just stared—frozen in horror, I didn't dare make a sound.   
  
I shakily closed my eyes, hoping it to be a dream..A nightmare at that.. To be continued.
