It’s been two days.
Two days of that constant, rasping breath outside my bedroom door.

It hasn’t left.

He—she—whatever the fuck it is, it’s still there.

It started on Tuesday. That stupid fucking forum.

⸻

The text popped up on my phone as I was half-dozing on the couch, half-watching reruns on the TV’s dead glow. Angie. My best friend. My anchor through every disaster life could throw.

Angie: A dance with Eros can bring you a life of luxury!!

I blinked at it, confused, a little amused.

Me: What is this?
Angie: IDK, found on reddit, great results, click it.

I frowned. Since when did Angie use punctuation? That weird little detail should’ve been my first red flag, but I shrugged it off. Curiosity wasn’t my strong suit.

I tapped the link.

A black screen filled my phone, a lone spinning grey circle in the center. It loaded so slowly I groaned, propping my feet on the coffee table. My apartment was quiet and heavy in the late-night dark, the faint smell of the Domino’s pizza I’d devoured earlier still clinging to the air.

Finally, the screen changed.

It was… a menu. Like a cheap mobile game.

Dance
Settings
Menu
Exit

A cold shiver crept up my spine. Something deep in me whispered don’t click Dance. I should’ve listened.

But I didn’t.

I tapped.

One single command appeared in big white letters.

Twirl.

I laughed awkwardly, stood up, and spun once in my living room.

Great job!

Another command.

Jumping jacks!

I sighed but obeyed, hopping in place, already winded from my warehouse shifts.

Then came the final message:

Last one!
Eros lumin ackro delsus

The words were strange, wrong somehow, like they didn’t belong in my mouth. But I said them aloud anyway.

The phone let out a piercing PING that rattled through the room. I jumped, dropping it onto the couch.

When I picked it back up, the screen simply read:

Congrats!
Luxury.

Then the app vanished. No history. No trace.

I texted Angie.

Me: This is stupid. Just made me do a bunch of exercise lol.

She didn’t reply for hours. I crawled into bed, exhausted, and was half-asleep when my phone finally dinged.

Angie: I’m sorry.

My stomach twisted.

Me: Sorry? For what?

The message went green.

She’d blocked me.

⸻

When morning came. My phone vibrated with a bank notification.

$10,000,000 has been deposited into your account.

I sat up so fast I almost fell out of bed.

“Oh fuck—oh my fucking god.”

Throwing on clothes, I didn’t even look in the mirror as I grabbed my car keys and sped to Angie’s house.

The street was eerily silent. Her porch felt wrong, the air thick like static.

“Angie!” I banged on the door, heart hammering.

No answer.

“Open up, Angie!”

The final pound made the door creak open. A smell rolled out, thick and putrid, like something long dead.

I gagged, yanking my shirt over my nose as I stepped inside.

The flashlight on my phone cut through the dark.

And I saw.

Blood.

So much blood. Painted up the walls, pooled on the floor, splattered across the ceiling until there wasn’t a clean inch of white left.

And Angie…

She was strung up by her own intestines, her body twisted and mangled like a grotesque marionette.

I vomited, collapsing to my knees.

That’s when I heard it.

A low, guttural growl from deeper in the house.

I froze.

The open doorway beyond seemed to swallow my flashlight beam whole, black and bottomless.

The growl got closer.

I bolted. Stumbled out the door, tripping down the steps, fumbling for my car keys.

By the time I slammed the door shut behind me, my chest felt like claws were sinking into my lungs. I barely remember driving. I just remember dialing 911 with shaking hands, my voice cracking as I screamed into the phone.

The cops came. Questions were asked. But none of it mattered.

Why me? Why any of this?

⸻

I took a week off work. I didn’t touch the money. Couldn’t.

The game. Angie’s body. The smell. The words.

I couldn’t stop thinking about it.

Then the lights started flickering.

At first I thought it was just old wiring. But soon the air in the house grew heavy and wet, like breathing through syrup. My reflection in the mirror became… wrong. Sagging, pale, my eyes sunken deep like I hadn’t slept in weeks.

I hated looking at myself.

Then one night, I woke up and everything was pitch black. The lights wouldn’t turn on.

It was so fucking hot.

I grabbed my phone, the flashlight trembling in my hands as I scanned the room. The walls looked… damp. Like they were sweating.

And then—

Exhale.

A soft breath.

Just outside my bedroom door.

I locked it instantly, heart racing.

The shuffle of footsteps.

And then my phone pinged.

Unknown: You played the game.
Unknown: You didn’t follow the rules.
Unknown: Didn’t spend the money.

I stared at the screen, shaking.

Me: Who the fuck is this??

The doorknob jiggled.

I’d never read the rules.

CRACK. The door splintered as something pulled at it, impossibly strong.

I backed up until I was pressed against the far wall, whispering over and over, “Fuck, fuck, fuck.”

⸻

It’s been days now.

I’ve survived on the stale snacks in my nightstand and water from the bathroom sink.

The breathing outside the door hasn’t stopped. It’s getting louder. Angrier.

The wood cracks and groans a little more each hour.

I don’t know how much longer it’ll hold.

I wondered how Angie was feeling in her last days. Did she ever think she would escape? did I? 
I think i’m going to jump, i’m sitting outside of the window writing this

I won’t let it have me, even if it means becoming a splat of flesh on the concrete six stories from my window.
