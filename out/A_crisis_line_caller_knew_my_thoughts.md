I volunteer on a crisis line a couple nights a month. It’s not heroic. It’s not a calling. It’s a job you do with a headset on, in a room where everyone speaks quietly like noise might break something.

You learn the scripts. You learn the protocols. You learn how to keep your voice steady when someone else’s isn’t.

Most calls are lonely, not dramatic. People who don’t want to wake their partner up. People sitting in their car in a parking lot because going home feels worse. People who are not actively dying, but are thinking about it too much.

You get used to the rhythm.

Greeting. Name of the service. Consent to continue. Basic safety questions. Then the real work, which is mostly just staying with someone long enough that the moment passes.

We’re told not to take things personally. We’re told not to try to be a savior. We’re told to keep boundaries.

And we’re told, a lot, that the calls are recorded.

That part matters.

The night this happened, the room was half full. Low lights. Computer monitors. The sound of other people murmuring into headsets. I was three hours into my shift and feeling that specific kind of tired where your body is calm but your thoughts start to drift.

I remember thinking, very clearly, that I wanted to get through the rest of the night without anything heavy.

Then my line lit up.

No caller ID. That happens sometimes. Some carriers block it. Some people use apps. It’s not automatically weird.

I clicked accept.

“Thank you for calling,” I said. “You’ve reached the crisis line. My name is Joe. What’s going on tonight?”

There was a pause. Not dead air. Breathing. Like they were smiling quietly on the other end.

Then a voice said, “Hi, Joe.”

Not “hello.” Not “sir.” Not “I need help.”

Just my name.

My stomach did that small drop it does when something isn’t following the pattern.

I kept my tone the same. Professional. Neutral.

“Hi,” I said. “What can I help you with tonight?”

Another pause.

Then: “You always do that. You always pretend it’s normal first.”

I sat a little straighter in my chair.

Prank calls happen. Usually they’re sloppy. Teenagers trying to shock you. People breathing heavy. People trying to bait you into breaking script so they can laugh.

This didn’t sound like that.

This sounded… familiar. Not the voice. The cadence.

Measured. Controlled. Like someone who knows the rules.

“Okay,” I said. “It sounds like you know me. Can you tell me your name?”

The caller breathed out, almost like a laugh, but smaller.

“I’m calling ahead,” they said.

“Calling ahead of what?”

“Of you,” they said, like it should’ve been obvious. “Of what you’re going to do.”

I felt my mouth go dry. I glanced at the monitor like it would give me a normal explanation. Call timer running. Recording indicator on. Everything standard.

In the background, across the room, someone’s printer started making that grinding sound like it was eating paper.

The caller said, “Don’t look at the screen like it’s going to save you.”

My fingers went cold on the mouse.

I didn’t speak for a beat. I forced my voice back into place.

“Are you in danger right now?” I asked. It’s a standard question. It’s the first step. It’s also the fastest way to find out if someone is messing with you, because prank callers don’t like being steered into anything real.

“No,” they said. “Not yet.”

“Are you thinking about harming yourself?”

A pause.

Then, softly, like they were being kind: “You are.”

My heart kicked hard once.

I almost laughed. Not because it was funny. Because it was insane. Because it was such an overreach that my brain wanted to swat it away.

“I’m not,” I said.

“You don’t have to lie,” they said. “You do that thing where you tell the truth with your body and deny it with your mouth.”

I swallowed.

“I don’t know who this is,” I said, “but if you’re calling to harass staff, I’m going to end the call.”

“Right,” they said. “That’s what you tell yourself you’ll do.”

I waited.

They continued, calm as anything.

“You’re going to hover over the end button,” they said. “Your hand’s going to shake a little, but you’re going to keep your voice steady because you like being the steady one.”

My hand was already hovering over the end button.

I pulled it back like it burned.

Across the room, the printer jammed fully and made a loud thunk. Someone muttered under their breath.

The caller said, “There it is.”

I felt my face go hot. My ears started ringing. I stared straight ahead and forced my breathing to slow down, because that’s what you do when you can’t afford to fall apart.

“This is a crisis line,” I said, careful. “If you need support, I can help you. But I need you to tell me what’s going on for you tonight.”

“You’re still performing,” they said. “You’re still trying to turn this into a normal call.”

“It is a normal call,” I said, and hated how thin my voice sounded.

The caller sighed, like they were disappointed in me.

“Okay,” they said. “Let’s do it your way. Let’s do the questions.”

Then they changed their tone slightly, like they were reading from a screen.

“Client reports increased anxiety,” they said. “Client endorses intrusive thoughts. Client presents with guarded affect. Client expresses fear of saying too much.”

My skin crawled.

That wasn’t just clinical language.

That was my language.

That was how I write.

The caller said, “You’re going to write this down. You always do.”

I didn’t answer. I couldn’t.

They kept going.

“Denies intent. Denies plan,” they said. “States: ‘I’m not afraid of dying. I’m afraid of being kept alive for it.’”

My stomach dropped through the floor.

Because I had thought that sentence once, in my car, with the windows up, when I didn’t trust myself enough to say it out loud.

I hadn’t told a friend. I hadn’t told a therapist. I hadn’t written it in a note.

I had just thought it.

The caller’s voice softened.

“I’m calling ahead,” they said again. “I’m trying to help you stay in the script. Because if you go off-script tonight, they’re going to make it official.”

I finally found my voice.

“Who are you?” I asked.

A pause.

Then they said, almost gently, “You already know. You just don’t want to.”

And then, in the most normal tone in the world, like it was a routine part of the job, they asked:

“Are you safe right now, Joe?”

I didn’t answer right away.

Not because I didn’t have an answer.

Because the second you answer that question, you’re not just on a call anymore. You’re in a process. A fork in the road. Something that gets written down.

The caller waited. Patient. Like they already knew what I’d say and they were just letting me arrive at it on my own.

My mouth felt dry.

“I’m safe,” I said.

The caller hummed, like they were considering that. Like it was a weak argument.

“That’s the polite answer,” they said. “That’s the one you say because you like being the steady one.”

My hand went to the keyboard without me deciding to. I clicked the little internal chat window we use to flag weird calls to the floor lead.

It was greyed out.

Not “offline”. Not “try again.”

Greyed out like it had never existed.

I blinked at it and then looked around the room.

Everyone else was still on calls. Heads down. Typing. Nodding. The soft murmur of other voices. Normal.

I tried to tell myself it was a glitch. A permissions thing. A bad update.

The caller said, “Don’t look around. They can’t help you until it’s documented.”

“What do you want?” I asked.

“Do the questions,” they said, like we were back at the beginning. “Location. Supports. Means. Timeline.”

My stomach tightened.

“I’m not doing an assessment on myself,” I said.

“You already do,” they replied. “Every night. Quietly. In your head. I’m just putting it into the system.”

The way they said *the system* made it sound like a place. Not software. Not policy. A place you can end up.

I clicked mute.

A tiny icon changed on my screen. I watched it like it was a life raft.

The caller kept talking.

“Mute doesn’t stop this,” they said. “It just stops you from feeling like you’re heard.”

I stared at the mute icon. My finger hovered over it like I could force reality back into shape by clicking harder.

“How are you doing that?” I said.

“Calling ahead,” they replied. “You’re behind. You always are.”

My heart was doing that slow, heavy thud it does when I’m trying not to show anything on my face.

“Okay,” I said, carefully. “If you’re not in danger, and you’re calling to harass me, I’m ending the call.”

There was a pause.

Then the caller said, gently, “You can try.”

My cursor drifted to the end button again.

I could feel my hand shaking now. Not a lot. Enough.

The caller said, “You’re going to justify it to yourself first. ‘This is inappropriate.’ ‘This is outside protocol.’ ‘This isn’t a real caller.’”

My jaw clenched.

“That is what it is,” I said.

“And then,” they continued, “you’ll feel that little pinch in your chest because you’ll imagine the one time you hang up on a real person. The one time you get it wrong.”

My finger stopped a millimetre above the button.

Because they were right.

That’s the cruel part of this work. You can’t fully stop caring, because caring is the whole job. But caring is also a lever people can pull.

The caller’s voice softened again.

“I’m not trying to hurt you,” they said. “I’m trying to keep you from making it worse.”

“Worse than what?” I asked.

A beat.

Then they said, “Worse than being recorded.”

I looked at the top of my screen where the recording indicator sat. A tiny red dot. A comfort, usually. Proof that things happened the way you remember. Proof that you can be defended if someone says you did something you didn’t.

The caller said, “Go ahead. Open the transcript.”

We don’t usually have transcripts. Not live. Recordings are stored. Pulled later if needed. Nobody is out here making realtime subtitles of pain.

But there was a new tab.

I didn’t click it at first because I didn’t want it to be real.

Then my hand moved anyway.

A pane opened on the right side of my screen.

CALL TRANSCRIPT.

My name was already at the top as the responder.

Under it, in neat little time stamps, was everything that had been said so far.

Including things I hadn’t said out loud.

**\[00:04:12\] RESPONDER:** (thinks) *Don’t mess this up.*

My throat closed.

I scrolled.

**\[00:04:37\] RESPONDER:** (thinks) *If I hang up and he’s real, I’ll never forgive myself.*

I felt like I’d been caught naked in public.

The caller said, “There you go. Honest.”

I looked up from the transcript and realized something else.

The caller wasn’t labeled as CALLER.

The caller was labeled as RESPONDER too.

My hands went numb.

“That’s wrong,” I said.

“Is it?” the caller asked. “Read it.”

I read the line where they’d said my name.

It was tagged:

**RESPONDER.**

The line where they’d said *I’m calling ahead.*

**RESPONDER.**

The line where they’d said *You are.*

**RESPONDER.**

It was all coming from me, according to the system.

I backed out of the transcript like closing it would undo it.

The caller said, “You can’t close it now. It’s already saved.”

Across the room, someone laughed quietly at something their caller said. A normal human laugh in a normal human room.

I felt insane in the most clinical way. Like if someone walked up behind me right now and asked how my shift was going, I could answer politely and not show any of this on my face.

That’s the scariest kind of panic. The kind that looks functional.

I tried the transfer button.

It let me click. It made the sound. It brought up the list.

When I selected “Floor Lead”, it didn’t route.

It sent me back to myself.

My own greeting played in my ear.

“Thank you for calling,” my recorded voice said. “You’ve reached the crisis line. My name is Joe. What’s going on tonight?”

I pulled the headset off one ear like I could outrun audio.

The caller said, “There it is. Looping. You always loop when you’re scared.”

I looked down at my screen again.

A new notification had appeared in the corner. Bright little box. System tone.

**QUALITY ASSURANCE REVIEW INITIATED**

My stomach dropped.

I clicked it.

A form opened.

INCIDENT REPORT.

The fields were already filled out.

Not generic. Not blank.

Filled out in my cadence. My phrasing. My punctuation. The way I write when I’m trying to sound neutral and I’m actually trying to survive.

**Incident Type:** Staff safety concern  
**Description:** Responder presented with guarded affect and incongruent calm. Responder denied intent/plan but endorsed intrusive thoughts and fear of “making it official.” Responder demonstrated impaired use of supports (failed to access floor lead), repeated checking behaviors, and dissociative features (reported “looping” and transcript anomalies).  
**Interventions:** Responder prompted to follow protocol. Responder resisted. Responder continued to perform.  
**Recommendation:** Immediate supervisor consult. Remove from line. Do not leave alone.

I stared at the last line.

Do not leave alone.

The caller’s voice was quiet now. Almost kind.

“I’m calling ahead,” they said again. “Because you’re about to do what you always do.”

“What?” I whispered.

“Try to handle it yourself,” they said. “Try to stay calm. Try to look normal. Try to not be a problem.”

My hands were shaking hard enough now that I had to put them flat on the desk to stop them.

I glanced up.

My supervisor was standing across the room.

I hadn’t seen her walk out.

She wasn’t rushing. She wasn’t panicked.

She was just looking at me like she’d been expecting this tab to open all night.

And in my headset, my own voice played again, crisp and professional, like a recording from a training module.

“Are you safe right now, Joe?”

I didn’t answer. I just sat there with my hands flat on the desk like I was trying to hold myself in place.

My supervisor leaned in close enough that I could smell her coffee and said, quietly, like she was trying not to disturb the room, “Okay. We’re going to log you out now.”

My screen refreshed on its own. The incident report timestamp updated. The status changed from **DRAFT** to **SUBMITTED**.

Under *Caller ID* it didn’t say “Unknown.”  
It said my name.
