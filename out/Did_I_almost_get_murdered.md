Something pretty weird happened to me last July. I still don't know what to make of it.



My friend Johnny and I had to do summer school last year because we’re both idiots. Not like hopelessly stupid, but dumb enough.



Summer school was in the morning, five days a week. Our parents assumed that class lasted all day. We didn’t see the need to correct them. That meant we were free to do whatever we wanted during the afternoon, not that there's anything to do out here.



One day, we were playing with fireworks in a field near Johnny’s neighborhood. We’re idiots, like I said, and we didn’t stop to think about how it hadn’t rained all summer and that everything had gotten really dry. We were actually surprised when some of the grass caught fire.



The fire spread quickly: just a few embers at first, then a campfire-sized flame, then a wall of fire ripping across the field, black smoke spewing up. Soon the trees started catching.

 

“It’s really hot,” Johnny said.

 

It was. It seems obvious now, but that surprised me. Wildfires are really hot.

 

Johnny dropped the roman candle and ran away, and I stood there and watched him go, too shocked by it all to move.  Then I ran away too, but in the other direction, back toward Johnny's neighborhood.

 

It was a gigantic subdivision. All the houses looked the same—white house with red shutters, blue house with red shutters, white house with blue shutters . . . . I got lost. Then I started randomly cutting through yards and got even more lost. I was running through a backyard, fully panicking, when I noticed that some siding underneath a back deck had come loose. Without thinking, I dove headfirst into the gap.

 

It was dark under the deck, and I crawled as deep underneath as I could. The crawl space continued under the main house, which was built slightly above the ground. It was darker and more hidden there, almost pitch black, so I went that way, the soft, damp dirt squishing under my hands and knees,

 

As soon as I crawled under the house, though, I was hit by an awful, nauseating smell. Death: it's unmistakable. One time my family went away on vacation and a rat fell into a basement window well and starved to death. It was only one rat, but the whole basement stank of its rotting body by the time we got home: sour, musty, fecal, putrid—your body knows on a gut level to stay away.

 

This was way, way worse than one dead rat: the air under the house was thick with the smell, the way heat from a sauna hits you when you first walk in, coating my tongue and hanging heavily in the pitch black darkness all around me.



Before I could leave, a blue light glowed on. I froze—I thought I had seen a face somewhere out in the dark, but the light faded away before I could get a good look. I was unable to move until the light came back on, filling the crawl space with another brief, deep blue glow. Someone was definitely there, watching me. Too slowly, I took out my phone and unlocked it and shined a light at it.

 

It was a kid about my age. He was just kind of hanging out, sitting up against the foundation, his legs out in front of him, his head bent under a crossbeam.   The blue light was from his vape. It burned on every time he took a puff and made his whole face blue.



“Do you want some?” he asked, holding it out to me. He seemed unsurprised to see me there. I didn’t answer, and he shrugged and put the vape away in his windbreaker.

 

“My name’s Adam,” he said.

 

“What’s good,” I said automatically. Then, when I could get the words out:

 

“I didn’t mean to trespass. I’ll be going now."

 

“You can stay,” Adam said. “It’s not my place either.”

 

“It’s not?”

 

An emergency siren went by the house, then another. Adam smirked.  

 

“Are they looking for you?” he asked.

 

“Maybe.”

 

“Then stay if you want.”

 

I thought about it. I didn’t have any good options. So I stayed.

 

Adam’s vape had a stale, gamey taste, like old bubblegum, but it gave a good buzz. We passed it back and forth and talked, my phonelight shining up at the ceiling like a little lamp. Adam turned out to be pretty cool. He had grown up one town over and now lived in the city. He was trying to get this business started, something to do with crypto. I couldn’t follow all the details. His voice was very raspy, so it was hard to understand everything that he said.

 

I asked him why he was here, and he said this was a friend’s place, an older guy.



“Like an investor?”



“Sure,” Adam said.

 

There was a dark line around his neck, like a necklace, or maybe a bruise. He coughed and zipped up his windbreaker all the way, and I couldn’t see it anymore.

 

“Freezing down here,” he said.

 

"Yeah," I said, although it felt stuffy to me.

 

“What are you guys talking about?” somebody asked, out in the dark somewhere.

 

Jolted with fear, I grabbed my phone and shined the light around. There was another guy in the crawlspace, also our age, kind of chubby and wearing a baggy t-shirt. He was crawling toward us, a big smile on his face.

 

“Hey Eric,” Adam said, handing him the vape.

 

“Who’s the new kid?” Eric asked.

 

“Fugitive,” Adam said.

 

“Join the club,” Eric said, handing the vape to me.

 

“How many of you guys are down here?” I joked.

 

“Enough for a basketball game,” Eric said.

 

“Literally,” Adam said.

 

“Wanna meet our friend?” Eric asked. “The guy who lives upstairs. He’d buy us beer.”

 

“He’s generous,” Adam said.

 

“All we gotta do is knock,” Eric said. “There’s a trapdoor right there.”

 

I hadn’t noticed it, but there was a square trapdoor above us, the metal handle hanging down.

 

“You think he’s home now?” Adam wondered.

 

“We could really party,” Eric said. An earwig crawled over his hand, but he didn’t notice.

 

My buzz was wearing off, and I was hit by another wave of the rotting smell, stronger than ever. I thought I was going to pass out.

 

“You OK?” Adam asked.

 

“I should go,” I said weakly.

 

“You sure?” Eric asked. He had a bruise on his neck too, a big one running from his ear to his collar bone.

 

“Sorry.” I was already crawling out as fast as I could.

 

“See you later!”

 

And I was back out in the daylight, the smell fainter, then back on the sidewalk, running.

 

“Hey!” a deep voice shouted.

 

I turned around and saw a man standing in the driveway of the house I had just crawled out from under. My heart sank.

 

“Crazy out there right now, huh?” the man said. “All the sirens?”

 

He seemed friendly. He must not have seen me walking out of his backyard. He was washing his car, garden hose in his hand. A normal-looking guy in his 40s with a little mustache, his polo shirt tucked into his basketball shorts.

 

“Really crazy,” I said.

“What’s your name?” The guy was walking over to me. “I don’t think we’ve met. Where are you going?”

 

“Home,” I lied, and I ran down the sidewalk toward the noise of all the fire engines.

For the first time in his life, Johnny had done something smart: he had called the fire department. Because he had acted so quickly, they were able to put out the fire before any real damage could happen. The trees were fine. The grass would grow back. And everyone assumed that I had also tried to do the right thing, but had gotten lost while looking for help.

 

It was kind of funny. Everyone was pretty mad at us, but more than that, they were relieved that we had called 911. We had been *responsible*.

 

As for the kids in the crawlspace . . . I couldn’t even tell you what house I had hidden under. Blue with white shutters? It’s all a blur.

 

I tried searching for Eric and Adam online, but I only had their first names. I didn’t even know what I was searching for. A social page? An article about a missing kid?

 

There’s lot of missing kids out there. It’s freaky once you realize it. I even found one that kind of looked like Adam, but the hair was different. And there’s no way that could have been the same guy. Right?
