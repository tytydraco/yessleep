I woke up clawing madly at the air. Sweat soaked my clothes, and a half-finished scream died on my lips. I lay still for a moment, letting my heart rate settle. My cot groaned as I sat up and rubbed the pale crescents left by my fingernails from my palms. I’d had the dream again. The last time I had it was back in high school. I ran my fingers through disheveled hair, and wondered what dredged up this unpleasant memory. I took some deep breaths to calm down before checking my watch. I was late.

 

I rushed through a half-assed version of my morning routine in my small tent. Breakfast was nearly over, and while I didn’t mind foregoing what the cook assured me were once eggs, there was no way I was missing out on the most exciting thing we’d done since travelling to the valley and hacking a trail through the sprawling thicket of acacia trees over 2 months ago: the opening of the tomb.

 

Hopping through my tent’s flapping door, boots still unlaced, I saw the line of archaeologists filing out of the dining tent on the opposite side of camp. I cinched the last knot on my boots and double-timed it across the sand and loose rock, hoping I hadn’t forgotten anything important in my haste. The green field notebook I started in Cairo bounced reassuringly inside my cargo pocket. It documented our expedition from the trek through the desert and rocky valleys of western Egypt to the discovery of the tomb; there was no way I’d forget it now.

 

Rushing past the dining tent, I saw Jorge bringing up the tail end of the crowd.

 

“Hey, Derrick, what’s the rush, big guy?” He asked before stuffing a powdered doughnut into his mouth. “I told Felix not to wait up for you.”

 

“Why didn’t you wake me up when you walked by my tent this morning?” I ignored his question.

 

“Don’t be sore at me.” He held up his hands in mock defense. “You were making a racket in there so loud, I didn’t want to find out what it was about.”

 

“You, uh… You heard that, huh?”

 

“Half the camp heard you,” he said, gesturing as he spoke the way New Yorkers do.

 

“Great.” I rolled my eyes. Looking through the throng of people meandering to the tomb entrance, I caught a glimpse of something red and decided to cut the conversation short.

 

“Look man, I’ll catch up with you later. Maybe tonight we can get out the deck of cards.”

 

“Yeah, OK. But you’re still down 3 hands.” He shouted after me as I disappeared into the crowd slowly advancing toward the dig site. I sped along, weaving around the slower members of the expedition until I saw the familiar head of red hair, bobbing as she walked.

 

“Sam!” I shouted, hurrying past a few disapproving glances. She turned and flashed me her too-big smile. Sam was the first member of the expedition I met back in Cairo. I hadn’t expected the girl with Auburn hair in an evening dress to have anything more than a casual interest in archaeology, but as our conversation became more nuanced and I noticed the rough tips of her fingernails and small callouses on her hands, I realized I was dealing with someone more serious.

 

“Derrick? Where on earth have you been? I saved you some breakfast.” She handed me one of the twin packs of donuts.

 

“No dehydrated eggs?” I asked with a crooked smile.

 

“Not this morning, no. It’s a real shame, isn’t it? But if you like, I can bring you some more donuts, on the house.”

 

“Naw,” I said, agonizing over an imaginary menu. “How about some biscuits and gravy?”

 

“That’s disgusting,” she grimaced.

 

“Our biscuits and gravy are different than yours.”

 

“I still can’t imagine they’d be any good.” Sam rolled her eyes. “Anyway, this is the day we’ve been waiting for all summer!”

 

She hardly needed to tell me. Ever since the team uncovered the first step cut into the valley floor, we wondered what awaited us at the bottom. I never experience anything more suspenseful than wondering what rested just beneath the next shovelful of sand. That is, until the day I was working with Sam at the bottom of the narrow stairway, and she uncovered the top of a stone slab marked with clay seals.

 

“The seal of the Royal Necropolis Guards,” she muttered in awe.

 

We thought we’d have our first look inside the same day, but the expedition organizers insisted one of them be present to supervise. The next few days passed at an agonizingly slow pace while we waited.

 

“Did what’s his name finally show up?” I asked between bites of the donut. Sam sighed.

 

“His name is James, and yes, he arrived on site this morning. He gave a short, err... speech, before we left the dining tent.”

 

“What kind of speech?”

 

“It was all rot, really. Reminders not to disturb artifacts in their context, leaving everything untouched until photographed, oh, and something about archaeology needing dedicated scholars and not adventure seekers.”

 

“He sounds pleasant.”

 

“Show some respect, Derrick. He might not be all fun and games, but he is something of an authority in the Egyptological society. Also, you’ve met him before.”

 

“When?”

 

“During orientation in Cairo, you numpty. Don’t you remember? He was the posh-looking one who gave the introduction, and… well, I suppose that was about it, really.”

 

“How could I forget?” I grinned, smacking my forehead.

 

Sam didn’t look amused, but in all honesty, I struggled to put a name together with the face. We’d only been in the field for nine weeks, but Cairo felt like it was a lifetime ago. Professor Ossendorf, the man who gave the majority of the presentation, had been hard to forget, with his portly stature, numerous guffaws, and habit of making jokes. Unfunny as they were, they still occupied more of my memory than the quiet man, leaning against the wall in his tailored suit.

 

Our conversation abruptly ended as the narrow confines of the staircase brought us shoulder to shoulder with the other archaeologists. The air danced with mites of sand carried by the breeze over the top of the plywood retaining wall. We constructed it to keep sand from filling the trench we spent so much time excavating. As the lumbering crowd neared the bottom of the pit, I caught a glimpse of a vaguely familiar man I took to be James, along with a few men I didn’t recognize, snapping pictures of him beside the slightly ajar stone slab. It hadn’t been that way when I  walked through the dig site with Sam the evening before. I distinctly remembered the clay seals, baked solid by millennia in the desert, being affixed to the edges, but now they were absent, and a tantalizing ribbon of darkness peeked at us from around the edge of the slab. A cool, pungent odor wafted through this opening, filling our noses with a smell similar to tree resins mixed with the interior of a cave.

 

James spoke to the men with the cameras, too far away for me to hear anything distinct, before they turned to leave. As they squeezed their way through the crowd, he turned to face us. He wore clothes that weren’t even a little bit dirty, along with a smug look. I couldn’t decide how old he was. His features looked like those of someone young, but his greying hair told another story. I didn’t have time to dwell on any of this before he began a speech similar to the one Sam summarized to me on our walk to the site.

 

“Remember,” he said, assuming the tone of a lecturer. “This is the initial examination of the tomb. Any artefacts can be cataloged and prepared for transport after the layout is known. To reiterate: don’t touch, and for God’s sake, don’t move anything. Now, let’s get this door all the way open.” He gestured to a few of the men close to him, but offered no help shoving the massive stone aside. Somewhere behind me, a camera flashed as stone grinded against stone, and the narrow crack grew into a rectangular passageway. Cold air drifted by us. The pungent smell was overpowering. Sunlight revealed little of the interior past the thick curtain of cobwebs dangling from the ceiling.

 

James gestured for us to follow him as he crept into the tomb. One by one, our team slipped into the darkness behind him. Sam and I exchanged looks of excitement as we inched closer to the tomb entrance. Her too-big smile was contagious. I don’t think I’ve ever been as excited as I was taking that first step into the inky blackness of the tomb with Sam.

 

Our headlamps trembled with excitement as we looked at our surroundings. Most of the cobwebs were brushed away from the center of the passageway, giving us a fairly unobstructed view of our surroundings. We passed through a small antechamber, about the size of a large closet before following our team up a sloping passageway. It was roughly the same width as the staircase leading to the tomb, the only exception being the buttresses interrupting the passage at regular intervals. Each time we passed through one of these, Sam and I had to squeeze close together; I didn’t mind. Beneath the thick dust covering the walls, our headlamps revealed hints of hieroglyphs, waiting all these centuries to tell their secrets.

 

The next chamber was about twenty feet by twenty feet, and already crowded by the people in front of us. Murmurs of amazement echoed as Sam and I drifted apart in the sparsely furnished room. Like the antechamber and corridor leading up to it, the stonemasons’ skill was on full display. Two more stone doors stood, covering chambers to the eastern and western sides of the chamber. I was surprised the only artefacts waiting for us were the clay lamps sitting in the corners, but the mosaics glimmering through dusty cobwebs more than made up for it. I knew better than to wipe away the dust with my bare hands, but the temptation was never stronger as the blues and golds glimmered in the beam of my headlamp. As I stood in front of one of the more sparsely covered mosaics, trying to make out whether I was looking at a field of wheat or a reed boat, I heard Sam calling for me.

 

I looked to the opposite side of the chamber and saw her, dust smudged over the freckled bridge of her nose, waving for me to join her. I weaved around the other archaeologists milling around, I passed James, lost in thought, staring at one of the mosaics. My curiosity about what Sam wanted turned to concern when I noticed the hole in the wall behind her.

 

“Look what I’ve found,” Sam said, beaming as she gestured to the face-sized hole. It was eye level for me, but a few inches higher than her head. My first thought was concern. The rest of the tomb was so carefully crafted, this seemed out of place.

 

“Should I get James or Felix? If there’s structural damage to the tomb, we’ll need to reinforce the wall.” Sam waved her hand dismissively.

 

“It’s not ‘structural damage,’ it’s a serdab. It was built into the tomb.”

 

“Why?”

 

Sam smirked. I thought she was going to start with one of her comparisons between Archaeologists and Egyptologists, but was relieved when she just answered my question.

 

“It’s a way for what Ancient Egyptians believed was a person’s spirit, or life force, the ka as they called it, to travel to and from the Statue inside. Can you give me a lift? I want to have a look inside, and I’m not quite as tall as you, am I?”

 

I looked at James. He was still transfixed by whatever he was looking at.

 

“Alright, but let’s make this quick. I don’t want Mr. Ministry of Antiquities over there to see us.”

 

Sam stood in front of the serdab, and I lifted her up by her waist. She put her face nearly inside the hole. I looked around at the other archaeologists milling around, surprised none of them noticed what we were doing.

 

“Can you see anything?”

 

“Yes, wonderful things.” Her voice came to me as a muffled echo.

 

“Alright, Mr. Carter, can we revisit this later?”

 

“There’s definitely a ka statue inside, but it’s quite dirty,” she said, pulling her head from the hole. “Nothing a good Hoovering out won’t fix.”

 

After setting Sam back on the floor, I looked inside at the statue. Like everything else, it was covered in dusty cobwebs, obscuring its appearance. It looked vaguely humanoid, but the proportions seemed off somehow. The eye sockets glimmered as they caught the light from my headlamp. Pulling my head from the serdab, I realized it was placed so the statue could keep watch over the entrance, and wondered when it last witnessed anyone step inside the tomb.

 

We spent most of that day cleaning, carefully brushing cobwebs and dust curtains from the ceiling and walls. Each brushstroke revealed more of the breathtaking mosaics and columns of hieroglyphs. The builders’ craftsmanship was on full display, every joint where stones met was perfect, walls were more smooth and level than some I’d seen in modern buildings. This made it all the more noticeable when I encountered the first of the chisel marks, obscuring a small section of hieroglyphs. I didn’t think much of it at first. Mistakes happen. Maybe a stonemason’s chisel slipped, or someone accidentally hit the wall while carrying something. This came into question, as we uncovered several more similarly damaged glyphs. Some were effaced more methodically, a rectangular chasm blotting out the space and I wondered if these specific words were stricken out intentionally and, if so, for what purpose.

 

Normally, I would have just asked Sam, but she was busy working in a different group, photographing hieroglyphs and mosaics. I wanted to join her, but a combination of my absence from James’ morning meeting and his discovery of my lack of experience in Egyptian archaeology led to me being assigned the lesser task of sweeping while the “real Egyptologists” worked. I still managed to steal glances of both Sam and the art covering the walls throughout the day.

 

I spent part of that day helping Jorge, make a 3-dimensional model of the inside of the tomb with the R.O.V. Like me, he wasn’t an Egyptologist, but rather a robotics student field testing a concept. I couldn’t help smiling as other members of the team complained about not being able to open the next chambers in the tomb until Jorge’s contraption finished scanning the chapel.

 

“It’s not fair we have to wait while he plays around with his robot,” someone whined.

 

Jorge ignored them as the three foot long, cigar shaped R.O.V. trucked along on its rubber tracks, slowly gathering data. The way he told it, the R.O.V.  was originally meant for a project called “Scan Pyramids”, but it ended up getting delayed and eventually disqualified from participating.

 

“Why didn’t they want it?” I asked. “These 3-D models look great.”

 

“Too heavy,” he grinned, slapping his gut good naturedly. “They ended up going with something smaller, less capable at image gathering but light and thin enough to pass through smaller nooks and crannies.”

 

By the time we completed the scans, there was only enough time left that day to open one of the chambers. I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t somewhat disappointed when we opened the chamber to the east, only to reveal no mummy. Sam called this chamber a ‘Store Room’, basically a place for the interred to store their earthly possessions for the afterlife. The rest of the afternoon was a barrage of camera flashes as the team carefully tagged artifacts before storing them in rugged Pelican cases for their journey to the Egyptological Society for study. Sam was overjoyed when a wooden case containing several scrolls was found in the back of the chamber, behind a senet board and oil lamps. However, it was a bittersweet discovery. She wouldn’t be able to examine any of their delicate writings, not here in the field. It was likely she would never see them unrolled firsthand unless she was lucky enough to secure a position at the Egyptian Museum handling ancient documents.

 

Near the end of the day, James left to send a report to the Ministry of Antiquities, giving me a chance to look around the chamber Sam called ‘the Chapel.’ I didn’t intent to stay so late when I volunteered to put the lights out, but after pushing around a broom all day while everyone else did the ‘real work,’ I figured I earned the right to look around. I was admittedly a novice with hieroglyphs, but the murals were more transparent in their meaning. Although I was missing much of their context, it didn't detract from my satisfaction looking at images of reed boats sharing the Nile with fish and crocodiles, or the group of soldiers cutting their way through papyrus with sickle shaped swords on the river banks. Beneath the water’s surface was a much different scene. Vague human outlines gazed upward like damned souls, as if preying upon those above, floating down the river, unaware of the horrors beneath them. I shuddered when I noticed the dark outline of a female form, rowing a boat underwater, beckoning to those trapped beneath its waves. I snapped a picture of this before leaving.

 

I turned off the work lights in the Chapel before heading to the tomb exit. My headlamp flickered, and its beam bobbed with each footstep down the passageway. Buttressed walls cast long shadows over the columns of text and scenes of Egyptian religious ceremonies. Despite their simplicity, the depictions of mummification unsettled me. I’ve never considered myself superstitious, but I was alone in a tomb after all, and the images of the lost souls under the river were still fresh in my mind. They dredged up memories of the time I almost drowned. A memory which until that morning, I thought I’d stopped having nightmares about.

 

Long rays of daylight stretching into the passageways from outside comforted me as I neared the stairway. I was almost outside. Switching my headlamp off, I tried focusing on what I might do at camp that evening. Grab something to eat, make an entry about my day in my field notebook, maybe email my family from the communications tent. I had to be selective with any pictures I decided to attach. The site’s remote location in a secluded valley might have protected it from looters and grave robbers through the centuries, but it also meant communications to the outside world were slow, unreliable, and subject to size limitations.

 

My feelings of relief evaporated when a long, thin shadow obscured the light from outside. It looked humanoid, taking halted steps down the staircase, but it startled me enough I froze at the foot of the sloping passageway. The shadowy figure reached the threshold of the tomb, and before they could take a hesitant step inside, screamed. I almost responded with a yell of my own before realizing it was only Sam.

 

“What the bloody hell are you still doing in here, Derrick?”

 

I sighed in relief, realizing I’d been holding my breath.

 

“I was photographing some of the mosaics,” I said. “I must have got sidetracked after volunteering to shut the lights off. Anyway, I was just heading back to camp.”

 

Sam held her hand to her chest.

 

“Well, you’ve given me quite a fright just now.”

 

“Sorry about that. What are you doing back here so late?”

 

“I was sat in the dining tent and wanted to look over my notes from today.” She opened the backpack over her shoulder and rifled around before pulling out an empty hand.

 

“But I must have left them behind, maybe while I was cleaning out the serdab. I was about to go in and find them.” She paused a moment. “Would you mind terribly coming along with me? It’s just that-”

 

“That you’re afraid to be alone in the dark, scary tomb,” I taunted her as if I hadn’t just been terrified walking down the passageway.

 

“Of course! It’s creepy in there, you numpty.”

 

“You’re telling me.”

 

Sam smiled as she tucked a few stray hairs behind her ear.

 

“Please, won’t you come with me?”

 

“Only if you share your notes with me when we get back to camp,” I stepped to the side so we could both walk up to the chapel.

 

“It’s a deal.” With that, we turned and ventured back into the tomb.

 

“Sorry about calling you a numpty, by the way,” she said as we walked.

 

“Was that supposed to be offensive?” I still didn’t grasp Sam’s British slang, and after asking her to explain some of it at camp one night, I doubted I ever would.

 

“Only a bit,” she said with a small smile. “You haven’t seen James lately, have you?”

 

“I haven’t seen him since we opened the store room,” I said. “Or at least, not since we catalogued the scrolls.” I had no idea what I did that day, but I seemed to have made something of an enemy out of our Project Officer. He seemed incapable of speaking in anything but criticisms, going as far as criticizing the way I swept the floor at one point. All that said, I developed a habit of keeping an eye out for him.

 

“He must still be in his tent. He’s really ‘taken ownership’ of this project since we opened the store room,” Sam said with finger quotes, mocking James’ corporate jargon.

 

Our jokes died as we crossed the threshold into the dark chapel. Our headlamps illuminated narrow swaths of the chamber as we picked our path around Pelican cases, extension cords, and work lights. I wanted to switch one of them on to help in our search, but Sam insisted our headlamps were good enough. I dropped the subject and followed her to the serdab. I scanned the floor along the way, looking around pieces of equipment and inside coils of cables but found nothing.

 

“You didn’t put it in a Pelican case by mistake, did you?”

 

“No, I wouldn’t have done that,” she said, shining her light toward the serdab. She walked over to the hole in the wall and stood on her tiptoes. Sam sighed, perhaps frustrated her eyes came up just short of the opening, before plunging her hand inside. Her face was pensive as she searched blindly in the hole. I picked a path around the equipment cluttering the room. I was tall enough I could just look inside and save her some trouble.

 

I was almost there when Sam’s face lit up.

 

“Found it!” Her too-big smile spread across her face as she thrust her hand deeper into the hole. “I must have set it-”

 

Sam’s screams echoed off the stone walls. She jerked her hand from the serdab, slinging a mass of writhing legs through the air. It landed with a meaty smack, somewhere out of sight. Sam clutched a bleeding hand to her chest and leaned against the wall.

 

“What the hell was that thing?” I shouted. My headlamp whipped around the room as I frantically searched. Somewhere in the darkness, it skittered across the stone floor. Sam screamed again. I followed her headlamp’s beam to the biggest scorpion I’d ever seen. It writhed on its back, mere feet from where we stood, trying to flip itself upright. I needed a weapon, but saw nothing within reach. Contorting its back and thick tail in a sickening way, it plopped back onto its feet.

 

I cast all caution to the wind and lunged at it. Legs writhed, and the stinger jabbed at my leather boot. It wriggled as I ground it under my heel. There was a wet crunch as its stinger, legs, and snapping pinchers bolted out straight before going limp.

 

I turned to see Sam leaning against the wall, a listless expression on her face.  

 

“Sam!”

 

I rushed to her side as her eyelids closed and she slid to the floor under the serdab. She was unconscious but still breathing. I needed to get her back to camp.

 

I looked up at the dark hole in the wall above us. I had no idea what else was hiding inside, and didn’t want to find out. Sam flopped lifelessly in my arms as I heaved her over my shoulder. I gave the tomb a parting glance to satisfy myself nothing else was waiting to strike. My headlamp didn’t reveal the bioluminescent glow of any scorpions, but instead the ka statue’s faintly glowing red eyes.

 

I shuddered and hurried down the passageway, trying not to trip or bump Sam into the buttressed walls as I struggled to rationalize what I just saw. Her wounded hand dangled in front of my face, already swollen from the venom. Veins like purple spiderwebs radiated from the hole ripped by the stinger, dripping blood on both me and the tomb floor.
