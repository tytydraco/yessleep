The strange letter- part 2


Part one-  https://reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/ql8llzXalu

Hey guys, thanks for the support. I decided to go to the library like you guys adviced. Took a lot of courage. Here's what happened throughout the day.

I enter the library, feeling nervous, before this incident I always felt elevated whenever I came here. This place would take away all my dread and now, ironically, it was the source of it.

"Hey Mike" said Sarah who was sitting next to Sua and Harjit. These three have been my library bestfriends. We met through the library and since then we come here everyday, sharing our thoughts on various books with each other. 

I asked them about the incident, explaining what happened after 4pm, but they all looked clueless. "Hey Mike, about what you said yesterday, I think maybe you're just stressed out, you need a break." Said Sarah in a concerned low tone. 
"Sarah, I'm fine, let's not think too much about yesterday." I told her. 

I had a plan, I had a micro camera attached to my shirt today. Since they didn't believe me, I'll prove it to them after today. I even carried a weapon (small pocket knife) incase I ever needed it.

 I open the book sent by the anonymous gifter. It didn't have a title, which puzzled me. Nevertheless, the book looked alluring with its Merlot color, tinted with earthlight gold at its sides. How mysterious. The book was also similar to my situation, the protagonist felt a sense of vellichor when passing through the vintage bookshop next to his new house. As he decides to explore the place, he soon regrets his decision. 

As expected a new letter had mysteriously arrived, I opened it up. 
"Dear Sam, you must not look at the visitor's eyes." 
An easy task. I could do that. The clock hit four and the procedure took place. People stared walking around like zombies across the room. Soon everyone stopped and made a line. The door creaked, it seemed as if someone had come inside. 

From far away i could make out a black silhouette which came closer and closer. Whoever this person was, clearly had some malevolent motives. It had this undeniably strong aura to it. 
"Everyone look at me, right into my eyes." Said the figure. I maintained my calm and lowered my gaze.

 The figure came closer to me, "thump thump thump" came the footsteps along with it. My heart almost skipped a beat. The figure was covered in dark clothing and a thick mask. Only their red eyes visible. I managed not to look at them too much. The figure stopped. 
 
"Everyone, look at the bowl at the corner of the room. A blade is next to it. You must put three drops of your blood inside it. No more, no less." Said the figure. 

A line was formed as everyone took turns adding their blood. I was at the far end trying to decide whether it would be a good idea to do it or not. Afterall I had no other choice then to add my blood into in. I took a deep breath as I ran the blade through the palm of my hand. Pearly red droplets of blood formed. I squeezed my hand causing more blood to flow out adding three droplets into the bucket. I felt dizzy. After everyone was done with it, the library went back to normal. 

"Ouch I have a cut on my hand" screamed Sarah. "Stop being dramatic, you prolly got a paper cut " said Sua. "Looks too deep for a paper cut" Sarah exclaimed. "Actually, I have one too" Harjit said, "How funny I don't remember getting hurt either." 
"Sarah is on to something. No one randomly gets hurt that much. I even have a video to prove something is wrong " I told them. Come to my house at 8, I'll show it to you guys.

Guys, it's 6 pm currently. I'm on my way home. I'm going to watch the recording I took through my camera. I'll update you guys on what happens. Hopefully everything goes well and my friends finally realise what I told them is true. 


Update:

I went to my house and tried opening the recording. Something very weird happened. The video wasn't there. I rechecked again and again. I could barely breathe. "Calm down, calm down" I told myself. I opened again Just to see a strange video uploaded. 

I opened the strange video, hoping it's nothing unusual. There it was the masked figure from earlier right on my screen, my screen starts glitching. I feel my hands tremble. I let out a scream. "I'm always watching you" says the figure" through my screen. Lights turn on and off. On and off.

I turn around and look everywhere. On my screen comes a live recording of me. I see my self completely breaking down right infront of my eyes. "I am being recorded, I am being recorded, help" I scream. I look for the camera everywhere in my room, I fail to notice it. 
I still had my pocket knife from earlier in my pocket, I run away from my room as fast as I could.

It's been five minutes since this happened. If anything happens to me, this post is proof of it.  I COULD SEE MY SELF ON MY SCREEN, SOMEONE HAS BEEN SPYING ON ME SINCE GOD KNOWS WHEN.
I am hiding in my basement, I have called the police. See you.
