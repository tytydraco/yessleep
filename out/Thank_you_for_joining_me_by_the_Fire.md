  

Take it in.

(deep breath)

“What.. scares you?”

Shh… I know… I know.

I’ll go then. Do you want to know what scares me? I get scared by …. Loud noises.. Isn’t that great! Oh.. I see your confusion. “Great,” can be bad too. It can be used as an adjective. It describes a noun. 

Sorry, I know. I don’t mean to give you an English Lit lesson. You’re old enough.. I think. 

Don’t you want to be here? Look around you.. LOOK. The woods, the fire.. the quiet. Shit, THIS is paradise! It’s not a cheeseburger. It’s not on a beach. Although I suppose everyone has their own version of paradise. There was a town called Paradise in the state I grew up in.. hmm.. another story for another time. If you don’t look. I will make you.

“Good. I appreciate you.”

(deep breath)

Better. Thank you. I can see in your green eyes.. I can see. I don’t even have to grab a fistful of that fair blond hair to direct your gaze.. Green eyes are the rarest color of all. Did you know that? I guess if you thought about it, stastically, brown would obviously be most popular. Which I have. I hate it. It’s so boring, and weak. But you…. You have that 2%. Two percent of the WORLD has green eyes. Did you appreciate it?

“Shh.. I don’t expect you to..” 

“Please stop making noise. It exacerbates my misophonia” Sorry to put up so many big words. I hate to see that fear in your eyes. Those pretty green eyes. But.. also, stop. OK? Ok.

Perfect. Just be silent. That’s all I ever asked. Look around, and appreciate. Isn’t this nice? The sun is just coming down. I purposely put us in a camp site in the most western part of the campground. I wanted you to see the big ball of fire in allllll her glory, dip underneath the horizon.

“You’re not a flat earther, are you?”

Of course not. I’m just joshing. Hmm. Where does that saying come from? Ah, who knows. Oh… do you know?

“I’ll take the tape off.. but if you say anything about.. ANYTHING, but the question I asked.. it’ll”

Ok, she understands.

(deep breath)

(Controlling her breathing)  Yes… I … Uh…. It’s a phrase from….. like… a long time ago. I don’t remember his actual… name, but it was J.. It was Josh of course… and he minted some coins that looked similar and made some… made some money, and…

“Ok, tape goes back in.”

Shit, I ask you one simple question. It was a yes or no question.   
 “oh, whats that? I asked you to expound?” Oh, I… I wish you didn’t say that. Breathe through your nose.. Look at the fire. Sorry, please at the very least enjoy this campfire.

I didn’t ask you shit. Let’s be clear. I just wanted you to enjoy the fire. Isn’t it nice? You can’t manufacture that crackling. You can look up some YouTube “fireplaces,” or even light some candles that have that “crackling,” wick. But.. it won’t be the same. Have you ever sat by a campfire? A bonfire, even? Funny thing.. a bonfire has a sinister root… it’s from the ancients. When they ki-

(looking down at my left hand)

Why has this hurt all day.. there is a sizeable wound on my thumb. I must have felt this all day. Where did this come from? It hurts. I don’t remember where this came from? It’s already starting to scab over. I didn’t hit anything.. I didn’t strike anything.. I didn’t bite a… oh

Now I remember… I think. Yes.. now I remember. That last one.. the one by the fire. The last one. Put up a bit of a fight. I was bit. Once bitten… and all of that.

“Excuse me. I have to wrap this. All that I ask is that you remain quiet.”

Good girl.

Much better. So, as I was saying.. Where was I? Ah, yes, the fire. I see your panic. It’s going to allll be ok. I promise.

“Weiner?” No? Ok.. suit yourself. They’re good though. It’s part of the bonfire experience. 

Oh, I wish I could end this right now. Don’t you get that? You weren’t meant to last this long. I guess… I suppose… I like you. Hell, you might even survive this.. Probably not, but .. you might. If you play your cards right..

(Laughing, to myself..)  (Shh) (Deeeep breath)

Ahh, good. Quietness is next to godliness. Or.. is it cleanliness? No. That’s a bullshit saying. I’ve known plenty of dirty people that worshiped the Jewish King. They believed wholeheartedly. As they should. As I do. But I appreciate your candor. And your decibel level. I did tell you I have a noise.. thing. Thank you for respecting that.

Damnit this hurts. Can you remember how this happened? I was telling the other one about the fire…. We laughed over something about Kurt Cobain… well, I laughed.. and then she- Oh. No. Now I remember. I nicely took her gag off and loosened her handcuffs. And she took that opportunity to bolt. What an attempt. Got my hand good, I’ll give her that..

“Hmm.. I just realized I was probably saying most of that out loud. Maybe all of it. By the look on your face, I can tell.”

Shh

Relax. 

“I’m not going to hurt you. Are you sure you don’t want a hog dog? I’ve got the best for this fire. Hebrew National. Yumm, truly the best.”

NO? Ok.. but again.. you just don’t know what you’re missing. And yes, I realize that I told the last one that nathans famous was the best brand of grocery store bought hot dog. I really do love Nathans. But, can you keep a secret? *Hebrew national makes the best dog..* Shh.. .don’t tell anyone I told you that.

Please don’t.. I see the tears streaming from your eyes. Are you sad? Is it the smoke? I can move you, if you like?

No.. ok.. ok. Shh.. please just breathe. I’ll do it with you.

(deeeeeep breath)

As I really stare into this fire.. It makes me think. Why do I keep doing this. You’re not the first. And certainly, won’t be the last. I wish you would be the last. But I’m not naïve. I also know my limitations. Actually, now that I think about it. This is kind of your fault. The very first one was a super accident. The next… well, they were more planned… but you..

“Oh, nice. Look at those plump dogs. I actually thought ahead too. I got buns! Hot dog buns. You didn’t think we would eat some fire-roasted wieners with just our hands, did you? Come on, what do I look like? Just joshing.. don’t answer that. Oh, that reminds me.”

I’m going to take the tape off again. I’m saying this again, PLEASE, please don’t make me regret it. Not a second time. For one, I’d like you to eat. For TWO… I want to hear the rest of the “Joshing,” story.

.. there. Better. So hot dog or story. You’re choice.

..(controlling her breathing again) Thank you.. That was starting to hurt. But I apologize and thank you again. Can I finish the joshing story?

“Sure.”

So, there really isn’t much more to it than I mentioned earlier. A guy named Josh in like the 1800s noticed that nickels and 5 dollar coins looked the same. So, he minted a nickel and made it look like 5 dollars. Back in those days, that was a lot of money that you could grift. And his name became kind of synonymous with lying, after he was caught, you see. “Ha.. just joshing…. Right?”

Deep breath….. You did good.

(Deep breath from her)

“You’re a good storyteller. The dogs have cooled. I’ll feed you yours. I’m not going to take off your restraints, you understand? Good. I appreciate how well you’ve adapted to this. Hey, might even make it out tonight.. Only a few hours until the sun comes back up.”

So, I only have mustard. I will not tolerate you putting ketchup on a hot dog. Look, do whatever you want in your own time. I like ketchup just as much as the next guy. I just don’t think it belongs on Nathan’s or Hebrew National. Call me crazy.

Hmm.. That’s a good bite. That’s a really good first bite. Ok, ok, I won’t’ push it. Look.. I’m putting it back down on the plate. I’ll leave your mouth free for now. Just don’t forget the rules. I can’t have any loud noises.

(deep exhale)

What should I do with you now. It’s not really a question. Just a statement. I can’t let you go. You know that. But I don’t want to end this. I suppose I’ll open it up to the floor. Go ahead, you can speak.

Sure. . I understand that. I think you brought up some good points. And I’m considering it. I think my mind has been made up. Unfortunately. For you. But hey, we can still enjoy the fire. Just keep looking at it. So hypnotic. Let me continue to look into the reflection into those green eyes of yours. It’s very pretty. The fire.. I mean.

Oh boy. You made me put a lot of work into this one. Good thing I planned ahead and brought that shovel. Not quite six feet, but deep enough. You can rest easy now, knowing that no one will find you for quite some time. I did plan on that. I think. Did I put you by the rest? I hope not. Last thing I need is for whomever that does eventually find you to find everyone else. A mass grave.. that’ll raise some eyebrows. It’ll make the front page of the news and the internet. I can see the headlines now. *Potential serial killer burial ground?* And they will have a field day with that one. They’ll go looking high and low for me. If they really want, they could find me. But I don’t know if people will care enough. After all, you didn’t have any actual loved ones.. except for me. Please rest easy, knowing that someone in this terrible world cared.

“Damnit, my hand hurts. I hope this is the last time. Maybe it will be. Or maybe I’m just full of shit. I can’t tell anymore. After I change the dressing and lay down for a moment.. it’ll become clearer to me. I’ll miss you sweetheart. You were the one.”
