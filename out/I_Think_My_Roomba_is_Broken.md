So, I’m writing here because I’m not quite sure where else to write about my problems at this moment. Let me start at the beginning.

A few weeks back, I got myself a Roomba, not an actual Roomba brand thing, but just one of those cleaning robots from a tech brand no one’s heard of that’s half the price with just the same or more functions, but Roomba is fun to say, so I just call it that anyway.

For the first long while, it was working great. I ran it at night so I would be able to reduce my overall vacuuming without having it be underfoot all day. Something I personally had to get used to was its activation.

Upon starting the cleaning program, the robot will loudly announce “Beginning Standard Clean” in a high-pitched, feminine, robotic voice before running through the whole house. As you can imagine, the first time it happened, I nearly jumped out of my skin, but I got used to it as time went on.

It would also bump into doors a lot, a slightly less but still unnerving sound to hear in the middle of the night until you get used to it, but after the first few days, it had the house fully mapped out. It knew what doors were normally closed or opened and ran well, but the voice still continued, though it no longer spooked me.

The issues started during the last hurricane that came through my town recently. The winds weren’t too bad, but that rain was killer. Luckily, I sit on a local maximum for the surrounding properties, meaning it almost never floods more than an inch in the absolute deepest parts of my yard.

I put my cats up in their closet to keep them from messing around or getting outside, and waited it out. Within the first day, the power was out, and although the storm passed over the night after, I continued to lack power for almost three whole days.

Once it was finally back on, and I didn’t have to manage my generator anymore, I got to walk around my property to check for any damage. Nothing was too badly messed up, a few shingles here, a loose board there, simple things, until I got to my garage.

I hadn’t checked it at all because I don’t really do anything in my garage, especially during hurricane season, but entering it to check it out, I cursed myself as I saw the mistake I had made.

During my pre-storm run-through, I had slightly cracked my garage door, so it would be less hot and miserable while I was grabbing a few of the old propane lanterns I had stashed in there, and it appeared as though I had forgotten to put it back down.

I had done something similar during a heat wave once, and the rodents that got in within just the day I had it open then gave me grief for months. I can’t imagine what got in over three days during a hurricane.

Closing the door and electing to deal with that later, I finished my rounds, let my cats out, and went to dinner, coming back later that night and crashing in front of my box fan and next to my window AC, which were now finally running.

Now I want to state that at this point the Roomba was still running fine, a couple of my electronics got messed up by the outage, but this first night it ran like a dream, did everything it was supposed to, same routine, though it did hit one door, but checking the next day I saw that it was just the door to my bonus room that got left open, thankfully my cats didn’t go up there, they normally love going up stairs but hate going back down them and their a pain to grab.

After this, the next few nights were also normal.

It wasn’t until around four days after the storm, I had been woken up by the voice that normally announced the beginning of the machine’s work, in my tired ears though, it sounded as though it only said “Clean,” and something seemed wrong with the speaker, like when you drop your phone in water and the audio get’s messed up until it dries out. I determined I’d just check it out in the morning and went back to sleep.

I don’t know how much longer it was until I was woken up by the sound of the voice once again stating “Beginning Standard Clean.” I rolled over and checked my phone, seeing that it was four in the morning, the normal time it’s supposed to go off. Getting up to go check on it, I saw the machine going as normal at the beginning of its cycle, the ruffles in the carpet showing that it had also gone off before when the sound played previously, and it wasn’t just my imagination, that carpet always ruffles when something goes across it.

This was just more for me to check in the morning when the cleaning was done, at that point, my mind had already gone blank with nothing but the memories of my warm bed, so I stumbled back to my room and went back to sleep.

I thought I had figured out what was wrong in the early afternoon when I woke up as I checked around, I saw that I had left the bonus room door open again. The change must have messed with the program again. Once more, closing the door before either cat got any ideas, thankfully, neither had followed me into the kitchen, where the door was unlike normal, likely looking at something in my room. I hadn’t realized at that point how long it had been since I’d seen my cats anywhere near that side of the kitchen.

That next night, I woke up to a sound that originally sounded like my bedroom door’s doorknob jingling in and out of place, but as my mind cleared and my ears sharpened, I realized it was something knocking into my door over and over again. The sound was as close to consistent as I feel anything random can be, almost mechanical, almost.

I got up to check it out. The sound was coming from the bottom left corner. I reached for the knob, and it clicked into its usual place in my hand. Sometimes, when I close it gently enough, it doesn’t stick in the normal resting position until I touch it again, so at the time, this didn’t alarm me.

Opening the door outward into the hallway, I felt the banging stop, seeing just a few feet away that the Roomba was sitting there, lit up, it almost didn’t register as strange beyond the unnaturalness of it hitting my door that much until I heard the motors run in the usual start configuration of the normal program and listened as the mechanical voice chimed “Beginning Standard Clean.”

Too tired to deal with whatever was messed up on this machine, I once more elected to deal with it in the morning and closed the door. The whole house was devoid of any noticeable noise as I went back to bed, checking the time to see how much longer I had till I had to wake up.

I thought the machine was just fubar when I saw the clock and read the time, three-twenty-nine in the morning. I woke up, and before I did anything else, I got onto my phone to get a refund and send the thing back so I could get a new one.

Completing the process, I got up to go grab the thing and mail it back so as not to deal with it later on. Noticing how the living room looked no cleaner than when I had gone to bed.

Reaching behind my couch, I pulled out the charging base, only to see it covered in the dust of days of non-use, and with little to no tension, the cord came to me, witnessing the dusty plug as evidence that the tension corroborated.

Confused, I tried to find where the Roomba died in the middle of the night, whatever catastrophic thing happened to mess it up as badly as it was likely meant it would not be anywhere expected. I was surprised to see it still in the hallway, just a little bit further down and past the sight I would have of it past my door, as if it only ran for a few seconds after turning on, and I left it.

Picking it up, I noticed two things. The first was once again an object of my confusion, as the start button, something that begins the usual program early, instead of at the scheduled time, had no dust on it as the rest of the machine did. I never touched it, especially not the start button, since I got the thing.

I felt my heart drop as the light caught another part lacking dust. On the other side of where I was holding it was an area so clear of dust it had to have been done within hours during the night, the shape outlined by the shine and light broke into eight distinct digits that bent and had the rounding that suggested fingers, but all met at a single point, some joints meeting multiple digits.

I placed the Roomba down on my hallway table and attempted to calmly collect my cats and leave the house as soon as possible. I saw as one went into the kitchen for their breakfast and I followed, only to be met once more by fear as I saw at the other end.
