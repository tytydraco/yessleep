Beauty is perfection. 

Perfection is beauty. 

These words guided me, an invisible thread weaving through the fabric of my meticulously crafted life. I am a man of refined tastes—a clean-cut, well-to-do gentleman who surrounds himself with only the most beautiful, the most perfect things.

My life stands as a testament to my pursuit of perfection. I have a lovely wife, her beauty timeless, her smile serene, her fine clothes neatly hung in our walk-in closet, concealing the hidden nook behind them. I have three perfect daughters, each a delicate reflection of their mother, their features soft, their smiles radiant. They are my pride, my joy, the living embodiments of my devotion to beauty.

And then there are the Dobermans. Sleek and powerful, bred from the finest German lines, they guard my custom-built home with unwavering loyalty, a symbol of my control and power over the world I have created. 

Everything in my life is beautiful. 

Everything is perfect.

But perfection is fleeting, and beauty fades with time. This truth fuels my obsession, my need to preserve the exquisite things that cross my path. Women, radiant and lovely, who catch my eye—each more perfect than the last—are selected with care. I bring them into my world, and when the time is right, they become part of my collection.

In the hidden nook of my closet, behind my wife’s dresses, lies my sanctuary. There, I keep my most prized possessions—the faces of these women, skinned with precision, preserved in jars with their smiles forever fixed in an expression of serene, eternal beauty. The jars line the shelves, each face a testament to my artistry, each smile a reflection of the perfection I have captured.

I often stand in that secret space, admiring my work, the faces of my collection staring back at me with those fixed, perfect smiles. They are my treasures, my proof that beauty can indeed be eternal, that perfection can be preserved forever.

One evening, as I sit in my beautiful kitchen, eating a perfect meal prepared by my new, lovely chef, I feel a surge of pride. The previous chef was a wonderful addition to my collection—her smile now one of the finest in my hidden gallery. The new chef is promising too, her beauty still ripening, her perfection not yet at its peak. But soon, she will join the others, her smile preserved forever.

My daughters sit at the table with me, their laughter light and melodic, their beauty blossoming more with each passing day. I watch them as they speak, their features delicate, their skin flawless, their smiles radiant. They are growing up so quickly, becoming more beautiful with every moment.

Beauty is perfection. 

Perfection is beauty. 

The words echo in my mind as I gaze at my daughters—my perfect, lovely daughters. They are the culmination of everything I have worked for, everything I have strived to create. And yet, as I look at them, another thought begins to take root, slowly, insidiously.

They are so beautiful.

 So perfect. 

They are everything I have ever wanted, everything I have ever desired. And they are mine.

The thought whispers to me, curling around my mind like a serpent. My daughters are growing up, their beauty reaching its zenith. Soon, they will leave, their perfection lost to the world, unpreserved, unprotected.

I cannot allow that. I cannot let such beauty slip through my fingers. My heart races as the idea takes hold, solidifying in my mind, inescapable. They will be perfect additions to my collection, the final pieces that will complete my masterpiece. Their beauty, their perfection, will be preserved forever, their smiles frozen in time, unmarred by the passage of years.

My wife’s laughter drifts from the living room, but I barely hear it. My mind is already elsewhere, in the secret nook of the closet, imagining the new jars that will soon line the shelves. My daughters’ faces, preserved in their flawless beauty, will be my ultimate triumph.

I smile, my heart swelling with love, with pride. 

Beauty is perfection.

 Perfection is beauty. 

And they are mine.
