I’ve always loved the warm tropical weather and the idea of travelling, unlike my husband. Ever since we’d met, I had been trying to get him out of his shell, though being the typical quiet nerdy recluse, this was going as fast as paint dries. That being said, I love him unconditionally and really can’t see my life without him.

 

I was a workaholic, trading a social life for a bad bitch mentality that only led down an alleyway of separation. Those choices, coupled with the passing of my parents, trapped me, alone in a room with a one-way mirror. Watching everyone you grew up with creating vibrant and colourful lives with loving partners crushed my already fractured mental state.

 

I can honestly say, without Wade’s quiet charm and persistence, I wouldn’t be writing this. I found him at a time in my life where I thought I couldn’t sink any lower. Looking back on that period of my life, I couldn’t have wished for something as freeing as I have now.

 

Wade equally was a hard worker, which I could infer from his vigorous typing, two desks over. Thanks to his empathetic and frankly stubborn personality he pushed me to pursue my passion regardless of finances.

 

When it came to travel, we mostly played it safe, only visiting the big tourist countries in Europe. I’d argue those were his decisions as he was always a relaxed holiday-goer, preferring beaches, pools and walks through the town. In stark contrast, I was a thrill seeker and pushed heavily for exotic destinations, though with him contributing heavier to the finances, I always let it slide for his sake.

 

That year, however, was our twelve-year anniversary and I was determined to push for a location I’d been wanting to visit for forever, Australia. Practically daily I’d show him all the amazing locations and activities that were on offer, though I could see that they weren’t enthralling him as much as they did me.

 

Eventually though, I knew he’d come around. Not to toot my own horn, but I’m hard to say no to, I’d put that down to my womanly charms.

 

Wade: “Fine … you win. We can go there, just don’t go overboard … please.”

He spoke in a tired, reluctant tone as I ambushed him, the moment he returned home from work.

 

Me: “Yesss! You’re going to love it; our itinerary will be full to bursting.”

I couldn’t hide my giddiness as I jumped into his arms, knocking the backpack from his shoulder.

 

Wade: “I said please, didn’t I?

He smiled nervously as I pretended not to hear him and just squeezed tighter.

 

The moment I saw the tours and resorts, I had a list of 101 things ready to go. This was going to be my way of showing him how much we’d been missing out on, with it hopefully getting him out of his comfort zone.

 

Those two weeks would have us up and down the east coast, experiencing everything from sky to scuba diving and it was definitely worth it.

 

I knew the travel time was going to be a killer as twenty-two hours was about as much flying as he’d done his entire life, but the image of his pale face around five hours in is a priceless memory.

 

Wade: “Han, move please … I’m feeling a little lightheaded, I think I’m gonna be sick.”

As he rushed down the aisle in the direction of the plane’s bathroom.

 

He always played off his emotions, even with the confident speech he gave in the airport terminal. Something about not getting motion sick and his ability to sleep for at least three quarters of the flight, though I can’t say I wasn’t a little amused to see him dash away into the bathroom. The comment ‘it was definitely that tuna sandwich’, still brings a smile to my face now.

 

On our travel, I recall laying back in my seat and envisioning all we would experience, hoping it wouldn’t fly by too quickly. Those wonderful, priceless memories still to be made excited me, though they are corrupted now. The colour and wonder I experienced, tainted and overshadowed by what was supposed to be our highlight.

Surprisingly after a couple of apprehensive days, he began to break free of his shell and actually challenged my previous preconceived notions. Even his public speaking anxiety, was crushed under the weight of the Frank Sinatra cover he sang while fully sober on a karaoke night.

 

Falling in love with someone once is an amazing feeling, but looking up at him, living his best life and really pushing the boat out for me, he had me falling all over again.

 

Between the breathtaking scenery and adrenaline pumping activities, we were loving life more so then ever before and I was seeing first hand, a positive change in his mood.

 

Over the previous year, choices we made in conjunction with childish promises we couldn’t keep, had formed a divide with his parents. Though no longer on speaking terms, those issues were forced to the wayside as we focused more on our life together. Regardless, I could tell it got to him. Work hours were ramping up and social time was dwindling, which is why I semi-forced this trip on us.

 

Week two was nearing its midpoint and with it, the most highly anticipated event of our holiday, our reef and cave dive. With my environmental and his geological background, we’d been hyping this up for a while.

 

The boat trip would first take us round the coast where we could stop off, before taking us to two localities, one a coral reef and the other a set of interconnected underwater caves.

 

Meeting the other tourists and crew at the dock, I got to chatting as Wade stood silently, listening in with little rebuttal. Along with us, there was a Dutch and German couple, which Wade brought up as odd, due to the fact that the tour wasn’t specifically targeted at couples when we booked on.

 

Each member of the crew greeted us as the light blue, slightly worn boat docked. It consisted of the captain, a dive supervisor and two officers. All four of the men were very accommodating, showing us round the boat, playing some music and getting our dive gear in order.

 

Wade: “Is it just me or are these guys being really, really nice, like they’re overly thankful were going?”

Shaking off his comments, as I had with his previous ones, I attributed them to mindless speculation brought on by his, still niggling apprehensions. Although, unusually, I came to the same conclusion.

 

On the hour or so commute to our first drop off point I glanced over at Wade’s phone to see him enamoured by an article on the caves.

 

Me: “What you reading? Don’t tell me you’re researching the cave. It’ll be safe, stop worrying.”

Playfully rolling my eyes as his were still locked on the same paragraph.

 

Wade: “Nah, nothing like that, just looking at some local history. Did you know these tours have been going on since the mid 1800’s? Apparently, it was a heritage site for aboriginals, back when sea level was significantly lower.”

I knew the moment I asked he’d start waffling, but I can agree that potentially seeing some extremely old cave drawings would be cool.

 

Dropping anchor, we geared up ready for the first dive. I could tell Wade was a little nervous and I can’t lie I was too. Although we had the relevant qualification, it is a different feeling putting it into practice.

 

All being considered, it went pretty well, and we took to the water with ease. The array of bright and luscious coral alongside a thriving mix of marine fauna had us mesmerised. For the majority of the ride to our second locality we relayed to one another in an excited, childlike manor all we had seen.

 

Maybe it was our overinflated self-confidence at the smoothness of our first dive, but regardless we had little fears disembarking at the cave system. As we got fitted, I do remember hearing the other couples discussing potential faults in their suits from our last location, though I was interrupted from my eavesdropping as Wade asked for help zipping himself up.

 

Wade could tell those comments were niggling at the back of my mind and with his usual instincts being right on the money, he lay a hand on my head and comforted me.

 

Wade: “It’ll be okay, I’m always going to be here for you.”

 

The plan laid out by our ships captain was fairly simple. We would wait for our supervisor to swim in, survey the main body of the cave and fit an umbilical which we would all be attached to. From there, all willing members of the party would travel in, surface in the second chamber, then return to the boat.

 

Unlike the shallower waters of the first location, the cave was situated at an outcrop of rocky islands which were being lapped by choppier waters. Though the crew members repeatedly insisted that we all disembark, one of the couples stayed seated, resulting in only five going, including the dive supervisor.

 

The weather out there on the slightly more open ocean can change quickly, or so our captain said, though he felt it was still safe to begin.

 

For the first couple of minutes we simply swam from the boats anchor position to the entrance, though the force of the current was noticeably stronger.

 

Reaching the cave opening, our supervisor signalled us to enter, as we swam amongst stalagmites and stalactites jutting from the cave floor and ceiling. It was high tide as we entered, as planned, allowing us to traverse most of what the cave had to offer.

 

Although we were assured it was safe, we were all told in great detail that unclipping from the line was strictly forbidden as, although the caves had been mostly mapped, many of the interconnected passages hadn’t been. In a storm event, if caught in one of those passages, a person could become isolated.

 

I vividly remember that warning not phasing me, mostly due to the ease of the first dive. In comparison Wade frequently went over the safety precautions with me as we were gearing up. Without that being forced into my long-term memory, things could have ended very differently.

 

\-

 

Shortly after travelling through the first large section of the cave and into a connecting passage, an increased amount of gas bubbles shot from Wades respirator as he began turning his head franticly. I hadn’t noticed, as the array of bioluminescent fish and coral had my eye, but we’d become separated from the other couple.

 

The cave system had become increasingly darker as we had passed into this section of the cave and without knowing our automated headlamps had flicked on. After hearing about their previous problems, I hoped they’d simply turned back or were just slow swimmers. The conveyor belt of divers had been the supervisor, Wade, Me, then the couple.

 

Fortunately, Wade had been hyper prepared and learnt many of the important hand signals. As a conversation occurred between him and the supervisor, I simply trod water and examined our surroundings. I remember thinking that without the connecting line to the boat, it would be an impossible task to navigate to the exit, worse without a light source to guide your way.

 

 

Breaking me from thought, a hand grasped my shoulder and spun me around. Wade was signalling to me a multitude of instructions that honestly, I couldn’t fully decipher, that being said I understood the gist. We had to stay put. Though I sighed internally, I watched the supervisor unclipped from the line and swim back towards the entrance. As he passed, I caught his facial expression and for lack of a better word, it perplexed me.

 

I know people deal with pressure in different ways and I’m sure the feeling of losing someone on one of your tours would be devastating, but he was smiling. Turning back to face Wade, I could tell he had seen the same thing, and it was confusing him as well.

 

As my light shone back towards the exit, his flippers disappeared into the depths as we waited. It could have been two seconds or ten years, but we were both worried. Again, with the hand signals, I couldn’t tell what Wade wanted from me, but as he gently nudged me forward in the direction that our supervisor left, I understood, we were leaving.

 

We’d barely experienced any extra pressure on our entry, though the moment we attempted to pull ourselves out we were ensnared by a forceful current. The torrent pushed back hard, attempting to force us deeper into the cave system. Grasping the umbilical with enough force to break rock, I dragged myself forward.

 

The timing couldn’t have been worse. Practically the moment we were attempting to leave the, onrush emerged. Assuming that all the other divers had successfully reached the boat, I used that as motivation that we too would escape.

 

That hope was royally crushed as we emerged from the second chamber. Light from the cave opening a pin prick in the distance, though it beckoned us home. However, in the couple of moments we fought back against the increasing torrent in that entryway, the cord jostled as the shockwaves of releasing tension were shot through our hands.

 

It had been previously pulled tight and firm, but now with the onslaught crashing into us, it wavered. Our grip the only thing between stability and the rag dolling rapids. In a moment that felt like an eternity, a final ripple tore through the line as all our strength evaporated.

 

A crackling whip swiped at us as the frayed end of the cord impacted my upper left torso. My grip slipped and in a matter of seconds I was tumbling back, unknowingly into Wade. The thing keeping us tethered to our salvation disappeared as we were left to the mercy of the surge, clawing us back into the abyss.

 

\-

 

Crashing against the jagged walls and each other felt like we were in a pinball machine as we were ripped deeper into the slowly narrowing cave system. Slamming into the opening we had only just emerged from stole the air from my lungs as I gasped, losing connection to my respirator.

 

In the moment or two that my headlamp shone in the direction I was facing, Wade’s body collided with mine. The speed at which he travelled gave me no chance to evade, regardless of if I could. His impact forced me through the barely manhole sized opening. Looking back to him, I caught the faintest image of his face through the mask as he rotated, his scared green eyes mirrored mine.

 

Those emerald spheres reflecting his fears, more so for my sake then his own. They were the last memory I could confidently form as I tumbled deeper, losing all cognition.

 

After falling for an unknown length of time I broke momentarily from my daze. Whilst I failed to keep my mouth shut, I ricocheted from wall to wall, hopelessly holding out my arms to attempt to stabilise my rotation and in any miniscule chance, grasp on to anything that would slow my descent.

 

Fortunately, I was in favour with someone, as my oxygen tank wedged itself in an extremely narrow opening. I could scarcely see ten centimetres in front of me, let alone breathe, however in my disorientated state I knew I didn’t have long.

 

Franticly, blindly searching for the buckles, I unstrapped my tank as a vaguely human shape surged through the current and collided with considerable force into another section of the wall.

 

With no time to ponder who, like a crab I turned scaled the cave wall. The climb mixed with my atrophied lungs could have been my own hell. Maybe I died there in the corner of this endless maze of tunnels, and this was my torment.

 

However, envisioning my saviour reaching out a hand from above, pushed me forward. His hands, that of an angel, wrenching me up onto the small plateau he was perched.

 

I sputtered and gasped, threatening to inhale all the remaining air in the room, as I choked on the unholy amount of water that filled my lungs. Gingerly my eyes opened to see Wade, still dripping from his episode with the torrent.

 

I knelt there for an unknow laps of time, sobbing as my body cried out in pain, only to be broken by a soothing voice.

 

Wade: “Hannah … are you alright?”

He coughed, as he knelt beside me.

 

Me: “Yea …”

The meagre reply, all I could muster.

 

A warm smile grew on his face, it masked his current cognition, to appease mine. With an outstretched hand he willed me up from the puddle I was forming on the stone slab.

 

Wade: “Where’s your diving gear? … Han?”

A frown taking the place of his warm expression.

 

I couldn’t answer as tears welled up and my legs waivered. Sitting on the cold wet stone, I cried as I burrowed my head into Wade’s shoulder. He pleaded that things would be okay, but I couldn’t shake the image of us being trapped down here in the damp, dark expanse.

 

The passage was tall, but narrow and as Wade’s headlamp shone across the upper limits and then back down to our ledge only two openings were visible. One larger opening sat above us, with a trickling stream of water dripping down into the onrushing current at our feet.

 

The other was a flooded tributary, which sat at a shallow ‘U’ shape. The angle of the opening indicated that the tunnel looped back on itself, however the only way of knowing would be to traverse it.

 

Waves crashed at the base of our perch as our embrace loosened and we stared down at the rising water level. We couldn’t stay in that state for long, with our only real option being the opening behind us.

 

The realisation hit me like a brick wall as I understood that, without my gear, I would have to wait for Wade to make the trip, alone.

 

Me: “NO! … you can’t leave me here. What if you can’t get back … I’ll be stuck here on my….”

I could feel myself hyperventilating as the shear terror of being left in complete darkness, with the steadily approaching tide.

 

Wade: “Hannah, listen to me, calm down and listen. There’s no way for us to go back and there isn’t another opening that we can get to, this is our only option.”

His voice began, erratic and flustered, but gradually softened as to give me as much reassurance as possible.

 

Wade: “Look at me … it’s going to be okay. I won’t be more than five minutes. If I’m correct then there will be a pocket of air on the other side and we’ll be much safer there, than here. You can do this … five minutes.”

With a gentle kiss on my forehead, he slipped on his mask and respirator and plunged into the small opening, disappearing along with the only light source.

 

As quickly as he dove under, the cave settled back to its cold inanimate regularity.  Without the warm yellow glow or his body heat, I shivered as the chilling mist gushed over the perimeter of my lonely plateau.

 

Shuffling back and curling up into a ball on the back wall, was the only thing left I could do, as I waited with baited breath for his triumphant return.

 

I know I over-exaggerated, but I couldn’t help but imagine the worst possible outcome. There was no way of deducing how long we’d already been in the cave, but sitting there in the foetal position I began to sob once more.

 

The images of his face. Wishing and hoping it wouldn’t be my last chance to see him or even tell him how much he meant. The minutes turned to hours, or even days, as I sat, not moving or sleeping. The beating of the waves at my side, drown out as all-external sound melded into one another. The only noise, the soft beating of my heart and shrill, shallow breaths.  I don’t even remember if I had my eyes closed as regardless, there was only black.

 

Suddenly out of the void, a pin prick of light. As it grew, a new sound was added to the background as my ears tuned in to the soft splashing.

 

Breaking the surface tension and pulling himself up to his knees, Wade emerged from the small opening and relayed to me the first words I’d heard in as long as I could remember.

 

Wade: “Han, I think we’re all good. The bend isn’t that long so you should only have to hold your breath for a minute … here, come on.”

Slightly out of breath he gestured towards me.

 

The moment he’d spoken, my boundless singular confinement was broken, and we were back in action. Releasing my vicelike lock, from around my shins and rolling to a kneel, I examined every aspect of his face, confining that flickering image to memory.

 

Though the timespan was unclear, the steadily rising water level threatened to creep overtop our perch and engulf our ankles. Slipping on his headlamp, I gave him the all clear. Placing the mask around his eyes, he stretched out a hand and lead me to the opening.

 

Wade: “I know its tight, but just trust me. Stay as straight as possible and shuffle through slowly. I’ll be guiding the way, okay?”

His hazy green eyes, calming yet firm.

 

With a silent nod of understanding we crept up to the door sized and shaped hole and took the plunge with a deep breath.

 

Though long, the passage was barely wide enough for a person. The crawl through that submerged tunnel was agonising, though as Wade said, probably took just under a minute. Each shuffle, my body attempted to snag itself on its ribbed and unconformable circumference.

 

Wade however kept his eyes forward, guiding me along as he was thrashed against both sides. Traversing that system once was bad enough but by the third time in Wade’s instance would have been torturous. Even more so with his increased frame compared to me, I was surprised he would even fit.

 

Thinking on that, I don’t think I ever asked Wade if he was okay. His minor claustrophobia was glossed over in my need for comfort. I wish I’d pulled myself together enough to notice that he was a mirror of my panic, yet his eyes always stayed that warm green that they had been in the second passage.

 

Shooting from the slightly angled opening and into a larger chamber, we were thrust to the cave floor. An enormous gasp erupted from Wade as he rolled onto his back and stared up at the ceiling.

 

Wade: “I didn’t think that would work.”

The whispered, yet just audible murmur trickled from Wade’s mouth the moment he’d filled his lungs with a new gulp of air.

 

Me: “What?”

I blurted out, as he hesitantly held up his hands and just shrugged.

 

Wade: “It doesn’t matter now. Come on, lets look for an exit.”

 

Unlike our previous confinement, this section was extremely wide, yet only a couple centimetres off Wades head. Rising to our feet and scanning our surroundings we could see that, yet again we were on a plateau, though this time the damp, dripping cave below was only around half full. Bioluminescent algae and small plants dotted the caves walls, emanating a soft green glow and lighting up small pockets of the cave.

 

A couple shallow pools dotted the walls, as small droplets fell into the larger mass.  Sadly, unlike our previous room, there were no other connecting chambers, at least not visible to us.

 

In those couple of minutes scanning the caves floor, my body gave out. All the adrenaline that had been keeping me going winced out as I slumped to my side. With that, I lay still and the cold embedded its talons once more.

 

Me: “Wade … I can’t keep going. I’m spent, just lay down with me for a bit.”

My strained voice wavering too and I called out for his warmth.

 

Wade: “Yeah. We can rest, just not for too long.”

The comforting melody of his voice, singing me to sleep as we curled up against one of the walls.

 

\-

 

Weakly opening my eyes, for a moment I felt Wade’s warm embrace and imagined us in bed, reflexively asking him for the time, only to recall our current situation. The cold cavern air and my bodies damp exterior replacing that feeling. Evidently, he was atrophied too as he lay motionless, with his head down to the group and obscured.

 

Clambering up on shaky legs I wobbled over to our plateau’s terminus. Counterintuitively, the cave floor was now almost completely visible. Not knowing if I was dreaming, I nudged Wade up as he peered over the edge too.

 

Simultaneously a shallow rumble and quiet sucking sound could be heard from deeper within the cave.

Wade: “You think it’s a tropical storm? Makes sense if it is. All the water rushing in then getting sucked out as it passes us.”

His voice echoing in the now hollow cavern.

 

Mindlessly ignoring his question, my still sleep deprived eyes focused in on something down on the far wall of the cave, where the draining was emanating. Fortunately, as the water level had dropped, we’d been given an opportunity. A semicircular opening was now visible and for us a potential way out.

 

Wade: “I don’t think we’re getting down there safely, why not just go back the way we …”

His voice trailed off as he turned back to our way in.

 

Just like the cave below, our way in had been drained. Without a high enough water level, there was no way we’d be getting back up the length of that tunnel.

 

Me: “Guess we are then.”

 

My lacklustre energy reserves and the wet wall’s weren’t boding well, but as my mouth dried and his stomach grumbled, we began our descent.

 

Though the sides weren’t steep or even jagged, they were covered in a thick layer of soaked bioluminescent algae. Each foothold, feigning to give way and send us hurtling down to the caves floor.

 

Wade, in a typical attempt to reassure me, jinxed us as a weak grip caused me to lose my hold as I slid from around half-way down. The sound reverberated through my body as I winced and cried out in pain.

 

Though my landing had been cushioned, it was merely broken by a thinly vailed puddle, no more than a couple of centimetres deep. Splashing into it, my right knee collided with the hard stone floor.

 

I could hear the faint sound of him calling down as he rushed, though my mind was focusing all its energy on telling me how much my knee was fucked.  

 

Though I could stand, no significant weight could be put on it. For the next inconceivable stretch of time, I hobbled from section to section, taking the seemingly safest alternatives for navigating with my injury.

 

I’d happily later find out that, I’d chipped a section of my patella off, resulting in the cartilage on its right side being worn to the bone. For the rest of the time I was moving whilst in the cave, I could hear, feel and envision the action of my knee cap grinding against my femur.

 

I was on the brink of collapse, the lack of food or drinkable water, had me running on empty and the agony of my knee was weighing us down. Entering our final chamber, I caved. Dropping to the floor with tears in my eyes I propped myself up against the wall.

 

Me: “I can’t do it anymore. Just leave me.”

Tears filling my eyes as I hid my face from Wade.

 

Wade: “Han, come on, let’s keep going.”

 

Me: “Go where? We’ve been walking for who knows how long. Just admit it, were trapped.”

 

Wade: “Han.”

 

Me: “NO! You can’t fix it. Just stop … please.”

My sobs turning to anger as I directed all my fear and pain at Wade.

 

Wade: “Hannah Jane Fairstone … I know you’re in pain. Remember when I broke my leg playing football. You took time off and got us pizzas while we watched TV all day. I tell you what, when were out of here I’ll do that for you. I’ll make sure its chicken and peppers too. We just have to keep going … Okay?

 

Me: “… Okay …”

I knew the pain was pushing me to the edge and he was just doing whatever he could in a frankly hopeless situation.

 

Dragging myself into the next dimly lit section, we stopped for a short break, as Wade examined a small pool. Curiously he was kneeling and watching the surface as it swayed back and forth like a wave.

 

As he did, I stared up at the wall above. It could have been the pain, but I saw what looked to be drawings. Before I could alert Wade to them, he was already clipping on his harness and tank.

 

Wade: “Hannah, give me two seconds okay, I’m just going to dip under and have a little look. Don’t worry I promise it’ll be only a sec.”

Though I disapproved, he moved before I could even make a sound, and I was alone again.

 

Quietly gazing up at the crudely drawn people, plants and what seemed to be set of caves, they seemed to depict an array of tunnels all connecting to what I hoped was the one I resided in.

 

With a startling splash, Wade re-emerged.

 

Wade: “I think I’ve found a way out, or at least a path to an exit. Theres some faint white light and seemingly a current forming small waves.”

His excited tone only rising as I pointed at the drawings.

 

Me: “If someone drew these then maybe you’re right and there is a way out down there, but we only have one tank.”

Yet again, with my attention directed elsewhere I was blind to see what he was really suggesting.

 

Me: “No. You’re not leaving me again.”

 

Wade: “It might be our only …”

 

Me: “NO! You don’t even know if there is an exit. Don’t take that risk.”

 

Wade: “If there’s some light then we must be close. There’s more than enough for me to get out and open the flare.”

 

Me: “Please just stay with me, Wade, I don’t want to be alone.”

 

Wade: “Hannah, with your knee you can barely walk, let alone swim. If we have even the smallest chance of both getting out, I need to try.”

 

Me: “What if it’s just a dead end, or you get stuck … I don’t want to die alone.”

 

Wade: “I promise, I won’t be long.”

 

Me: “You know that’s a lie.”

 

Wade: “It’ll be okay, I’m always going to be here for you.”

 

With that, he kissed my forehead and dove down into the depths of that pool.

 

Once again alone, I waited, and waited, and waited. As the geological timescale raced passed, all cognition of time vanished as I reverted back to that foetal position. The soft swaying of the pool and dripping of the cave walls melded together with my increasingly loud internal cogs, creating a blistering cacophony of sounds that hum through me.

 

Sleep was as unattainable as Wade’s current location, though burying my head into my working knee, I imagined his face and voice, willing me forward. For fleeting moments, it was as if he was there, speaking straight into my ear and moving throughout the cave, though his whisp wasn’t physical.

 

That memorialised ghost, drifted in and out of existence as my mind began to power down, for what would be an indefinite rest.

 

\-

 

Feeling my mind booting up again, a mixture of alien sounds pierced my dulled mind. Soft beeps and the sound of other voices permeated the space I now resided. With a slow flickering push, my eyes opened and were bathed in the bleached white of a room.

 

I lay, connected to a hospital bed, with nurses rushing in and out of the room. A balding man stood at my bedside and asked repeatedly an array of questions that were dampened, as if I were underwater.

 

Moving my rusted neck muscles to the opposite side of the room, a man stood at the window bathed in the glow of light pouring in. With a soft vibrato, his voice played a familiar tune.

 

“Time to get up Han.”

 

Stretching and blinking I arose from the bed as the faint sounds all crashed into life and I was being comforted by Wade’s parents and my sister, alongside the doctors’ prior questions.

 

However, the man was gone and in his absence a hole larger than the cave I’d been trapped in formed within.  

 

Revisiting these memories, more so than the ones within the cave, are soul crushing. Hours after the news I was ready to revert back to my old ways and make a reckless and selfish decision.

 

Again, what brought me back to sense were his words. Guiding me through those passages, comforting my hysteria and pushing me to make the best decision. Those as well as all we created in twelve years were mine and only mine. Without me to broadcast all he was, those memories would fade to time.

 

Even in life, he pushed me to be better and in death, willed me on. I will hold tight the image of his face, which photos and videos don’t do justice. Those warm green eyes, my final core memory.
