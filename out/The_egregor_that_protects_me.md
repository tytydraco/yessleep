First. I'll introduce myself. You can call me Micky, I'm 20 years old, and I'm female. I grew up in a not so nice house, built on top of native war grounds. My heritage includes Romani people and native americans, alongside women from Salem. So, to say I'm sensitive to the paranorm is an understatement.

Now, for those of you who don't know, an egregor is an entity created entirely of the energies its most exposed to.

That being said, at a very early age I'd never been comfortable in my own home. I always felt like I was being watched. I couldn't be anywhere in the house without hearing a stramge noise, or gasps in my ear, even the occasional name call from another room even when I'm all alone.

I decided to start learning how to control my abilities in middle school, and began to dabble in speaking to spirits and energies around me. Of course, I took the necessary precautions almost all the time.

However, that didn't stop the negative energy I began to feel EVERYWHERE. It always felt like someone was following me. Things like cups tipping over, or chairs moving, and voices out of thin air became normal to me even in public. It got to the point where I hated being alone because I was scared that this thing would hurt me. That is, until one day I HAD to be home alone.

I was laying in my bed on my phone, with my headphones over my ears. I felt someone lightly pokingthe back of my head, so I assumed my family was back home and turned around to look.

No one was there.

Again the poking.

Again. No one.

I decided to take off my headphones and go sit on my roof for a while. (My window opens to a flat section of roof, it was a normal spot to chill at for me.)

However, as soon as I opened the window an ear piercing, murderous, shrieking scream ripped through the air from INSIDE my room. Immediately I was petrified. I grabbed my phone and a knife (just in case) and moved to exit my room. That's when I heard the cabinets in my kitchen downstairs opening and slaming shut repeatedly. I was freaking out and I didn't know what to do, so I hid in my closet and called my mom in a panick who hurried home.

That was the only truly scare experience I've ever had. Except for when I caught the form of my egregor on camera.

I was sitting in my livingroom with the tv off, just chilling on my phone watching youtube. That's when I noticed a shadow in the tv that shouldn't have been there. I just had a weird feeling, so I took a picture and looked at it for a few minutes. I still couldn't quite discern why the shadows where there, and I was definitely freaked out. I decided to go upstairs and take a showee. It was only about 30 to 40 minutes.
I returned to the sofa, in the same exact spot. In the same position. I looked at the tv to turn it on.

The shadows werent there anymore.

These weren't just daylight shadows either. They were figures. As if someone was standing in the reflection of the tv. But, these shadows were way too dark to be people. They were PITCH black. Darker than darkness itself.

I stared intently at the tv to try and find these shadows, I koved around and looked from different angles, I opened and closed the shades, turned lights on and off- I did everything I could think of to bring these shadows back.

Thats when I noticed that they weren't actually gone. They'd just moved.

So I took another picture.

Weeks later I'd almost forgotten about the incident, and I stopped trying to contact spirits for the time being.
However, they weren't done talking to me.

My friend came over to my house after I told her I had been hearing my name way more often than normal, and that these voices wouldn't leave me alone.

We decided to set up my recorder and get some EVP's.
They were successful. Thats how I learned that my egregor wasn't trying to scare me. He was trying to protect me.

We asked so many questions, and he answered them all. He named himself Greg after hearing many of my friends joke about me having a ghost named 'Greg'. He stayed in my house and slept next to me every night. He made sure I was never alone. He was the one protecting my home from evil creatures and people because that house was his home too.

However, an egregor no matter what they say, is not a good entity. They suck your energy out of you. They feed off fear, they take and take and take.

I had to say goodbye to Greg.

Sometimes I can still feel his eyes watching me.

I can hear him whisper my name in my ear.

I can feel his caress when I sleep.




Maybe I shouldn't have said goodbye....

I want Greg to hold my hand again.

I want to feel the thrill of terror he brough me.

I want to see his black, boney figure in my dreams...

Do you still exsist Greg?

Are you still here?

Visit me. Please.
