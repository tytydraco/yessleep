I'm now an adult and haven't had any paranormal experiences in a long time. But as a kid I had multiple Shadow figures that watched me. 

The first one was a nondescript, lanky, black void that would stand in the corner of my room and watch me sleep. It was so tall, its legs went halfway up my wall and the only way it fit in my room was bending its shoulders and head down. The feet were on the ground, the head, shoulders, and neck were on the ceiling.

This one was the most common one I saw. I always slept facing my room terrified of what may happen if I turned my back on it. If I got the courage to jump out of bed and turn on the lights it would be gone. I turn them back off, still gone. I go back to bed... still gone. I close my eyes to go to sleep, opened them to check, it was back.

Stuff like that wasn't every night, but fairly common for me. One time I was trying to sleep with my door open, I watched it walk through the living room. Place its massive hand on the top of my door frame, and bed down to peer into my room. This one set me over the edge, I jumped out of bed and ran to turn my light on. Unfortunately this thing was right next to the switch. By the time the light was on it was gone and I went to sleep on the floor of my moms room.

I would also see it occasionally in the hallway at night, but most times it was just in the corner of my room.

The next shadow figure I encountered was attached to another person. My father had a lot of issues when I was a child and often only saw him once or twice a year. The first time I ever saw it was over summer break. My grandparents flew me out to their house and I was going to be there for a few weeks. My dad wanted to see me. He sobered up and took a 36 hour train ride from Mexico to see me.

The first few days were normal from what I remember, and all the days after my experience were normal. But that night may have been one the most terrifying things I can think of in my memories. I was going to sleep in the backroom. There was a shadow figure in the corner, but not the one from my moms house.

This one was smaller, probably taller than an average human, but nothing unnatural like the other one. Except this one was much more detailed, it's hard to explain how a shadow can have detail but I could tell he was well dressed, like a 3 piece suit well dressed, had a goatee, and a massive top hat on. 

The presence of this thing set me on edge, but I had seen things before and just tried to go to sleep. As soon as I did I awoke in a dark hallway that stretched on as far as I could make out. After looking around an  ear piercing scream erupted from every direction, a women, dressed in all white with pale skin floated into view far down the hallway. She looked in my direction and flew at me. In what felt like an instant she was in my face then flew straight through me.

I woke up terrified, jumped out of bed and ran to the living room where my grandma and dad were talking. I stayed up with them until my dad went to bed and had no other incidents.

Next spring break my dad came to stay at my moms house for a few days to see me because he couldn't afford a hotel. On the last night of his stay he was on the couch in the living room doing stuff on his laptop, I was in my room with the door closed trying to sleep. 

After some time my office chair, which was facing my bed, had the same hat man as last summer watching me sleep. Terrified by my last memories of him I jumped up and turned on my light. No one was there. Just an empty chair. I tried to lay back down with the light off but he was back. This time I ran out of my room and asked my dad to do his work in bed, I went to the top bunk to sleep. That night I woke up on the bottom bunk looking at my chair.

He was there. Watching me, a sick and twisted smile strewn across his face. I couldn't move. I watched him remove his hat. As he pulled it up it revealed a set of long horns. He had to lift the hat more than a foot to clear the rim of the hat from the tip of his horns. He placed it in his lap and continued to watch me. I don't know how long this went on, but I woke up on the top bunk in the morning.

The next year my dad had gotten sober and I never saw it again. Thinking back on why he did that I can't really say. But maybe that was it's way of saying goodbye, because my dad reverted back to his old issues after a few years but that thing was never around when I saw him.

I have more encounters but these were my two frequent occurrences growing up. And I was happy to leave them in my past. But recently my toddler has been waking up with nightmares and it takes her a long time to calm down. It has got me wondering if the figures that followed me didn't stop watching, but I just couldn't see them anymore.
