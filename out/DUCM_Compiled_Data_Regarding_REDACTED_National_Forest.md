 The following is the entire contents of a flash drive marked ‘23’, discovered in a warehouse that was seemingly the target of arson in the American southeast. Sources claim that this warehouse was briefly used for a few weeks by an unidentified but highly organized group exhibiting a martial authority, just several months before urban explorers discovered the device among charred remains of several unsalvageable drives.

*An attempt was made following this interaction to send several photographs from Dawaun Robinson \[DECEASED\] to both Abigail Bayer \[STATUS UNKNOWN\] and Roman Julienne \[DECEASED\]. The photographs were all varying degrees of blurriness and most of them were incomprehensible. However, several of the photographs appeared to be what can only be described as ‘fields’ of humanoids laying on their backs. Tall, slender saplings were seen rising out of the mouths and/or chests of the individuals, some with their faces and/or torso completely split apart into scraps to accommodate the width of the trunk coming forth from the body. The lower half of most of the bodies can be described as ‘deflated’ in appearance. One close-up image depicted the ‘roots system’ of the saplings, a network of thousands of white threads emerging from the trunk base and either winding down into the exit puncture or reaching out errant strands to anchor into the nearby surface flesh. A final photograph was taken by Dawaun Robinson \[DECEASED\], wherein he pointed the camera towards his own face. Hundreds, if not thousands, of tiny white threads appeared to be protruding from his mouth and curling around his lips. Dawaun Robinson \[DECEASED\] was smiling in his final photograph. Due to the lack of cellphone service in \[REDACTED\] National Forest, the images were not transmitted to the intended recipients.*
