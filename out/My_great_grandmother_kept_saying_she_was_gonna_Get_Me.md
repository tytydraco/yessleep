It was her mantra. 

“I’m gonna get you. I’m gonna get you Dolores. Are your parents awake? What about your aunt and uncles your cousins? Did you get me my Benadryl? My allergies are acting up something awful today.”

Grandma‘s allergies were always awful. She was always coughing and sneezing and complaining and it was my job to keep her company day after day, week after week, and here I was, only in the sixth grade and on what they call the spectrum. I had no life is what I’m trying to say. A girl in the sixth grade should have a life. My family was no life. I questioned whether they were even capable of being classified as a life form.

My family was no bowl of fruit, no walk in the park. It was a horror show. It was Halloween every goddamn day, and they were made up for the make up with the fake butt implants, the fake titties, the fillers and botard. 

“Beauty is always natural, Dolores.”

“Yes, Grammy Carrie.”

I don’t know who they thought they were, but we had a very strange background of gypsies from Transylvania with a little hillbilly thrown in it was my great, great grandfather, Heinz McMuggin.

“Doloresssss!!! Get me another beer!!!!!”

You did not contradict great grandma Carrie. She was bedridden with sores on her face and sputum and mucus that would just sometimes erupt as projectiles and she could strike at anytime at all. There was no warning. There was no preparation that could be taken other than to avoid my grandmother entirely.


As I said, being in the sixth grade, I could not avoid her entirely. In fact, I was relegated to the role of her caregiver, caretaker companion, and confidante.

Oh, how could I forget her personal shopper as well when I wasn’t getting Benadryl to try to keep this the mucus at bay she was having me by the weirdest things online for her. 

Grandma‘s eyesight was not too good so she would make me do everything for her. Read everything explaining it to describe it, purchase it and then she would grab it from me upon arrival with arthritic talons tattooed with the words, “Hell’s Angel” and tell me to get lost. 

Tell me to get lost like a little goat, who’s been hit in the head with the tire iron and left for dead in the desert. 

Here was the deal. Grandma had diabetes and had to have one of her legs removed, which happened, but unfortunately, the leg that got removed was the good one so then they had to take the bad one once they figured out the fubar. 

Now two personal injury lawyers later it seen grandma was sitting on about $14 million with interest because there was shenanigans with the discovery. At least that’s what I heard my uncle Ernie say uncle Ernie was constipated real bad from that low carb diet looking for the Metamucil and they had it but not the orange one and he got a bad temper uncle Ernie he wants kick the goat in the cat, but he always choke the chicken.

Anyway, so grandma she all fucked up, but she won’t die and now here I am Dolores in the sixth grade, whose life seems to be dedicated to wipe her Heiny getting her beer, dealing with her allergies, trying to keep my family together because they can’t touch the money till grandma died cause she say I can’t take it with me but you gotta wait for it. 

You gotta wait for it and take care of grandma cause grandma took care of you all so grandma gonna keep taking care of you all until you all taken care of real good and then grandma will know she done what had to be done and she would have to be due .

Aside from me, the only person granny talk to was some guy named Stephen. She made me call him on the phone and then she made me go away, but sometimes I would listen and the things they talked about since say and very lovely like there was an intimate deep connection that my six year old brain cannot quite wrap itself around, but that yet somehow rimmed with electricity and the promise of apocalypse dystopia and just misery to numerous to a numerate at this particular moment while I’m trying to explain how grandma kept threatening me, threatening me telling me she’s going to get me. She’s gonna get me. 

I’m gonna get you Dolores. That’s how she said. I’m gonna get you Dolores now get me some Benadryl.

 Go get me a parachute. Go get me these giant tents go get me this go get me that and I always say yes cause I’m scared of granny. Sometimes I can feel the earth shake. 

Sometimes the electricity is in the air when granny Pissed she say it’s like a storm passes Dolores but you never done what they done. You never do what they do but grandma know everything even about you. I’m gonna get you Dolores. She’ll see soon. My sweet, sweet child will see soon.

And one day grandma was really excited. I came into her room and she had been trying to see something on her Internet pad and she said to Laura to look at this get grandma her magnifying glass over there. You know grandma like to pee the bed and get me that magnifying glass, my little chica and I’ll show you and it was some kind of protein bar that was from Africa and had this tree bark from some lost ancient tribe that had been princes with the king live to 340 years old and they could see for miles they could smell a pig from a mile away. They knew what was up and yet somehow grandma with the electricity crackling around her couldn’t see what was right before her eyes.

“It’s a scam, Great Grammy.”


Grandma gave me a look. I looked that said how dare you question me child I could feel the look in my bones so I could hear her words in my head. I could hear everything she had said, even before she thought to say it and the next thing I know we were ordering a case of them special Miami protein parts with the special herb bark that Erbes bark forget about your aloe vera forget about your Australian tea tree oil that shit is all snake juice. What happened with grandma wants them bars came I can’t explain, but I never saw a woman drink so much beer in my life. She said she had new purpose new mission case after the case all kinds of beers. It was like she was running her own brewery in that bed, and I just kept cutting away the bottles cart away the bottles.

 She never got out of that bed. She just kept drinking and drinking with unquenchable undeniable thirst for the future for reality for her final mission that she kept telling me I’m gonna get you Dolores I will get you and it will be the last thing I do and then finally came, the family reunion

Not only were all my uncles and aunts and cousins in the house, but we open up the backyard which usually they never did that was just filled with Herbie‘s dog shit but everybody came in. 
They busted down trailers. 
We had a real good time. We had Miami potato salad and we had the macaroni salad with a little square cheese of chunks and and grandma stayed in bed, but she tried to keep them more beer and fat grandma just kept drinking and drinking and drinking, and she kept rubbing her nose or throat every time I came up to get her some more beer and take away the empty she say to me, I’m gonna get you today’s the day. 

My child today is the day and I will feel a snap crackle and pop in the air, it was my hair was standard and I was afraid to touch the door knob. There was spark. It hurt it hurt me.

“The parachute Dolores. That was the sign. I only needed the will. And to let Stephen know, he’d always be my Daddy.

Now my child, you’re too young to understand but Grandma has no use for money. Look at these arthritic hands. Look at my gnarled face. I was once beautiful and now I look like a prune that hasn’t been watered since the Civil War. 

Everything is all gnarled up all gnarly grandma‘s all fucking I’m 103 do you understand that’s why I drink beer all day I had no purpose. I got no legs. They took the wrong one and then they took the right one and then I was I was just in this bed and I weren’t for you my child to work for you.


I don’t know what I would do with that disgusting clan of orangutans no that’s an insult to orangutans that disgusting clan of vipers that we must call the family my child they live they breathe and they wait for me. They wait for my money. It makes me sick so I needed a golden parachute something greater than money.”

“Grandma what’s fatter than money? That’s how you buy all that shit online you use money nothings fatter and better than money.”


Silly child silly child now you will soon know what grandma got the parachute and where it belongs as the family gathers around downstairs to sing Satanic songs grandma will remember a part of her from 1976 when she was young and cruelty, the cruelty of a school mates, her acquaintances, the authority figures everyone everyone hating on grandma because she was different with her freckles with her freckles and her mousy ways. Well tonight grandma can get you grandma‘s golden parachute now go go downstairs with your family go downstairs they’ll get grandma soon the matriarch.

Adidas, I was told when I was downstairs my uncle Fred told me that the doctor said that grandma didn’t really have very much time so they were going to bring grandma down out of bed. It’s the first time grandma had been out of bed in years.

 This was an abnormality grandma had been in bed since I could remember everything about her was in bed And since the last three years, I’ve been taking care of her, given her Benadryl for her snot and mucus bring her all them beer bottles clean up her duties everything but I love her. They told me she was my great Grammy Grams so anyway when uncle Fred told me this was it I took my seat at the table and everyone looked grim, but they also look greedy. They look greedy as cats at a fish convention during a riot.

Five minutes later, grandma sat at the head of the table regarding a salt. She said please the us don’t think any of the supplies to you. I’m gonna get you and then she said I want us to have one drink together in unity and unison as the matriarch of this family raise your glasses, and everyone did and everyone drank and never saw such pleasing people . 

You’d never know what my family was really like but yet they grandma said regal drinking that wine and then she looked at everyone and suddenly the lights they shivered and shim and flickered and there was thunder and lightning and the candles blew out and they said take it easy grandma take it easy, grandma. 

“You have disappointed Grandma you cheese hunting rat shits. Grandma will have to leave this earthly plane and go find her legs. Thanks to the fuck up of modern science, but before I go, I want you to know how pissed off you all made me.”

Later on after the paramedics and folks in the hazmats had left and my cousin Sadie, who had been with her homeboy Grady and missed the party came and got me she explained everything somehow someway my great Grammy she had this giant parachute bolted to the ceiling and filled with years worth of her urine that she had been somehow getting up into this parachute in this hermetically sealed parachute as if by telekinesis.

I didn’t know she was famous. They had put her away when she was young after an incident at the prom but how that led to Grams poisoning the whole Family’s intestines with Old Lace Merlot, and then dousing the table in a monsoon of vintage piss, well I was in shock.

Her last words to me as her mouth foamed from the draino were, “I’m gonna get you rich!”
