It was her mantra. 

“I’m gonna get you. I’m gonna get you Dolores. Are your parents awake? 

What about your aunts and uncles? What about your cousins? Did you get me my Benadryl? My allergies are acting up something awful today.”

Grandma‘s allergies were always awful. She was always coughing and sneezing and complaining and it was my job to keep her company day after day, week after week up in that dusty attic room. 

And here I was, only in the sixth grade and on what they call the spectrum. 

I mean, I needed to work on my boundaries, is what the school shrink with the stutter had said. Or tried to.

I had no life is what I’m trying to say. 

A girl in the sixth grade should have a life. My family life was no life. I questioned whether they were even capable of being classified as a life form.

My family was no bowl of fruit, no walk in the park. It was a horror show. It was Halloween every goddamn day, and they were made up for the make up, what, with the fake butt implants, the fake titties, the fillers and botard. 

“Beauty is always natural, Dolores.”

“Yes, Grammy Carrie.”

I don’t know who they thought they were, but we had a very strange background of gypsies from Transylvania with a little hillbilly thrown in, I think it was on my great, great grandfather, Heinz McMuggin’s side

“Doloresssss!!! Get me another beer!!!!!”

You did not contradict great grandma Carrie. She was bedridden with sores on her face and sputum and mucus that would just sometimes erupt as projectiles in one’s general direction, and she could strike at anytime at all. There was no warning. There was no preparation that could be taken other than to avoid my grandmother entirely.

As I said, being in the sixth grade, I could not avoid her entirely. In fact, I was relegated to the role of her caregiver, caretaker, companion, and confidante.

Oh, how could I forget her personal shopper as well.

Seriously, when I wasn’t getting Benadryl to try to keep the mucus at bay she was having me buy the weirdest things online for her. 

Grandma‘s eyesight was not too good so she would make me do everything for her. Read everything, explaining it to describe it, maybe probably purchase it if it was weird enough and then she would grab it from me upon arrival with arthritic talons tattooed with the words, “Hell’s Angel” and tell me to get lost. 

Tell me to get lost like a little goat, who’s been hit in the head with a tire iron and left for dead in the desert. 

Here was the deal. 

Grandma had diabetes and had to have one of her legs removed, which happened, but unfortunately, the leg that got removed was the good one, so then, then they had to take the bad one once they figured out the fubar. 

Now, two personal injury lawyers and a decade later, it seem grandma was sitting on about $14 million with interest because there was shenanigans with the departure or discovery. At least that’s what I heard my uncle Ernie say. 

Uncle Ernie was constipated real bad from that low carb diet. 

Aunty Gin was looking for the Metamucil and they had it but not the orange one and he got a bad temper uncle Ernie do, and he act like he wants to kick the goat in the cat, but he always choke the chicken and leave it at that..

Anyway, so grandma Carrie, she all fucked up, but she won’t die. Talking about her legacy and every time she do that lights be flickering and Herbie be whining something terrible in the corner.

And now, here I am, plain old Dolores in the sixth grade, whose life seems to be dedicated to wiping Carrie’s heinie,  getting her her beer, dealing with her allergies and sputum projectiles, basically just trying to keep my family together because they can’t touch the diabetes money till grandma Carrie die.

And gram no fool, and cause she say I can’t take it with me but you gotta wait for it and they always be arguing about keeping her here, at home in the attic, away from what Ernie call, “them rest home vultures.” He kept saying Dolores can, “get her her beer.”

You gotta wait for it. I gonna get you, Dolores.

Grammy Carrie say. Dolores you gotta wait and I gonna get you. Then Carrie pointed the crooked finger at me and I heard a light bulb pop in the hallway casting her sore covered face in flickering shadow play.

“Wait for it and take care of grandma cause grandma took care of you all so grandma gonna keep taking care of you all until you all taken care of real good.

And then grandma will know she done what had to be done and she would not have to be owing no piss and vinegar god or demon it’s due.”

Aside from me, the only person granny talk to was some guy named Stephen. 

She made me call him on the phone and then she made me go away, but sometimes I would listen and the things they talked about sounded very lovely like there was an intimate deep connection that my brain cannot quite wrap itself around, but that yet somehow rimmed with electricity and the promise of apocalypse, dystopia and just miseries too numerous to enumerate at this particular moment while I’m trying to explain how grandma kept threatening me, threatening me, telling me, she’s going to get me. 

She’s gonna get me. 

I’m gonna get you Dolores. That’s how she said it all sinister. I’m gonna get you Dolores! Now! Now go get me some Benadryl. And Budweiser. And make it snappy.

Go get me a parachute. 

Go get me these giant tents, go get me this , go get me that, and I always say, yes, cause I’m scared of granny. 

Sometimes I can feel the earth shake. And this smell. 

Sometimes there is electricity is in the air when granny get pissed.

Gram Carrie say it’s like a storm passes Dolores, but you never done what they done. 

You never do what they do but grandma know everything, even about you. I’m gonna get you Dolores. She’ll see soon your dirty Momma dearest. My sweet, sweet child , they will all see soon.

Then Carrie cackle and listen to Dracula on audio.

And one day, grandma was really excited. I came into her attic room and she had been trying to see something on her screen and she said to me, “you gotta see this!!!! Get grandma her magnifying glass over there.”

“You know grandma like to pee the bed and get me that magnifying glass, my little chica and I’ll show you.”

It was an advert for some kind of protein bar that was from Africa and had this tree bark from some lost ancient tribe that had spawned endowed princes.

Advert claimed this bark so beautiful that 90 year-old king living ready to croak grew big immortal stones and sired 99 bastards, living to 340 years old.

And all his bastards it was said could see for miles and even that they could smell a pig from a mile away. 

They knew what was up and yet somehow grandma with the electricity crackling around her couldn’t see what was right before her eyes.”

“It’s a scam, Great Grammy.”


Grandma gave me a look. A look that looked like how dare you question me insolent child!?

I could feel the look in my bones so I could hear her words in my head. 

I could hear everything she had said, even before she thought to say it and the next thing I know we were ordering a case of them special Miami dracula protein bars with the special herb bark.

That magic herb bark do all. Forget about your aloe vera,  forget about your Australian tea tree oil, that shit is all snake juice. 

What happened with grandma wanting them bars and when they came I can’t explain. 

I never saw nobody drink so much beer in my life. She said she had new purpose, a new mission.

Then she eat the Dracula bars and chug beer, case after case and all kinds of beers but just one kinda protein replenishment bar.

It was like she was running her own brewery in that bed, and I just kept carting away the bottles. Gram was thirsty.

 She never got out of that bed. She just kept drinking and drinking with unquenchable, undeniable thirst for the future, for reality, for her final mission that she kept telling me…..

I’m gonna get you Dolores


 I will get you and it will be the last thing I do and then the “get me” day finally came, 


THE FAM REUNION

Not only were all my uncles and aunts and cousins in the house, but we opened up the backyard, which usually they never did cuz it was just filled to the brim with Herbie-dog shit but it was largely ignored and everybody commingled with cheap beer, old canine shit and dreams of a slice of that gammy fortune.

They came in in their American made vehicles toting busted down trailers. 

We had a real good time. 

We had Miami potato salad and we had the German macaroni salad, the salad with little squares of hard cheese.

Grandma stayed in bed, but she tried to keep eating protein replenishment bars and guzzling more beer.

Not fat grandma just kept drinking and drinking and drinking, and she kept rubbing her nose or throat every time I came up to get her some more beer and take away the empties, three in each hand. Gram say to me, I’m gonna get you and today’s the day. 

My child today is the day she say and I will feel a snap crackle and pop in the air.

My hair was up on end and I was afraid to touch the door knob. There was spark. It hurt it hurt me.

“The parachute Dolores. That was the sign. You really can buy anything online. 

I only needed the will. And to let Stephen know, he’d always be my Daddy. 

Now my child, you’re too young to understand but Grandma has no use for money. 

Look at these arthritic hands. Look at my gnarled face. I was once beautiful and now I look like a raisin in the Civil War sun. 

Everything is all gnarled up. Grammy is all gnarly gnarled. Grandma‘s all fucking fucked up on decades. I’m 103, legless, trying to stare at a fucking goat, do you understand that’s why I drink beer all day! I had no purpose. 

I got no legs. 

They took the wrong one and then they took the right one and then, I was just in this bed and I will get you for that you little ass wiper.


I don’t know what I would do with that disgusting clan of orangutans, no that’s an insult to orangutans, that disgusting clan of vipers that we must call, “the family”my child. They live, they breathe, and they wait for me. They wait for my money. 

Vultures in the outfield 

It makes me sick. 

So, I needed a golden parachute. Something greater than mere money.”

“Grandma!!! What’s fatter than money?” I asked.

“That’s how you buy all that shit online. You use money. Nothings fatter and better than money.”


Silly child silly child now you will soon know what is who. Grandma got the parachute.

 It’s for the family gathering when all gathers around downstairs to sing Satanic songs. 

Grandma will remember a part of her childhood from 1976 when she was young and cruelty, the cruelty of her school mates, her acquaintances, the authority figures, almost everyone, of everyone hating on grandma because she was different with her freckles with her freckles and her mousy ways. Just cause Grammy was hot for John Travolta.


Well tonight, tonight grandma can get you. 

Granny gonna get you back.

Get grandma‘s golden parachute now!! Go! Go go downstairs with your family go downstairs they’ll get grandma soon; the matriarch.

Gram spat and it hit the far wall and stuck slid.

Uncle Fred told me this was it.

Grammy Carrie’s last supper.

I took my seat at the table and everyone looked grim, but they also look greedy. They look greedy as cats at a fish convention during a riot.

Five minutes later, grandma sat at the head of the table regarding us skeptical like. 

She said I want us to have one drink together, in unity and unison, as the matriarch of this family. Bend an elbow bitches. Raise your glasses!!!

They did and everyone drank and I never saw such pleasing people I wonder where my real fam went. 

You’d never know what my family was really like but yet they join grandma in some regal drinking all that wine spodey~Odie and then….

Then she looked at everyone sipping and sucking up and suddenly the lights they shivered and shimmered and flickered and there was thunder and lightning and the candles blew out and they said take it easy grandma take it easy, grandma.

“You have disappointed Grandma you cheese hunting rat shits!

Grandma will have to leave this earthly plane any moment and go find her long lost legs. Thanks to the fuck up of modern science, but before I go, I want you to know how pissed off you all made me. I will return the piss.”

Later on, after the paramedics and folks in the hazmats had left, and my cousin Sadie, who had been with her homeboy Grady and missed the party, came and got me.

Sadie explained everything.

Somehow, someway, my great Grammy, she had this giant parachute bolted to the dining room ceiling. She filled the parachute like a giant bladder with years worth of her accumulated urine that she had been somehow getting up into this parachute, in this hermetically sealed parachute, as if by telekinesis.

I didn’t know Carrie was sort of famous. They had put her away when she was young after an incident at the prom but how that led to Grams poisoning the whole Family’s intestines with Old Lace Merlot, and then dousing the table in a monsoon of vintage piss, well I was in shock.

And like I said I only in the 6th grade and on the spectrum.

Granny Carrie’s last words to me, as her mouth foamed from the draino were, “I’m gonna get you! Get you rich!”
