Context:

I was recently walking to my favorite coffeshop to work on some writing on my laptop. On the way, I noticed just off the sidewalk, in between a church and its graveyard, was one of those small, wooden “Free Library” stands I hadn’t seen on my usual path before. Out of curiosity, I looked within it. Among two other books was a very thin yet hardcover book titled “The Boy in the Thal” with its printed date unknown. It was about a boy roughly 11 years younger than me. Here is the story it told:

\-

The sun had been overhead for quite some time. This was a long-term reality that became a short-term truth, as he had been told this was the longest they had gone without a break in the heat. He could feel it in the sand, under the callouses that acted now as shoes. He hadn’t set out with much in mind. Maybe, at first, he told himself he was looking for a tree, a bird, anything that moved with him. But now he walked because he had already begun, and the thought of turning around felt no more convincing than pressing on.

The Thal stretched in all directions, not empty exactly, but unbothered. The occasional scrubby bush clung to the ground, shaped low to the Earth, somehow surviving. The occasional wind provided just enough relief to move forward. He never expected a welcome, but its absence, or further absence, though expected, was unsettling. Forced to be mature at his age for a seventeen year-old boy, he knew that, for now, it was enough that something else was here. His skin would burn. Maybe peel. It would heal and blister again. Somehow, that was enough for him as well. Enough for him to feel somewhat included in the environment.

He had left without much. He didn’t want to have to carry anything in his hands and waste needed energy. He drank a large amount of water before leaving, ate a flat piece of bread, the t-shirt and shorts he was wearing, and left. His shoes couldn’t be put on during the altercation with his father, his mother watching and allowing it, before the boy ran out of the home. What was his home.

Give or take, the boy had been walking in a straight path for maybe three hours. He was determined without a goal, because that’s all he had left. About forty-five minutes ago he had released the water he drank before leaving, and he knew he would need more water soon. Timely, his vision began to slightly blur. Dehydration wasn’t a great issue yet, and he miraculously didn’t feel the heat was debilitating him. The wind came again, a gust stronger than before. This worried the boy, as he knew if the heat didn’t yet harm him, a sand storm would. He covered his face with his arm, but just like the other gusts of wind, it was only brief. Putting his arm back down. Around two hundred meters ahead laid a dome tent. The boy was relieved. He had resigned to the fact that he must indeed be tired and hadn’t noticed the tent before.

The boy arrived at the outside of the tent. What stood out to the boy was what can be described as the tent’s “attire.” It was draped in layers of purple satin, a thick, heavy material. To the ground, the ends of the satin were large golden tassels that dressed the tent’s perimeter. Here and there in the satin, what seemed to be hand-threaded stars were present, also in gold, making the tent itself look reminiscent of someone’s depiction of a clear night sky in the middle of the day. It was beautiful.

“Hello?” the boy said toward the draped entrance of the tent. Cautious and expected, he didn’t want to enter without making himself known. There was no response. “Hello?” the boy called out again. No response. 

The boy slowly pushed to the side of the entrance some layers of the satin to peer inside. Sitting cross-legged on a woven rug was a person equally draped in satin, maybe an indigo color, adjacent to an extension of the tent itself. Their face was shadowed by the satin over their head. An identical rug was laid about two meters in front of the individual. The person was pouring steaming water from a golden kettle, the kettle hot from an unknown heating source, into a cup holding tea leaves. The person placed the kettle back onto the ground, the sand. Besides what was described, there was nothing else in the tent. The boy slowly entered.

“Hello. I’m sorry, I’ve been walking for a while now. I’m thirsty. I need some help.”

Face still shadowed, the person’s head turned to look up at the boy. They replied. “Please, sit.” The person gestured toward the rug in front of them. Their voice equally unidentifiable.

The boy walked over to the rug and sat. Sitting down, the boy recognized the aching in his calf and thigh muscles, the tension releasing. From behind the kettle, the person pulled another cup. The individual poured the hot water into the cup, and handed it to the boy. What the boy really needed was something cold, but he took what he could get. Taking a sip, he felt reinvigorated. He couldn’t recognize the type of tea from its taste, or even the appearance of the leaves, but the boy knew he was refreshed.

“Thank you” the boy told the person. The person nodded. There was a pause. The boy asked, “Are you stranded? Or are you traveling?” The person replied, “No.”

There was another pause. “Why are you here?” the boy asked. The person replied, “I’m here for you.”

Though startled for a moment by the ominous response, the boy assumed this person must be some sort of spiritual nomad doing a public service. This wasn’t unusual. Similar to missionary work, but less intrusive. They must set-up their tent here in the desert often just in case anyone, like me, needed assistance. But that doesn’t explain the need for extravagant presentation and the lack of supplies they had.

“For me?” the boy replied. “For you. What do you need?” the person stated. The boy looked down at his tea. “Well, nothing now.” “Are you sure?” the person said.

The boy thought. The answer was clear, but for the boy, it was layered. “What do I need?” he thought to himself.  “What… part is needing?” While he thought, there was a low, vibrational hum. Ever so slight, but ever so present. Head still turned in the direction of the boy, it was coming from the sitting person.

“Who?” the person stated. The boy was shocked. The person knew. The person in fact knew his thoughts.  “How… how do you know?” the boy replied. A gust of wind blew sand into the purple satin hut. “I’m here for you” the person replied.

The boy thought some more, then replied. “I don’t know. I mean, I’m told I don’t know.” “Hmm” the person responded, and took a sip of their tea.

The wind blew again, but this time, it didn’t stop. The sand pelted the dome. The wind grew stronger and stronger. The boy became concerned.

“What’s going on?” the boy asked. The person did not reply. The wind became unbearably rough even within the protection the tent continued to provide. The boy worried the tent would lift up and fly away, leaving them to be stuck in the sand storm.

“What do we do?” the boy asked. The person did not reply.

This is when the howling began. At first, the boy thought it was the whipping of the wind, but as sound got louder, he realized it was indeed voices, howling in pain. More and more, a cacophony of pain-ridden moaning turned screaming began. Pure suffering. It began to circle and surround the tent.

“What’s happening? What do we do? I’m scared” the boy asked the person. The person replied, “Who?” The boy didn’t reply. The speed of the voices circling increased, and somehow they became even louder. Wailing in pain and agony. 

“I don’t know. I don’t know” the boy replied. “Who?” the person responded.

Another, more clear voice arose from the spiraling mass of screaming. Not from outside, but inside the tent. The boy looked down into his teacup and saw himself. A reflection. But this reflection was also screaming like the voices on the outside. The boy held the cup away, but still looked inside. The reflection, wailing, began to change. 

The boy’s reflection got older. Leaving young adulthood, into middle-age, the reflection’s screaming got deeper in tone, but painfully persistent. The reflection’s image then entered it’s senior years, the screaming becoming raspy. The boy, still watching, began to softly cry. Though the screaming from outside the tent remained, the screaming from the teacup stopped, and the reflection faded away.

“Alright” the boy yelled. “I know.”

“Who?” the person asked yet again.

“Yes” the boy replied. “Yes.”

The person slowly nodded and took another sip of their tea. The screaming from outside the tent, as quickly as it came, faded away.

The boy dropped his teacup and ran out of the tent. He continued to run in the direction he was going in before he came across the tent. This time, the boy knew where he was going. While running, a small smile formed on his face. 

He knew, and so he went.
