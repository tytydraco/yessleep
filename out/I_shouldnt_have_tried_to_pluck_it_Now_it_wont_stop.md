I shouldn't have tried to pluck it. Jesus Christ, I shouldn't have touched it at all.

It sprouted from my left nipple like a lone antenna. Just one. Thick and black and about three inches long, standing up like it had every right to be there.

I laughed when I saw it.  Everyone gets one now and then, right? A hormonal glitch, a cosmic joke. What the fuck else do you do?

The tweezers were cold. My hand was steady. I thought about calling my sister Eilen, making a joke about getting old, about bodies doing weird shit. I thought about a lot of things that don't matter now.

When I pulled, something gave inside me.

Not like skin tearing. More like a thread being drawn through fabric. Through meat. The hair came out slow, elactic and alive.

It kept coming.

I'm not talking metaphorically. I mean I pulled six inches of hair out of my fucking nipple and it was still going, still sliding out warm and wet, and I couldn't make myself let go because what the fuck, what the FUCK !

At first, I thought I’d lost my mind. But the hair didn’t break. It just… kept emerging.

My knees hit the bathroom tiles. The hair pooled between my thighs, coiling like something alive, but my hand kept pulling, pulling, and it felt good, that's the thing ... it felt like relief, like popping an stuborn acne pimple.

I called in sick, Told them food poisoning.. My voice sounded fine. That's what scared me most.

By noon the bathroom looked like a drain had vomited. Hair everywhere, slick and dark, and it was still coming out of me in one unbroken line. I tried wrapping it around the shower curtain rod just to keep it off the floor.

I need you to understand: The scissors wouldn't cut it! I tried kitchen shears, box cutters, I tried biting through it and nearly choked when a piece touched the back of my throat.

That night I couldn't sleep because of the endless pulling sensation. Not painful exactly. Insistent. Like something in my chest was being slowly, carefully unraveled. I lay on my back and felt it moving inside me, through my lungs, between my ribs ...

The apartment filled up fast after that.

I don't know how many days. Three? Five? Who knows ... time got weird. The hair had reached the kitchen, was wrapping around table legs, snaking into cupboards. It smelled like the inside of a animal's den. Like fever-sweat and iron and something sweet-rotten, like meat left out too long.

My neighbors started knocking. I watched their shadows move under the door and said nothing. Mrs. Chen from downstairs was shouting about black mold coming through her ceiling. I wanted to tell her it wasn't mold.

Last night I tried to find the end of it. Followed the original strand back through the apartment, through the nests and tangles and black masses piled in corners.

I ended up back at the bathroom sink.

An then in the mirror I saw .

My nipple wasn't a nipple anymore. It was a hole. Wide as a quarter, the edges puckered and glistening. I could see down into it, into myself, and there was no blood, no tissue. Just hair. Just infinite coils of black hair descending into some vast internal space I never knew I had.

I put my finger in.

Something  grabbed it. It tightened around my finger and pulled gently, welcomingly, and I understood then that it wanted me to go deeper. To reach in and find what was down there, what had been growing in the cathedral of my chest all this time.

I heard the voice then. Not words. A feeling that translated to words: *Almost ready ?*

Almost ready for what?

Sometimes I hear Mrs. Chen screaming.

Sometimes I hear sirens in the distance.

But mostly I hear the whispering friction of endless growth, the soft sliding sound of something vast unfurling itself through the needle-hole of my body.

My phone rang yesterday. I don't remember where I left it. The sound came from inside the mass somewhere, muffled, then stopped. Later I found it braided into a thick rope of hair near the window. The screen was cracked but still glowing. 47 missed calls.

This morning I woke up and couldn't feel my legs. When I looked down they were gone ... just gone ... not cut off, just unmade, unraveled into millions of keratine strands that spread across the floor and up the walls. I can still move them. I can feel the ceiling against what used to be my feet.

My arms are going too. The fingers first. They're unwinding.

I'm not scared anymore.I should be terrified, should be clawing at the door, but instead I feel this huge dark relief, like finally letting go after holding on too long.

The voice is louder now: *Ready ?*

I don't know what happens next.

But I can feel myself spreading. Growing. Reaching through pipes and wires, through cracks in concrete, following power lines and water mains, finding other bodies, other holes, other places to emerge.

If you find a hair growing somewhere wrong, somewhere lonely — don't touch it.

Because it's not growing from you.

It's growing through you.

And the thing on the other end isn't trying to escape.

It's trying to pull you down into itself.

It's trying to make you part of the weaving.

And god help me, god help me ....

I want to go.

I want to go so bad.
