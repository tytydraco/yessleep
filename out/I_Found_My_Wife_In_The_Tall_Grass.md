I didn't mean for it to end up this way. I only ever wanted to create a peaceful life for myself until she got in the way. I was 24 when I first met Elena at our local caf√©, ordering my usual iced latte and settling down to work on the latest entry in my failing online blog. I remember looking out the window, staring at the looming skyscrapers; their peaks reaching into the amber skies, calling out to something above. I felt hope for a fleeting moment before taking a sip of my ever-melting drink and wondering to myself 'When will this all change?'



I didn't even notice that she'd sat herself across from me at the cramped booth, but before I knew it we were deep into an intense conversation. She skipped the small talk, opting instead to just let herself into my world. We sat at that small coffee shop table for hours talking about the world and its wonders, our hopes and dreams, and what we wanted to do for herself. We clicked instantly. That little meeting became our daily ritual.



I'd order my usual, sit down, and then a few moments later she'd be there. This went on for a few months before we finally decided to make our relationship into something more. I'd found out she moved here for work around a year back but had still been struggling to make connections. No surprises there, it's a small town who aren't exactly welcoming to newcomers. But I bit the bullet, I officially made her my girlfriend on her 25th birthday and from there we just completely blossomed into the perfect couple. Another year after that, we were married and living together in a small farmhouse on the outskirts of the city. 



That brings us to a year ago exactly. I will never forget the night I received that phone call.



I came back from visiting some old friends as they were passing through and wanted to get some dinner. Catch up, y'know? We were out later than expected but I still managed to make my way home in good time and get back to Elena.



When I opened the front door, something was off. The lights were all on, and her perfume lingered in the air, but Elena was nowhere to be seen. I searched the whole house looking for her but she wasn't anywhere. Eventually I thought to look outside; maybe she was just getting some fresh air. I was right. I found her just as she was entering the tall grass behind our house. A bit strange, sure, but not out of character for Elena. She'd always loved that grass as it reminded her of childhood games she'd play with her family growing up. 



I called out to her, but she just turned and gestured for me to follow. Of course, I obliged and ran in after her. It felt like hours we were out there in the dark, running through dense forests and playing silly games. It felt so good to just be out and enjoying this time with her; reliving her childhood, getting muddy, chasing each other, until eventually we collapsed in each others arms. 



I'd been feeling my phone buzz the whole time we were out but I didn't bother to check up on it. I was with Elena and that's all that mattered in the moment. Eventually though, while laying with her and looking up at the stars I decided to check..



25 Missed calls

45 Unread messages



All from Elena.



I wasn't sure what I was seeing; how could she have left me all this while I've been with her the whole time. I looked at her, she smiled at me.. but something was off.



Her eyes, a pale shade of grey, and her skin seemed.. loose. 



Another phone call was coming through so I picked up;



'Mason, she isn't me.'



My blood ran cold. Who is this woman I'm with? Where is Elena? My head was swimming and I wasn't sure what to do. I watched as she blinked, each eye slightly out of sync. I noticed the laboured breathing, and the crooked smile as her skin creased around her muscle. She leant closer to me, her now raspy voice cutting through the air as she whispered 'I... love... you..'



Each drawn out word strained and broke, I couldn't believe what was happening. I got up to run away but I felt her closing in on me. I wasn't far from home but in the midnight black, I had no hope of navigating it with speed. I could hear her footsteps gaining on me, her voice calling out to me, clawing at me like daggers. I had to get away.



Hearing her stumble gave me all the strength I needed to carry on. I managed to find my way back home and crashed through the back door, almost falling over every piece of furniture before I realised something;

The smell.



That god awful smell.



The scent of copper filled my lungs, both nauseating and sobering to the whole situation. I found my way into the bathroom, the source of the smell. As I neared in on the door it took everything I had not to heave. I couldn't bare to look inside, but I knew I had to.



The door creaked open, slowly revealing to me my worst nightmare. Elena was in the bathtub, barely alive. Her skin.. it was gone. She looked up at me, somehow clinging onto the little life she had left. I broke, and all I heard was primal screams, just pouring out of me. I was supposed to be here with her, I was supposed to protect her.



I moved closer, unsure of what to do or say. I wanted to hold my wife, comfort her and tell her everything was okay. I wanted to kiss her, to feel her on me one last time but I knew I couldn't. It destroyed me seeing her like this and I prayed it was all a nightmare, that I'd wake up tomorrow with all of this just being some dark, twisted figment of my imagination.



Then the thought hit me, how had my wife been put here? She wasn't here earlier.. I would've found her, and been with her. The other version of her.. that horrible disfigured creature must have somehow made it back before me and moved Elena here, tormenting me and showing me her handiwork.



Then I heard her, crawling up the stairs, calling my Elena.



I looked into my wife's eyes.. and watched as the life faded out of them. I snapped. I screamed and cried, begging her to come back but I knew it was no use. So I ran, and I ran, and I didn't stop running. I managed to slip past that.. thing.. and I ran to my car. It broke my heart leaving my wife like that, but I had to go. I had to leave the one thing I'd ever loved behind.



I managed to drive for a few hours before settling down in a hotel, and from there I was just hopping from one city to another, hoping that whatever I saw in the tall grass was far behind.



But that brings me to today. One year from when it happened. I never wanted to put this down in words, hoping it will somehow erase itself from my memory, but now I know that will never happen. For the last hour now there's been a tapping at my room door. A gentle, feeble tapping. But I know it's real. I hear her calling me from the other side. 'Honey.. It's me. Let me in.'
