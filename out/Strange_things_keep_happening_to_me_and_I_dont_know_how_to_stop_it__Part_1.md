I stand in the middle of my kitchen, eyes darting around from counter to counter, searching. My phone is missing, which is nothing unusual. I have a horrible habit of forgetting where I last put it down and with the incredibly busy days I have, it could be anywhere in the house. The last place I remember it being was here in the kitchen, sitting next to me on the countertop as I chopped up lettuce for a salad. It was when I went to sit down at the dining room table, salad in hand, that I noticed it was missing. It’s been what seems like 10 minutes and I can’t find it anywhere. Annoying, especially annoying when I have emails to reply to while I eat. That’s my life lately, work and work and more work. I’m practically drowning in it. This small interruption that may present itself as innocuous is just another brick being thrown onto the pile that loads on my mind and more importantly my time. I groan and head to the other side of the house, towards my room, my husband presumably inside. My room is at the end of a long hallway with several other doors before it, notably the bathroom. The usual spot I find my phone hiding when this happens. This is my least favorite form of hide and seek.

“Matthew?” I call before reaching my bedroom door. I can usually find him huddled up in here. He hardly goes anywhere else in the house since the accident and the resulting injury to his leg. The thought of which is generally saddening to think about for longer than 2 seconds so I try my hardest to avoid doing so. I think of him all the time obviously, but the accident…I just can’t bear to. A mumbled “what” comes from behind the door which confirms that he’s in there. I press my body up against it before turning the knob, keeping close I poke my head in.

“Honey?” I half whisper. It’s dark in the room, only a small reading light is casting light but of course not actually being used. It sits near the foot of the bed. A book you would assume it was being perched on is not to be seen. Instead, I know he was using it to illuminate the small mini-figures he’s taken to making as he recovers. Random for him but it keeps him busy. Why he refuses to work on them in any more light than that of a small reading light, I have no idea.  

My husband himself is on the side of the bed furthest away from me, facing away. He’s a small man so the shape of his body under the covers blends in among the other pillows and blankets we have on the bed. In fact, due to how dark it was, I may not have even known he was in the room if he had not replied to my call. After a few moments the shape starts to move and I can see my husband turn his upper body towards me. Half of his face is visible to me now and I can see he is wearing a smile, the feeling was not behind it, however. 

“Yes, June?” He says in a low but comforting voice. It’s good to hear him talk at all even if it’s for meaningless moments such as asking him to ping my phone. We don’t get much time to ourselves with my work schedule. 

“Can you play the missing phone sound, the find-my-iphone app thingy.” 

I see him nod and turn to face the other wall again, probably searching for his phone on the night table next to the bed. After a few seconds he says “Did it”.

Now comes the second half of the game. Locating the sound. After a moment I hear a soft ringing coming from, I think, somewhere in the kitchen. But I swear I looked everywhere in there. I throw Mathew a quick I love you as I make my way back down the hallway and into the kitchen. But when I get there I realize the sound was not coming from the kitchen but from below it. This gives me a slight pause. The laundry room? Now, I am certain I haven’t been down there recently, in fact I don’t think I’ve been down there at all today. I try to rack my brain for a reasonable answer but such an answer is lost on me. How could I forget going down there in between being in the kitchen and going to the dining room to eat. It doesn’t make any sense. 

Still running through the series of events that led up to losing my phone I walk towards the basement door. The doorknob was weirdly cold to the touch which made me refrain from opening it for a few seconds. I admit that some part of me half-expected there to be a horrible surprise waiting behind it, a ghoul at the bottom of the stairs staring up at me waiting. But I take a deep breath and open it anyway and there’s…nothing, because of course there’s nothing. Don’t be crazy. You forgot you went down there and everything is okay. I can’t believe something so small has me so startled.
I go down the stairs and follow the sound towards the laundry room, flicking on the light at the bottom of the stairs as I do. The sound stops at the worst possible moment when I finally get to the laundry room. I don’t see my phone. Dammit. I don’t feel like searching in here for 10 minutes so I call for Matthew loudly. The floors are thin enough that I’m somewhat confident he would hear. And sure enough a few moments later he calls back.
         
“WHAT.”

“AGAIN,” I yell.

Another few moments go by and the familiar ringing happens again, this time much louder. It’s coming from a pile of clothes to the left of me. I walk over and lift a black long-sleeve shirt from the top of the pile and beneath it is my phone. A peculiar feeling has started making its way up my body. This is so fucking strange. I still can’t make any sense of how it would get down here. I wish I could just will the feeling I have away and get on with my life but I’m too anxious of a person to do so. I know I will carry this with me for at least the rest of the day, lurking around in the back of my mind as I eat and finish up the work that is waiting for me. I turn to leave the laundry room and yell up a “thanks” to Matthew. I stop to wait for a reply but it never comes. Despite how weird I feel, I decide to chalk this up to him not hearing me. The floors are thin, yes, but the words are muffled nonetheless and it would be easy for somebody in my room to not hear anything if they were listening to music or watching a show.

I shrug and walk back upstairs with my phone but again I am forced to pause. I am stopped at the top of the stairs, in the doorway, staring into the kitchen. Everything is where it should be but for some reason it feels different. Gloomier, like the color had been sucked out of it and now I could only look at it in greyscale. The air seemed different too, heavier and thick. Moving was harder, if not by the most miniscule fraction. But I was uncomfortably aware of it all. 

A sudden urge to check in on Matthew penetrated my thoughts. Why didn’t he answer? What only a few minutes before seemed innocent was now masked by something so very sinister. Is he okay? The question pounded itself into my head in synchronicity with the ever-growing sound of my footsteps. It started as mere walking but was now a hurried and desperate run to my bedroom. It felt as though the wood was falling from beneath me and I would soon fall if I did not reach my husband fast enough. I get to my room with bated breath. I fling the door open and scramble inside and am hit by the most horrifying sound I could ever think of. There is complete silence. Besides the door banging against the wall, the room sits in a silence that was overwhelming in its nothingness. My attention is drawn to where Matthew was the last time I spoke to him. Empty. It is so obvious even in the darkness. I can feel that peculiar feeling now bubbling up fast inside of me. Manifesting itself in the form of puke ready to spew from my mouth. But I hold it in. He can’t move very far on his own, and even then not quickly. I would know if he was moving around. I would hear him. What the fuck, what the fuck, what the fuck. 

I back out of the room and call out his name and then again when I get no reply. I keep calling out to him for at least another minute as I run back into the kitchen and the conjoined living room. It’s incredibly dark now, turning on the lights as I search does nothing to aid me. The shadows loom high and it feels like they are slowly consuming more and more of my vision. Panic is setting in. Having looked in every other part of the house I realize I missed one. The bathroom. I head towards the hallway and when I am reaching out to the bathroom doorknob is when I hear it. A heavy thudding, as if somebody is running inside the house. This makes me begin to cry. A truth I can’t begin to accept has welcomed itself to the pits of mind. That’s not my husband. The bellowing noise is now coming from all directions, traveling across from the left to the right of the house again and again. Getting louder each time but seemingly not any closer. It’s incredibly haunting in that way. Everything is happening so fast, I have no time to take in anything. I have no time to think clearly for even a second.

Not knowing what else to do, I practically throw myself into the bathroom door, tumbling down onto the cold tiles. Hopeless is the only word to describe what I am feeling at this moment. And then I hear a stifled groan. Looking up, I notice it’s coming from the bathtub. I crawl to the edge of the tub and am greeted by my husband, shirtless and shaking. Staring at the wall, a hollow and sunken look in his eyes. He’s muttering something, and between my sobs and the continuous pounding outside the hallway I am not able to make out any of it. The vomit has returned and I had no strength to fight it this time. Turning to the side, I throw up violently. Matthew does not react. My mouth and throat burn, I gag several times after and cough what little was left in me out. Still my stomach is turning. A hole is being dug inside. I turn back to my husband and the sight is just as horrible as the first time. 

“Matthew, what happened? Are you okay? What happened” I repeat this over and over but he does not respond. It’s like he’s not there. Just a husk sitting in my bathtub. I don’t know what to do. And then my phone starts ringing. Deep in my pocket. I shove my hand into my pocket and awkwardly dig for it. Pulling it out I look at the screen and the light is almost blinding. On it are 7 letters. UNKNOWN. 

“Answer the Phone.”

I freeze. I hadn’t noticed when it happened but now I do. The running has stopped. Oh God. I wish it hadn’t. No matter how terrible the sound was. No matter much despair it filled the recesses of my body with. Whatever was running now had reached its destination. The words were spoken in the most impossibly deep voice. It attacked my ear drums and threatened to linger inside. It spoke in the color black. Its sound was a sludge that filled the space it was spoken in.  It sticks to your clothes and leaves a revolting smell. Hot tar that traps you inside. Absorbing you and muffling your cries for help. 

I turn towards the door and almost faint when I see what spoke the noxious words. Almost completely filling the doorway is a large black figure. I can’t make out any details despite the moon light that shone on it from the bathroom window. Everything inside me tightens. It is as if I am staring at fear personified. As that is the only emotion I am capable of feeling at this moment. Unadulterated fear.

I don’t have time to think.

The figure lunges at me. 

I scream.

I….I….I’m standing at the top of the stairs. Staring into my kitchen. I gasp. What just happened? I again run to my bedroom and fling open the door to reveal my husband in the same spot he was when I left him. Of course he was there.

This was just the beginning of the occurrences. It’s been 2 weeks. I don’t know what to do.
