I’d had quite a boring day at office today, and I’m famished. I fidget with my keys, trying not to rest my derriere on the rock-hard bus stop seats. I pull out my phone and see a text from my wife.

Looking forward to dinner today! Come home soon!

Right. We had to go to dinner today.

My thoughts silenced over the honking sound of the bus. I get ready to hop on, slide my bus card for the payment, but when I slide my card, the bus driver looks at me and literally grabs and squeezes my hand for 20 seconds straight, with a tightening grip that not even my dad could beat. I finally managed to slip out of his grasp and run inside the bus. I didn’t think much of it, until we reached my stop. The driver was gone… who was driving the bus?

Not letting my mind create any more conspiracy theories, I walked the entire way back, feeling as if something eerie was following me home. I shut the door behind me and tried to act nonchalant.

“Baby?”

“Yeah?”

What the hell was I thinking? Everything’s fine-

Before I know it, we’re walking to the restaurant.

We sit down, and a tall man hands us the menu. He’s so tall, that no matter how high I look, I can’t seem to find his head.

  
Substituting the very awkward silence between me and my wife, my phone starts ringing. I decide to ignore the call until my eyes hover towards the caller ID.

  
What the hell?

  
My wife’s calling me. What is going on?

As soon as I pick up the phone, the voice on the other side speaks.

  
“Michael? Where are you? I’ve been waiting for you.”

  
“Emma, stop playing with me. We’re in the restaurant already.”

  
“Michael, what the heck? WHO DID YOU TAKE WITH YOU?”

  
“IF THATS NOT YOU, THEN WHO IS SITTING IN FRONT OF ME RIGHT NOW?” I  
scream-whispered.

  
“Get the hell out of there right now.”

  
“Michael. I said get the hell out of there.”

  
“Michael. MICHAEL. **WHAT ARE YOU DOING.**”

  
I let my wife’s words blur

  
“MICHAEL!”

  
and slowly die out.

  
I’d decided I would play along until I could find a way to get the heck out of here.

“Who was that?” asked my “wife”.

“Uh… just my boss. He said I have to leave… like right now.”

“You’re going?” she asked in an intimidating voice. “No. Stay.”

“I’m so sorry- I have to go.”

**“No. Stay, Michael.”**

  
I bolted out the corridor as fast as I could, hearing an inhuman series of laughs behind me. I turned around to see if it was following me— but it looks like I was too fast for it.

Seeing the EXIT door, I crashed on it and shook the handle.

  
Shoot, it was locked.

  
I should have known. I bang on the door a series of times before my energy dies out and I slump there, in a corner near the door. I look around for any waiters/waitresses to ask for help, but there are none in sight. I run around helplessly, peeking through every kitchen and corridor there was, but nothing. I finally check one last corner, and my eyes brighten.

  
**E M E R G E N C Y    E X I T**

I kick open the door, and it really is what it looks like. I'm alive. I made it.

Now I just have to find Emma.

The only place I could get shelter was at a crappy abandoned hospital with half rotted-off beds, which wasn't the best idea, since the goddamn speaker kept re-announcing ---

"**Welcome to our hospital, that's nothing but safe, safe, safe!"**

&#x200B;

**"Welcome to our hospital, that's nothing but safe, safe, safe! "**

&#x200B;

**"Welcome to our hospital, that's nothing but safe, safe, safe! "**

Before I lost it, I packed my bags even before dawn started to break out and started walking. I had a plan to ask strangers for directions--- but there wasn't a soul here. I would have to navigate myself.

Before I even finalized my plan, I finally saw someone in the abandoned town. I rushed over, hoping they knew directions.

But when I took a few steps closer and enhanced my vision, I realized I was not happy to see them.
