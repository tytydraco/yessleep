So for some background I’m taking a dual credit college class for high school. Also, this was about 2 weeks ago so it’s not very fresh in my memory. Anyways, one of the classes our assignments for the weekend was to take some notes for a descriptive essay. My professor wanted us to go out and record notes on a place in our town which held sentimental significance. I chose a hiking trail I’d hike on a lot when I was younger. I also forgot until the last minute to do it and drove out to the trail during dusk. I pulled into the small parking lot and head out on the trail.

I got about 20 minutes in the hike and it was pretty dark to the point where I was using the flashlight on my phone. I had a weird feeling I was being watched as well and I kept turning my head around. I finally go to the little opening and sat down on a stump and started recording all the sensory stuff. I also took a few video recordings and audio recording. Before I left I watched the video to make sure I got everything I needed. I noticed a white face standing behind a tree and my heart absolutely sank. I looked where the face was recorded and there wasn’t anything there. I closed my notebook and started off toward my car through the forest. I live on the northern west coast so the forests are SUPER thick.

I was so unbelievably scared and it was extremely dark by now. I walked for about 10 minutes until I heard a really big snap and I stopped dead in my tracks and turned around. From afar I saw the same white face and I broke out in a sprint and mind I’m a big person and I was running unbelievably fast. After sprinting for about 10 minutes I got to my car and opened it. I got inside and like the cliché horror movie my car wouldn’t not start. I started freaking out and I called my boyfriend. My mom was away in Chicago for a business meeting and my dad’s phone was being fixed cause he dropped it. My boyfriend, let’s call him Mike, said he would be there in just a few minutes cause he lived close. I waited in my car in absolute silence and every noise made me jump. 

There was a scratching on the window of my car and I turned around expecting a pine branch but I saw the white clothed face of the man. I started screaming at the top of my lungs and trying to start my car frantically. Mike pulled into the parking lot and I looked back and the white man wasn’t there. I jumped out of my car and ran as fast as I could to Mikes truck and jumped in fast, yelling at him to drive. He pulled out of the driveway and before he drove away I saw the white man standing in the tree line. We flew down the road to the police station and filed a report. 

The next day they went out there and found the battery to my car, a knife, and a note on the stump I was sitting on. They still don’t know who it was who was in the woods with me but the note was absolutely terrifying. The note had a smeared lipstick of my favorite brand and said above it, “Je veux que tu sois le noir de mon blanc.” The note was written in my first language and I began to realize that I was being stalked. They never found the man and I haven’t encountered the man since. I’m still recovering from the encounter.
