I have received plenty of weird calls during my days since buying this new phone, I’ve always just had a flip phone with nothing much going on my life and I have definitely had less robo calls. I was visiting my cousin down in California on a Sunday afternoon and that’s when I got the first call that I’m sure is leading to my death.

“Hello this is Amery.” I said calmly, I had nothing to worry about, not a care in the world. I was going on vacation, why would I worry? A small horse laugh came at the other end of the line, “Hello?”

“Two weeks Amery.” Whoever it was laughed harder and hung up immediately, my heart slightly raced just a little. Wouldn’t you be scared getting a call like that? I shouldn’t have answered but I quickly learned the next day that ignoring them was not an option. I received a voicemail at around the same time I got the first call.

“Amerryyyy,” He had a very croaked voice, and he sounded breathless in the message, “Amerrryyy tsk, tsk, tsk. Not answering me will get you nooooowwheeeere.” He was taunting me, singing some of the words, “13 days Ameeerryyyy.” And then the messaged ended. I began to panic a little, this creep won’t stop calling me and I have a feeling it won’t end. I stormed up to my cousin Daisy shoving my phone in her hand.

“Is this some sick joke Daisy? I don’t find it funny at all.” She looked at me startled and confused, and when she heard the voice message, her face twisted into a deep confusion, the kind where someone would wake up not knowing where they were at.

“Amery I don’t know who that is, it doesn’t sound like anyone we know. Have you given your phone out to any strangers at all?” I crossed my arms, I’m sure my face was almost red with anger.

“Why would I ever give my number out to strangers?! That is the last thing anyone would ever catch me doing!” I snatched my phone from her and stormed back to the room I was staying in, I was starting to freak out a little more. I ended up calling my provider and changing my number. I reached out to all my family members and skipped out on giving my new number to my friends in case it had been one of them, I even avoided giving Daisy my number. But the next day, I got a call from an unknown number, and my heart sank. Did this creep already find my number? What am I to do if it is him? I answered the phone but I didn’t say anything, and there his all too familiar voice cackled.

“Ameerrryyy,” He said in that singing like tone, “Ameerryyy, you can’t get rid of me that easily.” He wheezed out a disgusting laugh.

“What do you want from me?! I don’t know who you are! Why won’t you leave me alone?!” I yelled at the top of my lungs, “I can’t take this! I will call the cops!” He wheezed out another laugh.

“You can’t hide from me, they can’t find me, cry all you like, 12 days Amerrryyyy.” He laughed another hard laugh and hung up. My body felt completely numb. Was I going to die? Is this what it was? Was some murderous asshole who has been messing with me just counting up my days? What if I just tell the police and then give them my phone? Is this something I have to pass on to someone else? I hurriedly put on my shoes and headed out to the nearest police station and told the police everything.

“Take my phone please, you’ll see when he calls! I won’t need my phone I promise.” I cried, the officers looked at each other confused but took my phone, I had given them Daisy’s personal phone and house phone number to contact me when they wanted to update me. I left the station with a weight off my chest. I walked home, I still felt uneasy about the recent events but I was sure I was safe this time. When I had gotten home Daisy was on the couch, watching TV. I walked up to her.

“Hey Amery, how was your day?” she asked while flipping through the channels.

“I’m sorry, Daisy.” I began to cry and hugged her, she immediately held me in her arms, “I’m so sorry, I was scared and I didn’t mean to lash out on you like that yesterday. I went to the police and I gave them my phone in case that guy calls again. Daisy, he told me 12 days. What’s going to happen in 12 days? What if I die?”

“No Amery, calm down, maybe it’s a prank call.”

“It’s not, I changed my number and he called me again!” Her eyes grew wide as she looked at me with disbelief, “It’s true! I gave the station your phone number and your housephone number in case they were ready to update me.” Daisy cradled me in her arms, assuring me that I would be safe. Later that night I had a nightmare. I was being chase by a strange man, he was in a cloak, the streets were empty and when I tried to hide, the shadows engulfed me and I was drowning. I woke sweating the next morning, and my sheets where tossed everywhere. I sighed, collapsing back on my bed.

My cousin walked into the room with her phone against her ear.

“Yes, she’s right here, she’s up!” She looked at me and got closer to hand me the phone, “Alright I will let her know, it’s one of your friends?” I grabbed the phone in my hand and stopped myself before I could answer.

“I never gave any of my friends your number, Daisy.” I whispered, my heart stopped and Daisy went pale. I stare at the phone, and watched the numbers go up on the minutes, and put the phone on speaker. And there is was, that wheezed laugh, and the grossly croaked voice of the man that had been harassing me.

“Ameeerrryyyyy,” In that disgusting tone of voice he sang my name again, “You’re very funny, I like this game with you a lot.” He laughed again, “You thought I wouldn’t know? Haha! You didn’t think I’d have a plan to contact you? Ha! Amerrryyyy, tsk, tsk, tsk.” He laughed harder.

“what do you want from her?! She hasn’t done anything!”

“Oh Daisy, Daisy, Daisy, Daisy. Sweet, sweet, Daisy. Ha! That’s a beautiful white sundress.” I quickly looked at her clothes, to confirm that she really was wearing a white sundress, and she was, “Ha ha ha! 11 Days Amerrrryyyyy.” I hung up and quickly called the cops. Within a few minutes they were at the house and searching all over, but found no one. They recommended that phone numbers would be changed, and that we call them again if it occurred, but there wasn’t much that they could do. They also offered to keep watch in the neighborhood for a few days to see if they spot anyone suspicious. We thanked the officers as they left and began to plan the best we could. We texted family and mentioned something came up and that phones will be off, and we disconnected all the house phones and shut Daisy’s phone off. We thought that would help or at least be the end of it, but he left notes on Daisy’s door, and packages full of papers that would have the number of days left. Our relationship began to strain and we were arguing almost every few days. We were on 3 days left, harassed by many notes, and papers and packages. We begged the police to keep watch on the house and on us and we even asked if by the last day we could stay in a holding cell down at the station. Our house was put on watch and the next day was another package with hundreds of paper in it that said 2 days Amery.

We showed the officers, but they claimed they had watched all night and no one was there. We weren’t sure what else to do, and my heart was racing with fear.

“I can’t do this anymore Daisy! I don’t know what’s going to happen to me!” I cried so hard I could barely breathe, “I can’t Daisy, I can’t!”

“Listen to me Amery, I will do anything to protect you. Nothing is going to happen to you and I will make sure of it.” She grabbed my face to look at hers and hugged me tightly. I didn’t want to die, but was this the end for me? We stayed home all day, a note on the door that said 1 day Amery. We stayed in the house since the police wouldn’t put us in the holding cell and we sat in the living room with the tv off, holding each other. The phones off and disconnected, a knock came at the door, when we opened it there was a package, but this one was much smaller, inside was a phone and then it rang. We looked at each other before we picked it up and put it on speaker, and there came the cackling laugh and the croaked voice.

“Boo.” Was all he said, he hung up and we dropped the phone, an oozing black liquid began to droop out of the phone and came out as a flood. Hands formed out of the phone, whatever it was, it was pulling itself out. Daisy and I screamed at the top of our lungs as it grew taller and taller and it laughed that familiar cackled laugh, “Amerrrryyyyy, I’m heerrreee.” It’s voice slow became deeper, in a demonic like tone, I watched as it stepped out of the phone in it’s human like form, slowly reaching for me, engulfing my face with the black liquid. I was drowning as it laughed.

“Wait! Take me, Leave her and take me!” Daisy panicked, pulling at whatever she could to make it stop, “Please!” It slowly retracted all of it’s gross like slime out of me.

“You’ll take her place?” It wheezed, and it laughed, “You will replace her?”

She looked at me, I was collapsed on the floor, coughing and struggling to breathe, my throat was in too much pain to tell her no.

“Yes, I’ll take her place.” It wheezed out that disgusting laugh and immediately consumed her, giving her no chance to scream and dragging her in to the phone with it’s black liquid. I crawled, picking up the phone and trying to turn it on, but it wouldn’t. A few minutes later the phone rang and when I answered it, all I could hear was the cackling laughter of the demon and the screams of Daisy crying for help.
