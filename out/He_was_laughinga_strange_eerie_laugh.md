In the shadows, he wore a black hooded sweatshirt, his back turned to me. I drove past him, but I knew it was dangerous because he was only a corner away from my neighborhood, and I was speeding toward that very corner.

I considered our neighborhood relatively safe, with a large electric iron gate that wouldn't open unless you pressed a specific remote control or called a resident inside. It was already past two in the morning. Afraid he might follow me, I frantically pressed the remote to open the gate. Glancing into the rearview mirror, I saw nothing but darkness. I sighed softly, thinking, "Maybe he's just passing by late at night." With that thought, I skillfully parked my car in my designated spot.

Our neighborhood had a private parking lot, and each household had its own designated space. Parked next to me was a pickup truck, and as I smoothly backed into my spot, I found myself tightly enclosed on both sides. After getting out of the car, I inadvertently glanced toward the gate and saw a sight that remains etched in my memory.

He tilted his head, and from beneath the hood's shadow emerged a bizarre, stiff smile. One hand gripped the iron gate's bars, his eyes hollow and vacant. The other hand waved mechanically at me. Under the dim streetlight, that's all I could see. The distance was too great to tell if he was saying anything, but I kept hearing some rustling sounds.

I didn't dare linger another second and dashed toward my home. Just as I closed the car door, an indescribable unease crawled up my spine. The figure had vanished, but I could hear footsteps echoing in the empty parking lot, each step amplifying the reverberation. I tried to reassure myself that it was just my imagination, but his eerie smile kept replaying in my mind.

I pulled the keys from my pocket, gripping them so tightly that my palms grew sweaty. The sound of locking the car seemed piercingly loud in the silence, as if awakening some slumbering presence. As I reached the building's entrance, I couldn't help but look back once more, only to find the shadows by the gate empty. It was as if he had never existed—perhaps just a hallucination from my fatigue after a long drive.

Yet those faint, rustling sounds still lingered in my ears, sometimes distant, sometimes near, blurring the line between reality and illusion. Shaking my head, I silently scolded myself for being cowardly, but subconsciously quickened my pace, almost running toward my apartment door. Fumbling with my keys, my hands trembled as I inserted them into the lock.

When the door clicked open, I finally exhaled, quickly shutting and locking it behind me. As usual, I turned on the living room lights. But as the room flooded with light, I noticed that the shadows outside the window seemed deeper than usual, as if that smile was still watching me.

Yes, I saw him! He was staring at me through the closed blinds. In the faint moonlight, I could see his eerie pupils and that unsettling smile. He stood outside on the balcony, fixated on me. I didn't dare look in that direction again and hurriedly dialed the police.

Fumbling with my phone, my fingers trembled as I dialed the emergency number. The ringing tone seemed unbearably loud, each beep stretching endlessly. I stared intently at the screen, afraid to look toward the balcony.

"Hello, this is the emergency center. How may I assist you?" The moment the call connected, I mustered all my strength to whisper, "Someone... someone's following me. He's outside on my balcony, watching me."

My voice was shaky with tension, but the operator sensed the urgency. "Please remain calm. Are you at home right now? Are your balcony doors and windows locked?" Her tone was steady, but it couldn't quell my inner fear.

"They're locked, but I'm scared..." I took a deep breath, trying to suppress my trembling. "He's right outside. I can see his shadow through the curtains."

"Alright, we've dispatched officers. They'll arrive within five minutes. Please stay in a safe place, avoid approaching the balcony, and do not attempt to confront him."

After hanging up, I forced myself to stay calm, holding my breath as I cautiously moved to hide behind the sofa. The curtains fluttered gently in the breeze, and my eyes couldn't help but dart toward that shadow. It moved.

He made no sound but pressed closer to the window like a ghost. I could even feel those hollow eyes staring straight through the curtains at me. Then, he raised his hand and slowly knocked on the glass.

Thump—thump—thump.

The sound was deep and slow, each knock echoing in my heart. I covered my mouth, not daring to make a sound. Just then, the sound of sirens came from outside, and I closed my eyes in relief, a surge of joy washing over me.

However, when I opened my eyes again, the shadow had disappeared. Outside the curtains was a tranquil night, as if nothing had happened.

"The police are here," I told myself, running toward the door. Several officers stood outside, and their presence gave me a sense of security.

"Sir, are you the one who called?" one officer asked.

"Yes, he was just outside my balcony," I said urgently, my voice still shaking.

"Please calm down. We've checked around the building and haven't found anyone suspicious. But to be safe, we'll conduct a thorough search inside," another officer reassured me.

They inspected every corner of my home, especially the windows and balcony. I followed them, feeling both nervous and hopeful.

"There are some strange markings here," one officer pointed to the dirt outside the window.

I leaned in to look, discovering several clear footprints in the soil beneath the windowsill, as if freshly made. There were also some smudged handprints on the glass, the fingerprints distinct.

"It appears someone was indeed here," the officer frowned. "But how did he leave without a trace? Our team was outside the entire time and didn't spot anyone."

Just then, a faint sound came from the hallway, like someone stepping on a loose floorboard. The officers immediately became alert. One whispered, "He might still be in the building. Stay sharp, everyone."

They instructed me to stay put while they spread out to search the hallways and emergency exits. Standing at my door, my heart pounded, and all I could hear was my own breathing.

Seconds ticked by, the officers communicating in hushed tones as they moved.

Suddenly, the hallway lights flickered and then went out, plunging the entire building into darkness.

"What's going on?" an officer's voice echoed in the dark.

Immediately after, hurried footsteps reverberated in the stairwell, mixed with low, eerie laughter seeming to emanate from all directions.

"He's moving!" The officers quickened their pace, chasing the sounds.

I stood at my doorway, palms sweaty and unsure whether to lock myself inside or wait where I was.

The officers moved through the darkness, while I remained rooted to the spot, utterly lost.

After a few minutes, the power returned, and the hallway lights flickered back on. The officers regrouped but all shook their heads.

"We couldn't find him. He may have already left," one officer said, a hint of frustration in his voice.

"Rest assured, we'll increase patrols in the area to ensure your safety," another officer comforted me.

After they left, I closed and locked my door, double-checking all the windows and locks once more. Even though they said he might have gone, the unease within me didn't subside.

Exhausted, I walked into my bedroom, deciding to rest early. However, soon after lying down, an inexplicable pressure made it impossible to sleep.

"Maybe it's just my imagination," I told myself, trying to calm down. The room was eerily quiet; I could only hear my own heartbeat. Suddenly, a faint rustling came from under the bed, like fabric dragging across the floor. My breath caught, eyes wide as I stared at the ceiling, not daring to move.

Squeak—squeak—

Could it be a rat? I tried to rationalize, but the fear within me kept growing.

A few seconds later, the sound came again, clearer this time, accompanied by faint breathing.

A chill ran from my spine to the top of my head, but that oppressive feeling remained. Carefully, I sat up, heart pounding, palms sweaty.

I didn't want him to realize I'd noticed something was wrong. Gently, I slipped off the bed from the opposite side, my mind blank, completely consumed by fear. I wanted to scream but couldn't make a sound. Slowly, I backed toward the bedroom door. Suddenly, a low chuckle came from under the bed.

"Heh—heh—"

"Sir, are you alright? We have new information!" The police knocked on the door unexpectedly.

As my eyes adjusted to the darkness, I glimpsed a pair of eyes glinting strangely from beneath the bed.

"Shh—" a raspy voice whispered in my ear. It was the last time I heard him.

I yanked open the door, only to find no one outside. The corridor was silent. I could have sworn I heard the police just moments ago.

Looking down at my phone, the screen was black and unresponsive.

Lifting my head, I saw that familiar figure standing at the end of the hallway. He slowly turned around, revealing that eerie smile.

"You can't escape," his voice echoed down the empty corridor.

I turned to re-enter my apartment, only to find the door had vanished, replaced by a cold, solid wall.

I was trapped, with no way out.
