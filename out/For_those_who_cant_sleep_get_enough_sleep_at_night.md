This post is for those of you who, like me, simply can't “just go to sleep” but end up lying in bed wide awake for hours not knowing why. For the most part, my lack of sleep was due to my insomnia and stress but many times throughout the years I couldn't sleep for unexplained reasons. I have tried every method, ingredient, exercise and practice to help me get some sleep so I wanted to share some of the ones that worked best for me for people who are in a similar position to how I was. 

My mind would race with thoughts about work, exams and other things, and I found it difficult to unwind and relax until I discovered these methods. 

**Real Meditation:**

One day, a friend suggested that i try meditation to help me relax and quiet my mind before bed. At first i was very sceptical. And after putting it off for weeks I eventually tried it. I had never meditated before, and I wasn't sure how it could help me with my sleep issues. But I decided to give it a try. I started meditating a few minutes before bed each night. At first, it was difficult to focus and my mind would wander, but I persisted and after a few weeks of meditating regularly, I began noticing a big difference in my sleep. I was falling asleep faster and sleeping more soundly throughout the night. I also felt more rested and refreshed in the morning. As i continued to meditate, I found that it not only helped me with my sleep but also with my overall mental health and wellbeing. I felt more relaxed and centered throughout the day, and I was better able to handle stress and anxiety. 

**SoundSnooze Sleep Mask.** 

This was one I stumbled across on Instagram when I began meditating, it looked like a really good idea and had a decent amount of positive reviews, I was a little concerned at first but ordered it anyway just to test it out and I haven't stopped using it since it arrived, i really have to give credit to this sleep mask for helping me get my sleeping pattern sorted because it really helped me improve my meditation and pretty much blocked out all the thoughts racing through my head before bed, I personally liked to play ambient and nature sounds before going to sleep which helps me alot, I even buy these as present for friends and family. Would really recommend this for those who have tried all other methods to sleep and nothing seems to be working. Really a worthwhile purchase, can get it at [https://soundsnooze.com/](https://soundsnooze.com/) 

**Healthy Diet:**

I also decided to take a closer look at my diet and heard that certain foods can have an impact on sleep quality, and I realized that eating habits were not as healthy as they could be. I made a commitment to eating a mor balanced diet, with plenty of fruits, veg and whole grains and it made a massive difference, however, I will not go into major detail as many people know that this is a given, eat healthy for a healthy amount of sleep. Cant stress this enough.
