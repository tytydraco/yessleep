I remember the first time I played Majora's Mask on the N64. I was thirteen, living in my parents' suburban home with its creaky floorboards and that one hallway that was always too dark, no matter how many lamps Mom put there. It was the kind of house that made silence feel like it had weight.

Dad had bought me the game for my birthday after months of begging. I'd tear through my homework just to squeeze in an hour before dinner.

The game unsettled me from the start—not just because of the moon's malevolent grin or the relentless ticking clock that counted down to doomsday. It was something deeper. The game felt *wrong* in a way my thirteen-year-old brain couldn't articulate. Like finding an old home video and realizing, for the first time, that the person holding the camera is dead.

Despite all that, there was one strange comfort: at least Dead Hand wasn't in Majora's Mask. That pale, twisted creature from Ocarina of Time with its bloodstained face and those horrible arms emerging from the ground—it had terrified me so deeply that I'd turned off the game the moment I encountered it in the Bottom of the Well. I never finished Ocarina. Never wanted to see the 3DS remake either. Just seeing screenshots of that thing online would bring back the nightmares.

But Majora's Mask, for all its eeriness, at least felt like safer territory. No Dead Hand. Just a relentless timer and a sense of impending doom.

My friends never got it. "It's just a Zelda game," they'd say with eye rolls. But they hadn't felt the way the game seemed to breathe when you weren't looking. The way it seemed to be waiting.

Years passed. I went to college, got a job at a marketing firm, and developed insomnia that settled into my bones like a permanent houseguest. When Nintendo announced the 3DS remake, I pre-ordered it immediately, desperate to reconnect with the strange dread that had colored my childhood.

But it wasn't the same. Something felt different. Not just the enhanced graphics or the tweaked boss fights. There was a sterility to it, as if Nintendo had taken sandpaper to the original's jagged edges. The darkness had been sanitized, made palatable. I completed it during a weekend alone in my apartment, enjoyed it well enough, and moved on.

Then came the breakup. Sarah and I had been together for three years. We'd talked about rings, about houses, about names for children we'd never have. When she left, taking half our friends and leaving me with an apartment full of furniture that suddenly belonged to strangers, I found myself diving into nostalgia headfirst.

I wasn't using a cartridge this time. I had downloaded an emulator during a particularly dark 3 AM, telling myself it was nostalgia, that I wanted to relive the experience. But if I'm honest—and isn't honesty the point when you're recording something no one else will ever see?—that's not why I started digging.

I had stumbled across a forum thread about the **test maps** in *Majora's Mask 3D*—unused development spaces hidden in the code. In the original N64 version, the test rooms for Stone Tower Temple were just unfinished areas with placeholder textures. Nothing remarkable. But in the 3DS remake, they were **different**.

The layout was identical to the actual dungeon rooms, but stripped of textures. Just a featureless **grey** void.

No enemies. No music. No ambient sound. Just silent, empty space.

I had to see them for myself. It wasn't curiosity—it was compulsion.

# THE DESCENT

Emulators allow you to access debug menus and warp to hidden areas that ordinary players would never see. It took me three nights of tinkering—three nights of instant ramen and energy drinks, of calling in "sick" to work and ignoring texts—before I found myself standing in one of the Grey Rooms.

At first, I thought I'd made a mistake—like I'd loaded an unfinished prototype or corrupted my ROM. The world around me was **flat**. Smooth, grey walls stretched endlessly in all directions, like being trapped inside a blank sheet of paper. The minimap still worked in the corner of my screen, showing doors and pathways that should have been there, but without textures, everything blurred together into a suffocating uniformity. No landmarks. No reference points. Just grey.

I pressed the button to summon Tatl, Link's fairy companion. Her glow flickered faintly, barely lighting the space around me. It should have been reassuring to see something familiar, a splash of color in this monochrome prison, but it only made the situation worse.

Because the walls weren't **smooth**.

Up close, they had texture—something shifted beneath the surface, like patterns you see when you press your palms against your closed eyelids. It wasn't an animation. More like **movement**, slow and writhing, as if something was struggling to break through from another dimension. As if the wall itself was breathing.

"It's just a graphical bug," I whispered to my empty apartment. "Just a rendering issue."

Still, nothing happened. No enemies spawned. No puzzles presented themselves. Just me and Link, standing in an impossible space.

I was about to quit, to chalk it up as another internet myth, when something caught my eye. A glint of something that didn't belong.

A green rupee, sitting in the corner where two grey walls met.

It shouldn't have been there. These test rooms weren't supposed to have any items or collectibles. Just empty space for developers to test mechanics.

I guided Link over to it. When he touched it, the rupee disappeared with the familiar chime, the count increasing by one. Normal. Expected. But what wasn't expected was what appeared behind where the rupee had been.

A small indent in the wall. Barely noticeable unless you were looking for it.

I positioned Link against it and pressed forward. He didn't move. But when I approached it from an angle, something strange happened. The camera clipped through the wall for a split second, revealing... another grey space beyond. A hidden area.

That's when my obsession truly began.

For the next seventy-two hours, I barely ate or slept. I called in sick to work three days in a row, ignoring my boss's increasingly concerned voicemails. I scoured every inch of those Grey Rooms, pressing against walls, looking for collision detection failures, trying to clip through boundaries that shouldn't have existed.

On the third night, I found it—an arrow quiver sitting impossibly in the middle of a featureless room. When Link collected it, the floor beneath it seemed to ripple, like the surface of water. I directed him to that spot and made him play the Song of Soaring.

The screen went black.

When it faded back in, Link was in a new Grey Room. But this one had something the others didn't.

It had a door.

# THE SOUND

It started with a noise. Something faint, just on the edge of hearing.

A slow, dragging sound.

The longer I stayed in the Grey Rooms, the more I felt an overwhelm**ing presence**. Not like being watched—like being *absorbed*. A certainty that I wasn't alone, that something was pressing against the membrane separating their reality from mine.

Then, I heard it.

A **wet, slithering noise**. Like someone dragging a soaked carpet across concrete.

I stopped moving Link.

Listened.

Nothing.

I took another step.

**Thick. Dragging.**

My breath caught in my throat. My heart hammered against my ribs. I recognized that sound from countless nightmares.

**Wallmaster.**

The entity that lurks above you in *Majora's Mask*, waiting to drop and pull you back to the start of the dungeon. Those giant, disembodied hands that would fall from the ceiling without warning, grabbing Link and dragging him away.

But there were **no enemies** in the Grey Rooms. The developers had left them empty. That was the whole point.

I tilted the camera **up**, my finger trembling on the control stick.

Nothing visible. Just more grey stretching to infinity.

And then, just as I was about to look away, it happened. A massive shadow fell over Link, and before I could react, the Wallmaster dropped. The screen went dark as it grabbed him, and in that fraction of a second before the screen faded completely, I swear I saw something else. Behind the Wallmaster—a silhouette. Thin, misshapen, with elongated arms and that blood-smeared face from the Bottom of the Well. Dead Hand.

But that was impossible. Dead Hand wasn't in Majora's Mask. It was from Ocarina of Time.

When the screen faded back in, Link was standing in the exact same spot. The Grey Room hadn't changed. Nothing had reset. But something had changed the rules.

I convinced myself it was a glitch—a leftover audio cue triggered by accident. Some remnant of code that shouldn't have been there.

Then I attempted to exit fullscreen, suddenly desperate to see my desktop, my email, anything from the real world.

The emulator **froze**.

For a full second, everything on my screen stuttered like a heart attack. Then the game **minimized itself**. I didn't touch anything. My hands were hovering above the keyboard.

I stared at my desktop—a photo of Sarah and me in better times—heart racing.

Then I heard the noise again.

**Not from the game.**

From my **computer**.

The first time, I barely registered it. Like a book sliding an inch off a shelf. When I looked around, everything in my apartment was exactly as I had left it.

Later, at work, I heard it again. Just the softest scrape, like a chair moving slightly. A sound so small that, by the time I processed it, it had already stopped.

It happened while I was brushing my teeth that night. The whisper of movement. The faintest suggestion of something shifting in the corner of my vision.

By the time I made the connection, it was too late.

# THE NOISE FOLLOWED ME

I shut the emulator down. Force-quit it from Task Manager. No unfamiliar processes were running. Nothing unusual at all. My CPU usage was normal. Memory consumption, normal. Everything looked fine.

But it wasn't fine.

I unplugged my headphones, thinking maybe they were shorting out.

The noise was **still there**—faint, distant. Like something **inside my computer was moving**. Shifting. Searching.

"Get it together, man," I muttered, running my hands through greasy hair. "You're sleep-deprived. You're still messed up about Sarah. This isn't real."

Days passed. I tried to ignore it. I went to work. I made myself shower. I even called my mom, pretending everything was fine when she asked if I'd been eating properly.

Then, while watching a YouTube video during my lunch break—some mindless countdown show about video game Easter eggs—I heard it again.

*Slithering.*

My coworker glanced over. "You okay? You look like you've seen a ghost."

I forced a smile. "Just remembered I forgot to send an email."

Back at home, I muted my speakers. The noise continued.

I powered down my PC completely.

It **did not stop immediately**.

It faded slowly, like something retreating reluctantly into darkness. Like something that didn't want to go.

I slept on the couch that night, as far from my computer as my one-bedroom apartment would allow.

# THE DEAD HAND

It started in the game first. After returning to the normal areas of Majora's Mask, things weren't right anymore. I was in Clock Town plaza, surrounded by NPCs going about their routines, when a townswoman reached up to adjust her hat. Her arm elongated unnaturally for a fraction of a second, skin bleaching white, joints bending at impossible angles. It resembled the arms from the Bottom of the Well in Ocarina of Time—Dead Hand's limbs, reaching up from the ground to paralyze you before the main body lurched forward with that blood-smeared face.

The glitch, if that's what it was, lasted maybe half a frame. So brief I convinced myself I'd imagined it.

Until it happened again. And again. A guard waving. A shopkeeper reaching for rupees. A Goron extending his arm for a handshake. Each time, just for a microsecond, their limbs would transform into something pale, wrong, and familiar.

Then it followed me out.

Two days after my marathon session in the Grey Rooms, I was sitting in a quarterly strategy meeting at Merrick & Davis Financial, trying to focus despite not having slept in nearly 72 hours. VP Jenkins was droning on about Q4 projections when Lauren from Accounting reached across the conference table for the water pitcher.

Her arm seemed to stretch, joints bending slightly backward, skin losing pigment for just a heartbeat. Then normal again. Just a tired coworker in a fluorescent-lit conference room.

No one else reacted. No one gasped or screamed. Just me, suddenly bolt upright in my chair, heart hammering.

"Richards? Thoughts on the Henderson account?" Jenkins asked, and fifteen pairs of eyes turned to look at me.

I mumbled something about needing to review the numbers and promised to follow up by email. Jenkins frowned—he hates when people aren't prepared—but moved on. Another black mark on my record, no doubt.

In the bathroom, I splashed cold water on my face and stared at my reflection. The irony wasn't lost on me—I have psoriasis, patches of dry, flaky skin that sometimes make people stare a second too long. Once, in my twenties, some asshole at the gym had called my arm "zombie skin." How would I feel if someone looked at me the way I'd just looked at Lauren?

It happened again at the office kitchen. Dan from IT reached for the coffee pot, and for a fraction of a second—so quick I would have missed it if I'd blinked—his arm wasn't right. Elongated. Pale. Wrong.

"You look like hell, man," he said, pouring coffee with a perfectly normal hand. "Big project?"

"Deadline stress," I mumbled, avoiding his eyes. If I started acting too weird at work, HR would notice. People already whispered about my divorce, about how I'd been "different" since Sarah left. One more incident and I could find myself on "stress leave"—corporate code for "we're easing you out."

And then what? My mortgage doesn't pay itself. The alimony doesn't stop because I'm seeing things.

"It's sleep deprivation with possible hypnagogic hallucinations," my doctor told me the next day during my lunch break. "Your brain is filling in gaps, pulling images from your subconscious." He prescribed sleeping pills that I never filled. I knew better than to close my eyes for too long.

"Have you been playing those video games again?" he asked as I was leaving. "The ones with the monsters?"

I froze at the door. "How did you—"

"Your ex-wife mentioned it during your couples counseling last year." He smiled reassuringly. "Said it was a source of tension—you escaping into childhood nostalgia instead of addressing adult problems. The mind often incorporates elements from our media consumption into our perceptions when we're exhausted or stressed."

As he reached for his prescription pad, his sleeve rode up. For a microsecond—so brief I almost convinced myself I imagined it—something was wrong with his wrist. The skin too white, too bloodless, the joint bending at a nauseating angle.

Then normal again. Just a concerned doctor with weathered hands.

# THE GREY ROOMS ARE WAITING

Later that night, I caught a glimpse of my own hand while washing dishes. The psoriasis patches seemed to spread before my eyes, whitening, elongating my fingers in the reflection of the soapy water. When I jerked my hand out, it was normal again. Just my familiar skin condition, nothing more.

I couldn't tell what was worse—the possibility that I was hallucinating away my career and financial stability, or the possibility that I wasn't.

I barely made it through the next day. My coworkers' hands kept... changing. Jensen pointing at the whiteboard. Maria passing me a folder. Even our CEO stopping by to "check in on the team," his handshake lingering a moment too long while his fingers seemed to stretch and pale against mine.

No one said anything. No one noticed. Just me, sweating through my dress shirt, wondering if I was losing my mind.

Last night, I woke up at 3:17 AM to find my bedroom door open.

A perfect rectangle of darkness.

I never opened it.

But in the darkness of the hallway beyond, I thought I saw something. Just for a moment. A pale white hand extending from the wall, joints wrong, fingers too long. Then nothing. Just shadows and mid-range furniture collecting dust from a life half-lived.

Then I noticed something else.

The wallpaper near my bedroom door.

At first, I thought it was just peeling slightly from the humidity. But as my eyes adjusted, I realized the texture was wrong.

It wasn't peeling.

It was shifting.

The surface moved, slow and writhing, just beneath the paper, like something struggling to push through. Like the walls in the Grey Rooms.

As I stood there, staring into the darkness of my hallway, I saw a shadow move against the wall. Not the shifting of tree branches outside my window, but something thin and misshapen, with elongated limbs that seemed to stretch impossibly before vanishing around the corner. A silhouette I recognized from childhood nightmares.

My boss's words from yesterday's performance review came back to me. He had reached for my personnel file, and for the briefest instant—if I'd blinked, I would have missed it—his hand had looked wrong.

"You know," he had said, sleeve sliding back to reveal perfectly normal skin once more, "sometimes we need to take a break when things get overwhelming. The company health plan covers mental health services."

He couldn't have known what I'd been experiencing. It was just corporate-approved language for "get your shit together or we'll have to let you go."

Yet as I lie here in bed typing this, I keep glancing at my own hands on the keyboard. The psoriasis patches seem to be spreading, growing paler, taking on that familiar texture from the game. From the Grey Rooms.

And sometimes, between keystrokes, my fingers seem to elongate just a bit. Stretch just a little too far.

No one would believe me. I barely believe myself. My 401k is vested. I have a mortgage. I can't just quit because I'm seeing things.

But I know what's happening.

The Grey Rooms are expanding. They're finding the spaces between reality—the cracks in the world where things don't quite fit together properly. And they're reaching through.

I'm going to leave this document here, in case someone finds it. In case someone else stumbles into those test maps and brings something back.

I've called in sick to work. Used up my last personal day. My boss sounded skeptical—arms probably normal as he held the phone, but I couldn't be sure. I can't be sure of anything anymore.

My bank account won't survive unemployment. My credit won't survive foreclosure. But my sanity won't survive going back to that office, watching hands stretch and pale and reach when no one else can see it.

I'm standing up now. Walking to my open bedroom door. That perfect rectangle of darkness.

And somewhere in that darkness, something is waiting. I can see its silhouette against the wall, thin and distorted, arms too long, body too still. Watching. Waiting. Patient.

It had already won.

My laptop's webcam light just flickered on.

I unplugged it months ago.

The Grey Rooms aren't confined to the game. They never were.

They're here. In my walls. In my apartment. In the spaces between what's real and what shouldn't be.

And now?

They're waiting.

For you... To find them.
