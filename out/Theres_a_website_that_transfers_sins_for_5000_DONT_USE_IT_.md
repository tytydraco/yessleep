I came across a website that promised to transfer your sin to someone else. Signing up was the biggest mistake of my life.

First of all, I want you all to know—I’m the bad guy in this story. You’ll soon understand why. We all have moments where our anger consumes us, makes us someone we never thought we could be. Sometimes that fury becomes so blinding that the line between right and wrong vanishes. But before you judge me, you need to hear the full story. You need to know what led me here. Then you can decide if I’m really the villain.

Jeff was my only friend. Not just for a year or two—we’d known each other since childhood. He lived next door, and that’s how it started. Our bond was strong, the kind that feels unbreakable. At least, it used to be. Everything changed in college. I met a girl, the kind of person you feel lucky to even know. It felt like someone up there had granted me exactly what I’d always wanted. She was perfect, or so I thought. Jeff, though—he hated her. Always talked trash about her for no clear reason. I chalked it up to jealousy. Maybe because his girlfriend had cheated on him, he assumed mine would too. But my girl wasn’t like his, or at least I believed that.

Then came the day she called to break up with me. Said she knew I was cheating. I was stunned—completely blindsided. She wouldn’t tell me who gave her that information at first, but after I confronted her in person, she confessed. Jeff. He had messaged her directly, with a doctored photo of me kissing another girl. Even though I pleaded with her, explained it was fake, she wouldn’t listen. That was the end of us.

Something inside me snapped. My anger was feral—untamed. It consumed me, hollowed me out. I didn’t want to ruin his life. I didn’t want to get even. I wanted to end him. The only option that made sense in that moment was to kill him.

That night, after midnight, I went to his place. He opened the door, unaware of what was coming. I didn’t say a word. I stabbed him—twenty times, maybe more. My hands moved on their own. The rage felt righteous. I thought I’d feel peace afterward. But when I got home, regret came crashing down on me like a tidal wave. I couldn’t breathe. I couldn’t think. I couldn’t eat. The guilt was unbearable. I had murdered my best friend. There was no undoing it. No fixing it. No second chances.

Desperate, trembling, I opened my laptop. I typed into the search bar with shaky hands: Is there a way to get rid of your sins? The very first result, blinking and flickering, caught my eye:

**"Sin Transfer – Your Sin is Our Win."**

I clicked on it immediately, as if something deep inside me already believed it might work. A chat window popped up right away.

*"Welcome to Sin Transfer. What's bothering you? Share with us, give it to us, maybe?"*

The next message appeared in bold:

**"Please note: We only accept sins from killers, mass murderers, human traffickers, and terrorists. For each sin, we charge $5,000. Discount packages available for multiple sins."**

I swallowed hard, my throat itchy and dry as I typed: I killed one friend. Brutally and willfully.

**"No worries, we're here to help."**

How does it work? I asked, still half expecting this to be a scam.

**"You give us the money, we take your sin. The holiest of holies, Mr. Sin Seer, does the job. He takes your burden, and voila—your conscience is clean."**

Who is Mr. Sin Seer? I typed.

**"Mr. Sin Seer is a pure soul. He has never committed a single sin. He lost his voice at a young age, but now he dedicates his life to helping others by taking on their sins. He bears the consequence, but only lightly."**

I didn’t hesitate. Alright, take the money. Take the deed. I transferred the $5,000 immediately.

**"Congratulations. Your sin has been successfully transferred to Mr. Sin Seer."**

And instantly, I felt it. A strange wave of relief. The regret vanished, like someone had vacuumed it out of my chest. It was euphoric—an unnatural calm. Like I had never done anything wrong. Like I was some holy monk untouched by guilt or pain. That’s when I truly believed in their service.

Hail Mr. Sin Seer, I typed.

**"You should!"**

Can I see him? I asked.

**"Do you really want to?"**

Yes. Please.

They sent me a photo. It was... blank. Just an old cracked wall with peeling paint. In the middle of it, a faint haze swayed gently. I rubbed my eyes. The haze disappeared.

Sorry, I don’t see anyone in the photo, I said.

**"Haha. Mr. Sin Seer is the holiest of holies. Sinners like you can’t see him. I told you—he’s pure, untouched by malice."**

But how can I believe this?

**"Don’t. Take your money and your nasty sin back if you want."**

But I couldn’t. That feeling—that lightness—it was too addictive. It proved to me that the transfer had worked.

Alright, I believe you. Send my regards to Mr. Sin Seer. But if he hasn’t sinned, why would he take on others’ sins?

**"Because unlike you, he wants to help people. He’s a messiah."**

Got it. Thanks.

That night, I slept better than I had in weeks. Even when I remembered stabbing Jeff, his face in my mind appeared peaceful, smiling even. As if he had wanted it. The memories were being rewritten by something—some mechanism of the transfer process. It was beyond amazing. A blessing. My heart felt free. My mind was quiet. Only one thing bothered me: my throat still itched. It burned sometimes, like it was melting from the inside.

And the sin transfer? It was cool. But not for long.

Three days later, I got a call from an unknown number. I answered with a simple “Hello”—or at least I tried to. No sound came out. I tried again. Louder. Still nothing. My voice was gone. Completely.

Then a woman spoke on the other end.

**"Your deed is yours indeed. Don’t you know that transferring your sin to someone else is an even greater sin?"**

Her voice was cold, sharp.

**"Nonetheless, Mr. Sin Seer sends his warm regards. He can speak now. Wanna hear him?"** She paused.

**"Oh wait—you wanted to see him, right? Check your WhatsApp."**

I opened it immediately. Another photo. Same wall. Same cracks. But this time, something moved. From the edge of the frame, he stepped into view. Mr. Sin Seer. Towering, too tall to be human. He wore a black hat pulled low over his face. I couldn’t see his eyes—just his grin. Wide, stretched unnaturally. That grin alone made my skin crawl. Then he started to laugh. A deep, bone-rattling laugh. Louder. And louder. The screen shook. Then the message disappeared. The chat erased itself.

A day later, I got another call.

**"You have a sin to take. Are you ready, dear Mr. Sin Seer?"**

They made me their next Sin Seer.

And I’m not willing to take anyone’s sins. Even if it means staying voiceless forever.

But the regrets have come back too.
And this time, they’re twice as much. Twice as heavy.
But I can’t scream. I can’t even whisper.

Even in some of my old pictures, I'm gone missing now, replaced by a swaying haze.

All I can do now is wait...
For the next sinner, or should I?
