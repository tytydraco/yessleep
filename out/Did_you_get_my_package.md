I’ve been a police officer for three years, so I’m no rookie. My colleagues don’t see it that way. They’re all over forty, lifelong friends, and rarely treat me as an equal. I’ve overheard them mocking me behind my back more times than I can count.

For the past six months, an elderly woman had been visiting the station weekly, sometimes more than once a week, carrying home-baked donuts. The first time, she was kind, soft-spoken, easy to talk to. Everyone else was suspicious, and rightly so. We checked the donuts meticulously but found no signs of contamination, everything fine. There were enough for most of the officers to enjoy. I didn’t touch them. Gluten allergy.

Still, every time she walked through the door, the station lit up. Last week, she arrived as usual. Smiles, excitement, laughter. The donuts? Better than ever.

About an hour later, I was at my desk, Shelly at hers behind me. She had been complaining for minutes—chest pain, blurred vision. I noticed a few others were pale, their gray skin under the florescente lights, clutching their stomachs. Then I noticed Shelly’s breathing change—fast, ragged, desperate. I turned instinctively but it was too late.

She vomited violently over her keyboard and monitor before collapsing to the floor, retching until she passed out.

Chaos exploded. One officer called an ambulance. Others carried her into the break room. Officer Tom froze with a cloudy look in his eyes, and a terrified look on his face beneath layers of sweat. Clutching his stomach he managed to mutter the frase “something’s not right”. Then he fell to his knees, vomiting. One by one—George, Mike, Sully, Justin, Eve, Todd— they all succumbed. More ambulances had to be called.

A few days later, autopsies confirmed cyanide. My stomach dropped. The woman—the donuts—everything clicked. We spent the night hunting her, knocking on doors, stalking the streets like predators stalking their prey. No one had seen her. In a town this small, that’s impossible.

I got home exhausted, but sleep refused me. Guilt gnawed at me. My apartment felt wrong, it wasn’t cold and lonely like usual, I knew I wasn’t the only one to step foot in their that night. I paced the living room, trying to distract the feeling that I wasn’t alone. Thats when I saw it, I had been feeling the bitter breeze this whole time, hearing the curtains flap against the wall but somehow failing to see what would make my blood run colder than the wind hitting me. The window was wide open. I never leave windows open. My gut twisted. I closed it, searched every room. Nothing. Relief washed over me, brief and hollow.

Then I entered my bedroom. That same feeling crept up again, my heart froze, my blood ran cold and the back of my neck boiling hot. On my bed—a box. Frantically taped.

I patted my pockets frantically before grabbing my switchblade, I hesitated. What if it was a bomb? Honestly that was the least of my worries and I knew it. I could feel it. The tape cut under my trembling hands. Inside: a prosthetic mask. Movie-quality. A face stood out—the elderly woman. Someone had spent six months gaining the officers’ trust, learning their routine, just to kill them. They had been playing with their food. 

I spent the night at the station, guarding the evidence. I couldn’t bring myself to spend another second in that apartment. Six weeks passed. Nothing.

Yesterday, a man was brought in. He had chased an elderly woman with a knife. I was assigned to interrogate him. The door slammed behind me and the rooms stench hit first—gasoline, urine, burnt flesh. My stomach churned. He sat silently, head bowed, burned beyond recognition. No fingerprints, no teeth, no face. A ghost.

I stepped inside, heart hammering. The door slammed behind me. The stench clung to my clothes. His head lifted slowly. Skin reduced to leathery, charred patches, hair in greasy, stringy chunks scattered across his scalp. Purple turtleneck ripped, bloodstained, burnt. His toothless grin stretched across his face.

A soft, windy voice whispered:

“Did you get my package?”
