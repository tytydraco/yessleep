They’ll disappear you.

And for breaking this rule, I’ll soon find out where their victims go. I won’t be able to outrun them.

After all, they’re not really ‘men’ at all.

A buttonhook is a handheld aid with a curved hook at one end and a handle at the other; it fastens and unfastens unyielding buttons. That’s all. It’s not an exciting invention. Not even a particularly well-known one. Certainly not sinister in the slightest.

But, you know, even the most mundane of tools can do far-from-mundane things in wilful hands.

For context, I learnt about the immigration officers of Ellis Island in history class. Men who used buttonhooks to intrusively inspect prospective American citizens for trachoma; a contagious eye disease that resulted in blindness when left untreated. Eyelids were peeled back like fruit skin. A ghastly procedure.

These immigration officers became known as the buttonhook men, and they were feared by those being processed on the island. That’s a horror story in itself, but not the one I’m here to tell.

No, this is the story of the unearthly creatures my friends and I came to call the Buttonhook Men, influenced by our recent history lesson. These creatures have been disappearing people in my hometown, which I’ll call Noplace, for 29 years.

Bear in mind that the original buttonhook men of Ellis Island were just that: men. And men die. It’s *ideas* that live. Stories. Monsters. Only, these aren’t the fictional kind. They’re real, no matter how much you might want them not to be; and if you think they won’t come for you, God save your soul.

Because this is bigger than my hometown. None of us will be safe for long.

First, they come for someone else.

Next, they come for *you*.

Noplace is a fourth-rate crap-heap and always has been, but our economy really nose-dived in the nineties. Of course, my friends and I were too young to understand why. We didn’t know or care about austerity. About powerful men who bled the working class, the middle class, and even some of the upper class.

It’s a confusing thing, the way the world works. That’s why most of us simply choose not to study the mechanisms. We only really give a hoot when life becomes expensive. Hard. And isn’t it the darnedest thing that those responsible always make sure we point our fingers at each other?

That was what broke Noplace in 1998, when I was eleven years old.

And by the time the Buttonhook Men arrived, it was already too late.

Tom, Pari, Julianne, and I called ourselves the Fun Four back then. We looked out for one another. Pari, mostly. She was born in Noplace, but her mother, Samira, moved here from India in the late eighties; pregnant, recently widowed, and in catastrophic straits. She upheaved her life to survive. To ensure her soon-to-be-born girl would survive.

Pari had a good life, mostly. She caught a few racist remarks here and there, but the Fun Four looked out for her. The trouble started to brew in ‘95 with the unveiling of Noplace’s mega-mart. It quickly drove local shops out of business. And when the supermarket hired Samira, it was easy for Noplace citizens to blame her. The brown-skinned cashier.

Life became scary for them, but fear came for us all on December 20^(th) 1998.

That night, in Pari’s bedroom, the Fun Four watched films on a bulky box-television. It was a distraction sleepover. See, whilst we were upstairs, Pari’s mother was being interrogated by Constable Harrison in the kitchen. Noplace’s police constable was a nice-mannered man, but a weak one. Despite his pleasantries and platitudes, he had no backbone.

Case in point: Harrison was following up on a baseless accusation made by Mrs Bradshaw, whose husband’s bakery went under in ‘97. An accusation that Samira had used falsified information when applying for British citizenship nearly twelve years earlier.

That was a lie.

“What film next?” I asked.

Pari shrugged. “I don’t care, Joshua. Anything. Just…” The tears made their entrance. “They’re gonna make us move to India.”

Tom frowned. “But you’re not even *from* India.”

“Doesn’t matter. Mrs Bradshaw called us ‘foreign muck’, and everybody agrees.”

“Well, *I* don’t,” Julianne said. “And my brother told me Mrs Bradshaw got a Brazilian Butt Lift a few years earlier. Should we ask the policeman to send that ‘foreign muck’ back too?”

Tom and I chuckled, and Pari came close.

An hour later, once the constable had finished his interrogation and left, Samira came up to Pari’s room.

“Bedtime now,” she said, then she nodded at Tom and me. “You two will go in the spare room. Julianne, you’ll sleep in here with Pari.”

Tom got to his feet. “Yes, ma’am.”

“I’m special,” Julianne whispered to me, and I nudged her in the ribs.

Pari began, “Mum, what did—”

“Not now, beti,” her mother said, before nodding more sternly at me. “*Bedtime*, Joshua. It’s nine o’clock.”

“Sorry,” I said, getting to my own feet and joining Tom at the door; I turned back before shutting it, and smiled softly at Pari. “It’ll be okay, Paz.”

She said nothing. Instead, my friend sniffled, burrowed beneath her duvet, and flicked off the bedside lamp. Julianne remained on the carpet in that dimly moonlit room, and she spoke to me with a shrug; *I don’t know what to do to make all of this better*, it said. I returned with a nod because I didn’t know either.

A still-sobbing Samira closed her daughter’s door, then led Tom and I across the upstairs landing. As she opened the door to the spare room, I thought of something warm to say. Something that might dry her eyes. But before I had a chance, Pari’s mother let out a faint croak of horror and shot her arms sideways.

She was bracing Tom and me from something ahead.

Something in the blackness of her bedroom doorway at the end of the corridor.

It was black unlike any other black. I don’t know how else to put it, just as I don’t know whether I turned cold as the result of Samira’s sudden movement or as the result of being eyed by that doorway’s colourless cavity.

Whatever the case, I feared it more than anything else in the world.

“What’s wrong, ma’am?” was Tom’s timid question.

Samira stood still and answered with a shake of her head, but she did not twist to face us. I didn’t like that. And the longer we stood there, staring into that dark doorframe, the more assured I became that—

*Something is staring back at us*.

“Ma’am,” Tom pressed, tugging on Samira’s sleeve to get a response. “What’s in—”

“There’s nothing in the doorway, Thomas,” she said before he finished the question.

Then, as Samira started to shepherd us into the spare room, I glimpsed something.

A silver curl glinting from the black of the doorway.

I thought I’d imagined it, but as Pari’s mother closed the door on Tom and me, I heard him whisper—

“Buttonhook…”

I knew exactly what Tom was referencing. Ellis Island. The buttonhook men. But he had to be wrong, I decided. *It was a trick of the light*.

“It was a buttonhook man,” Tom said. “From the photos Mr Langton showed us.”

I shook my head. “No. Shut up. It wasn’t anything. It was—”

“Go to bed, boys,” Samira said from the other side of the door, “*and do not leave this room*.”

There followed creaks of floorboards as Pari’s mother crept along the hallway towards her bedroom. And then nothing. Not the sound of Samira shutting her bedroom door. Just nothing. No noise at all.

“What’s going on?” Tom said.

“Don’t…” I warned fruitlessly, knowing my friend too well.

But he had already pushed down the handle and opened the bedroom door. Tom was the smartest of the Fun Four, but *stupidly* brave. He had no survival instincts. I begrudgingly chased him onto the upstairs landing, and we stopped under the glow of the orange light overhead. We eyeballed the black of Samira’s bedroom.

On the carpet before that threshold were her fluffy white slippers.

And red droplets.

“W… What is that…?” I whimpered, knowing full well that it was blood.

“Something’s happened to her…” Tom said. “We need to do something… *We need to tell someone!*”

The moment he uttered that final word, there sounded a dissonant clink from Samira’s room. Tom looked at me, ready to ‘do something’ and ‘tell someone’, and I merely whimpered with great dread as I looked over his shoulder at the doorway.

The dark from within was spreading without.

It gushed out of the doorframe and towards us. A black stream through a ravine of white walls.

*There’s nothing in the doorway*, Samira had promised. Well, I’d known that was a lie. Known Tom was right.

We hadn’t imagined the glint of silver.

As the darkness engulfed us, nearly entirely extinguishing the light above, Tom turned on his heel. The two of us faced the black of the doorway.

*Faced the figure emerging from it.*

It wasn’t a man, much as the silver tip of his appendage wasn’t a buttonhook, or a hand, or anything remotely of our world. But I needed a frame of reference to stop my terrified mind from unravelling entirely, so I accepted Tom’s name: this was a buttonhook man, like the ones from Ellis Island.

The thing was cloaked in shade which sloshed from its black portal and nearly drowned the lightbulb entirely. I was glad of that. What I *could* see was already too much. This bipedal thing, with limbs tapering off into keen silver tips, each bearing a slight curve, may have had a face. A mouth. Eyes. But maybe not. I tried not to look too closely. Tried only to drag Tom back into the bedroom.

He resisted, of course.

“Where is she?” my friend asked.

The Buttonhook Man answered by wrapping bladed limbs like a noose around Tom’s neck and hoisting the boy into the air.

“Don’t kill me!” he wailed.

The creature obliged.

It uncoiled one of its silvery extremities from Tom’s throat, then surgically jabbed at his eyes. My friend screeched louder as the Buttonhook Man blinded him. And I screeched, selfishly, as I presumed myself to be next.

When the creature finished plucking out Tom’s eyes, I prayed a silent prayer for it to be over. For the inhuman thing to slink back into the shadows. But the Buttonhook Man put its silver appendage to work again, this time driving a hook up Tom’s nostril and having a rootle; fishing deeply up into my friend’s head.

What horrified me most was that Tom’s moans of terror quickly devolved. Became moans of confusion. Moans of vegetative nothingness. And then the Buttonhook Man removed its pointed limb to reveal what must have been grey matter from Tom’s skull.

My once wise, though admittedly foolhardy, friend had been rendered a lobotomised husk.

He presumably shuffled past me, down the stairs, and out of the door. But the terrible truth is that I don’t remember. I was in shock. Near catatonic. I don’t remember what became of him. I don’t know where he went. I know only that he’s not been seen since that day in 1998 because I wasn’t registering anything. I was thinking only—

*RUN. I HAVE TO RUN.*

Which the Buttonhook Man proved to be true as it slashed a silver limb-end my way.

The thing lacerated my forearm, drawing a gash from my wrist up to my elbow and an agonised yelp from my core. The scar stays with me to this day. The feeling of that cold appendage icing not only the flesh and the bone below, but my very heart. It felt, for a moment, as if I had been changed not only physically but emotionally.

As if I had become a husk of a person, blind to empathy.

Blind to any human thought or feeling.

Pulling back from the lurching creature, I gunned for Pari’s room, tore open her door, and slammed it behind me. As pounding came from the other side, I turned to find myself in another moonlit space bearing an unfolding scene of horror.

Pari was lying in bed, screaming up at the face of another Buttonhook Man towering above her. Silver e reaching towards her, speaking the unspoken threat of *disappearance*. Sending her wherever her mother had been sent.

Julianne was sitting on the carpet with arms around her legs. She rocked back and forth. Watched helplessly as Pari seemed poised to meet her end at the hooks of the creature from the black.

“It says my… my mum is… She’s…” Pari didn’t finish any of her sentences.

Julianne crawled over the floor towards me and tugged at my hand. “We need to… to go…”

I nodded and looked at the Buttonhook Man, whose attention had shot to Julianne and me: the two loose ends threatening to escape. With that, I understood this creature. Well, of course, I didn’t understand it. It was a horror from another world; one I wouldn’t possibly ever hope to understand. But I understood Tom’s fatal flaw.

He had threatened to tattle.

“Please just let us leave with her,” I begged the Buttonhook Man. “We won’t tell a soul what we saw. I promise.”

I don’t know whether it understood me. Don’t know whether it even spoke our language. But I do know that the ‘man’ observed me for a second. Recognised my cowardice. Recognised that I was telling the truth: in that moment, I *truly* intended to never tell a soul.

A promise I have only broken now, after nearly three decades.

The bedroom light burst to life, and the Buttonhook Men vanished with the dark.

But the Fun Four survived that night in body only.

Tom never showed up, no matter how hard the police searched. Pari ended up in a psychiatric ward, fractured by both the disappearance of her mother and what experts called ‘delusions’ of Buttonhook Men. My cousin, Wesley, still lives in Noplace. He says Julianne’s the town drunk these days. She works as a plumber, and a damn bad one.

As for me, I’ve lived overseas for twenty years, and I’ve teetered on being committed to psychiatric wards myself. Who would believe my story? Who would believe the supernatural things I saw that night? Well, people in Noplace, apparently. I’ve heard things over the years. Stories from Wesley. Disappearances of other citizens. Strange sightings in dark doorways. Unearthly things.

I didn’t used to care. Noplace was on the other side of the world from me.

But now it’s happening everywhere. People are going missing. That’s why I’m sharing my story here. You see, I’ve been seeing *them* again. In doorways. In the shade. Glints of silver. Outlines of things far from men. They’re not upholding the deal, so what’s the use in keeping hush anymore? What’s the use in keeping my promise?

The Buttonhook Men are coming for us all.

I realised that yesterday when my elderly neighbour, a sweet French lady named Susie, said familiar words over coffee.

“There’s nothing in the doorway.”

My heart seized in fear, much as it did back in ‘98, but not as sharply as it did this morning.

Susie has disappeared.

They’re not just in Noplace. Maybe they never were.

So, I’m currently about to board a flight back to my hometown. Back to see Wesley and make heads and tails of this horror.

Before it makes me disappear too.

Before I find out where those people went.

I don’t think I want to [know](https://www.reddit.com/r/dominiceagle).
