Thank you for all of your patience.

In the time since my last update, I’ve become a fidgety, paranoid mess, which has made parsing through the 600+ pages of stolen documents a challenging endeavor. I have mostly spent my days staying on the move, bumming public internet when I can, and trying to make a dent in these mining reports.

Based on published news, I don’t appear to be a murder suspect, which surprised me, given the thick layers of blood and viscera that I found caking my apartment when I returned from Maggie’s. I assumed I’d be the prime suspect in multiple homicides.

Guess you can’t be a suspect if you’re reported to be dead.

The article classified the events at my apartment as an open and shut murder-suicide, identifying Camila as the perpetrator and me as the victim.

Not sure who is orchestrating the cover-up, but it isn’t reassuring.

Still have Maggie’s phone, which I can’t open to the home screen without a passcode. A few calls from unlisted numbers have come in. None of them turned out to be Camila, unfortunately. Whoever was calling refused to say anything without first hearing Maggie’s voice, so they would eventually just hang up.

It’s not all bad news, thankfully. I’ve made a breakthrough.

At first, I was trying to review *all* of the stolen documents in chronologic order. That strategy did not bear fruit. There’s too much of it and I don’t even know what I’m looking for.

Last night, as I was drifting off to sleep, an epiphany hit me.

What was the purpose of the poem, *From Where Lucifer Landed, God Thread Sprouted*? Even if it references “God Thread”, which seems to be the crux of all of this, what was the point of including it?

As it would happen, the damn thing is a sort of map.

If you're interested, here is the[ full poem with the translation included.](https://imgur.com/a/7QJ8Ihu)

On my copy, some letters/punctuation marks are faintly underlined in blue or red ink.

For example, in the first stanza three letters are underlined. The “i” in radiante (radiant), the “i” in Filho (son), and the “f” in Filho. The “i”s are underlined in blue rink, and the “f” is underlined in red ink.

If you convert those letters to their representative numbers, i.e. their order in the alphabet, they become 699.

At first, I thought I was unearthing a phone number, but with three underlines per stanza, there were too many numbers. Then I thought it was a longitude and a latitude, but that didn’t explain why some of the numbers were underlined in red and some were underlined in blue. Always two blue underlines with one red underline.

But then I looked at the first mining log in chronologic order. Specifically, the date: June 1999, or 06/99. One red underline for the month, two blue underlines for the year. (As an aside, some of the later stanzas underline a period at the end of a sentence, rather than a letter. I’m taking that to mean “0”).

With five total stanzas in the poem, that left me with five dates, and narrowed my focus to only five of the total one hundred and ninety-eight mining logs. Perhaps these five documents contain whatever intel Camila wanted me to locate. Or maybe they form a sort of message, I'm not sure.

Might be wrong in the end about the underlines, but I think it’s worth a try.

Transcribing and uploading those five dates now. Any help in determining their meaning would be greatly appreciated.

***Dr. Danica*** **\[REDACTED\]*****, Lead Scientific Coordinator for Diosfibras III***

**Log 1:** June 1999.

***Contents:*** Description of Operation’s Intent, Summary of Previous Research, Personal Operational Logs

**Operation's Intent:** To locate, mine/capture, and analyze the “Living Alloy” as a means to determine the origin of its unique biochemical properties. Colloquial synonyms for the Living Alloy include “Prima Materia”, “Milk of the Virgin”, or “God Thread”.

***Investors:*** The Stella-Signata Mining Company ***(Shortened to SSMC for the rest of these operation notes)***

***Additional Operational Members:*** *Lead Operation Manager David* {REDACTED}, *Head Security Liaison Franklin* {REDACTED}, *Assistant Scientific Coordinator Afonso* {REDACTED}, *rotating crew members involved in manning and operating naval research vessels, rotating operational cohorts involved in maintaining employee safety and peace with the locals.*

***Summary of Prior Research:***

\-A sheet of the Living Alloy ***(Shortened to LAL for the rest of these operation notes)*** was first discovered incidentally by a foreman working for the SSMC. He happened upon the LAL washed ashore on a small island off the coast of Portugal in 1959. The SSMC had been mining copper deposits in the area. The sheet was approximately seven by seven feet long, irregularly shaped. A malfunctioning underwater core drill had pierced the LAL and was intermittently discharging electric shocks into its tissue. The drill bore the SSMC insignia; therefore, it was theorized that SSMC employees lost or discarded the damaged equipment, which eventually ended up piercing the LAL. As it would later be discovered, electricity can immobilize and deactivate the LAL for long periods of time, rendering it docile.

\-Thinking the LAL was some sort of rare, polymetallic sulfide, the foreman gathered the material into his truck and returned to the island’s base of operations, a warehouse erected on the edge of a fishing hamlet occupied by the island’s natives. Thankfully, the foreman didn’t remove the malfunctioning drill en route.

\-The sample was originally going to be analyzed on the island, however, a conflict with the local peoples removed that option. Once learning about the LAL’s presence in the warehouse, the townsfolk threatened violence against the employees of the SSMC unless they returned the LAL to the ocean. The mob was concerned that the LAL was a “Marrow Drinker”, a local creature of legend that was said to be responsible for hundreds of mysterious deaths during humanity’s occupation of the island, which started in the 1500s.

\-Not wanting to incite tensions, authorities informed the mob that the LAL would be returned to its original location. In reality, the sheet was air lifted to company HQ for further analysis.

***Molecular testing conducted on the LAL between 1959 and 1962 revealed the following:***

**Composition:** 60% elemental mercury, and 40% stem cells from several species of animals, including human stem cells. (which is where it got its name. An alloy is a combination of two separate metals. Examples include brass, which is copper and zinc, and bronze, which is copper and tin. However, the LAL was a combination of mercury and biologic stem cells, a union thought previously to be impossible. It’s essentially metal adorned and conjoined with an organic lifeform - a “living alloy”)

***Key distinctions when comparing the LAL to other, purely biologic organisms:***

**1) It’s appears to be immortal.** At the very least, it does not age like other biologic structures, as it does not age at all.

**2) It cannot reproduce.** Although it houses a collection of stem cells, those cells cannot grow into every type of tissue normally present in the animal that they hail from, reproductive tissue included.

**3) It seems to be a piece of a larger whole.** The LAL delivered to HQ in 1959 seems to be a small percentage of the speculated total organism located somewhere in the Atlantic Ocean. Researchers have nicknamed the larger, cumulative mass “The Progenitress”. Data suggests The Progenitress can shed fragments of itself that are capable of independent movement, yet these fragments lack individual status, nor do they represent a traditional, biologic birth. They are agents that share a consciousness with the Progenitress.

**4) Although its basic form looks like glowing mercury, the LAL can change its shape/carapace to masquerade as other biologic organisms**. The material carries a collection of dormant stem cells from different animals and can apparently manifest the adult form of any organism in the catalog at will. The exact mechanism for this transformation is unclear, but what is evident is that the LAL uses donated stem cells to accomplish the feat.

\-***Diosfibras I*** (1973-1977): Did not locate additional LAL. Violent conflict with the locals caused the operation to end.

\-***Diofibras II*** (1982-1991): Supposedly located additional LAL. However, almost a decade into the operation, the entire twenty-two-person crew went MIA. Locals may have killed company employees, but SSMC’s follow-up investigation found no evidence of further violent conflict. In late 1990, the company received the last communication from the operation’s Lead Scientific Coordinator. It was a picture that appears to show the discovery of additional LAL, [see below](https://imgur.com/a/ZEgHVqK). The picture contained no accompanying letter.

**Beginning of Personal Log:**

I arrived on the island this morning via a small plane. Despite my line of work, I have a limited tolerance for sea travel. Debilitating seasickness. Always feel like I’m seconds away from falling overboard.

Afonso, my new assistant, met me at the landing site. He’s a graduate physical chemistry student from the mainland. Hopes the discovery of more LAL can act as his phd dissertation. The boy is pleasant enough, if not a little over-eager for someone who’s not being paid to be here. Yapped the entire ride. I pulled out my notebook and began scribbling nonsense into it, praying that he would take the hint that I might need some peace to focus on whatever I was doing. Nope, his wordhole kept flowing.

Still, I like him. Reminds me what it was like to have passion. Between the jumble of brown curls peeking out from under his baseball cap and his slender “I have the metabolism of a twenty-year-old” physique, he isn’t a terrible strain on the eyes, either.

The drive through town on route to base camp was painful for Afonso. Locals glared icy daggers into us, knowing we were representatives of the SSMC. Thankfully, this ain’t my first semi-imperialist mining operation. I have thick skin, so said daggers bounced off my hide. The indignant onlookers would have had a better chance of pushing a toothpick through six inches of steel than they would have bothering me with their leers. But I don’t think the kid was ready for his own people to look at him with that type of deep-seated anger, silently lumping him in with the colonizers. Half-way through town, his yapping ceased completely, eyes glassy with tears. I felt bad for him, but someone should have briefed him on the history of this place. If *Diosfibras I* culminated in bloodshed, I would think it’s obvious that *Diosfibras III* wouldn’t be received too favorably by the locals.

Stepping out of the parked Jeep, the notebook I had been scrawling gibberish on earlier fell from my lap to the ground. I had forgotten it was even there. When I bent myself over to pick it up, I noticed a familiar symbol littering the page. Familiar only in the sense that I’ve seen it plenty before, no clue what it represents. No clue why my hand tends to draw it when I’m distracted, neither, but it’s something I’ve become indifferent to. My peculiar little nervous tic. It looks like the alchemical symbol for Mercury, but slightly different. Maybe just my mind ruminating on the possibility of discovering more LAL. [Included a copy below.](https://imgur.com/a/4n6b6st)

“Base camp” was the phrase my handler used to describe SSMC’s current establishment on the island, and my, what an extraordinarily generous phrase it was. Our new home away from home wasn’t much more than a massive, dilapidated warehouse surrounded by a few tents. Our “operational cohorts”, another euphemistic flourish employed by my handler, were actually a platoon of mercenaries. Grizzled, deathly looking men and women. Eyes vacant and glazed over, like they were still picturing the most recent atrocity they committed rather than actually observing what was in front of them. They, at the very least, appeared well armed, carrying large-bore rifles and smelling of gunpowder. Just hoped the SSMC kept them paid, so they didn’t turn those rifles on us innocents.

Surprisingly, the warehouse interior appeared appropriately furnished for research. Tidy, well-lit, with the requested experimental equipment present and in working order. It’s the little things, I suppose.

As we walked in, I presented Afonso to our lead operations manager, David, and our head security liaison, Franklin. Both men were right on the other side of the warehouse’s large metal doors, and I knew this before we entered. I had recognized the sounds of their voices before my hand even gripped the door handle, embroiled in conversation, the contents of which I couldn’t quite appreciate from outside the warehouse.

Whatever they were so damn energetic about, me and the kid’s arrival apparently killed the mood. As soon as we made ourselves known, the riveting exchange went suddenly flaccid. At their advanced age, they seemed accustomed to that type of phenomenon, casually striding over to shoot the shit with us as if they hadn’t just been raving stark mad about something else moments earlier.

Slimy, lecherous old bastards. I had met the both of them before, and they always gave me the creeps. David and Franklin didn’t just make my skin crawl because they looked like the pair of bickering geriatrics that heckled the Muppets when they stood shoulder to shoulder (David stout like Waldorf, Franklin lanky like Statler). No, it was more than just their sleaze. There was something else I couldn’t exactly put my finger on. They were just *way* too chummy together, always whispering and smiling at each other but never sharing the topic with the room. "Conspiratorial" is probably the right word. Made it feel like whatever they were so giddy about, it was almost certainly at your expense.

Before Afonso and I could get ourselves situated in the lab, Franklin insisted on an official security clearance. Felt like overkill, but given the armada of hired guns at his beck and call, we weren’t in much of a position to refuse. He waved over a stocky man holding a metal detecting wand. His thick Russian accent and ornately decorated uniform led me to assume, correctly I might add, that he wasn’t purchased with the rest of the Portuguese mercenary battalion. No, this was Franklin’s personally selected right hand.

The man introduced himself as Milo. As he waved the metal detector around the edges of my body, I instinctively held my breath. Franklin’s second in command reeked with some toxic combination of Pall Mall cigarettes, stale orange peels and freshly slaughtered rabbit. The device started beeping over my rib cage, which, for whatever reason, caused Milo to smile, revealing a mouth full of silver fillings. Explained that I had some shrapnel embedded in my chest from my time in The Gulf War, and that the only other metal I had on my body was my stainless steel epilepsy medical alert bracelet. Two facts that Franklin was definitely already aware of, by the way.

Eventually, Milo backed off, and I could breathe again. Sufficiently pleased with my squirming, Franklin relented and David led us to our assigned work stations.

Afonso and I spent the rest of the evening confirming the functionality of our diving suits and our shark prods. Our first dive hunting for the LAL was to begin at daybreak.

I drew that mercury-adjacent symbol more times than I ever have before tonight. On notebook paper, on furniture, on my own skin. Typically, it surfaces from my subconscious four times a year. Today alone I’ve drawn it more than five times my annual quota. I stopped counting after thirty. If I’m not watching my extremities like a hawk, it just starts up again. My tight, involuntary grip on the writing utensils has cramped the muscles in my right hand to hell and back, as well as peeled a layer of skin off my palm. Whiskey, thankfully, seems to be calming the compulsion.

I’m praying for a deep, dreamless rest. An elusive sanctuary where I can hide from this symbol…this envoy bringing some unknown message from a place in-between the waking world and sleep. Through unexplainable extrasensory insight, however, I’m getting the impression that will not be the case.

We’re getting closer. I can feel it.

Afonso and I have trawled and cataloged miles of seafloor. On our most recent expedition, he believes he saw a fragment of LAL, slithering away only a few yards ahead of us. I knew he was right, but I couldn’t tell him how I knew.

He looks up to me, I think, and my method of detection is decidedly non-scientific. I don’t want Afonso to lose faith.

Seven days ago, I woke up with blood on my newly changed sheets. A sunburst of dried crimson radiating from the fabric laying over my torso, the smell of copper lingering stalely around me. I sprang up, attempting to access the situation. As I did, something released from my left hand, rattling when it landed on the wooden floor.

A pointed, silver tongue kissed with rusted gore.

I had been holding a carving knife while unconscious. Well, more than holding, actually.

In my sleep, my body had pilfered the blade from the kitchen, brought me back to my room, slid back into bed, and permanently engraved the [mercury-adjacent symbo](https://imgur.com/a/4n6b6st)l into the palm of my hand.

The rational parts of me braced themselves for the expected torrent of fear. I mean, it would've made sense to be scared. This cryptic, pulpy brand I now carry is objectively terrifying.

And yet, I was not afraid. Not in the slightest. If anything, my new regalia made me feel hopeful. Powerful, too. Like I was the vessel for something important.

Channeling some tiny splinter of The Progenitress and its living alloy.

When we dived, I could feel where to go. The brand was a compass. It hummed with crescendoing divinity as we approached.

Maybe if we find the LAL, I’ll explain it all to Afonso. Till then, the insignia will remain mine and mine alone.

**Log 23:** May 2001

***Contents:*** Personal Operational Logs

I am resigning from this operation. Called my handler, let them know that I’m done. The demand might precipitate my death, but that’s just another form of resignation to me. A less ideal version, but I’ll accept it all the same.

Franklin is more than welcome to deliver the round through my skull and throw me into the ocean. I deserve to be buried with Afonso.

We found the LAL today.

Over time, my brand ushered us to it. Moreover, it was an area I recognized with more than the writhing symbol in my palm.

It was [the hole.](https://imgur.com/a/NBiJcQp) The crevice documented by the *Diosfibras II* before they all vanished into thin air.

Afonso lost himself in it. Before I had even readied my shark prod, he was swimming into the fissure with reckless abandon.

I freaked out. Paddled as hard as I could to catch up to him. When I arrived at the edge of the hole, I saw him reaching out to something shrouded by inky blackness. I tried to radio him - tried to warn the kid to stay back, and to come back to me. We didn’t need to get a sample today. Now that we had found the LAL, we could let the mercenaries capture it another day. Told him that we didn’t need to shoulder the risks.

Before he could respond, the thing was above him. A giant iridescent droplet of shifting metal, at least twice Afonso’s size. It moved gracefully, almost eel-like.

A fragment of living alloy.

In the space of a few seconds, the LAL transmuted from a solitary being to thousands of impossibly thin needles, all positioned in parallel, bearing down on Afonso. In one smooth motion, a fraction of the needles winnowed cleanly into his torso, causing sprays of crimson mist to explode from the entry sites. I could see his face contorted into an expression of inconceivable pain, but I couldn’t hear him.

Unconsciously, I had disconnected my radio sometime before that. My branded extremity once again acting on its own, I assume.

Afonso violently extended all of his limbs outward. Instead of trying to escape or defend himself, he held his body spread and vulnerable. No doubt puppeted by the God Thread now coursing within him.

The remaining needles twisted themselves into multiple long, glistening braids. Once formed, they would strike. The first braid punctured his right thigh. Pulled his femur effortlessly through the tissue of his leg, sinew and tendons draping gracefully from the top of the bone like an ornate tribal headdress. The braid that held the femur snapped it in half. Scouring tendrils then grew from the braid, entering the center of the bone to siphon the marrow into itself, tinting the living alloy's silver flesh a sickly red-white.

Over the next thirty seconds, other braids did the same for Afonso’s left femur, the bones in his upper-arms, and a handful of his ribs.

Once it was done with Afonso, the thing just dropped him into the hole, drifting slowly downward until I couldn’t see him any longer.

I thought I was next, and honestly, that was fine by me.

But the living alloy never approached me. It was like it couldn’t even sense I was there. Instead, the braids followed his corpse into the hole.

We are sleeping on the boat tonight. By the time I surfaced, it was almost nightfall, and a storm was brewing on the horizon. Too far from the coast to leave the area safely. No lighthouses on the island.

As I was typing this, I heard a soft tapping on the window of my bedroom. It’s a porthole, since my cabin is deep below deck.

It was Afonso, pressing his face against the glass. Though, I knew it was not really him. It was just the LAL wearing his genetics as a second skin.

The mimic traced its finger along the window, leaving a red-white trail of residue that was most likely the last true piece of Afonso that I’d ever see.

Using the stolen marrow like paint, it drew the mercury-adjacent symbol on the window for me to see. Grinning, the false Afonso beckoned awkwardly for me to follow him, and then swam quickly into the abyssal depths below.
