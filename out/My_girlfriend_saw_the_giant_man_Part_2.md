Alright so I told y’all about the giant man in my room that one night and I talked to my girlfriend about how well my post was doing. She asked me some questions about the man I saw and she told me she also saw something similar one day when I wasn’t there. What is going on? I thought they wouldn’t come for me, they promised.

I was cleaning some dishes so I could cook some stuff together for dinner, it was a few days after I quit my dinner job so I had more free time. Every so often I hear those weird knocks ya know? The ones that are from the apartment settling. I was washing the knifes and while I was doing dishes I happened to be holding one of the smaller steak knives when there was the knocks then this bang on the screen door. I ended up slicing my finger which I told you earlier.

Anyways, I looked out the screen door to the backyard area after the bang cause I thought it was the fat raccoon trying to go through something out there. At first I didn’t see anything cause my eyes hadn’t adjusted to the daylight just yet but I don’t know I got this weird chill down my spine. I felt like I was being watched.

I finally was able to look outside clearly once my eyes adjusted but I was so confused cause I saw this guy outside. I thought he was one of your friends cause he was wearing these camo pants you have. The strange thing though was that he had his back to me and from what I could see, he wasn’t wearing a shirt and he was huge. His head was grazing one of the lower branches on the pine tree out back. 

I felt like transfixed by this guy for a minute and he was suddenly looking at me like from over his shoulder. All I could see was one eye and this is gonna sound weird but he had these piercing blue eyes and it almost reminded me of like a summer sky. At first they were beautiful but then I had this creeping feeling like I was being hunted or I was so close to something that could hurt me.

I blinked and I swear that’s how quick this was, he was gone. I didn’t hear him move or anything, like he was just gone. Who was that? I thought you said we didn’t have to worry about them?

After she explained some other things, she also told me that after that she’s felt uncomfortable during the rest of the day till I came home. I should admit something before I post more about these strange events, I was part of a group that worshiped these half giant people. This man perfectly depicts this creature that we were told about it, I left the group but my friend knew more. I’ll tell you all about what he told me on another post.
