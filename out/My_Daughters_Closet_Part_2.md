Part 1:https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/16q11aj/my\_daughters\_closet\_part\_1/  
  
It was just after lunch on a weekday and I was cleaning the dishes while my husband was at work and my daughter was upstairs playing. I was just thinking about what to make for dinner when I heard a knock on the front door. I was rather puzzled by this, since we weren’t expecting anyone coming over today, nor were we expecting any deliveries. But nevertheless, I dried off my hands and went to answer the door. But just as I made it to the door, I suddenly felt uneasy, as if something was telling me not to open it. Instead I looked through the peephole. There, standing just outside the door, stood a man with long greasy hair. I say that because that was the first thing I noticed about him, since it covered most of his face. He was wearing sunglasses and a long dark green hoodie with the hood up. I immediately felt the hairs on the back of my neck standing at the sight of him. I knew right away that this man was up to no good. I remained silent as I watched him through the peephole.  
  
I thought that if I kept quiet, he would eventually go away. However, he continued to stand there by the door, moving his head from side to side, as if checking to see if anyone was watching. I wasn’t sure what he was up to, but he didn’t seem like he was moving anytime soon. He knocked once more, this time more aggressively. I didn’t want Bella to hear the noise and come downstairs to see what was happening, so I decided to speak up.  
  
“Hello?” I called out, not opening the door. The man perked his head up, and his body seemed to stiffen.  
  
“Hello ma’am,” he said, in a low tone. “I’m from the repair company. I’m here because your husband called and said that there were some problems with the lights upstairs. Could I please come inside?” I knew right away that was a lie. There was no electrical problem of any sort.  
  
“I’m sorry,” I said, “But I think there’s been a mistake. We don’t have problems with the lights anywhere.” I could see the man getting agitated as he moved from one foot to the other, still looking to each side of the house.  
  
“We got a call from your husband, Thomas, telling us to come in and look around.” His voice was much lower now, getting more aggressive with each word. My heart was racing a million miles an hour now and my breath was starting to get heavy. He knew my husband’s name. That means they must also know that he’s not home. But I steeled my nerves and called back to him.  
  
“I know my husband didn’t call you!” I shouted as I gripped the door knob tightly. “I don’t know who you are or what you're doing here, but you need to leave right now!” The man’s features hardened and was now banging furiously on the door.  
  
“Open the door!” he shouted. But I didn’t back down.  
  
“I’m calling the police!” This seemed to do the trick as the man started backing away and headed towards what I can assume was his car. Feeling a sense of relief, I released my grip on the door and pressed my back against it, thinking that it was all over. But Just as I was trying to calm myself down, my daughter came running downstairs in a panic  
  
“Mommy!” she cried out. Seeing the fear in her eyes, I quickly ran over and gripped her tightly.  
  
“What is it?! What’s wrong!” I asked frantically. Bella wrapped her arms around me and began sobbing.  
  
“There’s a man in the backyard!” she cried. My eyes widened after hearing that. “Max said he heard something so I looked out the window and there was a big scary man out there!” My breathing started to tremble as I was beginning to panic now. There was no way that the man from before could make it to the back yard in the amount of time that he did. There had to be more than one of them.  
  
I held my daughter close as I looked frantically around the house, trying to see if I could spot them. Just then, I heard a tapping on the kitchen widow. I looked to the kitchen and I saw him. Another man, wearing all black with shorter, but just as greasy hair as the first man. His face was all dirty and scabby. He was staring at us with wide, bloodshot eyes. He looked like he was heavy on drugs.  
  
He was looking at us with the most sinister grin I had ever seen. He licked his lips as he stared at my daughter with hungry eyes. Suddenly the front door was banging violently and I knew that it was the first man trying to kick down the door. Quickly, I grabbed my daughter and ran upstairs. But just as I reached halfway, I realized with horror that I forgot my phone in the kitchen. I was about to run back down to grab it when I heard glass breaking from the back door. It was too late to grab it as I Picked up Bella and ran into her bedroom. When Bella was younger, she was always exploring around the house and somehow managed to break both my bedroom and bathroom locks. At least in my daughter’s room, there was a dresser close enough to the door that I could brace against it.  
  
I ran into the room with Bella in my arms and placed her on the bed before quickly shutting the door and shoved the dresser in front of it. After that, I went back to Bella and held her tight as we sat next to her bed at the opposite corner of the room. Bella was sobbing uncontrollably and I placed my hand over her mouth. Though it didn’t really matter in the end, they already knew we were here.  
  
We could hear the men stomping up the stairs and stopped in front of the door. Everything was quiet now. So quiet that I could feel my heart pounding in my ears. It was pounding so hard that I thought that it was going to explode in my chest. Bella managed to calm down her sobbing, but she was shaking violently in my arms.  
  
“We know you’re in there,” said one of the men. “Come on out. We just want to play.” Bella’s sobbing returned and she looked up at me with terrified eyes.  
  
“Mommy?” she whimpered. I held her tighter.  
  
“Shhh. It’s going to be okay, sweetie. Mommy’s here.” I knew it wasn’t though. These men were just outside the door and neither the police nor my husband had any idea what was happening. We were all alone. I held my daughter’s head close to my chest so that she wouldn’t see the tears falling from my eyes.  
  
I heard the door knob turn and the door opened, but stopped once it hit the dresser in front of it. Now knowing that something was blocking it, the men began banging on the door with fury, causing Bella to scream.  
  
“Let us in!” they shouted. “Don’t make this harder on yourselves!” With each bang against the door, the dresser was pushed forward inch by inch.  
  
“Go away!” I screeched. “Leave us alone!” Bella was now screaming in my arms as she was holding on to me for dear life.  
  
“Max!” she cried out to her imaginary friend. With one final push, the dresser fell over and the door was now opened. The two men slowly entered the room and I saw that each one of them was holding a knife.  
  
“Now then,” the man with the sunglasses said with a sickening grin. “Let's play.” I knew this was it. There was nothing left to do. I held my daughter tighter than I ever had before and found myself sobbing relentlessly.  
  
“Please,” I pleaded. The men just laughed at me as they stepped closer. They were just a few feet away and the black hooded man was about to reach for my daughter. This was it. They were going to kill me and take my daughter away and do God knows what to her. I wanted to move, to fight them, but my body refused to move. I was petrified with fear. It felt like that night before Bella was born all over again. But this time the danger was real and there was nothing I could do to stop it. For a moment, I thought about all the times I had with my family. All the smiles and laughs that we shared. All the joy that was felt. I didn’t want it to end. I wanted more time with them. To see my daughter grow up and get married. To have a family of her own. But just like that, it was all going to be over.  
  
Just then, there was a light bang, causing everything to go silent. The two men looked around for whatever made that sound. Then there was another sound. It was tiny, but there was a scratching sound coming from somewhere in the room. The two men turned towards the closet, where the scratches were coming from. I reluctantly took my eyes off them and looked to the closet as well. It almost sounded like there was an animal trapped inside.  
  
“What’s in there?!” the man in the dark green hoodie shouted. “A dog!”  
  
“I don’t know!” I shouted back. I truly didn’t know. Had an animal gotten inside during all the commotion? I had no idea what was happening. The man looked to his buddy.  
  
“Check it out,” he ordered. The second man slowly made his way towards the closet as the scratching continued. But just as he reached the doors, the scratching stopped. The silence was deafening as the man hesitantly placed both hands on each knob. He then quickly opened the folded doors, but only slightly. He jumped back, expecting there to be a dog inside, but there was nothing there. Confused, he looked back at his buddy with a shrug before leaning in further, looking from left to right.  
  
It was at that moment that something grabbed his head and pulled him upward. The force caused the doors to shut behind him as the man was now screaming from inside, along with a terrible growling and hissing.  
  
“What the fuck?!” the green hooded man shouted. “What the fuck is in there?!” I didn’t acknowledge him and kept my eyes glued to the closet doors as they shook violently. The screaming continued for what seemed like an eternity before they finally stopped. A loud thud soon followed, which I could only assume was the body hitting the floor. This caused the closet doors to be pushed open slightly. There was nothing but silence as everyone kept their attention fixed on the closet.  
  
Just then, I saw a dark figure drop from the ceiling. I couldn't see it completely as my daughter’s bed was blocking most of the view. All I could see was a dark hump from within the closet doors. It then started moving, slowly making its way out of the closet. From my peripheral vision, I saw the hooded man pointing his knife at whatever it was.  
  
“Stay back!” he shouted, though all the confidence in his voice was gone, now replaced with terror. I kept my eyes on the dark thing coming out of the closet until, from behind the bed, a long, gray hand appeared, pressing against the floor. A long arm soon followed. I watched in horror as the dark figure from inside the closet fully revealed itself in the middle of the room. It then stood up on its legs, staring down at the man in front of it.  
  
“Max!” Bella shouted happily. I looked down at my daughter in shock before looking back up at the creature. It looked like a man in shape only, but it was anything but. It was taller than any man I had ever seen. Its skin was dark gray in color and its arms and legs were thin and long, as well as its fingers, which had long fingernails, almost like claws.  
  
But its head was what I noticed more. It was much larger and its bottom jaw was twice the size of a normal man’s. But its eyes were the most distinctive feature. They were yellow where the whites would be, but not a sickly yellow. A dark yellow as that of a black cat. And their irises were orange, almost like fire burning within them. It continued to stare at the intruder, baring its teeth at him, which were sharp and jagged. The man seemed to be petrified as he faced down the creature. For a while, neither one seemed to move. I made sure to keep Bella in my arms and remained right where I was, terrified that if we moved, that creature would turn its attention on us.  
  
Finally, something seemed to awaken in the man as he quickly lunged at the creature. He tried stabbing it with his knife, but it simply moved out of the way. He tried stabbing at its head and chest, but it kept dodging his every move. Then, as the man was about to slash at its head, the creature swung its clawed hand at his and knocked the knife from his grasp. It then grabbed hold of the man’s neck and threw him against the opposite corner of the room from Bella and I. The creature let out a loud growl before it pounced on top of him and began to mercilessly attack the man.  
  
I quickly covered Bella’s eyes before turning away myself. All I could hear was both the man’s screaming and the growling from the creature. The sound of pounding and flesh tearing filled my ears. I tried to tune it out, but that was an impossible task. Soon the screaming stopped and everything went quiet. I dared to open my eyes and turn back around to see the creature looking down at the unmoving body lying upon the floor. I stiffened with fear as the creature slowly turned its gaze to us. I thought that it was going to attack us next, but then I saw its eyes. Before, they were full of hate and anger. But as I looked into its eyes, they were now filled with sadness. I was greatly confused, but did not move from my spot.  
  
As we continued to stare at each other, the creature lowered itself, pulling its knees to its chest to make itself into a little ball, just as Bella described. I wasn't sure what it was doing, but I wasn’t going to take any chances. However, before I could stop her, Bella pulled herself from my arms and ran over to the creature.  
  
“Max!” she cried as wrapped her little arms around the creature’s neck.  
  
“Bella!” I called out, but she ignored me. Then, to my astonishment, the creature gently wrapped its arms around Bella. I felt my heart stop when it had my daughter in its arms. What’s going to happen now? The monster had its arms around my daughter. Was it going to attack us now?  
  
But it never made a move of any sorts. It just held my daughter in its arms as Bella remained right where she was. I wasn’t sure what was happening, but I felt helpless should this thing decide to rip us apart.  
  
But then it looked up at me with its bright yellow eyes. The look it gave me wasn’t at all what I was expecting. From the moment we locked eyes with one another, it gave me a look of what I can only describe as worry, like it was just as afraid as I was. What did this creature have to be afraid of?  
  
It then looked down at Bella before closing its eyes and letting out a heavy breath. Its face fell to what I recognized to be sadness.  
  
“Bella,” the creature spoke in a slow gurgling voice. It pulled away from Bella’s embrace to look her face to face. “Bella. It. Is. Time.” Bella cocked her head to one side, as she always did when she was confused.  
  
“Huh?” she spoke.  
  
“Max. Must. Go.” Bella didn’t like what he said at all and began to cry.  
  
“No!” Bella cried. “No! I don’t want you to go!” She hugged his neck once more, holding on tightly. The creature looked down at Bella with a sadness that I hadn’t expected from anything other than a human. It embraced Bella in a gentle embrace as it shut its eyes.  
  
“I’m. Sorry,” it said. “I. Can’t. Stay. Any. More”  
  
“But mommy will let you stay!” she continued to plead. “I know she will!” The creature, Max then looked up at me, as if asking me to help. My body still felt weak from everything that had happened. My heart was still pounding a million miles an hour and my hands were trembling terribly. But I somehow managed to stand up and slowly stepped closer to them. I cautiously reached for Bella, still keeping my eyes on the creature in front of me, and gently grabbed her arms.  
  
“Bella, let go,” I said just above a whisper. My throat was dry all of a sudden.  
  
“No!” she cried out again. “He’s my friend! I love him!” I managed to pry Bella’s hands free from its neck and pulled her closer to the bed, holding her tightly in my arms, never looking away from it. The creature looked at me as well before lowering its gaze. For a moment, everything was quiet, save for the little girl crying in my arms. The creature then looked back up at Bella  
  
“Bella,” the creature said. Bella looked back at him, sobbing uncontrollably. The creature gave her a smile before pointing a long finger at her.  
  
“Max loves you,” it said. “Be good girl.” The creature then slowly stood up at full height. It then turned to the body behind it and picked up one of his legs. I covered Bella’s eyes, despite her protest, as it picked up the body and tossed it out the window that I didn’t realize was open. It then did the same thing with the other body in the closet before slowly climbing out the window, but not before turning back to the two of us. Bella was still crying as she turned in my arms to look at the creature. The creature gave Bella one last smile.  
  
“Good bye,” he said slowly. With that, he jumped from the window and into the backyard. Bella and I quickly climbed on the bed to look out the window to see him making his way towards the woods with the two bodies. He tossed them over the fence and climbed over himself. The last thing I saw from him was his long gray hand disappearing behind the fence.  
  
The police soon arrived after that. Turns out, one of the neighbors saw them break into the house from across the street and called the authorities. I didn’t know what to tell them, or even begin to explain what happened. So I just said I managed to fight them off before they fled into the woods as they arrived on the scene. The two officers that were there were a little unsure of my story, but didn’t argue about it. My husband came home not long after and I explained to him the same story I told the police. He kept on asking how I was able to hold them off, but all I said was that everything happened so fast that I couldn’t remember. This seemed to satisfy him, at least for the time being. We cleaned up the house after the police left to search the woods, but they couldn’t find anything. It took a while but we managed to fix all the damages that those men caused.  
  
After that, I went up to the attic for the first time since moving there. What I found was astonishing. There was a large nest of fabrics, sticks, and stuffings, all packed neatly in the far end of the attic. He had been living in our attic all this time, and I had no idea. It was rather unnerving to know that there was something living just above you for years without your notice. But then I thought about how happy he made our daughter, and it made the situation a little less unsettling.  
  
Bella slept in our room for weeks after that day. My husband thought it was because she was afraid to sleep alone, but I knew that wasn’t it. She was sad that her only friend, whom she had spent so much time with, was now gone from her life. I played with her as much as I could to make her feel better. After a couple months, Bella was starting to act like her old self again. I soon thought that she forgot all about it, but I would never forget.  
  
It’s been years since that day, and we had all been living our lives like normal. Bella was now in Highschool making so many new friends. She was the captain of the lacrosse team and a sure win for scholarship. I was so proud of her.  
  
I had continued to be a stay at home mom. But not a day went by that I didn’t think about what happened that day. How that creature, how Max saved both mine and my daughter’s lives. The more I thought about it, the more I thought of him less like a monster, but rather a lonely soul. All that time that he was in my house, he was protecting my daughter, being a friend to her. He even told my daughter to spend more time with me when I was feeling lonely. I realize now that he was never a danger to us. All he wanted was a friend.  
  
I doubt I’d ever see him again, but part of me wished I would, so that I could thank him for everything that he did for us. For what he did for my daughter.  
  
One night as I was about to set the table for dinner, I received a call from my husband, who told me that he was going to be late coming home. I thanked him and continued setting up the table, but with only two plates. Just then, my daughter, who was in the backyard practicing her lacrosse, opened the back door.  
  
“Your father’s going to be home late tonight,” I told her. She nodded but was looking at me nervously.  
  
“Hey, mom?” Bella asked sheepishly. “Since Dad is coming home late, do you mind if I invite a friend over?” I looked over at my daughter with a raised eyebrow.  
  
“It’s a little short notice,” I said. “But sure. Who is it?” Bella smiled before taking a step to the side.  
  
“I think you’ll remember him,” she said. She looked down and motioned her hand forward. “It’s okay.” My eyes widened as I saw a long, gray hand slowly appear from around the corner. I covered my mouth in surprise as I immediately recognized what it was, or rather, who it was. I looked up at my daughter, who was looking back at me nervously. I closed my eyes and took a deep breath. I slowly removed my hands from my mouth, showing my daughter a wide smile with teary eyes.  
  
“Of course,” I said. “I’ll set another plate.”
