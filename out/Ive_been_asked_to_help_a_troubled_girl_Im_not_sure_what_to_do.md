"Everyone's eyes are missing from their faces."

“What do you mean by that?” I asked her calmly, making note of her body language. Each time my patient spoke, she avoided eye contact entirely. She’d dart her eyes around, as if scared to land on one thing for too long. Her hands were folded in her lap, and her left knee bounced rhythmically.

“There’s nothing there,” She murmured, mind in a different place. “Where the eyes should be.”

“Can you describe it more in length?” I asked.

She paused before speaking again. “They still have noses. And mouths. And eyebrows, I guess. But there’s no eyes. It’s just…smooth.”

“I see,” I wrote that down. “How long have you been seeing this?” She shrugged, fidgety as ever.

“Does it frighten you?”

“Sometimes,” She replied, now looking to the floor.

“Is that why you don’t want to look at me?” I began. She tensed her shoulders, so I added, “You don’t have to. I’m just curious.”

“I don’t know,” She spoke quietly.

“It’s alright, I won’t make you do anything you’re not comfortable with.” I tapped the notepad lightly with my pen, coming up with some other questions. I wondered to myself if this was a side-effect of an underlying condition, manifesting into her reality.

“How about pictures? Or mirrors? Do people still look funny there?”

“It’s not funny.” She said bluntly, then immediately shrunk back into herself, as if expecting discipline.

“I’m sorry, Brynn.” I conceded. “I only mean, do they still not have eyes when you’re not looking directly at them?”

“Yes.” She nodded. “But it’s worse.”

“Do you mind telling me how so?” I tried to be as inoffensive as I could with my words and tone.

The more I knew, the better understanding I had of what she was experiencing. But I also knew not to probe too much, or I lose the chance of hearing more. Some patients require lots of patience and security, and I had no problem obliging. So far Brynn had shared with me far more than she has in our previous sessions, and I wanted to see more into her world. Get an idea as to why she had done what she did, leading to her school expulsion.

“Their entire face is…wrong.” Brynn began to explain, struggling with which words to choose. “They’re warped and stretched and confusing to look at. The longer I stare, the more it changes into something worse. Until I can’t look anymore and have to shield my eyes.”

“That sounds quite unpleasant,” I frowned. “You said this is only in pictures and mirrors?”

“Yes. For now.” She breathed with a shudder.

“For now?”

“Sometimes, I see the faces in the real world too. In the sides of my vision. And if I look at it it goes away, but I don’t think that will last for long.”

I sighed. I felt deeply sympathetic for her. She seemed to be battling against demons created by her mind, fueled by anxiety and stress. I tried to piece together what she told me with what I knew, and the main reason the state had hired me to help her in the first place.

Even her own parents cowered before her, relieved as soon as she stepped out of their car in my driveway. It sickened me they’d deny her love and support in these trying times, but I was only seeing one perspective. Brynn has yet to deliberate any issues with her family.

“Were you experiencing this when you attacked that girl in April?” I said slowly, hoping to reintegrate the incident in her mind as unobtrusively as possible. “If you don’t want to talk about it, I underst-“

“That wasn’t a girl!” Brynn pleaded, finally looking towards me. She paused for a fraction of a second before snapping her head away, terrified. “It was one of them disguised as her, I swear! I would never hurt someone like that unless I had to!”

“Ok.” I bit my lip, glancing at my files. “So you believe that you were in danger?”

“She was stronger than the others.” She didn’t answer my question, but I chose to momentarily lean in to that comment.

“The others as in the faces?” I clarified.

“Yes.”

“You perceive them as…other people? Not just strange faces but separate entities?”

I knew I should avoid putting words in her mouth, as it was best to let her come to her own conclusions, but I couldn’t help myself. A part of me was morbidly curious, trying to accept how a child could brutally maim another child with nothing but a rock and her bare hands. The pictures provided from that day were visceral and disturbing. Brynn so far seems troubled, but not to this degree. Not to the degree of severe institutionalization, as the court suggested.

“Yeah!” Her face melted with relief, tears welling on her lower lashes. “They’re not human. Just shadows or glitches. But they follow me everywhere! And that girl, she wanted to hurt me! She told me awful things….”

And then the tears fell as she dissolved into sobs. I reached for my tissue box and handed it to her, allowing her to get it out of her system.

“You are very brave for telling me all this.” I started. She had her face buried in her palms, hiccuping. “We can be done for today if it’s too much.”

“It’s fine.” She choked. “I just need a minute.”

“Take all the time you need.”

I leaned back and glanced around the room, eyes flickering over the mirror hung on the wall behind the sofa. In the reflection was myself, my desk to the right, the window to the left spilling light from the afternoon.

And then I saw it. Like a spec or an illusion, there was a second face over my own. One with a twisted grin, hollow eyes, pupils swelled in the sclera. I shut my eyelids and shook my head. I didn’t even need to convince myself I was seeing things, I already felt so confidently I had. I opened them and saw it again, but much closer, face pressed against the other side of the mirror like it was a window.

I jumped, startled, and Brynn snapped her head up. “Sorry,” I laughed. “Just had a sudden chill.”

I’m not sure she could tell if I was lying, but regardless she didn’t push it. We concluded our session on a high note, talking about how proud I was of her progress. As soon as she left my office, I removed the mirror from the wall and stashed it into a closet.

Then, I made a call.

“Hello?” Brynn’s mother answered, voice etched in trepidation.

“Hi, Mrs. Barker,” I began. “I’m calling about Brynn’s progress so far in my sessions.”

“Oh,” Mrs. Barker was timid and sheepish, speaking at a barely audible murmur. “How is she doing?”

“Really well.” I replied. “But before my next session with her, I wanted to see if I could have you and your husband come in. I want to get your perspective, if that’s alright.”

“Just us?”

“For a session, yes.”

She paused. “That’s fine.” She answered.

We scheduled a time, and I hung up with an exhale.

When Mr. and Mrs. Barker arrived, I showed them to my office and had them choose their own seats. They sat on the sofa, a person’s length between them.

I asked then how they were, offered them some bottled water. They were very uncomfortable in each other’s presence as well as my own, displaying a clear lack of trust. I wondered how long they’d been like this, if it had anything to do with Brynn’s behavior.

“How long have you been together?” I began, wanting to see their reaction. Subtle facial expressions and body language would notify me whether or not the subject of their relationship was one of merriment or tension.

“Ten years,” Mr. Barker replied, seemingly neutral about the topic. “Married two years before Brynn was born.”

“That’s lovely,” I added. “My husband and I are coming up on our sixth year this June.”

“Congratulations.” Mrs. Barker smiled meekly.

“Do you have kids of your own?” The husband asked.

“No, we don’t plan on having children.” I replied. “But we do have plenty of pets.”

“That’s nice.” He nodded.

“Is it just you three at home?” I crossed my legs. “Any pets of your own?”

“We had a cat once.” Mrs. Barker fidgeted with her nails, picking at her cuticles. “That was a while ago.”

I figured this was enough preamble before diving into the meat of the conversation. “Brynn seems quite lonely,” I said. “Maybe another pet could help her, if you’re open to the idea.”

“We can’t trust her with pets anymore.” Mr. Barker stated. That piqued my interest.

“Do you mind telling me why?”

He pondered, then shook his head.

“Well, I won’t force your hand, of course.” I began. “But this is a safe space. The more you share with me, the better I can help Brynn.”

He sighed, then sunk further into the sofa. “Brynn was an infant when we had the cat.” He shared. “He was an older family cat from my late mother. One day, we heard Brynn crying from her crib. Julie went to check on her,” He glanced over to his wife. “And she found him in pieces.”

“Pieces?”

“He was strewn about like he had been mauled.” Julie answered. “It was…horrifying.”

“Do you think it might’ve been an intruder? A stray dog that may have wandered in your home?” I asked.

“No, that’s not possible. At the time we lived in an apartment, fifth story.” The husband said. “It wasn’t a large space. We would have heard someone enter.”

“When you saw the cat in the state he was in,” I thought aloud. “What was going through your mind?”

“I’m sorry, but I want to move on.” Julie looked distressed, so I dropped the subject.

“Anything else peculiar with Brynn? She’s told me some troubling things that she’s seen as of late.”

“The angels?” Julie raised both her brows. She saw my confusion and blushed.

“Sorry.”

“Don’t be,” I studied her. Angels was an interesting choice of words. I would’ve understood entities, ghosts, maybe glitches. But angels was very specific. “Has she called them angels?”

“No,” The husband’s faced morphed into a scowl. “Julie insists on calling them that.”

She shot him an apprehensive glare.

“So, regardless,” I continued. “How long has she been talking about these…angels?”

The husband looked to his wife, expecting her to answer. She did the same to him. Both had some kind of silent communication between the two of them, and Julie sighed. “We really wanted to have a baby.”

“Pardon?”

“Kent and I had gotten married and wanted to have a child.” Julie clarified. “I got pregnant with a girl.”

This wasn’t what I had initially asked, but I sat back and let her continue.

“Five months into pregnancy, I suffered a miscarriage. It was devastating. I didn’t know what to do with myself. I was living a waking nightmare and I wanted to die.

“Then, one day, I was at the store and I ran across an older looking woman. She approached me and said she was sorry for my loss. I don’t know how she knew, and at first I was angry, telling her to screw off and leave me alone. But then she offered to help me. I was about to pass her off as crazy, but she handed me a card and told me to call her when I was ready.

“I wanted to throw that card away so badly. But I couldn’t. I didn’t know who this woman was, but on the card she listed herself as a ‘fertility witch’. Sounded made up but I was beside myself with grief. So I went anyway, and took Kent with me. He tried to talk me out of it but I just needed to see. Get the curiosity out of my system.”

“Her office was the very definition of what you’d expect.” Kent added. “Shrunken heads, animal bones, dried herbs, crystals. The woman beckoned Julie to lay down and offered to perform a ritual for free. We were uncomfortable and declined, but the woman said something that rattled us. She said the name of our baby, and there was no way she would’ve known. We had wanted the name to be a surprise, so only my wife and I knew.

“This should have been what sent us on our way, but Julie and I felt some kind of deeper connection. This woman seemed to be legit, and we allowed her to do the ritual.”

“And then I was pregnant again.” Julie said. “As if we got a second chance, Brynn was back inside me developing as a beautiful healthy baby. We delivered her with ease. We couldn’t have been happier.”

“And then the…’angels’ appeared.” Kent’s brows furrowed, his expression turning grim. “They followed Brynn everywhere, and by proxy began to haunt the people nearest her. We saw them in the dark corners of our house, the alleyways of downtown, in the reflections of the mirrors and car windows and water in the tub. We also tried to ignore them. But each birthday Brynn had, the angels would do something drastic, as if lashing out against us before fading back into distant apparitions.”

“The death of our cat was one such instance.” Julie added. “The others I don’t wish to speak of, but they are similar. She’d turn another year older, the angels would do something bad, and then cease to be an issue until next year. They never worsened in severity, so we falsely assumed we could manage. Prepare for what would happen and deal with it.”

“So,” I finally broke the silence, unsure of how to process this information. “This instance with Brynn attacking her schoolmate…is it birthday related?”

“No,” Julie broke into nervous tears. “That’s why we’re so scared.”

“It’s almost like it’s corrupting her now.” Kent held his wife’s hand and gave it a singular squeeze before letting go. “It’s starting to bleed into everyday life and we’re at our wits end.”

I looked at them for a moment before coming up with a response. “I’m sorry, but I find this incredibly hard to believe.” I began.

“I know, I know.” Kent looked pleading. “I know how crazy it sounds. But that’s why we’re telling you. You’re a professional child psychologist, not a psychic or paranormal nutcase. You aren’t going to take my words to heart because it sounds ridiculous. But Brynn has opened up to you. She trusts you, where as any help we’ve tried to get from the church or elsewhere has just made things worse.”

“Everyday it gets harder and harder not to be afraid.” Julie continued to cry. “It’s ruining our relationship with Brynn and each other. We just want to know how to help her.”

That night I was tossing and turning, unable to get any rest. I was hoping to get some clarity from Brynn’s parents, but what Julie and Kent shared with me only added to the confusion. Did I believe in the supernatural? Not really. But the Barkers were fully convinced that Brynn was being haunted by entities that were slowly beginning to influence her. And yet, I’ve seen movies with similar plots. The brief visage of said entity in my office mirror wasn’t enough proof to validate any of this as true.

So were they making this up? Why? What benefit would the Barkers have in telling me this tale of demons and witches when their child’s very well being was at stake? I was the one who the state hired to see whether or not Brynn needed juvenile psychiatric treatment. She had hurt another student to the point of irreversible damage. The only reason she wasn’t behind bars was because she was eight. So didn’t Kent and Julie see how serious this was?

I dissented these questions to my husband, leaving out names and specific details as per protocol (though if you’re reading this now, that got thrown out the window.) He agreed with what I said, but also suggested I request documentation of Brynn’s birth, if I was able to. Try to see if she really had “been born again.” I wasn’t too keen at first with the idea, but decided it could be beneficial in helping Brynn by rooting out what was and wasn’t the truth.

The documents, to my surprise, were granted. There was her birth certificate, a miscarriage certification from the state months prior, copies of tests from both times Julie was first reported to be pregnant. The timeframe in between the miscarriage certification to the birth of Brynn was…strangely short. Only four months separated the two dates, which perplexed me.

I knew I was beginning to tread upon territory outside my pay grade, but I was too invested. I reached out to the doctor that signed off on both documents, hoping maybe I could get some answers.

“Hello?” The woman on the phone picked up after the third ring. “Yes, hi, my name is Dr. Grey and I’m calling about one of your previous patients, Brynn Barker.” The woman paused. “And you’re supposed to be..?”

“Her psychologist,” I replied, trying to find a way to justify my calling. “I’ve been asked by the state to begin treatment for her but I’ve noticed a discrepancy in her forms of identification.”

“I’m sorry, but I can’t help you. Despite her no longer being my patient, I have a confidentiality agreement.”

My hopes fell. “Ok, I understand. Tha-“

“But I no longer work for that hospital anyways,” She continued. “So said agreement must no longer apply, right? Not sure that’s how it works but we’ll roll with it.”

“Well, I would love it if you could perhaps stop by my offic-“

Again, another interruption. “Let’s meet somewhere else. Keep it on the down low.” “I understand.”

That evening I met up with her at a local sports bar. I found her sitting alone at a booth, drinking a beer and staring intently at her phone. I introduced myself and we shook hands before I sat.

And then, after I explained to her what the Barkers had told me, she shared her side of the story. It’s not unheard of for a woman to be pregnant soon after the gestation period of her previous miscarriage. If she was ovulating, she could be pregnant with another baby within the week. But according to the woman, Julie had shown back in her office a month later, six months pregnant. That was medically impossible. She tried to run more tests, consult other doctors, but the higher up’s ended up saying that she had made a mistake prior. But she hadn’t.

Undoubtedly, the fetus hadn’t survived in Julie’s womb. The woman even had a prognosis for the miscarriage, a cervical insufficiency. Despite this, Brynn was born healthy and it seemed the matter would get swept under the rug.

“Then I was approached by an older lady.” She continued. “This lady wasted no time telling me that she had performed a ritual on Julie in order to allow her to be pregnant, but it appeared to have backfired. Rather than have a new child, Julie’s womb appears to have reanimated her deceased child, which in the lady’s words ‘borders on necromancy.’” The woman shook her head.

“I was taken aback by the absurdity of these claims, but she told me to quit my practice at once. There are these angels that try to settle the score of death. If someone comes back to life, they intervene. I guess they can’t take back the life directly, but they will take the lives of others until the scales are balanced. It’s not as easy as an eye for eye. These angels will wreak all kinds of havoc and curse any who seek to get in their way. Which is why she advised I quit my job, for it would have unattended consequences there on. And so I ignored her outright.”

She looked to her hands, appearing guilty. “It took the stillbirth of my next two patients for me to finally understand. Any woman I saw I’d inevitably doom to suffer the loss of her child. I tried to get in contact with some of the other staff surrounding Brynn’s birth. Some of them killed themselves. Some others went insane. Most vanished without a trace.”

Then she turned to me with a look of urgency on her face. “Dr. Grey, I know it’s your job to help. Believe me. But Brynn cannot be saved, and you’ll damn yourself the more you try to interfere. If I were you, I’d tell the state she needs to be put away for the safety of herself and everyone around her.”

I was disgusted by her reply. So much so I stood without a single word and left the bar in a hurry. I got to my car and sat, gripping the steering wheel. After calming myself down with some deep breaths, I looked up and saw a fucked up version of Brynn behind me, reaching over with speed to grab onto my neck and strangle me. I struggled for breath and I tried to fight her off me, but it was unrelenting. I reached for my keys and stabbed one of them onto its arm, and it recoiled long enough for me to catch some air. I threw myself out of the car and fell onto the pavement, scrambling away. I turned back and saw my car was empty. I had merely stabbed my keys into the foam of my seat.

Now I sit at home, after having worked up the courage to re-enter my car. I have another meeting with Brynn tomorrow. But given all I know, and all I’ve seen, I’m not sure what to do.

I don’t want to abandon a child in need. It goes against everything I stand for as a person. But I’m not sure I have what it takes to give Brynn the help she needs.

Even now, my husband is making dinner in the kitchen behind me. I have to turn my back against him, because every time I see him from the corner of my eye, I notice his eyes are missing from his face
