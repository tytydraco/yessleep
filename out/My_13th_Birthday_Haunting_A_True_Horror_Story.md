Growing up, I was always obsessed with Halloween. Every birthday, I'd throw a spooky-themed sleepover, complete with scary movies and ghost stories. My 13th birthday was no different, or so I thought.

That night, we decided to watch *The Exorcism of Emily Rose*. My aunt, who was living with us at the time, kept warning us that we were inviting bad energy by watching such movies. We brushed it off as superstitious nonsense.

Around 1 AM, the real horror began. During a tense scene where Emily Rose peers out of her dorm room, my dog, who had never howled before, let out an eerie, spine-chilling howl from another room. It sent shivers down our spines, but we laughed it off nervously.

Not long after, my aunt came upstairs, her face pale and eyes wide. She didn't say much, just hovered as we continued watching. As the movie reached a climax in a barn scene with demons naming themselves, my aunt suddenly stood up. At that exact moment, the power went out, plunging the living room and my bedroom into darkness.

We weren't too alarmed initially; power outages were common. But the timing was too perfect, too terrifying. My aunt quickly flipped the breaker, and the lights came back. We didn't dare finish the movie. Instead, we put on SpongeBob to calm our nerves and fell asleep.

The next day, two of my friends left early, spooked by the previous night's events. My best friend stayed the weekend, but the house felt heavy, like a dark cloud hung over it.

Weeks went by without incident until the nightmares started. I dreamt of a tall, shadowy woman in a simple dress, her features lined but indistinct. She watched me as I ran through forests or fell down hills. Each morning, I woke up with deep, self-inflicted scratches, despite cutting my nails and even wearing gloves to bed.

The dreams grew worse, and the scratches deeper. My mom tried everything, even sleeping with me, but nothing helped. The school noticed the scratches and called CPS, leading to therapy sessions that provided no relief.

Eight months later, my mom made a sudden decision. One morning, I woke up to find all our things packed. We moved to my grandma's house, never to return. The nightmares and scratches stopped instantly. But since then, I've struggled with insomnia and anxiety.

Years later, my husband and I moved to an apartment near that old house. Within weeks, the scratching started again, though I didn't dream of her this time. We quickly moved out, but the memories linger.

When I recently spoke to my mom about it, she revealed a chilling detail. The night we left, she had seen the shadowy woman herself. The figure walked through our hall, stopped to look into my brother's room, then mine. My mom followed but heard a whisper, "You've already lost her." That was the final straw.

Since that fateful birthday, I haven't celebrated. The fear and the memories are too real, too raw. Was it anxiety or something supernatural? I still don't know. But one thing is certain â€“ some stories stick with you forever.
