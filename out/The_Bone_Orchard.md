I never believed the stories about the Bone Orchard. Around here, it’s one of those legends parents whisper to scare kids into behaving. A crooked patch of land at the edge of the woods where nothing grows but pale, brittle trees that snap under your fingers like old kindling. Supposedly, the soil is thick with bones—human, animal, and things that don’t fit into either category.

When I was little, my grandfather would lean forward in his recliner, his eyes glassy from bourbon, and hiss: “The trees ain’t trees at all. They’re roots, sucking marrow instead of water.”

I would laugh, but he’d scowl and add: “You’ll laugh till you hear ‘em knocking at night.”

I forgot those warnings until last year.



It started when my best friend, Daniel, convinced me to go hiking with him. We were both twenty-two, working dead-end jobs in town, desperate for something different to do.

He was the one who suggested the old trails that cut past the abandoned quarry.

“C’mon, man,” he said, his grin wide. “Nobody goes out there anymore. It’ll be like we’ve got the whole world to ourselves.”

I should’ve said no.

The air was thick and humid, the smell of damp moss crawling into my lungs. The further we went, the quieter it got. No birds, no rustle of deer in the underbrush. Just the crunch of our boots and the nervous jokes Daniel kept throwing over his shoulder.

Eventually, we found ourselves in a clearing.

The trees there were wrong. They were sickly white, and their bark flaked in sheets that looked like old skin peeling off a burn victim. Their branches curled upward like twisted fingers, sharp and brittle. The ground was covered in pale shards, not leaves—bone fragments. Some were as small as fingernails. Others were unmistakably human ribs, femurs, and skull fragments stained gray from years underground.

“This is it,” Daniel whispered, awe in his voice. “The Bone Orchard.”

I told him we should turn back. Everything in me screamed it. But Daniel crouched near one of the “trees” and started laughing.

“Dude, check this out.”

He pried something from the dirt. I thought it was a rock until he turned it in his hand. It was a jawbone, perfectly intact, teeth yellowed but still sharp.

“Souvenir,” he said, stuffing it into his backpack.

I begged him to put it back, but he just rolled his eyes.

That was the last normal night of my life.



The knocking started three days later.

At first, I thought it was a branch against the window. A slow, deliberate tap…tap…tap. But when I opened the curtains, the tree outside wasn’t moving.

The sound wasn’t random. It had rhythm, almost like someone knocking on a door.

Daniel texted me the next morning.

Daniel: Yo did you hear it too?

Me: …what?

Daniel: Tapping. On the walls. Like it’s inside the house.

I didn’t reply.



Over the next week, it got worse.

The knocking followed me from room to room. When I showered, it came from behind the tiles. When I tried to sleep, it rattled from inside my nightstand.

One night, I woke to find something pale wedged under my bedroom door. My stomach lurched when I picked it up—it was a human finger bone. Small. Child-sized.

I drove straight to Daniel’s place at three in the morning. His apartment was trashed, dishes broken, furniture overturned like he’d been looking for something. He opened the door with wide, bloodshot eyes.

“They want it back,” he whispered, clutching the jawbone. “I tried to bury it. I did. But it always comes back inside. I woke up with it on my chest.”

I told him to get rid of it for real this time. Burn it, throw it in the river, anything. He nodded frantically, and I left, sick with dread.

I never saw him alive again.



They found Daniel two days later.

The police said it looked like an animal attack. That’s what they always say when they don’t have answers. His body was shredded, ribs snapped outward like someone had climbed out of him instead of in. His jaw was missing entirely.

At the funeral, I tried to talk to his sister. I told her he’d taken something from the Orchard, that maybe it had something to do with what happened. She stared at me like I’d spit in her drink and told me to leave.

But I couldn’t let it go.

The jawbone wasn’t recovered.



I started having dreams.

In them, I stood in the clearing again, surrounded by those pale, skeletal trees. But instead of wind, I heard breathing. Heavy, wet, ragged. The ground beneath me shifted, cracking open like a ribcage splitting wide. Hands pushed through the soil, hundreds of them, bones slick with rot. They reached for me, fingers clacking against each other like teeth.

I woke each time with dirt under my nails and the taste of copper in my mouth.



A week after Daniel’s death, I found the jawbone in my own room.

I swear on my life I never touched it after that night in the Orchard, but there it was on my desk, grinning up at me. The teeth clicked together, as if they were laughing.

I screamed and threw it across the room. It hit the wall and landed with a crack—but when I looked again, it was gone.

That’s when I realized, it wasn’t just after Daniel. It was after me too.



I tried everything.

I called a priest. He sprinkled holy water on my apartment, muttered prayers under his breath, and left without charging me. That night, the knocking got louder.

I tried burning sage, pouring salt across the doorway, and sleeping in my car. It didn’t matter. The sounds followed.

Sometimes it wasn’t knocking anymore. Sometimes it was scratching. Bone on wood. Bone on bone.

Last night, I woke to whispers. Faint at first, like someone speaking from the other end of a tunnel. Then louder.

“Give it back.”

“Marrow.”

“Feed.”



Tonight, I’m writing this because I don’t know what else to do.

I haven’t slept in three days. My eyes are bloodshot, my skin clammy, my heart feels like it’s going to burst. The jawbone is back on my desk again, no matter how many times I throw it out.

And now the trees are outside.

I looked out my window a few minutes ago and saw them—those brittle, bone-white trunks growing up through the pavement, roots cracking through the asphalt. Their branches scrape against my building, tapping in time with my heartbeat.

I don’t know how they moved. Or maybe I didn’t move far enough away.

They’re not trees at all. My grandfather was right. They’re veins. Arteries. Extensions of something deeper.

Something alive.

I can hear it moving under the ground, shifting in the dark, its hunger rattling up through the hollow roots.

The Bone Orchard isn’t just a place. It’s a body. A corpse so huge we can’t see all of it at once. And Daniel didn’t just take a jawbone—he stole a piece of its mouth.

Now it wants mine.



The knocking has stopped.

It’s quiet now. Too quiet.

I think it’s inside.

If anyone reads this, don’t go near the Orchard. Don’t touch anything there. Don’t even look at it too long.

Because once it notices you, it never stops.

And when it’s hungry, it always finds a way to feed.
