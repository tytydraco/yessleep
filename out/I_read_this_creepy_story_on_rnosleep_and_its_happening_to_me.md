I’m sitting here on my bed, writing this all out quickly before I do anything else. Please, bear with me for any misspelled words. I sat up on my bed, around 2:31 AM I think, and read on r/nosleep. These stories never scare me, so i never had any problems with them. But i came across one, it had such a strange title, “A prediction for the future”. I thought it was weird, but I read anyways. I can’t remember all the details, but it went along the lines of a man trying to kill the woman and the woman does something, though I can’t remember what. He taps on her windows, bangs on the doors around her house. etc. It was your run-of-the-mill simple horror story, so I didn’t think much of it. Once I finished, I closed my phone down and flickered off my lamp, before fluffing up my pillow and starting to sleep for work in the morning. Suddenly, just as I’m about to fall asleep, I hear several taps on my window. I freeze up, slowly creaking my head towards the noises. I grabbed ahold of the lamp and flicked it on, staring at the window, ‘nothing’ I thought, laughing at myself for believing something was actually there. I turned the light back off, settling down twice for the night, before trying to sleep. Not too long after i flick the light off, I hear banging on my door. I shoot up from my bed and flick my light on. The door slowly creaks open, but nothing stands in the hallway, then it hit me. This is how the story started. The woman read  a story on r/nosleep, before the story happens to her. My heart sinks as I hear painfully slow taps on the window behind me, my hands shaking as I clutched the covers. I tried to calm myself down as I began to recall the events in the story. Since it was so late, I couldn’t remember much except the major details. First she reads the story, thinking nothing of it, then she falls asleep. Just as she’s about to, she hears taps on her window, before looking over to it and flickering her lamp on. After assuring nothing is there, she flicks the light back off before trying to sleep again. Again, she wakes to a bang on her door. At this she bolts upright and looks towards it, the door creaking open just enough to show her nothing is there. I begin to cry as I realize everything is playing out exactly as I read, ‘if I’m crying the next would be-’ I didn’t finish my thought before I heard glass break in my living room, I considered trying to see what it was, but I already knew. I heard heavy footsteps as I shakily stand up, tears streaming from my face as I yanked open my nightstand drawer. I kept weapons in case of emergencies, and this one was definitely one. I grabbed the hunters knife in my hand, the metal glistening in the moonlight shining through my window as the footsteps approached. “Knock knock” I heard a man’s voice coo as hot tears stream down my face, hitting the wooden floor and staining my night dress. “You know, it’s rude to ignore others when they’re talking to you” he grumbled, slamming the door open. He wore a black cloak, a strange mask on his face. All I can describe it as is a pumpkin on his head, but it was horribly mutilated. “What do you want from me?!” I screamed at the man, taking both hands onto the hunters knife and holding it out in front of me, spreading my legs in a defensive stance. “You already know how this plays out, right? It’s not a coincidence that story that  appeared on the no sleep community for you to read” he laughed, the throaty noise resonating from deep in his chest. I cried more, if possible, my eyes puffy as I clenched them several times, harshly blinking away the tears glazing over my eyes. “Fuck you!” I screamed, charging at him before thrusting my knife into his stomach, crying into his shoulder as he gurgled in my ear, blood raising in his throat as it started spluttering out of his mouth. “Go to hell, asshole..” I whispered in his ear as I yanked the knife from his abdomen and proceeded to stab him several times. “Fucking die already!” I screeched as I pulled him into me and skewered it into his back, leaving the knife in as he staggered backwards, falling onto the floor. I lunged onto him, yanking his head to the side and digging my teeth into his throat, ripping out chunks of flesh as I chewed them and swallowed quickly before going back to my previous activity. I panted as blood trickled down my chin, splattering onto my baby blue, silky night dress. I stared down at him, yanking the mask off his face and tossing it across the room carelessly. His eyes were shot open, rolled back into his head head as I admired the blood coating his face. “You picked the wrong fucker to kill tonight” I chuckled, yanking him by the arm and dragging him back to my bed. I lifted the covers from the end of my sheets, a horrific smell flooding out in an instant as I stared at the faces of all the others, a smile plastering itself on my face as I stuffed him under. His leg stuck out like a sore thumb, “You would’ve been perfect if you hadn’t had such long legs” I sighed, carefully grabbing it before shoving it upwards, a sickening crunch echoing around the room. I twisted the broken leg, blood spewing onto my floor as I shoved him under my bed once again. I climbed onto my bed, his blood staining my sheets as I lay on my belly, kicking my legs back and forth. It was all in self defense, and I tried telling the police about my psycho ex several times, I had to take it into my own hands, one way or another. So, am I the bad guy for killing my ex?
