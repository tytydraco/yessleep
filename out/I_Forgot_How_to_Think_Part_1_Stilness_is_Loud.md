I don’t remember stopping. That’s the scariest part. I just remember standing in line at a gas station and realizing I hadn’t had a single thought in maybe ten minutes.

No music in my head. No words. Not even the dumb ones like “Do I have milk?” or “Why is this guy breathing so loud?” Just nothing.

I was looking at a fridge full of sodas and there was this thick silence behind my eyes. Like someone wiped the whiteboard in my skull clean, then walked off whistling. You know, like Bugs Bunny would, or that woodpecker guy.

The cashier said something to me. I didn’t catch it. I was too focused on how empty my brain felt.

“You good?” he asked. I think his name tag said Jerith. Who names their kid Jerith?

“I’m thinking,” I said.

But I wasn’t. I was lying. And when I walked out, I forgot what I’d even gone in for.

That night, the silence didn’t go away. I lay in bed, staring at the ceiling, waiting for a thought to rise like it usually does. Something small. Something stupid. A grocery list. A memory. Anything.

Instead, I stared for hours and my head stayed blank.

I only realized how broken things were when I heard a knock at my door at 2:11 AM. Just two knocks. Like someone too polite to be a threat, but too bold to be a neighbor.

I peeked out the window. Nobody there.

I sat back down on the floor. I’d dragged my mattress out of the bedroom. It was too loud in there.

Yeah. Loud. I know how that sounds.

The silence in that room roared. It filled corners. It clung to walls. It pushed on my chest like it wanted in.

I didn’t sleep that night.

Next morning, I called my cousin, Zaylen. He’s loud, smokes a lot, has this gold fang he got just to feel “custom,” but he listens when it counts.

I told him, “I think I stopped thinking.”

He snorted. “What, like, you’re out of ideas? Or..”

“No. Like my brain ran out of sentences.”

He went quiet. Then: “You high right now?”

I wasn’t. And when I told him that, he changed the subject. I let him.

The weirdest thing is, people around me started acting like I’d always been like this. Forgetful. Blank. At work, Messiah, my supervisor, handed me a report I didn’t remember writing.

“It’s missing the final line,” he said.

“What line?”

He shrugged. “The thought you were building to, obviously.”

I flipped through the pages. My handwriting. My format. My words. But I didn’t remember a single one. It was like reading something written in a dream.

That night, I tried something. I stood in front of my mirror and said out loud, “Think of something.”

Nothing happened.

I tried harder. “Come on. Anything. Just one thought.”

My reflection looked tired. Older. My lips were moving but the voice didn’t feel like mine.

Then it whispered back.

Not the reflection. Not my voice. Just behind me. From the hallway.

“You already did.”

I turned around fast.

Nobody there. Lights off.

But when I looked in the mirror again, the hallway behind my reflection was lit.

I don’t know what’s happening. I don’t think anyone else sees it. Nobody’s talking about the silence. Nobody’s saying, “Hey, have you noticed your thoughts don’t sound like your own anymore?”

But I do.

I think something’s bleeding in.

And I think I’m the hole it’s using.

The days blend. I can’t tell where one ends and the next begins. My routine feels like a script I’m reading for the first time, like I’m doing the motions without understanding them.

When I go to work, Jerith at the counter doesn’t seem surprised by my face anymore. He barely looks up when I grab a pack of gum, or when I stand there staring at the candy aisle like it holds the answers to whatever’s wrong with me.

I could feel the question hanging in the air, but my mind never forms it fully. The silence weighs heavier each time I blink.

Something keeps slipping between my thoughts. Like there’s a hole in my brain, and every time I look away from it, something new gets sucked in. I keep losing pieces. Maybe it’s my job. Maybe it’s my house. Maybe it’s my family.

But I don’t know where any of those things are anymore.

Zaylen dropped by again. I was on the floor again, trying to remember what I was doing before I started staring at the wall. He knocked, then walked right in without waiting for an answer. I’m used to it.

“You good?” he asked, standing over me. He was holding a Styrofoam cup of something steaming.

I looked up at him, but the words got stuck in my mouth. I could feel them behind my teeth, but they wouldn’t come. So I just nodded.

“You’re not even gonna talk, huh? Alright.” Zaylen dropped to the floor beside me and kicked off his shoes.

“Do you ever just… stop?” I asked, finally forcing the question out. It felt strange. Like I’d been holding it in for days.

“This again?” He grinned, popping the lid off his cup. “Well yeah, I take breaks. You’re just trippin’ now, bro.”

“No,” I said. “I don’t know how to… I don’t know what’s real anymore.”

His grin dropped, but he didn’t say anything. He sat there, looking at me like he was trying to figure me out. I hate that look. It makes me feel like I’m a puzzle he can’t solve, so he just stops trying.

We stayed there in silence for a while, neither of us moving. It wasn’t a comfortable silence. It was like we were both waiting for something that hadn’t happened yet.

Eventually, Zaylen stood up and tossed the cup in the trash. “You should get out of your head, man,” he said. “Think about something else.”

“Can’t.”

He blinked at me, like he was waiting for me to explain. But I couldn’t. I just watched him walk out.

The silence in the room felt deeper after he left.

I spent the next few hours pacing, looking for something to break the pattern. But there was nothing. Not even the faintest thought. Not a single fragment.

When I went to the kitchen, I noticed something strange. The knives on the counter were arranged differently. Like someone had been standing there, moving them around.

I don’t remember doing it. I don’t even remember touching them. But there they were. Laid out. Like a message.

And it hit me. The thoughts I lost. Were they gone because I pushed them out? Or because someone else was taking them?

I called Messiah after that. I didn’t want to, but I couldn’t shake the idea that he might know something about this. He always acts like he has the answers to everything.

“Yo, you there?” I asked when he picked up.

“Yeah,” Messiah’s voice was steady. Too steady. “What’s up?”

I didn’t know what to say. What could I say? How do you ask someone if they’ve ever forgotten how to think? How do you explain that your brain feels like a stranger’s house you keep wandering into?

“I think I stopped,” I said, voice shaking. “Thinking.”

Messiah was quiet for a long time. When he spoke again, it sounded like he was trying not to laugh.

“Bro,” he said. “I think you’re overthinking. You don’t sound like you’ve stopped. You’re talking to me right now. And plus, you literally asked this, not even a week ago.”

“I can’t… I can’t explain it,” I mumbled. “Everything just feels empty. Like I’m waiting for something. But nothing’s coming.”

Another long silence. Then Messiah sighed. “You need to go outside. You’ve been cooped up too long, man. You’re scaring yourself. Take a walk or something.”

I hung up before he could say anything else. I didn’t need advice. I needed answers.

So I left.

The street was quiet, almost too quiet. No cars, no people. Just the sound of my shoes on the pavement. I didn’t realize where I was going until I stood in front of an old convenience store I hadn’t seen in years.

It was shut down, boarded up. But the lights inside flickered.

I walked up to the door, feeling like I was being pulled in.

The door opened with a groan when I tried it. Inside, the lights buzzed like they were about to die. The shelves were empty, except for one thing: a black notebook in the middle of the floor.

I reached for it without thinking.

But the moment my fingers touched the cover, I felt a strange thrum. Like something inside me snapped awake.

The notebook was warm. Not like paper should be. It felt like it was alive.

And then the words appeared.

“You’ve been waiting for me.”

I backed away from the book.

But the words kept coming.
