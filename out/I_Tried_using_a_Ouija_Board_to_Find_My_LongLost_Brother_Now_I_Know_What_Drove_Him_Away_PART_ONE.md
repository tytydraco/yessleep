I didn't used to be a fuck-up. That is to say, I didn’t used to be this fucked up. The downward spiral that is my current lot in life didn’t begin until the night my brother Russell disappeared. He was just eight years old.

We were living in Meadowville at the time – a neighbourhood in Aakoziwin, one of Toronto’s bedroom communities – Russell, our folks and I. The town was nicknamed “Kozy” by the teachers and over enthusiastic parents, which fit the boring yuppie atmosphere of the suburb. But the old timers and coarse teenagers referred to it by a choicer name.

We were living in a nice apartment complex near the town centre shopping area in our neighbourhood. Affordable, sure, and not as luxurious as the townhouses and open concept homes west of Winston Churchill Boulevard, but still good, and far better than the public housing unit we fled in the city. Our dad scraped and crawled to get us out of there – working two jobs including graveyard shifts at Burger King. Our mom was a homemaker but pinched every penny she could, even selling off her prized jewelry, including some heirlooms and gifts from their wedding. Eventually she even started working part-time hours at the Tim Horton’s then the nursing home off of Erin Mills. And even then, we still had to be careful what we bought: The Little Wizard action figure Harry Potter knockoffs from Dollarama, instead of the real Mccoy; second hand clothes from Value Village, the clearance rack at Old Navy’s if we were lucky; scratched up DVDs from the public library instead of Blu-Ray discs from Blockbuster or Rogers; my mother’s homemade spaghetti and meatballs on Friday nights, instead of ordering a pizza. But it was all right, at least as far as the four of us were concerned in our cozy little world in apartment 804 on McCallion Road. The hardest part was how Russell and I had to learn to turn the other cheek in the face of wealthier suburban kids who treated us like we had the plague. The same kids that threw their parent’s money around like it was tap water.

See that’s the thing about Kozy Aakoziwin – or any suburb outside a major city: it’s all about keeping up with the Joneses. Kids here don’t dream of becoming astronauts or NHL all-stars. Instead, they aspire to become accountants. Maybe engineers. That way their parents have something to brag about whenever they bump into the other hockey moms at the Startin’ Point shopping centre downtown. So that they themselves can tell people at their part-time or summer job, between flipping burgers or mopping warehouse floors, that they’re building to something better. Something in the near future. Something attainable, lucrative. Practical yet impressive. And the only kids who deign to dream of a future in something so baroque as showbusiness are the dumb-ass white boys in Lakeshore Park with too much of their parents’ money to care about good grades or postsecondary prospects.

Speaking of too much money, this brings us to the centre piece of my little fable: not my missing brother, Russell, mind you, but posh Meadowville native, Ashley Greyson. Ashley was everything I wasn’t. Pretty, fashionable, erudite, athletic, well off, and popular. She was the It Girl, in every sense of the word, possessing a confidence instilled by her educated, industrious parents, and an intelligence guided by the best tutors money could buy. She was the kind of girl a girl like me ought to despise. But, to my own surprise, I worshipped the ground she walked on, and was desperate to win her favour. I never tried to emulate her – my heavy eyeshadow, black lipstick, Doc Martens, and sleeveless denim jacket adorned with Dead Kennedy and Sex Pistol buttons, falling far a field of Ashley’s clean and preppy affectations. But I never stopped trying to be accepted by her, with my warts and all.

It had been nearly three years when I called her to hang out that night. Knowing that, like me, Ashley had a yen for the occult – more of a clandestine fixation for the immaculately reputable It Girl – I coaxed her into a late-night rendezvous with the promise of playing the Ouija Board.

At this point in the story, I’d love to tell you that our long separation was owing to Ashley’s enrollment at Western. But that would only be half true. Our tacit falling out began the same week Russell went missing. I wish I could tell you I remember the day he went missing like it was yesterday. That I recall the exact moment I realized something was wrong. That there were signs that something was bothering him. But that date and time is fuzzy now, smudged under the banal details of life and routine. I simply remember chewing my soggy cereal at the kitchen table, watching Russ grab his backpack and lope toward the door so to take the elevator down to the back lot where the school bus was waiting. When I arrived home that night, having spent the afternoon in band practice, I saw my ever-anxious mother with her face buried in a handful of Kleenex and my father pacing the room with the kitchen phone at his ear, the cord wrapping around his waist like a snake. A police constable later came by the house to talk to us. The cadet took our statements, asked to look around Russell’s room, and Russell, never ever came home.

His disappearance was like the first domino to fall, sending our family tumbling into disarray – winging us back into poverty. My dad, understandably obsessed with finding Russ, lost his job from calling in too many sick days to search for him. It didn’t help that when he did show up for work, he was either on three hours sleep, tops, or half in the bag (often both). Until this time in our lives, I’d never know my dad to touch anything as strong as beer. My mother stayed in bed for months on end, eventually leaving without word or a trace. We lost the apartment and Dad and I scrounged up the little we had left and moved back into public housing. Dad was able to keep us in Aakoziwin, but I still had to enroll in a new school as we had relocated to a poorer neighbourhood in the northeast quarter, and we couldn’t afford for me to take the city bus across town every day. By then it was better that I didn’t know anyone; at the old high school, I’d gone from the cute goth-girl novelty to an outright leper. I’d been branded unlucky, like a black cat crossing your path – everyone afraid misfortune was catching. I carried that blight to my new high school, along with accompanying jaded attitude, so nothing changed except the faces in the hallway, some that gawked, others that pointedly looked away. I didn’t bother making any friends besides the smattering of kids who hung out at the bottom of Smokers’ Hill, especially the ones who could get me alcohol.  

From grade eleven to this rendezvous, I’d began hitting the bottle. Hard. Not on weekends and holidays like most kids. Every day, starting from noon until I passed out at midnight. And I didn’t imbibe the designer booze for underage drinkers like Gold Schlager, Mike’s Hard, or Smirnoff Ice. I drank bottom shelf vodka, bottom shelf rye, drinking it straight from the neck until I was numb. I also got high. Again, the other losers planted on Smokers’ Hill helped with that. When I couldn’t get quality weed, I huffed glue. I did what I did to get my head out of that dingy public housing unit, from the black mold festered on the ceiling and floor tiles, from the graffitied stairwells, from the hard cases standing in the hallways like they owned it. Like they were Heisenberg in their own private meth den. Anything to chase away Russell’s memory, and the ghost of the possibility that he might still be out there. Somewhere.

I was still living in that two-bedroom box with my old man the night Ashley and I met up to play the Ouija Board. I was supposed to meet her outside our old high school at eight. Looking at my watch, a half-spent mickey of rotgut in my hand, I saw it was just past six. Knowing I only needed an hour, assuming the buses were on time, I swallowed the liquor then downed a warm tallboy I’d glommed from the trunk of my pop’s car. Not able to think of a good reason not to, I chased the liquor by inhaling a bag o’ glue in the stairwell before shipping off into the balmy June night.

I floated a foot off the pavement to the bus stop. By the time I’d arrived in front of our school, I’d mostly sobered up. My good mood was a pinch spoiled though when I checked my watch, seeing that the bus had arrived late. Never to be outdone, Ashley would arrive fashionably ten minutes later. Not accustomed to being alone with my thoughts, I dug in my knapsack, past the Ouija Board, and fished out a tube of glue and second paper sack. By the time Ashley arrived, I could barely stand or restrain my euphoric giggles. Ashley looked thoroughly unimpressed.

I greeted her hastily – eagerly, and she responded with a curt nod, not even meeting my eyes, the lion’s share of her attention absorbed by her phone. In the near complete dark of that humid, hazy night – the glow from her screen the only illumination of her face – I could see she hadn’t changed a bit. Still beautiful despite her frown and the scant light. Still slim, obviously not prey to the Freshman fifteen all the yuppies talk about.

“All right, Carla,” she drawled, not even attempting to hide her disdain. “What are we doing? I mean, out here so late and all?”

I shook my head, confused. “I-I told you, on the phone, man. We’re gonna play the Ouija Board tonight. Like we did back in middle school for sleepovers, remember?”

Ashley sighed with exasperation. Clearly, she’d soured on the idea on the way over. “You really want to bother with that stupid game?” she said. “You know it’s always just one of us pulling the planchet, having a laugh.”

I scrunched my nose. “’Having a laugh?’”

She rolled her eyes, as if to say, You wouldn’t get it. Probably some expression she picked up on campus. Something that soars above the heads of peasant-folk like me. Ever since moving to that high school in the northeast, I’d dropped what my dad calls “those 10-dollar words” and began talking like a stoner: ending every sentence with man, or dude, every other word being shit or fuck. No doubt people like Ash mistook this parlance for what truly resided inside my head.

I then noticed her scanning me, looking me up and down.

“Are you okay?” she asked, stifling a giggle.

“Yeah,” I said, sputtering. Adjusting my hair and shaking my head. “Yeah, of course, man, what? What do you mean, man? What’s wrong?”

Another eyeroll. She probably figured I was drunk. Not flying on solvents and ephedrine. I then discovered myself still giggling – my eyes tearing up from some mysterious inside joke to which even I was not privy. My throat then seized on me for a second, as though in wake of a coming sob. Then I thought, *Am I going to cry?*

 “So,” Ashley exhaled, examining her wristwatch, like there wasn’t a clock on her phone. “Where are we doing this little séance? At your apartment?”

“Uh, you see, we’re having renovations going on right now, dude, so the house isn’t any good. I figured it’s such a nice night out we could go do it on a park bench, picnic table, or even in a clearing in the woods, man. You know, Midnight Society style, hehehe.”

Jesus, why did I feel like I was going to start blubbering at any second? Reticent and woefully underwhelmed, she snapped her wristwatch up her forearm and checked the time again in one fluid motion.

“Look,” she said, “I’m not sure about all this now, okay? I’m really pressed for time, with assignments, upcoming exams, and all. Why don’t we just grab something at Timmies? I got to get headed back soon.”

“Headed back?” I bleated. “What? Why, man? You just got here. How long’s it been since you’ve back in the Koose, man? You know? Why do you want to go back so soon?” Feeling something wet on my upper lip, I hastened to brush it away. I observed the pearl of moisture undulating along my forefinger, relieved it wasn’t blood.

Ashley’s eyes danced, taking me in. In those eyes I saw myself reflected back: a minstrel stick-puppet of a shambolic junkie. Ash had led a charmed, nearly sheltered life. But she was no fool.

“Are you sure you’re okay, Carla? You seem…distracted.”

“Yeah,” I said, coming down, forcing myself to stick to one-word answers. Adjusting her purse strap, Ashley hummed a single low note. “You look like you’ve lost weight,” she said, softening. Searching for something to ease the tension.

I titled my head down and gave a sideways smile. I sure had lost weight. I’d made it a mission to stay small since grade eight. I wasn’t rich, popular, pretty, or book smart. The least I could do was be thin. In my kamikaze-binge drinking, drug-addled rut, being thin had been my one lonely health goal. Not hard to achieve, being a drug addict living on government assistance.

Ashley fished a Marlboro Light out of her purse and put fire to it. Her expression had turned wolfish. “Why is this so important to you?” she asked, holding her smoke between long rectangular fingers, like a model in a magazine ad. “Why don’t we just go to a bar or a club or something. Get our drink on.”

Examining the black laces on my Jawbreakers, I mumbled, “I wanted to do this last week. On Wednesday. Remember?”

“Why?” Ashley laughed, sending a blue cumulous my way. “What was so special about last Wednesday?”  

My jaw trembled. My fake lashes bedewed with tears. She’d forgotten. Perhaps she never knew. Ashley forced out a laugh.

“Jesus, Carla, what? What is it?”

“That’s the anniversary. That’s when Russell went missing.”

No longer smiling, Ashley blew another long blue cloud into the humid night air. Her face was otherwise unaltered – furrowed brow, same frown as before – but she looked suddenly contrite. Contrite and, for the first time that night, interested.

“That was six years ago, right?” she said. My spirits lifted a hair.

“Yeah, that’s right. You – you remembered.”

“Is that why you wanted to use the Ouija Board? To see if he’s still alive? Ask the spirit world for guidance on how to find him if he is? Contact him if he’s…well, you know.”

Still eyeing my leather boots, I shrugged one shoulder. All of the above.

I then felt her take me by the wrist, gently leading me down the street. “Come on, dude,” she crooned. “Let’s do this thing.”

“Hey,” I said, in faux protest, wiping away tears. “Where are you taking me?”  

“You said, it’s nice night, let’s do it out here. In fact, hell, let’s do it in the woods.”

“The woods?” I exclaimed, delighted.

“Come on,” she said, yanking me along.  

“But, the woods?” Still pulling my arm, she spun around, flashing that mischievous, effervescent grin I fell in love with when I first saw her at age ten.

“Carla, honey, if you’re going to have a midnight séance, you’ve got to do it right.”

The darkened woods were abuzz with life as we approached. Walking over the bridge to the conservation area, the echoing sounds from the creek coupled with the miry air made me nostalgic, recalling memories of Russell and me wading into the water, fishing for tadpoles.

Ashley and I turned the torches on our phones on and ambled into the fringe of tall grass and reeds, maneuvering around hogweed and Queen Ann’s lace. I giggled hearing Ashley shriek and seeing her brush wildly at her face – the universal gesture of one ensnared by errant gossamer. At the brook before the clearing, we both tried to bound over but ended up with our shoes wet and muddied, falling short. We laughed and cursed, not caring about our wet feet. Just like when we were kids.

At about the middle point in the forest, we found a dry flat clearing, and set up our crude camp site. I took the board out of my backpack, and, to my surprise, Ashley produced something of her own from out her purse. It was her planchet. I couldn’t quite see it in the dark, but it glistened in the torchlight, and was slick and heavy as if it were made of marble. I’d never seen anything like it before, though I had to admit it looked far better than the plastic heart-shaped planchet with the hole in it that came with the board I’d bought from Walmart. Ashley’s was shaped like a weaved basket – or a squamous snake coiling in on itself, and instead of a single hole it had a crystal bubble for its window in the centre. Carved into the serpentine grooves was what I had first thought to be the outline of a star. Much later, I would Google the shape, discovering the pattern to be that of a setogram.

“You got anything of Russell’s on you?” Ashley whispered. I could barely see her in the dark, let alone hear her over the chirping crickets.

“Uh, yeah, I do,” I said, surprising myself on remembering. I pulled my leather wallet out of the back pocket of my sausage-sleeve jeans and produced Russell’s favourite commemorative stamp. A five cent Mackenzie Bowell. I’d carried it everywhere since he’d vanished, perhaps in hopes that I could give it to him or use it to somehow entice him back home.

Again, I couldn’t read her expression, but detected a note of demurral in Ashley’s thoughtful hum. “That’ll probably work but – I meant do you have anything of him?” Mystified, I cocked my head back and said nothing. *Of him?*

“I meant something of his physical self,” she elaborated, either reading my silence or my thoughts. I then felt two slender digits remove the stamp from my thumb and index finger. I could just make out her placing the item on top of the squamous planchet, beside the crystal window. “Something bodily. Like hair or toenails.”

It was around this time that I started coming down from the glue fumes. Which wouldn’t be too much of a problem – other than putting me on edge – but my stomach had started to churn. And when Ashley said the word bodily, I felt the Ramen noodles I’d scarfed for lunch begin a steady campaign up my throat. “I-I don’t have anything like that,” I said, after swallowing the brackish bile. Why would I carry my brother’s toenails?

In the forest gloom, I could just make out Ashley’s wagging head.

“It’s fine,” she said.

“I mean, no promises, but if we go to my apartment…”

“No, it’s fine. This’ll work. Let’s just play.”

“Okay,” I sighed, relieved she’d shot down the offer to go to my apartment, me having proffered it just so she wouldn’t suggest it. Then, I thought of something. “Wait a tic, I know.” Ashley started from my sudden yelp and subsequent giggling. I was still a bit toasted after all, not fully in control of the volume of my voice.

“Use this!” I presented her with a strand of my own hair. Her eyes flashed, almost aglow in the dappling moonlight through the foliage.

“It has to be something of his,” she said reticently.

“So? He’s my brother. We’re the same blood, right? So this should work.” Science – like all other subjects – wasn’t my forte. Far from it. But what we were doing that night wasn’t exactly scientific.

It was with palpable trepidation that Ashley acquiesced in my suggestion and took the proffered strand, placing it beside the stamp on top the planchet.

We then began the ritual.

“Is there a presence here?” said Ashley. Her voice a slow somniferous purr.

I felt the planchet begin to drift to my left, Ashley and I facing each other, our fingertips pressed to the stamp and hair to keep them in place.

The smooth artery-shaped rock landed on YES. Beneath the bulbous crystal window, the letters appeared distorted and squiggly along the edges.

My heart hammered in my chest, my stomach flipped, and my scalp suddenly grew moist. I didn’t want to do this anymore. But I didn’t have the gumption to tell Ashley to stop. The planchet eased its way back to the centre of the board.

“I-I don’t know anymore, Ash,” I said, having worked up the nerve.

Ashley said nothing.

“I’m saying, I don’t like this, man. I think…” “Shhh!” Ashley hissed.

The planchet had started moving again.

My brow was beaded with sweat. We hadn’t asked it anything. It slid its way past the letters and over to the numbers. It stopped on the following digits, for one second each: 6-2-2-2-0-1-6, before retreating to the middle. I furrowed my brow, repeating the sequence in my head, racking my brain for its meaning. I tried crunching the numbers, adding them up, rearranging them. But perhaps, that was just me subconsciously denying what was clearly there; I wasn’t good at math, but I didn’t need Stephen Hawkins’s noodle to decode it, especially after seeing how ashen Ashley’s face had gone.

“Six, 22, 2016,” I proclaimed. “June 22nd, the year 2016. The day my brother went missing.” I was almost laughing. I was even elated. This was actually working.

Ashley then withdrew her hands from the planchet. “You’re probably right, let’s stop.”

“No, no,” I insisted, my crapulent symptoms subsiding beside the surge of adrenaline. “Let’s keep going.”

“Carla, please,”

“Do you know my brother Russell?” I blurted, ecstatic.

The planchet swung back over to YES.

“Is he alive?”

“Carla!”

With the complete lack of the sympathetic hesitation you’d see in humans, that bedside manner they talk about in hospital dramas, the planchet swung over to NO.

At first, I felt nothing. Just a cold, tingly sensation spreading from my collarbone around to my nape. That and the sudden tinnitus ringing in my left ear. Both the tinnitus and the tingling vanished when I met eyes with Ashley. Her look or delicate remorse, of a tacit, anguished apology just bifurcated me. Stripped me right to the bone. An alien wail tore itself free from my sweat-beaded lips, and my hands flew up to my face as though they belonged to someone else. The feeling of Ashley’s hand on my shoulder only elicited more sobs I couldn’t control. My cries died down, but only from the mucus choking me up. I had grown so oblivious to everything in my life, I was unaware of the raw hurt that lay dormant within me. It now came banshee-ing out with a piercing vengeance.

Then, I could sense something had changed in Ashley. Her hand stiffened on my shoulder and, it’s hard to explain, but her touch grew distant somehow. Icy. Before I knew that anything was wrong, she was standing over me, yanking at my sleeve, wrenching me to my feet.

“We have to go now,” she whispered, sibilantly. Her breath panted somehow. “Now, we need to go now.”

Befuddled, my face damp to the chin, I staggered vertical but dragged my feet along the pine chips and dirt as Ash shoved me toward the forest fringe from where we’d entered. “Go, go!” she hissed.  

“W-What about the board?” I asked, stumbling behind.

“Forget the board!” she insisted, the two of us now sprinting for the pathway out to the road.

The snap of a branch close by whirled me around. But all I found was darkness, and nothing else. The snapping branch, I’m sure, was just an echo from our retreat. There was nothing – no one else in that forest but us and the skeeters. Whatever Ash saw, or thought she saw, it wasn’t for my eyes.

We flew through the foliage, our clothes snagging on creeping thistle while reeds and branches smacked us in the face. I could just see the glow of a streetlight in the open road, before I plummeted into the sudden dip in the ground. I fell splashing into the brook, which fronted the forest like a moat, soaking my clothes in the two inches of water, my forearm smacking hard against the six-inch-high concrete wall. Despite my compromised state, I could feel Ash scrambling to her feet, pulling me along, resuming our flight from the unnamed danger.

“Ouch, Ash, please.” I curled my injured arm under my shoulder like a wing.

“Come on,” she urged, her face now visible in the weak amber light. “Almost there.”

Finally, we spilled out onto the pavement road, Ash turning to face the darkened forest, from which we’d come. Me just as baffled as when we’d started running. I fell on my butt on the asphalt, nursing my throbbing arm, hot tears striping my cheeks once again.

Then, I witnessed Ashley Greyson do something I would never forget. With great haste, she produced a long, slim, small object from her purse wrapped in brown butcher paper. She peeled away the wrapping, revealing a sprig purple flower on a thorny green stem. Around the milk thistle, I saw a stem of yew circling it just shy of the flower. Ash pricked her thumb on one of the thorns then held the wound over the blossom, turning it a reddish mauve.

My sight of her was then blurred as I reflexively screwed up my eyes and held my hand over my mouth, discovering a putrid odour had invaded my nostrils. It was fetid, metallic, and acrid, like a murder scene in a freshly painted room. Pinching my nostrils closed, I looked back at Ash and realized she was breathing with her mouth open. Whatever I was smelling had been there all along. Ash had smelled it first. Whether her faster olfactory perception was because of a keen supernatural insight, or due to my own senses being muddled by the glue, I’ll never know.

I then squinted and looked in the same direction as Ash, making out movement beyond the trees – black shapes shifting over black canvas. Thinking the glue and crank had finally driven me bats, I began sweating and panting when I heard an alien voice begin whispering inside my head. It wasn’t much of a relief when I looked up to discover it was actually coming from Ash, chanting something into the bloodied milk thistle in her fist. She was standing there, facing the footpath leading into the forest beyond the creek, eyes closed, muttering in this unknown language as though in fervent prayer. I’d hallucinated before while tripping, but never had I experienced anything this frightening. Or anything that felt this real.

My eyes darted back to the forest, to the spot where I thought I’d spied movement, realizing that what I’d seen hadn’t been movement at all. A tall, likely ten-foot figure, had materialized from the darkness, standing just visible in the street and moon light. I recoiled then pitched forward, forcing bile back down my burning esophagus. It was a truly hideous, grotesque figure standing just thirty feet from us, barely obscured by the shadow and vegetation. The thing looked like the anatomical model in a science classroom if it had been designed by a sadist. All the organs, tissue, and bones were visible, the creature degloved, and although it stood perfectly still, I could see the blood pulsate through every vein and orifice, glistening beyond the dark. It stood on bowed legs that bent at unnatural angles. Most bizarre was on the right side of the degloved torso, where an arm should have been, was the neck and head of a horse, likewise skinned. I thank God I was not close enough to see the eyes or the teeth of either head, though my inebriated brain drove me mad by filling in the blanks.

Despite my debilitating terror, I wondered after a few eternal seconds why the giant was just standing there, not advancing toward us. I then looked back at Ashley, still feverishly praying in tongues, then put two and two together. The degloved giant was being restrained, and she was the one keeping it at bay – like Gandalf in the Lord of the Rings movies. She wasn’t praying at all, but casting an incantation. Some sort of black magic.

Before the realization of what was going on drove me completely insane, the thing began to fade back into the darkness. It was like water down a drain. Or like switching the channel on TV. One moment it was there. The next, gone. As if it had never been.

I looked to Ashley and saw how pale she was. Whatever she had done had left her drained. A husk. I hadn’t been hallucinating. Whatever that giant anatomical model was, it had been cast out of the light by her bizarre murmuring. She had saved us both. Or so I thought.

My arm felt swollen but not as painful, so I stood. The two of us leaned on each other like boxers at the end of the ninth round, then hobbled our way through the brook trail to the bridge leading us out of the park. We limped our way to the nearest bus stop without speaking a word.
