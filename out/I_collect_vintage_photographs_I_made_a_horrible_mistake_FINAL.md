“Addy, for the love of God, move!”

  
For a moment, she didn’t move, rooted to the spot by a combination of shock and terror. Completely understandable, given that we were watching someone climb out of a fucking *photograph*. But then, as the man began to pull one of his legs through to place on the floor, she snapped out of it, stumbling to her feet as I pulled her down the hallway. Behind us, I heard the man’s cruel voice spill out of my office. “So, you were gonna either send me back or toss me in the dump, eh? You and me, we’re gonna have words about *that*, buddy!” He let out a laugh, one that sounded as insane and cruel as his smirk had looked.

  
And then we were turning into the kitchen. With each step, Addy found her feet, and began to run on her own. As she did, she turned to me, her eyes wide. “Jamie, what the *fuck* is going on?!” she screamed. “I’ll explain later!” I shouted back as I heard a crashing sound come from the hallway. As we passed by the door to the basement, the voice I’d heard on the way in came again. The woman’s voice. It was much louder now, as if she were shouting, but the door muffled her words and made them indistinguishable. I saw Addy shoot a shocked look at the door, but I was lunging for the door outside. Ripping it open, I grabbed her by the arm and pulled her outside. The rain had begun to fall, and droplets smashed into our faces as I led the way towards the Suburban in the driveway.

  
Tearing the driver’s door open, I pushed Addy towards it, hurrying her as I shot frantic glances over my shoulder. The open kitchen doorway remained empty for the moment, but I knew that wouldn’t last long. Hauling myself into the driver’s seat, I slammed the door shut and locked it before reaching for the ignition. *Shit!* The ignition slot was empty, the keys not there. “Addy, where’re the keys?!” I said, a small note of desperation entering my voice. Her face immediately paled. “I took them inside with me when I got home. I hung them up on the hooks in the front hall” Before I had a chance to let out any expletives at being so stupid as to not check, her face, if possible, went even paler. Her eyes widened as she stared out the windshield. “Oh, fuck” I spun around in my seat, my eyes finding what she’d seen.

  
“Ohhh, *fuck*”

  
The man was free from the picture. He stood in the doorway, staring out at us. The cruel smirk was still plastered on his face, and he’d replaced his hat on top of his head. For a moment, he simply stood there, seeming to drink in the moment. Then, he began to descend the stairs. *You gotta do something, man! You can’t stay in here, if he traps us in here, we’re dead!* For the first time in my life, I wished I hadn’t been the one of my friend group to stay out of trouble or keep out of illegal shit. Knowing how to hotwire a car would’ve come in handy in this moment. I turned to Addy. “We’ve gotta get back into the house and get the keys!” I exclaimed, looking back to see the man had halved the distance to us. Rain now dribbled down from the brim of his hat, obscuring his face. Lightning flashed for a moment, and a wave of horror fell over me as I saw the glint of the knife that he’d thrown at me in his hand. “But how are we gonna get back inside?!” Addy asked frantically. “We’re gonna jump out of the passenger door and make a run around to the front door. I never locked it. Then we grab the keys and make it back here. Once we do, we floor it!” I saw her nod, then pull back, gasping loudly.   


*Clink. Clink. Clink.*  


It was the sound of something tapping against the window. *Metal on glass*. “Reach behind you and unlock the door” I whispered as quietly as I could to her. The man’s voice, muffled behind the glass came from behind me. “Unlock the door, you two. You’ve got nowhere to go” I saw Addy slowly reach behind her, trying to keep her movements small enough to not be noticed. I refused to look behind me. The tapping came again. “It’ll be a lot easier on you two if you unlock the door. I get nasty when people don’t do as I tell them” A chill ran through me at the man’s words. *The psycho is literally telling us that he’ll kill us quickly if we unlock the door*. Then, barely audible over the tapping and the rain drumming on the roof of the truck, I heard the sound of the passenger door unlocking as Addy pulled up on it.  


“Fine, have it your way!”  


Two things happened simultaneously. The first was that behind me came the sound of shattering glass. I felt the shards smack into my back, along with the cold sting of pouring rain. The second was that I yelled. “GO!” Before the word was completely out of my mouth, Addy had already yanked on the door handle and leapt out into the night. I heard the man curse as he saw what we were doing, but I had already scooted across the bench seat and leapt out after her. “Run!” I shouted. But she didn’t need my encouragement. She was already dashing for the front of the house. Rain slashed my face as I fought to keep up with her. Behind me, I heard the *slam* of a car door and shot a look over my shoulder. A fresh surge of adrenaline filled me as I saw the man rounding the back of the Suburban. A murderous rage now filled the bit of his face I could see below the brim of his hat, and he walked quickly after us, almost in a run.  


I turned back, almost running into Addy’s back as she snatched the front step’s railing, hauling herself up as I pushed her to go quicker. A moment later, we flew through the front door, slamming it shut behind us and locking it. “Lock the side door!” I shouted as I ran to grab the car keys off their hook. I dashed behind her back into the kitchen in what felt like a horror movie version of Ring-Around-The-Rosie. But as I rounded the corner, I almost slammed into her back. I was about to ask her why she’d stopped when I saw why. *Shit!* The man stood near the bottom of the steps, looking in at us. He laughed. “You ain’t gettin’ out this way!” he declared, almost triumphantly. My mind raced, trying to figure out a plan. *If you go the other way, or try and run upstairs, he’ll be on you before you get twenty feet. You’ve gotta find a way to put a barrier between you and him!*   


As I fought to figure out what to do, I saw the man begin to ascend the stairs. We had less than ten seconds to do something. That was when the idea flashed through my mind. My eyes flickered to the basement door. The key still hung on the nail next to it. And the door could be locked from either side. I didn’t wait. I leapt towards the door, snatching the key from the hook and twisting the handle. The door flew open, revealing the dark steps downward. “Come on!” I yelled, reaching behind me for Addy. The man suddenly let out a roar of anger, hidden behind the open door. “Don’t you fucking *dare*!” Addy raced through the door and down the stairs as I yanked the door closed. Jamming the key into the lock, I fumbled for a second as I heard the rumble of running footsteps approaching the door. Then came the reassuring *click* of the door locking.  


Not a moment too soon, either. Before I’d even yanked the key from the lock, the door began to violently rattle on its hinges. Then it began to shudder as the man began to ram into it from the other side. “Get down the stairs” I hissed behind me. I heard Addy descend into the dark, and I followed after her quickly. *Okay, you bought yourself a little time, time to figure out what to do next*. For a few moments, we huddled together in the dark. I heard the rattle of Addy’s breathing as she fought to catch her breath. I heard a similar sound coming from my own mouth. And then I froze, feeling as rooted to the ground as a statue.  


Because I heard the soft sound of someone *else* breathing. Someone that wasn’t either of us.  


Addy stiffened in my arms, signaling she’d heard it at the same time I had. Above us, the pounding on the door continued, beginning to blend in with the drumming of the rain against the roof and windows. Neither of us dared say anything. For a few moments, the basement remained silent. And then a voice spoke out from the darkness a few feet in front of us. “Thank God you two managed to get away from him” Instantly, I recognized the British accent as the same one I’d heard the other night. *The woman*. I swallowed, managing to find my voice. “It’s you, isn’t it?” I said, meaning it more like a statement than a question. “Yes” came the reply, the voice seemingly filled with warmth and safety. “What the hell?” Addy managed out, her voice barely coming above a whisper. The woman’s voice came again. “Oh, my goodness, I am so stupid, she must be terrified hearing me right now. Hold on a moment and let me find the lights”  


A few seconds later, the basement lights flashed on, momentarily blinding us. As I blinked away the blue spots in front of my eyes, I heard Addy gasp and looked up.  


The woman stood at the bottom of the basement steps, having reached up to flick on the light switch. After standing there a moment, she stepped down, moving back into the center of the room. She looked exactly as she had when she’d been in her picture, wearing the white turtle-neck with the ornate belt around her waist above a pair of black slacks and high heels. Eyes as blue as the ocean looked over the two of us, and she smiled. For a split second, the same feeling I’d had in front of her picture before returned, and I almost felt like I was falling under a spell. Then she spoke again, snapping me out of it. “Hello, Jamie. It’s nice to finally be able to meet you” Her smile widened a little. Then, she looked over to Addy. “And you must be Addy”  


Before I could say anything, Addy spoke up. “Who the hell are you, and what the hell is going on right now? How are you able to climb out of your picture? And who the *fuck* is the psycho trying to break the door down up there?!” The woman raised her hands in a placating manner. “Easy, dear, easy. I’m not here to hurt you” She spared a quick glance up at the door, still rattling. “My name is Nadine, and I’ve been trapped in that picture by him for a long time” She let out a sigh, her head dropping as she looked at the ground. There was silence for a few moments. “For how long?” I asked. “Since 1955”, she replied, still looking at the ground as she picked at her belt, “I met him at a party at the Savoy Hotel in London. I was there to receive an award for my career as an up-and-coming actress when he approached me at the bar. I remember being charmed by him. He was so suave and debonair, seeming confident and a little bit of a bad boy. And he made me laugh. All the things I can’t resist in a man”  


She looked up again, and I could see the pain in her eyes as she continued. “My husband had just left me for another woman, and I was vulnerable. He could tell that and took advantage of it. The next thing I know, we’re in a room in the hotel in the throes of passion. For a moment, I thought I might’ve found someone new. Someone I could move on with. But I didn’t know what he had planned for me” Her voice choked off, and I saw tears begin to fall from her eyes. She wiped them away with the back of her hand. Addy spoke up again. “So he trapped you in that picture?” she asked. Nadine nodded. “The same night. When I tried to return to the award party. He started saying these strange words in another language, one I’d never heard before. The next thing I knew, I was trapped inside a picture, forced to stare out and smile. But inside, I was screaming. Especially when my friends came in looking for me. They even turned and saw me in the picture, making a comment about how they were surprised the hotel had already put up a portrait of me”  


She sniffed again. “I’ve spent what feels like an eternity staring out of that prison”, she motioned to the now empty picture behind her, “Watching the world pass by, seeing the people I loved grow old and die. And then be moved around the world, boxed up in the dark and be presented by others. It was only a few decades ago I found I could move, even leave the picture temporarily. But I could never truly escape. Because *he* sealed himself in a picture as well. The two of us were always sold together, as a collection. So he could stay close to his prisoner. His prize. As long as he exists, I remain trapped”  


A mixture of sympathy and horror flooded through me as I pictured what she must’ve endured for what was close to 70 years. *Watching everyone she knew grow old and pass, watch the world she knew fade away and be replaced. Wanting to scream, but never being able to. And always being glared at by that…evil man.* I heard Addy let out a gasp. “Nadine…I’m so sorry” she managed out, sounding on the verge of tears herself. Nadine looked as though she were about to speak when the biggest crash against the basement door came, along with the sound of splintering wood. All three of us swung our gazes up the stairs, seeing the door now beginning to buckle under the weight of the attacks.  


She turned back to us, pointing behind us. “You two need to get out of her while you still can” I turned and mentally smacked my head as I realized I’d forgotten all about the storm doors to the backyard. I turned back to her. “But what about you?” Another pained expression crossed her face. “My fate has already been made. Yours hasn’t. You still have a chance to make it out of this” She took a few steps forward until she stood directly in front of us. The smell of her perfume again filled my nostrils as she reached out and stroked my cheek. Then she looked at Addy. “You’re a truly lucky woman to have such a wonderful man by your side, dear. I envy you. Don’t ever take him for granted” She turned away. “Now go”  


I stood, unsure about what to do as I heard the basement door splinter again. The man’s muffled shouts filtered down to us. But, surprisingly, it wasn’t me who spoke first. It was Addy. “Jamie, we can’t leave her like this” she whispered to me, her face a clear portrait of remorse for Nadine’s situation. “What the hell can we do, though?”, I asked her, “We’re about a minute from ending up on the sharp end of the mobster’s knife, and I don’t-“ I stopped, mid-sentence as something swam forward in my head. The words that Justin had told me. *The only way to break the curse is to destroy the picture and frame its in*. “Addy, I know how to do it!” I exclaimed. Nadine turned to look at me, and I could see she’d been silently crying. “Do what?” she asked. “Break the curse and free you! My friend who knows about this kind of occult magic told me. If I destroy the empty picture and frame, it’ll destroy him! And that will set you free!”  


Addy tightened her grip on my arm. “Jamie, are you sure you’re right?” I looked down at her and shrugged. “I honestly don’t know. But it’s the best chance we’ve got, not only at surviving this, but helping her” I pointed to Nadine, who began to open her mouth to protest. But Addy spoke up. “Nadine, *don’t* argue, we’re helping you if we can” The blue eyes began to water over with tears again, this time of relief and happiness instead of sadness. “We need to find a way to get around him and get to the picture. Then destroy it” I said. A light seemed to flash in Addy’s eyes. “I have an idea on how to destroy it!” she said. “Okay, then I’ll be the one to try and distract him” I volunteered. A look of worry flashed in Nadine’s eyes. “Jamie, he’s dangerous, you *have* to be careful. One wrong move and he’ll gut you where you stand” Her words sent a chill up my spine, but I did my best to force it away. “Then we’ll have to make sure that doesn’t happen, do we?” She hesitated, then nodded. “Addy, get out the storm door and make your way around and inside. Do what you need to do. I’ll keep him off you”  


Hands grabbed my face, and I was pulled downward. Addy pressed her lips to mine in a quick, passionate embrace. “Don’t you dare get dead on me” she demanded, her face set in a look of determination. I nodded at her, then jerked my head at the storm doors. “Now, go!” She didn’t say another word, turning and running for the steps. There was a squeak, and suddenly the sounding of the pouring rain became deafening. Then they shut again.  


A split second later, the basement door didn’t just break down. It *disintegrated*.   


I ran to Nadine’s side, looking up and trying to will myself to be brave. But all I felt as I looked up the stairs was terrified out of my wits. The man’s silhouette was framed in the doorway as he glared down at us. “I see you’ve been talking with the harlot here, haven’t you?” he snarled as he took a step down. Nadine suddenly spoke up. “Leave him alone, you bloody spiv!” she yelled. The man laughed, the boom of it seeming to rattle the windows. “You’d like that, wouldn’t you, Nadine?” he asked, smirking cruelly at her. He looked back at me. “What’s she been telling you, I wonder?” The knife glinted in the light over him, the blade looking sharp and wicked as he flashed it at me.  


Suddenly, Nadine turned and pushed me with more strength than I imagined she’d have. “Run, Jamie!” she screamed. I didn’t need to be told twice. I turned and bolted for the storm doors. Behind me, I heard an explosion of movement as the man gave pursuit. “Get back here, you little shit! We’re not done talking yet!” he yelled. But I’d already reached the doors, pushing up on them. They flung open into the night, and I began to race up when a stabbing pain surged through my leg. I yelled as I fell half out into the mud and water that had become the backyard. Turning to look back, I saw immediately what had happened. Blood flowed out of a large slash in the back of my right calf, dripping down onto the stone steps.  


The look of insane rage and cruel satisfaction that adorned the man’s face as he moved up after me, along with the sight of my own blood dripping from the knife’s blade is something I’ll never forget.  
I screamed, adrenaline flooding my system once more as I lashed out with my uninjured leg. For a moment, I was terrified that my foot would simply pass through him like he was air. But to my relief, it didn’t. I felt my boot connect solidly with the man’s nose, felt it crack and break under my weight. He let out a shout of pain and tumbled backwards down the stairs. I staggered to my feet, terrified at how close I’d come to dying and looked down into the basement. The man was struggling to get to his feet. “That’s *it*, you impetulant little fuck! I’m *done* playing nice!” he screamed. Behind him, I suddenly saw movement as Nadine flung herself at him, wrapping her arms around his neck. “Run!” she screamed again at me as the man attempted to throw her off.  


I took the moment of distraction and half-ran, half limped away through the backyard. The back of the garage came into view, and I rounded the side of the house as I heard the man roar in rage, almost inhuman in its intensity. The terror it filled me with provided me with the energy to stagger around to the still open kitchen door. Flying up the steps, I entered the kitchen and shouted. “Addy, where are you?!” A call came from back near the living room, and I moved towards the door to it. “Hurry, Jamie!” came Nadine’s voice from the open basement door. I spared a glance down it as I passed, catching a glimpse of her terrified face looking up at me. A large welt had been dealt to the side of her face, and I felt a surge of rage well up inside me at the sight of it.   


“You’re not getting away from me again, Jamie!” thundered the man from behind me. I felt the house shake as he entered the kitchen again. But I was already entering the living room, seeing Addy standing by the fireplace holding the empty picture. The flames still roared inside of it, letting out loud pops and crackles. “YES!” I shouted, gesturing to the fireplace. But as the words left my lips, horror suddenly filled every fiber of my being as I saw a hand fly from the doorway behind Addy, grabbing her by the scruff of the neck. “Oh, no you *don’t*, you dumb bitch! You have no idea what you’re doing!” Addy screamed, dropping the picture as she was yanked back. “*ADDY!*” I screamed, horrified I’d see the man drag the knife across her throat before I could reach her.  


The picture crashed to the floor, the glass spider-webbing and smashing. The man suddenly let go of Addy, who collapsed to the floor in a heap as he let out a high-pitched scream of pain. For a microsecond, I stared, then realized what had happened. *She dropped the picture, and when the glass broke, it hurt him! What Justin said IS true!* A new wave of determination filled me as I saw Addy look up at me from the ground. “Destroy it, Jamie!” she screamed as I saw the man begin to enter the living room. I staggered forward and snatched up the picture as he turned to look at me. I raised the picture over my head, seeing the look of rage give way to one of panic and horror. He dropped the knife, raising his hands in almost a pleading manner. But I wasn’t waiting to hear what he had to say.  


“Go to hell, you piece of *shit*!” I shouted at him, bringing the frame down as hard as I could on the stone around the fireplace.  


The ornate frame splintered and smashed, shattering into many pieces that fell to the floor. The man suddenly doubled over, letting out another scream of pain. The picture began to flutter to the ground and I snatched it out of the air, turning to look into the flames. “NO!” I heard the man scream behind me. I felt a meaty hand brush against the back of my neck. But I’d already thrown the picture, along with remnants of the frame into the fire. As soon as the flames touched them, he let out the most horrid, painful scream I’ve ever heard in my life come from behind me. I whirled around to a sight I’ll never be able to forget; that of him standing there, screaming as flames seemed to leap up from nowhere and cover him. They didn’t seem to transfer from his body to the carpet, only sticking to his body.  


I dashed for Addy, dropping down next to her and gathering her in my arms as we watched in horror, unable to look away as the man who’d tried to kill us burned. Until he fell to the floor, the flames growing larger and consuming him. A few moments later, they went out, leaving no trace of them or the man on the floor.  


The two of us sat there, staring at the now empty floor for a few minutes and breathing deeply before Addy spoke. “Is…is it over?” she asked weakly, rubbing the back of her neck where she’d been grabbed. I let out a shaky breath. “I think so” I said, swallowing and putting my face in my hands. Suddenly, I felt her stiffen against me. “*Nadine!*” she exclaimed. I looked up, realization filling me as well. I got to my feet, picking her up and guiding her to the couch. “Wait here, I’m gonna go check”  


She slumped onto the couch, looking up at me and nodding before rubbing her hands over her face. I turned and limped through the living room into the kitchen, approaching the basement door. “Nadine!” There was no answer, and I moved the basement door, looking down. No one approached the base of the stairs. “Nadine, we did it!” I called. There was still no answer. *What happened? Did she….did she move on or something?* I called out one final time, this time softer. “…Nadine?”  


The scent of perfume suddenly filled my nostrils, and I became aware of someone standing almost directly behind me. “Thank you, Jamie” came her voice from just behind my left shoulder. A smile began to spread across my face, and I opened my mouth to reply when she continued. “Thank you ever so much, darling. I’ve been trying to get rid of him for far too long now” My mouth snapped shut as I heard the tone in her voice change. There was still a trace of the warmth in it, but it was almost masked behind…what I could only describe as *coldness*. *What the…* “Thanks to you, now I’m free”  


A chill ran up my spine as the feelings of fear and horror began to return, along with a new emotion: dread. I slowly began to turn to look at her when I felt something smash into the back of my skull. I fell to my knees, darkness rapidly filling my vision. In the distance, growing fainter, I heard Addy call my name. Then I heard her scream.  


The last thing I heard before falling unconscious was Nadine say one final thing. “For the record, Jamie darling, I *do* truly like you. And I *don’t* share the men I like”  


When I woke up, it was to blinding sunlight filtering in through the open kitchen door. The back of my head throbbed with pain, and I felt a large bump as I reached a hand back to rub it. For a moment, nothing came to my brain. And then, everything that had happened smashed into me. I scrambled to my feet, looking around. I was alone in the kitchen. “Addy?!” I shouted, praying that I would get a response.  


Nobody answered my call.  


Horror and dread like I’d never felt surged through me as I ran through the house screaming my girlfriend’s name. But I found no trace of her at all. As I entered the kitchen again, I glanced out the open door. My Suburban was gone, the driveway empty. *Wait a minute…who took the truck…Addy or…* Another thought flashed into my head, and I suddenly turned and bolted down the basement steps. “NADINE!” I screamed out, my voice filled with a mixture of fear and anger. I reached the bottom of the stairs and looked around.  


“NADI-“  


The word died in my throat as my eyes locked on the empty picture across from me. Well…not *entirely* empty, anymore. There were two new things that occupied it now. A scream of horror bubbled up in my throat as I saw the bloody handprint smearing down on the far wall. And just below it, right at the edge of the picture, was a hand and arm that lay palm up on the floor. One that I knew intimately well.   


Tears flowed freely from my eyes as I stared at Addy’s bloody arm, the rest of her body stretching out of sight of the area the picture captured. I reached out, hoping I’d meld into it, be able to reach in and pull her out. But my hands simply touched solid glass. For a time, I stood there, crying. Then I turned and dashed back upstairs, racing around until I found my cell phone in the office hallway where I’d dropped it. I snatched it up, flicking open the screen. I didn’t know who I planned to call, whether it was Justin or the police. I’ll never know, because my eyes were drawn to the deluge of email notifications that filled my screen. They were all from eBay. All from a user I didn’t recognize. And they’d all been sent in the last eight hours.  


My shaking fingers tapped the newest message, and the eBay app opened to it. It was a private message titled *RE: The pictures you purchased, urgent, READ NOW!* My eyes flickered over the message written to me. A new sense of dread began to fill me as I re-read the message, then opened the next. It was the same. I felt my heart begin to thunder in my chest and my breath grow ragged. And then I was dashing out the door, limping for the garage where my motorcycle sat.  


That morning was two days ago now. My fingers are beginning to shake as I type this out remembering the words that had been sent to me.  


*Look, I’ve been trying to get ahold of you for the last few days. I don’t know if you’re ignoring them or simply not getting them, but you need to read this. What I’m about to tell you might sound insane, but it’s true. The pictures you bought? I used to own them. My brother ended up selling them months ago without my knowing. He hated them, but he didn’t know why I held onto them despite everyone’s protests. The two people in the pictures, the woman and the man? They’re not just pictures. The people in them can actually move around and climb out of them. I found it out a few weeks after buying them myself, hearing voices and coming downstairs to find them out.*  


*I don’t have time to fully explain, but I need to warn you before it’s too late. The woman, Nadine? She’s not to be trusted. She’ll tell you that the man trapped her in the picture and is keeping her there. She’s half telling the truth. The man IS keeping her trapped in her picture. But that’s because she’s dangerous. I don’t know what she is, a demon, a witch. But she’s evil beyond measure. She’s able to seduce and entrance any man that comes her way. The man was part of an order dedicated to hunting down and trapping people and things like her. He sacrificed a piece of his soul half a century ago to entrust she remains trapped in that picture for eternity. He may be rough, but listen to him! He’ll tell you how to stay safe! Just don’t cross him! If he thinks you’re trying to free her, he will attack you!*  


*Do not believe any of Nadine’s words. She was an actress in her old life, she knows how to fake emotions to get what she wants. And what she wants is to be free. She wants to be able to spread her evil across the world again. She has powers beyond your imagination.*  


*And whatever you do, for God’s sake don’t get her attention. She’ll let you live if she truly likes you. But if she does, and you have a girlfriend or wife? She’ll kill them to have you to herself.*  


*Message me back as soon as possible, I’d like to buy them back from you, to keep people safe from them, from her!*  


That email will haunt me for the rest of my life. What have I done…? What have I unknowingly unleashed upon the world? I don’t know what to do, if there’s anything I can do. I can’t call the police. What would I tell them? That a woman crawled out of a picture, murdered my girlfriend and stuffed her body into the picture she’d been trapped in before escaping? I’d be institutionalized in a heartbeat.  


I am so sorry. I am so, *so* sorry to everyone. To Addy…*Oh, God, Addy*…I thought I was doing the right thing, I thought I was helping someone.   


I’m terrified now. Terrified that Nadine may come back at any time. Terrified of what she’ll say. What she’ll do, regardless of whether she likes me or not. Terrified the most that she’ll be able to entrance and seduce me fully under her spell, like she was already able to do before. That she’ll make me forget about Addy and everything else.   


But, beyond that, I’m most terrified of what she’s doing in the world now. What she’s planning. And that’s why I’ve written this, to warn all of you while I still can. Regardless of whether you believe me of not. If you’re out and about, and you happen to see a stunningly beautiful woman with blonde hair and ocean blue eyes? Whether she’s still dressed in the 1950s clothing she had on that night, or has changed her outfit and hair to blend into the modern world? If you see her, smell her perfume and feel entranced by her eyes and smile? Run. Run, while you still can.  


Especially because of one thing. One horrifying thing that chills my blood with the implications. Nadine has many powers, as the man in the email said. And one of them makes me want to scream uncontrollably when I think about what I found at my gallery, the door hanging open and swinging in the breeze.  


*All* of the pictures on the walls were empty.
