I was 19 at the time so a few years ago or so. Time was November. The end of November, the exact day I have forgotten. I was living in the prairies. So this area hardly gets snow. Just dry cold . I was really in a dark time and I decided get into witch craft more. Me just breaking with my short term relationship, either way, still heart broken and sad. I decide to call upon hekate. The ritual was simple, at midnight sharp walk up the crossroad bring apple cheese, and hold a burning tea candle and leave suggest items in the of the crossroads. Say hekate name till you feel her energy around you, when you feel this walk away from the crossroad and never look back. I did so but the only thing is I didn’t feel hekate, but something else. I wasn’t scared. It felt like time almost stopped. I lost time I’m not sure how long I was there . I felt a warm hand touch my shoulder. I paused my chant calling hekate. I decide to walk away and never turn back. In my head over and over. I told myself don’t look back, don’t look back. Even when I had a urge to. I get to my family member acreage, which was only a short walk away. Open the door and closed it and laid on the couch. Trying to figure out what happen. I again lost time with in my own thoughts. The next thing I know I realized I spent hours and now it was 3am. I hear 3 loud knocks on the front door. KNOCK. Knock. KNOCK. It almost echoed in the empty house. It made my heart stopped. I gained my focus and my reins back. I walked to the porch and looked out the window. 

I blinked and rubbed my eyes. no one was on the deck. I started scanning the tree line. I see a man slowly walking down the dirt gravel road towards the crossroads. He was walk slow enough for almost making sure  I would see him. He was wearing nice fitted suit, a hat, leather boots. I could not see any race. Weather this man was Caucasian, Asian, African. It was a dark shadowed silhouette. Just grey shadow. One of the most haunting part that still haunts me, he turned to look at me and I could see empty hollowed eyes. No emotion, no spark, his eyes were just there. Empty. Funny part my brain didn’t keep the memory what he looked like . Just his eyes. He turned his head directed his pointing his head to follow him back. You could hear by his body language say, ‘follow me.’ Me looking the window watching this. I decided to bed.  The dreams the most interesting. I dreamt of a woman. On top of me. Braid up and fair skinned. Smelling my neck.dragging her long black hair from my forehead down to my toes. Me As a young woman this gotten questioning women or not. Cause it intrigued me. Then boom, she was gone. Hekate did not want to work with me. I’m not bothered by it. That’s ok.

So fast forwards. My world was shaken up. My friend died . Day of furneral, I got kicked out of my families home. I found out their true intentions. I know it’s vague cause I have give less details to keep this as anonymous as possible. Anyways  . moved a couple big cities. Now I’m here. You know the werid dreams? Well it started happening again.

My dreams the last few nights the  same. There that man at the crossroad holding a piece of paper. Saying in a deep emotions less voice. ‘Let’s make a deal.’ Then I wake up. Look at my phone. Check the time. ‘3am’. Ever single . night.
I had a realization the man is. The same man that Robert Johnson made a deal with. The dealer himself.

You Proably wondering and have lots of questions. I do for sure . trust me. I have seen doctors , reiki healers . Doctor like serval doctors found nothing and the reiki healer found some interesting things.  


You probably  wondering what I’ll next. Sit back . Wait and see . Hold your breath. Don’t hold your breath. Future is unclear. Question is what would you do? If you had a chance with the man himself.
