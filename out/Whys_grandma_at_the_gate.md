I live in a fairly safe neighborhood in a not so safe country if you know what I mean. I reside in a street that’s lined with houses that are blocked around/ private and everyone more or less knows everyone in there but of course we’re always vigilant because you can never tell when you might be unlucky . 

I live about a quarter mile in , my house right after a bridge next to a deep river (that you can’t really cross) and on the other side miles of tall grass. 
I live with 7 other people in the household. 
Every night we ensure we lock the main front gate & activate the security cameras. We also have staircases leading to the front and back entrances of the second floor that’s burglar proofed & secured by even more gates . The remaining perimeter of the property  is blocked off with high concrete walls adjoining the roof leaving no space for any sizable creature to crawl through.

This particular night the entire family was out. They had gone to a wake of a close family friend. I was home alone because I’m 26 and needed an early night’s rest for work the following day. It was just after 8pm I locked up & went to shower. I usually play music while doing so but a few minutes into my routine I could’ve sworn I heard a faint knock coming from my front door. 
At this I quickly jumped out , turned off the music & stood in silence. Feelings of confusion and panic were creeping in because I was 100% sure everything was locked , the gates the doors plus I had the keys inside the house. A few drawn out moments passed when I heard it again but this time it came from my bedroom window that’s on the second floor with no ledge to stand on , on the opposite side of the house . I  checked the cameras and saw that there was no one at any of the windows or entrances and it showed no one entered any time into the property. 

My logical mind brushed it off as maybe a huge bug or something but I wasn’t convinced. I got dressed and as soon as I walked back into the living room, I heard the padlock on the main front gate being tampered with. 
This padlock is inside and you basically have to shove your hand in an awkward position through narrow metal bars to even reach it. I hurriedly checked through a window that gave direct sight to the main gate & what I saw made my knees buckle. 

Standing outside my gate, in the darkness of the night faintly aglow by the dimming street light was my grandmother. She was in one of her homemade dresses she had sewn and her head was covered with a white translucent shawl that obscured part of her face. 

Now you’re probably thinking - dude go open the gate for your grandma. Well only one problem with that - she’s been dead for 14 years AND was CREMATED. 

I blinked a million times trying to blame exhaustion from work for what I was seeing but somehow whatever that stood there taking the form of my poor grandmother had caught sight of me looking through the window . It slowly raised its hand and waved awkwardly and beckoned me to come open the gate without saying a word. 

Immediately I called my mom and explained what was going on. Thankfully she didn’t doubt me because she had also experienced strange things along with my other relatives in this street. 
I looked out after making the call and saw that the figure was gone. 
Within 20 minutes my mom and other relatives arrived home. 

They did a thorough search and found no one on the property. What’s even weirder was that the security camera footage showed no one was standing at the gate during the time I was experiencing this. 
My older cousin decided to do one last check around the house outside this time and in some tall overgrown bushes a few feet from the property he found a white shawl - except this one had many holes and was tinged with dirt as if it had been buried under the earth for years. 

This happened a month ago & since then I’ve never stayed home at night alone.
