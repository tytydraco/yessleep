For the story being too long i'll post the parts in the comments.

Part 1/

This story isn't about me, it's about my stepsister, who I consider to be my sister. As the events took place during my childhood and teenage years, some details may be distorted, and it's not just because of my age, but because I've also been having some memory problems lately, even though I'm 18. And maybe Celene doesn't want me to share this story as she doesn't want to be found out, but I have to do it, I have to find her, even if she finds me first.

According to all the information I have, her mother had cancer and was cruelly abandoned by her husband who had a mistress, the mistress was my mother. Celene was only 9 years old at the time, so she hated her father, and rightly so, for leaving her mother.
As Celene's father didn't like his daughter, he only paid alimony to her mother and didn't even want to see the girl. After a while her mother died in hospital, and as Celene's grandmother had Alzheimer's and was in a nursing home, she had to stay with my stepfather, and that's when things started. 

I was six years old at the time, but I remember very well the way she was greeted, the look on my stepfather's face, who wasn't at all happy to have Celene in the house, and neither was my mother, but it was different with me, I was happy because I was finally going to have someone to play with. Then, as the days went by, we got used to Celene being there.

I forgot to tell you, but Celene had some peculiarities. I remember once we were both playing hide and seek in the park, when suddenly I couldn't find Celene, and when I did, she was on a branch high up in a tree.

"How... how did you get up there?"

I asked, and then she simply jumped off the branch and fell slowly as if she were floating until her feet touched the ground and she stared at me with her same empty face as always.

I was stunned by the scene, but although it was bizarre, for a child it was very cool, so Celene began to levitate some leaves and make a whirlwind around us. It was impressive, but as I was a bit innocent and Celene was too, I told my stepfather what had happened in the park later, when we were already at home, and Celene was beaten up.

I didn't understand why, but he explained that Celene was cursed by the devil and that she couldn't use her powers, given to her by Satan. My stepfather was extremely religious and treated Celene as if she were a criminal while she lived there.

For example, Celene couldn't play with the other children, because every time she was happy something supernatural happened in the house. Celene also had to sleep alone because her bed and the objects around it were dragged by themselves, and sometimes she hovered over the bed while she slept. And because of my stepfather's faith, he was always forcing her to go to church, so that maybe they could 'cure' Celene.

At school she was bullied by everyone for being strange, she had a very quiet manner and didn't socialize with any kid. She didn't even bother to brush her hair. Her manner was probably what got the bullies going, she was inexpressive and hardly even blinked, like a doll, only abandoned. The teachers didn't like her because she had a hard time learning no matter how hard she tried. 

This was the case with class lessons, because things related to her interests she learned with unbelievable ease. She would get beaten up at home because, in my stepfather's mind, she had no interest in learning and would never make it in life. I'd already mentioned to my stepfather that she might be autistic or ADHD, but he said it was all a load of hooey. And that Celene had nothing wrong.

Well, back to Celene's school life, which was very difficult, especially socially, she had been expelled from a couple of schools. The first time, the complaint was that Celene had thrown a chair at two girls, seriously injuring them. The second time she twisted a boy's arm.

That's what they said, but it was obviously Celene's powers at work, mixed with her anger, since Celene was very calm and didn't like conflict, she would never do it consciously.

As she grew up, she was treated more and more inhumanly, to the point where she only went around poorly dressed in clothes that were given to her and many of these clothes were mine or my mother's, but they were always old, they didn't even like to hear her talk, and all she did all day was clean the house until night, since they didn't want her to study for the exam she was interested in. In their minds, she didn't deserve to be anyone, because her soul belonged to the devil.

I couldn't even play with her, and I always thought it was very unfair the way she was treated, so whenever I could, I would clean something or keep the house as clean as I could since I couldn't help Celene in any way. 

I didn't understand why they treated her so inhumanely, but according to my parents Celene deserved all that, and she was also more normal when she was treated like that. And the worst thing was that I had noticed that the paranormal activity in the house had decreased.

However, some very bizarre things started to happen, like one night when I was getting ready for bed, and my bed was dragged out of nowhere, from one wall of the room to the other, right in front of me, I held back as long as I could not to scream, not to alert my parents, because I knew there was no poltergeist in the house, apart from Celene.
