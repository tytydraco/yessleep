Learning to deal with schizophrenia is like being born into this world again. Having your entire personality and mannerisms change without knowing why was terrifying for me. Like taking the first steps as a toddler, or saying your first word as an infant, you don’t know how to handle it, you just have to. I used to be so outgoing, so friendly, incredibly motivated in life. Somehow all of my effort in bettering myself and creating the life I wanted ended with me walking down a freeway completely nude saying “ my clothes were on fire.” and “ the burned men are hunting me.”

It started with me slowly withdrawing from my friends and my family. Normal activities I would do with Korbin and Brian became forced and irritating. We were in our senior year of high school and being the “ teenage rebellious “ types we were, we decided to try using acid. It felt amazing, the warm and tingly feeling in my chest, how my arms seemed to have after images, how happy I felt. This became our norm, every weekend we would go to Korbin’s house and get high in the shed adjacent to his garage. It was a great year, the last year I felt truly happy. 

I know LSD use isn’t directly correlated to causing schizophrenia, but I had the gene so it sure didn’t help. I believe this is where it all started. What led me to be on that freeway, what led me to withdraw from my family. What pushed away Korbin and Brian.  I’m learning to live with it now. 

After high school I started renting my own apartment to go to college. I was getting my bachelor’s in business just like every 18 year old male that “ wants to work for himself “, but actually just wants to party. I might have started to distance myself from my loved ones, but the drugs and alcohol made me feel numb. After a long night of partying I would come home to my one bedroom and knock out almost immediately. 

I can’t remember when it started, but as I lay in bed some nights, I began to hear voices coming from the attic access in my closet. They were always low and saying how terrible I was doing in life. They began to keep me up at night. I laid awake and listened as the room spun to them whispering “ you can’t run from them. “ and “ they’re coming for you, you’re too late.”

I became paranoid of everyone around me not knowing what or who was coming after me, completely buying into the idea that people were coming for me. One night, as I lay awake listening to these voices whisper to me, I decided enough was enough. I got up and barged out of my room to get away from what they were saying. As I was walking away they told me my skin was sloughing off of my bones and I started to feel what they were saying. They would say my eyes were on fire and I would feel like my corneas were melting out of my eye socket. They told me my tendons were being ripped out, and I felt like each nerve was being individually plucked from my body. 

 I stripped naked to try and minimize the fire from spreading to the rest of my body and immediately ran out to look for help. Anyone, anything could've help me. Tears ran down my face as the voices said the burned men were close behind me ready to make me their own. I hadn’t seen them yet, but I was petrified of whatever awaited me when they caught up. 

I didn’t make it far before someone called the police on me. I would’ve called too seeing a naked white man running toward the freeway at 2 A.M. screaming that he was on fire. I was arrested and booked into the jail. As I sat in my cell and calmed down the night passed. I was transported to a hospital nearby early that morning and was held in a mental institution for the last 2 months. My parents covered my rent while I was in the institution and came to visit my once in awhile. My mother was very considerate and caring, worrying about her baby boy. My father not so much, he was very standoffish and hardly could look me in the eye. Even so, this was usually the high light of my week as it gave me a break from all the muffled screaming and constant observation from the nurses and doctors.  

This is the point I was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. 

I learned a lot about myself while in the hospital, therapy everyday usually does that to a person. I was put on medication to help with my condition, and taught coping techniques when I would begin to have visual and auditory hallucinations. I was taught to notice words and ideas to pick up on in conversation, little anchors to confirm what was real. The one that’s helped me the most is simple: using my phone camera. When you look through the lens of a camera, the world is clear. No hallucinations can deceive me if they don’t appear on my phone screen. There have already been a few times I’ve been going on a nightly walk, talking to someone that wasn't ever real. I only knew because they started to say some of the same things the voices in the attic would say. That and when I pulled my phone out to start recording them, no one was there. 


I was released last week and have been living in my apartment again. My parents visit me at least once a day and I have been doing better.

 Learning to live with this has been a struggle I wasn’t ready to face. The antipsychotic medication they put me on helps, but doesn't take anything away. The doctor said that with time it will help more. 

Sometimes at night I hear the voices still, quieter than before, but nonetheless still there. The medicine must be working at least some. I can’t even tell what they're saying just muffled whispers in the dark. The whispers are paired with scratching and rustling, which is new. 

Dr. Jones said my hallucinations may change before they get better and I learn to calm myself. For the first time in whats felt like years, I want to see my friends again. 

Early this morning, I called Brian and asked if he and Korbin wanted to come hang out at my place. Hesitantly, they both agreed and said they would head over shortly. This was the first time since the incident that I would be seeing them. My anxiety spiked and I started sweating. 

What if they hated me now? 

What if they couldn’t associate with me anymore?

 I know that my story had spread around the campus like a wildfire, but Korbin and Brian didn’t care right? They were my friends. Maybe they used to be. Maybe they couldn't see past the stigma and misconceptions that schizophrenia brings. 

I could barely breathe, sitting on my couch, my chest getting tighter. It felt like the room around me was spinning and the walls were closing in on me. Just as I began to call Brian to tell them not to come anymore because I wasn’t feeling well, there was a knock at the door. 

I froze, my heart beating like a drum. 

I got up to answer the door, worry and fear washed over me. I reached for the door handle, my hands trembling, and pulled. 

I was greeted with my two best friends smiling at me. “ Hey Noah “ Korbin said smiling. I gave a weak smile as the anxiety started to dissipate and said “ Hey guys… come on in “.

We gathered in the living room to start catching up. The smile faded from both their faces as they saw the dried tear lines on my face. The mood shifted. As soon as I noticed their expressions change, the anxiety I had before reared its’ ugly head. Thinking that they were going to judge and berate me with questions, my mind raced. All I could think about was how alone I would be again after they left me because of how pitiful i was.

 I felt a gentle hand wrap around me and lay on my shoulder. Brian spoke, “ Noah it’s okay man we’re here for you. What’s happened hasn’t changed anything. “ As if he had known exactly what I was thinking. 

Korbin spoke “ Yeah dude, don’t worry about it. I’d be scared if my body was on fire too “. 
Brian shushed him angrily. I started to smile. Korbin had always been inconsiderate. It felt natural being with them again. It felt like home. 

We sat in the living room for hours as Brian told me about the new job he started and Korbin told me about the new woman he had started talking to from a dating app. Korbin wasn’t considerate, sure, but he was also very gullible, the woman was very obviously A.I. generated and kept asking him to send her money. 

Brian whispered to me “ Look man he seems to be in love and I don't want to break it to him, just let it pass as long as he doesn't actually start sending her money “. 

I chuckled and agreed. 

The rest of the conversation was filled with probing questions about the mental institution and how this new found illness has made me feel. I answered their questions to the best of my ability, I haven’t been very great at describing what it’s like to anyone, I found that out through therapy. 

Toward the end of the conversation, I heard faint scratches coming from my bedroom that I wrote off as an auditory hallucination, until Korbin suddenly sat up and stared down my hallway. 

“ Did you guys hear that noise? “ he asked confused.  

“ What noise? What does it sound like? Where do you hear it? “. I asked anxiously.

 “ Calm down man, it just sounds like you have rats in your walls that’s all “ Korbin said dismissively.

 I wanted to open up to them. I wanted to tell them fully about the hallucinations and the sounds I had been hearing. Instead I paused and said, “ Never mind you’re probably right, the medicine they have me on makes me super drowsy and on edge so I'm making something out of nothing “. 

The rest of the conversation was spent talking about my incident. At some point Brian cut me off laughing and said “ Wait… so you were naked in the apartment complex? I wonder what Mrs. Lynn from downstairs thought about that “. 

Mrs. Lynn is my neighbor that lives alone directly below me that is 86 years old. She openly tells me how handsome I am every chance she gets. This spiraled the conversation into a hilarious conversation about how many people must’ve woken up and saw my manhood. We did this late into the night until they decided it was about their time to head home. I let them out and began getting ready for bed. I missed them and how often we turned dark and terrible things that have happened into lighthearted jokes. I felt like myself again. 

As their company came and went, I started my nightly routine. My therapist told me that having structure and a schedule would help me more than I would realize. 

I showered, brushed my teeth, combed my hair back, and set up my bathroom perfectly the way it was before, put my robe on and headed to bed. As I lay in bed in complete darkness my mind started to drift. Thinking about what my life would’ve been like if I hadn't been diagnosed. Would I have even been on the same course in life? Maybe I would still be in college, who knows. I just know I'm here now . As I let these thoughts take over my mind and let my eyes slowly shut closed, I heard very faint scratching coming from the closet. 

I was about to let myself continue to drift off thinking it was in my brain, when I realized there were no voices paired with the scratches. This unsettled me because I had always heard voices before, it was the scratching that was new to me. 

 As I thought about it more I started to recall Korbin hearing it earlier, I hadn't heard voices then either. I started to get anxious, what if Korbin was right about the rats? Then suddenly I heard the board that covers the attic entrance shift. 

My heart began racing as I lay in bed. I was struck with paralyzing fear. Did I just imagine that? I couldn't have, it sounded different than a hallucination. It sounded real, solid, like a person moving a piece of wood trying to be as quiet as they can, but they let the board slip. I had to know if I could see anything, I was told not to play into things I could determine were hallucinations. How could I know if it’s not real if I didn't even open my eyes, right? So I looked. 

 I slowly let my eyes crack open, trying my best not to shift as to not alert any one of my movements. As my vision became more clear the more my eyes opened. The room was silent and still.  I saw a black mass sticking out of the attic entrance.

 I couldn’t tell what it was. It wasn't shaped like anything my brain recognized, like a large oval. It was completely still, my anxiety only getting worse the longer I looked at it. I must’ve laid there for an hour looking at it before I finally decided it must've just been something that fell down and was now poking out of the entrance. It hadn’t moved at all in that hour and I hadn’t heard anything coming from it. I slowly got the confidence to get out of bed to turn the light on. I lifted the covers off me and flipped my bedside light on, now dismissing this shape in the darkness. 

As the light came on, across the room for less than a second, I saw a man’s scalded grotesque face coming out of the attic. 

As fast as I had seen it, it was gone. He yanked his head back into the darkness of the attic and slammed the board that covered the entrance back down. I heard thuds and scratches as the thing moved in my attic. Tears welled in my eyes as I dialed 911. 

I sprinted to my front door in only my boxers, opening and slamming the door behind me. My fight or flight kicked in and I had decided to fly. As I waited for the police to arrive, there was only one thought going through my mind. 
Was that what the voices had meant by the burned men?

 Was it all real?

 I was trying my best not to panic; not to buy into my hallucinations, but it felt so real. The noises weren’t like the ones I had heard before. They sounded real. 

The police finally arrived and swept my house for anyone inside. After some time passed, the police came back out and informed me they hadn’t seen or heard anyone. 

This shocked me, how could they not have found anything at all?

 One police officer patted my shoulder and said “ Son it may have just been a bad dream, your mind playing tricks on you while you were half asleep. All we found were small scratches on your attic cover, it seemed more like opossum marks than a man i can tell you that. Try and get some sleep and we’ll come back if you see anything else. “ With that they both left. 

They said they hadn’t found anything yet they told me there were scratches? How could they have just left me here with that man in my apartment? Maybe I was just being paranoid, I felt like everything was real, but I couldn’t play into my hallucinations. I clung to that.  Still shaken, I went back inside 

I sat in my living room for hours pondering what to do about everything. I hadn’t even seen enough of the man’s face to know it was real. I had just seen blistered skin, which played directly into my hallucinations. I had decided it was all in my head. What solidified this to me was walking into my kitchen and seeing my bottle of anti psychotic medication on the counter. The time I had spent with Korbin and Brian had made me fail to take my medication. I had missed a day, which I was told could cause my brain to relapse, even for a moment. I tried to just forget about the whole situation going forward. I tried hard. 

The night came and went, I never did end up falling back to sleep. As the sun rose, I heard a knock at my door. It was my parents, they had already heard about the incident that had taken place last night. I feel this is a good time to give a little background on my Dad. We have always lived in the south, my Dad was born and raised here just like myself. At a young age he had joined the police force, which had then became him joining the sheriff’s office. He was very well known and loved in the community. When I was 13 he had became the sheriff of our town, making me the sheriff’s son. 

You can only imagine how he felt when his son was diagnosed with schizophrenia and was now seen as “ the guy who went crazy “ to everyone in the police office. He had never been the type to even believe in mental health issues or anything of the sort. You were either sane or you weren’t. Still stuck in his old ways of thinking, my Dad refused to believe his only son was crazy. So when he came into my apartment with my mother behind him and his Beretta in his hand, there was no shock between my mother and I. 

My Father began to clear my house himself, muttering to himself how bullshit this was, how the police hadn’t cleared the apartment properly. My Mother and I both followed him, trying to tell him it was okay and to stop getting so worked up, it was just a hallucination. 

My Father didn’t believe that for a second. “ If there is some fucked-up-looking man in this house I’m going to find him so all of this can be put to a stop and you can stop with this mentally insane bullshit. “ he said through gritted teeth. 

As he made his way to my room, he went straight for the attic access. He climbed on my dresser and pushed the panel to the side and jumped up inside. My Mother and I waited for him to return, my brain not knowing what to think anymore. He came back down. 

He spoke with beads of sweat on his forehead, “ Now I don’t know what you’re seeing or who you're seeing, but someone has been up there quite recently. I doubt those dumbass cops even went up there to look. “ He dropped food wrappers on the floor. 

I said “ Dad those have dust all over them, I don’t want to believe my hallucinations either. I don’t want to believe I have schizophrenia at all. Those are old. Please stop this. “ 

He began to speak again, “ Son all your life I’ve taught you how to  how to be a man. Even if these wrappers are old, better safe than sorry. “ He then handed me his Beretta. 

“ Dad I won’t need this. I’m not even allowed to have weapons right now, the doctors said -“ 
He cut me off saying “ To hell with what those doctors said, no son of mine is going to live in fear because someone wants to tell him he’s crazy. “ He took the gun from me and went to the nightstand beside my bed. 

“ I’ll just leave it in here, please just keep it and use it if you need to. “ I agreed to this so he would stop freaking out over everything. Plus what was the harm if I was never going to touch it anyways. If I ever got questioned about it I would just say the sheriff himself put that there and let my dad deal with it. After everyone calmed down, my parents stayed awhile longer, checking on me seeing how I was. After a few hours they left and I caught up on sleep I needed terribly. 
 
I awoke to my phone ringing next to me, Brian was calling me. 

Groggily, I answered the phone. He was asking to come over. It was sudden and I was exhausted, but I caved and said yes after he started begging. After some time waiting around in my living room there was a knock at the door. I went to answer it, but as I got up from my couch I started hearing the scratching again from behind me. I decided this time I wasn't going to let my hallucinations get the better of me and continued going to answer the door. 

Brian came in after saying hello and we sat in my living room. I asked, “ Where’s Korbin at? Out with that girl? “ Brian chuckled and answered, “ No he had work tonight, but apparently after work he’s going to go meet her for the first time. “  I scoffed at this, “ Yeah hopefully he doesn't get jumped by a few dudes. “ 

We both laughed at this 

Brian hunched over and rested his elbows on his knees. He looked up at me and asked, “ So what’s up man, I heard police were called out here last night, are you alright? “ 

I guess this is what I get for living in a small town. Everyone knows everyone and your business gets spread around like wildfire. I started to fill him in on everything that had happened. An hour or two passed and Brian was taken aback by everything I had told him.

 He sat back and asked “ Have you taken a look at the scratches yourself? “ 

I was a bit caught off guard by this question and answered, “ No.. I guess I haven't felt the need to. I’ve just been taking people’s word for it. “

 Brian said “ Then why don't we go look ourselves? Maybe it'll give you the piece of mind you need. “ 

I was hesitant but agreed with him so we started for my room where the attic entrance was. 

Brian went first, climbing on my dresser just as my father had before and lifted himself into the small space. I followed behind him, almost falling in the process. Brian took out his phone flashlight, grabbed the wooden board and began looking at it. 

Illuminated by his phone light, we both saw what looked to be 5 marks running down the board. My heart sank when I saw this. I started a mumbled question, “ Brian those look bigger than what a opossum could make right? “ 

As I said that, we started to hear slow, methodical scratching coming from the back right corner of the large attic space. Brian shined his phone flashlight into the corner, but it wasn't bright enough to reach the end of the dark abyss that laid before us. 

Before we could gather our thoughts, a very putrid smell began filling our nostrils. It smelled like rotting meat and old berries. Both of us decided we had enough and jumped down one by one, Brian putting the board back behind him. 

I was panicking and asked, “ what the fuck was that Brian. “ As my anxiety climbed, I noticed Brian was trying to hold back a laugh. 
He spoke, “ I don’t mean to laugh, but I think you just have a really, really big raccoon living up there Noah. “ I looked at him confused. He responded while chuckling, “ Come on man, the 5 scratches were sharp not like human fingers. The nasty smell up there was probably just his left over dinner. Its alright buddy. “ 

This started to make me feel better, I still had doubt in my mind and I was anxious, but Brian really knew how to calm me down. “ Yeah, I guess you’re right, this shit still bothers me, but I guess having some explanation is better than none. “ 

He laughed and said, “ It’s cool man, I was scared for a second too. “ He started again after a large yawn, “ Hey man, it’s getting late do you mind if i head home? Thanks for hanging out I’ve missed you dude. “ I agreed and walked him out. 

I doubted everything that was happening. I was trying to not play into my delusions, but I couldn't get the thought of someone living in my house out of my mind. I headed to bed, turning off all lights but one. As I laid awake I couldn't help but wonder if Brian was just trying to comfort me. My first thought after seeing the scratches wasn’t a raccoon, but a human. Sure they were sharp marks, but there were small maroon stains outlining them. Maybe the berry smell? I decided to push it out of my brain and turned over drifting to sleep. 
 
I awoke to the sunlight coming through my curtains. Finally a full night of rest. I was feeling energized and ready to tackle the day. I had an idea for what I wanted to do already. I usually go on walks when it’s dark and the day is cooler to clear my head, but I decided a little vitamin D would do me well and I got ready to walk to my favorite park. 

I started my walk thinking of all the things that had been happening to me recently and how I actually was beginning to feel normal again today. I made it to the bench I usually sit at under a large oak tree, I pulled out a book I had been wanting to read and opened it up. I must've been sitting there for 2 hours because I was half way through the book,  I decided to look up and take in the scene around me for a while. 

The green leaves flowing in the slight breeze, the clear blue skies letting light down, the pond water slowly moving with all the geese swimming in it. I felt so peaceful, so content. Until I noticed a man sitting across the pond from me. 

He was staring directly at me just sitting. He wasn't threatening, but he was piercing me with his gaze. How long had he been staring at me? I couldn’t have given you a guess if I wanted to. I was trying to make out his features when I realized I was having a hard time because his skin looked melted. My heart sank into my stomach at this realization. I didn't know what to do, my anxiety was spiking fast. I felt my throat start to feel tight and my heart rate increase to unsafe levels. It felt like it was trying to pound out of my chest. I started packing my things up to go home and started my walk back. My legs felt weak and shaking, but as I walked I started to justify it more and more. 

He could’ve just been a man. Nothing to do with my hallucinations. I started to feel bad, it must've been a normal man that was a burn victim and I had ran away from him. Even if it wasn’t a real man, he hadn’t moved. It must’ve just been my mind playing tricks on me like it I had grown so used to it doing. 

I turned around and looked back. Wanting to apologize if a man was still sitting there. Partially because I wanted to know if it was a hallucination. There was no man sitting across the pond anymore. 

I was just grateful I was finally taking steps towards not letting my hallucinations and paranoia take over my brain anymore.

I got home and put my bag down by the door along with my shoes. I was very hungry, I hadn’t eaten since the day before, so I went into my kitchen to start making something to eat. I took out the turkey from my fridge and noticed when I opened my fridge I smelled the same rotten meat and berry smell from the attic. 

Damn raccoon, I thought to myself as I turned around to grab bread from my pantry. That’s when I saw him. 

I dropped the turkey onto the floor, my eyes slowly focusing on what was before me. The amount of fear that washed over my body was unfathomable. There was a naked man standing on the opposite side of my island.
 
His skin was horribly charred and bruised. Flesh drooped over one of his eyes singed in place. Rancid greenish puss was leaking from under the skin. He could only see from one eye, but under the singed skin I could see his eye moving around frantically, it looked as if something was trying to tear its way out of his eye socket. His chest heaved with gurgled shallow breaths, his stomach was robust and looked hard like it could pop at any second. The tendons in his arms were exposed and tightened as if he had flexed when my eyes met them. He stood extremely still, making low grunting noises as I stared at him.  

That’s when I remembered what my therapist had taught me. Look through my phone to see if what I’m seeing was actually there. Relief washed over me, but only for a moment. It took everything in my body to reach into my pocket and pull my phone out. I raised it slowly, my hand trembling as I pressed the camera button on my home screen. The black screen came for only a second, and when the camera opened I saw the naked man standing across from me on my phone. 

My phone fell to the floor. I couldn't breathe I didn't know what to do. I just screamed, “GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY HOUSE. “ 

When I said this he sprinted back into my apartment toward the attic. He moved at speeds I didn't think his grotesque body could produce. As he moved he made noises that resembled pig squelches. My brain went into fight or flight mode and this time I chose to fight. I sprinted after him remembering that my dad left his gun in my nightstand. 

As I entered my room I watched as the mans legs flailed trying to climb through the attic hole. I acted fast, and now I know I acted too fast. 

I yanked the gun out of my nightstand, turning around to face the mans legs, flicking the safety up and I started taking shots. They were sporadic, hitting my walls and in my closet. I had my eyes shut closed and before I knew it the magazine was empty. When I opened my eyes I saw 15 bullet holes in the walls, and the attic entrance re-covered. There was no blood, and there was no man. I was alone with an empty gun in my hand. 

I started to panic, had I really just hallucinated all of that? There is no possible way I could’ve, I could smell him, he came up on my phone’s camera. What had I done? I heard faint screaming coming from outside my front door,  I didn't know if it was real anymore. I didn't know if anything was real anymore. My chest got heavy, I felt like I was going to throw up. My lungs filled with air and let all of it out at an alarming rate. I was hyperventilating, my heart felt like it was going to jump out of my chest.

 I don’t know how much time had passed before there was a knock on my front door and the police had shown up. Someone must've called them after the gun shots. They immediately drew their weapons on me, I realized I still had my dad’s beretta in my hand at my side. I slowly put the weapon on the ground following their commands and was promptly arrested.

 I tried begging and pleading screaming at them there was a man in my attic that had been causing me to go through all of the mental anguish the past few months, but no one listened. I was written off almost immediately, being informed that in my frenzied rage 
firing off those rounds, I had shot the man that lived alone next door to me. 

A bullet had gone through the wall, hitting him in the left shoulder. I was arrested and taken back to jail and awaited returning to the mental institution. I couldn't help but contemplate my situation. I didn’t know what to believe or who to trust anymore. I didn't know what was real. 

While I was in the institution, my father alone came in to visit me. Nothing had changed for me. I was still doubting everyone and everything around me. 

When my dad came in I could see the pain in his eyes, his only son locked away with doctors again. What he began to tell me only solidified doubts in my mind. 

He told me when the police had searched my attic, they found no man. However, they found blood droplets inside of my attic that didn't match my DNA. He told me that the police told my landlord to call pest control after leaving my apartment. The entire time they were in my attic, they smelled a horrible putrid smell and they could hear scratching coming from all around them.
