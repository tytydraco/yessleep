The mirror on the wall had always been a strange fixture in my life. I remembered my mom and dad hanging it up when I was just a kid, and they always told me to stay away from it. But I was never one to follow rules, especially when it came to things that seemed off limits.

So, one day when I was home alone with my little sister, I decided to take a closer look. I stood in front of the mirror and examined my reflection, but something seemed off. It was like I was looking at myself through a distorted lens.

I reached out and touched the glass, and to my surprise, my hand went right through it. I pulled it back and stared at it in shock. I couldn't believe what had just happened.

I turned to my sister and told her what had happened, but she just laughed and told me I was being silly. But I knew what I had seen. I reached out and touched the glass again, and this time, I pushed a little harder.

To my amazement, the mirror swung open like a door, and I found myself standing in a room I had never seen before. It was a strange, parallel universe, one that seemed to be a mirror image of my own world.

I explored this new place for a while, marveling at the sights and sounds around me. But as the hours ticked by, I started to notice strange things happening in my life. Paranormal activities began to occur, and I couldn't shake the feeling that I was being watched.

I tried to ignore it at first, but it was getting harder and harder to do so. My little sister was starting to get scared, and I knew I had to do something to protect her.

I went back to the mirror and tried to return to my own world, but it wouldn't budge. It was like it had become stuck, trapping me in this strange place.

I was terrified and alone, with no one to turn to for help. My mom and dad had passed away when I was young, and it was just me and my sister now. I had to find a way to get us out of there before it was too late.

I spent countless hours trying to find a way out, but nothing seemed to work. The paranormal activity was getting worse, and I knew we were running out of time.

Just when I was about to lose all hope, I stumbled upon a way to escape. I grabbed my sister's hand and pulled her through the mirror with me, and we emerged back into our own world.

I never forgot about that strange mirror and the parallel universe it had led me to, but I never went back. I knew that some things were better left unexplored, and I was just glad to be home with my sister. However, a feeling of dread came across me when we came home, mom and dad aren't dead and they are not human.
