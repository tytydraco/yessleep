Light drizzle spat across the windshield, the final remnants of a bone-chilling November rain. The car, a bright silver Toyota, sat parked in a turnoff at the end of a poorly-maintained dirt road, its surface pockmarked like an old battlefield. Behind the wheel, twenty-one-year-old Paige studied a hand-drawn map with trembling fingers. She sighed deeply and folded the map, tossing it into a tattered backpack in her passenger seat. Pulling out her phone, she flicked through to a recent video and cued it up. A jovial looking young man appeared on her screen, clad in a well-worn ensemble of Gore-Tex and survival gear, sporting a million-dollar smile.

“What’s up, it’s your favorite explorer Danny back with another one. This time, I’m deep in the backwoods of Connecticut looking for the cursed village of Dudleytown. I’ll be taking you guys through it all, the history, the deaths and the shadowy organization who owns the land now, stay tuned, this one is gonna be wild-“

Danny stopped speaking and stared down the camera in silence for a moment.

“Kay, how was that?” Danny asked the person filming, looking up with curious intrigue.

“Perfect” A woman’s voice answered.

“Sweet, gimme the Go-Pro, I’m gonna head in, I’ll catch you on opposite side tomorrow morning”

“You have everything? Batteries, food, water?” The woman’s voice called nervously as the camera changed hands, the picture shaking violently.

With the perspective reversed, the camera fell on Paige who looked down at her feet nervously and kicked the ground.

“Relax little sis, I’ve got it all covered.” Danny said with a chuckle. “Here, take the SD card and upload the teaser for this tonight, get everyone pumped for the big premier on Halloween.”

The video cut to a black screen and Paige sat back in her seat and sighed, her eye’s welling with tears.

A month prior, she’d kept her end of the deal, arriving early at their designated meeting point, but as minutes turned to hours and the sun began to set on the eve of Halloween, Danny never returned. She’d phoned the police, a resident state troopers office located in the nearby small village. The officer had done little to ease her nerves, promising to get out their ‘as soon as he could get away’. 

She waited hours, calling several more times before an unmarked black Crown Victoria pulled alongside her in the turnoff. The officer seemed annoyed at her very presence from the start, barely answering her questions as he scribbled particulars in a small notebook. He’d promised to have a look the following morning, and took Paige’s number incase he turned up. Reluctantly she’d left and headed back home, enduring a sleepless night. She called first thing the following morning, and several times after that but always got nothing from the responding officer. Desperate at the end of the second day, she escalated it to a major state police field office but found no pity their either. Eventually after hundreds of calls and pestering every office she could get a number for; a senior officer called her back nearly five days later.

“Your brother likely ran off” The officer told her.

“No, that’s not possible, Danny would never do that-“ She’d started to say before she was cut off.

“You know that is all private property, right? “Neither of you should have been there in the first place, but I looked into your family a bit, after everything you two have been through…I’d probably have run off too.

Paige was stunned into silence by the officer’s crass explanation. Before she could muster up a rebuttal, he spoke again.

“Look, I know it’s hard to hear, but if anything turns up, we’ll be sure to give you a call.”

“Sir wait-“ Paige started but was cut off by the -click- as the officer hung up.

She sat in her tiny kitchen in silence, angry tears streaming down her face. Paige felt betrayed. Betrayed again by a system that was supposed to protect them. A system that had, for years, largely turned a blind eye to the actions of their abusive father. Memories swirled through her head, images of a hulking figure, staggering drunk around their house, screaming threats, images of her dainty-mother, quiet as a mouse, applying make up to cover bruises and cuts. 

As they got older, it got worse, culminating in a broken arm for Paige a day shy of her fourteenth birthday. By that point, their mother had collapsed inward, masking her anguish with a cocktail of Xanax and wine, and no longer bothered to put herself between her husband and the kids in an effort to shield them from his rage. But the moment Danny, now eighteen, had exited his room to find his little sister at the bottom of the stairs, bruised and crying, holding her arm that now bent at an unnatural angle, something finally snapped within him. He’d launched himself at their father, his scrawny arms flying in wild haymakers, some connecting with the wall, others on the man himself. They fought across the house, objects smashing across the floor, shouting obscenities at one another as Paige screamed herself hoarse.

Paige couldn’t remember how exactly it ended that night but certain things would stay with her forever. Danny and her father being led away in handcuffs, her mother on from the porch with no emotion on her face as she smoked a cigarette,  the blinding pain as the doctor reset her broken arm, then nothing until an ashen faced Danny visited her at the hospital a few days later, escorted by two police officers.

As the story went, their mother had bailed her husband out of jail only, leaving Danny behind. While driving him home, she pulled to the side of the road, retrieved a small revolver from her purse and with two shots, left the siblings as orphans. Together in that hospital room, through a hail of tears and sobbing, a deep bond formed between brother and sister. Forever bonded by a lifetime of shared trauma. Paige, like her mother, internalized everything. She became nervous, prone to panic attacks and had developed a horrible case of social anxiety, while Danny, channeled his pain into art which eventually culminated in the ‘Explore with Danny’ YouTube channel, which as of his disappearance, boasted nearly two-million followers. But despite his rising fame he never left his sister behind, always having her back, always building her up. She’d become his manager and main editor, and he paid her well for it, all the while giving her a healthy outlet and support in which to help in what would be a lifetime healing process.

“No” She’d finally said at her kitchen table, “Danny would never leave me, and I won’t leave him…”

Paige poured over her brother’s research into Dudleytown and the supposed curse that haunted the land. She waded through a sizeable amount of click-bait garbage ghost stories and fake experiences before getting to what she assumed was the real truth. It had been a sacred valley to a few of the indigenous tribes within the area before the land was stolen and colonized. Below the surface level nonsense online there were chronicles of sickness, mass hysteria, murder and unexplained phenomena. She looked into the land records, seeing that all the land was held by a mysterious group called the “Dark Forest Association”, their name a nod to the forest that surrounds the deep valley, and their many successful legal attempts to thwart development in the area and their ruthless prosecution of those found trespassing in the valley or the surrounding forests. 

After countless hours spent formulating every last detail of a rescue plan including spending a sizeable amount of money at a sporting goods store for weatherproof clothing and some survival gear, she made the trek to western Connecticut and the last place she’d seen Danny.

Paige cued and watched Danny’s intro video one final time, fruitlessly searching the background for anything she might have missed. “I’m coming Danny…” She whispered softly as the video finished. Placing the phone back in her coat pocket, she stepped from the car and into the blustery November air. Above, the sky was steel gray and covered in a roiling mass of clouds. The wind gusted sharply, kicking damp leaves into mini-cyclones as she grabbed her pack and locked the car. She walked towards the tree line and the dilapidated steel gate that separated the road from the Dark Forest. A smattering of ‘No Trespassing’ signs were affixed to the trees surrounding the road and gate. Taking a deep breath, she ignored the signs and stepped over the rusted gate and into the forest.

Despite the worn-in hiking path, the forest was true to its name. The trees above, despite being mostly devoid of leaves, grew so close together that their canopies interwove into a tapestry of gnarled branches that let in little ambient light. Paige made quick work down the path despite the dim light. Around her the forest was alive with sound. A small unseen mammal stirred the damp leaf litter to her right, while in the trees, birds and squirrels skittered across the branches. The trail wove its way through the dark forest, the normally vibrant colors of fall in New England muted amongst the shadows. Soon the grade rose sharply. Breathing heavily, she dodged hidden rocks and thorn-choked bushes as she climbed the steep path. It was nearly an hour before it leveled off and the steel-gray sky appeared above her. She crept to the edge of the path, panting from the climb as the view took her breath away.

‘Wow…” She whispered breathlessly.

Below her lie a massive valley, its floor choked with brown-leafed hardwoods and dense patches of evergreens, its walls were a near constant ring of undulating traprock cliffs that gave the area a bowl-like appearance. Paige searched around for the path down as the wind whipped her in violent bursts. After some searching, the path down revealed itself, guarded by a particularly thick bramble bush. Cursing herself for only packing a small Swiss Army knife, Paige pressed herself through the underbrush, the tense vines springing back and striping her face. The way down was as bad as the way up. Despite her trepidation, more than once her stiff boots and unsure footing nearly betrayed her and sent her tumbling into the valley below. 

The last fifteen feet was a nearly sheer drop to the rocky soil below. Her cold fingers gripped into the rockface tightly as she slid down, desperately trying to control her speed. When her boots finally hit the damp soil, her pulse pounded in her ears as she caught her breath. Taking a few greedy sips of water, she pulled her hand drawn map from her bag and took another glance. It showed a single route forward that eventually split off, with one path making a beeline for the remnants of the village while the other wound it’s way around towards the long-abandoned iron mines that dotted the valley.

“Stick to the left…” She mumbled to herself as she slipped the map back into the side pocket of her bag.

After her brief respite, she pressed forward into the valley. Like the forest above, the trees of the valley grew densely packed together, creating a tangled web of limbs that blocked the sky. However, the valley forest was even darker somehow, what little ambient light there was cast long arcing shadows across the ground. The air felt heavier as well, oppressive even. A chill crept up her spine as she hiked into the embrace of the forest. The trees were massive, ancient hardwoods with trunks three feet across, and gnarled limbs that stretched into the sky like twisted bolts of lightning. 

The ground was perpetually damp, her boots squished softly as she dodged the moss-covered stones that littered the long-abandoned trail. More than once, the darkness made her second guess her path, the long shadows made it hard to discern her path forward. The further she trekked, the more damp the ground around her became, her boots now squelched loudly against the sucking, fettering mud. The stiffness of her shoes, coupled with the sucking mud made her legs ache with each step. Ahead, lay a handful of ATV-sized boulders where the path veered sharply to the left. Squeezing through them the trail continued on another ten feet before abruptly terminating in a wide, blackwater bog.

“You’ve gotta be fucking kidding me…” She cursed under her breath.

Approaching the edge of the swamp, her boots sunk to the laces. Paige sighed deeply and rubbed her temples while scanning her surroundings. The water ahead was mirror-still and inky black. The surface was only occasionally broken by a few jagged rocks or tiny islands of dead, matted grass. The bog was ringed by an impenetrable-seeming wall of scrub brush, so thick she couldn’t see through it. Out of frustration, she picked up a small white stone from the mud and hurled it into the water. The surfaced shattered like glass, the splash echoed through the dense wood around her.

A primal chill wound up her spine. She hadn’t realized it until now, too focused on her path forward, the forest around her, was deathly silent. Nervous sweat beaded on her forehead as her body began to shiver. She shifted her feet nervously, pulling against the sticky mud. As she exposed the ground at her feet, a putrid stench wafted into her nostrils. Her eye’s watered, her stomach turned. As her pulse quickened, she decided the ring the bog, sticking to the narrow shore. Moving quickly, her feet slipping against the long stagnant muck, the rotten stench now hung heavy in the air. She glanced nervously at her surroundings as she slogged forward. A sudden, prickling feeling tickled her neck, she swatted back at herself nervously as her feet continued to slip and slide, each step she wavered dangerously close to the black water. 

A light breeze abruptly washed across her, making her whole body shiver. It was as if the sound returned with the wind, faint buzzing whispers swirled around her, ramping up in intensity with each passing moment. Now panting heavily, her footfalls grew sloppier, occasionally sliding into the black water, its mirrored-surface rippling out from the disturbance. The wind picked up, and with it the noise. Tears streamed from her eyes. The rotten odor grew heavier, her whole body shuddered with nervous anticipation. Ahead, she spotted a break in the underbrush. The noise around her reached a deafening level as she pulled herself onto a small rock and leapt through the gap in the brambles, back into the bosom of the forest.  

Stillness and silence returned. The buzzing whispers that had gnawed at her had seemingly vanished. She sat up in the soft, cool mud as her body shivered nervously.

“In my he-head” She stuttered. “Just freaking myself out…that’s it.”

Taking stock of her surroundings, she found herself amongst one of the many dense patches of evergreens she’d seen on her way in. The area was darker than it had been previously, the massive evergreens stretched skyward, their trunks nearly three feet across, some of them bearing vicious scars. The forest floor was a dense mat of waterlogged pine needles, occasionally broken by a rock or rotting log. As her breathing calmed, she grabbed a water from her pack and downed it. Pulling herself up, she felt her boots now noticeably heavier from the layers of fetid muck caked to them. With no small effort, she scraped the majority of it into a stinking pile on a small rock before retrieving a small flash light and setting off down the path and into the silent darkness. 

The trail wove its way through the towering trees as her bobbing flash light cast long shadows ahead. Being aware of the silence gave the forest a muted feeling, like watching a movie with the sound off, but still somehow feeling the sound waves reverberate through you. Deeper into the bowels of the valley she went, the boulders growing in size as she progressed. Massive, lichen covered rocks dotted the forest floor. Ancient, weathered stones deposited thousands of years ago by the receding glaciers, stood like small, featureless huts alongside the trail. She continued forward until she came upon a small clearing. Above her, the rolling gray sky peered through, offering a brief relief from the oppressive shadowy darkness of the valley. Paige paused for a moment, glancing up at the turbulent sky. In front of her, the way forward disappeared into a massive boulder field, where the stones lay clustered together merely feet apart. She knew the correct path to the village was hidden somewhere within that portentous looking field of rock. 

Glancing at the sky, thoughts of her mother popped into her head. Images from their last days together looped through her mind as a gnawing fury simmered in her gut. She thought back to all those times her father had taken his rage out on Danny and her, and how towards the end, her mother just sat, absentmindedly on the couch, as if nothing was wrong. Anger boiled inside; she clenched her fists as a few tears leaked from her eyes. Her gaze locked at the rolling sky as if it were her own mother staring back at her.

“Why didn’t you help us?” She growled through clenched teeth.

A gust of wind, gentle and cool, blew across her face. Goosebumps tracked her arms and the prickling feeling in her neck returned. Breaking her gaze away, she slipped between the trees and into the darkness of the forest as a chill wound around her spine. The small ambient light from the clearing quickly faded and Paige clicked her flashlight back on. The shadows around her seemed to dance across the landscape as she gripped the light tightly with a trembling hand. Another gust of wind, brushed over her. The overwhelming silence was crushing her. She felt her body physically weighed down by it, the darkness, the grief, the rage that boiled within her. It was like something had her in a vice grip and was slowly clamping it down. Suddenly disorientated and dizzy, she spun on her heels and turned back to face the clearing. Her gaze fixed on a spot, a darkness that seemed to almost buzz at the periphery of the woods. Water welled in her eyes from not blinking, her gaze laser focused on a single spot.

-CRACK-

A branch broke in the woods, the noise like a gunshot echoing through the silent wood.

Paige turned and ran.

Down the path, through the darkness, her flashlight a useless beam that shot in random directions as she pumped her arms. The buzzing returned, heavy in her ears as her body shook from chills. Her heavy boots slowed her down but she continued on, leaping over rocks and branches, desperate to follow the path in the darkening woods. The forest seemed to come alive around her, shadows seemed to flow from tree to tree, chasing her. She raced towards the boulder field as the buzzing whispers overwhelmed her senses. Heart pounding, her muscles screaming in agony, she entered the outer confines of the boulder field. It was like a maze, she turned left, then right, went straight, then left or right again. Her heavy boots skidding and sliding across the damp floor, her body bashing against the granite rocks with every chaotic turn. The prickling on her neck had blossomed into a true pain, as if hundreds of white-hot needles were being pressed into every pore. The buzzing whisper grew into a shriek, its source seemingly right behind her, screaming into her ears. Paige swatted as her neck and turned back, expecting a pursuer, something veiled in shadow, hate-filled and hungry. Only the still forest greeted her. 

Turning back, a panicked cry erupted from her lips, she was heading straight for a dead end, she dug her heel in to pivot off it and make the turn but it quickly slid out from under her. She went down with a sickening thud, her forehead bouncing off a small stone imbedded in the mud. Stars exploded in her vision as she rolled across the muddy ground, eventually stopping face down. Darkness took her.

Like a slideshow, pictures raced through her mind. Birthdays, holidays, school events, their one and only family vacation to cape cod. As the pictures flicked by, each showing a smiling and happy Paige and Danny, a black smudge started to appear. First way off in the background, like an errant thumbprint or mistake in the film. But as image after image went by it grew, the smiles on their faces began to fade as the black smudge covered more and more. Like an oil spill it rolled across the pictures, slowly pulling the child versions of them into the abyss.

Paige sat at the bottom of the stairs, eyewatering pain rocketed through her arm and shoulder. Her vision blurry with tears, she saw her obviously broken arm. But unlike the day, their was no yelling, no fighting, no threats or swearing. The house wasn’t in disarray, there was no overturned furniture or fragments of smashed tchotchkes littering the floor. The house was neat and tidy, and eerily still. With her still working hand she wiped her eyes and blinked the remaining tears away. Her family all sat on the couch, staring blankly ahead, all bore the same vacant expression as her mother in the final years when substance and grief robbed her of emotions. Paige cried out, begging for help, but was ignored. They all looked on, unblinking, unmoving. She dragged herself to her feet, pain shooting through her, taking her breath away. As she stood on shaking legs, Danny turned towards her, his eyes vacant and dark.

“It’s your fault” Danny droned, his voice a monotonous buzz.

“Danny…” Paige whimpered.

Her father turned to her.

“You were a mistake, we never wanted you.” He growled; his voice had the same strange buzzing as Danny’s.

She looked up at her family again. Her father and Danny now both stared at her, unblinking, but her mother’s gaze remained away.

“Mom?” Paige called.

No response.

“MOM?” She cried louder.

A faint buzzing started in her ear again, indiscernible whispers all spoken at the same time.

“Mommy please…” Paige begged.

Still nothing, no movement, no feeling, no acknowledgement of any kind.

Paige fell to her knees and cried, deep wracking sobs. Danny turned away from his little sister and faced his mother. “Time” his voice buzzed, barely audible. Her mother stood from the couch and produced the same small revolver she’d taken both her and her husband’s life with and aimed it at Paige with a jerky, mechanical motion. Through her tears she looked up at her mother and begged incoherently, to wake up, to see, to help them. But instead, her mother put the gun to her own temple and opened her mouth. An ear-piercing shriek, inhuman and demonic came from her as the house began to shake. Paige was knocked back by an unseen force as a shooting pain coursed through her arm. She squeezed her eyes shut, and suddenly, silence. After a moment, she opened them again. Her mother’s face was inches from her own. The same, Xanax fueled, unfeeling stare, boring deep into her soul. Paige opened her mouth to speak but before she could, her mother pulled the trigger, and her vision went black.

Paige laid on the ground, covered in mud and leaves. She felt someone gently rousing her by the shoulder. A dull ache crept over her head as she opened her eyes. A person was standing over her, gently touching her shoulder.

“Paige, you need to wake up.”

It was Danny.

Just as she’d left him that day at the entrance to Dark Forest, wearing the same clothes, looking like he’d just stepped out of the car.

She gasped and sat up, her head aching more as Danny reached out to her.

“Where have you been?” She asked, her voice hoarse.

“You need to leave Paige” Danny said quickly as he took a step back.

The pain in her head grew much worse. She squeezed her eyes shut and rubbed her forehead and eyebrows, kneading the pain away. When Paige looked up again, Danny had come closer. But it wasn’t the same Danny she’d seen a moment ago. His clothes were tattered and thread bare, he was missing all of his survival gear and even one of his shoes, but his face. Paige felt a wave of nausea come on. His skin was gray and pulled back, his eyes swollen and black. This thing, this monster that looked like Danny, talked like Danny, seemed to care for her like Danny, leaned down, its face inches from hers, its putrid breath made her gag.

“Danny…” her voice trembled.

“GO!” it bellowed, spittle and rotten meat flying from his mouth.
