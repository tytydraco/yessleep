My flight was interrupted as I smashed against the only piece of furniture I had in my humble room, except for the bed. The wardrobe fell apart like a house of cards, which didn't surprise me since I bought the cheapest one I could find.


The few clothing pieces that hung on the hangers fell on top of me, together with parts of broken, light, thin, cheap wood plates. I grabbed the shirt that fell close to my right hand and used it to wipe off the water from my shoulder.


I stood up quickly and inspected my whole body to check for injuries and, more importantly, water. Except for a few cuts and scratches, there were no injuries on my body. And no water, fortunately. Miraculously enough, I didn't even hit my knee during those two low-cost flights I just took in my room.


The towel I had tied around my waist when I left the shower was on the floor at the place where I first hit the wall. There was a noticeable dent in the wall, almost in the form of my silhouette, with my arms stretched out to the sides. I stood there, next to the busted piece of furniture, naked and confused.


*What the fuck did just happen?*


All I knew was that I had to buy a new wardrobe, even though I was completely dry on cash. And that I got myself into some extremely weird and dangerous shit.


I suppose a sane person would have had a hard time falling asleep after such an incident. Apparently, I'm not sane because I fell asleep as soon as I cleaned up the mess and stacked my clothes on top of each other in one corner of my room. Slept like a baby too, I was way too exhausted from the day at the foundry to let anything bother me and ruin my rest.


Rays of warm, deep yellow sunlight with a dash of orange in them landed on my forehead and began descending toward my eyes. I tried to ignore them and held on to the last threads of sleep I held by their ends. My efforts were in vain, I woke up soon after, much earlier than I desired to wake up on Sunday, the only day in a week that I have free.


I got up, went to the bathroom, and relieved myself. Just as I was about to wash my hands, I remembered the event from last night.


*Yeah, fuck this, at least for now.*


I grabbed the pack of baby wipes that were in the medicine cabinet in the bathroom and vigorously cleaned my hands with them. I used a few of them to clean my private areas and my armpits as well.


Fuck it, it'll do in these circumstances.


Most of the Sunday went by as I looked around for a new wardrobe. I had to find a cheap one, in a store that would accept a check and activate it after I got my salary.


I bought the ugliest piece of furniture known to men, but it fit the criteria so I didn't complain. I took it home in pieces, on my back, like a mule. The delivery service would've cost me almost as much as the wardrobe itself.


I got home and a majestic DIY session ensued in which I managed to assemble the wardrobe with its sides swapped. Then I had to reassemble it and put it together the right way.


By the time I finished the whole DIY event, it was almost 5 pm. I figured I'd go to the hospital first and see why they called me, then head to my brother's. The latter would take a lot more time, I presumed. I prepared myself a microwave lunch and devoured it quickly, then changed my clothes and headed to the hospital.


I approached the receptionist's desk at 5:54 pm, according to the clock that hung from the ceiling right above it. The lady who was there the first time I came by was on her shift again. But this time, her face lit up as soon as she saw me. She looked at me with caring eyes and greeted me with a smile.


"It's wonderful to see you again honey. Your limp is barely noticeable, bet you're a sturdy and strong fella. Listen, you got here just on time too, so you can go straight to her room. No need to fill out any forms this time, you're a well-known person here."


I was perplexed by her warmth and her words. Did I catch her in a great mood?


"I'm sorry ma'am, who is waiting for me and where?"


She burst out a sincere laugh and took her glasses off, letting them hang off the cord around her neck.


"I guess I ruined the surprise! Oops! Act surprised though, or I'll get in trouble. The room's the same as before, 221. Go on now sweetie, as much as I enjoy your company, I have work to do."


It should've been obvious to me what was going on at that point but I guess was oblivious because I was too stressed out and engulfed by my problems and the weirdest events that multiplied the bunch of them I already had on my plate.


I entered the stupid room that ruined my life and stepped through the short hallway into its main area.


I realized immediately that everything was different about that room. And I don't mean the furniture or the arrangement, not even the fact that those unsettling life support machines were gone. The girl was awake, with the top third section of the bed raised so she could be in that position halfway between sitting and laying down.


The wide smile and the sheer brightness that emanated out of her were what turned that previously bleak room into a pleasant place.


She looked at me. Light, straight brown hair neatly combed over to one side, her hazel eyes glistening with strength, white teeth shining, lips as red as a ripe apple, she looked as if she spent the past few months having the time of her life and enjoying her youth, not fighting for her life.


I don't know why but I felt a tear welling up from inside. Fortunately, I have years of experience in murdering all of the feelings that awakened in me, so I didn't let that tear go anywhere. 


"You’re my hero! I know it's weird because we don't really know each other, but could I give you a hug?"


To say that I was hesitant would be an understatement. Nothing good for me came out of receiving affection from a woman in my entire life.


She noticed my reluctance before I even uttered a word.


"Please? It would mean a lot to me..."


Her eyes were hard to say no to but I came up with an excuse.


"Uh, I don't think that's a good idea. I did some DIY stuff today and I didn't have the time to take a shower so I emit a pungent aroma that would burn your eyes hehe."


I thought the joke would veer her off and not offend her.


"I don't care. Please?
I hugged all my saviors here, from the doctors to the nurses. You're the only one left."


She barely raised her weak arms which obviously needed a lot of physical therapy after months of inactivity, signaling me to come in for that hug.


Fuck it, I did as she asked and hugged her.


It felt good. Like, really good. And not in the "A beautiful girl hugged me" romantic kind of way or whatever. It was a genuine, wholesome interaction between two humans. I never felt that before...


After the nice hug, I sat on the reclining chair close to her bed. I didn't really know what to say so I felt relieved when she started the conversation. 


"This is gonna sound freaky but I have to tell you. I don't remember much from my slumber, except for this one dream."


Her eyes narrowed and turned to the side for a bit.


"Please don't think I'm crazy after I tell you this." 
She let out a nervous smile.


"Ah, no, don't worry, I get it. Believe me, if I told anyone what kind of weird shit--"


*Great, fucking moron. You just had to swear like a piece of trash in front of her.*


"Uhm, I mean stuff that happened to me recently, they'd throw me in the looney right away.
It's nice to learn that someone else has the same worries."


I laughed, sincerely. Haven't done that in a while.
She got back to her story.


"So, the dream. I was being chased by someone through some kind of foggy forest. I screamed for help. And then my late sister came out from nowhere. She grabbed me by my wrists and told me to relax. And that she'd get help. Then she jumped into a lake and disappeared."


*What the fuck does that have to do with me?*


I thought she was done with her story. Turns out, she just took a pause to gather up some strength, then continued. 


"The next thing I know, I was sitting in the same forest and my sister came back, all wet and trembling, though I don't think it was from being cold. Then she said that she called her friend and that he took care of the bad guy."


She looked me straight in the eye, confused.


"So when I woke up and eventually learned what happened, I wasn't surprised at all. And I felt happy that my elder sis is still watching over me. I think she sent you here somehow."


My heart sank but I acted as if her words didn't affect me and demonstrated the most obvious fake laugh ever.


"That’s quite a dream. But I think everything that happened was just a happy coincidence. Just for fun though, what was your sister's name?"


The second those words came out of my mouth I knew the answer. I knew because I realized why *the voice* was so familiar. I knew who it was, and I knew it far too well.


It was the voice of my childhood best friend who passed away just before we were about to enroll in high school. We were inseparable from kindergarten all the way to her tragic accident when a rich kid mowed her down with his expensive car and got away with it with just a slap on the wrist.


I remembered that she had a younger sister whom she rarely saw because their parents were separated and each parent got custody over one of the girls. But I know how much she loved her little sister. She always mentioned her and told me stories about how they had fun during the short time periods when they got together.


BeeBee, that's what she called her.


I froze in place and felt numerous drops sliding off my cheeks and onto my thighs. I stared into the wall like a catatonic patient in a mental hospital.


A wave of cold and warm washed over me simultaneously as my chest filled up with something I can only describe as ice-cold water with a bunch of boiling hot rocks in it.


I couldn't drown or ignore these emotions. Even if I could've, I wouldn't want to. I felt sad and happy at the same time. My best friend, the only person who understood my soul and knew the true me was out there somewhere. And she didn't forget me. She trusted me with something that matters to her more than anything.


I think that the girl tried to talk to me and asked me something but I didn't respond.


Then something snapped me back into reality. The nurse came in, happy and full of vigor, the complete opposite of any nurse I ever saw.


I quickly wiped my face with my hands and stood up. Then I stepped away from the chair and towards the window, hoping that the nurse wouldn't realize I cried like a baby.


The nurse had those bed tables in her hands, with food set all over it.


"Sorry to interrupt you guys but our princess here has to eat. She needs to get her strength back and skipping meals won't get her there."


She set the table over the girl's legs with amazing speed and dexterity. Then she grabbed one of the two small transparent bowls with some red stuff in it and turned to me, a wide smile on her face.


"Here's our hero! The staff here is crazy in love with you right now."


I felt uncomfortable.


"You know, ever since this beauty came to us, she's been like a family member to everyone. Even though she was asleep, she captured all our hearts and became our favorite almost immediately."


She turned her head towards the girl and had an expression on her face that I could only describe as motherly care.


"We all prayed for her to get well, but things were heading in the opposite direction. And then you came."


She looked at me. No smile or joy on her face. Just concern.


"You came just as that insane person was about to do her unbelievable harm. And you risked your life without hesitation. We saw it on the camera footage after the police were done with everything."


She turned her head towards the bed for a second.


"Don't worry, the camera is off now that you're out of the coma. It's also unplugged, and someone would need a ladder to plug it back in."
I think she winked at the girl.


The joy came back on her face as she looked me in the eyes.


"A few days after, she woke up. And no one can make me not think it wasn't thanks to you. Most of the staff have the same opinion. That's why we covered your hospital bills together."


I was shocked, but at the same time relieved because I finally found out what happened with the bill.


"No, please, I can't accept--"


She interrupted me and it felt like she was scolding me.


"Shut up. You have no say in it. We were happy to do it, nobody forced us. Don't insult us and decline a gesture from the heart."


Her hand extended and she put the bowl she held in front of me. The scolding was over and she sent me a kind smile.


"Heroes get special jello in our ward. Don't you dare reject it, otherwise our cutie here won't feel comfortable enough to eat in front of you. And she absolutely has to eat now."


I took the bowl and was about to thank her when she hugged me tightly. I had to grab the bowl in one hand and keep it on the outer side of my knee so she wouldn't crush it between us.


"Thank you. I know you've been through a lot. But it was worth it. You saved a beautiful young soul here."


I felt like I turned into a little baby because yet again I felt a tear sliding off my cheek.


"Eat up guys, you'll talk later. I'll leave you be."


I started eating the jello to stop the tears. I don't know why I thought it would work but I also have no idea why it actually did work.


The nurse brushed the girl's leg with her hand as she passed her bed, then leaned in and whispered something to her way too loud so I could hear it.


"Hot, humble, AND in touch with his emotions. Baby, if you don’t reel him in, I will. Mhm."


I choked on my jello but the nurse left the room anyways. She even waved back casually without turning or stopping.


When I regained my breath and collected enough oxygen to not die, I looked at the girl and said.


"BeeBee, right?"


Her eyes filled with tears immediately, but her mouth smiled with joy.


I knew I had to tell her everything. I started laughing. 


"Well, if you think your story was creepy and weird, get a load of this!"


Then I told her all about the voice and how I busted my knee because I have no idea how to fight. I told her how I assembled the wardrobe in the wrong way and how the delivery costs more than the actual furniture so I had to carry it on my back through the town. She laughed her ass off.


I didn't mention the incident in my apartment. I didn't want her to feel guilty and worried.


I made sure she ate all of the food the nurse brought her. I told her about my job and my brother. We talked about her sister a lot and laughed. It was fun.


Then I got a text. I didn't even realize it was almost 8 PM. It was my brother.


*Yo, bro, I know I said you can come over whenever but I also said today. These guys don't allow visitors past 9 so hurry up, man. We got a lot of important stuff to discuss, fifteen minutes won't do.


Oh and, stay away from water until you get here. Like, bottled water is OK but anything bigger... I'll explain.*


No fucking need to explain, I sure as hell get it.


I told BeeBee I had to go and she told me to come around when I have the time. I already told her about my job so she suggested next weekend. I couldn't say no.


I left the hospital and the cab I previously called arrived in a few minutes. Just as I got in though...


Heavy rainfall started coming down.
