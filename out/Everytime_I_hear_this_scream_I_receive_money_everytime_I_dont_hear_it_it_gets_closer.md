Hey everyone, as of recently, I have been hearing piercing distorted screams throughout my nights. Usually, I hear them when I get home at 10:12 pm from the gym. I don't purposefully hit the gym that late. I work a plumbing gig that usually consumes most of my day. Anyways, I don't know what or where these odd sounding screams are erupting from, but honestly, I don't care that much. 
 
I mean, I do eventually want to know where the source of these screams is steaming from, and the why of them; however, I have to admit that I think I started to adjust to them. That's mainly because every time I hear them and then acknowledge them, a wad of cash gets launched at me from where the screams are coming from. Whoever throws the cash has an insane arm. 

The shrieks sound at least a mile or more away from my house, or at least they did. The main reason I am writing this blog on here is to seek guidance from you strangers. I am sure that some of you want the worst for me even though you don't even know me, but I am also positive that some of you want to help me or at least discover with me why there's screams and what they're coming from every night. I also don't know why I keep getting money, even if I just slightly turn my head towards the direction of the shuddering yells. 
 
 The money is amazing, and everything but something just feels weird weird about it. Sometimes, when I pick it up, I swear that it tries to cut me. Yes, I am clumsy here and there, but the money literally folds in a bladed shape. The first night when I picked up the money, it successfully cut me. My finger intensely bled on the cash. Strangely, it only bled on one of the hundred dollar bills. That hundred dollar bill slithered out of my hand hand and blew away into the night.
 
 I have to be cautious when I pick up the money now, but I also discovered that I have to hear the screams every night. One night, when I came home from the job, I had my airpods booming with synthwave. I had completely forgotten about my routinely observation of the always changing warped screeches, as I parked my motorcycle in my garage. 

As I was walking past my garage window, something bright purple rubbed against my window. I jumped back and took out my airpods. Feeling bold, I headed outside to see what that purple thing was, and then I heard the noise of agony. 
 
This time, it sounded like it was five houses down from me. Instead of it pausing before doing another shriek, like it usually does, it held it for a good 11.11 seconds. The sound encouraged my ears to implode into my my skull to make me look like a dying fish out of water. Thankfully, they didn't, but the skin on my ankles peeled upwards. It frikin sucks to walk right now. 

I only figured out the duration of the shriek when you ignore it because it happened a second time to me. The second time was much more brutal than the first. Every time I try to enter a slumber, something aggressively hits my window, creating a loud "dongk!" noise. As soon as I wake up, I hear the muffled hellish screams hold steady for 11.11 secs and either some of my skin peels or my ears bleed. And now the shrieks are closer, at least 2 houses down. 

I think I am the only one who hears it. I haven't asked my neighbors about it, but I stalk their socials. None of them have posted anything about receiving money from screams or bright purple things rushing past their garages. 
 
My garage is now a quarter or more full of cash. I don't remember how long this twisted game has been progressing on for. I really believed that I would adjust to the random screams at night, but they're always different in some way. One night, the scream was gargled. 

Another night, one had giggle like pauses between it, and another night, it sounded like someone was drowning in rocks. I know I said at the beginning that I didn't mind the screams, but the closer they approach, the more they worry me. 

 I lied in a frikin blog post. I guess my boss was right. I do lie too much, I also lied about not wanting to know what and why the screams are emitting from. I don't know what to do right now. I am guessing that I almost have enough money from the disturbing noise to move away from this neighborhood, but what if the screams follow me. Am I overthinking that? 

Should I just be more aware of my surroundings and appreciate the money that literally flies my way? Or do I head towards the screams or ignore them forever? If any of you have information on these screams or advice for me, I would extremely be grateful for you helping me possibly escape these shrieks.
