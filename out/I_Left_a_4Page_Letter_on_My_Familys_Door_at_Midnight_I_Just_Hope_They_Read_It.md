Posting this here, and elsewhere, after leaving a physical copy on their door tonight, on the off chance it helps someone else. I don’t see the chances of my parents finally hearing me being high, but the likelihood of someone on here taking something good from my letter seems much better.

The bold and italics are gone in this format, but I think it still hits damn near the same.

I changed names and nicknames for obvious reasons, but other than that it is entirely real. This is my situation — this is not a story like most posts on nosleep. 
And yes, my childhood name was actually butters. I didn’t change that one lol.

Here goes I guess.


A Letter to my Loved Ones — ALL freakin DAY, ALL NIGHT. 06/08/2025-06/10/2025

I said I’d write y’all a letter. Not because I need to win, ‘escape an argument,’ or make you feel small. But because writing is the only way I can communicate without my words being twisted, interrupted, or dismissed. So I’m communicating now. Clearly. Concisely. Raw. One last time. I’m not writing this because I hate you. I’m writing this because I still love you all enough to want better from you. If I didn’t, I’d have left years ago. Gone “no contact” as many in my generation have opted to do with their dear parents. But I haven’t. I decided against it. Solely because I keep believing — perhaps foolishly — that the people I come from are still in there.  Beneath the pride, beneath the fear, beneath the masks…And ultimately, I want my kids to have both sets of their grandparents in their lives. 

To My Momma:You taught me to reflect. To critically think. To analyze my own behavior. Yet, when I’ve asked you to do the same, you come back not holding accountability — but a mirror, that is forever deflecting & blaming the world — rather than just accepting your own actions; accepting the truth of a situation where your child says you hurt them. Accepting the fact that maybe, just maybe, you are not perfect. I have begged you to hear me. Not just to listen to me — but to hear. To legitimately see me as I am, not the version of me you’ve decided I must be. You don’t reflect like you tell us to do — you deflect. And instead of growing — like you taught sister & I to do — you’ve turned your deflection and self-delusion into an art form. I still believe you’re capable of more. After all, you do change slowly, in little ways. That’s why this hurts so fucking much. Not because you’ve failed — but because you’re pretending you haven’t. That’s not strength. That’s fear. You raised us to be stronger than that…And for the record? I’m not mad that you made mistakes raising me. I’m not mad you didn’t get me diagnosed earlier, or that you passed down generational pain to me. Those are mistakes every parent makes. I’m just mad you never got yourself the help you needed. I’m mad that you’re still not okay, and you won’t admit it, not really. I’m mad that you won’t let yourself heal. That’s what hurts most, Momma. Because if you did? 
You’d finally be free. 

To My Dad:You used to challenge Mom. I remember it. I looked up to you as an 8 year old — when you first entered our lives — because you stood your ground. You were a shining example of what a man could be, something I had never been exposed to. I LOVED YOU for giving me that. But now, when I do the same, you call it disrespect. When I am the strong, loving, CARING man you raised me to be, I am “assassinating her character.” You say you’re ‘protecting her,’ dad. And THAT is precisely why I harbor more resentment toward you and not my momma. You gave up!  You don’t check her anymore — you let her say wild shit to her kids and get mad when one of those kids in particular gets upset about it. Enabling isn’t protection pops — it’s fear in a pitiful costume. I know you love her. But love without truth? Love with capitulation & lies? That’s not devotion to your wife, dad. That’s a quiet, bloodless surrender. I am not attempting to degrade you, or disrespect you, or your wife.. I am simply trying to remind you, of the father, & husband, that you used to be. I’m trying to ask you where he went. I know that man is in there somewhere.

To My Sister:You’re young. You’re still figuring shit out. I get that — I was doing the same at 19, too. I still kinda am at almost 26. But I gotta tell ya, don’t confuse blind loyalty with love, Sister. I don’t want you to take my side, or theirs for that matter — I just want you to think critically without believing you need to flatter or constantly run interference for the people you came from. You are SARAH. You don’t have to take shit from nobody. Not even mom or dad. Especially not them. One day, you’ll see more clearly. I sound like a condescending prick when I say that, I know, I know, but it’ll happen. And I hope when it does — and you see everything in focus for the first time — it’s not too late for you to speak honestly to our parents, or to yourself. Hell, skip all of that and just do it now, if you can. I almost did. Failed miserably. But you’re stronger than I am. You could do it. I don’t have the same issues with you, Sare, obviously, as I do with them. They knew what they were doing: you did not. So please, take me seriously when I say this — you don’t owe them shit. Call me anytime. 


(Doing your jobs and raising us, like you were supposed to, does not deserve accolades. You made us, we did not ask to be born. I refuse to be “thankful for existence” in exchange for disrespect and mental manipulation — just to be told I am the abuser.)  


What I’ve Endured:I’ve been accused of saying things I’ve never said. I’ve been gaslit constantly, yelled at, labeled, minimized, and emotionally cornered more times than I can count. And when I’ve finally raised my voice in defense against these attacks, it’s been called “aggression.” But that’s just what happens when you’re forced to scream to be heard. I know now why you do the things you do, but that doesn’t mean I have to tolerate or accept them as normal anymore. They are not. 

Why I’m Done Talking to the Family for the Foreseeable Future:This letter is not a conversation starter. It’s a record. A god-damned-mother-fucking paper trail of who I am. Of what I’ve tried to say. Of everything I’ve kept quiet for years about out of misguided love. I’m done being labeled the villain and “abuser” of the Smith Family, simply because I have always seen the cracks in the people I care about the most. I WILL NOT keep bleeding out ANY LONGER in effort to keep peace for a house that refuses to admit it’s on fire.

My SOLE, most important Boundary:If you want to be in my life, I will no longer allow it to be through shame, silence, guilt, or manipulation. It must be through truth. It must be through humility. It must be through mutual respect. Until that happens, I will now be keeping my distance from this family. I unequivocally refuse to become the kind of parent you two became. I do model off who you were, however. That Mom & Dad were the world to me. I am not saying ‘goodbye forever,’ I am simply requesting you do the same work that you have asked of me. For your own good. It’s in your two pairs of hands, now; Mom & Dad. If I truly want to raise my future children with Amy in a home rooted in truth — and you want to see your grand-babies — it starts with us four breaking this god damned cycle. 
Here. Now.

This was my last attempt at honesty, guys. I hope you sit with it — not argue with each other, but sit with it, and truly attempt to understand. I won’t try this again any time soon. 
I still believe you’re capable of becoming better — I just can’t be the one begging for it anymore.
I’m done trying to change you, Mom & Dad. 
It’s up to you, now. 
You refused to accept your child might be onto something — and now you get to figure the path out amongst yourselves. 
Thank you for the hair products. You two saved me a lot of money, I really appreciate it. 
They won’t make me forget that my mother won’t listen, though.
They won’t make me forget that my dad is too scared to help my mom move on. 
They won’t fix anything that we actually need fixed. 
So again, thank you, seriously, no sarcasm here. I really did fuckin’ appreciate it, it made my day and ultimately my current feelings about you two all the more confusing. You knew that though. 
If I hadn’t needed them and hadn’t just loved (the positive side of) the gesture so much; I would have given the bag right back to you. That group text argument was only five days ago, Ma. 
My self respect is not for sale in exchange for conditioner. 

Not anymore.                                                                                                                                    — Butters

P.S.                                                                                                                                                      I didn’t write this to be cold, or to intentionally hurt anyone’s feelings. I wrote it to maybe, be heard. I OBVIOUSLY still deeply love you guys. So very much. More than you know.  That isn’t changing — even if everything else might.
