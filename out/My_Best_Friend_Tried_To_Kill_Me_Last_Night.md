Not sure if this one counts. Delete if necessary.

I’m going to begin by saying that I'm still really freaked out by everything that happened. I have bouts of paranoia and some pretty gnarly trust issues now but, largely, I'm okay. At the very least, I'm alive. 

A couple of weeks ago, my friend started acting weird. For the sake of anonymity, I'm just going to call him Buddy. Ever since I met Buddy, he’d always been a really talkative, pleasant to hang with, super relatable, dude.

The changes in his personality started off small. He would disengage by staring into the distance while we talked with friends. He started looking a bit different, like he was inexplicably tired. His eyes had dark bags and would lose focus. I was concerned, of course, but didn't think it was too big of a deal. I’d ask how he was or if anything was bothering him and he'd shrug it off with, “I’m fine, man. It's just hard to sleep.”

We were sitting at the bar about a week ago. While I was drinking my beer, Buddy sat, staring at the countertop. He hadn't taken a sip of his or even thanked the bartender when she set them in front of us. I sat there, confused as to why he agreed to go out if he was just going to sit there and ignore everyone.

I thought about it for a minute before I asked, “Hey man. What’s going on with you? You've been acting like a different guy all week. You can talk to me about whatever, ya know?”

I took a sip and watched him. 

I could see that he was angry. He slowly turned and looked at me coldly.

“Buddy. What's up? You okay?”

Nothing.

All I got back was a disconnected stare. I moved my head side to side and he wasn't even looking at me. His gaze was focused through me. 

“Alright then.” I said, standing up and placing a $5 on the counter. “I'll see ya around.” I clapped him on the shoulder and headed for the door, not looking back.

Okay, so fast-forward two days and I'm sitting in my house, watching TV. No shit, I feel like I'm being watched. You know the feeling. I glance around and BAM; Buddy is standing outside my screen door. He scared the absolute shit out of me. 

I jumped and stood to my feet. 

“Dude! What the hell?” I was angry. “How long have you been standing there?”

I strode over to the door and froze.

Buddy stood almost limply. He held a hammer in his right hand while his left rested on the door handle. His eyes were bloodshot and his hair was matted with grease. He looked way more ragged than the last time I saw him.

“Buddy? Buddy. Hey. Buddy!” I was screaming now, petrified. 

He slowly moved his eyes up to meet mine. 

“I’m sorry.” He croaked out.

“You're scaring me, dude. Tell me what you want.” I demanded, nervously keeping watch of the hammer.

Nothing. 

“Buddy, this isn't funny. I'm serious. You need to leave. Now.”

Thankfully, he turned and left without another word. I don't know what would have happened if he came in. I'm in the sticks, so I keep a handgun close at home and I seriously thought about grabbing it for my protection. In retrospect, I don't think I could have shot him though. 

I watched him leave until he walked down the driveway and disappeared onto the county road. If he had walked, he walked for miles. 

I closed the main door and latched the deadbolt. 

I'm not sure if any of you have been in a major confrontation but you can literally feel the intensity. I have been in plenty of scraps and found myself in plenty of dangerous situations. I swear on my life when I say that Buddy gave off an entirely barbaric sense of danger that I had never experienced. My blood ran cold and I could do little but panic. At the time, I didn't have confirmation but I knew that he was there to harm me.

At that point, I knew that I had to take action. I called up some mutual friends and gave them the rundown. Of the four people that I called, everyone agreed that I should get an involuntary psych evaluation on him. We decided it would be best to go together to ease Buddy’s suspicion. 

Even weirder, when we showed up to get Buddy from his apartment, he was totally normal. He talked and joked as if the last week hadn't even happened. We told him that we were going to the outlet mall. On the trip out, my friends kept shooting me looks of doubt.

As we neared the hospital, I confronted Buddy, explaining what happened and what we were doing. He laughed it off like a joke and denied the whole thing. 

“Okay, that's just crazy BUT sure thing. If it makes you feel better. I’ll go, man, I don't mind. ” He told me.

He went in with our friend and about 20 minutes later, they came strolling back out. Buddy was smiling but he was the only one. I felt like I was losing my mind and my friends were palpably judging me.

“What did they say?” I asked.

“All good!” He replied with a thumb in the air.

I knew that what I experienced was real. I was there. I still felt the undeniable sense of danger around Buddy but there he was, making me look like the one who needed evaluation.

I let my mind ease and enjoyed the day out with my friends.

I almost removed the entire series from my head over the next few days but that was just up until yesterday. 

Yesterday, Buddy came back to my house. I was sleeping in my bed when I got that strange sense of being watched again. I woke up, still bleary, and looked around in the darkness. A bit of moonlight came through the window, casting shadows across the interior. I looked to the window and saw that it was open but I definitely went to sleep with it closed.

I rubbed my eyes and stood, making my way to the window. The breeze picked up and tickled my skin. I realized at that moment that I was drenched in sweat. 

“Buddy?” I called out into the abyss.

That's when he grabbed me by the throat. I gasped at the surprise and instantly began choking. His grip was impossibly strong. Before I knew it, my feet were off the ground. I swung out wildly but it didn't do any good. Tears poured out from my eyes. I tried to breathe in but got only a hot, sharp, pain in return.

My hands fumbled across his face until I felt the soft give of his eye. Vehemently, I plunged my thumb deep into the socket, clear to the second knuckle. 

Buddy grunted and loosened his grip. I brought my knee into his chest hard. I felt the crunch of his ribs just before he dropped me. I fell onto my ass and scrambled backwards, gasping desperately for air. I greedily breathed in, feeling my lungs burn as they expanded.

I threw my body across the bed and rolled off the other side, slamming into the hardwood floor. 

Buddy’s voice, rather, somebody’s voice boomed throughout the room, rattling my insides. “I’m going to wear your fucking skin, child.”

As he bellowed, it sounded like hell itself was spewing forth from my longtime friend’s mouth.

I pulled my bedside drawer out of its tracks and fumbled for my Ruger. Pushing myself back into the corner and examining the room before me, I found that I was alone. Buddy was nowhere to be seen.

I jumped to my feet and tenderly touched my throat. My voice cracked as I called out for him again. 

Nothing.

I'm not sure where Buddy went and I'm not sure if he’ll be back. One thing I know for sure; my best friend tried to kill me last night.
