If you've already read them thank you very much, I hope you have enjoyed. Now continuing where I left off...

Isaac's grandson Joseph came to the funeral that was held. As per his wishes, Isaac was cremated and strictly forbidden from being returned to the cemetery.

At the wake the other night guards and myself all shared stories of how great Isaac had been. I spoke of how kind and caring he was, how I had viewed him as a father-figure, and how he saved my life.

Joseph told us that he didn't know his grandfather very well. His mother had died when he was a small kid and her side of the family and where they came from had always been a mystery to him.

Eli pulled Joseph to the side and told him that his grandfather wanted to see the world again and that it would be a great honor for his grandson to be the one to show him that world. With a nod Joseph said he understood and as soon as he finished school he would make sure to take him wherever he went. The life of a photographer sure sounds like an adventurous one. Peaceful, surely an afterlife worth seeing. Traveling to strange and exotic sights to see the beauty of the world.

Kyle and I meandered away from the church, stopping by the old oak outside of the cemetery. I don't remember seeing Kyle pick up an axe, and I don't remember how long it took us, but by 8 that night the old oak fell into the street and removed the ease of access into the cemetery.

Now if the lambs wished to offer themselves for slaughter, they would need to get a little more creative with getting in.

Eli had made a small return from retirement to help while the cemetery director searched for more candidates for night guard. While it was only once a week and always the same night that I worked, it was nice having a familiar face there with me.

Brian, known as Bruiser by the people who had the misfortune of meeting him, was found in the Regent Family Mausoleum bisected from the belly down. When the Cemetery Director found him he was coughing blood and muttering about treasure and his birthright and how he was lied to. The Director picked up the bloodied crowbar and sent the miserable wretch to his eternal fate before rushing to the hospital, making phone calls to everyone in his contact list.

Brian had barely survived the shadows that had lured him into the cemetery until after they had scattered in the light of day. I doubt that he will be able to return like the contractor had. During the day, the cemetery is like any other cemetery you come across. A quiet place full of dead people with people shedding tears and moments of silence for someone who cannot hear them.

At night, like every night, the grounds are filled with the hustle and bustle of the departed. Two Night Guards lock the gates and check them every hour until the morning, told stories or threatened by the voices that echo in the night.

After I refused to open the gate, even to save my dying friend, many of the spirits have chosen to avoid me. If I am willing to let someone close to me suffer rather than open the gate a few minutes early, there is nothing they could say that would convince me to free them.

Even Mrs. McCarthy has elected to distance herself from me. Her intentions seemed to have been a slow build up of friendship to convince me to let her out. The only one who still pops by is Mad Michael, surely proving how mad he really is.

Shortly after 3am, I had sat by the fountain and started flipping pennies into the upper bowl, missing far more than actually getting anything in, when Mad Michael sat down next to me and hovered a hand over my shoulder.

“Do you know why I am called Mad Michael?” The voice said, waiting for the shake of my head.

My head turned left to right as the penny I flipped bounced off of Phobetor's face and onto the foot of his brother.

“When I was alive, I told the people of my small town that a demon lived among us. It would bless the people with good luck as long as they made sacrifices to him. The people of the town scoffed at my foolishness. The Mayor, like any good patriot, was recruiting young men to go off and fight the British. The British were sore from losing their most valued colony and wanted to take it back.”

I set the stack of pennies I was holding down and turned to face Michael as I had never heard him talk about being alive.

“When I would argue that the boys the mayor recruited never returned, not a single one, I was chastised for my youthful ignorance of war. What could a 13-year-old boy know about the reality of war.” 

Michael gazed up at the fountain with a look of disapproval before turning back to me, fully engaged in his story.

“Back then, there were no gates to the cemetery. A caretaker, who lived where your admin building is now, would chase out rambunctious kids that thought running through a cemetery at night was a jovial time, but hardly a night watchman. Late into the night, long after the rest of the town had been taken by sleep, I would see the mayor leading a pack of young men through the cemetery, and an hour later he would return alone.”

I stared at Michael, surprised at how long ago he had lived. Michael paused deep in thought, remembering something he wished had been lost to time.

“One night, I snuck into the cemetery and climbed an old yew tree that stood where this fountain stands now. From my viewpoint, I saw the mayor do horrific things to the young men he led inside before wiping the blood from his mouth and returning to town. The sight had frozen me in terror and I was unable to move until the early morning light. When I finally regained control of my body, I fell from the tree and twisted my leg. An injury that left me lame for the rest of my life.”

Michael gestured to his legs which had a bend in it I had never noticed before.

“I of course continued to condemn the mayor and continued to be called Mad and Daft for my accusations. After the war, and after Napoleon had been kicked out of France, a group of Germans arrived in our small town bringing their faith with them. When they announced their plans to build a Lutheran Church, the mayor had been the loudest to decry the heretical beliefs of the influx of immigrants. However, the town decided that the addition of a house of worship would be beneficial to the spirit of the town. While I could not help with the building, I was recruited to work on a series of intricate clocks and ornaments to be included in the structure. Something I took to naturally, and gained the praise from the Germanic implants to our town.”

Michael wiggled his fingers and mimed the minute craftsmanship required for his profession. 

“As I told my new audience the concerns I had for the town mayor, of his pagan practices, and strange pull on the town, I was heard for the first time with unfettered belief. Late one night a group of the men helped me enter the cemetery, keeping our distance as the mayor led a few of the newest residents towards the old yew tree. When they witnessed the act of barbarism committed by the mayor they acted instinctively. They rushed the mayor and nailed him to the yew tree before burning both to ashes.”

Michael stood up and I glanced at my watch, it was nearly time for the next gate check. I walked towards the South Gate as Michael continued his story.

“After the mayor's death, the town was plagued by a Typhus outbreak. Fearing the turn of luck the town fenced in the cemetery, putting the two gates that stand to this day. Once the gates were locked that night, the fortunes of the town began to turn. The town chose a series of men to watch over the cemetery at night making sure it was locked at 9 every night and remained locked every hour until 6 in the morning.”

I locked the gate and watched as Michael waved off a few shadows dripping water and sludges of green sludge. As the shadows returned to the darkness Michael resumed talking.

“It was a matter of pride to stand watch over the cemetery. Back then there was only one spirit that roamed the cemetery. The mayor, bound in chains and in a constant state of fire, would howl throughout the night but never left the place of his death. One night, despite the protests of the town, I stood guard. There were probably six or seven men that night prowling the grounds, checking the gate. As I sat on a downed tree, massaging my leg, I felt a sudden bash to the back of my head. My vision blurred and I cried out in pain for help”

Michael rubbed the back of head as he spoke. We walked by a disheveled Callahan who picked at boils spotting over his body. Professor Joel was consoling him and telling him that picking at the boils was only going to make it worse.

“When I rolled to my side, I looked up and saw the mayor standing above me, fury in his eyes as he brought down his fists onto my face. When I awoke, I was standing over my body as it was consumed by the starving mayor. I was trapped in the cemetery with him. I made the assumption that speaking in the cemetery when the gates were closed allowed for the spirits to be able to interact with living beings. I ran a few tests to prove my assumption and from then on, I warned those who stood guard every night to remain silent. Over time more and more spirits arrived, most from places I do not know”

I stood in disbelief, Mad Michael had been here for so long, it was he who was a guardian angel in a den of demons.

One man, who tried to do the right thing, was bound to the cemetery for centuries.

“As time passed the other spirits learned of my lack of malice and shunned me, calling me mad just as I was called when I was alive. The name Mad Michael stuck. I wish I could tell you how to change things here but I simply don't know. The mayor has slowly become the cemetery. In a way, I think he has become the whole town. His gift of good fortune lives on as long as his sacrifices are made. Is it worth the cost?”

After asking his question Michael disappeared into the night leaving me to digest everything he had told me. I had more questions but no way to ask. 

At least for now.

I know I have an angel watching over me in the cemetery. 

An angel named Michael.
