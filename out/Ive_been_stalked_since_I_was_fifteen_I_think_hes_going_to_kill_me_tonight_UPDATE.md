**UPDATE:**

I flung my laptop to the end of my bed, staring at the silver apple logo on the top of it. 

It feels like hours, that I’ve been staring at my laptop — but it was only seconds. I hear slight knocks on my glass sliding door.

*Tap. Tap. Tap.*

One. Two. Three.

*Tap.*

Four. 

Are you kidding me? He’s using the safety-number? How does he even know that I’ve been recently diagnosed with OCD?

Fuck, Maisie, he knows everything about you. Stop asking yourself these stupid questions. He knows everything. 

For some reason, this ignites a certain rage in me. Remembering, how he groped me on the bus, and when I pushed his hand off of me, he squeezed my thigh so hard that it left a bruise the following morning.

The way he waited outside of my High School, when I was sixteen, after texting me saying he had a gun. It sent the whole school into lockdown. And he was arrested, only to be set free on the premise of “boys will be boys”. 

Showing up to my prom with a friend that he didn’t even know of, when I was seventeen. Sexually assaulting me in the bathroom. I will never forget the feeling of sobbing on the tiles of the girls’ bathroom, my underwear ripped off my body and thrown into another stall. I will never forget feeling the trickles of blood down my legs when I stood up to go and retrieve them. My first time — a moment that should’ve been special, ruined by him. 

The hundreds of letters he sent out each year. All signed at the bottom, with, ‘are you scared yet?’

The fear has turned to rage. And all of a sudden, the rage turns to calm. A sense of relief floats over me. 

*He’s gonna kill me. It’ll finally all stop. He will finally stop.*

I walk back into my kitchen with a slow pace. I stare at him, through the glass sliding door. He didn’t bother to cover his face. He wants me to see him, when he kills me. 

I walk up to the glass door. My heart is pounding so hard that I can hear the beats in my ears, despite me feeling comfortable with my decision. 

I smile at him. This causes him to scrunch up his face, his bushy eyebrows — more specifically. His eyes turn cold; the excitement leaving them.

“All this, because I rejected you when we were kids?” I ask and he cocks his head to the side; almost as if I was speaking gibberish. I know he can hear me, because I saw a flash of emotion run through his placid face before he managed to remove it. “You know, you could’ve had a girlfriend that really loved you by now. Maybe even a wife. That wouldn’t have been me, but she could’ve been out there somewhere.” I pause to lick my lips. They’re dry and chapped, yet I can feel a line of sweat above my top lip. “Yet, you wasted eight years of your life on me.” 

He opens his mouth to speak, but I cut him off.

“I’m tired of being scared, Cole.” I press my fingers around the lock of the door. “I’m tired of running.” I start to flick it open, slowly. His eyes don’t move from my gaze. “I’m tired of you. I’m tired of this.” 

*Click.*

My fingers slide against the lock, pushing it down to leave the door unlocked. 

I pull it open. 

I can feel the cold air breeze force its way against my body. It isn’t the normal, kind of cold night. It’s chilling — like dunking your body into icy water. Immediately, all the hairs on my arms stand up from the cold. I won’t talk much about how the hairs on the back of my neck have been risen, the whole time I’ve been facing him. He stares at me, with a blank expression on his face, as if he’s having trouble registering what’s happening.

I stare back.

“Well, you’ve always been full of surprises.”  

It only takes a moment for him to launch himself at me. I feel the pressure of one of his hands wrap around my neck, almost immediately, as he forces me to the floor. I hit my head, hard, against the cold tiles inside my kitchen, next to the door. He carefully gets on top of me, pinning my arms down with his knees.

The knife clatters to the floor and the metal hitting the tiles echo through my ears. 

“Pretty girl,” he addresses me, using his free hand to twirl my blonde hair in between his fingers. “Your head would look so pretty above my fireplace.”

I muster up all the spit in my mouth, before forcefully making it fly over him. He releases my neck, slapping me across the face so hard that, for a moment - I feel as though I’ve lost consciousness. The definition of seeing stars. 

He reaches over to cover my mouth in retaliation. I see this as an opportunity. I bite him. I bite him with all my strength, and I can feel my teeth ripping into his flesh as his blood pours into my mouth within moments. He flies backwards, wreathing in pain, clutching his fingers. I stumble up to my knees in this time, and I decide to make a run for it - spitting out a whole mouthful of blood as I do so. 

It isn’t long before I fall forward, and I can feel Cole’s hand wrapped around my left ankle. And momentarily, I can feel a cold, sharp pain enter my leg. I let out a scream. Sort of similar to the ones you hear on movies when someone’s getting murdered. And then, there’s no pain. Just sudden numbness, almost like pins and needles in my calf. 

I wouldn’t have known that he had stabbed me if I wasn’t sliding around in my own blood. But once I’ve realised, the pain is excruciating, and the cold feeling turns to burning. Not a small burn where the stab wound is, but the burning sensation shoots up my leg - not a single inch of my leg is not in immense pain. I let out a loud cry. One that reminds me of an animal, begging for its life after being caught in a trap. 

It’s like time slows down. I can see the rage built up on his face — and I know this because he has furrowed his eyebrows together so intensely that he looks desperate. His eyes are no longer calm, but instead, they are engrossed in every movement I make. He does not want me to get away. He drags the knife, covered in my blood, along my face and down my neck. 

“I’ve thought about this moment for so long,” he says softly. I can feel his boner pressed against my leg. “You, dying.”

“But what, exactly, is your reason?” I ask him and he looks surprised that I would have the courage to do so. 

“You hurt me, bitch!” He spits, and digs the tip of the blade into my neck. I can feel beads of blood falling out of where he’s holding the knife. 

“You don’t get to choose if you get hurt or not, Cole. It just happens.” 

He presses deeper and starts to trace where exactly he’s going to cut me. I can feel the tip of the blade being dragged against my throat and over and over, he traces the exact same spots; preparing himself to end my life. 

“Miss Davis?” I hear a voice call on the other side of my front door. Everything speeds back up again. Cole is frozen in the position that he’s in. He’s sprawled out, with his knees over my arms and the knife digging into my neck. “This is the Police. We’re doing a Welfare Check. We need you to open the door, please.”

“I need help!” I call out, taking advantage of Cole’s sense of shock. He immediately gets off of me and attempts to back up. He slips, in my blood pooling on the floor and covers himself in it. Not a good day to wear a white wife-beater. He scrambles on the floor, showing his true colours. Only brave, when it comes to hurting me. 

There’s a loud *crack* and then a *thud*, of my wooden door being swung open. Cole is slipping in my blood but makes it to his feet. He immediately shoots his hands up in the air.

“Mr. Thomas Mantle, you’re under arrest for the attempted murder of Maisie Williams. You have the right to remain silent. If you give up the right to remain-…”

The surprisingly young officer places Cole’s hands behind his back and cuffs him. In the process of doing so, he mouths;

*‘I’ll see you soon’.*
