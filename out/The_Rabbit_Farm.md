The following is a statement that is case of subject 01 sent to The Magpie, who sent the statement in will stay unknown for the person or persons own safety. Subject 01 begins.

"I never liked rabbits the way their mouths twitch, the way they stare at you but I guess all animals stare at you but just the way rabbits stare and they eat their own children... *disgusting creatures.* So it didn't help that I lived on a rabbit farm, my parents bred rabbits for food and pets and sold the pet ones to stores. Anyway your probably not here to read my whole life story so I'll get to the scary stuff and see what you people say about it you can really say anything I won't be here to read what you say sorry if what I write is a little jumbled its just I'm just kind of losing hope of escaping here. So my parents died a few years back and I took control of the farm it was in there will for me the only child to take control of the farm seems I was screwed from the beginning.

 I woke up in the morning don't know which day or if it was really morning I don't really know how time works here or maybe it just doesn't work at all... anyway I woke up to feed the rabbits already dreading my day. I went down the stairs grabbing the food and bracing myself to leave I open the door. I almost fell off my front porch and gasp launching myself back on the porch after I see my life flash before my eyes. Then I look around me nothing absolutely nothing but black surrounded me but as I was taking in what the hell was happening a low grumble broke the silence which also broke me from my awe and fear. I ran back inside and shut the door behind me, I tried to turn on the TV and it was the same news, sports and reality shows so if I picked up a TV signal here I could call for help, I bolted to the phone and tried to call 911...nothing like the line has been cut. I sank to the floor and started to cry, I fell asleep I don't know how long but long enough to start to get hungry so I checked the fridge and my left over sand which was their.

After I ate I tried to come up with a way to leave without leaving because their is nothing for me out there, I pulled my hair out and gritted my teeth just to think of something. The TV station I could email them and ask for help. I got on the computer and heard the TV station speak their name Chanel 12. As I started to type something called to me from outside... Feed me. Those simple words chilled me to my core and I started to slowly turn to the window that the curtains parted, A big red eye stared back at me I knew those eyes those are rabbit eyes or should I say eye. Something told me to feed it so, I got up and fed it a whole raw chicken it seemed pleased. So that's been my been my life for however I've been here and if your asking no the email to the news station did not work and now I'm not even sure this will work, please get me out of here because the normal food isn't satisfying it anymore I think it wants something bigger..."

Statement ends. This email has just been delivered to us but the only weird thing is that the email sent date was 1990... so we hope that the sender is out there and safe and to all of you reading hope you have a good day because it might be your last. The Magpie 1
