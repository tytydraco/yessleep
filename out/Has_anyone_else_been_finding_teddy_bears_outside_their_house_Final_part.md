[Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/cS1tMGBxSE)

Hey folks. It’s been a rough few days, but I feel like I owe it to you to finish my story. So here it is, the last of my tale.

I spent the rest of the day that I found out about Cody’s disappearance searching through the den and the web in general for anything that might help. I kept calling Ellen, but she still wouldn’t respond to me. Even the Jackal didn’t seem chatty anymore. I felt more alone than I ever have. I cried myself to sleep that night, and again I dreamt about Luke.

The following morning, I woke to find something was wrong in my room. After only a second of the still-waking haze, I shot out of bed. The Jackal was missing from its spot on the side of my desk.

I scrambled to pull up the Jackal’s webpage on my computer. Someone had to have stolen its pi “body”, but why? After a few minutes, I had reached the webpage. It seemed glitchy and unstable, somehow. Like, my fingers felt strange typing into it. I don’t know, maybe it’s just my imagination. My fingers just felt like they hurt from typing. Like they weren’t really mine and they were desperate to burst free.

I sent the Jackal my message rapidly, anyway. “What happened? Do you know where you are?” If luck was on my side, the Jackal’s body would be somewhere with phone reception, so the SIM card within the pi’s modem would be able to get it online and using the webcam’s livestream to see. That assumed that whoever had taken the Jackal hadn’t smashed the webcam or something, of course. The Jackal responded quickly on the webpage.

*”They took the Jackal. They took the Jackal. Help the Jackal. They have it. They have the Jackal.”*

I wrote back as fast as I possibly could. “Who has you? Where are you?”

*”The old place. The den. The Jackal sees the sticks. The Jackal sees the threshold.”*

I couldn’t know for sure what the Jackal was referring to, but I didn’t like the hunch I was getting. It sent another message.

*”The planks are rotting. The Jackal is trapped. You left it there. You left us there. In the den. With the Saint.”*

Underneath that it had sent a link. It took me to a google maps satellite view, and I knew at once where the Jackal was. The image showed an area of woods I knew well. In the bottom left corner I could see the roof of my elementary school. It was the woods in my hometown - my hometown, which is over a state away. 

I knew I would have to go. I hadn’t forgotten Cody’s listing as a missing person from *my* hometown. I hadn’t forgotten the little den my friends and I had in those woods years ago. The name of the website that all of this began with. The dream Cody told me about. This was where I’d find Cody, and maybe then I’d find answers or a way to a put a stop to all this. I got my car keys and got ready to get on my way. It would be at least 8 hours of driving.

I took the steak knife with me - I had to have something to defend myself with. When I went to put it in the glove compartment, I found there was something already in it that I knew I hadn’t put. It was a notepad of sorts. I pulled it and realised straight away what I was looking back. It made me feel nostalgic and scared in tandem. It was a flipbook, the kind that makes a sort of hand-drawn animation when you flip through its pages quickly. It was just like the ones Luke used to make. Almost too much so. It had his exact art style. A little crude and childish, but bursting with talent and expression. I’d have recognised it anywhere. My mind flashed back to all the times I sat in his hospital room watching him draw and talking with him about his art. 

The pad it was made on had worn edges, almost like it’d been handled for years. The first page showed a drawing of a little cartoon boy smiling widely. As if in a trance, I flipped through the book’s many pages and watched the “animation” unfold. The boy’s smile grew wider as he leaned in closer. He kept getting closer, until one of his eyes filled up the page. It zoomed into his eye, and slowly but surely the pupil and iris formed into a detailed and scientifically accurate depiction of a human cell.

The cell divided, and divided, and divided. Rapidly and uncontrollably, the new cells swarmed the pages of the flipbook. I got straight A’s in biology. I knew what that meant. Each mitosis was slightly wrong - extra chromosomes, malformed nuclei. The cells piled up, forming a mass that spilled out of the frame of the pages as the animation  came to a close. On the back cover of the book, someone had written *”Funny story.”*

The knife felt heavy in my other hand. I checked the car for other signs of intrusion, but nothing else seemed out of the ordinary. I saw the flicker of something changing on my phone’s screen. It was sitting on the dashboard and I had the Jackal’s webpage open. It had sent me another message.

*”THE JACKAL SEES THE FUNNY STORY. THE JACKAL LAUGHS.”*

My fingers quivered as I closed out of the page. 

Before I got on the interstate, there was something I had to do. I took a detour for 40 minutes or so to visit Ellen’s house. After the Jackal somehow using her voice and her not answering any of my calls, I had to make sure she and Annie were okay. She was the last person keeping me tethered to reality during all of this, really.

As soon as I stepped out of my car and towards her door I felt wrong. The curtains were all drawn and the lights seemed to be off. Something about her house just radiated bad energy to me. I couldn’t put my finger on it. I shook myself out of it, and knocked on the door.

After only a few seconds the door flew open and Ellen came out. She seemed to be in a rage. My sister is normally very timid and easy-going. I couldn’t understand what was going on. It was like a bad dream unfolding before my eyes, her behaviour was so bizarre and unlike her. She was sweating, her face pale. She was still in her pajamas; it was 2pm.

She screamed at me. “What the fuck are you doing here at this hour? There’s a child in this house! A real child, not some - some fucking game you’re playing!” 

She looked utterly deranged. Her outburst caught me totally off guard, I stumbled over my words. While I sputtered, I saw how strange the movements of her face were - her blinks were out of sync, one eyelid lagging behind the other.

“Ellen, please”, I stuttered. “I just, I just need to know if you’re -“ She cut across me, almost growling. “You don’t knock anymore. You don’t call. You lost that right when you brought them here.” 
And then, she slammed the door shut behind her. I only fully realised it once she was out of my sight, but her eyes were a little too high on her head.

I heard her lock the door from the other side. Whatever was going on with her, she was right about one thing - there was a child in that house. And with whatever was wrong with Ellen, I didn’t think Annie was safe. I hurled myself against the door but it wouldn’t budge. From inside, I could hear the voice of the very first teddy bear I’d received. The one that said the message in Dutch when I pressed it. I still have no idea how it could’ve gotten into Ellen’s house. I never actually saw it in there. 

I heard Ellen’s voice, cooing softly - then suddenly shrieking “EAT YOUR FOOD!” I looked through the peephole and saw Annie sitting at the kitchen table, staring blankly at a plate of raw meat. Ellen was still screaming at her, and it wasn’t even words now, just animalistic screechings that made head split. Her shadow against the kitchen walls didn’t seem to match her movements quite right. 
 
I kept throwing myself against the door. Eventually it gave way, but I found the house empty. The scene in the kitchen I’d seen through the peephole was gone. I looked behind me. Ellen’s car was still in her driveway, so where could she and Annie had gone? I looked all around her house but found no sign of either of them. The bathroom was covered from top to bottom in Christmas decorations - tinsel draped over the toilet bowl, the bathtub filled with baubles, all the bells and whistles. I went downstairs again and for some reason, I felt compelled to check under the kitchen table. There was a miniature teddy bear, like the ones I’d received before, sitting on the floor. On the underside of the table was another Polaroid of Luke. Above his head, *”INRI”* was written. After another tour around the house with no sign of either of them, I requested a wellness check and then got back into my car. I had to get going again; Cody’s life could be in danger while I was fretting about. 

It felt weird driving all the way to my hometown. In spite of the insane, mind melting situation I was in, and had been in for weeks, I couldn’t help but think of all the happy memories from my childhood. The days exploring the woods with Tommy. Stealing cigarettes from Isaac’s dad. Playing soccer with Matt. You know, kid stuff. I don’t know, I guess that’s just what my mind went place to in place of all the madness I’d been subjected to as of late. The sun had just set by the time I passed the church at the edge of my hometown. The place had barely changed in all the years I’d been gone. It was like stepping back in time, but the context of my being there just set everything off kilter. Made it feel like revisiting a bad childhood memory or something.

I wouldn’t be able to take my car where I had to go so I parked it on the street outside the public school. I only had to hop the wall outside then and hope that they hadn’t installed security cameras outside in the time since I’d finished elementary school. I made my way to playing field at the back of the school. Behind the dugout was the start of the woods. I crossed the pitch and gripped the knife in my jacket pocket before setting forth into the woods.

After all these years, I still remembered the path to the den like the back of my hand. It was deep in the woods, but you only had to go in the same direction that I entered. There would be a small pond at about the halfway mark. Luke and I used to skip stones there. 

Every second I spent in those woods felt alien. The whole place was just seeping with pure badness, it felt like. It felt completely foreign to the place I’d spent so many hours of fun in as a child. You know that feeling when you think there’s one more stair, but there’s really not? Every single step I took felt like that.

After a few minutes, I could see the pond in the distance. It was almost pitch black by now and the woods felt unnaturally, almost sickeningly silent as I walked up to the water’s edge. No animals shifting, no branches swaying in the wind, just the squelch of mud underfoot. The stagnant water of the pond was covered in a film of algae, reflecting the moon like a black mirror. The air smelt awful, and it smelt awful in a weird way. The scent of pine all around me and pond scum from the water was undercut by what smelt like spoiled meat. 

And then, as a cloud in the sky above me moved out of the way of the moon and better illuminated my surroundings, I saw a figure only two metres or so to my right, stooped over at the edge of the pond. I couldn’t see her face, but her hair was wet and stringy, her clothes rags. Hesitantly, I gripped the knife tighter in my hand and approached her cautiously.

“…H-hello? Are you okay?”

I stopped maybe two feet away from her. Slowly, she turned her head to face me. I instantly recognised her as the woman I’d seen outside my house over the last few days. The same woman Cody must have been seeing. Her eyes were blank, glossy, her head seeming to shake slightly, but that was all secondary, because her mouth hung open, her smile obscenely wide and empty, her gums glistening. And sitting in her mouth were clusters upon clusters of frogspawn. Frogspawn, that was swollen and translucent, writhing with the shapes of tadpoles, some of it spilling out of the corners of her mouth and plopping on the ground to burst on impact. I could only return her gaze as my stomach knotted itself. And then before my heart had time to skip a beat, she darted away, deeper into the woods, her limbs jerking inhumanly behind her like a marionette’s.

I stumbled back in shock, the knife slipping out of my hand and onto my lap. I had to collect myself there for a second. But I knew I would have to follow her. I thought of Luke, of Cody, of Ellen, all of them seemingly twisted up in the nightmare acid trip my life had became. That woman terrified me, but I reasoned 
with myself that she really just seemed to be crazy. That I had a knife, I could defend myself. In the end though it came down to the fact that I needed to try and put a stop to this madness. I had to be proactive. So I picked myself and set forth once more.

I ventured ahead in the woman’s direction, my eyes scanning all around me every few seconds. The woods felt alive around me. Not just alive, like they were watching me, calculating me. I could see the Den clearly in my mind, those planks of wood nailed together and against a few tree trunks. I had to reach it. Only there would I find an end to all of this, I knew somehow in my heart. 

After another minute of creeping forward, I came across something lying in the woods that struck me profoundly. It was something that, in all truth, had no right sitting on the forest floor behind my old elementary school. And yet, it felt like it belonged there somehow. It was a bed, and one that I recognised instantly - a red racecar bed that I’d seen many a time in my childhood. It was Cody’s red racecar bed, now damaged with wood rot, covered in moss and ivy but. The paint was flaking off it, and one wheel was missing. I read the sticker covering the headboard. 

“SPEED DEMON”.

As I stared transfixed at it, I got a flash of memory like lightning shooting through my skull. I remembered vividly. I was maybe eight or nine, at Cody’s house for a sleepover. We were bouncing up and down on the red racecar bed, laughing with each other about some nonsense. Suddenly, outside the bedroom window, we heard a man screaming in what sounded like extreme agony. His vocal cords sounded to be ripping through his screeches of pain. And then, we heard words in his screams. 

“OUR FATHER, WHO ART IN HEAVEN - HALLOWED BE THY NAME -“

The man continued wailing the Lord’s Prayer between sobs as me and Cody stared at each other, white-faced. Even the man’s words of pain sounded like they were coming from someone being tortured. My skin erupted into goosebumps just remembering it.

And here’s the kicker. Despite how vividly I remembered it, that couldn’t have happened. Because I met Cody in college. We never knew each other as children! And I’d never seen this racecar bed before in my life. I shared a bunk bed with Luke as a kid. Why the fuck did I recognise the decaying wood of this bed so intimately? These weren’t my memories. This wasn’t my life. 

I shambled forward and away from the bed, almost dropping the knife again. I felt nauseous. I saw another cluster of frogspawn forming a pool within a divot in the ground. Glancing at the little orbs, the tadpoles floating within them as I staggered forward, hey reminded me of cells. My mind went back to Luke’s cancer. If cells can multiply wrong, can memories? I don’t know. I still don’t know.

In the distance, I could see the Den coming into view. I was surprised to see it still standing. The same little hideout, all these years later, nothing really more than a box made out of nailed together planks of wood sitting alone in the woods. And outside the door, I saw the woman. 

She was sitting there amongst the tall grass, and she was clutching the mangled remains of the Jackal’s body. She held it up to her face and gnawed on it like a rabid animal. Brandishing the knife I took baby steps towards her. She barely payed me any notice though. Her teeth were shattered in places, circuit boarding and wires jutting from her bleeding gums. I tried to get her attention. I could barely stand to look at her, but I didn’t want to have to use the knife.

“HEY!” I yelled. “What the hell’s going on? Look at me!” She didn’t make any movements, but she started muttering something to herself. It was in another language though. Sounded sort of like “Hettish brining tide” to me. If anyone can make any sense of that, clue me in. I only remember it so vividly because she kept repeating under her breath, no matter what I said to her. When I took a final step towards her, though, her head snapped around and she fucking hissed, then fixed me with the most hate-filled look I’ve ever experienced. She smiled that smile of blood and copper wiring as I flinched back in fear. Then she started screaming at me. 

“GET OUT!”

I was too scared to speak. She kept screaming at me. 

“GET OUT GET OUT GET OUT!”

As she screamed, she started beating herself across the face with what was left of the Jackal’s body. I couldn’t believe my eyes. She just kept beating herself and screaming until her screams were more gurgles than words and the front of her skull was more flesh than face and then she collapsed, lifeless. 

I took a deep breath before stepping over the woman’s body and into the Den. This is what it had all led up to.

In the glow of my phone’s flashlight, Cody was the first thing I saw. Cody, lying on the floor, just about fitting within the structure. Cody, with his head seemingly shaven and his skin pale and sickly. Cody, dead, undoubtedly dead. I checked for a pulse. Cody was dead. And he was dressed up in the bear costume he got in the mystery box weeks ago, the same one we dumped at a landfill site that same day. I could see places where it had been sewn into his skin. I almost threw up several times. 

His left hand was clasped around a small, leather pocket book with “Bible” crudely written on the cover in sharpie. I flicked through the book. The pages were filled with a child’s drawings of things like dogs, monsters, transformers and whatnot. I recognised most of them as Luke’s. Some of them I saw every day for years since Mom had them pinned up on our fridge. I closed the book, disgusted. I checked Cody’s pulse again and again he was dead. Then I shone the flashlight around the rest of the den. 

Almost every square inch of the walls was covered in photographs of Luke. Hundreds of them, most of which I’d never even seen before. Some of them were in black and white and many of them pictured Luke with strange people I didn’t recognise at all. Two or three of them I saw showed Luke with Cody. How is that possible? And on every single photo, *”INRI”* was written. With nothing else to do, I took a few photos for evidence, then stepped back outside and called the police.

That was a few days ago. I feel like I’m starting to get reacquainted with reality at last, so that’s something. When I stepped back out of the Den, it felt like some curse had been lifted. Like I was finally waking up from a deep, deep sleep. Like my thoughts were finally my own again.

The police took a while to arrive. I hid the knife and made up some story about just being out for a nighttime walk or something but they seemed to buy it. They sent me home pretty swiftly. I got a call back a day later updating me. The man introduced himself as Officer Peters and informed me that, following the autopsies, it seemed like I was no longer a suspect as the wounds on the woman had been determined to have been self inflicted, and her DNA had been found all over Cody’s body. He told me that they had no idea how or why yet, but Cody’s autopsy found that he had been put through intense levels of chemotherapy sometime preceding his death.

As for the woman’s identity, they were able to match her DNA to old dental records, revealing her to be one Whitney Normanson, a missing person since 1999. I got a chill hearing that.

That’s more or less it. I’m in a clearer state of mind now. Things seem back to normal, or as close to it as possible. I’ve really just been mourning Cody and re-mourning Luke. No more teddy bears appearing. No more impossible memories surfacing. I visited Ellen and Annie yesterday and they were perfectly normal again. We had a pleasant, if a bit uncomfortable on my part, catch-up chat. I realised on the drive over that I still owed Annie a birthday present. I opted for a doll this time, though.

There’s just one strange thing I’ll leave you all with. I’ve done enough digging for one lifetime. I just want to bury this all and move on. So - last night, in one final attempt to find answers, I set out to check all the sites on the Den one last time. But I couldn’t find the Den. It was as if the website had just vanished. The Jackal’s webpage? Also missing. I checked my email, and there was no sign of that blank address anywhere in any of my inboxes.

As a final resort, I scrolled back through my old discord messages with Cody until I reached the link he sent me to the Den weeks ago, the link that me clicking on plunged my life into a surreal nightmare. And now, I clicked the link again hoping to finally put this bizarre period of my life to a close. The link didn’t take me to the Den - but it wasn’t a dead link, either. No, it took me somewhere. 

Somehow, the link had redirected me to Luke’s online obituary, the one my mother set up on Legacy.com in the weeks following Luke’s passing. In the condolences section, mixed in with all the platitudes and prayers from distant relative and family friend’s, was a message from user W. Normanson, posted on the one year anniversary of Luke’s death.

*”Missing you more and more every single day. Rest in peace beautiful angel, INRI.”*
