I disappeared on a Wednesday.  
I woke up on a Sunday.

I do not remember anything from those four days. Just the cold. Wet soil under my hands. My legs wouldn't move. I tried to scream, but no sound came out. Something was dragging me, turning me over, pulling me through the dirt. I was half awake, half dreaming, and most of it is just gone.

When I finally woke up, I was back in the house I’d rented. Everything was upside down. The floor was covered in mud. Deep scratches ran along the walls. My hair was tangled with thorns, my nails broken to the skin.

At the doorstep there were three footprints. Bare, thin, too long. They led toward the forest and disappeared into it.

Then I heard her.  
A woman's voice - soft, slow, cold. Beautiful and terrifying. She was singing without words, calling my name. I wanted to run, but the sound of that voice held me frozen in place.

I tried to get up. My legs shook. No voice came out of me. The song grew closer.

In the corner of the room I saw three shapes. Pale. Long hair. They didn't walk, they slid across the floor. The pressure on my chest grew heavier - cold, invisible. I tried to move, but my body wouldn't obey.

When I came to, it was morning. I was lying on the doorstep, barefoot and covered in mud. My arms and legs were marked with long, curved scratches - like claws, but not from any animal I know. The mirror by the door was fogged. In the condensation, three faces took shape: white, featureless, smiling in a way no human ever could.

And in one voice they whispered:  
"Come back."

The fog crept through the room. The song grew louder. I could feel them inside me - a weight pressing down on every muscle, every breath. My hair lifted on its own, as if invisible hands were tugging at it.

I tried to scream. Nothing came out. I tried to stand. I couldn't.

I don't sleep anymore.  
Every night I hear that same song. Every night I hear a voice calling my name.  
And I know that if I don't go back… they'll come for me themselves.
