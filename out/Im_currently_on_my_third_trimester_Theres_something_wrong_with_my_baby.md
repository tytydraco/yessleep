Can someone help me? I originally posted this somewhere else, but it was removed.

I don't know what to do. I'm terrified.

Three days ago, my ultrasound messed up, or *something* messed up.

The screen was glitching, and I swear it looked like my baby was appearing and then disappearing.

According to the ultrasound, I was:

Pregnant.

*Not pregnant*.

Pregnant.

*Not pregnant*.

Pregnant.

However, this was impossible because I was very clearly pregnant. 

I was/am in my third trimester.

My belly is swollen like a goddamn balloon.

I expected the nurse to have some kind of answer, but from the pale look on her face as she performed my ultrasound after once again checking my stomach, a sickly feeling coiled in the pit of my gut.

“Sorry,” she said, her eyes glued to the display. She had a nervous habit of biting her nails. “I think there's a problem with the output.”

The nurse called for a technician, who arrived quickly and confirmed there was nothing wrong.

I caught the frantic look between them, the two of them trying to justify the problem with big words I didn't fully understand.

“Oh, it's probably some kind of fault,” she said. “It's no problem. It's just the monitor.”

She kept smiling and laughing, but every time her sharp manicure pricked my belly, I realized she was trembling.

She tried again when I was getting restless.

The ice-cold jelly on my skin was starting to dry.

The nurse applied more, and I had to bite back a hiss. She didn't need *more*.

This woman was stalling for whatever reason, and it was driving me insane.

“All right!” She began the scan once more, and my baby appeared again.

I had been in love with my son ever since I first saw him. He was my baby.

And yet, in front of me, I watched him disappear from view. 

Pregnant.

*Not pregnant*.

The nurse’s smile faded. “I'm sorry, I'm not sure I understand,” she whispered, checking and rechecking the monitor. 

“Your son was just in *this* position,” she prodded at a printout, her hands visibly shaking, “but now he's… um…”

She never finished her sentence, chewing on her thumbnail.

“Alex, can you, um, call the technician again?” she asked the male assistant, who, until that moment, had been staring at my belly with wide eyes.

He was young for an assistant, maybe a little older than me.

I had to wonder why he chose this job when all he did was stare at women’s bellies like a fucking alien was about to rip through my stomach.

He blinked, running his hands through his hair. 

“Uh, yes!” he said, nodding like he understood, but he was still staring at me, his gaze flitting back and forth between the screen and my stomach.

Before he left, though, the assistant paused in the doorway.

He was staring down at the printouts of my ultrasound, flipping through them.

I could see him very obviously on his phone. 

*“Alex,”* the nurse scolded, and he scurried away, muttering a quick, “Sorry.”

I took the opportunity to sit up, nausea twisting in my gut. 

I pulled down my shirt, cringing at the feeling of the dried jelly still staining my skin.

"I'm sorry, is there some kind of problem?" I managed to get out through my teeth.

My third trimester had been bearable so far. I’m only 21, and my pregnancy was a mistake, but I wanted to keep him.

His father ran off the second I told him I was pregnant.

He didn't want anything to do with our son.

But my baby was something I could hold onto. It wasn't ideal…being in college and pregnant.

The people I lived with were all students, but they did their best to be the best aunts and uncles, clearing out the spare room for my son. I was so thankful for them.

But when I was told there were “irregularities” and that I would need extra scans, I felt like my world was ending.

I wasn't even told what the irregularities were.

According to the nurses at the clinic, “something was strange” about my son’s position.

Whatever that meant.

Look, all I want is to be a mommy. I've known that since I was a little kid.

I was so close to seeing my son, and yet, on the screen in front of me, the stupid scanner wouldn't even display my baby.

He was there, and then he wasn't.

I was pregnant, and then I *wasn't*, according to the screen.

Being in that room was becoming unbearable.

After almost an hour of what I can only describe as either me losing my mind or the people who were supposed to be looking after me being completely incompetent, I was at my limit.

Once the nurse and her assistant were sure the monitor was actually working, she scanned me again, and to my delight, there he was, stable on the screen this time.

I could have sobbed.

He looked fine.

My son looked like any other baby should at 30 weeks. 

Trust me, I've been driving myself crazy asking ChatGPT/Google a multitude of questions concerning my baby's growth.

He looked fine.

He looked healthy.

So I couldn't understand why my nurse looked so pale.

She had gone through three different hairstyles since I entered the room.

Initially, her dark hair was pinned into a ponytail.

But the more sickly she looked, the more I noticed her unconsciously tearing it out, ripping out the ponytail, leaving it hanging in her face, and then twisting it into a side plait.

Her expressions were off-putting. It's like she looked like she wanted to *run*. 

“Is he… okay?” I broke the silence, swallowing my own cry of doubt. 

The nurse turned to me with a wide (definitely fake) smile.

I think she was about to say something along the lines of “Yes! Your baby is perfectly healthy!”

But she was staring at my belly, her bottom lip wobbling.

I was used to my belly moving like that, but apparently, according to her, it was abnormal.

Ever since I got pregnant, or more appropriately, started to show, I began to notice my stomach inflating and deflating.

I figured it was normal. But now I wasn't sure. 

The nurse was still staring, unblinking, and she looked like she might speak.

Then Alex, who had been standing in the doorway on his phone, collapsed.

I don't think the nurse saw the way his body twitched, his eyes flickering. He was staring at his phone, clearly trying to keep it out of view, before his whole face went… 

Slack. 

The nurse had her back turned, searching for my medical notes.

He just dropped to the ground, his eyeballs rolling back.

The guy wasn't even unconscious.

I think the two of us were too startled to react, before she snapped out of it and hurried over.

“Alex?” The nurse pulled him onto her lap, gently slapping his face.

I sat up to try and help, and my son kicked, this time violently. Hard enough to make me feel like I was going to puke.

Alex was still awake, but his eyes were half-lidded, rolling back in their sockets, his lips parted like he was trying to speak.

“Alex? Hey! Sweetie, can you look at me?” the nurse whispered, her voice shaking when she called out to her colleagues. “Call an ambulance!”

Alex’s head hung in her grasp, limp, drool seeping down his chin.

His early diagnosis, when paramedics arrived, was a stroke.

But I was pretty sure the symptoms of a stroke included a drooping face and an inability to speak.

Alex was just slumped against the wall, drooling, staring wide eyed, at *nothing*. 

When the nurse tried to steady him, his head kept falling forward.

When the paramedics carried him out, I thought I was going to puke. 

I asked if my baby was okay, and the nurse hesitated, her frantic eyes darting back and forth, before she forced a grin.

I was getting really tired of her failed attempts to reassure me.

"Uh, yes!” she said, her lipstick smile straining. “Your baby is… perfectly healthy!"

I think she just wanted me out of there.

Luckily, when I stepped outside to get some air, Alex was sitting on a bench.

His head was between his knees, and it sounded like he was having a panic attack.

I asked if he was okay, but he didn't lift his head.

“Stay… the… fuck away from me,” he gasped out, his voice breaking into sobs.

He left me feeling almost hollow, like I’d done something wrong. 

I told this to my friend (and roommate) Noah, who was nice enough to buy me lunch.

I called him, hysterical, and he left class to pick me up.

He took me to a café, and after a coffee and more furious Googling on my phone, I had calmed myself down.

The café was mostly empty, and I appreciated the plant theme. Noah sat across from me, slurping his milkshake.

He rested his chin on his fist, eyebrows furrowing. "Okay, but saying you're pregnant/not pregnant is worrying," he muttered, waving his straw. “So, the male assistant just collapsed out of nowhere?”

I nodded, picking at my chocolate cookie. I wasn't hungry.

I told him it was a suspected stroke, but the guy was completely *fine* .

“Sounds like he fainted? I dunno, man, maybe he had low blood sugar?” Noah shrugged, shooting the waitress a wide smile when she set down his salad.

“Thank *you*.”

I couldn't help but notice her hovering over him, a very obvious blush speckling her cheeks.

I wasn't really surprised. Noah was a looker.

He was a breath of fresh air—a college friend and roommate with impeccable hair, thick brown curls sticking up in every direction as if he’d just rolled out of bed.

His sense of humor was as dry as his fashion choices were questionable: a threadbare shirt over jeans, paired with socks and sandals.

“You're fine.” Noah wore a wide, reassuring smile that loosened the knot in my gut. He reached forward and snatched my cookie. “Your son is a-okay, dude.” He took a bite of the cookie, spraying crumbs everywhere.

"It's not your fault the equipment is faulty and bro fuckin' faints.”

“Right.” I told myself, trying to convince myself it was just a coincidence. 

Noah gestured at me with the prongs of his fork. “See? You're okay, Thea.” He gestured for me to take deep breaths. 

“Just breathe, okay?” 

I did, inhaling and exhaling, until he was satisfied. 

“So, you left before I could give you a ride this morning,” Noah jumped into the conversation as usual. “Tessa is working tonight, and Harry is still…” he scrunched up his nose, “Well, he's… just being *Harry.*”

I was surprised when my baby kicked.

Noah started hacking away at his salad, forking up mouthfuls of pasta. “You forgot to do the washing up. So, I had to do them.”

Washing up wasn't my top priority at that moment.

Noah, however, was a clean freak.

His grin was teasing, but he looked pissed. “Pregnancy doesn't exclude you from washing up your own dirty dishes ya know.”

I had an appetite again, picking at the cookie. “Tessa is going to murder me.”

“No, *I'm* going to murder you,” Noah scoffed, getting salad dressing all over his chin. He was a messy eater. “You're going to be a mom soon. You can't keep all your meals literally rotting under your bed—”

When Noah’s grip slackened on his fork, freezing mid-chew, a single piece of pasta sliding down his chin, I thought he was screwing around.

But then his head dipped forward, suddenly, knocking his milkshake across the table.

I grabbed his face before he could smack nose-first into his salad, and when I looked at him, his eyes were rolling back, lips parting and then squeezing together.

When I managed to force his head up, his eyes were open, but it was like he wasn't seeing me. His gaze was lazy and slow, unfocused eyes drinking me in.

I immediately asked for help, and the waitress was quick to call an ambulance.

“Noah?” I had to hold his head up.

His whole body was wrong—like it was limp, like he didn't understand his limbs, like he was boneless, his body more liquid than solid.

His hands fell to his sides, his head dropping into my hands.

I watched his fingers twitch, curling into fists before slowly finding his mouth and sucking on them.

The waitress distanced herself when he started drooling, lips breaking into a grin.

When he toppled off his chair, curling into himself, the waitress started shooting me odd looks, like I was somehow involved.

I had to keep telling her that whatever was happening wasn't a prank.

Noah wasn't trying to scare her. He clearly needed help.

I was embarrassed, and it was hard enough helping him while pregnant.

“Noah!” I couldn't resist a shriek, my voice shuddering.

My belly kicked again, this time hard enough to hurt. I felt my son more than I ever had before, his violent kicking sending waves of agony across my gut.

I was ready to grab and carry my roommate out of there, since we had already garnered an audience with their phones out, when Noah’s body jerked.

His head snapped us, half lidded eyes finding me.

He stared down at his hands slimy with his own saliva, before jumping to unsteady feet, and stumbling back, knocking a chair over. “What the *fuck*.”

He kept saying it, over and over and over again, his voice scrambling into a shriek. 

I tried to follow him, but he kept taking steps back. 

Like he was fucking *scared* of me. 

He didn't say anything else, staggering out of the door, walking straight into someone

Noah didn't come back. 

I went home, and Tessa, my roommate, was in the kitchen cooking dinner. 

Harry, my other roommate, was still in bed. He'd been in bed for a while.

I heard Noah sneak in around midnight. Drunk. 

He announced his presence, “Hello fuckers” before slamming his bedroom door shut. 

I texted him: are you okay? What happened earlier????? 

But the message didn't deliver. 

Later that night, I slept with my hands cradling my baby.

I sang to him, promising he was loved. 

Beautiful. 

All I want is my son to be born healthy. 

And holding my belly, I could trick myself into believing he was in my arms.

When I woke, however, it was silent. 

I couldn't feel the warmth of my bedsheets and my pillows. 

Instead, I felt like I was floating. 

And around me, a slow, gentle ba-bump sound. 

It was so warm, and yet I couldn't stretch out my body. I was stuck, curled into myself, and I couldn't scream. 

I had a mouth, but I couldn't move it. 

I couldn't fucking scream. 

Something was very fucking wrong. 

Something was wrapped around me, enveloping me, suffocating me. 

I felt like I was swimming, but there was no surface, no breakthrough where I could breathe, and somehow, I didn't need to breathe. 

I knew I HAD to, but every time I panicked and thought I was going to suffocate, nothing happened. 

Oh, god. I was *drowning*.

I kicked, but I couldn't move.

I kicked again.

And again.

I couldn't move, stuck in the same position, my body felt twisted and wrong. 

I don't know how long I was stuck. How long I couldn't breathe for. 

It felt like a fucking eternity, and just the thought of it gives me a panic attack. 

I can't remember when whatever it was let me go. I woke up face down on my carpet, in a fresh puddle of drool. 

I immediately checked my belly. He seems fine. He was still kicking. 

When I tried to open my door, it was locked. 

I pounded my fists against it, already panicking. 

“What did you do to Harry?”

Noah was on the other side, his voice different. Colder. 

I found my voice. “What are you talking about?”

“Harry.” Noah said through his teeth. “Look, Thea, I'm trying here,” he whispered. “But after what you did to me yesterday, and whatever the fuck happened to Harry—”

“Don't speak to her like that,” Tessa hissed. “Uh, this is just a precaution, all right?”

Precaution? 

“What happened to Harry?” I demanded, surprised, when my son gave me a morning kick.

I felt like I was being beaten up. 

“Oh, *Harry*?” Noah spluttered. “Do you mean the guy rolling around in his bed, who won't say a fucking word?” he groaned. “Okay, we can fix this. I'm looking for help. You're going to be okay. Just, stay there until we’ve figured this out, all right?”

They brought me food throughout the day, but kept their distance. 

Noah produced handcuffs from his jeans, and Tessa slapped them out of his hands. 

Look, I can understand they're scared. I am too. 

Something is *wrong* with me. Whatever happened last night, I thought it was a dream. 

But there are scratches all over my face, like I've clawed at my own skin. 

I wasn't fucking dreaming. I was somewhere else.

With a heartbeat.

Somewhere like I was swimming?? I just remember being warm, and there was a heartbeat. And I couldn't breathe. 

I’m terrified something is wrong with my baby. 

Please tell me I'm wrong*

I have so many questions, but I'm terrified. 

Whatever this thing is, it affects predominantly *males*, as well as me. 

Why *just* males? 

Edit: I just got a call from the clinic. The nurse said *twins*. 

I keep calling the others, but there's no answer. The door is locked.

The nurse said that's the reason why there's irregularities. 

But twins? 

How is this even fucking possible?

Edit 2:

The kicking is getting worse. Im in so much pain please hkep me. 

Is it normal for my son to be kicking THIS violently?
