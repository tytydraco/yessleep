I live alone. It's a quiet existence, for the most part. Just me, my apartment, and the occasional visit from family or friends who never seem to stay long enough to make it feel like home. I'm used to the solitude. It's comfortable, in a way.

There's a mirror in the hallway, right next to the bathroom door. It's an old thing, a relic from when I first moved in. The previous tenant must have left it behind, and after a couple of weeks of hesitation, I decided to hang it up. It didn't seem important at the time. A mirror’s a mirror, right? Just something you glance into to check your appearance. Nothing more.

But recently, something’s been off.

At first, it was subtle—little things I shrugged off as tricks of the light or my own tired mind. I’d catch glimpses of myself in the reflection when walking past. Sometimes my reflection seemed to linger a fraction longer than it should, or the angle would be off, like the mirror was playing with the image.

Last night, it happened again.

I was getting ready for bed, the usual routine—brush my teeth, change into pajamas, turn off the lights. As I passed by the hallway mirror on my way to my bedroom, I looked up. And that’s when I saw it. My reflection… *wasn’t mine.*

It was still me, of course, but there was something *wrong*. My reflection was... distorted. A shadow, not quite right. The way it moved, the way it stood—it was as if it were mimicking me, but with a slight delay, as though it was watching me before responding. I stopped in my tracks, staring at it, my pulse racing.

At first, I thought it was just the dim lighting playing tricks on me. Maybe I was just exhausted. I turned around and walked away, but the feeling didn’t go. I could feel my own reflection pulling at me, like it was still there, staring at me from the corner of my eye.

I’ve been avoiding it since. I don’t walk past it unless I absolutely have to. And even then, I make sure to keep my eyes forward, because something about it… it just doesn’t *feel* right.

The worst part? I think it’s *watching* me now.

The reflection in the mirror doesn’t just mimic my movements anymore. It feels like it *knows* what I’m going to do before I do it. When I stand in front of it, it smiles before I do. It raises its eyebrows, tilts its head, and sometimes even gives me a look like it knows a secret I’m too scared to learn.

The other night, I couldn’t sleep. The apartment was dead silent, except for the hum of the fridge in the kitchen. I found myself standing in front of the mirror again. I don’t even remember walking up to it. But there I was, staring into it, just… watching.

I looked at myself, trying to steady my breath, but then I saw it. The reflection wasn’t smiling anymore. It was grinning, wide and unnaturally, the edges of its mouth stretching too far, too wide, like it was made of something that wasn’t flesh. I froze.

I didn’t move. I didn’t want to. I was too scared to blink, to turn away. The reflection’s eyes were locked on me, wide and unblinking, and I swear to God, I could feel its gaze even when I closed my own eyes.

That’s when I saw it—a shadow, blacker than the night around it, creeping in from the sides of the mirror. At first, it was just a sliver, but as I watched, it grew, stretching across the surface like some kind of crawling thing, something that didn’t belong in the reflection.

I turned and bolted for my bedroom, heart pounding in my chest. I tried to forget it. I convinced myself it was a trick of the light, some weird hallucination, maybe even a late-night panic attack. But now, every time I look at that hallway mirror, I feel like it’s looking back at me. Watching me.

Last night, I couldn’t sleep again. I had to pee, so I got up, and there I was, standing in front of the damn mirror once more. I looked up—against my better judgment—and I saw it again. The grin. But this time, it wasn’t just the reflection grinning. The face in the mirror *shifted*. It changed—slowly, grotesquely—until it wasn’t my face at all. It was *something else*. A hollow-eyed version of me, but something darker, more twisted.

That’s when I realized something terrifying.

It wasn’t just reflecting me. It *wanted* to be me.

The reflection started moving on its own. No longer mimicking me, it was doing its own thing. It raised a hand—no, it was reaching for me. It started tapping the glass, slowly, methodically. The sound was soft at first, like a knock, then louder, more insistent. And then—*then*, I saw it. The reflection stepped forward, as if trying to climb out of the mirror.

I don’t know how long I stood there, but it felt like hours. I could hear my own heartbeat in my ears, the only sound in the world besides the tapping. I don’t even remember how I got back to my bedroom, but when I woke up this morning, I knew something had changed.

The reflection in the hallway mirror is different now. It’s more… alive. It moves when I don’t. It smiles when I don’t. It watches, waits.

I don’t want to go near it again. I don’t even want to look in its direction, but it’s there, just across the hall, and it’s always waiting for me.

I don’t know how long I have before it gets me. But I know it’s coming.

And when it does, I’m afraid I’ll be nothing but a shadow in the glass.

I think it’s already started. The reflection doesn’t just move on its own anymore. It *feels* like it's pulling me in.

And I don't know how much longer I can resist.
