"Say Hi To Mr. Tuttles!"

The caption was in bright block letters. Underneath the caption, the poster had a picture of a cartoon clown waving and smiling at you. My friend Tony and I exchanged glances. It wasn't unusual for our apartments to put up posters of events going on in town on the corkboard by our mailboxes, but this poster didn't seem to have any information about where this event or show was happening.

"Do you think they forgot to tell us how to get tickets? Not that I'd want to." Tony laughed at the poster, "God look at the clown's outfit and makeup, it's so ridiculous.".

I snorted and looked at the clown seemingly smiling so much he was in pain. "I don't know man, I'd be up to see Mr. Tuttles if they had any details, my guess is it's an ironic thing - it's so comically happy it's probably dark humor. Maybe it's a pop-up we'll see randomly?"

Tony shrugged, "Maybe".

We live in a mountain town about 40 minutes outside of Seattle, and the town has all kinds of eclectic and weird pop-ups, walking through our quaint little 'downtown' you never know what you're going to find. We left the poster behind and went about our day. Tony worked in the next town over, so I left him at the bus stop, and I headed to my job in a real-estate office in our tiny downtown.

I didn't think much more of Mr. Tuttles until I got home that night.

When I got home I saw someone had pushed a piece of paper under my door. I assumed it was a flyer for some new delivery place or whatever. When I opened my door I picked up the folded paper and had a look. It was another poster for Mr. Tuttles, with another big "Say Hi To Mr. Tuttles!" caption across the top.

This time the clown was leaning against a chair. The clown was still smiling, but the smile had a sharper edge, like the mean smile of someone who has gotten away with something. My blood chilled as I saw that in the chair sat a cartoony depiction of Tony, tied up, gagged, and with bruises. It was a cartoon, but still was unmistakably Tony.

Below the picture was a note handwritten in elegant cursive "Mr. Tuttles Doesn't Appreciate Being Laughed At, Only With!"

I hoped it was just a prank, but I tried to call Tony and couldn't get through. I called the police, and they took a report and said they are not aware of anyone named "Mr. Tuttles." They couldn't find Tony at his apartment or his work, nor at any of his usual haunts around town. They told me they'd look for him and scour the area, but think that maybe this is just Tony pranking me. I wasn't so sure.

As worried as I am, that's not what brought me to post here. It's what I found this morning.

When I was leaving for work today, I found a poster on the inside of my door. The poster had "Say Hi Mr. Tuttles" in bright block letters across the top, just like the other posters. Below the title was a cartoon clown winking at the camera as he chased a pig with a human face. It took me only a moment to recognize it.

It was my face.

At the bottom of the poster was a note handwritten in elegant cursive: "Mr. Tuttles hates squealers - he'll be saying hi to you real [soon](https://www.reddit.com/r/ByAbraxas/)!"
