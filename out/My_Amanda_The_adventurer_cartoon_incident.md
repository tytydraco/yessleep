This story is about my experience with "Amanda The Adventurer cartoon" and how it changed me from a simple innocent child to a traumatized teen.

(Let's begin!)





Back in my day, there was a cartoon called "Amanda The Adventurer". It was so popular at my time. Every child including me loved it. I would go every day to my grandparent's house to watch it on their vhs player. Everything was so perfect and innocent. The episodes were so funny and wholesome! Until one day, everything changed...

My parents dropped me off at my grandparent's house and went to the airport. They were both doctors and had a business conference in Russia. They had to attend it. I said my goodbyes and watched them drive away from there. I went inside and met my grandparents. They made it for me welcoming cookies and they were so happy with me, I was too!. We ate dinner and talked then they went to sleep. But for me, I was just starting the night. I grabbed my backpack and took the VHS tapes of every cartoon show I love. But I loved "Amanda The Adventurer" so much and decided to watch it all night!. I was so happy and had my snacks with me, everything was so perfect!.

What could go wrong??!...
--------------------

Same day at 2:23 am:


I was watching the cartoon show and began to get sleepy but I had to finish watching it, otherwise, I won't sleep well.

But something weird happened, I thought I was hallucinating and just dreaming, I wasn't...
-----------------------
Amanda, the Cartoon main character began talking to me as if she is speaking to me through the tv screen. She was asking me to help her find her missing friend Wooly the sheep, I didn't reply at first but then, she suddenly called out my name and shouted at me:
 "ANSWER MY QUESTION".

I felt a feeling of dread and I was scared but I decided to help her in her cartoon adventure. I replied:
Amanda, go check the neighborhood.

The tv went off for a second and suddenly... Amanda is in the neighborhood! but wait... that neighborhood seems familiar... 

I didn't care that much and began helping her

------------------------------------------------------

By answering her questions through the screen, she began walking around the neighborhood, entering shops, and asking for her friend. For me, I was just watching her, on my tv walking around and around. I thought that was the new episode. 

I was wrong...
----------------------------
Amanda arrived at the candy shop and found her friend Wooly! She thanked me for helping her and the credits began to roll. I thought I was a superhero and I just helped a tv cartoon character. The show ended and the VHS tape came out. I was so interested in watching the other vhs tape. I put it in and played it.

The episode was called:

(Oh-no!, An accident!)



But something was off, the episode starts with no music like usual, and suddenly a severe weather alert appears and says:

The National Weather Alert System (T.N.W.A.S) has detected a possible Thunderstorm threat for your AREA, Please Remain indoors.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

That's weird, (I said). Indeed there was a storm outside, but this is the first time a severe weather alert note appear in a VHS player. I thought it was just an alert or something related to the cartoon.

The episode began with Wooly standing still in a playground. Like if he was waiting for the episode to start. When he noticed it, he said his intro but in a scared-stuttered voice, then he ran to the camera and said to me:

Whatever you do, Don't-
-----------------------------------------

"Distorted sounds are heard and the screen glitched for 2 seconds".


And out of no-where Amanda appeared and Wooly is now on the floor crying, hurt in his knees with blood all over it.


Amanda said:

Oh no! Wooly is hurt! He had an accident!

Then she began to explain what's the meaning of an  accident in a creepy-Distorted voice tone, 

She also said:

"An accident can happen in your house or school or the playground, it can even happen to you!"

------------------------------------‚Äê---------------------------------------------


I was confused because the cartoon shouldn't have any blood or injured people in it as it's for little kids like me (6-14 years old age acceptance).


I didn't care and continued watching. 2 minutes later, Amanda started asking me again to help Wooly, but this time she had that creepy smile on her face. I was terrified of her and couldn't say a word. She then went angry and said: WHY AREN'T YOU ANSWERING ME, DON'T YOU WANT TO HELP Wooly?...
She was mad at me for not answering her, since when do cartoon characters get angry or even talk to us through a VHS player? I decided to turn off the episode and go to sleep, I was mistaken.


I couldn't either pull the vhs tape out or even turn off the tv screen. 

And while I was trying to end this, Amanda was humming in a low-creepy tone while staring at me...

She was staring at me as if she were behind the screen glass. 

I began to cry a little as I was terrified by that scene.

An innocent cartoon character is watching me...
------------------

Suddenly, Amanda grabbed a knife and stabbed Wooly, she stabbed him in his stomach and pulled his intestines out while laughing hysterically with her cartoon music but it was creepier, 
I was so traumatized and took my baseball bat and smashed the tv screen. 

It's over now.. no more Amanda the Adventurer, I said. 

3 seconds later, I could hear Amanda's voice in my room saying: 
Did.. you..enjoy.. the.. episode...


My room lights went out.


"Amanda the adventurer" is in the room with me.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After my room went dark, I tried to search for the flashlight that I put near my backpack. I found it but it was low on batteries but it could hold on for a bit. I tried seeing around my room with the flashlight and I didn't see any presence of Amanda or something in my room. I decided to go to my grandparent's room and tell them about what happened. They didn't believe me at the first time but in the middle of our talking, we heard something break downstairs. My grandpa didn't dare to go down because if there was a burglar or something we don't want them to escape away. So he locks his room door where we stayed in and called the cops. We waited for the cops to arrive but no one arrived. We could still hear something or someone walking around the house while humming a weird song. But for me, I began to concentrate on that humming sound and realized that it was. Amanda's cartoon theme..., So the person or the thing walking in our house downstairs is Amanda or something related to her.



After 1 hour and a half:
------------------------------------

The police arrived in our neighborhood, we told them the whole story and showed them the sign of a break-in. They searched for 2 hours around the neighborhood and the forest. But they couldn't find anything. They said they would close the case and told us to destroy all the VHS tapes that are related to this incident including Amanda The Adventurer cartoon. After this night, The news announced that the creator of Amanda The Adventurer cartoon show was found dead in his apartment at 4:31 am, stabbed in his neck. Since this night, the show has been closed off forever. And for me, I was traumatized by this night. I told myself that, I wouldn't watch old cartoon vhs tapes ever again.
