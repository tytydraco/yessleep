I’ve always wondered what I would do if I knew I was about to die. Perhaps I’d consider the knowledge a gift, a chance to spend my final moments deliberately and meaningfully. Perhaps I’d go mad and use the opportunity to do something terrible without consequences. Rob a bank. Burn down a schoolhouse.

This morning, that hypothetical became my reality, when [two witches predicted my death](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1hw4719/two_witches_told_me_how_i_would_die_but_they/). One  warned me that I would meet my end today due to spotlights on a blue stage.

As it turns out, I am no more and no less than an absolute coward. I ran straight home and called in sick to my job as a stage technician.

“I, uh - *cough* \- have terrible diarrhea. I’m, like, pooping right now.”

“We’re really short-handed. Can’t you take some pepto or something?”

“Uh, I, uh, don’t have any at home, and I can’t get off the toilet. Bye!”

As soon as the call disconnected, I hauled out the suitcase from under my bed and piled in the contents of my small apartment. It took less than half an hour, including the several minutes to coax my cat, Tofu, into her carrier. By 10am, Tofu and I were on the road.

The second witch said I would die in a home invasion tonight, but what if I’m not at home?

As the sun rolled through the winter sky and my little Mazda ate hundreds of miles of asphalt, I had a lot of time to think. And maybe that “knowledge is a gift” thing was working for me after all, because I realized something about myself.

I always run. At seventeen, I ran away from home rather than tell my parents I didn’t want to become a doctor. At twenty-three, I ghosted my first and only boyfriend because I was too scared to have the break-up conversation. I’ve never been fired from a job; as soon as things get hard, I stop showing up.

And now I was running again, from the words of a couple strangers in a park. To avoid their predictions, I only needed to stay away for one night. Yet I’d packed up my entire life, just because I was so used to leaving it all behind.

As I pulled into the parking lot of a grungy Motel 6, I promised myself that I’d be a different person starting tomorrow, one that faces their problems head-on.

Before that, I need to survive tonight. I was just falling into an uneasy half-slumber when Tofu jumped on my pillow and started meowing insistently in my ear. As I sat up, I saw, through the half-closed blinds of my window, a figure in the parking lot. They were silhouetted in the moonlight, so I couldn’t make out much of their appearance except their short, muscular stature. But I could clearly see the outline of a knife in their right hand.

The figure moved toward my window, and for a heart-stopping moment, I thought that they had seen me. Instead, they turned away at the last second, and then I heard three firm knocks on the door of the room next to mine.

Through the thin wall, bedsprings creaked.

“The fuck?” someone grumbled quietly, followed by the sound of more creaking, footsteps, and a door clicking open.

“Wha -” was all my unknown neighbor got out before their words abruptly dissolved into soft gargling. Then I heard the thud of something heavy hitting the floor.

That was enough to shock me into action. I grabbed Tofu and my phone and locked myself in the bathroom. Turning the volume on my phone all the way down, I called 911.

The police should be here any minute now. My heart has been pounding through my chest, so loudly that I’m sure the intruder next door can hear it. I’ve been trying to calm down by reminding myself that I’ve already thwarted one prediction of my death. If I could avoid “spotlights double…shot on a stage of blue” by skipping work, I can stop this home invasion by calling the police. Fate isn’t so heavy.

Wait.

Oh thank god. I heard the sound of sirens, so I cracked the bathroom door and was greeted by the most welcome sight through my window.

A pair of bright headlights turning into the parking lot. A glimpse of a police officer in the driver’s seat, clad in blue.
