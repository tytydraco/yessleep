In the era of video streaming services, podcasts, and subscription-based content, there’s a lonely man playing tunes in the night. That’s me. I am that man. I’ve been a radio DJ for a few months now, and to tell you the truth, it’s pretty mundane. Night DJs are supposed to be your comfort for long night drives, people who work at night, or simply for those who can’t sleep at night.

It’s pretty routine, what I do: talking to myself for hours, playing some tunes, and checking the news and current events to talk about. We also have this line where you can call and just chat with me, explain why you chose this song request, and just simply mess around. I’m not one of those love guru DJs that give love advice and all that nonsense.

Until one night.

It was a very usual night, playing some classics and “occasionally” slipping in some banned-on-radio music. Nobody would bat an eye—most people are already asleep! After playing RATM’s “Killing In The Name,” someone called from our hotline. It was around 3 AM, and the caller sounded...weird.

The line was so distorted and muffled I didn’t understand a thing.

*kshh* “I have -” *kshh*

“Uh, sorry. Say it again?”

*kshh* “something to-” *kshh*

“Alright, I’m gonna have to drop you now. Thank you for-”

As soon as I was about to hang up the call, the line got clear.

“Play Hotel California,” the man said. “Before the song ends, there will be a blackout.” And he immediately dropped the call.

“Weird, but okay,” I said to myself, thinking it was just some prank. After all, nobody listens to the radio anymore. I obliged and played the song. The words of the caller were lost in my head, and I had completely forgotten about it.

Just as Don Felder was about to hit the first note of the solo, the whole building went dark. Could be just a coincidence, right? But I have to admit, that rattled my core a bit.

The next few nights were a bit quiet. Classic tunes, song requests, and hours of talking to myself. I started to convince myself that the incident was just an eerie coincidence. However, a few weeks later, I once again received a call. I recognized it clearly despite the distorted and muffled line.

“I have another request,” the man said. “Play Thunderstruck by AC/DC, and witness something electrifying!” and again, he immediately dropped the call.

Should I play it? Should I not? Is this another prank? Maybe. Maybe not. But in the end, curiosity got the best of me, and I played the song.

I waited as the song played, checking my surroundings wide-eyed. Minutes passed, and nothing out of the ordinary happened. Until a strong lightning strike outside and heavy rain started to pour. Lights from the booth and the whole building started to flicker ominously. How could this happen? Not wanting to know more, I immediately ended my broadcast and went straight home.

I called in sick the next night. I had to either booze myself up or pop a tab just to fall asleep.

Another night, another request.

“Play Somebody's Watching Me by Rockwell, I got my eye on you.”

I felt shivers from my head to my back, a lump forming in my throat, and couldn't help but check the windows to see a shadowy figure standing outside in the parking lot.

‘See For Miles’ by The Who brought about mysterious multicolored flashing lights in the night sky. ‘Time Is On My Side’ by The Rolling Stones was followed by all the clocks—my watch, my phone, the station's wall clock, and all the clocks in the building—stopping simultaneously while the song was playing.

But it didn't stop there. I reached a point where I would just wait and see what the song request would bring. Night after night, request after request. Same caller. Different songs. I got addicted to his game.

I became obsessed with finding out who the caller was. I pulled out the logs and traced the calls, but they seemed to come from different locations. I think I'm losing my mind.

The phone rang again, and without hesitation, I answered immediately.

“Who the fuck is this and what do you want?”

There was a brief pause, then he replied,

“I have another request. Play ‘Time’ by Pink Floyd; you'll see what I mean.”

*“Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day”*

*…*

*"You are young and life is long, and there is time to kill today”*

*…*

*"And then one day you find ten years have got behind you”*

*…*

*"The time is gone, the song is over, thought I'd something more to say”*

As it played, I started to get dizzy. The room was spinning, my vision was blurred, and I felt an eerie sensation as if I was being pulled out of myself.

When I came back to my senses, I was already at home, in my room, lying on my bed with my phone in my hand. I checked my call logs and found out it was me who was calling the station.

I had been calling myself...but how?

I looked around and saw multiple newspaper clippings, notes, and audio recordings scattered everywhere, evidence of my own obsession with the mystery caller—myself.

My heart started pounding, my mind racing. How can I not remember?

I quickly rifled through the notes, seeing entries of the songs I requested, timestamps, and locations I couldn't even recall being at. It was as if two versions of myself existed.

I glanced at the desk and saw another notebook open with repeated entries.

*“Who am I?”*

*“Why can't I remember?”*

*“Who are you?”*

*“Am I losing my mind?”*

One phrase repeated over and over:

*“I have a request.”*

My hands trembled as I played back the recordings, hearing myself predict what was going to happen next. The voice was unmistakably mine, but with a deep and ominous tone.

I dug deeper, searching for answers until I found an entry—written clearly and methodically:

*“Time distortion? Possible parallel timelines converging?”*

*…*

*“Intense focus on the show and isolation during late-night shifts created a rift in perception. Stress and sleep deprivation exacerbated the effect. Caller persona attempts to guide and warn DJ persona through the cycle, hoping to break the loop and restore coherence.”*

It was as if my mind was split into two, a desperate attempt to reach out from one version of myself to another, trying to resolve the confusion and break the temporal loop that had ensnared me.

As I stared at the chaotic evidence that lay in front of me, my phone started to ring.

It was myself again.

“Play Sound of Silence by Simon and Garfunkel. Time to wake up.”

Without hesitation, I started to play the song. This was my chance to wake up and break free.

As the song started to play, I realized it was the wrong tune.

Hotel California was playing.

*…*

*“You can check out anytime you like. But you can never leave.”*
