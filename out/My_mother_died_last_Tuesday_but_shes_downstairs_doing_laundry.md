Last July, my mom got surgery to have her big toe amputated. While doing a mail run, she cut her toe. Her diabetes kept her from feeling it until the infection reached the bone. After consultations with her doctor, it was decided that her toe could not be saved. At the time, I lived almost 2,000 miles away in California. I still remember Mom asking me to keep in touch with my thirteen-year-old sister, who would be home alone for a few days while Mom recovered in the hospital. For a reason I cannot explain, I had a terrible feeling she would be in the hospital longer than expected.

“I’ll keep in touch. Of course. But maybe she should stay with her dad for a while? If something goes wrong…” I said.

She cut me off.

“Nothing will go wrong, Brady. Just keep in touch with your sister,” Mom replied.   
  
“I know but what if…” I replied.   
  
“Nothing will go wrong,” Mom snapped. “Now, I gotta go. I have surgery in the morning, and I’m already stressed. Please check in with your sister a few times per day. I’ll be back home on Wednesday. I bought her some frozen meals. She knows how to use the microwave. Please, stop freaking out.”   
  
“Okay, mom. I’ll check in,” I said, afraid to push further.

I remember hanging up the phone feeling guilty for stressing her out. I’m sure it was hard to lose a part of your body, even if it was only a toe. I also wondered if she snapped at me because I mentioned my sister staying with her dad. Their relationship was toxic. He cheated and spent little time with my sister. When he did, he would bad mouth Mom. I understood why she did not want him involved.

Unfortunately, on the day of the surgery, my worst fears were realized. Doctors did not know she had a weakened heart. When they gave her fluids pre-surgery, she had a heart attack, which sent her into heart failure. She survived, though needed assistance for basic everyday tasks. Because of this, I decided to move back home to care for her and my sister.

The following few months were rough. She developed several more infections at the amputation site. One amputation led to two and two to three, which resulted in her losing everything below the knee. Even though she never showed my sister and me how much it affected her, I would often hear her sobbing late at night before I went to bed.

She refused to give up, though, and would often attempt—against doctors' orders—to do everything she used to. My sister and I would watch as she lugged laundry baskets down the basement stairs.

“Mom, I can get that for you. Those basement stairs are steep. You’re gonna fall and hurt yourself.”

She never accepted help, though. She was a stickler for clean laundry. She always had been, but after her injuries, she became obsessive about it. I suspect this was because her clean clothes were one of the only things she could control about her body anymore. Doing laundry was one of the few things that connected her to her previous life. She would crawl up and down the basement stairs. It was inspirational considering I struggle to get my able-bodied self to do laundry–but I had a horrible feeling surrounding those stairs.

Last week, I was out with a friend when my sister called me crying. Mom had fallen down the stairs and was motionless against the concrete. My sister and I both called 911 and Mom was rushed to the hospital only a few miles down the road. Unfortunately, the fall had caused bleeding in her brain, and she succumbed to her injuries a couple days later. I was the one who made the decision to pull the plug and end her life. I’ve spent the last few days staring at the TV that used to play her favorite crime shows. Now it stares back blankly–just like me.

Her viewing is tomorrow. I am nervous about seeing her dead body again. I worry that’s how I’ll remember her. Lifeless. However, a few minutes ago I was lying here when the faint smell of lilac washed over me. Then I heard the washer turn on from downstairs. At first, I thought this was just my imagination playing tricks on me. The washer was old. Old appliances sometimes malfunction. That’s easy enough to believe.

But for the last couple minutes, I heard someone who sounded an awful lot like my mom say:

“I need to get these clothes done for tomorrow.”

...from under the floorboards.

It is followed by what sounds like someone crawling up the stairs. Then I can hear a series of crashes, like limbs slapping off the wooden stairs before a dull, sickening stop. After a couple seconds, someone—something—begins wailing in pain before the process starts all over again.

I don’t know whether to approach the basement door… or run like hell.
