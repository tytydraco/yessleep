I had taken a wildlife research gig for the woods near my town. My research partner had fallen ill, so I decided to go alone since I was just gathering samples and taking photos that day. It was getting late, and the sun hung slightly lower in the sky, so I decided to pack up and make my way out. Before I could finish gathering up my things, I heard this weird, chittering snarl.



I froze.



I couldn’t tell where it was. The sound came from no direction, and I felt it everywhere throughout my body.



Against my better judgment, I pulled out my camera.



A tapping sound came from my left, but nothing was there.



A little gust of wind pushed through me, leaving a painful knick on my shoulder.



A warm trickle rolled down my arm.



A small “ruk ruk ruk” came from where it fled to, almost like it was laughing at me.



It slammed the tree it was next to, splintering the wood in my direction.



Breaking tree by tree as it slowly got closer. Nowhere to be seen, except when it touched the tree. It was too fast to make out completely. It seemed thin and lanky with no claws, just sharp angles and the same color as the trees it destroyed.



I just left my shit where it was.



As I ran, I felt a tiny poke in the back of my neck.



I stumbled and tripped over roots and woke up in the night.



It stood over me as I woke.



I couldn’t see it, but I could feel it.



Its presence looms over me.



I could feel it staring at me.



It hit the ground next to me, showing for a split second.



The next thing I knew, I was sitting outside the forest, beside my car.



I fell asleep in the car before I could even drive off.



When I awoke, I drove myself to the hospital. My body was aching, with a splitting headache. I told the doctor what had happened, and she looked at my neck and shoulder. She bandaged up my shoulder and looked at my neck.



Because of the narcolepsy, she asked if I had someone to keep an eye on me for the next 24-48 hours.



My research partner came by, apologizing for not coming along, and stayed the night to watch over me. When we got up, he said I looked pale and offered to make breakfast.



I felt a little nauseated. I couldn’t turn my neck, but I agreed.



I vomited up the food a few hours after we ate, and my stomach ached terribly.



I asked if he could hold me as I fell asleep. He agreed to.



I woke up with my neck stuck to his mouth.



Dead.



A tendril attached me to him.



His arms and legs intertwined with mine.



With slimy, ammonia-smelling appendages wrapped around his body.



The sense of holding him hostage, like I had trapped him, flooded my mind like a predator.



We spasmed together as we merged, each convulsion fusing us closer together. It squelched like a wet constriction.



I felt full, no longer hungry.



I lay there, unable to move, glancing back and forth, panting with difficulty.



I had just met his family the other day. They knew he was coming over.



I could feel something moving inside me.
