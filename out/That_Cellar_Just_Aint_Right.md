I grew up in a rather large country home. The house was spacious with a huge, two-acre garden. It was a child’s fantasy.

The whole place was my oyster, my sanctuary. I grew up with two younger siblings – we would always play ‘Indiana Jones’ and pretend to be brave explorers going through caves and labyrinths to find lost treasure. My little brothers would always be my sidekicks, of course.

But for all our bravery during playtime, there was one part of the house we dared not venture into. It became unthinkable after a while to even consider the fact that it existed.

Hidden behind a door where mum hung her baking aprons was a flight of steps leading down to an old wine cellar. Now, naturally, being kids, our parents didn’t particularly want us sniffing around down there, not just because we were too young to bugger our livers yet but because hell hath no fury like an adult who’s just had their £1000 bottle of 1920 champagne smashed to pieces from an incident of horseplay.

And in all honesty, there’s not a lot that would have tempted us to snoop around down that wine cellar, anyway. My brothers and I seemed to instinctually avoid it, it was like an unspoken rule that there was just something wrong with it. It wasn’t just the spindly cellar spiders that hung in the corners that frightened me. It was something more otherworldly.

I think out of all of us kids, I hated that cellar the most. I remember having recurring nightmares where I’d be going down a never-ending flight of stairs to get something urgent from the cellar, only to lose my footing, fall and wake up with a horrible jolt. The one I still remember scaring me the most was being locked down there unable to escape, going through the darkness with a torch before encountering an emaciated cat with hollow eyes and a mouth twisted into a scream.

There’s one incident involving that cellar that to this day, I know I wasn’t dreaming. It’s the childhood memory that frightens me most of all.

I remember it was a brisk spring day. Mum always liked to give the house a deep clean around this time of year, and I’d always want to help out while my brothers tried to avoid doing any work at all and play Xbox instead.

As well as old vintage wines, other junk and utilities that we only used sparingly were stored down there as well. Condensation around the house the previous winter had unfortunately caused some mildew around the window frames and my mum wanted to paint over some of the more stubborn spots, so, lucky me, I was asked to be the one to be a big brave girl and go down to fetch the bucket of paint.

I’d only ever really been down in the cellar a couple of times with my parents, largely as a ‘training exercise’ to show me that there was nothing down here to be scared of, and that even the spiders were friendly. I didn’t buy it. Grown-ups can be so oblivious to the sense of danger that kids have at that age.

I hated the idea of going down those steps by myself. I held my breath as I stood in front of the door, gingerly putting my hand to the handle. A thought suddenly came to me – I was twelve years old now, a big girl. My brothers were only nine and six respectively. They probably only hated this cellar because my fear had rubbed off on them – they were counting on me, the great explorer and leader, to show them that there was nothing down here we couldn’t handle. I opened the door, pretending to not see that big spider hanging in the left corner, ducked my head down, and ventured down the stairs.

There were eight of them in total, I counted. Wooden, creaky, and particularly unhelpful to my overarching feeling of unease bubbling through my sense of bravado. But mum needed me to be brave – I’d just get the paint, not look back, get out of here as soon as I could. surely nothing down here would harm me during the day – the night was the time of the boogeymen and spooks.

I felt surprisingly triumphant when I reached the bottom. It was hard stone, solid and cold under my little shoes. The paint was in a dark corner on my right. The tiny lightbulb, that I don’t remember switching on, hung from the ceiling, lighting the centre of the cellar with the paint pot just out of its circle of illumination slightly. I cringed and held my breath again, walking slowly so as and looking about me in all directions as I knelt to grab the paint, having to stifle a shriek of terror as I inadvertently dislodged a large, black spider from his hiding place. We both scuttled away in fright in opposite directions, me not looking back once as I hurried up those wooden stairs, almost tripping on the third one before brushing myself down at the top, hoping that there were no cobwebs or spiders that had fallen on me.

I was safe. I’d made it in there and out! Catching my breath, paint pot in hand, I was feeling especially proud of myself for being so brave and having bragging rights over my younger, lazy brothers.

I hadn’t taken any more than a few steps forward when the sound of something clutching the door handle made me freeze. I hadn’t shut the door.

Very slowly, the sound of the cellar door begun to slowly creak as something forced it to move, not as if a gust of wind had compelled it, but as if somebody, something, with very little strength was pulling it towards the door frame.

The cellar door then clicked shut.
