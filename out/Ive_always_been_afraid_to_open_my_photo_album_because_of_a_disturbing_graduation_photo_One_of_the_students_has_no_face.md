I’m from East Asia, and reading the stories here reminds me of something that actually happened to me.

As the title says, I have a graduation photo from middle school.

Unlike most people who look back fondly on their school days, I have always been afraid to open that album. Specifically, I am **terrified** to look at the class group photo.

In the picture, the teachers and school administrators are seated in the front row. Behind them, the students stand on temporary two-tiered risers.

There were forty students in our class, all dressed in identical blue and white uniforms. We stood neatly in the back rows, smiling at the camera.

**Except for one person.**

I still remember the photographer telling him to turn around. He complied, slowly twisting his neck, but his body remained completely still, facing away from the lens.

In that exact split second—*click*—the shutter snapped.

The photographer lowered his camera and glanced at the viewfinder. His face instantly drained of color. He dropped the camera, abandoned his tripod, and ran.

He ran because the student who turned his head... **had no face.**

His name was **Lu Zhe**.

My memory of him is blurry now. I just recall him sitting in the back corner of the classroom—quiet, gloomy, and rarely speaking. Whether sad or happy, he always seemed to wear the same boring face.

At first, we thought he was just trying to act cool or be edgy. That was until my desk mate whispered something to me: she had seen Lu Zhe "smile."

It wasn't a normal smile. It was a contortion.

She told me that she and her best friend had found a dying kitten by the roadside. Its limbs were broken, it was covered in blood, and one eye had popped out of its socket. It had clearly been brutally tortured.

While they were crying over the poor creature, they looked up and saw Lu Zhe standing not far away. He was holding a roll of bandages, staring motionless at the cat.

His whole body was trembling. His brows were furrowed tight, but the corners of his mouth were slowly... stretching. That smile didn't curve upwards; it pulled downwards, **like a gash being torn open by force.**

"I’ll never forget that look," she said. "It was unnatural. It was scarier than the cat."

From then on, we all started to distance ourselves from him.

People called him "**The Cat Torturer**" behind his back. Some of the rowdier boys, under the guise of "punishing evil," would corner him, beat him, throw stones at him, and try to force him to cry.

But Lu Zhe didn't cry. With blood trickling from his mouth and eyes red, he would just make a low, chuckling sound, the corners of his lips curling up...

In the second year of middle school, Lu Zhe’s behavior became even more bizarre. He started mimicking the girls in class by wearing makeup.

He would use bright red lipstick to draw a wide arc across his cheeks, like a clown, smiling at us. Sometimes, he would use his index fingers to hook the corners of his mouth and pull them upward, exposing his yellowed teeth.

Later, he stopped using makeup and started wearing masks.

They were crude, creepy things, obviously handmade from papier-mâché. The surfaces were painted with thick, heavy oil paints in garish, piercing colors that always seemed to have a greasy, wet sheen.

I remember one mask vividly: an old face with deep, intersecting wrinkles. An eyeball was pasted crookedly on the rim of the socket, the mouth was split open to reveal broken teeth, and dark red paint had congealed around the lips like dried blood.

Another was a weeping girl. Dark circles under the eyes, silver-gray tear tracks dragging down to the chin, a red nose, and slightly parted lips, as if frozen in a scream.

The most terrifying one was the "**Face of Rage**." It was entirely crimson. The eyebrows were inverted, the eyes wide with almost no whites showing, and the mouth was a gaping, bottomless black hole filled with rows of jagged teeth.

He changed these masks frequently during class—sometimes two or three times in a single period. Every time he peeled one off, there was a skin-crawling *rripp* sound, as if the adhesive was being stripped right off his actual skin.

Eventually, even the bullies were too scared to go near him. Everyone just called him a "freak."

The teachers were helpless. They moved him to the furthest corner of the room where no one else sat.

His parents were migrant workers who were gone all year round. The teachers couldn't reach them by phone. They simply sent a fixed amount of money every month for rent and living expenses, like cold stones thrown into a deep well.

We all understood that even the teachers had given up. As long as he didn't physically hurt anyone, they turned a blind eye.

Sometimes, if he scared a student to tears, the teacher would just send him home. He would silently pack his bag and leave alone, that grotesque mask still on his face.

Although Lu Zhe’s behavior was repulsive, over time, we just got used to it. He ceased to be part of the collective; he became a "transparent person."

I thought life would just fade into the ordinary like that.

Until graduation day, when the thing we feared most finally happened.

---

At the graduation ceremony, the whole class smiled and struck a pose. Only Lu Zhe had his back turned. It wasn’t until the photographer yelled at him to turn around that he twisted his neck.

But the instant he turned, the photographer’s face went pale. He dropped his camera and ran for his life.

That moment became our one and only graduation photo.

In the picture, sitting atop Lu Zhe’s neck is a **pitch-black void**. Or, to be more accurate, a black hood or mask. It had no features, no slits for eyes or nose—just a hollow shell capable of swallowing a person whole, clinging tightly to his face.

His stunt didn't just scare off the photographer; it terrified the principal, too.

Our homeroom teacher, perhaps having tolerated him for too long, finally snapped. He screamed at Lu Zhe, calling him a freak, saying he was "born but not raised"—vicious, hateful words.

But Lu Zhe just stood there, saying nothing, silently enduring it all.

No one knew what expression lay beneath that black abyss. Maybe he was scowling. Maybe he was wearing another mask, or that clown makeup with his signature ripping "smile."

All I remember is that after the photo, we drifted apart in groups to eat or take pictures around campus. No one noticed where Lu Zhe went.

Until that afternoon. As soon as I got home, my phone buzzed.

A notification popped up in the class group chat, tagging **@everyone**. The chat exploded.

There had been a fire in a rental apartment downtown.

It was Lu Zhe’s room.

The place was charred black. Inside, they found burnt skin tissue. Forensics confirmed it belonged to Lu Zhe.

The police reviewed nearby CCTV footage and analyzed DNA. Finding no signs of intruders, they concluded that Lu Zhe had set the room on fire himself—suicide.

The newspapers reported it that way, too.

But those of us questioned by the police knew a detail they never released to the public:

Apart from the skin tissue, **the police never found Lu Zhe’s bones.**

It made no sense. It was as if his body had simply evaporated along with the flames.

---

Years have passed. I buried that graduation album at the bottom of a chest, thinking the memory would gather dust and fade.

But a recent string of bizarre events has forced me to summon the courage to open it again.

Three strange kidnapping cases have occurred in the city in quick succession.

Popular magician **Dong Pengpeng**, rising starlet **Wang Yixin**, and famous stage actor **Qi Xiaochuan**. All three vanished, making headlines.

The police sought me out not just because I am their talent agent, but for another reason: We were all middle school classmates.

According to the investigation, they all lost contact after returning to their respective homes. The only clue lies in the surveillance footage near their apartments.

In the footage, the same figure appears. It was night, and the video is blurry, so the police can’t identify him yet.

But I have an indescribable feeling... I’ve seen that silhouette before. It’s a familiarity that chills me to the bone.

Years ago, someone else disappeared completely in the exact same way.

**Lu Zhe.**

The outside world says he died by self-immolation, but I know better. That wasn't death; it was like total evaporation.

The police know it, too. A body with no bones. Only carbonized skin remaining. It was as if his entire physical form had been swallowed by the flames, boiling away until not even his soul was left.

The scenario feels like something out of that classic horror movie, *IT*. The monster disguised as a clown returns to the town every few decades, feeding on fear, abducting children, and devouring them one by one.

Maybe that kind of monster really exists... Maybe back then, Lu Zhe didn't burn to death. Maybe "It" took him.

And now, it seems the monster has returned.

I took a deep breath, my fingers trembling slightly as I lifted the cover of that graduation album which had slept in darkness for years.

I looked at the photo. There were forty students.

Thirty-nine of them had their backs to the camera.

There was only one exception—

Second row, first on the left. **Lu Zhe.**

But this time, he had taken off the mask.

Underneath, there was no skin. Just a raw, bloody mass of exposed red meat.

He was looking right at me. He was smiling. The smile was stiff, mechanical, the corners of his mouth slowly splitting wider, and wider...

---

Dong Pengpeng, Wang Yixin, and Qi Xiaochuan have been missing for over 72 hours.

I sat in the police station and told Officer Wu everything. Of course, I left out the part about the supernatural changing photo. That would just sound insane.

Instead, I offered a different possibility.

"Is it possible... that Lu Zhe didn't actually die back then?"

Officer Wu raised an eyebrow slightly. "You mean he set himself on fire but survived?"

"Yes." I nodded. "The fire destroyed his skin, but it didn't take his life. Maybe he used the chaos to escape and disappear completely."

Officer Wu clearly didn't buy it. He explained that the skin tissue found at the scene was carbonized beyond recognition. Medically speaking, no one survives burns of that magnitude.

"I know," I said. "The odds are microscopic. But... it’s not impossible. The police report stated that only skin tissue was found. No bones."

I paused for a beat, then added, "What if he faked his death? What if he cut that skin off himself? Maybe he planned the whole thing, creating a scene of self-immolation just so he could vanish."

Officer Wu looked at me, his gaze deepening. "Why would he do that?"

"Dong Pengpeng was the ringleader of the group that bullied Lu Zhe back in school. Qi Xiaochuan... while not his friend, he once extended a helping hand during a bullying incident. As for Wang Yixin..." I hesitated. "She once told me that Lu Zhe confessed his love to her back in school... but she rejected him."

Officer Wu looked up, studying me thoughtfully. "So, you think Lu Zhe is coming specifically for them?"

I nodded. "Lu Zhe was isolated throughout school. To him, these three people were unique. Whether it was hate, gratitude, or love—they are the ones he cannot forget."

To be honest, I didn't tell Officer Wu the whole truth. My theory about Lu Zhe "cutting off his own face to fake his death" wasn't entirely based on logical deduction.

It stemmed from a dream.

*In the dream, Lu Zhe is flaying the skin from his face, inch by inch. Then, he takes that bloody, mangled flesh and plasters it onto the wall, arranging it into the shape of a "smile."*

*Once the skin is set, he raises his raw, red head and looks at me.*

*"I’m dead," he says. "But I’m still here."*

But two days ago, I saw something. And from that moment on, I stopped believing it was just a dream.

---

One night after working late, I was walking back to my apartment alone.

I saw a figure standing under the streetlight at the intersection ahead. A man, back turned to me, standing perfectly still.

He was wearing a black T-shirt, jeans, and a pair of **red and black Nike sneakers**. At his feet lay a bulging backpack.

His build was far too familiar.

"Qi Xiaochuan?" I blurted out.

He acted as if he didn't hear me, turning into the shadows at the corner and vanishing into the night.

Could it be... Qi Xiaochuan has returned? But I had no proof.

Until the next day.

I was walking home late at night again. I sensed someone trailing me. I whipped my head around!

The person instantly darted away, sprinting into the alley across the street. But I saw her outfit. A red dress. Brown, curly hair.

It was **Wang Yixin**. Absolutely.

"Wang Yixin!" I shouted. "Is that you? Yixin!"

She turned her head and looked at me.

Her face looked incredibly stiff. Her expression sent a jolt through my heart—there was no joy, no plea for help, only a fleeting panic... and an indescribable hesitation.

The next second, she turned and ran!

"Don't run! Yixin!"

I bolted after her, but her speed was far beyond that of a normal girl. In two or three strides, she disappeared into the darkness.

I stopped running, cold sweat sliding down my spine.

Something was wrong. The "Wang Yixin" I just saw was significantly taller than she used to be.

And... **she also seemed to be wearing a pair of red and black Nike sneakers.**

None of this adds up. First I saw Qi Xiaochuan, then Wang Yixin. If they were really saved, why didn't they ask for help? Why avoid me once discovered?

And most importantly... Are they even themselves anymore?

---

Unexpectedly, just two days later, I received a message from Officer Wu—

Qi Xiaochuan, Wang Yixin, and Dong Pengpeng had all returned home.

Although the three of them had "returned safely," their conditions were extremely abnormal.

Officer Wu and I rushed to the hospital to visit Wang Yixin. The doctor whispered to us that they had detected traces of male seminal fluid in her body. We all knew what that meant.

She just curled up in the corner of the hospital bed, trembling uncontrollably. When she looked at us, there was no surprise, no tears. She just stared at us timidly, as if struggling to figure out who we were.

I tried to jog her memory, asking why she ran from me the other night. Her pupils contracted slightly, but it was quickly replaced by a blank stare. It was a genuine blank.

Compared to her, Qi Xiaochuan’s condition was even more chilling.

There was a deep gash on his left cheek, slicing almost all the way through the cheekbone. Since returning home, he had been clutching that graduation album, trying to carve his own face off with a utility knife, muttering over and over:

"This face isn't mine... He wore my face... He wore it..."

Of the three, only **Dong Pengpeng** seemed to be in slightly better shape.

He haltingly recounted the ordeal.

"It was... Lu Zhe," he said. "He kidnapped us."

"He kept beating us. He used a knife... to cut Xiaochuan’s face... He said he was going to peel my face off too..."

"The walls of his house... were covered in faces. All kinds of human faces... I didn't want to die... I had to escape."

When asked how he managed to get away, he said: "I... I'm a magician. I know how to hold my breath and play dead. He thought I was dead and tried to bury me. I seized the moment when he wasn't looking, hit him on the back of the head... and escaped."

In the end, Dong told Officer Wu he could only point out the approximate location of the shack. But he clearly remembered the car used: a grey-blue Honda.

Based on this clue, the police quickly narrowed down the search area to **Baoshan Village**.

After contacting the village head, we learned that a young man lived there who "painted opera masks." He always wore a mask himself and never showed his face.

We were certain this was Lu Zhe.

---

On the night of the operation, the wind was dead quiet.

We followed the police convoy into the remote village. At the entrance, a battered, grey-blue Honda was parked in front of a small shack.

"It's him," Officer Wu whispered.

Dong Pengpeng led us in through the back door. The room was dim, smelling of mold and blood.

There were grotesque photos taped to the walls—all blown-up faces from our graduation picture. Just the faces. No bodies.

In the corner, a figure was sitting on the bed, motionless.

He was wearing a tuxedo that looked strangely familiar. He sat bolt upright, his back to us. Like a puppet that had been waiting there for a long time.

I noticed his feet. He was wearing a pair of **red and black Nike sneakers**.

"Lu Zhe?" Officer Wu barked. "Don't move! Police!"

The person slowly stood up and turned around.

Then, he smiled.

"...Dong Pengpeng?" Officer Wu’s voice suddenly trembled.

The person standing opposite us was **wearing Dong Pengpeng’s face**. But the smile was too perfect. It looked like a fake smile plastered onto the skin.

The next second, the figure screamed and lunged at us with a knife, moving with unnatural speed.

*BANG!*

A shot rang out, hitting him squarely in the chest. He crashed heavily to the floor.

Dong Pengpeng walked forward, trembling. He looked down at that face—so familiar yet so alien. Suddenly, he lunged forward and tore that "skin" off.

"Don't touch him!" someone shouted, but it was too late.

The mask was ripped away.

Underneath, it wasn't Lu Zhe's face. **It wasn't a human face at all.**

It was a pitch-black void. Like a hole of charred, solidified ash after a fire. No eyes, no nose. Just a blurry, hollow shell.

I heard an officer behind me whisper, "That thing isn't fucking human..."

---

After the house was cordoned off, we found a hidden trapdoor leading to a cellar.

Hanging neatly on the walls were dozens of "faces."

Not masks. **Human skin masks.**

Under each one, a name was written in red ink. Their expressions varied wildly: rage, terror, shyness, sorrow...

Officer Wu picked up a yellowed diary from the desk. Relying on the fragments left in the diary, we pieced together Lu Zhe’s motive.

On one page, he wrote:
> *"I have no right to like anyone, because I cannot smile."*

It turned out Lu Zhe was born with a rare neurological disorder: **Möbius syndrome**.

His facial muscles were paralyzed. He could not display emotions normally. This disease meant his smile was contorted. No one believed his sadness.

> *"Human existence is confirmed through expression. A person without expression is like a photo with the name torn off."*
>
> *"If no one can 'see' my pain, does my pain still 'count'?"*

He practiced smiling in the mirror countless times, but failed. He grew to loathe his own face.

> *"That isn't 'me.' It is a broken vessel imprisoning me. This face is a cage. I want to change it."*

He tried painting opera masks to "own" emotions, but on graduation day, his black mask terrified everyone.

> *"In that moment, I understood. I don't belong in that photo. I don't belong in this world."*

He cut off his own face and burned it in a ritual.

> *"This face prevents me from being human. But other people's faces... they are my ticket to 'human society.'"*

His final entry read:

> *"I don't need to paint faces anymore. I want 'their' faces. Identical faces. I will piece together a complete face that belongs to me."*
>
> *"When I wear it, I can be seen. When I wear it, I can be loved."*
>
> *"—I am not a monster. I am a human."*

---

The truth was sobering. Lu Zhe was dead. The "Face-Peeling Monster" was gone.

But something gnawed at me.

First, the victims showed no signs of recovery. Wang Yixin and Qi Xiaochuan remained trembling and emotionally numb.

Second, the diary.

The section regarding **Dong Pengpeng** was preserved in its entirety, written with meticulous detail. But there was not a single word about Wang Yixin or Qi Xiaochuan.

It was as if those two had been completely erased from this "Face-Peeling Game."

I asked to see the archival photos of the masks again.

I swiped through them. Beneath each mask, a name was tagged. The warm face belonged to Qi Xiaochuan. The shy, smiling one was Wang Yixin.

I continued flipping until I reached the twenty-second mask. My finger froze.

This mask had no name under it.

Its expression was incredibly complex: one corner of the mouth was curled up as if mocking, while the other side was tight with suppressed anger. It was a mixed, twisted, "composite emotion."

And it wasn't the only one. I found three masks with this exact expression. Lu Zhe had tried again and again, but was never satisfied.

*Whose face represents this complex mix of emotions?*

Suddenly, a bolt of lightning tore through the night sky, reflecting off my screen.

In that stark illumination, I recognized it.

It was—**Dong Pengpeng.**

It was the exact face he wore when he bullied others in junior high. That specific cocktail of sneering, indifference, superiority, and the thrill of violence.

My scalp tingled with horror.

This was the masterpiece Lu Zhe wanted to create most, but could never quite finish.

He couldn't comprehend the "pleasure of bullying." Because he was never Dong Pengpeng.

So he was jealous. He was obsessed. This face had become the final threshold preventing him from becoming a "complete human."

---

I shared my concerns with the police, and sure enough, it was proven that **Dong Pengpeng was the true mastermind**.

He had worn a mask of Lu Zhe’s face to impersonate him, personally kidnapping Wang Yixin and Qi Xiaochuan. He deliberately exposed his "face" to surveillance cameras to mislead the police.

I had assumed Lu Zhe planned to kidnap all three of them. I was wrong. His plan only ever involved **one** person: Dong Pengpeng.

But Dong Pengpeng turned the tables. Using psychology derived from his magic training, he took control of Lu Zhe.

He used to bully Lu Zhe. Lu Zhe feared him. That oppression became an "emotional handle" for Dong to manipulate.

He convinced Lu Zhe: *"The only way to verify if a mask is perfect is to let someone who knows the subject see it. If they recognize it, then it's a success."*

That explains why I saw "Qi Xiaochuan" and "Wang Yixin" appear on the street corners.

I thought they were the real victims. Now I understand—it was you, Dong Pengpeng. You made Lu Zhe wear their faces and sent him out for an "obedience test."

When he learned Lu Zhe wanted to draw his face, he actually volunteered to model. He physically transformed into his old bullying self, beating and abusing Wang Yixin and Qi Xiaochuan right in front of Lu Zhe, allowing him to copy the expressions live.

That is why there were so many masks of "Dong Pengpeng" on that wall. Every single one was hideous, manic, and oppressive. They were the "evil" left behind as Lu Zhe traced his face.

Dong Pengpeng confessed to his crimes without hesitation. He arrogantly told the police: "I just like bullying him. He doesn't resist, and he has no expression. What a perfect victim."

After his arrest, Dong revealed even more details, asking the police to pass them on to me.

"Actually, I killed those stray cats at school. Then I tricked that idiot Lu Zhe into taking them to the hospital, so everyone thought he did it."

"And that year, after the graduation photo... I slapped that black mask right off his face and whispered in his ear: *'You know, it’s this face that keeps you from being human. You'll be a monster forever. Unless... you destroy it!'*"

"I realized he was just as stupid as before. So I slowly took control of him, using him to do things I’ve always wanted to do but couldn't."

"Like—carving up Qi Xiaochuan’s face, and defiling Wang Yixin’s body..."

---

One day, many years later, I couldn't help but open that graduation album again.

That group photo, which I had been too terrified to look at for so long.

The photo was yellowed, the corners slightly curled.

The teachers and administrators sat in the front row. Behind them stood forty students in blue and white uniforms.

Forty.

They were all smiling.

Including the student who was first on the left in the second row.

**Lu Zhe.**

He was facing the camera, revealing a clean, pure smile.

As if he had finally learned how to smile.

And as if he was saying to me—

*"Thank you for seeing me."*
