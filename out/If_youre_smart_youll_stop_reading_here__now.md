We've all shared a singular experience on our beloved r/nosleep :

You find a new story. It captivates, *thrills* you, even. At the end, a link is found - generally disguised within something to the effect of *next*, or *PART II*.

A little rush as you realize the story's not over, at least not for you. You click or tap.

Whether the conclusion of the story terrorizes, warms the heart, or something in between, at the end of a series you always, ALWAYS find that link to the author's user page, collected works, or some external site. Writers have to get paid or recognized somehow, after all. And that's that. On to the next one or off for the night.

Today I found a series that was a little different.

It was a beautiful Friday afternoon, and I settled into my favorite spot in my lonely little apartment: my computer chair. Sunlight danced on the keyboard as I sat down to (ideally) scare the shit out of myself before it got really dark out. I posted up with some decaf and nicotine and started to scroll.

The first post had a few hundred upvotes when I found it, and I must say that the writing was, or perhaps is (I can't access it now), exceptionally brilliant. I'd never seen anything quite like it: my jaded imagination was swept away into a world that contained a compelling protagonist, magical elements, a deep backstory, and, classically, an impending sense that something was very, very *wrong*.

You'll have to excuse me for steering clear of any real identifying characteristics.

I remember struggling to figure out what exactly tripped my spidey-sense for the *impending wrongness* of the passage. I scrolled back up. Reread everything that was on the page, and still couldn't make sense of it. Which was even more exciting, somehow. It's been a while - maybe forever - since an author managed to tickle that sense without outright setting me off with some piece of obvious foreshadowing, or in other cases a setting that could really only end poorly for the subjects the story concerns. It was like a trick of the light in literary form, or a shadowy figure over your shoulder, one who disappears the instant you turn around and are once again grounded in reality.

I took a puff off my vape and breathlessly clicked *next*.

The writing was still excellent, and I sped through the second passage, totally enamored with the story. The sunlight had just started to fade, but I'm a pretty fast reader. Figured I could get through a few more before I inevitably ended up shivering, terrified, and alone in my admittedly somewhat creepy living space. I shot a dirty look at the pantry door that had creaked open at a rather inopportune moment during my reading binge last week.

The follow-ups all had a similar number of upvotes, but the comment sections started to devolve a bit as the series went on. The first post had the typical "*loved this*" and "*be careful around (x character), OP!*" type stuff. The second post had a good measure of the same, but I found one near the bottom that just said "*What's go*", which didn't make a whole lot of sense.

The third post had a few comments like this one sprinkled in. One user just typed "*STO*". Get it? They couldn't finish typing out "STOP" or "STOP NOW" because something "got" them. That other one must have been something to the effect of "What's going on?" abbreviated for a similar dramatic purpose. Real creative people I was dealing with here. I sighed, and having finished the third passage, scrolled back up and clicked *next* again.

I didn't pay as much attention to the comments as I read the subsequent posts.

*Next, next, next*.

What drew my attention back to the real world was the light outdoors - it had almost completely faded just as I finished the fifth installment in the series. *Huh*. I could have sworn sunset was supposed to be at #### or something today. *6:20 and it's nearly pitch dark? Must be a hell of a storm rolling in*. I live in ####, so weather blotting out the sun isn't too unusual, and this close to sunset there's a whole lot less light to blot out.

*Next*.

The writing was as beautiful as ever, but here I decided to check the comments again, just to see if there was anything insightful posted about the story. There was a (much) bigger smattering of the "something got me in the middle of typing" comments (*sigh*), and one that sort of stuck out near the top of the most popular ones, upvoted by nearly everyone who'd upvoted the story. It just said "*BIG*". "BIG" didn't have anything to do with the story, and I couldn't really fathom a line that would fit the comment archetype that these sections had devolved into.

*Next.*

My stomach dropped as I was in the middle of the passage. My computer monitor appeared to have swollen to nearly twice its original size. I don't know how I didn't notice it before. This was certainly "BIG", but my rational side soon got the best of the panic that set in. *Guess that therapy wasn't for nothing*. I forgot to take my meds last night. It was dark out, and I have documented issues with minor hallucinations, *especially* when it's dark out. I must be an idiot for frequenting creepy story subs, but "*the heart wants what the heart wants"*, I guess. I slammed couple of pills along with the rest of my coffee and finished reading the page.

*Next*.

While reading the following passage, I noticed a small computer hardware malfunction. My mouse cursor started drifting across the screen. This isn't real uncommon. I've had it happen before. Last time it was a driver issue. The weird thing about it was that it kept landing on the post's upvote button. I've never seen it home in on a particular location before - generally cursor drift just trends in one direction until it hits the edge of the screen or whatever. For whatever reason, this set me on edge. I checked the number of upvotes on this one. ###.

*Next.*

I scrolled straight down to the bottom of the subsequent post. It had the exact same number of upvotes. I realize this isn't outside the realm of possibility, but those of you who frequent this sub and have read more than one series know that upvotes typically dwindle a bit as a series drags on. Especially when installments are posted multiple months apart, as was the case here. 

The mouse started giving me further issues. Now my cursor was drifting AND the mouse started scrolling on its own. Like I said before, I'm no stranger to hardware issues or I might have taken this more seriously right off the bat. What really rankled me was that after it scrolled back to the top of the page, it started scrolling down *at roughly the same speed as my eyes*. I stopped reading, the mouse stopped scrolling.

*God, I need to take a break*. This was just a little too much, and I was clearly imagining things.

Noting that the monitor didn't seem to have decreased in size since having taken my pills, I instinctively reached out to brush a fly off the screen before getting up, and *my hand stuck to the screen.* I tried to jerk my arm away, but a pitch dark, gelatinous, and only slightly stretchy substance snapped my hand back into position. My gigantic monitor didn't budge. I screamed. 

And *SCREAMED*. 

Only after screaming my lungs out for nearly a full five minutes did I realize how muted the sound was. And how oppressive the darkness. I could almost *taste* it. My neighbors should've heard me, and I should have been able to see something, ANYTHING illuminated by my monitor. But the only thing accessible to my vision was my monitor, shining brightly away. Ready to accommodate reading *just one more* installment in this godforsaken series.

Sobbing, I thought I understood what was happening for an instant. I finished the page. I didn't even need to click *next*, my mouse seemed to have a mind of its own now.

The pitch black substance has seeped across my arm, chest, neck, stomach, and it's nearly enveloped my other arm at this point. I envision my other arm just snapping to the other side of the screen once it's been completely swallowed. Not anywhere near the text in the middle of the screen, of course. I finished the most recent installment a while ago, and have been typing, one-handed and furiously, into a chat that miraculously opened on the bottom right side of the screen ever since. I knew you fellow horror fiends wouldn't listen if I couldn't capture your attention somehow, so hop
