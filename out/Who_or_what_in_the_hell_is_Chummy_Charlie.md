When I was high the other night I had a really weird experience. I feel silly about it but also still kinda freaked out. 


Quick background info: I'm a middle-aged white guy, which means I have a podcast. I record remotely with two other dudes every couple of weeks. It's a horror movie review podcast and we've been doing it for nearly 15 years. We record from 10pm to midnight most times, sometimes later.


I also gave up drinking for weed - no hangover, no puking, nice vibes (usually). Most nights I'll have a couple hits from a vape or a 10mg THC drink. 


So a couple nights ago I was sipping a new brand of THC drink. I've had a couple different ones before. Usually they give me a nice mellow high, enough to laugh, relax, watch something stupid, you know. Stoner stuff. I was feeling pretty chill when we quit recording at midnight.


So I stumble out of my home office and the whole house is dark and quiet. Again, nothing unusual there. I decide to chill in the living room and watch the latest Masked Singer (don't judge. Stoner stuff).


I look into the living room, and I think "It's too dark. I can't go in there. Chummy Charlie will get me." 


I have never heard the name Chummy Charlie before. The thought pops into my head like I'm remembering something, not inventing it.


I don't have any sense of who or what he/it might be. But I get chills up and down my spine.


So I dash into the room and turn on the lamp next to my recliner. I think, "That's better. Chummy Charlie can't come into the light." And it just feels true.


And at the same time, I think "Chummy Charlie is a super dumb name for a boogeyman. You're just high. This is dumb." 


But I still have that prickly feeling that someone's watching me. And my lamp is a tiny little island of light, and Chummy Charlie could be anywhere in the dark.


After a couple of c-list celebrities sing their songs in giant mascot outfits, I have to pee. Thankfully the bathroom light is already on.


As I go in the bathroom, I think "Don't look yourself in the eyes in the mirror or Chummy Charlie will get you." So Chummy Charlie's mythos is expanding. Again, never thought of it before. Again, feels TRUE.


And immediately the other half of my brain goes, "That's the dumbest thing ever. You're high. One of the guys you just talked to for two hours is NAMED CHARLIE. Stop it."


So I try to calm down and I pee. But when I go to wash my hands, I do NOT look myself in the eye.


I am a 47-year-old man freaked out by a monster I appear to be creating in real time.


Finally Masked Singer ends (It was Candace Cameron from Full House in the Cherry Blossom suit). Now I have to figure how to get to bed. The hallway and the bedroom are dark.


It's damn hard to walk down the hallway. I can feel Chummy Charlie lurking in the dark. Even as I have no idea what he looks like, or even what being 'got' by him would mean.


I just know he can get me in the dark and if I look myself in the eyes in the mirror.


I have to walk past a big patio door to get to bed. I don't know if meeting my eyes in that reflection will trigger Chummy Charlie. But I'm not taking chances.


So I get to the doorway to my dark bedroom. I can feel the tension across my shoulders, up and down my spine, in my butthole.


How do I get to bed? It's too dark. If I turn on the light I'll wake up my wife.


Obviously, says half my brain, this is all stupid and I should go to bed and laugh about it in the morning.


The other rest of my body physically will not let me walk into that room.


Finally I think, "Chummy Charlie is made from darkness and loneliness. He can't get you if you're with someone you love, or if you're with dogs. Because you can't be lonely if you have a dog."


This gets me moving because, like the mirror thing, it feels true. Like remembering, not making something up.


My wife is curled up in the bed already, and there are two dogs snuggled on the dog bed. So I dash over to the bed and get under the covers. I haven't felt this freaked out about the dark since I was 12.


I curl up and feel safe...ish. I still feel the tension in my back and neck, and I swear I can sense Chummy Charlie moving around in the dark. He can't get me and he's pissed about it. 


I just keep repeating in my head that Chummy Charlie can't come near dogs, and he can't get you if you're with someone you love. Finally I fall asleep.


It's been two days. I'm a rational guy and objectively--yeah, stoner brain created something freaky instead of something fun. I've watched over 1,000 horror movies in the past decade. Of course some of that's going to stick.


But I'm still having trouble meeting my eyes in the mirror, even in broad daylight. Even though Chummy Charlie can't come into the light, y'know?


So I've still got three more of these drinks in the fridge. I'm going to try again tonight and see what happens. Either I chill and watch dumb Sci-fi and have a great night... or I learn more about Chummy Charlie.
