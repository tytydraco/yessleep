When I was little, I thought every family was like mine. I thought it was normal to live in a house so far off the beaten path that no one ever visited. I thought it was normal that we never had visitors. And I thought it was normal that my “parents” rarely let me go anywhere, outside of our little, isolated life.

It wasn’t a bad childhood, not really. I had food, shelter, toys. There were no beatings or harsh words. My "mom" cooked me dinner every night, and my "dad" would read me stories before bed. We had movie nights, and they always hugged me goodnight. It was loving—just...strange. But I was a kid. I didn’t know any better. 

I never had any baby pictures around the house, but when I asked, they’d laugh and tell me I was camera shy. They always had answers for things like that. And I always believed them.

I don’t think anyone really *wants* to believe their whole life is a lie. 

It wasn’t until I was in my late teens that things started to unravel. We were watching TV. A rerun of some crime show. I wasn’t paying much attention until I heard it—“Missing for over 15 years, this is what the child might look like today.”

I didn’t think anything of it at first. Who really looks at those age-progressed images and expects to see someone they know? But then I caught a glimpse. A boy—no, me—staring back from the screen. My stomach twisted as I stared at the face. The shape of the nose, the eyes, even the hair color—it all felt too close. My “mom” quickly changed the channel, and her face was pale. “Just some sensationalist nonsense,” she said. “You can never trust those shows.”

But I knew. I knew 

It took me days to work up the nerve to ask again. I sat at the dinner table, twirling my fork in my spaghetti, my appetite gone. “Was I adopted?”

They both went quiet. My dad set down his fork, and my mom's face tightened into a thin, trembling line. The silence stretched, suffocating the room. Finally, my dad sighed. “We raised you,” he said. “Doesn’t that make us your real parents?”

That’s not an answer, I thought. But I didn’t push it. 

The weeks passed, and the image on the TV haunted me. I started having nightmares—dreams of being taken away, of waking up in a different house, screaming for someone I didn’t recognize. I started finding little things that didn’t add up—documents that seemed forged, old letters in a handwriting I didn’t recognize. 

Then, the whispering began.

I don’t mean literal whispering. It was the kind that lives inside your mind—the constant, nagging feeling that something’s wrong. That the life you’ve been living isn’t yours.

I tried to run once. I don’t even know what I was thinking, packing a bag and sneaking out in the middle of the night. But I didn’t get far. Not because they stopped me, but because I stopped myself. Where would I go? The whole world outside was terrifying. I had no friends, no family outside of them. I’d never even been to a city before, had no one to contact. The very idea of leaving was enough to paralyze me with fear. 

So I went back. I told myself it was easier this way, safer.

Years passed, and my “parents” grew old. My dad went first. He passed away quietly in his sleep, no warning, no chance to say goodbye. It felt like the house itself grieved—this heavy, oppressive silence settling over everything. I didn’t know what to do. How do you mourn someone who may have stolen you from another life?

I tried not to think about it.

Mom followed not long after. I think the loneliness killed her as much as old age. By the end, she wasn’t even herself anymore—just a fragile, whispering ghost of the woman who raised me. One night, I found her staring at an old photo, one I hadn’t seen before. She was younger in it, holding a baby. But it wasn’t me. 

I asked her who it was, and she didn’t answer. She just cried.

When she died, I was alone for the first time in my life. Alone in a house that felt more like a prison than ever. There was no one to tell me what to do, no one to talk to. No neighbors, no family, just the quiet.

I should’ve left. I should’ve taken the opportunity to run and never look back. But I couldn’t. Even though my mind screamed at me to go, my body wouldn’t move. I was bound to this place. This was my life, even if it wasn’t the one I was supposed to have.

The whispers came back then, louder than ever. Sometimes I think it’s the house itself talking to me, reminding me of what I lost. Sometimes I hear them at night, murmuring just outside my door, saying things I don’t want to understand. Things like “You were never theirs.”

I want to believe I’m crazy, that none of this is real. But then I find the documents. More papers, more evidence. My real name, my real birthday—things I should’ve known but didn’t. The more I look, the more I realize that the life I’ve lived is nothing but a carefully constructed lie. A lie built to keep me here. 

But I don’t leave. I can’t. Every time I pack a bag, every time I take a step towards the door, something stops me. My feet won’t move. My hands shake. It’s like I’m frozen in place, trapped by the weight of the truth.

Some days, I sit and stare at the TV, waiting for my face to flash across the screen again. I wait for someone to knock on the door, to tell me who I really am. To take me away from here.

But no one comes.

I don’t know how to explain it. Maybe it’s guilt, maybe it’s fear, but I can’t leave. I can’t face the reality of what I am. I *don’t want to know*. Because if I admit the truth, if I say it out loud, then everything changes. 

I keep telling myself they loved me, even if they weren’t really my parents. I keep telling myself that this house is home, that I belong here. But late at night, when I’m alone in the dark, I hear the whispers. And I know they’re right.

I was stolen. And now, I’m lost.

I think I always will be.
