I’d like to say we probably started out as most high school sweethearts do, pretty popular and practically known for just being in love with each other. We were voted most likely to get married after high school and well, you guessed it, we got married after high school. I mean we were 19, we had great parents, and each had a great job opportunity on hold for us and everything went swell. I’d say we were on the lucky side of things, but our flame not so much. After our first daughter things started to get a little on edge between me and my husband.

To catch you up to speed, my husband is generally a very enthusiastic man we’ve been together all through out high school and married for about another 5 years, so don’t think we didn’t have our fun when we had the chance, of course we did. We didn’t want children until our mid 20’s, and really everything has been fine. Recently though my husband has been acting strangely towards our daughter Viridian, I would often catch him avoiding all contact with her and when she would crawl towards him he would flinch and hurriedly scamper the complete opposite direction from her. He would cringe every time he saw me pick her up, or kiss her face or even just be around her and play with her. This was odd and it hurt quite a lot since, he was the father.

This man was my first everything and we even have our first child together that he can’t simply bear the thought of giving her a slight bit of affection. He made it seem like she was sick with some kind of disease and continued to avoid her like the plague. One night, I did the usual of putting our daughter to sleep and noticed my husband peeping around the corner of the door. I walked out of our daughters room but he had disappeared and I noticed that our bedroom door was slowly being shut. I rolled my eyes and walk in our room and noticed he was in bed facing away from me.

“Honey,”  I spoke calmly to him, “you’ve been acting strange towards Viridian recently, what’s going on?” He shrugged but didn’t say anything, “You need to talk to me.” He sighed and finally turned but instead this time, he was facing the ceiling, almost in a day dreamy kind of way.

“I don’t think she’s ours.” He said, a heavy silence followed, and I took notice as to how he said ours instead of his.

“I’m not sure what you mean honey.”

“I mean, she’s not ours, don’t you find her kind of… strange?” I was almost offended, was this just not what he wanted? Is he trying to tell me he thinks our child is somehow defective?

“Wow. Okay, Good night, I’m not having this conversation about our daughter.” I snuggled under the sheets, turning away from him and decided not to talk to him or influence an argument for the remainder of the night. He sighed.

“There’s something wrong with her, something I just can’t explain.” I almost started to consider what he was trying to say, but refused to believe it regardless of how convincing he was, “I don’t think she’s human.” This took me by surprise, how was our daughter not human? I gave birth to her in front of doctors, nurses and even my own husband, was that so unnatural to him? I shrug off what he said, I knew he wasn’t trying to be offensive and that this was something that had clearly been on his mind.

I woke up again at around 4 in the morning from the sound of our daughter crying. I get up and mumble that I would check on her, when I got up to walk across the hall, I noticed her light was on. I find this odd and proceed with caution, my heart was pounding, who turned the light on? I opened the door quietly and found my husband standing over the cradle and staring at her. He was gripping the gate really hard and just staring, who knows what was going on in that mind of his. I walked towards him slowly and called his name softly but he didn’t listen to me.

“Look at her.” He spoke in a hushed tone, “Don’t you see it in her eyes?” I crept next to him and gently put my hand on his and looked at our crying daughter, “They’re not normal.” I did look at her eyes, lifting her up in arms, rocking her and hushing her and humming, and her eyes were beautiful, big and brown like mine.

“She has my eyes,” I said in a dreamy tone as she finally started to settle down, “They’re beautiful.”

“Her eyes are missing, Elizabeth.” I quickly looked up at my husband to find that he was towering over me, staring at Viridian like she was his next meal. I took a good look at him, his sclera’s were red and his eyes looked so strained, he had gotten a bit pale like as if he were sick and he was sweating like a maniac. I took a step back but his eyes were trained on our daughter. “Look.” I look down but her eyes were there, her big beautiful brown eyes, nothing missing. I look back at my husband who was still standing and staring at her.

“You need to get some sleep, go.” He didn’t move, “I said go, get out of her room, we’ll talk about this in the morning.” He slowly looked at me and finally walked past us and into our room. I sigh in relief, my heart pounded in my chest, I felt like we were in danger. I can’t leave her alone like that again, I don’t trust my husband enough not to do anything. Quickly, I shut the door and lock it, and sit in rocking chair, falling asleep with our daughter in my arms.

There's more to this story, I'll have to update you guys in a little, But you'll have to give me some time.
