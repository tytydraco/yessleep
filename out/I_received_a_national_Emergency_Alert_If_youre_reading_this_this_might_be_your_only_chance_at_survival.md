I sat on the edge of the bed, my hands shaking as I stared at the emergency alert on my phone.

"ALERT, ALERT, ALERT. THIS IS NOT A DRILL. Unknown entities have entered United States soil and may pose an unknown threat. All citizens must stay indoors, cover windows, lock doors, and do not look outside. Stand by for further information," it read. "National lockdown in effect."

Wendy sat beside me, her face pale and her eyes wide. "What does this mean?" she asked.

"It means we're in some fucking trouble," I said, trying to keep my voice steady.

As the alert blared loudly through our phones, we knew that it was not something to take lightly. The thought of 'unknown entities', my mind went wild as the thought of eldritch gods invading our planet was something that I had only ever read about in science fiction novels. The hairs on my arms stood up as a sudden chill ran through my spine, Wendy and I looked at each other with the same question on our minds:

What do we do now?

Our home suddenly felt like the only refuge in this world. We had to defend it at all costs. We rushed around, collecting food and water, and then quickly locked all the doors and windows. It was a time of waiting, a time of uncertainty. Weeks passed, and the world outside became a desolate wasteland. We never took a look outside, covering the windows with papers in fear of what would happen if we disobeyed the emergency alert's warning.

Every night, we could hear the things, the entities howling and screeching, their unearthly voices echoing through the empty streets. It was like nothing I had ever heard before. Their calls seemed to grow louder and more frequent as the weeks went on. Wendy and I soon realized that these were not just sounds, but warnings. The eldritch gods were getting closer, and they were getting more agitated the more they passed through my city. We had to barricade ourselves in our home, fortifying every possible entrance.

Over the next few days, we received a few more emergency alerts on my phone, when my wi-fi held up throughout the incident. A few notable rules they had were these.

&#x200B;

1. DO NOT look outside, under any circumstances.
2. Be wary of survivors. They may be changed.
3. Do not regard human screams, no matter how real they sounds.
4. Bullets work, but do not deal significant damage. Fire is better.
5. Stand by for more updates. The United States is currently investigating the [invaders.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SeasideUniverse/comments/xyitrx/the_ninth_circle_preview_while_working_on_several/)

With each passing day, the tension between Wendy and I grew thicker. We were both exhausted and frightened, and we didn't know how much longer we could hold on, the constant fear and uncertainty were taking a toll on our minds and our relationship. But we had to keep fighting, keep surviving, there was no other option. One night, as we were huddled together in our bedroom, we heard a loud crash at the barricaded front door, then a thud from the living room.

We both froze, knowing that this was it… they had finally breached our home. Wendy clutched onto my arm, her nails digging into my skin as we both held our breath, waiting for the worst. Outside, we heard dozens of gunshots, and sounds of explosions and fires breaking out, human screams, until it all went silent.

But then, we heard another sound. They were voices… human voices. After a few hours, we cautiously made our way to the living room, my pistol at the ready. And there, standing in front of us, was a group of survivors, all of them wearing sunglasses.

They had been traveling together, trying to find other survivors. And they had stumbled upon our house, initially to loot it until they realized it was occupied.

Why were we one of the only survivors?
