When my wife Sarah and I bought the house, it felt like a dream come true. Quiet neighborhood, plenty of trees, and a big backyard with a rusted, overgrown fence running along the far edge. The realtor said the forest behind it was "undeveloped county land.” No trails, no utilities, no trespassing. She mentioned the fence was probably an old property divider.

But it wasn’t just a fence. It was nearly eight feet tall, made of rusted iron, with twisted, sharp points along the top, like it was built to keep something in, not out. Right in the center, hidden behind vines and moss, was a gate, welded shut with thick seams of metal and rust. On the inside of that gate (our side) someone had carved a single word into the metal.

"STAY."

At first, we thought it was some strange leftover from the previous owners. Maybe they were paranoid. Maybe they had kids and wanted to scare them from wandering into the woods.

Now I think they were trying to warn us.

The dog noticed it first. Bear is usually friendly, dumb as a rock but loyal. After we moved in, he refused to go near the fence. Wouldn’t even step into the backyard. He’d stand at the sliding door, growling softly, tail low, ears pinned.

Then the dreams started.

Sarah said she kept dreaming about the woods, dense, black trees packed tighter than they should be. She said she heard things walking just out of sight, shapes moving between the trunks. I shrugged it off, told her it was stress. New house, new environment. Normal adjustment stuff.

Then I started having the same dreams.

And then it got worse.

One night last week, I woke up at exactly 3:17 a.m. Not from a noise. Not from a nightmare. I just… knew I had to wake up. The house was silent. Even Bear wasn’t snoring. I got up and looked out the back window.

There, standing inside the fence.

On the other side of the welded gate.

I couldn’t see much, just a tall silhouette. Pale, almost white. Barely human-shaped. It didn’t move. Didn’t run when I turned on the porch light.

It just raised a long, thin arm and pointed at me.

I blinked. It was gone.

The next morning, I found bare footprints in the dew. Human-looking, but wrong. Toes too long. Arches too low. They led from the gate, across the backyard, and stopped right beneath our bedroom window.

That night, Sarah said I was talking in my sleep. Not mumbling, whispering.

She said I kept repeating the same phrase over and over:

“Let me back in. I remember now. Let me back in.”

I don’t remember any of it.

But she swears she saw me get up around 2 a.m., unlock the back door, and stand by the fence. Just staring.

She said I whispered something to the gate. And something whispered back.

Last night was the worst. I woke to Sarah shaking me, tears in her eyes.

“The gate,” she said. “Listen.”

I held my breath. In the silence, I heard it:

Metal groaning.

A slow, dragging, shrieking noise, rusted hinges straining.

We ran to the window. The gate was open. Bent inward, like something had forced its way through the welds.

I grabbed a flashlight and went out barefoot, heart pounding. The air near the gate was colder. Still. Like the woods themselves were watching.

And that’s when I saw it.

The word on the gate “STAY” was gone.

Scratched over with deep, jagged gouges.

Now it said

“WELCOME HOME."

I don’t know what I did. I don’t know what’s calling to me from those woods.

But something is.

Something that remembers me.

And I think… I’m starting to remember it too.


Update: 

I went into the woods.

Not far, just a few steps beyond the gate. Sarah told me not to. She pleaded, actually. Begged me to leave it alone. But I couldn’t help it.

There was a trail. Narrow, half-hidden, curling through the trees like it had always been there, waiting. I don’t remember ever seeing it before. The forest beyond the gate was supposed to be unbroken, wild and untouched. That’s what the realtor said. That’s what the survey maps showed.

But this path felt old. Pressed into the earth by countless footsteps. Too precise to be natural, too worn to be new.

And yet, somehow, it felt familiar.

The air changed the moment I crossed the threshold. Heavier. Wet with sap and the faint sweetness of something else, lilac maybe, or the early bloom of rot. Not unpleasant. Just strange. Like the woods were breathing.

I followed the path for only a minute or two, not far at all. But something made me stop.

A tree. Tall, dark, and split near the base. And carved into the bark nearly hidden beneath a sheet of lichen were my initials.

R.J.

Not just the letters, but the exact way I used to write them. Sharp slant on the “R,” awkward looping on the “J.” The way I’d scrawl them on the back of my notebooks in high school. I reached out and touched it. The carving was old, softened by time and weather.

But it was mine.

Only I’ve never been here before.

When I got back to the house, Sarah was pacing. She looked at me like she didn’t recognize me. Said I’d been gone almost an hour. I told her it was five minutes at most. But she just shook her head.

She told me I’ve been different since the night the gate opened. Said I drift off in the middle of conversations now, like I’m listening to something only I can hear. Said I’ve been speaking in my sleep in a language she doesn’t understand.

I don’t remember any of that.

But I do remember flashes of the woods. Not from today. From somewhere else. A cold stream choked with red leaves. A black stone that felt warm in my hand. And a figure standing at the edge of the trees.

Pale. Tall. Wrapped in shadows.

Not threatening.

Just watching.

And somehow, I felt safe.

This afternoon, I went through the old house records. Buried beneath years of bills and permits, I found a property inspection report from the late 80s. Mostly standard boilerplate. Foundation condition, wiring updates, that kind of thing.

But in the corner of the property line sketch, someone had scribbled a note in faded blue ink.

“Warden R.J. — caretaker of the line.”

No surname. No explanation. Just that.

I showed Sarah. She didn’t say anything for a long time. Then she looked at me and asked, very quietly, “Have you lived here before?”

I started to laugh.

But something inside me froze.

Last night, just after midnight, I heard footsteps on the back porch. Slow. Careful. I pulled back the curtain.

And saw myself.

Same height. Same build. Same tired eyes and old scar on the chin. Even the same sweatshirt I threw away years ago.

He didn’t knock. Just stood there, tilting his head like he was trying to remember how.

I opened the door.

But he was gone.

Except the sliding door was unlocked.

I know I locked it.

Lying on the floor, just inside the door, was a small shard of rusted metal. Looked like it had broken off the gate.

One word was carved into it

RETURN.
