I had no idea how to react to any of this.  There was a long awkward pause of about 30 or 40 seconds where I just kept my mouth shut and let Anastasia let it all out.  My first instinct, though, was to ask probably the dumbest question I could’ve asked at that moment.

“Who’s Wendy Peterson?” I asked.  I immediately regretted the question.  This was obviously a person ENORMOUSLY important to Anastasia, and here I was, just asking who the hell she was, like she was some nobody.  But Anastasia didn’t seem too upset.  I guess my question took her mind off the tragedy with her friend, since she seemed to regain her composure a bit after I asked that.

“I –“ she started, then took a few breaths.  “I believe I mentioned her in passing during our meeting in the Stairwell a few days ago.  When I was a new player, I needed guidance of my own.  Wendy was the one who gave it to me,” she explained.  “Excuse me for a moment,” she said, leaving the bedroom.  I wasn’t entirely sure what she headed out for, but when she came back with a carton of orange juice and a bottle of vodka, it got pretty clear.

“Honestly, I should’ve been expecting this…” she trailed off, somberly, pouring herself a shot from the bottle and promptly downing it.  “Her time was nearly up,” she explained.  “One cannot play Sleep Points forever, Morgan.  You can extend your time with this game all you like, but The Sandman always collects his due,” she said. 

“Would you care for any?” she asked, gesturing towards the vodka bottle.  On the one hand, she was probably one of the smartest, most athletic, and most all-around most accomplished students in school.  She had all the best grades, all the best awards, all the best everything.  And yet still, THIS was apparently the person that all those after-school specials had warned me about when they would try and scare me about “peer pressure”.

I had never been offered anything like alcohol or weed or cigarettes or ANYTHING by anyone before.  Well scratch that, now and then Ezra would offer me some skunk-weed for like 90 bucks a gram.  He used to make a killing heading down to the seedier parts of town buying the cheapest pot he could he get his hands on, and then re-selling it over at College High for a fucking LAUGHABLE mark-up. 

Now, I had never smoked before, but even I of all people could tell that whatever Ezra was selling was absolutely NOT worth what he was charging.  But a lotta freshmen at College High were so desperate for ANYTHING to get ‘em high and they’re obviously not always the sharpest tools in the shed, so even with his INSANE scalping techniques, he STILL found plenty of willing buyers.

But either way, it was ONE thing when the school edgelord offered you something.  That just kinda comes with the territory, and you pretty much know to expect it.  But to be offered alcohol – and very STRONG alcohol at that – by my school’s model student was nothing I could’ve ever expected.  Although, this was also the same girl who was telling me to steal my parents’ car keys, sneak out in the middle of the night without either one of our parents knowing, and head on over to her place.  So maybe encouraging me to break the law wasn’t THAT far out of Anastasia’s wheelhouse, come to think of it.

“Well, I DID have to drive up here.  I’m gonna have to drive back, too, y’know.  You DO realize that, right?” I said.

“Oh c’mon, one shot won’t kill you,” she said, trying to egg me on a little.  “You’ll be sober by the time you leave at 3.  And besides.  What other cars will be out at THIS time of night?  Don’t let Ezra’s hallucination tricks fool you.  He can make you see all KINDS of things, Morgan.  If you wanna know if he’s REALLY there, just poke him,” she said, downing a second shot.  Which was a bit concerning to me, because I had always heard about how you’re supposed to pace yourself with drinking and this second shot came pretty shortly after the first.

“If he’s not, your finger will go right through him.  Why, it’s practically a rite of passage for new players to be thoroughly bamboozled by one of Ezra’s visual gags,” she explained.  “Some would call it hazing.  And I would not find that to be an unfair assessment.  Ezra has a rather twisted sense of humor to say the least.  Tricking you into thinking that you were about to crash headlong into his vehicle is perfectly consistent to his character,” she said.  Had I told her about that?  I figured it didn’t really matter, since she would’ve found out either way. 

“I tend to prefer my vodka neat, though I suppose you have yet to become acclimated to the taste.  It is most off-putting to the inexperienced.  That is why I have brought this carton of orange juice, such that the alcoholic flavor of your beverage shall be masked to a comfortable extent,” she said.  “Now don’t worry, I will only pour in ONE shot.  You would hardly taste it,” she concluded, as she finished pouring out my drink.

I took a sip.  I’ll admit, it tasted a little funky, but not enough to gross me out or anything.  So, I had a little more.  Anastasia seemed quite pleased with this.  She then poured herself a THIRD shot.  So, just because I feel like keeping score, we were now only about 20 minutes into our meeting and this girl was on shot number THREE.  She had only brought the bottle out about 10 minutes before this.  Though in her defense, she didn’t have any more after that.  Y’know.  For about another 20 minutes.  Yeah.

“That should be quite enough,” she said, finishing her third shot.  She got up, put the bottle and the orange juice away, and we were back to Wendy.

“Now, Wendy is not someone you would be familiar with, because she is from upstate,” she explained.  “VERY upstate.  She lives in Barrow,” she said.  Technically, that little town in the way far north of Alaska changed its name to something else a few years before all this, but I can’t pronounce or spell it, so I’ll just be calling it by it’s old name “Barrow” since that’s easier.

“Well, ‘lived’, perhaps I should say,” she said correcting herself.  “I too lived in Barrow until fairly recently.  Though my family had moved to Alaska from St. Petersburg when I was 3, we did not move to Fairbanks.  Instead, we had moved to Barrow, where we had lived for approximately 10 years from sometime in the spring of 2007 until December 1^(st), 2017, just over a year ago now, by now.  I recall the date as it was an extremely difficult move.  Not least because I had already been playing Sleep Points for over a year by then,” she said.

“Well, what about playing Sleep Points made the move so difficult?” I asked.

“I must remind you that to hide from The Sandman, you must be asleep in your OWN bed,” she explained.  “I would not have been capable of escaping the clock by moving.  It would follow me throughout my travels, as it ultimately did.  And I knew all of this l in advance.  For a few dreadful hours, I had truly thought this impromptu move from Barrow to Fairbanks would be the death of me.  Surely this would require several nights out of my bed, I had thought,” she explained.

“And I must stress the point that this move was EXTREMELY spontaneous.  I had not been told of it even a day in advance.  One day my father told me to pack up everything into our RV, and the next, we were on the road.  Well, the metaphorical road in any case.  Now you see, a particularly complicated facet of my father’s bizarre plan to move us from Barrow to Fairbanks all at once was the fact that there are no roads connecting to Barrow.  Typically, when a person leaves town with a great deal of luggage and cargo as we did, given that we had to take all our possessions with us as we would not be returning, it is during the summer, when the oceans have thawed, allowing for various cargo ships to ferry one’s things to one’s desired destination.  Given that it was December at the time, this was simply not an option,” she explained.

“And we of course could not use an airplane to fly to Fairbanks given that everything in our old house would never fit on a commercial airliner.  The only feasible option was my father’s Recreational Vehicle.  It was extraordinarily cramped, but after a few hours when all was said and done, most of our things managed to, in principle, ‘fit’ to some uncomfortable degree or other”, she said.  “Though some things did still need to be left behind.  Such as my bedframe, for example.  Though I had strongly insisted on bringing my mattress. 

I did not know for certain if my bedframe was required to stave off The Sandman, but, given the frankly preposterous circumstances in which I had found myself, I had gambled on the notion that all I would need to stay safe would be to sleep in the same mattress.  During my first night in the RV, I was entirely unaware of whether or not I would live to see the following day.  As midnight approached, I felt my life slipping away from me, as though it were flashing before my eyes, as the old cliché goes.  I am forever grateful that my clever loophole successfully warded off my seemingly inevitable demise,” she said. 

And again, as a reminder, she’s 3 shots of hard liquor in at this point and still prattling on like a goddamn encyclopedia, just like how she usually would.  I gotta admit, I was damn near genuinely impressed with how lucid and intellectual she could still sound, even after all she had had to drink.  She didn’t even seem tipsy.  Though one thing I will say, is that while she would usually speak in an American accent, the deeper and deeper into her drinking she would get, there would always seem to be more and more bits and pieces of her original Russian accent creeping through.  Though at that point, I could hardly notice it.  But anyway, back to the story Anastasia was telling me.

“Though I must say, my father was very opposed to me taking my mattress.  And I could not, for the life of me, ascertain why.  When I asked him, he claimed it was because we needed to conserve as much space as possible, and that, because there was a pullout couch in the RV for me to sleep on, that I should use that instead.  But I knew for a fact, for an absolute FACT, that spending even a single night out of my proper bed would end my life most abruptly.  And so, I persisted.  The rest of the family was already quite opposed to the move initially, and thus I had high hopes of turning them against him, thereby overruling his decision to force me to leave behind my mattress.  And, through enough prodding from my mother, my father relented, and I took it with me,” she finished.

“Well, if the rest of your family was so against the move, then how did you guys end up going through with it?” I asked.

Anastasia seemed like she was hesitating a bit to answer the question.  For a moment, it looked like she might not have been comfortable answering, but then explained the difficult situation to me as carefully as she could.

“Now that, Morgan, is a rather… complicated question,” she said, slowly.  “My father has what one might consider a somewhat… ‘colorful’ past, shall we say,” she explained.  “Now, I am not entirely certain of the specifics as he has never been particularly forthcoming about them, but from what I gather, this colorful past of his likely has something or other to do with organized crime or perhaps something else of a similar nature.

 In any case, that phase of his life is behind him, and he would most definitely appreciate it remaining that way.  That was why we had initially emigrated from Russia in the first place.  And why we had moved to Barrow, Alaska in particular.  My father wished to make it as challenging as possible for him to be tracked down and, with Barrow being perhaps one of the most remote communities on the face of the earth, he had considered it a strong candidate. But, in late 2017, he unfortunately was tracked down after all.  And he had very little time to do anything about it.

As frustrating as it was to have to pick up everything all at once and to travel hundreds of miles through the dense Alaskan forest by RV, we all understood that whatever agents or mafiosos were after him would not spare a single one of us either, thus it was absolutely crucial that we all go into hiding as fast as possible.  And so, we acquiesced to my father’s spontaneous decision that we move to Fairbanks as there was a common understanding in the family that he would not be asking any such things of us unless ghosts of his past were coming back to haunt us all.  We knew we had no choice but to vacate the premises post-haste.

As it so happened, there was, and continues to be, a certain man in Fairbanks that, through methods unbeknownst to me, allows for my father to hide in plain sight, and to never be tracked down again.  That made Fairbanks our new safest option, and it is why my father moved us all to this town specifically.  This means that we will thankfully never have to make any such sudden change in residency ever again, “she concluded.

“Would you like another drink?” she asked, noticing I had already finished my orange juice with the shot of vodka she had given it.  “In any case, I will be pouring myself another shot,” she added.  “And I do hate to drink alone.  I find alcohol consumption far more rewarding when drinking in the company of a friend.  I am aware that I set a rather poor example by having so much all at once right in front of you, but in my own defense, you should know that I do not drink in such excess when I am alone.  I would DEFINITELY never endorse such behavior from anyone else, and it is why I am quite glad to have you around to care for me, should anything go awry,” she said.

“Well, how the hell am I supposed to do THAT if I’m already two drinks in myself?” I asked, trying to be the voice of reason in order to clamp down on all of this, since to me, it looked like things were starting to get out of hand.  I wanted to believe she wouldn’t drink like this while alone, and that she was only doing this because she was having a really tough time getting over the death of her best friend Wendy, and just felt safe with me around.  Looking back, I think at the time, that was more or less true.  Maybe not entirely true, but with the benefit of hindsight, I can confidently say that at this point, having 4 shots in an hour was a bit much, even for Anastasia.  But unfortunately for her, it wasn’t about to stay that way in the coming years.

“Morgan, if you are sober enough to ensure that I do not vomit anywhere other than the toilet, you will have done a fine job of caring for me.  And I likely will not throw up at all, as I happen to have a rather strong alcohol tolerance as it is,” she said.  For a moment, it seemed like there was a hint of pride in her voice, but that quickly went away when she realized what she had just told me, and what it implied about how much she would normally have, even when alone.

“Well, not because of how much I would TYPICALLY have to drink, I should say.  This alcohol tolerance of mine is by no means ACQUIRED,” she backtracked.  “Rather, it is a simple result of my genetics.  My forebearers had a great deal of alcohol tolerance themselves, which it would appear I have inherited,” she explained, defensively.  “Well, I’ll pour you out another, in case you would like one, but don’t feel pressure to drink it if you wouldn’t like to.  I’ll have it myself, if you are uninterested,” she offered.

On the one hand, I knew I would be scared to death to drive back home if I was two drinks in, but on the other, I really wanted this fourth shot to be her last one of the night and take away any excuse she could have to drink any further.  And then there was the fact that I didn’t wanna look ungrateful for her offer.  She had already said she considered me a friend, and it seemed really important to her that I just go along with her and have another.  This really seemed like her way of reaching out and trying to connect with me, so I just felt bad turning her down. 

Though I’ll admit, it may have also been because I had a bit of a buzz going myself and wasn’t gonna say no to a bit more of one.  Though I couldn’t let Anastasia know about any of that.  If I did, then she’d have an excuse to get me just as wasted as she was, and I seriously could NOT let something like that happen.

“There you are, my good man.  Na zdroviye,” she said, clinking her shot glass against my glass of orange juice mixed with a shot of my own.

“I’m sorry?” I asked, not quite getting the last part of what she had said.

“I said ‘na zdroviye’,” she said, a bit more slowly, enunciating the phrase she had said before.  “I can’t blame you for being confused.  It’s a common Russian saying when sharing a drink with one’s close confidants.  It means ‘for good health’,” she explained.  “Well, go on.  Say it back.  Have manners, now,” she said.

“I… don’t think I can pronounce that.  I don’t speak any Russian,” I said.

“Understandable.  I suppose it’s a somewhat difficult phrase for English speakers.  But I would still appreciate your best attempt at it,” she said.

“Well alright, but I won’t promise not to butcher it,” I said, before saying something more along the lines of like “nsdroveh”.

“Meh, close enough,” said Anastasia, before downing her fourth shot of the night.

“This is gonna have to be my last one, though.  It’s 1:40, and I’m gonna need to be on the road by about 3, if this meeting is gonna go according to your schedule,” I said.

“What time do your parents wake up on weekends?” she asked.  “If they sleep in, you might not have to leave until 4, maybe even 5.  I am entering a new stage tonight, and I would not like to go through my first night alone.  That, in tandem with the fact that we still have so much more of Sleep Points to go over, is why I am far more concerned with you leaving too early rather than too late,” she said.  “We may well need to fit two nights of discussions into one, tonight.  Have you met your sleep quota yet?” she asked.

“Well… not quite.  But should be able to get 90 minutes in during the day tomorrow.  I mean, I’ve been up for 2 days, and it really feels like the new moon has been helping.  I’ve already strung together 26 minutes so far, and since tomorrow is Saturday, I’ve got all day tomorrow to get some sleep in,” I explained.

“You cannot afford to risk that.  If you still need 90 minutes of sleep within the next 24 hours or so, then it will be far too dangerous for you to risk missing out on it by coming to visit.  You must stay at home tomorrow night. I will not let you in if you decide to come anyway,” she said.  “26 minutes after two under a waning moon is, I must again say, a rather poor sign.  Most by now would have strung together at least a full hour.  At least among those only in Stage Two, in any case.

Now, I have no doubt that, with the melatonin I have given you, you will have nothing to worry about this weekend.  The new moon will shortly be upon us, and, so long as you have melatonin at your disposal, you will most likely survive the next week or two with relative ease.  It is the full moon that concerns me.  The full moon on later stages, to be more specific.  Not only do I have my reservations about your capacity to survive the upcoming full moon in roughly three weeks’ time, but even if you do, it will still be very worrying when you are confronted with the next full moon, when you are on Stage Three.  And there are many more stages beyond that as well, each more sleep depriving than the last. 

Even though you sustained 90 minutes of sleep within 72 hours once, it was a rather close call.  And not even during a full moon, at that.  How much closer of a call will it be when it finally arrives?  I don’t see anything happening to you in the immediate future, but when I look to the long-term, I must say that your chances appear quite bleak.  Now, since you have only gotten 26 minutes of continuous sleep since your last 90-minute stretch, I suppose that would mean that you have yet utilize any of the melatonin gummies since then, correct?” she asked.

“Oh no, I haven’t had any since then,” I responded.  She seemed pretty relieved by that.  “Good.  Very good.  While this does not improve my outlook on your long-term safety, your response thankfully does not worsen my predictions, as I had feared it would.  How many melatonin gummies had you taken Wednesday night?” she asked.

“Well, I had taken 10, but that’s not too much, right?  I mean, you had said I might need to take up to 10, didn’t you?” I asked.

“While it is true that I had suggested the possibility of requiring up to 10, I had hoped that that amount would not be the amount required of you.  I had hoped that you would only need perhaps 5 or 6.  While 10 is not entirely beyond the pale, it is still quite unideal.  At this rate, you may have even run out of gummies entirely by the time of the full moon.  I will provide you with a new container of gummies if I must, but I fear that that will only be putting a band-aid over your issues.  How long will that container last?  I do not have an endless supply of sleep points to spend on you. 

I, myself, shall run out eventually, as my supply of sleep points will not be able to replenish itself if I am so constantly supplying you with increasingly potent sleeping aids.  I have plenty of sleeping supplements which I must supply myself if I wish to continue in this new and most challenging stage that I have reached tonight.  They are quite expensive, so I will have very little left over in order to cover YOUR insomnia, as well as my own. 

You are quite lucky that you did not snoop through my window during this stage.  You would have surely died, being that close to The Sandman if I had already graduated to this one by then.  That is why, along with being so inappropriate, what you had done was so dangerous.  If I had been even one Stage farther along, you would not have come out of that episode alive.

  I must now be asleep every hour on the hour from 12AM to 5AM, just I had to be during the previous stage.  I must also have been asleep for 5 minutes by the time a new hour is reached, and I must also remain asleep for another 5 minutes beyond that, where before I had only needed to be asleep on the hour, and nothing more. 

It is presently 1:50. This means that I now have only 5 minutes to fall asleep, and so I will have to leave things here for now, though I expect to see you back at 2:05, when I may wake up once more.  Sit in your truck until then.  Do not stand out in the cold.  Furthermore, and I cannot stress this enough, do not look through my window.  Even after The Sandman is gone.  I hope I have made it clear that you should never do any such thing ever again.  Now leave.  When 2:00 comes, you will not be safe anywhere in the vicinity of my house.  I have already wasted another minute explaining the situation to you, so please leave right this instant.  Go,” she finished.

She didn’t have to tell me twice.  I was already panicking for her, knowing that she had to go from being wide awake to completely past out in just 4 minutes.  Maybe the alcohol would help put her to sleep.   Maybe that was another reason she had had so much.  She needed it in order to help her be asleep on time.  Though, granted, it was probably more complicated than that. 

Either way, I knew to keep away as she had asked.  She quickly turned out the light of her bedroom, and once I had gotten my heavy winter coat back on, I sped out back to my truck as fast as I could.  I even pulled out of the driveway and drive up the street a little ways just for good measure.  And when 2:00 came, I was glad that I had.  Even from up the street, I could see that her entire house was now completely enveloped in a sinister red glow.  And I could hear The Sandman all the way from out there.  It sounded just as loud as it did when it was right next to me in own room.  With how loud it was from where I was sitting, I could only imagine how absolutely deafening it must’ve been from where Anastasia had been laying. 

How the hell was she managing to sleep so soundly through all of this?  I wasn’t really sure if I wanted to know.  In any case, I was way too busy with making sure I was far enough away to keep myself safe, as it was.  Because the glowing red light was starting to grow, and it was starting to look like it might just have been heading toward me.  I wasn’t entirely certain of what would happen if I DID get caught up in the red glow, but I had enough sense to know that it couldn’t possibly have been anything good.
