Missed my exit driving home from work last night. Not unusual. Blame a mix of ADHD and highway hypnosis. The roads are usually clear by the time my shift ends, and the next exit only adds a few minutes to my route, so I’m never devastated, just annoyed.

There’s a grove in the median of this section of the interstate, a school of trees I can never identify because I only ever see their silhouettes. Massive silhouettes, though. Sublime in the old sense of the word. The trunks rise out of a trench and get taller than my apartment building, while the tallest branches droop more than halfway down. When they catch the wind, they almost sway like jellyfish.

They were swaying like that when I drove by last night. Just shy of comforting, seeing the shadows bob in place—almost unreal. Broke me out of one trance and led me into another. I pulled off to watch for a few minutes. I considered getting out of the car. Felt this urge to get a closer look. My hand was on the latch when my roommate called and asked if I could swing by whatever store was open to buy cat food. We were about to run out. By the time I found my exit, I was lost in thought again. 

It wasn’t until I was pulling up to my complex, cat food in the seat next to me, that I realized what was so mesmerizing: none of the other trees along the highway were moving.

That’s not too strange with taller trees. Get thick into the woods with your head cocked up and you can watch the biggest trees shake in breezes you’ll never feel. A lot of weirdness has mundane explanations like that.

But I missed my exit again tonight, this time on purpose, out of curiosity. The trees hadn’t gone anywhere. They bobbed like they usually do. The only real difference was another car, an old station wagon, parked in the shoulder across from the median. Its driver’s side door was open and the hazard lights were blinking, but there wasn’t anybody inside. I pulled up behind it.

Even with my windows up, I could hear other car’s engine running, and some late-night classical music the driver left on the radio. I got out of my car with a flashlight and swept the road. A briefcase sat by the guardrail at the median. I didn’t hear any other cars coming, but I crossed carefully, just in case. When I reached the other side, I pointed my flashlight over the edge of the trench and saw a suit jacket in the dirt, and a dress shirt a little further down, then a pair of shoes, pants, and a set of thick glasses, all in a trail leading towards the grove. 

I watched the trees and thought about leaving. Whatever this person was doing down there was their business, strange as it was. There was no sound coming from the grove besides the rustling of the trees, louder than anything. 

It took me thirty minutes to realize I hadn’t moved for thirty minutes, almost as if the time had vanished. It took me another minute to realize the station wagon was gone, and I’d started to climb over the guardrail myself. 

I pulled myself back onto the asphalt. My own car was where I’d left it, but the station wagon had vanished completely.  I turned back around and tried to light the trench as much as I could without getting closer. The clothes and the briefcase were still there.

Then I noticed the license plate at the edge of the grove, and what was clutching it.

Like, I said, it’s not too strange to see taller trees moving when the shorter ones stand still, 

but the roots don’t usually start crawling.
