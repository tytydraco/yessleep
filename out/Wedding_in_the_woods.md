Wedding in the woods 

⸻

There are nights when the veil thins — nights when the world we know slips like rotten skin from something older, something that was always waiting underneath. That night, at Teufelsburg, the veil didn’t just thin — it tore.

We were drawn to the ruins like moths to a flame that promised no warmth. Past 2:30 AM, deep within the smothering woods of Rehlingen-Siersburg, we stood among the bones of a forgotten stronghold. The stones themselves seemed to breathe, exhaling ancient dust and an odor of something buried and best left undisturbed. Above us, the sky was starless — a churning black ocean without end — and the trees loomed with an unnatural stillness, like statues watching and judging.

We thought we were alone. We lit a joint, our laughter brittle and forced. Every sound we made seemed wrong, swallowed too quickly by the forest as though the very air resented our presence.

Then the music began.

A low, obscene hum bled from the shadows, at first so faint we thought we imagined it. Then came the drums — slow, deliberate, as though marking the heartbeat of something titanic slumbering just beneath the earth. And then… that trumpet.
It didn’t sound human. It sounded like a creature imitating human music — something that understood the shape of sound but not its soul.

No light, no footsteps. Only that infernal music — and a rising sense of being watched, not with curiosity, but with hunger.

In Turkish folklore, they say when you hear wedding music in the dead of night — especially deep within the woods on a Wednesday — it means the Djinn are celebrating. But folklore is mercifully vague. It spares you the horror of understanding. We should have fled. But something in the music hooked us, pulled us forward, deeper into the writhing black.

The woods closed around us. The air grew thicker, viscous, as though we were wading through some unseen membrane. The trees leaned in, whispering among themselves in a language too ancient for human throats. The ground beneath our feet seemed to pulse, alive, a slow, rhythmic breathing. Reality itself felt wrong — stretched, worn thin, like we were walking into the mouth of something that had been starving for longer than history could remember.

And there — between two skeletal trees — it stood.

Or perhaps it had always been standing there, waiting for us.

An elongated silhouette, impossibly thin and towering, its form blurring where it touched the world. It had no face. It needed none. It existed beyond the need for faces or names or shapes we could understand. Its presence was a violation — a desecration of the sanity we carried with us like fragile glass.

We did not scream.
We could not.
Terror had hollowed us out.

We ran, blindly, stupidly, while the forest shifted and twisted itself into a labyrinth of thorns and broken things. The music drilled into our skulls, bleeding into our thoughts, mutating them, making us doubt even the memory of light. Every branch that tore our skin, every root that tripped our feet — it was as though the forest itself wanted to keep us.

Somehow, by luck or by some perverse mercy, we found the car. The engine coughed to life, and we sped away into the darkness, never daring to look back. Never daring to see what might have been following.

But you cannot escape something that has already claimed you.

Even now, years later, I hear it — faint drumbeats threading through the night when the wind dies and the world holds its breath. A low hum vibrating in my bones. A trumpet wailing from a place just beyond sight.

And sometimes, when sleep slips from my grasp and the dark presses against the windows, I wonder:

What if we never left?
What if we are still there — trapped in the folds of something vast and indifferent, dreaming our escape, while the forest prepares for the final feast?
