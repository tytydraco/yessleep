A few days ago, I received a file from a journalist friend who teaches at a private university in Montevideo. I known this person for years now and the exchange with her on our countless bar nights basically made me want to try to study journalism. After I started my career we became even closer and we shared concerns about the evolution of information, social media and the infamous cerebral callosity we acquired to endure the tragedy. 

I'm not going to lie to you, a few times we shared the bed. But in general we are very good friends. I'm venting this last part, because I want you to understand that I trust this person blindly and she trusts me. Especially considering that she decided to send me a piece of information so bizarre and disturbing that making it public could have consequences that I can't even imagine. 

My friend, let's call her Valeria, was part of a public competition to accompany a minor scientific expedition to the Uruguayan Antarctic base. Her thesis was about investigating how information reception behaves in remote and isolated areas. I read it at the top, but basically tries to show that information circulates and is received in a particular way in these circumstances by a group of unfamiliar people living under extreme climatic and isolation conditions, having as an example, life in submarines and in military bases in Siberia and the Antarctic base gave her the chance to observe some of her postulates up close. 

Finally, she was chosen and traveled with this scientific group in a commercial flight Montevideo - Santiago de Chile to later arrive at Punta Arenas and fly to the Antarctic base.

The last communication I had with her before she sent me the almost 90 photographic captures of the diary, was on March 15, 2024.

We talked over the phone about how the weather was in Montevideo, that it does not stop raining and the cars are practically floating on the streets. She told me that the transport that was going to take them back was having mechanical problems and they would probably have to order spare parts for the plane from Punta Arenas. then She told me that it is freaking cold down there and his colleagues are all very boring. Nobody has whisky for the evenings. We laughed about that part because I told her to bring at least one bottle of Grappa in her purse.

Before saying goodbye, she told me they had spotted some old metal structures south of the base. The soldiers tell her that in was safe to go near that part so she was going to explore them. It wasn't there when they first arrived and that the recent and atypical heat wave probably must have exposed it. I told her to be careful and we said goodbyes.

Three days later I received an email. “Valeria shared a file with you.” As I start to see what it was about she calls me.

“Mauro? MAURO!, can you hear me?” She said in a nervous and excited voice.

“I can barely hear you, what happened?”I asked half asleep, while still lying on my bed.

“Listen to me carefully, don't talk, just listen” I could tell by her agitation that she was walking fast or maybe running. The creaking footsteps in the snow could be heard in the background. in the distance, a catastrophe-type siren was blaring.

“Are you alright? What happened? What's that noise?” I said, now sitting on the edge of my bed.

“I sent you a file. Transfer it to a flash drive, delete history and reset your cell phone, the computer and your email address. I'll explain everything later, it'll be worth it.”

“What? What are you talking about Vale?, what for? Tell me what's going on - I started to yell at her, in slide panic.

“Listen, I found something that is not supposed to exist. In the diary he explains everything. I'm going back to the base, I think someone is following me, I set off an alarm or something. Save that file for me until I get there and remember that... “ 

There were two loud booms and the sound of water invading the transmission. A choked bubbling and cracking sound reminded me of ice collapsing. My friend had fallen into the water, in Antarctica. 

“HEY, are you OK?! What happened?!” - I kept screaming hysterically until the call was cut off.

I looked at my cell phone for a second. My hands were shaking, I tried calling several times but the phone went dead. I looked at the compressed file. I jumped up and ran to the dining room furniture, frantically looking for a white flash drive that had to be in a drawer somewhere. I couldn't find it, so I went back to my desk. I pulled the drawer so hard that it came off the rail and fell to the floor. I started to dig through my belongings on the floor, coins, papers, cards, nothing. I thought, I struggled to remember where I had fucking put it. Finally I saw my backpack peeking out from behind the desk chair, I jumped on it and in the second small pocket from the inside, there was a cheap white 16G flash drive. I put it in the pc, downloaded the file directly there, took it out and fabric restored the entire system on the computer. I do the same with my cell phone as Valeria said. At the time I didn't even question if those measures really prevented me from being tracked, and the idea that that was the reason made panic run through my body like lightning. Sitting on the floor of my room next to the mess, my body was numb with tension. After a few seconds, I rebooted my cell phone to try to call Lucia, her sister.

“Hello?”

“Lucia, it's that you? I think something bad happened to Vale, I hear her over the phone as if she fell into the water, and some rumbling. I don't know what I heard, I think she got into some trouble or some place she shouldn't have been - I realized that I was mumble and not saying anything clear. For some reason, I didn't mention the file.

“It can't be Mauro, I just spoke to her on the phone. She was at the airport in Santiago de Chile at the boarding lounge, we talked for about half an hour, she told me she was bringing a fancy bourbon to share and…”

I stopped listening, it didn't make sense, how could it be? what the fuck is going on!

“Mauro, are you ok? Is something wrong? it's too early, are you sure you didn't dream it?”

“Did you talk to her? half an hour ago? But...,” I exclaimed without being able to hide my confusion. 

“Are you... sure it was her?”

“Yes, of course you moron, it's my sister! Did you smoke pot again on an empty stomach?”

“No, you're right, nevermind, thanks Lucia, talk to you soon.” I ended the call without letting her say goodbye.

Had I dreamt it? I erased everything now, how will I know if I dreamt it? I hesitated absurdly.

This is surreal, I thought to myself as I looked at the flash drive in my hand. I refocused my attention and went to the attic looking for my brother's old laptop he left me before going to live in Spain. It was practically useless, but it was enough to see the file. I turned it on, waited for the decrepit Windows XP to load, and put the flashdisk in, opened the compressed folder and found two files.

“LabNotes.pdf”

“PersonalDiary.pdf”

I decided to open the journal first. From what I interpreted from the loading order of the screenshots, after reading it, I opened the image of the last page.

I transcribe as is.

*Day 243 of the 2nd mission 10: 40 am. March 12, 2019.*

*I am the head researcher of the Psychological Area at the UN Antarctic base; I'm currently assigned to Project Sisyphus categorized as the highest classified rank.*

*This is going to sound crazy, but the person living with my family is my clone.* 

*It still surprises me when I say it out loud, but after being able to replicate the brain-muscular history (a perfect copy of our memory) of any person and having mastered replicating every cell of our bodies at any age, it was only a matter of time before the development of social biotechnology would emerge. Now and by worldwide agreement, as a complete secret.* 

*There is absolutely no shame or a shred of ethics in what we do, there is no longer any constraint on what we can do to the subjects for the sake of research. That haunts me every day.*

*It all went to shit so fast, I doubt anyone will come to our rescue. The protocol says so, the base in the face of an imminent security risk will erase itself. The structure was designed to collapse methodically following a protocol of incineration and sinking. The immediate perimeter has underwater mines that make the ice collapse almost imperceptibly, but deadly to anyone who tries to leave.* 

*No one can escape from the base, neither the research staff nor the subjects. Our place in the world is already taken.*

*I only hope that this journal along with my lab notes will be found at some point. I managed to construct a small insulating gasket for it so I trust it will survive in case this part of the building collapses as well.*

*Please use this data to let the world know what happened here and don't let perversity define us once again.*

*To my family: I love you and miss you every minute.*

*B.*

At the exact moment I ended the reading I received a video call that made me jump with fright, it is... 

Valeria.

With my pulse shaking, I answered the call.

“Hi you! The flight was delayed, can you believe it? This one is absolutely in my top three, worst trips of my life. I'm really hungry and everything is so expensive here. What are you up to? Tell me something, please, I'm soooo bored!”

I looked at her with confusion and I couldn't manage to pronounce words. When I was about to modulate an answer she interrupted me.

“What's the matter Mauro?, are you on pause? Is the signal OK? HELLO! Can you hear me? Can you see me?” She started to walk through the boarding lounge looking for better signal

“Yes yes, Valeria I can hear you.”

She laughed and looked at me with a face between sensual and serious, and continued.

“Do you miss me?” while raising the phone jokingly as she typically does in her selfie pose.

“Valeria, don't you remember calling me earlier today?”

“I? called you? Nop. Why? Ah! By the way, did you know there are penguins in Tierra del Fuego? I would have liked to go and see them.” She continued his verbose conversation in a carefree tone, with her typical hand gestures and playing with his hair.

“Well, at last!” She interrupted herself and shouted, jumping up from her chair.

“We are being called to board, see you in a couple hours!” She said goodbye with a smiling sonority, and began to walk towards the boarding gate. 

But at the last second, before ending the call, her gesture changed. She looked directly at the camera with a hardened and emotionless face and almost mechanically, she whispered.

“(I'm going to retrieve that diary).”

My stomach dropped to the floor and I could feel as if my blood was running cold with fear. I could not shake the awful and eerie feeling that this person, who was returning, whom I had never in my life called by her full name, was not my friend.
