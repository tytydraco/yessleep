I swiftly evaded a razor-sharp claw aimed at my gut, the void energy crackling beneath my skin as my enhanced reflexes kicked in. The movement triggered a flash of memory - Alpha's voice during combat training: "Let the power flow naturally, Dell. Don't force it." Pushing the memory aside, I unsheathed my custom silver combat knife (a gift from Elizabeth, enhanced with her void-stabilizing runes) and my gunmetal karambit. As Manson had briefed: "Type-A Raikans require precise termination. Clean, quick, minimal void discharge."

The forest's darkness posed no challenge to my enhanced vision - another "gift" from Project Eclipse that I'd learned to control with Elizabeth's help. A malicious smile spread across my face as I finally looked at the beast, my void-touched irises glowing a subtle crimson in the darkness.

The creature's dark silver fur glistened under the moonlight, its molecular structure already mapped by my enhanced senses. I traced my eyes up its body, noting the ferocious 4-inch-long claws that had nearly torn me apart moments ago. The SSIC briefing file Manson had provided flashed through my mind: "Type-A Raikans: Enhanced regeneration, heightened aggression, weakness at the third vertebrae." Finally, my gaze met the lycanthropic creature's face, revealing a long, bloody maw adorned with jagged fangs.

The beast lunged, and time seemed to slow - not from fear, but from my void abilities automatically adjusting my temporal perception. For a split second, I saw Echo's face superimposed over the scene, her last training session with me: "Remember, Dell, control in combat isn't just about power - it's about precision." I inhaled deeply, executing a front flip onto its back, swiftly dropping into a squatting position. With precision, I drove my silver combat knife deep into the creature's spine. Its body convulsed and trembled before coming to a sudden halt. A weak whimper escaped the Lycan before it succumbed to eternal slumber.

Dusting myself off as I rose from the fallen beast, a mix of exhaustion and triumph coursed through my body. My hands trembled slightly, a lingering aftermath of the adrenaline-fueled battle, as I reached into my pocket, searching for something. My fingertips swiftly recognized the object I sought. I retrieved the SSIC (Strategic Supernatural Investigation Command) issued pager and used it to inform Sparow, my client, that the target had been dealt with. Here's a reenactment of our conversation, but first, allow me to introduce myself as Delta—the name known in the underground world.

The reason I'm writing this e-journal of mine is to document the downfall and destruction of the DSI at my hands. Also, it's an outlet to regulate my psyche—a suggestion from Elizabeth to help with void stabilization. And so, I'll also tell stories of my hunts. I hope Commander Walker doesn't find these; she'll be pissed, ha. Enough of that, though—back to the point at hand.

\[THE CONVERSATION\]

Delta: "Target neutralized. Your cleanup crew can proceed."

Sparow: "Impressive work. First-person, I've seen take down a Type-A Raikan single-handedly. The SSIC data was right about your capabilities."

Delta: "If you're fishing for another contract, you'll have to wait. My void energy needs stabilizing, and Elizabeth's scheduled maintenance can't wait."

Sparow: "Sharp as ever. Well then, safe travels, Agent Delta."

Delta: "Just Delta. I left agent designations behind with the DSI."

I slid the pager back into my pocket and made my way to my 1967 black Impala "Whiskey". Opening the trunk, I securely stowed the black and purple accented Seraphis .454 pistol in its case, closing the trunk with a firm thud. BEEP BEEP signaled the unlocking of my car door. I approached the vehicle, opened the door, and settled inside, inserting the key into the ignition and turning it. Pulling out of the parking lot, I began my journey back to HQ to collect my well-earned pay.

As I drove, my gaze caught the picture hanging from the rearview mirror—a snapshot of me and my old team. It triggered a dissociative state, plunging me into the dark recesses of my mind.

\[The Flashback\]

My vision gradually returned, revealing a masked man I soon recognized as a Dawn Sun Initiative (DSI for shorthand) researcher. The transition from the tranquil drive to this harrowing memory felt seamless, as though the past was waiting to resurface at any moment.

Researcher: "Subjects Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, Delta, and Echo, otherwise known as The phonetics are all ready for void injection."

Memories flooded my mind—moments spent with my team, the camaraderie we shared. But then, a surge of red overwhelmed me as the horrendous mission crossed my thoughts. **THEY** had ordered me to do it—to kill my friends. I fought against their commands, but they had implanted some device in my head, forcing me to commit unspeakable acts against those I held dear. The worst memory began—the one where I was forced to sit back and watch, like a helpless spectator in my own body, as my friends were mercilessly murdered.

Sensations then surged back into my limbs, and the realization of being strapped to a table hit me. Staying calm, I assessed my situation as memories slowly flooded my mind. The restraints on my arms released, and while my primal instinct urged me to rampage and find an escape, the presence of heavily armed guards made that option seem impossible. Instead, I chose to strategize a way out.

But the flashback deepened. The other test subjects - my team and my family - were strapped to identical tables. Echo's frightened eyes met mine, Bravo's quiet prayers, Charlie's determined silence, and Alpha's attempted jokes to keep our spirits up. Then came the burning of the first void injection, the screams, the-

HOOONK

Snapping back to reality, the blaring horn of an incoming transport truck partially blinded me. I was driving straight toward it, and everything around me seemed to slow down. My heightened abilities activated, causing time and space to move slower than me. The speed at which I moved in this heightened state was incomprehensible, making it appear like I was teleporting.

With a swift maneuver, I corrected the car's trajectory. The void's energy merged with mine, helping to stabilize the temporal shift as I returned to normal speed. As we passed, the truck driver's face showed the expected mix of confusion and fear.

The rest of the drive to SSIC HQ was uneventful. As I pulled into the secure parking area, I spotted Manson waiting by the entrance, his familiar grin visible even at this distance.  
He welcomed me with a familiar "Hello, D. How was the mission?"

Manson stood at his usual spot, his SSIC clearance badge reflecting the fluorescent lights. His presence always triggered memories of St. Mary's - two scared kids sharing comic books under worn blankets before the DSI tore our lives apart.

Delta: "It was as mundane as usual. I nearly wrecked my car again."

Manson: "Another close encounter with a truck, I presume?"

Delta: "You know me too well, mate."

Manson: "I have something new for you."

He handed me a folder.

Delta: "After my vacation, because I'm utterly exhausted right now."

Manson: "Sounds fine to me. Just know that this job is directly from the organization, which means the payout will be substantial. However, it also means it could be dangerous."

Delta: "Sounds fun to me. I'll call you in a week."

As I quickly exited the building, filled with anticipation for the job at hand, I happily skipped towards my car. A week later, I sat in the McDonald's parking lot, the folder spread across my steering wheel. Whiskey's engine hummed steadily. Elizabeth's latest maintenance session had left my void energy perfectly balanced, though the folder's contents threatened that stability. My SSIC-issued earpiece activated with a thought, connecting to Manson's secure line.

Mason: "Hello, Maroon. It's been exactly a week, just as you said. You're a very precise man."

Delta: "Indeed I am. So, what's the monster?"

Mason: "They call it the Prowler, and according to the Commander, there are seven distinct types, each representing one of the seven deadly sins. Currently, you're faced with the Prowler of Pride. They hunt by disorienting their prey and causing them to experience traumatic memories. So, be warned."

Delta: "Alright, I have one more question, and then I'll let you go. How do I go about exterminating this pest?"

Mason: "Light, and I mean a lot of it. The Prowler's core should be revealed once it's exposed to enough light. If you remove it, the Prowler will destabilize and go into some sort of stasis. Alternatively, if you crush it, the Prowler will die outright. So, it's your choice how you want to take care of the monster."

Delta: "Good to know. I'll call you once it's done."

After ending the call, I popped the trunk, retrieving my specialized gear bag. Elizabeth's runes glowed faintly on each piece of equipment, designed to maintain void stability even under extreme psychological stress. The abandoned mall loomed ahead, its dark windows seeming to watch my preparations.

Four hours of setting traps - each enhanced with void energy and stabilized by Elizabeth's runic work. I retreated to my car, using the time to eat while monitoring the trap network through my void-enhanced senses. The 20-piece McNuggets served as both dinner and a small reminder of normalcy - something Elizabeth had insisted was essential for maintaining psychological balance.

As night fell, my eyes shifted to their combat state, void energy enhancing my vision. The mall's interior mapped itself in my mind, showing one trap already triggered - far more sophisticated than standard supernatural entities. My pistol, nicknamed "Cacophony Queen," resonated eagerly in its holster as I entered the building, ready to face whatever memories the Prowler might weaponize against us.

Suddenly, a loud boom sounded behind me, and a wave of pressure shot from my hand instinctively, stopping the beastly leg of my attacker just inches away from my head with ease. Tightening my grip on its leg, I effortlessly threw it through the wall, causing it to hit the ground. However, it quickly recovered and swept its leg, knocking me off balance. My face came perilously close to the ground, but before I could strike back, it touched my chest.

In an instant, a wave of pure dread washed over me as I fell back into a memory I always tried to avoid. But then, everything went dark. Out of the darkness emerged Echo, with all the wounds I had uncontrollably inflicted upon her still visible across her body. She began to cry plasma, taking the place of tears streaming down her face.

Echo's anguished voice pierced through the darkness, accusing me with sorrowful betrayal. Alpha emerged from the shadows, his wounded form mirroring Echo's distress. "Dell, why did you betray us? I looked up to you like an older brother," he cried out, his voice filled with anguish and confusion. The chorus grew louder as Bravo and the rest of my fallen squad mates materialized, their voices blending into a cacophony of pain and anger. "Monster! It's all your fault! Why didn't you stop it?"

The weight of their accusations threatened to consume me, and in that moment, I felt my sanity teetering on the edge. Roaring with a mix of anger and desperation, I fought against the illusion that surrounded me. The false images faded, revealing my actual situation—suspended upside down in a spider cocoon.

Reacting instinctually, my nails protracted into claws, slicing through the sticky webbing that ensnared me. With a swift motion, I tore my arm free, breaking through the cocoon and landing gracefully on the ground. As I stood on my feet, the remnants of the illusion vanished, leaving me in the midst of the Prowler's lair, ready to confront the true threat that lay ahead.

The air in the Prowler's lair crackled with tension as I faced off against the embodiment of pride. Its menacing form towered before me, its eyes gleaming with malicious intent. Determination welled within me, pushing aside the haunting memories that threatened to consume me moments ago. This was the moment I had trained for, the moment to prove my strength and reclaim my honor.

Without hesitation, I activated my enhanced abilities, feeling the surge of energy coursing through my veins. My reflexes sharpened, allowing me to anticipate the Prowler's movements. It lunged at me with blinding speed, attempting to strike me with its razor-sharp claws. But I evaded its attack effortlessly, my movements almost too quick to be tracked by the human eye.

As the Prowler's strikes grew more frenzied, I focused on its core, its power source. Remembering Mason's words, I knew that exposing the core to intense light would weaken the creature. Channeling my energy, I conjured a brilliant sphere of light in my palm, illuminating the darkened lair.

The Prowler recoiled, its prideful façade wavering as the light pierced its dark essence. Seizing the opportunity, I launched myself forward, striking the creature with a flurry of precise blows. Each strike weakened its defenses, bringing it closer to its ultimate defeat.

But the Prowler was not easily vanquished. It retaliated with a devastating burst of energy, threatening to overwhelm me. Gritting my teeth, I summoned every ounce of strength within me, refusing to yield. With a fierce determination, I unleashed a devastating counterattack, my strikes hitting with pinpoint accuracy.

As the battle raged on, the lair quivered under the sheer force of our clash. The resounding echoes of our fight reverberated through the corridors, bearing witness to the eternal struggle between light and darkness, pride and redemption.

After executing a meticulously calculated strike, the Prowler was forcefully propelled into the path of the carefully positioned light source. In that critical moment, the creature's core was laid bare before my eyes, a vulnerable target waiting to be seized. Seizing the opportunity swiftly, I captured the core, destabilizing the Prowler into a state of suspended animation, trapped in a liminal realm between existence and oblivion. Securing the core within my possession, I was immediately alerted by the beeping of my pager, signaling incoming messages from Mason and Elizabeth.

Mason wasted no time in acknowledging my triumphant feat:

\[Pager conversation\]

Delta: The Pride Pillar has been vanquished.

Mason: Impressive as always, D.

Delta: As discussed, payment can be directed to my designated account.

Mason: Always mindful of the financial aspects, aren't you, brother? Very well, I shall initiate the transfer.
