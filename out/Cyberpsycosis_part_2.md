Hey all, I’ve had a busy and strange couple of days, sorry if the first post got removed, it should be back up soon. I’ll get into the stranger stuff in a sec but for now I remember the beginning of Vic’s tech obsession. I remember most of the details but it’s a bit hazy, it was back when me and Vic were in elementary school, sixth grade I believe. We always used to fuck around in the woods and one spot in particular that we called the tower. It was an abandoned power plant that had a giant cell tower in the middle of it. We used to play explorers, cops and robbers, and other little games like that. But one day stood out to me. we decided that instead of doing the usual stuff we’d do, that we should go into the building that sat next to it. I was scared, always was but I followed Vic. He said that we should play hide and seek, I reluctantly agreed and we rock paper scissored for it. I lost, I always sucked at rock paper scissors. You know the drill, I counted to 30 and went to find him. the building was in pretty good shape for as long as it’s been there and I was surprised to find Vic right away, he was sitting in the ground staring at a blank computer screen. I called out to him and he didn’t respond, so shook him by the shoulders and he snapped out of his trance. I asked him what he was doing and he said “ the tall man told be to follow him, to show me the truth, eternity”. I didn’t know what he was saying but it stuck out to me because of how monotone he said it. I was pretty freaked out and I told him I’d race him to staticas(our local arcade) and he said “you got it!”. From then on he was always obsessed with technology, kinda freaked me out. 
 
But on the other hand I was able to get into Vic’s computer, no password required. He had the basic stuff, games, emails and tech forums. But the only thing that was weird was the file he had saved. They were a handful of journal entries. This struck me as strange because I’d never thought of Vic as a guy to write journal logs. But I began to read through them, well almost all of them, one of them is locked by a password. I’ve always had chronic insomnia, gotta get meds for it. Always thought of it as a curse, but the extra time gave an opportunity to read Vic’s logs. The first few are normal just Vic talkin about his work and the department and games and forums he’d been on. But on the fourth entry he started to talk about some website that he been really into, he explained it as a ”place beyond humanity” and a “space where you can become more than human”. 

It started to get weird after that, I started to hear weird noises from around my house, I got up and checked all around my first and second floor, but nothing was out of place. I began to read the rest of the logs. the rest were either cryptic, almost scripture like writing with random strings of letters and numbers, while  one of ‘em was just random words, I’ll put them here.

“ floor, sideways, zeitgeist, Albuquerque, destitute, complete, centipede, fireplace, trunk, body, eternity, ascend, ascend, ascend”

Weird stuff, I know but it gets stranger. At the bottom of one of the logs is a string of numbers and letters, when I searched it into google it showed a location, they were coordinates. As I was about research the location my power shut off, and my parents started to call my name from downstairs, I don’t live with them anymore and they are halfway across the world. I’m sitting in my closet with my door barricaded with my dresser. Their voices are garbled, metallic sounding and they’re knocking on my door now. I’m not leaving till tomorrow where I can hopefully get the power situation sorted. Those aren’t my parents.
