I'm not sure how many people are noticing this, but something’s going on. Something real. Something wrong.

It started with the ocean. I was staying at my aunt’s house for a week—she lives on the coast, the kind of place where the sea is always a bit grey and mysterious, like it’s keeping secrets. One morning, I looked out over the water and saw something I still can’t explain. For a split second, a patch of the ocean cleared. Crystal clear. I could see everything underneath—fish, rocks, long threads of algae swaying unnaturally still. Then it was gone. Back to murk. I blinked hard, convinced I imagined it. But it stayed with me. Like it hadn’t been a trick of the light, but a glimpse through a crack.

Then the trees started changing.

It was autumn—bright, burning leaves in red and gold. Beautiful. But one tree on my street began turning green again. Day by day, the orange leaves reversed their decay, reshaping themselves into healthy green growth. Like it was going backwards. I even took photos, but the color shift never showed on screen. When I tried to show someone, they shrugged. Maybe they saw it. Maybe they didn’t.

Other things began to feel off. I’d buy fresh fruit, only to find it rotted by the time I got home. Not overripe—fully black and sunken. But if I left it in the bag with the others, they stayed fine. Take it out—and every other fruit would rot within seconds. It made no sense. And when I searched for answers, I’d find forum posts describing similar events… only to have those threads vanish the next day. Posts on Reddit. Tweets. Gone. Like they were erased.

At first, I thought it was just me. But slowly, I started hearing things. From friends. Strangers. Conversations overheard on buses: "My dog won’t stop barking at the corner of the kitchen." "I heard birds chirping at 2 a.m." "My clocks are out of sync but only in the bathroom." Everyone had something. Small, stupid things. But all strange. All new.

There was no official news. No government warnings. But local forums buzzed. One group kept popping up—calling themselves the Source Code Guys. No one really knew who they were. At first, people said they were gamers with too much time on their hands, just theorizing about simulations for internet points. But rumors spread quickly. A few usernames were traced—one linked to a defunct military contractor, another tied to a classified cyber-ops program that had gone offline in 2009.

Whispers began: they were ex-military techs, analysts, systems engineers—people who had once worked in simulation warfare. Projects built to mirror real-world conflict scenarios with uncanny accuracy. But something had gone wrong. Some said the simulations started to spill into reality—odd events, timing errors, anomalies no one could explain. The projects were shut down. Silenced.

Now, the Source Code Guys were tracking everything. Every fruit that rotted too fast. Every mirrored delay. Every backwards sunset. They weren’t just observing—they were warning us. Quietly. Carefully. And then, suddenly, they disappeared. Websites scrubbed. Forum accounts gone. Just a single trace remained: a half-loaded page that crashed every time I tried to scroll. The title read: “Echo begins in silence.”

I started feeling watched. Not in the dramatic, stalker kind of way. It was subtler. Like the walls remembered where I stood. Like the air shifted when I wasn’t looking. Like something was watching—not me, but the pattern of me.

Then came the noise.

Not a sound, exactly. More like a pressure in my chest. A deep hum I couldn’t locate. Sometimes I’d wake up with a metallic taste in my mouth and no memory of my dreams. Sometimes the fridge would freeze milk solid while the vegetables wilted. Lights flickered. My own voice echoed back to me half a second too late in empty rooms.

And the TV...

It would play fine—until static swallowed the screen. Then it would flip to a channel I never selected. Always the same image: a statue of a monk-like figure, short and round, eyes closed, a delicate veil over its face. Around it, tiny figures climbed toward it, up a steep, impossible slope. I never saw them move, but each time I looked, they were closer. No matter how many times I changed the channel, it would stay locked for minutes. Then, without warning, flip back to normal.

I didn’t understand it at first. But lately, I’ve started to think the image isn’t just random. It feels like a warning—or a countdown. Like something watching us back.

The rhythm of it all started to make sense—if you looked long enough. A pattern. Like a system running a test. Like something was… adjusting us.

It feels like the very fabric of reality is under attack. Not just our routines, not just our memories—the actual physics of the world. Bent. Fraying. And we have no control over it.

Then, just two days ago, the ocean cleared again. But this time, I wasn’t the only one watching. Three helicopters rushed in low, fast, synchronized. Military. They swept across the water in tight formation, like they were searching for something. Like they knew. Over the next few days, I heard more helicopters and military vehicles. No warning, nothing. 

That night, the BBC interrupted its regular programming. The headline was blunt. No context. No voiceover.

"Earth is under attack."
"Scientists are grappling to understand the cause. Citizens are urged to remain indoors and limit communication."

Then—static.

The screen fuzzed. A high-pitched noise rang in the background. The lights in my apartment cut out for five full seconds. When they came back, the broadcast was gone. My phone stopped connecting to the internet. Even my saved videos were blank.

I asked my friends. All of them. No one saw the broadcast.

They said nothing had changed. They said I must have dreamed it.

But I know what I saw.

If you saw it too—if you saw the same thing I did—please, respond. Please. I just need to know I’m not the only one.

A few minutes after I posted that, I refreshed the page.

There was one reply.

No username. Just a blank icon. No flair. No message history.

It said:

"You already asked. Stop asking again."
