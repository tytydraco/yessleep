Alright, I’m trying this for the third time. The first time, I’d just finished typing when the smoke detector went off—no fire, no smoke, just blaring alarms like the whole building was about to go up in flames. I had to check every room, convinced something was burning, but there was nothing. When I came back, the power cut out. The second time, my laptop bricked. The screen flickered, and then it just... died. It won’t turn on no matter what I try. So now I’m on a borrowed tablet, hoping I can finally get this out without it crashing. My hands are cramping from the cold (and from typing), but I’m soldiering through because I need to tell this story.



My name is Jane, and I'm 19 years old. For as long as I can remember, I’ve been driven. I skipped parties and vacations, practically inhaling business books—anything that might give me an edge. For me, relaxation involved editing the school newspaper’s articles at home after a long day’s work, all in hopes of breaking free from my small town, where the gas station doubles as a social hub and you can find a two-headed snake preserved in a jar at the local curiosities shop.



My latest attempt to leave started with a glimmer of hope. A friend of my dad's, the CEO of a moderately big company, was going to recommend me for a position that could change my life. It was a real job, with real potential. I had spent weeks preparing, rehearsing answers to possible interview questions, and even researching the organization. My mom left us years ago, so it’s been just Dad and me. I love him, I really do—but every night, I dreamed of moving on to better places, somewhere my work, my skills… they might actually matter. 



But then it all fell apart. Dad came home with the news: my potential boss had been fired, they found out he'd been lining his pockets with company funds. My heart sank. Just another stroke of cosmic bad luck. “Great timing, universe,” I thought. “Life really knows how to kick a girl when she’s down.” Dad’s got a weird sense of humor about the whole thing. He jokes that I must have the world’s worst luck. “Maybe they'll put your head next to the double-headed snake at the curiosities shop,” he laughs. It’s his way of lightening the mood, but sometimes I wonder if he’s onto something.



That same week, I decided to apply for another position—one I thought was a safe bet. After all, I had the qualifications. I could practically hear them tell me I had the job in my head. So, I polished my résumé again, dressed up, and headed to the local community center for an open interview.



As I arrived, everything seemed normal. The sun was shining, the birds were chirping, and the scent of fresh coffee wafted through the air. \*But as I stepped inside, there was an unusual tension in the air. People seemed quieter than usual, like they were waiting for something to go wrong.\*



The line was long, and I stood there, rehearsing my pitch. "Hi, I'm Jane Comer. I graduated with honors last year from Bundy High..." I could almost see myself in that office, away from the gas station and the endless cycle of small-town monotony, I fantasized about working late nights in something more exciting than a glorified convenience store, but just as I reached the front of the line, the power went out, pulling me out from my daydream. The lights flickered, and a murmur rippled through the crowd.



“Just a minor outage,” said the woman at the desk, her voice steady, but her eyes darted toward me, carrying a hint of blame. “It happens sometimes.” The way she spoke made it feel like I was somehow at fault, just like I always seem to end up in the wrong place at the wrong time.



After a few minutes, the lights flickered back on, but everything felt different now. People were looking at each other nervously, glancing toward the windows. A few moments later, an emergency siren blared outside, causing everyone to panic. The doors burst open, and a man rushed in, panting. "You have to evacuate!" he shouted. "There's a hurricane warning!"



I froze, my heart pounding. My chance to escape had just slipped away again, swallowed by the chaos of a sudden storm. But how had no one seen it coming? Just a few minutes ago, the sky was fine. The clouds seemed to have rolled in just as quickly as my hopes vanished, and I couldn’t shake the feeling that the storm had waited, biding its time until I was ready to leave.



I joined the crowd moving toward the back rooms, huddled together with strangers as the winds howled outside. All I could do was wait for the storm to pass, hoping it wouldn’t take my dreams with it.



Days passed, and I found myself back at the gas station, ringing up customers and restocking shelves. October had rolled around, and the whole town was buzzing about Halloween, with decorations popping up everywhere. People were stocking up on candy, spooky décor, and the evergreen spirits that were always popular this time of year, as if following an unchanging script. The routine felt suffocating. My hands shook with irritation as I rang up the hundredth bottle of boxed wine. “You still working here, Janey?” Yeah, Karen, thanks for the reminder.



I worked the night shifts with Kenny and Steve. Kenny is just a sweet, big dopey guy, always looking out for everyone and generally being chill; he's basically a golden retriever in human form. Steve is… well, Steve is what happens when you strip away education, purpose, and structure and replace them with energy drinks, Flat Earth videos, and shady imageboards. He’s a walking conspiracy theory factory—like \_that\_ uncle you try to avoid at family gatherings.



In the middle of it all was the store’s ancient radio—a relic so old I was amazed it still worked, but Don, the owner, insisted it be on at all times. Tonight, it was blaring Taylor Swift’s \_All You Had to Do Was Stay\_, a song I particularly loathe. Somehow, its chirpy melody grated against my nerves even more than usual, almost as if it knew.



Tonight, as I was restocking gum by the counter, Steve approached, cradling something in his hands like it was a lost treasure. “Jane, you gotta see this,” he whispered, eyes wide with excitement. He slowly opened his hands to reveal a bug—small, with unsettlingly large mandibles and legs that twitched like they were dancing to some silent beat.



“Isn’t it freaky?” he grinned. “They’re everywhere this time of year. Some folks say they cause dementia and—get this—zombification. What do you think?”



I glanced at the bug, then back at Steve. “I think you’ve been watching too many conspiracy videos again.”



He leaned in, still grinning, and asked, “You ever notice weird synchronicities, Jane? Like, things lining up, like the universe is trying to tell you something?”



As if on cue, the store’s ancient radio buzzed, and \_All You Had to Do Was Stay\_ by Taylor Swift crackled back on. It was like the universe had personally selected the song to haunt me, a song I absolutely hated. Steve’s grin widened, and he tapped his temple knowingly.



“See? The universe.”



“Steve..., fuck off,” I scoffed, though a part of me couldn’t help but wonder. What if he was right? I shot him a look that said, \_not today.\_ But the thought lingered like a bad tune stuck in my head.



After my shift, I tried to head home, but, naturally, the car wouldn’t start. I slammed the steering wheel, muttering under my breath until Kenny spotted me from across the lot and waved me over.



“Need a ride?” he asked with that laid-back smile, like my whole world hadn’t just spiraled into a bad joke.



“Guess so,” I mumbled, sliding into the passenger seat of his beat-up Chevy. As we pulled up in front of my house, I thanked him and stepped out, hoping maybe that’d be the end of it.



Then, \_splatt\_—a fresh dollop of bird crap landed squarely on my shoulder. I looked up at the empty sky and groaned, “Perfect. Just perfect.”



Kenny snorted, trying to keep a straight face. “Well, see you tomorrow.”





One afternoon, as I was getting ready for my shift, that damn Taylor Swift song started playing on the radio again. It felt like a personal attack. Just then, an old woman shuffled into the store, her eyes wild and unfocused like she was on drugs or something. She stood at the counter, her skin tanned and leathery, like she’d spent decades baking under the sun. Her wiry white hair stuck out in these uneven tufts, giving her this ghostly, disheveled vibe that would’ve fit right in at a Halloween party. But it was her eyes that really got me. They flickered around like they were caught between a foggy haze and a laser-focused panic, shifting erratically as if her brain was ricocheting off the walls. One minute, she’d look totally zoned out, like she was lost in her own little world; the next, her face would light up with this wild intensity, twisting her lips into a shaky grimace.



And to top it all off, there were these weird little October bugs crawling on her clothes and tangling in her hair. They were small, with pincers like a scorpion but without the stinger, just flitting around as if they were doing a weird little dance before biting her. It was unsettling, to say the least. I glanced at Steve, who was half-listening while reading some random magazine about local cryptids. He barely noticed the scene unfolding in front of him.



She turned her gaze to Kenny, one eye narrowing as if trying to see past him, muttering incoherently before breaking into a raspy laugh that cut off as quickly as it began. I swear, her face kept shifting, like she was a radio between stations, tuning in and out of reality. 



The old woman leaned closer to the counter, her breath reeking of something rotten, and mumbled incoherently. It was like she was trying to say something important, but all that came out was a jumble of words mixed with coughs and wheezes. I felt a chill run down my spine as she suddenly pointed a gnarled finger at me, her voice rising in pitch. “You! You’re \*\*trapped\*\*, you know! Alswell will never let you go! You’ll end up just like the rest of us!”



She stopped talking, her smile fading, and turned slowly toward the energy drinks,  staring at the glass like it held some hidden message. Her lips moved as if counting, murmuring numbers I couldn’t quite make out. After a tense, silent minute, she turned back to me, her eyes glinting with something between fear and pity, then shuffled out without another word, leaving the door chiming softly behind her.



I shot a glare at Steve. "You could've done something, Steve!" I snapped. 



Steve raised an eyebrow, still half-smiling. “Oh, she does this to everyone. Yesterday, she told Kenny he was the Antichrist and tried to baptize him with holy water in a Coke bottle in the middle of the snack aisle.”



Kenny, overhearing from his spot at the counter, snorted. “Honestly, kinda refreshing. Usually, people just tell me to get a real job.”



“That’s not the point, Steve! That woman’s clearly disturbed, and you’re all acting like it’s just another Tuesday.”



Steve shrugged, glancing at Kenny with a smirk. “Well, in Alswell, maybe it is. Not the first time someone’s gone off the rails around here.”



I don’t know what’s happening, but I feel like I’m losing my grip on reality here. It’s like every time I try to focus, something weird happens. The shadows in the corners of the room seem to shift, and the walls feel like they’re closing in. I can’t shake this feeling that Alswell is coming for me, and that old woman was just the beginning.



So, I rushed home after my shift, fingers flying across the keyboard, trying to type this out for Reddit before anything else went wrong. My dad’s old iPad is stuttering, and honestly, I’m just praying it doesn’t crash. I keep glancing at the door, half-expecting some creepy shadow or another old person to wander in, mumbling about how Alswell will never let me go. It’s ridiculous, right? But the more I think about it, the more I wonder if this place is really as normal as it seems, or if I’m just one more incident away from losing my mind.



I better send this as is before something else happens. I can hear something—maybe it’s just my imagination—but I can almost make out that song playing from somewhere inside my house. And I think I hear someone going through my kitchen drawers. I swear, if I die, I’m haunting Steve. \*Pray for me, guys. And if you don’t hear from me… well, maybe Alswell finally decided to keep me."\*
