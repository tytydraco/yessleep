All things considered; I was happy within my imaginary life.

It wasn’t perfect, but Emma and Harper were more than I could have ever asked for. More than I deserved, in fact, given my complete refusal to try and cure the self-imposed loneliness I suffered from in the real world. Despite that, or perhaps because of it, I was destined to eventually wake up.

The last thing I could recall was Emma and me celebrating Harper’s eleventh birthday, even though I had only been comatose for three years. In my experience, a coma is really just a protracted dream. Because of that, time is a suggestion, not a rule.

She blew out the candles, smoke rising over twinned green eyes behind a pair of round glasses with golden frames.

Then, I blinked.

The various noises of the party seemed to blend together into a writhing mass of sound, twisting and distorting until it was eventually refined into a high-pitched ringing.

Silence: as quickly as it came, the ringing was gone.

My eyelids reopened to a quiet hospital room in the middle of the night. The transition was nauseatingly instantaneous. I went from believing I was thirty-nine with a wife and a kid back to being alone in my late twenties, exactly as I was before the stroke.

A few dozen panic attacks later, I started to get a handle on the situation.

- - - - -

Now, I recognize this is not the note these types of online anecdotes normally start on. The ones I've read ease you in gradually. They savor a few morsels of the uncanny foreplay before the main event. An intriguing break in reality here, a whispered unraveling of existence there. It's an exercise in building tension, letting the suspense bubble and fester like fresh roadkill on boiling asphalt, all the while dropping a few not-so-subtle hints about what’s *really* happening.

Then, the author experiences a moment of clarity, followed by the climatic epiphany. A revelation as existentially terrifying as it is painfully cliché. 

*“Oh my god, none of that was real. Ever since the accident, my life has been a lie. I’ve been in a coma since \[****insert time and date of brain injury here****\].”*

It’s an overworked twist, stale as decade-old croutons. That doesn’t mean the concept that underlies the twist is fictional, though. I can tell you it’s not.

From December 2012 until early 2015, I was locked within a coma. For three years, my lifeless body withered and atrophied in a hospital bed until I was nothing more than a human-shaped puddle of loose skin and eggshell bones, waiting for a true, earnest end that would never come.

You see, despite being comatose, I wasn’t one-hundred percent dormant. I was awake and asleep, dead but restless. Some part of my brain remained active, and that coalition of insomnia-ridden neurons found themselves starved for nourishing stimuli while every other cell slept.

Emma and Harper were born from that bundle of restless neurons. They have been and always will be a fabrication. A pleasant lie manufactured out of necessity: something to occupy my fractured mind until I either recovered or died.

For reasons that I'll never understand, I recovered.

That recovery was some sweet hell, though. Apparently, the human body wasn’t designed to rebound from one-thousand-ish days of dormancy. Without the detoxifying effects of physical motion, my tissue had become stagnant and polluted while remaining technically alive. I woke up as a corpse-in-waiting: malnourished, skeletal, and every inch of my body hurt.

Those coma-days were a gentle sort of rot.

Ten years later, my gut doesn’t work too well, and my muscles can’t really grow, but I’m up and walking around. I suppose I’m more alive than I was lying in that hospital bed, even if I don’t *feel* more alive. That’s the great irony of it all, I guess. I haven’t felt honestly alive since I lost Emma and Harper all those years ago.

Because of that, the waking world has become my bad dream. An incomprehensible mess ideas and images that could easily serve as the hallucinatory backbone of a memorable nightmare.

*Tiny, empty black holes. Book deals and TedTalks. Unidentifiable, flayed bodies being dragged into an attic. The smell of lavender mixed with sulfur. Tattoos that pulse and breathe. The Angel Eye Killer. My brother's death.*

In real time, I thought all these strange things were separate from each other. Unrelated and disarticulated. Recently, however, I've found myself coming to terms with a different notion.

I can trace everything back to my coma; somehow, it all interconnects.

So, as much as I’d prefer to detail the beautiful, illusory life that bloomed behind my lifeless eyes, it isn’t the story I *need* to tell. Unlike other accounts of this phenomenon, my realization that it was all imaginary isn’t the narrative endpoint. In fact, it was only the first domino to fall in the long sequence of events that led to this hotel room.

Some of what I describe is going to sound unbelievable. Borderline psychotic, actually. If you find yourself feeling skeptical as you read, I want you to know that I have two very special people with me as I type this, patiently watching the letters blink into existence over my shoulders.

And they are my proof.

I’m not sure they understand what the words mean. I think they can read, but I don’t know definitively. Right now, I see two pairs of vacant eyes tracking the cursor’s movements through the reflection of my laptop screen.

That said, they aren’t reacting to this sentence.

I just paused for a minute. Gave them space to provide a rebuttal. Allowed them the opportunity to inform me they are capable of reading. Nothing. Honestly, if I couldn’t see them in the reflection, I wouldn’t even be sure they were still here. When I’m typing, the room is deafeningly silent, excluding the soft tapping of the keys.

If I stop typing, however, they become agitated. It’s not immediately life-threatening, but it escalates quickly. Their bodies vibrate and rumble like ancient radiators. Guttural, inhuman noises emanate from deep inside their chests. They bite the inside of their cheeks until the mucosa breaks and they pant like dying dogs. Sweat drips, pupils dilate, madness swells. Before they erupt, I type, and slowly, they’ll settle back to their original position standing over me. Watching words appear on-screen calms their godforsaken minds.

Right now, if I really focus, I can detect the faint odor of the dried blood caked on their hands and the fragments of viscera jammed under their fingernails. It’s both metallic and sickly organic, like a handful of moldy quarters.

Dr. Rendu should hopefully arrive soon with the sedatives.

In the meantime, best to keep typing, I suppose.

***February, 2015 (The month I woke up from my coma)***

No one could tell me why I had the stroke. Nor could anyone explain what exactly had caused me to awaken from the resulting coma three years later. The best my doctors could come up with was *“well, we’ve read about this kind of thing happening*”, as if *that* was supposed to make me feel better about God flicking me off and on like a lamp.

What followed was six months and eight days of grueling rehabilitation. Not just physically grueling, either. The experience was mentally excruciating as well. Every goddamned day, *at least* one person would inquire about my family.

*“Are they thrilled to have you back? Who should I expect to be visiting, and when are they planning on coming by? Is there anyone I can call on your behalf?”*

A merciless barrage of salt shards aimed at the fucking wound.

Both my parents died when I was young. Dave, my brother, reluctantly adopted me after that (he’s twelve years older than I am, twenty-three when they passed). No friends since I was in high school. I had a wife once. A tangible one, unlike Emma. The marriage didn’t last, and that was mostly my fault; it crumbled under the weight of my pathologic introversion. I’ve always been so comfortable in my own head and because of that, I’ve rarely felt compelled to pursue or maintain relationships. My brother’s the same way. In retrospect, it makes sense that we never developed much of a rapport.

So, when these well-meaning nurses asked about my family, the venom-laced answers I offered back seemed to come as a shock.

*“Well, let’s see. My brother feels lukewarm about my resurrection. He’ll be visiting a maximum of one hour a week, but knowing Dave, it’ll most likely be less. I have no one else. That said, my brain made up a family during my coma, and being away from them is killing me. If you really want to help, send me back there. Happen to have any military-grade ketamine on you? I won’t tattle. Shouldn’t be able to tattle if you give me enough.”*

That last part usually put an end to any casual inquiries.

Sometimes, I felt bad about being so ornery. There’s a pathetic irony to spitting in the face of people taking care of you, lashing out because the world feels lonely and unfair.

Other times, though, when they caught me in a particularly dark mood, I wouldn’t feel guilty. If anything, it kind of felt good to create discomfort. It was a way for them to shoulder some of my pain; I just wasn’t giving them the option to refuse to help. Their participation in my childish catharsis was involuntary, and I guess that was the point. A meager scrap of control was better than none.

I won’t sugarcoat it: I was a real bastard back then. Probably was before the coma, too.

The worst was yet to come, though.

What I did to Dave was unforgivable.

***March, 2015***

As strange as it may sound, if you compare my life before the stroke to my life after the coma, I actually *gained* more than I lost, but that’s only because I had barely anything to lose in the first place. I mean, really the only valuable thing I had before my brain short-circuited was my career, and that didn’t go anywhere. Thankfully, the medical examiner’s office wasn’t exactly overflowing with applications to fill my position as the county coroner’s assistant in my absence.

But the proverbial cherry-on-top? Meeting Dr. Rendu. That man has been everything to me this last decade: a neurologist, friend, confidant, and literary agent, all wrapped into one bizarre package.

He strolled into my hospital room one morning and immediately had my undivided attention. His entire aesthetic was just so odd.

White lab coat, the pockets brimming with an assortment of reflex hammers and expensive-looking pens, rattling and clanging with each step. Both hands littered with tattoos, letters or symbols on every finger. I couldn’t approximate the doctor’s age to save my life. His face seemed juvenile and geriatric simultaneously: smooth skin and an angular jawline contrasting with crow’s feet and a deadened look in his eyes. If he told me he was twenty-five, I would have believed him, same as if he told me he was seventy-five.

The peculiar appearance may have piqued my curiosity, but his aura kept me captivated.

There was something about him that was unlike anyone I’d ever met before that moment. He was intense, yet soft-spoken and reserved. Clever and opinionated without coming off judgmental. The man was a whirlwind of elegant contradictions, through and through, and that quality felt magnetic.

Honestly, I think he reminded me of my dad, another enigmatic character made only more mysterious by his death and subsequent disappearance from my life. I was in a desperate need of a father figure during that time and Dr. Rendu did a damn good job filling the role.

He was only supposed to be my neurologist for a week or so, but he pulled some strings so that he could stay on my case indefinitely. I didn’t ask him to do that, but I was immediately grateful that he did. We seemed to be operating on the same, unspoken wavelength. The man just knew what I needed and was kind enough to oblige.

When I finally opened up to him about Emma and Harper, I was afraid that he would belittle my loss. Instead, he implicitly understood the importance of what I was telling him, interrupting his daily physical exam of my recovering nervous system to sit and listen intently.

I didn’t give him a quick, curated version, either.

I detailed Emma and I’s first date at a local aquarium, our honeymoon in Iceland, her struggles with depression, the adoption of our black labrador retriever *“Boo Radley*”, moving from the city to the countryside once we found out she was pregnant with Harper, our daughter’s birth and nearly fatal case of post-birth meningitis, her terrible twos, the rollercoaster that was toilet training, our first vacation as a family to The Grand Canyon, Harper’s fascination with reality ghost hunting shows as a pre-teen, all the way to my daughter blowing out the candles on her eleventh birthday cake.

When I was done, I cried on his shoulder.

His response was perfect, too. Or, rather, his lack of a response. He didn’t really say anything at all, not initially. Dr. Rendu patted me warmly between my shoulder blades without uttering a word. People don’t always realize that expressions like *“It’s all going to be OK”* can feel minimizing. To someone who's hurting, it may sound like you’re actually saying *“hurry up and be OK because your pain is making me uncomfortable”* in a way that’s considered socially acceptable.

In the weeks since the coma abated, I was slowly coming to grips with the idea that Emma and Harper might as well have been an elaborate doodle of a wife and a daughter holding hands in the margins of a marble bound notebook: both being equally as real when push came to shove.

Somehow, I imagined what I was experiencing probably felt worse than just becoming a widower. Widows actually *had* a bona fide, flesh and blood spouse at some point. But for me, that wasn’t true. You can’t have something that never existed in the first place. No bodies to bury meant no gravestones to visit. No in-laws to lean on meant there was no one to mourn with. Emma and Harper were simply a mischievous spritz of neurotransmitters dancing between the cracks and crevices of my broken brain, nothing more.

How *the fuck* would that ever be “*OK”*?

As my sobs fizzled out, Dr. Rendu finally spoke. I’ll never forget what he said, because it made me feel so much less insane.

*“Your experience was not so different from any relationship in the real world, Bryan. Take me and my wife Linda, for example. There's the person she was, and there's the person I believed her to be in my head: similar people, sure, but not quite the same. To make things more complex, there’s the person I believed myself to be, and the person I actually was. Again, similar, but not the same by any measure. Not to make your head spin, but we all live in a state of flux, too. Who we believe ourselves to be and who we actually are is a moving target: it’s all constantly shifting.”*

I remember him sitting back in the creaky plastic hospital chair and smiling at me. The smile was weak and bittersweet, an expression that betrayed understanding and camaraderie rather than happiness.

“*So, in my example, which versions of me and Linda were truly ‘real’? Is the concept really that binary, too, or is it misleading to think of ‘real’ and ‘not real’ as the only possible options? Could it be more of a spectrum? Can something, or someone, be only partially real?”*

He chuckled and leaned back, placing a tattooed hand over his eyes, fingers gently massaging his temple.

*“I’m getting carried away. These are the times when I miss Linda the most, I think. She wasn’t afraid to let me know when to shut my trap. What I’m trying to say is, in my humble opinion, people are what you believe they are, who you perceive them as - and that perception lives in your head, just like Emma and Harper do. Remember, perception and belief are powerful; they give humanity a taste of godhood. So, I think they’re more real than you’re giving them credit for. Moreover, they’re less distant than you may think.”*

I reciprocated his sundered smile, and then we briefly lingered in a comfortable silence.

At first, I was hesitant to ask what happened to his wife. But, as he stood up, readying himself to leave and attend to other patients, I forced the question out of my throat. It felt like the least I could do.

Dr. Rendu faltered. His body froze mid-motion, backside half bent over the chair, hands still anchored to the armrests. I watched his two pale blue eyes swing side to side in their sockets, fiercely reconciling some internal decision.

Slowly, he lowered himself back into the chair.

Then a question lurched from his vocal cords, each slurred syllable drenched with palpable grief, every letter fighting to surface against the pull of a bottomless melancholy like a mammoth thrashing to stay afloat in a tar pit.

*“Have you ever heard of The Angel Eye Killer?”*

I shook my head no.

***November 11th, 2012 (One month before my stroke)***

Dr. Rendu arrived home from the hospital a little after seven. From the driveway, he was surprised to find his house completely dark. Linda ought to have been back from the gallery hours ago, he contemplated, removing his keys from the ignition of the sedan. The scene certainly perplexed him. He had been using their only car, and he couldn’t recall his wife having any scheduled obligations outside the house that evening.

Confusion aside, there wasn’t an immediate cause for alarm: no broken windows, no concerning noises, and he found the front door locked from the inside. That all changed when he stepped into the home’s foyer and heard muffled, feminine screams radiating through the floorboards directly below his feet.

In his account of events made at the police station later that night, Dr. Rendu details becoming trapped in a state of *“crippling executive dysfunction”* upon hearing his wife’s duress, which is an overly clinical way to describe being paralyzed by fear.

*“It was as if her wails had begun occupying physical space within my head. The sickening noise seemed to expand like hot vapor. I couldn’t think. There wasn’t enough room left inside my skull for thought. The sounds of her agony had colonized every single molecule of available space. At that moment, I don’t believe I was capable of rationality.”* (10:37 PM, response to the question “***why didn’t you call 9-1-1 when you got home?***”)

He couldn’t tell detectives how long he remained motionless in the foyer. Dr. Rendu estimated it was at least a minute. Eventually, he located some courage, sprinting through the hallway and down the cellar stairs.

He vividly recalled leaving the front door ajar.

The exact sequence of events for the half-hour that followed remains unclear to this day. In essence, he discovered his wife, Linda \[*maiden name redacted*\], strung upside down by her ankles. Linda’s death would bring AEK’s (*The Angel Eye Killer*) body count to seven. Per his M.O., it had been exactly one-hundred and eleven days since he last claimed a life.

*“She was facing me when I first saw her. There was a pool of blood below where he hung her up. The blood was mostly coming from the gashes on her wrists, but some of it was dripping off her forehead. It appeared as if she was staring at me. When I got closer, I realized that wasn’t the case. Her eyes had changed color. They used to be green. The prosthetics he inserted were blue, and its proportions were all wrong. The iris was unnaturally large. It took up most of the eye, with a tiny black pupil at the center and a sliver of white along the perimeter. Her face was purple and bloated. She wasn’t moving, and her screams had turned to whimpers. I become fixated on locating her eyelids, which had been excised. I couldn’t find them anywhere. Sifted through the blood and made a real mess of things. Then, I started screaming.”* (11:14 PM, response to the question “***how did you find her***?”)

Although AEK wasn’t consistent in terms of a stereotyped victim, he seemed to have some clear boundaries. For one, he never targeted children. His youngest victim was twenty-three. He also never murdered more than one person at a time. Additionally, the cause of death between cases was identical: fatal hemorrhage from two slit wrists while hung upside down. Before he’d inflict those lacerations, however, he’d remove the victim’s eyes. The prosthetic replacements were custom made. Hollow glass balls that had a similar thickness and temperament to Christmas ornaments.

None of the removed eyes have ever been recovered.

Something to note: AEK’s moniker is a little misleading. The media gave him that nickname because the victims were always found in the air, floating like angels, not because the design of the prosthetics held any known religious significance.

*“I heard my next-door neighbor entering the house upstairs before I realized that Linda and I weren’t alone in the cellar. Kneeling in her blood, sobbing, he snuck up behind me and placed his hand on my shoulder. His breathing became harsh and labored, like he was forcing himself to hyperventilate. I didn’t have the bravery to turn around and face him. Didn’t Phil \[Dr. Rendu’s neighbor\] see him?”* (11:49 PM, response to the question “***did you get a good look at the man?***”)

Unfortunately, AEK was in the process of crawling out of a window when the neighbor entered the cellar, with Dr. Rendu curled into the fetal position below his wife.

Phil could only recount three details: AEK was a man, he had a small tattoo on the sole of his left foot, and he appeared to have been completely naked. Bloody footprints led from Dr. Rendu’s lawn into the woods. Despite that, the police did not apprehend AEK that night.

Then, AEK vanished. One-hundred and eleven days passed without an additional victim. The police assumed he had gone into hiding due to being seen. Back then, Phil was the only person who ever caught a glimpse of AEK in the act.

That’s since changed.

When the killer abruptly resumed his work in the Fall of 2015, he had modified his M.O. to include the laboriously flaying his victim’s skin, in addition to removing the eyes and replacing them with custom prosthetics.

You might be wondering how I’m able to regurgitate all of this information offhand. Well, I sort of wrote the book on it. Dr. Rendu’s idea. He believed that, even if the venture didn’t turn a profit, it would still be a great method to help me cope with the truth.

When I was finally ready to be discharged from the hospital, Dave kindly offered to take me in. A temporary measure while I was getting back on my feet.

Two months later, I’d catch my brother dragging the second of two eyeless, mutilated bodies up the attic stairs.

He pleaded his innocence. Begged me to believe him.

I didn’t.

Two days later, he was killed in a group holding cell by the brother of AEK’s second victim, who was being held for a DUI at the same time. Caved his head in against the concrete floor like a sparrow’s egg.

One short year after that, my hybrid true-crime/memoir would hit number three on the NY Time’s Best Sellers list. The world had become downright obsessed with AEK, and I shamelessly capitalized on the fad.

I was his brother, after all. My story was the closest thing his ravenous fans had to the cryptic butcher himself.

What could be better?

\- - - - -

Just spotted Dr. Rendu pulling into the hotel parking lot from the window. I hope he brought some heavy-duty tranquilizers. It’s going to take something potent to sedate Emma and Harper. Watching me type keeps them docile - pacifies them so they don't tear me to pieces. I’d rather not continue monologuing indefinitely, though, which is where the chemical restraints come into play.

That said, I want to make something clear: I didn’t need to create this post. I could have just transcribed this all into Microsoft Word. It would have the same placating effect on them. But I’m starting to harbor some doubts about my de facto mentor, Dr. Rendu. In light of those doubts, the creation of a public record feels like a timely thing to do.

Dr. Rendu told me he has this all under control over the phone. He endorsed that there’s an enormous sum of money to be made of the situation as well. Most importantly, he believes they can be refined. Molded into something more human. All it would take is a little patience and a lot of practice.

Just heard a knock at the door.

In the time I have left, let’s just say my doubts are coming from something I can't seem to exorcise from memory. A fact that I left out of my book at Dr. Rendu’s behest. It’s nagged at me before, but it’s much more inflamed now.

Dave didn’t have a single tattoo on his body, let alone one on the sole of his foot.

My brother couldn’t have been The Angel Eye Killer.
