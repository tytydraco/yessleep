I've always had a fascination with earth based belief systems. As an atheist, they always seemed to make the most sense: making sense of the world by tracking celestial cycles, changing seasons and the harvest. However,
the skeptic in me knows it was simply a way for early humanity to make sense of a world they didn't quite understand. 
They built mythological stories to help shape a world of fantastic beings that both punish and reward. My favorite time of year is the descent into darkness, the thinning of the veil or . colloquially: spooky season.

I'm an old goth. I admit it, I got every damn stereotype and have for 30 years. Tarot cards? Yeah, I have like 20 decks. I use them as a party trick in amateur mentalism using an old game from Italy that morphed into a game used to "predict" your future. It's just good fun and I always tell people "this is just fun, nothing can actually tell the future" sometimes, the cards are all consistent: everyone gets similar pulls. Sometimes, they erratic and weird, but I always have an idea of what to say, like a whisper I hear. I mean, everyone has their own narrative running through their head, right? Just me? Okay ....

This year, tho, the whispers got louder. Every August I start to hear it.  It's faint, hovering in the background like a low hum. Sometimes, the hum is lovely and cozy, sometimes I can barely make it out. This year, however, it started to get loud. So loud I could almost make out words. 

That's never happened before. It's never been something like that, like a word or phrase. This year, however, I just keep hearing a what I feel is a warning. 

I got a gig reading tarot at a Halloween party and I was stoked to play a character I've always wanted to. I created a Victorian spiritualist, someone who communes with the dead. Normally, I'm ecstatic to do these gigs, but I found it hard to muster up the excitement of the season. Additionally,Each guest that arrived for a fun reading was getting some weird cards. The tower, 9 of swords, the moon, the devil, all cards that represent some kind of abrupt change, nightmares, faint whispers of dread. 

The whispers got louder. Run.  Hide. Something is wrong. Each reading was getting more unhinged despite my through shuffling. Whispers were getting louder. 

Halloween night, and suddenly, I found myself hearing things more clear. "Something is off" "check it again" "it's not real.."

 

Okay, I had enough. I'm going to answer 

"What's not real?" I mumbled low enough so no one could hear me and think I was...well, you know....

"It's about time" 

"What?" 

"I've been hanging out for years, but you've been ignoring me. Look, I don't have much time, you need to prepare. The solstice... you'll know the sign. When it happens, you'll know. " 

And suddenly, the buzz was quiet. Prepare for what? WTF? The exchange felt weird to a skeptic like me, so I chalked it up to my very very overactive imagination. 

After that I started feeling like I was floating through life, going through motions and just existing. I'm usually all kinds of hyped for the holidays, loving the very spooky aspect of it. No one knows that it's steeped in stories of ghosts and cryptids creeping around, they call it "a Christmas carol" or "krampus" . This year I felt disconnected and generally off. 

I didn't even remember that exchange when I saw it. I was scrolling through social media desperate for a dopamine hit and I saw it. A black cat garning the attention of millions at Stonehenge. That cat knew. That cat was worshipped. It was hilarious! Cats, man..they always know how to run the world. 

It was at that moment my black cat jumped onto my lap. As I was petting her, she looked at me purring loudly. 

Holy shit. 

Tremendous change. Abrupt. Something is big..a shift. 

And I heard the whisper again. 

"You paid attention." 

"I think?" 

I looked at my cat and pet her and she gently placed her paw on me and pushed my hand down. Ahh the universal sign of "don't pet me" 

"Just be ready, it's coming" she said. 

My cat...said....what? I've always loved cats, they're the best creatures. I've always wanted them to talk back or tell me what's up. Now that I know, I am frightened. Something is coming and it's coming soon.
