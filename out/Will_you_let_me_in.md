During the fall time Mel would go to his family's vacation house out by the lake. It was a peaceful community full of retired inhabitants. He arrived just as the sun began to rise over the tree line having made the late-night drive to avoid traffic. Turning the car into the driveway he parked the car, turning the engine.    
   
   
Mel opened the car door, taking a moment to step out and stretch. Going to the back of the car he opened the boot, beginning the process of gathering his bags then taking them inside. A note was on the counter left by his parents. Walking over, he glanced at the note briefly.    
   
   
It stated that the pantry and fridge had been restocked. If the power were to go out to use the generator in the basement. What confused Mel was a scribble at the bottom left by his sibling leaving a warning.   
   
   
Whatever IT says and no matter what IT does DO NOT let it in.   
   
   
Was this some sort of joke since it was close to Halloween?    
   
   
 It was normal for them to play jokes on each other around this time of year. For now, he shrugged and began to unpack. By the time he was finished Mel was ready for lunch, so he made himself a meal.   
   
   
While sitting there though...out of the corner of his eyes he could have sworn that he saw something move outside.   
   
   
Was it an animal?    
   
   
The neighbors do have pets, and it could have also been some of the local wildlife as well. Since deer have been seen in the area according to his dad. Who normally takes pictures of them for the local travel magazine in town.   
   
   
Though it certainly did not seem animal shaped.   
   
   
Finishing his lunch and cleaning up. Mel took his dishes to the kitchen, rinsing them off before putting them into the dishwasher to be washed later.   
   
   
   
Placing a hand over his mouth he yawned looking over at the grandfather clock in the kitchen. Should he go for a walk or lay down for a nap? With whatever was looming outside Mel figured it would be best to stay inside.   
   
   
On his way through the house, he checked the windows, pulling the curtains closed, checking the doors, and closing the sliding door shades.   
   
   
Stepping back from the sliding glass door Mel could have sworn that there was a small tapping against the glass. He decided it was just the shades moving from being closed and made his way to the bedroom.    
   
   
   
Before long he was fast asleep. After time had gone by, and the sun had gone down a considerable amount, Mel opened his eyes.    
   
   
   
Getting up from his bed he reached over clicking on the lamp that was on the bedside table. He took a moment to rub the sleep from his eyes before he stood up. Entering the living room, the automatic plug-in lights lit his way, but he stopped halfway when they noticed a silhouette standing outside the sliding glass door.   
   
   
   
 Hands and a face pressed to the glass staring inside.    
   
   
Mel was thankful he had closed the blinds. Taking a deep breath, he took a step back slowly only to see the head of the figure jerk in his direction.   
   
   
"I can hear you in there. Won't you let me in?"    
   
   
   
 He kept quiet, not answering.   
   
   
   
"I know you're in there! Why won't you speak to me?!"    
   
   
   
Mel heard scratching on glass as if it were trying to make its way inside.   
   
   
   
Should he call the police? What exactly would they even do?   
   
   
IT banged on the sliding glass door as the whole thing began to rattle, and shake.   
   
   
"LET me in...”   
   
   
“Let ME...in”   
   
   
“LET ME IN!”   
   
   
Retreating to the master bedroom he crawled under the bed, Mel pulled out his cellphone tapping 911 onto the screen.    
   
   
   
Waiting for someone to pick up the sound of glass shattering made him jump, losing his grip on his phone dropping it. Mel could only watch as it bounced and slid out from under the bed. Going to reach for it he quickly retracted his hand upon hearing footsteps as if someone were dragging their feet.    
   
   
"Hello 911, what is your emergency?" A man's voice spoke from Mel's discarded phone that was a bit out of reach.    
   
   
   
The man repeated himself, and sighed clearly annoyed mumbling about prank callers and how this happens every year.   
   
   
   
His heart felt as if it jumped into his throat making it hard to swallow as those footsteps were now in the master bedroom with him.   
   
   
   
Staying still Mel heard the creak of the bed as if someone or something was crawling across it. Holding his breath, wishing it would just go away. Slowly the side of the comforter began to rise.   
   
   
   
It lowered its long black hair first then its face came into view. Its features contorted with a matching twisted, and upturned smile.   
   
   
“Why wouldn’t you let me in?” it hissed angrily    
   
   
Mel screamed, fainting from shock. He did not know how long he had been out and awoke when his sister Wynn called out for him. Opening his eyes from his place under the bed he could see that it was now daylight. Had IT left him alone?   
   
   
Crawling out from under the bed he went to the living room where his sister was cleaning up the shards that were scattered on the carpet from the broken sliding glass door. Wynn looked at him over her shoulder as he approached.   
   
   
“There you are Mel! I tried calling your cellphone, but you did not pick up”    
   
   
“Sorry sis” Mel apologized “Say um...Wynn, about that warning you left with the note on the counter” he inquired.   
   
   
Wynn was silent for a moment before frowning.   
   
   
“Oh that? When I was here a few weeks ago I thought...I saw” she shook her head before asking, “What happened to the door?”   
   
   
He wanted to tell her what she had warned him about was real. Knowing Wynn, she would just brush it off saying Mel was just trying to prank her since they did every Halloween, but not this year. Whatever was outside, desperately wanting in and had gotten in, left Mel alive.   
   
   
Next time he may not be so lucky.
