1: when you want to watch tv you gotta tell my dad first, he doesn’t like it when people use the tv without his permission 

2: if he declines your request don’t talk to him anymore, he doesn’t like it when you ask twice

3: when he does let you use it, you will only have 10 channels to choose from and whatever you do, don’t go to the first channel, if you do it’ll escape

4: in the case that the entity that we call the static does escape, you will only have 5 minutes to say goodbye to your family, there is no escaping

5: at 5:18pm the screen will turn red and the second it does you better look away, if you do not look away fast enough, no one will ever hear from you ever you again

6: If you see yourself in the screen looking at you just ignore it, it will try anything to get your attention

7: if you hear you’re mom outside the door don’t look away from the screen, keep on looking at it until the voice stops, I’ll tell you when your mom comes

8: you will need to stop watching tv at exactly 6:34pm, it’s dinner time

9: failure to arrive at dinner, I have a knife under the tv, kill yourself, it’ll be faster and more painless than what my mom has in store for you

10: you will need to watch sports with dad after dinner, doesn’t matter what sport but he will propose a bet

11: if you decline the bet, you better keep you’re eyes on the screen until the game is over, you don’t want to see what my dad is doing

12: if you dart your eyes off the screen my dad will notice and kill you

13: if you do bet with him, you better hope you bet on the right team

14: if you lose, my dad will kill you

15: if you’re team wins hooray!! He will no longer be a threat to you, treat him as you would with any other human being

16: mom will then watch her shows after my dad, you will need to stay and watch it tv with her

17: mom will put her favorite show, if she senses you are bored, she will not like that

18: if you at any point need to use the bathroom, don’t take more than 2 minutes

19: if you feel someone breathing down you’re neck 30 minutes into the show, just ignore it, it’s just checking in on you

20: before you know it, you will have finished 3 episodes, you will have a 5 minute break to do anything else

21: When it’s time to watch the 4th and final episode of the day, mom will make you watch every part of it

22: failure to watch the entire episode will result in the tv turning to channel 1 and you disappearing

23: if you watch the entire episode thank my mom for the good time and turn the tv off

24: failure to turn off the tv 5 seconds after the episode ended will result in the tv not turning off, you then will see my mom morph into the static, you then are screwed

25: if everything goes smoothly you then are safe, the entity’s are all harmless now

Hope you enjoy using our tv!
