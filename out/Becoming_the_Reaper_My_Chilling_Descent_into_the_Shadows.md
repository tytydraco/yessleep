Hey, fellow Redditors! Buckle up because I'm about to take you on an extraordinary journey – one that I never thought would become my reality. Yes, you read it correctly – I've become a Grim Reaper. Now, before you dismiss this as just another internet tale, let me assure you, this is my story.

It all began on a night draped in mist and shadows. (The dark arts and necromancy had become a hobby of mine late, I have read everything I can get my hands on and have tried to learn everything I can from whoever I can, most recently I had learned to “dream walk” which sounds as surreal as it feels) I found myself in an otherworldly realm, a place that seemed to exist between the echoes of life and the whispers of the afterlife. A mysterious figure, shrouded in darkness, approached me. As I hesitated, trying to discern if I was caught in a dream or a sophisticated virtual reality prank, the enigmatic being handed me a scythe.

"You've been chosen, you want to take life and death and manipulate it like it is some sort of play thing ! Well we have been watching you, granted you appear to be skilled, but we think we can help with that, you will exist outside of time, space and everything there is, you will pass through everything as if it is a veil." it whispered, I had so many questions buzzing through my head, who was “we” how long had he been around, was this a curse or a gift ? and in that moment, a profound connection to the cosmos surged through me. My purpose became clear – I was now a harbinger of the afterlife.

In the initial days, the weight of responsibility was overwhelming. I roamed the ethereal landscapes, navigating through planes of existence, collecting the departed souls. My scythe, once an ordinary tool, now glowed with an eerie light as I guided souls to the next phase of existence. It was daunting, but strangely, it felt like I had found my place in the grand tapestry of existence.

As days turned into nights, I honed my skills. I learned to sense the ebb and flow of life, distinguishing between the vibrant energy of the living and the lingering essence of those whose time had come. My attire transformed into the iconic cloak and hood – the unmistakable uniform of a Grim Reaper.

Reddit, you won't believe the conversations I've had with souls on their journey. There's a serene beauty in guiding them towards the unknown. I've become a witness to the stories that unfold beyond mortal life.

Of course, challenges abound. Some souls resist, clinging to the remnants of the world they knew. Others find solace in my presence, as if meeting an old friend after a long and arduous journey. It's a delicate balance, guiding without imposing, comforting without deceiving.

I know this all sounds surreal, and trust me, I've questioned my sanity more than once. But each time I see the gratitude in the eyes of those I guide, it reaffirms that this is my path now.

So here I am, a Redditor turned Grim Reaper, typing away from the edge of existence (my new office has surprisingly good wifi !). If you notice shadows lingering at the periphery of your vision or feel an otherworldly presence during your darkest moments, I might be nearby and I may be coming for you next…

Ask me anything about this bizarre journey, and I'll do my best to share the insights from this newfound existence. After all, who would've thought that a casual stroll in the misty realms would lead to this extraordinary afterlife career? Life – and death – is full of surprises. And here I am, embracing the shadows, guiding souls across the threshold into the great unknown.
