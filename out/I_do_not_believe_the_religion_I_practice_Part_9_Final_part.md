We had shredded the book of Scripture. Torn it asunder and discarded its literary viscera upon each inch of my father's home. Following this, we dragged Mr. McGovern to my bed, and removing the bloodied rags from he and my father, burnt them in the stove.  Myself and Samantha, panting at our herculean efforts, gazed upon their blue, nakedness for but a moment.

"Help me to move it closer." She turned, indicating the bookshelf.

"Samantha" I paused "There must be another way"

She placed her shoulder against the bookshelf "Another way? My mother is dead, my father is too. Madness is what I inherit, it is not what I wish. I will not be the goblet from which these visions drips to the next generation." Her acne ridden face looked resolute, committed to the plan she had designed. Facing such a facade, I pushed my weight against the bookshelf, so that it moved closer to the door.

Standing back, and admiring what part of the plan had thus been executed. I was taken aback when Samantha threw her arms around my neck. "It will be alright" Her frame rose and fell gently, alluding to the oncoming of tears "Say it will be so"

"It will be so" I answered, uncertain as to the quality of my promise.

She tore herself away from me, and with her hands still pressed onto my shoulders she asked through sniffles "Will there be enough?"

"Of course. He keeps them beneath his bed" I took her arms from me, and knelt by my father's bedside, dragging out a crate that clattered with full bottles of wine.

She nodded. "And what of the Rosewater? Have you any left?"

I reached into my father's goatskin bag. Relieved to see a small amount remained.

She took my father's cup from the table, and thrusting it to my chest, I poured a healthy amount into it.

"I will drink it when they enter" She reaffirmed her plan aloud. "I will push the bookshelf the remainder of the way. I will toss the wine at the stove, and allow the embers to catch the soaked Scripture"

"Samantha, you need not do this. We may still yet run"

"I cannot run from what I have been born with" She placed the cup upon the table and began to busy herself, pouring my father's wine about the shack. "I will not run, and let this village continue this. They will die painfully, and this time it will be that pain that saves them"

I nodded, and hoisting my bag upon my back "You are brave"

She laughed "No. I am mad"

"I will wait by the hill for any who may escape, I will bring the Shear to them."

"Make certain you do. None may escape."

"I will leave now sister, sharpen the Shear. Prepare for any who might"

She stood upright "So be it, brother"

I cast my arms around her, embracing her. I felt odd. Such a motion was foreign to me, yet in its unfamiliarity, I gained a level of confidence. "Go in peace"

"Likewise, brother"

I left the door open, and walking to my designated spot, I watched the slow gathering of people march toward the open door. The scene therein, inspired them, one and all to cram the small shack. Their shock attracting all that knew my father. None seemed to notice the door click behind them. I wondered if any of them had seen Samantha drink from a cup, before toppling the heavy bookshelf against said door. I wondered who was the first to scream when the fire ignited the splashing wine.

The flames grew high, and as the crying gasps of anguish and pain haltered, I stared out at the coast, at the water's continual ebb and flow. Wholly indifferent to the lies told at this place. To the pain suffered here. Those who may stumble upon this village, may blame it on the war. Historians might condemn the barbarism of their conflicting ancestors. None would know the truth. In this, I found strength.

Disrobing I knelt on the ground. Through teary eyes I brought the vial to my lips and drank the remainder of the rosewater therein. "In thine wisdom" I smiled, despite myself "In thine guidance. In our expectation of Holy deliverance" I rose the Shear aloft "I will anoint the newly Sheared".

I dragged the bronze blade downward, along my chest. Again and again I retraced the wound, edging deeper with each movement. As delirium began to near me, I stabbed deeper, drug harder. Pressing, digging, pulling.

When I found my arms too weak to continue I fell backward onto the dewy grass, and imagining how much my grotesquely demolished chest must have looked like the opening bloom of the roses I so wished to escape, I let a chuckled spurt of blood erupt from my mouth. I no longer believed, I was free. In death, I would be free of the madness, I would be the last Shearwielder. It would cease, all of it, with me.

My departing victory ushered me into an eternal darkness, yet, to my horror, at the brink of death, I heard, the gnashing of teeth, the perfume of the mad roses, and the whining of swine arise loudly from the wound on by chest. I had lost faith in my religion, I had lost faith. Yet I lost not the maddness of my fathers
