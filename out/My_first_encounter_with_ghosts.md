When i was a kid i moved to a new house,when i moved in the house I immediately knew it’s something weird in the house,sometime my house happened something i couldn't explain.

like sometime when i was trying to turn on the light,if i was inside the room,the light usually didn’t work,but everytime if i left the room to turn on the light in the hallway,it immediately could work again, or sometime the door of my room slapped so hard to close by itself, and it happened a lot ,it scared me and my parents,and the weird part is, it only happened to my room .

I was trying to convince myself:”it was just the wind,but it never seems a wind could be this strong inside the house,and it always happens immediately. I mean just a second “boom!!!”and the wind disappeared.and it happened more and more frequently.

One day my parents had to leave for some reason,and I was the only person to stay in the house.

I stayed in my room,and i got bored so i started looking around my room,then  i found the bible, and it was hidden inside the drawer,maybe it belongs  to the last person who was  living here,i got interested so i decided to read it, and when i was reading in my room,suddenly the light shutted down   but it also happened before,at that moment I thought it was the power outage.

But since I was a kid at that time , I didn't know how to fix it, so I decided to keep reading the bible by using the flashlight to wait until my parents came home.

because I was really interested in the bible. so i really focused,suddenly I heard a sound. I said it’s a sound but I think it didn't come through my ears but came straight to my brain. At first it was very low but it started getting louder and louder.

It was so loud that I couldn’t ignore it,I couldn’t tell what kind of noise it was but then I finally realized it was a laugh, a very high pitched laugh,since I was the only person in the house then where the sound came from?

The more I thought about it, the creepier I felt. so i decided to leave the room by acting calmly. Whatever the voice came from I didn't want to let it notice.

I was intensely shivering. I walked to the living room,sat on the sofa,and turned on the TV. I wanted to distract my attention by watching tv. but i was wondering what is the situation in my room now, so i took a glance to my room,and I saw it,there is a guy standing on the bed looking at me.When I said it’s the guy its not very accurate.more precisely it’s a man shape shadow standing there and watching me.I was so scared that I didn’t dare to move.My body is stiff.I couldn’t take my eyes off him.So we just stared at each other for a long time. and then it jumped down the bed and disappeared in the dark.and when i finally could move, I saw the time and it was just in the middle of the day. Usually my neighbor's kids like to play outside the house. but they didn’t play on that day.when my parents came home, I told all the details about what  happened today. but they insisted that it was all my imagination.Later,I learned that the demons showed up and interfered with the belief of the christians. I couldn’t help but to think that maybe on that day what I saw was not the ghost rather the demon wanted to disturb me.
