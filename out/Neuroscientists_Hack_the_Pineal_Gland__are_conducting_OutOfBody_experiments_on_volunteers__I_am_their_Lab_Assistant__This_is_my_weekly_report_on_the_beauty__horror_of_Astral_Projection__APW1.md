AP.W1: The "Eye of God" Frequency

I feel it's important to say that I never thought anyone involved with our experiments would or even could get hurt from our work, let alone killed.   I still find it hard to believe what I saw.  I fear that my two employers have become so fanatical in their ambitions that we are all in danger.  Yet, I dare not attempt to stop this madness.  For it is not love of our scientific breakthrough that compels me.  It’s my love for her.

I started working for Doctor Sahina and her husband, Doctor James, three months ago at Commerce Neurobiological Laboratories.  She is brilliant.  Radiant.  Queen of my dreams.  Driven by pain.  Constantly hurting in her upper back, she is determined to find a way to solve people’s suffering without being addicted to opioids.  That’s why I originally joined their team.  They were working on something I believed in.

No more addiction to pills.  No more reliance on outside fixes for your pain.  The Fiber-Optic Light Laser shoots microscopic light atoms that pass through flesh and bone, melding the light-sensing protein rhodopsin to key parts of opioid receptors in the brain.  By using light to activate the receptor pathways, the brain releases natural pain-relieving chemicals, eliminating the need for pharmaceuticals.  This is revolutionary.  I was all in.  

Doctor Sahina led our three person team as we first worked with mice that suffered from arthritis.  Improvement in their mobility and health was immediately observable after one session with the Laser.  Then it was a dog named Bella.  We paid the family well to keep Bella for a week.  The poor animal could hardly walk on her hind legs due to terrible arthritis.  After a few sessions with us, Bella could walk without pain.  It was amazing.  I couldn’t wait to see what the follow up weeks would reveal.  I hoped Bella would continue to self-produce the pain relieving stimuli when she ached, proving that our method is a viable solution to synthetic narcotics.  But Doctor James had other plans.

Our nightly experiments were altogether different in purpose.  Led by Doctor James, we focused on the Pineal Gland, also known as the “Eye of God” for our experiments.  New neurological connections formed within the Pineal gland, activated by the light atoms, stimulating dormant brain functions.  Bella was given sleeping agents nightly as we penetrated her brain without incision.  A simple blast of light for ten seconds is all.  Then we put a bowl of food in one of four rooms with all four doors closed.  Everytime Bella woke up, she would walk (without limping, thanks to our daytime experiments) and scratch the correct door with food behind it.  

Bella was having out-of-body experiences every time.  That was the only explanation for her knowing where the food was when she awoke. It’s as if her spiritual self found the food and when she returned to her body and stirred awake, she remembered where the food was.  Of course this was just a theory.  I found the study odd but interesting.  Lacking validity, I thought we would suspend the night games.  That’s when Doctor James brought in a human subject.

His name I won’t mention.  I dare not say it for I am riddled with guilt.  The poor man was elderly and polite.  That’s really all I knew.  He smiled at me as I gave him the sleeping sedative.  We targeted his Pineal Gland and let the man sleep for nearly two hours.  With great fascination, I watched his blood pressure and heart rate accelerate at times, as if he was experiencing something that caused changes in his biochemistry.  We were all eager to hear what the man had to say when he awoke.  It was startling to us all when he sat up screaming.

“Help me.  Oh God, please, help me, it’s coming.”

I tried to console the man, as did Doctor Sahina but he was hysterical.  “No, it saw me when I was out,” said the man, “It chased me back here.  You have to help me.”

Doctor James finally helped us restrain the man.  With the three of us holding him down, Doctor James tried to ascertain what he means by ‘out there’ and to describe what exactly chased him.

“Was like, like, a garden of colors,” the man spoke.  “Beautiful colors.  They floated and were alive.  I played with them not too far from here.”  He points toward the back wall.

“Then I saw it moving along the garden.  I thought it was a shadow so I looked up at those amazing stars and moving objects in the sky.  But there was nothing above to cast that ghastly, dark image closing in on me.”

At this point, I was thinking the poor man had a weird dream.  But it was at that moment, that I saw something in the reflection of his eyes.  It was black, like a shadow that moved with purpose.

The man screamed and pointed to the back wall.  Doctor James pressed against the man’s chest with his forearm as Doctor Sahina and I held his arms down.  

“It’s here!  It’s here!  Help me, I beg you,” the man screamed and squirmed beneath our grasps.  I turned to face the back wall and saw nothing.  Yet when I faced the man again, I saw the thing clearly in the reflections of his eyes.  

“There is something in the room with us,” I proclaimed.  “Look in his eyes.”

It happened so fast.  It’s still hard  to process.  The three of us saw the reflection of a tall, black, insect-like creature with multiple limbs, long eyes and a pointed snout come up behind us and pierce the poor man’s skull.  I saw that strange snout move above the man's eyes and stab him above his brow, where the Pineal gland is.  The three of us could not hold him down as he was viciously yanked off the bed with great force.  Without the mirrors of his eyes, I,nor the Doctors could no longer see the astral creature that held the man straight up in the air by his head as it drained him of life.  Doctor Sahina was the only one who grabbed the man’s ankles and tried to pull him down as I admittedly was too dumbfounded to move.  

The man’s flesh dried up in seconds and then his organs and muscles caved inward.  We could hear the long beep of the flatline as he was still hooked up to our equipment.  His body was suddenly released and Doctor Sahina, who had been yanking on him, pulled him down to the floor with a thud.  His face and body looked as if he was drained of life a century ago and we had just dug him up.  But we hadn’t dug him up.  The man was dead because of us.  I knew that our work was done and that I was probably going to be in a lot of trouble.  How wrong I was.

In the wake of what happened, Commerce Neorobiological Laboratories was shut down.  The mice were sent to other labs.  Bella was sent back home to her human family.  As for the poor dead man, I swear I do not know what had become of his body.  I was isolated for two months at home, telling no one about what happened as I waited to be questioned by police or someone about the matter.  Eventually, the only person I heard from was Doctor Sahina.  

Originally, we had hoped to acquire funding with our work in eliminating the need for pharmaceuticals.  We failed in that quest, according to Sahina.  I could tell how much that saddened her.  

However, we did hook one investor interested in our research with the Pineal gland and astral projection.  I found that hard to believe, given the fact that a man died.  That’s when Sahina told me not to feel too badly, as he was a convicted criminal that Doctor James somehow got from a halfway house.  And furthermore, she added that what happened to the man was a result of location and equipment that we used.   That’s all she was able to say on that matter.  She urged me to trust her and confided in me that there was still a chance that we can return to our original mission of ending opioid addiction if we work for the investor first and continue our experiments with the Pineal gland and astral projection.  This time, Sahina promised no one will get hurt because we will be working in a safer laboratory with new and advanced equipment.  I wanted to believe her.  I wanted to see her again. Once again, I agreed to be their lab assistant.  Somehow I feel more like their Guinea pig.  

So here I am, alone on the rooftop of a circular facility the size of a fast food joint in the middle of nowhere.  My two employers have driven off without explanation, saying only that they will be leaving the facility once a week.  This is the only place I can get reception and will send these updates out to the world during their outings.  Who knows, maybe this will somehow keep anything terrible from happening to me, the Doctors or the volunteers that arrived yesterday. 

There are four volunteers.  All of them young and vulnerable.  Each of them here for different reasons.  Hopefully, I will have a chance to explain their individual situations in more detail over time. But first,I must explain why I fear for their safety and mine.  It’s the room located in the center of this facility.  The room itself is the advanced tool Doctor Sahina spoke of over the phone.  

The Particle Disruption Chamber (PDC) vibrates every molecule in the room at a subatomic level to the same frequency as the astral plane.  I have yet to discover how the investor and the doctors transformed the light frequency we used with a laser into a vibrational frequency.  From our control room, we are going to omit this vibrational code from the metal walls of the room.  A vibe that Doctor James calls the “Eye of God” frequency.  

The Pineal gland is an antenna that the “Eye of God” will be able to broadcast with during PDC experiments.  That is the first thing Doctor James said to me when I arrived.  Not even a hello or hey, sorry about that guy we somehow fed to an astral parasite.  No, he was drunk on fanatical science as he went on to say that our camera system within the room should capture anything and everything inside the vibrational frequency of the room.  I said, “So this time we’ll be able to see the creature with our own eyes if it attacks someone again.”  He scolded me for being negative and told me that if I mentioned that incident again to him, the volunteers or anyone, that there would be legal consequences.  Honestly, I felt like he was hinting that the blowback from snitching would be far more severe than legal retribution.  I told him I understand.  

Surely there is more to the astral plane than the one shadowy leech we witnessed at the first laboratory.  After all, the poor man also mentioned lively lights that seemed benign in a beautiful garden. That gives me hope as our first PDC experiments with our new volunteers start tonight.  Maybe I am mad for going along with this.  Or maybe I’m in the right place at the right time to be a part of a historically scientific achievement for humanity as we unlock the doorway between body and soul.  

“Astralnauts” is what the volunteers fondly call themselves.  They are not as afraid as I thought they’d be.  Of course, ignorance can be bliss.  For a while, anyway.  Eventually, the curtain always gets pulled back. 

Tonight, we will vibrate the Astralnauts and their room to the astral plane frequency and continue our experiments all week long.  I am not religious.  But I don’t mind asking those who are, to pray for us.  Pray that no one gets injured or killed.  Not again.
