When I was in elementary school, rejection was part of my everyday life. I sat alone during lunch (or worse, with the teacher). I didn’t get picked for teams or group projects. No one laughed at my jokes. I wouldn’t say I was bullied, just ignored. High school was worse. By then, everyone had settled into a group. Everyone except me. Even the dorks who carried Magic The Gathering cards everywhere had a group. I had no one. I learned to live with it, but it never got easier.

I thought things would get better as I started college, or maybe when I started my career. It only got worse. Then one day as I was coming home from a terrible day at work (I was passed over for a promotion that should’ve been mine), I met someone. I don’t mean that in the romantic sense. He was an older gentleman who happened to have the misfortune of sitting next to me on a crowded train. I guess he noticed my somber countenance and took pity on me. He warmly introduced himself and we had a nice conversation for about 10 minutes. The train stopped and I stood to exit, and that’s when he slipped a card into my palm. I glanced down at it quickly to see two words in large print, “Eudaimon Society.” I was being hurried toward the exit, so I shoved it in my pocket, said my goodbye to the man, and hurried along.

I mulled over the conversation as I walked home. The man’s kindness had instantly lifted my spirit. I longed to have more of that in my life. As soon as I got home, I pulled the card from my coat pocket and inspected it further. The front had only the two large words “Eudaimon Society.” I flipped it over. The back said “Find Your Place. Be Accepted. Join Us.” followed by an address and a time. I made up my mind to attend in that instant.

The meeting was in a dimly lit warehouse. It was filled with people who looked like I felt, lost and lonely. The leader was a man they called Nastral, though that wasn’t his real name. “That’s a little on the nose,” I thought to myself, then snorted at my own joke. Then he spoke, and I was hooked. I don’t know if it was his piercing eyes or his soothing voice, but his words sucked me in like a cigar smoker coaxing a stray wisp of smoke back to his lips. He spoke of longing and belonging, of forging a family from the rejected. I was in.

I gave everything to the group. I quit my job and lived among my new brethren, sharing everything, lacking nothing. The other members became my mentors, my friends, my family. People called us a cult, but that could not have been further from the truth. Sure, there were somewhat bizarre rituals, but they were all about affirmation and belonging. Besides, all that mattered was that I’d found my place in the world. I’d never felt so loved.

I was excited when Apokeros Night, the cult's biggest holiday, came around. It was a celebration of the rejected, culminating in the group selecting one person to be honored above all. I was overwhelmed when they chose me for the honor. After the selection, I met with Nastral to discuss the ceremony.

“Your sacrifice will draw many others into the family. Your blood will bring belonging to the many who suffer.”

My heart sank as I thought of the ones who were still lost, searching as I had been.
I was thrilled to be the sacrifice, the one whose death would draw them in.

“Thank you, sir,” I croaked, fighting back tears.

That night as I climbed the dais, the warm smiles and accepting gazes of my family surrounded me. The priest embraced me, and finished preparing the altar. I felt a surge of joy. After 43 years on this planet, I’d finally found my place, my purpose. This was the best day of my life.

The priest lifted his hands and the chanting began. It was a haunting, yet beautiful song. I didn't understand the language, but I felt it. I felt it in my bone marrow. Tears rolled down my cheeks, not from fear, but from ecstasy. I was finally, truly accepted. I took in the glow of the candlelit room one last time and closed my eyes, ready to give myself for my kin.

The priest removed my robe…and then it happened. A collective gasp. A sound of both fear and betrayal. The priest, now wide eyed and shaking, pointed his bony finger at my chest. Confused, I looked down and saw it—a dark club shaped patch just above my breast. My birthmark. I'd always hated it, but here, among my family, I thought it wouldn't matter. It did.

The priest's face contorted in anguish. "Pariah!" he shouted. Others joined in slowly “Pariah!” The word bounced around the room like a basketball in gym class, passed from one person to the next, always skipping me. Then came their hands. My closest friends yanked and pulled on me. My mentors cursed me. My family, faces filled with disgust, dragged me away.

I was tossed out of the compound and onto the empty streets, gates slamming behind me. I pounded on the door, begging to be let back in, but there was only silence. I was alone once more.

I was lost and broken, but couldn't find the courage to give up. After some deliberation, I decided I’d try to reclaim my old life. I called my former employer, hoping to get my job back.

"Yeah, we're always hiring," the manager said. "Who am I speaking to?” I told him my name. There was a pause. "Oh, um, actually, I'm being told we just filled the position."

The line went dead. Rejected again.
