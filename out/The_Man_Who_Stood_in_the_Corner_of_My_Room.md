I never believed in paranormal stuff. I thought it was all just stories people told to explain the unexplainable, or to scare themselves before bed. That was until I moved into my new apartment.

It was a modest place in the city. Not too fancy, but it was mine. I was excited about the fresh start, but something about this apartment felt… off. The first night I moved in, I couldn’t shake the feeling that I wasn’t alone. I brushed it off as nerves from the move, but as the days went by, it only got worse.

The first time it happened, I woke up in the middle of the night to the sound of soft shuffling. At first, I thought it was the neighbor upstairs. I rolled over and tried to go back to sleep, but then I heard it again—closer this time. My eyes shot open, heart pounding in my chest. The sound wasn’t coming from the hallway or the ceiling; it was coming from the corner of my room.

I tried to ignore it, hoping it was just my imagination, but then I saw him. A figure. Standing in the corner, just barely visible in the dark, like he was blending into the shadows. He wasn’t moving, just standing there, still as a statue. I couldn’t see his face, but I could feel his presence. It was heavy, suffocating. I was frozen in fear.

I told myself it was just a bad dream, but the next night, the same thing happened. And the night after that. The man was always there, standing in the corner of my room, just out of clear sight. I tried sleeping with the lights on, but no matter how hard I tried to stay awake, I would always drift off, and when I woke up, I would feel him standing there.

I couldn’t tell anyone. Who would believe me? A grown adult scared of a shadow in the corner of their room? But it wasn’t just a shadow. I could feel him watching me. I could feel his presence, like a weight pressing down on my chest. And then one night, something changed.

I woke up in the middle of the night, as usual, but this time, the figure wasn’t just standing in the corner. He was moving. Slowly, step by step, he walked toward my bed. I could hear the soft scraping of his shoes on the hardwood floor, the sound sending chills down my spine. I didn’t move. I couldn’t. I wanted to scream, to run, but I was paralyzed with fear.

He stopped right next to my bed, and that’s when I heard it—the voice. A whisper, so quiet, I almost didn’t hear it.

“You’re next.”

That’s all he said. But it was enough. I don’t know how, but I somehow managed to close my eyes and drift into a fitful sleep, too terrified to open them again.

The next morning, I packed up my things and left. I didn’t care about the lease. I didn’t care about the hassle. I had to get out of that place.

A week later, I was back at my parents’ house, still shaken from the experience. I’ve tried to forget about it, but last night, I found something in my old box of belongings. It was a picture frame- a photo from the day I first moved in. I was standing in the living room, smiling, excited about my new place. But in the background, standing in the corner of the room, was the figure.

The same man.

I don’t know if he followed me, or if he was always there, waiting. But I do know one thing for sure now: I was never alone in that apartment. And I don’t think I ever will be again.

I don’t know what he wants, but I do know this he’s not gone. Not yet.
