When I (?m) woke up today, everything was seemingly fine. I had never slept so well in my life, but i had this fuzzy feeling in my brain. Like I wasn't quite myself.

As my eyes began to waken and i got out of bed I started feeling worse. I had a pounding headache and it was like gravity had doubled. That's when I relised. This is not my house.

it all looked so familiar and homely, but not mine. Now that I think about it, I don't actually remember coming home last night. In fact i don't even remember what my normal bedroom looks like.

As ef the memory is slowly fading. As I took my first steps out of bed, i felt my knees crumbling beneath me.

With each step I took, it became harder to move. Not only that, it become harder to think. To remember. My mind was racing trying to think of just one thing about how I ended up here. Nothing.

Panic kicked in. I began to frantically search the room i awoke in for clues, but it just looks like a normal room.

It has a king sized bed, a big wooden desk with a matching dresser. It has sort of a royal feel to it. It also has a tall square mirror, a night stand with a phone and a shelf with some antiques.

The phone!, I thought. I'll just call a friend to come pick me up and try to make sense of how I ended up here. I picked up the phone and began to dial the number to my good friend John Des(?).

After I typed the first 3 digits I felt the memory slipping out of my head. I had forgotten again. Not only that, but my muscle memory wasn't there either. Not gone, but different somehow. replaced.

I had gained different movements, different habits, a different mind. A different person. As I tried to make sense of how my basic habits could change over night i saw my hands.

They are old and wrinkly. shaking without support. and scarred. Scars all over. The hands of a retired worker i thought. Even as i'm writing this it's hard to control them.

I tried to remember what I looked like before, but nothing. again.

I couldn't even remember my name anymore. The panic had turned to fear. It grew quicker. That's when I took all the strength in this fragile body, and the determination in this fragile mind to rush to the mirror.

The fear had pushed me moving, full of energy. But I was even more afraid to look in the mirror. I stood in front of the mirror with my eyes closed for what felt like an hour.

It took everything in me to finally open my eyes, and that's when I saw. Joe Biden. The face and body of Joe biden staring right back at me. Not only that, but also the mind. That was me in the mirror.

A new me.

And now I'm here writing this, in hopes of someone coming to aid me. Even if just one person believes me, please send help.

I'm located at. oops i forgorðŸ’€
