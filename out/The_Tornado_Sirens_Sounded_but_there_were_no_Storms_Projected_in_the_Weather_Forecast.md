Growing up in Oklahoma you learn to respect the tornado sirens. They wail their low, sorrowful cry, warning you to get underground before the sky falls apart. I grew up in a town called Yukon, it was nestled in a large valley with the city just a mere thirty minutes away. It was small and tight-knit, the kind of town you’d want to raise a family in. As a kid I loved my little home, but as the years passed, and the big companies moved in, the little sanctuary turned into a metropolis. This often happened to the townships bordering Oklahoma City, it was a sad but obvious reality, the city always spreads. 

My family, trying to flee the city, up and moved south, nearer the red river, onto a quaint 30-acre ranch. We made a neat farm and raised many animals. I began attending a small church where I’d eventually meet my wife, Aubrey. When I turned eighteen, I felt my countries calling to join the Army, and my colleges calling. I joined in an attempt to pay for my higher education, but my family, well-off as they may have been, wasn't willing to pay.

My first duty station was in Texas, but after my first contract I decided to leave and try my luck elsewhere in Oklahoma. So Aubrey and our baby girl, Macey May, moved back to the farm. I began job searching, something that would cater to my military training. After a long process of interviews, polygraphs, background checks, and the lot, I started working for an intelligence agency, at a site that officially never existed. Don’t worry about me breaking any NDAs. I doubt the agency is even a thing anymore. I began my work in downtown Oklahoma City. It was a perilous, one and a half hour drive from the farm everyday. I normally carpooled with my Dad as he worked at Will Rogers airport. He could drop me off a good fifteen minutes before my shift started and still make it in time for him to get to work.

It was at this new job I began to see the true horrors of the world, the things the media doesn't get to see. The people that quietly go missing, knowing they were killed by their governments and their families along with them. I had been at my new assignment for a mere week when I got the email that tortures me still, the subject line read:

“Winter Harvest Begins - 02/20 - Eyes North - Godspeed”

There was no body to the email, only the oddest classification I'd ever seen, QCLS-PRESDONLY. I knew I wasn't meant to see this, perhaps it was a mistake in our filtering algorithm that I got it. Either way it didn't matter, I got it and I knew something no one else in my office did. I got up and told my manager I wasn't feeling well and that I needed to go home. He understood and let me off early. I called my father,

“I got off early, can you come get me?” I managed to get out.
“Yeah I’m bored anyway… I’m coming.”

He got there about fifteen minutes later and we headed home in silence, something that wouldn't last for long. I tried to call Aubrey, I swear I did. I even tried the house phone hoping my little 3 year old would answer. Maybe her sweet little voice could soften my heart, if only for a few seconds. The thought of hearing my families voice once more, fled when the alert on my phone went off:

“WARNING—SEEK SHELTER IMMEDIATELY”

That’s when the sirens started but that night, they screamed differently, fast, sharp, panicked. Like something was already there. Dad slammed on the brakes and pulled over near a 7-11. We both got out, just in time to see the light.

A white flash, then, nothing… nothing but the sirens. The half-second of nothing abruptly ended as the shockwave threw our car onto me. I was pinned there for two days. Half of it I was out cold, the other half I was too scared to move. I don't know how I survived, but I’m not glad I did. My skin practically singed off and the white flash still lingered in my eyes.

That day the world changed, not how you might think it would change after a nuclear attack though. The sky wasnt right anymore, the air smelled wrong, thick and metallic. Fires raged on without a fuel source. Shapes moved in the smoke, too big to be human. And the people… well the ones who survived anyway, they weren't right either. Though I don’t remember a time when they ever were.

It’s been three days now and I still haven't seen the sun. I'm holed up in an old firework warehouse. The computers and internet still work, but at night, when the sirens are the loudest; I hear howls, as if… something… someone... wants the sirens to stop as bad as I do. I sit here with nothing but the computer screen to give off light. I’m hungry, thirsty, and tired. Most of all though, I want to find Aubrey, and Macey. I write to you all in an attempt to understand my situation. 

Was Oklahoma the only state to be devastated like this? Is anyone on the internet still? Am I the only one still alive? Have you seen the things that Howl?
