I just started this job about a week ago. 



Was broke as a joke and between jobs when my friend Anthony hit me up about it.



It had decent pay, just had to assess some old circus carnival equipment to see what could be fixed up and resold versus what was only good for scrap parts. 



The woman hiring is this typical southern lady, let’s just call her Ms. Jean.



In her mid-forties, with graying blonde hair and sun-weathered skin. Thick southern accent, calls everyone "sugar" and "hon," but tougher than a two-dollar steak when it comes to business. 



She had this habit of lighting up a Marlboro Red while she talked, cupping her hand around the flame even when there wasn't any wind. Never had kids, she told us, said she preferred to spend her money on "good whiskey and bad decisions" instead of diapers and college funds. 



She inherited this old circus lot from her late daddy and wanted to just sell what she could.



"Just call me Ms. Jean," she said when I was being all formal and shit, extending a calloused hand for a firm handshake. The smell of tobacco clung to her fingers.



Cool lady, and the job seemed straightforward enough. 



——————————————————————————————————————————



The circus was 30 minutes out of town. Once I drove up there, I was struck by how the whole lot was surrounded by this thick, dense, forrest.



Massive pines, and ancient oaks with trunks so wide three people couldn't wrap their arms around them, stretching up like they were trying to touch the sky. Spanish moss hung from the oak branches like tattered curtains, swaying even when there wasn't much of a breeze, carrying the smell of damp bark and resin. That made the place feel even more isolated, like we were working in some forgotten corner of the world where time had just stopped, and nature was slowly reclaiming what man had built.



Ms. Jean walked me and the crew around on the first day, showed us what areas to focus on. Most of the grounds were fair game, and there was plenty of work to keep us busy.



"Michelle, start with the electrical systems on the carousel and Mr. Dennis with that Scrambler over there," she said, pointing to a ride that looked like a giant egg-beater.



"Most of this stuff just needs a good cleaning and some new wiring, but don't waste time on anything that's too far gone."



Then Ms. Jean split us up by sections and rides so we wouldn't be getting in each other's way. 



Anthony got the bumper cars, and I was stuck with the carousel.



To be honest, this place felt like something straight out of an apocalyptic movie.



Picture this.



The whole carnival stretched across maybe ten acres, with a main midway that had once been paved but was now cracked and overrun with dandelions and crabgrass pushing through every fissure.



Rusted down carnival rides jutted up through waist-high weeds. Their once-bright paint now faded. A massive Ferris wheel dominated the skyline, leaning like the Tower of Pisa with several of its passenger cars hanging open like broken jaws. Half the spokes were missing entirely, and what remained was wrapped in vines. Torn canvas hung from skeletal ride frames—pieces of what used to be game booths and food stands torn apart like a jaguar came through and went to town on the place. The air hung heavy with something sweet and sickly.



Then, of course there was the carousel, sitting in the center of it all. Its painted horses were frozen mid-gallop, their manes faded from what must have been vibrant colors to ghostly pastels. Some had fallen off their poles entirely, lying on their sides in the tall grass, their lifeless eyes made of glass, staring at you no matter which direction you turned. The carousel's central mechanism was exposed—a tangle of gears and chains that smelled of mildew and motor oil gone rancid.



But you can tell it used to be something special, you know?



Someone put a lot of love into building this place.



At least, originally. 



——————————————————————————————————————————



Everything was normal.



Until one afternoon.



I was working alone because Anthony went into town to grab some grub and supplies from the hardware store. 



I'd been fighting with this old carousel control panel all morning—a massive metal box filled with decades-old wiring that looked like someone had let a family of rats build nests in there. 



The smell of burnt electrical components and rat shit was enough to make you reconsider your life choices. 



I was trying to figure out if the electrical systems were salvageable or if we should just strip 'em for copper and scrap the rest.



The summer heat was kicking my ass ‘round two in the afternoon, sweat pouring down my face and soaking through my work shirt. 



The air was so thick and humid you could practically chew it, carrying the heavy scent of honeysuckle from the forest mixed with the acrid smell of old grease. Gnats kept buzzing around my head like tiny dive bombers.



I was about ready to take a break and find some shade when I heard it.



Music?



Carnival music.



Real tinkling. 



Sounded like a music box.



Delicate and haunting, like something you'd hear from an antique jewelry store or one of those old-fashioned ice cream trucks. 



The melody was slow and melancholy, kind of sad in a way that made the hair on the back of my neck stand up. 



My first thought was that one of the guys had gotten something working.



So I dropped my wire cutters and electrical tape, wiped the sweat from my forehead, and followed the sound.



But here's the thing. 



It wasn't coming from any of the rides we'd been working on. It was coming from deeper in the woods, beyond the carnival grounds entirely.



I stood there for a minute, pondering to myself whether I should go check it out or just get back to work.



Look, I know I should've just minded my own damn business.



 But I was curious as a cat in a fish market. 



I started walking toward the tree line, pushing past the rusted ticket booth and a collapsed funnel cake stand that still somehow carried the faint, stale smell of old cooking oil and sugar.



And, that's when I noticed it—a little dirt path, barely visible, winding its way up into the forest like a snake. 



Looked like it hadn't been used in years, maybe decades. 



Grass and weeds had grown up through the packed earth, and fallen branches lay across it every few feet. But it was definitely a path, worn smooth by years of footsteps.



I followed that faded trail, pushing through bark and bush.



The deeper I went, the cooler it got under that canopy of leaves, and the air changed completely. 



Sunlight filtered down in dappled patches, creating a greenish twilight even though it was the middle of the afternoon. The air smelled of rich black soil, and that clean, sharp scent of pine sap. 





The path curved around a massive oak tree, its roots creating natural steps in the faded trail. Spanish moss hung so thick from its branches it was like walking through curtains, and that I had to push the trailing strands aside to keep going. 



What I found back there stopped me dead in my tracks.



——————————————————————————————————————————



"What the fuck?" Internally, when I stumbled across it.



Hidden behind all that overgrowth was a small cemetery. 



Not like a proper one with neat rows and manicured grass—just maybe a dozen old headstones scattered around a small circular clearing like crooked teeth, most so weathered by time and weather you couldn't read 'em. 



The clearing itself was maybe thirty feet across, ringed by those ancient oaks and pines that seemed to lean inward, creating a natural cathedral. 



Thick moss covered most of the stone surfaces in soft green blankets, and ivy had wrapped around several markers like hands trying to pull them back into the earth. 



The air here was different than the rest of the forest—still and heavy, with a particular smell that old cemeteries have. Not exactly decay, but something deeper. Something that spoke of  forgotten memories.



The ones I could make out were dates going back to the 1840s and 1850s, carved in that old-fashioned style with deep, gothic lettering that must have taken days to chisel by hand. 



Names on the headstones like "Ezekiel," "Sinclair," and "Evers." 



This wasn't some carnival burial ground—this was settler stuff, maybe a family plot from when this was all farmland way before any circus ever set up here. 



But that ain't the weird part. 



The weird part was what I found sitting on the forest floor near the biggest headstone in the center.



A music box. 



The music box.



And I'm not talking about some beat-up antique covered in rust like everything else in the place. 

This thing was absolutely pristine. Beautiful cream-colored porcelain with intricate gold brass fittings and delicate painted roses scattered across its surface. The glass top was crystal clear, and inside were these tiny carousel horses—painted white with flowing manes and adorned with small floral garlands. Bright gold poles connected them to the mechanism above, and they were spinning slowly to that eerie little melody, their glossy eyes seeming to follow me as they turned.



Standing there looking at that scene, I got goosebumps all up and down my arms and the back of my neck, which made no damn sense because it had to be ninety-five degrees in the shade. 



I picked it up—thing was heavier than expected, really well made. 



The second I lifted it, the music stopped.



The base was smooth mahogany with no markings or nothing.



My first thought was someone had to have left this recently. Maybe some collector heard about the place and snuck in to look around, got spooked by our work crew and dropped it. 



——————————————————————————————————————————



So, I took it back to Ms. Jean. Figured she'd know what to do, maybe how to find whoever lost it.



Found her in the trailer she uses as an office, doing paperwork with reading glasses on.



"Hey Ms. Jean," I said, holding up the music box. 



"Found this back in of the lot. Someone must've dropped it recently. Any idea who might've been poking around back there?"



The look on her face... I'll never forget it. She went white as a sheet and just stared at that box like I'd brought her a goddamn bomb.



"Where exactly did you find that?" Her voice was rough.



"Back in those woods. There's actually a little cemetery back there. I found it sitting on the biggest headstone. Someone's gonna be heartbroken they lost this thing."



She stood up real slow, never taking her eyes off the box. Her hands were shaking, and I swear I heard her whisper "Oh Lord, protect us" under her breath. Then she made the sign of the cross.



"Michelle, Hon, listen to me very carefully. There is no cemetery in the woods.." 



"But that's impossible. I was just there! And look at this thing—it ain't even dusty. The craftsmanship is incredible, and—"



"Give it to me. Now." Her voice had gone cold and commanding in a way I'd never heard before.



Before I could even react, she snatched it right out of my hands. The moment she touched it; her whole body went rigid.



"Lord have mercy... I was hoping this day would never come," she whispered, carefully wrapping the music box in what looked like an old kitchen towel.



She rushed to a cabinet and pulled out a small bottle of what looked like holy water and some bundle of dried herbs.



"Here, take these with you when you go. Sprinkle the water on yourself and burn the sage. And Michelle..." She grabbed my arm, her grip surprisingly strong. "Don't go back there alone."



"I'll handle this myself. You stay away from those woods, you hear me? Don't go back there for any reason."



I tried to ask her why, what she wasn't telling me, but she was already shoving the wrapped music box into a locked filing cabinet and heading for the door, leaving me standing there with a growing feeling that I'd stumbled into something way bigger than a simple salvage job.
