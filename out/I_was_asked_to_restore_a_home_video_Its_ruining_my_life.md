I work as a freelancer digitizing and repairing old media. It’s a nice living—I get a lot of business from fellow millennials, extracting memories from damaged VHSs, rolls of film, floppy disks, and SD cards. I’ve always liked my work—that is, until “Marcy” called me.

(Now of course, with everything that has happened, I doubt that’s her real name.)

Anyway, “Marcy” claimed that she had a daughter who was turning twenty in a few days. As a birthday gift, she wanted to restore a home video of her sixth birthday party. She’d pay double my usual rate to get it done on time.

I agreed. She came by and dropped it off outside my door in a little brown paper bag. I thought that was odd—wasn’t she worried I might not see it, or it would get rained on? Was she in such a hurry that she couldn’t knock and hand it to me in person? But I didn’t think too much of it.

I brought it inside and opened it up. The VHS tape looked more damaged than what I was used to. It was one of those mini ones, like you’d stick in a handheld camcorder. The plasticky ribbon that held the actual video was a little crinkled, but I could probably smooth it out. More concerning were the black smudges all over the VHS, and the corners that appeared melted.

As if… the cassette had been in a fire?

Someone had scrawled across the label: *Birthday Party.* No name, no date. Just “Birthday Party.” I wondered how Marcy knew it was the correct birthday party tape.

“Well, let’s see if you work,” I muttered to myself, pulling out the VCR. With some difficulty due to its warped shape, I popped the VHS in. I pressed REWIND. It made a sad thrumming noise, a little bit of a screech to it, like the wheels were off-center.

I frowned. The VHS was probably too damaged to fully digitize. Too bad. I’d already been dreaming about the Magic the Gathering cards I was going to buy with my earnings.

I pressed PLAY.

The image was staticky snow for a second. Then a kitchen appeared. It was clearly all decked out for a kid’s birthday: a pennant-style banner hung from the sliding glass door. A cake sat on the table, with six unlit candles stuck in the frosting. A dozen place settings with pink paper plates and cutlery decorated the table. Several pink and purple balloons drifted back and forth, tied to one of the chairs.

But there were no people.

No kids, no adults, nothing. *I guess they wanted to take a video of the place all decorated, before the kids arrived?*

The camera shook as the person took a few steps back from the table. I sat there, admiring the scene—

There was something on the floor.

I leaned in towards the crappy old TV, squinting. What *was* that?

Then the camcorder started to pan around the room.

I froze.

There was someone lying on the floor. No—*multiple* people. A woman with flowing dark hair, arms splayed out at her sides. A little girl in pigtails. A balding dad. A little boy wearing a pointy birthday hat.

All of them lying face-down on the floor.

I slapped my hand over my mouth. My entire body began shaking.

*What the fuck. What the fuck.* The camera slowly panned over the room, like the person holding it was calm. Collected. Like they were calmly recording evidence.

*Fuck fuck fuck.*

It was at least eight moms and dads, all lying face down on the beige kitchen tile next to their children. And it was so… unnatural. There was no blood. No people twisted in horrible positions of terror or pain. There was no evidence that they’d been murdered at all, or even that they were dead.

All of the bodies were pointed towards the kitchen table. *Like someone positioned them,* I thought, my stomach twisting.

*Oh God, oh God.*

I grabbed my phone and began to dial 911. But from the beige refrigerator, the gingham curtains, the corded house phone in the video—this had been taken in the ‘90s or ‘00s. This had happened a long, long time ago, and the victims lying on the floor were long gone.

A *click* jolted me back to the screen.

The person behind the camera was holding a lighter. They lit each candle and then took a step back. The six flames danced and wavered.

Then the footage jittered, warped, and turned into staticky snow.

I dialed 911.

But it was pretty uneventful. The officer didn’t help much. He questioned me on what I did that day, what Marcy sounded like. Then he took the footage. I left early, too shaken up to continue working.

As soon as I got home, I did all kinds of searches. *Birthday party massacre 90s. Families dead at birthday party.* I even did a reverse phone number lookup for “Marcy.”

All dead ends.

Against my better judgement, I’d recorded part of it on my phone to show my wife. She always accused me of exaggerating things and being a little bit of a hypochondriac, so I wanted to show her this was serious. When she saw it, her face dropped. “That’s fucked up,” was all she could choke out.

I called the police station later that night, but the officer didn’t seem to be taking it that seriously. “Probably just a prank video,” he said. “There’s not even any definitive evidence that they’re even deceased.”

So that was that.

I triple-checked the locks and hugged my daughter extra tight that night. She was around the same age—almost seven—and I kept picturing her as one of those kids, face-down on the beige tile floor.

I thought I’d have trouble sleeping, but I guess I tired myself out. I was startled awake by a loud *thump*downstairs.

*What the…*

I rolled over to tell my wife, but her side of the bed was empty.

After checking on our daughter, I walked down the stairs. “Darlene?” I called out softly. “You down there?”

Golden light spilled out from the kitchen.

“Darlene?”

No response.

I walked down the stairs, one hand on the phone in my pocket. The wood creaked under my weight. I held my breath—

Darlene was lying face-down on the kitchen floor.

Her arms were sprawled out at her sides. Her brown hair cascading down her shoulders and onto the floor, covering her face. “Darlene!” I screamed, running towards her.

She was unresponsive.

The paramedics came.

We rushed to the hospital.

She was alive. But in a coma. The doctor thought she must’ve fallen and hit her head. That was their theory.

But I know better.

When I finally got home later that afternoon, I found a brown paper bag on my doorstep. Inside was a single mini VHS, singed at the edges.

In the same looping handwriting, it read:

*Anniversary Party*
