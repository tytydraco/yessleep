I always loved spiders. What's happening right now is not their fault. It's really not their fault. They don't do this when they're in their right mind. No matter how big they are, they would never truly harm a person unless that person provoked it. That's what I always told my friend told my best friend Grady, and he always believed me. I'm not sure how he feels now after being attacked by both of them. That's when I knew that things weren't right. Grady would never cause any actual harm to anyone. He was the most gentle guy I knew. I was able to stop them before they could do anymore damage and took him to my house to recover. I asked him why they attacked him. He told me he was trying to stop them from attacking a woman that was just trying to get past. Why were they doing that? That's not what I made them all for.

They were supposed to help people. They were supposed to keep the town safe and make people see them they way I do.

"Macie, what are we going to do?" Grady asked me.

I looked at him, and before I could answer, there was a knock at the door. I got up and went to answer it.

Our friend Maggie stood there. The hood that covered her pointy ears was now being pulled down. She looked at me with a serious expression.

"We have a problem," She said, walking into the house. She immediately noticed Grady and ran up to him. "Looks like you guys might already know."

Grady nodded at her. Maggie then looked back at me.

"The spiders," Maggie said. "They've all gone crazy. You won't believe what I saw them doing to people."

Maggie was always laid back, so for her to look at me with such a serious expression on her face concerning the bug that I loved so much sent a chill down my spine. What could those spiders have possibly done?

"It's horrible out there, Macie," Maggie told him as she got up. "They're killing people, eating them, ripping them apart. This is all our fault."

"I-It can't be!" I said. "This is not how spiders are! They're gentle, pure creatures who wouldn't hurt a soul unless provoked!"

Maggie shook her head. "Not in this case, Macie. I'm sorry but they've just gone crazy."

She walked up to me, placing a hand on my shoulder. "We need to slow this problem and we need to do it now. The longer we just stay in here, the more people will die."

I shook my head rapidly. "N-No! I won't do what you're applying! I won't kill them! Not only are they spiders now but they were once people who's lives I've changed. I won't take away their lives after I was the one to change them and make them this way!"

Maggie just gave me a sad smile. "You have such a big heart, Macie. But the best thing you can do for me now is put them out of their misery."

I looked at her. As much as I didn't want to admit it I knew she was right. The best thing I could do for my creation was put an end to it before it could do anymore damage. 

After about an hour to repair and working on something I felt could help, I told Grady to stay and rest up while me and Maggie went to take care of the spiders.

When we got not town, it didn't take long for us to run into one of them. He stood on two legs, all six of his arms out, and his six eyes all staring at us. 

At first I didn't want to just outright blast him but he felt me no choice when he had Maggie on the ground after a bit of fighting and was able to eat her head off. Maggie thanked me for the save and we continued on.

From there, there we ran into the other one we were looking for. This one was the first one I transformed.

His name was Killian. A man that Maggie had suggested be the first one to convert into a spider. She said he was willing to drink what I made that would help them fulfill the plan I wanted to complete. He was like the others as Maggie told me. He was someone who had done wrong and needed to redeem himself. He needed a change. A new look. She said he was willing to go along with the plan to help people in our town see spiders in a new long.

Now here was. A bloody thirsty creature looking to tear us apart.

He let out a roar as he charged at us both. I could tell he was angry. He wasn't just some creature looking for food. He was a rage-fueled monster looking for revenge. Before he could get me, I was behind him. He looked behind and saw me. This made him even angrier.  When I looked into his eyes I didn't see just anger.

There was pain and sadness. He went to grab me so I had to blast him again. That's when I knew I was right. There was something else wrong. He couldn't control himself.

I quickly took out the tube I brought with me and when I had the chance, I slid it into his mouth.

He let out a horrible scream. Shit. Something was wrong again. He began vomiting as his skin began to change and things started to appear then disappear on his body. This wasn't supposed to happen. I should've taken more time.

I went to check up on him but Maggie stopped me before shooting at him a couple of times when she noticed he was coming towards us.

Killian fell down to the ground, his body twitching. His eyes looked over at us. "W-Why?" He asked.

Maggie walked up to him as I watched. He wanted her to help him. I wanted her to see if there was anything she could do for him.

"Because you failed us."

Then, she shot him one more time in the head.
