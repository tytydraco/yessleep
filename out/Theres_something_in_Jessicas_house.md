It was a dark and stormy night, the kind of night that sent shivers down your spine. Jessica could feel the hairs on the back of her neck stand on end as she walked through the empty streets towards her apartment. The rain fell in heavy sheets, pouring down on the pavement and creating a eerie sound that seemed to echo in the darkness.

As she turned the corner onto her street, Jessica caught a glimpse of something moving in the shadows. She dismissed it as her imagination playing tricks on her, but the feeling of unease lingered as she quickened her pace. Just a few more blocks and she would be safe in her cozy apartment, away from the horrors of the night.

But as she approached her building, Jessica felt a sudden chill run down her spine. The front door was ajar, swinging back and forth in the wind. She hesitated for a moment, her heart pounding in her chest, before mustering up the courage to step inside. The foyer was dark and quiet, the only sound the patter of rain against the windows.

As she made her way up the stairs to her apartment, Jessica couldn't shake the feeling that she was being watched. She quickened her pace, reaching for her keys as she reached her door. But before she could unlock it, she heard a faint whisper in her ear.

"Jessica..."

She froze, her blood running cold. Turning slowly, she saw a figure standing in the shadows at the end of the hall. It was a woman, her face obscured in darkness. Jessica's heart raced as she tried to make out the features of the stranger, but the figure remained still and silent.

"Who are you?" Jessica managed to stammer, her voice barely above a whisper.

The figure took a step forward, the dim light flickering off her pale, ghostly skin. Jessica's breath caught in her throat as she recognized the face staring back at her - it was her own reflection, twisted and contorted in a grotesque mockery of herself.

With a scream, Jessica turned and ran down the hall, her footsteps echoing in the empty building. She could hear the figure following close behind, its footsteps matching hers with unnerving precision. She reached her apartment door, desperate to escape the nightmare that pursued her.

But as she fumbled with her keys, she felt a cold hand on her shoulder. Turning around, Jessica came face to face with the ghostly figure, its features now clear in the dim light. It was her own reflection, but with eyes black as coal and a twisted smile that sent shivers down her spine.

"Welcome home, Jessica," the figure whispered, its voice cold and hollow.

And with that, the reflection lunged forward, its icy grip closing around Jessica's throat. She screamed as darkness enveloped her, the horrors of the night consuming her completely. And as the storm raged on outside, the building fell silent, save for the sound of rain against the windows and the muffled screams of a woman trapped in her own personal hell.
