I left the airport, and the first thing I saw was the sign with the name “Angel Jin” I knew that was my ride to Aunt Leslie's house. I lost my hearing when I was 4 years old and this because I was on the verge of death with an infection and the doctors decided to use a medication that one of its possible adverse effects was deafness, in the end it is better to be alive than dead, I guess; After that I never had a good relationship with my parents, and the proof of it is that they never even took the time to learn sign language, it's as if I was just a hindrance to them, so I have simply decided to withdraw into myself , at the end of the day it's not like I have much to talk to them, and from what I see my parents are already bored of having to deal with "the poor disabled brat" so they decided to send me for the rest of the summer with a woman whom I barely know, I have never seen her in people, only in family photos and the only thing I could find out about her is that apparently she gave birth less than 3 months ago and that she is a workaholic, obviously I would like to know more about the half stranger with whom I will spend the rest of my vacation, but what else can i do? Nobody tells me many things, nobody talks to the deaf girl. I can't wait for the day that i can go away from everyone.

I arrived at Aunt Leslie's house, is a very nice place, but there is a tense atmosphere, I wonder what kind of favor this woman owes my parents for her to agree to have me in her house for two months, because her expressions are extremely forced and make me understand that I am not totally welcome; and obviously, she would never trust someone she just met to take care of her child, I'm not really complaining either, it's not like i had any interest in it either; She finished telling me that the babysitter would arrive around 2-3 pm and that I would always carry the control that indicates that someone is knocking at the door, how condescending, right?

Around 2 pm, I feel the control vibrate, I opened the door, and in front of me is a woman of about 50 years old, blonde hair and a friendly smile, her lips begin to move, but I made gestures to her to let her know that i can´t hear her, she took out a notebook and wrote "Hello, my name is Brenda, I'm the babysitter that Leslie hired." My face lit up in understanding and I let her pass. Everything seemed under control, so I decided to go to my room.

I found myself waking up from a short nap, I think it was 10 minutes before 3 pm, I decided to go check on brenda and the baby, I don't want to burst into the room abruptly because I could wake up the child, so I slowly open up the door a little bit and there he is, from what I infer from the blue blanket, a baby boy of at least 2 months old sleeping peacefully, when I was about to completely open the door, the control rang, letting me know that there is someone at the door, Confused, I go to the living room wondering if Aunt Leslie left work early, I opened it and find myself face to face with a woman of about 30 years old, she smiles and begins to speak to me in sign language “hello, you must be Angel, Mrs. Leslie told me about you, I am Karina, the babysitter, I am so sorry for being late, can I come in?” And that's when my eyes open wide and I ran to the baby´s room, when I enter, I saw the baby sleeping peacefully and I let out the sigh of relief that I had stuck in my chest, at least the child is safe, but there is no clue of the middle-aged intruder, I scanned the room looking for something out of place when my face turned so pale that it made me look dead in life, I felt like I was losing my breath and a chill ran through my entire body, in front of me it was another crib, empty, with a pink blanket on the mattress.
