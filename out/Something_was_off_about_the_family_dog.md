Pixie has been the family dog for over eight years now. Ever since the day we found her as a puppy on the side of the road, she's been treated like a pampered princess. Now that she's in her later years, she gets all the treats and new toys she could possibly want. Just a few months ago, I moved out of my childhood home to go spread my wings and finally live in all on my own... well, almost. Of course I had to bring Pixie with me. My life wouldn't be quite the same without her and her wet nose sniffing at my face in the mornings.

        She was acting different, though. Not necessarily in a negative way, but still... different. She took up a new hobby, which involved sprinting at top speed through the halls of the new house and playing with more aggression than she ever did in the past. Pixie was never an aggressive dog. She always knew when to take it down a notch and be gentler when she was playing with others. 

        Part of me thought that maybe it was the new house and that she just needed more time to adjust, but I also had that creeping thought in the back of my mind that something was very wrong. I knew that in some cases, when someone was nearing their final days, they would get a burst of energy as if they had miraculously become young again. Like their joints no longer hurt and their energy had been replenished.

        I decided to bring her to the vet to get her checked out, just to be sure that she was still healthy. After the veterinarian checked my dog, she told me that nothing was wrong with her. Pixie was healthy. All of her labs came back perfect and as far as they could tell, she was all in the clear. 

         Following Pixie's check-up, there were many sleepless nights. It seemed that after we got back, her energy levels and aggression only increased. More and more items would disappear and turn up again completely ruined with teeth marks. My lack of sleep was beginning to eat at me, and I'd occasionally see something lingering at the edge of my peripheral vision. I knew that this was only due to the human brain filling in the spaces, so I didn't feel frightened. I knew I desperately needed more sleep, but even when trying to take quick naps, Pixie would always run through the house or jump up on me, licking my face. 

        I knew that if I wasn't going to be able to get some rest that night, then I needed to at least get some fresh air, so that's what I did. I drove out to the pet store, walked around the isles a bit, and selected a new toy for her, one that she most certainly wouldn't be able to chew through. With the tough animal shaped toy in hand, I went to the front checkout to pay. After I left the shop, I stood in the parking lot next to my car for a moment. The crisp night air felt good against my face. Finally being away from the constant racket of my rowdy dog was like a breath of fresh air. 

        As I sat down into the driver's side, what was once a feeling of peace slowly slipped away into a feeling of unfamiliar dread. The hairs on my arms stood up and the palms of my hands became clammy. My eyes began darting around the empty parking lot. Why was I feeling this way? Was this an anxiety attack of some sort, or was it just my severe lack of sleep catching up to me? I placed my hand on my chest and focused on taking deep breaths until I could feel my heartbeat slow. I let out a sigh and lifted my head with my eyes closed. My eyes slowly opened again, and I stared up at the ceiling of the car for a moment before focusing my attention back to the parking lot in front of me.

        The blood suddenly drained from my face. Staring right back at me, just inches from my windshield, were two animalistic eyes set deeply in an unnaturally warped face. A scream erupted from my lungs as the creature suddenly vanished. It was like it was never there to begin with. My chest moved rapidly up and down as I gasped for air. Nothing could have possibly run away in such a tiny amount of time, I knew that for sure. It was like a nightmare. I placed my face in my hands and roughly rubbed my eyes. I needed sleep. Badly.

        I admit, I probably shouldn't have been driving in my panicked and sleep deprived state, but I made it back home safely. I think I had finally reached my breaking point, because the moment I got home, I just turned off the lights and fell fast asleep on the living room couch.

        There was a crinkling sound... It was faint, but it was still enough to wake me up. I slowly got up and grabbed my phone, turning on its flashlight. Again, my heart raced. Cautiously, I walked through the house, trying my best to avoid creaky floorboards. As I reached the open door to my bedroom, I aimed my light into the darkness. My light landed on the new toy I had bought for Pixie. I guess she helped herself to it while I fell asleep on the couch, and she definitely did a number on it. Shredded pieces of fabric and rope laid strewn about the bedroom floor. White stuffing was absolutely everywhere. I had no idea how she could have mauled the durable toy in such little time, but my main concern were the stains. Along the edges of the torn fabric, was unnaturally thick saliva. Upon closer inspection, the saliva seemed to be mixed with a red stringy substance. Blood.

        Immediately, I began searching for Pixie. I worried that she had somehow managed to hurt herself while tearing through the tough material. Frantically rushing through the hall and turning into the living room again, there I saw her. She stood there innocently and undisturbed. I pulled her lips back gently with my fingers, examining her gums. When I didn't find any sign of injury there, I moved on to the rest of her body. She was perfectly okay without a single drop of blood on her. I let out a sigh of relief and made my way back to the bedroom, calling her to follow me in.

        I was too tired to care about the mess of scraps on the floor. The bed creaked as I fell face first onto my pillow. I let out a groan of frustration as I tugged at my blanket, which was obviously too small for my new bed. I gave up trying to adjust my blanket and just laid there face down until I drifted off into a calm sleep. 

        As my leg hung off the side of the bed, a warm sensation spread across my skin, half waking me up. Without moving, I let out a soft grunt and began drifting back into sleep. A few moments later, the sensation moved down to my ankle. 

        "Pixie," I said with annoyance into my pillow. The slimy feeling continued to the bottom of my foot, where uneven breaths lingered.

        "Pixie, stop that-" My words trailed off as I looked up to see her curled up and quivering next to my pillow. My heart dropped and I slowly turned my head to look behind me. There it was. The same creature that had been on the front of my car now sat hunched by the bottom of my bed staring right into my soul, only this time, I got a better look as it morphed from a dog to some kind of inhuman creature. Its eyes seemed almost too small for its head. Matted and patchy fur covered its humanoid face, and it grinned with dog-like teeth in a way that almost seemed painful. Air loosely leaked from its throat, seemingly mocking a panting dog. 

        Shooting up from the bed, I grabbed Pixie in my arms and threw myself out of the room. I ran with all my might to the back door and slammed it open. There was a police station just on the other side of a small, wooded area, and that was my goal. My legs burned like fire as I hauled my dog with me through the trees. Quick quadrupedal footsteps staggered behind us, and I knew that if I looked back, neither of us would survive. Adrenaline whipped through my body as aggressive snarling followed close behind. 

        We were almost there... just fifty more steps......... twenty more........ ten....  five..... three...... two..... My shoulder slammed into the front doors of the police station. They were locked. I screamed for help with everything I had in my lungs. My whole body shook wildly with each desperate attempt to be heard. Suddenly, the door forcefully shoved open, and officers pulled us into the building. Doors slammed behind us, and I whipped my head around to look out the windows. Pixie shook with fear on the tile floor, tail between her legs. There was nothing. Outside, everything was impossibly still. The creature was gone and all that was left was the ominous darkness that seemed to be seeping from the woods.
