When I were in summer vacation, I didn't wanted to go in another country, at the beach or in a big city like every year, I just wanted to go in a different place, but stay in France. So I went in a beautiful little town in the middle of a forest. The region was still not really developed in the sense of technology and the population was really small, there were not many tourists and internet wasn't working well. I took an hotel and I stayed in the town for the day, but at night, I really didn't wanted to return at the hotel, so I decided to take a walk in the forest, local people told me there were beautiful falls near. But maybe it was a bad idea to go at night... 

I walked on that little road for 2 hours, but I still haven't found the falls. So I decided to return at the town and ask more precisions, when I felt like something cold caressing me. I turned back, nothing. So I thought I dreamt because I were tired, but my hairs started to stand on end, like I felt someone is staring at me. I looked everywhere, nothing. But I felt something moving in my pocket. I put my hand on it and I felt like a cold hand going out. I started panic but it was dark, I couldn't see anything. I looked in my pocket and my map were gone. So I were lost, without any way to return back to the hotel or call someone because internet wasn't working and a thing was turning around me without I could see it. 

It could feel it's cold caress on my skin, hear it's whispers and gasping that were freezing me without I could understand, smell the scent and the taste of rotten blood but all I was seeing is a deep dark that were like tinted by a pale red filter. So I lighted my phone, turned it in front of me and what I saw petrified me. I first saw it's body, a slim body that were covered in a white dress dirty of blood. Then I saw its hands, it's arms, slim as the rest of the body, and white as the frees that wasn't covering it, white as the death. I saw it's long black hair dirty and sticky of blood and rot, and it's nails, no it's claws, black of rot. And I saw the face. No nose, just two little slots on the middle of the face. No eyes, just holes with a milky white things pressed at the back. And not only two, or it's not fun, right ? Two big holes at the space of the eyes, and multiple other ones everywhere. And the smile. A smile like the ones that hauts your worst nightmares, a smile that isn't even natural, a smile that is even not of joy, it a smile of dementia, the smile of the ones that just want to devour you by the worst of ways, just to see you cry your blood , even not. It is just hungry, hungry of you. 

I screamed. I ran. I didn't even care where I was going, I just ran the furthest away from that thing. I saw a little wooden house, I just ran in without thinking. I closed the door, I breathed a little, but the thing that I saw after was even worse. There were shelves with jars, many jars. I thought it was food, so I just opened one, and a terrible smell of rot entered my nose. I looked inside, there were hands. Human hands. I was disgusted, I tried to close it, but one of the hands grabbed the edge. It was alive, all the hands inside were alive. They were shaking by spasms, and one of them jumped and grabbed my arm. I screamed, I threw the jar, the hand fell, the liquid with all the others spilled out, the hands shaked, I looked around. All the jars were filled with human body parts, hands, feets, ears, mouths and eyes. All alive. The eyes were looking me, the mouths were biting each other, everything was moving. I screamed, I ran to the back of the house, I found a cauldron and I tried to vomit. 

But in the cauldron, there were the remainder of living things, mixed together in filthy sludge where I still could distinguish a hand, a mouth, an eye... And it was alive, that thing was moving and the eyes were still trying to blink. I tried to ran off the house, the the door was blocked. After that, everything I remember was flashes of memories. I fall, the shelves fell and everything escaped, the feeling of a liquid on my face, a jar broke on my face, the thing entering, the smile, everything became dark. 

But now I'm still alive, I don't remember how I escaped or the travel to come back home, everything looks normal... But I feel something bad happened this night, and that the thing... Is always near me...
