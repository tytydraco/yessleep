Hi Reddit!

I’ve never made a post like this before, but I’ve been having a couple of problems at my job. For some background I’ve been working the night shift at this “24/7” (well, its actually more like 22/5) car dealership. I know that's kind of weird, but we’ve had a lot of management changes recently. There have been 6 site managers in the last 3 years, each of them has their own ‘quirks’ that they like to bring with them.

Just to illustrate what I mean: 2 bosses ago they put these little cartoon mascots all over the display room, 3 bosses ago they replaced all the phones with walkie-talkies, 5 bosses ago they started only stocking white tires (“it's cleaner”), and 6 bosses ago, that's when they started the night shift.

Initially I wasn’t too interested, but they told us that the night shift came with a five dollar pay increase, me and my friend jumped right on that! It was great at the start, but eventually my friend finished his degree and moved out of the country. At some point I guess they lost track of the fact that you need 2 people on the night shift and just never replaced him, even though I kept asking.

So that's one problem, and it was 2 bosses ago. Since then I’ve been too afraid to make waves, I stopped going to employee meetings, I stopped asking questions, I kind of need the money.

Anyway, that's not really my question, but to ask it, first I must give you yet more backstory. So without my friend I’m kind of alone at the dealership, which honestly has been fine. I get maybe 1 to 2 customers a week, it's usually someone who for whatever reason needs a car somewhat urgently, these interactions don't last more than 50 minutes at the longest. I’ve had a couple of ‘sketchier’ people come by, sweaty, jittery, trying to pay with cash, but honestly they don't care about you, they're just focused on what they want.

But. Something changed about 2 months ago. A man walked into the showroom. He looked completely average, a white man, mid 50s with neatly combed greying hair, and a matching greying moustache. He was dressed in a neat dress shirt and a blue cardigan. His voice was warm and polite, “Do you mind if I browse the lot?” I said, “feel free, do you need any help?” “I think I’ll be alright, thank you.”

He walked the lot for around 20 minutes before leaving. Not that strange, people do it all the time at a car lot, normally people don't ask to look around, but I think the darkness makes them feel like they should. Every day for the next week, he came back to the lot. He looked at cars, kicking their tires, knocking on the windows, feeling for scratches. He didn’t come into the showroom often, just picked up some brochures on his way out.

Eventually, maybe after a week and a half, I decided to leave the showroom and talk to him, maybe coax him into a sale. The lot at night has always made me a bit nervous, especially with some of the customers we get, but I try to push through it.

I walked into the lot, in the light of the lot’s overhead flood-lamps I saw him crouching beside the tires of a 2024 Toyota Camry SE in Predawn Gray (with a black SofTex interior). “Hello sir, can I help you with anything, I’ve noticed you here a few times, is there anything I can clear up?”

The man jumped a bit, he was seemingly surprised that someone would be there. For some reason his reaction made me feel calmer, he seemed utterly normal. “Oh, no I’m just browsing,” he replied, “If I need to leave, that's fine, I just like looking at the cars.”

At this point, I wasn’t really surprised by the response, “Oh that's perfectly fine, please let me know if there's anything you need, the showroom is always open.” I smiled an ironic smile, most of the customers get that the job isn’t great. “Well, if it gets boring in there, you feel free to come out and see me,” he seemed to realize what I meant, returning with a pitying smile.

After that night I continued to see him in the lot, it wasn’t until a few days later when I decided to take him up on the offer. For the next few weeks we walked the lot together for the 45 or so minutes that he tended to stay. He told me about his job (manager of a cardboard distribution hub) his family life (a wife, two kids, and a pet dog), his antique engraved rice collection, all pretty normal stuff.

I always got the impression that he was a little unsatisfied, wanted a better job, kids that listened to him, more rice probably. After those couple weeks he started to joke that I was his ‘second family.’ I know that's weird but, it's just hard to explain how that environment makes you feel. You’re so entirely alone that any human connection in those 8 hours is more meaningful than anything else the rest of the day.

Things were great, for about a month, he started bringing me lunches, just a sandwich, or a bag of chips, or he’d show me funny pictures on his phone, just stuff, friend stuff.

Then one day another customer came in mid way through his visit, a tall skinny man with an oversized hoodie, sweaty, greasy blonde hair and a stressed expression, “Hey, I need a car.” My new friend looked uncomfortable, “is this going to be a problem?” I told him it was fine, he looked at the greasy man, before leaving the dealership in a hurry.

The blonde man looked annoyed, “Hey, I need a car!” He just pointed at a car out the window and bought it on the spot, luckily not with cash. If you think thats weird take it up with my managers. When the transaction ended I looked out the window expecting to see my friend walking around the lot, but he was gone.

I heard a loud crack on the window and almost fell from my chair. It was the blonde man waving his keys at me, pounding on the window, “This white tire shit man, this is tight, clean as hell!” I like interactions like that, they're kind of nice.

The next day my friend came back, he didn't come into the showroom, just walking around the lot, kicking tires, on retrospect, harder than normal. I decided to see what he was up to and went out to see him, and noticed a quiet, tense expression on his face. I asked him if anything was wrong, “Hi, -friend-, how are you?”

He didn't say anything, just stood there facing the car, but in the low light I could see his eyes were looking at me in the reflection of the window. “Uhhh… hello, are you okay?”

He stood there for another second, his thick eyebrows furrowing in the window, then suddenly turned around, a bright smile on his face, “Oh, don’t worry about me, I’m doing perfectly fine!” “Sorry, I just had a long day, you know how it is, I’m sure.”

The rest of the night was fine, we talked a little bit about the cars, nothing deeper than that. He stayed shorter than usual that night, maybe 15 minutes. Thinking back, I think he was wearing the same clothes as the day before.

The next two days were my days off, nothing happened.

There’s about an hour when the dealership is completely closed, and the lot is left completely unattended during the transition between shifts. I came in a bit earlier than usual during that time to drop off my stuff and walk to a nearby coffee shop (that I heard about reddit actually). I parked my car at the back of the dealership, and started walking around to the front.

Just as I was about to turn the corner I noticed a man standing in front of the doors exactly how- sorry I can’t call him my friend anymore, let's just call him “Harry.” Harry was standing in front of the store just as he had the previous night, just staring.

Something about it just freaked me out. Maybe it was the fact that it wasn’t quite dark yet, and I was seeing him in nearly normal lighting, but it's just not right to see someone like that. I didn’t want him to know I saw him like that, so instead of going to the coffee shop I returned to the back of the store and went into the dealership through the back door.

The sense of danger hadn’t fully set in, I started thinking about how nice he had been, maybe he just needed someone to talk to. I slowly walked into the room, making sure to obviously turn on lights as I did. By the time I reached the show room he was no longer standing in front of the door, instead, he was examining the hood of a car just outside of the dealership. I walked up to the front doors and unlocked them.

He whipped around to look at the door, before just as suddenly returning to the hood of the car. He stayed there for a few minutes as I set up the computer system and clocked in. I think he was trying to avoid looking too eager.

After a few minutes he came into the showroom carrying a paper bag and a cup of coffee, “Hi again, sorry about how I was acting last time, I hope I didn’t freak you out or anything.” He looked the same as ever, maybe nicer than he normally did with a fresh hair cut, cleanly shaved, and a strong smell of cologne.

“Oh, no worries Harry, I completely understand.”

He smiled, a broad smile, eyes wide, “I knew you would understand, you always understand.” “Look, I have something to ask you, but first, here I brought you lunch!”

I tried to smile, but clearly it didn’t look right. He continued, “Why don’t you eat that as I tell you about my week, and don’t worry, the food is fresh, I just bought it.” I instinctively reached out and grabbed the food as he held it out to me before opening it.

“Yeah I got the food from that new coffee shop, I know you wanted to try it.”

I really hate this part, I don’t know how he knew it was me. I couldn’t have told him that, I only found out about it on my day off, all I did was reply to a comment online about it. In the moment it didn't register, “Wow thank you so much! Yeah I was actually just about to head over there!”

He looked excited as a I went to take a sip, almost too excited. As I went to set the cup down he looked disappointed, “Oh, is it too hot? Well let's just talk for a minute, you can eat the sandwich.”

He continued, “I’ve been having some problems with my family lately, they just don’t get it, they aren’t what I need, they aren’t perfect, not like you…”

I stopped rummaging in the paper bag, “I… what?”

He ignored what I said, “You’re what I need, and I’m what you need, we’re the real family!” He was sweating now, the beads running down from his hair, his voice got louder, “They had to go, you understand right, they would have stopped us!”

I fully pulled back at this point but I couldn’t move, I felt totally trapped in the building. At that moment a woman had begun walking up to door, Harry saw where I was looking and practically sprinted over to the door to lock it, “Sorry ma’am, we’re closed right now!”

I didn't see what happened to her, but I guess she left. As he ran over to the door, I ran through the building to the back door. I could hear him stomping after me, “WHAT’S WRONG, WHAT DID I DO - IS IT THAT MAN - DID HE -.”

I ran out the door, the outside now dark with the exception of the street lights. Rather than trying to climb the fence behind the dealership I sprinted into the lot, hiding behind a standee of Chip the living tire.

I heard the door slam open, and heavy breathing as he ran into the lot. He wasn’t yelling anymore, clearly realizing that it would draw attention. I saw his feet as he walked by, he wasn't trying to hide his presence, as he walked through the rows of cars I could hear him whispering, "Im sorry if I scared you, I was just worried, you shouldn’t talk to him, that, that sweaty disgusting man, he made me realize what I had to do. For us!…"

He walked further away, and I couldn't hear him anymore just his heavy footsteps as he walked through the lot. Once I thought he was far enough I went to pull out my phone, before realizing it was still in the building. I did however have my management assigned walkie talkie which was completely useless in this situation.

I decided my best shot was to run. I ran for it, towards the road, as fast as I could. He didn't bother trying to hide anymore, he sprinted at me, faster than I would have thought a man like him could.

He caught up to me, shouldering me against a 2025 Ram 1500 Rebel with the Twin Turbo Hurricane Engine (420 horsepower and 469 lb-ft of torque). He grabbed my arm, strength equally as surprising. I could see tears in his eyes as he tightened his grip, he almost looked afraid, "Please, I can't lose you, don't you know what I've done to be with you, you can't take that back."

I have never felt more afraid than in that moment, I did everything I could to get away from him. I flailed my entire body, scratching him in the face, kicking him wherever I could, and yelling as loud as humanly possible, "HELP ME, PLEASE SOMEONE, IF YOU-"

He pushed me to the ground, I didn't stop yelling. He started again, his now bleeding face covered in an expression of intense anger, “WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS TO ME, YOU LOVE ME, my family they didn-“

I returned the favour, kicking his knee as hard as I physically could. He buckled under the blow, and fell to the ground whimpering.

I ran, just ran as long as I could, eventually I reached a convenience store where I was able to call the police. They arrived within a few minutes. They tell me Harry was still there, on the ground, whimpering.

Anyway, sorry for going into so much detail but this whole experience has really put me off of selling cars. I'm wondering, should I maybe find a new job, or ask for a raise, I think I'm willing to risk losing the job at this point. Let me know what you guys think about my situation, or if you've had any similar experiences asking your boss for a raise.
