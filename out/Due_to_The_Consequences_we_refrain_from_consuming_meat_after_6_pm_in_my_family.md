My family has a practice of refraining from consuming meat after 6 pm due to The Consequence. Initially, I assumed this was a widespread norm, a basic principle adhered to by other families. However, upon moving out, I realized how uncommon this practice was. Other families didn't follow what I considered a fundamental dietary guideline, unique to my family's belief in The Consequence.  
For almost two decades, I strictly avoided eating meat after 6 pm, irrespective of cravings or leftover portions on my plate. Whether I had to discard the remaining food, resulting in significant wastage, or store it in a Tupperware container for the next day, The Consequence dictated our actions.  
Despite my efforts to come home early for dinner, school and extracurricular activities often made it challenging. I recall an incident where, after hosting an afterschool club session and receiving a text from my father at 5:47 pm stating all meat had been bundled up, I arrived home disappointed but accustomed to the routine. The fear of The Consequence shaped our lives.  
Due to its integral role in my family, I never discussed this topic with friends. Much like not mentioning mundane habits, such as putting dishes in the sink, our no-meat-after-six rule seemed unremarkable. While it may seem like a peculiar yet harmless restriction, The Consequence, with its bizarre and grim nature, made the entire practice unforgivable.  
I shared this unique aspect of my life with my girlfriend, and when she discovered I still adhered to it, she left me, labeling me a lunatic. Her departure, taking her belongings and cookware, left me emotionally drained. In the aftermath, I resorted to a simple dinner of a Hot Pocket and air-fried chicken tenders, feeling physically and emotionally exhausted.  
In a moment of heartbreak, I confided in my cousin during a drive home. Unbeknownst to me, he informed my parents, who visited me upon hearing the news. Unaware of the time, I offered them chicken tenders while consuming my meal, only realizing my mistake when my mother's expression changed. The clock, a reminder of The Consequence, triggered a series of shocking events.  
My parents' reactions ranged from sympathy to horror as they discovered my violation of the no-meat-after-six rule. My attempt to apologize was met with a heavy silence. Suddenly, anxiety overwhelmed me, distorting my perception and triggering a surreal physical transformation.  
My parents witnessed my body disintegrating until only my skeleton remained. In a chilling sequence, my remains were collected, discarded, and ground in the garbage disposal. My father, with a heavy heart, used a toolbox to affix me to the table using nails, recreating a form of crucifixion. As my body regenerated, the pain was excruciating, and an unspeakable urge emerged.  
After my parents left, I endured the agony of removing the nails, haunted by the horrifying consequences of my actions. The narrative concludes with the revelation that The Consequence stems from a centuries-old curse inflicted upon an ancestor who committed cannibalistic acts. The family is bound by this curse, transforming into ravenous fiends if they consume meat after 6 pm, enduring a period of starvation before regaining humanity. The story ends with a haunting realization that The Consequence is not to be overlooked or underestimated.
