Right, so I've been behind the bar at Le Petit for five years now. Usually dead normal - footie on the telly, regulars nursing their pints, that sort of thing. Just your average local pub in Lansnat, nothing special. But last night? Bloody hell, something wasn't right.



This bloke walks in, and I'm not on about your average city worker. Proper posh, he was - expensive black suit that probably cost more than I make in a year, gold-rimmed specs catching the light just so, perfectly trimmed silver beard, even had this fancy ebony cane. The whole pub just went quiet, innit? The way he moved, like he owned the place but didn't care to mention it. Gave me proper shivers, it did.



Had the usual lot in - Thomas from the building site next door (always goes on about his missus), Professor Clark in his tatty plaid shirt (desperately needs new kit, that one), some uni lads getting rowdy over the match. But Shimura? Bloody hell, he was acting well strange. Never seen him hit the whisky like that before. Poor sod was sweating buckets, eyes darting about like he'd seen a ghost, clutching this briefcase under his table like it was made of gold.



Got this young couple in the corner booth too - you know the type, couldn't keep their hands to themselves. Proper loved up, they were. Girl in a nice dress, bloke in what looked like uni gear. Standard night, yeah?



Then it got proper weird. Around midnight, it went bloody freezing. Not your normal November chill - I mean properly arctic. The windows actually frosted over, and I'm not being dramatic. Checked the thermostat three times, all normal. Then the jazz cuts out - we always have jazz playing, bit of atmosphere and all that - and in that silence... Christ, I don't even want to write what I thought I heard. Like whispers, but not quite human, if you know what I mean.



Shimura was having a right mare by this point. Shaking so bad he could barely hold his glass, kept muttering to himself. At one point, he reached into that briefcase and just... stopped. Like someone grabbed his hand. But there wasn't anyone near him, was there? His face went white as a sheet, and I swear I saw tears in his eyes.



The couple stumbled out around half twelve, absolutely plastered. The posh bloke left right after them, didn't even finish his martini. Just stood up, gave me this look that made my blood run cold, and walked out smooth as you like. Shimura hung about till almost closing, still shaking like autumn leaves.



This morning? Police everywhere in Nightdew Gardens, just down the road. Yellow tape, the lot. Keep thinking about that strange cold, those whispers, the way that posh bloke was watching everyone... 



Got the CCTV from last night. Haven't looked at it yet. If I'm honest? Proper scared to. The way things felt last night, like something was watching, waiting... Don't know if I want to see what the cameras caught.



Edit: Bloody hell. Just saw the news. Two bodies found in Nightdew Gardens. Young couple, they're saying. Think I know who they were. Should I tell the police about last night? About the posh bloke and Shimura? About those whispers?



I keep hearing them now, even when I'm alone. Those bloody whispers...
