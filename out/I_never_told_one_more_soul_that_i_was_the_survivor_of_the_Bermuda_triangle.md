“ Yes! Yes ! No more 9-5 for a month, I am finally on vacation!” I screamed with the lottery ticket in his hand. My life had been hard for the past 3 years as l lost my job of being a real estate agent due to the housing market that crashed. That trip to the Bahamas was exactly the only best thing at the moment. I excitedly came to my brother’s home, Thomas, where I was staying at the moment to break the good news.   
Thomas looked concerned.   
“ I’ve never been this lucky oh lord !” I was still elated.  
“ Are you sure this is legitimate bro…The route will go through the Bermuda triangle. Don’t you hear enough rumors about that creaking place, people never came back once they entered ?!” Thomas raised his voice.  
“ So what? It’s once in a lifetime. I'm not missing this, and who cares about rumors anyway. Don’t you dare to ruin this only exciting event left”   
And like that, I went to my room to pack things up since the following day was the trip.   
The day started off clear, I was relieved to see other passengers on the small ferry too .“Putt-putt-putt…” The engine roared as it went on. Finally there I was, going to the Bahamas on a sunny day with clear water at the bay of Fort Lauderdale. An hour and a half past, everything was still fine, I thought it wasn’t as bad as imagined-  
“ Cre-ee-e–e BOOM!” the ferry hit something and water started leaking in furiously.  
“ Every passenger stay calm, our crew can fix this small problem” the captain shouted.  
“ Why are you not driving the ferry ?? To make it even worse there are only two crew members here.” another man exclaimed.  
I instantly felt panicked, maybe Thomas was right, I was never going to get out of this devilish place. That was when everything went dark.   
The sound of waves woke me up. It was weird that my body was not aching because of the crash. The other passengers were there, only the captain and crew were not seen. I went to look around with Tim and Benji, whose name I just learned, leaving the other people to stay at one place for safety. It was an island with pine forests which was peculiar. It was similar to the Pacific northwest ranges with a sketchy wood house. We got into the house to see a board of information about the civilians that had gone missing in the ocean. Right then two men with uniforms barged in.  
“ You guys must be the passengers on the vacation cruise deported at Lauderdale” one man informed “ Please follow us we have already brought the rest of you to a small woodcamp”  
As the night fell, the our group raised suspicions.  
“ Maybe they’re just seaguards finding missing victims as part of the US government !” a woman suggested  
“ It wouldn’t fit the vibe of this eerie place, something is off” Tim lowered his voice.  
While the discussion was still going on, I stood up and went for a walk outside. Being lost on an island was already too much for me. As I walked by the guards fireplace, I heard them talking to each other.
