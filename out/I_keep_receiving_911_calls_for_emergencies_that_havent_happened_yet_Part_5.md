Once the bedlam from the fire alarm died down, Bianca took me back into the building. She spoke to some of the security personal and I was escorted into one of the restricted sections. She turned back to me with a look of obvious anxiety,

“We need to go to my office; it will be safe there to discuss what I think is happening. After we do that though.” She paused making sure she had my attention.

“We will need to bring this matter to the foundation directors. The situation is a potential danger to the entire establishment and all the personal associated with it, as well as who knows how many others.” I nodded my head, not wanting to force her to speak more on the matter until we were in a secure setting. Though I was anxious to learn what she knew about what the hell was going on.

I did not have to wait too long. We walked through a network of halls leading further in. The halls gave way to a secure, bunker-like wing of the facility. Entering an enormous security door I had to do a double take as we passed by several arrays of odd-looking technology in the background. I was about to ask Bianca what they were but as I looked at her,  she seemed to be getting more nervous as we moved on. We suddenly veered left and a small door was visible with the number twelve on it. She swiped a key-card she had in her coat and an electronic lock disengaged and we moved into a small office with thick dull gray walls and minimal decorations. A desk, computer and various books lay strewn among the surface of a plain metal desk and Bianca gestured for me to sit in the chair opposite hers.  I obliged and as soon as I sat down, she had had pen and paper in hand and ready to take notes on whatever we discussed presumably.

I was about to ask her what was really going on, when she asked the first question.

“Where did you find the device? I mean the phone; was it acquired recently?”

“Well, I didn't find it, it's my phone, I dropped it down a small flight of stairs near my work. It broke of course and after breaking it started doing this, but what exactly.....” She cut me off again and started in with another barrage of questions.

“Are you able to use it to send any message or call? Do any other functions remain? How many calls have you received? How many messages from this M person?” I was starting to get frustrated,

“Hey I thought you were going to be telling me what happened? I already told you what I know, I don’t know how this works. I have been receiving these calls for a few days and in each case, there has been a call for help to emergency services that somehow comes to my phone. It is always about something exactly twenty-four hours before it happens and I have tried to stop almost all of them. Now if you don’t mind, would you tell me who the hell you think M is?” She looked down at her papers and back at me with a plaintive sigh as if she was not sure if she should humor me in things I would not understand. I tried not to take offense to it, but she was getting more and more impatient with me as we went on.

“I'm sorry I got carried away, I know you must want answers. It is just that this situation is very sensitive and well."

She paused again, her impatience giving way to that same concerned look from earlier.

"You must understand that what I can tell you is limited, many things are strictly confidential and what I do tell you must never leave this building.” I nodded my head again and she continued,

“Good, well as I stated before this foundation has been researching radical new technologies that would revolutionize and change the world as we know it. One of the most significant projects under our purview was Project Echo. This initiative was led by one of our best, a brilliant man named Doctor Rolland Merrick.  Merrick was not only the director of Project Echo but the mastermind behind the research involved in its inception. This project was an attempt to successfully send an object back in time using a tachyon transmitter. Merrick was a genius in the field of temporal research and experimentation. This project of his had even reached the point where the experiments involving the proposed goal of transporting objects forward or backward through time were becoming genuinely possible. All that was left was a practical test of the device, but,”

She trailed off, her tone shifting from one of admiration to tragic concern while she continued,

“There was a terrible accident that occurred during the first fateful attempt. An energy spike threatened to destroy the project and set us back years in our efforts. Doctor Merrick broke the safety quarantine in an effort to shut it down and save the device, save his life's work. It was too late however and Doctor Merrick ended up being wholly disintegrated on an atomic level, along with the devices he was carrying. We continued following up on his project, but he has been dead as far as we knew for over a year. At least it seemed he was until now. Considering this mysterious attacker who is able to predict things before they happen and is targeting foundation members, along with leaving the initial M in a message, well it suggests an outcome we did not expect.”

I could not believe the insane tale that was being told to me, secret time travel research? This was crazy stuff. Yet it was hard not to try and believe some of it, considering what I had experienced so far. How else was my broken phone receiving calls from the future. But that begged the question,

“Why am I able to receive the calls though? And how or why is this dead scientist returned from beyond, contacting me after my efforts to prevent disasters that he might very well be orchestrating?” She looked at me and then her notes and responded,

“That is the question. Remarkably it seems he is not dead, but actually made it back through time in a very corporeal way. Why he has contacted you I am not sure.” I considered her answer, but was still very confused on one detail in particular, M’s motive.

“If he is back, why would he be trying to kill you all? Shouldn't he be trying to get in contact and share his discovery and not murder the faculty?” She seemed caught off guard by my question and looked away to her papers while giving me a dismissive sounding,

“I don’t know why he would wish to kill his former coworkers, perhaps the process of phasing between time has damaged his mind and he is lashing out at the people who he can remember. Maybe he blames the foundation for letting it happen to him in the first place, I don’t know.” The explanation did not sound authentic and I felt like she was holding something back. I did not push the subject but I knew there was more to M, or I should say Merrick and his motivations.

“Now that you have your answers, I am going to need you to come with me and speak to the board and see what they think we should do.”

“Alright but what else do you need from me?” I asked feeling more uncomfortable as I sat there, not knowing what was going to happen to me or what M might try to do next.

“We just need to see what the board suggests we do now that the facility might be compromised. This is a serious situation and it has been shown that you are not entirely safe either, despite his attempts at communicating with you.”

We left Bianca's office and walked down a corridor to a large ante chamber that looked more like a military command and control center. There were armed guard and scientists everywhere. Cables snaked in every direction and the thrum of energy could practically be felt in the room upon entering.

Several scientists sat around a table discussing and murmuring things to each other and Bianca approached them slowly.

“Directors, I apologize for the suddenness of this meeting but we have a serious situation.” She paused briefly, waiting for the entire group of members at the table to turn their attention to her.

“I have uncovered evidence that suggests that Doctor Merrick is still alive and worse he has come back here and made contact with a temporal anomaly. He seems to be contacting someone through the anomaly and is trying to kill faculty members.” There was a mixture of gasps, dismissive chuckles and stern grunts at the collected board members digested the news they had received.

A tall man sitting at the head of the table held up a hand and the rest of them quieted down.

“If Merrick has come back somehow and his memory is intact, he will have remembered what happened. He is likely already plotting some kind of revenge on all of the members of project Echo, which led to his unfortunate accident. It is also likely he was responsible for Calvin and Michael s deaths. Put the facility on high alert and we need to do something about this madman.”

I heard the names spoken and remembered the first two victims. I knew they worked here, but did both men work on this project Echo? What did they do to Merrick besides failing to save him from getting zapped by a machine?

Another voice chimed in,

“What about the anomaly you mentioned, is it still intact and still here?”

Bianca paused a moment looking uncomfortable and then pointed to me. I held up my hands and started to panic, what were they going to do to me?

“No wait I don’t know what you all think I am, but I did not sign up for any of this. I just broke my phone and was trying to get a new one from the store before I got the first of those weird calls." I pulled out the phone and everyone took a step back like I had just drawn a gun on them. There was a high pitched beeping from one of the machines nearby and an attendant looked at the screen and then back at me and his jaw dropped. They clearly knew something about this thing that I didn't. I had to take a chance to try and get out of the situation so I told them,

"If I give you guys this broken phone can I leave? It sounds like you need it and not me.”

There were murmurs and whispered conversations and when most of their heads began shaking in  disapproval, I knew I was in trouble. Bianca spoke again,

“It would be best if you gave us the device and came with us to a holding cell. If Merrick is going to contact you again, we need to know. He might only talk to you and we need to find him, track him and stop him. So, you are going to need to come with us.” She said it all with a pained expression of resignation. Clearly not wanting to have me taken into custody, but not being able to go against the directors orders.

“Wait, hold me? No way. You don’t have the right to detain me, I haven't done anything wrong and you are a God damn research facility. you are not the government.....are you?”

My rant was met by stony faces and no answer to my question. My heart sank and I realized that these people were serious.

“I don’t understand this. You are saying there's some time manipulating madman trying to kill everyone here and you want to lock me up, and take away the only device that has given me an edge?” I was getting more scared and confused by the moment. This turn around and Bianca’s betrayal of trust was especially painful. Though in the end she did not have too much of a choice. As the guards moved in I kept speaking to try and convince them.

“What are you going to do about him? Why is he really trying to kill you all?” The director stood up and brushed off his coat and responded with a dismissive,

“I’m afraid the rest is classified, get this man out of here and confiscate the device. We will need to run some tests on it, if Merrick calls bring it back to him and put both of them in the tracking room.” Several guards moved towards me. I was about to be taken away when the phone vibrated and I pulled it out to look at the screen, now come to life. The security personal backed away at the urging of the scientists since they did not want the device damaged, which I found ironic since I broke the thing already and that’s what started this mess.

The director spoke again, more concerned with the phone than anything else,

“What does it say?” He asked with genuine interest. I read the message but did not say anything out loud. It just said,

“Duck!”

On instinct I followed the command and grabbed Bianca’s arm and pulled her down as well. We both hit the floor and a large structural beam crashed down and swung into the room, smashing into all of the guards and several scientists. It missed the board members by inches and we only narrowly avoided being crushed by abiding the warning from the message.

The director at the head of the table stood up and shouted,

“Arrest that man and get that phone!” I heard guards mobilizing nearby and I did not need any more prompting from there, I ran. Bianca considered following for a moment, then held on to my hand as if considering restraining me. She ended up letting go with a look of sad resignation and muttered the words,

“Go, quick.”

I started sprinting down the main hall and was about to run headlong into a group of guards when my phone messaged me again and said,

“Stop! Down to the ground!” Once again, I followed the instruction. As the guard charged in to seize me, a panel on the wall exploded and a current or electrical energy bolted through all the guards and violently electrocuted them until they lay on the ground smoldering. The smell of burning skin and ozone was horrifying and I checked myself to find I was somehow unharmed.

I managed to get away down a random technical corridor. I could not see anyone but they were closing in by the sounds of footsteps. I ducked into a supply room to hide. As I huddled in the corner, I could not believe it when my phone started ringing again. It was a particularly bad time for a call but I answered it all the same.

It sounded incredibly distorted and I could barely hear through all the static,

“Hello 911? I would like to report an emergency.” I got out my notepad and got ready, but I heard another static burst.

"Did you want to know?"

“Come again? Did I want to know what? What happened? Is someone injured?” The voice continued and an awful static squelch almost deafened me.

“Just kidding, you really are the real deal, running for your life but still takes a call to try and help someone. Anyway, did you want to know what really happened?” The voice altered again and I realized it was mostly likely M that I was speaking with,

“I am just calling to say, it's not twenty-four hours this time, these people are going to die. My wife and children, myself we all die due to their negligence. If you do exactly what I tell you, you can hear the other side of the story. Then you will have to decide if they are worth saving. You have no idea what they have done, or worse what they will do. The emergency this time, is that the Hope for the Future main research building has a device that contains such an prodigious amount of energy that if overloaded could obliterate this facility and a surrounding four to five miles. It is going to explode and there's nothing those murdering, brainwashing, immoral maniacs can do about it this time. I will get you out of there and you will have three options. Use the next hour to get as far away as possible and save yourself, which I doubt you will pick.” I heard a static laden chuckle that hurt my ear.

“Second option. You can meet me at the observation tower outside building two. There I can tell you the real truth of what happened and you can decide what you will do on their behalf. Third option you can listen to their lies, try and stop me and fail. Or worse go willingly into their custody and they can proceed to disavow knowledge you were ever here while they experiment on you and you find some horrible way to die in their custody not knowing why you ever tried to save them.

I know you will make the right choice, I have faith, do you?”

Before I could say a word in response the line went dead and I was left with an impossible task. I had to stop him from killing all these people. Despite their attempts at abducting me, they did not deserve to die in a fiery explosion, especially not Bianca. Though I did not exactly trust them either and M had said something about them killing his family and others. There were enough serious accusations and evidence to give me pause in trusting either the foundation or M. Though I could not help but consider, what did he know? I had to make a decision one way or the other, time was running out.
