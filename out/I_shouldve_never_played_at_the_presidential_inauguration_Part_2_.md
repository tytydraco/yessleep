We rolled up to D.C, after what felt like a bllion hours on the bus, hearing all those screams from nowhere, other band kids chatting, and all of them snoring. I barely got any sleep. And what was even worse was that the drive was hours, and my phone kept glitching out every two seconds, so all I could do for entertainment was look at the outdoors and shit. I was enthusiastic now that I was off the bus, as we started getting our instruments and started to head to where the inauguration was held.

But Mr. John, instead of heading to the inauguration, instead walked us to a room. He told us to take a seat for us to rehearse. We warmed up and started playing. But what sounds came out didn’t sound like the star spangled banner, not even close to it. It was just a ton of squeaks and random notes. Mr. John was obviously furious, so he told us to stop playing and gave us a lecture, saying that if we didn’t play good we would be embarrassed on TV and we would forever go down as one of the worst bands at inauguration. So he told us to play again.

But just as we started playing another sax player, named Tom, shouted something. 

“My reeds broken!” And that was enough to tell him to not play at the inauguration, as Mr. John didn’t have any spare reeds, so he told him to go back on the bus, and you could hear that Tom was obviously sad and even started crying. From there Mr. John told us to play again, and for the first 15 measures we sounded good, but on measure 16, it just went silent, no sounds of music would come out, just dead silence.

I tried to play, but for some reason I couldn’t. It refused to let my sticks hit my drum. It was like dark magic stopping me. Mr. John was furious as we weren’t playing. So he asked why. We responded that we were blowing, just no sound was coming out. So Mr. John then had to check if our instruments were broken. He grabbed each instrument and started checking them. 

He noticed that all the instruments had broken keys, valves, and other stuff broken. Fortunately he had spare parts so he was able to fix them. Then our instruments could make sound again. But for some reason that weird force was still preventing my drumsticks to hit the drum pad. But it was too late as we started playing. Mr. John realized percussion wasn’t playing, so he asked why. 

“Our sticks aren’t hitting our instruments!” We shouted.

“Very funny, NOW PLAY!” Mr. John was obviously furious. We tried to explain that was the truth, but no. So we resorted to using our hands to hit the instruments, it sounded like crap, but atleast we were playing. But while playing, I saw a small piece of silver eject from a key on a clarinet, and it hit Mr. John in the face. It then started to bleed.

Mr. John shouted even louder than the Krakatoa eruption, and that single piece of metal was enough to lose a fuckton of blood. He did bring a first aid kit in case someone got injured, so he washed out the wound in the bathroom and put on a bandage. But even that injury didn’t stop him, as he still made us rehearse. And after the end of the rehearsals, we went out to play for the inauguration.

But as soon as we hit the first note, all of our instruments shattered, just like that, our instruments were gone. Mr. John looked very embarrassed as well as the president and vice president elect, they looked shocked. And instead of us being shocked on what just happened, too, we just broke down in tears. We were on live TV, not to mention. And also everyone started to boo us. Eventually they ended up getting the marine band to preform the anthem, as Mr. John furiously escorted us back to the bus. Looking more furious than ever.

But when we got on the bus, the driver was just sitting in a pool of blood, with a knife in his stomach. Mr. John went from furious to scared. As we continued to enter the bus it just kept getting darker, until we saw two glowing eyes at the end of the hall. And as the figure approached us, it was one of our classmates, Tom. But both of his eyes were gone and now they were replaced with glowing eyes. It seemed like he was possessed by some monster. And in his hand, a knife. We ran away, in fear, as he started to chase us.

Even though I could’ve sworn it was noon when we entered, it now seemed like it was midnight, as the sun was gone. But it was a blur after that. I heard my classmates get horrifically murdered, while me, my friend Jake, Mr. John, and the person who Jake was dating, Emily, ran away with the monster chasing us. We ran for what seemed like hours, until we finally managed to lose the monster in the woods. But we long forgot the way back. So here we are, In the middle of the woods in Virginia with basically nothing, hiding from a monster.
