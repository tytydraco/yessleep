If you ever hear someone say, “Mr. Jones will come soon,” leave immediately.



“Hello, how are you settling in?” My neighbour asked me as she handed me freshly-baked cookies.



“Doing well, trying to get my stuff organized.”



“Just let me know if you need anything.”



“Thank you, I really appreciate it.”



“Have you had the chance to meet Mr. Jones?”



“No, I haven’t.”



“You really need to meet him. He is just amazing.”



“I’ll be happy to. Who is he?”



“Gotta get going. See you around, neighbour. You know where to find me.” 



“Strange,” I thought to myself.



On the drive to the supermarket, everyone waved at my car. Inside, people were saying hi, smiling. My mom said that small towns had their charm.



“Oh, a new face,” an old man said.



“Hi, I’m James.”



“Nice to meet you, James. I’m Daniel. Have you had the chance to meet Mr. Jones?”



“Um, no.”



“You really need to meet him. He is just amazing.”



“Who is this Mr. Jones?”



“You’ll see, son,” he said and walked away.



Did the man talk the same way as the woman did?



But all of the thoughts were gone when, to my left, I saw the most beautiful woman ever. She was tall with dark hair, dark eyes, and pale skin. Dressed in all black with black-painted fingernails. 



“Hi, I’m James,” I said as I walked closer to her.



“Hi, I’m Tania,” she said, and turned back to her groceries.



“Do you think I could take you to dinner sometime, Tania?”



“I don't know you, James.”



“I know, but I just got into town, and I’m trying to make friends.”



She stared at me suspiciously. 



“I’ll pay!”



“Hm, okay.”



She gave me her number and walked away.



I wanted to play it cool, but as soon as I got home, I texted Tania. To my surprise, she didn’t ghost me, and we set up a date on the weekend.



Over the next few days, I started noticing subtle references to this Mr. Jones. Many streets, squares, and buildings were either named after him or dedicated to him. The police department was even named after him. But no matter how much I looked online, I couldn't find a single mention of Mr. Jones.



It all seemed so strange. Was he even real?



Tania lived on the outskirts of the city, a strange little suburb with very few houses. Hers was the only one that looked inhabited.



“You want some music?” I asked when she got into my car.



“Sure.”



I played a playlist I created for her.



“Oh, I wouldn’t think of you as a Sisters of Mercy fan,” she said, smiling.



“Really, why?”



“You look a little too square, James.”



“Hey!” I said and laughed.



“My dad actually got me into this music,” she said.



“Does he live here too?”



“Not anymore, he passed away.”



“I’m really sorry.”



“It’s okay. It’s been a while.”



When we came to a restaurant, I could see some familiar faces sitting around. The people all looked my way, happy to see me, waving until they saw Tania. 



Their faces would change, and the familiar smile was gone. They would look down at the ground and barely greet me.



Tania didn’t seem moved a bit by their sudden hostility and kept joking and laughing.



Her fashion and makeup choices definitely made her stand out, but it seemed strange that it would cause such discomfort in these people.



“Did you do something to everyone in this town?” I asked jokingly.



“Haha, what do you mean?”



“They don’t seem happy to see you.”



“Oh no, people here are just squares like you. They hate how I dress and act, but their anger gives me joy. How have you been liking these people?”



“Yeah, I like them. Everyone is so friendly and nice. But I have this question I need to ask you.”



“What is it?”



“Who is Mr. Jones?”



Tania’s smile faded. She looked cold and serious.



Her reaction took me aback.



“Well, people take him as a patron. He’s been with this town since the first settlement. He helps the people here in many ways. Used to be mostly harvest, now he helps the business thrive. He comes by once in a while, and he does things. People think of him as a saint, but…” she looked around nervously.



“Wait, what do you mean? Has his family been here for a while? What does he take?”



She looked around nervously.



“Can we talk about something else, James?”



“Why, what’s wrong?”



“Please, James,” she begged.



“Okay.”



The server then came and took our orders. He shot Tania a disapproving look as he left.



“I really enjoyed talking with you, Tania.”



“Me too, James, you’re really sweet.”



“You’re really sweet too,” I said, looked into her eyes, and tried to grab her hand, but I accidentally grabbed her wrist.



Shit, I was never good at this.



She looked strangely at me for a second, but then moved my hand down to hers and smiled.



I had to try really hard not to blush all over.



“I wish we could talk more, Tania.”



“Me too,” she paused for a second. “Is it too early to invite you over?”



“No,” I said a little too quickly.



“But I only want to talk, is that okay, James?”



“Of course. Do you want to get some wine for the night too?”



“Sure.”



 A liquor store was on the way to Tania’s. She stayed in my car while I picked up the wine.



“Hi, James!” came up behind me. It was Daniel’s voice.



“Oh, hi, Daniel,” I said and turned around.



The sight of his face made me almost drop the bottle. He had two large black eyes and a torn lip that was freshly sewn up; more bruises stuck out from under his shirt.



“Jesus, Daniel, what happened to you?”



“Only good things happened. I see the wine. Are you celebrating that Mr. Jones blessed us with his presence again? He had already stopped by my place. I was one of the first,” he said and flashed a wide grin.



“Um, no, I’m going over to Tania.”



The smile was gone from his face. He looked me up and down.

  


“She’s no good, James. You shouldn’t be around her, especially when Mr. Jones comes. You seem like a good kid.”



“I think she’s just fine, but I’m not too sure about this Mr. Jones. Is he really that great?”



His eyes widened, and his mouth hung open. He stared at me for a second, then he narrowed his eyes back, looked me deep in the eyes, and nodded.



“You guys have a great evening tonight,” he said, patting me on the back as he walked away.



“Uhh, James got some Chardonnay. He knows what’s good,” Tania said and nodded as I got into the car.



“Um, ye…yeah.”



“Everything okay, James?”



I wanted to talk to Tania about what happened inside, but she seemed so startled the first time I asked about Mr. Jones. 



“Yes, all good. Let’s go to the party house!” I yelled out, making Tania laugh.



The wine didn’t taste the best, but Tania kept saying how much she liked it. It was very sweet of her to try to make me feel good about myself.



The conversation was flowing well, but I couldn’t shake off the strangeness of the interaction with Daniel.



“Everything okay, James? You seem a little off.”



“Yeah, it’s just. I hate to bring it up, but I met Daniel. He said some weird things about Mr. Jones and not to hang around you.”



Tania looked at me. Her lip started to tremble, and she began crying.



“You…you don’t understand, James. Mr. Jones is evil. He hurts you in such ways. People here think it's worth it, but it’s not. My father went against him and didn’t survive. All our family friends have shunned me. I have no one to ask for help…



“Why had nobody done anything?”



“You can’t! The money he’s brought them is more than their soul to them.”



“Okay, let’s leave then. We can leave together.”



“We can’t, James. We can’t. He won't let us!”



“What do you mean, I’ll get my car, and I’ll get us out of here tonight. You won’t have to…”



I didn’t even finish my sentence. Tania had started crying so much that she wasn’t listening anymore. I got up to get some tissues.



This was the night we would leave. I would have to get my laptop and everything, but that wouldn't take too long.



As I walked back, I heard faint hushing outside the window. When I looked out, I could swear I saw an outline of a face that slowly disappeared.



My heart started racing. I walked over to the couch and gave Tania the tissues.



As I reached for my phone, the door flew open.



Outside stood a pale white man with brown hair and brown eyes dressed in a white t-shirt and blue jeans. He was smiling from ear to ear, his teeth pearly white, looking like they were modeled from Play-Doh. His skin was shining, as if someone put a layer of oil on it. He wasn’t blinking; his pupils were small like pins.



He began making his way across the room. His pace was swift, taking long steps almost like an old cartoon character.



“Tania! I’ve heard you said mean things about Mr. Jones,” he said. His voice was high-pitched and loud.



Tania screamed and put her head into a pillow.



“Hey, stop!” I yelled and walked towards him.



“You’ll have your turn, James. Don’t rush!”



His words sent a shiver down my spine, but I continued towards him.



But then, from behind Mr. Jones, three men in uniform emerged. They immediately pushed me down and handcuffed me.



They held me down as Mr. Jones walked to Tania. She tried to punch him, scratch him, push him away, but he just stood there, smiling. He then full-force punched her in her face, knocking her unconscious.



“Stop, stop, what are you…” But one of the officers put his knee deep into my back, making me gasp for air.



Mr. Jones dragged Tania away to the bathroom and shut the door behind him. 



My whole body was shivering. I could feel tears rolling down my cheeks. 



“Now it’s your turn, James!” Mr. Jones said as he walked out.



The officers walked away from me and stood around in a circle watching.



I trashed myself around, trying to get up, but I was unable to. 



I prayed Mr. Jones would make it quick.



After Mr. Jones was done with me, the officers took me and drove me back home, putting me down on a couch.



“You’ll get used to it, James. You have no other choice,” one of them said as they left.



It took me a full day to even get up and walk around.



I’ve texted Tania numerous times since, but she hasn’t responded. I drove around to her place. The house looked abandoned from the outside. I stopped my car and walked to the front door. 



A single knock opened it. It was empty, no furniture, nothing inside, but it still had that coppery smell. I walked back to my car and cried for what felt like hours.



It pained me, but whatever happened to Tania, she was gone now. I decided to pack up my stuff too and leave this hellish place for good.



The sun had set when I decided to leave, but when I turned onto the road to leave the county, a police blockade stood there.



I barely managed to stop the car before going on the spike strips.



Blood froze in my veins. I wanted to reverse, but there was a police car behind me.



How long had it been following me?



A man came closer with a gun in his hand and motioned to roll down the window.



“Going somewhere, James? Don’t you remember what happened to Tania?” he said, and pistol-whipped me.



I woke up on my couch again. My car is gone from the driveway. The boxes with my stuff are scattered around my kitchen.



There was a note on the table.



It said: “Mr. Jones will come soon.”



Please, if anybody outside of REDACTED is reading this, don’t come here.



Don’t ask about Mr. Jones.
