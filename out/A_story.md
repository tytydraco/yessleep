The night at the station

Its one of those nights, where I think to myself, ‘this is lonely but beautiful’. I am sitting at a remote station in a village, the bench is cold, rusted, the station is empty, there is a kind of silence where I don’t feel scared but I do feel its grip on me, the track infront of me is thick with mist. I can almost hear the faint noises of small children’s from somewhere.The sky and I are the only thing present on this station, even though the mist is thick, the sky is clear, the stars seem like saying, ‘we see you’. The sweet taste of the tea I had earlier is still in my mouth, there is an eerie silence in the station, my fingers are numb, the air is thick, breathing is a task right now, I am waiting for a train that I don’t even know will arrive, why am I so calm? I ask myself, I am gonna die freezing here, there is a kind of addiction about this night, something different. I rubbed my hands, hoping the train would arrive.
Then I saw someone.


A woman on my right side of my platform, waiting for the train too. 

“Hi”, I called her.

“Hey”, she replied.

“Waitingfor the train too?”

“Ummm………yeah, its usually not this late, must be all the mist”

“Surely…I cant see a thing of the other side, Btw I am mukul”

She came, “I am dia, do you mind if I sit?’

“Yeah…yeah sure”, I made space for her to sit on the bench and cursed myself for not offering her the seat before.She looked maybe in her early 20s, she wore a yellow shawl with red bangles.

“You don’t look from around here”, she asked while adjusting her shawl.The cold doesn’t seem to faze her at all, she wasn’t exhaling fog like I am.

“Yeah,I was just here for a village development project, today was my last day”, I answered, “what about you?”

“Well……I was born and raised in this village…… I….us-..Teach at a secondary school here”, she said it with a smile, like she loved teaching and her students.

“Oh..okay”

“Don’t…..mind me but you kinda look exhausted, mukul”, she said looking at me, her eyes, they looked like they have lived a thousand lives.

“Yeah,I am kind of at my low point right now, kinda lost in life you can say”

She looked at me with her black round eyes, ”Well……don’t you think life is too short to have a low point, like …..you don’t even know if you are gonna wake-up tomorrow, just think about all the amazing people you will meet.”

“Yeah….maybe you are right”, I smiled,”I think we meet people for a reason, even strangers”

“It’s not always people that you meet, mukul”, she said that looking at the down at the floor, almost sad, her face seemed like there is always a smile just on the corner of her mouth. The kids must love her I thought.

“Don’t chase life, mukul, it goes far the farther you chase, just let it happen to you”, she continued in playful voice that sounded like a old monk..

I laughed.

“Was that your real voice, dia ?”

“Hey!!”, she shouted in mock defiance, ”that’s untrue”.

We both laughed together.

“Its been a while since I laughed this much”, I said

“Well, maybe you should take life less seriously”, she said

“Yeah, maybe”

“Its……….good….. to hear my name again”, she said so silently, I wasn’t sure what I heard

Her eyes looked like they have seen a thousand lives. We fell silence for a second.

“Hey you wanna have a cup of tea?”

“Is it on you?”, she asked.

“Sure”, I said.

“But I cant leave the station, can you get the tea for me here ?”

“Why? Train doesn’t seem to be coming anytime soon”

“Well you can grab the tea, while I look after your things and if the train comes, I will shout ‘APPLE!!’”
I laughed.

“You would shout apple?”

“Yeah, it’s my student’s favourite word, now shoo shoo go and  get me my tea”

“Sure, just don’t run away with my stuff”

After a while, when I arrived at the station, there wasn’t any mist,  a train was on the platform but I couldn’t see dia, a TC with a hat on was writing something on his notebook. He looked alarmed like trying to be attentive of his surroundings.

“Hey, a girl was sitting here, did you see her?”

He froze, “No….. the platform was empty and it usually is empty are you sure someone was here?”

“Yeah….”

I tried finding her but I couldn’t find her anywhere, as the train started to move, I decided to get on the train, but before that.

“Is there any secondary school nearby”, I asked the TC about the school she a told me about.

He seemed like his heartbeat stopped for a second, he looked me in the eye and said, “Yeah, you are standing on it”

I felt a chill running down my spine, “What?”

“There hasn’t been a school since the one here burned down, the teacher was hoping for a help that was never going to come, poor soul tried to save the students, used her own body to cover the kids, but nobody survived”, he said it in a painful tone, as he climbed back on the train and gestured me to follow him.

I looked back at the bench, a yellow strand on the bench, my heart felt heavy as I picked it up, for a second I could hear the kids panicking and the teacher trying to calm them down, I remembered her words.

“It’s not always people you meet, mukul”
And I realized, even now, she hadn’t left her students side.
