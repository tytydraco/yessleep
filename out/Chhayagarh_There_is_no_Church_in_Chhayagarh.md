Weird title again, I know, but there is a reason.

Honestly, nothing much could be done on the preacher front for today, so once Naru had finished rustling his files, we decided to head straight home. The rest of the family was bustling about preparing for whatever ‘ritual’ they needed me to do tonight, and my grandmother was smoking up the whole kitchen with her culinary black magic, though I must admit it did smell good. She was finally using the goat; apparently, keeping it in the freezer any longer would destroy the flavour. I wouldn’t know anything about that, but she wants me to eat before I go out. That was probably a bad idea, given that I am definitely going to overstuff myself if it’s her cooking. But there’s no arguing with Grandma.

Either way, since I had no idea what to do to help, I decided to give the journal another go, focusing on the entries I could read. I hadn’t intended to go very in-depth for the moment, but the very first entry caught my attention. Reading through it, I could not help but notice how much it related to our current situation. Almost as if it had been placed first for a purpose. What’s more, I could have sworn a different entry was in those pages when I checked it the last time. There was no way to prove it, but the book had apparently shifted its contents around.

Anyway, as the title says, there is no church in Chhayagarh. There is an old mosque, though it’s crumbling and abandoned now. There are lots of Hindu temples, including our family temple on the estate and the old, crumbling temple on the top of the hill, built many centuries ago by our ancestors and then abandoned when we moved our holdings to the plainland. But no church.

This was rather surprising since Bengal was the lynchpin of the British Raj, and we know that the government was aware of this village and, to some extent, its peculiar situation. Surely, they would have concluded that building a house of god, the ‘true’ god, on this land was a sure way to rid it of ‘evil’? But there was never any evidence to show they had tried.

But I now had the evidence in my hand. You see, until 1813, the East India Company was reluctant to allow missionary activity in India, as they felt it would anger the local populace and damage their business interests. However, the Charter Act of 1813 passed by the British Parliament made the Company take responsibility for the ‘education’ of the Indian people, which included allowing missionaries to preach in the EIC’s territories. Following this, a missionary priest was dispatched with the permission of Governor-General Francis Rawdon-Hastings (the other Lord Hastings) in 1816 to Chhayagarh, with the goal of “addressing its menacing relationship with devilry and establishing the law of god in the province”.

The diary entries of this missionary, named Charles Eden, have been meticulously copied by hand into this journal. Or rather, a part of them: the portion covers his entries from his arrival in Chhayagarh to what would be, for reasons that will soon become clear, his final entry. Instead of transcribing them exactly one by one, which would both pose trouble due to the archaic language and be incredibly boring, I have decided to use my incredible literary skills to compress them into a single, continuous account that will cover the entirety of his experience over the two days he spent here. For continuity’s sake, I’ll be writing them in the first person as well, but you’ll know when it’s me speaking and when it’s Charles.

All right then, here goes nothing:

It was raining when I first arrived in the village of Chayagore (Chhayagarh). It is a hamlet in a miserable state, built on hard, infertile land where almost nothing grows, and absolutely nothing grows well. The local *zamindar* seems to have a reputation for being a good friend of the Company, and the Governor-General has assured me he will cooperate, even though he neglected to furnish me with a letter of recommendation. I am not aware of the persuasions of this Hindoo fellow towards me, but his subjects are decidedly not entertained by my presence. Even in the brief time I have spent in the streets so far, I have caught two dozen glares, one or five frowns, and even a few sneers. It is evident that my black frock and starched collar are both an unfamiliar and unwelcome presence.

On the way towards the *zamindar’s* admittedly extensive estate, I glimpsed a prayer hall of the Mohammedans, identifiable by its dome even in its state of disrepair and neglect. I found it rather galling that even that beastly religion, responsible for so much of the sufferings of the natives if scholars are to be believed, had found purchase here when a bearer of modernity and rationality like myself should have to struggle for heathen approval.

But the Lord had only been too clear that spreading his Word would not be easy, and that was especially true amongst the unwashed and the illiterate. I had no choice but to soldier on.

At the gate, I was met by two very immodestly dressed guards, presumably of the lower castes. After all, such is the lot of the dark-skinned races in this country. They searched my luggage quite thoroughly with their grubby hands before letting me through. I suppose the idea of hospitality that the *zamindar* has does not extend to the trust one must place in guests.

(I feel compelled to clarify here that the racism is not my own, but his. I debated whether to leave it out entirely, but it is necessary to understand Eden’s worldview. As it is, I have already softened the blow by editing out the numerous slurs he seemed determined to hand out like candy.)

To add insult to injury, upon reaching this landlord’s sprawling and frankly obscene property, I was informed by a fresh-faced manservant that his most vainglorious master, not having the civilized decency to receive me, had instead embarked on some sort of ‘hunt’ in the vast forests of his property. He would not return until late at night.

Truly, much work is required to make gentlemen out of these natives. Thankfully, a few members of his family, including mostly women but gratefully a man or two in the form of his brothers, did receive me. However, I turned down their offer to attend with them some sort of *nautch* girl’s performance scheduled to take place in the evening, and instead asked to retreat to my quarters and have my dinner in seclusion. I have no patience for the vulgarity of those garish prostitutes, pretending to be something refined while flouting all God-given laws of modesty and submission to the social order.

Thankfully, they had at least heeded my sensibilities in assigning me simple and modest quarters, featuring none of the arrogant opulence that the local rich man seemed accustomed to. As a man of God, I do not seek nor condone excess in anything.

As I was rather peevishly scribbling this entry into my pocket diary, the same young servant brought in my food: a generous serving of rice along with some lentils, vegetables, and a thick, oily meat curry: this last one, I returned untouched, having adopted vegetarianism a year or so earlier. As with all the cuisine in these parts, it was heavily seasoned and immensely, overpoweringly flavourful. The abundance of spices in our Indian possessions has made even the poorest serf the owner of what would be a treasure trove in English kitchens, to say nothing of my hosts. Perhaps one of the few positives of their culture.

Nevertheless, I was careful to eat in moderation: besides my earlier disdain for luxury, my stomach was not fully accustomed to this clime. The servant waited at the door while I ate, squatting on the ground in a thoroughly unseemly manner while his eyes burned holes into my skull. When I returned my half-finished plate, he wordlessly bore it away, returning with a copper plate and a jug of water to wash my hands: the custom in these parts. I decided to cause no further aggravation by refusing.

This is where the first entry ends. As you can tell, nothing interesting really happens in this part, but I felt it necessary, nevertheless, to include it, as it tells you a lot about the basic character of Mr. Eden. These traits will be important to explain his choices and fate on the second day, which is where the matter comes to a head.

The entry begins as follows:

I did not sleep well. Despite my caution, my stomach betrayed me, tossing and gurgling all night in rhythm with me as I thrashed on the uncomfortable, thin mattress. I must have been half-feverish from indigestion, for nothing else can explain the dreams I had in those fugues, stuck between sleep and waking.

I dreamt of the forest, its canopy closing in an embrace that grew tighter every minute, snuffing out the light of the full moon above. I dreamt of a man clutching a rifle, his back turned to me as he stalked through the shade of the trees. I dreamt of a portal of quicksilver, gleaming and shifting with a light all its own, spread out in a fan, like a wave frozen just as it breaks upon the shore. I dreamt…

I dreamt of myself, laughing and pointing. Giggling. Dancing.

Beckoning.

Calling out.

That was when I snapped awake, roused by the rays of sunlight that streamed through the curtains and hit my eyes. Judging from the position of the sun in the sky, it was late in the morning.

I had overslept, and despite that, I felt as tired as I had in the night. Unwilling to waste any more time, I hastily got dressed and asked the servants to arrange for my passage into the village, where I would preach the gospel. The men arranged a palanquin in the traditional style to transport me, though the ride was rather bumpy and uncomfortable.

The proselytizing itself was, for lack of a better word, disastrous. The natives did not give me the time of day, turning away and showing me their backs when I approached and clearing the streets when I passed. The few I could catch listened to my sermons with empty eyes and a bored mouth, the sort of disinterest that makes you want to slap errant children upside the head at church.

Some, especially the young ones, merely laughed and waved their fingers in my face as I tried to talk. My native interpreter, a servant of the *zamindar*, refused to translate much of what they were saying, but the tone made it easy to guess the contents.

It was long past midday when I finally decided to give in for now. Rather than returning to the estate, I took shelter from the heat under a large tree, accepting graciously the little food the servant had packed for my lunch. I had resolved to return with a better approach in the evening, once the villagers left their homes again after their customary afternoon siesta. But, to be quite frank, I was fresh out of ideas.

Then, by the sort of divine grace that made me believe in the Lord in the first place, a tottering old man walked up and seated himself under the tree. From his robes, he appeared to be one of the Hindoo holy men. Though I was hesitant to associate with those black magicians, I introduced myself. To my utter surprise, he was cordial, introducing himself as Shivdas. Speaking fluid, if heavily accented English, he informed me that he was the priest at one of the local temples. He also knew of my religious persuasions from my attire; he had apparently been to Calcutta before, and seen others like me.

“Why have you come here, *babu*, so far from the big city?” he asked, eyeing my remaining food.

Though I was still hungry, I offered it to him, so as to leverage our new relationship. “The Company has informed me that godless activities are happening in these parts. The stench of Satan is in the air. I have been sent to purify it with the light of the Lord.”

“Godless?” The old priest laughed, producing a small chillum from his waist. “Well then, what am I doing here?”

“I mean the one true Lord, Jesus Christ.”

“I see.” He produced small balls and packed them into the chillum before lighting it. It was what the locals called *charas*. The resin of the marijuana plant.

“You do not approve?”

“I understand. The others will not.” The priest took a deep drag from his chillum, leaning back against the tree with his eyes closed. “We have gods here. They do not, cannot protect us all the time, but they do a fine job.”

“My God can. He is infallible and indefatigable. With faithful service to Him, all is possible.”

“You say that, but why should I believe it?” he chuckled, taking another drag.

“You want proof?” I puffed up my chest in indignation. To think that a Hindoo priest would ask me for proof after he admitted that his ‘gods’ were empty idols!

“Not just me. Everyone wants proof.” The old man opened his eyes, and just for a moment, I thought I could see a dark void inside them.

“The people here lead hard lives,” he continued, “dangerous lives, surrounded by trouble at each step and behind every corner. Why would they have patience for a *gora* bullfrog sticking out his chest and croaking? No matter how loud you croak, if it is pure noise without substance, it is meaningless.”

“You’re saying they don’t believe me.”

“Many in this world promise many things. Most lie.” He offered me the chillum, but I refused. “If you want to convince them, forget words. No matter how eloquently you speak, and you are not very eloquent at all, it will not move them.”

I frowned. I had not noticed him even once while preaching. Had he been listening secretly?

“Then what should I do, *brahman*?”

He stared straight into my eyes, puffing ceaselessly at his pipe. “Prove that your god is powerful. Take action. If you can successfully defeat the evil plaguing the village folk, they will be more than willing to lend their ears.”

“What evil?”

He leaned in conspiratorially. “In the forests, behind the village. The villagers go there often in the evenings, to cut wood and collect fruits for their homes. For the last few weeks, for every ten men that go in, one does not return. In the morning, we find the corpse.”

My heart skipped a beat, half in fear and half in excitement. “A demon?”

“Perhaps. Despite the danger, the people must go there. Without the forest, there is no fuel to light the stoves, no food to forage, no game to hunt. But if you can enter, defeat whatever this foul thing is, and make the place safe again…” He shrugged. “What better proof? You will have the ear of the village, the favour of the *Thakur*…”

“He might…” I trailed off, still contemplating.

“Yes.” He leaned in closer. “Yes, *babu*. He might allow you to build a church.”

In the interest of disclosure, I must say that something about this felt odd. It was as if his words were coming from within my own head rather than my ears. It felt as if a warm and comfortable blanket had been placed over me. His words seemed crystal clear in logic. Completely reasonable.

I am unsure if this was some sort of light-headedness from my indigestion or some sort of hallucination from the heat, but even on looking closely, I could not find any flaws or obvious malintent in his words. So, I assented.

Looking extremely pleased, he asked me to meet him at the edge of the forest at midnight, when, he claims, this otherworldly creature is most active. We sat under the tree for an hour or two, conversing on topics that were mostly unimportant as he smoked his chillum.

When he took his leave, I, too, elected to return to my quarters. There was little fruit to be found by preaching any further, and I needed time to rest and prepare for my work in the night. Upon entering the manor, I was informed that the *zamindar* was ready to see me now.

The man was pleasant enough, if a little unsure of my intentions. What surprised me most was his sheer girth. He was not fat, he was wide, far wider than those of his race had any right to be. His massive chest was almost twice my own, and his muscles bulged over the chair despite, from the looks of it, it having been built to order according to his size. He was the sort of man who looked like he could pick up and swallow an ox whole and, quite frankly, was a rather intimidating presence.

I told him of my plans for the night. It was impossible not to; the servants would have to let me out of the manor come midnight. The people here, especially the rich, locked themselves in at night.

He frowned. “You wish to go to the forest at midnight? Why?”

“I have been informed that there is a devil of some sort stalking it, my lord.” I took a sip of the piping hot tea they had served me. “As a man of God, I must investigate.”

“I am aware of some incidents in recent times.” He absently stroked his moustache. “I am sure the Governor-General has informed you that this land has always had its troubles. I would rather you not involve yourself with them. Your safety is my responsibility, after all, and Lord Hastings would not be pleased if something were to happen.”

“I cannot stand by and let the villagers die. Heathens or not, they deserve safe lives. It is a question of the Company’s values regarding the natives.”

“I assure you and the Company that I am investigating the matter. We will have a resolution soon.”

“All the same.” I set down the cup. “I would like to take a gander myself.”

He sighed. “If you must, I cannot stop you. Then let me send a few *lathials* with you, at least.”

“Thank you for your concern, my lord, but that will not be necessary.”

He sat forward. “You cannot mean to go unprotected.”

“My faith will be armour enough. No devil can stand long before the Holy Word of the Lord.”

“All the same, a few guards would not hurt.”

“My lord, my intention is to prove the power of my Saviour to your people. If I allow your people to accompany me, the villagers will credit you and not me.”

The *zamindar* looked like he wanted to say something else, but he settled for, “Is that truly worth the risk, Mr. Eden?”

“The Charter is clear. We must promote the proper education of the natives and make them ready for modern and civilized life, sir. Surely you understand that that cannot proceed until their superstitions are dispelled?”

With a deep sigh, the landlord rose from his chair. “As you think fit. For your sake and mine, I hope you are right. When you leave tonight, a servant will be waiting to let you out. I will at least give you some provisions, if nothing else.”

I got to my feet as well. “That—”

“The forest is pitch-black in the night, Mr. Eden. God or no god, you will not survive if you slip and hit your head on a rock or fall into a bog and drown. You will have a torch, if nothing else.”

There was no arguing with that, so I assented.

This is where his second entry ends. They were easy enough to transcribe. The third and final entry took far longer. The handwriting is scribbled, almost illegible. The margins and lines are haphazard, undulating and crossing over. It seems it was written with shaking, panicked hands, possibly in the dark. Why these details have persisted despite the records in the journal being a copy of the original, I do not know. Maybe the transcriber had wanted to be as true to the source as possible. Or maybe the copying was not done by hand at all, but by some strange process that preserved every detail of the original diaries.

On top of the illegibility, I put this entry off for the longest time because of the contents. It’s not because they are scary, though they are. Bone-chillingly so.

It is because, as I read, I could feel something strange taking root in me. A hazy pall over my mind, obscuring memory and identity. I began to forget where I was, what my name was, my family, my friends, and even what I looked like. Only the constant burning of the pendant against my neck kept me alert. It was only by taking frequent breaks that I was able to compile this one.

Almost as if the words were not just words, but invocations of the contents. I will let you be the judge:

Upon returning to my quarters, I shut the door and barred it. It has been over twenty-four hours. I have not left this room. I finally soiled myself, about an hour ago or so. I still do not leave. When the faint sunlight peeked through a gap in the heavy curtains this morning, I finally burned my Bible. Its smouldering remains are still belching smoke, threatening to choke me, but I dare not open the windows.

No god, if it existed, would allow that thing to live.

Even now, as I write this, I dare not light a candle or open the curtains. I cannot take the risk. I cannot find it waiting in the shadows. So, I only hope that this will turn out legible when it is found.

This is the record of my last day on this earth.

When I rose at the midnight hour, the house was dark and silent, save for the single lamp they had helpfully left burning outside my door. By its light, I dressed and descended the steps to the courtyard, moving to the outer wing. At the gate, the same young manservant who had first greeted me was waiting, an unlit torch in hand. I divested him of this, and he deftly used flint to strike at the torch’s head. The oily cloth caught fire instantly, bathing the darkness in the colour of embers. He also handed me a small wrapped bundle.

“Food,” he said in his Hindustani vernacular, which I thankfully understood better than Bengali, “in case you need to stay long.”

I had half a mind to refuse, but relented, instead forging on beyond the walls of the manor, laden in superstitious icons and charms, and made my way towards the massive hill in the distance.

At its foot, I would find the forest.

As agreed, Shivdas was waiting for me, sitting against a tree and smoking his chillum. He had planted his torch in the ground next to him, creating a bright beacon that I could follow. He rose when he saw me approach.

“You came. I was beginning to worry you had cold feet.”

“I fear nothing, for the Lord is with me,” I half-said, half-recited.

In truth, I was more than a little put-off. In the darkness of the night, the forest looked downright sinister. Nothing like the rare verdant vista I had seen in the morning from the windows. The trees were angular, their branches interlocking in crooked designs that blocked off even the full moon shining overhead. From the clearing, we could see little of the shadowy interiors. Even when I thrust my torch inwards, the darkness swallowed the light, revealing precious little. Every so often, a noise would issue from the depths. Noises I could swear did not belong to any animal or bird I knew of.

“It is good I found you today,” Shivdas said, snapping me out of my thoughts. “It is most active, most revealed under the full moon.”

“You know so much of it. Why haven’t you taken care of it yourself?”

He chuckled. “Oh, I would love to, but these old bones aren’t as strong as they used to be. Besides, there are principles. Traditions are to be upheld. One cannot just act willy-nilly with land as old as this.”

“You natives and your riddles,” I grumbled.

“Too true.” Though it was hard to be sure in the flickering light of the flames, I thought I saw his eyes dissolve into darkness again. Only for a moment.

“What must I do, Shivdas?”

“Seek it in the forest. It does not like the darkness. It flees from it, wanting to be seen. Look in the clearings, where the old growth relents and lets the light through. You will find it there.”

“Find what?” I asked, looking momentarily to the darkness again.

“You will know it once you gaze upon it. A mirror, but not an ordinary one of glass. A misshapen thing, so reflective that it may as well be water, glimmering in the light. Like a wave frozen at the moment of its breaking. It will ripple. Shimmer. Move.”

At that moment, I knew what he spoke of. I had dreamt of it. “And what then?”

He grabbed the torch out of the ground, closing the distance between us with more speed than I would have expected at his age. His grip was like iron as it closed around my arm. “Mr. Eden. No matter what you see in that mirror, you must not stop. You must not hesitate, not for one moment. If you do… it will come. Do not look at it. Do not listen to it. All of it. All of it is a lie.”

“I don’t—”

“Take the torch in your hand, and strike at the mirror’s base, where it adheres to the ground. It will be tough. You may need to swing twice or thrice, but once the base is broken, it will be defeated. It will disappear. At least for now.”

“I need to destroy it?”

“Yes.” Shivdas glared straight into my eyes with an intensity I did not know he possessed. “If you do not… with your sacrifice, it will pass through the mirror. It will be free for the night, and once it realizes we have tried to kill it, all hell will break loose. If you fail, there will be death.”

A cold feeling dripped down my spine then. In retrospect, I am forced to wonder if it was a warning. Maybe the last vestiges of my rational mind were begging me to turn back. I wish I had listened.

Instead, I nodded in grim confidence, hoisting my torch and setting off into the undergrowth. The darkness swallowed me as soon as I entered, pressing down with an almost solid quality. The gaps between the trees, which had seemed spacious enough, now began to close in at an alarming rate. Soon, I was barely fitting between them, squeezing through tangles of weeds, branches, and cobwebs.

I trudged on, occasionally sweeping the ground in front of me to check for hazards. The thick canopy overhead made it impossible to track the time, hiding the passage of the moon from the view. Even the forest itself offered no clues as to the distance traversed or any landmarks. Just an endless monotone of shadows and grasping trees. I spent hours in that dense growth, stumbling, tripping, and hobbling until my legs could no longer carry me.

Occasionally, the land would take pity, spitting me out into a cleared circle where I could sit and rest, the moonlight streaming over me like a soothing balm. Even then, the canopy was always exactly and infuriatingly the right height to prevent me from seeing anything beyond.

There was only the forest.

Mercifully, the food that had been packed for me had included a small waterskin, but even that was quickly gone in the oppressive heat. I was almost half-dead with thirst and exhaustion when I finally saw it.

A few feet ahead, in another moonlit clearing, something was glinting. With the last of my energy, I burst through the treeline and into the open.

It was exactly as I had seen in my dream: flowing, watery glass, spreading out into a rough fan-shaped structure that curled in on itself at the top. Like a wave in the sea. It rippled and wobbled on its own accord, turning its shining surface to face my presence.

Though the material appeared transparent, what I saw through the surface was not the other side of the clearing, but the forest behind me, with my form in the foreground. Like a mirror.

But not quite. The forest in the mirror was not empty as I had seen it. There were faces, grotesque, animalistic, demonic, peeking from every corner: around trees, from the canopy, in the bushes. Among them, strange wisps of light flitted about, like tiny fairies. Even looking at them threatened to lull my mind into a trance, urging my feet to step towards the mirror. Thus, I elected to focus on myself, the only constant I could know and trust.

My reflection in the mirror had the exact same proportions, the exact same posture, and the exact same features. It was different only in one, chilling detail.

It… He was smiling at me.

His mouth stretched to an impossible amount, the ends almost touching his ears to reveal a set of teeth exactly identical to mine, complete with my wooden dentures.

“There you are, Mr. Eden. I was beginning to think you would never find me.”

His voice was mine, but there was another layered under it: an older, deeper, sinister rasp. Whatever this was, it wasn’t inhuman. Remembering Shivdas’ advice, I kept my eyes on it.

“I have come to—”

“Defeat you?” it finished, body quivering like a mound of jelly from laughter. “Yes, yes, I know. Someone sent you to find me. They thought you could defeat me. You!” It laughed again, throwing its head back.

I raised the burning torch, taking a few cautious steps forward. “I am not afraid of you, demon, for the Lord is with me, and his Armour is the strongest of all armours—”

“And his Sword the greatest of the swords. I praise the Lord, my God,” he finished mockingly, mirroring my steps, getting closer to the glassy surface between us. “Prayers have no meaning here. Not yours, at any rate. Who was it that sent you to defeat me, little boy?”

He cocked his head, his neck snapping unnaturally as he listened to something in the distance. “Ah, him. The old meddler. I shall have to remind him of the consequences of interference, once I am out and about.”

“This is where you die, demon.” I closed the distance until he and I stood face to face on opposite sides of the mirror. “I won’t let you mock His creation with your sin.”

“You don’t have a choice. Don’t worry, priest. Many like you have come and gone. Few have succeeded. Once I have you… there will be no pain.”

In response, I raised the sturdy wood above my head and swung it at the mirror’s base. The surface shattered with a discordant signing sound, the flame leaving bubbling blisters on the cracked portions. The reflection winced as if struck, resting its hand on the surface of the mirror. The grin grew even wider, showing so much of the gums that it was almost as if someone had flayed my face.

“I lied. It will hurt. It will hurt a lot now. Let me through, little boy. Let me through, little priest. Let me through! Let me through! Let me through!”

He continued chanting in a thin sing-song voice, tapping his fingers against the partition as he stared into my eyes. Careful not to even blink, I raised the torch again and gave the mirror another blow. This time, the noise was sheer screeching, as if the object itself was crying out in pain. More of its base shattered, the shards steaming in the glass as they dissolved. The sound made me scrunch my eyes shut, almost involuntarily, as I shook my head to dislodge the sensation of nails dragging across my skull.

But only a thin stalk remained to connect it to the land. One more blow and it would be done. I raised the torch again, preparing to strike.

“Charles?”

The soft feminine voice made my eyes snap open of their own accord, even as I made to bring my weapon down. My reflection had changed into that of a tall, pale woman, with blonde hair running down to the small of her back. Her doe-like eyes stared straight into mine, eyelashes batting as she lightly tilted her head. She was completely nude, her nubile body inviting and suggestive as she leaned against the glass.

It was her.

Well, I suppose, if this is my final statement, I must confess. When I came to England, leaving my wife and son behind, I was… lonely, here in the Indies, with nothing but natives for miles around. So… when one of the Company’s secretaries introduced his rather fetching niece to me, I could not resist. In spite of my misgivings, I made advances, sometimes rather forcefully. She rejected me wholesale, younger as she was by almost twenty years.

And now, here she was. She let her other hand run up her body, leaning in so close I could see her heavy breaths frosting the glass.

“Come to me,” she whispered.

I knew it was a trick, but even so, I felt the shameful stir in my loins.

Though it was only for a moment, I flinched. Hesitated.

The reflection’s hand passed through the glass and caught hold of mine. I gasped at the sudden cold of the touch.

“Got you,” he hissed, back to his normal self.

Then, with inhuman strength, he pulled me through. Our bodies collided on the border, and I felt my head pass through what felt like cool water, into the other side. I dimly felt my limbs grappling with my other, back and forth on the precipice.

“I knew you would fail,” he gleefully whispered, into my thoughts rather than my ears. “I know everything about you, Eden. Every dark secret.”

With a burst of effort, I pushed him off myself, groping around to find my feet and bearings.

We were both on the same side of the mirror. His side, from the looks of it. Though I had pushed him away, he did not stumble or fall like a normal human being. He glided away over the ground, completely stiff like a character in a portrait, slowing to a stop a few feet away.

“Little Charlie,” he rasped, switching to the half-remembered voice of my mother as it lulled me to sleep when I was a babe, “Come to Mama.”

His head turned and turned and turned, twisting until his grinning mouth was on top and his crazed eyes on the bottom. Then he began to close the distance.

But he did not move. No, the world between us crumpled like a sheet of paper, folding in on itself as he approached. Like an inexorable truth. A fate one could not avoid.

I had only one choice. I looked to the portal behind me, and just as his fingers began to close on my hair, I launched myself, through it and back to the other side.

This time, the passage was like shards of glass grating against my skin, tearing and flaying. As if the mirror wanted to keep me inside. The next thing I knew, I was on the ground, blind, deaf, chest vibrating as I screamed so loud blood pooled from my lips. My scrabbling, lacerated hands found the torch sputtering on the ground, the rough wood stinging like hellfire against the stripped skin. Even through the chaos, I felt the hairs on my neck rise. A hand, wrapped around my ankle. Using it as an anchor to pull the rest of the body through.

With another howl, I threw myself back at the other, and we fought once more, the mirror soothing and grating in equal measure as we pushed and wrestled from one side to another. All I could see were dim shadows and shapes. All I could hear were the loudest of screams and taunts. All I could think of was one thing, and one thing only.

I had to end on the right side.

Eventually, I found the opening. With another defiant roar, I drove the flaming torch into the other’s face. He screamed loud enough to be heard through my ruined ears, and I used my momentum to push him through. Back to the other side of the mirror. Then, I swung the final blow, shattering the base.

A tremor ran through the air as the magic was broken. I was utterly drained, and every inch of my skin was on fire, but there was no time to rest. Though I could see nothing, I could feel it in my bones: other things, held at bay by the mirror, were now closing in on their weakened quarry. So, I turned, abandoning the torch as I ran headfirst into the tree line.

For the rest of the night, I ran. My senses returned to me, after an indeterminate amount of time, but I still ran. Through the darkness, stumbling over rocks and falling over branches, I ran. Every inch of the forest looked the exact same, neither deepening nor lightening, but I still ran. I ran and ran until the rays of dawn began to penetrate even the thick trees. Then, slowly but surely, the trunks began to pull away from each other, leading me towards the welcoming edge and the open fields beyond.

There, I saw Shivdas. He made no effort to approach me, only watching with an inscrutable expression.

His eyes were the colour of the night sky, glimmering with stars.

I blinked, and he disappeared. I never saw him again. I kept running until I found the walls of the estate.

Before I tell you about the last part of his diary, it is important to mention that I asked my uncles about him. Apparently, though there is no church in Chhayagarh, somewhere on this estate, there is a memorial tomb.

It holds the remains of Charles Eden.

He ended on the right side. For all his insults, all his flaws… I need you to know that he won. I need him to know.

Here is why:

Now, after so many hours, the rawness of my skin has healed. My senses have returned to their full vigour. Even the torn clothes are easily replaced. But they never will be. Before this entry, I had written two letters and slid them outside through the crack at the bottom of the door, hopefully to be delivered by the *zamindar*. One is addressed to Lord Hastings, the other to my diocese in Calcutta. Both say substantially the same thing.

I have failed. There shall be no church in Chayagore, and I leave strict instruction that no further missionaries or priests be sent here in my footsteps. The fate that has befallen me must not befall them, let alone something worse. The administration of the Company shall be advised to maintain a prudent distance from these tracts, and leave the lion’s share of its administration to those used to its burdens.

Once I have finished this diary, I shall open that door. I shall go out onto the town. I shall find a noose, and a stout branch to tie it on.

I shall be buried here in a foreign land, rotting far from the graves of my ancestors.

But I will be safe. I will know. I will be free of the question, of the fear, that gnaws at me.

For, even as I write this now, I cannot be certain.

In that crushing darkness, in that grinding silence, through the clash of hands and the chaos of screams, among the thrashing shadows and writhing lights…
