Hey nosleep. I have been having some issues that I need some tech wizard’s expertise on. Recently, my grandfather has passed away from colon cancer. Thank God he did. The old bag was a dick, but I won’t mention him for much longer. He doesn’t deserve any recognition. I got news of his passing about four months ago from my parents. While on the phone, my mom stuttered while breaking the news to me. “He’s gone Samuel….he..he’s gone.” She seemed actually scared by his passing. It really confused me the first time hearing it. Ever since Dad told me the stories of how she was treated in her childhood home, I thought she would be happy he was gone. That son of a bitch would beat and belittle my mother every day of her life. It got so bad that she contemplated taking her own life when she was 16, and yet she wants us to fly down to Crossville TN for his funeral. She said it was mainly to be there for my grandma and make sure she is ok. Grandma Eleanor is in the late stages of dementia, so it’s hard to say wether or not she knows what has really happened to her husband. Just to make sure nothing happens to her we were gonna stay with her for a month or two over the summer. 

About a week later we flew out from Staten Island down to Tennessee. Moving away from the city to some hick town was foreign to me. We never visited my grandparents. I have only spoken to grandma a couple of times on the phone before her dementia worsened. Anywho, on the flight there I noticed something strange about my mom. During the entire 2 hour flight she never moved….never blinked. It didn’t even seem like she was breathing for minutes on end. I ignored it and tried to relax the rest of the flight. We finally touched down and put our luggage in the rental car. After an awkward drive from Knoxville to Crossville we arrived at my grandparents house. 

Me and Dad stepped out of the car but my mother didn’t move. She was facing away from the house,forcing her eyes to the tree line from the house. “I’ll go talk to her” my Dad said. I watched as he walked over to open her door. I could see mom staring to hyperventilate as my dad was opening the car door. He squatted down to talk to her but all I heard were mumbles. She finally stepped out of the car with her head facing down. My dad held her hand all the way to door as we slowly approached the steps to the front door. The house was unkept. The grass was up to my waist and an old abandoned car was sitting near the tree line. 

I couldn’t believe my mom grew up in this dump. As we approached the door, I could hear music coming from the house. I now know that song was called Moonlight Becomes You by Gleen Miller. The song was unsettling to me. I never found old big jazz bands as my cup of tea. The music was coming from an open window on the other side of the porch. Before I could examine the house further, knocking interrupted any further thought of where I was. No one answered for a minute or two, but I could hear a shuffling sound approach the door. 

As the door was opening I could a see a pale thin woman standing in front of me. “Oh Thomas……you are finally home!” My grandmother squealed. “No Eleanor, it’s me Davis. Your daughters husband. Do you remember me? I know it’s been quite some time.” My dad kept trying to revamp her memory but she just stood there. Drool was running down her cheek while staring at my Dad. Her large grin never faded the whole conversation. A minute or so later she snapped back to what was happening and invited us in. She never acknowledged my mother being here, nor did she look at her. My mothers eyes never left the ground during this whole interaction. She was shaking uncontrollably. I knew there was something they haven’t told me but I never wanted to pry. 

We walked around the house looking for our rooms. We decided I would stay in my grandfathers room while my parents stayed in my mothers old room. I was worried that I would sleeping in my grandfathers deathbed but my father assured me that he passed away at a hospital 30 miles from here. Something still felt wrong but if they were ok with it I was ok with it. 

That stupid song has been playing on loop for the past thirty minutes that I have been unpacking. I asked Dad if we could turn it off but he thinks this is how my grandmother is coping with the loss of grandpa. I huffed and went back to unpacking. After about twenty more minutes or so I finished putting up my clothes and setting up some stuff I brought from home. As I turned to walk out the door, grandma Eleanor was standing at the door frame. “Did you buy some new clothes Thomas?” She asked. “No Grandma Eleanor I’m Sam remember? We spoke on the phone three months ago” Her grin slowly turned into a frown. “You shouldn’t be in here. If Thomas sees you in his room, he will think I’m being unfaithful.” She said. I called for Dad to help me with this situation. He came to calm grandma Eleanor down and escort her to her room. 

Dad came back and told me she’s just old and has never really seen me before other than pictures my mom had sent. “Get ready we have to head to the funeral service in an hour.” He said. I nodded and put on my suit and tie trying to look my best to please mom. As we were leaving, Dad turned off the record player and we headed our way to the funeral service.

The burial was unsettling. Only five people were the service. Me,Mom,Dad,grandma Eleanor,and the preacher. Grandma was just smiling the whole service. As I thought, she had no clue what was going on. “Isn’t this place just beautiful Thomas?” As she grabbed my arm. I just went along and said it sure was. The picture of my grandfather was as I expected. So grumpy old man wearing overalls. What a joke. Mom still wouldn’t look up even for a moment. Once the service was over, she was the first to head to the car. We packed up and headed back to the house. 

Dad helped escort grandma up the stairs cause he didn’t want her to trip and have to funerals in one day. I went ahead of them to open the door for her when I heard it. The music was playing as I opened the door. The same song as before. “Dad! Did you forget to turn off the record player?” I shouted. He looked up at me and flung his arm up in the air with the most sarcastic I don’t know look. I could’ve sworn he turned it off when we left but oh well. The music continued to play as we were getting grandma Eleanor ready for bed. One e she was tucked in we closed her door and headed to the living room. 

The record player was what you expect. It wasn’t modern. It had one of those big tube thingys sticking out of it so you know that bitch is old. Dad turned off the music and shut down the record player. Just to be on the safe side, I unplugged it from the outlet so it would kick back on. Mom was already in bed. Dad pulled me aside and gave me a lecture on how these next couple of months were gonna be hard for her so we need to help her out the best we can. He gave me a pat on the shoulder and told me to get some sleep. 

It was about one in the morning when I was awoken. I could hear the music coming from the living room. I just assumed that grandma got up to put the music on while she was reading or something so I tried to drown it out. Two hours passed by and I finally had enough of the same song being played over and over. I marched down the hallway to see what was happening and it was worse than what I had imagined. 

Grandma Eleanor was dancing in almost pitch black darkness. She was naked and slow dancing with something that wasn’t there. I slowly tried to back away but the old wood floor made the slightest creak sound. The music stopped and her movements froze. She didn’t move for ten minutes.
