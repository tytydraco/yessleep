My town has had an infamous urban legend for over a century; one of murder and retribution.

But as of last night, we now have two.  

I’d rather not say the name of my town, or even my country. Nor my own name. For the sake of this story, my chosen name is Charlie.

My town wasn’t always so small and dull. Up until the 1950s, the railroad business kept us going. Technically trains began running here in 1860, but we seldom used them for anything besides the mail or leaving the town for a larger city, so a grand station was unnecessary. The mainlines that linked our backwater town to actual civilization consisted of two parallel tracks, with a siding for each one; the station nothing more than a single story building with a platform along the siding for the eastbound track and one signalman’s box.

Those mainlines saw an increase in traffic around 1909, as new coal mines opened in the region. The town happened to be smack in the middle of two major hubs long coal trains traversed. Somebody had the bright idea to build lodging, fuel and water facilities with a small shop for minor repairs.  

In short, it worked. The railroads that owned the tracks saw improvements in schedule adhesion straight away from the refueling station alone. Not long afterward, they opted to keep a pair of heavyweight banking locomotives to help push larger trains over a steep grade just outside of town. The company brokered a deal with the town, installing several additional sidings and a locomotive shed just before the station. Some railroad crews actually enjoyed our dull little slice of nowhere, and even moved their families here.

The railroading boom also revealed something evil within our community, however. My grandfather had been the first to tell me the story once he had deemed me old enough.

Just before WWI began, a young, local woman was found dead. Brutalized on par with the victims of the Ripper, supposedly. This being shortly after the influx of new faces, suspicions fell directly on the visiting railroad men. However, none of them were ever charged and, over the next year, the sense of fear waned.  

That was a mistake. A second woman suffered the same fate of violent rape and murder at unknown hands. And as with the first victim, her throat had been cut. Not inflicted from behind, as you may expect. No, it was done facing the victim. Slowly, until he reached her spine. From the tool marks on the bones, from the same serrated instrument.  

This time, however, the local woman had been last seen in the company of a visiting Brakeman.  He was rather quickly arrested, charged, convicted and hanged for the crimes. It was over.

Until the real killer struck again.

On the night of June the sixth, 1915, a local man on the edge of town was lying in bed, trying to sleep. A heatwave had been in full swing that week, enough for everyone to keep their windows open. As he began to doze off, a loud crash came from the barn behind his house. From the window, the dim light of a lantern could be seen moving in the gaps between the plank walls. Suspecting thieves, he grabbed his loaded, double-barreled shotgun and raced across the property.

The sight beyond those barn doors would never leave him.  

A beaten, gagged, but alive woman was being sexually assaulted on a pile of straw by a “pillar of the community,” with a handsaw at her throat to keep her still as he violated her.

Upon hearing the door fly open, the attacker sprang up and attempted to flee, receiving a shotgun blast to the left hip after just a few hurried steps.  

Police were called to the scene. The woman was taken to the hospital, and the body of Mr. Howard - owner of the general store - was examined and removed from the building. He’d been found slumped sitting up against a wall with most of his head painted across it. The homeowner claimed to have fired both barrels quickly as Mr. Howard fled, killing him instantly.

Everyone collectively and wordlessly agreed to overlook the bloody trail leading to the wall, and the fact his entire genital area had been obliterated from what looked an awful lot like a third shotgun blast from point-blank range.

As it turned out, the sick son of a bitch knew the outsiders would be suspected over him, and attacked his methodically-preselected victims on nights large rail crews came into his store before retiring to the lodge.

The property was abandoned years later, when the owner died. Nobody wanted anything to do with such a gruesome scene.

Eventually, stories of a bleeding, almost headless man stalking the dilapidated barn at night, looking for young women to harm. Although some accounts claim finding his missing testicles was the ghost’s actual objective. That should give you an idea of how ridiculous I found the story. But absurd or not, it became a full-blown urban legend known by everyone in town for generations.

Fast forward to today: Coal trains in the region still move regularly, albeit nothing like before. The coup de gras, however, had come long ago with the advance of diesel locomotive technology in the late 1950s. Suddenly the big coal trains could work their way up the mountains without helper engines, and rendered the coal and water stores moot. Trains simply roared through the town without stopping. Our economy now sunk, and jobs scarce, many people began leaving altogether.

Unfortunately for me, my family wasn’t among them.  We’re still here in 2023.

My grandfather was one of the men that manned that sole signalman’s box at the station right up until the railroad updated their signal network, rendering manual operation dead in the water. We managed to survive, but with the source of our prosperity now gone, my prospects were limited when I came of age. 

Now that I’ve set the tone, there’s an important thing to understand. Even in our heyday, our station was rarely used. The larger sidings on the outskirts were busier, but passenger traffic remained sporadic, at best. The station effectively died with my grandfather’s job.

Unsurprisingly, the abandoned station became a popular place for teenagers. Especially once they realized the murderous ghost never existed, and nobody felt like hanging around a half-collapsed barn without it. The abandoned station offered an isolated, quiet place to get away from uptight, nosy neighbors in a boring, Christian-dominated town.

Yeah… it became my favorite place, sad as that is.

Unfortunately, I remained one of those people well into my 20s. Steadily over time, my peers were lost to opportunities such as college or military service. Those of us that remained either embraced the pious culture of the fading town, or were dead from opioid overdoses.

Eventually, I was the only local left who frequented my grandfather’s old post. On nights I felt especially restless, I would grab my backpack and walk down to the old station. I found it incredibly peaceful to sit in his old chair, watching the occasional train whizzing along the mainlines.

On this particular night, a storm was raging in the distance. Though it was passing by us, the news had reported flash flooding in the creeks, advising extreme caution to any drivers demented enough to travel in the storm.

I hadn’t planned to spend my evening in that signal box, up until that afternoon when I’d read yet another rejection email from an employer that would have relocated me from this dump.    

After my shift, I purchased a six pack of cheap beer from the gas station where I worked, stuffed it in my backpack, and headed towards the old station. I texted my dad to let him know where I was headed, and not to worry about me.

A few minutes later, the streetlights became increasingly sparse as I neared the edge of town. Soon I would be alone in the darkness that shrouded my destination.

The first few times I had been there at night, I admit the place gave me the creeps. With the lights long since disconnected, the eeriness of the cracked walls and peeled paint were amplified when revealed only within the beam of a flashlight.

Now, though, it was a place of comfort and tranquility for me. I felt no unease as I walked along the crumbling concrete platform towards my little hideaway. The stairs creaked as I made my way up into the signal box. I opened the door and shone my light throughout the room as I closed and locked it behind me. This was a small, simple setup. A row of large levers protruding from the floor ran along the windows facing the tracks. To my left sat a single desk and chair, with dusty, broken clocks on the wall behind it. On a table near the door sat the station’s logbook. I’d read through it at least a dozen times over the years; the signatures and notes dating back over a century fascinated me.

For those not aware, back in the old days, trains were tracked only by timetables and logbooks. The train would sometimes stop at a signal box in order for the conductor to confirm the status of scheduled traffic matched their track orders. Signing the logbook ensured the next train would know the lines were now clear.

But tonight I just wanted to put my earbuds in, sip my beers, and watch the distant storm while I thought about my future. I unzipped my backpack, took the beer out, unfolded the blanket I’d packed and settled in grandpa’s old chair.

It was quite peaceful, really. Watching the flashes of distant lightning while death metal kept me company.  

After about an hour or so, a train’s horn punched through the music in my ears. I checked my phone. Right on time. I barely glanced up as the freight train thundered past. Nothing I hadn’t seen before.

I’m not sure when, but I must have dozed off for a bit. It was getting close to midnight when I woke up, but I had nowhere to be and felt safe where I was. I leaned back in my chair and gently closed my eyes once again.

That was when I heard the distant sound of a train. This time I furrowed my brow and pulled my earbuds out to listen more closely. It sounded again, erasing any doubts.

The shrill, powerful sound of a steam whistle quilling is unmistakable, yet something I had never heard in person before.  

I checked my phone. Two minutes to midnight. Next train wasn’t due for about two hours. I sat up, fully alert, and peered through the darkness to my left, in the direction of the whistle.

Distant lightning illuminated the telltale smoke accompanying the approaching headlight. I readied my phone to take a video, since the sad reality was this qualified as an exciting event where I’m from. 

But as my thumb moved to press the red record button, the battery died.  

*“The hell,”* I muttered. It had just been at 50%

I just about leapt out of my skin when light suddenly appeared in the windows. The platform lights had kicked themselves on.  

And the train began slowing down.  

Instead of passing over the switch before the station and continuing on the mainline as the freight train had, she entered the siding as if to approach the decrepit platform.

The hair on the back of my neck stood on end. An instinctive fear was taking hold, much like hearing a predator in the dark. 

Sure enough, the locomotive slowed to a crawl and entered the bath of lights from the station.

This wasn’t an engine I recognized. Similar to the Hudsons I’d seen in videos of the northeastern U.S., but larger. Large enough to have an extra axle on both the leading and trailing bougies. As it neared my signal box, I got a better look at the headlight. The enclosure had no light bulb. Only a small ball of fire with no clear source, flickering away as it rolled over itself.  

The mystery train came to a stop, the locomotive cab directly in front my window, the coaches at the platform.

It consisted of this unidentifiable, glossy black engine, four light grey BR Mk1 coaches, and a deep crimson caboose. My eyes darted all over the entire train, strange details emerging throughout. The cab of the locomotive was pitch dark inside, the driver shrouded within. No road names or numbers were painted anywhere on the engine or its tender, only more of the shining black paint.

Much more unnerving were the scorch marks, the bent plates and rivets sheared sporadically along the boiler, even exposing bent tubes near the front of the locomotive. Yet the steam hissed happily, as any healthy engine would function. She was impossibly clean, too. No ash, dirt or grease to be seen along the entire train. Even the burnt and broken sections retained their perfect black paint. The coaches all had their blinds drawn, the lights inside flickering occasionally. The caboose remained dark, but a wispy trail of smoke emitted from the chimney.

The sound of a knock at the door instantly tore my eyes from the train, and a few drops from my bladder.

*“Did someone get off?”* I thought. *“How did I miss that?”*

The knock sounded again, and the door opened before I could react, a young man in a conductor’s uniform entered.

*“Good evening,”* he said politely, closing the door behind him. *“I presume that’s the logbook right there?”*

Although nothing about him appeared alarming at a glance, I shivered at his presence. I looked to where he was pointing, and nodded. Shock had set in and I didn’t know what else to do.  

*“Perfect,”* he said, drawing a pen from his vest and beckoning me over.

I swallowed hard, my thoughts fixated on if I had locked the door or not. Holding on to the hope he would leave if I complied, I nervously approached as he opened the old logbook and began running his finger down the page.  

*“Hmmm… it’s been a while,”* he said, as he signed his entry. His accent was rather thick, unmistakably deep south United States. Returning his pen to his vest pocket, the conductor turned to face me.  

Now that I had a good look at him, I realized I was older than he was. Clean shaven, with pale skin, blonde hair and blue eyes. His uniform was impeccable. All black, with a red conductor’s hat and matching red tie. The brass buttons on his vest were polished, along with his shoes. While the hat bore no railroad names or emblems, he did have a name tag that read: JOHNNY.

*“Everything alright?”* He asked, looking me over.

*“Yes, sir,”* I answered, despite seldom ever addressing another young man as such. An intensity behind his icy blue eyes instantly intimidated me.

*“You’ve got nothin’ to worry ‘bout tonight,”* Johnny replied, the corner of his mouth rising to a slight, amused smile. *“Our passenger should be here any minute, and we’ll be on our way.”*

*“Passenger?”* I replied.

The conductor only held his oddly unnerving smile in reply.

That was when the lights from the platform dimmed then began flickering rapidly. This had startled me on its own, but something with Johnny in the low light sent the feeling of an entire bucket of ice water down my spine. While he hadn’t reacted at all, it was his eyes that had tipped that bucket. For a fraction of second, they seemingly appeared to glow silvery white in color.

Before I could even ponder if I’d imagined the change, a loud squelching sound akin to slapping a sopping wet towel on concrete rang out from the platform below. Quickly followed by the shuddering gasp that could only come after being submerged to the limit of the lungs.

This was enough for me to finally tear away my gaze that had been fixed on the young man since his arrival. A glance out the window revealed a man on his hands and knees on the platform, coughing wildly and trying to catch his breath. Aside from the abrupt arrival and being soaking wet, he appeared normal. No older than forty, wearing jeans, cowboy boots, a black T-shirt and a black leather jacket.

*“Ah, right on time,”* came Johnny’s southern drawl from beside me.

The sound squeezed a few more drops of fear from me, as I had forgotten about him in the moment. He closed a glossy black pocket watch and slid it back into his vest before looking back to me.

*“If you’ll excuse me, I’ll be on my way,”* he said politely, tipping his cap. *”Have yourself a good evening, Charles.”*

And with that, he walked across the room and out the door.

I stood there rooted in shock, heart pounding and palms sweating. That is, until a bright flash and crack of thunder shattered my stupor a few seconds later. The storm was certainly much closer now.

A sharp hiss of steam drew my attention to the window. My eyes immediately drawn to the two figures on the platform. The conductor now stood beside the unknown man, who remained on his hands and knees. I couldn’t make out what was said, but it was clear whatever Johnny had said terrified the man. Slowly, trembling, the man rose to his feet. The conductor pointed to the coach directly before them. The man was visibly pleading, but Johnny simply placed a hand on his shoulder and gestured forward.

While I had been transfixed by his fearful expression, something else had seemed off that I couldn’t place until they moved towards the train: I could only make out a single shadow. The mystery man did not have one.

As they boarded the second coach, lightning flashed from behind. In the moment the scene was illuminated beyond the dim station lights, the conductor’s shadow covered the side of the train as he climbed the steps. The outline of an ordinary man in the distinctive hat now had large, bat-like wings spreading from his back.

Before the cold pang in my chest could even take hold, the pair were aboard and the lights inside the coach abruptly gone out, followed by the lights on the platform.

Steam hissed from the locomotive as though the train were finally to depart, but it did not move. The curtain in the frontmost window of the darkened coach, however, did. The same glowing, pale silver irises I thought I had seen earlier appeared in the darkness within, looking straight into mine. My heart thundered as my mind raced over what could be expected of me now.

The eyes then flicked towards the front of the train, where the signal stood. Sure enough, one of the levers before me was resting in the “stop” position. With a shaking hand, I grabbed hold and pulled it back towards me. Cobwebs broke free as the old lever creaked into the “all clear” position for the first time in decades. Mercifully, it worked, and the arm of the outdated semaphore signal raised and locked in place.

You can imagine my relief when those eyes in the window moved with a nod and the curtain closed.

The locomotive let out two short blasts of its eerie whistle and a bell began to ring a dark, deep tone more reminiscent of an old church bell. The screech of metal sounded as the brakes released and the train began to move. It was difficult to hear anything over the chuff of the cylinders, but between tolls of the bell, I could swear I heard faint screams of pain and sheer, primal terror within the darkened coach as it passed.

But there was no mistaking the sounds emitting from the caboose as it rolled by, I heard them clear as day.

Fiddles. Expertly played, complimenting each other in a flawless blend of duetting and dueling.

A single light was now on inside the caboose. The train picked up speed, entering the main line and thundering off into the night. Soon enough, the red trailing lanterns faded into darkness and the wail of the whistle swallowed by the sounds of the nearby storm.

Now alone and somewhat aware of the small damp spot in my boxers, I set off for home at a dead sprint. Dad was asleep, adding to my sense of relief as I locked the front door behind me. I went straight upstairs and laid flat on my back in bed, waiting for the adrenaline to subside.

I have no idea how much time passed before I fell asleep. I couldn’t have been out for long, though, as I’d been awakened by the sounds of my father in the kitchen. He had this habit of starting even his free days at a quarter to six.

I will never understand him.

*“I don’t think I’ve ever seen you up this early!”* He said as I entered the kitchen. He paused, looked me up and down and added, *”You alright? You look awful.”*

*“Just some weird dreams, Dad,”* I replied.

*“Well, there’s plenty of bacon. Help yourself.”*

Honestly, I thought the previous night simply had to have been a dream.

Until I saw what was on the TV.

In his never-ending quest to embody the stereotypical old man, Dad liked to tune into the morning news while he had breakfast.

*“Our top story today: a wreck on highway [redacted] bridge late last night. Single car accident; the driver is believed to have lost control in the storm and driven off the bridge.”*

I looked up at the TV and damn near choked on my bacon. I instantly recognized the photo of the driver. I had seen Johnny escort him aboard the train six hours ago.

*“The driver - identified as Dante Michael Rollins - is believed to have survived the initial impact of the crash, but was unable to escape the vehicle and drowned. Police say another motorist witnessed the crash and immediately dialed emergency services…”*

I stared at the face of the drowned man. The events of last night suddenly felt much more real. While I was wondering how it was possible, a jarring statement pulled my attention back to the segment.

*“…has confirmed the mutilated body of a young woman was discovered in the trunk. A confidential source claims she matches the victim profile of seven other young women attributed to the [Redacted] Slasher over the past three years. We will continue updating as the story progresses.”*

*“Sounds like the bastard had it coming,”* said my dad, shaking his head as he turned off the TV. *“I hope he rots in Hell.”*

I said nothing as we finished breakfast. Once Dad left for work, I left the house and made my way back towards the station. As much as I did not want to set foot back in that damned signal box, there was one thing I needed to check.

I went straight for the logbook once I stepped inside. Sure enough, the signature from last night remained on the opened page. I picked up the book and started leafing through it.

I had seen that signature before.

While somewhat faded, the conductor’s distinctive signature appeared on an entry from late at night on the sixth of June, 1915. The same night our town’s most infamous killer met his end.

I’ll never forget that night, as much as I’d like to. I suspect the questions will only ever be answered when the train comes for me one day. Johnny knew my name, and I’m certain he could see through me. I have no doubt he knows where Millie Wells is… and what I had done to her.

I don’t know when my clock will stop ticking, but I know what will happen to me after it does.

It’s too late for me, I earned my fate. But if you ever see this train…

***Pray you have no ticket.***
