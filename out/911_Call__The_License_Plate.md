**RIVER VALLEY 911 DISPATCHER CENTER – DECEMBER 14, 2022 – 11:37 PM** 

Dispatcher: “River Valley 911, what’s the address of your emergency?” 

Caller: “I’m on Ballard Drive, like that super long strip of road? Anyway, I just pulled up next to a car, and the cars in a ditch. There’s a huge dent in the front of it."

Dispatcher: “Alright Sir, stay on the line with me, can you see if anyone is in the car, or if anyone is hurt?” 

Caller: “Yeah, give me a second, I have to get out of my car and turn on my hazards. It’s dark as hell out here."

(Brief Pause) 

Caller: “Alright, I’m approaching the car, there’s... there’s a women getting out of the car, she’s walking over to me.” 

Caller: “Ma’am? Ma’am, are you alright? Are you hurt?” 

Caller 2: “Some psychopath darted across the road! And then I hit an animal or something, and swerved off into the ditch here. Shit. My fucking license plate must’ve fallen off with the damn animal. I don’t even know where it is.” 

Caller: “Alright, how about we go up to my car? You can warm up in there, and we can check if your injured at all.” 

Caller 2: “Thank you so much...” 

Dispatcher: “Sir? Sir, can you still hear me? Police have been dispatched, they’ll be there in ten or so minutes.” 

Caller: “Alright ma’am, just sit down here. The heats on, so you shouldn’t be cold, I’ll go look for your license plate.” 

Caller 2: “You don’t have to do that. Seriously, this is enough.” 

Caller: “No, no, I really don’t mind!”   
Caller 2: “Just- Just watch out for that other guy. It was creepy as hell, he just ran across the road...” 

Caller: “Don’t worry, I’ll make sure to look for him. I’m sure he’s just some random drunk.” 

Dispatcher: “Hello? Are you still there?” 

Caller: “Oh, hey, sorry I had my phone in my pocket. I’m looking for the womans license plate. She’s warming up inside my car right now, it’s frigid.” 

Dispatcher: “You should stay inside the car, there could possibly be oncoming traffic. Wait with the women.” 

(Brief Pause) 

Caller: “Fuck!” 

Dispatcher: “Are you alright?” 

Caller: “I tripped on something, damn, I hurt my hand!” 

Dispatcher: “Sir, you can find the license plate later, go back inside the car, and wait for police and EMS. The can check on your hand there."

Caller: “I gotta turn on my phone flashlight, I can’t see shit.” 

(Brief Pause) 

Caller: “The... fuck? I tripped on a damn bicycle.” 

Dispatcher: “A... bike? Sir, is there a person nearby the bike?” 

Caller: “I don’t... I don't know, I’m looking around...” 

(Brief Pause) 

Caller: “There’s someone in the snow, holy shit!” 

  
Dispatcher: “EMS is seven minutes out, can you take a closer look at the person in the snow?” 

Caller: “There’s... blood everywhere, in the snow, on the guys clothes...” 

Caller: “He’s got a reflective vest on, and a helmet on. I don’t know how I didn’t see the vest sooner.” 

Dispatcher: “Is he breathing? Can you check his pulse?” 

(Brief Pause) 

Caller: “He’s... he’s long gone, man...” 

Caller: “There’s... literally something impaling his chest...” 

Dispatcher: “Just in case, I want you to kneel down next to him and check his pulse, as well as his breathing.” 

Dispatcher: “EMS is almost there, hang on a bit longer."

(Brief Pause) 

Caller: “It’s... it’s the license plate.” 

Dispatcher: “I told you to forget about the license plate, check on the man’s breathing for me.” 

Caller: “In his chest...” 

(Brief Pause) 

Caller: “The fuck...?” 

Caller: “Oi! I thought I told you to wait in the car! 

(Brief Pause) 

  
Caller 2: “You weren't supposed to find that."
