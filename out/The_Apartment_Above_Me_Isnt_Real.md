*The Apartment Above Me Isn’t Real*

I live on the top floor of an old walk-up apartment building. It has five stories, no elevator, and peeling paint in the hallways. My unit is 5C. Above me is only the roof: flat tar, a few vents, and pigeon spikes. No attic. No sixth floor. No one lives above me.

So why, every night at almost the same time, do I hear someone pacing directly above me?

It started two weeks ago. At first, I thought I was imagining it. I had long workdays, thin walls, and bad dreams. But the sound was too distinct to ignore: heel-toe steps, slow and deliberate. Not rats, not pipes. Human—or something pretending to be.

The first night, I stood under the ceiling light. The steps moved across the plaster, following my every movement. I froze. They froze. For a full minute, I held my breath. Every hair on my arms stood on end.

I convinced myself it was roof work or a neighbor on the fire escape. Midnight came. 12:14 a.m. The footsteps started again, same rhythm, same pattern.

By the third night, I couldn’t take it anymore. I marched to the landlord’s door and knocked. He answered in a stained undershirt, eyes half-closed.

“Who lives above me?” I asked.

He frowned. “Nobody.”

“Then why are there footsteps?”

He rubbed his face, his expression unreadable. “Don’t look up when they’re walking. It’s not for you.” Then he shut the door.

The next night, I stayed awake with my phone flashlight in hand. Midnight came and went. 12:11 a.m.—steps. I pressed my palms to the ceiling. The plaster vibrated. Someone knew I was listening.

12:17 a.m.—silence. Thick. Deliberate.

I told myself to sleep. I told myself not to look. But plaster rained onto my pillow. Not randomly—it formed a straight line, like a chair dragged above my head.

I didn’t sleep again.

*PART 2*

I should’ve moved out that night. I didn’t.

Curiosity—stupid, dangerous curiosity—kept me in bed. I needed to know what the footsteps were, why they were there, and why the landlord said, “It’s not for you.”

I set up my phone flashlight and a small mirror, angled toward the ceiling. Midnight arrived. 12:12 a.m.—heel-toe steps, deliberate and slow. My flashlight shook.

I tapped the ceiling with a broom handle. A soft tap. Steps stopped. Then—three sharp knocks, directly above me. I froze.

A whisper, so quiet I almost didn’t hear it: “I see you.”

I jabbed the ceiling again. It moaned—wood bending. Then a small crack zigzagged across the plaster, almost glowing. Breathing. Not like a heartbeat—like lungs. A pale toe pushed through, curling downward. It paused, then retreated.

I yelped, throwing the broom. My flashlight beam danced across the ceiling. The toe appeared again, now with a hand pressing flat, fingertips splayed. A shadow of a forearm.

I stumbled back, tripping over my chair. The plaster fell again—tiny flakes dusted my hair and shoulders. This time, it formed a perfect arrow pointing to the closet.

I tried the door. Locked. The knob was sticky, almost warm. I called the landlord. No answer. Friend? No answer. The ceiling whispered: “You shouldn’t have looked.”

I slept little. Every shadow, every creak felt like the ceiling breathing. Watching. Waiting.

I’m still here, typing this, flashlight trembling, staring at the ceiling. I don’t know how long I can stay. But I can’t leave. Not yet.

*PART 3*

I avoided the ceiling all day, huddled on the far side of the couch. Fear only made my curiosity stronger. I needed answers.

I went through the apartment paperwork: lease, receipts, building maps. That’s when I found it:

"Occupants of upper units (non-lease) are not guaranteed under standard tenant law."

Upper units? Non-lease? There is no sixth floor. The top floor is mine.

I called the landlord. He picked up.

“What does this mean? I live on the top floor. There’s no unit above me.”

Pause. “Some tenants sign with both sides. You didn’t.” Click.

The plaster line returned, wider this time, like a crack in the skin of the floor above. My flashlight caught a faint shimmer—glass? Plastic? I couldn’t tell.

Then I saw it. My reflection. On the ceiling itself. Hair, clothes, posture—exact. Eyes hollow black voids.

It moved before I did. It tilted its head. It lifted its hand. I screamed.

Shoes appeared. My shoes. Sole-down, suspended above my bed. They’d been worn for years—how did they get up there?

I called my friend Ryan. He came over, gripping the counter, eyes wide.

“You see them too, right?” I whispered.

Ryan nodded. “Yeah. I… I don’t know how.”

The ceiling didn’t follow physics. Plaster rippled under the shoes. Cracks stretched like skin. Then the footsteps returned—slow, deliberate, alive. Watching.

I realized something worse. It was waiting for me to knock. The landlord had said: “If you knock three times, they’ll know you want the lease upstairs.” I haven’t. I won’t.

Tonight, the ceiling is breathing. It knows I’m awake.

*END OF PART 3*

\-----------------------

*PART 4*

Three nights without sleep. I sit in the corner, flashlight on the ceiling, heart hammering.

12:12 a.m.—heel-toe pacing, slow and deliberate. Tonight there’s a whisper beneath it: faint, insistent. “I see you.”

The ceiling changes. Translucent smoke curls through the plaster. Shapes form—furniture I don’t own, walls in strange colors. At the center… me.

My “other self,” perfect mimicry, eyes hollow. Clothes, hair, even my nervous fidgeting. But its grin… not mine.

Knocks—three. One, two, three. The landlord’s words echo: “If you knock three times, they’ll know you want the lease upstairs.”

I don’t knock. I haven’t. The ceiling waits.

Nails scrape above. Something wet drags. My flashlight falls. The beam lands on the reflection’s smile—moving, unnatural. I scream. Then silence.

The ceiling is transparent. I see an apartment I don’t own. I see myself pacing above it. I see what I will become if I don’t leave. Three knocks again. I haven’t answered.

*FINAL PART*

I finally understood.

The ceiling isn’t just above me—it’s alive. It’s waiting. It’s watching. It wants something.

12:12 a.m.—footsteps approach the center above my bed. Plaster ripples like a disturbed pond. Dust forms lines, arrows, symbols I don’t recognize. The ceiling bulges outward—skin stretched tight.

A hand emerges. Pale, thin, enormous. Nails dig into the plaster. Veins black like ink. Slowly, deliberately—it would take me if it broke through.

I scramble. The flashlight catches the shoes again. They line the edges, soles down, waiting.

Gravity feels wrong. My body tilts toward the ceiling. Fingers brush my hair.

Then silence. The plaster is flat. The footsteps ceased. But I feel it—patient. Waiting.

The plaster isn’t just plaster. The ceiling isn’t just a ceiling. It wants me to trade places. I don’t know what will happen if I sleep.

The figure above—my reflection—mirrors me perfectly. Hollow eyes. Waiting. I don’t know how long I can resist.

If you live in an old building and hear footsteps above… don’t look. Don’t knock. Don’t try to understand. Some apartments remember. Some want something from you. Mine is ready.
