I woke up, head throbbing, a sensation making it known that the place I'm in is moving, the interior is almost alien to me.

A singular note lays on the desk next to me, reading the following:

*Hello, I see you may be confused but unfortunately I have only a couple of questions.*

*I only know this, through eavesdropping: there are 500 floors, you are on the 500th floor, unfortunate..*

*Meet me on the 497th floor, and I will give you a bunch of helpful tips to survive this hellscape, such as the following, there are conductors on each floor, more and more hostile, you'll know immediately when you see them, also, another rule: do not be seen.*

*DO NOT BE SEEN*

**Good luck!**

I was astonished.. to say the least..

I decided to walk out into the hallway, and the note was correct.

Conductors on my "floor", but with one, giant, pulsating eyeball that took up the entire face like a tumor, a gaze without a blink that haunts dreams.

The interior was metallic, haunting. Passengers walking through the hallway, but one was arguing with the first conductor, didn't end well, to say the least, melted through the floor..

Nobody seemed to care, like it was a regular thing, but I get the conflict.

That guy was probably stuck in there for ages, so bottled anger processed onto the one eyed "beast" as he called it. Very extreme reaction to just melt the poor dude though.

I didn't know what to do, so I followed the other people walking towards their rooms, but I wanted to leave, get to the lower floor, the *lowest* floor.

"Hey, can I get past?" I asked politely, pissing myself in fear.

The conductor looked at me, a yellow gleam inspecting me, it's head tilted a little bit, by this point, I'm considering heading back to my room. The other passengers looking at the situation with curiosity and a nervous energy.

The eye flickered between green and red for a few seconds, the tension rising. 

A singular word was said, but they don't have mouths?

"Yes."

#

*Phew*

I walk down the stairs, a new interior welcomed me into the new environment.
A singular sign saying the floor number:

499

The aformationed interior was still hostile, a crimson colour filled the room, and my dread was not going to leave anytime soon.

I then remembered the note, I shouldn't be seen from now on. I tried walking into a random room, and started my new life.

Then, a person walked in.

"What the fuck are you doing in here?!"

"Hey, I escaped from the floor above, don't tell anybody about me, keep me hidden from the conductor, please!"

He pondered for a bit, his head tilted, until he accepted to keep me safe.

I woke up, head throbbing, a sensation making it known that the place I'm in is still moving, the interior is still alien but I'm almost getting used to my surroundings.

Another note lay on the table next to me,  reading the following:

*Congratulations on moving one floor! Now here's the deal. I will keep giving you information, but only if you move one floor a day, if not, then the deal is cut off.*

*Here's the next tip, possibly your last: some floors are traps, some floors are hallucinations, some warp your mind to project your thoughts in them. DO NOT FALL FOR THESE*

*Good luck*

My new roommate walked in and noticed the note I was reading, he didn't say anything but the atmosphere explained his feelings. A sour feeling lingering.

"Now that you know, you have to join me to escape, I'm trapped in a corner right now and I need your help!"

"So, you have contact from the outside? Fuck you."

"I've been trapped in here FOR YEARS! And you just have a fucking note guiding you around.."

"Okay, I know how this seems, but I didn't choose this, I woke up just yesterday in an unfamiliar environment and I just discovered these notes appear. So if you are going to jump to conclusions, think twice before you fucking say it."

Then, the train finally stops, presumably at a location for the passengers below, the atmosphere lifting a bit.

"Y'know, I've never been outside the train, I was born here you see... Maybe, we could see the world together?"

"Sure!"

He then introduced himself as Sam, and the journey has officially begun.

We structured a plan to escape the floor, and hide in an unoccupied room, I hide in  a box, Sam carries it, saying that it's a package for the floor below.

We set the plan into action, I get into a box, he picks it up and says to the conductor that it's a package for a friend below.

"Yes, go ahead."

*More than one word spoken, hm.*

Sam hurries downstairs, unpacking the box, releasing me into floor 498.

#

#

The hall was still haunting, a dark purple colour covering the room, no conductors, no rooms, only a single gem floating in the middle of the room.

*some floors are traps, some floors are hallucinations, some warp your mind to project your thoughts in them.*

"Sam, we need to run, we need to get out now!"

"What, why?"

"I'll explain later, just fucking run!"

We ran across the room, grabbing the gem along the way, in case there would be a use for it in the future.

Instead, it created a room familiar to me.

"My bedroom?"

"Yo, what?!"

The room then turned into the platform of the train that I'm on. Forming then into a glimpse into what the lower floors look like, golden and beautiful with pictures of classic art, instead of connecting rooms, it was a circular room, with a fancy table with red cloth layed over, with what looked like ten very rich people huddled around it.

The floor number is what surprised me though.

132

We quickly leave afterwards, down to 497..

I woke up, head throbbing, a sensation making it known that the place I'm in is still moving. After knowing what the lower floors look like, I'm desperate to go down there, and I'm going to be getting some answers from an unknown guy. This time, I have help from Sam.

Another note lay on the table next to me, simply reading

*Congrats, meet me on the left side, third up.*

*-The maestro del tren*

Finally, his name, albeit in Spanish.

No matter, my mission is to finally meet this "maestro"

#

"Hello? I'm here to meet 'maestro'?"

"So, you got the note. Come in"

Sam and I entered the room, and damp sensation making it known that this guy is not the definition of normal.

He had a top hat covering his face, multiple legs and hands moving around, less than a spiders, more than a humans.

He also had swelled limbs, some arms were swelling, some legs were covered in what looked like goo.

"I've been through many dimensions, universes, you name it."

"How'd you get the swelling arms?"

"Oh yeah, them. Some fucker with a purple hat gave me something that looked like a clever little gizmo, so I tried it and, yeah."

"How'd you get the goo stuff on your legs?"

"Adventured the many places of an island with a breathing mountain, just so happened that the island hates my presence. Eating through my legs that is."

#

"The many things you need to know about this train is that the floors shift when you make no progress for the day."

"WHAT?!!"

So that's why he said that the deal would be cut if I made no progress, because he physically wouldn't be able to send the letters!

"Also, never trust the conductors."

"Yeah, I noticed that I shouldn't-"

"No, what I mean is, they make deals, promises to the outside, a glimpse of reality. There is no reality, no freedom. You haven't experienced it yet because the first few conductors are fucking stupid. the others are cunning, sneaky, fucked up."

"What does wait outside for us when we leave?"

"We? No, nobody leaves. I don't know what's out there, all I know is the depressing atmosphere, awful hostile walls, I never wanted this, but I know it's my fate to be trapped here. I've been trapped here for so long that I've visibly worsened."

He pulled his top hat away, revealing multiple glitch marks, showing age and trauma in his visible scars.

He showed us the way out, before saying the most important thing so far.

"Wether you leave this train in an instant, or be trapped in hell forever, just know one thing, always keep moving.."

Sam and I left the room, heading further down with the maestro's permission.

Today was weird, but tomorrow will be fascinating...
