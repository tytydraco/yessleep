I was typing away at my keyboard. That’s when she asked me from the desk across the divider:

“*Wait, what the fuck?”*

I paused. “What?”

“How the fuck do I not know your star sign?”

I went back to tapping the keys. “Because you ask me and then I don’t tell you because I think it’s stupid.”

“Very narrow way of looking at the world, Jess.”

I let her have the last word. I was reaching that time in the afternoon when words weren’t coming naturally. I was struggling to draft a completely rudimentary email: *‘Hey Scott, do you think next Friday—’*

“I’m gonna look it up,” Blair interjected again. “I know your birthday’s on our team calendar.”

It was like her superpower was interrupting my internal monologue. And now, a three minute task had been elongated to five. 

I heard the enthusiastic mouse clicks that denoted her doing a non-work related task—it’s hard to explain but I could always tell—and waited for the reprieve, the revelation, and then it came. Her head peered over the divider. She was judging, *and* smiling, eyebrows squinted like her face was saying ‘*Fucking knew it.’*

“You *Cancer*.”

Yep, she’d found it. My June 23rd birthday. “Cancer indeed. On everyone I know and love.”

“This explains so much.”

“Do you think maybe you’re just retrofitting everything you know about me to fit this new piece of information? Tied to a near-religious belief structure that the day I was born, and the alignment of the stars and the planets, has something to do with—” 

“*Caaaaaaaaancer.* And no doubt you going all meta on me and self-destructing a super adorbs conversation is a symptom of a *much* more complicated problem: I’m thinking Virgo moon. Or Aquarius.”

I looked at her. “I’m trying to work, Blair.”

“I understand that, but this is *serious business* actually.”

I had a to-do list I desperately needed to carve through and multitasking was eluding me. A weekend of nothing but wafer biscuits and horrible sitcoms to stave off the darkness would only come if I got everything done. 

“*Please,*” I said again. “*Actually.*”

I could see her thinking about lowering herself back into her seat. “*Fine*,” she said, “but if you have any ‘Cap’ placements then you are literally legally required to tell me, because *honestly,* ya girl fucking *loves* Caps—”  

The lights went out.

Pitch black. Our office on a late afternoon in December was always dreary, but moments like this reminded me just how much heavy-lifting electricity was doing for man. 

A hum, a *flicker*, and then—

They were back, just as soon as they’d left. The open-office floor illuminated again.

Blair was still standing over the partition at our pod. 

“That was actually really dark,” she said. 

“Yeah,” I said, looking around. “Rolling blackouts? Or like… a tripped breaker or something?” 

My computer was still running, at least. No need to wait for the two-minute reboot.

She was looking at me weird. 

“What?” I asked.

“Did you always have that?”

“Have what?”

She pointed at my right arm.

I looked down. I saw the following marked across it:

# IIII

A tally with four lines. 

“*No,*” I said, looking carefully, then *really carefully,* then almost feeling the need to pinch myself as if it were a dream. “Did someone, like, draw this on me, or—”

“Draw it when?” she asked, as my eyes flitted to the other desk pods around us, noticing more than a few others looking at themselves with the same confusion I’d just clocked myself with.

My gaze returned to Blair, my internals still feeling a bit *off.* She was looking at her own arm now.

“Do you have something too?” I asked. 

“Yeah…” she said, concerned, holding it out to me:

# III

“That’s insane.”

“Right?!” she said.

Murmurs around the office floor started taking off—the voices of people talking to each other with similar inflections to how Blair and I were speaking. We were both looking around now. I noticed a ‘mark’ on many others. 

“Wait, I’m sorry, *how does that—*” 

“I don’t—I have no—” and then I just shook my head, “*Yeah.* Huh.”

And then we froze up as the sound of crackling came from, well, *somewhere.*

**“Hello,”** a tinny, amplified, somewhat distorted voice came through, like it was being transferred from a PA system. **“We apologize for the interruption. On all of your arms is a tally. You’ll have forty-five minutes to get rid of it. If you fail, you’ll die.”**

The bizarre voice brought about a reaction of scattered chuckles. ‘*Ah, a prank. Of course!’* I assumed was the prevailing thought from the floor. My pod compadre nervously laughed in my direction as well. Laughter kills fear after all, right?

I wanted to laugh too, but the slightest bit of honest thought was making it clear that something was very wrong.

**“There is only one way to bring your tally down: successfully kill someone else. One life taken, is one tally removed. Best of luck!”**

The static hum and crackling immediately ceased. The vacuum the voice had temporarily occupied was now unfilled again. 

The room sat with the void. With the tension.

I swallowed. Instinctively clocked the time—*4:31 PM.* 

“That’s fucking mental,” I heard someone say quite loudly, before readjusting in his seat and bringing his attention back to his computer, lightly shaking his head. “Crazy fucking prank.” I scanned around me to see other colleagues—*the norm, it seemed*—defaulting back into their routines, ignoring what had just happened.

Maybe *ignoring* was a strong word. Returning to the self-soothing ritual of *routine?* More apt. 

Still, in the thirty or so seconds of me looking around, nearly everyone was sneaking glances down at their arms. Trying to reconcile internally, it seemed, with the unreality that had just taken place—a voice from nowhere, and a tattoo they had never signed up for. 

*My self-soothing ritual?* People-watching with a dash of internal monologue. 

Blair cleared her throat to grab my attention. I let my stillness suggest listening. 

*“What the fuck?”* she whispered.

I continued side-eyeing the white collar universe around me. “Maybe it’s nothing. *Occam’s Razor* says it’s probably nothing,” I whispered back. 

“Okay, well what the fuck do *Schrodinger’s Cat* and *Maxwell’s Silver Hammer* say about it?”

I went back to my emails. All of this was insane. Insane and unnecessary. *‘Hey Scott, do you think next Friday would be a reasonable timeline to get the report—’*

“*Hey,* I’m *talking to you,*” she said, harsher this time. 

“What?”

“You can’t just ignore insane shit by saying big words.”

“I’m not,” I said, feeling the friction around the room growing palpable, “*Yes*, it could be something. But I think we need to stay chill.” 

“*Stay chill?*” I could hear the restlessness in her tone. 

I looked down again, hoping by some miracle the insignia would be gone, but it wasn’t. 

*“Jess,*” she breathed again. 

“Right, I—” *the low voices and under-the-breath remarks around the room continued to grow*, “*Look*, have you heard the expression we’re only nine square meals from anarchy?”

“*No?* What? I mean, maybe?”   

“It’s pretty self-explanatory.”

“No offense but it’s getting *pretty hard to think clearly right now—*”

“Let me try again,” I murmured, looking around. “I don’t think we need to worry about whether this is real or not. It almost doesn’t even really matter. The truth is, *no matter what*, everyone is going to lose it, *really* fucking soon. Take it from a begrudging study of human character. The seconds are gonna tick away, and this is all gonna escalate faster than anybody thinks.”

I could feel how tense she was through our divider.

“And we’ll remember,” I continued, “that we’re just wild animals, sitting in chairs, dressed in clothes to lie to ourselves.”

She let the silence hang for a second. Then—“And by any chance do you have an *action plan* to go with your Philosophy 101 course?”

“Yes,” I bit out. “We wait for people to start losing their shit. That’s our distraction.” Then, I returned to putting the finishing touches on that email. ‘*Hey Scott, do you think next Friday would be a reasonable timeline to get the report done by? Let me know—if you need an extension, that’s fine too.’*

And *send!* It was always the little things. To Blair’s credit, I could hear her clicking around and typing now too. We couldn’t be the first ones to broach the silence. We couldn’t be the first ones to make a move.

And like a bolt, the most mysticism I’d ever felt hit me. The reality that somewhere in our bones, we can *always* tell when an escalation is about to happen. We won’t know what it is, but we’ll feel it coming—an *escalation.*

A man at a distant desk stood up all of a sudden. “I’m sorry,” he half-shouted, seemingly trying to hide his agitation but not doing a great job at it. “Should we be calling the cops or something? I mean *what the fuck are we all sitting down for?*”

A woman at another workstation stood up. “*Agreed.* Call the authorities. Is everyone good with that as a next step?” A pie-chart of humanity’s personality types responded in real-time. Some shouts of agreement, some hushed words of concern, and *silence.* 

“Wait, forgive me but—” started another gruff man, standing up—*ah, Brent from Accounting!*—“Call the police, and then what? Another five minutes go by? Maybe ten by the time they’re here? And what’re you gonna tell ‘em? We all got *tattoos* and a voice is telling us to kill each other? They’ll think you’ve gone insane!” He was usually so quiet—good on ya Brent, for speaking your mind!

And as more disparate parties started to chime in, our slice of the populace—‘flight’ on the freeze to fight continuum—started eyeing the hallways.

I whispered to Blair again. “Let’s get ready to walk towards the exit. We’ll rush down the emergency stairs to the outside.” 

“*Okay,* but if it’s real, then…?”

“Then we’ll cross that bridge when we need to. But let’s start here.”

And soon, more and more of the archetypes of man started gathering in the center of the office floor. Of the eighty or so of us on the third floor, I had to imagine things were playing out just the same on the two floors below us, and three above. The spine of Maslow’s hierarchy of needs was predicated on one *being alive.* Hence—facing death was—

*Christ,* all I was doing was just thinking. Escaping into my own head.

I was here. In my seat. This was real. 

Around our pod, words flowed out from our coworkers—who now seemed like complete strangers—with greater intensity:

“We need to call for help, *immediately!*” 

“This is *fucking real. How else would it put this fucking shit on us?”*

“Let’s keep it cool, people,” said Lindsey, project manager, frequent all-hands presenter and group leader of our social committee, “*nothing good* is gonna come from us losing our heads.”

The long thread of mob violence that chained centuries was going to see representation in our room. I could feel it coming. And with it, I could feel Blair’s cyclops eyes beaming the words ‘I am scared’ through our pod divider. I spoke up again:

“*Get ready. We’ll head for the hallway first. Crouch a bit when you get up but act normal.*”

I steeled myself. Grabbed a pen from my desk and pocketed it—the only self-defense item I had available—as I noticed groups slowly gathering amongst themselves. I just needed *one last thing to happen.* I watched and waited until—

A woman, with a seat *right next to the hallway,* casually got up, yawned, stretched, and stepped out with no great urgency. That was my meal ticket. The ground had now been broken. 

Slowly, I—

Detached myself from my seat, trying to keep my body language as casual as possible. I saw Blair lift herself as well. Both of us had crossed the threshold now. I turned toward the corridor and led the way, praying all the while the distractions on the floor were enough to make us small fries in the grand scheme of the pandemonium. 

*Step. Step. Step.* My boots on the ground had never felt so loud. Soon, we’d reached the—

Hallway. And then we picked things up a pace.

“What if there are people in the stairwell?” she said, keeping stride beside.

“Then we’ll turn around,” I said, “find another way out.” We walked past a man and woman heading in a different direction. I flashed them a plastered smile and intense eyes that screamed *no sudden movements.* They seemed to be in the same headspace.

“*And if it’s real?*” Blair asked.

“You asked me that already,” I said. “We can’t think about that yet.” We advanced past another woman adjacent to us in the wide hall. She ducked into an adjacent hallway, averting eye-contact the entire time. The *‘if I don’t look at you, you can’t see me’* strategy. Respect. 

And that’s when Blair grabbed my arm.

“What?” I said.

“I’m sorry. But I’m freaking the fuck out.”

“*Everyone is,* which is why we have to be different. Because different—” I looked around, the paranoia seeping into me too, “*different* survives.”

She took an uncomfortably long beat to digest it. Then, “different survives,” she said back.

“Different survives.” It was a mantra now. I strolled forward, as we neared a four-way hallway intersection—

And it was only at *very last second* as we approached said intersection that I saw the strange man pressed flat against the wall just around the corner, trying to make himself invisible.

“Different surviv—” but before Blair could finish, the stranger broke out from his spot and tackled us both down.

My head bounced off the floor—the human battering ram had winded me. “Fu…fuck…” I struggled to say, turning my body just enough to see him on top of Blair, who was flat on her back six or seven feet away, most certainly trying to kill her.

And I saw his exposed arm with the number “**10**” written in tallies.

And I realized the only reason he’d picked her and not me to kill first was random chance and random chance alone. That was it. “Sorry, *I’m so sorry,*” he whispered, “but I have a family.” He secured the scissors from his pocket.

And it was immediately clear that the window for me to do *anything* was *insanely* small. I threw my body up, *booked it to close the distance,* while the doomsday clock of Blair’s death counted down, and just as the momentum of his equipped hand shifted from upwards to descending, I—

Forced my pen into the back of his neck as fucking aggressively as I could. I had to dissociate. It had to be like a game. The deeper it went, *the more force I utilized,* the more a chance of life there was—for her.

And as it lodged, he froze. He looked to the side, but only partially, and then his body started reacting to the writing utensil turned pathogen logged in his neck. A gargling noise, turned to him choking, turned to me hearing the sound of Blair’s screams which I realized were actually ever-present the entire time, as if she were a dial I was completely tuning out because it was irrelevant to the moment, to her survival, and as she did scream I wondered why nobody was coming, but then it dawned on me that the three minute gap from when we’d left the open-office floor had been just enough time for whatever was happening to truly hit a breaking point. *Sure enough,* there was noise coming from all around us, from *everywhere,* the sounds of chaos—

“JESS!” Blair screamed at me. Shit—I was zoning out again. I tuned back in to see her covered in the blood of the man I just stabbed, while his death spasms shook out.

Immediately, I pushed him off her, catching a glimpse of his empty eyes, and pulled her away. I looked for somewhere for us to hide. “Was he able to catch you with his scissors at all?” I asked.

She screamed back in response.

“That’s not an answer, are your vitals okay?”

“*I don’t fucking know*,” she screamed again. I desperately scanned for the closest refuge, spotting the men’s bathroom nearby. I half-dragged and she half-walked to it, as more people started coming out of the woodwork.

Door pushed open, I yanked her inside, closed it behind us, and looked desperately—as I took in the similar but *oh-so-different* vibe of the dudes’ room—for something to keep it closed with.

I spotted a mop leaning beside the sinks. 

Blair was fully upright now. I grabbed it and wedged it behind the door handle, angling the other end down to the floor. Secure enough.

I looked at her. She looked at me. She pointed at my arm. “*What the fuck.*”

I looked down. The marking was now:

# III

Eyes widened. “Okay… well that’s… *something.*”
