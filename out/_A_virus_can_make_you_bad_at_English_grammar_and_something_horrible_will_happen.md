Hi everyone, I am Dr Zhang. One of my patients stole my phone and sent some ridiculous horror fantasies in poor English grammar before hanging himself.  I am sorry about it. 

But what I will say next is the absolute horror which can lead to the collapse of human civilisation. 

Things began days ago. I work in the Secret Laboratory, which hides in a prison for psychotic prisoners; the government sentenced them to lifetime imprisonment. Our job is to develop special weapons to destroy our enemies' countries. Sometimes, we utilised our hopeless psychotic prisoners as guinea pigs for scientific purposes. I think nothing is wrong; they are foolish. Becoming test subjects is the only value of their existence.

We communicate in English, even in a non-English speaking country. English was like an Encrypted language there; most prisoners were poorly educated and bad at English listening. It was an excellent method to prevent them from accidentally hearing our conversation and causing some prison riots.

Until one day, something worse than a riot happened. 

We have a project called Cognitive Virus, more like a meme, I think. It is like contagious information, spread through communication like conversation or reading. It is precisely for our greatest enemy-America. It can infect Americans’ thoughts and turn them into maniacs. 

We tried to design it to be a memetic virus that only Americans could understand and be infected by. The experimental results are not ideal. Some people who only know a little bit of English will be infected, too. It is spread mainly through language.

A new guinea pig for this project is a prisoner born in America but immigrated to our country. We locked him in a Sound insulation chamber and infected him with it. We let him write a diary in Chinese about his daily state. (The virus can not spread through non-English languages). 

In the first few days, the guinea pig looked ordinary. I often chatted with my boyfriend during meals in those dull days. He is also a scientist and once studied in the United States. He said that he could read lips. One time, when he was in the United States, he saw Some boys quietly talking about him with his classmates, saying he had a sexy figure and wanted to date him. "so? Have you ever dated one of those boys?" I joked. "How is that possible!" my boyfriend said sweetly. "They are not handsome guys; they are not nerds. How could I date them?"

"You are a nerd; I am not a nerd. I am Chad!" I replied jokingly. We laughed together.

Jesus, it is heartbreaking to think of him. 


Over the following several days, our subject wrote in his Chinese diary that his English grammar had become poor. He discovered this while talking to himself.

Over the subsequent few days, he said a similar situation, which was getting worse. And he is turning more and more barbaric? He started eating food with his unwashed bare hands and masturbating ten times a day.

And one day, he bit his intestines out. 

He looked fanatically at our monitor, smiled and said something. 

“天呐！ 我看懂了他说了什么！我忘了我能读懂唇语 (Oh my God! I understood what he said! I forgot I could read lips!)” my boyfriend yelled; my boyfriend said he read the infected prisoner’s lips and understood what he said. We started calling for security, calling them to quarantine him. He read the sentences the infected said, and maybe the virus could spread in his thoughts and infect him. 

But everything is too late.

The virus works faster on my boyfriend. We didn't know that the virus had various incubation times after infecting different people, and my boyfriend showed symptoms within seconds. He strips naked, laughing hysterically and trying to say something. The tears fall from his face, and he is crying while laughing. 

There was a conflicted expression on his face as if he was enduring something as if he was fighting the beast within.

“不要……听。(Don't...listen.) he said in Chinese. He told me not to listen. And I guess this sentence is the last Chinese he said. 

Immediately afterwards, I pricked my eardrums with pens. I made myself deaf.

Silence. 

I saw my boyfriend punch over a security guard who was trying to gag his mouth. Then he yelled something hysterically, and I could see from the expressions of the people around me that it was some English swear words full of grammatical errors.  

There was Gunfire everywhere.

A security guard started firing, and I dodged and hid under the table. Everyone surrounding me started turning, and my infected boyfriend rushed into the broadcast room. A guard tried to stop him, and an infected researcher bit the guard’s nose off. 

I saw the sound boxes vibrating, and I guessed somebody had broadcasted English insults full of grammatical errors throughout the prison. 

Every person who knew English in the prison started becoming an infected maniac. 

Since the accidental biological weapons leak in 2002, we have increased security measures. An injured security guard dragged his bloody body, pressed the emergency button and entered 1408, which is the code of the "Cognitive Virus" project. After receiving the code, the prison's emergency quarantine system closed all exits and cut off the Internet. And it notified a task force of soldiers who did not understand English to suppress the outbreak. They would come within an hour. 

It is the worst hour of my life.

Half of the guards don't understand English and can not be infected. They were fighting with the infected guards and researchers. At the beginning of the fighting, the normal guards seem to have advantages. They are more organised than the infected. And the infected often attack each other.

But suddenly, something more horrible happened; it seemed not a simple “cognitive virus”; it seemed more like a demonic spirit spread by English conversation with poor grammar. Some infected turn supernatural, floating in the air, murmuring something I can not hear. But my intuition told me that it was a spell—strange tattoos which looked like a creature crawling on the tree proliferated on those infected’s bodies. The eyes of many guards were pulled out by some invisible supernatural force, slowly floating into the mouths of those supernatural infected and then swallowed into their stomachs.

I was shaking all over, my hair stood on end, and I felt a chill that seeped down my lower body. I lost control of my bladder. My stomach was churning, and I forced myself to swallow the vomit that was rising. I couldn't let them find me, I couldn't let them find me, I kept repeating in my mind, and salty tears fell from my face into the pool of blood on the ground.

I was hiding under the table while peeping toward the monitor screen. Some uninfected guards opened the doors of cells to release the prisoners; they thought they could help suppress the outbreak, but they were wrong.  The majority of prisoners can not be infected, but they are psychotic, some of them more insane than the infected people. And some of them want to seek the chance to escape. 

An infected guard shot randomly, and a prisoner sliced his throat and used his gun to shoot a gas tank. 

There was scarlet blood and fire everywhere.

Nearly all people who have sanity are dead. There was an orgy in the prison, an orgy of lunatics, an orgy of bloodbath. 

I was still hiding and prayed to god. I used to be an atheist, but now I hope god exists. “Saint Michael the Archangel, defend us in battle; be our protection against the wickedness and snares of the devil.” I kept repeating the exorcism prayers I learned from TV dramas in my mind.

“May God rebuke him, we humbly pray: and do thou, O Prince of the heavenly host, by the power of God, thrust into hell satan and all of the other evil spirits who prowl about the world seeking the ruin of souls. Amen.”

I was shaking all over and accidentally spoke it aloud. 

Those supernatural infected people were twisting in the air, laughing cruelly; they found me because of my stupidity. They used their invisible force to hang me in the air and strip me naked.

I was floating to them, closer and closer. 

And they started to eat me.

They bit my feet. They tore my thighs. They suck my toes. They lick my armpits. I was being tortured slowly and painfully; they were trying to torture me to death bit by bit and then eat every inch of my flesh and blood.

Suddenly, those supernatural-infected people lost strength, and their bodies shrank and drained. It seems supernatural abilities can not be held too long on mortals’ bodies. Or maybe my prayer worked? I don't know; their bodies were slowly falling on the ground. And die motionlessly. And their blood was floating to the sky, disappearing in vain.

My body fell heavily to the ground.

But those infected people who are not supernatural are still active. They seem stunned for seconds. And they were rushing to me.

Countless madmen covered in blood rushed towards me, and I was about to be cut into pieces.

And he rescued me. 

He bravely rushed towards the group of madmen, firing with two rifles at the same time until he ran out of bullets. Then he grabbed the hot barrel, swung the gun and smashed the heads of the remaining madmen.

He is not an uninfected person.

He is my infected boyfriend. 

He walked towards me with a weird smile on his face. Did he try to hurt me? Or did he want to hug me? A voice inside me told me he was infected and would kill me. But I don't care that much anymore. I walked towards him, our bodies about to touch.

His head suddenly split open, and blood and brains splattered all over my face.


It was a guard with a sniper rifle who shot him. A piece of paper fell from my boyfriend’s clothes. I locked myself in an empty cell, opened it to read, and it was a letter:

“Dear Mr. Zhang, my love.”

“ When you found this letter, I might have been caught. I am a special agent who infiltrated your country. They already doubt me. I don't know how long it will take before suspicion turns to conviction. But I have not much time.”

“They monitor my phone, so I can only tell you the truth through a letter. It is my last request.”

“ I know you are ruthless, selfish and have no sense of morals. You will not be willing to fight for democracy or the future of human civilisation. But I still request you
to expose all these. You can seek asylum in the United States after revealing all these evil human experimentation and weapons research.“

“ Because I know you love me. The love toward me may be your only positive emotion. But it is your strongest emotion. I know you will expose all these, not for democracy or Justice, but for me, you will not reject my last request.”

“ I love you, darling. I does not want you soul fall in to hell. I hope I can see you heaven. We will immortal in there, we can together play Grand Chase,  there is some cute spider call Tree Crawler in game. And we forever will together. 


I climbed out of a break in the wall after I read this. Yes, I am a bad person, but I is willing to do anything for my boyfriend. Some lunatics climbed out too, they is fighting with a task force who are coming for reinforcement and suppress the outbreak. 

I stole car when they fighting, and drive it to place where is have signal, I type this on my phone, and send it on Reddit to expose it. 

Beware cognitive virus, if you find you grammar are bad, want [beware.](https://youtube.com/@misszhang1408?si=aKNIApJ2d6ytnp9C)
