I didn’t sleep well the final night I was seventeen. Bad dreams kept swirling around like sharks in shallow water, just out of sight. I woke up feeling sick and scared. The dread faded quickly, though, in the light of the sun, which my mom let crashing into my room when she threw the curtains open. 

“Happy birthday!” my mom yelled.  “You’re now eligible for the draft and jury duty.” 

I groaned and put a pillow over my head. “I’m going to start smoking to celebrate.”

“Yeah right. You hack up a lung every time I dust the house.”

I threw the pillow but made sure to miss. “Vape then.” 

“Do whatever you want, you’re eighteen now, Ethan. Just remember now I can legally evict you if you displease me. Come eat your breakfast or you’re going to be late for school.”

My mom strolled out of my room, humming. Even though I ended up with my dad’s lanky frame, everybody said I took after my mom the most. Same light eyes and dark hair, same twitchy smile, same morbid sense of humor. That last part was on full display when I stumbled out of the room and almost tripped over a walker mom had left in the hallway. There was a little red bow on the device and a card in my mother’s crisp, crawling handwriting.

*Happy birthday my favorite and only son. Know that you are getting older, you’ll start to notice changes in your body. Primarily, your body will immediately start falling apart. Places you weren’t aware existed will begin to ache. So take this walker on your journey. ‘Cause you’re old.*   
*Love Mom.*  
*P.S.-OOOOooooolllllddd.*

Dad was already sitting at the table when I came down the hall. He was drinking coffee and reading an honest to God actual newspaper. And my mom called *me* old.

“Happy birthday, Ethan,” dad said, glancing up from the paper. “Did you know that now you’re eligible for the draft now?”

“So I’ve been told,” I said, sitting down. 

Mom slid my breakfast in front of me, then sat a chocolate cupcake with lemon icing down next to it, and kissed the top of my head. 

“We love you, kiddo,” she said. “Happy birthday.” 

There was a single candle burning on top. I blew it out, plucked it out, and licked the icing off of the bottom. 

“Lemon and chocolate,” my dad said, shaking his head. “Gross.” 

“Are you sure you’re not adopted?” mom asked. 

“Am I sure I…oh God. *Oh God*,” I put my hand to my mouth. “It would explain so much.” 

Mom stuck out her tongue. “Shut up. Eat up. Suit up for school.”

Twenty minutes later, I was showered, dressed, and heading out the door. Mom was getting ready for work while dad was cleaning up breakfast. He and I made eye contact as I climbed into my car. Dad winked. I smiled, pulled out of the driveway, and drove off toward the library to meet Hazel.

“What’s up, grandpa?” Hazel asked when I arrived. 

She was sitting on the low, brick retainer wall that separated the library’s parking lot from the tiny garden around the entrance. 

“You’re the third person to call me ‘old,’ this morning already,” I said, getting out of the car and stretching. “Be less original.”

Hazel hopped off the wall and tossed a slim package at me. I caught it and shook it.

“I didn’t bother to wrap the thing,” she said. “Sorry.” 

I popped off the lid. Inside of the plain box was a clear plastic bag with something beige and vinyl looking inside. I flipped over the bag, same the label, and *hrmmpffd.* 

“Really?” I asked. “An inflatable sex doll?”

Hazel shrugged. “Better than a non-inflatable sex doll, right? That’s just…that’s just plastic sheeting, if you think about it.” 

“I try not to. Thanks.” I tossed the box in the back of my car. “I’ll treasure it forever.”

Hazel grinned and then walked over and gave me a hug. “Happy birthday, dork.”

Her hair smelled like vanilla and lemon. Hazel was…well, Hazel was. She’d been my best friend since kindergarten when Joey DeMaco was pushing my face in the dirt under the swings and Hazel gave him a black eye for refusing to let me up. She was tall and slim and a nightmare on the soccer field. Her hair was blonde and her eyes matched her name and I’d loved her for about as long as I understood what that was.

I pulled back from the hug first. “Does the doll have a name?” 

“I think that’s for you to decide. But she does look friendly!”

“You’re not jealous?” I asked, trying to fix the kind of smile that was more *haha friendly joking* and less *your face makes me think of snow on Christmas*.

“We had our time and I wouldn’t want to ruin the memory.”

“We kissed once. On a dare at summer camp.”

Hazel dramatically fell towards me, forcing me to catch her. “You say that like it meant so little to you, darling. Whatever else, we’ll always have Camp Weasel Woods.”

“That was *not* the name of the camp,” I said, gently pushing her so she was standing. “Let’s go see some turtles and then you can buy me lunch.”

I followed Hazel into the library, breathing carefully, worried that she could hear my pulse slamming through my veins like a box of handgrenades tossed down a waterslide. 

The rest of the day was a pleasant blur. There were turtles and books, tacos, a walk through the forest, a moment that maybe could have been a kiss but wasn’t, dinner back home with my parents, actual non-gag gifts including a laptop for college, a slice of cake, and then bed. My mom reminded me before turning in that I technically didn’t turn eighteen until 11:42 pm that night since I was a quote, “long ass delivery who interrupted lunch but then  had to be dragged out with forceps and W-D40 just before midnight.”

All-in-all, a very good day. 

My head hit the pillow around 10 pm. I woke up sometime after, catapulted from a nightmare, sweating and shaking like I never have before. My room was dark and I scrambled for the light, not quite panicked but not able to stand much more darkness. My guts tightened when I clicked the switch but nothing happened. 

I tried again and again, trying to keep my breathing level. Then something unseen grabbed my wrist. The only reason I didn’t scream was because my throat locked up. What came out was a cross between a yelp and a wheeze. 

The thing released my wrist and I slid back until I hit the headboard. My first instinct was to scream for my mom and dad but before I could, something spoke.

*Happy birthday*, a voice said from the corner of my room. 

I couldn’t see anything in the blackness but the voice was almost familiar, like something I’d heard long ago but forgotten.

*Who’s there?* I tried to ask but it came out as not much more than another wheeze. Still, the creature seemed to understand the question.

*I don’t have long*, it told me. *The book will explain. Read the book. Learn from it. Protect it. Keep it.* **Keep. It.** *You can’t-*

The voice stopped and I got the impression it was listening or watching for something. There was a brief choking noise and a sound like a tree creaking against the wind and then my room felt empty. I reached for the lamp on my nightstand and this time it sparked to life. A 19-watt glow was never more welcome in the history of the world. My room was still draped with shadows but I could see there wasn’t anyone else visible.

*Closet,* I thought, guts squeezing again. *Under the bed*. 

“Wait,” I said out loud, physically restraining myself from jumping from my bed. “Just wait. Breath. Another nightmare,” I closed my eyes for a long moment. “It was only-”

I ran out of words when I saw the book propped up on my desk. It was large and red and I was absolutely sure it had not been there when I went to sleep. The thing radiated a strangeness, a sense of belonging elsewhere. It was like walking into a restaurant and seeing a car parked in the lobby. 

My wrist throbbed, pulling my attention away from the book long enough for me to notice the marks. There were four slim lines, black as campfire ash, standing out against my skin. I turned my arm over and saw a fifth along with a smudge connecting them all.

A handprint. It was already beginning to blister. 

That’s when I finally screamed for my mom and dad.

My parents got the basics of my story when they came running from their bedroom and I met them in the hall. Both my thoughts and my words were…*scrambled* would be a charitable description, I guess, but they understood that I was upset so they brought me back to the kitchen and sat me down. 

After a glass of water and several darting glances at the hallway, I told them about the visitor and the book, then I showed them my arm. The handprint stood out like a corpse on a rug, though the burn was somehow already peeling down to new, pink skin. Neither of my parents said a word until I was finished. Then they shared a look, quick and quiet, and mom walked back towards my bedroom. For some reason, that scared me almost as much as the voice in my room.

“Are you going to let her go alone?” I demanded. 

My dad nodded. “Yeah. If there’s anything back there, your mom can handle it better than either of us, Ethan.”

Mom returned after a few minutes. She was holding the red book at arm's length like it was an animal she’d caught and needed to throw outside.

“Damn,” my dad said. “I knew we should have told him.” 

“Maybe,” mom said, sitting down with us, gingerly placing the book in the middle of the table. “Probably. But you know my parents always said the book seemed half-aware of the world. If we talked about it, then it might-”

“Hey, uh, the fuck?” I interrupted.

“Don’t use that kind of language around your mom,” my dad said, but he wasn’t looking at me, only at the book.

“Yeah, don’t fucking curse,” mom added. “...not counting tonight. Tonight, I get it.” 

“Can you both just please tell me what’s going on?” I asked. “You’re starting to freak me out.”

They shared that look again and dad stood up. He came back with three glasses and a bottle of wine.

“Don’t tell child protective services,” he said, sliding me a nearly-full cup.

“They don’t give a shit, he’s eighteen.” Mom drained her glass and poured another. She looked at me over the brim. “Ethan, this is going to sound crazy. You’re going to think your dad and I are messing with you. I promise we’re not. Understand?”

“Yeah. Okay. Serious time. Game faces on. Just tell me.”

Mom sighed. “Ethan, the book on the table is a spellbook. And you’re a witch.”

We sat there in silence for a long time.

“What?” I asked.

“A witch,” mom repeated. “Like, I mean, like a *witch* witch. Magic. Spells. Cats. What are they teaching you in that school?”

“But I’m…a dude.”

“It’s a unisex thing,” dad chimed in. “Not really tied to, uh, anything else.” 

He gestured vaguely.

“Just your blood,” mom added. “From my side.”

I picked at my burn. It didn’t hurt anymore but the peeling was starting to drive me nuts. I studied my mom and dad’s faces for a while, trying to figure out if this was all some weird joke to them. They looked back at me, eyes kind but anxious, and I felt another wave of fear. They were serious.

“Oh shit,” I said, drinking some wine. “Oh actual shit.” 

Mom put her hand over mine. “We’re sorry we never said anything. The book…sometimes it skips generations. It skipped my dad–your grandfather. It skipped me. Your father and I, we hoped that it was done and finished with your grandmother.”

I finished the wine. “You could have told me anyway, though, right? Just in case.”

“Not knowing any of it was our best chance at protecting you,” dad said. “The little bit your mom and I know about the book, if you talk about it, you might get its attention. It would be putting a target on your back.” 

I stared at the book sitting between us on the table. Up close, it looked innocent enough; red leather, about the size of a Bible but slimmer, with no lettering or designs of any kind on the cover. It didn’t seem so out of place now that I was close to it. In fact, just the opposite. It felt like family. It felt like home. I started to reach for it.

“**No**,” my mom yelled, grabbing my arm. “It’s trouble and you have to get rid of it.” 

I felt a little flare of anger. “Wait. Just wait. Let’s slow the roll, okay? You’re telling me that magic is real, and…what? The book’s magic? I’m magic?”

“Yes,” dad said, “but that book is dangerous.”

“It belonged to your grandmother, right?” I asked my mom. “My great-grandmother? Why would you want me to get rid of it? Isn’t it like a family heirloom? Don’t you want to know more?”

Mom stared down into her wine glass. “I don’t, Ethan. Your grandmother told me stories, and showed me a few pages; she always hoped I’d inherit the book and I pretended I wanted to, just to make her happy. But I’ve never wanted it. It’s *wrong*. Don’t you feel it? There’s something unnatural.”

“Sure,” I replied, “that’s what magic is though, isn’t it? You just said you’ve only seen a few pages so what if-”

My mom looked up at me and held my eye. “Ethan, honey, I don’t know how to explain it but I know that book is bad. Bad for the family, bad for you. Your grandmother loved that book more than her own kids or anyone else on this planet. I don’t want to ever see you become like that.”

“There’s more,” dad said. “Tell him, Kara.”

She sighed. “My grandmother told me that if I did get the book after she was gone that I’d have to be ready to protect it. That certain people might come looking for it. Dangerous people.”

“Who?” I asked. “And when?”

“I don’t know the answer to either.” She finished her second glass of wine. “I’m sorry if your father and I have scared you. It’s just that we’re scared, too. This is a lot to put on somebody in the middle of the night. I know one thing for certain: it’s your choice. You have to be the one to accept the book or to get rid of it. And, honestly, if you do choose to reject it, I’m not sure what we do with it. But I promise we’ll figure it out together, okay? We love you.”

My dad nodded and gripped my shoulder.

“I love you both, too,” I said, slowly. “But you said it’s my choice?”

That look again between my parents like they were speaking in some language no one else could hear. 

“Yes,” my mom replied after a pause. “It’s your choice. We can’t make it for you. Why don’t you…why don’t you take the book back into your room and-”

“*Kara*,” my dad hissed.

Mom ignored him. “Take the book, read a *few* pages. All from the front. And promise that if you start feeling sick or anything weird happens, you’ll stop and call for us and we’ll come in like the fucking cavalry, okay?”

“Are you sure?” dad asked. “At least, maybe he should read it here at the table.”

Mom shook her head. “I think he’ll want some privacy and I understand. And, the truth is, wherever he reads the book, it’s going to be equally as dangerous.”

I suppressed a shiver at her last words but nodded like I figured a decisive, newly-minted adult would.

“Thank you,” I said, scooping up the book. “Thank you for trusting me.”

That was nearly an hour ago. I’ve spent that time here in my bedroom with every light on trying to work up the nerve to open the book. I can hear mom and dad; they’re still in the kitchen, whisper-arguing so I can only catch a sentence here and there when I really focus. I think my dad wants to take the book outside to burn it. 

My mom doesn’t think the book will let them, and even if it did, I need to be the one to make the choice or it’ll just keep coming back. 

Christ. 

Not how I pictured ending my eighteenth birthday. 

The book is sitting on my desk and every fiber of me wants to open it. But a little voice in my head that sounds suspiciously like my mom keeps warning me it’s not too late to walk away, to pretend that the world is normal and boring and safe. 

But I’m not sure that’s what I want. 

I’m writing this and posting it so that there’s at least a record out there for whoever will believe it. Just in case, you know…in case things go bad.

I think I’m going to go read the first page, now.
