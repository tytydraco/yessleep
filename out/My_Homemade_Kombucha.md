It is happening to me again. Having to sit all alone in a damp room while listening to all those people having fun right outside the thin cardboard door. I should seriously consider decorating these two square meters as I have been spending so much time stuck in here lately. Some calming colors could help alleviate my anxiety, which usually sends me here in the first place. A diffuser with some nice essential oils could be quite useful as well. But why stop at that? What about a lava lamp? I always wanted to have a lava lamp. Would a bookshelf fit in here? I am sure it would. If I cannot get one at IKEA I could have it custom made. Sure, the carpenter may consider me a freak, but I would not care. What does it matter what people think when books can keep me company? Books definitely do not care. 

A sudden knock on the door interrupted my silent contemplation that was either way leading absolutely nowhere. As a chronic procrastinator I would never do those things. Plus, I definitely care what people think about me. A little bit too much even. Courtesy of my nervous constitution. Or can it be vice versa? Whatever, let’s get back to the knock on the door. 

“Jamie, are you in there?” Asked my amazing girlfriend, Alex, that organized the lovely surprise birthday party happening mere centimeters away from my lonely enclave. 

“Yep!”

“Do you think it was the cake? I swear I told them it has to be 100% dairy free!” 

“Did you ask them to make it gluten free as well?” 

“Shit! I forgot about the gluten! I am so sorry!” 

“No worries, it is not your fault. I should have realized the cake had gluten. It was suspiciously tasty.” 

I was very mild with her as gluten was the newest addition to a gradually expanding list of stuff I should not eat. Plus, I am only intolerant, not allergic, so it is not like she could accidentally kill me. I also may or may not have self-diagnosed. 

“Still, I am really sorry!... Babe, do you think you will be long? There is a small queue forming. Or do you think it could be an all-nighter? Should I send everybody home?” 

“No no, I will be out in a minute, but they should wait at least for one more. Maybe we could put a diffuser in here…. Wait! On second thought, you could send everybody home, just so that I don’t collapse with shame.” 

“Stop it! You know your friends are understanding. Nobody will make you feel uncomfortable. They are all here to celebrate you. Now get out, so that we can give you the gifts!... And so others can use the restroom”. She said the last phrase a little softer. Either way, with those words, I finally managed to flush the toilet and escape the shackles of my personal prison, praying I will not be sentenced yet again. Or at the very least, not too soon. 

Incidentally, the first gift I opened was a diffuser with a fancy collection of essential oils. Initially I thought that one of my friends is a mindreader, but gradually an apparent theme emerged after I opened more and more gifts. Fancy teas containing digestive herbs? Check! All sorts of vitamins and minerals? Check! Too many cookbooks tailored for various intolerances? Check! Even some healing crystals? Check! Check! Check! What about a lava lamp that I actually and explicitly asked for? Nowhere in sight! 

Before getting irrationally angry over this nonsense, I paused, took a deep breath, and reached for the last unopened gift. On top of it, there was written in large letters: “BE CAREFUL, YOU DO NOT WANT TO BREAK THIS! PLEASE, DON’T TURN IT AROUND EITHER”. I took hold of it with caution and immediately felt that it was made of glass and containing some kind of a liquid. Just like a lava lamp, but unfortunately for me, it was not lava lamp shaped. Also judging by the smell, I could definitely say that it was something totally different. And that, indeed, I would not want to break it or the sour aroma would linger in our apartment for the following decades. It was putrid, to say the least. It was also not covered in anything but a large tea towel secured by a rubber band. As I gently lifted the piece of cloth, I saw that the thing looked only slightly less disgusting than it smelled. If I had to describe it in two words, it would have to be a “slimy sponge”. The sponge was floating on top of a golden liquid. There were bubbles rushing from bottom to the top trying to escape squeezing around the stenchy abomination. 

When I was done with my careful visual examination, I found the courage to ask with as light a tone of voice as I could muster: “What the hell is this?” 

“A kombucha!” The apparent gift giver, Helen, exclaimed with excitement. 

“A what?” Was my slightly inconsiderate response. 

“You know, a kombucha. It is a drink that contains a lot of probiotics. Some even claim that it has antibiotic properties. I thought it may help with your digestive issues.” 

Way to be frank, Helen!” I uttered with an irritated tone. 

“You know, I just want you to get better. I have been drinking kombucha for years now, and I feel great. Even though I had some issues of my own before.” was Helen’s kind reaction. She is one of my oldest friends and has a lot of patience with me. 

“I know, I am sorry, I am just sensitive about my toilet habits.” 

“No worries, I understand” 

“Anyway, what do I do with it? It does not seem like I can simply pour it into a glass and drink it.” 

“Oh no! This is kombucha in making. You see the mushroom looking thing on the top. That is a kombucha scoby. It is made of helpful bacteria and yeast turning a sweet tea base into the healthy drink. Every one or two weeks, depending on how strong you want the kombucha to be, you need to exchange the liquid. Pour out the kombucha ideally into some glass bottles and drink it regularly after meals. And the new liquid that comes in with the scoby needs to be a very sweet green or black tea. When you handle the scoby and make the new tea you need to make sure that everything is super clean. A contaminated kombucha could harm you even more than a proper kombucha could help you.”

“Hold on a second, contaminated with what?” 

“Just mold, as far as I know. But no worries, it has never happened to me. Plus mold is very easy to spot on a kombucha scoby. Just watch out for dry white or green powdery looking round spots.” 

“Sure, that seems easy enough. I should be able to distinguish mold. So, how did you even get this scoby thing?”

“I would normally give you a part of mine, but I did not have enough, so I got it off a website. I use it quite often to exchange or buy homemade goods. I got my sourdough starter from there.” 

“Oh okay, so it should be reliable. It is not likely to be contaminated already, right?” Again, my nervous nature got the best of me here. 

“No, no, it should not be, " I checked it. I also bought a mulberry jam from the same person and I am totally fine. Plus, it was delicious. So the person seems to be reliable in their home production.”

“Cool.” I felt that I should express some gratitude at this point. So I finally muttered… “Thank you for your thoughtful gift, Helen!”

“You are the most welcome!” 

“What do you all think, should we play some board games now?” Was Alex’s question that finally marked the end of this year’s birthday gift giving. 

\*\*\*

Just as Helen had instructed, I was taking proper care of my kombucha. With each batch, I made more and more of this golden liquid. Finally, I arrived to a point where it was too much just for me and Alex to drink. As I realized that my digestion really had improved, I decided to start sharing it with my friends so that they can reap the benefits as well. Sure, it was an acquired taste, but after a while, a lot of people became reliant on me for their biweekly dose of goodness. I also started experimenting with second fermentation to make my kombucha tastier. As I learned on my own, when making kombucha, you do not need to do a second fermentation, but you should certainly do it if you want to add some flavor and carbonation. You do so by putting fruit either fresh, dried, pureed, basically in any form really, or even some dried herbs, in separate bottles with the kombucha liquid after the first fermentation. You leave it for 3 or so days, then take out the liquid again, and voila, you have your final product. 

Gradually, my kombucha got better and better until it became so good, I began to consider starting my own business focused on this magical potion. I also honestly became quite obsessed with my homebrewing. So it may be quite understandable that when I got an offer to go to South Asia for a month for a work trip, it made me quite uncomfortable to a point of not wanting to go at all. Alex, as the logical one in our couple, persuaded me that my reasons for not going are not understandable, rather completely ridiculous. She also promised to take good care of my little obsession. 

In the end, going on the work trip turned out to be a great decision. Not only did I enjoy myself, but I also managed to secure an unholy amount of various herbs and spices to use in my personal kombucha experimentation. 

Everything went great, I felt like I reaped the benefits of my trip for weeks after my return. I felt better and better after trying new and new combinations of herbs and spices for each batch. I bet turmeric helped with my inflammation, fennel and coriander with my overall digestion, ashwagandha with my mental state… or at least the placebo effect did.

It was all amazing, well, until I reached for the mysterious herb bought at a small market, when I felt courageous or in retrospect perhaps cocky enough to up my experimentation. The kind lady that sold it to me promised it helps achieve longevity. Her claims were backed up by the numerous centennials I saw at her small town. She swore they all brew their morning tea with this herb. I was ecstatic to finally try it, wishfully saving the best for last, but Alex did not share my sentiment. 

“Are you sure it is safe? I have never seen anything like it.” she asked me cautiously. 

“Of course, I saw its effect with my own eyes.” was my excessively confident response. 

“But it freaking glows in the dark.”

“So? Loads of things do.”

“And are you sure that these black spots were there when you bought it? It does look kind of like mold.”

“Yes, I am sure.” I answered, trying to assure her, even though, with my ADHD brain, I had no way to remember how the herb looked already almost 3 months ago… “Besides, the herb is dried, how could it catch mold?”. 

“Okay, okay, try it if you wish, but it will not go near my mouth!” was her final exclamation. 

\*\*\*

After three days, the second fermentation was finally over, and I was able to try my new healing potion. Which is a fitting name as the liquid has a bright hue. If you are wondering, Alex was still reasonably suspicious. 

“Are you sure you want to drink it? It looks positively repugnant.” she asked. 

“Yes, I have been doing this for some time, I am sure nothing bad will happen to me.”

“Well, do as you wish!” She abruptly ended our conversation once again.

I started wondering whether my Kombucha obsession can cause issues within our relationship, but I attributed it to my anxiety and quickly pushed it out of my mind. Besides, I knew I was right, after drinking it for a few days, I was feeling better than ever before. So, I decided to use part of the batch to start a new one and put the scoby inside it after adding loads of sweet green tea. 

This is where my suspicion slowly started, as the scoby, the weird slimy fungus looking thing, was growing way too fast. I noticed this after one week, when it basically escaped its glass enclosure. But still, I simply moved it into a bigger glass jar convincing myself it could be the result of the herb’s life giving properties. Also, for some strange reason, I felt compelled to do it. I needed to make more kombucha for me and for my friends. The miracle had to be shared and I needed to consume more. 

At this point, I was convinced I could not survive without my golden liquid. When for any reason, I could not access it at my usual moment, I wasn't able to think of anything else. Feeling it move slowly down my throat was all that occupied my mind. Alex hadn’t seemed like herself lately, either. Her smiles were getting less frequent, her once-boisterous laughter now a whisper when I told her about the latest batch. But I brushed it off, attributing it to the stress of my brewing experiments. The drink was making me feel better, she had to appreciate it.

Soon, I had to leave for another short work trip. Despite Alex’s previous protests, I still believed she would care for my little obsession diligently. I also took enough of the precious liquid for the entire duration. Even though I was religiously drinking it with each meal, after a few days, I started feeling a little bit sick, so I had to cut my trip short, mainly because I needed to make a new batch. I was certain that the one I brought got spoiled during my travels, that must have been the reason for my sickness. This also made me glad, as I felt I needed to check on Alex, since she stopped responding to my messages. When exactly did she stop? Was she angry with me? 

\*\*\*

When I got home, I called for her, but there was no reaction. It was weird, because, at that time, she should be home. I looked around everywhere, but she was nowhere to be found. Instead, when I finally reached the kitchen, I was welcomed with a shocking scene. My kombucha scoby was enormous, it was growing everywhere, even climbing the walls. But I did not feel like taking care of it at that point as I needed to run to the bathroom to drive the porcelain bus, or vomit, if you are not catching my drift. I stayed there for a couple of hours until I collapsed from exhaustion directly on the floor. 

When I finally awoke, several hours must have passed, as it was pitch black outside. My brain was foggy like never before, but I was eerily drawn to the kitchen, I needed my dose. After stumbling there, I had the sudden urge to drop to my knees and gorge myself on the kombucha scoby. I know, I should have resisted, but there was no rationality in my brain at that point, I simply couldn’t stop myself, I had to consume my medicine. 

I was awakened from my haze by loud knocking on my door. Even though I did not want to leave my scoby. It sounded like my door would be broken down soon. To my despair, I had no choice but to move. When I opened it, I saw all of my friends, AKA kombucha customers, frantically trying to get inside, basically yelling at me one over another. 

“Where were you?!”

“Where is my Kombucha?!”

“I need more!”

They rushed right past me towards the mother scoby in the kitchen. And just as I did, only seconds before, they also started feeding on the slimy substance like wild animals. My insatiable hunger gave me no choice, but to join them. To be honest, I was in no way battling it. I was ecstatically feeding on the cold substance that brought the warmest feeling to my core. I think, for a moment, I even forgot about Alex. But soon she reminded herself to me in the most horrifying way possible. 

As I was tearing more and more from the delicious substance, I finally stumbled upon something tough, something that should not be there. As I got a portion of my senses back, I realised it was a hand, scrubbed clean of meat. Only the shiny white of a bone stayed. Well, I wished that was the case. On one of the fingers, there was a silver promise ring I gave to Alex.
