I live alone in a duplex in one of those quiet neighborhoods where every lawn looks fake, all perfectly green and mowed like someone cloned them. From the outside, it feels safe. Normal.

It started small. One of my paintings went missing from the wall. I figured it was my cousin — he’s a brat and likes to take random stuff when family visits. But then weeks passed, and more disappeared. My family hadn’t been over in months.

I thought maybe someone broke in, but why would they steal a few prints and leave my laptop, my TV, my watch? None of it made sense.

I tried to forget about it.

Then came the night I couldn’t.

I woke up to a crash in the kitchen — not a creak or a bump, but a heavy bang. Usually I’d bury my head under the blanket and tell myself it was nothing, but for some reason that night I got up. I went to the stairs and halfway down I stopped.

The sofa cushion in the living room dipped and slowly rose back up, like someone had just stood up from it. A second later, I heard the sound of bare feet scuffling across the kitchen tile.

My heart sank. I wanted to run upstairs and lock the door, but I couldn’t move. I just waited for whoever it was to step out.

No one did.

When I finally worked up the nerve to look, the kitchen was empty. No broken dishes, no fallen pan. Nothing at all — except for that sofa cushion, still rounded, like someone had been sitting there minutes before.

I called the cops. They found nothing. My parents told me I just wasn’t used to living alone. My brother laughed it off. I tried to do the same.

And for a while, I almost believed it.

Until the fridge moved.

I was heading downstairs for a midnight snack when I saw it: the fridge sliding a few inches out, then back into the wall, like someone was behind it pulling.

I pulled it forward, and the smell hit me first — sour, metallic, rotten. Behind it was a perfect square hole, the edges slimy with brown sludge. I froze, but instead of running like I should’ve, I grabbed a flashlight and went in.

There was a staircase leading down, the steps soft and half-rotted. My light hit the walls — and there they were.

All of my missing paintings. Hung carefully in rows like some kind of underground gallery.

I should’ve turned back right then. Instead I kept going.

The tunnel twisted, then another staircase rose up. Another hole at the top. Another ring of brown sludge. Another fridge.

My neighbor’s fridge.

I pushed it aside, hands shaking. And there he was.

Sitting in a chair, back swollen and blistered. A stapler in one hand. A razor blade in the other. He turned when the fridge opened, and that’s when I saw it.

His face was gone. In its place, stapled to the raw flesh, was one of my portraits.

I stumbled back, gagging, but I couldn’t look away. His chest rose and fell, wheezing, but his hands moved carefully, adjusting the photo on his skin like it was his own face.

Then he raised a gun. Pressed it to his chest.

And pulled the trigger.

The blast echoed through the tunnels. He slumped over, but even in death, the photo stayed in place.

I stood there for what felt like hours, flashlight shaking in my hand, the only thought in my head looping again and again: Why?

But I never got an answer.

The cops said they found nothing in his house. Nothing strange about him before it happened. No reason at all.

Still, every time I go to the kitchen at night, I catch myself staring at the fridge, waiting to see it move again.
