Our task is to get to Cavern Creek, and we are going in blind. 

The task came about on an ordinary April day.

 It was contained in the classic, yellow, gaudy envelope (*as are all the tasks*). 

It was delivered to me personally by my ordinary secretary (*as are all the tasks*).

And it was sealed with a garish company insignia (yep).

 By tradition, I unsealed the envelope with the standard, company-provided, paper knife. 

I poured myself a not-so-standard, not-so-company-provided, glass of MacAllen whiskey. 

I took a swig. 

Sliced the stamped insignia. 

Unfolded the letter. 

Turned my eyes to that familiar, spidery blue ink that was scrawled across the dreaded page. 

It read the following: 

**Project GASH** 

*Dear G,* 

*Get to Cavern Creek.* 

*Arrive tomorrow at noon. Why don’t you stay for a night?* 

*Bring S and H.*

 *She will come for you at night. Do not bring or emit any form of light.* 

*Get out before Sunday sunrise.* 

*A* 

To quickly explain for those confused… 

The letters are our names—randomly assigned allocations. I’ve been G ever since I joined the place. I’ve also worked with S and H for going on a decade. I have no idea what their real names are (though I highly and often suspect that H is called Bob—he just has that “Bob look” about him—you know?).

A slight tangent, but I’ve heard that my colleague ‘X’ is the best of the best. Apparently, they only bring him out when jobs go wrong. Thankfully, I’ve never met him. I imagine he’s really called Ken or something, to entertain myself. 

Getting back on track—the envelopes always have two familiar quirks. You’ve probably worked this out already, but I’ll explain in any case:

***First:*** the gaudy envelopes are always sent by one of our five bosses. They are called: A, E, I, O, and U. People call them the Vowels (creative). 

As far as I’m aware, the Vowels don’t do any fieldwork, though I assume they used to back in the day. I’ve met each of them only once, during my initiation into the company. 

The encounter was… unsettling, to say the least. Each of them had their own peculiarities that seemed almost rehearsed, as if they were playing roles in some twisted play. 

A, for example, had this unnerving habit of never blinking. The entire time we spoke, his eyes were wide open, unflinching, even when I deliberately made motions to test him. 

E, on the other hand, spoke in a rhythm that matched the ticking of the grandfather clock in the room. I could never tell if it was deliberate or just some bizarre coincidence, but every word he spoke synced perfectly with each tick. 

I was too new then to question these oddities, too eager to impress to let the strange behaviors of my bosses faze me. But now, years later, these memories haunt me, lingering at the edges of my mind whenever I receive one of their tasks. 

U frankly gives me the creeps, though he's become a trust friend of sorts. I feel like I’m seeing out of the corner of my eye. The others talk about U like a ghost, someone who’s there but never really there. Just a whisper, a shadow. 

Sometimes, when I’m alone in my office, I swear I can hear U humming—a low, almost imperceptible tune that used to make the hair on the back of my neck stand up. Now, it's strangely comforting. 

***Second:*** the second point you need to know about the envelopes is that the project name is always an anagram assembled by the letter allocations of those working on the project (i.e., I’m G and this time I’m on a job with A, S, and H—hence, Project GASH).

I once worked on the 15-man job: Project UNCOPYRIGHTABLE. It was terrible and mainly involved paperwork. 

I’ve heard rumors of an 18-man job, but I call bullshit. There are 26 employees and no repeat letters—is there an 18-letter word? 

Regardless, the point of this tangent is to say that I’m pretty familiar with these jobs. I’d like to say familiar to the extent that they rarely trouble me. But this time was different. For some reason not known to me, this particular task has seriously unnerved me. 

Sure, I’ve been given weird instructions before. In Project GEM (a truly great initiative led by E), I had to “imagine” that I was a tree for two hours every Sunday—otherwise, I’d be killed by a screaming banshee named ‘Doris’. 

On Project GRAB (led by A), I had to jump off the Elizabeth Tower (i.e., Big Ben) as the clock struck 12. 

The point I’m trying to make is that Project GASH has pretty clear instructions—and we’re taught, “follow the instructions, or you’ll die.” Yet, I’m really uneasy. 

As a result, I’ve decided to finally break my silence on the work I do and document this particular experience (strength in numbers and all of that). I obviously can’t bring my phone with me on this mission, as that emits light, so I’ll be recording a transcript. This will wire directly to my previously mentioned ‘ordinary’ secretary (sorry Emma), who will type up the account of my time in Cavern Creek.

 I’m going to go and find S and H. I’ll enter into this log shortly. W

We’re going to Cavern Creek. 

***11pm - same day*** 

Well, needless to say, S and H weren’t best pleased with the situation. 

“Don’t emit light? Where the hell is Cavern Creek anyway?” S hissed. Her fingers were tapping a nervous rhythm on the table, a habit she had whenever things got tense.

 “Yep, no phones, no torches, no matchsticks. No damn idea where Cavern Creek is,” I said, the sarcasm barely hiding my own unease. 

I noticed my watch had stopped ticking. I shook it, but the hands remained frozen at 11:07 PM.

 H ran a hand through his hair. “Guys… my hair’s falling out.” 

“You’re just stressed,” I muttered, but I didn’t believe it. Not really. I added a jab in any case:

“It’s because you look like a Bob and Bob’s go bald. Deal with it.” 

“No, seriously—look.” 

He wasn’t kidding. Clumps of his hair had started trailing behind him as he walked. My stomach churned, but I forced a smile. Side effects were part of the job, but this? This was… fast. 

We decided to meet at my place before heading out in the morning. It was supposed to be a quick rendezvous, but the atmosphere felt heavy, oppressive even. We sat around my small living room, each of us lost in our thoughts. 

“What do you think she is?” S asked out of nowhere, her voice barely a whisper.

H looked at her like she’d grown another head. “Who?” 

“The one who’s supposed to come for us at night,” she clarified, staring intently at the note. 

I hadn’t even considered it. The line had stuck out, sure, but I’d been so focused on the logistics of getting to Cavern Creek that I hadn’t let the implications sink in. 

“Probably just another one of those tasks meant to freak us out,” I said, trying to sound more confident than I felt. “Like that time we had to convince a group of tourists that the London Eye was haunted.”

But my words didn’t seem to comfort anyone, least of all myself. We were all thinking the same thing: this time felt different. The fact that the Vowels hadn’t given us more information—no explanation, no background, just orders—was unsettling in a way I couldn’t quite put into words. 

“Do you think X would know what’s going on?” H asked suddenly, breaking the silence that had fallen over us. 

“X? The legendary fixer?” S scoffed, though there was a hint of nervousness in her voice. “Nobody even knows who X is. For all we know, X might not even exist.” 

“He exists,” I said, more firmly than I felt. “They only bring him in when things go wrong. When they can’t fix something themselves. But…” 

“But what?” S prompted, leaning in. 

I hesitated. “But what if X isn’t what we think? I’ve heard some… strange stories.” 

“Strange like how?” H’s eyes widened. “You think X is some kind of monster?” 

“Maybe,” I said, shrugging. “Or maybe it’s just another way the Vowels mess with us. A myth to keep us in line.” 

“Well, whatever X is, I hope he stays far away from this one,” S muttered, looking down at the letter again. “I don’t want any more surprises.” 

We lapsed into silence again, each of us lost in our own thoughts. The clock on my wall ticked loudly, marking the time that seemed to stretch endlessly. The conversation about X had done little to ease the tension—if anything, it only made the atmosphere heavier, more oppressive. 

Eventually, H left, clutching his hat like it was a lifeline. S stayed a bit longer, but her silence was telling. When she finally left, I was alone with my thoughts. 

And then it happened. 

As I was about to turn in for the night, the lights in my apartment flickered. Just for a second, but enough to make me freeze in place. When they steadied, I shook my head, trying to convince myself it was nothing—just a power surge, maybe. But then I heard it. A low hum, almost a tune, barely audible, coming from nowhere and everywhere at once. My blood ran cold as I recognized it: the same melody U had hummed during my initiation, the one I'd heard a lot since, but never in my own house. 

As I stood there, the hum grew louder, more insistent. I suddenly felt very exposed, vulnerable. 

Then, I heard a voice—a whisper, soft but clear. 

“G..... Gusssssshhhhhh...."

I couldn't move, I couldn't speak. 

"Gush."

What the fuck. 

"you have to go, to Cavern Creek, because the letter has been written, but it was not as it was intended.”

The words were unmistakable. It was U. The voice was calm, almost soothing, but it carried a weight that made my chest tighten. There was a pause, and then U spoke again, more faintly this time, as if retreating back into the shadows. 

“You are a letter in a word, G. The word is already spoken. The ink is dry. The shadow will follow. But remember, G—light cannot reach where shadows are born.

"Not A - but U. Be safe..."

The hum stopped as suddenly as it started, leaving behind a suffocating silence. I stood there, staring at the dark window, trying to process what I’d just heard. U’s warning was cryptic, like a riddle wrapped in a riddle. Had A gone rogue? Was this U's project? It's not common for there to be infighting between the Vowels.

Forcing myself to move, I grabbed my things and headed to bed, determined to ignore the gnawing dread in my gut. The old wooden floor creaked beneath my feet as I made my way to the bedroom. My mind was racing, trying to make sense of U’s words, trying to piece together what I could possibly be walking into at Cavern Creek. But sleep didn’t come easy. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw something—a shadowy figure, indistinct yet looming, hovering just beyond the edge of my vision. 

My thoughts drifted back to our conversation about X. What if X was something more than just a man? What if X was the shadow that U mentioned, the thing that would follow us? 

I turned over, trying to shake the image from my mind, but as I did, I felt a strange sensation—a tickling against my cheek. I reached up, fingers brushing something fine and soft. 

I sat up slowly, and as I turned on the dim light beside my bed, my stomach twisted. There, on the pillow, lay a small cluster of hair. My hair. I picked up a strand, staring at it in disbelief. My hand trembled as I brought it closer to my face, running the thin fibers between my fingers. It wasn’t just one or two strands—it was enough to make a small pile. Just like H. 

U’s warning echoed in my mind for the remainder of the night:  “Light cannot reach where shadows are born.” I flicked off the light and shut my eyes, in the darkness that was closing in around me. The shadow was coming, and there was no turning back now. We were heading to Cavern Creek in the morning. And whatever awaited us there… I wasn’t sure if we’d ever come back. The night stretched on, my mind a restless storm of thoughts. Eventually, exhaustion took over, and I slipped into a fitful sleep, my dreams haunted by the shadowy figure and the cryptic hum of U’s tune. 

Tomorrow, we’d face whatever lay in wait. And maybe—just maybe—I’d finally meet X (but I know that would mean trouble)

We're going to Cavern Creek. We're going in blind. Will update tomorrow.
