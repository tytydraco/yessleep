It was a Sunday at the start of summer. My parents had gotten tickets to a concert in a city near my grandma's town. So they thought about sending us for a sleepover, that is me and my little sister. I was the older sibling and had always agreed on sleepovers at grandma's, but my sister is there so she can use our grandfathers computer for unlimited games and such. My sister and I had to sleep in our childhood rooms, but my sister insisted that I would sleep in her room because she is afraid of a gap in near the bed and that a spider will bite her. After multiple minutes of bartering and arguing I gave up and decided to sleep in her room and she'll sleep in mine.

The room was my first ever room that I slept in since a baby. It was on the second floor and because of that it had a right triangular structure. The left wall from the door was straight and high being about 2 meters. The right wall was tilted on an angle because my room was on a side where the roof is. My parents put the bed in the place where it was very narrow so there'll be space for a table and a wardrobe. There was a window showing the street and the neighbors which was the only way to get sunlight in the room. Now that I walked through my childhood I needed to unpack and change my clothes to a more comforting type. When I started to notice a couple of things.

I saw a lot of wallpaper ripped. "It must be the glue in the wallpaper ageing" I thought to myself. I see more stuff like a couple of holes in the wallpaper. Like they were scratched off or even forced to rip by something. I also noticed some dents in the ceiling like something was punching the ceiling. That was suspicious for me but I brushed it off like it's just the materials ageing or the house was like this the whole time and I just saw these details.

The day went as usual. I talked to my grandmother while she was cooking a soup and noodles. During that time my grandfather went in to our garden and once he got back he went to his and gramma's bedroom and sleep. And after a couple of conversations later the noodles are ready and after microwaving a premade chicken from the fridge I yelled for my sister to go eat. We ate and then I went back to my room for the time. Then I hear sudden noises. It was slight banging. I then grabbed my phone and went into our garden.

Hours later I went back home to eat supper. It was around 9 PM. I sat in the living room and grandma brought in soup. I was very grateful and started to watch the TV and eat it. I heard my sister having problems agreeing on my grandma's terms. She yelled something like: "I don't want to brush my teeth with that tooth paste!" - or something like that. I brushed it off and watched TV until 10 PM.

At 10 PM I was tired and felt as my eyes were closing. So I've decided to turn the TV off and go to sleep. I tried to walk slowly on the steppes because they were old and they squeak a lot. Slowly but surely I went to the second floor. I put my phone in to my charger and went to brush my teeth and wash my face with soap and water. After my nightly routine I went to my room, closed the door and prayed. Then pulled the curtains and turned of the lights. And quickly laid in bed to get warmth and comfort. I can recall sleeping for two hours until I heard something. Banging...

The banging happened once per I'd say 1.5 minutes. The banging was weak. It feels like the thing that is banging doesn't have the strength make loud one. I felt slightly afraid. But I was very stubborn and just turned on an other side and drifted apart. But something else happened... Somewhere at 2 AM I started to hear little moans. They sounded very weak. Like the thing that made these sounds was asking for help but it can't say things. That was the last straw. I tried and tried to stop the sounds by banging on the wall near the ceiling. I felt more horrified and slept on the couch.

The next day at 5 AM I decided to investigate. I got a ladder and placed it near the attic. Before entering I grabbed a knife and I put on a headlight. And I entered. There was nothing... I checked everywhere - the overly open space that narrow spaces, there was nothing, but I noticed one thing that shocked me. There was a hole in the roof. When I noticed it I used myself for scale and it was nearly my size. I didn't want to make any more ruckus so I went down the ladder back to the second floor. That was my most scary encounter ever.
