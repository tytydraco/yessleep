The Sticks 

(Part one)


"In need of money? Having a tough time in this game we call life? Watch my animals. For a week, maybe less, as of right now I'm unsure of how long I'll be gone. Job pays 3000 dollars. 10 cats, 7 dogs and a pin of pigs. Food and booze are included. More details on phone if your serious about this."

The last part included the phone number to call.
Wow. I thought.
Watch some animals for a week for 3k? 
That sounds like easy money. Too easy.

I'll call the number, but I don't expect to get the job. But then after the rush from the pay calmed, I realised that the location was undisclosed. The post did say more details over the phone. And when I called, the man who answered the phone, also answered all my questions. He said his name was vore. 

Its far. Really far from the town it was posted in, about a 4 hour drive, out in the deep country of Michigan. As there was no stores or gas station near his home, he offered to refill my gas when I got there, as he had according to him, plenty of the stuff on the property I could use to refill my car. On the phone, the man was still unsure how long he will be gone. But he assured me it wouldn't be longer than a week.

So. A week at the most, with food, gas and even alcohol thrown into the mix, for a nice payout just to watch and care for some cats, dogs And a few pigs. All for a solid 3000 dollars? I was of course ready and willing to do this. He said only a few called but turned the offer down because it was so far away. But not for me. Not for a few grand and a different set of mind that I could experience.

 
My life has been on autopilot for weeks since she left. It was a good thing for me to mix things up. I mean I miss the woods, and the country. So I guess you could say I was very excited for this small adventure in my life, i can't wait to meet all of the animals. 




The road seemed to keep stretching as I drove, no turns for the last two hours, just tree's left and right. but I knew it was the right road and direction. So I kept on driving. Gas is under a quarter of a tank. He better have that gas he talked about (even though I brought my own full can just incase.)

 The skies were darkening, and the tempature dropping steadily, it was the middle of April, and the forecast said tempature drops tonight to 45Â° with thunderstorms around 7:30 8:00 and stretch possibly into the morning. But that was the forecast from home. As the sun dropped, I couldn't help but feel uneasy as I kept driving through these dark dank freaky twisted woods. 

"Cmon, how much farther is this place?"
I exclaimed to myself, starting to get irritated after being on the road for so long.  

While driving, the land was still lit up enough to see decently into the woods, but farther back, left and right, it seeped darkness. Like the shadow of the woods was ready to consume it but the sun halted it's endeavor, for now. Soon the dark will have it's turn, and the dark will roll, and hopefully I can get there before that happens.


Some time later, Driving down the dark dirt road, only headlights shining the way, the blur of a white splotchy light creeped through the twigs and showing a bright light casting through the trees. when I pulled up to the property, relief settled in as I finally made it. 

While slowly turning into the short drive, vore, stood tall in front of a big tree. Right at the end of the short driveway. He had one hand up in a greeting posture and another in his pocket, with squinted eyes, he waved his hand a bit. I didn't expect him to be waiting outside in the dark for me. Kinda weird I thought, but moved passed it quickly. 

After parking and stepping put of my truck, it was time to meet vore face to face. 

"You finally made it!"
"Haha, I thought you got lost out there in those woods." Vore said as he reached down on the ground and picked up a lantern. Switching it on, it was a powerful light.

Vore was pretty tall, around 6'3. And his hair was scraggly and black. Shoulder length. He was wearing a black shirt covered by an unbuttoned worn down red and black checkered flannel with blue jeans and a ball cap on backwards. Noticeably, he had a big shiny wedding ring on his ring finger that held the lantern.


"Well it was one road for miles, so I knew I was on the right track. Nice to meet you."


"Nice to meet ya too, I reckon, your a bit tired after all that driving now."
After we shook hands, vore fiddled with the lantern and the light receded a bit. 

"Yeah I have never drove this far ever in my life with no stops. It's pretty draining."

"I see, Well let's head up to the house."

There was no mistaking the home here, it wasn't a house it was a trailer. Which did take me by surprise. The light I seen was actually from the shed right behind the trailer, must have glowed through the window. As he lead me to the front porch, I could feel the temperature drop more. It's getting colder and later in the night, it's normal. But for some reason, I felt it was heavier in this moment. 


As we walked into the front door, vore turned some lights on. we were immediately in the living room and to my right, he aimed me to the kitchen which was the end of the front of the trailer. 
He motioned for me to sit at the table. So I did. I noticed multiple cats infesting the living room and kitchen as he kept Turning lights on.

"Alright first of all, thank you for doing this for me, I had quite a some trouble trying to find someone to help me."

"No problem, thank you for the job, 3k is alot of doe, so thank you. 

"Your welcome, now let me inform ya what needs to be done around here."


I sat there just waiting for the list of jobs, and vore walked around the table and sat across from me. Straight to business I guess. 


"Okay here's the list of things i want you to aquire while I'm gone. And the stuff that needs done as well of course."

Aquire?


"Take care of my animals first and foremost. Right? I mean, who doesn't love their animals especially if they have 20 of em? make sure they eat, and get water everyday, right when you wake up. Then feed em again later on around 1 or 2 then finally once more in the evening. As for the pigs, that old broke down Truck back there in the backyard has loaves of bread in it."

"Tailgate is locked, but the key and others I got I left on the coffee table there all on a ring. Give each pig two loafs twice a day. The secondary job is just water my weed plants. There are 3 of them. Two behind the trailer 1 in front across the road.  I'll show ya where they are exactly before I leave."

"You said something about acquiring? You didn't mention that on the phone." 

"Yeah I'm sorry bout that, it's nothing big just need ya to take the road up they way you didn't come and you will see a clearing with some fences. Inside those fences are a big ol pile of wood you can't miss it. I need you to haul back this wood and store it behind the shed in the backyard."

"The county sold it to me last week and I haven't had the time to get it. I was gonna offer ya to use my tractor and trailer. But you can use ur truck if you rather. Remember I got gas in the shed as well."

"Oh okay well how long does it take to get there?"

"About 10 minutes. Might take you 2 trips though it's a decent pile of wood, but the other thing I need you to get is not gonna be ready until Wednesday. I got a guy other side of them woods behind the trailer that owes me something. Now he's old and don't get out much so your gonna have to go an get it."

"Don't worry about what it is aint nothing illegal I can assure you but It needs to be picked up sometime on Wednesday. Make sure you do not forget it. There's a trail back there the only one,  you just follow it and it will lead to his house."

I was distracted by a couple cats in the living room that were playing and running around, while the others just watched. My gaze turned from them to vore and I just nodded my head. He stared at me for a few seconds and flashed a crooked smile. 

"So I reckon you can handle all of that then? He stood up and pinned the piece of paper to the refrigerator with a ham magnet. Like the type of delicious looking ham you see in the cartoons. 

"Umm yeah it all seems straight forward."

"Good Good, food in the fridge of course and that booze I talked about is right there on the counter. Its a whole liter of whiskey now so dont get too drunk and burn my place down ya hear?"

We both shared a laugh but it was short lived as quickly stopped and started looking at me seriously, analyzing me. 

"But seriously I come back and this place is burnt down to the ground or if anyone of my animals is hurt, or dies.... well best not to get into that, I'm sure you'll do fine.

That was strange, I get where he's coming from but I'm almost 30 man I not gonna burn down the property or kill any of your animals. Just a weird shift in conversation that quickly turned kinda dark. After a few seconds of silence, he spoke again.

"Speaking of animals, this little boy right here is the light of my life, his name is roscoe."

A little lap dog pomeranian ran up to him as he picked him up. 

"Please take extra care of him, I found this sucker 1 year ago on the road while I was traveling. He was lost and scared shitless. But now he's as happy as ever."

"Of course vore all your animals will be well taken care of, I really love animals myself it's another reason why I took this job honestly."

"Yeah that's good, the other ones must be sleeping somewhere I don't see em, but their name is Lucy and stifler, Lucy is a pomeranian too and stifler is a terrier."

"Its alot of animals you got here, it's gonna be kinda hard to get all there names right."

"No worries, over there on the that shelf Is a book of photos with them and their names. So if you wanna learn em there ya go."

"Oh alright that's cool, thanks."

"Now last thing, down the hall is the bedroom then bathroom. But if you wanna wanna kick it on that couch I don't give a damn what you do, but just leave my room alone. It's locked anyways. So don't even think about trying to get in there."

"Oh of course I won't even touch the handle you don't have to worry one bit."

"Good"

"my cell number is on that fridge too, if you need to try to get ahold of me, now I'll be on the road alot so I'm not sure if I'll always have reception."
 
It seems it started sprinkling outside, the tiny raindrops slowly and sporadically tapping on the roof, outside the kitchen window, lighting flashed and a few seconds later thunder slighted rumbled in the distance. As vore stood up he grabbed a duffle bag on the couch and told me one last thing. 

"So we may be out in tha middle of no man's land here, and not many come driving through here too, but if anything out of the ordinary or a possibly dangerous situation does occur, I have a shotgun in that gun case there."

He pointed and nodded with his head in the corner of the loving room. 

"It's unlocked and the gun is loaded with a few extra shells inside the case. But as I said No one really comes around here, you should be all alone for the next 3 to 7 days."

"That does ease my mind, I gotta say it's pretty creepy all the way out here."

"Haha that it is, we're out deep in tha sticks here chance, but I'm sure you'll do just fine."
