This is gonna sound fucking crazy. Hell, im writing this, and I dont even believe myself.

I first saw it on the night back from my camping trip. I'm in a few texting group chats with some hiking buddies, we all get together somettimes and trek the Appalachian mountain trails, right by my house. The range is maybe a 15-20 minute drive. Last week, we decided on a camping trip, around ten of us bringing some camper vans up to Cumberland forest and setting up there. The trip was great, the summer breeze and wilderness was a breath of fresh air.

However, since I got back, things have been... odd. I live in a small cabin on a hill that slowly ascends into the mountain range, forested and cut off from the rest of the world. Its perfect for me, I have my own green house, I hunt, and hardly go into town for anything besides supplies like medicine. Ive carved out my own little corner of the world. My only companions were critters or the occasional bear- but ever since yesterday, its been quieter than usual.

I was sitting on my recliner in the living room, looking out of the window with a beer in hand. No crickets, hooting owls, or any yipping coyotes. I usually spent my evenings relaxing or fixing things around the house. I was used to the noisy outdoors, it was a reminder I wasn't totally alone in the thousand-mile range of woods. 

I wasn't completely isolated though, I set up a generator awhile back that fuels my computer and appliances well enough. I checked my message board on Facebook, clicking through the wildlife groups I was in. They posted rare sightings or hunting tips, how the trails were today. Nothing was out of the ordinary, people posted pictures of the bucks with newly grown velvet antlers, interesting birds they saw.

How come I hadn't seen any animal in hours?

I decided it might be an incoming storm, the animals could usually sense weather miles away before we could. 

With that resolve of thought, I started to doze off, glass of beer still in my hand.

I jumped awake when I heard a crash of sound to the floor, my vision not yet adjusted to the dark room. I crouched down, feeling around for my flashlight- when something sharp sliced my hand

"Fuck!" I howled, yanking my hand back up. My eyes finally settled to the dark, noticing the dark crimson line dripping down my palm, then the shattered bottle on the floor. Must've dropped my beer at some point while I slept.

Luckily I knew my house like the back of my now bleeding hand, able to sleepily stagger into the kicthen and paw around for my first aid kit. With a flashlight in my teeth, I wrapped the small gash on my hand, and went back to the comfort of my recliner.
Thats when I heard it- the first sound I'd heard that wasn't caused by me in awhile. 

It was like a creaking floor board, mixed with the yowl of a feral cat. 

Ive been living in these woods for a decade, not much rattles me. I grabbed my trusty Winchester from its place on the mantle, resting it on my hip as I pushed open the door.

I was greeted with darkness, pine trees that stretched on for miles. They bended in the wind, swaying forward as if creating a dark pathway. 

I stepped onto my porch, the wood  groaned under my boots.
The haunting call rang out again, seeking attention, maybe company. It was the only sound, like it silenced every other animal in the mountains. I stepped off of the porch, landing on a pile of crunchy leaves. I started on the naturally made trail, paved by my footsteps over the years. The howl continued, every few minutes without changing, except its volume as I got closer to the source.

I was maybe a few yards from my cabin at this point, when my blood ran cold. I shined my flashlight ahead, highlighting the terror in front of me.

I couldn't make out much, apart from the crooked figure. It was pitch black, with jagged features and bony edges that hunched over sickly. I could hear a crunching and tearing, like flesh being ripped from bone, or chewing on a hard piece of meat. It smelled rotten, and I would've puked if I wasn't paralyzed with fear.

I've seen plenty of predators that would make anybody feel fear. Grizzly bears, standing up straight over 9ft tall, timber wolves with glowing eyes eyeing the deer id just taken down. This wasn't like anything I'd ever seen, rabid and almost humanoid. I stepped back, snapping a twig in two. Its eyes snapped forward, landing on me. They were round and green, perfectly human, albeit bloodshot and wide. 

It groaned, low and rattling like someone gasping for air. I froze, the gun I held in my arms completely forgotten about as I stared blankly. It took a staggered step forward, its shape coming into view. It was tall, human but uncanny. Its hair was only a few strands, sticking out in small clumps. It walked like it had dislocated hips, swaying forward with an almost hasty speed. 

It had my face. Not exactly mine, like a child might have sculpted poorly with clay, unfinished and sloppy. The sight made my stomach sink to the forest floor. With a few clumsy steps back, I turned on my heel and ran the short distance back to my porch. The groan continued, long and desperate for air as I clambered onto the porch. I swung open the door nearly off its hinges, before slamming it back shut behind me. I stepped away from the door, heartbeat loud in my ears. I don't know why I chose to ran, instead of firing my rifle, or even offering help. I could've just left someone outside that needed help, maybe they were malnourished or a victim of something.

Fuck that.. I wasn't going to risk it. If the person needed help, they could've gone the mile down the road to the rangers station, not wander in the woods somewhere. 

The noises stopped, the only sound was my labored breathing in my own ears. I looked at the small alarm clock sitting on the coffee table, across from my recliner. 2:00am, hardly an hour since id been woken up by the noise. 

The world was silent, and it had me thinking back to my camping trip. Nothing unusual occurred, the most notable event was the coyote that tried to steal our food while we slept. Still, it almost felt ominous. Like the trip was to blame for whatever was fucking with my mind right now.

My wooden porch squealed and groaned once more as something with uneven footsteps stopped short of my door. It stepped forward, then seemed to drag its other foot behind before taking another. 

I wasn't going to be scared in the mountains id known for years, like hell. I cocked my gun, training my eyes to not blink, to not let anything pass as I stared at the door, holding my rifle up level to my chest. I didn't breathe, didnt make a sound that might give this creature the advantage. All rationality had left my brain, any reasoning that this might just be a lost tourist or wounded bear was chased out the second I heard that sound again.

Low, like something mechanical breaking down, yet still animalistic enough to growl. 

This was about an hour ago, the noise has all stopped. The only thing I can hear is my heart drumming in my ears. As im typing this out, I am really considering what my next move should be. I don't hear anything anymore, the world is eerie and dead. I am going to stay up for the night, with my gun under my arms. To sleep is to forfeit. I don't know if ill seen sunrise, if that thing will break down my door. But I won't take it lying down.
