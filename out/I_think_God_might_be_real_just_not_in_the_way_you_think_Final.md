My entire life had been a play stuck in the second act (that's the conflict one, before the resolution). I watched this movie in school once called *The Great Gatsby* and there was this one line that really resonated with me. It went like this.

"So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past."

The movie had been some kind of melodrama about a failed relationship, which frankly, I didn't care for. But the line did help me understand that I was that boat, caught in a current, chasing a future that didn't exist. A future with any semblance of happiness. And so I was beaten back, and back, and back again, forced to try and parse out a single, silver lining from my past, a piece of nostalgia that would illuminate the ever-darkening sky of my life before I couldn't see anything at all ever again.

Because the truth is that my life was, at best, a series of the most unlucky draws in the lottery of suffering, or, at worst, a prison designed specifically to maximize my suffering. Either way, I felt like I was in my own, personal Hell. And who was the curator of that Hell? Who was the Devil around which everything burned into ashes?

It was none other than my own father.

\*\*\*

When I was six years old, my mom swallowed a bottle of Alprazolam and was dead before breakfast. My dad woke me up, and the only thing he said was this:

"Hey, get up. Time to go to school. Your mom died by the way, the funeral will be next week."

The funeral happened exactly as he said. I remember my dad's solemn face as he spent ten minutes talking about how devastated he felt in front of our entire extended family. At the end, he wiped the tears leaking from the corners of his eyes with a handkerchief. That was the first and last time I ever remember my dad crying. Mainly because he never had to put on that kind of facade again.

The next day my dad hosted a different kind of event. It was a commemoration ceremony. I remember because that word "commemoration" confused me. I couldn't tell if it was supposed to be happy or sad. I received my answer when I saw my dad popping streamers and laughing while dancing to cheerful music. "The bitch is dead! The bitch is dead! Three years, and the bitch is dead!" He chanted, then stretched out his hand, offering me to join in the festivities. But I remained on the couch, confused, and missing my mom. That was, until my dad brought out my gift. I'm embarrassed to admit that I actually became excited when I saw the nicely wrapped red box and Cinderella-esque bow.

"What is it daddy?" I asked with a tender curiosity.

"Open it and see!"

The wrapping didn't connect the two pieces of the box, so I need only lift the lid to see what was inside. When I did so, two black puppy eyes stared up at me from inside its hidden chamber.

"A puppy!?" I squealed and threw off the lid, taking the little white Dalmatian into my arms and rocking it like a baby.

"Do you like him?" asked my dad.

"Mhm, Mhm," I eked out, nodding fervently. Then I watched my dad reach back into the box and pull out a red collar. The name "Lucky" was engraved into the nylon strap, which, on second inspection, appeared much too large for my little puppy. My dad motioned toward Lucky, and when I handed him over, I watched my dad link the collar around his torso.

"That's not where collars go," I stated whimsically.

"It will be for now. Until he grows into it, that is."

But he never grew into it.

Several weeks later, I remember waking up early in the morning having to pee. It was still dark outside, and the house was cool and quiet. I slipped out from under the covers and walked down the hallway, not noticing what was laying on the floor until I stepped in it. At first, it sounded and felt like I had stepped on a very succulent chocolate cake. The fudgy kind with lots of mousse. And then, when my foot stomped through the juicy flesh, I felt something sharp pierce my skin. I yelped and jumped back, feeling the sting of a gash. Then I let out a series of cries as I single-leg hopped to the lightswitch and turned it on.

I remember my first thought was, "how did roadkill get in our house?" In the center of the hallway was a meaty salad of guts and muscle bits, dressed with blood. I remember thinking it was too perfectly set to have been roadkill. It was as if the animal had been ground up by some machine made precisely for this purpose. I took a step closer and saw that its hair was like a tiny, folded carpet, sloughed off from its body, and in the process of being painted red. I took another step, forgetting the pain in my foot entirely, and saw something stuck inside the mess that caught my eye. It took me a minute to realize what it was, but when I did, I fell onto the ground.

Some time passed. I'm not sure if I fainted or was having a seizure or what, but the next thing I remember, my dad was trudging up the wooden steps. He stopped in front of Lucky's eviscerated body and stared down at it for maybe ten seconds. Then he reached down and pulled Lucky's collar out from his entrails. Organ flecks spilled off as he inspected it. Then he said something that I will never forget.

*"Why did you kill Lucky?"*

I couldn't even speak. I was petrified. My dad asked again, this time louder.

"Did you hear me? Why did you kill Lucky?"

"I—" I wavered, feeling that if I spoke another word, a flood of tears would pour out of me, enough to fill the entire house.

"Y—you," My dad mocked. "You, what? Didn't kill him?" He stepped over the corpse, and in his face, I saw nothing. It was cold. Completely void of any feeling. "Well, maybe you didn't kill him. But you damn well let him die, didn't you? Some owner you are." He knelt down in front of me, where I was barely managing to hold myself up. I saw him unlock the collar and slip it around my neck. I felt Lucky's cold blood and little pieces of ground bone rub up against my skin. Then I heard the snap of the device locking.

"Well, I'll show you how to be a proper owner," he said.

\*\*\*

The beatings started soon after Lucky died. I'd spill a glass of water and take a punch to the stomach. "Be careful," my dad would scold. Then, on a different day, I tried to do some cleaning and suddenly felt a boot press against my back. "What do you think you're doing? I didn't tell you to clean." It didn't matter *what* the reason was, there was always *some* reason that my behavior was unacceptable.

On especially bad days, my dad would force me to sleep in Lucky's old kennel. It was a small, metal-wire cage. In order to fit, I'd have to curl into a fetal position and stay that way all night. Then, in order to earn my release, I'd have to eat my breakfast out of Lucky's old food bowl. This was probably the most terrifying punishment for me, and my dad used that to his advantage. He told me that if I ever mentioned anything that happened at home to anyone at school, he would lock me up in Lucky's kennel for a whole month.

Needless to say, I was a very reserved and docile student. It also didn't help that my father was on the fast track to Principal and then Superintendent status at the local Middle School. He was in good standing with the administrators, always offering to help lighten their loads, and networked well with the other teachers. In the community's eyes, he was all PTA meetings and teacher barbecues. No one knew him the way I did.

But that didn't stop them from judging me as his daughter. My reclusive personality was met by anathema from the teachers who "expected more from me" and thought I should "speak up".

This was further compounded by the fact that my grades were never perfect. Any time I'd show up at home with a 100% on an assignment, my dad would drag me by the hair to the sink where he'd put soap in my eyes and then force me to wash it out. When I could finally see again, he had already ripped up the entire assignment and threw the shreds on the ground. Then he'd point at it and say, "That's what happens when you lie about your grades."

I also became really good at applying makeup. My dad would never hit me in places that were easily visible. He was too smart for that. But even the places that weren't visible, he'd make sure I covered with a pound of foundation. Eventually, I started doing the makeup myself, merely because it was something that *I* could control. It was *mine*. And there weren't many things that were.

Around fourth grade, my dad started to childproof everything. Kitchen knives, silverware, even scissors were all held under lock and key. I was never allowed a curling iron or hair blower, and other, larger appliances like the stove were programmed to turn on with a password. At the time, I didn't understand why he was going to such a length, but as I moved on to fifth and then sixth grade, I began to understand. I didn't have any friends outside of school, and even in school, I was mostly a background noise to the main event happening everywhere around me. I was a spectator of what life should have been. I started to contemplate suicide often. But there was no way to follow through.

Eventually, my dad brought home a woman. Her name was Alexandra, but she went by Alex. I was skeptical at first. She was a teacher at the Middle School. But I noticed that my dad would postpone the beatings and swearing and all the horrible things until *after* she left. One day, I came home and it was just her in the kitchen making some soup. She asked me how my day was, and I didn't know what to say. I think I had spoken a total of two hundred words at home over the past two years. "Anything fun you're working on?" she asked.

I had already started my Ancient Civilizations project, but I knew that if I showed my dad, he would probably throw it in the trash. For that reason, I left the project at school and worked on it during lunch while everyone else ate. I asked the art teacher if I could have access to some of her supplies, to which she agreed. My civilization was Ancient Rome, and I was in the process of using Mrs. Whitaker's white pipe cleaners to try and make the Colosseum.

I ended up telling Alex about the project. She asked if she could see it, and when I said "no", she pushed for an explanation. After a few minutes of pressing, she got me to say "because dad wouldn't like it."

"Like what? Your diorama?"

I nodded.

"Well it's not like he'd throw it out or anything."

I was silent, and when Alex saw my expression, she said, "Oh, my God. Is that something he'd do?"

More silence.

"Okay, how about you just show me, then? I can take a look at school if you'd like."

I agreed, and over the next month, Alex would come visit me during lunch breaks and help me glue pieces to the shoebox lid that I used as the container. And we'd talk. I really began to grow fond of her.

One night, it was just Alex and I at the house. She was cooking again, and I felt the sudden urge to talk about dad. I asked if I could tell her something, to which she responded, "You can talk to me about *anything*. What's on your mind?"

She listened for a whole hour as I recounted all the events of my life. Everything that my dad had done to me, beginning with the commemoration ceremony, then Lucky, the collar, the cage, everything. Her eyes widened with each passing remark.

And then we both heard the car door slam shut outside.

"Shit, it's your father." Alex said. She looked down at me in utter horror. "Okay, go up to your room. I'll deal with this."

"Don't tell him!" I begged, thinking about what would happen to the both of us if he found out.

"I won't," she promised. "This is above my pay grade. There's a bunch of people out there whose job is to help with just this. I know a few I can get in contact with. I'll do it secretly, okay?"

I held her eyes for a second, realizing this must have been the first person I've ever trusted in my whole life, then nodded and said, "okay."

"Okay, good. Now go upstairs."

I obeyed her instructions and ran upstairs to my room and closed the door right as my dad entered the house. I pressed my ear up to the door and tried to hear what they were talking about. Apparently my dad was already in a bad mood, because it sounded like they were arguing. Then I heard the front door open again. Then silence for a minute.

The next sound I heard was two pairs of footsteps walking up the stairs. My heart sank deep into my stomach, and I backed up to my bed. The doorknob twisted, then two figures emerged. My eyes locked onto my diorama which was being held in Alex's hands.

"My diorama!" I yelled and ran toward it, but my dad kicked my chest and I flew back against the side of my bed. I felt all the air compress in my lungs, and everything was spinning for a second. Then I was on my knees, coughing.

"Put it down," my dad said to Alex.

Alex placed the diorama on the ground in front of me. I couldn't even look in her eyes. I felt so betrayed. Why had I trusted her?

"Please," I begged, crying.

Then my dad brought his foot down on top of my newly finished colosseum. Once, twice, then three times. I heard Alex suppress a giggle. I looked up and saw she was covering a wide smile. I cried out, and she giggled again.

"Can I try?" asked Alex.

"Of course," replied my dad, "it was your idea, after all."

Alex smiled in delight as she stomped down on the diorama, destroying the little city I had built and all the people inside. Then she crushed each tree, one by one. "Oh, that's good." she moaned, soaking in my defeated expression as if she were siphoning my life force directly out of the air. "That's so good." I watched as she began to touch herself in an erotic way. She turned to my dad and started kissing him, then touching him. Then she stopped and looked at me.

"Can I?" was all she asked.

"Of course," my dad replied.

\*\*\*

After everything that transpired that night, I decided I was going to end my life as soon as possible. I no longer felt anything except complete emptiness. The only bit of emotion I felt came a few days later when I was walking home from the bus stop and saw the most beautiful, glistening present in the middle of the road. I ran to it and picked up the razor blade that someone must have either dropped or discarded as trash. Luckily for me, it was the perfect treasure. I stashed the blade in my pocket, then returned home.

I didn't do it right away. Even though I was resolved to end my life, I needed a plan. A structure. A specific *day*. I decided that I would do it after school on Friday. I'd cap off the week with a one-way vacation.

That night, I went through the whole day in my mind. I pictured waking up, eating a bowl of cereal. My dad might be in a good mood and leave me alone, or maybe he'd harass me. Then he'd drive me to school. I'd be quiet in the car, then quiet in all my classes. Biding my time. My dad was the principal, so he stayed late which meant I'd either have to take the bus or walk home. I decided I'd walk. No need to speed things up *too* fast. I'd enjoy the last moments of life. Then I'd get home and go upstairs. Alex might be there. Thankfully she would only acknowledge my existence when my dad was around now. It's like I was a toy she had used once and grown bored of. I would get the razor blade out from the dresser drawer, then lock myself in the bathroom. I'd draw a hot bath, then get in, letting my arms soak in the warm water. Then, once everything was loose, I'd use the blade. Two quick cuts, then I could rest at last.

My eyes were heavy, and I drifted asleep to the comforting thought of eternal peace.

\*\*\*

Friday arrived and already something was off. I woke up to the scent of bacon. My mouth was salivating as I pictured a full course breakfast, with bacon and cheesy eggs and homemade pancakes… But, I'd never had any of those things. My dad never made me breakfast. So why was I crying now while thinking about something that never happened? Something that *couldn't* happen.

The scent turned off like a switch, and when I went downstairs, sure enough, there was no Grand Slam on the stovetop. My dad eyed me from behind a newspaper as my momentary intrigue dissolved back into mundane reality. He put down the paper and shot up from his chair in a fashion which I swore I had seen before. Seeing him tower over me like that filled me with dread, and I tensed the muscles in my stomach as he approached, circling around me like a shark, as if he could smell my blood in the water.

"Alex!" He called, walking away, leaving me alone in the scentless kitchen. I released a stale breath and reminded myself that soon, this would all be over.

But the odd occurrences didn't stop there. They strung together throughout the day, beginning with the smell of breakfast, then during gym class, we played a pick up soccer game. Normally I was the last pick, and I'd often make the corner-kick area my home. But today one of the captains, Claire, picked me first. I almost couldn't believe it until she called my name *again*, and I noticed everyone was staring at me.

Then, during lunch, I was moving through the hot lunch line, collecting each scoop of jail food on my tray when I saw one of the lunch ladies handing me what looked like an ice cream cone over the glass divider. It startled me, not least because the cone was dripping red. At first I thought it was blood, but when I realized it was some kind of sugar topping, I reached out to grab it.

"What are you doing?" the person behind me asked.

I turned to look at him, then back at the cone. But it was gone.

All day, classes had been shortened to make room for an assembly. I hated assemblies, mainly because I hated being packed like a sardine and surrounded by the scrutiny of other people's eyes. Still, I was able to find a spot off near the corner, only four bleachers up. Earlier in the year we had a magic show, then a mad scientist came and did some wonky experiments. This time someone was talking about Global Warming. I'll be honest, when he mentioned the time frames for the effect of climate change, I immediately zoned out. I didn't have that kind of time. Unless an asteroid landed or an alien invasion commenced in the next few hours, nothing would matter. And even then, *my* result would be the same.

But something happened during the presentation. I can't really describe it other than how it looks for an old video cassette to glitch, or a flame to flicker: I swear one second the man who was talking about Global Warming was there, and the next, there was a Priest—a small black man wearing black robes with a white collar—standing center-stage, speaking to the crowd. It only lasted for a short space of time, but what he said reached down deep in my mind and plucked at a string I didn't know existed there.

"So, my brothers and sisters, if you are ever in distress, reach out to the Lord, and he will offer peace."

The transition was so extreme, I nearly turned to the nearby kids and asked if they saw it, too. But judging from their bored expressions, I figured they hadn't.

It continued on my walk home. Little things like plants and trees popping out of existence, then back into it, as if something was calling the objects of this world away, but something else was fighting their release. Reality destabilized as I observed the shifting colors of street signs and the phasing in and out of vehicles. I started to run, only stopping once at a crosswalk. Next to me, a large fuel-guzzling truck was playing a song that sounded so familiar. The guitar riff. The drums. The opening lyrics:

*Winter is here, oh lord*

*Haven't been home in a year or more*

*I hope she holds on a little longer.*

When I finally arrived home, I slammed the door shut and auto-piloted up to my room. Fortunately, Alex wasn't there. I quickly retrieved the razor blade from the bottom drawer where I'd stashed it in a pair of socks. Then I sprinted to the bathroom and slammed the door, locking it. It was the only door in the whole house that I *could* lock. I leaned back against it, then slid down to the floor. My heart was pounding. I felt tears well up in my eyes.

But the job wasn't done.

I stood up and turned on the bath water, then plugged the drain. This was the hardest part. The minutes of agony as I watched the water level rise in the basin. I tried to keep my mind clear. This was all business. A job that needed to be completed. That's how I had to think about it, or else I could never go through with it. When the water had sufficiently risen, I stepped into the wet warmth, razor blade in hand, and stretched my legs out to the other end of the bath. I let my arms soak, trying to ignore my reflection in the murky water. My heart never stopped beating, and all I could think about was the blood pulsing through my veins.

I lifted my arm out of the water. I was wearing a t-shirt so I wouldn't have to roll up my sleeve. Then I bought the corner of the blade to forearm and pressed it in. The skin parted easily, and I saw a trickle of thin, red blood roll down my arm like a dribble of tomato juice. My heart had now swelled to encompass my whole world: a singular beating, *ba dum, ba dum, ba—*

*Oh, please God, if you're there, please, please, please help me.*

*—dum.*

The prayer was almost automatic. Like I had pressed a button in my mind and it just came out. I'm still not sure if I spoke the words or merely thought them, or if I even thought them at all. Regardless, the response was immediate. 

*Tap, tap, tap.*

The eerie sound reverberated through my hollow, acoustic skull. My eyes, which were trained on the small stream of blood tracking down my arm, turned and saw something else red that hadn't been there before. In fact, there were many red things. A large vine started up near the half-opened windowsill and had grown all the way down to the floor, tomatoes hanging like ornaments off its stem, and carrying on toward the bath. I reached down and plucked one of the ripe, red fruits, holding it up in the air. It felt real. So real. But how could that be?

Just then, I heard the sound of car tires screeching outside as someone drove recklessly around the bend. I already knew who it was. A few seconds later, I heard the sound of my dad's car door slamming shut.

*Tap, tap, tap,* the sound came again.

I stood up, dirty water pouring off me and assimilating back into the bath. I heard the front door swing open, making contact with the wall. Then fast footsteps up the flight of stairs. I stepped out of the bath, nearly slipping and falling onto the ground.

"Lauren!" My dad shouted. "What the fuck do you think you're doing?"

I froze in place, looking back at the locked door. My dad was already pounding on it. I could feel my heart thumping again; my habit to freeze in terror seized at the muscles in my body. And then from behind me:

*Tap, tap, tap.*

"You open this door right now, or I'll break it down. You hear me? I can do a lot worse than put you in that damn kennel."

Ignoring my dad, I spun around and threw open the drapes. At first, I thought the sun was directly behind the window. I had to squint to even keep my eyes open, the light was so bright. And then I saw it. Or, rather, I saw him. He was an angel, wearing a crown of gold. I saw him tap three more times.

"Fine, here I come," said my dad, then he charged into the door. The worn hinges let out a groan, but they didn't give. Not yet.

I stepped up to the window and twisted the lock, then pulled the window up as high as it would go. At the same moment, my dad charged again and the door burst open. But it wasn't my dad. Not anymore. It was some dark demon with a skin stitched from worm-like insects. There was an almost imperceptible moment of silent standoff as the two beings stared one another down, and then, reaching out toward the light, the angel swept into the room and assimilated into my body. The demon roared, charging at me with his fist drawn, ready to strike. But it was too late for him. I could see everything now. All of his manipulations, his deceits. This entire world was a lie.

I reached out, holding up the universal sign of "stop", and trapped him in an invisible box. He mimed hatred and struggled against the restraints, but it was futile. I closed my hand, and he exploded like a squashed bug.

Then I was ascending through an otherworldly space. I saw fragments of other lives, all stitched together through several archetypes, and each one led back to the same point. I emerged there, outside the SUV where my mom and dad were still trapped with the demon. The car swerved into the oncoming lane just in time for the passenger side door to meet a dump truck that was hauling lumber. There was a giant snapping sound, like a tree being pulled apart at the stump, then the sound of crushing metal reverberated through the air with enough force to feel the vibrations in my chest. From behind me, little-me began to cry out, calling for dad. I turned in time to see the angel, who was standing at little-me's side, fly with an incredible velocity toward the wreck. My dad tumbled out of the driver's side door, worse for wear, and the angel entered into him.

I saw a flash of brilliance, and then I was ascending again. At each passing floor, I saw the major events of my life play out as they really happened. I saw my home, filled with love, which was actually the scent of bacon in the morning. I saw ice cream cones and cartons, soccer games with my dad in the bleachers, and I heard music. Then I saw myself growing up, making friends, and attending college. A complete life.

And then, the skies overhead filled with dark storm clouds which were throwing javelins of lightning. I felt the raindrops landing on my head and trickling down my face. In the distance, I saw the source of all that was evil in the world. The demon was standing at the top of a hill just past the field. My eyes were different now, and I could see my dad was still in there. The demon was like a parasitic skin that leached onto anything it could control. It was powerful—powerful enough to command this storm. However, even though the sky was filled with clouds, everything to me appeared to radiate a duality of darkness and light, which ebbed and flowed—a swirling of enigmatic particles in constant battle. *Was this what the world was really made of?* I wondered. And as if an answer to my question, I felt a sense of affirmation. I looked down at my hand and saw I was radiating with the light of the angel who had saved me. Was this *his* power?

I suddenly noticed the thousands of small presences which had encircled us. The hellish coyotes had closed the barrier to a radius of a quarter mile, starting at the hill where the demon was located and then looping around the SUV on either side. I saw them scrape their paws against the muddy ground and growl with reserved hostility. My senses had been so augmented that I could hear their teeth chatter with ferocious excitement. And then I looked back toward the SUV and saw the teepee Trent and I had erected was fried, metal pieces broken and littered all over the place. Trent was several paces in front of the van, holding a large, rectangular-shaped gun, the butt resting on his shoulder like a kind of RPG. The gun contained a massive amount of compressed energy.

"Lauren, get back in the van!" Trent shouted over the rain. "I'll hold 'em off."

I didn't have time to explain to Trent what I was thinking. If I did, I would have told him that those coyotes lining the field around us were like tiny candlelights that only needed a good blow to be extinguished. And that, somewhere deep inside, another being with power he couldn't even imagine was telling me, not through words, but through a more direct method of communication, that I need only lift my hand and touch the sky, and the storm would pass. I recalled when I first entered the zone of higher energy, specifically how close everything felt, and now I understood what that meant. I took a step forward in lieu of the beckoning commands of my friend.

The demon called the beasts to attention like the Starter of a race, and I saw each of the multitude set back on their hind legs. Then he fired, and the coyotes charged toward us. I felt a large discharge of energy as Trent shot the gun at those coming in from the East. But I didn't react. I waited five seconds, then ten. The beasts were almost falling over themselves as the gap closed and they came closer, and closer. Then I lifted my hand just as the voice in my head instructed and touched the sky, dragging my fingers through the storm clouds and ripping open five, long streaks. The light beamed down as crepuscular rays, and I guided them with my hand like a group of lasers, evaporating each coyote that came into contact with it. It only took ten seconds to recall every single one of them to whatever hellish realm they came from. The last of the pack tried running back toward the shadows of the dark clouds that still spotted the sky, but I was quicker than them. Once they were dealt with, I took another few steps forward.

"Lauren!" I heard Trent call from behind me.

I stopped and turned, seeing Trent soaked in his jumpsuit, gun still held at attention. In my current state, I could also see a gray static in his eyes that continued back into his head, shrouding his brain. "Trust me," I called back. "I can do this."

After a moment, I saw him relax his shoulders, letting the gun fall forward. Then, the static in his eyes and around his head dissipated, and he nodded.

"Okay, you get him, then."

I turned back to the demon, who was now at the end of the thirty yard field. While I was moving the light, I had targeted the demon with it, but even as it passed over him, it had no effect. He was too powerful. Moreover, the giant cumulonimbus that was located directly over his head was unreachable, meaning he'd always have a decent radius of direct shade. I watched him advance another step forward, and then I saw figures emerge from the shadows directly around him. They were all humanoid and made of similar material as the demon himself, but they were hollow, like the chocolate Easter bunny candies they sell on Easter.

"So, I see you've grown a liking for this one," the demon's voice projected as if from a bullhorn. "It's too bad I'm going to have to kill her."

I took a deep breath, then closed my eyes. Even when they were closed, I could still see. In fact, my sight was probably even better with them closed. There was less interference. I only saw the shifting in and out of particle clouds, each taking on one of two valences. Just as before, I intuited my next move. I waited for the party of shadows to advance a little further, then, while holding my eyes closed, I outstretched my right hand as if I were offering a handshake to my enemies. Focusing hard enough, I was able to move in this new zone of energy, and I grabbed onto and stitched together the light particles into a bow and several arrows. When I opened my eyes, it was still there.

The shadowy figures charged at me, scaling out in either direction like a net, hoping to evade my shots. I pulled the first arrow back, and I felt a hand on my shoulder, steadying me. Time slowed down. I could see my target. But more than see it—I could feel it. I released the first arrow and it traveled faster than sound through the leftmost shadow. The energy released was so intense that it caused a gale to stir, and the shadow vanished instantly upon contact. The demon stopped, grimacing at his destroyed henchman. But I didn't waste any time. I pulled back another arrow, then another, and another until all seven of the monsters had been banished from this world. I sprinted a few steps to the right, then stopped and pulled an eighth arrow, letting it loose in the direction of the demon.

At first, I saw a blinding spark, and I thought it had hit him. But the spark slowly extinguished like a fire that was letting off the gas. When it was almost gone, I saw the demon's hand had grasped onto the arrow, and the little parasites that made up his skin were eating it like a full course meal. I could hear them. They sounded like someone without any gums chewing on raw ground beef. It was sloppy, and when they finished, I could sense their insatiable lust for more.

The demon sighed, shrugging his shoulders and allowing his arms to fall out on either side. "Wellllll, fine…" he drawled, "I guess I'll do it myself." The demon smirked. "Can't have someone like you walking around now, can we? Now that you *really* see us." There was a moment of silence, then, faster than I could blink, a sword slipped into the demon's hand and he shifted two yards in front of me. 

I would have died right then and there if the angel didn't partly dissociate from me and reach out to grab the blade before it made contact with my neck. Apparently this is what the demon wanted though, because his smirk grew wider. "Yes, that's right, get out of there," he said while grabbing onto *my* arm and pulling it with all the force of a conveyor belt that had snagged an article of clothing. I tried tugging away, but his grip was unbelievably strong. I could feel my own power start to weaken as the angel was pulled further and further out of me.

In a split second decision, which was more of a desperate reaction, I leapt forward and bit down into the demon's arm. He roared in pain, and I felt his fingers release their grip on me. I tumbled backward, feeling most of my strength return as the angel re-assimilated into my skin.

"You absolute cunt," the demon swore, gripping his arm which was dripping with dead bugs around the area I had bitten. "You're gonna pay for that."

I spit out some of the disgusting maggots that had found their way into my mouth. Then I closed my eyes and conjured a sword. It manifested even quicker than the bow. The demon didn't waste any time blinking in for another strike. This time, I could see it. I blocked a series of blows, but he was too fast for me to counter. I swung at his right side and he parried, slicing at my chest. The blade made contact with my shirt and cut the skin down my ribs. I felt the searing heat of the wound and backed up a few steps, clutching it. The demon didn't let me recover. He was on me again with a downward slash that I dodged by spinning to the left and leaping back.

"Come on, I'm getting bored." The demon croaked. His arm had already recovered, while my stomach was continuing to bleed.

How was this fair? How was I supposed to beat this ancient demon that had thousands—millions of times the battle experience that I had? I tried to contact the angel that was still within me, but it didn't answer. Why was he quiet now? Was he tired? Was the light really this weak?

I dodged and deflected another series of slashes. Was this how it all ended? I tried to think back to anything that would give me the slightest edge. Hadn't I stopped him once? Hadn't I banished him? How did I do *that*? Because there was no way I could hurt him. The only time I even got close was when I bit his arm, and that was only because he was practically on top of me.

And then it hit me.

I didn't know if it would work, or even if it made any sense, but I dropped my sword. I saw the demon's eyes light up, and his smirk grew to Cheshire proportions. I closed my eyes and focused everything on the space directly between us, knowing that he would shift imperceptibly fast. I stitched together a blanket of particles that would slow him down and increase my ability to detect him. When he traveled through it, I could sense the position of his body at every moment, including the shifting weight of his energy. I honed in on him: not the demon, but the man inside. The man who the demon wanted me to forget. The man who I loved.

I reached both arms out just as the demon was upon me and wrapped them around my dad's torso. "I love you more than anything, too, dad." I cried out. "Please come back to me."

The earth stilled.

I remember feeling the spirit that was inside me swell into the air around me, and then it was gone. All my abilities vanished. I was only a woman standing in the middle of a muddy field, holding her dad. The skies above were blue, with not a cloud in sight. I pulled back and saw my dad's face—his true face—in what felt like so long. His eyes were closed, but he was breathing. He must have been exhausted.

"Lauren," Trent said. He was right beside me now. "We've got to go. They're here."

I didn't have my super-hearing anymore, so it took me a second to notice the sound of helicopter wings approaching from two directions. It was the Organization.

"Come on, I'll help you bring him in the van." Trent said.

We fit him in the seat next to me. I had to scoot part of my butt onto the center console, but I didn't mind. The helicopters were above us now, and we could see black SUVs heading onto the trail behind us.

"Shit," Trent muttered.

"Use the trapdoor," I said.

"I don't know if I can direct it. The distance is too far."

"I can direct it," I answered. "Just use it."

He looked at me in that same way as earlier: as if he couldn't really believe it was me.

"Weren't you the one touting my potential?" I asked. "Come on, trust me. I'll get us through this."

Trent looked from me, to my dad, then back to me. "Well, shit." He said and grabbed the shifter. "Ava, you know what to do. Release phase lock."

"Phase lock released," Ava chimed back.

"Shift"

And then we were once again traveling through a world yet unknown to mankind.

\*\*\*

I've written all of this from a cafe near my house. This'll be the last update before I go dark. Like Trent, I think keeping my comings and goings anonymous might be for the best from here on out.

I wanted to thank everyone who has stuck along this journey with me and offered support. This was by far the craziest and most difficult thing I've ever confronted. And, needless to say, it's changed my life profoundly.

I've learned that the phrase "everything happens for a reason" has more truth to it than it may first appear. We are subject to forces which go well beyond the understandings of modern science. Yet, it's through us that those forces act. In a way, we really are the playthings of the Gods. But, in a different way, we can directly influence the control they have over us. It's a fine line, but one that I guess I'm going to have to figure out.

Speaking directly now to the Organization. You have no idea what you're doing. You think you're harnessing some kind of otherworldly energy for your selfish means, but you're wrong. This energy can't be harnessed. It's not ours. And if you do try to harness it, something else will be harnessing it through you. I just hope, for your sake, that that something isn't a demon.

Now, if you'll excuse me, my dad and I are going to visit one of my old friend's at a barbecue. If we don't speak again, I hope you have a wonderful life. And never forget
