So some background to start, I am someone who is very outdoorsy. I love camping, hiking cycling and basically everything outdoors. I am also a college student and I have started doing a lot more trips alone. I also go to college right in the Appalachian foothills. And if you have never been here before it is a forest that gets a massive amount of rain, is very dense and there have long been rumors of creatures that live in there. There are absolutely places where no human has stepped foot.

Now onto the story, a few weeks ago after I was sick of exams I decided to spend one night in the woods by a campfire to decompress. Despite having a full camping setup I decided to sleep in my car because I was feeling lazy. So I took off one night, and drove maybe a little too fast to where I was going to set up camp. I had found this little forest road next to the Chattooga River that had dispersed camping on it, enough of a place to park and sleep pretty much but no services and no restrooms. The first thing that I noticed heading there was how remote it was. I did not pass any houses or cars on the main road 10 min before the turnoff and I passed over the ridge. The actual camping area was about a mile off the road. When I was driving past the start of the camping area I was noticing how dark it was, there was no one and there was no light. The sky was overcast and it was a damp 45 degrees.

Now I had found a nice enough place at the end of the road, so I pulled over and started to unpack. The river was a dark shadow behind and too the right of me. I had a little bit of a weird feeling when I stepped out. Have you ever had that tight anxious feeling in your gut? That is what I felt, there was not something obviously wrong but something just felt a little off... While I was walking around I also saw some weird trash and stuff. There was several burned camp chairs and something weirder. It was a perfectly circular hole with horn shaped sticks stuck in it like a symbol of something. It felt weird. But I dismissed the worries and said that I would feel better after starting a fire, keep in mind I had only been there for about 2 min at this point. I started the fire, a little flame flared right up. So i grabbed my book and settled in for the night. About 30s after I did this I there was a massive splash from my right. If you can imagine someone threw a boulder in deep water it sounded exactly like that. I jumped from the sound but dismissed it as rocks fall from the bank occasionally. But then it happened again exactly 30 seconds after the first time. At this point I knew something was out there and jumped in my car and locked the doors trying to figure out what to do. And the forest was inky black outside my cars headlights, it was almost as if the world ceased to exist outside that limited area.

After thinking for about a min I jumped out, put out the fire and threw everything in the car as quick as possible. I drove off down the road, scared but also disappointed about what was happening. So while I was driving about a mile down the road there was the campsite on the opposite end farther from the river which was far less closed in. When I stepped out that anxious feeling in my gut was a lot better so I decided to try again to make a fire not wanting to leave. But, while I was setting up that anxious feeling started getting a bit louder. I again tried to dismiss it as the fire was starting to flare, set up my chair and I was ready to relax. Then almost exactly 5 min after I had gotten there there was another massive splash. At this moment I knew I needed to leave so I started throwing everything in the car while looking frantically around me. Then 30s later as I was pouring the fire out there was another splash. I threw the last things in the car, started it and drove out of there as fast as possible. I don't know who, or what was out there and I have no real desire to go back and find out. I ended up driving 45 min away to a state park where I was surrounded by well lit campers and I slept fitfully. So all ended well, but I have no clue what was on that road except that it was not friendly.
