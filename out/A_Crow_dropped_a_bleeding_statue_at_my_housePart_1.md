Right now,It's been a couple of months since this phenomenon has occurred.I also feel that I've bottled up too many emotions as nobody would believe me,at least until I found this subreddit.So here goes the story of the incident where I met this entity.

One day,I went out to the balcony to sweep it,as I usually do.I finished my work and took my afternoon siesta.After I woke up,I found a bronze statue,heavily oxidised,in a puddle of blood.I guess now is the time to give some context.

I served in the Armed Forces.Therefore,I wasn't really afraid of blood as I had seen my fair share of blood and death.I picked up the statue to inspect it.It had a gash on its right wrist.It was profusely bleeding.

Now,this freaked me out.I never expected an supernatural event to happen to me.I was always skeptical of my family's classic ghost stories.Yet,my Yeats of physical and psychological training kicked in.

The statue was about 12 inches tall,amd featured an woman wearing an robe amd holding an paper fan,staring at a noose in front of her.

I took the statue and put it in the sink.My analytical mind kicked in.I collected some of the blood for any further use or analysis.I cleaned up the puddle and the trail of blood.Last thing I want is to be labeled as a murderer by the Karen next door.

I then took a bath,and had a change of clothes.I also wondered how the statue got there.Naturally,I checked the CCTV.What I saw shook me to the core.I got goosebumps and sweaty hands just looking at the footage.

A crow,jet black in colour,with red glowing eyes,swooped in from seemingly nowhere,dropped the statue,and flew away.It easily seemed to be able to carry the moderately heavy statue.Its movements were smooth,like a knife through butter.

It's eyes though....Those red glowing eyes...They sent shivers down my spine.They seemed to dissect me,and draw me into an inescapable void.They betrayed an air of superior intelligence,yet seemed to be pleading in a way.Pleading to help it,and to take it seriously,like a trapped soul.

I had to get it out of my head.I took a deep breadth and decided that next best course of action is to call an archaeologist,or at least,an art curator.

I decided to check my contact list.I couldn't find an archaeologist,but I did miraculously find an art curator,a former friend of mine at university.I called her and asked her to come to my home immediately.She lived about 2 hours away.I promised her I would make it worth her time.

She told me she would arrive the next day as it was already late.I decided to take dinner and fall asleep.

Caw,Caw.I was woken up to the pecking and cawing at the middle or the night.It appears Mr Crow came to remind me to take it seriously.Well,that's exactly what I was doing,though for my sake,not it's.

Yet,It didn't try to enter the house or hurt me in any way.

This event seemed to give me purpose in life.The endless days of drinking alone at home,sleeping at day,and drinking again,not to mention the numerous suicide attempts had taken a toll on my body.I lived to die.I had no boyfriend,no lover,no family and few scarce friends.

The next day,at about 11,I could hear the honk of Stephanie's car.She was wearing a designer dress and bag,amd here I was,in my sweatpants.I took her to the kitchen.

I think she was expecting to see art or valuable artifacts,and not an horrific old statue.She gasped and almost fainted at the stream of blood in the sink.

I seated her on the sofa,and asked her to take a deep breadth.I plucked some chamomile and crushed them.I found that the smell of chamomile calmed me down.I seemed to alay her fears.

I asked her if she had a solution to my problem.Still in shock,she replied with an hushed "no".She promised not to tell a soul and promptly left,not even asking for the fee.

I guess regular people are afraid of blood to an extent.It appears that the alcohol numbed my nerves as well.

The only remaining answer was to take the blood to an forensic analyst,hoping that the blood was human,and that it had recognizable DNA.

I called one of my acquaintances from the army,who now works as an analyst.He asked me to meet him at 4 in the evening.I did as asked.

The next week breezed by,that is,until the day I got the results.The Blood was that of Ms Mizume,who was found murdered in her home 2 years back.The killer was never found.I had to bribe my "friend" to keep his mouth shut.

I accessed the public records relayed to her case.Her body was found in an state of advanced decomposition,despite being killed a day prior.She had acid burns amd bite marks all over her body.Her house and especially the attic were completely trashed.

I took an cursory review of her family history.Well,well,her elder sister was found dead in her room 2 years later,4 months back.She committed suicide by slashing her wrist.Whats more,she was found with the statue in her room.

Though,why was the younger sister's blood flowing from the statue when the older sister was found with it?It seemed that the deaths were connected.

The older sisters death seemed natural,as natural as suicide can be,and that's why I am front of her uncle's house,uninvited,like a burglar.I'm glad I didn't get shot on sight.

Her uncle was an old man in his 60's.He didn't seem too happy,yet he politely invited me in.

He gestured me to sit on the sofa and got me a steaming cup of matcha.I introduced myself as an art curator who came in possession of the bronze statue.

He almost spat on me in disgust."So you make a living of selling dead people's artifacts".I shrunk back,but calmly replied"No. I came in possession of it through an agent.I didn't know it belonged to a deceased person until today."

I continued,"I wanted to pay my respects.I'm sorry for your loss."He seemed a bit more pleased.He replied"Her grave is in the shinto shrine".I nodded my head in acceptance.

I asked"If It's okay to share,may I know why she committed suicide?"He was taken aback.He replied"Thank you for your concern.Not even her own family demonstrated that.Kiyamori was quite attached to her younger sister.Actually,now that I think of it,she probably had an unhealthy obsession of her sister.She payed for her college tuition,funds her hobbies,advised her,and followed her everywhere if possible,despite being responsible adults."

"The only obsession she had other than her sister was the statue you talked about.The statue was that of my aunt,Kiya mori's grandmother.She committed suicide by cutting her wrist,just like Kiyamori".

I asked"Why did she committed suicide?"He replied coldly"Your obviously a curious girl.I'll humour you.My aunt was forcibly married to an curropt administrator.When she threatened to damask him,he turned public opinion against her and managed to get her arrested for adultery.She was sentenced to be hanged,but cut herself a day before.Her only choice was the noose or the blade.The statue was a commeration of her honesty."

I thanked him,and walked to the front of the door absent minded,trying to fit in the pieces of the puzzle.As I walked out,I sensed tingling at the back of my spine.

I turned back to see a pair of glowing yellow eyes stare back at me.It suddenly skittered away,with its body not to be seen.I'm not proud of what I did next.

I ran through the street,as fast as I could,and reached home in record time.I opened a can of beer and turned on the T.V.I doubted the soundness of my mind,and thought my eyes were playing tricks on me.Yet,It had to be true.After all,I was sober back then,and my eyesight did save my life back in Afghanistan.

Also,in no way was I going to get killed like an horror movie protagonist.I don't think I'll knock on doors or investigate directly.I loaded my concealed Remington and disabled the safety.I'm going to sleep with it everyday.
