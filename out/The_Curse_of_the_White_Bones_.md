Viet never believed in ghosts. Growing up in a small, struggling village, he scoffed at the old wives’ tales whispered around the flickering firelight. But that was before he met Mr. Tan, a wealthy collector who promised Viet a life-changing sum of money. All he had to do was dig up an ancient grave.

“It’s just bones,” Mr. Tan said, his voice smooth and convincing. “They’ll bring fortune to anyone who owns them. Think of the money. Think of the future.”

The temptation was too great. Viet ignored the unease twisting in his gut and agreed.

The night was eerily quiet as Viet and three others snuck into the overgrown cemetery. The moon hung high, casting cold, silvery light over crumbling tombstones and tangled weeds.

“This one,” Mr. Tan whispered, pointing to a collapsed grave covered in moss.

They began digging. The further they went, the colder the air seemed to grow. Viet’s hands trembled as his shovel struck something hard: a rotting wooden coffin.

When they pried it open, a chill mist seeped out, carrying the faint stench of decay. Inside lay a pristine skeleton, its bones gleaming unnaturally white. Beside it, a small, ancient box rested, bound with strange symbols.

Mr. Tan’s eyes gleamed. “Take it,” he urged, snatching the skeleton and the box. Viet hesitated but followed orders, telling himself it was just old superstition.

But as they left, Viet could have sworn he heard a faint whisper:
"Give it back…"

That night, Viet couldn’t sleep. His dreams were filled with shadowy figures circling him, their voices wailing, “Return what you’ve taken…”

The next morning, he woke to find scratches on his palms—thin, bloody marks as though clawed by invisible hands. The air in his small home felt heavier, suffocating. Strange noises began echoing at night: footsteps on his roof, whispers outside his window, and the distant sound of digging.

Desperate for answers, Viet ran to Mr. Tan’s house.

He found the man slumped over his desk, his eyes wide open in frozen terror. On the floor beside him lay the box, its lid ajar. Inside was a brittle piece of parchment with a chilling message:
"Those who take, shall pay with blood."

Viet knew what he had to do. He would return the bones and the box. Alone, he braved the cold, moonlit night and returned to the graveyard.

The cemetery seemed alive, its shadows shifting with each step he took. The ground beneath him felt soft and unstable, as though the earth itself wanted to swallow him whole.

When he reached the grave, Viet hurriedly placed the bones back into the coffin. His hands shook as he set the box beside them.

“I’m sorry,” he whispered. “Please, let this end.”

For a moment, the air stilled. Then, a low, guttural laugh echoed around him. The ground quaked, and skeletal hands burst from the soil, clawing at Viet’s legs.

“No!” he screamed, struggling, but it was useless. The hands pulled him down, deeper and deeper into the cold earth.

The next morning, the villagers found the grave overturned, but there was no sign of Viet. Only a message remained, scrawled in blood across the dirt:
"You cannot escape."

From that day on, no one dared step foot in the cemetery. On moonlit nights, villagers swear they hear the sound of digging and a mournful voice crying, “Give it back…”

Viet’s fate became a legend—a cautionary tale of greed and the price of disturbing what should remain buried.

What would you do if you heard that whisper? Would you risk everything for fortune, or would you leave the dead to their eternal rest?
