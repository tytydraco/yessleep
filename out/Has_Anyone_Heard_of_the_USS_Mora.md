Let me start off by saying that the story you are about to read is not my own, but happened to my great-grandfather during World War Two.  He passed away earlier this year at the ripe old age of 99, and I discovered an old journal of his while helping my grandmother (his daughter) clear out some of his things. My great grandma died about ten years ago, but Great Grandpa Rick was pretty spry for someone close to a century old, so he had lived on his own all the way until he passed. He had always been very quiet about what he did during the war, so I was surprised to discover that he had actually chronicled some of his experiences.  I had always known that he was in the Navy and stationed in the Pacific theater, but that had always confused me, since as long as I knew him, Grandpa Rick had been deathly afraid of water.

So imagine my surprise when I found out through the journals that he had been the sonar technician onboard a *Gato*\-class submarine named the *USS Mora*.  

Most of his journal entries aren't particularly noteworthy or interesting, it's mostly just “we traveled from point a to point b today”, "I beat the boys at cards last night”, “we rendezvoused with this ship”, and so on.  He recorded a couple skirmishes that the *Mora* got involved in, but he obviously couldn’t write down what was happening in real-time since he had to, you know, help steer the ship.  The details he would write down after the fact were pretty basic: we found a ship, we shot the ship, we sank the ship, the end.

To be honest, it surprised me that my grandpa had been so secretive, because while the experiences he wrote about in the journal probably weren't worth making a movie about, it was still neat to learn what he had been through. I fully understand that different people have different feelings about sharing their experiences during wartime, but I still found it odd that even though what my grandpa went through didn’t seem particularly traumatizing considering some of the other stories out there, he barely told anyone anything. 

Now having read about the last patrol of the USS *Mora*, I understand why he had stayed so silent all these years.  It was written in a separate journal that I found in my grandpa's gun safe, hidden underneath some old catalogs and a few boxes of very old 30-06 cartridges.  I know they were old because the ammo was priced at $3.25 for a box of 20 and the catalogs advertised M-1 Garands for $89.   

Those were the days.

The journal was dated to 1953, Meaning my Grandpa must have held on to whatever story he had to tell for a few years after the war before finally deciding to record it.  Obviously it's all handwritten, and he didn't have the greatest of penmanship, so it may take some time to transcribe the entire thing.

But here is at least the first chunk:

\_ \_ \_

What happened to the *USS Mora* in the Summer of 1945 will never leave my memory. The Navy will try to say that she went down from the depth charge of a Japanese destroyer, but those who survived know the truth, even though we were all sworn to secrecy and ordered to maintain the so-called official story.  I kept a journal for most of my deployment onboard the *Mora*, but I’ve since misplaced it. I must have stashed it away in a box when Grace and I moved to Texas in ‘48, so it’s probably somewhere in the attic or shed now.

But I want to make sure the story of what happened gets told somewhere, even if no one ever reads it and the government will deny everything until pigs fly.  So I suppose I’m really just writing this for myself, and once I’m done, I can, hopefully, finally put it out of my mind.

It's been almost 10 years, but I remember everything like it happened yesterday.

The *Mora* was launched in early 1944 and was one of the last Model 4 Gato’s to enter service.  I won’t bother to write down what we did that whole year since I’m sure I’ll find those journals one day, and all that really matters is what happened in July of 45.  Plenty of allied forces were bombing military facilities all along the coastline that whole summer, and we were part of that campaign.

The *Trutta* had been sent to bomb Hirado Island in the Tsushima Strait to trick the Japs into thinking all the US subs were traveling south to get out of the Sea of Japan, when we really would be going north around the top of Hokkaido.  We were sent about halfway between the two points, a few miles southwest of Oshima Island, to make sure the route was clear and get rid of any enemy warships patrolling the area.  

We never saw any, but on the morning of our third day out there, we spotted a small supply boat coming from the south. We all thought it strange that it was alone without any sort of escort, not even a small gunboat, but Captain MacDougall didn’t want to let them get to wherever they were going, so we sank it.  They never even knew we were there. 

As we circled around Oshima Island throughout the day, a storm gradually rolled in from the west.  By sunset that evening, a thick fog had fallen over the water so much so that the lookouts couldn't see past about 30 feet, but we could tell from the dead-reckoning tracer that we had ended up roughly in the same spot where we had sunk the boat that morning.

I had just reported to the conning tower for my shift when the sonar pinged something a little over a mile away.  At first this confused me, since even with the weather being how it was, we should have definitely been able to detect something before it got that close.  But sure enough, something was out there, so I reported SJ contact at 3 points on the starboard bow. (editor’s note: forward right at about 1 o'clock)  

As someone went down to wake up the captain, Simmons looked through the periscope to check the surface, but the fog was so thick that he couldn’t see anything.  When the sonar pinged again, it showed that whatever was out there was getting closer.  I took a look through the periscope myself, and sure enough, I couldn’t see anything either.  My next thought was that we had encountered another submarine, but as I scanned the water a second time, I could just make out a small, pale-yellow glow in the fog about a quarter mile away.  I checked the sonar readings and looked back out of the periscope, and the light above the water was in the exact same spot.

Captain MacDougall got to the conning tower just then and took a look, and he saw the light in the fog as well. After verifying that there weren't supposed to be any friendlies nearby, he ordered the ship rigged for red.  The *Mora* lined up for a head-on shot and put 2 fish in the water at the target, but nothing happened.  No hit, no explosion, the torpedoes just went off into the sea. Captain checked the periscope and I checked the sonar to see that whatever we had picked up wasn’t there anymore. We were completely alone in the water again.

Obviously the entire control room went into a frenzy trying to figure out what happened to our target, and the *Mora* circled around the area to see if we could pick up the signal again.  We surfaced just enough for someone to look outside from the bridge, but nothing was seen and the fog was too thick anyway.

The captain called for a dive and brought her back down beneath the surface and we ran silent for the next 20 minutes.  The captain had just started to call for us to surface and go full speed out of the area when surprise, surprise, the sonar pinged again.  We checked our position, and we were back at the exact same spot we were when I saw the light in the periscope. Only this time, the sonar showed something behind us. Another look through the periscope showed that same faint speck of light, now at 2 points abaft the port abeam (editor’s note: to the rear left).  

Captain called for evasive maneuvers, and we started zig-zagging away across the water.  That damned light kept following us.  The boys up top fired a few shots at the light from the deck gun, and obviously hit nothing, but all our readings showed that something was following us on the surface.  MacDougall called for more torpedoes, so we fired 2 out the rear tubes, and if memory serves, we had loaded Mark 14’s in the aft torpedo room.  They were sent out as the *Mora* turned right to get out of our pursuer’s direct path.  We all waited with baited breath for a confirmed hit.  

I don’t know if I will ever forget the fear in Brooks' voice when he read the instruments to see that one of the torpedoes had broached about 500 yards out and was now circling back right at us. 

“It’s coming back sir!” was all he said before we were all thrown off our feet.  Simmons flew into the periscope column and I could tell by the sound of the crack when his head hit it that his neck was broken and he was dead before he hit the floor.  It was the last thing I saw before the lights went out.  The entire ship creaked as the aft tilted downward, and I slid across the floor because of the angle until colliding with Simmons’s body.

The *Mora* shuddered as it collided with the silt below, and I felt her slide several feet before coming to rest on the ocean floor.

\_ \_ \_

That’s as far as I was able to type out so far.  I had no idea that my grandpa somehow survived being trapped in a sunken submarine, but I probably wouldn’t want to talk about it either if I was in his shoes. To be honest, I don’t know if I should be sharing all this online, but considering that everyone who served on the *Mora* is probably dead by now, and the military would apparently deny my grandpa’s account anyway, maybe I’m in the clear.  I’ll try to get more of the story typed out for anyone who wants to keep up, so stay tuned.
