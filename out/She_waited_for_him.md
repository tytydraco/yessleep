The old house stood on a hill overlooking the town. It had been empty for years, and no one dared to go near it. It was said to be haunted by the ghost of a young woman who had been murdered there.  
One night, a group of teenagers decided to go to the house to see if the rumors were true. They snuck onto the property and made their way up to the front door. The door was unlocked, so they went inside.  
The house was dark and dusty. The teenagers wandered through the rooms, calling out to the ghost. There was no answer.  
They were about to leave when they heard a noise coming from the basement. They went down the stairs and found a door that was slightly ajar. They pushed the door open and peered inside.  
The basement was dark, but they could see a figure standing in the corner. The figure was tall and thin, with long, pale arms and legs. Its skin was a sickly green, and its eyes were black and empty.  
The teenagers screamed and ran back upstairs. They burst out of the house and ran down the hill. They didn't stop running until they were safe at home.  
The next day, the teenagers told their parents what had happened. The parents didn't believe them at first, but then they heard the news. A young woman had been found murdered in the old house.  
The police investigated, but they never found the killer. The case remains unsolved to this day.  
The teenagers never went back to the old house. They were too afraid. But they still talk about what they saw that night. They say that the ghost of the young woman is still there, waiting for her revenge.  
One night, a few years later, a young man named Mark was driving home from work when he saw the old house. He had heard the stories about the ghost, but he didn't believe them. He decided to take a closer look.  
Mark parked his car and got out. He walked up to the house and looked around. It was dark and quiet. Mark took a deep breath and went inside.  
The house was just as the teenagers had described it. Dark, dusty, and empty. Mark walked through the rooms, calling out to the ghost. There was no answer.  
Mark was about to leave when he heard a noise coming from the basement. He went down the stairs and found the door that was slightly ajar. He pushed the door open and peered inside.  
The basement was dark, but Mark could see a figure standing in the corner. The figure was tall and thin, with long, pale arms and legs. Its skin was a sickly green, and its eyes were black and empty.  
Mark froze. He couldn't move. He was too scared.  
The figure turned to look at Mark. Its eyes were like two empty holes. Mark felt a chill run down his spine.  
The figure started to walk towards Mark. Mark wanted to run, but he couldn't move. He was frozen with fear.  
The figure reached out its hand and touched Mark's face. Mark felt a cold, tingling sensation.  
The figure spoke. Its voice was like the wind in the trees.  
"I've been waiting for you," it said.  
Mark screamed and ran out of the basement. He ran up the stairs and out of the house. He didn't stop running until he was safe at home.  
Mark never went back to the old house. He was too afraid. But he still thinks about what happened that night. He knows that the ghost is real, and that it's still out there somewhere.  
Mark is just one of many people who have seen the ghost of the young woman in the old house. The ghost is a reminder that there are things in this world that we don't understand. Things that are dark and scary. Things that go bump in the night.
