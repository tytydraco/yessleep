Jhonny, Jhonny.

My mother was shouting "Jhonny, Jhonny" as she ran toward me, covering my eyes to prevent me from witnessing that scene which would haunt me for the rest of my life.

I was on my way home after riding my bicycle. A few meters from home, I heard a sound, like paper tearing behind me. Instinctively, I turned around, but I saw nothing. When I looked ahead again, in that brief fraction of a second, a burned person appeared. They were naked, and their body was so charred that it was impossible to tell whether they were male or female.

Startled, I came to an abrupt stop and fell on top of them. Their skin burned like a metal slide under the midday sun. In that moment, I got a burn on the palm of my hand and heard a whisper. That person lowered their gaze, and our eyes met. They, at the end of their life. Me, at the beginning of the end of mine.

I could barely hear them. It was as if they were trying to scream, but their vocal cords were so damaged that all I could hear were moans. After the initial shock, I screamed like never before because of the pain from the burn, the macabre scene, and the sheer terror. My mother arrived running and took me home.

Nothing was ever discovered about that body. The investigations yielded no results. Days passed, and I began to hear that same moan again. That is when my torture began. Every day, the screams grew more vivid and more intense.

My mom tried to get help by taking me to various psychologists and even shamans, but no one could explain it. It wasn’t a mental issue. The screams were real. I learned to live with those screams, although every day they became even more terrifying. Despite the torment, I managed to graduate as a physicist from college. I wasn’t the best or the brightest mind of my time, but I did earn some merits during my studies.

It was in college that I met Dr. Hollis. He resembled my grandfather, and he used to say that I reminded him of his nephew. Gradually, we became friends, and over time I became his right-hand man. He offered to pay the rest of my tuition if I agreed to work with him as his intern. I refused because I wanted to stand on my own, but still, I became his assistant and he paid for my travel expenses.

He never believed my story about the screams, but he was always kind to me. He was the father figure I never had.

One night, Dr. Hollis called me excitedly. He wanted to speak in person. When I arrived, he told me he had found a possible solution for time travel. After many trials and errors, he managed to send a mouse a few minutes into the past. The first time, it vanished without a trace. The second time, it returned, but its body was charred as if it had spent hours in an oven. He wanted me to help him improve that invention, which would revolutionize humanity.

He asked me to work with him unofficially. So after our regular work, I would go to his house to continue the experiments. It had been fifteen years since that incident with the charred body, yet the screams had never stopped tormenting me. Even though I could sometimes tolerate them, they still remained as intense as ever.

One night, just as we were about to leave, the machine turned on. We had sent something from the future into the past. It was a body.

Dr. Hollis was frightened. We did not know at what moment in the future the trip had been made, nor who the person was. They were burned, parts of their body completely charred, yet the center bore only superficial burns.

Days passed without us touching the machine until I discovered the reason the bodies were arriving like that. It was an energy cell, one that released an immense burst of heat within the machine. Once I realized this, I corrected the calculations.

When we were about to test the adjustments with a mouse, the screams changed.

"Jhonny, don't do it, please."

It was my own voice.

Startled, I stepped back and, unintentionally, pushed Dr. Hollis into the machine. He was sent into the past by mistake. He was the body we had discovered that night.

I became obsessed with fixing my mistakes. I wanted to save the doctor, to avoid seeing that person that afternoon. If I hadn’t seen them, the screams would never have begun, and I would never have killed the only father figure I ever had.

But the more I adjusted the machine, the clearer the voices became. I begged myself to stop, to not continue. But I was stubborn.

After two years since the doctor's death, I believed I had finally fixed the errors. I converted the machine into a clock so that the heat would disperse into the air. Or so I thought.

I noted down the date of the trip: that afternoon. I would be there to avoid seeing that man. Finally, I understood the clock. The sound of tearing paper was heard once again, and I began to travel back in time.

Everything was going well until the heat started to rise.

I couldn't move. The suit that was meant to protect me began to disintegrate; then my clothes, my hair. I felt my skin swell, bubbles bursting underneath it. My nails detached one by one.

I screamed as I watched myself trying to fix the errors. I screamed at myself not to do it, that it was a mistake. I saw my life in reverse as my body burned and continued screaming in pain. The smell of burnt flesh filled my nostrils, and moments later my lungs burned like hell; breathing was like dying, yet that pain was the only thing keeping me awake.

I thought about my mother. They would never find my body. She would believe that I abandoned her, that I forgot about her. Then, Dr. Hollis crossed my mind. Had he suffered the same, or perhaps worse? He wasn’t even wearing a suit. Maybe his death was quicker, I hoped that would ease my conscience.

The journey lasted twenty minutes, and the entire trip was pure torment. My voice was shattered. I could only emit agonizing moans.

Finally, I heard the sound of tearing paper once more. The same sound I had heard so many years ago when I was just a child.

I fell, my flesh burning red, on the outskirts of my house. I saw a boy on a bicycle turning to look at me, terrified, and falling onto me, burning the palm of his hand with my own body.
