Say you’re a lifelong snoop, like I am. You work from home in Koreatown (like I do) in a building full of families, hipsters, and industry grunts (like me). You stare at a computer screen all day and you need distractions. You can’t stop your mind from wandering somewhere it shouldn’t be.

I’ve got the window open for a breeze. Sound doesn’t travel well in the courtyard (the buzz of the 101 drowns everything out), but the right conversation in the right spot? Carnegie Hall, for yours truly. I’ve spied on juicy Dear John phone calls and adorable romcom meet-cutes — nobody is safe.

I come back to my desk with a reheated breakfast burrito and I hear the first detective’s voice, just outside.

“I need you to take this seriously, Miss XXXXX.”

I creep to the window, to creep further. 

I’ve seen her around the last few weeks. She’s new, she moved in with her parents. I haven’t said a word to her, I don’t have a lot in common with teenagers.

The two cops standing above her are frustrated. She hasn’t taken off her sunglasses and only reluctantly puts her phone down — barely seems to care that she’s being questioned by the police.

“When was the last time you spoke with her?”

“Before it happened? In class. Normal teacher stuff.”

“She didn’t give any indication that she was… troubled, or upset?”

“I don’t think so.”

“We had witnesses say she was having an argument right before it happened — an argument with you.”

The girl goes quiet, just for a second. She’s thinking. I know what re-strategizing looks like.

“She was… disappointed, I guess, I didn’t do well on a test and she thought I could do better. I mean, she’s right. I bombed that test. But everyone else did, too. It was her fault for making it so hard. That’s what I was telling her. You can’t be a good teacher if you don’t respect your students.”

“That was the last time you saw her?”

“I mean — the last time I saw her was when she…” She trails off and the cops fill in the blank with a nod. “But everybody saw that. Why did she do it in front of everybody? It’s so messed up.”

“Where were you, right as it happened?”

“I was with my class, we just got let out. We walked outside and we looked up and she’s standing up there on the roof, and she just takes a step and…” Her hands say the rest: *whoosh*.

“It’s interesting you say that — we talked to your classmates, they said you weren’t there, when they came outside. None of them remember you there.”

Now there’s weight to her silence. Even behind the sunglasses, you can tell — she’s glaring. And she’s not blinking.

“Do me a favor.”

The cops sway on their feet. Hands fall to their sides. Faces blank. Like a channel changing in their minds, switched to static.

Slouching in her chaise lounge, the girl crosses one leg over the other and folds her hands in her lap. She smiles up them.

“No more questions. You go now. And you forget you ever met me.”

The detectives teeter. Blink. Nod.

And they’re off, without another word.

*Who is this girl?*

I love a good rabbit hole — I start digging. 

I look up her apartment: the XXXXX family. I research the XXXXX name but it’s too generic. “XXXXX + police,” nothing. “XXXXX + teacher + death,” nothing.

On a whim, I try what the girl said: “Do me a favor”, plus the XXXXX name.

Bingo. 

A transcript on a seriously sketchy Russian video site.

The footage is grainy and garbled but the comments say it all — check out this mk-ultra girl brainwashing this cop.

The camera focuses and there she is: my neighbor, a year younger, sitting in your standard police interrogation room. Big wide table, two chairs.

Behind her — the girl’s parents sit against the wall, statue-still. Hard to tell if they’re even blinking.

I can tell the camera is behind a one-way mirror: there’s a double-exposure effect in the reflection. There are shadows are moving. This interrogation has an audience. 

The camera is at the girl’s eye-level, but I don’t think she knows it’s there; if she’d known, she wouldn’t have done what she did. *Never let them get it on film,* is what she’d tell me later — her mantra, and she learned it the hard way.

The footage begins a few moments into an interrogation: a tall, mustached, listen-here-kid detective has just sat down. Adjusts his file, sips his coffee.

“—with your cooperation, Miss XXXXX.”

“You can call me Lizzy. My parents call me Lizzy.”

“Nice to meet you, Lizzy — Would you mind helping us out with a few questions?”

“This is about Andrew, right? Ugh — what a douchebag. He was always hitting on me, on all the girls. He really thought he was something. I’m fine with what happened to him. A lot of people are.”

It took some Googling but I found the case. A week earlier, Andrew Cardiff, high school kid, walks into the street in downtown Houston and gets hit by a city bus, killed on the spot. Textbook accident, except: witnesses said Andrew was arguing with someone — a blond-haired girl his age — right before he died. Andrew’s parents cried foul play and the police were going student-by-student through his blond-haired classmates.

That includes… wait for it… Lizzy XXXXX.

I had been rereading the Houston Chronicle article, tuning out the interrogation. I almost didn’t catch it.

“—few times but I thought it was… normal. I thought it was just girl stuff. My dad always said, If you bat your eyelashes at a guy, he’ll do anything you say. I thought it was like that.” Lizzy tucks her hair behind her ear. “But it was way more. And I knew, right after I killed Andrew, I’d have to keep—“

I blink. I rewind and replay it. *Did she just…*	
	
The detective catches it too —  lurches forward and interrupts her. 

“You… Are you admitting you killed Andrew Cardiff?”
		
“Oh, absolutely.” She laughs.

“You pushed him into the street?”

“No. I didn’t touch him, he walked out on his own.”
		
The detective is confused. I am too. “But you said you killed him.”
		
“I did. He deserved it. He was a creep.”
		
“Miss ******—”

“Call me Lizzy.”

“Lizzy, I need you to take this seriously—“
		
“Why? I can go whenever I want.”
		
“You’re not free to go.”
		
“I know that, I didn’t say I was free to go. I said I can go whenever I want.”
		
The detective isn’t sure what to make of this and the back-and-forth continues. She’s toying with him. He looks over Lizzy’s shoulder to her parents against the wall. 

“Mom and dad, you wanna…” 

Mom and dad say nothing. 

“You don’t have to talk to them, you can talk to me.”

“Did you kill Andrew Cardiff?”

“I put the idea in his head. He did the rest. I’m cool like that.” Her confidence is unsettling. This girl is used to getting what she wants.

“I need you to cooperate, Miss ******, I’m sure you get a kick out of this, but we take this very seriously, so let’s quit being a pest, all right?” 
	
Lizzy’s smile goes cold. “That’s not nice.”

“Well, maybe you should be nice to us.”

“No, *you* should be nice to *me*. You really should.”

“Why?”

“Do me a favor.”
		
The detective slows — stops— as he reaches for his coffee. Muscles pulled tight.
		
Lizzy hasn’t blinked. “Smile to me.”
		
The corners of the detective’s mouth is dragged up into an awful smile he can’t control.
		
In the reflection of the one-way window, the shadows have stopped moving. The men — whoever and however many — are frozen with the detective. Faces come into focus and *everybody* is smiling, teeth clenched hard.
		
“Stand up.”

The detective rises. 

“Open the door.”
		
The detective shuffles around the table and opens the door. He sits back down. Hands on the table. Next orders, please.
		
He hasn’t dropped the smile yet — he can’t.
		
“Now sleep.”
		
The shadows fall first and the detective next, slumped in his chair. 
		
Lizzy stands, snaps her fingers at her parents, and she’s out the door. Mom and dad follow her out like silent zombies. The footage ends there.

By the end of the day, I’ve watched it maybe twenty times. Now I’m thinking about biological precedent. Snake charmers wooing cobras — farmers hypnotizing chickens — divers paralyzing sharks by flipping them upside-down. I’ve seen the videos. This stuff *sort of* happens. 

Right? 

Three days later, I look outside and I see Lizzy in the courtyard, poolside, Diet Coke in hand, and I make my decision.

Looking back, I’m honestly not sure what my plan was. Discover something incredible? Go viral? Noble enough. I was lying to myself — I was greedy little boy and I wanted to stick my nose in. 

It’s noon and hot and I’m already regretting this but I’m committed — I’m walking along the pool edge and making my approach.

She waves hello and I wave back, but all I can think of is the charmer and the snake.
  
I see the building’s pool cleaner across the courtyard. He’s giving me a look and I’m suddenly very aware of the situation: I’m a grown-ass man chatting up a teenage girl. The optics are not in my favor. 
		
Lizzy seems to know this and smiles. “What’s up?”

Our pleasantries are pleasant. She lives on the fourth floor, I’m on the first. New in town. Parents work a lot. Moved here from somewhere, I can’t remember.

But then I mention the cops’ visit.

“I wanted to ask — the other day, I heard you talking to those cops.”

Her friendly smile doesn’t budge. But she blinks, I can barely make it out behind the sunglasses.

“They were asking you questions and you — just — made them stop. Made them walk away. How’d you do that? That was — awesome.” 

Flattery is the route I’ve chosen, but I can’t tell if it’s working. Lizzy shrugs it off.

“I didn’t do anything, they were finished and I think I made a joke about it.” She sips her Diet Coke. Her eyes are hidden behind black but I still feel sized up. “Why? What did you hear?”

“It’s not that — I did some looking around. There’s this video — this girl in an interrogation in Houston who did the same kind of… trick.”

Diet Coke on the ground. Hands folded in her lap. Lizzy collects herself and looks up at me with a smile.

“I bet you want to know all about it.”

For twenty, thirty minutes, Lizzy answers all my questions. When she first noticed it. How she thinks it works (she tells me to research the “power of suggestion,” there’s an Amazon section on it). The kinds of people it works on (self-centered types).

I’m fascinated, and I don’t notice the bitterness emerging.

“Satisfied?”

I nod, dumbfounded. 

“Good. Everybody always wants to know everything. Like I’m a dancing monkey. Nobody respects privacy, it’s unbelievable.”

“I mean, people deserve to know—“

“People? Ugh. No. You know what? Do me a favor.” 

Before I know it, I’m miles away. Her words are underwater, thick and dragging and barely off-key and I can feel them resonate in my skull.

“They all say that. ‘People deserve to know.’ Why? People can do things I can’t do. Vice-versa. People don’t deserve anything. Everybody’s just trying to get by, everybody has skills that help them. What’s yours? Snooping around?”

She kills her Diet Coke, crumples it.

“No greater good stuff, be honest: you were greedy little boy and you wanted to stick your nose in. Say it.”

The words are out before I can stop them. “I was greedy little boy and I wanted to stick my nose in.”

“You all are. So you know what? Forget you saw me. Forget anything you watched about me or anything you read about me. You don’t deserve me.” She cocks her head. “I bet you’re gonna go back inside and write everything down as fast as you can, aren’t you?”

Of course I was.

“Do it, I don’t care. Make me look good. Give me a fake name — call me Lizzy. Or something stupid. No last name.” 

Lizzy picks up her Diet Coke and stands. 

“Nothing wrong with letting the world know who’s out there. *Here be monsters*, loser.” She sinks her Coke can in the nearest trash. “Your building sucks, anyway.”

And she’s off. 

Lizzy and her parents would be gone the next morning, moved out overnight. 

For what it’s worth, she’s right: the second I’m back inside, I’m typing everything down before it fades, and it’s fading fast. Word by word, the conversation is breaking apart — decaying — dissolving. The drink she’d been holding (Diet Coke, I’m 90% sure). The glasses she’d been wearing (sunglasses, but what kind?). Her face, her hair, her voice — blurred, distant. All except the name Lizzy, flashing and floating above the void, too obvious to be trusted.

But — there’s a memory that stands out, a word that was repeated. She made a reference to something.

“Do you know what the first thing I thought of was? **The Sirens**. From *The Odyssey*. I had to read it last year for this poetry class, I hated it, but there were these women on the rocks who would lure ships in with their songs. Just their voices. The ships would crash and they'd eat the sailors. They were the monsters the guys had to escape.”
		
“Are you calling yourself a monster?”
		
She was quiet, and I was worried I’d gone too far. Until she smiled.
