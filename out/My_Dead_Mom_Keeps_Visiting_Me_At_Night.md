May 26th

My name is Fisher Jacobs. My mom said it would be helpful to write out my feelings on something and talk about significant events in my life. Mainly because I’ve been having issues with depression and suicidal thoughts. I think about it a lot, too much probably. I prefer to be alone most of the time. Sometimes I have trouble even being with my friends. My mom said I spend too much time in my room in the dark so she took my curtains away. Sometimes I think she hates me. My dad is Bert Jacobs and my mom is Jennifer Jacobs. 



We live in a pretty nice house in the country. My dad owns about 100 acres of land, half is a field and the other half is woods. The house is 2 stories, the whole upstairs being my bedroom and I have a big window on one side overlooking the field. The basement is furnished and has a bedroom for guests, but it’s basically my uncle Jeremy’s room. He lived with my grandmother until she passed away a year before, ever since he’s lived here with us. My mom told him he’d have to get a job and find his own place but it hasn’t happened yet. I turned 18 today, it was a fun birthday being my first step into adulthood. 

May 27th

Last night my mom left the house sometime during the night without telling anyone, no one even heard her leave. Every morning my dad would wake me up early to go feed the chickens. As I walked out the backdoor I noticed something white swaying in the treeline of the woods. I told my dad and we made our way back, but what I saw will forever be burned into my mind. It was my mom hanging by her neck, in nothing but her nightgown.

June 10th

It’s been exactly two weeks since she died. I see her pale face, devoid of life, in my dreams every night. The coroner said it must have happened around midnight. I think dad is doing the worst, he hasn’t really talked much since it happened and he doesn’t really leave his room unless he’s going to work. He’s stopped taking care of the farm so I’ve been doing most of it. I had a really strange experience last night. I woke up in the middle of the night and felt drawn to my window. I looked out and could’ve sworn I could see someone standing out there in the field. The moonlight wasn’t strong enough for me to properly tell but it freaked me out a little. I just brushed it off and went back to bed, although it was kind of hard to fall back to sleep. I kept feeling a weird anxiety about what I saw.

June 17th

Last night I woke up in the middle of the night again. This time the motion sensor light we have on the back porch was on. So I got up and looked out the window and I saw something weird. It looked like someone was standing just outside of the light but I still couldn’t tell if I was just seeing things but I swear it looked like someone was standing there.

June 19th

I keep forgetting to write in this journal. I don’t have too much happening in my life. But I’ve been thinking about my mom a lot recently. She was deeply in love with my dad. They had known each other since high school and my mom always told me that she hoped to be with him in the afterlife whatever it was. She was hard on uncle Jeremy but she just wanted him to do better because she loved him. He was her best friend. They told each other everything. I mean hell they’re only a year apart in age. 



That’s why I can’t help but feel like I’m the reason she did it. We kept butting heads over everything. I just kept telling her I wanted to be independent and that I wanted to be left alone. She kept getting mad that I was going out and getting high with my friends instead of doing my homework and focusing on school. She just wanted me to get into a good college, have a good career, and be successful. But I just wanted to have fun. Mom I’m sorry I wish I listened to you. I’m sorry that I pushed you too far and made you so unhappy. I miss you.

June 24th

Last night I went out with my friends for the first time in almost a month and stayed out until around midnight. When I got home I circled the house to the backdoor so I didn’t wake up my dad. Luckily for me he usually leaves it unlocked for me so I can get in easier when I get home, in case I’m drunk or high. But as I rounded the corner of the house to the back porch, the porch light was already on which I didn’t really think twice about. But as I reached the door all the hairs on the back of my neck stood up and I turned around instinctively. My heart dropped, my stomach twisted into a million knots, and I froze in place. I saw her. I saw my mom. But instead of the warm comforting feeling I used to get, I felt like a fly in a spiderweb. 



She was standing in the light motionless, wearing her white nightgown. But something was wrong, her face didn’t look right. It looked as though her skin had been removed, then stretched over her skull with her mouth looking as if it was being forced to smile as if being held by hooks. Her eyes were pitch black and it looked as if she had no eyelids. Her proportions were wrong as well, as if her arms had extra bones in them. As I sat there frozen she began to make a sound like a death rattle but it was coming from her chest. She then forced out a word from her chest without moving her mouth, “Fisher”. I almost puked. It sounded like my mom but something was wrong. Her voice sounded strained and hoarse. I instantly turned, opened the door and slammed it shut and screamed at the top of my lungs for my dad. He instantly came rushing in with the gun. He asked me if I was okay and what happened. I told him exactly what I saw. He looked out the window in disbelief, turned to me and said “there’s nothing out there Fisher”. I quickly shot up and looked and he was right. There was nothing there.

June 25th

My dad pulled some strings and got me in today for a psychological evaluation. I don’t even believe what I saw myself so I agreed to do it. They diagnosed me with schizophrenia and just prescribed me some medication and that was it. We’ll see if it works I guess.

June 27th

So far I’d say the medication is working I guess. I never had any previous “episodes” so I don’t know what it’s meant to do. All I know is I haven't seen anything unnatural or strange since that night.

July 1st

I woke up last night and the back porch light was on again. I looked out my window and she was there again. Except she was closer. She just stood there not doing anything. I pulled out my phone to get a picture but when I looked through my phone she wasn’t there. She disappeared. I don’t remember falling asleep but I must have gotten so freaked out I fainted because I woke up this morning on the floor.

July 8th

It happened again. I woke up randomly again. And yet again she was there but this time she was staring directly at me. She changes what she does each time seemingly. It feels like she’s “learning” or something. I don’t understand, she’s been haunting me for weeks now. I don’t get good sleep anymore. But I think I’m figuring her out at least a little bit.

July 14th

I was in the basement playing video games with Jeremy tonight. It was fun. I felt comfortable like everything was normal for the first time since mom died. Then we heard a loud screeching noise. Jeremy brushed it off as a bobcat, which have terrifying cries, and aren’t uncommon around here. But it didn’t sound right to me. It sounded strained and unnatural. We continued playing and I noticed through the small window in the basement that the back porch light came on. I felt dread in the pit of my stomach. 



I jumped up and raced to the window and looked out and I saw her. Only this time she was crawling around on all fours. I called Jeremy to come look, he groaned and nonchalantly walked over and looked out the window. “Dude there’s nothing out there, and you gotta stop going on like this about her. That’s my sister and your mom. I know coping is hard, man. But we all just have to live with this. We all miss her.” I ended up going back to my room. He wasn’t going to believe me and I’m beginning to feel like I am going insane.

July 15th

This morning I woke up to Jeremy walking up the stairs to my room. He looked exhausted. He sat down at the end of my bed and put his face in his palms. “I saw her,” he said. I asked him to tell me everything. “Right after you left I turned on a show to watch to fall asleep to. I laid down on the couch and that’s when I saw her. She was staring at me through the window in the basement, her eyes piercing through me. Her face was pressed against the glass like she really wanted inside or something. 



I’ve never been more scared in my life. I don’t know how long she sat there and stared. I covered my face and she was gone. I immediately covered the window so she couldn’t see me and I hid in the bedroom all night waiting for something to happen. I didn’t sleep.” This honestly made me feel extreme relief, knowing I’m not going crazy. Jeremy asked if he could sleep in my room for a few nights, I said yes. So we gathered blankets and pillows to make a makeshift bed for now.

July 22nd

Last night me and Jeremy both woke up at exactly the same time to another scream like the one from the other night. But this time she wasn’t out there staring up at us. We heard the backdoor open and we both raced toward the stairs. When we got to the bottom we could see my mom standing there with the backdoor open smiling with her spine-chilling grin. She began making noise from her chest again uttering out “Fisher” but this time it was followed by “Let. Me. In.” She began repeating it. “Fisher.. Let.. Me.. In..” captivated by fear I was able to spit out the word “No”. 



After which she fell to all fours and began creeping backwards in a rigid manner, almost as if her limbs were frozen. She continued backwards out of the light, it was only once she was out of view that we rushed toward the door and slammed it shut. Me and Jeremy went back to the room and must have passed out because we both woke up this morning on the floor of my bedroom.

July 29th

When I woke up this morning Jeremy was gone. I figured he might’ve just woken up early, but I asked my dad and he hadn’t seen him. I searched the whole house and couldn’t find him. My dad said he probably just left early to go do whatever it is that he does. Part of me wanted to believe my dad, the other part was sure something more sinister happened to him.

August 5th

I woke up last night to sobbing outside. I walked over to the window and to my horror there stood Jeremy, right next to his sister. Except he was different, he had a horrifying frown instead of a grin like my mom. He was also hunched over as if his back was broken. They both looked directly at me and began moving towards my window. I sprinted back to my bed and covered myself with blankets and peaked out to look at my window. To my horror they were both staring into my room, faces pressed against the glass. Then Jeremy croaked out “Fisher.. Sorry.. Help..” as my mom asked me to let her in again. I just sat there being tormented, I don’t know how long. But as usual I fell asleep at some point and woke up this morning

August 12th

I woke up 6 hours ago at the time of me writing this entry. When I woke up I heard someone moving around in the house. I froze. But I realized it was my dad. I couldn’t make out what he was saying but I know he had his boots on. It meant he was about to go outside. I jumped down my stairs and looked toward the back door and saw my dad was already outside. I ran to the backdoor and screamed as loud as I could “DAD NOOO!!!”. He didn’t even turn around. All he said was “Jenny, wait. Please come back. I need you.” I screamed for him as hard as I could but he was already gone. I ran to his room and grabbed his gun, and as I stepped into the hallway to the backdoor, Jeremy was standing there. I aimed the gun with no hesitation and fired. 



It seemed to just go right through him like nothing. I dropped the gun and ran up to my room. I looked at my window and saw my mom, Jeremy, and now my dad. They were all talking at once, driving me insane. I grabbed the blanket off my bed and covered the window. Then I dropped to my knees and covered my face. Suddenly the voices stopped. I sat there like that for a while but eventually I just sat on my bed staring at the blanket on the window for hours. The sun finally came up. It’s 6:30 pm right now, I waited all day. I just took the blanket down and nothing was there. So I guess I’m alone now.
