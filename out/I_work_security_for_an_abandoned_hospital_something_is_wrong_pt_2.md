 I survived on sheer luck. I was able to use my baton and a piece of wood to make the shape of a cross. Before I knew it, the fire alarm stopped, and it was 7 a.m. As I limped out of the hospital, I passed out outside.

I woke up in a hospital, a splint on my ankle, and  an IV in my arm. A doctor came in and asked me my name and what I remember. I told him I worked security at the waylin oaks hospital, and I sprained my ankle.  I didn't tell him what else had happened. To be honest, I still didn't believe it. I was later discharged and sent home. 

As I got home, I got a text from Matt. He let me know I had the next 3 days off and to get some rest. I've been trying to get sleep, but all I dream about is that damn hospital. I can't escape it. I see things in my house. There's a figure with a distorted face that is posing as a child. Whatever it is, it's been getting violent. It has tried to push me down my stairs, and it  has made me feel physically ill when I go towards my front door. I think it's trying to trap me in my own home. I called Matt to let him know what's going on, but I got no answer. Just 10 minutes ago, I got a call from Matt. I explained what was happening.

Matt: "Calm down, here's what you need to do. Do you have a cross by chance?"

Me: "I have one in my room. It used to be my grandfather's."

Matt: "Good, go grab it, and walk around d you house with it. Repeat, "In the name of God, I command you to leave." "

I went and grabbed the cross, but as I turned around, I saw it. It now was a tall figure with animal like teeth.   My blood went cold, and I brought the cross up in front of me and repeated the words. It kept on walking toward me. I was terrified, I started screaming, " In the name of God, I command you to leave!" Eventually, everything went silent. I got back on the phone with Matt, and I told him it was gone.

I told him I didn't think I wanted to work there anymore. But what he told me chills every bone im body.

Matt: "I'm sorry, you can't. The hospital has bound itself to you. You will be back at the hospital one way or another, im really sorry about this. We are the only thing that keeps those things in."

Matt invited me to brunch, and I accepted. As I pulled up to the resteraunt, I saw Matt smoking a cigarette outside. He saw me, and we went inside and sat down. After we ordered, Matt started to explain more.

Matt: "As you know by now, this job isn't a normal job.  Once you survive your first night, you're bound until the hospital takes you."

Me: "Why not board it off, I mean hell, why don't they demolish the damn place?"

Matt: "It gets tricky every night, different rules, different apparitions. But one stays the same, you encountered it in your house. It is why we do this, to keep it in."

Me: "So this thing is bound to this hospital, as long as someone is there and follows the rules."

Matt: "Exactly, it doesn't play fair, so we can't either."

After brunch, I headed home and layed down on my couch. I had a giant headache, and I couldn't believe this was happening. I broke a rule, and it followed me home. I wish this was a bad dream, but it wasn't. I was scared, but what could I do? I was helpless. Matt texted me my next shift. it's in 3 days.

So now I'll be back at the hospital. I'm afraid of what it will do if I don't. That thing in my house was from the hospital, I know it. It was a warning. I'm looking for ways out of it, but I can't find one. I still see a distorted face in the corner of my eye...... watching my every move, waiting for me to come back, waiting for me to break another rule.
