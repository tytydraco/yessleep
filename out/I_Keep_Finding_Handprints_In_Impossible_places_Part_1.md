Yes, the title is accurate; for a few weeks now, I've been, on rare occasions, finding a single handprint somewhere I can't reach. It's right-handed; that's literally all that I know.  I've found prints made from various materials and peculiar places.  The ceiling is always the weirdest spot; it's really freaky. I can't explain why or how this is happening. It's not bothering me to the point I can't live life, but I'm getting really tired of getting spooked.

It all started after my grandfather killed himself, I know we've grieved enough already. My mom had told me asphyxiation was the cause, so he hung himself. PTSD is a bitch.
" His time in the war was very rough honey. You know he never even wanted to go." She told me the morning we found out.
 " Tried running from that draft and ended up with a blown arm." She sat there rubbing his prosthetic hand, holding the wooden fingers like he did when she was a kid. I could tell it brought her comfort, a way to have him here still. But it hurt way more than anything, tears stained and flowed down her cheeks. But she surprised me when she asked if I could take it home with me. I didn't like it. We didn't have much of a relationship, he spent a lot of his time cooped up in his apartment. Away from us only being seen when we would pick him up for Christmas. Even then, he sat away from us, his eyes constantly wandering. It always unsettled me, like he was tracking something. 

I'm a sucker and I'd do anything for my mom. So, despite my knee-gut reaction towards it, I accepted. She thanked me saying
"As much as I love him, it's more of a reminder of his suffering. But maybe it can bring you two closer in some way. I mean after all-" she was cut off by a knock on the door. It was a quick and rapid three knocks, scared the shit outta me. My mom ran over and swung it open, stuck her head out. Weird. She turned back to me giggling to herself.

" Those kids and their games." She said to herself. After that, her mood was strangely calm; I figured it was honestly that sick part of us that was kinda relieved he was gone. Not in spite but in that selfish desire we all have. My mom took care of him constantly, being his only daughter; she took pride in being his baby girl. But when he really went downhill, you could see how much it cost her in her eyes alone. We hugged and I began my journey back to my house. It was a good 20-minute drive through the valley of California. During it, though, I thought I kept hearing that same knock; I couldn't pinpoint where it was coming from. Inside my car or outside on my back door.

When I finally got home I just tossed the box with Grandpa in it into my hall closet. I know it's rude and all, but I didn't care at the time,ehonestly. I just wanted to have it outta my sight. I wanted to cook with peace of mind; I'm a cook for my friend's restaurant nearby, so cooking is my own form of meditation. And honestly, I needed to relax a little, I thought I might make my mom something like cake. Kill two birds with one stone, a gift for her and me. I was collecting up my ingredients, ya know mise en place. I was grabbing my container of flour when those three knocks echoed in my house. I jumped and spilled the flour on the floor and counter; I turned to grab my broom. As I cleaned a sense of fear washed over me, like my body sensed danger I couldn't. As I got up to finish what was left. My heart sank, my stomach ached the feeling of vomiting from overwhelming fear sank deep. The flour was smeared around and a handprint sat in the middle of it all.

I don't know why but I called out
"H-h-hello? Who the fuck is in my house!"  I yelled in an attempt for intimidation. The Silent response was better at it than me. I grabbed my butcher's knife and began a slow walk through my home. Specks of flour were on the floor; they led to my room, the darkness of it making it foreign territory to me. But worse were the specks that led up to the vent in my hall. And hand print right next to it. 

The sensation of fainting ran over me and with it I stumble ran to my bathroom locking the door behind me. I shakily took my phone out and tried to call the cops. I don't know what was happening, but my phone was glitching out way too much to do anything at all. Androids. They aren't too reliable. All I could do was hide out. My bathroom didn't have windows I couldn't go anywhere but out past that door of safety. Then whoever was in my house started knocking on the door. Three rapid knocks. Pause. Repeat. Then the pauses became shorter with each minute, becoming a nonstop stampede in my head. 

After ten minutes, they stopped knocking; I heard the door knob jiggle softly, then that silence again. I'm not proud but I sat there in my bathtub for a good hour or so before I even considered getting up. Stayed there so long my phone died in my pocket. I reluctantly unlocked the door and pulled it towards me, letting swing past and smack into the bathroom. Nothing was there, no one was there but me. I sighed still shaking, grabbing the knob to close the door, but my hand slipped off. I recognized this feeling; there was flour in my hand. And when the AC kicked on suddenly, it also blew out from the vent. 
I'm scared, alone in my home, my room. I'll update more soon I don't know when. There's knocking on my walls right now. 

I need to try and sleep.
