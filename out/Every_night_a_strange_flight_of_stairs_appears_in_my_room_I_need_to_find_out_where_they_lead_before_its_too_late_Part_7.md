I followed the glowing nimbus of light that always seemed just out of reach in the distance. I walked on for what felt like hours, never stopping though my body felt exhausted. I just knew I had to reach the top.

The amber light grew claws of shadow, flickering like arterial blood beneath skin. Each step upward compressed my ribs until my heartbeat felt like a fist hammering from inside my chest. Then I smelled brine again, a warning, and saw the light gutter out, replaced by the wet shine of what had to be Sherrie’s footprints turning left into nothing, vanishing mid-stride as though the corridor itself folded her away. A distant voice, something cold whispered into my mind,

“She isn’t lost, she was taken.” I pressed my palm to the last glowing print; it pulsed once, warm, then cooled to stone beneath my hand.

Suddenly I heard the unmistakable tap-tap-scratch of grabbers echoed from somewhere below, their hunting pattern reverberating through the stone. My exhausted body screamed for rest, but the sound drove me forward. Three of them at least, maybe four, their communication growing more frantic as they tracked the blood trail I'd been leaving.

I pressed myself into a shallow alcove as their shadows stretched up the spiral ahead of me. The lead grabber paused, its head swiveling, nostrils flaring at the cocktail of violence still clinging to my skin. I held my breath until my vision spotted. It moved past, dragging its bulk up the stairs with a sound like raw meat being pulled across gravel. Two more followed, searching for any scent or vibration that might indicate prey . I waited until their tapping faded to distant echoes before emerging from my hiding place.

As I moved, the stairs above transformed without warning. One moment I was climbing weathered stone, the next my bare foot touched something that sent electric warmth shooting up my leg. The material beneath me glowed with an inner fire, not quite metal, not quite glass, but something that hummed with its own strange electric field of energy.

I realized I was standing on what looked like golden glass. The metallic sheen was unmistakable, but the surface and texture was just like freshly blown glass. It flexed beneath my weight, throwing back a warped reflection, my face slick with black blood, eyes too wide, mouth working soundlessly.

The golden glass spider-webbed with cracks at every step, leaking thin streams of light that pooled like molten honey in the crevices. Somewhere below, something massive shifted, and the whole stairwell exhaled a single, weary groan. I tasted ozone, heard Sherrie’s voice fragment across the surface,

“…not glass…its alive…”

Then the panel under my left foot buckled, revealing a slow pulse of crimson far beneath, as if I walked atop the stretched skin of a beating heart. The membrane throbbed faster, matching my own racing pulse until I couldn’t tell where I ended and it began. A scream built in my throat but emerged as a choking gurgle when the surface beneath me suddenly split wider, revealing teeth lining the fissure like shattered pearls. Sherrie’s trail led directly into the wound, vanishing between ivory edges that flexed open hungrily. The stairwell had become a throat, and I was walking deeper into whatever monstrous anatomy had swallowed her whole.

Viscous golden fluid bubbled up, coating my ankle with burning cold. I yanked free, but the damage was done. The membrane began to tear, revealing glimpses of something vast and ancient pulsing below. Sherrie's voice came one last time, barely a whisper,

"The heart knows you're here... Run!"

Behind me, the stairs began to dissolve into golden mist. But my legs kept moving because they had to. The membrane split wider, vomiting that golden fluid like venom. I leaped and landed hard on the intact step above. The breathing stone beneath me shrieked. I ran ahead, each footfall cracking the golden glass and causing them to ring out like instruments.

Behind, the throat folded in on itself, devouring the steps I’d left. Ahead, the amber light sharpened to a hard point, a single star burning through black gauze. Sherrie’s voice rode its beam,

“I can see the edge, come up, come up now.”

The golden glass shattered beneath my final leap, revealing not a chasm but solid stone rising like a pier from nightmare waters. Sherrie's voice crystallized again, more frantic than before,"

Here, here!"

I clawed upward through the dissolving membrane. The breathing throat convulsed behind me, spitting golden bile as I hauled myself onto a narrow bridge that hadn't existed moments before. I scrambled, lungs burning, until the amber star resolved into a doorway haloed in white fire. Her silhouette stood silhouetted there, hand outstretched, calling my name as the wind carried her voice across the impossible height.

“Sherrie!” My voice cracked, but the wind carried her name farther than lungs could push. From somewhere above the last golden step, her answer drifted back, soft, unmistakable, riding the wind like a prayer.

“Sherrie wait!” I clawed up the final steps, the white fire licking my blistered skin. Her silhouette began to fracture, edges peeling away like burning parchment. I lunged, fingers brushing hers, only to close on emptiness. The doorway imploded with a soundless scream, hurling me backward into the dark.

I was reeling and looked around to see no stars, no stairs. From the black, Sherrie’s voice rang out again, this time inches from my ear,

“You found the edge. Now it finds you. Don’t open your eyes , don’t open your eyes” she finished. I obeyed, trying to ignore the terrible pressure I felt building in this vacuum of space and time.

Around us, the dark pulsed like lungs. Something vast exhaled, I knew I was in the presence of something large and terrible. Suddenly I felt something between my palm and realized I was holding a piece of chalk.

“Write backward,” Sherrie spoke again, “Untell it.”

The chalk was cold, like holding a piece of ice. Behind my eyelids, I felt wet lashes sweep across my cheek, Sherrie, or maybe something else that sounded like her. She was whispering the alphabet reversed, each letter a key to unmake the stair.

My hand moved on its own, scrawling on the stone above:

"**N A E R Z E**"

When I finished writing the darkness spoke. It shuddered and tore open, then there was light.

I fell toward the light, eyes still shut, clutching the chalk that was already crumbling into cold dust. Behind me the stair folded inward, swallowing the echo of all the madness I had just witnessed. The world inverted and I found myself at the top of the stairs in a plain unadorned hall with a simple unpainted door at the end.

I dared to hope that perhaps I had made it to the pinacle after all. My legs trembled as I dragged myself upright and stumbled down the corridor. I reached for the handle and turned it. The door yielded without resistance, hinges exhaling as the barrier swung inward, revealing what I prayed would be the path that led me to Sherrie and out of this madness.
