Right so I am definitely *not* going to [make it out of this alive.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/15wmuwv/i_have_a_million_dollars_and_one_week_to_live_how/) Gotta make the best of it, so… I’m here on the patio of a swanky resort, in the company of the sea and the stars and the breeze and my upcoming doom. And it’s nice. Gotta appreciate the little things while they last. I probably have just enough time to type up this account, so I’ve got a drink, and my tablet, and… it’s you and me, folks. You and me and the end.

Here we go.

\*\*\*

This is the hardest thing I’ll ever write. I’m a liar to my very core, and the thing I lie *most* about is myself. Sure I give little truths here and there. Heck, Martha could probably cobble together a pretty good portrait from all the snippets D’Shawn has sent her over the years. But I never share the *whole* of myself, and now I’m gonna crack that sucker wide open. Not that anything I’m going to say is secret, I just… don’t usually talk about how I feel about this stuff.

So.

If you’ve read the previous entries, you know I’ve run out of ideas for how to escape the Lady. In fact I’m pretty certain that none of my running ever actually mattered—at least not in the way I initially thought. All this chasing is really just a bit of foreplay, with the climax being where she kills me horribly and very, very, *very* slowly. Up till now I’ve dressed up her game with jokes, but—

Shit I’m no good at the confessional mode. Let’s try it this way. I, Jack, the observer, will now talk about Jack the hunted… a normally crafty individual much like the jackal that he relates to… but every track he’s laid and every scheme he’s schemed has failed, and he’s down to his *very last trick*.

Which is to die.

She can’t hunt him if he’s already dead.

But the way he decides to go about it is perhaps not the way you’d expect. Sure, he’s got cyanide pills and he’s keeping them on his person in case he needs to check out real fast, but that’s just the backup. See, his actual plan isn’t to kill Jack, but the *spirit* of Jack. He’s got this theory. Call it a hunch. Hard to explain, but his hackles raise whenever she’s near long before he catches sight of her. Like there’s some kind of spiritual connection that ignites when she’s close. Like they’re bound through his… emotions? No. Not quite. Through his… *essence*. The essence of Jack. His spirit, if you will. So if he can *completely destroy that essence,* as if this man, Jack, never existed, she might lose the scent.

He hates it, but there is no other way.

He *can* do it, though. Because before he was Jack, there was a time he was living under the birth name Jacqueline Kailani Tan. So it’s a pretty simple plan: eliminate Jack, the idiot who made the pact with the Lady—and resurrect Jacqueline. Hope the difference is profound enough to throw off the scent. And after one week as Jacqueline… it should all be over.

\*\*\*

So, this will sound like an exaggeration to anyone who has never transitioned, but it really *does* feel like killing myself. It’s hard, getting back to Jacqueline. I mean it is physically hard. Like a butterfly tearing off its wings and climbing into its old cocoon and trying to dissolve back into goo. My physique is now very different from before and so I have to go through quite a process. I strip off all my clothes. Shave *everything*. Stuff a bra since I haven’t got boobs anymore. (Shit I forgot how fucking uncomfortable these things were!) Slip into those tight girl jeans that hug my hips and have teensy useless pockets (why do they make girl clothes like this?) and a tanktop and hoodie and throw on some bracelets, earrings. My hair’s gotten long and unkempt but isn’t quite long enough for Jacqueline—but I style it and that works. Finally add some makeup. I’ve just done the eyeliner and am in the middle of putting on mascara when I freeze, gaze on the mirror, because looking out at me is a girl—a girl! There’s Jacqueline. Miserable, uncomfortable, wants to pitch herself onto the subway tracks Jacqueline. And the sight of her there with my eyes and features…

Oh God.

It's going to be hard for you to understand this if you’ve never felt the ungodly discomfort they call dysphoria. It cracks my soul open like an egg and pours all the insides out of me. Jack wants to punch the mirror and scream. Jacqueline wants to cry.

But hey, since I’m committed to this thing now. Gotta be Jacqueline. I cry. Which ruins my mascara so I have to do it *all over again* which means more seeing myself in the mirror isn’t this fun, Jacqueline? Isn’t it great to go through all the stuff you’ve been through already as an angsty teenager? Oh the teenaged years. Fun times eh?

Anyway after Jacqueline gets her shit together she starts up her new ipad and makes some new accounts for herself in her girl identity. Non-grifting accounts, Jacqueline is looking for work as a ~~bartender~~ (no, will be too tempted to drink) barista. She immerses herself in girly things, goes to the library and asks about book clubs, cats, yoga. Goes to the gym to try some pilates. No one but us girls! She knows she is *truly* a girl when a customer is struggling to figure out where the button is to buzz into the bathrooms—it’s admittedly a confusing layout—and she tells him where and he ignores her because oh that’s right—people don’t listen to girls. Maybe this genius will someday finally find *the button* and explain later to her where he found it. She’s smirking but stops when he looks at her funny and she tries again to show him the button and he’s like, “Found it.” Welcome back to girl life, Jacqueline!

Back at her airbnb, she types up the previous post, carefully, in bits and pieces, because she doesn’t want to immerse herself too much in remembering Jack, even though writing is pretty much the only time she doesn’t dream of throwing herself off a building.

But hey, on the plus side, not so much as a tingle in her spine, not a flutter of red—no sign of the Lady!

A new day dawns and Jacqueline does some shopping and has yogurt and salad for lunch and heads to the salon. In the afternoon, she takes her newly acquired yoga mat in her newly acquired yoga pants and sweatshirt and goes to the yoga studio. There are only girls there. She goes to the small restroom/changing area, almost balks when she sees the door marked WOMEN with the universal symbol of the woman in a dress, a door ~~he~~ she hasn’t entered in years. And it’s like the final mark of total transformation. Back into the cocoon.

Then I’ve pushed the door open and entered and Jack is gone, there’s only Jacqueline.

There is no one in here but me. I use the facilities, come out and wash my hands, grab my things from the small bench and am about to leave when the door opens and another girl walks in…

Dressed all in red. Red yoga pants, red crop tank. Way hotter and way curvier and with legs that put me to shame. This incredibly hot, vibrant, gorgeous woman. And my heart rate spikes but I’m Jacqueline now. A girl on her way to yoga class. Jacqueline says, “Excuse me” and walks by—

Fingers clamp on my wrist.

And then I’m gasping as the Lady pushes me against the wall like some sort of schoolyard bully intimidating a smaller and younger girl. Her red lips curve in a smile.

“Ohohoho, Jack, did you really think I wouldn’t find you?”

*Yes.* Because I’m not me. Because who you want is Jack, the scammer, the cocky grifter who signed your contract—not some scared girl who hasn’t found herself yet. “I,” I stammer. “I d-don’t—”

“You really thought just changing what you *look like* would be enough?” She chuckles, tracing her finger along my chin. I am frozen. Stiff as a hare caught in the eyes of a predator, unable to move, unable to so much as whimper as she leans in close to whisper into my ear, her warm breath tickling my skin hot and chilling my bones cold: “You’re still *you* in there, Jacky Boy. No amount of makeup or dress up will change that. And I’m still *me*. And I’ve caught you.”

I slump, because she’s right. At least about the killing me part, and there’s nothing I can do. I thought—I have this *sense,* call it instinct, that what she’s really hungry for isn’t flesh and blood but something else, something deeper, and she only gets that from her prey another way: fear, anguish, pain. I think the fear is what she feeds on. And if I wasn’t feeding her—if I could change so she lost the taste of me…

But I’ve failed. And as I sink down almost in a faint and she gives a laugh that’s almost a purr I think *yeah, fuck, she’s tasting all that terror and this part is just the snack; the* agony *when she ties my intestines in a bow is the main course*… I close my eyes. She leans down toward my throat, and shadows coalesce around me.

But I’m not ready. Not ready to die just yet. And in a surge of panic I lash out, flinging the yoga mat. She knocks it aside, snarling, and I feel the fabric of my hoodie ripped by her claws as I leap over the bench, swinging a stall door so that it smacks her face when she lunges. I dash into the hall, feet pounding across the floor—but as the hairs on my neck prickle, I catch a subtle swirling of darkness in the stairwell ahead. So I pivot *hard* and hurl myself through a window. Glass shatters and tinkles around me like rain. I’m two stories up, the alley outside rising up to meet me. And thank God—again—for that parkour training, because there’s a truck below and I miraculously don’t break my face or my legs when I hit it, rolling off it to the pavement and hitting the ground at a run. A car almost flattens me at the intersection, and the tires squeal as it brakes. A young man steps out and shouts, “Hey, are you okay?”

“No, no, there’s someone chasing me, HEEELP!” I cry in my girliest voice and run to him. I point back in the direction I came from, and as he squares his shoulders to go and face whoever is after me I hop into the driver’s seat, shut the door, and peel away.

“HEY!” he shouts.

“Thanks bro!” I call out to him in a deeper voice, and laugh.

\*\*\*

First things first, I get back into my own jeans and button-down and jacket and scrub away every trace of makeup or product. Can’t do anything about my smooth face but I get a proper haircut so I guess now I’m cleancut Jack instead of scruffy Jack but at last I’m *back*, baby, *FINALLY!* And it feels so good to be me.

Now let’s all agree to *bury* Jacqueline and pretend that last part never happened. Also give me a sec while I go do some pushups, grab a beer, punch some stuff or whatever stupid shit I need to do until I stop feeling like—why the *fuck* does my hair still smell like lavender? Fuck’s sake.

“But Jack,” you ask, “if you’ve only got a short time to live and everything about this last section sucks so much, why are you wasting your few precious hours telling it?” I’m so glad you asked. Basically, I am trying to… not come clean, exactly. And not clean up my act either. ‘Cause look, obviously it’s not like I can “undo” all the grifts I’ve pulled. But there’s some part of me that feels if I’m going to die, I should be honest at least once. Completely, totally, bare-it-all-even-the-ugly-bits honest, even if it strips me down past flesh and bone to the deepest and most terrified and messiest and human parts of my soul… I just have to, *one time*, tell the truth.

Not because it will save my life. It’s waaaay too late for that. I just don’t want to… shit.

*Shit.*

I hope you appreciate how hard truth is for me. Lies are so much more comforting and comfortable… I am full of pleasant lies. But… the truth…

What the Lady said the other day *really* got to me. About—about picking me because I’ve got “no strings attached.” *“Who’ll miss you, Jack?”* I dunno, my terrible ex? The family I don’t talk to? The first person who’ll probably notice I’m gone is honestly my dealer. This didn’t bother me a whole lot when I had the rest of my life to figure stuff out. But now that I’m down to a couple hours, I wonder… should I tell Martha the truth? *Beg* her forgiveness? I’ve been fantasizing these past few days about coming clean to her and us becoming friends. Isn’t that pathetic? But… I just want even one person to care that I’m gone there’s not even *one*….

Yeah. When it comes down to it, that’s how much Jacky Boy is worth.

Truth… really sucks. I don’t know why I’m sharing this. I guess at this point, it doesn’t matter. *Nothing* matters. But hey. Maybe learn from my mistakes. Don’t be like Jack. Avoid signing sketchy contracts with gorgeous strangers. Be a good person. Develop some fucking strings. You probably already have those.

Lucky you. I mean that. Lucky you. Cherish them. Wish I had your luck.

\*\*\*

The Lady is here. Honestly, I don’t think she’s ever been far, ever since the beginning. I’ve gotten a feel for her. The prickling of the hairs on my skin—that’s just when she slips on the human disguise. But the rest of the time, I still sense her near, like a breath on the back of my neck… she is with me, all the time, whether I am asleep or awake or conscious of her or not.

There never was any escape. Never has been.

It has always been a rigged game.

So, the plan? In my mouth is a cyanide pill. Bite down, and I’ll lose consciousness in seconds and die in minutes. The pill is for my last, desperate gamble. I haven’t decided whether to take it or not. Over the past few days, I’ve been reviewing all I know about the Lady. That she likes contracts. That she does not lie (but doesn’t tell everything). That the color red is a distraction—like a matador’s cape, when behind the cape is a sword. Don’t look at the red. Look at the *shadow*.

I’ve learned *some* things about her, but not enough. Not yet. (And even if I did learn enough to formulate some kind of plan, I couldn’t tell you—she *definitely* reads my posts.)

Oh. Here come the tingles.

\*\*\*

So. I am writing the rest of this with the Lady here at the table. Say hey, Lady! She’s been gracious enough to allow me to finish this for you all, so cheers to that. If you’re able, have a drink for me.

Continuing where I left off… all the hairs on my neck rise and there’s a clack of high heels and she pulls out a chair and sits down across from me. Stunning, as always, her lips curved in a seductive smile—though her eyes, I always notice now, are forever flat as a doll’s. *If only* past me had seen this! (Gee, why *didn’t* past you see it sooner, Jack? Well, it’s because I, uh… wasn’t looking at her eyes.)

I offer to pour her a glass. “A drink, Lady?”

“No thanks.” She smiles. “I’m planning on dining later on.”

I shrug and pour one for myself. Take a swallow for courage. “You uh… you really get off on scaring people, huh?”

“I like fear, yes. And the chase. But… the best part is always the climax…” She reaches out to trace a delicate finger along my cheek.

I swallow hard, perspiration beading on my skin. Take another swallow and tap my fingers anxiously on the rim of the glass. “Will… will it hurt?”

She smiles.

“Um.” *Gulp*. “Ok then. Will it… will it be long?”

“I do hope so.”

“*Fuuuck.*” It is somehow much more terrifying to hear her say it aloud. And because there’s nothing I can do anymore, nowhere to go, the jig is up, no actual plan or any final ace up my sleeve… I wipe the tears from my eyes. And then I wipe more. I keep wiping at them, trying not to let them fall, wishing I’d never grifted Martha or Jeremy or *anyone* because maybe if I’d lived a better life… maybe I wouldn’t be here…

“Now Jack, you know, sorrow’s not much fun.” She frowns. “Makes the flavor bitter. Fear, that’s the best seasoning. But if you’re just going to melt into a puddle I’ll have to add more pain to offset all that bitterness.” I wince at the feel of her nails on my arm.

“Yeah well you know, Lady, I have a feeling pain is not going to be a problem for you soon. In fact I have a hunch you’re going to season with it quite liberally. I mean, why can’t you season with, I dunno… ooh, one more chance? Maybe with one more chance. I final bit of zest.”

She smiles and shakes her head. “Sorry, Jack. I’ll let you finish your post but then…” She sighs almost mournfully, leans her chin on her hand. “Well, it’s all a bit sad at the end. Your fear’s gone stale and you’ve given up and your heart’s not in it and it’s clear you’re an animal on his last legs. At that point, when the prey is just limping along, wanting it to be over, well… it’s time to end it, isn’t it?”

My heart sinks, but she’s right. I don’t have any spirit left. Any real will to fight. And I *do* want to get it over with.

“… The thought of all that pain, though, is a real motivator,” I mutter, shifting the cyanide pill around in my mouth. And somewhere, deep inside me, the jackal wheels are turning. Still thinking, desperately seeking a way out.

And he thinks he’s found a way.

But it’s risky. Risky as in I don’t think I’ll be able to post again. Chances of me coming back are basically none. But at this point a million to one is better odds than just sitting, waiting, dying.

I’m still slowly turning the pill under my tongue and she asks, “What are you gonna do with the cyanide, Jack?”

“Bite it. Dead in three or four minutes.”

“So why haven’t you?”

“Gonna offer you a deal.” She leans in, listening. The shadows around me grow closer. *Watch the shadows, not the Lady.* I lean in, also, and raise my eyebrows. “I’ll spit out this pill for one more chance—a final throw of the dice. Give me an hour’s head start. If my gamble fails, you get your meal. No cyanide.”

She frowns, looking me up and down. *Watch the shadows.* I watch them, study them. The likelihood of success is… this doesn’t translate well across my keyboard, but if you could see me sitting here typing, I am holding my thumb and forefinger pinched together to represent the infinitesimally small chance of success. I am 99.999999% sure to die horribly. But if I succeed… if I succeed, I might stop the Lady from ever hurting anyone ever again. Might do one good deed in my life. Even if I have to give up my own to do it.

“Fifteen minutes,” she says finally.

I sweat. That’s not enough time. I drum my fingers on the table. But I won’t get a better offer. Do I bite and die quick? Never make it to thirty? (God, I’d love to hit thirty!)

Or…

Or do I take the biggest gamble of my life? Go all in, even with the odds a million to one against me?

*“Will it be long?”*

*“I do hope so.”*

Fuuuuck. I close my eyes. Inhale. Exhale. Okay.

“Deal,” I say, and it feels like there’s no air anywhere in the atmosphere. I cannot even breathe. I hold out my hand, and the Lady takes it.

“Your fifteen minutes begins the moment you hit post,” she says, indicating my screen. Then she settles back, smiling. She’s in no rush now. After all, the night is long—and you *like* night, don’t you, Lady? You like darkness. *Watch the shadows.*

I spit out the pill.

\*\*\*

If you’re reading this now, I’ve already posted and the fifteen minutes is likely up and whatever has happened has happened. I can’t update. Not unless I got very, very lucky. And even then… Probably not gonna see thirty.

My last act, besides posting, was to write a letter to Martha. If my life were a Hallmark movie I’d write to tell her the truth—confess I was D’Shawn all along and that my real name is Jack and include a photo of what I *actually* look like and beg her forgiveness and she’d be angry but then we’d become friends and I’d maybe go have Thanksgiving at that nice big house of hers and try her famous apple brown betty. But… this isn’t a Hallmark movie.

What would *actually* happen if I told her the truth is that I would shatter her trust in a world far too short on trusting people. So I don’t. But I *do* send money back to Martha with a letter from D’Shawn thanking her for making a difference in his life, telling her he can now pay off his debt to her and she should put the money toward helping some other kid who needs it… It’s a lie but a better lie than a lot of the other ones I’ve told. I send the rest of the money to people I figure could use it, and to various charities to help young idiots like me so maybe they can, I dunno, find a better path than mine was. Wish I’d had more left of it to do that with, actually, but hey, for those it reaches, it’ll mean something. Could mean the world. And that’s what I tell Martha, too. That her support all these years meant the world. Thanks for everything, Martha. [Love, D’Shawn.](https://www.reddit.com/r/QuincyLee/comments/11nxwz3/welcome_thanks_so_much_for_stopping_by/)
