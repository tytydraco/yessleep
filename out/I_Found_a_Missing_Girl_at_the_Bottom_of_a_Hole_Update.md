When I posted my account of what happened on the mountain a few weeks ago, it was my hope that by telling the story, I would find some sort of… validation? Maybe I thought that by writing down my experience and sending it out to the world, it would somehow rid me of the feelings of dread, the anxiety that has been haunting me since I left the trail, as though it were some ancient ritual to cast out the bad energy.



If that were the case, I must have done it wrong. I’ve read and re-read what I posted, but that lingering sense of unease has persisted; in fact, I would say that it’s gotten worse. Maybe if I had included the personal aspect, the dreams, the unexplained and illogical desire to go back to that god forsaken pit – If I had told someone what was going on, maybe then it wouldn’t have come to this. It’s too late for that now.



The first few nights after I got home from our ill-fated trip, the dreams were relatively tame. I would fall asleep and enter a vision of falling through an inky blackness, wind rushing past me as my body reached terminal velocity. I would wake up mid-fall to a cortisol-saturated brain and a tightness in my chest, which would subside throughout the day, then begin to creep back into the periphery of my consciousness as the sun set – a daily reminder that I would soon return to my perpetual plunge.



As the weeks passed, I fell deeper and deeper into the void and began to hear the distant voice of that little girl calling out for help, echoing from below… far, far below. Still, each night, I would fall a little closer, the cries slowly becoming clearer, only to awake feeling as though my chest were about to collapse in on itself. 



It got to the point where I didn’t sleep much. Maybe three, four hours a night – just long enough where I wasn’t falling asleep at work, but short enough to ensure I didn’t enter REM sleep. It worked for a month or so, but the sleep deprivation began to affect my daily life and proved itself to be an unsustainable solution.



I finally relented and made an appointment with my doctor. On the way to the appointment, I seriously considered telling her the whole story, but I knew that by talking about a demonic voice at the bottom of a pit, crying out in a little girl’s voice for help, would very likely prompt a prescription of antipsychotics and a referral to a shrink. Maybe that’s exactly what I needed, but I ultimately decided against it and gave her some bull shit story about general life-induced stress and difficulty sleeping, which got me what I thought I wanted: anxiety and sleep medications. They only made it worse.



The anxiety meds helped throughout the day, but the sleeping pills seemed only to feed the dream – it began to feel just as real as any waking moment – lucid even. The voice would get closer and closer with each passing night, the timbre more distorted, and I began to understand that I would soon reach the bottom, met by a sudden stop and whatever it was that was calling out to me.



I stopped taking the meds altogether and replaced my nightly pills with several shots of whatever liquor I could get my hands on. Once I was sufficiently drunk, I could sleep a dreamless sleep. Obviously, this was the least healthy thing that I could have done, and no surprise to anyone, it turned into a dependency. Sure, I had stopped falling, but at what cost?



I had stopped talking to my friends and family by that point. My performance at work fell, which turned into write-ups and eventually a pink slip. With no job, no friends, and no will to do anything but drink, I sat in my apartment with the last bottle of whisky I had on hand. I cried. I sobbed, I wept, I threw the nearly empty bottle against the wall, creating a hole that ensured I would lose my security deposit.



All I had done was try to help save this little girl. I had forgone my plans and done what was right, and what did I get? Nightmares, alcoholism, and debilitating depression. I couldn’t understand why this was happening to me.



So, half drunk, still in denial, I posted my story.



It seemed that I didn’t have enough liquor that night before I fell asleep. I hit “Post” on my phone, set it to the side, and finally let my eyes close. I was instantly returned to the fall. The familiar rush of wind seemed to be that of a hurricane, much stronger than it had ever been before, and the abyssal darkness felt like black ichor that coated my skin, blocking my ears, nostrils, and mouth – It was suffocating. The familiar voice, now entirely inhuman, cried out. The words were muffled, but clear.



“You’re almost there.”

  


The gate to the campground was still closed and locked when I got here this morning. By the looks of it, the area’s been shut down for some time, since weeds have grown up between the benches and grills, and dead limbs litter the walkways and tent pads. The “Main Street” trail was about the same, nearly impassible in some areas, as a year’s worth of rain had eroded the path.



I found the last spot along the trail where there’s any cell service, and I’ve been sitting here for some time typing this out. The glade isn’t much farther from here because I can faintly hear the voice calling out to me, echoing through the trees.



It sounds almost happy.



I’m not sure what I’m going to find at the bottom, but I have to know. I can’t keep living like this.



If I do somehow make it out of this, I'll be sure and post what I find here. If you don't hear from me, **please** don’t come looking for me. The last thing I need is the thought that this might happen to someone else on my account.
