I'm not going to share my real name here, it's reddit and I really don't need some weirdo showing up on my doorstep, so if you really want to call me by a name you can just call me Markus.

I work late, now it's not exactly important where I work but just know I can get pretty tired after a shift, and god forbid I get hit with the boss asking me to stay late. I usually drive a crappy 2002 Dodge Neon, it was blue and falling apart, and then it did fall apart. Now on one hand I don't have to pay for parking when I'm home, and no more driving 30 minutes out to get gas, because of course they wouldn't build a gas station in the middle of the city.

Now, to actually get into the story. I usually get off around 6pm, but we had a project ending pretty soon and as we were behind on our goal my boss asked me to stay until ten. Well, ten turned to twelve and twelve turned to two in the morning. Thankfully the guy in the cubicle next to me was kind enough to get me a coffee when he took his break but that really only kept me going til one, and by the time I was able to leave rolled around I was dragging my knuckles on the floor; as if I was some kind of ape you'd see at the local zoo.
I was basically sleepwalking at this point as I shambled to the elevator down to the parking garage, and as I stepped out it dawned on me. My car? Yeah, you know where this is heading.

 I groaned as I walked towards the garage's exit door, the lights were all on, but it was dim and it made the bright red of the exit sign even more noticeable. I weakly pushed the bar of the metal door, it opened with a deafening creak and I was hit with a blast of cold air. It was the middle of summer, and it wasn't uncommon for nights to be cold but the air nipped me more than usual that night.

I live in a relatively big city and looking back on it now it was weird that not a single car was on the streets that night; now that I'm thinking back on it maybe I just didn't notice because I was so exhausted. Though at the time this thought didn't cross my mind as I shambled onto the sidewalk. I racked my brain abit as I slowly ambled towards my apartment complex; though to be quite honest I think I was just walking aimlessly, nonetheless I kept going on the sidewalk down the same road and not a single car passed by. My phone was dead since we can't charge them at work so I really didn't have much to go off of when walking home except for the landmarks I remembered.

There was a point where I stopped right at an alley. I don't know what was going on in my mind but I decided that it'd be a good short cut; I've gone back there on my walks to work and every time I can't find the exact alley, and again maybe I was just tired and lost track of where I was at the time but if not did it just disappear?

Anyways, the alley was dim and when I began walking it the sound of my footsteps became louder, or I just became more aware of them. Each time I lifted my foot and took a step forward it emitted a wet slop sound; And as I went further the floor's texture felt like that of raw ground beef. At this point I looked back to see if I could just go back but all I saw was pitch black; even the light from the road lamps were gone at this point. I looked forward again and I thought I saw the weathered pale brick walls ripple, or maybe they shivered, I'm really not sure. I was fully awake at this point and I kept walking forward.

The shlop, shlop, shlop of my feet hitting the floor continued. My heart was racing and I couldn't see anymore than a foot in front of me. I walked for maybe 20 more minutes before something happened. The floor became sticky, I didn't want to look down. The walls wobbled lightly and their pale red turned into a fleshy pink, the brick pattern still formed upon it. I kept walking.

Another 20 minutes later and it was hard to move, I was weak from lack of sleep and the floor was dragging me down. The walls seemed to have narrowed from when I first began, previously being a space wide enough for a car, now I could touch both walls at the same time. A light above me turned on, and I didn't want to look up. It illuminated 5 feet around, revealing the glistening walls and the fleshy textures, as well as the soup of what seemed to be thick half liquified bright pink flesh.

At this point I screamed, and panicked and I began to run. I grabbed the walls and used them to push through the sea of liquid I was waist deep in, they pulsed and waved with each push of my hand. I closed my eyes, screaming, yelling for anyone to help me, and before I knew it I had fallen forward. I expected to meet the repulsive liquid, face to face, but I just hit concrete instead, and as I looked up I realized I was at my complex door, and when I looked back all I saw was the street, lamps on, and cars passing by. I have nothing to show for what happened but I swear it did, and if anyone has had any experiences like this I'd appreciate you reaching out. Maybe we can get the government involved? I really don't know.
