[I landed hard on my feet.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/o6sali/how_to_survive_camping_a_mask_of_skin/)  The impact pitched me forward and I rolled head over heels, losing hold of the face in the process.  I slammed against a dirt wall and for a moment I lay there, breathless.  Then, painfully, I rolled over and picked myself up.

I’d brought a flashlight with me because I’m not stupid, so I flicked that on and looked around.  Above me yawned the mouth of the pit, but the top of it was only a pinpoint of light barely as big as a marble.  No meaningful light made it this far down.  It was odd - it hadn’t *felt* like I’d fallen this far.  I surely would have broken both my legs and probably worse if I’d actually fallen that distance.  Yet here I was.  I patted around to see if I’d lost anything else.  The radio was still on my belt but only static came through when I tried to contact the old sheriff.

It seemed I was no longer completely on the campground.  But that should surprise no one.

I stooped to pick up the face.  I held it by one ear and shone the flashlight on it.  The skin glowed like a sunset in pink and orange as the light illuminated the thin flesh.

“It’s just you and me now, buddy,” I said with fake cheerfulness.

Look.  I live alone.  If I didn’t talk to myself - or a skinned face, in this case - the silence would be way too much to handle.

I gently tucked it in my back pocket, just enough so that it wouldn’t fall out but that its mouth was still able to speak, if it chose to do so.  I felt bad putting it back there at all, but I wanted my hands free.  I shone the light around the narrow confines of the base of the pit.  Sheer sides of frosted earth surrounded me… save for a small tunnel at the very bottom.  I crouched next to it and directed the light down it.  It continued on as far as the flashlight could reach.  I dropped to my hands and knees and tentatively put my head and shoulders in.

I fit.  Barely.  But I couldn’t bring the duffel bag backpack.  Uneasily, I stripped it off and threw it aside and then tried again.  This time, I was able to enter the tunnel up to my waist.  There I stopped.  My heart was pounding.  My palms were sweating.  And I wasn’t even *in* the tunnel yet.  A myriad of horrible possibilities raced through my mind, foremost of those being getting stuck.  It sounds like such a simple thing, right?  Stuck.  Yet this far under the earth, alone with no hope of rescue… the mere thought of it, of the earth closed in on all sides, was enough to send a shiver down through my spine.  My stomach twisted uneasily.

I guess I’m a little bit claustrophobic.

“It’s fine,” I said to myself.  “I’ll just… keep my eyes closed.”

I crawled into the corridor.  The earth pillowed around my arms as I crept through the soft soil.

“It’s fine,” I repeated to myself.

A stubborn mantra propelling me forwards.  I squeezed my eyes shut tight as I crawled, thinking that if perhaps I couldn’t see how close the sides were to me, I wouldn’t have to *think* about it.  I could dismiss the crumble of dirt on my back as being from somewhere far ahead and the faint brushes against my arm were nothing but a breeze from the exit.  Yes.

Then something grabbed my ankle.

I screamed and kicked.  My eyes shot open.  I twisted, desperately trying to turn my head to see what was behind me, but there was no way I could in these narrow confines, and the side of my head only smashed painfully into the wall of the tunnel.

Then just as quickly, the touch was gone.  I lay there, shaking violently, lightheaded from my panicked struggles.  It was an effort to get moving again.  This time, I kept my eyes open, and saw how the walls of the tunnel were mere inches away as the flashlight jumped erratically with every forward movement of my arm.

I can’t say I overcame my fears at that moment.  I just… knew I couldn’t go back.  If I wanted out of this, I had to keep moving.  So that’s what I did.  I kept moving.

And as I moved, *something* kept grabbing at my hair.  My clothing.  My limbs.  The touch was cold and each time I stopped and tried to look, I couldn’t move my head far enough to see what it was.  My throat was tight with fear.  I resolutely told myself that it was my imagination.  They weren’t trying to impede my progress, after all.  Just a light grasp, enough to send my heart racing, and then it was gone.

I think… I knew what it was.  I just didn’t want to admit it to myself.

...there are no ghosts on this campground.  No spirits of the dead of any kind.

Perhaps it’s because they’re all here.  Trapped.  In the maw of the mass grave.

Finally, after what felt like an eternity of crawling, the tunnel abruptly ended.  I pulled myself out into another chamber, a roughly hewn square of earth.  I remained there for a moment, catching my breath and trying to loosen my trembling muscles.

As I recovered, I looked around the chamber.  Barren, just as the other one had been.  There was an exit on the other side and while the tunnel was narrow, I could at least stand and walk through it.  That was a relief to see.  To my right there was one spot where the even symmetry of the wall was disturbed.  A large clod of dirt had crumbled off.  Intrigued, I moved closer to investigate it.  Things don’t happen by chance in places like these, after all.

“Hey, is something awful going to happen if I mess with this,” I asked the face, pointing towards the depression in the dirt.

No response.  I drew my knife and used the blade to scrape away more of the dirt.  The harvesters would probably cut off my fingers if they knew about this.  But I really didn’t want to use my hands.  The memory of something grabbing my ankle was seared into my brain.

The dirt fell off easily and then an entire sheet of it slid free.  I hastily backed away before it crumbled all over my boots.  Then I shone the light on what lay behind it.

I stared at a brick wall.

I pressed my fingers against it.  Old brick.  Very old brick.

Mattias had referenced a basement.  I’d thought it was nothing more than an idle thought, based on how casually he’d mentioned it.  But now… I was staring at a basement wall.

Was it part of the mass grave?  Or were these disparate parts of the campground connected somehow?  Was I supposed to find it?  My head spun.

I tried to unearth more of it, but the dirt quickly grew hard and my knife was ineffective at getting through the solid earth.  Defeated, I left the basement behind.  There was another corridor waiting for me, after all.

I began to hear voices as soon as I stepped foot into it.  Just a soft gasp of surprise at first.  I couldn’t place where it came from.  Like it echoed in the air all around me.  I kept the flashlight beam steady on the ground in front of me.  Then another voice joined it.  Weeping.  Anguished weeping.  Then another.  Someone crying for help.  More and more joined the cacophony as I kept walking forwards.  Anguished screams.  Pleading.  Begging.  Shrieks.  Unnerved, I quickened my pace, not really caring if I misstepped and turned an ankle anymore.  I had to get out of here.

I knew this sound all too well.

I was listening to the cries of the dying.

And all around me the air continued to grow colder.  I began to shiver and I realized I’d made one really stupid mistake.  I was searching for the mass grave - the source of the frost - and I hadn’t brought a jacket.

My breath steamed in the air.  I felt my lips drying out and the flashlight’s beam jumped to and fro from my shaking.  I was close to the source.  To the grave.  I could tell.  The cries around me had reached a fevered pitch that rang in my ears.  I could feel the cold against my teeth with every breath I took.

Then the tunnel widened in front of me and I was nearly blinded as my flashlight fell upon something that glittered and shone and sent sparkling rays of light bouncing throughout the chamber.  I squeezed my eyes shut and slowly opened them, letting them adjust to the brilliance.  Like staring into the heart of a diamond.  Rainbows danced on the surface of the structure in front of me and hung shimmering in the frozen air.  Tendrils of frost misted across the ground in a pale cloud.  And in front of me was a massive formation of ice, like a crystal with thousands of irregular panes, each shining blue and white in the beam of my flashlight.  It glowed from within, swallowing up the light and spinning it outwards once again so that the entire chamber sparkled.

It would have been gorgeous, if it wasn’t also filled with dead bodies.

They were frozen into the crystal, tattered and torn with gaping wounds, missing limbs, and crushed skulls.  Some were stripped of their flesh, others were burned beyond recognition, another that I could see was carefully cut open and the body cavity was devoid of organs.  They protruded from the ice in a myriad of contorted positions, limbs dangling, their flesh pale and coated in frost.

They whispered to one another.  Their mouths did not move, yet they spoke to one another.

They had noticed my entrance.

“Uh, hi,” I said tentatively.

“Another body for the grave,” a voice from near the top of the structure sighed.

“Their family hasn’t changed much,” another added.

It took a moment for me to realize what they were talking about.  I fumbled for the face in my pocket.

“This, uh, wasn’t my doing,” I said hastily.  “I found it like this.”

“You hold yourself responsible.  That is enough for us.”

“Is it because you *are* responsible for some of us?”

“Yes.  I think it is.  Among other reasons.”

The conversation was bewildering to follow.  No sooner had one finished talking than another voice would cut in.  I didn’t know who to address.

“Is… everyone that died on my campground here?” I asked.

“Most are.”

“Then… my parents?”

I was afraid of the answer.  I desperately wanted to know, but I was afraid.  So so afraid.

“Are not here,” one replied flatly.

It hurt.  That brief spark of hope was only alive for a handful of seconds, but it swelled and filled my heart and it left me feeling hollow when it went out.  Like someone had gouged out the inside of my chest.

Is it selfish of me to want to hear their voices?  Even if it meant they were trapped here in this frozen hell?  I suppose it is.  I’m not sure what I would say to them.  I feel… angry.  How could my mother have forgotten about the window?  How could my father have left me alone like this?

Maybe it’s for the best.  I blinked away tears from my eyes.

I needed to focus.  I’d come here for a reason.

“I’ve come to bury you,” I said.  “The shepherd is waiting to take you away.”

“We know the shepherd is waiting.”

My blood ran cold at the disdainful answer.

“If that is what we wanted,” the voice continued, “wouldn’t we have gone with him long ago?”

A crack appeared on the surface of the ice.  I glanced desperately around for an exit.  It was futile to go back the way I’d come.  I couldn’t climb up that hole.  I was trapped here unless there was another way out.

“I’m trying to save you!” I said desperately.

“You can’t.”

“Perchta said I could save them all.”

“You can’t.”

A flat monotone.  Anger swelled in my belly.  After everything I’ve done, everything I’ve *suffered*, this is what I get?

“Why is that?” I snapped.  “Am I not strong enough?  I’m getting there.”

“And yet you still fail time and time again.”

“You failed us.”

“Your whole family failed us.”

I ignored them.  I walked along the edge of the chamber, searching the wall for some kind of tunnel.  The air crackled as more cracks slid along the surface of the ice.  Miniscule fractures, only the width of a hair, but I did not like the direction this was heading.  The ice was the only thing holding a mound of angry corpses in check.

The frost wasn’t caused by the mass grave.  The frost was what was keeping it under control.

“Is it anger that keeps you here?” I asked.  “Do you stay because you want vengeance?”

“Yes.”

“Yes.”

“Yes.”

A chorus assaulted my ears.  A sound like slivers of glass striking the ground accompanied it.  A creak and I caught movement in the corner of my eye.  An arm was moving, stretching frozen fingers in my direction.

“I want to help,” I continued.  “Tell me what I can do.”

I’d made a full circle of the room.  There was no other exit.  I turned to face the tower of ice, struggling to remain calm.  I had to keep my wits.  It seemed the only way out was to keep talking.  As I watched, a shard of ice the size of my head slid free and shattered on the frozen earth.

“Stop the dying,” one sighed.  “If you can.”

“You can’t.”

“You can’t.”

“Our numbers will swell.”

“We are glut with the wrongfully dead.”

I ran my eyes along the height of the tower, gauging how much time was left.  The cracks were widening into chasms and more of the limbs that were already free of the ice were stretching frozen fingers, their muscles cracking like branches.  At the very top the tower spread out, merging into the soil above it.  There were dark lines all throughout it, stretching down towards the heart of the spire.  In some places near the top the ice was barely held together.

By… what?  If those were cracks, the ice should have tumbled free already.  I peered intently at it.

Roots.  Those were roots.  I shone my light on the ceiling.

A canopy of roots.

We were directly underneath a tree.  Its roots were growing into their bodies.

“I could… get rid of the tree, at least?” I suggested.

Silence.

“But to do that you’d need to let me out,” I continued.

“It would… make our wait more peaceful,” one said.

“We have no peace!” another shouted.

“Nor should they!”

“It hurts, though,” one near the top whined.

The voices fell to arguing.  I felt a moment of relief - at least they weren’t directing their anger at me still.  I edged closer to where a body was crumpled in the ice near the base, the spine bent over on itself like it had been folded in two.  An arm was protruding, twisted around with the wrist hanging limply.  I thought I’d heard a friendly voice from this direction.

“Should I leave the face behind?” I asked of it.

“That would be appropriate.  Put it with the rest of his body.”

A single finger pointed towards another spot in the ice.  I had to boost myself up onto the spire to reach it.  The cold burned my palms and knees as I half-stood, half-lay on its surface.  I stared down into the ice at a pile of red meat.  For a moment, I wasn't sure exactly what I was staring at.  Then I realized.

Organs.  Muscle.  No bones.  No skin.

I tried not to think about that very hard as I lay the face down on the ice, directly over the frozen mass of meat.  Probably a run-in with the harvesters.  Maybe they gave Beau the face like some sort of 18th century courting ritual where lovers exchanged handkerchiefs.

There you go.  You can ship that instead.

“How do I get out?” I asked of the one that had helped me.

“Up.  It is the only way.”

I stared up the spire in consternation.  Climb a pillar of ice, filled with angry corpses?  Sure.  Easy enough.  At least the cracks were now wide enough to provide footholds.  A silver lining to the fact the dead were breaking free of their prison to, I dunno, *kill me*.

I didn’t waste any time.  Rock climbing wasn’t really on the list of things I had to learn to be a campground manager, but there wasn’t any other choice.  I had to try my best, with all of my strength and resolve, or I wouldn’t make it out of there alive.  I grabbed hold of the first fissure.  The edge of the ice was sharp and it was far too painful for me to put my full weight on.

There wasn’t much time.  I hastily drew my knife and cut strips off my shorts and wound those around my hands.  The denim would hopefully be enough to blunt the ice’s edge.  And now I have a pair of short shorts for when I’m comfortable showing that much leg, which will probably be never.

Then I began the climb.  Fortunately, the spire narrowed as it went, which meant I wasn’t climbing a sheer surface.  I’ll be honest - I’m not sure I could have done it if it were vertical.  It’d be my brother writing this post to let you all know I wasn’t coming back.

Let’s not dwell on that too much.  I’ve had enough close calls lately that it’s a bit of an uncomfortable topic.

The dead confined in the ice snatched at me as I climbed.  I couldn’t avoid them all.  Fortunately, their limbs and bodies were still frozen inside the pillar and they had no leverage on me.  Their grasping hands were more of a minor hindrance.  It reminded me of the tunnel at the entrance, of being trapped in a narrow path forward as I had to follow the most promising handholds, with the brush of cold, stiff fingers against my exposed skin.

They yelled at me as I climbed past.  Some screamed curses.  They told me they hated me, they hated my family.  They told me how they died and wished their fate upon me as well.  Others told me to keep going.  To keep climbing.  Some offered their hands to help, giving me a foothold and a boost to the next crack that I could wedge a hand or a foot in.  They blamed me for their deaths just the same as the others, but they whispered that I had to keep going.  That I had to make this right.  They offered me redemption.

At the time I didn’t think much of it.  I was sweating and it felt like it was freezing on my skin, chilling me to the bone.  My muscles trembled with the effort.  All I could think of was where to place a foot or a hand next.

But now, sitting here writing this in the safety of my home?  They want me to redeem my family.  And if it can be done, then maybe they can all be put to rest for good.

At the top of the spire I ran out of places to hold onto.  The ice was too damaged.  Large chunks of it broke off when I touched them and I swayed dangerously in my perch, my heart hammering as I felt my body tipping backwards.  I wouldn’t survive the fall.  I had been careful to not look down, but I remembered how high it stretched.  I flailed, trying to grab hold of *anything* to stabilize myself - and then cold fingers wrapped around my wrist and held me fast.

I found myself staring at a woman.  Half of her skull was caved in.  It was a neat break, like something had punctured it and the rest of it collapsed from the lack of support.

“The lady in chains killed me,” she said.  “You killed her in turn, didn’t you?”

“I did.”

I didn’t really *want* to, but now wasn’t the time to point that out.  She was nearly free of the ice, but the roots from the tree above held her pinned in place instead.  They grew through her torso in thick cables.  Thinner roots dangled from the swell of her throat and trembled as she spoke.

“It’s a start, I suppose.  You need to keep going.”

At that moment I wasn’t certain if she was referring to purging the campground or climbing the spire.  Maybe it was both.  She stretched out her other hand and I put mine in it and she held onto me as I found better footing and then steadied my body as I stretched up my hands, past the ice, to grab hold of the thickest roots dangling from the ceiling above me.

And then she grabbed my legs and hoisted me up the rest of the way, far enough that I could put a hand through the thin soil separating me from the sky above, and I grabbed hold of the roots on the other side of the world and pulled my way free.

Sunlight blinded me.  I squeezed my eyes shut and clawed my way up by feel alone.  I hauled my body up and onto the roots of the tree and kicked my way free of the dirt.  When I could finally open my eyes again, after they painfully adjusted to the light, I saw that there was no sign of the mass grave.  Just the exposed roots at the base of one of our larger trees.  It’d been ailing for some time and I’d been considering removing it.

Well, now the decision was made for me.  It had to go.  It wasn’t doing well because it was literally trying to feed off a very angry mass grave.

“The frost is calming back down,” a voice said from nearby.  “Were you successful?”

I glanced over to see the shepherd standing nearby, the cypress branch held loosely in his hand.

“I think I can appease them a little,” I said tentatively.  “Is that… enough?”

“For me to fulfill my duty?  No.”

He glanced away.  I sat up, brushing dirt off my shirt.

“But I will have to be content with it,” he sighed.  “I’ve waited long enough.  I can wait a bit longer.”

“How long?”

Generations, he said.  For as long as the land has been old.  He arose as the need demanded.  He had no affiliation to anything I was familiar with, as my family swore to no power.  A neutral, unique, guide for the dead and nothing more.  Something to remove those unhappy souls from my land and that he had done, for the ones that were willing to go.  There weren’t many of those.  Not many at all.

So he stayed.  Trapped here, not by the old land, but by his obligation.

He told me all of this in a calm, quiet tone.  He didn’t seem to mind answering my questions and I asked him about this, as it’s been so different from the other creatures I’ve encountered.  He gave me a soft smile.

“I exist for the comfort of the mortals that are doomed to die,” he said.  “Talking to your kind doesn’t harm me like it does others.”

“You seemed… angry.  Before.”

“I *am* angry.”

His expression hardened.

“Look what your family has done to them.  To me.  I feel the weight of my undone task.  It has grown heavy indeed over the decades.”

I asked him if he would be the ancient thing to rule over this land.  I’d do what I could to make that happen.  I couldn’t think of anyone more suitable for the task.

He refused.

He had his duty already, he said, and he would be loath to leave it behind.  Securing the future of my campground was *my* duty.  He would watch over the dead until then and keep them quiet, once the tree was removed, and maybe someday they would be satisfied and allow him to escort them on.

“They want me to redeem my family,” I said quietly.

“Is that what you want?” he asked mildly.

I think it is.  We’ve… done some awful things.  I’ve done some awful things.  Oh, we had our reasons and all, and maybe those reasons feel justified, but it doesn’t erase the sin.  It doesn’t bring comfort to the ones that died.

“When did you change?” the shepherd asked thoughtfully, tilting his head as he looked at me.

I thought about it.  Was it when I started making these posts?  When I saw my campground - and my family - through the eyes of outsiders?  I couldn’t say for certain.

“Maybe,” he suggested softly, “you didn’t change.”

I’m a campground manager.  The shepherd’s words keep running through my head.  Maybe I’ve always been like this.  I feel like there is too much of my mother in me, that there’s too much anger and hate and the well is poisoned beyond salvaging.  But I was also raised by my father.  Perhaps I am more like him than I thought.  Perhaps I’ve yearned for things to be different, to be *better*, in the secret parts of my heart where I dared not acknowledge them, because there is nothing in this life more painful than an earnest hope being pulled apart.

I couldn’t help the dead.  I can ease their wait (and I’ve already scheduled a crew to come out and remove the tree) but I cannot give them the justice they crave.  It is a hard thing to accept.

I’m not sure if I’ll ever be able to help them.  Can a family like mine be redeemed?  Is a single person up to such a monumental task?

I can’t say for certain.  But I guess if I ever want to make this right,  [I have to find a way](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/ofb0b1/how_to_survive_camping_my_niece_is_still_the_worst/).[\[x\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/goatvalleycampgrounds/)
