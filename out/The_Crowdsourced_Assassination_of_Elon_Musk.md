*The following is a message I received from what appeared to be a Discord bot belonging to no server that I know of.*

Once upon a time, I was invited to a Discord server. You might have invited me, or I might have invited you, but we were both there.

The Server was an augmented reality game, or maybe people hoping it would turn into an ARG, or maybe it was a Q-Anon like conspiracy cult in its foundational state, but it had a weird energy to it, and you and I – purportedly just like everyone else – were there mostly just to be there at the beginning of it and see what happened to it.

The server had a strange name – a random 32-character string that was quickly identified as a UUID – but everyone called it AEM. About Elon Musk. Anti-Elon Musk. Against Elon Musk. It must have been one of those things. Maybe. Whatever it was, the topic was Elon Musk, and it was popular. Remember that guy who would tweet out the location of Musk’s plane? Yeah, it was that, except every aspect of Musk’s life – where he was or had been at any given moment, photos and live streams of him, interactions with him. People would post their past experiences with him, but it got to the point that server members were going out of their way to get new experiences. They’d go to his posted events, but they’d go to his houses, too, his businesses, camp outside to post about any glimpses of him. It was considered ‘doing god’s work’ to camp out in places he might be, but wasn’t confirmed. They called it bottlenecking. In the beginning it was only a single server straining at Discord’s capacity when we joined, but in just a couple weeks it was ten separate servers, each full, with stay-at-homes making a full-time commitment of sharing information between the nodes.

There were a few rules everyone quickly understood: Don’t post in general, at least not at first. Don’t change your Display Name. Do either of those things, and your account would be removed within 24 hours. People that made a game of that tended not to come back, and there were stories that they were doxxed and harassed. If you followed the rules, if you participated well, your Display Name would be changed for you to a different UUID, and you were then invited, expected, to post in general. Every now and again, a different account would be modded, post in all caps, and then be de-modded. That was the word of god. That was what we waited for. Those posts were photos of Musk from what – for a celebrity – must have been a very vulnerable position. They were inside his home. They were in his businesses, at his C-suite meetings. They were over his shoulder as he logged into a machine. They were from the devices of his colleagues. They were from his own device, looking up his nose as he doomscrolled at 2am. Sometimes they were clips of video. Most of the time, they were very recent.

It would have been an annoying flash in the pan if Musk himself wasn’t obsessed with it. He called it harassment, and it was. He sued the server, which he said was sending him death threats, but nobody could find the owner. He sued Discord, then threatened to buy it, which was generally joked to be the more dangerous option.  The server was shut down, obviously, but everyone with a UUID Display Name was invited to a new one, and they came with friends.  The servers were shut down again, and they just came back stronger, more numerous. AEM was Legion. Musk fumbled at various responses – joining the server himself, railing at it, posting his locations and photos, inviting ‘god’ to an interview. He tweeted about it endlessly, often in the middle of interviews when it could be proved he was the one tweeting… because sometimes it wasn’t. Or so he said. Sometimes there would be news clips of him, red-faced and ranting that he ‘hadn’t typed that!’

It must have broken him at some point, because he went from being in the public eye 22 hours a day to being a recluse. He went anonymous, a submarine that only broke the surface to post unhinged tweets. New experiences with Musk began to dwindle, but not from the god account. Its post showed a Musk even more frantically Musk – tweeting from hundreds of accounts, moving resources around between his companies, desperately pulling at the strings of government, public opinion, and technology.

We all knew that the servers were crowded with reporters, with law enforcement, with intelligence operations. Officially, they were welcomed, as long as they followed the rules. It became a topic of some discussion that even the CIA was rumored to have those rules enforced, that there had been repercussions. Those ‘rumors’ – written right out in general and supported by screencaps – became their own newsworthy topic.

The god account was asked what it wanted, and its answer was ‘Change’. What a powerful word – the rallying cry of Obama, Trump, Musk himself. It had a new herald.  The god account wanted the change Musk had promised, but not delivered. It wanted change from people like Musk, but also acknowledged he would prefer not to waste him.** I would prefer if the change came from Musk himself, whether or not it was volitional.**  Musk, it said, would be more useful alive than as a martyr, but that idea was out there – the account that had seemingly unlimited access to Musk had posited killing him.  That, Newsweek reported, was its most-likely endgame. Musk himself tweeted for almost twenty-six hours non-stop that it was true, although he claimed later that several of those posts weren’t from him, even if they all originated from his phone or tablet.

The account began organizing flash mobs – usually several at a time around the world – and once it was realized that one of them usually flushed an anonymous Musk out, they were well-attended. You and I posted about going to a few of them. I brushed by someone I didn’t realize was Musk until seconds later. You were at the one where he said he was injected.

There were five leading theories about who was behind all this, who ‘god’ was. The first, the obvious one, was that it was Musk himself. Musk put that theory forward from his own account, but it was considered a desperate attempt to puncture the movement. The second was that it was a spurned employee, maybe one with an intelligence or special ops background who had nothing better to do than grind his ax on the man himself. Surprisingly, the possibility that it was a group of *people* – maybe a reincarnation of Anonymous – was largely dismissed by those in the know, but that didn’t stop it from bubbling up to the surface frequently. The other two theories interested me the most, because they were the most science fictional, and yet somehow plausible in this case: ‘god’ was an AI. That begged a lot of the theorist, but it explained a lot, too. Personally, though, I preferred the fifth, a wrinkle on the fourth: It was an AI, but one that didn’t run primarily on silicon and circuitry. It was the next modulus of the religion, the meme: it was an AI that ran on people, an intelligence emergent from neurons comprised of the likes of you and me who didn’t themselves know how their actions contributed, or really even know that they were a part of that whole.

After about a year of this, the news had largely moved on, as it did with wars, with scandals, with anything the viewers were bored with. Participation in the servers was waning, but still significant. Posts by god were regular, but predictable: pictures, location updates, flash mob directives. Until that one penultimate post:** It is done.**

Musk, after, did not tweet. He didn’t give a flush-faced interview to FOX. He wrote a letter to the editor of the New York times announcing that he had prevailed, that he’d outlasted this self-styled ‘god’ and that we’d find out the whole truth soon enough, but he was looking forward to finally getting back to work. Work, he did, but there was a change. Work didn’t include tweeting, and it didn’t seem to include caring about public opinion any more. Tesla thrived, split into several companies. SpaceX announced a fixed schedule for its Mars mission. Most of Musk’s public appearances in the following years involved a competition with Gates to be the man who gave away the most to charity in his own lifetime.

God’s last post came out of the blue, in one of the servers where the people who still played the AEM game still met. UUIDs weren’t being distributed as Display Names anymore; there was a mod team who openly admitted to doing so.  People called it a cargo cult. People begged god to do Bezos next. People tried to organize more flash mobs; people posted their interactions with Musk, but the fun had gone out of those since he now accepted them with grace, and turned them into charitable events. It was in response to one of those flash mob suggestions that god finally posted: **Don’t poke Musk too hard, or all the spiders will come out.**
