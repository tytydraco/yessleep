I am not some kind of scientist, physicist, or mathematician. I'm just a normal, ordinary person, who likes video games, watching movies, and overthinking things.

But, this morning when I was taking a shower, suddenly the way to turn back in time came to my mind. Of course, it is a theory that I have gone over and over in my head throughout the day.

What would happen if something went wrong? Would it affect the timeline of things? What if I don't remember anyone? Questions like these have been running through my head all this time, but, I really have nothing to lose. I don't have children, my partner just broke up with me, and I quit my job, I mean, I don't have any responsibilities that bind me to this timeline and stop me for execute this little experiment.

Of course, I have several options designed for the time to which I would like to return. It could be at the beginning of university, where I had my first love and had the whole future of the world at my fingertips by studying engineering, as my mother dreamed. It's a good idea since it would be before I made the excellent decision to drop out and thereby become the stinky lazy loser that I am.

Or maybe go back to high school where I can get revenge on the people who bothered me and also be at the premiere of incredible sagas like "The Lord of the Rings" on the big screen again. My favorite movies. And play with my old video game console, but I think it would be the newest console at that time, right? Celebrating the best Christmas once again with my whole family would be one of the best things that I would like to repeat, to be honest.  And have another chance to tell my grandparents that I love them. I really miss them. I guess they'd be disappointed if they saw me now.

However, I think the best option is to go back to my childhood, at that time everything was easier because I received the things I wanted, I watched cartoons all day and I had no responsibilities like paying debts, looking for a job and I was never depressed. Those were good times, I would like to return there. It would be the best.

I can have the opportunity to make my life one more time. Wow! I don't understand why I hadnâ€™t thought of that before. I guess it's because I hit my lowest point and at this moment, my brain found a solution.

With this post, I hope to confirm or throw away my theory. If I'm still here tomorrow it was because I failed and I'll keep you posted on what happened to me, and if I don't show up again it's because I figured out a way to go back in time.

And to do it, I just need some blood from my wrists and sleep until the next morning.

Good night everybody.
