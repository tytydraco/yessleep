I have not told anyone about the beach or the submarine in the intervening years. But I am an old man now and can count my time left in months rather than years, I would like this on the record. At any rate, everybody else involved is long gone.

My first job was the junior deputy up in a small place north of Eureka. I was young, too young for peacetime but with every able-bodied man overseas, I suppose now, they were desperate. It was an easy sort of job. The tourist agencies have opened that whole coastline up these days but back then, most of our flock made a living on the fishing trawlers. The big lumber camps were south and east of us, and we never had to deal with the trouble that comes with them. Until the night in question, it was good.

I was ambitious back then, and, with the War near its end, I thought I would put in for a city role in Santa Rosa or Sacramento when it was done. I worked under a peace officer called Jefferson, a stout old timer who ran a good political machine in his district and was as safe as any elected official in the state. I would be sad to leave him and he would be sad to see me go, although neither of us would have admitted that at the time. And there was no chance to after it all.

The night I want to tell you about, we got hit with a storm, still the worst I’ve ever seen. One of those biblical occurrences that the old fishermen talk about thirty years later. It’s near enough 80 years since that night now and here I am still talking about it myself. We used to be able to see the cliffs from the station and I remember watching the waves coming up high as castle towers and shattering across the rocks.

I hoped we’d have a night without calls, not uncommon in a place like that. Any experienced cop will tell you that a hope like that is the best way to guarantee you’ll be called out. Sure enough, a little after midnight it came through. A supply truck running food up along the old coast road had seen something big washed up in one of the coves. He couldn’t make much out but reckoned it might be a ship beached ashore by the storm swell. Jefferson thought there could be some hauling to do and dragged me out with him.

We found the cove the trucker had mentioned. I think the locals used to call it Crying Bay, supposedly where the cavalry drove the local tribe into the sea on account of the Gold Rush. It was sheer cliff-face on three sides and sea on the fourth so that no one could get to the beach without climbing down or swimming in. Sure enough, we could make something out on the shoreline. Big and metallic, stretching the breadth of the cove.

“Is it a boat?” I asked.

“Maybe. Hard to see on a night like this,” Jefferson replied.

“We could try throwing a road flare down?”

“Best hope it’s not an oil tanker if we do. Go fetch one from the truck.”

The flare burst into burning red life. I hurled it down into the cove and watched it twirl to the ground like a sycamore seed. We peered over and that is when we saw what we were dealing with.

A submarine, exposed in the red light of the flare. A vast black sea serpent as long as a city block. There was the jutting conning tower and the pointed snout with the torpedo tubes visible. Emblazoned on the side was the rising sun ensign of Imperial Japan. The enemy. I gazed at it with ill-disguised excitement. Only Jefferson’s shuddering breath tempered my thrill. Jefferson scrambled to his feet and snatched up the radio receiver in the truck. It responded with garbled static. No matter how much he twisted the dial, he received no response.

“Shit,” he said as the rain began a new onslaught. He looked back at me. “We should go back, wait for the cavalry.”

“Should,” I replied.

Jefferson grinned at that. I could see him weighing it up. He pulled his shotgun from the back of the truck.

“You’ll be the death of me. Pull it up to the cliff edge. We’ll use the tow line to climb down,” he ordered.

We dragged the tow line out until it was spent and hurled it down. We worked our way slowly down the cliff face, desperately clinging onto any handhold we could find, hoping the line would hold us.  Finally we reached the bottom. The beach in the cove was rocky. We staggered like drunks across it until we reached the submarine. Up close it was even larger, towering over us and swallowing us in its shadow.

Jefferson readied his shotgun in one hand. He hammered on the steel hull with his other. It echoed like a broken church bell.

“You are shipwrecked on American soil!” He shouted over the wind and the rain. “Come out now, unarmed, and we will guarantee your good treatment!”

Silence was the only response. No sound. No movement.

“You know any Japanese?”

I shook my head.

“Pity,” he replied.

He nodded to me. I clambered up the ladder on the side and soon found the hatch near the nose of the submarine. It took both of us turning the wheel to get it loose. The hatch popped open with a crack. I shone my flashlight in. The beam caught the firing room. Empty torpedo racks. No sign of armament at all.

“What type of submarine doesn’t carry torpedoes?” I asked. Jefferson grunted and swept his own flashlight down the submarine as far as it would penetrate. Beyond the cone of light was void-blackness. We exchanged a glance. Jefferson nodded and I took my first step down the ladder. He covered me with his shotgun, gripped tightly. The steel steps creaked and swayed. I reached the bottom and stepped down into the darkness. I landed in water up to my thighs. It was stagnant, leaked diesel floating in shimmering snake-patterns on the surface of the water.

“Flooded!” I shouted back up. Jefferson began his unsteady climb down.

“Christ it reeks,” he said, as he dropped into the water behind me. “Probably the bilge pumps overflowed too. All the submariners are volunteers. Got to be a strange sort to sign up for this.”

He cast the beam of his flashlight back and forth down the narrow submarine corridor. There was no movement and no sound save for the steady drip drip drip of water falling onto metal.

We advanced down the corridor. Ten paces in and the hatch we had entered through was already out of sight. I forced myself to focus only on that which my flashlight could illuminate.

Up ahead was another ladder. It must have led up to the bulbous head in front of the conning tower I’d seen from the outside. I gestured to it. Jefferson nodded and positioned himself to cover the ladder with his shotgun. I began to climb. I could make out a long shaft running above the main submarine corridor. I pulled myself up the final step and peered into the shaft entrance.

A Japanese face stared back at me in the light. My grip on the rung slipped. Only Jefferson on the ladder beneath me stopped me plummeting down into the water and probably breaking my neck. The face was dead. More than dead. Around the cavity where his nose should have been was necrotic black flesh. He was laid prone in the narrow shaft. His right forearm was gone too. The flesh had decayed so much that the bone beneath jutted out. I gingerly pulled myself up into the shaft, desperately avoiding so much as brushing the awful corpse. Jefferson came up behind me.

“Poor bastard,” he said, and crossed himself out of habit rather than faith. He shone his flashlight down the shaft. All along it was a gear mechanism that would allow the whole shaft to be raised. At the other end of the shaft I saw why. Crammed in tightly and bound with Indian rubber straps was the slim steel shape of a torpedo bomber. Wings removed and stored alongside it.

“Good god,” I said.

“I’d heard stories. Planes launched off submarines, bombers over Los Angeles in twenty five seconds.” Jefferson shook his head.

Hanging from beneath the plane’s belly where the bombs should be were two porcelain caskets the size of beer kegs. A third was shattered across the floor of the shaft. I approached it slowly. It was split in half. My flashlight came to rest on one half. It was moving. I stared closer and realised with horror that the shell was swarming with fleas. Thousands. Millions. Moving like a scuttling wave. I stifled a gasp. At the sound, the fleas seemed to sense my presence. They surged in unison towards me. Now I did scream, screamed like a child.

Jefferson pushed me aside and aimed his shotgun. Without hesitation he fired. Again and again until the fleas were pulverised by the buckshot. We both stood panting. I went to speak but Jefferson shook his head, patted me on the back and gestured back down the ladder.

We dropped back down in the foul water and continued our journey down the main submarine corridor. I could not shake the feeling of being bitten all over, as if those fleas had swarmed every inch of my body. Ahead was a low doorway leading into the crew’s sleeping berth. I covered my mouth at the stench. Bunkbeds on either side. At least twenty. Every bed was filled with a mouldering corpse in the same state of rapid necrosis as the body in the plane shaft. Jefferson carefully swept his shotgun across each body. But there was no movement. No life.

It got worse the deeper into the submarine we prowled. By the time we reached the galley, the water was thick with corpses. Most floating face down in the water. We gingerly waded through, covering our mouths as best we could. It smelt like a whaling station.

Beyond the galley was the captain's cabin. The only private sanctum in the whole stinking iron tube. It was in disarray. Charts strewn across the desk. Logbooks floating in the water. The captain, identifiable from his full dress uniform was there too. Dead as the rest of his crew, legs dangling from his chair, black with necrosis. Scrawled across the wall, in blood or paint I did not know, were two Japanese characters. Their strange artistry amidst all this horror still unnerves me more than the memory of the bodies. On the desk were aerial maps of cities along the coast. Los Angeles. San Francisco. San Diego. Concentric rings marked over them. Targets and the impact radius I realise now.

“If it wasn’t for the storm…” I muttered.

“Yes,” Jefferson replied. He gripped my shoulder in reassurance.

I caught the movement out of the corner of my eye, coming through the service hatch. The short-bladed sword hacked through Jefferson’s head beneath the nose. Gripping it was a crooked figure in a gas mask and rubber suit. From his uniform, I guessed him to be the ship’s engineer.

I fumbled with the catch on my holster. My hands shook manically. The engineer yanked the sword free of Jefferson's head and his corpse flopped, horribly limp, to the ground. I got my revolver free and opened fire. I put the whole cylinder in him, saw the six holes where the bullets punctured his suit, saw the blood bloom like flowers around them. But still he advanced on me.

I ran then. To my shame, I ran like a coward, like a child, tramping through the water as fast as my legs would carry me. For a horrible moment I lost my footing. I almost plummeted face first into the stagnant water. But I gripped desperately to a bunk bed and kept upright. The engineer stalked behind me. I could hear his ragged breath through the mask. I kept on running, blind in the darkness. I crashed past the ladder to the plane shaft. Still the engineer followed behind, his pace even as mine was manic. There! Ahead, a shaft of moonlight from the open hatch. I hurled myself up the ladder, clawed my way out into the cold night air. I took a great gulp to clear my throat and nostrils and slid down the side of the submarine. I landed in a heap on the rocky beach and dragged myself to my feet.

I set off in a mad half-stumble, half-run across the beach towards the dangling tow rope. I could hear the clang of the engineer’s footsteps coming up the ladder towards the hatch. Close now. I drove myself on, feet slipping across the loose rocks.

At last, I reached the cliff-face. I allowed myself a look back. The engineer was on the beach himself, never relenting in his pace, seeming to not notice the rocks underfoot. I seized the tow rope and began to scale the cliff. My sweat-drenched hands slipped and slid on the rope. Twice I nearly lost my grip altogether and would have plummeted to my death had I not levered my feet against the wall of the cliff face.

I dragged myself up onto the top of the cliff.  No time to catch my breath. I glanced back. The engineer was already crawling up the rope like a rat. I desperately cast about for a weapon. Nothing presented itself. I tried to release the tow line from the truck but it held firm. I howled into the swirling storm. *Must cut the rope.*

I hefted up a jagged rock from the cliff edge and begin to hammer down into the tow line at the edge of the cliff. The impact barely made a mark on the rope. I peered over the edge. The engineer was clambering up with a speed that terrified me, already half-way up the cliff. I struck again at the rope. The sharp edge made a tiny nick in the rope. I stifled the urge to drop the rock and run. I could hear the engineer’s breathing, even over the storm, filtered and distorted by the gas mask. I hit the tow line again, the rope frayed, a fat strand severed. Still the engineer came. He was so close I could see the glinting glass lenses of his gas mask. I frantically hacked at the line. Achingly slow, the individual strands split, one-by-one. The engineer clawed out to me with one gloved hand. His fingertips grazed my knee. I slammed the rock down into the tow line. The last strand gave way and the whole rope split in half. The engineer fell, plummeting through the void. His body was shattered against the rocks.

I sat getting my breath back at the top of the cliff, weeping with the horror of it all. It took me an hour of that to decide my course of action. I gathered the remaining road flares from the back of the truck and a can of gas. I walked the long way round and waded into the beach from the far side, I could not risk the cliff again after seeing the engineer fall as he had.

I doused the submarine in gasoline as best I could. With the flares and the diesel leaking from its engines, the whole thing went up like a bonfire. I hoped to God that the flames would purge whatever had happened inside. I stayed watching from the cliffside until high tide swallowed the beach and dragged the burning submarine back into its depths.

It was easy for everyone to believe that Jefferson had been taken by the sea. It was only half a lie. His funeral was well attended. The Governor came up from Sacramento for it. The casket was empty.

The ambition left me after that. I moved inland, far from submarines, took a job with the postal service up in a town near Missoula. Most nights I can sleep through, but, now and then, I am beset with images of corpses without noses and engineers in gas masks. I wake in the morning feeling as if my whole body is on fire, a thousand flea bites.
