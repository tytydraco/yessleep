Each day, I work until six o'clock. When the day ends, I take a 10 minutes bus ride at home. I know it isn't a lot but it's better than to walk in a violent neighborhood. 

Everyday, the ride goes nornally, but today, that wasn't the case. It was 7h08, we were two minutes near my house, when we stopped at the bus stop on the intersection of Kings Lane and Newcastle Road. 

The bus driver got off the bus, probably because it was the end of his shift, and a new one came on. I never saw the driver before. He had long black hair, long black beard which both of them hided the entierly of his traits. He put sunglasses on even if it was nearly dark outside. He also rearranged his beard in an unnatural manner like if it was a fake beard. 

Now here's the strange thing. I looked out on my right and saw at the bus station a man sleeping in it without a shirt on. At first glance, I thought he was a bum but I recognized him. I knew who he was, he is a bus driver whom I arleady saw  and talked. So what the heck was he doing out there, sleeping? He also had a coffee cup in his hand spilled on the grass. 

This thing really disturbed me. I thought maybe he had a medical condition or that he got robbed. I wanted to help, but I was too tired to do anything and we already took off. 
In the bus, we were only 6. The driver, of course, me, two teen girls, a shady guy and a old man reading a book. 

Things started to take a left turn ; literally. He took a different path from usual and that's what put a trigger in the passenger's heads. The shady guy started to utter:

— Hey, where the fuck are you taking us?

The driver didn't respond. The man got up, but the driver pressed on the gas pedal and sended in the air the guy at the back of the bus. 

I was looking at the guy but I should have looked at the front. The bus strucked three people, there was blood on the windshield  and the bus passed over the bodies like if it was a speedbump. 

We kept racing, I saw the three bodies lying down in the middle of the road barely moving. It was a mother and her two children. 

Every passegers just scream and was terrorized, it was utter chaos. Like the old man, I just standed still, paralysed by fear. 

I thought the goal of the driver was just to kill the most people he can find but I saw he was looking for somewhere. 

I took my phone to call 911, and then I realised the date. It was July 4th. I knew that a parade was being organised near the midtown and a lot of people were going to be present. 

We were six minutes away from the road where the parade was going to be. I told the two girls to call 911, but I knew that to prevent more victims I had to do something more than to call the police. 

The shady guy was rolled up in a seat like a little girl. Even the two teens were more courageous than him. I saw he had a small knife, like a canif. I told him in a scared voice“ give me the knife please “ and he gave it, just like that. I thought it would be harder to get knife. 

Since the first victims, around two more people got hit. They ended better that the mom and her kids but they were still hurt. 

I got up, the bus moved left to right and so was I. I got near the driver but he saw me. I didn't know he had a gun but he took a shot at me but missed barely. For a reason, I just decided to risk it all and just jumped with the knife directly in his throat. 

The driver put his left hand on his neck while his right struggled to drive the bus. We made zig-zags before tipping over at high speed.

I woke up in an hospital room. Confused about what happened. I didn't remebered a lot but I remebered approximately what happened: the driver, us 5, me stabbing the guy.  

I waited ten minutes, in those ten minutes, I saw the news about the incident. Two people died, with three in critical conditions. It could have been more if I wasn't there, I said to myself. I saw that the driver was also death which kinda boosted my morale a bit. 

The doctors came and saw I woke up. They told me I was in a sort of coma for a day. Then, my beautiful family came to see me. And finally, the police came to question me.

They were three of them. The one in the middle had a long dark moustache and thin lips. The one on his left was much younger than him and had blond hair. The other on his right had a buzz cut and a fresh shaven beard. He also had a hefty scar on the right side of his neck.  

The asked me to summarize everything I remembered from that evening and that's what I did. I told them the part when he switched with the other driver and the man who was sleeping on the bus stop (turns out he was drugged by the “terrorist”). I told how it went, when I stabbed the driver and when we crashed. 

They thanked me for answering and went on their way. Before they went, I asked them if all the passengers survived and they told me that, yes, all six of us survived. I was relieved to hear that. 

But then, I realised something . If the "driver" died, how could we have been six passengers in the bus that survived?
