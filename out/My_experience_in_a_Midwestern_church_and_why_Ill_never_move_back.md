It's best not to give too many details. Most of the people in this story are still in my (F23) life. My family was always heavily embedded in the church. My great grandfather was the pastor, his wife the pianist. Together they lead a group of over 20 families from the area. The rest of my family found active roles within the community. I don't remember when the building was finished but I know they helped lay the boards themselves. The church was way out in the middle of nowhere, on the county line, but they had a neighbor who prevented them from expanding their property. I'm not sure if he always lived there, but by the time they realized they wanted to expand, he was in their way. No one was happy about it. 

He was nasty from what I heard, and rarely left his little shack. He would leave trash and other gross items on his property, and occasionally barge in on a service. The cops couldn't do anything and he refused to move. I remember my grandmother and my father arguing one night around Easter about what to do with the situation. I couldn't make much of it out clearly, but I heard my father shout  "That's not how God works, mom!" I didn't realize until much later what had happened. The neighbor had taken his life and left a vague message for the congregation on the front door, like a true Protestant.  

I didn't know what he wrote, and I guess it didn't matter too much, as it didn't have anything to do with the church from what I could gather. It was clear that most of the members of the church felt this was Gods way of working for them, but it doesn't sit right with me. It's like praying for the accuracy of bombs in foriegn countries. It's easy to convince yourself that everything is Gods will when it works out in your favor.

The building never expanded. My great grandfather, great grandmother, and grandfather all died within a few years. They found a new pastor, but he died during knee surgery, so they found a different pastor. Then he started making the homeless convert before they could receive snack-packs, and things really started going downhill. 

Anyways. A few years back, I was about 20, I had started leading the youth groups and helped out more with the banquets. We'd just resumed normal services after Covid, and I think they all hated me a little more. It took a long time for me to reconnect with the church after my transition, especially without the support of my great grandmother. I was happy to finally be included in my family again, even if it meant being at the perifery of the congregation, but I could feel their eyes on me. All. The. Time. 

My grandmother took a long time to understand, but I think I finally reached her by quoting some Matthew.
The Easter egg-hunt was coming up and a few of us were in the kitchen prepping for the weekend. I was a little nervous to be around so many of the "elders" at once. They can be underhanded and mean without even realizing it. It's baked in to them at this point, they'll always look at me like I'm Cain and the old me was Abel. It was a good evening though. No micro-aggressions, no "girlfriend" talk. None of that stuff that makes you feel like your existence is wrong. I think someone had a talk with them behind my back, which isn't the worst feeling in the world, but it still makes me anxious. 

The building was old old, and each room smelled a different, unique kind of musty. The baptismal tub no longer functioned, and the roof had started to develop what would eventually be it's fatal wet-spot. I stepped away from the kitchen crew for just a few minutes to go grab something, maybe egg dye, from the back rooms. They each connected laterally behind the main hall, but the doors were all locked so it was effectively one long storage closet with multiple layers. I had worked my way nearly to the back, where the holiday items are kept, when I felt a gust of wind whirl past me. I was stunned. There's no cross breeze back there, and without any of the doors open it shouldn't be anything but the stuffy smell of decades old plastic. I gazed down the doorways and saw the door furthest from me, the exit, closing. Not a slam like you would expect from the movies, the quietest click you've ever heard. Like a diver leaving only a ripple in their wake. And then the next door started to close.

Before I could even free my legs from the mounds of cardboard, I was sealed in. I clambored over to the door, intent on ripping the plyboard off it's hinges. That's when it... they grabbed me. At first I thought I'd snagged my top on the unhoused lightswitch, but then I noticed the walls themselves. The woodgrain began to separate itself from the boards beneath, reaching for me. Before I could react I felt the clasp of several hands all over my limbs, the sound of creaking filled the room. They didn't feel clammy, or warm for that matter, no temperature, no moisture, just pressure, like being restrained by an iron maiden. The hands kept multiplying, encasing me, covering my eyes and mouth. And then it spoke in rattled clauses: 

"Young one, why have you shorn your antlers?" 

They lifted my arms and I felt it smell me, inspect me like a specimen. I couldn't speak. I tried. I've never had anything so blatantly stomp my faith so quickly. It muttered something in a language that I won't even try to relay, but I could almost swear it was speaking in tongues, just like my great grandfather would. A lot of "shush" and "hala" sounds, almost like it was comforting me. I couldn't tell if it was one being, or multiple, but they functioned in perfect unison. 

"The trees do not hear your prayers."

I've tried so hard to figure out what that means these past few years. It never stops echoing in my brain, and maybe that's the point. All at once, I was released, and the doors were open. I fell, hard, dropped from a few feet. The room had returned to normal. The whole encounter lasted only about thirty seconds. I didn't go back to the kitchen, I walked right past them, got in my car, and went home. I never told my family what happened. I think they just assumed I was uncomfortable with the church environment, which is an easy out for me. About a year after I moved away the church was condemned. Nothing stands on that property now but the little shack that never got torn down.

 I recently visited for Christmas and a conversation came up about the old neighbor and his antics. I guess he had a few *realistic* mannequins in his yard and would leave used condoms in the lot. Details I didn't retain from my childhood. I'd never been told the message he left, understandably, but suffice to say the darker side of me was disappointed. It wasn't some morbid indictment, it was just some broken, senseless statement:

"But I will be in the leaves."
