[The second session felt longer](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/12SmYKyeYA)
Then the third session. Maybe longer. Time was strange there. He barely spoke just the same word: “Breathe.” His gaze slid past me, like he was studying a point behind my head.

I leaned back, fabric firm, the headrest holding my skull. The hum returned, closer this time, like machinery in the wall. The taste of metal crept onto my tongue. I thought about water. Then nothing.

When I opened my eyes the lamp flickered faintly, as if caught from the corner of sight. He was writing on the clipboard. I cleared my throat softly. He didn’t flinch.
“What’s the last thing you remember?” he asked.
“Nothing,” I said. “Maybe the hum.”
“Good.” He made a mark, his tone as neutral as a form.

At home my bed was neatly made. I never make it like that. The duvet folded with hotel precision, pillow creased like someone had sat there a moment before standing. I touched the hollow. Warm. I told myself I imagined it. I lay on top of the covers, not under, because someone else already had.

The days after, I wore headphones with no music. Just to pretend silence was mine. I lined up glasses in the same spot on the counter. I checked the door twice. The third time I forced myself not to check. That third time I felt watched.

The stairwell sounded wrong. Old buildings let neighbors bleed into your walls. Voices and footsteps that seem one door away. Sometimes I wondered if there was a room I’d forgotten.

At work my monitor tilted slightly downward. I always tilt it back to hide the reflection. Someone must have moved it. A coworker paused in my doorway, ran a finger along the frame, and left. I drafted him an email, deleted it before sending. Most of my emails vanish that way.

That night I left my phone in the living room, used my old clock with its soft tick. After a few minutes the ticking becomes all you hear. Then it skipped once. Out of rhythm. I sat up like someone had called me. Hallway empty. Only my own blood rushing in my ears.

The fourth appointment, a headache circled my forehead. The woman in the hall nodded. Her ponytail was lower, a stray hair stuck to her neck like a comma. He said nothing but “Breathe.” I realized I was digging my nails into the chair. My tongue felt heavy. Somewhere inside, a light went out.

When I came back, I was on my couch. I didn’t know how I got there. A half full glass of water sat on the table, a fingerprint near the rim. Not mine. 
I stared until the daylight shifted.

Morning: phone vibrating, missed calls. “Where are you?” “Are you canceling?” “Call me.” I didn’t reply. I could have written: I slept. True, but not an explanation.

One morning I woke unusually light and went to the café early. The barista wore a ponytail like the hallway woman. 
A perfect circle of milk stained her shirt. She slid me the cup, eyes catching mine. Her lips moved faintly: 
“Almost time.”
“Sorry?” I asked.
She smiled like it was a joke. 
“Have a nice day.”

That night I met coworkers in a crowded bar. I mentioned the therapy.
“Does it help?” one asked.
“I don’t know. I sleep sometimes.”
He spun his glass in a circle, condensation tracing the wood. 
“Don’t overthink it. In the end everything ends at three.”

He laughed, surprised by his own words. “Where did that come from?”
I shrugged. My stomach tightened.

The days after were clean. That’s the word. Smooth. Wake, work, pasta over the sink, tidy chairs. Sleep came often enough to feel possible again. 
I even answered “Okay” when people asked how I was, and it didn’t sound completely hollow.

But then something shifted. Quietly, like the floor sliding beneath me a centimeter at a time.

Keys in the fridge, cold on the egg carton. “Happens,” I muttered. The mirror in the bathroom tilted half a degree. I straightened it. Later it tilted again. Small things, but the mind grabs what it can.

I touched objects just to know they were real the doorknob, the faucet, the table edge. Neighbors laughed through the wall. It calmed me, knowing someone else was still happy.

The next session felt rehearsed. The buzzer, the woman’s nod, the chair. “Breathe,” he said, nothing more. The hum was deeper, less like a device, more like a building’s hidden heart. 
I thought about the scratch on my table, the way my thumb always finds it. 

Then I woke on my couch. Again. The same half full glass of water. The same print near the rim. The stove clock read 11:08 p.m. My phone blinked with missed calls. Voices on voicemail said my name. “Call me.” “You okay?” 
I hung up before they finished.

Morning came with strange calm. Not relief more like resignation. I moved on routine, lights green at every crossing, coworkers nodding, monitor angled differently. I fixed it without thinking, then caught my reflection in another screen. My mouth a straight line I didn’t recognize.

That night I tried to sleep early. Door cracked, phone in the living room, alarm set. My breathing too loud. The hallway creaked. Nothing unusual, but my body tensed. His voice came back uninvited: Everything ends at three. Not loud. Just there. I turned onto my side and finally drifted off.

I woke not in my bed but in the armchair. The lamp glowed. The hum surrounded me. The man stood in the doorway. The woman behind him, sleeves covering her hands.

“There you are,” he said calmly.
“I was at home,” I whispered.
“We couldn’t reach you for a while. Sometimes the pattern shifts.”
“What pattern?”
“It’s not unusual,” he said.
“What isn’t unusual?” My voice cracked.
“The transition takes time. Don’t drive yourself crazy.” He set his pen down. “You can go. We’ll be in touch.”

I stood on legs that felt backward. The woman held the door. I smelled detergent and cold metal. Outside, a plastic bag fluttered against a lamppost until it tore free.

The following days were easier. Easier than they should have been. I slept. Ate sandwiches like everyone else. Laughed at the right places. Things stayed where I left them the toothbrush, the mirror, the keys. Normal life, like a stage reset between acts.

Two weeks. Three. I forced myself not to count. Not to search for patterns. 
My mind, for once, obeyed.

Then came Tuesday. It’s always Tuesday.

I got home late. The hall smelled of wet stone. A neighbor’s radio fuzzed through a door. Inside my mailbox, between a bill and flyers, was a white envelope. No stamp. No return address.

At my table I sliced it open with a knife. Inside was thick card stock. Four words printed plain as concrete:

Everything ends at three.

Beneath it, an address. Not the old one. Another. An industrial area no one photographs.

I set the card down parallel to the table edge. I stood at the window. Nothing outside but wet asphalt and a slow car. My phone buzzed behind me: 
“Nine tomorrow?” “You good?” I typed “Yeah, all good” and didn’t send it.

In the bathroom the mirror was straight. The toothbrush in its cup. My face normal enough. Maybe too normal. Disappointing, in a way.

That night I lay in bed, thought about the card, thought about the scratch in the table, the barista’s milk spot, the man saying Breathe. At some point 
I slept.

Metal clanged faintly, like silverware in an empty sink. I rose, checked the kitchen. Faucet tight. Knife in place. Table clear. The card lay where I’d left it.

I picked it up. The words calm, immovable.
