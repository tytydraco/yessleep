Do you ever go on social media sites like YouTube and find a post on your home page that seems like almost nobody has clicked on? That is how I discovered what was originally my favorite channel.


One day while I was doom-scrolling, a video appeared in my recommendations, "Red Rabbit - Differences" by a user called TheLoonyLady. The video was an animation showing two rabbits sitting on a bench. The red rabbit being sad about the color of his fur, before the white rabbit approaches him saying he should be proud that he's different. YouTube would eventually recommend me more videos from the channel and ended up becoming a fan of them. One day, I went to comment about an animation error I noticed when saw something odd about their comment section.


The comments almost all about how they were a horrible person, even when I would find positive comments about the animation, the replies would be filled with people saying that TheLoonyLady was a monster. I searched their name to see if they were cancelled or anything but nothing showed up about what they did. All the comments talking about it were extremely vague, saying something like "The fact that YouTube allows this piece of shit to keep posting is disgusting" or "This bitch needs to go to jail immediately". At that point I just assumed that this might be some elaborate troll, plus I usually prefer to separate art from the artist, so I decide to continue watch their content.


I was scrolling through the comments to one of her videos and found one that gave some more insight as to what he did. "What happened to the guy from your livestream, is he ok?". This confused me and I asked what was in the livestream, he ended up giving me a link to a video titled "TheLoonyLady Stream". 


The video showed nothing but darkness for the first ten minutes before showing a woman in a red painted rabbit mask in a large, dark storage facility, the woman then hold up some pieces of paper to the camera. "Welcome to the stream everyone, it's your favorite loony lady here. You're about to witness something special, let's meet him". The woman then walked offscreen before returning pushing a chair with someone sitting on it, wearing a gray jacket and having duct tape covering his mouth. The woman then grabbed a hammer slammed it on the guy's hand, waking him up. As the man let out a loud, muffled scream, she held up another piece of paper only showing three hammers before she hit the guy's other hand and his skull. The woman then appears to leave the facility and as the guy moans in pain and agony, she shows one final image of a storage garage before it is set on fire. the livestream ends with the man screaming as he is burnt alive.


That was the last time I ever saw anything from TheLoonyLady. Sometime afterwards, she seemed to have scrubbed all presence of her of the internet as I can't seem to find any videos or pages of her content or of people talking about. However a few days ago, I received an amber alert on my phone.
