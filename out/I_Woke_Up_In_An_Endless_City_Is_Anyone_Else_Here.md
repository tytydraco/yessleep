Woke up today somewhere different. Not sure what the hell is going on, but is anyone else seeing this?

Never mind. Tried to upload an image, apparently the data here is dogshit. It keeps getting a dozen or so kilobytes in, then claims it got “corrupted” and stops the file transfer. I guess you’ll all have to take my word for it. Lemme explain.

So, I haven’t really ever posted on here before, so I guess I should start with who I am. My name’s Isra, I’m a 22-year-old uni student. I live in London with my family and I have a job at a local bakery, a boyfriend, boring stuff- or, I guess, I did. Because whatever happened, I don’t think I’m in London anymore. Last I remember, I had set down for the night- I remember falling asleep weirdly quickly- and the next thing I knew, I woke up… *here.* I thought I was downtown for a second, though I didn’t know how. There are all these, buildings, I guess? They look like buildings, but there’s something off about them. They don’t make sense. The streets don’t, either. It’s all concrete and rebar and steel and glass, but they’re haphazard. Scattered around in the vague shapes of structures with none of the intent. Some of them are only half-built, cut off at weird angles, like someone took a giant pair of shears to them. Some are way too tall, or thin. Some look like they're inside-out. There's plumbing, wires, even furniture, all along the outside. I even peeked into one, and the whole thing was hollow. I mean *totally* hollow. It was a skyscraper, stretching up farther than I could see, and inside was just… nothing. Empty air. No rooms, no floors. A shell.

That’s the other thing I should mention. I can’t see very far, period. The fog here is so thick, I can only make out two, *maybe* three streets ahead. Most of the buildings don't have a visible top, but some do. You'd think it was some ordinary downtown area at a first glance, if you didn't look at the ground level.

But that falls apart the second you look at the streets. No people. No *cars.* No taxis, or metro entrances, no buses or... I don't know. *Some* things are still here. I can see traffic lights, dimly. They still change colors at regular intervals, lighting up the grey of the fog in greens and reds. There's streetlights, too, but they're not on right now. Other things you'd expect. Mailboxes and newsstands and the like. But nothing... personal? I guess? It's like someone went through with a comb and scraped out anything that could be traced back to a specific person, or a place. There aren't even any street *names.* God, I just realized. No writing here of any kind. What is this place?

The weather is nippy, so I ducked inside a building that's giving me cafe vibes. There's a counter and booths and stuff. I found some muffins in the case behind the counter. They're still fresh. No people, of course. Just me. But, the outlets seem to work here. And so does the internet, albeit very slowly. I guess I can communicate through here. I'll try other sites, see if there's anything in the news about this, but it's going to take a long time. Even this site took what felt like a year to load. Be back soon.

Okay, according to my phone, it's about three hours later. That feels weird to me. I wasn't *that* engrossed with what I was reading. I found something interesting on BBC, though. Most of the recent articles were just normal news stuff- news about the war, some fluff piece about gorillas. I didn't read any of them; it would've taken even longer. But the one article said police have been reporting "a higher than normal percentage of missing persons cases."

Well, fuck.

It hasn't gotten any brighter or darker here. My phone says it's late evening at this point. How can that even be right? Did I sleep for like, 16 hours? I'd really appreciate some clues if anyone knows what's going on.

Wait.

I'll get back to this later. I think there's someone outside.
