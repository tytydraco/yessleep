My childhood was spent in a rough neighborhood. My parents and I lived on the outskirts of town, in an old three-story building. The ramshackle place, with heating broken for as long as anyone could remember, turned into an icebox in winter and a haven for mice and cockroaches in summer. The apartments below reeked of dampness and rot.

In the cold months, my brother and I slept fully dressed — back then it even seemed kind of funny.

All those years, our family was the odd one out. You couldn’t borrow a dime from my mom until payday, and my dad wasn’t the type to hang out with neighbors over drinks. They worked hard, and the troubles of the typical drunk next door meant nothing to them.

It was precisely because of alcohol — or rather because we didn’t drink — that we didn’t fit in.

Everyone on our street drank. Shapeless women with rough faces and bloated, red-faced men threw filthy parties, and their kids — rat-like little brats — rummaged through the trash looking for bottles.

Those kids, scruffy and beaten down, became my brother’s and my best friends. Now it seems strange, but back then we didn’t notice any difference. Like everyone else, we played soccer, collected bottle caps, built forts. In that happy childhood, we were truly equals.

We were young and ruthless, without a shred of pity. The usual victim of our cruel jokes was the neighborhood loon Alexander, nicknamed “Hatty” (because he always wore an ugly fur hat). He earned the name by always sporting a nasty ear-flap hat (a Russian ushanka — a fur hat with ear flaps) no matter the season. Hatty wandered the yard, laughing offbeat, basically a harmless quiet lunatic whom no one needed to bother — but what did that stop us? Hatty was an easy target; we’d splash him with water from bottles, try to pull off his cursed hat, shove him in the mud. He’d wave his arms angrily and throw stones back, cursing loudly and high-pitched.

The whole neighborhood was our playground. We played ball by the garages, climbed trees in the nearby grove, and stayed out until late.

Our favorite game was hide-and-seek. You had to not only hide well but outsmart the seeker and be the first to reach the chosen spot — then you could shout nonsense like “Para-vyra, Jimmy!” and celebrate your victory. Of course, the seeker could do the same if he got there first — then you lost and waited for the next round.

In one such game, the bench across the street was the landmark. I ran around the corner and watched lanky Andrew pacing the yard, not straying far from the bench. Andrew ran faster than me, but he was impatient, so I decided to wear him down. Heading away from the building, I went down the slope toward an old ravine.

Two concrete pipes, about as wide as a person, poked out of the ground there. One was covered with a rusty grate; the other had cracked open, revealing a hole I could fit through.

Looking back, I can’t believe how dumb I was. I was nine. I could’ve slipped and broken my neck. If something had happened, no one would have found me in time — the pipes were out of sight from passersby, and the ravine was too boring for neighborhood kids — maybe that’s why I crawled in.

I climbed down and crouched to look around. The pipe bent at a right angle and disappeared into the slope toward some houses. A few steps away, the passage was blocked by a grate, so no matter how curious I was, I couldn’t go further. It was surprisingly warm inside and smelled a bit sour. Somewhere deep inside, water was flowing and splashing. Sitting there bored me quickly, and after five minutes, I crawled out, accidentally stepping into a shallow puddle.

It was already dark; the other kids went home, and I got scolded for being out so late.

At the time, I didn’t care.

Years passed, and I turned twelve. My parents divorced, and my brother moved away with Dad to another city. I tried smoking and wandered the yards alone more and more. Childhood friendships with the neighbors faded on their own. Most of them became like their parents, and fifteen-year-old Andrew got drunk, went swimming in the river, and drowned in shallow water.

Around the same time, Hatty disappeared. They said his sister took him away.

One evening, I walked past that ravine. Stray dogs had made it their territory — a pack of skinny, always-hungry mutts. Usually, they huddled together all day trying to keep warm; their dark bodies stood out against the concrete pipes.

This time, the dogs were gone — I figured they’d gone hunting for food. I was lost in thought, remembering how I’d crawled into one of those pipes years ago.

From below, I heard a faint whimper. My curiosity was piqued. I thought it must be a puppy — I still liked dogs then.

I stubbed out my cigarette and climbed down, picking up clumps of mud on my boots. I peeked inside and saw something pale and small sitting farther in. In the dim light, it looked like a puppy, but its size reminded me more of a rat or a guinea pig. It moved occasionally and whimpered softly.

At twelve, I desperately wanted a dog of my own. My parents were dead set against it, so I thought — if I can’t have a puppy, maybe I could rescue this one from the pipe and keep it.

My thoughts were interrupted by a rustle — I turned and froze. Three dogs stood to my right, watching me closely. Massive, with snow-white fur, they didn’t look like the usual skinny mutts here. Like statues, the dogs looked identical. I’d never seen dogs like this before.

For a few seconds, we stared at each other. The dogs didn’t move, didn’t growl, showed no signs of aggression. My initial shock faded a bit, and I stepped back cautiously.

Then everything happened like in a fog.

Without a sound, the dogs lunged forward at once. I spun and dashed up the slope. I saw only the road ahead, feeling nothing but my heart tearing my chest apart. Thoughts and emotions shut down.

I remember slipping on the wet ground, pebbles flying from under my shoes. I realized I couldn’t outrun them and turned to face the dogs.

But they weren’t there.

I was stunned. The dogs hadn’t chased me. Catching my breath, I wandered the street to calm down and then went home, soon forgetting the puppy.

With time, I forgot that whole incident.

When I was nineteen, I got a part-time job — they planned to build a parking lot on the ravine, and I was hired as an assistant since by then I knew how to handle machinery. Gradually, starting from one end, they filled the ravine with construction debris, chunks of hardened concrete, and rubble, compacting the top layer. Then they’d lay asphalt on that garbage foundation. Shoddy work, of course, but who cared?

The ravine slowly filled, and eventually I reached the place where I’d once encountered those dogs. Familiar concrete wells still stuck out of the ground. I took a break and lit a cigarette. Memories flooded back — that event from seven years ago. I laughed at my own naiveté.

Suddenly, just like five years before, a whimper came from the pipe. A strong sense of déjà vu swept over me. Apparently, something still lived in those pipes. Not surprising — a good hiding place out of sight.

I figured the dogs had to be driven out — soon construction would reach here, and they’d be buried under gravel and stone dust.

I wore my work coveralls and wasn’t afraid to get dirty; plus, I had a pocket flashlight. I decided to try to lure the dogs out.

Not two steps from the pipe, I heard a voice and froze, listening. From inside the pipe came a soft “...You hear?”

Someone was inside. I stepped closer, and it said again, “You hear?” A minute later, the silence was replaced by whining sounds. There was no doubt the voice came from inside.

I shone my flashlight in.

Just like five years ago, something furry lay in the same spot — the thing I once thought was a puppy, but it was not alive.

A hand gripped a piece of reddish fur… was that a hat? I could see the arm up to the elbow; the flashlight didn’t show more. The whining started again; the unknown fist clenched, the arm twitched, then dropped, and I heard a clear “You hear?”

I don’t know why I didn’t feel fear then. Everything felt like a light fog and unreal.

“Hey, who’s there?” I asked, leaning down. “How did you get in there?”

Silence, then “You hear?” from the depths.

“Can you hear me, idiot? What are you doing in there? Hey?” I shouted into the pipe. I thought some drunk bum had passed out inside and now was having a fit and couldn’t get out.

Of course, I should have called someone first. I could’ve called the cops and left it to them. But the person might have been a neighbor; it was easier to figure out who first and call their family.

I carefully stepped into the pipe — now it seemed very narrow, only up to my waist — bent my knees and dirtied my coveralls.

I saw that half the grate that blocked the pipe years ago was broken and bent aside, opening a passage. Inside, lying with his head down, was a dirty man in filthy clothes. His right hand was stretched forward, clutching a pale-red Soviet fur hat (ushanka). The man twitched and whimpered; his fist clenched, his arm jerked and dropped again.

I tapped his hand with my flashlight and shone the beam on his face.

He raised his head and looked at me. A chill ran down my spine.

I recognized Hatty.

He kept staring blankly. He clearly didn’t understand who I was or where he was. He said “You hear?” again, squeezing the hat in his fist. I couldn’t imagine how he ended up there.

“Hatty, do you understand me?” I asked. “Do you remember me? Let’s go home, okay? Give me your hand. Let’s go home!”

He only whimpered again. I reached out, grabbed his jacket and pulled him. Suddenly Hatty screeched, jerked his head and bit my palm hard. I cried out and pulled back — he bit through the skin to the blood.

“What the hell are you doing?” I cried, wincing. Hatty didn’t answer, just stared blankly.

“Fine, screw you, crazy — let the cops dig you out,” I said and was about to climb out when I heard a rustle from deeper inside.

I shone my flashlight into the depths.

Behind the broken grate, a few meters away, a dog writhed. It looked like the dogs I ran from years ago — white fur, muscular body.

The dog stared into nothing with glassy eyes. Its mouth didn’t open; it didn’t bark or growl. Like a broken mechanical doll, it writhed. The only sound was its body scraping the concrete.

The dog had no legs.

When the flashlight lit its face, the dog stopped twisting, turned toward me and fixed me with its gaze.

I froze, horrified.

Bending like a caterpillar, the dog began crawling toward me. Its body bent and stretched like rubber.

Hatty moaned and rolled onto his back. I saw with horror that he had no legs below the knees; his pant legs hung loose.

The dog managed to crawl to the hole in the grate and began pushing its body out. Its fur rippled; something moved beneath the skin. I looked into its gray dead eyes.

…Suddenly I heard the foreman yelling at me from above.

The spell broke.

I jumped out of the well and stumbled away. Running, I heard a muffled “You hear?” behind me. I didn’t look back.

That same day I quit and left town. I’d had enough. Now I live in a suburb outside Moscow; I saved enough to buy a room in a communal apartment. I’ve worked in an auto shop for about ten years.

The parking lot was built long ago, and the pipes were buried.

Sometimes I think back and try to analyze what happened.

I’d like to convince myself it was all a hallucination, but some facts won’t let me:

Dogs can’t move by bending and stretching their bodies like worms or caterpillars.

Hatty, who disappeared years ago, looked unchanged — not thinner, his clothes the same. How he lost his legs, I don’t even try to guess.

I crawled in at noon and came out in the evening. The foreman, who snapped me out of it, was looking for me, thinking I’d skipped work. So I was in that pipe for at least six hours.

Most importantly — my palm bears the marks of Hatty’s teeth. The doctor confirmed it was a human bite. I lied about how I got the scars.

I still have no answers. Former coworkers said they often saw strange white dogs near the parking lot. They watch people for long periods but never come close. The identical dogs never bark and only show up at night.

They haunt my dreams constantly.

A week ago, they announced on TV that a supermarket would be built on that ravine. That means the parking lot will be torn down, and the rubble we piled up will be removed — they’ll need a more solid foundation. So they’ll get to the pipes.

Maybe then I’ll have the courage to tell everything, and the police can pull Hatty out of the pipe.

I’m sure he’s still there.
