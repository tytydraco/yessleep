Hello Reddit

I know a lot of you on this platform have encountered or at least heard of paranormal event.
Recently, I believe I’ve accidentally saw one for myself when I moved into my new flat.

It’s not anything insane or out of this world like seeing a huge shadowy monster escaping from under my bed, but it still left me quite shook.

After a couple of days, an old notebook appeared onto my living room table. I just went to pick up the phone only to be greeted by a scam caller trying to sell me a new car, and suddenly, it was there.
It looked old, the cover was made of studded, dirty brown leather, and the pages had that yellowish hue typical of old books.

On the cover, a metal engraving read: “36 Ashfield Lane”.

Maybe someone more qualified on this subject can help me understand what is going on, and if this address has any relevance whatsoever.
As of now I’ll simply relay what’s written on the first page.

Finally, after 30 year of service I can finally retire, it feels good to finally stay on land knowing you won’t sail the seas any time soon.

I haven’t got much time left, but I’m gonna make it worth it.

My son has found me this pretty little place in the big city, it’s not much, but it’s cozy and the neighborhood is nice, so I ain’t complaining.

It’s a bit lonely without Marlene by my side, I just wish I would’ve spent more time with her.

At least my son and his wife come to visit from time to time, and it seems like there’s gonna be a third mouth to feed soon enough

I finally feel happy

Can’t help but notice that there’s very few people in this apartment building.
Most of them are just empty, or at least it feels like it. Maybe I’m no longer used to the civilian life, but this silence……. is deafening.

I need to go outside a lot, as much as I love that new house I don’t like the solitude of those apartments.
A buddy of mine opened a small donut shop nearby and there’s a Chinese vendor that always refreshes his stock with new stuff, so I keep myself busy.

Yet I still can’t stop thinking about it, why can’t I hear anyone in this place, am I going deaf already?

I tried knocking on all the doors, yet nobody responded, I even rang the doorbell.
I went to each floor multiple times and there was a single trace of life.

I went to talk to the owner of that Chinese thrift shop down the street.
Doesn’t talk much, but he’s certainly been here longer than me, so I expected him to know at least a little.

He was surprised when I told him I lived there,
He thought that place was completely abandoned

I asked my son how he found this place, he said he found an article on a newspaper.
The price was pretty fair, not too cheap, not too high, seemed legit.
Said he gave the money to a certain Bob Walbert

Guess I gotta talk to this Bob one of these days.

Someone was walking outside my door last night

I could hear their heavy footsteps on the floorboards, creaking with each steps, but I could never tell how far they were, it felt like they were walking on the spot, just far enough so that I could hear them walking.

I looked outside my door wielding my revolver, trying to see who’s the son of a bitch making all that noise.

But I saw nothing, just the darkness of the hallway

Are they pulling some kind of prank on me, some hooligans trying to start some trouble?

Oh I’ll give them trouble alright!

I’m getting tired of this haunted apartments bullshit

The footsteps showed up again this night.
I could hear them getting closer.

I put my ear near the door, trying to hear something.

Maybe I heard too much

Tonight the footstep got closer, and closer, and closer.

I held my revolver tight in my hand, ready too shoot at that fucker.

I loosened my grip for a moment when, as it was standing outside, the door separating us from one another, I heard it whisper, in a calm yet resolute booming voice

“Open the door private”

I didn’t obey its orders I shot through the door multiple times, hoping it was fatally wounded.

A moment passed, and finally, I heard the footsteps getting farther and farther away

Then, nothing, just silence.

The sweet, somber silence I now learned to appreciate.
