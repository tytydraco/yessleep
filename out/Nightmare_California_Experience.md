So, this happened a few years ago, and I still can’t fully wrap my head around it. I was driving through the California desert, exhausted and just looking for a place to crash for the night. My GPS was acting up, and my phone had barely any signal. That’s when I saw it—a glowing sign in the distance: Hotel California.

The place looked old but charming, with this warm, amber glow spilling out of stained glass windows. The woman at the front desk had a twisted sort of beauty—like someone who belonged to a different era. She handed me a brass key (yeah, a literal key, not a keycard) and said, “You can check out any time you like, but you can never leave.” I laughed, thinking it was just part of the quirky vibe.

My room was incredible. Vintage furniture, a balcony overlooking a garden filled with candlelit lanterns. I could hear faint music, this dreamy, almost hypnotic melody drifting through the open window. I decided to explore.

The halls were a maze. I’d turn a corner and find myself back where I started. I walked into a ballroom where people were dancing, dressed in clothes from decades ago. Their faces were blurred, like an old photograph out of focus. When I tried talking to them, they’d just stare through me, like I wasn’t there.

The dining room was lavish—gilded chandeliers, velvet drapes, and tables set with crystal glasses. I sat down, and a waiter in a crisp white jacket poured me a glass of pink champagne, perfectly chilled with ice. It tasted… hollow. Like it was only pretending to be champagne. Around me, guests indulged in decadent dishes, but they never swallowed, never seemed satisfied.

At some point, I was led into a grand room where a feast was laid out. The air was thick with the smell of roasted meat and herbs. The guests encircled a silver platter, where something large and shrouded lay. One of them handed me a steely knife, its blade impossibly sharp. The guests chanted softly, urging me to carve. I peeled back the silver cover, and what lay beneath was… wrong. Flesh that seemed to pulse, eyes that stared back, pleading.

I dropped the knife and ran. But every corridor twisted back on itself. Every door led to the same hallway. I was losing time—hours, maybe days. The music never stopped, a haunting loop that gnawed at my sanity.

I confronted the woman at the front desk again. Her smile was unchanged, eyes dark and empty. “You can check out any time you like,” she said, “but you can never leave.”

In desperation, I smashed a window with a brass candlestick, but outside was nothing but a mirror, reflecting the hotel back at me. It’s been days, weeks, maybe longer. Time doesn’t seem to work the same way here. I’m starting to forget why I was on the road, where I was going before I ended up here.

If you’re ever driving down a long desert highway, and you see a warm light and a sign that says Hotel California—keep driving. Please, keep driving.
