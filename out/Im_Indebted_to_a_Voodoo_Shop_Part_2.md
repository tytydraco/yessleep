After completing my first task for King Creole I couldn’t leave my room for days. I was lucky that he didn’t seem to have another task for me right after retrieving his lost axe-murdering voodoo doll. That left me time to rot in my room and frantically clip at my nails with a nail clipper, something I did whenever I was in an especially horrible mood. If my dad hadn’t entered my room, I probably wouldn’t have had any nails left to clip.

“Hey sweetheart,” he said as he entered my room. I could tell just from his tone of voice how exhausted he was. He’d gotten two jobs to cope with the loss of his factory job, but these jobs were hard work for barely enough pay. He was working himself to the bone for me and my mom, and yet he was still here trying to check in on me. “What’s the matter? You haven’t left your room in days,” he asked and sat down beside me in bed, quickly taking my nail clippers before I could destroy any more of my nails.

“I did…something really bad, Daddy,” I said as I tucked my knees under my chin. I couldn’t begin to figure out how to tell him that my now-dead friends and I had pissed off some evil voodoo man and know I was forced to do his bidding until he decided that I had sufficiently served him. And I still wasn’t convinced that he wouldn’t kill me at the end of my tasks.

“Judging by your expression you can’t really find a way to explain it to me, huh?” he asked me as he put an arm around me and pulled me close to him. He could read me like an open book and always seemed to be able to read my mind. Although I doubt he couldn’t even begin to understand my situation. “Whatever you’ve gotten yourself into sweetie, I know you can get yourself back out of it. And if not, I will always be here to help you no matter what, understand?”

It was just the kind of thing my dad could always tell me to make me feel better. Just that simple affirmation that he would always be here was enough to keep me going. I pulled my face out from my knees and offered him a small kiss on the cheek and a smile.

“Thanks, Daddy. You’re the best.” I told him as I wiped the tears in my eyes. He nodded wrapping an arm around me again and pulled me to him, kissing me back. He left soon afterward to collapse into bed until he had to wake up for another shift. I sat in bed for a few minutes before standing up and leaving my room for the first time in days. And as if on cue my phone began to ring in my hands.

I looked down at it and felt my blood freeze as I saw who was calling me. ‘King Creole’ was the contact who was calling me. And yet I had never given him my phone number. I hesitated to answer and contemplated even hanging up on him or letting it go to voicemail. But I wasn’t about to bring whatever voodoo powers he had on top of my family, so I answered it after a few seconds of indecision.

“The marvelous Miss Mace! I was beginning to think I had the wrong number.” Creole’s southern accent came pouring out of my phone. That didn’t make much sense to me since he somehow knew my phone number and had even somehow gotten my phone to know it was him. So I chalked it up as some kind of joke he was making.

“What can I do for you, sir?” I asked him how a minimum wage worker might respond. If he was upset by my lack of laughter or joy in his call he certainly didn’t let it show as he continued with his cheery call to me.

“Drop by the shop, and I’ll let you know what I need returned to me. Take your time!” he said with a chuckle as he hung up on me before I could answer him. I sighed as I let my phone drop to my bed and groaned loudly. I shoved my face into my hands and felt like ripping it off. But I needed to do these favors if I didn’t want to end up like my friends. So after a couple of slaps to my cheeks, I left my room and quickly ran past my parents and into the street.

The walk to the shop was uneventful and soon I was again standing in front of the shop. It felt strange being back here. I had a horrible feeling about this place now that hadn’t existed when I had first broken in. But I didn’t have a choice. So sucking it up as much as I could, I entered the shop, the sad rusy bell heralding my arrival.

“Mace! So lovely to see you again!” Creole was waiting for me at the register and had his hat on the counter in front of him. “Come, come.” He quickly waved me over as he stood back up and quickly placed the hat back on his head. Underneath the hat was a small voodoo doll. It didn’t appear to be anyone specific and it was staring up at me with a stink eye. It clearly wasn’t happy to see me at all.

“What’s my task this time, sir?” I asked, trying to keep my disdain for him at a minimum. It was hard to be enthusiastic around him, especially with what I had already done for him. But whatever enthusiasm I lacked he made up for it in spades.

“I’m so glad that you asked, Mace!” He said as he put his arm around me and pulled me into his chest. He didn’t have much of a sense of personal space. I went practically limp as he pulled me behind the register and sat me down on the chair behind it. “I need you to break into another house, but this time you’re going to get me something I want, instead of something I lost.” Once his sentence was done he let out a little hum at the end, his excitement just pissed me off.

“What exactly is it, sir?” I asked him, losing the battle of making it look like I gave a shit anymore. He held up a photo between his fingers and flipped his wrist to show me the full photo. Staring back at me was an ornate clock that seemed to be made of gold and encrusted with rubies. “Are you asking me to break into a museum?” I asked sarcastically. This clock looked like something that belonged at Versailles and certainly not something that would be so easy for me to steal.

“I can assure you it’s not. If that was the case I could easily find an easier way of getting it. No, I got a tip about it selling on the underground art market, and I’ve wanted this here clock for quite a while. So be a doll and go get it for me?” he said with that creepy smile still plastered on his face. I couldn’t get used to him. His overly cheery demeanor, his stitches, his button eyes. Everything about him just screamed at me to run away. And yet I couldn’t. I sighed and reached out for the photo. But before I could take it he quickly pulled his hand back and produced his other gloved hand to me. In that hand was a pair of earplugs.

“What are these for?” I asked him hesitantly. I took them and examined them. They appeared to be just normal earplugs.

“Something special about that clock. Otherwise, I wouldn’t be too interested in it,” he told me through a large smile and chuckles. “It’s in your best interest that once you break into this house, you put these on.” He twirled his fingers at me and produced the photo which had been in his other hand.

“What if there’s someone there? I wouldn’t be able to hear them.” I took the photo from him and looked down at the address which again appeared magically on the photo. It was in the same neighborhood as the axe-murdering voodoo doll had been in.

“I doubt there’ll be anyone left to worry about.” He said with another hummed-out melody. Just as I was about to turn and exit the shop, loud banging began emanating from somewhere behind Creole.

“What the fuck?” I said as my heart nearly exploded from the startlement. The look on Creole’s face just further chills up and down my spine. I was so used to seeing that stupid smile on his face that seeing the scowl that crawled across his face as he turned his head toward the source of the banging nearly caused me to shit myself.

“Mace, be a doll and go out and do your task, please? I have some other business to attend to,” he said as he produced his cane from thin air and began walking toward the backroom. I thought he was going towards his office but instead, he headed straight down towards what I figured was the basement.

I wasn’t about to be around to see whatever he was going to do, so I quickly shoved everything into my jacket pocket and exited the shop as quickly as I could. I was halfway down the street before I realized that I had left my house so quickly that I hadn’t even bothered to bring my lockpick kit. Groaning I made a U-turn and started jogging back toward my neighborhood. I got there just in time to see my dad leave for his next shift. I waved bye to him as he drove away and quickly entered my house.

“Mace, honey?” My mom called out as I entered the house. She poked her head out of the kitchen and waved at me. She looked just as exhausted as my dad looked since she had also had to start working for the first time since I was a toddler.

“Hey Mom, I’m not back for long, I just forgot something,” I said as I started up the stairs toward my room.

“Have you seen Jess lately? Her mom is worried sick about her.” I froze at the entrance to my room as I heard my mom ask me this from downstairs. The memory of seeing Jess turned into a human puppet was still seared into my mind. Her missing insides and that fucking smile that he had forced her to wear.

“N-no. Not since we last hung out.” I told her, not technically a lie. I quickly entered my room, swiped my lock picks, and shoved them into my jacket pocket. Just as quickly I made my way back downstairs to find my path to the front door blocked by my mom.

“You sure you haven’t seen her?” She asked me, clearly not believing me. I could understand her suspicion since me and Jess had such a close friendship.

“No, Mom. I haven’t seen her since we last hung out together,” I reiterated. I don’t really know what my face looked like at the time but my mom was moved by whatever it looked like. She nodded and moved out of the way for me.

“Are you okay?” she asked me. I wanted to tell her no I wasn’t. But just like with my dad I had no idea where to even begin with that story. I wish I could’ve told them both. It would’ve made things so much easier in the long run. But I just wasn’t able to do so.

“Yea, Mom. I’m okay,” I lied to her, giving her a quick kiss on the cheek and leaving the house. Out of the corner of my eyes as I turned to walk down the sidewalk I saw her make the sign of the cross on herself and towards me. It made me feel a little better, but I wished that God could just strike me down right then and there instead.

Walking toward the target neighborhood again, it felt like something was watching me. The paranoia was getting to me as I flinched with every single noise that came my way. When I crossed the street towards the target and a dog started barking at me I thought that was it and I was getting the K9. Instead, I was just faced with an especially cranky dog staring at me from behind a fence. Tossing him a stick to calm down I quickly walked past him and toward my target.

The house looked pretty much the same as the last house. Especially in a suburb like this one, pretty much every house looked the exact same. The main difference was the lock before me. It was another easy one for me, but this time there were two of them and there wasn’t anything to hide me from plain view. No pants to hide me or anything out on their front lawn either. Creole just had to call me for this job in the middle of the afternoon.

I looked around quickly and sure that no one was watching me quickly went to work. I knelt right before the door and tried to be as small and inconspicuous as I could possibly be. The locks were simple enough, but my sweaty palms and shaking hands kept the process slower than I would’ve liked. The sound of an approaching car nearly sent me into a panic attack, I quickly stood up and shoved myself up against the corner of the door. Lucky for me it was a passing car and took no notice of me.

“Fuck…” I sighed as I stood there like some lame Halloween decoration for a few seconds to get my heart to calm down. Going back to work the second lock was quickly dispatched and the door opened. Putting my tools back in their pouch I quickly dug into my jacket pockets and pulled out the earplugs. I smushed them into my ears and with a few quick breaths I entered the home.

The first thing to strike me about this house was the amount of dust in the air. It was like this place had been abandoned for 40 years with the amount of dust up in the air. The next thing to strike me was the horrendous smell. It was like a strange mixture of citrus and pork and it instantly sent my stomach into a revolt. It didn’t make any sense, this house looked just as prim and proper as all the other houses, there was no way it was just left here to rot.

Making my way through the entrance hall, I looked around for the clock, wishing that I could just take the earplugs out and follow the ticks it would be making. But remembering how Creole’s advice and trinket had saved me from the ax-murdering voodoo doll, I quickly pushed my earplugs in deeper just to be sure.

It didn’t take me long to find the clock. It was prominently displayed in the large living room that the homeowners had. What was more shocking was the scene that I discovered in the living room itself. The source of the dust had been from there and so was the smell, the smell which I discovered had been rot.

Several people were present in the living room, though by the look of them not a single one of them was alive. Those further away from the clock were slowly rotting away. Their bodies bloated and putrified. That was enough for me to throw up on the floor and sit there gagging for a few minutes as I desperately tried to cover my mouth and nostrils. As you went further toward the clock the decomposition spread, some were skeletons or fragments of skeletons. And closest to the clock was nothing but piles of dust and bone shards. All of the bodies had their arms stretched out towards the clock as if there had been a mad dash towards it.

I was left speechless. If it hadn’t been so horrifying it might have been strangely beautiful, like some weird Renaissance painting or something. The trouble for me now was twofold. Getting to the clock and somehow sneaking it out of the neighborhood. It was decently sized maybe about a foot tall and two feet across and there was no hope of me just shoving it under my jacket and walking nonchalantly down the street with it. Thinking it over, I elected to wrap my jacket around it and carry it down the street as if I was just holding my jacket.

“Good enough,” I shrugged as I took my jacket and took a few nervous steps toward the clock. I half expected to begin turning into dust along with however many people had been in this living room. But I figured that for it to have power over you, you had to hear it ticking. Stepping in the piles of dust and sending them airborne I quickly held my breath to avoid breathing in the skeleton particles. I swiftly wrapped the clock up in my jacket and lifted it into my arms.

I looked back behind me, expecting to see zombies or ghosts or fucking bigfoot for all I knew. But the haunting scene remained the same. Seems as though it was a permanent fixture once you heard the clock. I didn’t even want to fiddle with my earplugs, terrified that if I did they would fall out of my ears and I would hear the clock’s mechanisms.

Without any more thought toward it, I quickly made my way toward the door and out into the neighborhood. I let out a long and cathartic sigh and quickly began to walk towards the voodoo shop. It was the longest walk of my life and not just because I had a cursed clock with me. I was scared about what other horrible things King Creole would have me do. This was only his second favor and the first one had nearly killed me, and this second one had me carrying this cursed clock out in the open.

Arriving at the shop was like taking off your bra on an especially hot summer day, quickly opening the shop I saw Creole at the register sewing one of his eyes back on. He turned the button in his hand towards me and smiled that stupid grin of his again. I was almost glad that I couldn’t hear whatever bullshit he was saying.

He motioned for me to bring the clock over and allowed his partially sewn-on button eye to dangle on his face. He was clearly more excited over the clock over the wound that he had received. I placed my jacket lump on the register and opened it up for him to look at. He was giddy with excitement and flicked the clock’s face with his fingers. He then motioned for me that it was safe to remove my earplugs.

I was worried he was tricking me, but remembering I still owed him three more favors I removed the earplugs slowly and waited for my ears to adjust to the sudden influx of sound that had been denied to them.

“Excellent work, Mace!” Creole was giddy with excitement as he examined the clock. He did tsk with annoyance as the dangling button eye kept softly patting him on the cheek with every movement. He quickly placed it back against his eye socket and with impossible speed quickly sewed it back on. “That’s much better.” He sighed in contentment.

“What exactly is this clock, sir?” I asked him, honestly and genuinely curious about it. I took a better look at it and realized that it was sort of in the shape of a crucifix.

“This is a Monstrance Clock. In more ways than one.” He giggled which got me to roll my eyes at his dumb pun. “This particular clock has an aging curse on it. As long as it ticks, anyone who can hear it will die and begin to go through the process of decomposition. What stage you are depends on how far away you are from it.” He was using his gloves to polish the clock and I could tell he was very excited to have it.

“So…who were all the people in that living room?” I asked him, pulling him away from his clock care routine. He stared at me for a moment with a blank expression before he seemed to process what I was saying.

“Some cult I believe. They thought this clock would usher in the return of Christ or something. I guess in a way they did return to him.” He made himself laugh uncontrollably at that. I groaned and turned my head towards the wall of voodoo dolls. They were all staring back at me and I couldn’t help but get the goosebumps from that. That was until I noticed two familiar-looking voodoo dolls on the wall. The dolls were exact matches to what Jeff and Tom had been wearing.

Quickly snatching them from the wall I placed them down on the counter next to the clock and stared at Creole as he continued to giggle to himself. “Let me buy them,” I told him as I slid them closer to him.

“No.” He told me straight up. Any sentiment of laughter and happiness was gone from his voice. That southern drawl had gone from annoying to terrifying in an instant. He was being serious.

“W-why not?” I demanded to know, reaching out for the Tom and Jeff voodoo dolls but before I could grab them they disappeared before my eyes.

“Your credit’s no good here, Macedonia.” Creole’s voice had grown hoarse and he was clearly in no mood to listen to whatever I had to say to him. “Ya’ll are already in my debt, and I wouldn’t want you going any further just to save your stupid friends. In fact, you should count yourself lucky that I don’t place you on that wall with them. Or, have my fun with you like with Jess.” He stood up and reached a hand out to me, gripping my shoulder tightly. “Go home, and wait for me to call you again. Because if ya don’t leave now, I might lose my temper.” He shoved me slightly and I quickly got the message.

I reached out and grabbed my jacket from the register and ran as fast as I could out of the shop. If Creole had eyes there would’ve been murderous intent in them. As I walked home dejected, I began to think back on what had just happened. A few weeks ago me and my friends were just breaking into abandoned places to steal some things and help our families through this hard time. Now? I was indebted to some evil voodoo corpse and one of my friends was dead while to other two were turned into voodoo dolls.

My life is fucked and there’s no other way to look at it. Maybe I should’ve gone to college after all.
