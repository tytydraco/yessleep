I first noticed when I was about to go on my morning walk. I greeted Mr. Lorem as he was tending his garden, and he greeted me back, but I stopped as I noticed the mask. He wore this white porcelain mask, with cut-out eyes and a thin black grin.

"Where'd you get the mask?" I asked, an eyebrow raised.

"Just appeared on my porch, and decided to try it on!" he said, happily.

"Well, it looks good on you." I complimented, before going on my walk. I was a little creeped out by the mask though.

The next day I was at the grocery store when I ran into the elementary school teacher, Shelia. I was surprised that she had on the same mask as Mr Lorem. We had a quick discussion, and it was just unnerving how happy she was. Usually, she would be gentle, but tired, now she was energetic and ecstatic.

This was starting to get weird. 

Another time I was walking through the park when I spotted a couple on a bench. They were wearing the same masks as Mr. Lorem and Sheila. They looked towards me and I could swear the grins on their mask became wider. They waved, and I waved back and picked up my pace. 

As I left the park, I passed a man walking his dog. I was shocked to see it wasn't just him wearing a mask, his dog wore one too, as if the mask was morphed and shaped to fit the dog's face. They both turned their heads in unison and I waved at them. The man cheerfully waved back. I started to hurry my way back home.

As the days passed, more and more people began wearing those strange masks. The abnormality was becoming clear, and I was getting more scared with each passing moment. Wherever I went, there would always be people who wore those strange masks, the abnormality was starting to frighten me. And no matter who I asked where they got their masks from, they'd always give me the same answer.

"Just appeared on my porch, and decided to try it on!" 

Some of my coworkers have even begun wearing those masks. One coworker, Calvin, who was sometimes very stingy when working in a group, was now wearing a mask, positivity flowing within his demeanor. I talked to some of my coworkers about it, and they too are freaked out by the sudden amount of masked men and women in the town. But those coworkers I discussed about the masks showed up at the office with those masks worn a few days later. Even my boss has begun wearing a mask. 

Worse, the more the days went on, the more I could feel eyes on me whenever I went outside to go to work or run an errand, or anything else, I could always feel like people were watching me. I stood out as one of the few people who didn't have a mask on their face. No matter where I went, people wore those masks. 

I couldn't recognize the people I knew, my neighbors, coworkers, friends, and others. Their masks made me feel like I wasn't talking to the real person, to me they were just another person wearing a mask. 

I felt my spirit become more demoralized with each passing day as the masked people began to take up the population of regular people in my town.

One morning, I went to my porch to get the newspaper, something else was waiting for me.

A white porcelain mask.

I looked around and saw neighbors and people on the sidewalk, all wearing masks. 

I looked down at the mask once more. A sensation was growing inside me. A sensation where I wanted to wear the mask. To have joy overwhelm me. I quickly shook my head and slammed the door shut and locked it.

This was getting ridiculous, all of this couldn't be real. I plopped down on my couch and decided to sleep off the stress. This was too much for me to handle. Hopefully, it was all some strange dream I hadn't woken up from yet. Hopefully, things will go back to normal tomorrow.

I woke up to a loud pounding on my door, I treaded to the keyhole and looked through it, my heart skipped a beat at the sight. Mr Lorem was standing there, holding the mask on my front porch. Behind him stood some of my other neighbors, and people I knew.

I quickly rushed to my window and pulled the curtains, and my eyes widened in horror. A small crowd was around my house. Neighbors and townsfolk alike gathered outside. They all had that same white porcelain mask on their faces. But something was different. Their mouths no longer showed grins, their mouths now showed wide smiles. Smiles that glimmered not only happiness but malevolence.

I quickly stepped back the window and pulled the curtains back. My heart pounding, and I thought it would burst once I heard a window shatter. There was no shattering though. I quickly rushed to my kitchen and armed myself with the largest knife I found. With that, I quickly considered my options.

If I were to escape through a window, I could make a run for it and hop over a few fences. Then I'd be on my way. But that wouldn't help at all. For all I knew, they would probably cut me off somewhere, surround me, force me down, and then I'd have a mask placed on my face. And then I would become one of those mindless, happy zombies.

I could try calling the police, but that wouldn't help either. They would have masks on their faces too. So I couldn't call them for help. That would add to the amount of people in the crowd, and worst case scenario they would force their way into my house.

So I had no choice but to hide. Find somewhere to hide and wait. Wait for the inevitable to happen. And that's exactly what I'm doing right now, typing this out as my hands tremble with the clutched knife. I'm sweating profusely and I can't stop panting. There's nothing I can do right now. I could put a little effort into fighting back, but that would mean nothing. 

I can only cradle in the closet I'm hiding in and wait for the worst. 

I heard more loud pounding on my door, and I didn't want to check again. It's been about 40 minutes since. I haven't heard them make any move. No broken windows, no busting down the door. Waiting for me to open the door. So I could join them. 

And wear a mask that would take me over with joy and positivity.
