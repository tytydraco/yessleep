**Encounter with Skinwalker (Part-1)**

Hello. If you are reading this then I want to inform it’s my first-time writing stories so I don’t know much things so please feel free to drop any suggestions for further improvements. This story is of Skinwalkers and my encounter with them. Its fictional, of-course but hope you will like it:

Hello, I’m Robin 25 male. I might not make it alive after posting it on the internet but now I don’t even care. For a background I used to work at a very secret government body whose name I am yet to know but I know it was related to **Shoshone National Forest**. People used to come there a lot to enjoy their summer vacation whereas the winter remained empty. This happened at summer of 2004 AD, June to be more accurate. The beginning of the summer, happy children with their parents enjoying their stay at the forest.

Those were the good parts but there was something weird happening around. We were tasked to take our jeep and roam around different places especially when some hikers hadn’t left the forest premises. Usually it isn’t a big problem, just some forgetful hikers thinking that the time of sign out is at 12PM instead of 10AM or some hikers packing up or still sleeping. But sometimes, stains of blood parts of body their belongings but no body. They were killed by something so powerful they could wipe out a team of ten hikers without any problem, heck that thing didn’t even leaved any footprint or anything which could help us identify it or know where it took them. Strangely we were told not to touch or tamper anything and report it to our manager and stay there until a team if people arrived to “investigate” but the thing is they would not allow us the staff to see them work and instead of normal paramedics it was a private company dressed in red hazmat suit with gas mask.

All if these felt strange along with this one rule. All staff and hikers were not allowed to roam around after 18:00 and our base would go to lock down where all of the staff ate food and then immediately sleep at 20:00 and we had turns to lookout (2 at a time), and were commend to shoot down any creatures even humans which I found out to be a bit strange.

One night I was assigned a role to train a rookie named Ben who was 20 and male at that time. We spent few days together I taught him different things and the rules and we also witnessed another creepy disappearance of a hiker. He also thought it was strange, we also stayed up from 2am to 6am in morning for our to lookout.

One day it was 17:00 we went to a deeper part of forest for last check of the night when suddenly Ben saw a young girl preferably at the age of 7 or 8 with a yellow jacket at a distance of around 25 meters. He got off the jeep and headed to the girl and as per protocol he carried a radio a flashlight and few weapon and ammo for safety. The girl ran to deeper forest going out of my sight and Ben went after her too. I wasn’t worried at all it was usual for a child to get lost or run away from their parents because they were not satisfied and, in that case, I also called my manager and reported that girl. I turned on the music of the jeep and enjoyed the view of the forest.

Few minuets passed and then some more and it was 17:40. Now I got worried I called him on the radio didn’t get any responses and then I followed company policy and returned before 18:00 to our base. I hoped he’d be there but he wasn’t. I thought he found other lookouts and went to their base.

I quickly reported Ben’s disappearance to the boss, my hands shaking as I held the radio. The minutes dragged by in agonizing silence, and when I returned to base, I found it eerily empty. My manager was nowhere to be found, and the fluorescent lights flickered overhead. I sat, trying to process everything, but there was no time for answers.

The next day, I was assigned a new partner—Sofiya, 25 years old, like me. She had transferred in after Ben’s incident, but they hadn’t told me why. At first, I was skeptical, unsure of how she would handle the forest, but I couldn’t deny how drawn I was to her. Sofiya was calm, confident, and mysterious. Her sharp eyes often lingered on the deeper parts of the woods, as though seeing something beyond the trees.

The days with Sofiya were a blur of routine patrols through the dense forest, the jeep’s headlights slicing through the dark. There was a growing tension between us, something unspoken that I couldn’t quite put my finger on. Maybe it was the weight of the job, or the mystery of Ben’s disappearance.

One evening, as we drove deeper into the woods, I decided to tell her about Ben. "I had a partner before you," I began, my voice low. "His name was Ben. A rookie like you, but..." I paused, my mind replaying that night. "He disappeared. We were on patrol, and he went after a little girl wearing a yellow jacket. I thought it was just a lost child, but when I called him, there was no response. He didn’t come back. No body, no trace—nothing."

Sofiya’s eyes flicked toward me, her expression serious. “And you think... something took him?”

I nodded. "I don’t know what to think anymore. After that, I started hearing things—voices in the woods, like Ben, calling my name. But it wasn’t him. It couldn’t be."

Sofiya’s gaze hardened. "You think it was one of those things—the ones that mimic voices?"

I glanced at her, her words hitting harder than I expected. "Maybe. I don’t know anymore."

The silence in the jeep grew thick, the weight of the forest pressing in on us. But before either of us could say more, a sound broke through the tension—a soft rustling, just out of view.

"Did you hear that?" Sofiya whispered, her voice tense.

I nodded, my heart pounding. "Yeah."

Then, a voice. Clear, almost familiar.

"Robin... Sofiya..." It was Ben’s voice.

I froze. It couldn’t be.

Sofiya didn’t hesitate. She slammed the jeep into drive and sped down the trail, the voice fading behind us. But as we approached the base, I could feel it—something was watching us, and we weren’t alone.

Just before we entered the base, I heard it again—faint, but unmistakable. A distorted whisper of my name.
