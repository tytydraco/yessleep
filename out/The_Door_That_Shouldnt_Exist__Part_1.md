I moved into this house three months ago. It was cheap—suspiciously cheap—but the landlord said the previous owner had moved suddenly, leaving everything behind. I should have known that was a red flag. But when you're desperate, you overlook things. You convince yourself that luck exists, that maybe you just stumbled onto a deal too good to pass up. And when you’re in a situation like mine, you don’t ask too many questions. You tell yourself that every abandoned home has a story, and it’s not your place to dig too deeply into why someone left in such a hurry.

At first, I was grateful for the opportunity. The house was bigger than anything I could have afforded otherwise, with beautiful wooden floors, high ceilings, and intricate crown molding. It was the kind of place that hinted at a storied past, a life well-lived before it was left behind. I imagined what kind of people had once called this house home, their laughter echoing through its halls, their voices imprinting on the walls like echoes trapped in time.

But something about the silence here unsettled me. It wasn’t the peaceful stillness I had expected—it was deeper, heavier, an emptiness that felt unnatural. At first, I chalked it up to new-house jitters, the discomfort of adjusting to an unfamiliar space. But the feeling never quite went away. It clung to the air, thick and suffocating, a presence just beyond the realm of perception.

Strange things started happening. The lights would flicker, sometimes in rhythmic patterns that seemed deliberate, though I told myself it was just faulty wiring. I would hear faint noises in the night—soft creaks and distant whispers, the kind you can almost convince yourself are just the house settling. Items moved, not drastically, but just enough to make me doubt myself. A book slightly out of place, a chair shifted ever so slightly, the blanket at the foot of my bed folded differently than I had left it. Small things, insignificant on their own, but together, they began to form a pattern I couldn’t ignore.

Then there were the dreams—vivid, unsettling. In them, I wasn’t alone. Shadows stretched unnaturally across the floor, voices whispered just beyond comprehension, and the sensation of something watching me was so intense that I often woke up drenched in sweat, gasping for breath. It was as though something had followed me out of sleep, lingering in the dark corners of my room, just beyond the reach of the light.

And yet, despite the gnawing unease, I stayed. Perhaps it was stubbornness, a refusal to be scared off by my own imagination. Perhaps it was financial necessity, the knowledge that I couldn’t afford to break my lease. Or perhaps, deep down, I was waiting—waiting to understand what had driven the last tenant away. Waiting to see if whatever had driven them out would come for me too.

The house was old, but not crumbling. It had character. High ceilings, intricate crown molding, solid wooden doors. The kind of place that whispers of history, of lives once lived within its walls. I ran my fingers along the wooden railings, feeling the smooth polish that had dulled over time. The air inside was stale, like a house that had been sealed too long, but I figured a few open windows would fix that. But even with the windows wide open, there was a certain stillness to the air, as if it was holding its breath, waiting for something to stir it into motion.

There was something about it—something still, almost like the house was waiting for something. Or someone. The walls seemed to lean in ever so slightly, their presence pressing against me in ways I couldn't quite explain. I remember standing in the living room that first night, staring into the dimly lit hallway, the air heavy with silence. It felt like I had interrupted something, like I had walked into a room where a conversation had just ended, the silence thick with expectation. The chandelier overhead barely swayed, yet I could have sworn I heard the faintest tinkling of glass, as if something unseen had brushed against it.

I listened, my breath held, straining to pick up the source of the disturbance. The sound was faint, barely audible—a whisper of movement, like fabric shifting against fabric. I turned, expecting to see something, anything, but the room remained empty. Still, the sensation of being watched lingered. My skin prickled, a cold sensation spreading across my back. The air felt thick, almost weighted, as though something unseen was pressing down on the very atmosphere of the house.

As the night wore on, the sensation deepened. It was not merely the feeling of an old house settling, nor was it the paranoia of being in a new space. No, this was something else. Something intentional. The walls seemed to absorb sound, muffling even my own footsteps. I could hear my own heartbeat, steady but a touch too fast. Every time I moved, I felt as though I was not alone, as though the very walls were listening.

It was in that moment, standing there in the eerie quiet of my new home, that I realized something peculiar. The house did not simply feel abandoned. It felt expectant.

I listened for a while, standing completely still, trying to pick up on whatever presence I felt was looming just beyond the edges of my perception. I strained my ears, expecting—what? A whisper? A sigh? The faintest shuffle of unseen footsteps? But there was nothing. Only the oppressive quiet. The shadows in the corners seemed just a little too dark, just a little too thick, but I shook the thought away.

I chalked it up to new-house jitters and exhaustion. The house was unfamiliar; it would take time to settle into it, I told myself. But I couldn’t shake the lingering feeling that I was being watched. And not just watched—studied, examined, as though something unseen was trying to understand me, trying to decide if I truly belonged.

At first, nothing seemed out of the ordinary. Days passed in quiet solitude, the house slowly growing familiar, its corners and crevices becoming part of my routine. I spent my time unpacking, trying to make the space feel like my own. I filled the shelves with my books, hung paintings on the walls, and rearranged furniture to my liking. Yet, no matter how many personal touches I added, the house never quite felt like mine. It was as if it refused to accept me as its new owner. It felt empty, but not in the way an unoccupied home feels—it was an unnatural emptiness, one that suggested something had been removed, leaving behind an unsettling absence.

As the days stretched into weeks, I found myself growing more uneasy, though I couldn’t pinpoint why. The silence of the house was too deep, too complete. There were moments I would be reading, working, or simply existing in a room, and I would become acutely aware that something was missing. It wasn’t just an absence of sound, but an absence of presence—like the space around me wasn’t as lifeless as it should have been, like it was waiting for something.

At first, the little things were easy to ignore. The occasional creak from the floorboards, the flickering of the hallway light, the way the walls seemed to groan late at night. Old houses settle, or so people say. But the more time I spent there, the harder it became to dismiss the peculiarities. The draft in the hallway was persistent, never fading no matter how high I turned up the heat. The scent of dust and something faintly metallic lingered in the air. At times, the rooms seemed darker than they should have been, as though the shadows clung just a little too long to the edges of the walls, stretching in ways that didn’t quite make sense.

I would catch movement in the corners of my vision, but when I turned my head, there was nothing there. It wasn’t just once or twice—it was frequent, unsettling. I started feeling reluctant to turn my back on open doorways. There were areas I began to avoid—particularly the hallway at night, where the air always felt heavier, thick with an unseen pressure, as if unseen eyes were watching from just beyond the reach of the dim light. Walking through it felt like moving through an unseen presence, something brushing against my skin without touching me.

Then came the noises—soft at first, but unmistakable. The faint sound of footsteps when I was the only one home. The hush of fabric against fabric, as if someone had shifted just out of sight. A quiet, almost imperceptible sigh, coming from an empty room.

It was then that I realized: I was not alone.

Then there were the objects. Small things, moving when I wasn’t looking. My phone, always on my nightstand, would be on the kitchen table in the morning. My keys moved from my bag to the front door. Once, I left a book open on my coffee table before going to bed, only to find it closed the next morning, placed neatly back on the shelf. Other times, the changes were subtler—my jacket would be draped over a chair instead of hung on the hook, a glass of water half-empty on the counter when I was sure I had never poured one. It wasn’t just a single incident. It kept happening, over and over, like something was shifting my world around me when I wasn’t looking.

At first, I tried to explain it away—I was distracted, I was tired, I had simply forgotten where I had placed them. But deep down, I knew. The uneasy feeling that something was watching me grew stronger each day, like unseen eyes following my every movement. The atmosphere in the house seemed different, heavier, the kind of weight that presses against your chest without explanation.

And then, there was the door.

The one I had never noticed before. The one that didn’t seem to belong.

It was in the hallway, positioned so naturally that it was easy to overlook. But once I saw it, I couldn’t unsee it. It wasn’t just that it looked out of place—it felt out of place, like something that had been forced into the world without belonging to it. The wood was a shade darker than the other doors in the house, its grain coarser, its handle colder to the touch than it should have been. It was locked, or so I thought.

At first, I ignored it, thinking my mind was playing tricks on me. Maybe I just hadn't paid close enough attention before. But something about it felt off—like it hadn't always been there, like it had slipped into existence when I wasn't looking. I traced my fingers along its edges, feeling the faintest resistance, as if it were pressing back against me. It gave me the distinct, uncomfortable impression that it was waiting for something—or someone—to open it.

I started checking the door every day. Sometimes, I swore it was slightly different. The handle felt looser, the wood seemed more worn, as if someone had touched it in my absence. Once, I noticed small smudges near the base, like something had brushed against it from the other side. My heartbeat quickened. Had it always been like that?

The longer I stared, the more convinced I became that the door wasn’t just locked—it was keeping something in. And whatever it was, it wanted out.

For days, I tried to convince myself I was imagining things. I passed by the door as quickly as I could, refusing to acknowledge its presence. But the more I ignored it, the more it seemed to demand my attention. The draft in the hallway grew colder, carrying with it a faint, musty scent that reminded me of damp earth and something metallic. At first, I thought it was just the changing season, the natural chill of an old house, but it was persistent. No amount of heating or insulation seemed to make a difference.

I started waking up in the middle of the night with a strange, gnawing anxiety, as if I had forgotten something crucial—something that lingered just outside my memory’s reach. My dreams became restless, filled with indistinct figures standing in doorways, whispering words I couldn't quite hear. Some nights, I awoke to the feeling of something unseen shifting in the room, a sensation of pressure, as though the air itself had thickened around me. I would sit up, breathless, scanning the darkness for movement, but nothing ever appeared.

And then there was the knocking—soft at first, rhythmic, as though someone were testing the barrier between us. It always came late at night, when the house was at its quietest, making it impossible to dismiss as mere house-settling noises. Some nights, the knocks would come in sets of three. Other times, they would stretch out in odd, uneven intervals, as if whoever—or whatever—was on the other side was growing impatient. The first time it happened, I convinced myself it was a trick of the wind, but when it continued—relentless, deliberate—I could no longer deny that something was trying to get my attention.

One evening, when I could no longer stand the unease gnawing at me, I pressed my ear against the wood. My heartbeat pounded in my ears, my breath shallow as I strained to hear something—anything—that might confirm my paranoia was unfounded. For a moment, there was nothing but silence. Then, just as I was about to pull away, I heard it: a breath, shallow and deliberate, just on the other side of the door. A slow, rattling inhale, followed by an even longer exhale. It was not the sound of wind, nor was it the sound of an old house settling. It was unmistakably human.

I stumbled backward, my pulse hammering in my ears. My rational mind fought to make sense of it, to dismiss it as fatigue, an auditory illusion born from paranoia. But another part of me—one that had been growing louder in recent weeks—knew better. There was something behind that door. And it knew I had been listening.

The next night, the knocking changed. It was no longer just a test—it was a demand. The knocks came louder, more insistent, shaking the door in its frame. I buried myself under the covers, clenching my fists, refusing to respond, refusing to give in to the panic clawing at my chest. Minutes passed, then hours. When I finally worked up the courage to glance at the door, I saw something that made my blood run cold.

The handle had turned. Just slightly. As if something had tried to open it, but had stopped, waiting. Waiting for me to make the first move.

The nights after that were worse. The shuffling turned into slow, deliberate pacing, like someone—something—was moving just outside my room, waiting. The murmuring became more distinct, the syllables forming patterns, hushed whispers that stopped whenever I strained to listen. Sometimes, it sounded like my name. Sometimes, it sounded like laughter—dry and distant, as though whatever was inside the door was amused by my fear.

I started locking my bedroom door at night, but that didn’t help. The pacing in the hallway grew louder, the murmurs turning into soft, scratchy words I couldn’t quite make out. The pressure in the air became suffocating, a weight pressing against my chest as I lay in bed, unable to move. The feeling of being watched became unbearable, the certainty that something was standing just beyond my door, waiting for me to acknowledge it.

One night, I awoke to the sensation of breath against my ear, my body frozen in place, my mind screaming at me to move, but I couldn’t. The breath was slow, deliberate, as though savoring the moment. My skin prickled, my pulse erratic as an unnatural silence fell over the room. And then, as if sensing my terror, the whisper came again, a slow, cruel repetition of words I couldn’t fully understand.

It wasn’t just outside my room anymore. It was closer.

The following nights were worse. I would wake up to the feeling of weight on my bed, the unmistakable sensation of pressure at my feet, as though something unseen was standing there, watching. My blankets would be tugged, just slightly, just enough to let me know I wasn’t alone. The whispering turned into guttural murmurs, foreign and distorted, shifting between tones and cadences, imitating voices that weren’t mine.

I stopped sleeping. I stopped turning off the lights. But none of it helped.

Then, one night, the door handle turned. The sound was unmistakable—a slow, deliberate click, followed by a pause, as though whatever was on the other side was waiting for me to react. I held my breath, my fingers digging into the mattress as I listened, praying it would stop.

It didn’t.

The handle twisted again, this time more forcefully. A sharp, insistent creak filled the room as the door cracked open a fraction of an inch, revealing nothing but a yawning black void beyond. A void that seemed to breathe, to shift in unnatural silence.

And then, a voice—low, rasping, unmistakably mine—whispered: "Let me in."

The door didn’t slam shut this time. It stayed open, just a sliver, enough for me to see the darkness beyond. Enough for whatever was lurking there to see me too.

I couldn’t move. My breath hitched, caught somewhere in my throat. The stillness of the room pressed in on me like a weight, suffocating and inescapable. The whisper had been barely audible, yet it rang through my mind, echoing in the recesses of my thoughts. The shadows at the door seemed thicker, more tangible, as if something were standing just beyond, watching. Waiting.

A slow, deliberate creak filled the silence as the door moved—just slightly, just enough to widen the sliver of darkness. My body tensed as a shape shifted in the void, no more than a silhouette. The air grew frigid, biting against my skin, and I swore I could hear breathing—slow, measured, just beyond the threshold.

Then, the whisper changed. It elongated, the syllables stretching unnaturally, the voice no longer quite mine. It was distorted, inhuman, layered—multiple voices speaking at once, all whispering the same demand: "Let me in."

The shadows rippled, shifting in unnatural ways. The door creaked wider, inch by inch, the darkness expanding beyond its frame as if the void itself were bleeding into the room. I tried to force myself to move, to shut my eyes, but I couldn’t. My limbs refused to obey, my body frozen under an invisible force that pressed against my chest, suffocating.

The breathing grew louder. It wasn’t just beyond the door anymore. It was in the room.

A sudden burst of wind sent the curtains billowing, though the windows were closed. My breath caught as I realized the shadows on the floor weren’t cast by the dim glow of the hallway light. They were moving, stretching toward me. The air was filled with a low, rattling sound—like a sigh, or laughter. My heartbeat thundered in my ears, drowning out everything else.

Then, without warning, the door slammed shut.

The silence that followed was worse than the noise. My ears rang in the absence of sound. I sat there, paralyzed, staring at the door, waiting for it to move again. But it didn’t. The pressure in the room lifted, the air growing lighter. The overwhelming presence faded, retreating just beyond the threshold.

But I knew it wasn’t gone. It was waiting. And next time, it wouldn’t stop at just whispering..

I clenched my fists beneath the sheets, my knuckles white. My instincts screamed at me to run, to flee from whatever lurked in the hallway. But my body refused to respond. I was paralyzed, trapped in the grasp of something unseen but undeniably present.

Then, the whisper came again—softer this time, almost playful: "Let me in."

The voice scraped along the edges of my consciousness, sending icy tendrils of fear crawling up my spine. It wasn’t just mimicking my voice anymore. It had changed. Twisted. Warped into something else, something that no longer belonged to me.

The silence that followed was heavier than before, thick with an unseen presence. And then, just as suddenly as it had begun, the door creaked again—this time, closing. Not slamming, not forced, but deliberate, as if the thing beyond it was retreating, but not leaving.

By the time morning came, I convinced myself it had been a dream. A nightmare conjured by my exhaustion and paranoia. But when I opened my bedroom door, the air was thick with the scent of damp earth, heavier than before, as though the walls had been steeped in it overnight. The hallway was still and quiet, but I knew—deep down—I wasn’t alone.

A shiver coursed down my spine as I noticed something else—the floorboards just outside my room weren’t just scratched anymore. They were gouged. Deep, uneven grooves ran parallel to the door, as though something with long, clawed fingers had dragged itself closer, inch by inch, in the dark.

And at the threshold, just beneath my doorframe, was a single word scratched into the wood.

**MINE.**

A trail of faint smudges, like smeared dirt, led from the hallway back toward that door—the one I had tried so hard to ignore. The scratches didn’t just stop at my doorway. They veered toward the baseboards, as if something had pressed itself against the wall, listening, waiting. My heart pounded as I knelt, reaching out to touch one of the deeper grooves. The wood splintered beneath my fingertips, brittle, as if it had been rotting from the inside.

I knew then that ignoring it was no longer an option. Because whatever was behind that door wasn’t just waiting anymore.

It was getting closer.

And it wasn’t alone.

The air in my room had taken on a different quality—thicker, more oppressive, as if the very walls were pressing in on me. The space felt smaller at night, as though unseen forces were closing in, suffocating me beneath their silent weight. The very air seemed to pulse with a presence just beyond my comprehension. It was as though the house itself was holding its breath, waiting for something I could not see.

I found myself waking at odd hours, drenched in sweat, my sheets tangled around my limbs. My breathing came fast and shallow, my skin damp with unease. The shadows in the corners of my room seemed deeper, shifting ever so slightly when I looked at them too long. And the whispers—oh, the whispers. They had grown more persistent, no longer fading in and out but lingering, clinging to the silence like cobwebs. At first, they were just faint murmurs, like the wind sighing through old walls. But as the nights stretched on, they changed. They became clearer, forming syllables that skated along the edges of my consciousness, words just out of reach.

Some nights, I swore I could feel something standing at the foot of my bed, its presence cold and unmoving, a silent observer to my growing paranoia. I tried to tell myself it was nothing, that my imagination was running wild in the empty darkness. But the sensation of being watched never left me. I would close my eyes and still feel it there, waiting, patient, as though it knew I could sense it. It took everything in me not to pull the covers over my head and pretend that if I couldn't see it, it couldn't see me.

Then, one night, the whispers stopped. The silence should have been a relief, but it wasn’t. It was worse. It was absolute—an unnatural stillness that made my ears ring with the absence of sound. The air felt heavier than before, pressing down on me with suffocating weight. And in that silence, I knew.

It wasn’t just standing at the foot of my bed anymore.

It was closer.

Then, one night, I woke up to the sound of a distinct click.

The door—that door—was ajar.

A cold wave of terror crashed over me as I realized the handle was still slightly turned, as if a hand had just released it. The space beyond it was blacker than the hallway should have been, the shadows inside thicker, unnatural. There was something standing there, just barely visible in the sliver of darkness. Watching. Waiting. It was a shape, a silhouette, almost humanoid but wrong in its proportions—its head tilted too far, its limbs slightly too long. A deep, suffocating dread settled over me, pinning me to the mattress. I tried to move, to scream, but the air felt thick, my breath shallow and strained.

Then, it shifted. Just a fraction of an inch. Enough for me to see the gleam of something—teeth? No, not quite. A grin, stretching too wide, its edges curling unnaturally upward. My vision blurred as my heart pounded against my ribs, my pulse a deafening drumbeat in my ears.

The whisper came again, slithering through the darkness, its tone no longer a perfect mimic of mine. It had changed, distorted, hollow yet dripping with something—glee? Malice?

"Let me in."

The words echoed through my skull, filling every space within me, pressing against my thoughts like an invasive force. My body remained frozen, my breath trapped in my throat. I wanted to scream, to reach for my phone, to do anything but lie there paralyzed under the weight of its gaze. But I could do nothing except watch as the door creaked open a fraction wider, and the thing behind it pressed closer.

Then, as suddenly as it had come, it pulled back. The door slammed shut, rattling in its frame, and I gasped as the weight on my chest lifted. The silence that followed was deafening.

I knew then: it wasn’t going to stop. It wasn’t waiting anymore.

It was inside.

And then, in a voice that was almost mine, it whispered: "Let me in."

The sound was low, rasping, but unmistakably familiar. It was my own voice, warped, like a recording played back at the wrong speed. My stomach clenched as a cold sweat prickled down my spine. My hands gripped the blanket, but I dared not move. My mind screamed at me to close my eyes, to pretend I hadn't heard it.

The figure shifted slightly, as though leaning closer. A shadowed hand reached toward the doorframe, fingers long and tapering to a fine point. The air crackled with a presence I couldn't comprehend, something ancient and patient. It knew I was awake. It knew I could see it.

I shot up, heart hammering in my chest. The figure didn't move, but the whisper came again, this time closer, pressing against the walls of my mind: "Let me in."

A sudden rush of cold air swept through the room, making the curtains billow violently as if something had rushed past. My breath hitched, and I pressed myself against the headboard, my pulse thundering. The door, still ajar, quivered slightly, as though something on the other side was testing its weight, pressing against it ever so slightly. The shadows beyond it shifted, a darkness that moved independently of the dim light in the hallway.

Then, slowly, the whispering grew louder, repeating the same three words over and over—"Let me in"—each repetition growing more distorted, more unnatural, until the voice wasn’t just mimicking mine anymore. It was something else entirely.

The whisper turned into a slow, grating chuckle. Then, footsteps—soft at first, dragging against the floorboards. I knew the layout of my house, and yet the footsteps didn’t follow a logical path. They circled, stopped, started again, moving closer and then farther away as if deliberately trying to confuse me.

The pressure in the room was unbearable. The air thickened, like trying to breathe underwater. I gasped, gripping the blankets as my vision blurred. My ears rang. And then, as suddenly as it had started, the sound stopped. Everything was silent, save for the pounding of my own heartbeat.

I hadn’t touched the door. I was sure I hadn’t. But there it was, open just enough to reveal an ink-black void beyond. My skin crawled as I watched it, waiting, breath held, unable to move. The darkness inside seemed to pulse, almost beckoning. The laughter, distant now, echoed through my head.

Then, slowly, the door creaked back into place, shutting itself with an unnatural finality, as if it had never been open at all.

After that, I couldn't pretend anymore.

Because I just heard it whisper my name.

And this time, it wasn’t just whispering. It was laughing. And it wasn’t alone.
