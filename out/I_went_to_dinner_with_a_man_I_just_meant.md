So, I grew up in a fairly small town. The kind where everyone knows everyone, there’s only small local shops (no Walmarts), and newcomers are pretty rare. That should have been the first red flag when I saw him...

I’ve been in this town basically since birth, as have most of the 100ish kids in our small pre-k to 12^(th) grade school. Since reaching adolescence I had begun to get quite bored. By the time I was 17 I had made up my mind that I was moving out. My grandfather's death was a clear sign that it was time to leave. I packed up my few important belongings and said goodbye to my parents and friends, before getting in a taxi headed towards my new home.

It was in a city smaller than most, but still a huge difference in size compared to where I come from. It was just over an hour away. I was surprised when the taxi driver asked if another person could share my ride. He said we could split the fee, so of course I was eager to accept. As I waited for this person, I made bets in my mind about who it could be. Probably Mrs. Marsh’s husband going on a business trip. It must have been 10 minutes before this... man? Angel? Joined me in the old sedan. He was the most beautiful being I had ever seen. His welcoming golden eyes were coated with thick black eyelashes, and his plump lips placed above a strong jawline. Long black tufts of hair met even longer blonde highlights. He was just so beautiful, it seemed unnatural.

“Sorry.” rang out a deep voice bringing me back to reality. “I’ll pay the total for holding you up.”

“O-oh… It's really no problem!” The words clumsily left my mouth.

While making eye contact with me, he handed the driver the sum. “Thanks.” I say while blushing. I know it sounds cliché but trust me- you would be blushing too if you could picture his perfect appearance. “So, where are you coming from?” I asked. When he responded with the town I had just left, I felt a surge of danger… But I ignored it. “Oh. I’ve been there my whole life, and I’ve never seen you before.”

“I’m sure you have. But I’m mostly in the woods so that could be why.” *Is he trying to gaslight me? I’m quite sure I have NOT seen him!*

“In the woods? What for?”

“Hunting, camping, all that stuff.” He then coughed. It almost sounded like a muffled word, but I dismissed it as me being paranoid- a usual occurrence.

The rest of the ride passed with little conversation. Eventually we reached my destination. When I got out, so did he. “You’re staying here too?” He nodded with an excited smile.

Then he said something that completely changed my mood. Instead of being hesitant, I was practically in love. So obviously I accepted when he said: "You're beautiful... would you go to dinner with me tonight?"

The tone of his voice had me. I told him to wait in the hotel lobby while I carried my stuff to my temporary room (I hadn't yet found a long-term place to stay in case I hated this living on my own thing). I rushed out of the elevator and chucked my things in the room, and when I returned, he was standing as peacefully as when I had left.

"Do you have any idea of where you would like to eat?" he asked kindly.

"No, I haven't really researched this place very much."

"Fair", he chuckled.

He waved down another taxi and he opened the door for me. I noticed he was especially cold compared to the warm evening as I brushed against him. He plopped beside me while reading directions off a notepad. "Are you sure?" the driver asked. This man responded with a stern look before smiling and saying 'Yes' gently.

"Where did you get those notes from?" I asked.

"Oh, I wrote them while you were putting your things away. By the way, I haven't got your name- I suppose that is a proper thing to ask?"

It was an awfully lot to write in that short time I was gone, or at least I thought I had been quick. I proceeded to tell him my name and I learned that he was Mathew. For the next 20 minutes there was awkward small talk, until we abruptly stopped at an empty gas station style 'restaurant'. It didn't even look open, but when he led me inside I was proven wrong. There was a pretty, petite cashier who doubled as the waitress who sat us at a booth. The dark red leather was worn and starting to peel off. We looked through the limited menu before placing our food and drink orders.

Mathew began a much-needed conversation. "What were your reasons for moving?"

"Well, as you know (my old town) is not very uneventful."

"True... Well, I hope I don't bore you. I think I could entertain you tonight," he smirked.

The rest of the conversation was normal, whatever that means, until it wasn't. He mentioned something that he shouldn't have known.

"I heard what happened to your grandfather. I can't believe a person could be sick enough to do that. I'm sorry, Lily."

"Thank you". I began tearing up at the mention of Gramps. I excused myself to the bathroom so I could fix the makeup streaming off my face. It wasn't until then that I processed what he said. How had he known? None of the information had been make public yet, and all my family knew so far was that it was a homicide. Then I realized I left my phone at our booth, so I prepared myself to get it and confront Mathew. The conversation went like this:

"You're back! I hope I didn't upset you."

I looked at the empty seat of the booth. "Where's my phone?"

"Hm, I'm not sure. Our food is here, if you haven't noticed. On me." He said it so flawlessly that if he was lying, I had no way of telling.

"Thanks" I croaked out with a fake smile. "So, how did you know?"

"How couldn't I know? It's obvious, aha."

"What do you mean?"

"You asked how I knew the food was here?"

"Mathew. You know what I mean."

He almost glared at me before tilting his head in a confused manner. "I'm afraid I don't, Lily. Could you clarify?"

"How did you know about my grandfather's death?"

"Doesn't everyone?" he said simply. "It's the talk of the town."

"Well duh, they know he died. But they don't know how. Most of them are convinced it was a heart attack."

He just stared at me for a moment. "My uncle was a part of the investigation team. I know things that you probably don't know yet. Sorry, I should have mentioned that. Why aren't you eating?"

Obviously, I developed a huge distrust towards him. I wasn't going to eat food that he had been left alone with. "I just don't feel like eating now. I'll pay for it though."

"I'm truly sorry for ruining your appetite. At least drink something?"

"Yeah... soon. I'm going to look for my phone first." I rushed to the bathroom in case I had just forgotten I brought it in. After not finding it I went to the cashier and asked if she could call for me. She made a quick glance to Mathew before telling me she couldn't, as the phone could only receive calls- not make them. Bullshit.

I returned to the table and asked Mathew some questions relating to the death. “What do you know that I don’t?”

“Well, the person who did it was quite smart. It was an intricate job, and h- they left no evidence behind. My uncle said he had never seen such an elaborate murder.”

“I see… that person seems so clever.” I tried to flatter him in hopes of a confession. At that point I didn’t need one. I was convinced that I was not at dinner with someone from my town, but a murderer who followed me. On top of that, the staff was in on it. The building was empty, I had no phone or defense, and I could be his next victim. Granddaughter like grandfather. In response to my flattery, he smiled.

“Quite so… I agree. Have a drink, will you? I hate seeing such a lovely lady so sad.”

“You know, I’m not in the mood for this kind of drink. How about some water?”

“Oh… yeah. Of course.” The way he said it was almost sarcastic.

“While I’m waiting, I’m going to continue the search for my phone. I’ll be rich back.” I replied with the nicest smile I could. I knew he had my phone, so I didn’t bother to look for it. What I was looking for was an escape. I peered into the kitchen which was out of Mathew’s view. There was a different person cooking. I observed him to see if he too was aware of my situation.

*Go*. He mouthed to me. *Where?* I mouthed back. He pointed somewhere to the left of him, and I walked over to him. I knew this could easily be a trap, but what choice did I have? In either case, I’m dead.

“I can’t have this happen to you. He’s gonna kill me, but it’s better than you. Through that door, run and don’t look back.” He whispered.

Immediately I took my chance and started running. I did not look back until I reached a populated area. There were a lot of people considering it was 10. I found a girl around my age and begged her to take me to the police. She was shocked, but instantly agreed. When I got to the station they sent an entire team over, but it was empty. It had been shut down since the beginning of the Covid pandemic, and there was no evidence of anyone having been there except: warm oil in the fryer, my phone on Mathew’s side of the booth, and a small bloodstain in the doorway of the kitchen. The cook wasn’t joking. I feel immense guilt for letting him die… he sacrificed himself for me. It’s just so unfair.

A pair of policemen personally took me home and questioned the men stationed in my town. None of them had a nephew named Mathew, and it’s very likely that it was a fake name. I gave the best descriptions I could, but no one was identified.

I can’t imagine what would have happened to me if that cook hadn’t let me go. I’m very lucky to be here writing this. That has to be the most horrifying encounter in my life
