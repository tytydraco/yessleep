If anyone back home ever reads this, just know we did all we could. This planet is… well, it’s something else. 

For posterity, I should probably recount everything that’s unfolded over the past couple of days. I think at least. I’m honestly not even sure anymore thanks to the day/night cycle here. Hell, it’s not even a cycle. Day is practically nonexistent, we just get dim light reflected off the twin moons up above. It’s like an ever-present state of dusk. 

We were flying by the Pillars of Creation, an exploration mission hoping to find habitable worlds somewhere out there beyond our own. It’s beautiful out here, but we haven’t had much look with the habitable worlds part. Mostly just a lot of stars everywhere, the occasional small moon that was a rock of dust and ice. Nothing we could live on, though. Nevertheless, the five of us soldiered on. Myself, Vitale, Parsons, Jacoby, and Milledge, floating through space in search of a new world.

Looking back it feels like this planet was… waiting for us. Like an ambush, almost. It was nowhere on the radars, not on any kind of existing star charts, but suddenly as were flying at insane speeds through space it just appeared. It makes no damn sense, but suddenly there’s an asteroid belt surrounding us, this massive planet off to our port side, and debris hitting the hull of the ship. We lost it, started spinning out with next to no control.

I woke up to find the others still passed out in the bridge, all of us hastily strapped into our seats. Somehow, by the grace of whatever god was looking out for us, we were all alive. Honestly, at this point I’m convinced we all died on impact and we’re really just in some form of hell but… it seems like an even more ridiculous thought than what we’ve seen.

It took a couple of hours to get out and sift through the wreckage of our ship, though there wasn’t a whole lot we were able to salvage. Our pressurized suits weren’t damaged, and the oxygen recyclers on them were in good shape. That would last us at least a week. Food supplies were more abundant, so we packed up whatever we could. 

While Parsons and Jacoby loaded up supplies, the rest of us went out to get bearings on where we were. Darkness was about all we got, visibility limited in almost every direction. The ship was split in two right down the middle, cargo hold and crew quarters separated out from the bridge, engine, and cockpit that made up the fore. With some work, we figured out we could still get power through from the main systems, using one of the cargo rooms as basically an airlock so we could still use the living quarters. Not the worst outcome, all things considered.

Getting into the living quarters meant that we were able to access some of our research gear though, and that’s the only reason we’ve lasted this long. I found a set of night vision binoculars for land surveying and climbed up to the top of the ship for a view.

Giant rock formations were off directly ahead of the ship, huge, curved, jagged rocks jutting off into the sky in rows. They look like a giant rib cage sticking up out of the sand, the corpse of something that lived here long ago. That’s just speculation on my part though, and a lot of fear for what may be waiting for us.

The strangest thing though… there’s a forest. About fifty clicks to the starboard side of the ship, straight off into the distance, are a ton of trees. Massive, from the looks of it. Reminds me of the huge trees in Jurassic Park, and I half expected to see a Dino knocking them down as it went along its way. Dinosaurs would probably be too good of a discovery for us at this point.

We put a pin in the forest for now, choosing instead to work on getting our bearings where we were. Hours had passed at this point, so we all piled into the crew quarters and sealed it up, hoping to get some kind of rest and fill our bellies. Despite the bleakness of our situation, we were hopeful. A distress signal was on its way back to Earth, we had food so we wouldn’t starve, and the oxygen cycler was still working so we had a little bit of light in the darkness, no impending doom.

We were all asleep in our bunks when the first sounds began. I thought it was wind at first, just a really strong storm of gusts running across the barren tundra we were situated on. I could hear dust skittering across the hull outside, trying to find a way in through any unsealed cracks in the metal. 

Parsons woke up around the same time, looking over at me with the same questions I had, though it’s not like either of us had any kind of answers. All we could do was try to tune it out and get some actual sleep, but it was fitful. I couldn’t help but feel like something out there was trying to get inside, cracking the ship open like a damned shellfish to get at the meat hiding within.

It kept going for hours. Even looking out the window, I couldn’t tell what the hell was going on. Just that permanent state of dusk outside, sand and loose rocks occasionally flying by the glass. The remains of the ship started to creak and moan under the pressure of the wind, sounding like they would fall apart at any moment. Finally though, just when I thought I was going to lose my damn mind, it stopped. I was finally able to get some real sleep. Too bad it was interrupted. 

Vitale woke us all up, screaming about something incomprehensible. By the time we were able to get her to calm down she was babbling about how something needed to be let out, that it was waiting. For us. 

It took nearly an hour to get her to chill the hell out. Not that we could get any clear answers from her after that, either. She just went quiet, nearly catatonic. The rest of us eventually had to get on with what we were doing and try to make ship repairs.

Parsons and I put on our habitat suits, exiting the makeshift airlock and setting up a few lights around the wreckage to see what we were doing. The big problem came when we realized the internal seal was cracked, right between the cockpit area and where it should snap back on near the cargo hold. Without that, the vacuum of space would just rip us right out of the can as soon as we got up there.

Didn’t have too long to ruminate on what that meant thougH. Parsons was tapping me on the shoulder, barely giving a whisper as he tried to get my attention. I sat down my welding torch, looking back to find that our lights had attracted something to us.

It was dark beyond the small circle of light we had set up, but something was out there moving, stalking us from the dense black beyond. For a brief moment, I swear I saw eyes flaming in the darkness, sizing us up for a meal.

I hesitated for a moment, weighing the options and considering that I may just be going crazy from crashing on a desolate planet. But… the other side of me thought about the real implications- there’s life here. Not only life, but something intelligent. The realization hit me like a brick damn wall next though, the revelation that we’re not the top of the food chain out here. We might be near the bottom.

The two of us hauled ass back toward the airlock, desperately banging on the door for those inside to open up. I could hear it behind us, waiting just on the edge of the light. I think that’s the only thing that kept it from diving right at us, ripping our throats out with whatever gnarled teeth were hidden in the dark. Probably wasn’t used to this amount of light…

Felt like we were banging on that airlock forever before Milledge finally opened the door. Just in time too, because the thing out there finally decided to chance it, making a huge leap forward just as we fell through the door. 

If that’s the extent of it we would’ve been lucky. Parsons was too slow though. As he went through, the thing clamped down on his leg, dragging him backward. He held onto the doorway, begging me for help as I collapsed to the floor, desperately trying to gather any nerve I could to offer him a hand. I finally got it, diving forward, grabbing his arm and trying to haul him back, bring him into the safety of the ship wreckage. 

Whatever had him, it didn’t let up. Instead I heard a crunch as it bit down harder on Parsons’ leg, jerking him backwards more forcefully. I tried, I really did but… it was too much. My grasp on his arm slipped for just the second that thing needed and he was gone, screaming into the night. The door closed as Milledge pressed the button inside, depressurizing the airlock and opening it from his end.

Swear I could hear bones crunching from outside as it chowed down on Parsons. His screams didn’t last for long, so I’m hoping he didn’t have to feel the worst of it…

Vitale… started saying a lot of weird shit when I got back in. Said that thing was sent to punish us, motivate us to get moving. Kept going on about how we had a duty to something greater than ourselves being here. I honestly don’t know if she’s started legitimately going insane or had some kind of brain trauma from the crash. It’s… eerie though, to say the least. 

Her last warning was only a couple of hours ago and.. it doesn’t bode well. She says that it’s “enemies” are going to try to kill us. 

”So what do we do?” I ask, looking at Milledge and Jacoby, trying to come up with some sort of answer. I’ve been hearing noises from outside since her last warning. It’s like… whistles and hisses, something conversing with others in the darkness in a language that’s primordial to human tongues. I don’t know what they’re saying to each other but… I know it’s not good for us. At all.

Milledge shrugged at me. Jacoby looked almost dead in the dim light of the crew quarters, just staring straight ahead.

”I had some kind of hope we were gonna go home but…” He sighed, “I don’t know man. I think we’re fucked in here.”

”Can’t just give up like that though.” Milledge offered back.

”We have to go.” Vitale spoke again. “That’s what it told me we had to do.”

”It told you? I’m sorry, who the fuck is ‘it’?” Jacoby was almost yelling at her in anger. She shrunk back, staring hard at him in defiance.

”God.” She whispered.

”She’s lost her damn mind…” Milledge muttered. 

I stopped listening to them when I felt it. A deep rumbling that was barely shaking the wreckage we were in at first, but it started gathering steam. They quit their bickering after a moment, pausing to notice as it began to rattle portions of the crew quarters, making the entire structure shake like the planet itself was quaking underneath us. It kept out, rhythmic, growing more intense with every beat until all of a sudden… nothing.

Didn’t realize I was holding my breath until it was knocked out of me with the force of being hit by a truck. One second I’m looking at the others, the next second we’re all upside down, tumbling through empty space as the ship spins around us. Landing hurt like hell, getting thrown against a metal cabinet face first and briefly knocked out, but once everything stopped spinning we had a whole new problem to deal with.

The window nearby broke in the chaos, a gaping hole in the place of the formerly thick glass. I held my breath again, desperately trying to get up, making my way toward the hab suit kept near the airlocks. I made it two steps before something tore the roof off the remains of the ship, exposing all of us to the darkness outside. 

I could see what did it in the faint glow of our emergency lights. It was huge, towering above the wrecked remains of our ship. Pale, waxy white skin looked like it was ready to slough off the bone at any moment, bulbous red eyes in clusters on top of its head looking down at us. There was burning in its eyes, like a small flame was kindled somewhere in the back of the skull, showing through hundreds of bright, red windows to the outside. Looking at it felt like touching madness, and to hold onto my sanity I looked away, a scream wrenching itself from my gut and through the air.

Off instinct I took a deep breath in and my lungs stopped shrieking in agony for a moment. I don’t know why I didn’t put it together until now, but if there was a forest off in the distance, it’s not entirely impossible there might be oxygen here. My fear of whatever the hell was going on was briefly eclipsed by elation that we had, in fact, discovered a habitable planet. Then my fear came roaring back in as this thing reached down a pale, bony hand, seven long fingers unfurled, spikes inside the knuckles glistening as it grasped at Milledge on the ground, grabbing him up and lifting high.

I sat in stunned silence, watching as it hoisted Milledge above its head, curling in the long fingers and squeezing. I heard his bones crack as the creature tightened its grip, suffocating him and crushing any internal organs that may have still been standing. The interior spikes did their jobs, puncturing him and cutting his screams off like a balloon losing air as blood began to pour down, drenching the creature as it opened a long, vertical mouth full of teeth to drink the life force down.

”Run!” I shouted at Vitale and Jacoby, taking our chance as the thing was already busy devouring our former crew mate. We took off, leaving the dim lights of the wreckage behind and taking off, nothing in hand, towards the forested area. 

We ran, not stopping for a moment to look back and see if we were being followed, just assuming that if we did hesitate it would grab us and squeeze just like it did to Milledge. After some time we eventually slowed, beginning to run out of steam despite the hospitable conditions of the planet. Maybe it was the fact I’ve been running on stored oxygen for so long, but I think the atmosphere here might be more dense with it than our own. I felt more energized, like everything was… clearer. Then again, maybe it’s the adrenaline from seeing that fucking nightmare back there.

For hours on hours we walked. Vitale didn’t speak of her dreams anymore, and Jacoby and I just… well, there wasn’t much to say with everything going on. So we just walked. And walked… and kept on walking. My feet were bleeding in my boots by the time we hit the forest, but we weren’t going to risk stopping and having another one of these things come after us. Instead, we just stumbled alone, keeping our aches and pains quiet out of some misguided belief we could still survive all of this. 

Not going to lie, despite the fear that was driving me forward I really wanted to stop and get a good look at what these trees were. No way they could be native species from Earth, of course, but were they similar in any way? The branches I brushed past almost felt like they had pine needles on them, but they were softer to the touch, and thicker than the average pine needle. I didn’t stop to really get an idea of them though, instead opting to keep moving, pressing forward through the darkness of the forest.

”Any idea where we’re supposed to go?” I asked, speaking to nobody in particular.

”The city will be through here.” Vitale mentioned. Jacoby stopped in his tracks then.

”Okay, you need to start telling us what the hell you know. Now, for fucks sake.” He shouted at her.

”Dude, chill out for a second. Don’t take this out on her.” I said.

”No, she’s been saying cryptic shit since we first got here and I’m tired of it! It’s like a bad fuckin’ horror movie, man! Where’s she pulling this from?” He was starting to shout now.

”I don’t know, it talks to me!”  She shouted back.

”What!? WHAT THE HELL IS TALKING TO YOU OUT HERE?!” He was screaming.

”I DON’T KNOW!” She screams back.

A rustling in the trees cuts their conversation short. We all go quiet, waiting to hear what the hell this place has in store for us next, but are only met with silence.

“We need to keep moving.” I mutter. The others agree, though they’re not happy about it. We get a move on, proceeding on the same path through the forest, trying not to walk in circles as best as we can.

“So what the hell are we supposed to do when we get to this city?” Jacoby asks, shooting a dirty look at Vitale through the thick darkness.

“Wish I knew. I think it wants us to free it but… I don’t know what the hell it needs to be freed from.” She shrugged back. “I didn’t choose this, man. I fell asleep after we got here and suddenly this thing is just… I don’t know, in my dreams. It feels like my mind is being totally overloaded.”

Jacoby doesn’t say anything as he trails behind both of us. Me in the lead, Vitale in the middle. 

“Sorry…” He eventually mutters.

“All good. We’re all stressed, we just want to get out of here.” I said, trying to keep some sense of morale going.

Breaks in the trees gave way to a beautiful sight above us. The sky was full of stars, all from another galaxy invisible to the naked eye back on Earth. The Pillars of Creation were huge in the sky, glorious blues, pinks, greens… so many colors coalescing into something bigger than themselves. We all ended up stopping for a moment just to gaze in wonder at our own insignificance. At least if we don’t make it out, I got a once in a lifetime experience I guess.

The silent awe was broken by rustling in the trees, something coming to the edge of the clearing we were in to watch us. Through the darkness I strained my eyes, hoping to see whatever the hell was stalking us. I knelt down, trying to find a stick, a rock, anything that could help defend us against what may be waiting to pounce at any moment.

I was running blind though, feeling over the ground with only the slightest hope that I would find something that could work.  A rock came into my grasp, and with a little digging to get it from the dirt below, I was able to heft it beside me. Whatever was watching us must have sensed my intention though, a guttural hiss coming through the trees. Made me think of Jurassic Park again hearing it, the guttural sounds of a raptor or something stalking prey in the darkness. 

God, I wish it had been a fucking dinosaur. The… thing walked into the clearing then, squaring up to the challenge. Through the dim light, I was finally able to get a look at it.

Tall. That was the first thing I clocked. This thing was standing on three feet… no, two. There was a long tail resting on the ground behind it, giving the appearance of something greater. It was at least nine feet though, towering over all of us as it stared us down. The same pale, waxy skin as that bigger one that destroyed the ship wreckage, with red eyes dotting the skull all over, giving it sight in what I assume was nearly 360 degrees of visibility. Two long, spindly arms were raised in front of it, long fingers covered in jagged spikes that were made for tearing flesh straight from bone. The mouth… it was more like a beak, jagged and sharp but with no teeth behind it. Instead it opened up to make another noise and I could see a barbed tongue inside, unfurling like a damned whip ready to crack at us. 

Another guttural hiss and it did just that, the tongue actually making a crack sound as it lashed out, hitting Jacoby on the neck. It only took seconds for the blood to start pouring from where it struck, painting the ground crimson in the darkness. He fell to the ground, clutching at the wound, desperate to make the bleeding stop but to no avail.

Jacoby was a lost cause. I clocked that immediately. I… I feel guilt for leaving him behind but it was survival. I had to keep moving. As he clutched his throat, on his knees in the dirt of the clearing, I pushed Vitale forward, moving her along the path we were on to reach the other side of the forest. It’s the only way I knew to get the hell out of here, the only way to live just a little bit longer. God… I want to live. I don’t want to die here on this fucking planet full of terrors.

His scream came out garbled as the thing jumped on him, grabbing him with those long, spiked fingers and tearing at his skin with its beak. His screams didn’t end as we pushed through foliage, desperately hoping to find an end to the trees and whatever this city was that we were looking for. Finally, we made it far enough that we couldn’t hear the gurgling of his cries anymore, or the hissing of the thing as it drank his blood. The last image I saw through the trees was it wrapping that long, whiplike tongue around him, using it to constrict his body as it lapped up his blood straight from the source.

Run. Just… keep running. Dear god, keep running. It was still back there, waiting to devour us the moment we slowed down. God forbid there be more than one of them back there, just biding their time until we stopped moving so it could have a nice meal of its own…

There was a faint light coming from ahead, through the tree line. A bright blue glow like nothing I had seen. Almost neon in the intensity, it was beckoning us towards it, out of the forest, into what I could only pray was some kind of safety.

As we broke the tree line it became visible in full glory. There was a cliff in front of us, a river flowing over the side and continuing down below, leading to a huge, glowing blue cluster of spires only a few miles away. It was beautiful, like a rock quarry of nothing but the most brilliant diamonds and sapphires, giving us a beacon in the dark [world](https://www.reddit.com/u/googlyeyes93/s/PDOdYTDp23).
