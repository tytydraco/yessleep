The man cannot see me. He doesn't know I'm there.

The man is nervous. I can see the whites in his eyes as he tightens his tie. Today must be a big day at the job for him. The man is hard on himself. There is a certain type of sweat that smells of contempt. When he leaves for work I can scent it on the collar of his unwashed dress shirts. Cotton blend, poplin weave. I can tell the only thing he fears more than being alone is womankind.

There is a cupboard atop the fridge that extends beyond the escarpment of the wall. I'm not quite sure how I got here, but I know I'm meant to stay. I can peer through cracks so tiny, I can see every inch of the intimate studio apartment. The man is a renter. I know this because last month, he smashed a lamp after a tense conversation with the landlady. His hand was cut and I saw the roaches in the baseboards taste the air for blood with their gossamer antennae.

The man is now gone for the day. I never leave the cupboard right away. Always wait. Always wait. Can't be too safe. But when it is time, I pull back the false wall and hoist myself down atop the fridge. Catching myself in the mirror, my god I am pale. I am lightheaded. It is cramped in the wall. I step down on to the kitchen countertop and a scab on my arm catches the lip of the door. It falls to the floor. Can't leave any trace. I pick it up to my mouth and I feel it fold between my teeth. Somewhere the roaches twitch with jealousy.

It has been a long while of this and I am a master of consuming only a little each day. This way I go unnoticed. I fill my bottle with water and empty my bedpan in the sink. Inside the fridge, two boxes of leftover pizza, a 6 pack of soda. The edges of the cheese will not be missed. I tempt fate with a piece of ham, and crush the pocket it left behind with my thumb to conceal its missingness.

I'm itchy. I think it's the humidity. The silver showerhead is creased in rust and whines a bit when in use. The water cannot run hot; only tepid. I need to make it quick, I don't like being down in the apartment for more than a few minutes at a time. The water runs over my skin and my eyes focus on the peeling wallpaper across the room. I dry off with the man's still wet towel.

Now it is time for my sleep. Back in the cupboard I go, the false wall in place. 

I am awakened at sundown by the incompetent rattling of keys, forking and scraping the keyhole under muttered swearing. The man has returned. The door opens and through pours his plump mass, and I notice something unusual: a red suitcase with gold flecked filigree, compressed under his oafish arm. He closes the door quickly and fastens the deadbolt, grabs the wooden plank beside the door and places it across the bar brackets. The man is sweating. He looks through the peephole while untightening his soaked tie, unbuttons his shirt at the collar, turns his back to the door, and sinks to the floor. I watch with the insects from the cracks with shared curiosity. Finally some action beyond survival.

After a moment to catch his breath, the man pulls the suitcase to his lap. My face is pressed against the wood. I cannot help myself. His anxiety paints the air in thick strokes. Whatever is in there, it must be good. Oooh. Clack clack. He flicks open the latches with his thumbs. Ahhh. His fat fingers open the lid. They are shaking. I can't fucking see what's inside. I need a different angle. I NEED A DIFFERENT ANGLE. And clap. He shuts the lid. He sighs, his breath shaky. My breath is shaky too. I need to know what's inside.

It is dark now. The man drearily watches a hissing tube television. When he finally nods off I take my chance. Quietly, quietly. Like a spider I descend in to the dark of the apartment. The man's night terrors and rustling do not deter me in the slightest. I must know what is inside the case.

The hissing of the tube conceals the clack clack of the latches. Before my eyes, the faint glimmer of metal. The machine in front of me is pristine, like a newborn against the molding walls of the apartment. It hums from inside my head. I run my hands against its perfect form. In the moment we touch I feel the presence of an eternity of deepness, an infinity of rotten apartments all overlapping until there is no more rot and finally no more apartments and lastly no more of the man and just me forever in hopeless bliss folding in half again and quartered forever as the eye of all origin watches jaded and disinterested and i- i-

I do not know how I got here, but I know I am meant to stay. I am back in my cupboard and the small metal machine hums bloodlessly against my chest. It gives off no warmth save from that which it generates inside me. I do not remember falling asleep, nor carrying it back in to my domain. What I do know, is that I will never part with it. 

"WHERE IS IT?"

The man is awake now. The man is in a blind rage. The man tears the apartment asunder and froths at the teeth like a wolf popping its mangy jaws. Rotting wood shatters off in great flakes as table and chair are tossed in biblical frustration. "WHERE IS IT." 

he screams and pounds. "WHERE IS IT." 

After a while he cowers in the corner by the door, gently rocking back and forth, eyes white and rolling in his greasy head. 

The machine is scintillating. The world was off balance, desperately tilted and dizzy, until the day I held it. It is proud of me for hiding it from the man. I lean back in my cupboard and close my eyes. The man will leave for work soon, and then I can feed.

ssshhhhhhhh. What? I'm awake and the machine speaks. It hums in my brain. shhhhh.

The man is awake. He is standing in the middle of the apartment, staring at the ceiling.

shhh. The machine is warning me. Hold your breath.

I do.

The man pulls a chair out of the rubble on the ground, and sits on it. In the middle of the room.

On the first day of this I feel somewhat sad for him. He seems listless, zombified. 

The machine hums.

On the second day, I begin to worry. He barely moves. Staring. Twitching. I cannot leave.

The machine hums.

On the third day, my hunger starts to become unbearable. He sits. Staring. Every so often he gets up to eat from a block of cheese. Sliced thick with his pocket knife between his thumb and pointer.

The machine hums.

On the fourth day I run out of water. 

The machine whirrs.

On the fifth day the walls start closing in. I find myself pressing my lips against the cracks in the cabinet, suckling at the rotten air of the apartment, at freedom.

The machine cackles.

On the sixth day, darkness. Did the electricity cut out?

The machine exists beyond all comprehension. It is flora and fauna and cosmos and cabinet. It is mother and father and female and male and child and the man and bigger, bigger still- it is taller and more grand and crawlingly wretched and featherbound, holier than any founder in the devilry of grey matter that makes the unconscious conscious. I find myself drawn and quartered in blissful vivisection as I starve and dehydrate and it simply is, in a word, and is not, in another.

On the seventh day, the man can see me. 

In the desperate darkness my dry eyes adjust and fix directly upon his. Sweating through his shirt. Staring right at me. Picking at his fingers. Eye to eye through the crack of the cabinet. Chewing at his cheeks. Looking at me through bloodshot sparks in the damp gloam. Fixed right at me. I am frozen. The muscles in my shoulders want to press upon the walls and explode out. My legs want to run. Yet here I am, cornered and dilated like a stuck rat.

and THUMP. and CRACK. I feel the vicious splintering of wood against my skin. The man is angry. The man knows. Cheese knife in hand. Teeth in mouth. A lump of flesh and wretched digestion.

"GIVE IT BACK."

The machine whirrs, RUN. RUN. RUN. RUN. RUN.

CRACK. His rotten, blistered hands burst through the cabinet walls. Skin scabs and wall shrapnel. Putrid panting, breath sweet with moldering decay, yellow fingernails paw at the floor right next to my feet. 

The machine whirrs, LEAVE. ME. BEHIND. THIS. IS. TEMPORARY.

It is like prying the very fetus from my womb but I do as it requests as the man gains footing on the counter and raises up to me face to face. 

"GIVE IT BACK." He screams. 

"WHERE IS IT. GIVE IT BACK."

His massive grasp is around my throat. The texture of his skin like cockroach feet; clinging and prickling and scraping with a passion so intense I can barely find the strength to nudge the machine into a weak roll. It tumbles away, deeper in to the cupboard, billowing and undulating with an unmistakable sound and I can feel the man's breath hitch, his grip tighten, and then fully release. 

I am tossed aside, down past the countertop and on to the sullen apartment floor. The man clambers in to the cupboard after the machine, beyond the doors, beyond the false wall. My head aches. I look up to see him, and catch a final glimpse of his rotten boots pulling in to the darkness of my old home.

Across from me, still wedged in the brackets of front door- the wooden plank.

The machine hums.

Compelled by something far beyond me, with eyes of heavenly waters bending firmament horizons beyond comprehension, remote and indifferent yet sympathetic and dispassionate, the wooden plank soon found its purchase in my hands- in my hands, now up on the kitchen countertop, now up on the fridge, now... I wedge it solidly between the false wall and the cupboard frame.

The man cannot see me.

The man is trapped.

The man has stopped screaming.

The man will die soon.



And then, I can be with it again.
