>We see you.

Our universe is infinite. Or, that's what we say. It is finite, but infinitely expanding.

There is an end to the universe. We can't reach it, but everything points at a barrier at the very edge of it.

Matter can't be created. It transforms.

If so, what is the universe expanding into?

>We see you.

Once we confirmed we were alone in our universe, we didn't let dread take over us.

An anomaly, for sure. We were not the only living beings in Ordinary-1, but we were the only intelligent ones.

We found bacteria, animals, primitive beings.

Humanity came first. A blessing, or perhaps a curse, to be alone with our minds in the vast field of creation.

>We see you.

Before the revelation, we thought it was strange. If there were other civilizations, other inhabited galaxies, they should have been more advanced than us. We didn't think we'd be the primordial ones.

So many stories. So many theories. We found it strange to be the first ones to send messages. Some even warned us it would expose us to things we might not want to draw the attention of.

But we felt like gods, once we knew we were the first ones.

>We see you.

We forgot those warnings. Ignored them. We went through. Past the abyss.

Waiting for us was the multiverse. Other realities.

If Ordinary-1 was expanding, it meant it was changing something. Matter was being transformed into our universe. There was a threshold. And we could go through it. We had the technology.

We sent a beacon. We sent Elvis, photos of the Grand Canyon, of the Great Wall of China. We sent encyclopedias with the history of our race.

And we sent our coordinates.

>We see you.

They saw us, and we replied.

There was life. Intelligent, too. They deciphered our languages, replied in crude English, Chinese, Spanish and even Russian. They answered, and finally, we weren't alone in existence.

They had emotions. They understood radio waves, photography, even seemed to be slightly more advanced than us.

We asked the question that was burning in the back of our minds.

>Why now?

Why now? Why did they take so long to make themselves noticed? They were more advanced than us. They had the technology, they had the curiosity! Why didn't they send a beacon at us before?

>Scared. Abyss.

There was "distance" between Ordinary-1 and Ordinary-2. Metaphorical distance, given our measurement units were not accurate through the Abyss. But those words came through crystal clear.

>What scares you?

Decades had passed since the first contact, and Ordinary-2 was the only universe to give an answer.

Their next reply were instructions. For a machine. They didn't answer the question.

That was the last interaction between Ordinary-1 and Ordinary-2.

Humanity... Is bold. Too curious for its own sake.

We built the machine. It took us decades, but we built it.

We turned it on. It was similar to a radar. It emitted a loud, buzzing sound. Only some of us could hear it.

And, shortly after turning it on, the receiver turned to life.

>We see you.

>We see you.

>We see you.

>We see you.

Dozens, hundreds of messages.

All of them, closer than Ordinary-2.



We were bold.

We told everyone where we were.

Ordinary-2 tried to warn us.



Now, they saw us.
