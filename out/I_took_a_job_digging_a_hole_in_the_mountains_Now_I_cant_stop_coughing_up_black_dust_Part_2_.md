[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1pptvib/i_took_a_job_digging_a_hole_in_the_mountains_now/)

The day after Ray drowned in a tent surrounded by dust-dry earth, the camp went quiet. Not peaceful quiet. The kind of silence that sits on your chest like a weight. We worked because Buzz told us to work, hauling buckets of black dirt up from the hole in mechanical rotations that felt less like labor and more like ritual. Nobody joked anymore. Nobody even looked at each other.

But I couldn't stop looking at the shack.

It sat maybe fifty yards back in the tree line, half-collapsed and covered in decades of moss and rot. The graffiti symbols I'd noticed that first day seemed to pulse in my peripheral vision, like they were calling to me. Plato caught me staring at it during the afternoon shift.

"Stop that, man," he said quietly, not looking up from the rope he was coiling. "Your brain's just latching onto anything that isn't the hole. It's survival instinct."

"Then why are you staring at it too?"

He didn't answer.

That night I couldn't sleep. The symbols from the rock face burned behind my eyelids every time I closed my eyes, those sharp angles and inward-turning spirals that seemed to move when you looked at them too long. I tried to tell myself it was just stress, just exhaustion, just my mind trying to process Ray's impossible drowning in a place where water shouldn't exist.

But my legs carried me out of the tent anyway.

I slipped past the dying campfire and into the woods, phone light cutting a weak beam through the dark. The door hung crooked on one hinge.

Inside was worse.

The graffiti wasn't just on the walls anymore. It was carved into the floorboards, gouged into the support beams, scratched into the window frames with what looked like fingernails or broken tools. Layers upon layers of it, old paint over older carvings, some symbols so weathered they were barely visible. And among the spirals and angles were words in frantic, overlapping handwriting:

*the well is not for water*

*it dreams in the deep earth*

*the price is paid in silence*

*do not bring up the black stones*

My breath fogged despite the warm night air. Wrong. The temperature inside was wrong.

Tucked into a rotted windowsill, wrapped in cracked oilcloth, I found a journal. The pages were brittle, yellowed, covered in tight, paranoid script. I recognized the handwriting from some of the wall carvings. Someone had lived here. Watched the dig. Documented it.

The entries jumped around, dated across several months in what looked like the 1950s. "Company Men" was mentioned repeatedly. Men in suits who came and went in the night. Men who paid in cash and asked no questions and required absolute silence. The writer—never gave a name—talked about the crew getting "stone-sick." Coughing up black dust. Hearing whispers from the rocks they pulled up. Seeing things in the hole that weren't there when you looked directly at them.

The last entry, alone on a page, underlined three times:

*They are not digging. They are waking it.*

"We're leaving. Now."

I spun around. Plato stood in the doorway, his phone light washing out the hollows of his face. He'd followed me. He was reading over my shoulder, and I watched all the color drain from his skin.

"We bounce right now, man. Grab our shit and ghost. First light, before these corporate vampires even wake up."

No argument in his voice. No debate. Just cold, certain fear.

I looked at the journal in my hands. At the words carved into the walls. At the per diem cash in my pocket that I'd already spent in my head on food and rent and maybe a security deposit on a place that wasn't a weekly motel.

We couldn't leave. Not yet.

"First light," I agreed.

We both knew we were lying.

At dawn, we packed our bags. Quietly. Deliberately. Plato moved with the kind of careful precision you use when you're trying not to wake something dangerous. We'd just finished stuffing our tents into our packs when Buzz materialized from his trailer like he'd been watching us the whole time.

"Where you two pussies think you're going?"

Plato stepped forward, hands open, voice steady. "We're done. The job wasn't what you said it'd be. People are dying. We want our pay for days worked, and we're walking."

Buzz got in his face, all cheap cologne and prison-yard menace. He was bigger than Plato, younger, meaner. "You walk, you walk with nothing. You talk to anyone about this site, you disappear. Period. You read me?"

That's when I heard footsteps on the trail.

Crisp. Precise. The sound of dress shoes on dirt.

The man who emerged from the tree line looked like he'd taken a catastrophically wrong turn on his way to a corporate board meeting. Tailored gray suit, no wrinkles despite the hike. Polished oxfords that somehow weren't dirty. He carried a leather briefcase and picked his way down the trail with a dainty care that was almost offensive given the circumstances. Dude looked like every middle manager I'd ever stolen from, boring as shit, the kind of face you forget while you're still looking at it.

"Is there a problem, Buzz?"

His voice was soft. Polite. Utterly chilling.

___

Buzz backed off immediately, muttering something about "personnel issues" and "retention." The suit barely flicked his fingers at Buzz, like swatting a fly. Then he looked at us - not like we were people, like we were fucking inventory. Checking teeth, counting ribs, seeing which ones might fetch a good price.

"I understand your concern," he said. "I understand your concern. Raymond's incident was unfortunate. A valuable lesson in the importance of workplace safety protocols and personal accountability measures." He set the briefcase on a nearby stump and opened it with precise, manicured fingers.

It wasn't full of papers.

Stacks of cash, rubber-banded and pristine. A satellite phone. And a single black credit card that caught the morning light like obsidian.

"My name is Joseph. I represent the interests funding this operation." He spoke like he was reading from a script, every word chosen with care. "The work you're performing is important. Beyond your understanding, frankly. We are retrieving misplaced items. Archaeological artifacts of significant value. Anything unusual you discover—anything that feels wrong or out of place—you bring directly to me. For that, you are compensated extraordinarily well."

He peeled off a stack of hundreds, twice what we'd earned in two days, and held it out.

"A bonus. For your continued discretion and labor. Walk away now, and you forfeit not just this, but the substantial completion bonus waiting at project's end. Six figures, gentlemen. Split among the crew who remain. Stay, and you are part of something historic."

He wasn't threatening us. He was bargaining. And he was using the one weapon we had no defense against: hope. Hope that this nightmare job might actually be our ticket out of poverty. That the horror might be worth it.

Plato stared at the money like it was a snake. I could see the war on his face. Reason versus need, fear versus desperation. I felt the journal in my pack burning against my spine.

*Do not bring up the black stones.*

"Historic," Plato repeated slowly, tasting the word. "What exactly are we digging up?"

Joseph's expression didn't change. "Items misplaced long ago. Your concern is extraction, not interpretation. That's my domain."

He held out the money. Waiting.

Plato took it. His hand shook.

We stayed.

The money was a drug. That's the only way I can describe it. Joseph hiked up each morning like he was commuting to an office, watched the dig from the edge of the clearing like a gargoyle in business casual, and left at dusk with whatever we'd found wrapped carefully in his briefcase. He had a portable card reader hooked to the satellite phone. Every time someone brought him something significant, he'd swipe that black card and announce "Bonus issued" in a flat, emotionless voice.

The things we were pulling up weren't natural.

Twisted pieces of something as heavy as metal too smooth to be hand-tooled, with edges that seemed to curve in directions that hurt to look at. Lumps of clay that stayed warm hours after leaving the ground, radiating heat like they had their own internal furnace. Fragments of something that might have been glass or might have been stone, translucent and shot through with colors that didn't have names.

And the black stones.

Oblong, roughly the size of your fist, veined with iridescent blue that seemed to pulse under your fingers. The men who found them came up from the hole changed. Quieter. Their eyes went distant and glassy, like they'd seen something down there they couldn't process. They handed the stones to Joseph with shaking hands.

When Joseph received his first black stone, his professional mask slipped. Just for a second, a flash of something that might have been hunger or might have been terror. He took it with gloved hands, wrapped it in white cloth with ritualistic care, and placed it in a separate compartment in his briefcase. Then he swiped that card three times. "Substantial bonus issued."

I was topman that day, strapped to a tree with a climbing harness, managing the pulley that hauled buckets up and lowered them back down. It was considered the safe job. The easy job. You didn't have to go into the hole.

But you had to watch what came out of it.

Plato volunteered for the next descent. He gave me a look before he climbed down that ladder, a look that said *I need to see for myself what's down there.* I watched his headlamp disappear into the black.

He was down there for forty-five minutes.

When he came up, he was covered in fine black dust that clung to his skin like pollen. He moved slowly, mechanically, like his body was on autopilot while his mind processed something enormous. His eyes were wide and unfocused. He climbed off the ladder without a word and stood there, just breathing in ragged gasps, one hand clenched in a fist.

"Plato?" I unclipped from my harness and moved toward him. "Man, what did you see?"

He coughed. A dry, hacking sound that brought up flecks of black onto his palm. He stared at them like he'd never seen his own hand before.

"Goes down forever, man," he whispered. But the 'man' sounded forced, like he was trying to remember how to be human. "The ladder stops at forty feet but the hole keeps going. I could feel it below me. Miles and miles. And it's breathing, T. It's fucking breathing."

Joseph appeared beside us. I hadn't heard him approach. "Did you retrieve anything?"

Plato slowly opened his other fist. In his palm sat a tiny metal cube, maybe an inch on each side. Perfectly smooth. No seams, no markings, no indication of how it was made or what it was for. It was cold. So cold that condensation was already forming on its surface despite the warm morning air.

Joseph's eyes locked onto it with an intensity that made my skin crawl. He reached out with his gloved hand.

Plato looked at the cube. Looked at me. Looked at Joseph's hungry expression.

He closed his fist and pulled his hand back.

"It's mine," he said, and for just a second his voice had that old warmth, that hippie steel. "Finders keepers, man."

Joseph's face went blank. "I'm afraid that's not how this works. All materials belong to—"

"I found it." Plato's voice hardened. "You want it, you buy it. Separate from the bonus. Double what you paid for the last stone."

For a long moment, the clearing went silent except for the generator's hum and the distant sound of the hole breathing.

Then Joseph smiled. It didn't reach his eyes.

"Very enterprising. Tomorrow, then. Bring it to me tomorrow, and we'll discuss terms."

He walked away, dress shoes crunching on gravel, briefcase swinging gently at his side.

Plato watched him go. His fist stayed closed around the cube.

"We're not giving it to him," he whispered. "Not this one."

"Why? What is it?"

He finally looked at me. His eyes were bloodshot, ringed with that black dust, and absolutely terrified.

"I don't know. But down there, in the dark? I could hear it talking to me."

That night, Plato didn't sleep. He sat with the cube in his palm, staring at it like it was the most important thing in the world. Sometimes he'd whisper to it.

I lay in my sleeping bag and listened to the hole breathe and thought about the journal's warning.

*They are not digging. They are waking it.*

___

*A little black thing among the snow:*

*Crying weep, weep, in notes of woe!*

*Where are thy father & mother? say?*

*So your chimneys I sweep & in soot I sleep.*
