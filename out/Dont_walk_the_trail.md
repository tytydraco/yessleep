I'm gonna start this of by saying,i don't think im going to survive to tell you all the whole story, but, just incase I do,im going to give you all A bit of information about me before I get started; I live in a remote part of Pennsylvania,one of the few places that seem like nobody should live there,and I work at a nearby hospital-primarily having hikers as patients,I'm 32 and my name is nick.now that we got that out of the way I'm going to tell you something that ~~happened~~ is happening.

A couple of days ago when I was driving the long,hard to get through,40 minutes back to my house,I had stumbled across a hiking trail that I had never seen before I thought it was odd but I parked my car in the small gravel parking lot.the sun was setting as I stepped out of the car the sign right before the trail entrance read *please do not enter the trail after midnight* but I went in Anyway. I wasn't really going to pay attention to a warning sign to not go onto a trail, I mean who would? as I was walking everything else was normal but, I realized that there was quite literally one else around, that's strange but not unusual, here in my part of PA the population is low.As I continued walking I pulled out my phone-LTE I have no WiFi,I checked the time,12:00 pm,that didn't bother me though.I really didn't belive whatever was going on,until I turned around and heard a crunch on leaves,then another, and another and then it paused as if waiting-it started running, so I did too.

i was sprinting now,but when I looked over my shoulder to see what I was running from I saw it.

About a seven foot tall figure, sharp,jagged edges,almost like a knife and unlike the smoother edges of a humans body,pale skin,almost paper white- the worst part?,its skin was stretched tightly over its body and where its eyes should have been-empty sockets like a void or a black hole,this wasn't a human this was something out of a horror movie,something that didn't belong here on earth,something that didn't know what a human looked like but tried to be one of us.I ran faster out of adrenaline,faster than I ever have in my entire life.then I heard it, four legs hitting the ground-four grotesque enlongated legs.i quickly and silently took a large divefor the thick foliage,trees, and small crumbling dandelions,to the right side of the trail.the creature stopped and quickly whirled around,presumably confused on where I went.after a while of stalking the creature ,trying to be as silent as possible while trying to seek out another human without the creature seeing me through the bushes, I began to attempt to find shelter, I figured an old shed in the woods should get me through the rest of the night,and,well that pretty much brings us to where we are now.

I am terrified and I'm afraid it's looking for well..how do I put this?.....ME
