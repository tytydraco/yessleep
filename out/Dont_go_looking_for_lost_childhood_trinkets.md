If you ever happen upon a picture online, or anywhere else for that matter, and in that picture is something from your childhood you thought you'd lost, please listen. If attached to that picture you find coordinates, or directions to get this lost trinket back, don't follow them. Forget you ever saw the picture, and forget the trinket, no matter how special it was to you or your family. Otherwise, you may find yourself in my shoes, or worse.

Just a little over 2 years ago, I came upon a picture of something from my childhood I thought I’d lost, with coordinates I followed.

Tomorrow, I’ll be going to trial for a murder I didn’t commit. 

I’m facing a life sentence, or maybe even the death penalty, since prosecutors think I’m “refusing” to tell them where the body is and that I’m pretending to be crazy to get off on an insanity plea. And I have to be honest, I am really starting to feel like I might be going insane- I mean I’m almost sure I didn’t murder someone I love at least, but the detectives and psychologists tell me a lot about that night, things that contradict my memory, things that don’t make sense to me, but seem to make sense to everyone else. I understand where they’re coming from, and why they’ve been grilling me so hard to get me to confess to one of their theories. They know that without an explanation from me that connects the dots in ways they can accept, it’ll be difficult to convince the jury of how I, a lone 5’4, anemic, 27 year old woman was able to kill, and completely dispose of a 6 foot, athletic, 30 year old man without any help, and without leaving anything behind but her own blood. It’ll be hard for them, but not impossible, which is why I’m spending my last day out on bail writing this. 

Hopefully by the end of this, you’ll not only form some sort of an understanding of what happened to my Joey, but you’ll also understand how it would have been impossible for me to ever do anything to hurt him. Maybe you’ll even be able to help me, or yourself.

Joey and I met online in a geocaching chat, which is eventually what led us to meet in person, and to start arranging our dates around our caches. For those of you who don’t know, geo-caching is a hobby I guess, where people hide items, post a general location or coordinates, and others go looking for it. Modern day treasure hunting, if you will. The first few weeks of this were pretty uneventful, mostly just excuses to hang out and walk around to stretch our legs outside of our tedious and sedentary desk jobs. 

About 4 months in though, around the time we started realizing things were actually going really well and a few “I love yous” had been exchanged, is when it fell apart.

It was Sunday, and we met up sometime that afternoon to look for a mysterious tin box I saw posted online in one of the geocaching communities. For once, my interest was completely and totally piqued in this cache. While we normally had little to no stake in whatever item we did or didn’t end up finding, I knew that this box in the picture was mine once. 

I remembered it from years ago, and knew it wasn’t just any box, but a jewelry box, just a few inches wide and a few inches tall, something I could only fit a few rings or other treasures inside of. I think the last time I saw it I was maybe 11 or 12 years old, and lost it when my family moved a few dozen miles outside of our hometown. I knew it was possible this wasn’t \*my\* jewelry box, that it could reasonably just be similar to the one I once had, but this had been passed down to me by my late mother, who’d gotten it from her mother; There were beautifully intricate and distinctive flowers and vines carved by hand into the sides of the metal, and a delicate, heart-shaped latch to keep it closed. It looked hand-made, and original, maybe not one of a kind but not the sort of thing you’d find in a department store. 

I always figured I’d just left it behind in the move, so when by some incredible coincidence it was posted with coordinates near my old home town just an hour from where I lived now, I knew it just had to be \*my\* jewelry box, and knew I had to go find it. 

So, there we were that Sunday afternoon, just hours after I saw the post and had begged Joey to drop what he was doing and meet me so we could reach the coordinates before anyone else did. 

“So are we sure this old jewelry box is actually yours, or did you just need an excuse to see me?” He said, excited as he jumped into the passenger seat of my car.

I knew he loved these spontaneous escapades. 

“Bit of both!” I admitted with a coy shrug, and pulled out of the driveway. 

Windows down to let in the late summer breeze, music blasting, me singing, Joey slapping the dashboard to the beat, we happily, and regretfully, drove off.

Getting into town was the easy part, getting to the exact coordinates was not. 

We could see the coordinates were sort of deep in the forested hills outside of town some hikers would frequent here and there. We drove into the hills as far as the roads would take us before coming to a halt, where the coordinates directed us off the road and towards a walking path. I parked my hatchback off to the side so we could start making our way deeper into the hills on foot. 

Joey, having the gift of forethought, had me pull up the online post so he could study the picture of my jewelry box closely, looking for anything that would make it easier to find in case our coordinates weren’t exact. In the picture, the box was placed on top of a neat stack of stones, arranged in front of what I thought was an old brick wall, while Joey mused it could be a brick water well. With that, I took a screenshot of the post in case we lost cell service, and with a destination in mind, we set out at a comfortable pace, confident we could make it there and back before sundown. 

We hiked as we normally did, chatting happily, pointing out squirrels and birds or odd looking trees to one another as we went, time passing easily. It had been a few short hours with turns down a few wrong paths and a couple slow moments to stop and look at this bug or that plant when we came across the answer to what our mystery brick structure was. 

“Would you look at that! I knew it wasn't a well!” I stuck my chin up at him. 

“Yeaaaah but you don't get to call it a brick wall either lady, I think I’d call it a fence if anything” he argued playfully. 

“They don't call the great wall of china the great *fence* of china do they? It's a brick wall, which, you being a brick wall yourself should know”. 

He guffawed and feigned offense as I walked past him and up towards the wall, turning back in time to see the fading light of day casting a golden hue on his smiling face. 

The brick wall, as I decided it was to be considered, was short, just barely past my hips in height, but stretched out to our left and right as far as our eyes could see following the unpredictable curvature of the land. It seemed very old, built long ago to divide property I imagined, or maybe to herd animals inside. 

Checking our phones, we could see the coordinates would have us follow the wall along to our right, our destination maybe a mile or so away. 

Joey crossed his arms and pursed his lips, staring down the path ahead of us. “Hmm. Should we come back a little earlier next weekend you think? It’s probably gonna be dark before we can make it back to the car… easy for me of course, but I can easily see you eating dirt.” 

“Mimimimi” I mocked him in our silly way, crossing my arms. I sighed and adopted a more serious tone, “I just know by the time we make it back here someone else will have found the box first. Do you really think it would be hard to make it back if it’s dark?” I asked, having somewhat less hiking experience than Joey. 

He answered with his calm and cavalier manner, focused on his watch, “Sun is down within the hour, and then we have maybe another 30ish minutes after that before it gets dark for real. Since we know exactly where we’re going, getting back would be quicker than it took us to get here, especially if we hustle this time, but I imagine we would definitely end up in the dark for at least part of the walk back”. He looked up from his watch at me. 

I hesitated, and for the first time, felt a little nervous, but reasoned with myself. We didn’t have any animals in the area to really worry about other than a few coyotes, but I knew they’d be more afraid of us than we needed to be of them. The trail so far really was an easy one, nothing very difficult to walk or navigate even in the dark, especially with the light from our phones. We had our backpacks with a few necessities, and not only that, but the car was only a couple miles away. 

I ignored the butterflies in my stomach, the desire to see my jewelry box again overcoming my gut feeling to turn around. “I think we’ll be okay then, even if it does get dark we can just follow the wall back to the trail, and then getting back to the car from there should be easy” I decided. 

Joey agreed confidently clearly enjoying the thrill of taking a risk, even one that at the time seemed so minor. 

We followed the wall down the path further out into the hills, this time at a quicker, more determined pace, still having no trouble as we went on. The pit in my stomach lingered as we walked on, listening to crickets chirping, owls hooting, and finally the sound of coyotes barking in the distance. 

“Ooo they must’ve got something. I hope we remembered to put the cat inside” Joey said to no one in particular, referencing a nonexistent pet. 

I laughed nervously, unable to think of a joke or witty remark to carry on with. As we continued, the yipping and barking faded, and up ahead, I could finally see a neatly arranged stack of stones.

As we approached my chest began pounding and I broke out in a cold sweat, almost sick from a rush of anxiety. 

“Eugh, why do I feel so gross all of the sudden?” I put a hand on Joey’s shoulder to keep myself from falling over, head swimming with lightheadedness. 

“Uh oh, did you drink enough water today? When’s the last time you ate?” He asked, his hands steadying me and easing my anxiety simultaneously. 

I regained my balance and took a moment to recover. “Yeah I guess not since this morning, I’ll eat when I’m home and I’ll be fine” I made an effort to put him at ease, sliding my pack off my shoulder and pulling out a fresh water bottle. I fumbled with the cap, my long acrylic nails and shaky anemic hands giving me trouble. 

Joey, eager to be helpful and already fully accustomed to needing to open cans and whatnot constantly for me, gently took the bottle out of my hand and uncapped it before handing it back. It was a little ritual of ours, just something small he could do for me everyday to feel and be chivalrous to me. After a few sips I felt okay enough to keep going. It was only a few more steps before we were stopped in front of the stack of stones. 

Finally, there it was, placed on the stones- my little jewelry box. 

Now that we were up close, I could see the stones had been arranged in a circle around the box, keeping it safe, elevated, and easy to spot. Oddly enough, the stones didn’t appear to have been found in the area- I couldn’t see anything as rounded as them around anywhere; All the other rocks in the area were hard and jagged, not smooth like these, as if softened by the current of a river that didn’t exist here. 

I stared at the delicate arrangement, harmless enough, but couldn’t ignore my growing anxiety and the inexplicable feeling of my chest screaming at me to leave it, and turn back. 

It was a primal fear, the only thing I’d ever felt similar to it had been when I was very young and tried to befriend a stray dog. It was on my approach that the poor thing started panting heavily and I saw it was drooling uncontrollably, its body eerily and unnaturally contorted. I didn’t know the dog was rabid at the time, not yet at the age to have seen Old Yeller, but still, even as a child I somehow knew to get away, to run home. 

I had the same pit in my stomach now that I’d had then. I was finally going to listen to whatever feeling had been so desperately trying to tell me something, but the lightheadedness peaked, clouding my vision. I blinked hard, fearing that I would faint at any moment.

When I opened my eyes, the fog of lightheadedness had suddenly cleared, as if swept away by a strong gust of wind. I looked down at my now outstretched hand to see my old jewelry box sitting in the center of my palm. 

I had no memory of bending down to pick it up, but I figured I must have been so woozy in the last few seconds that I somehow couldn’t remember having done it. I looked back at the pile of stones the box had been sitting on, and saw that they were no longer neatly arranged, but toppled over at the bottom of the wall. Ice cold blood shot through my veins. Seeing the stones out of their place, no longer stacked in their neat circle, felt like what I imagine seeing a loved one’s corpse would feel like. Looking at the toppled stack felt wrong, saddening, infuriating, but most of all, frightening. 

Joey, picking up on my worsening disposition, pushed a lock of curly blonde hair out of my face, thankfully somewhat shaking me out of my state of shock. “Hey what’s up? You okay?” 

“Uhm” I struggled to find my words; The fog of lightheadedness had made way for a sharp, stifling unease. 

“Laura, hey, are you okay?” He asked again, more urgently this time. 

Hearing my name grounded me, and I found I could speak again. “Jesus” I shook my head, “I’m sorry hun I don’t know why I just got the strangest feeling ever. Just like a weird anxiety thing or whatever, so weird.” I reasoned with him and myself, taking a deep breath in an attempt to reassume a more dignified bearing. 

“Yeah I can tell” He said, this time his voice slightly more jovial, if not still with a hint of worry, “Come on, lets get back before we lose you out here” 

“Okay yeah, let's go” I agreed, taking his hand. I looked back one more time at the now scattered stones. Directly above the stones, there was a large crack deep in the wall, one I somehow hadn't noticed before. I didn’t have long to think about the crack in the wall and if it had been there a second ago or not before Joey started on his way, pulling me along gently. 

We followed the wall back to our trail without issue, even while the sun had slumped behind the hills by now. In the twilight hours, we still had enough fading light to not be in the pitch black just yet. As we left the wall and started down our path, again the urge to look behind me came with a shiver. I turned my head just in time to see a shadow duck down behind the wall. 

My mouth gaped open and I yanked Joey's hand. “Holy shit I swear to God I just saw something looking at us behind the wall!” My words tumbled out. 

“Are you serious?” He cried, wrenching his head back to look and pulling me closer. 

“Dude I am not kidding you as soon as I turned around I saw like a head or shadow duck down” I said, my face and tone clearly telling him I was genuinely in a panic. 

Joey, not being a moron in a movie, didn't waste a second arguing. “Fuck let's move it then” he said squeezing my hand tighter and leading me down the path now at a jog, our phone flashlights bobbing in front of us. 

The path through the hills, beautiful during the day, was now becoming a nightmare as twilight faded and pitch darkness closed in on us. I felt tears in my eyes as we hurried along, so terrified and so angry at myself for having allowed us to be out here after dark. Every shadow our lights cast tricked my eyes. Every snap of a twig behind us had me jumping out of my skin, every rustle of a bush ahead of us was like thunder to me. 

I realized I missed the yelps of the coyotes, I longed for the sound of bugs, owls, anything familiar, but even mother nature seemed to have abandoned the area now, having listened to the instincts that I didn't. A tingling itch plagued me as we ran, slithering its way down my back and up through the nape of my neck, an incessant compulsion to look behind me; Every time I gave into the compulsion to look back I only grew more terrified, unable to see anything in the dark. I cursed my flashlight- weak and revealing nothing to me, save the knowledge that if something were there, it was perfectly concealed, shrouded in shadows. 

The urge to run faster was swelling up inside of me, but I knew going any faster would run the risk of one of us falling and hurting ourselves; The thought of being stuck out here overnight, injured and helpless with the shadows forced me to bring all my attention to my legs, ensuring my feet were planted firmly and with intent for each step. “This was so stupid” I mourned, about ready to cry as my legs began to ache. 

“We’re okay” was all Joey could manage, breathing heavily. I could sense he was struggling to stay calm too. 

It felt like a miracle when we finally made it to the car. 

“I'll drive.” Joey said, and I was relieved to hand over the keys. 

I collapsed in the passenger seat while Joey pressed on the gas, speeding away. We spent the next few minutes silently catching our breath, comforted by the familiar sound of the car’s engine. I was suddenly aware of a sharp pain in my hand. I looked down and remembered I'd been holding the jewelry box, but all this time I hadn't realized I'd been holding onto it so tightly that sharp indents were left on my palms and fingers from its squared edges. One of the indents had even broken the skin, leaving behind a growing spot of blood. I set the box down by my feet and pulled a napkin out of my glove box. 

“Yowch,” Joey broke the silence, peeking over at me, “you cut yourself just now?” 

I pressed the napkin against the cut- small, but surprisingly deep. “I guess I didn't notice before. Don’t worry, it's tiny”. I assured him. 

“We need food, showers, and a band-aid, stat” the tone of his voice finally relaxing and returning to its regular cadence. “That was kind of nuts back there huh?” His demeanor helped put me at ease and I joined him in making light of what we thought was left behind us at the wall.

As we got back into town, feeling ravenous, we stopped by a small mom and pop place, currently our favorite, but out of the way and not well known. Getting out of the car, I opened the door to the backseat and reached in, digging around in the dark until I found my wallet, then moved back to reach for the door again. 

I paused, then swung my head around back and forth looking around at nothing. Aside from the two other cars in the lot, it was empty. Though Joey was on the other side of the car fumbling around with his own backpack, I couldn’t shake the feeling that I’d just felt something slink past me. A near unnoticeable breeze, the warmth of something having gotten too close, the tickling sensation of something brushing ever so slightly against the sensitive hairs on my arm. My stomach churned uncomfortably and my ears felt hot as I fixed my gaze down the dark, empty road behind us. 

“Ready?” Joey beckoned, breaking me out of my trance. 

*‘I must be freaked out from earlier still.”* I thought to myself, ignoring the odd feeling. “Yep!” I mustered, slamming the car door shut behind me. As I walked back to the front of the car to follow him, I discreetly peeked through the passenger side window, down to the jewelry box on the car floor. I couldn’t explain why, but I was relieved to see it still sitting there, undisturbed.  

I stood behind Joey at the counter as he ordered us a few kabobs, swaying back and forth on the balls of my feet, forcing myself to appear nonchalant. My eyes wandered around the old restaurant, looking at photos of relatives and previous generations hung on the walls. My gaze made its way to the window, looking out over the parking lot. 

I could see my car, the overhead light still on, taking its time to automatically shut off. I watched the light, wanting to be sure it would turn off on its own, wondering if Joey might have left his door slightly ajar. Finally, the light dimmed, and I began to break my gaze and turn away. As the light faded to dark, I could barely start to make out something now reflecting back at me. There, in the backseat of the car, I saw… eyes. Staring at me. Two glowing orbs, reflective like an animal’s would be in the dark, but unmoving, unblinking. 

In the instant I turned back to refocus my gaze, the eyes were gone, and the car was dark. 

Leaving Joey at the counter, I slowly approached the window, close enough to the car that if anything were in there, I’d be able to see it. Assisted by the solitary lamppost outside, its dim yellow light allowed me to peer inside. Searching intently, I saw nothing. Nothing inside was disturbed, and it was undoubtedly empty, my eyes having tricked me again. I released the air from my chest out through my nose in a long burst, noticing I’d been holding my breath. 

I chose a booth for us to sit at, one farthest from the window. I realized what had taken Joey so long up at the counter, as he met me at the booth with a roll of bandages and an alcohol wipe he’d had the cashier retrieve us from a first aid kit in the kitchen. 

“Aw that was nice” I thanked him, “let me go wash my hands first, one sec”, I said standing up from the table and heading to the bathroom. As I walked past the window, I couldn’t shake the feeling I was being watched. Looking around the empty restaurant, no one was here but Joey, who was now focused on his phone, the cashier, typing away at a laptop, and a cook I could only hear, clanking around in the kitchen. I looked outside toward the car, confirming nothing was there, and no one was looking at me. 

In the bathroom, I washed my cut diligently with soap and water, then leaned on the sink to close my eyes, taking measured breaths to regain my composure. I opened my eyes, looking back at myself and the empty bathroom in the mirror. I let out another long sigh, annoyed at myself for feeling so skittish. 

I rejoined Joey at the table, happy that at least he seemed fine, focused on whatever game he’d been playing on his phone. Seeing me approach he put the game away, helping me clean my cut and wrap it snugly with the bandage. After we’d had our food and were satiated, we headed for the door, back to the car.

“You opposed to us swinging by your apartment first so you can grab some clothes?” He implied in his casual way of inviting me to stay the night. 

I happily obliged, always ready to spend more time with him, as well as looking to avoid being by myself tonight. Packing ourselves back into the car, the relentless feeling of being watched followed me and was stronger here, despite me having double checked that the backseat was in fact empty. The feeling followed me throughout our drive, to my complex. 

We pulled up and I flew out of the car, up the stairs and through my front door. I scratched the back of my neck vigorously as I entered, a tickle or itch having irritated me. Ignoring the itch and not wanting to keep Joey waiting I rushed to grab my duffle bag. Unintentionally and subconsciously I avoided being near the windows as I scurried around the apartment throwing clothes and toiletries into a bag; Within minutes I was back in the car, and we were back on the road.

We made it back to Joey’s quickly, my tires crunching in the gravel driveway. As I stepped out of the car, Joey laughed. “No way you’re about to leave that jewelry box in the car after all that trouble right?” I paused, having intended to leave it. “I bet there’s a million dollar check in there!” he exclaimed dramatically. 

“You know I do remember leaving a winning lottery ticket in here when I had it last”  I said, reaching back in the car to retrieve it. ‘*Dammit’*  I thought to myself, feeling a moderately less intense, but still uncomfortable and unexplainable surge of anxiety.

I took the little jewelry box in my hands, and walked into the house.
