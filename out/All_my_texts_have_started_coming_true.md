All my texts have started coming true.  

It was simple enough to start with, something that could've just been put down to a really unlikely coincidence or something..  
I called in sick to work.  
Or rather, I sent a text.  

My boss was really chill, and he was happy to use texting as a form of communication. What a world we live in, right?  
So I didn't even have to fake the sniffles or the sick voice, just typed a few words and that was done.  

I snuggled back into bed and decided to sleep for a few extra hours. I was feeling absolutely fine, but I had a championship game on my Xbox starting at 10, so I planned to use my sickie getting my scores up.   

A few hours later, just as I was about to settle down in front of the TV, headset in hand, I felt the first rumble in my belly.   

I clutched my sides, feeling hot and cold at the same time as nausea swept over me.   
My forehead broke out into a sweat, and without even time to think, I dropped the headset and ran to the bathroom.  

I've never had good poisoning as bad in my life, as I experienced that morning.   
It wasn't until close to midnight I was able to crawl from the bathroom to my bedroom. I lay down in bed, noticing my phone for the first time that day. 

A notification flashes on the screen. 1 message.   
It's from my boss, a reply from the text I sent him this morning saying I wouldn't be into work.   
He had replied, and joked about staying away from the late night taco stand I sometimes frequented.   
I'd completely forgotten I'd told him I had food poisoning.   

I never really considered the fact it was anything to do with the message.   
Why would I?   
I just put it down, as I said, a weird coincidence.   
But then it happened again.   

Mary was a girl from my past, a girl I'd been seeing for 3 years, and was planning to propose to.   
Well, until I found her with our next door neighbor, that is.   

We had been separated for over a year now, but every few months, when she was likely going through a stage of being single no doubt, she would message and call me,drunkenly crying about a reconciliation.   

At first her calls had seemed sad, desperate and lonely even, but then I started to get sick of them.   

I could see a pattern emerging and truth be told, I was doing better than ever without her, I didn't need her to bring me down anymore and these constant calls were draining.   

When she blew up my inbox and voice messages the next day, I started at the list of missed calls with frustration.  
“I wish you would just drop dead!“ I didn't actually mean to hit send, but in the heat of the moment I pressed it without thinking.   
I was too angry to regret it, at that stage anyway. I couldn't be bothered with the abuse I was sure to follow from my Text, so I just turned my phone off and decided I'd deal with that drama in the morning.   

Only when I woke up, turned my phone back on, there was no drama to deal with. No mean messages, no messages at all. No missed calls.   
I wondered if perhaps my comment had finally been enough to severe our connection. I hoped it was.   

Then on the way to work, my brother called.   
I was halfway through a new podcast and didn't feel like talking to him.   

I flicked him a quick text, a small white lie about seeing a car accident and needing to be interviewed by the police. I know, I know.. But if I had said I was listening to a podcast, he would've kept harrassing me with calls. He was persistent like that. And.. I mean.. I never thought..   

Maybe by now, you can guess how my morning had gone.   
I never got the finish the podcast, instead I spent 4 hours waiting on the side of the road, next to a smouldering car, watching body bags be packed.  

Turns out I wasn't a good witness anyway. When I watched the accident happen, it was all in slow motion. I can still see every single fucking moment in my head, but whenever I try and get the words out.. I choke up, I babble.   
I feel ill as the realization hit me, the connection of my text and the food poisoning, the accident I'd just witnessed.. Too much to be a coincidence.   

I wondered maybe if I was going insane, that honestly seemed like a more realistic thing than somehow my text messages having a.. Power?   
When I got to work, my manager called me into his office.   

He gave me kind eyes, and gently asked me to sit down.   
He'd obviously heard of my morning, seeing the accident. He must have known I was shaken up.   
I felt greatful for him, at that moment.   
Until he begins to speak.  

"I'm sorry, Max. I can't imagine how you feel. I remember the way you used to talk about Mary.. And despite whatever had happened during the break up, I know you loved. It's really difficult news, if there is anything I can do.."  

Mary was dead. Of course. But at the same time, I didn't believe it. Didn't want to believe it. I knew then that I was not crazy, not loosing my mind. Somehow, some fucking way, my text messages were able to make things come true.   
I felt sick with anxiety. I needed to do something, get rid of this cursed phone. I had done enough damage.  

I excused myself from the bosses office, and made my way to the bathroom. I was going to flush this piece of evil technology down the drain.   
But when I reached into my pocket, it was empty. I'd lost the phone. I couldn't recall the last time id used it or seen it. I had put it in my pocket when the officer approached to take my statement.. And hadn't seen it since.   

I tried to calm my breathing. Told myself it was okay. My phone was probably siting in the bosses office still, having fallen out of my pocket while I was sitting in there.   

And worse case.. Even if someone did find my phone and steal it to use it as their own, they'd put their own sim card, wouldn't they?  
 I made my way back to the office and gave a quick knock before letting myself in.   
“Is it.. Supposed to be funny?“ His expression was unreadable, a small frown at his temple.   
I wasn't sure what he was taking about, and I told him so.   

“Oh don't be silly, Max. Obviously it's from you. It's a text from your phone."  
Instantly my heart begins to race. I reach over and grab his own mobile from his hands, straining to see the text message.   

“To a stinky boss, I hope you rot. Get ready for hell, you really aren't well."  
I felt my face flush with each word I read.   
I turned to my Boss, my brain fumbling over apologies and excuses, but it was too late.   
He and I held eye contact as he started convulsing. I mouthed I'm sorry, but I don't think he could see it.   

I ran from the room, screaming to call an ambulance, but I knew he would be dead before it arrived.  

I dont know where my phones ended up.   
I'm scared.   
Especially because my mum just phoned my work place, something she has never done in the 15 years I had been working here.   

When she was transferred to me, I could hear the tears in her voice. She sobbed as she asked me what had gotten into me, why I would say those things to her and my father? What had they done?
   
My heart sank and tears rolled down my own cheeks.   
I held onto the receiver so tight and I told her I loved her and dad so much.   
I listened as her breathing got raggered.   
I listened until there was nothing but silence on the other end.   

I dont know what to do.   
It's like this person is going through my phone book, and texting all my contacts, sending them to their deaths? 
Why would anyone do that?!  

I can't believe this is happening.   
I had to buy a burner phone, and I'm ready to text my own number.. Too be honest, I'm just a bit scared of the reply.   

But, I need to find my phone and put an end to all this mess I've made, somehow. I don't want anyone else to die because of me.   

I'll update when I get a text back, or if you don't hear back.. Well, the message back I recieved wasn't good. Take care guys. I'll update as soon as I can.
