Hi all, I am writing this a bit sleep deprived, so bare with me.

 On october 22nd, I decided it would be fun because of the Halloween season, to visit an abandoned farmhouse near me and conduct a ouiji board session. I know a bit tropey, but it was supposed to be harmless fun. I then asked my best friend, Justin, if he wanted to do this with me. He said yes, and we headed out that night to the abandoned farmhouse with the ouiji board. 

Now, for context, this farmhouse has been in my small town since the early 1800s. In the early 1950s, a cult bought the grounds, and it shortly became a place of satanic rituals. Eventually, the cult members would mysteriously vanish one by one. When police showed up, they found no trace of anyone or anyone living there, and the farmhouse slowly became abandoned, becoming the towns ghost story.

As we arrived at the farmhouse, me and Justin would grab flashlights from the car and the ouiji board. We then made the 5 minute trip up the field toward the farmhouse. It was apparent the place had seen better days, and we were not the first ones to visit this farmhouse. The door to the farmhouse was easy to push open, and then we made our way inside. As we made our way inside, we saw a kitchen to our right, and to the left was a living room. Going past the living room, there were a few other rooms and stairs to a basement. We decided to carefully make our way down to the basement, both of us sitting in the middle of the room. As we set up the ouiji board, we began the session. 

Me: "Is there anyone with us?" *no response*

Justin: "Do you live here?" 
*no response. But the room got colder, and I felt a sense of dread and fear.*

As we were getting ready to move back upstairs, to my suprise, the planchette moved to spell W-E-L-C-O-ME, and then I saw it... A large inhuman figure standing in the corner, close to Justin. Justin saw me stare in shock behind him, and as he turned around, his face went pale. We both slowly got up, but then the figure bolted at us, and we both dropped everything and ran. As I got out the door, I looked back, expecting to see Justin. To my horror, all I saw was the figure. He stared at me, waving with a giant animal like grin. I got out of there, and as I got home, I called the cops. They found nothing, Justin was gone, the figure was gone, and the ouiji board was gone. We didn't end the session.

 That night, when I finally fell asleep, I saw Justin. Everything about him was wrong. That face, oh God, that face. He gave me that animal like grin, the same one that fucking thing gave me, and then he waved at me. I woke up to a ping on my phone. I keep on getting texts from Justin's phone....He wants me to come back to the farmhouse. He keeps on texting me "its fun here" over and over. I blocked his number, but the messages keep on coming through. I don't feel alone anymore, and I am afraid to sleep. I think I am next. As I write this, whatever took Justin, keeps on toying with me, sending me pictures from outside my house.

Every time I fall asleep, It gets closer
