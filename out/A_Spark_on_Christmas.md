I was planning on spending the week of Christmas back in my hometown with my wife, our children, and my sister and her family. We found a short-term rental on the outskirts that would accommodate us easily. There would’ve been nine people total, but two days prior, my sister backed out – her whole family had the flu. It was disappointing, but since we’d already paid for it, my wife and I were still determined to go. Then, on the morning of Christmas Eve, when we were supposed to drive up there, my wife got called into work at her hospital after her surgical team was activated. An organ recipient had just been matched with a donor, and the surgery couldn’t wait. She would be there all day.

We debated our options and decided that I should drive up separately with our two kids, and she would join us early on Christmas morning. That would give the kids the opportunity to attend the town’s Christmas eve pageant, which our seven-year-old daughter, Persephone, had been looking forward to.

So that’s how only three of us ended up driving to a huge, historic house on Christmas eve. When we arrived around noon, the property manager, Celeste, was there to welcome us. “Good afternoon,” she said as we got out of the car. “Need any help with your bags?”

I looked in the back of my SUV, where our luggage and the children’s gifts were packed. “Yeah, if it wouldn’t be too much trouble, I could use a little help.” I opened the car door to retrieve our bags, handing one to our host.

Persephone unbelted herself and then reached over and unbelted Connor, my four-year-old son. “Wow!” she said as she stepped out of the car. “This house is so big!”

“It is, isn’t it?” I said. “Your aunt and I used to ride our bikes past this house all the time when we were little.”

“Oh, you’re from around here?” Celeste asked.

I nodded. “Yep. When I saw this house was available to rent, I jumped on it. All those years riding by, and I’ve never been inside. I was always curious, though.”

Celeste walked alongside me as we made our way to the porch. “The new owners did a great job fixing this place up,” she said. “All new interiors, new roof, new windows. I heard it was in bad shape for a long time before they bought it.”

“Yeah, the place looks great now,” I marveled, “but it used to spook us as kids. You should hear all the stories we use to tell each other about this house.”

Persephone piped up from behind. “What stories, Dad?”

I laughed. “Just all sorts of weird, stupid tales that kids tell each other on the playground. None of it’s real.”

Celeste ushered us through the front door. “Just look at it,” she said with a grand sweep of her arm. “Didn’t they do a fantastic job in here? You can’t even tell the parlor nearly burned down. They completely rebuilt it.” She noticed the anxious look on Persephone’s face. “Oh, don’t worry, young one. Everything’s fixed up perfect now.” Persephone smiled back at her.

The house looked very modern inside, as if the new owners didn’t care about keeping the house’s classic character. It was almost a letdown. Celeste directed my attention to the parlor. “And here’s the Christmas tree you asked for,” she said. “Always happy to do special requests.”

“Can we look around?” Persephone asked.

"Go ahead,” I answered. Both she and Connor, not wasting any time, ran upstairs to explore.

Celeste stayed a few more minutes to make sure we had everything we needed, then left. The kids were having a great time exploring all the rooms, which gave me the opportunity to unload the rest of our luggage and unpack. Later that day we drove into town for the Christmas eve pageant and a late dinner. When we finally returned to the house it was already dark, and I was dead tired. Once we got inside, the kids immediately returned to their exploration. I let them play while I retreated upstairs to the master bedroom to rest for a few minutes. Their laughter echoed through the house as I closed my eyes for just a moment.

I must’ve fallen asleep, because the next thing I knew an hour had passed. Connor’s laughter still reverberated through the house, and I heard his cheerful voice down in the parlor below. “Let’s keep playing! You’re funny!” he said between shrieks of laughter. I silently cursed myself for dozing off, then got up to go tend to the kids.

As I walked down the hallway toward the staircase, I noticed some movement in the kid’s bedroom down at the other side of the hallway. I walked over and poked my head in the door, only to see Persephone lying on the bed scrolling through her iPad. “You’re not with Connor?” I asked, even though the answer was already obvious.

“I got bored,” she said.

Downstairs, Connor was talking energetically. “No, you didn’t!” he giggled.  “That would hurt too much!”

I paused to listen to Connor’s one-way conversation. “Who’s he talking to?” I asked Persephone. “Did Mommy get here early?”

Persephone shook her head. “Nope. I don’t know who he’s talking to.”

I headed downstairs, getting a little worried as Connor’s words took a stranger turn. “I want to play with you too!” he said. Behind me, I could hear Persephone following.

I made it to the parlor to find Connor all alone. “Hey!” I said. “What’s going on?”

Connor looked at me, “Hi Daddy!”

“Are you talking to Santa?” I asked, relieved that there was no one else inside the house.

“No, I was just talking…” Connor was cut off by the sound of a scream from outside. We all stopped and turned around.

“What was that?” asked Persephone.

“I don’t know,” I said. “It kind of sounded like someone said *help me*.” I went over to the window and looked out. There was a strong, cold breeze picking up, but I couldn’t see anything out of the ordinary. “Wait here,” I told them. “I’m going to check it out. I’ll just be out front.”

I stepped outside, making sure to leave the door ajar so I’d be able to hear the kids. I stood on the porch for a few moments staring into the empty, cold darkness. Just when I was about to go back in, I heard the same scream, somewhere off in the woods. Or maybe it was just the wind? Or a wild animal? Still not sure what I was hearing, I took a few steps off the porch.

Again, the voice cried out in the dark, “Over here!” it seemed to say, or maybe it was just a stiff breeze blowing through the tree branches.

I walked down the pathway and left the property. “Hello?” I shouted into the blackness. “Are you okay?”

Another scream came, this time even further away. It sounded like someone was in distress. I followed it, going deeper into the woods, and further away from the house. I was feeling anxious about leaving my kids alone, but at the same time I didn’t want to ignore a person who might need help.

I stood amongst the trees, waiting for another distressed plea to guide me along, but after a minute I gave up. “This is crazy,” I said aloud. I turned around and started walking back to the house, but right at that moment, another scream made its way to me. All of the sudden, the situation felt nauseatingly peculiar to me, as if I was being intentionally drawn out, further away from my kids.

I ignored the last scream, or whatever it was, and hurried back. When I got to the porch, the door was closed. I tried to open it, but the lock was firmly engaged. I banged it with my fist. “Persephone! Let me in!”

Neither child came to the door. I fumbled around in my pocket, and thankfully I still had the key. After struggling in the dark to find the keyhole, I jammed the key inside and managed to get the door open. I ran inside to Connor and Persephone, who were both still in the parlor. Before I could even admonish Persephone for not opening the door, I saw something that made me downright angry. A large candelabra, that had been used as a decoration on the mantle, was fully lit. All six of its candles burned brightly. Not only that, it’d been moved from the mantle to the end table, right next to the Christmas tree. Open flames licked at the tree’s dry branches, daring them to catch fire.

“What are you doing?” I yelled at Persephone. “Look how close this is to the tree!” I grabbed the candelabra and blew out all the candles. “How did you even light these?”

Persephone trembled. “I… I didn’t,” she said in a meek voice, barely above a whisper.

“Oh, you’re telling me Connor did it? Is that what you want me to believe?”

Persephone, who was the kind of kid to clam up when she was stressed, didn’t respond. Curious as to how she could’ve lit the candles, I went over to the kitchen and looked through the drawers until I found a butane utility lighter among some other gadgets. “Is this what you used?” I demanded.

Persephone sniffled as her eyes began to water. She wanted to speak, but her words just wouldn’t come out.

I put the lighter in my pocket. “I can’t believe you’re acting this way, on Christmas eve of all nights. You could’ve set the house on fire!” I sat down on the couch, exasperated. “Just… go to bed. Both of you.”

Persephone ran off, bawling as she climbed the stairs. I picked up Connor. “C’mon little guy. Let’s get you to sleep.”

“Is Santa still going to come?” he asked.

“Yeah, don’t worry about Santa. He’ll come.”

As we walked up the stairs, Connor picked his head up off my shoulder and waved at the parlor. “Good night!” he said.

“Are you waving at Santa?” I asked. “He’s not here yet, kid.” I took Connor to their bedroom and dressed him in his pajamas. Persephone was already in bed with the covers over her face, crying. I was still angry, so once I placed Connor in bed, I simply said, “good night,” and left their bedroom.

I went to my own bedroom and plopped down on the bed, frustrated. The evening had been a big bust – we’d been planning to make cookies for Santa and hot cocoa for ourselves, but I’d screwed that all up when I fell asleep. I hadn’t even put the kids’ presents under the tree yet, but I was exhausted. “Screw it,” I thought, “I’ll just wake up early and do it then.”

Despite my exhaustion, I remained awake, replaying the evening’s events in my mind while an ever-growing sense of guilt crept over me. Persephone was a good kid, and even though I had no idea what’d happened with the candelabra, I knew she had no malice in her. I’d yelled at her on Christmas eve and made her cry. After a while, I felt like the worst dad in the world.

When my guilt became too much to bear, I got out of bed and headed over to the kids’ room. Oddly, I found that my own bedroom door was closed, even though I distinctly remembered leaving it open so I could hear them. “Weird,” I thought.

I walked to the other end of the hallway and pushed their door open. Persephone was still weeping softly, but Connor was already asleep. “Hey,” I said as I sat on the edge of Persephone’s bed. “I’m sorry I yelled at you.”

Persephone moved the blankets down from around her face. She didn’t say a word.

“Do you want to sleep in my bed tonight?” I asked. “Would that make you feel better?”

Persephone nodded her head rapidly.

“Okay, let me grab your brother,” I said, “and we’ll all go.” I picked Connor up and cradled him in my arms. Together we walked to my room and laid ourselves on the king-size bed. Persephone fell asleep after just a couple of minutes.

I closed my eyes, and had just nodded off, when I heard the deafening sound of a smoke alarm blast through the house. I jumped out of bed and darted to the hallway, where I saw smoke rising from the first floor. From my vantage point, I could look down the stairway and see just enough of the parlor to know that it was on fire. Then, I watched in shock as flames burst their way through the floor of the kids’ room, which was directly above the parlor. I had no idea a fire could spread so unbelievably fast.

I ran back to the bedroom, where the kids had been startled awake. “Come on!” I yelled. “We have to get out of here!” I picked up Connor with one arm and grabbed Persephone’s arm with my free hand. When we got to the bedroom doorway, I saw that the flames were already working their way towards our end of the hallway. I ran to the stairway with the kids, barely making it there before the flames started surrounding us.

As I took my first step down the stairs, I heard a voice cry from the kids’ bedroom. “Help me!” I looked into the room – it was a blazing furnace, and I knew that anyone in there was already dead. Wasting no more time, we ran down the stairs and made it to the main entryway. I fumbled with the lock – it seemed like it didn’t want to budge, but with enough force I finally got it open, and we made our way outside, where we were safe.

Soon, an elderly neighbor came running over. “Is everyone okay?” She asked. “I called the fire department.”

“Thank you,” I replied, still trying to catch my breath. “We’re okay.”

“Is anyone else in there?”

I shook my head. “No, we all got out.”

“Thank heaven for that,” she said, staring in awe at the inferno in front of her. “That house already claimed the lives of two children,” she said, almost under her breath.

I looked at the fire, captivated by the flames, “Is that so?”

“Yes,” she said. “It was decades ago. The Christmas tree caught fire and burned half the house – the poor dears didn’t make it out.”

I knelt and held my kids tight, knowing that I’d been only a minute away from losing them. As we watch flames burst out of the upstairs windows, I could swear I heard one last, terrified scream come from inside the house… but maybe that was just the sound of the approaching sirens.
