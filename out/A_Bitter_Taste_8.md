I descend into darkness, drawn by the distant screams. My hands feel blindly along the damp cobblestone walls.

My footsteps echo down the stairwell—alone. Marie’s not following me down. The realization almost stops me. The last place she didn’t follow me to was patrolled by that beast.

Each step feels steeper than the last, the darkness pressing in tighter with every footfall.

I almost trip as I step down and find no stair beneath me. I’ve reached the bottom, but my vision is still consumed by darkness. 

I feel along the walls, searching for a light switch My fingers fumble across a row of switches. I flip them all, and the room swells with harsh light and mechanical noise.

Large bulbs burn a blinding white overhead, illuminating in spotlights. A massive gear begins to turn with a rumble that shakes the floor, the air thick with the scent of old oil and ozone.

The room is vast, its stone walls and floor cold and cavernous. Tables cluttered with science equipment, papers, and jars of organs dot the open space.

A rusty chainlink fence blocks the only path forward, going from floor to ceiling. Its gate lies open, however.

“Master?” a woman calls from beyond the fence—soft, familiar. My blood runs cold.

It’s her voice.

My mother’s voice.

I freeze. 

Is she here? Has she been alive this whole time? Was Marie lying?

“Mom?” 

Clumsy footsteps approach in the darkness. A figure comes into the light. I crash to the floor, a scream ripping out of me before I can even think.

“Oh, poor Al.” The monster coos through its exposed gnashing teeth.

Its mouth is lipless, and its eyes are small and black. Metal hooks wrap from inside its mouth to the back of its head. 

It’s naked, grotesquely sexless, its limbs thin but belly bloated like a corpse left in the sun. Needles—each over a foot long—are implanted in its hands as if they’re claws.

It trudges towards me, shambling as it keeps its hands close to its chest. The metal gate screeches open—swinging inward as the monster lumbers through it.

“S-stay back!” I scream, scrambling backwards. The creature continues towards me—outstretching its arms.

“It’s okay, my sweet Al. I’m here to help you.” It sings softly—mimicking my mothers voice.

The needles get closer and closer as it advances on me. I can see it’a skin better now. It’s a raw pink—covered with burn scars. The stench of chemicals emanates from it.

I lunge for the gate. The needles scrape me as the creature swipes.

“Wait. Please. I love you.” I hear as I make it through the gate’s threshold. I turn and search for a way to latch the gate—averting my eyes away from the approaching creature.

My heart sinks—my chest feels tight. 

The gate locks from the other side. 

The door opens in their direction as well, so I can’t barricade it. My eyes turn to my surroundings, looking for any way to bar the door. 

But the hall is barren and leads to total darkness. I take my chances and go further down it—becoming blinded by the dark.

I go slow, my feet scanning the floor in front of me and my hands feeling along the wall to my right. 

The hall continues with the same dimensions, the walls being just farther apart than my arm-span. The ceiling was tall the last time I saw it. In the darkness, it feels even taller.

I hear the sound of metal clanging against metal—then the sound of the gate opening. 

I break into a panicked stride, frantically pushing forward into an ever-consuming abyss. Then, the wall to my right gives way, and I nearly trip over something knee high.

I’ve lost all sense of direction. The dark wraps around me like a blindfold. The footsteps of the monster grow louder with each step.

I fumble through the dark, groping along boxes and draped furniture. Suddenly I hear something roll my way, and I jump back.

“Stop. Alan, stay calm. It’s a flashlight.” A whisper slides through the dark, brittle and urgent.

“A flashlight? What? Who are you?” I say, peering into the dark the best I can—but seeing nothing.

“One of yours. You made me to help. Quick, you don’t have time. Take the flashlight and go to the lower levels. You’ll need it, the overhead lights will send the one down there into a frenzy without master around.” The darkness itself seemed to say.

“How can I be—“

“Alan, we don’t have time for this!” The voice hissed urgently.

A part of me doesn’t trust it—but the monster is close, and I need light.

I grasp around the ground and find it. I turn the flashlight on and wave it around me.

I’m in a storage room of sorts, stacked high with crates, chests, and chairs. 

I’m alone in the room.

But I fear not for long—I turn my flashlight towards where I came, and see the abomination lurching down the hall.

“My sweet Al, please—it’s for your own good. I love you so very much. And I forgive you.”

“Stay the hell away from me! Stop using her voice!”

I scan the room with the flashlight, looking for an exit. There’s doors going off to the left and right, and a spiral stairwell that leads further down. 

I take my chances with the stairs. They’re small, and narrow, but navigating them is easy with the flashlight. The monster’s calls grow distant as I descend.

The stairs end, and I’m met with another lab. It looks much like the first one, but… there’s bodies strewn about.

Male and female—old and young. They all either lie upon tables, hang from chains, or are propped up against the walls.

I drop to my knees.

This is my lab. These are my tools. These… are my victims.

I did all of this.

Details escape me, but I have the most overwhelming sense of deja vu. I know innately that this is my lab, and my work.

It feels surreal. My head is spinning. 

How could I do this? 

Why would I do this?

I hear the footsteps getting closer. I force myself to my uneasy feet, and continue forward—pushing away body after body. 

I avert my eyes from the corpses as possible, but there’s too many. They’re all in pieces—some haphazardly stitched together. One’s eyes seems to follow me as I walk past.

My foot strikes something—a trap door. I swing it open, and there’s a ladder going further down. 

I stare at it, contemplating.

I feel like if I go down the ladder, I could escape it. I doubt it could climb—but do I really want to keep going deeper? Is there really more to find?

“HUUUUUUUUUAAAAAAHHHHHH!!!”  Echoes up from the opening, louder than ever. I can hear it much clearer now. It’s staticky, like it’s coming from a radio.

I climb down and close the hatch behind me.
