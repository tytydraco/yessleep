I couldn’t believe we actually went to Mardi Gras for John’s bachelor party. It was one of those ideas I thought everyone would always talk about being great, but then realized it would be too expensive and difficult, especially for a bunch of men now in their 30s. 

Like every bachelor party trip I had ever been on, it was multiple days when it should have just been one when you reached our age. Yet, we were in New Orleans for four days and nights and I was fucked, having gotten black out drunk the first night of the trip. I knew I was going to be dehydrated with simmering bubble guts the rest of the fucking time. 

I had lived in the metropolitan of Los Angeles for years, yet having grown up in the woods at the foothills of the mountains in northwest Washington, all of my friends from growing up were a little country and wild. I told my friends in L.A. before I left that going on a bachelor party trip with them was like going to Vietnam. 

I was saddled with “Larrysitting” the second night of the trip. Larrysitting referred to having the responsibility of watching our friend Larry, the craziest of the group, for the night. Larry was one of those short, chubby, red-headed and goateed country guys who seemed to live for always driving everyone crazy.

I genuinely didn’t even like Larry. He was crass, annoying, and not genuine. I only tolerated him because he was the groom and my best friend, John’s, younger brother. 

I followed Larry around the bar on the second night of the trip, the night before Fat Tuesday, trying my best to keep him out of trouble.

Larry latched onto the only woman who would give him the time of day and accept a drink from him. She entertained his antics for a little while, but clearly eventually got bothered and slipped out of the bar. 

I did everything I could to stop Larry, but he followed her out of the bar and into the night.

*Fucking Larry*. I pursued him all the way out to the last street before the end of the French Quarter before I finally caught him. 

“Why do you hate me?” The pathetic words dribbled out of Larry’s fat lips as I spun him around on the sidewalk that was a lot darker than the Bourbon Street one we had left behind.

I suddenly felt uncomfortable. The world of the city we had walked into was a lot different than that of the touristy area. I pleaded with Larry to go back to the bar with me and the guys. 

“There she is!” Larry blurted out and then ran across the street before I could do anything. 

I watched in horror as Larry made it across the street and disappeared into the entrance of a cemetery.

If you Google New Orleans cemetery you’ll see what I followed Larry into - an endless farm of elaborate, soaring gravestones and mini-mausoleums. It would have been a stunning sight had I not been so overcome with anger about Larry. 

I was almost to Larry again when my worst nightmare came true - he had found one of those rental electric scooters and took off on it. The drunken idiot made it about 10 feet before he crashed head right into a gravestone. 

I watched in horror as he destroyed the thing and crashed on top of a stone tomb. 

The old stone turned to dust in some spots, some of it crumbled below his fat frame, some of it skidded all around. Larry himself scraped across the top of the tomb, shredding up the bottom of his palms and splattering blood across the gravesite. 

It was a horrible scene. I took it all in as I chewed out Larry for being such a fucking idiot. 

I was in the middle of realizing we needed to get the fuck out of there when I noticed one thing specific about the grave Larry had destroyed - resting in the wreckage was an intact decoration lying there, a skeleton, with two braids dangling from the back of its head. I couldn’t take my eyes off of the thing. Particularly its eyes, which were painted bright gold. 

I didn’t waste anymore time looking at the wreckage, I gathered Larry and got out. Just went back to the hotel and crashed for the night.

I wanted to kill Larry at breakfast the next day. He just sat there guzzling bloody marys and laughing about what happened the night before. 

I was far less enthused. I was sure there were security cameras in the cemetery or someone saw something and our lives were entirely fucked. 

John convinced me to shake it off though. He ordered me a bloody mary. That combined with each passing moment where there wasn’t fallout from the night before kept me going and feeling better. 

I went into the chaos that was the Fat Tuesday fray and got drunk. Whatever the fallout was going to be from the night before was going to happen either way. I might as well have fun. 

I was having fun until I saw a man at the edge of the crowd - large, face painted like a skeleton, his hair long and tied back in two braids, golden eyes which stared at me. The man couldn’t have looked more like the piece of the grave Larry destroyed the night before.

*And he wouldn’t stop staring at me.* 

It made me think of Larry. *Where was he?* I hadn’t seen him in an hour at least. 

I asked all of the other guys in the group. None of them cared. We had forgotten to designate someone on Larrysitting duty so he was on his own. 

Everyone was more distracted by the gorgeous girls one of the guys in the group was talking to. Apparently the girls had a private party thing on a riverboat they were going to and they definitely weren’t hookers and it definitely wasn’t a setup and we definitely weren’t too drunk to determine those kinds of things or not. 

We got on the boat. It was just like any typical riverboat you would see in Louisiana when we got on. 

*It was when we went inside that things were clearly very different.* 

The inside of the boat I would describe as a speakeasy strip club. There was a quiet bar and good looking women walking around everywhere. I had no idea what we had just stumbled into other than that it seemed like a dream bachelor party setting. 

And things were shockingly low key. We got some drinks and started talking to people, including good looking girls, and it all seemed natural. 

Then again we were all wasted from starting to hammer drinks at 10 a.m. and the drinks on the boat were amazing, but clearly incredibly stiff. I was damn near swaying because I was so tired and wasted - though that may have been from the boat as well. 

I went back to the bar to get a refill when I noticed John slip down a dark hallway with an attractive woman. I didn’t judge. 

Neither did I when I watched the two other guys in the group, both married, slip off. Ironically I was the only one in the group who wasn’t married or engaged yet I was most content with not trying to find a woman, and wanted to be faithful to my girlfriend. 

I just relaxed at the bar and was glad to be out of the Mardi Gras crowd. Things were going great until I looked to the other side of the room and saw the familiar face of the large man with the skeleton face and the braids and the golden contacts in his eyes. 

He didn’t seem to notice me at first and I tried to slip outside without him noticing. 

I wasn’t able to. He locked his eyes onto me and I far too quickly, everyone else started to leave the room. 

In an instant, it was just me and the man with the braids. He slowly moved toward and drew a long blade from his trench coat. 

Simultaneously, my entire body started to turn to JELL-O and my mind started to race back to the night before - when we were on a ghost tour in the French Quarter. We almost got kicked off of it for being obnoxious three times. By “we,” I mostly just mean Larry. 

I was the only one paying attention when we were at an exquisite building on Bourbon Street and the tour guide went into a story about the only church building in the area. He told the tale of a spirit that would lure debaucherous people who went too far and disrespected the city into their control and then torture them. They would offer these scenarios like from the Saw movies where you could get out, but you had to solve some kind of challenge to get you out of the room. 

I was convinced we had fallen into that situation because of Larry destroying the grave. The other guys were all in rooms being tortured and this ghost of the person whose grave Larry had destroyed had killed him and now was about to kill me. 

The braided man was just a few feet from me when I snapped back into reality. The foul stench of death radiated to me as I stood there in the bar area. I could also feel an anger ready to burst out of the braided man as he made those final steps to me. 

What I don’t think the braided man realized was that I wasn’t that drunk at that point. I had slowed down and my mind cleared with him in front of me. 

I thought about the party poppers Larry had given me at breakfast in my pocket which he said to “shoot at fuckers” at Mardi Gras. I listened to Larry for the first time in my life and shot them right in the face of the braided man. 

It stunned him and it gave me time to get to the other item Larry had given me the night before when I was sitting him - a hunting knife. He told me the night before “you never know when you might need it.” He must have either bought it in the city or snuck onto the plane. 

Now I was thankful for Larry’s usually annoying generosity and advice. I slipped the knife out and jabbed it up into the braided man’s pelvic area upon his arrival. 

I watched his gold eyes go wide - totally shocked. I felt hot blood spurt out from him and onto my hand as I twisted the knife in him. 

I whispered into his ear: *“Where are my friends?”*
