I was much like all of you, blissfully unaware of the reality that heaven and hell do exist. It crosses over with our reality far more often than anyone would like to think. 

It was a sunny morning, the light from outside filtering into my living room as i made my way to the kitchen, groggily yearning for a cup of coffee. Then out of the corner of my eye, i spot someone sitting on my couch. As if i was externally controlled, i turned to look at them.

Their face was androgynous in nature, scars adorning it proudly, seemingly from some battle fought long ago. Sharp eyes the color of steel looked back at me as the person made a gesture to take a seat. They were adorned in some tactical uniform, a plate carrier on their chest with the nametape: "Six". 

I asked with a shaky voice: "What in the actual fuck are you doing in my house?" Before i could move to run, a booming voice sounded: "We both know exactly why i'm here, Oz. You've created quite the stir in hell, what with your wrongdoings making national headlines in the living world. I've come to collect your soul, either willingly or with you burning in the worst way imagineable."

I was stunned to say the least. I mean, sure, i had turned a blind eye to my company dumping waste in places where it didn't belong, but i didn't directly do anything that bad....


The person got up and walked towards me, and i felt compelled to resist. I ran towards my bedroom, and took my .45 from the nightstand. I leveled it at the bastard, who started to...to fucking just laugh at me. It took one more step and i fired twice.....to which it advanced upon me and pinned me to the floor...then placed some sort of holy handcuffs upon me. 


I passed out, and when i awoke, i was in front of some receptionist's desk. A feminine figure was sitting at it, red horns raising from her pink skin, her beady black eyes staring at me as if i was one of the worst humans to ever come before her.

"Missus H., you are responsible for the extinction of.....23 species of fish, 2 species of bird, and......a village of 413 people who were the last known indigenous tribe to reside in the states. Am i correct?" She spoke with the voice of a chain smoker, hoarse and raspy.


I stammered out a reply: "H...how am i responsible for that?"

The demon at the desk smiled and looked at me before speaking again: "It was the waste from your company, the items that you ordered to be dumped wherever the employees saw fit. Therefore, you are responsible for it. Really, do you feel any remorse for your acrions?"

I just stared at her, wide-eyed as she grew impatient, scowling at me before speaking once more: "We actually have a use for you. We need someone evil enough to commit such atrocities, for the purpose of assigning torture after your debt is paid.

With that, she sent me down to a pit where my mind and flesh burned for what seemed like an eternity....before i was sat before a desk with a computer...where i type this out as a message to you all...

If there is ever a figure named Six in your home, go with them peacefully. Because while this doesn't sound horrid...i promise you it is. I have to watch each and every person i assign via some sort of demonic camera feed.

And for the love of god.....please don't make my mistakes...go the extra mile if you need to.
