TW: >!Self harm, child harm!<

...


11 days ago I told you a story. 


Many of you asked for a "sequel", and so here it is. I'm not sure how to feel about the suffering of my family causing everyone such excitement. Well I'm sorry to say Christmas did not come and go without incident this year as I so futilely hoped. So everyone who wished more misfortune upon my family so that you could have more to read, congratulations, you got your wish. Merry fucking Christmas. 


Anyhow you're no doubt keen to hear the details. Patience. I should begin by recapping the past year that followed the events of last Christmas. 


If you recall, the events of last year occurred shortly before Christmas in response to my daughter mailing her christmas list "To Satan" instead of to Santa. After my daughter nearly drowned herself and Don died of a heart attack life settled down for a bit. 


Christmas came and went that year. A subdued affair. We did get a visit from the Santa imposter but it was apparently just to deliver gifts, nothing else evil happened. None of them were given to Katie, of course. We'd have to be crazy to let the child have anything sent by this evil lunatic.


We expected a visit from this Santa imposter and so I intended to stay awake and watch all night on Christmas Eve. 


But of course I fell asleep. And low and behold when I woke up in the armchair in dawn's early light I beheld that the imposter had come and gone and left presents. Just as we expected he would.


I checked the hidden camera I set up as a failsafe. 


There he was. Santa, or Satan, or some evil minded imposter, in the flesh. The camera was hidden in the angel atop our tree. I could see the fireplace and the chair I was sitting in all night and the entrance to the room from the camera. 


I watched on my tablet as, at precisely 3AM, the evil bastard came down our chimney and deposited the presents. Somehow I remained asleep in the armchair throughout this. He was Santa, the very image, every cliche of the jolly fat man rolled into one.


Nevermind that I paid a mason to brick up the top of our chimney on the 20th, somehow the bastard came down anyways. There was no damage to the chimney.


This was the first direct confirmation that we were dealing with something that wasn't human. We'd suspected. Katie's blanket referenced the death of Don even though it had been made and packaged well before his death and the cause was perfectly natural. Or so it seemed. 


Anyways I hid the imposter's presents and let Katie open the rest. I told Sam about the visit but we did not tell Katie. She was never going to open those gifts so long as I had a say in it. As Katie opened her legitimate presents nothing untoward happened. 


Reminder, this was last Christmas, the one immediately following the events of "To Satan". This is all buildup to what happened this Christmas, today. I am writing this in a state of shock to prevent myself from doing something dreadful, impulsive. The events I am about to describe are hours old. 


I'll briefly recap the previous year in between these two stories. We got Katie a therapist but achieved few results. Well, we got normalcy at least. She became animated and talkative and happy again, like any little girl. But she would not under any circumstances speak of what happened with the imposter and her attempted suicide. We even tried hypnotherapy. Nothing. 


Troubling was her newfound obsession with Santa. Despite our very best effort Katie has spent this past year utterly infatuated with Santa. Drawings, short stories, plushies that we didn't buy her (we don't know where she got them), non stop babbling. Santa Santa Santa. If not for what happened we would consider it a harmless phase. Given that an imposter of potentially supernatural origins calling itself Santa convinced her to kill herself, this obsession became deeply concerning.


Anyways, there was no letter to Santa this year, which provoked a massive tantrum in which Katie stabbed me with a fork. I am grateful there was nothing more lethal than that within her arms reach, cause she stabbed me hard enough to draw blood. With an ordinary dinner fork a 6 year old girl drew blood. Had it been a knife I'd be dead given she aimed directly for the heart. 


Naturally the days of early December this year were marred by serious discussions of having our budding little psychopath hospitalized. 


On that topic we agreed never to leave William alone with her. In case you're picking up this story midway, that's her baby brother, now a babbling toddler, last year he was an infant. We could not comprehend the thought that she had actually tried to kill him, but given the events we agreed to play it safe just in case the unthinkable had happened and Katie was a murderer.


Now at last, we move to this Christmas. 


This year my precautions against intruders were excessive. I installed a motion detector on our roof directly connected to our home security system, right by the chimney. 


I did not brick over the fireplace itself as the imposter had managed to bypass masonry before, in fact I went ahead and had the mason undo his own work, it hadn't stopped the imposter before so there was no need for it. 


Instead I lit a gas fire in the hearth to burn all night long with the hope it would catch the bastard on fire. 


In addition I slept all day Christmas eve and took two caffeine pills in rhe evening. I was not going to miss the intruder this time. I had my gun loaded and ready and held in my hand as I directly faced the fireplace. 


As a final precaution I had the door and window of the children's bedroom doubly reinforced to be burglar proof and nearly indestructible. Sam, my wife, slept in the room with them as well, armed with pepper spray and a taser. We decided it was a bad idea to keep a gun in the same room as Katie. 


And so last night passed. Christmas Eve 2022, spent in armed vigil, prepared to shoot Santa Clause on sight. 


But I underestimated just how evil the thing we were dealing with was. 


Midway through my long vigil, early this morning in the small hours, I heard a sound that made my heart stop. 


The mail flap in the front door. We had removed our mailbox as another precaution against the imposter stealing or leaving mail. 


The metal hatch creaked and I heard what sounded like a sheet of paper falling to the tile floor of the foyer. 


I rushed to investigate. I threw open the front door, gun straight ahead, not 15 seconds after I heard the creak of the letter flap. Nobody there. I frantically looked around the yard and porch without leaving the doorway. They were either gone or well hidden. 


I shut the door, bolted it once more, and investigated what they had left.


My heart began to pound and I felt the familiar sensation of my blood turning to ice water. It was from them. The handwriting was the same. 


I resumed my post by the still burning fireplace. With shaking hands I began to read the letter.


"Dear Daniel. I noticed you prevented Katie from sending me a letter this year. Why? Without one I have been unable to direct my elves to make her any presents. Therefore my only course of action is to bring her to the North Pole where she can pick out presents from those intended for naughty children who failed to move onto the nice list."


Shit. Shit. Shit. I stopped reading and hurried upstairs. At the top I realized this might have been a trick to get me to abandon my post or undo my security to check on Katie. Calming, I resumed my vigil and instead texted Sam. I knew she'd be awake. 


"Are you and the kids okay?" 


"Yes. Both sleeping. Any visits?" She replied. 


"Yes. A letter. Be on guard."


"Understood."


I resumed reading. 


"Now I understand that you have also prevented Katie from receiving any of my gifts from last year. This is cruel. I cannot abide cruelty. There will be punishment. Assuming you are reading this while sitting in front of your fire with a gun and making things dreadfully inconvenient for me, allow me to deliver one of Katie's denied gifts in a new way. You force me to use my powers in a way I really hate to use them, but sometimes cruel parents have to be removed from a child's life." 


Something fell down the chimney and I leaped to my feet, prepared to fire. It was a parcel, and it lands beside the gas grate where the fire was burning. There was no motion on the roof according to the wall mounted tablet computer in my line of sight besides the hearth. 


Then, something that can only be described as evil magic occurred. The parcel of its own accord jumped out of the fireplace and landed at my feet. 


I kept my gun pointed resolutely at it. I watched with increasing terror as it unwrapped itself. 


It was the blanket. The same one we denied Katie that she recieved as a reward for trying to kill herself at the imposter's direction. We'd tossed it in a dumpster in the next county. She never even saw it. 


This I surmised in the moments before the blanket came to life like an evil magic carpet. 


It unfolded itself and hovered in front of me, showing me that it was indeed the same blanket. Only now there was a new message embroidered below the first.


"One death, one life. Welcome back to the nice list Katie. I’ll see you again next christmas" the first and terribly familiar message said in gold thread. 


Below that, the second. 


"Grown ups can be put on the naughty list too." 


Then, the animated blanket *flew*, soaring like some evil bird. I screamed as it flew at me and instinctively squeezed off a round. The thundering gunshot rang in my ears. I either missed or it didn't do any good. The evil blanket soared over my head and flew towards the stairs.


I chased after it, but it was fast. I watched as it reached the kid's room and slipped in through the gap between the door and the floor. 


I dove and just managed to catch a corner of it before it slipped all the way in. 


"Honey what's happening??" Sam screamed from the other side. I heard William start to cry. 


"Stop the blanket, pin it down!" I shouted. 


It was pulling hard, struggling against my grip. Sam screamed again. I couldn't grip it. It managed to slip out of my fingers and entered the room.


I hastily stood and started fumbling with the locks I installed. They were configured so that they could be unlocked from either side, but Sam could open the door from the inside quickly without a key in case an escape was necessary. 


"Sam get the kids out of there!" I shouted. 


"It's attacking me!" She shouted back. She screamed once more but her cry was cut short by a horrible choking, gagging sound. 


Now screaming myself I hastily unlocked the door. I dared not shoot the locks, my family was in there, and I'd reinforced the door so not even a gorilla could have kicked it in.


Finally I got the door open and the sight I beheld will haunt me for the rest of my life. 


The blanket was wrapped around Sam's neck, throttling her. Katie was watching wide awake, but not screaming or doing anything to help. William was screaming. Sam was dying. 


I rushed to her and began trying to pry the hatefull blanket off of her. It was utter chaos. Sam was thrashing in a panic, the baby was screaming, and the blanket ever tightened its grasp.


Sam hurtled out of the open door, I think to get the blanket farther from the kids. I followed, desperate to save my wife. 


She nearly reached the top of the stairs. I tackled her and pinned her down before she tumbled down the stairs. I needed her to be still so I could get the blanket off. I furiously grasped it and pulled. I wrestled with the blanket and managed to give her enough slack that she was able to take a desperate breath. The blanket would not be defeated however and it tightened to a new extreme and I heard a sickening *crack*. 


Both the blanket and my wife went limp. I pulled it from her and threw it desperately away but it was once more just a blanket. The dark magic that had possessed it was gone.


"Honey… honey I can't feel my legs. I… I can't move my arms." Sam says to me weakly. 


It had broken her neck. 


I clutched her tightly and sobbed. It wasn't fair. Sam didn't deserve this. 


"Honey… the kids…" She said weakly. Her eyes rolled back into her head and she passed out. 


I slowly got to my feet and in a state of numb shock I left my paralyzed wife lying at the top of the stairs. I approached the kid's room with nothing less than primal terror. 


Katie was gone. William remained. 


I dialed 911. I didn't care what the authorities said. In a dead, slow, expressionless voice I told the operator that I needed police and ambulance, that there'd been a home invasion and a kidnapping. I hung up after giving my address. I searched the house, but I knew it would be no good. Katie wasn't there. The blanket was a distraction, a diversion to occupy both parents while the bastard took Katie.


I picked up the letter and sat by Sam's side on the hallway floor. She was breathing but unconscious. 


I finished reading it. 


"Don't worry I'll take good care of her. I'm sorry about what will happen to Sam. But she's on the naughty list, same as you. Her punishment will be living in a broken body. Yours will be knowing that it's entirely your fault that this happened, Daniel. 


I'll bring Katie back next Christmas, assuming you behave yourself in the coming year. Your task to get onto the nice list is to finish the task Katie left unfinished. I need a new elf for my factory and William's soul will do. Drown William in the bathtub and I will return Katie to you as your gift next christmas, to celebrate your own return to the nice list. You have one year.


~Santa."


So now I type this story in a state of numb shock. The police are here. They have questioned me. The paramedics have taken Sam away. I have burned the letter. 


I type this on a tablet computer while crime scene techs and detectives process my house. They think I did it. I don't blame them. Katie is gone. A terror I cannot express fills my very soul. 


My child is missing. Taken by an entity calling itself Santa. Katie is gone. It's a struggle to type every word when 90% of my brain keeps screaming this every three seconds. Katie is gone.


Grandma Susie is talking to a social worker on my behalf, I am unable to speak more than two words in real life. I type these words now as the authorities decide whether or not to arrest me. I think that they are letting me type this so that I incriminate myself. Maybe they are hoping this is a very long confession.


When they read it they will no doubt see it as evidence that I have completely lost my marbles. My only hope is that Susie may vouch for me and directs them to read the first story as well. Either way it doesn't look good. I don't expect I'll be free for long.


It's for the best. I don't trust myself. I confess that the imposter's offer is tempting in a perverse way I can't describe. I'm on the naughty list. All I have to do to get Katie back is to… drown her baby brother. The thought makes me sick but as I type these words I cannot help but consider the offer.


That's it. I'm going to tell the police to take me into custody. Susie can care for William. Raise him, if need be. I'm not going to put my family in danger.


You'll likely never hear from me again. If you read this, I once more warn you about the entity calling itself Santa. I am convinced now that it really is Satan. The blanket was all the proof I need.


Maybe next christmas I will have another story to tell. Until then, farewell.
