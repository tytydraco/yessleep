The shadows across the street seemed strange. Too dark, especially for this time of day. I looked at the shadows in the house- same thing. I went to the kitchen, where my wife stood, staring out the window.  
  
“It looks weird outside,” I said. “It’s the middle of July and the sun is out, but it’s dark. So dark. You notice that?” She shook her head, as if exiting a trance.  
  
“No, dinner’s not ready yet,” she said, looking at me, confused and bleary-eyed. I raised one eyebrow.  
  
“Did you just hear anything I said?” I asked. She looked through me with a thousand-yard stare that sent chills down my spine. I looked around, wondering what the hell was going on.  
  
“Are you drunk or something? Is this a joke? It’s not very funny if it is,” I said. She smiled, a dullard’s smile.  
  
“Not very funny,” she echoed, her eyes still blank. I took a few steps back, staring at her as I did, then I turned and walked quickly out of the room.  
  
Should I call a doctor? Was she having a stroke? I had no idea what to do. Everything outside seemed strange, too, which made me wonder… wonder what? I couldn’t connect the pieces. It felt like the overarching picture existed in my subconscious, but wouldn’t rise to the top until it could be made small enough to understand.  
  
I pulled my cell phone out of my pocket and called my elderly mother. She answered on the seventh ring.  
  
“Mom?” I said into the phone. “Hey, Mom?” A hiss of static blared out of the phone, and the line went dead. I frowned, looking down. The time had changed. I knew it was only about 2:30 PM on a Saturday, but my phone said 7:77 PM. The dates kept flicking up and down rapidly, the years changing in the span of a moment, so that only the time stayed constant.  
  
“They don’t want you to call,” my wife said from behind me, her voice still sounding drugged and slow. “We’re trapped here, you and me. With the shadows and the ones above. Before feeding, you pen in the animals. Before slaughter, you keep it in the stall. We’re in the stall now, you and me, together until they come down and end it.”  
  
“I don’t like all this cryptic bullshit,” I said, exploding at her. “What the fuck are you even talking about? I’m leaving.” My heart started racing, and I walked towards the door, grabbing my keys on the table.  
  
“That’s a bad idea, Jay,” she said, her voice still calm and unperturbed. “You won’t get far…” That was the last thing I heard as I slammed the door behind me, fuming, wanting to drive a hundred miles an hour down the highway with some music blaring and let off some steam.  
  
I lit up a cigarette as I got in the car, a very fast, very new Camaro. Starting the engine with a roar, I ignored the strange shadows, their pools of black liquid sucking in everything around.  
  
As I drove, the car started to act strange, and soon, the engine began to sputter and die. I had gone only a couple miles, but I tried to put my hazards on and pull over. The hazards didn’t work. The car ran out of electricity and rolled to a stop on the grassy shoulder of the road. I slammed the steering wheel with my hands a few times.  
  
“Fuck!” I said. “Dammit!” I checked my phone. It said I had full bars. I took out my wallet, looking for my AAA card. After finding it, I called the number on it for towing.  
  
But like before, the phone rang, someone seems to have picked up, and then the metallic shrieking and static started blaring. I pulled the phone away from my ear, wincing. The call dropped and I looked at the phone with disgust.  
  
“I spent $1000 on this stupid phone,” I said to myself, looking around for passing cars to help me. Usually this road had some traffic, but today it seemed dead. In fact, I hadn’t seen a single other human being since I had left the house- not a car, or a man mowing his lawn, or a woman walking her dog. Not a damn thing. It seemed wrong somehow. I didn’t exactly live in a bustling city, but we had people here, and on beautiful days, people usually went out.  
  
The humming started from above, and I looked up. I saw skeletal bodies, floating in the wind. Their flesh hung in strips from their face and chests, and I could see exposed bone through the deep cuts slashed into their skin.  
  
I made a small gasping sound and tried to start the car. The engine didn’t respond. So I got out and started running.  
  
It would be miles back to the house, but I had nowhere else to go. I could try the police station, I knew, but if everyone was acting strange, I doubted it would help.  
  
The flying figures didn’t seem to follow me, but floated in the wind, separating and coming back together, holding hands and dancing in the sky. The darkness of the shadows deepened as more and more covered our town. By the time I got back to the house, I felt the shade had a physical presence, thick and cloying over my skin. The sun seemed far dimmer.  
  
“Ella?” I yelled into the house, looking for my wife. She had gone, apparently. The house lay empty and lifeless. But drops of blood in the kitchen that led out the side door had me worried. It started as just one drop, then a few, then dozens. By the time I got outside, I found a torrent of blood, but it stopped suddenly, as if the person had been whisked away as soon as they went out the door.  
  
I started panicking, but then I heard a voice from behind me. I turned, seeing Ella, still looking confused with wide, staring eyes. She had no blood on her.  
  
“What… whose blood is this?!” I asked. “What happened when I left?”  
  
“The neighbor, Mr. Feld,” she said, “he came over to ask about if I had seen anything in the sky. I said no, but would you like some tea? He got mad and left, but his nose started bleeding, and when he walked out the door… they grabbed him. I don’t know where he is now.” She pointed up towards the sun. “Up there, dancing with the rain men, I guess.”  
  
At times like this, I wished I had bought a gun. I grabbed a large knife from the kitchen, wondering what good it would do if what she said was true. I didn’t know the power of these creatures, or what they could do from the sky.  
  
“You shouldn’t fight it,” Ella said. “It’s peaceful and blissful, like floating away… just give in, before the shadows come out fully, and the nighttime dance begins.” I heard a crashing in front of the house, and moving to the front door, I saw three of the skeletal beings standing there, their eyelids missing from their face, their bulging eyes staring in the front window. I could see the skin hanging in strips from their hands and arms, the decay setting in as their bodies fell apart.  
  
One grabbed the doorknob, and started to come inside.
