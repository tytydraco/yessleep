When I was a kid I lived in a small town outside Toronto. My town has been linked to some pretty haunting things that give it a bad name but Yellow Creek still remains a pretty and safe secluded small town even after what happened 20 years ago.

When i was younger I had a very unhealthy obsession with stuffed animals. Now everyone had stuffed animals as a kid but for me many would say I had to many. Like most kids I played with all of them and had my favorites.

My favorite of course was the giant stuffed panda bear I had that sat on my homemade shelf where all the others sat. This stuffed bear sat in the middle because of its size and it was certainly not hard to miss.

Late one night I remember waking to the sound of footsteps in my room, this was not unusual as my dad would often come in to check for dirty clothes I may have left on the floor or just to simply make sure that I was truly sleeping i did like to stay up late after all.

However, that night I wish i had stayed asleep because nothing could have prepared me for what i saw. There in the far corner of my room I saw it sitting there very much alive and moving around was the giant stuffed panda bear.

I attempted to scream but nothing came out it was as if my body was in a paralyzed state of shock. The bear turned to me and whispered "I'm gonna kill you" a smile came across the stuffed bears face as he said this. Shaking and now covered in urine my 9 year old self managed to finally move jumping from my bed past the demonic stuffed panda and down to my parents room where my dad was actually awake.

Stumbling through my parents bedroom door out of breathe i screamed "my stuffed animal is alive its alive help." my dad looked at me for a second rubbing his eyes and yawning before saying "Junior go back to bed you had a bed dream that is all it was a dream its okay there is nothing in your room that is going to hurt you."

I looked at him with teary eyes and muttered "but there is it is trying to kill me" my mom who had work in an hour was awake at this point hugging me and asking me if i was ok. "He is fine Maggie go back to sleep" my dad said starting to get frustrated "there is clearly something that upset him Dave come on sweetie lets get you cleaned up and back to bed"

I followed my mom into the bathroom where i cleaned up and followed her back to my room. However, when I got back in my room and the stuffed panda was just as I had left it the afternoon before sitting up right and untouched.

My mom tucked me in and kissed my forehead as i placed my head back down on my pillow to go back to sleep.

The next day came and went and it was that time again to brush my teeth and get into bed. I can't remember a time when i was more scared to get into bed and close my eyes than i was in that moment.

Laying in bed all I could do was stare at that shelve waiting and knowing it was going to move again. I eventually fell asleep however I wasn't asleep long. Once again I found myself awaking to the sound of someone or something being in my room.

I attempted to sit up in my bed and when I did I was met with the sight of red glowing eyes of my stuffed panda this time holding a knife "I told you I'm gonna kill you" with one swift motion the stuffed panda drove the blade into my leg turning it and twisting it into my flesh.

I screamed in pain and agony as the blade pierced my skin, I threw my body around trying to shake him off of me. Just like that it was over my parents were in the room at this point and the stuffed pandas were back on the shelf as if it had never left its spot.

I tried explaining it to my parents as if they would even begin to understand and all my parents could say to me was that it would be okay. They took me to the hospital and i was treated for the gash on my leg. All I really remember from this was that i had to also talk to some strange man I had never met before and tell him about my dreams.

I was to young to understand it at the time but my parents had told the hospital that i stabbed myself in a fit of rage triggered by stress. We did eventually return home and when we did the stuffed panda was destroyed and burned as I couldn't bare the sight of it anymore.

It has been 20 years and my family no longer lives in the area or owns any property's out in Yellow Creek. Until this day 20 years later I still can't sleep properly or step foot into any toy stores. My Daughters birthday is coming up and she asked for a stuffed bear and I said yes.
