*Always bring a high-intensity discharge flashlight on hauls down Route 333. If one is forgotten or cannot be obtained, one will be provided to you at the beginning of each shift. Likely, you will not need it.*

*Occasionally, you will.*

Quick recap from last week: I just assaulted Randall in his office, broke his nose (no regrets), and learned that management has been sacrificing us employees to Route 333 for years. Older truckers were getting intentionally lane-locked so us newer truckers could travel freely. 

Oh, and it turned out headquarters was located on the edge of Route 333 this whole time.

Also, something was lurking outside in the darkness.

Am I missing anything?

“Whose dumb idea was it to build the truck yard on the highway?” I whispered.

Randall and I crouched behind a desk in the main lobby. The only light came from the blue screen of the receptionist’s monitor and stars barely visible above the far-off treeline. The blackness beyond the front windows was perfectly tranquil.

*For now.*

“That’s what you’re worried about?” Randall hissed.

“If whatever’s out there is going to eat us, I’d at least enjoy the comfort of blaming somebody.”

“It had to be this way. Nothing can communicate across the barrier between Route 333 and the real world. This is the only place dispatch could radio you on the road.”

“Funny. I just spent a week without a radio, and I’m fine.”

“Not to mention, we’d have nowhere to store the impossibilities.”

“What? Is there some sort of secret bunker under the ground?” I laughed.

He remained silent.

“Oh my gosh, there *is* a secret bunker!”

“The longer the impossibilities spend in the real world, the more they unravel it. I risk my life every day coming here to work. You should be grateful.”

“Oh yeah. Positively weeping with gratitude―quick question, what was that you said earlier about sacrificing us to the road?”

Randall made a low guttural noise and whirled on me. “*Look,* Brendon! I get that you’re angry. I do, okay? And yet, right now, I’m the one with a messed up nose, and somehow I’m setting that aside, because there is a *thing* outside. Likely, it’s searching for a way to cut all electricity. Pretty soon, it will find one. Let’s postpone discussing how much we hate each other until after, yeah?”

It was nothing I hadn't already gotten from Randall for weeks. Postponing. Redirecting my questions. False promises of answers that he would never give. As it happened, though, this was the one time that he might actually have a point.

I forced myself to exhale. My shoulders relaxed. “What do we need to do?”

“The lights outside. We have to get them back on. The breaker must have tripped when janitorial was here earlier with the vacuums. It should be self-resetting, but I’m guessing it’s broken. We’ll have to manually do it.”

“We don’t, like, check that regularly? This seems like a big deal.”

“Usually yes, but we’ve been scrambling to find a replacement for you this week.”

I held back multiple snide comments. “Fine. A breaker isn’t bad. Where’s the control panel for the streetlights?”

“Behind the building. Outside.”

“Delightful. And we can’t just cross over to the regular world until the morning? Fix the lights then? We’re already near the boundary.”

He shook his head. “It could follow us over. The road-dwellers don’t have an issue passing across. It just usually takes them a while to get here. The only thing keeping this one from leaving years ago was the streetlights. If we don’t get them back on, it will escape.”

Still crouching, Randall pulled open the drawers of the receptionist desk one by one and rifled through them. He pulled something small and cylindrical from one and handed it to me. A penlight.

“You shouldn’t need it, but just in case. Light should keep it at bay.”

I clicked it on and off. A thin light lit up the space beneath the desk. Not much but something.

“When I say go, you turn on the lights in here,” he said. “It should get distracted watching you, but it shouldn’t be able to attack while they’re on. I’ll run for the back.”

The plan sounded reasonable enough. I nearly said *yes.* Me in here, in the light? Safe? Sounded great. 

And yet…

“You distract it,” I said. “I’ll go flip the breaker.”

“Now’s not the time to be noble, Brendon.”

I let out a laugh the temperature of ice. “I trust big insurance more than I trust you. If I’m the one flipping the breaker, I know you’re incentivized to keep me alive until that thing’s gone. Otherwise, you’ll sacrifice me to save yourself.”

“You’d be safer in here.”

“So you say, but there’s always a catch with you, isn’t there?”

“You don’t even know where the fuse box is.”

“I do actually. I notice things. Just give me the keys.” I glanced purposefully where they dangled from his belt.

“Why do you have to make everything―”

We cut off when, for one brief *glorious* moment, the outside streetlights came on all by themselves. The illumination through the windows grew brighter and brighter.

*No*, I realized. *Not streetlights at all.*

Headlights.

A red SUV pulled into a spot near the doors. Lights flooded the front lobby, then all at once, switched off, leaving us momentarily blind. A car door *thumped* closed. 

“*No.*” Beside me, Randall sprang for the lobby lights, but it was too late.

Gloria approached the entrance, fiddling with a set of keys. Before she could reach them, darkness congealed around her. It came from everywhere and nowhere at the same time, a cloud of dust suddenly sentient. She opened her mouth to scream, but no sound came out. Instead, the darkness poured down her throat like oil into the engine.

She scrabbled at her neck, but how did you fight the air itself? Her skin puffed outwards. She was a balloon filling with water. Gloria’s movements slowed, until she just stood there, arms outstretched, expression vacant. 

The lobby lights flashed on but too late. The blackness pouring into her had already been slowing.

The grinding began. 

As much as I hate it, there’s only one word that describes what came next with any sort of justice: *blender.* It was the crunching, whirring scream of solid things being made liquid. Like a blender, her outer body maintained its shape, even while the insides ground themselves up. Eventually, she turned to the side, opened her mouth, and released a long stream of what had *used* to be her insides. Red. Chunky. Fragments of splintered bone intermixed.

She straightened back into her original shape.

*It must be dark* *underneath that skin.* The new Gloria turned to us. Her eyelids were closed to hold out the light.

She drew out her keys.

“Go!” shouted Randall, but I needed no encouragement. I sprang at him, ripped his own keys from his belt loop, and dashed away. The lobby doors crashed open behind me. Predictably―because my luck is oh so wonderful―it was me the footsteps followed.

“Randall went the other way,” I called back helpfully.

It was a strange reversal of situations. Just minutes ago *I* was the one chasing someone down these stairs. Now, I was the one being chased up them. I must say, I preferred the former.

As I ran, I switched on all the lights. I didn’t care if the thing was now confined inside a body. It could still come out at any time.

The new Gloria seemed to have a similar idea. Behind me, glass shattered and hallways went black. My escape routes were shrinking.

“No really,” I called. “Randall’s a much easier a target. Even I can take him.”

She wasn’t interested.

I fumbled with the breakroom lightswitch. It took me too long to find it in the dim, and Gloria pounced at me. Her nails raked my face and arms. I tried to scramble away, but she wrapped herself around my leg. Her teeth sank into my calf.

“Mother trucker!” I kicked in her head―not *at* her head, mind you. *In.* It literally caved inwards.

For one, beautiful moment I thought I’d killed her. Then the dent popped right back out. *Right*. She was only skin now.

My pathways were limited now. I had to get outside. That much was obvious, but how? She was on my tail. The only other staircase to get downstairs would force me across already darkened hallways. My pulse pounded. My lungs begged. I couldn’t last much longer. I passed Randall’s office.

An idea struck me.

It was already dark in the room from when Randall had exploded the overhead lightbulb, but the hallway was illumination enough to ward off complete darkness. I flung myself at the desk.

*Where is it? Where is it…?*

Gloria rammed into me. I tried shoving her off, but her mouth latched onto my neck. She tore into my flesh. I bellowed, and collapsed―

*There!* 

Fallen underneath the desk, sprinkled with broken glass, was the boxcutter from earlier. I snatched it and stabbed backward at Gloria’s face. I pulled down with the clean ripping sensation of scissors through paper.

She fell off me, clasping at her head. Blackness writhed behind the gash in her face. Her hands pinched the skin, trying and failing to hold herself together. Roils of darkness spilled from the gaps. I drove the boxcutter into her leg and tore upwards. Her mouth opened, but no sound came out. There was nothing tangible beyond her open jaws. She clutched her leg too, but the endeavor was like keeping water in a Ziploc bag with multiple holes.

I didn’t wait to see what happened next.

No longer did I bother with the lights. My feet carried me through the hall, down the stairs, and out the back door.

There it was. The electrical box illuminated by an orange moon―a *false* moon I now knew.

My trembling hands fumbled with the ring of keys. Which was it?

I tried one. No use. I tried the next. Still, it didn’t work. Above me a window shattered. A cloud of dust exploded out into the night.

*Not yet!* I needed more time.

“Forget this.” I tossed the keys to the ground and yanked at the metal panel to the breaker box. Surely, I could tear the flimsy thing open. It rattled. It pried apart at my force…

The blackness descended on me.

I fumbled for my penlight and shone it out. The dim light did almost nothing. The cloud avoided the direct light, but there were so many angles, and I couldn’t cover all of them. It was no use.

My eyes squeezed shut. My mouth clamped down. I used my index fingers to plug my ears, and my thumbs to cover my nostrils. I waited for the force of a thousand pounds of sand to slam into me, but it never came. Instead, the dark was a breeze on my neck, lighter than pillow fluff. 

It had nowhere to enter, and yet it surrounded me. The coldness slithered around my hands, searching, hunting for a path *in.* It didn’t need to burrow into me; I got the sense it couldn’t. All it had to do was wait until I gave in and peeked with one eye or opened my mouth to breathe. 

For those of you out there who are experienced in the art of holding your breath, I applaud you. That’s never been my talent though. In high school, I joined the swim team for all of two weeks, before realizing that, *oh wait, humans don't actually have gills, thank you very much.*

On a good day, my record is maybe, *maybe,* a minute? Less perhaps? Believe me, during the few chances I've timed myself, I start out with good intentions―strength of will, fortitude of character, ‘what if there’s a flash flood in my apartment?’, etcetera―but it’s always somewhere around second forty I begin considering *alternative* ways to build character.

Even right then, with the embodiment of a blender congealing around me, I could feel myself slipping―and why did it matter? In the end, this being was the blackness that had existed since before our planet formed. It had waited a billion years to feel the warmth of living organs. No matter how long I lasted, it could last longer.

*Don’t.* 

*Don’t open your mouth.* 

*Do not breathe.*

And then, I did.

For one terrible moment, the coldness flooded in, past my lips and toward my throat. It thrummed with excitement. A vessel to move freely―it would take better care of me than the last one.

Lights exploded in front of me. The darkness burst outwards in all directions in a mad bid to escape. I gasped.

“The breaker!” Randall screamed. He gestured frantically from the cab of my own truck where he'd blasted the headlights.

I wasted no time. It took only two keys this time before the lock twisted and the panel flew open. As for the breakers, I flipped them all at once. Immediately, familiar streetlights flared to life, filling the entire truck yard with wonderful, life-sustaining light.

From there everything went hazy. Between the adrenaline, minutes without oxygen (okay, fifty seconds), and my sleep deprivation from the past week, reality turned kaleidoscopic. I do remember an arm around my shoulder as someone led me inside and up the stairs.

“My office!” they said.

Guess he found Gloria.

“I did try to help her, you know.”

I looked up from the breakroom table. It was several hours later, and I sipped a cup of coffee. I hadn't wanted to risk the drive home. Things hadn't felt quite *real* enough to trust myself behind a wheel, so I’d slept a few hours in my rig. Now, it was early morning.

Randall stood in the doorway. His nose was splinted from what I could tell with some sort of aluminum strip. It reminded me of those metallic bracelets from elementary school that curl when you slap them around your wrist but go rigid when you straighten them.

“I saw,” I told him. “There was nothing you could have done for Gloria. She arrived too quickly.”

“Not Gloria. Tiff.”

He poured himself a cup from my coffee pot, then immediately spit it out. “This is practically water.”

“It’s my third cup. Thought I should slow down.”

He dumped it, set a new batch to brew, and took a seat across from me.

“We were drivers at the same time,” he said. “Me and Tiff.  Bet you didn’t know that, huh? That I used to be a driver too. All of us were at one point. Even Gloria. It’s not just like you can hire somebody to do what I do right off the bat. How would you ever explain all of…*this* to them.” He waved his hand vaguely in front of him as if to imply I should know exactly what ‘*this’* was that he was referring to.

I did. To be fair.

“We’d chat over the radio,” he continued. “Even after I moved into a dispatch position. Sometimes for hours. When she lane-locked, I was just like you. It tore me up. I searched for ways to get her out, but―”

“We’re not doing this,” I said.

“Doing what?”

“You’re trying to humanize yourself. Don’t. We’re not chummy because we escaped the same traumatic event. Just because you can prove you’ve ever had feelings doesn’t excuse what you and the rest of management are doing, so stop. Just stop.”

Randall stared at me. He shut off the gurgling coffee pot, sat back down, and sipped from his own mug in contemplation.

“Fine then.” The corners of his lips pulled into a sneer, and he slammed his elbows on the table. “*Here’s* how things are. You saw that thing out there? The one that turned Gloria into a human smoothie? There’s hundreds of those things out there in the real world, some sentient, some not, but all that destroy just as easily. There’s no killing them. There’s no reasoning with them or locking them up. There’s only the road.”

He leaned toward me with an utter look of disgust. “It’s wrong what we do. It’s unjustifiable, and it’s despicable. When Route 333 marks one of you to get lane-locked, we do nothing to stop it. Sometimes, we even encourage that person to go on extra long hauls to help things along, because we’ve learned if the road doesn’t get what it wants, there are consequences for the rest of you. It’s abhorrent what we do. That’s what I’ve heard for years, but you know the one thing I haven’t ever heard? A better solution.” 

He tilted his head. “Please, Brendon, do tell me yours?”

I stayed quiet.

“Thought so.”

I wanted to rage like last night. I wanted to scream and threaten and punch. All the fight was gone, though. I was exhausted. The hate simmering in me toward Randall―I couldn’t seem to locate it anymore.

He paused at the door. “You’re right. We aren’t chummy now. I don’t expect you to forgive me. I certainly don’t plan to forgive you.” He pointed at his nose. “But I will ask that you stay as a driver for a while longer. You know what’s at stake now. Don’t give up.”

He left.

I laughed.

Don’t give up?

Randall clearly had. Tiff had too. Everybody I knew seemed to have given up in some major way, and I was no exception. Taking this job was me doing that very thing in regards to my old life, so where did I go from here? How did I give up my ‘giving up’?

I couldn’t.

That was the truth of it. The choice wasn’t in my hands anymore. Even with this new, terrible knowledge, I simply had to stay. I had to find a better solution.

That’s what I’d announced to the road weeks ago, wasn’t it? That I would help Tiff―right before it attempted to drown me to prove a point. At the time I’d taken it as a threat, and it was. Of course it was. But it was something else too.

Why would Route 333 have cared to warn me off unless there was something to warn me off *from*? This was Randall all over again. I’d only known he was hiding some terrible secret because it was obvious he was also hiding *less* terrible things.

The road tried to stop me from helping Tiff because there was, in fact, a way to do so, and I was close.
