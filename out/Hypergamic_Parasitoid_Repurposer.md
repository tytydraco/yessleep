The worst part was that I kind of liked it, in the end. The feeling of having this inferior creature worm itself into my body, corrupt it cell by cell, and remake me – or at least part of me – into something more suitable for its continued development. To be undone by something so ostensibly inconsequential, so physically feeble; it was violation, sure. But it was also...relief? To be so helpless, to know that all my brawn and might was useless against something that couldn’t even support itself above the surface of the Earth; something that had not once aspired or built or conquered. Once I understood what was happening, once I knew that I’d *lost*, I accepted my fate and reveled in the physiological submission.  

*What am I, after all? Just meat in motion.*   

My left leg was taken first. It was initially terrifying, to see the limb broken down, deconstructed on a cellular level; the skin flaking and falling away in sheets, the muscle peeling off in dry, withered strips; the bone crumbling into fine powder and intermingling with the sand of the beach I’d been resting on for hours. Somehow, the thing had absorbed the blood, had used it to fuel the subsequent process of dematerialization. And from the veritable ashes of the appendage arose its abominable replacement – that monstrous preview of what I’d soon become. Beyond me, oblivious to my organic usurpation, beachgoers danced and played. I had chosen a spot far away from others, wanting to be left alone. From self-isolation to organic conversion.  

The obliteration of my groin and pelvis was – unlike my leg – quite agonizing, and carried a certain visual horror that I needn’t elaborate on. I nearly lost consciousness here, more so from the gruesomeness of the event, than the pain of it. Still, I held on, my psyche not yet broken; my human stubbornness not yet defeated.  

To see your own viscera fade and wither, to watch your ribs collapse and disintegrate – it’s fucking unreal. Even as my exposed lungs desperately pumped air, even as my heart arrhythmically worked itself, I couldn’t believe it. It wasn’t until the dust of my intestines flooded my throat, choking me, that I accepted the ultra-morbidity.  

The end of the nightmare and my subsequent (though short-lived) bliss came when the thing was just about to complete its formation and my destruction. Two had nearly become one: a lesser thing grafted onto a greater one in monstrous hypergamy. *A marriage of man and mutilator.*  

I welcomed its mindless inspection of my body, encouraged it to feel around, to test out what it had made with the dust of my organs. It bubbled within and without, coursed freely through what remained of my veins. Necrotic one moment, flourishing the next, this biological necromancy seemed almost divine in the plentiful scope of sunlight. There seemed to be a supernal aura about *our* body, an emanation of death-wrought grace.  

**Abysmally beatific.**  

 Its *interpretations* of concepts like legs and genitals and nipples pulsed in response to the breeze and the sunlight. Ghastly sense-organs convulsed and trilled as they dumbly received an influx of unprecedented sensations. Things I’d never seen before, things I couldn’t place in any known morphology, sprouted from my abdomen, blossomed from my chest. Genetic manifestations so far beyond my comprehension that my mind merely regarded them as non-existent; deleting them the visual data my eyes had fed it. It was obscene, terrifying, yet marvelous.  

But when our minds met, when it was able to feel all that I’d felt, to experience anew all that I’d experienced as a human, it *recoiled.* It had existed for eons in some preserved pocket of the earth, this primordial force of parasitic life. Had subsisted or slumbered without responsibility, without the need to perform any tasks or chores or duties. Somehow, I’d disturbed it, or maybe it had been waiting for someone to come along. But upon tasting my mind and learning of what Human life is like, it fled from me. *Abandoned me.*  

Either purposely or automatically, it rebuilt what it had destroyed; restored me as easily as it had unmade me. I was left a steaming mess of fresh, throbbing flesh; newborn from the neck down. An errant breeze swept across the beach and I seized up; my bare skin hyper-sensitive, as if I’d never once stepped outside, or as if I'd just been ejected from some alien womb.  

I watched it seep back into the earth with sorrow in my heart. I could’ve been free of this life and its soul-eroding tedium. But now, I must go to work tomorrow—and the next day, ad infinitum.  

So, I guess you could say that I “won”. But at what cost?
