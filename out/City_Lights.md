I sat near the edge, watching the world passing by, contemplating whether or not it would make a difference. The world will keep spinning, the cars will keep driving. Nobody would be bothered, might as well just get it done. I close my eyes to feel the cold air whip against my face, I take one long, deep breath and prepare to throw myself off the edge.

“What brings you around here?” I hear a soft delicate voice say, I turn around to find a girl sitting next to me, her legs dangling off the edge of the building, a loose white dress flowing in the air around her. I had no idea where she'd come from, was I truly so tangled up in my sorrow that I failed to notice a whole other person next to me? 

“Same as you, I suppose” I say, I don't know why. I had no clue what brought her here, for all I know she was a passerby on the ground, that saw some crazy person hanging off the edge of a building, but I could tell, somehow, that we were one and the same. 


“That's an awful reason to be up here don't you think?” She replies kindly, a hint of self effacing humor in her voice.

“You're up here too aren't you?”

“Yes, I am, I guess.” 

We sit in silence for a few moments, just watching the cars whiz past us on the ground below.  A sense of understanding wafting through the air between us.

“It's a beautiful night, isn't it?” The girl speaks up after some time.

I look quizzically at her, why must she make conversation? I stay quiet.

“Not much for small talk?” She asks. I meet her with silence. 

I stay quiet, waiting for the girl to grow tired of me, hoping she'd leave me to my thoughts, But she doesn’t. Instead, she leans back on her hands, gazing up at the sky.

"You ever wonder about the stars?" she asks softly, almost as if she’s talking to herself. "They’re so far away, yet somehow they feel close. Almost like they’re watching."

I follow her gaze, my eyes landing on the scattered pinpricks of light above. I hadn’t really thought about the stars in a long time. They were just there, part of the backdrop, like everything else in this world that I had tuned out. But now, with her question hanging in the air, I can’t help but stare at them.

"Watching what?" I finally ask, surprising even myself with the sound of my own voice.

She smiles at that, a small, knowing smile. "Us. This world. Our struggles, our pain, our little moments of joy. Maybe they're just there to remind us that there’s more to everything than what we see. More than just… this."

I shake my head. "That sounds stupid." I let out a low, sarcastic chuckle.

"Does it?" she asks, not offended, just curious. "Maybe it is, but it’s something to think about. Something that distracts you from all of it." She gestures vaguely at the edge, the street below, the city lights.

Her words settle between us, and for a second, I feel something stir inside me—something I’d buried deep, far away from the weight that had been pressing on me for so long, but just as quickly as it rises, I push it back down. I can’t afford to feel anything else.

"Why are you really up here?" I ask her, shifting the focus. "You don’t seem like me."

She glances at me sideways, her expression hard to read. "Maybe I’m not. But it doesn’t mean I don’t understand. You ever feel like there’s this heavy fog all around you, and no matter how much you try, you can’t see through it? Like you’re trapped inside it, and you’re not even sure what’s on the other side anymore?"

I nod, the weight of her words hitting too close to home.

"Yeah," I admit quietly. "All the time."

She looks back at the sky, her voice soft and distant. "That’s why I’m here. Trying to see if there’s something beyond it. Or if it’s all just… fog."

The silence stretches out again, but this time it’s not as heavy. There’s something different in the air now, something fragile but present, like a thin thread of connection between us.

We sit there for what feels like hours, just the two of us in this strange, quiet bubble above the noise of the city. I don’t know why I haven’t moved yet, why I haven’t done what I came here to do. Maybe it’s because of her. Maybe it’s the way she talks, like she understands things I’ve never let myself admit. Or maybe it’s because for the first time in a long time, I don’t feel so alone.

The girl sighs softly and stands, stretching out her arms. “Well, I think it’s time for me to go.”

I look up at her, confused. “Go? Where?”

She smiles again, that same sad, knowing smile. “Home, I guess.”

I feel a strange panic rise in my chest. I don’t want her to leave. Something about her makes everything seem... lighter. "Wait," I blurt out. "Why did you really come here? You never answered me."

She hesitates for a moment, her gaze dropping to the edge of the building. “I told you. Same as you.”

Something in the way she says it makes my skin prickle. I stand up, facing her fully now. “But you’re still here. You didn’t… jump.”

Her smile falters slightly, and she looks away, her voice dropping to a whisper. “No. I didn’t.”

She throws a warm look my way, before dusting off her dress and heading towards the stairwell, and just like that, she's gone. Just as fast as she appeared, she's gone.

I sit for a little while longer, just looking down at the street. I cant help but wonder if these people, these strangers, feel the fog too. Do they ever go to sleep and pray to never wake up?  
Have they ever sat on rooftops with strange girls delaying the inevitable?

I don't know what exactly happened between the time I came up here and now, no clue what exactly changed, but I find myself dreading it. I take a moment to myself, to breathe in the crisp air, to feel it go into my lungs and out my nose, to listen to the bustling sounds of life below. I feel the concrete ledge beneath my fingers, the seams of my jeans against my skin. I am here, right now. I am a breathing, living person, taking up space in the world, and maybe that's not all that bad.

I step away from the ledge, the city stretching out before me in the stillness of the night. My heart is still racing, but it’s not from fear anymore. It’s from something else. Maybe hope.

I don’t even know why I’m walking back down the stairs. A part of me had been so sure I wouldn’t be coming down at all. But something about her—her presence, her words—had changed everything. The fog in my mind wasn’t gone, not completely, but it wasn’t all-consuming anymore.

By the time I reach the bottom of the building and step back onto the crowded streets, I feel lighter, like a weight has been lifted, even if just for now. The girl’s face stays with me. The way she appeared out of nowhere, the strange calm in her voice. I wonder where she went. Why she left so suddenly. I think about calling out for her but realize how ridiculous that would sound in the middle of the city. I don't even know her name.

As I walk through the streets, I pass by a small café. It’s quiet, almost empty, with just a few people inside. For some reason, I feel drawn to it. I step inside and order a coffee, needing to sit for a moment and gather my thoughts.

While waiting for my drink, I notice an older man sitting at the counter, chatting with the barista. His voice is low but carries enough for me to catch bits of the conversation. Something about the rooftop nearby catches my attention.

"That rooftop… gives me chills every time I pass it," the old man says, shaking his head. "It’s the spot, you know? That girl—she jumped off it ten years ago today."

My blood runs cold. I freeze in my seat, my mind scrambling to keep up with what I’ve just heard. The rooftop? Ten years ago?

"What girl?" the barista asks, looking curious.

"Ah, you’re too young to remember," the man says, his voice growing quieter. "She was young. Seventeen, maybe, beautiful girl. People said she was troubled, but no one really knew why. One night, she went up there and… well, she jumped. Poor thing didn’t stand a chance."

My stomach drops, the edges of my vision blurring as the words sink in. Seventeen years old. The rooftop. My mind races back to the girl I’d just spoken to, the way her dress flowed, the way her eyes seemed to see straight through me.

The girl I had just met was dead.

I feel like the floor is tilting beneath me, and I grip the edge of the table to steady myself. How was that even possible? I’d spoken to her. She’d sat right next to me, talked to me, saved me.

My mind whirls with questions, but I can’t shake the truth. The girl on the rooftop—the one who’d convinced me to step away from the edge—wasn’t alive. She was a ghost. She had been gone for ten years.

The barista gives the old man a pitiful look. “The world can be so cruel at times, can't it?”

I push my coffee aside, suddenly feeling like I can’t breathe. The noise of the café seems to fade away as I process what I’ve heard. She had been real, in a way. She’d saved me, whether she was alive or not. And now I know why she disappeared so suddenly, why she seemed so familiar with the feelings I was drowning in.

She had been me, once. Lost, broken, standing on the same edge, looking for a way out. But she didn’t find it in time.

And now, somehow, she had given me that second chance.

I stand up and leave the café, my legs shaky but my resolve solidifying. As I step back onto the sidewalk, I look up at the rooftop, far above me. The wind rustles through the trees, and for a brief moment, I swear I see the hem of a white dress fluttering in the night air, a girl standing up there, staring down at me.

But when I blink, it's gone. The rooftop is empty.

And yet, I know she’s still there—watching, maybe even waiting for someone else. Someone like me.
