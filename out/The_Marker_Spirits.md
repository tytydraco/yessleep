When I was younger, I lived with my grandpa, and every summer, we went camping together. Every night, we would stay at the fire for at least two hours before heading into our tent to sleep. This gave him a chance to tell me all sorts of scary stories. Most were over told or just flat-out boring, but the one that I never forgot was his story about the Marker Spirits—the spirits of the assassinated.

See, according to my grandpa, if you die in a normal way—that being natural or deserved—you're able to cross over into the afterlife, but if you were killed by another person wrongfully—hit and run, break in—whatever the case, your spirit walks the earth, not being able to get to the other side until justice is attained for your death. 

More often than not, the killers of these spirits don't get what they deserve; they get to live their lives as if nothing happened, so many spirits take matters into their own hands. These ones are known as "marker spirits", because a common practice among them is to leave scratched messages for their killers to harass them into either admitting their crime or killing themselves, and many scratch arrows—"markings"—pointed to them to let them know they're due for one or the other.

The marked spirits also have special abilities, given to them by an unknown entity to help them out. They can alter your perception of reality; make you see things that aren't actually happening, and even remember things that didn't really happen. These powers demand a lot of energy, and often wear the spirits out, so they usually save this for when their initial tactics don't work. After a while, if their killer hasn't committed suicide or turned themselves in, they'll use these powers to set the killers up for a trap to so they can seal their fate themselves. They reverse their shiftings in the killer's memory, usually through flashbacks to what really happened, and then, in the most painful way possible, they kill them.

For the longest time, I never believed in the marker spirits, but I did believe in the killers my grandpa spoke of, which got me interested in criminal justice, so I made my living by becoming a lawyer. With that as my job, I could set things right for people who, dead or alive, had been treated unjustly. My most recent client was a woman in her early thirties who's husband was allegedly abusing her and their two young children. When the husband started making treats to stab them all to death, she contacted the authorities and pressed charges on him.

In the end, we won the case, and the husband left in handcuffs, on his way to federal prison. I was the one to drive them back to their home afterwards, and the whole way, the woman, who was in tears of relief, thanked me incessantly, saying that I saved their lives. After a fifteen-minute drive, we were there, but when I pulled into the driveway, what I saw was horrific.

The entire property was streaked with yellow police tape, and there was blood splashed across every single window of the house. I was confused, and even more terrified. I turned to the woman in the passenger seat, not knowing what to say to her, but I was shocked to see she wasn't there. She was gone. The kids were gone. I was the only one in the car.

I was in utter disbelief, and all of a sudden, I started having a vision. I was in an alleyway. The husband of the woman was shoving me to the wall of a building, demanding aggressively that I lied to the judge, and that he'd kill me it I didn't. When I broke from the vision, I looked around in absolute horror, realizing the truth. 

Just then, I caught glimpse of something in the seat the woman had vanished from. When I looked at the seats the children were in, I saw the same thing. They were arrows. One had been carved into each of the seats, and they were all pointed at me.
