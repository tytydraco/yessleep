Hi! So I've been feeling invisible, and maybe I should post this on AITA but it's too much to put into their tiny character limit. 

I have this roommate, right? I never see him. He works all night long and sleeps all day, which I totallllyyy understand because he works hard and remodeled our entire house all by himself. He even added some smart tech thingies to make me feel safer when he's gone. Around the house I take care of our pets and try to keep everything as clean as possible. Gosh, our crazy pets! The dog, Renzo, has to go potty like 7 times a day, its ridiculous. And the cats? One of them climbed up a cabinet and when I try to shoo her down, she fell! Dumb cat. They're supposed to land on their feet. That's when my roomie installed some cameras, he got worried about her. I never liked the cats, anyway. The one that actually knows how to land on her feet always runs away from me and hides when I'm around.

Anyways a few weeks ago, roomie comes home from work and I'm in the kitchen. He grabs a beer like always and I turn around to go to the bedroom cuz he likes to sleep on the couch. He drops the bottle cap right when I take a step, and I step on it. Those things are pointy and I already had a cut on my big toe. So I'm like bleeding, and he just stands there and huffs. Like excuse me for bleeding, yknow? He bends down and stares at my blood like a weirdo, then goes to check on the animals. He didn't even ask if I was okay. I cleaned up after myself of course and went to see where he went, but he was busy trying to get Angry Cat out from under the bed. She kept staring at me like it was my fault he was disturbing her. 

Well I asked if I could get him anything and he just locked himself in the bathroom. Idk what his problem was but I don't like being ignored, so I went to the bedroom and watched TV. I heard him turn on the TV too and knew he'd be asleep soon. I took Renzo out and fed all the creatures, cleaned up, ran errands and right when I was about to start the laundry he woke up. Renzo wanted to go potty yet again, and I felt sooo bad that he woke roomie up. But then I remembered how mean he was to me earlier and ignored it. I saw him start the laundry I was about to do and he went to throw the empty detergent away, but he like freaked out and started frantically checking his phone. I peeked behind him to see what was going on and he was watching a video from the kitchen camera. He kept zooming in on my feet and blood from my toe. Like he was looking for something? 

I asked him again what was going on but he AGAIN ignored me. For like 2 months now he just acts like I don't exist and gets offended or triggered or something when he sees evidence that I live here too helloo!!! I'm allowed to forget to flush! He always forgets to put the seat down anyway. And like I had gotten this super cute pixie cut and he didn't say anything. He's not my bf or anything but he could acknowledge that I chopped my hair off from my shoulders to my ears. 

All of that hurt my feelings for sure but I started to get worried when he became obsessed with watching me on the camera. I decided to get the app too, and he has the login info written right there on the fridge so I didn't feel like I'm invading his privacy or anything, especially when I'm the one being watched. So I played around with it for a while and I figured out how it works, but I don't understand how he made it so it only records when HES in the video too. When I walk around alone it doesn't. So when he's at work are the cameras turned off?

One night I waited for him to leave and played with a live record button. I stood right in the entryway and watched myself on my phone, then saved the video to the app. It worked so I was confused, but maybe he has like an admin setting with more recording rules. Only records on its own at a certain time of day or something.

But get this, this is why I made this post. He gets home one day and checks the app. He freezes, and right in front of me asks why the app recorded "nothing" at midnight. That's when I had done my experiment! I looked on my phone and there I was clear as day, but he acted like he genuinely did not see me. I started screaming! To scare him! To get him to look at me, anything! And he didn't. 

Or he couldn't.?
