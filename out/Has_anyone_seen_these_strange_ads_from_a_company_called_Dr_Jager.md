Ok, so I saw a reddit post in r/advertising yesterday that I thought was weird. Took a screenshot because I sent it to a friend. The post and the user (u/OMGGimmeDrJager) have both since been deleted. I guess the video violated the posting guidelines or something. Before I go any further you should read it first:

>Hey guys! A few days ago I saw it for the first time. It was in front of a YouTube video, but I can't remember which one. I only noticed afterwards, because I skipped right over it. I am **SO** angry about it!

>So it's about these Dr. Jäger commercials that are running everywhere at the moment. Never heard of them before, but you see them everywhere. Youtube, on TV, in the city, in online banners, in apps and so on! You've probably already noticed, but the most ridiculous thing about it is how much money they must have put into it. I have seen NOT A SINGLE ad more than once. Not even the big ones like Coca Cola do that, it’s way too expensive!

I didn’t know what to do with that, I've never seen the commercial he's talking about before and just found the post strangely entertaining somehow. The problem is that I've been seeing the ads since then too. My friend who I sent the screenshot also. Hence the question if any of you have seen them as well. I can't find anything about a company called Dr. Jager and I don't even know what they are trying to sell with their disturbing ads, or why this creepy crap is allowed to be shown at all.

I've seen two commercials so far (I think one of the ones u/OMGGimmeDrJager describes), and whatever they're licking are NOT steaks! It does look like bloody raw meat though. I remember the first one too but it wasn't as sick as the second one. Didn't record it unfortunately. If I see one again I will post it here.

But here is the description as I have it in my head.

1. you see a suburban house in nice weather with chirping and guitar music.
2. cut to inside, where you see a woman cooking in the kitchen, but you don't see what she's making.
3. cut to the extremely overly happy looking family at the dining table.
4. the woman puts something on the table, again you don't see what.
5. cut to close-up of the man licking meat or something, looking as if it was the best thing he ever did.
6. cuts back and forth to the man and the children, who do the same. You can hear a lot of smacking and munching noises.
7. you see how the woman leans over and licks the same "thing" as the man. But I remember I thought it looked more like ripped up skin there.
8. tracking shot moving away from the family at the table, who are smacking louder and louder. Again, you can't see what they're licking.
9. logo of Dr. Jäger is faded in and a deep male voice says "Dr. Jager - Simply the Best".

No shit, that was the most disgusting and disturbing crap I've ever seen. Every time I've tried to record this so far it just doesn't come on. I'll keep trying.

Please tell me you guys see the spots too. I don't know what kind of sick shit this is. If you guys want screenshots of the banner ads get in touch.

*Edit:*

I got a mail (!!) from [getsome@drjager.com](mailto:getsome@drjager.com). I don't know where they got my mail address from, but it's fucking creepy that this is all happening since I saw this damn post. And all at once. Copied here one to one:

They have my FUCKING name and address!!! Honestly looks way too professional for a scam. But the Links don’t go anywhere… Again: Screenshots on request.

I am thinking about calling the police. But nothing really criminal happened yet. If anyone knows anything about this company contact me please!
