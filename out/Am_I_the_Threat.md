They are here. Here with me... Right now. What should I do, should I look at him, should I see him, the man, the man in the corner. Should I listen to her, should... Should I let her touch me? She likes to feel, she likes to touch. He loves to speak and scream but he never seems to make any noise, but damnit if she does. 

They just have to look at each other, whatever he wants, she will speak for him in that god awful voice. It's terrifying and disgusting but so beautiful... They have been here for a while, I have grown accustomed to them. I see them every. single. day. There isn't a day that goes by that I don't at least hear from them. They stay in the vents, the shower, the oven, wherever they can fit.

I feel like they watch over me to make me feel safe yet so uncomfortable all at the same time. The other day I learned that he can speak, they hadn't known I had walked in, but I heard him and ever since I have not been able to sleep. It sounds so familiar but I have never heard his voice before. I think they heard me when I walked away because she started screaming and running at the door on all fours. All four of her long skinny limbs. Her legs were longer than her torso. Her arms even longer, they would drag the floor when she walked and they could reach me from the other side of my room if she wanted them too.

He was silent again, I haven't heard him since that incident last week. The conveniences I endured during that time were horrible. I got sick and got lice. I get lice very often. I think they have it. I see them scratching their heads very often, sometimes large, wet chunks of skin will appear on my floor, and I will have no choice but to clean it up. If I don't, I fear something bad will happen because the longer it stays the the closer she gets. She will sometimes stand at the end of my bed watching me but she never does anything to drastic.

I noticed something different about her last night.. Her eyes were pitch black and her mouth had been tied into a large, horrifying smile. I mean tied as in string looped through her eyes sockets and going under the skinn as if lead by a needle and keeping her flabby, ghost white cheeks pulled up. Nice and wide. Her tongue was long and purple with a few pieces missing. He doesn't have one. A tongue I mean. His mouth is just empty, it's like a void. But there is something in that void, something big and disturbing... Like a head, a child head. The head is bald and his lips are also pulled into a smile much like hers.

Just today I left my house and she grabbed me and pulled me back into the house through the front door violently. She spoke to me. She told me to not leave or terrible things would happen. I was starting to get scared again. I felt if I stayed even worse things would happen to me. So I wriggled out of her grip and bolted for the front door. I didn't have a car as I was poor and had to save money to pay the rent for my house, so I walked to work. Everyone kept staring, they were horrified. I even waved to my neighbor in which we are very close friends. She screamed and then vomited, I reeled my hand back from its wave. And then nothing...

I woke up. I'm in a hospital. In a straight jacket. I was confused until a bit later a doctor came in and asked me some questions of what I remember after I left my home for work, but I had not remembers anything but waving to my neighbor, Isa, my friend, or at least I thought she was my friend. I would never scream at my friend and then vomit.

The doctor then told me what had happened

I apparently hadn't fainted but I had went on a rampage, I ran around the neighborhood screaming and yelling at random people. I had also ripped most of my hair out. I attacked Isa. She is gone now. 

I did that... The police searched my house after someone called the cops. They found three corpses. One a man, one a woman, and one a baby boy. The woman's mouth was tied into a smile and the man's a frown. The babies head had been decapitated. It wasn't cut but had been twisted and wripped off. The boys head had been stuffed into the man's mouth and his body was stuffed in the back of the freezer. Their bodies were mangled and their scalps were ripped off. All of the bones in their arms and legs had been dislocated and their skin stretched as far as it would go.They had been dead for about four months.

Four months ago this had all started. Four months ago I had killed my parents and brother. And just today I was diagnosed with schizophrenia and a psychopathic personality. Charged with three counted of murder and I would spent the rest of my life in this damn asylum.
