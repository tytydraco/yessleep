I live in a tower block only accessible through a dual rail/motor tunnel. Years ago it was some kind of military base but was repurposed into residential housing. The place is pretty bleak and everyone who lives here moved or stayed for the same reason. We wanted isolation. Being so isolated, effectively an island really, we have all the amenities required to survive alone. There is a gym, an elementary school, a doctor, police station and a few stores. I work in a simple convenience store on the fourth floor.



I woke up on a cold winter morning to find my giant white goldendoodle laying in bed with me. She kept me warm and her familiar popcorn smell made me smile immediately as I came to full consciousness. I patted her head and we got up together. While I got dressed she went into the living room and propped herself up on the window sill to look out at the completely white outdoors, it was one hell of a snow flurry. There were no dog bowls or food in the kitchen. I made a mental note to pick up some things on my way back from work but she was a big girl and could cope without one meal. Leaving a ceramic bowl of water in the kitchen I gave her a farewell pat and went on my way.



In the ancient but reliable elevator I bumped into Agnes Keller, a middle-aged woman from the ninth floor. She was dressed in her typical pink garbs. Agnes worked in the doctor’s office with Dr. Pyre. What shocked me was that her creased face was split into a smile. She was famously one of the most dour people in the building. I don’t think I had seen anything before today beyond a scowl from the woman. I gave her a simple hello and did not want to spoil her good mood by making inquiries. However she explained herself unprompted. Her son had told her a funny joke this morning. Funny thing was. Agnes did not have a son.



Marcus Lin was pacing the store with a clipboard in hand and looked me over with his typical mixture of contempt and dissatisfaction. My manager got me to work right away dipping into the back to replace inventory. Being isolated as we were, the storage area behind the store was enormous and packed with emergency supplies beyond the standard fair. Lin liked to run the store as if we were in the middle of a tourist packed centre. I put up with his dictatorial leadership style because it made the days go by quickly. After our morning rush hour, approximately six people, I went down the aisle where we kept the dog food. A peculiar thought entered my mind as I perused the slim offerings. I remembered a conversation with Lin where he complained that the only reason we had to stock any damn dog food was because of Mrs. Innes on floor two. She was the only person in the building that had a dog.



Lin excused me for my legally required fifteen minute break and I headed back to my place with a can of dog food in hand. My manager did not comment on that purchase. The dog was sitting on my sofa and watching TV. It had such a familiar smell and even simply seeing the fluffy creature overpowered my sense of unease with serene pleasantness. She rushed towards me and nuzzled against my leg earning her a belly rub. I gave no thought as to how she had turned on my TV. She greedily wolfed down the dog food and wagged her tail. Lin would give me a long lecture if I took longer than I was permitted so I left the dog with a promise to take her for a walk during my longer lunch break. Only when I was back in the elevator did I realize that I could not remember my own dog’s name.



When I returned to the store I was surprised to find Lin missing. He never left the store unattended and had his breaks there eating noodles and critiquing me. Then I found his handwritten note. He was going to spend his lunch break at home with his wife. Mr. Lin was not married. My head started to feel murky as I tried to piece together my morning. An overwhelming feeling of dread crept up from my feet causing my skin to prickle and hair to stand on end. Again and again I repeated the vivid memory of waking up next to my dog and later seeing it sitting on the sofa. Why had I remembered it being white and fluffy? Standing in the store, struggling to contain a scream I knew for an absolute certainty that the thing waiting for me in my apartment was in fact thin, grey and had sharp teeth.
