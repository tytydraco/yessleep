I used to hate living in my apartment. Despite my attempts to make it as comfortable and decorative as I can get, I abhorred the building's location. Deep in the city San Francisco California, close to a junction, where traffic would build up to the point I couldn't open my window without being blasted by an orchestra of engine roars, horn beeps and tires screeching on the ground. Even worse at night when the building across from me would throw a party.
  

  
And being in the city was almost as bad, now next to all that noise and getting bruises from bumping into every shoulder on the street. I grew up in the rural areas of Boston you see, so I was still trying to get used to this environment that grew increasingly unwelcoming. If it wasn’t for that job opening for being a clerk at the local bank with an attractive salary, I wouldn’t have moved here.
  

  
But now I will be stuck in all that concrete and sound. No wilderness or land in sight. And now, I couldn't be happier.
  

  
Well, I’m not currently in my apartment anymore, I’m still in Utah at the hospital, but from where I am, I can’t even see a single tree.
  

  
So when I first moved here a year ago, I was having trouble adjusting to the environment as I mentioned before, and would take trips away from California and either stay with family who were still in rural neighborhoods or even go camping down in the wilderness of Utah. Yes, it does seem like a rather long trip for camping, but I was sure to use my time optimally so I would get there as soon as possible and arrive back home at a good time.
  

  
This summer, after days of grinding away at my job and even being promoted, I decided to take a 5 day long trip to Utah and my employer was generous enough to allow it. My plan was to be on the road early in the morning, before the sun even rises, have the occasional stop to stretch my legs and arrive there at dawn.
  

  
After I got packed up early in the morning, keeping my windows shut to block out the head-wrecking racket, I left my apartment and damn near sped off down south. The drive was long, but luck seemed to be just as gracious as my boss, as there was practically no traffic on the way there and I arrived relatively early. I think back and wince at how dumb I was. After being trapped in such a rowdy part of the US, the quiet and peaceful scenery of the woods was more than welcomed. Even the drive on the way there was enjoyable, the view of those skyscrapers disappearing out of view and foliage of nature soon surrounding me was pure bliss.
  

  
The parking area was mostly empty, a lone bike chained on a post, which was odd to me cause the summer was normally the time campers would go camping and the weather had been nice for the past couple of weeks. But I guess I wasn't going to complain. Campers or no campers, I was going alone and I wasn't afraid of the woods at the time.
  

  
After throwing on my heavy rucksack that had my tent, food, water, spare clothes and bear spray (To be safe and to use on anything) I trudged up the tree line and deep into nature. Towers of wood and green surrounded me on all sides, rays of sunlight cutting through the tops to leave warm beams where I walked.
  

  
I would hear the occasional bird chirp, the rummaging of a small animal, the trickle of streams and the smell of fresh air and vegetation filled my senses. It was all perfect. The weather, the scenery, the mood. It was all perfect.
  

  
After walking a few miles deep in the forest with occasional breaks, I climbed up a giant hill overlooking a large river and decided this would be a good place to place my tent down.
  

  
My tent wasn't that impressive, just a small dome-shaped blue tent that could fit two people with a single door.
  

  
After I set it up, I cleared a small section of the ground into a circle and collected some dry wood for a fire and quickly ignited a small, but appropriate flame just as the sun was setting. When night fell not long after, I took some bread, canned food and water and had my supper. 
  

  
As I ate, I listened and lost myself in the sounds of the night. The wind blowing softly through the leaves and branches above me, the birds still chirping at the crickets having their own choir together. I wanted to pat myself on the back for planning this whole trip. Even the food tasted better than usual.
  

  
But from within the darkness and quiet melody of the wild life, a distant noise caught my attention. 
  

  
HOOT
  

  
The spoon was still in my mouth as I heard it, my body freezing before I slowly turned my head around to the direction of where it came from just as it sounded again. I thought it was an owl for a moment, but it sounded…..deeper and drawn out a bit too long. The hoot came again, and I don’t know why, but there was something about it that seemed odd to me. Perhaps it was because I didn’t recognize what it was and I was just curious. In hindsight, I should have packed my things and left the moment I heard that.….thing.
  

  
HOOT
  

  
The hooting continued for another minute before it stopped as abruptly as it began. I was left staring out into the darkness before I slowly went back to eating. The rest of the night went calmly just like the day, no odd noises disturbing me as I slept in the tent and woke up that morning. But though nature was peaceful, I wasn’t. Not saying I was exactly on the edge of insanity, but the hooting never left my mind. I wasn’t an expert on the local fauna, or fauna in general, so I shouldn’t be surprised at hearing an animal noise that was unfamiliar to me. A bit embarrassed to say that as a once avid camper, but I didn’t take up the hobby to study wildlife.
  

  
A deep, drawn out owl hoot was all I could describe it. There was an element to it that felt off. I wasn’t sure why and I tried to ignore it, but it remained on the back of my mind.
  

  
Deciding to clear my head, I went down the hill to the wide and calm river with a mild current. The early morning sun casted golden rays and stripes upon the crystal clear water and my appreciation for the beauty of nature amplified and I almost forgot about the hooting. I looked to my left and saw a large boulder by the edge of the river. Feeling adventurous, I climbed up the boulder to get a better view of everything and I certainly did give that. But it also made me notice something on the other side of the river.
  

  
Footprints.
  

  
Decently sized as well, and my first thought was that a very tall person walked through here recently, but the spacing between each print seemed too much for a tall human to make. I then worried that it was a bear, but it was clear, even where I was, that whatever made those tracks only came from something walking on two legs.
  

  
As I said before, I’m not an animal wildlife expert, but I knew there was nothing in North America that made those tracks. And at that moment, that hooting echoed in my head. I felt myself grow nervous, but I tried my best to ignore it or chalk up the prints to anything else. The angle at which I saw the prints made them look odd and they were perfectly normal tracks by regular animals, a really tall person did walk through here, maybe one of the Ostriches that farmers own in the US escaped and made itself here.
  

  
I thought of anything that kept me from leaving early and going back to that commotion of the inner city. I know I already sounded like I was panicking at this moment, but at the time I was relatively calm despite what I heard and saw. This is just hindsight speaking.
  

  
The rest of that day was me hiking and sightseeing the wilderness without the weight of the bag on my back, feeling free from concrete and steel and soaking in each view, sound and smell like a sponge. I wanted to make all of it last, even when I still had a few more days of being here. Nothing odd happened there. I didn’t hear any hoots or see more footprints. 
  

  
The night was quiet as well without me eating and drinking and crawling into my tent for the night. The day was so calm and pleasant that I honestly did forget I was ever mildly spooked. 
  

  
Until….what felt like minutes of sleeping, my eyes shot open and I was staring at my tent ceiling. I blinked there awkwardly, in the middle of questioning why I woke up until I heard it. Something was moving around my campsite. I thought it was just a racoon or rabbit, but it sounded way too big. I then thought it was deer, but that was when I saw the thing’s shadow through the door of my tent. It was a full moon and it was shining brightly tonight, so I could clearly see something big, tall and heavy move, walk and sniff at the place I was sitting before it moved quietly to the wall on my right side.
  

  
The moon allowed me to see it was on two legs, had front limbs that acted as arms, a long snout and I could soon make out a very, very long tail. I was frozen in place, my breathing shallow and long, my body ensuring I was making as little noise as possible. The creature’s head slowly lowered down next to mine, and now there was only a thin blue wall between us as it turned it’s snout in my direction with deep sniffs, its nose pressing against the fabric and was mere inches from my face. My eyes were watering from fear and my lack of blinking, my breath catching in my throat, sweat rolling down my face.
  

  
My sweat. It could smell my sweat. I almost gasped at the realization, and the creature paused its action before standing up to its full height. It made a deep chirping noise and some clicks and just when I thought I needed to pull out the knife I just remembered was in my pocket, the creature walked or strutted away. I listened as it left, waiting a full minute as silence fell and allowed myself to breathe, relief washing over me, but never subsiding my fear.
  

  
HOOT
  

  
My eyes shot open at the loud call. The source of the hooting of what I once thought was an owl, came from that animal.
  

  
I could barely sleep that night, even when I was sure the creature left the area.
  

  
No more excuses. I was leaving that morning.
  

  
When the sun rose, I carefully exited the tent and looked and listened for anything. I sighed when nothing seemed out of the ordinary, but the moment I looked down, my heart skipped a beat. There were a set of tracks around the campfire and my tent. The footprints were large and the shape was strange. The creature had seemed to have feet that only had two large twos and sharp claws that poked at the dirt as it stalked my sleeping form. 
  

  
Seeing that made me pack up faster, the beat of my heart pounding my ears.
  

  
Once I packed everything, I trudged down back to the parking lot’s direction. It would take me an hour or two to get there and I was rushing it, but I had my compass with me and my phone that had the app just in case. The night before genuinely terrified me. I still didn’t know what that creature was or what it wanted, but something in me willed every cell in my body to leave the forest as soon as possible. 
  

  
It must have been that primordial instinct of feeling hunted. And when that thought passed through my mind, I picked up the pace. 
  

  
After walking for over a half hour, my legs began to burn from the constant movement and my shoulders began to ach from the bag, my throat feeling a little dry from both anxiety and not taking any breaks. I went up to a tree on my left and rested against it, quickly looking around before setting my bag down beside me and began huffing in exhaustion. With the mixture of barely getting any sleep and lots of movement, I felt drained at the worst time. I reached into my bag for my canister and swigged back and moaned at the cold liquid curing my sore throat. 
  

  
HOOT
  

  
I froze. The hooting was back, but much closer this time. And worse, it was coming from the direction I was going. The creature was back and was essentially blocking my path. I stared down the path, my back tight against the tree, my eyes darting around in desperation to catch anything that resembled a lizard-bird hybrid.
  

  
But I saw nothing. At first. I cursed under my breath and fumbled for my knife and bear spray and pulled them out in front of me, the 7 inch long blade glistening in the sunlight. My breath picked up and I started to sweat again, cursing again and tried to wipe it off of me as my scent was probably how the animal tracked me this far.
  

  
Just then, I saw movement between the trees slightly to my left, 30 or so meters away. I couldn’t make out any details, but I saw something light brown in colour, almost the same as the trees, move slowly further to my left while also coming closer.  I thanked my parents for giving me 20/20 vision or else I wouldn’t have even seen it. It continued to move closer to me quietly, my knife trailing every step it took and after a few seconds, the creature stopped and I could see it a little clearer now. I saw a yellow eye staring at me in between a smaller tree and a low branch. 
  

  
I was still as we both fell into a staring contest, neither one of us moving or blinking. I didn’t know what the creature's plan was. Was it planning to hide and ambush me later or was it just going to rush me down and I would need to fight for my life.
  

  
Just then, I had an idea. Slowly and carefully, without taking my eyes off of the creature, I crouched down to my bag and by memory, took out a bag of beef jerky, knife still in hand. With some difficulty having my hands full, I filled the bag with water to get the meat nice and wet and held it up in front of me for the creature to see. I put the spray in my pocket at that time.
  

  
The thing didn’t make a move and my eyes darted from it and to my tight. Using my hand that gripped my knife like a vice, I felt around my pockets to feel my compass, phone and keys in my pockets. Once there was any confirmation, I swung my good arm that held the bag in big arches and threw the bag with all my force and mentally cheered at the decent distance. The bag was open with water that now smelled of beef jerky sprinkled and splashed, the scent strong to anything that had better senses than a human.
  

  
I watched as the creature followed the bag as it sailed along the air before it hit the ground. A moment passed before I saw it lower its head and made its move towards it. That was my chance. I quickly, but still quietly made my escape, making a wide arch around where the creature was and sped walked down to the direction of the parking lot, leaving my bag behind.
  

  
I looked back over my shoulder at that time, seeing the creature, still obscured by green vegetation, make its way to my bag. And there, I saw another one stalk from within the brush. There were two? I didn't even notice.
  

  
Knowing this, I could feel the panic within me get worse and I sped up my pace. Any rational I had leaked out and I kept looking over my shoulder and every noise made me yelp or whimper.
  

  
I fumbled and almost dropped my compass to make sure I was going the right way, and I was, though I was trailing off a little. I started to run and realigned myself, almost tripping over a root. At the pace I was going, I tried to hold onto some hope that I was going to make it to the parking lot sooner rather than later and there would be other campers there. But just as I was thinking about sanctuary and how lovely that thought was, I heard it.
  

  
“HELP!”
  

  
I stopped when I heard someone cry out in the distance. I looked around and held my knife up, listening intently to make sure I just didn’t mishear it. I wish it was my imagination, I wish there wasn’t actually someone in danger. 
  

  
“HELP!”
  

  
My heart dropped when they called out again. They didn't sound too far away, but I was being stalked by two large predators and only just managed to draw their attention away from me. I couldn’t have someone drag me down if they were hurt.
  

  
“HELP!”
  

  
But I couldn't let someone die in good conscience without trying to save them. With hesitation, I ran towards the source of the pleading camper or hiker, jump and dodging trees and branches with more ease than before. I was still afraid at the time, but I couldn't let that control me.
  

  
“H-HELP!”
  

  
After twenty more seconds of running, I bug my heels in the ground to stop me from tripping down a hill that came from nowhere and searched frantically for the person in distress. My eyes fell onto a figure on the ground face down at the bottom of the hill in a small clearing, a light blue coat giving them away.
  

  
I cursed again at the thought of being too late and I began to sprint over to them, making sure there was nothing ready to ambush us. But just as I was maybe around, 4 or so meters away from the very still form of the fellow hiker, I noticed the colour of dark red coating them. It was blood. A lot of blood. On their jacket, on any skin that was exposed and the smell of something putrid hit me. 
  

  
The smell of decay. I felt my nose scrunch up and my instincts told me to back away from the rotten body, dread pouring into me at my failure to save the poor soul and was about to turn and run for it again until a sound halted me from moving.
  

  
“H-H-HELP!”
  

  
I stopped and looked down at the corpse. The voice didn’t come from the person on the ground. And it was then I realized two things. How can someone already be rotting away when I just heard them speak a moment ago, and why did the voice sound off? It sounded like human speech, but the words were brute forced and were reminiscent of a parrot or raven’s mimicry. And that could only mean one thing.
  

  
It was a trap.
  

  
Just then, I heard something rush towards me from behind and instead of turning around to meet them, I instead threw myself to the side and swung my arm out, my knife arching wide and I felt something big and heavy knock into my hand. I fell to the ground, but just as quickly sprung up, backing away quickly towards the trees for some cover, every survival instinct I had going haywire.
  

  
And I could finally see these things in full view. It was a dinosaur. A real dinosaur. A raptor. Standing around 7 feet tall and maybe 20 feet long, was a giant raptor, long snout and sickle claws and all. It was covered from head to toe in dark orange feathers with dark blue stripes, its arms seemed to have long winged feathers with green accents, and the same went for its tail feathers that formed into a fan. The raptor made an annoyed clicking noise as it looked down at me, standing over the corpse, circling me slowly as it sized me up with the same yellow eyes from underneath red brows and colourations around its face.
  

  
I didn’t know what to think at the time. How and why was there a dinosaur here? They were supposed to be extinct, right? I honestly thought it was all a dream. 
  

  
But it wasn’t. I was being hunted by a giant raptor.  A raptor that made deep purring noises from its throat, stepping slowly as it circled me, the large sickle claws on its feet were like loaded guns pointing at my direction.
  

  
I gritted my teeth and tried to suppress my fear, backing away slowly and making sure there was a tree in between us while I struggled to go uphill backwards. The raptor didn’t like that as it charged me, moving fast for such a large creature and opening its maws to show sharp curved teeth and snapped down at me. I stumbled back and swung my knife out, both of us missing. I then made the stupid mistake of turning my back and tried to crawl up the hill, but I barely made two feet before I felt myself being crushed down when the raptor pounced on me. I felt the wind being squeezed out of me and tried to cover my neck and head with my hands just as the raptor bit down on my left forearm.
  

  
I screamed in pain, the jacket being torn and shredded away as my flesh was cut and bitten by the raptor's serrated teeth, it's hot breath on the back of my neck as it tried to pull my off my shoulder socket or pull my arm away so it can ravage the back of my head. It then kept its head still and pressed down on me harder, my ribs and sternum straining from being snapped at the weight and felt the worst pain in my life. The raptor began to plunge its massive sickle claw into my left shoulder blade and I cried out louder than I ever had before. It was like a hot knife being slowly pushed into me, a knife that was sharp, but not razor sharp.
  

  
I screamed and cried at the pain, feeling death slither closer to me by the second and was sure I was about to die. Every regret in my life flashed before my eyes. Deciding to come here. Not leaving the moment I first heard this blasted thing’s hoot, falling right into that trap. I was about to die.
  

  
But not before I try to survive one last time. I swung my backwards with all my strength and my knife, by some miracle, managed to slash it. The raptor snarled as it jumped off me and the moment its claw left my body, my adrenaline rush pumped into my heart and I pushed myself up with new found strength, pilling my bear spray out anf claied it around behind me. The raptor made a noise of agitation, but I didn’t want to wait and see if it was effective before I ran.
  

  
I ran as hard as I could, everything rushing past me at the speed of sound, the wind in my ears and my feet stamping the ground as I glided through the forest floor. I quickly glanced to my left and right, trying to see if anything was following me, and I saw nothing. But that didn’t mean much to me as I pressed on harder.
  

  
I didn’t even know I could run so fast. I could have betted on outpacing a race horse and win, but just as I stupidly thought I could have just sprinted all the way to the parking lot, I tripped over a root or a rock or my own feet and I flew forward. I tumbled, rolled and smacked against a tree, sticks and stones scraping my skin and the wind was knocked out of me. And what was worse, my puncture wound hit the tree first. Agony erupted from the wound and I sucked in a deep breath and wailed in misery, fear, pain and anger.
  

  
I grunted and groaned as I tried to push myself up higher before bringing my arm up to my face. My left arm was almost completely shredded, blood leaking heavily, flesh sliced, cut and chewed, almost down to the bone. The sight was horrifying and the pain from the wound began to settle in. It was horrible. The feeling was so bad, my vision blurred and my ears rang.
  

  
I couldn’t even get up from where I was. Ijust sobbed and babbled while I sat against the tree, cursing myself for ever taking up camping. Cursing the very concept of camping and cursing most of all, whatever allowed those raptors to survive their extinction and hunt modern day humans. I almost gave up saving myself at that moment.
  

  
“Help!” I cried out, snot and tears running down my face “Please! S-someone please help me-e–eeeee!”
  

  
But no one came and I was all alone.
  

  
“Help me!”
  

  
And no one came.
  

  
“Help-”
  

  
“ME!”
  

  
My breath was caught in my throat. That was my voice that finished my own sentence, but it didn’t come from me.
  

  
“HELP ME!”
  

  
“PLEA-ASE!”
  

  
“HHEEELLLLP”
  

  
It was coming from all around me. They were mimicking my own voice. It was distorted and not at the right pitch, but it was still mine.
  

  
“PLLEEEASE HEEELP!”
  

  
“HELP!”
  

  
“HEEELLPP PLEASSSEEE!”
  

  
They came from all around me. I couldn’t pinpoint where they came from. How far there were or how many of them were here. I was soon surrounded by the cries of my own despair, drowning me within the echoes of agony and terror.
  

  
I was going to die. Movement there. No there! I was going to die! They’re closing in! I was going to die and feasted upon! I was now just a wounded and bleeding lamb at the mercy of the pack of wolves.
  
 
  

  
I closed my fears and whimpered pathetically, accepting my fate again and waited for death to tear into me with hunger. Until a sound I really wasn’t expecting came.
  

  
A howl. And barks. Barks from….dogs?
  

  
Just then, I jumped and winced when a large german shepherd and husky, both on leashes came into view along with their owner, a large gruff man with a big beard behind them. He looked down and spotted me, alarm written on his face. 
  

  
And….I couldn’t remember anything more than that. Glimpses of the events following were the dogs sniffing or clicking my face, the guy asking if I was okay and asking what had happened, and then me being dragged away through the forest. The sounds of the dark going mad at the unseen predators and soon, I was being dragged on the gravel ground of the parking lot.
  

  
But just before I passed out from pain, blood loss or exhaustion, I looked up at start of the trail and time slowed down at that very moment. I saw the three raptors watching me. 
  

  
The big coloured one that attacked me, a slash over its right eye and leaking blood. Next to it, were two smaller, but still large raptors, one with the same colour scheme was the largest, the other light brown with white markings.
  

  
They stared at me, and I could see the intelligence in their eyes. They were angry at losing their meal. And everything went dark.
  

  
I woke up in the hospital two days later, sitting upright.I was delirious and confused where I was until a nurse told me I was still in Utah, before asking me if I was alright. I couldn’t remember why my arm was so heavily bandaged at the time or why I was in Utah, but when I shifted in the bed and pressed my back on the mattress, pain shot through and it all came back. I had an episode of sorts when that happened, more nurses and doctors rushed in to try and calm me down as I babbled about a raptor hunting me until they injected me with something to make me relax.
  

  
When I came to, a police officer was there waiting for me, along with the nurse who was there when I first woke up. He wanted to know what happened and it took me a minute to respond with “I need some time to remember if you don't mind.”
  

  
He was generous enough to allow me an hour as he exited the room. I asked for my phone if I still had it and now I'm here typing everything out.
  

  
The officer was waiting outside for my testimony and I was not looking forward to seeing the look of utter confusion and disbelief on his face when I tell him those things from Jurassic Park tried to kill me and had already killed someone else.
  

  
What I was looking forward to was going back home to my apartment. Full of concrete, steel, traffic, noise and people, now wilderness in sight. And I couldn't be any happier.
  

  

  
As for you, the person reading this, I leave you with this warning. Don't just avoid camping, but warn everyone you know and everyone you can. Your family, friends, coworkers, local wildlife centers, the authorities. Tell them that these things still exist and are killing people. If they don't believe you, just show them this story where someone did die and soon the ones that hunted me will be brought down.
  

  
Hopefully they will.
