I lost my job last month. Well, I, along with fifty other researchers, scientists, and technicians. I won’t go into the bureaucratic bullshit surrounding the dissolving of the federal office I used to work for, but it might help to know that it was a sub-branch of NOAA.

Even before we were disbanded, you wouldn’t have been able to find any record of our office other than an unaccounted-for one hundred or so million in NOAA’s annual budget report. We fell under the Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research and weren’t given a designation, but we liked to call ourselves “Blip Watchers” since that’s mainly what we did – watched monitors for blips.

Based on what I’ve told you so far, I wouldn’t blame you for thinking it was a good thing to cut this blatant, parasitic, fund sucking waste of money, but once I’ve explained what those “blips” are, you may be calling your representative's office.

“Blip” is a very benign term we used when referring to detections of electromagnetic anomalies across a network of magnetometer arrays around the globe. The technical term for these anomalies is “Extra-Dimensional Incursions”. These Incursions are… well, we’re not exactly sure what they are, but they can be dangerous. When a blip manifests, it releases an amount of energy proportional to its size where it emerges. A Category 1 blip, for example, would produce enough energy to cause a light to flicker, a Category 2 would cause that same light to burst, a Category 3 is roughly the amount of energy produced by firing a 9 millimeter pistol, and it just gets worse from there.

For the past six years, I was one of the few techs who were responsible for follow-up investigations after a blip manifested and caused damage in a populated area. It usually consisted of phone calls, sending emails for surveillance footage, gathering police reports, and posing as an insurance adjuster – anything to get every bit of data we could for these incursions.

I know that when I first heard all of this, I didn't think it was such a big deal, but since then, I’ve seen a few things that changed my mind. I’ve seen a Cat. 4 emerge inside the engine bay of a parked Buick LeSabre in a small town in Vermont, sending its hood and other metal bits flying in all directions, killing a cow in a nearby field, a Cat. 3 pop up in the left nostril of a city official during a town hall meeting in Quebec, blowing his nose clean off of his face, a Cat. 5 completely annihilate a fish farm in Bulgaria raining chunks of catfish into the neighboring Oblast… You get the picture.

The worst I've ever seen was a borderline Cat. 6 just after I started that leveled a high rise. Fortunately, this was in the center of a ghost city in Northern China so there were very few casualties. The CCP claimed it was an intentional demolition but the CCTV footage we… acquired… and our magnetometers, told a different story.

If you're anything like I was after seeing that, you're probably suspiciously eying that flickering lamp on your desk and wondering what is the biggest event ever recorded. Confirmed? The 2020 Beirut explosion was a Cat. 8.

Unconfirmed, on the other hand, is a bit scarier. If you've ever heard of the “Tunguska Event”, you can skip this history lesson, but for those of you who are typing “bless you” in the comments, here you go:

On June 30th, 1908, in rural Siberia, an explosion estimated to be between 3 and 50 megatons created a shockwave that flattened over 800 square miles of Forrest, and broke windows hundreds of miles away. No crater, just carnage. For reference, both nukes we dropped on Japan added up to only 36 kilotons. 

The best explanation that we’ve had for the explosion was a 200 foot wide asteroid that blew up at airliner cruising altitude, but no confirmed fragments have been found.

Obviously, the array or any other EM recording equipment was around then, but comparing the records and evidence to known incursions along with residual EM readings from Siberia, we're fairly confident in claiming it as the largest Incursion ever recorded.


‘Yeah, this is all pretty wild, but you guys were just essentially book keepers’... I hear you, but we actually did stuff with the data we collected to try and predict events. Before our office was dissolved, we were able to predict an Incursion 30 seconds before it happened… As I'm typing it out, I can see how insignificant that seems, but coming from no warning at all to half of a minute is monumental given what we have to work with. Our goal was to create an early warning system, but that's all out the window now.

I know I said earlier that we don't exactly know what is causing the Incursions, but we, well the egghead physicists I worked with, have a theory – a theory that, I hope to God, is absolutely wrong.

The blips are like fish (just go with me here). One of our techs was a marine biology major who took the first job with NOAA she could get and wound up with us. She made the comment one day after a series of minor blips that the smaller ones reminded her of fish jumping out of the water and larger ones like whales breaching. We laughed until one of our physicists nearly choked on his coffee before opening Excel spreadsheets faster than the computer could handle it. After a short while, he had converted all of the blip data we had to a .csv file and plugged the data into our mapping software. We all gathered around his screen as he pulled up the world map and scrubbed through the timeline.

It looked like schools of fish jumping from the water all across the globe. There would be hundreds of Cat. 1 through 4’s before a 5 or a 6 would pop up, then the pattern would repeat over years of data, all over the world.  We ran the timeline before the larger Incursions and we found a pattern; The more small incursions that occur means a larger one will follow.

Someone asked why fish breach like that. Her answer was simply “... To get away from the bigger fish”.

So, extra dimensional fish jump into our plane of existence to get away from being eaten by an even larger extra dimensional fish, and they all wreck shit when they do. So what?

Guys, I'm not going to sugar coat this because you deserve to know the truth. Our office is gone. No one is working on bettering our early warning system, no one is working on how to prevent Incursions. Maybe some other government has people on it, I don't know, but if they do, they never made themselves known.

Yeah, we can deal with a few explosions here and there, but that's not the problem. Before we shut the doors on our office, we saw the largest number and most concentrated areas of blips than have ever been recorded.

There's an Incursion coming, and I don't think the world will be the same when it breaches.
