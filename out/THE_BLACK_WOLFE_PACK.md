Please let me introduce myself I am Marty, I am half Gaul and half Germania, my father is Germania, and my mother is from Gaul, I have to tell you that my mother is a White Witch and a medium, who could talk and see the spirits of dead, the gift has been past down to the females only in her family for hundreds of year's, but for some reason, I have inherited this gift from my mother, this is why I can see the dead in the story.


I have two stories to tell you, but first I must explain the first one so that will lead you into the second story, now shall we begin?

It is the Second World War in Gaul, and the year it's 1943 November, The Black Wolfe Pack are on the hunt for their prayer to kill, the pack is about to cross the river Seine into the city of Parisianens the Wolf Pack are One Hundred miles away and going to enter the Town of Mount Corpus Christi, and as they do that the Wolfe pack will circle the town to make sure none of the pray will escape, then the Black Wolfes slowly make a silent approach into the town killing all that stand before the blood lust and the desire to create such death and mindless carnage was beyond belief, but this did not matter to the cult of The Black Wolfes who followed The Black Moon of Death.

The Wolfe Pack created death and cranage through Eastern Europe into Europe itself slaughtering men women and children, the Wolfes would crucify the men upside down and then cut out the tones this would make the tongues fill with blood and swell in their mouths and down throats, so the Jewish men would slowly suffocate to death, then Germania, soldiers started to rape the young Jewish girls along with the mother's, taking the woman to use as sex slaves while the Germania, soldiers partied all night when they are finished, just before leaving they would destroy the town, and kill the females, the pack would make sure that nothing was left of the town no it's people.

Garmania awakened from their nights of debauchery and senseless killings and destruction and started heading towards the City of Parisian but the Wolfe Pack came up against the allied forces and then a major battle broke out, after three days and four nights of hard bloody fighting the Wolf Pack were finally defeated and destroyed. 

This is what we decided to do one day it was the start of things to come for me and my mother it came from the darkness of the lost town of the dead in the forgotten Town called Mount of Corpus Christi. 

We didn't know that this Town was even there very strange things began happening due to the oncoming of darkness and evil, for us both after a few days away it was time to go back home to Paris we were about one hundred miles away from Paris We left the mine road and turned on to a nice quiet countryside road to avoid the heavy traffic so we could have a peaceful drive home. 

But we didn't get that at all because as we were driving down the road it felt like the car was slowing down to a stop then we got the feeling that time and space are changing so much in the blink of an eye daylight became night time and then the slow grip on the car made it slow down it was like if a visible force had a hold on the car which made the car stop, it released the hold which made the car go forwards and faster my mother had to slammed the brakes on, we were sitting in the car just looking at each other thinking what has just happened.

Marty, I think that we have just gone through a thin veil of fabric of time but I don't know where we are Marty, no matter what happens you stay very close to me do you understand? 

Yes Mother but why is everything black and there is no life here nothing at all, not a sound what's that over there? it looks like a black silhouette of somebody walking towards us, it's a figure that's heading this way, and the figure is waving its arm if it wants us to go towards it. 

Marty, it's moving this way get back in the car we have to go now that thing has no life to it, run now get back in the car Marty don't stop go now, the dark shadow figure was becoming closer, that is the dead soul of a Germania soldier, it wanted the both of us to go towards it, I think it was trying to warn us but, I do not stop to find out.

Mother, back into the car and drove off at high speed, I was wondering what the hell it was and where we were, this place was so dark the only light we had was from the full moon.
