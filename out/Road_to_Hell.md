For a thousand years, I wander aimlessly. I wander through sunny deserts, through these green abandoned hills, through countless streets and endless highways, through dried lakes and mountains eroded by the night rain and the ceaseless wind, through meadows and back lands punished by heavy sunlight, through the ruins of old castles and towers, through fallen walls, through burned woods and through graveyards with no gravestones.

I wander through statues that once were important people, fathers, mothers, sons, daughters, brothers, sisters, through statues that once were my family, my fellow countrymen, my enemies, my servants, my slaves… I wander between the lines of a story that never began, between unmasked dismembered stars, between idols erected and suspended in the air forever, between fake golden calves, between burning bushes that went out, between cities that once housed kings and queens, princes and princesses, vassals, and today are wastelands and landfills.

I wander to find, if God allows me to, the entrance of Hell. I wander in this aimless road to the infernal portal, where the gaol is eternal and the pain, infinite. So that, as soon as I find its entrance, I can open its gate and release all those miserable forsaken souls, let all the lunatics escape from the asylum, let all the lepers to enter the city, so that the cursed and the lost can take Heaven by force, that they can shake the celestial gates, yelling, begging for mercy and a drop of mercy in their thirsty hopeless lips. I wander to accomplish the mission I received – from whom I don’t know, but I did receive.

For centuries, I roam through these lands forgotten by God, for centuries I search for the gate of Hell, but without success. I know it has existed since the beginning of times, and I know it’s around those sides. I also know that many have condemned and lost themselves searching for it. The Poets find it easily, but I am no poet… I wander because it’s the only thing I know how to do.

Far away, suddenly, I see the infernal portal. Yes, I see it! There it is: majestic, tall and large, like Lateran Basilica’s doors. I run to it, breathless, excited, pleased for finally complete my mission… O, the horror! The pain! When I finally reach it and start to push its heavy doors, I notice that they don’t move even an inch, no matter how much force I use. Frustrated and confused, before even being able to consider the reason, I hear a voice by my side. I look, and see a ragged hungry man, a true beggar, purulent, sick, disgusting, stink, smiling at me. I ask him who he is, but he doesn’t answer me. I ask him why I can’t open those doors, and he gives me an answer that haunts me to this day, after millennia of meditating on those words: “They only open when pushed from the outside”.

*The road to Hell is Hell itself.*
