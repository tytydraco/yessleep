***This Series can be read in Any Order***

This happened to me back in the early 60’s, either 1962 or 1963, so forgive me if my memory of it is a little foggy, regardless of the fact that I have recounted it twice recently before writing this. I am also not all too tech-savvy, so my granddaughter Sonia is helping me with uploading this. It was after I told her this whole story that she suggested I write it up and put it on here, so here we are.

I live out in the Black Country in the UK, the most rural part of the rural West Midlands, and have done my whole life after moving back post-University. My town is a little Tudor settlement surrounded by thick forest and farmland, very obscure and hard to get to according to those who pass through, however I have always loved living here in such a tight-knit community with those who choose to stay.

I enjoy walking, always have done, and in the summers of my youth I would take long walks alone around our local National Park (years before it was closed down); it was beautiful, especially in the summertime. Long, sprawling dirt paths through canopies of softly trembling pine and birch trees latticed overhead with the daylight seeping through the leaves in geometric, golden tubes. It was always so quiet in there- like there was no civilization around for miles despite it being right next to the oldest part of Town, and it was far bigger during the mid-20^(th) Century when I did the majority of my walking due to the fact that the east-way forest hadn’t been demolished to build the mining village on top of yet. It was angelic, simply angelic, in the summertime.

One August day in the early afternoon, I think right after I had eaten my lunch, I was walking back home and saw up on the hill by the Johnsons’ farm that there had been built a great, tall radio tower. I don’t remember the thing being erected, there would have been a buzz in the town about it for sure; it was as if one day it had silently grown up from out of the ground like a tree. Making eye contact with this steel, needlelike thing, I got an overwhelming surge of excitement. It sounds like an odd thing to enjoy, but after studying AM and FM frequencies in my O-Level physics class that year, I had become enamoured with the idea that you could use invisible air to just tune into *anywhere* at the simple turn of a dial or knob; that you could listen in and be privy to a place that would potentially never even know of your existence within it. It may not surprise you to learn that I was also a habitual eavesdropper.

Anyhow, I decided it was love at first sight, and that I would rush home to retrieve the wireless desk radio from my father’s home office and take it up to the tower to see what I could hear. The sunlight seeped through the clouds and reflected in the great satellite discs atop the thing, and I thought they looked like sparkling diamonds in the earrings of a film star.

When I got home, my plans were interrupted by my mother asking me where I was going with my father’s radio. I sheepishly confessed that I was going to take it up to the new radio tower and she got a little quiet before asking me why I wanted to go. I bluntly, and truthfully, told her that I just wanted to see what was out there: who I could listen in on. She sighed, wagging a slender, red-manicured finger as she told me all about an article she had read in the papers about the effects of radio frequencies on the brain, and eventually came round to forbidding me from ever going up there.

I was so angry with her- I laugh a little when I think about my anger now, at how driving and pure it was- and I stormed away and barricaded myself in my room where I devised a plan.

I’ve never been that much of a crier, so to deal with a lot of my emotions I would seek either vengeance or act out in defiance. I was not going to let a little thing like potential life-long brain damage stand between me and this new discovery in a town that I had mapped out in my head inch-for-inch by the age of ten. I decided that I would wait until the end of the week, knowing then it would be safer for me to make my expedition as my mother would have forgotten about my longing for the tower. I would take a friend with me- my best friend Emmanuelle, whom I would later go on to marry- for safety’s sake and sneak out through my window at night after stealing the radio from my father’s office desk after my family retired to bed. This final detail is a little ridiculous to me now, but I also spent some time crafting a pair of tin-foil hats for Emmanuelle and I to wear to protect our brains from radio-waves. I think it’s safe to say that I was more invested in the *philosophical* attributes I had attached to radio frequencies, not the scientific ones.

I called Emmanuelle that same night and she loved the idea, though was a little anxious at the prospect of us both going out late at night as a pair of young women, so insisted that she bring along a breadknife. Just in case.

In hindsight, we probably could have just used the radio from the comfort of mine or her own house. But where was the fun in that?

\*\*\*

I was so anxious for the end of the week to come around, it was all I could think about as I stared at the Kit-Kat Clock on the kitchen wall over breakfast and supper, watching it’s mischievous eyes taunting me with the excruciating crawling of time. I would gaze up at the tower on my long walks, and the great silver discs atop it would glint and wink at me: begging me to come over and listen in.

I had even begun to craft all these fantastical scenarios where Emmanuelle and I would stumble upon a phone call between government officials and uncover a deep conspiracy; or hear the final words through the telephone of a woman about to be murdered wherein our interception of the call would be the final clue in uncovering the killer. I even considered the prospect of us communicating with alien life, though I quickly brushed off the idea. Ronnie’s, my brother, sci-fi TV shows were apparently seeping into my brain.

The night of the expedition came, and I pulled my bedsheet up to my chin to conceal that I was fully dressed to my mother and father as they kissed me to sleep. The moment that the latch clicked shut on my bedroom door, I shot up from my bed and methodically began packing my supplies into my bag, muttering their names as I placed them inside the satchel like a mental checklist: “canteen of water, handheld torch, notepad and pencil, tinfoil hat…”

I had my summer jacket and shoes neatly laid out next to the bag on my vanity table, and all that was left for me to do now was retrieve the radio and escape to meet Emmanuelle outside The King Henry.

I pushed my bedroom door open, stopping it just before the creak, and tiptoed barefoot along the carpeted hallway, past the spare bedroom, and towards my father’s office at the end of the corridor. I was so nervous I could hear my heart pounding in my ears and feel my pulse throbbing in my neck so rapidly that it was as if my carotid arteries were about to burst. It wasn’t as if I had never snuck out before, it was just something about this night that felt different. It felt new.

The sound of my father telling my mother that he had left something in his office sent me darting down the hall and into the spare room like a shot, hiding under the bed and praying he wouldn’t notice the light coming from my ajar bedroom door round the corner at the other end of the hall. The sound of the light switch being flicked off in my father’s office spurred me back into motion as the door to my parents’ room closed with a soft *click.* I retrieved the radio, gathered my things, and escaped through my bedroom window.

That night was especially memorable for me. The sunset hadn’t quite melted down under the horizon yet and the sky had been painted a deep, murderous, maroon red. The houses alongside my estate were like black, two-dimensional stage placards that bled into the sky as it bled into night; the tiny yellow spots of light emanating from the gas lamps along each side of the road buzzed like angry fireflies rutting against the walls of their glass cases.

The King Henry was not far from my house at all- basically a five-minute walk in a dead straight line. Emmanuelle waved at me when she saw me, rushing over and protruding from her coat pocket a small tape recorder, telling me it was for if we stumbled across anything interesting and needed to keep a record of it. I joked that we were doing a radio listening, not a séance, but I said that I liked her idea and that I could also keep a transcript in my notepad. She linked my arm, making me blush, and we strolled out all the way down Main Street and towards Gallows Lane (the closest road to where the tower was). We would hop the gate before the path led us towards the town’s famous wych elm tree.

We got over the gate and onto the field, trekking up the hill and wading through the silky, itchy, tall grass. I acted as a beacon, my torch blazing through the ever-encroaching darkness, and a little before we got to the high fence spanning a wide diameter around the tower, Emmanuelle and I donned our tin-foil hats. We sat down beside the great metal sign reading: “RF HAZARD: RADIO FREQUENCY FIELDS BEYOND THIS POINT MAY EXCEED THE GENERAL PUBLIC EXPOSURE LIMIT” attached to the fence.

\*\*\*

I have re-listened to this recording in order to make this post, as well as twice before in recent memory after bringing it up to my granddaughter when she expressed an interest in analog media. She was telling me about a pod-cast she listens to that I cannot remember the name of at present (apologies, Sonia!). It involves tape recorders, anyhow. I, excited, told her I had an old spooky recording of myself and her nan from back in the 60’s and she *insisted* that I bring it out to play for her.

I have since lost the little notepad I wrote my original transcript in, so had drafted up a new one to show you all now.

My name is Charlotte, so I shall be using the letter ‘C’ to indicate my speech, and the letter ‘E’ for Emmanuelle’s speech. Any unknown voices will be referred to as ‘voice 1, 2, 3… etc’ unless they mention their own names, then they will be referred to using the respective initial.

Here is the transcript:

\*\*\*

***E:*** *okay, I think it’s recording now*

***C:*** *\[squeals\] alright! Let’s turn on the radio, then*

 

*\[radio static\]*

*\[sounds of radio stations being flicked through at a pace\]*

 

***C:*** *this is all just the BBC and such, I’m going to try and tune it to a higher frequency to see what we can pick up then*

 

*\[radio tunes\]*

*\[muffled talking from radio broadcast\]*

 

***E:*** *is this something, d’you think?*

***C:*** *\[pauses, listens to broadcast\] uhm… no, no I don’t think so. It just sounds like an independent station*

 

*\[speech from radio unintelligible in background\]*

 

***E:*** *well, keep going then!*

***C:*** *alright! Okay, okay, I will…*

 

*\[static\]*

*\[‘after-hours’ style jingle starts playing, synth jazz\]*

 

***C:*** *this might be something, I—I don’t think I recognise the tune—*

***E:*** *\[interjecting\] –me either—*

***C:*** *\[overlaps slightly\]—hmm… what d’you think that instrument is—?*

 

***Radio:*** *\[classic English RP, low female voice\] Good evening, eavesdroppers and onlookers! It’s 10pm, our time, and I’m tonight’s host: Sydney Cunningham of Snakeshead Crescent, hoping you’ll stick around as my captive audience. Tonight, we have an array of snippets and inklings sent in from devoted listeners from all across the plane! This is: Janus FM, after-hours…*

 

*\[radio jingle plays again\]*

 

***E:*** *\[overlapping radio broadcast\] –this sounds like it’s scripted… but, it’s fun though. Reminds me of one of those television shows your brother likes.*

 

***Janus FM:*** *\[fades back in\] –we’ve got now for you is a relaxing love ballad, a conversation to really wind down to. Sent in to us from an anonymous listener. Whoever you are, we hope you stick around.*

 

*\[Sydney Cunningham’s voice fades out, replaced by a strange hollow static, like a recording of an empty room\]*

*\[footsteps enter\]*

*\[conversation slowly fades into being audible\]*

 

***Voice 1:*** *\[male voice\] —totally forgot about the flyer for a roommate I put up \[nervous laugh\] can’t believe the landlord didn’t tell me you were moving in right away, I would’ve, uh, \[sound of person hurriedly stacking crockery\] cleaned up a bit—*

***Voice 2:*** *\[female voice\] it’s alright, honestly all of this was so last-minute. I saw your flyer online, like, last week and it’s the cheapest accommodation close to De Montfort I’m gonna get.*

***Voice 1:*** *you’re a uni student?*

***Voice 2:*** *uhh, yeah… is that gonna be a problem?*

***Voice 1:*** *no! no, it’s not a problem at all, uhm—what’re you studying?*

***Voice 2:*** *journalism. I actually might get some of the second-year work experience done here at the local paper. \[pause\] I know it’s not- y’know—it’s small but everyone’s gotta start somewhere \[laughs\]. What is it that you do, uhm…*

***Voice 1:*** *Oh! Neil, Neil Holly \[pause, assumed that he shakes her hand\] sorry that’s so rude of me not to introduce myself—*

***Voice 2:*** *\[laughs\] you’re right, it’s unforgivably rude.*

*\[a moment\]*

***Voice 2:*** *I’m joking—look at your face! \[pause\] I’m Louise Feng, but my friends call me ‘Lou’.*

***N:*** *well, it’s nice to officially meet you, Lou, even if it’s all so last-minute*

***L:*** *just ‘Louise’ for now, I haven’t decided if we’re friends yet.*

***N:*** *oh.*

***L:*** *\[jokingly\] c’mon, don’t pout, it won’t be for that much longer. Anyway, you still haven’t told me what it is you do*

***N:*** *oh! Yeah, uhm, I just work at the- the, uh local library. With my—\[stutters\] with my priest.*

*\[pause\]*

***N:*** *I promise it’s not as weird as it sounds- it sounds so weird when I say it like that*

***L:*** *(dryly) I’ll take you word for it, Neil.*

*\[pause\]*

***N:*** *you need any help with those?—those boxes?*

***L:*** *please. I’ve got some more in my car as well, d’you mind, like, grabbing them whilst I pop these upstairs?*

***N:*** *\[eagerly\] yes! Uh, yeah, yeah of course… just let me know if you need anything*

***L:*** *\[voice receding out of the room\] will do! Hey, be careful with those. They’re my ma’s—*

 

*\[audio cuts off\]*

*\[radio jingle plays, Sydney Cunningham resumes talking, unintelligible\]*

 

***C:*** *\[over the top of Janus FM\] that was odd*

***E:*** *yeah, it makes no sense. Why would a station just air random snippets of an audio drama?*

***C:*** *strange place to cut it off too, just in the middle of a scene… \[pause\] also didn’t she say they were listener-submitted? —*

***E:*** *we’re probably just missing some context- how about you write down ‘Janus FM’ and we’ll see what we can find.*

***C:*** *If these are all listener-submitted they’re bound to have a public telephone number, or maybe a PO Box…*

 

*\[sound of pencil scratching in notebook\]*

*\[Janus FM fades back in\]*

 

***Janus FM:*** *\[Sydney Cunningham’s voice, close to the microphone, crystal clear, no background music\] Turn your head towards the wych elm.*

 

*\[silence\]*

 

***Janus FM:*** *Go on, turn your head towards the wych elm*

 

*\[tape recorder clicks off\]*

 

\*\*\*

That was when Emmanuelle and I left. The statement had stunned us both into an uncomfortable, baffled silence, and I had switched off the radio so fast that I nearly didn’t realise I had done so.

Neither of us turned out heads towards the wych elm, we weren’t stupid. It was far too off in the distance to be properly visible from where we were sat anyways, although I don’t like to think about the fact that whatever, or *whoever*, was calling out could see us, even though we refused to acknowledge *them.*

We packed up quickly, deciding that we had all we wanted to seek out, and hurried down the hill. As we ran, I could hear a faint, elongated whistling sound. It drifted over from the other side of the hilltop, off behind the trees; it sounded like the first two notes of a familiar yet undiscernible tune.

I thought I would feel a little safer once we reached the well-lit streets of the town, but standing there fully illuminated gave me this nauseous feeling that I was somehow *too* visible. That they could all see us here. It was still a little busy out, what with it being a Saturday and only just ticking round to 11:00pm, and as we reached Main Street and its higher concentration of other people I relaxed a little.

I walked Emmanuelle home, and she held my hand for the first time- we were already friends, but it felt a little more meaningful that night. I’m very glad to say that we remain together without trouble to this day, however I had to stop bringing up Janus FM to her a while ago because of her strange tic. It is why I only showed the tape recording to my granddaughter when Emmanuelle was out of the house. At the mention of the station, she looks at me, cold. Her eyes glass over a little and she mutters the phrase: “three faces” before seemingly snapping out of it. It’s strange, and I still don’t know why she does it. I tried getting her to talk to a psychologist about it, but she refused to acknowledge it was even a thing she does. I have forbidden Sonia from mentioning it to her.

I remember the two of us spent the week after our expedition poring over yellow pages and any other documents we could get our hands on, looking for any trace of ‘Janus FM’ or a ‘Sydney Cunningham’.  We found a ‘January FM’ but that just seemed to be a new age horoscopes and astrology station. There was no ‘Sydney Cunningham’ to be found, although a boy in our school, Terry, did have the last name ‘Cunningham’, but when we awkwardly interrogated him about any family members he may have named ‘Sydney’ he said that he didn’t. We even looked into ‘Louise Feng’ and ‘Neil Holly’, wondering if their characters were somehow based on real people of the same names. Nothing came up on ‘Louise Feng’, and the only people with the last name ‘Holly’ were just a family from our town whose son, Edward, was a few years younger than Emmanuelle and I.

It wasn’t until 1996 that I heard the name ‘Sydney Cunningham’ again, or rather, read it. ‘Sydney Cunningham’ was the name of a girl who went missing in the National Park. I will never forget the feeling that rushed over me when I saw her name emblazoned on the front page of the local paper outside the newsagent’s, and I picked up a copy and began to read.

She was the twenty-one year old daughter of Terry and Annabel Cunningham; when she disappeared, she worked as a park ranger volunteer. She, and two other colleagues, were on their walk back from a closing patrol when, according to their statements, she stopped in the middle of the path, muttering to herself about seeing yet another trail that was not properly marked down on the official maps. Her two friends told her to just keep walking, and set off down the trail again. When they looked behind themselves to check if she was still following them, down that very same path, Sydney had vanished.
