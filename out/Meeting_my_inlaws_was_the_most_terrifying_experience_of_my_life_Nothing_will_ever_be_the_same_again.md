I survived to write about how I got to this point in my life. Not everyone else did.

---------------------

There are some lessons from our elders that never get old. 

When I was standing amidst a pile of dead people/were-lions, and I had just discovered my fiancée was a badass killing machine, but she had been bitten and was changing, [my future father-in-law told me to “run.”](https://redd.it/17stets)

That was one of the lessons that stuck with me, because I think it was a really good idea to run at that point. 

Lacey stood, transfixed, staring at her father.

“I’ll be fine,” he promised, “just GO!”

I grabbed her uninjured arm and pulled her away as Frank staggered to his feet and headed to the nearest window. “His best chance at survival is for us to get as far from him as possible!” I yelled, pushing the other were-lion forward. “If we’re fast, we might get out before the rest can-”

We burst into the hallway and slammed to a halt. Icy fear flooded my gut.

A pack of at least twenty were-lions was waiting for us. 

I was too petrified to move; if it weren’t for Lacey’s quick thinking, I’d be dead.

“How long do you think it would take you to die after this tungsten bullet rips through your colon?” she whispered to the were-lion we’d taken from the room as she discreetly pressed the pistol against his asscrack.

“Um,” he called to his brethren. “She’s joined us.”

The pack turned their heads in eerie unison to gaze at the wound on her arm. It had stopped bleeding entirely at this point, but the skin had turned green around an array of angry-looking tooth marks. 

Lacey pressed the gun deeper against his ass. 

“AH! And she saved me from her father just after he turned, because AH! He, um, was going to kill me, and OH! I’m no good at fighting, and would have been dead. But she’s loyal to us now, and not even her own dad. So you should be very, very respectful of her.”

From my position, I could see what the others could not: every knuckle on her hand was lily white, and the trigger had less than a millimeter to go before it fired and broke all hell loose. 

A were-lion in a blue coat, taller than all the rest, stepped forward. “You want us to regard her as one of our own, despite her history?”

“It would be great for me if you did,” he groaned. 

The lead lion turned his head from the speaker, over to Lacy, across toward me, then back at the other were-lion. “This is acceptable.”

My heart thrummed even faster; something in the tone of his voice told me that this wasn’t the good news I’d been wanting. 

“Prove your loyalty by turning *him*.” 

My stomach twisted as every set of eyes in the room turned to look at me. The only comparison that I can make is that my entire body felt like the exact moment when milk spoils enough to smell like a diaper. 

My eyes fell on Lacey’s. 

Without a word, she moved closer. 

I considered running, but there was no point. Whatever my bride-to-be had decided was going to be my fate. 

Warm chills cascaded down my spine as she brushed her lips against my neck. “I can’t stop them, Joseph. But if you run faster than you ever have before, I can slow the pack down just enough for you to make it to the car.” She slid the keys into my pocket.

“They’ll… they’re going to tear you into shreds,” I whispered back. The tension in the room grew with every second that ticked by without my blood on the floor. 

“I promised to love you for the rest of my life,” she breathed. “I didn’t promise that would be a long time.”

I forgot how to inhale. 

“Are you sure?” I finally choked.

Blinking rapidly, she nodded. 

“Okay,” I croaked. “I accept your choice.”

With enough time, “the way things used to be” becomes indistinguishable from a dream. 

It’s scary and a little wonderful how everything we know can change in an instant. The life I thought I would have with Lacey disappeared that night and never came back. 

Surviving means getting to a place where we don’t want our old lives back. The insatiable craving can destroy us.

“You are insatiable.”

I stared around at the pile of dead were-lions spread in every direction and shrugged. “These bastards took the life I wanted,” I responded, licking the blood from my lips with a fat, flat tongue. “And it’s *their* fault that I have such an overwhelming appetite for blood.”

“You could have run away.”

I folded my arms and stared at her. “No. I couldn’t have.” I shook my head and gazed around at the carnage. “We don’t get to choose love, Lacey.”

She stared back at me, beautiful as ever even in her lioness state. “You could have chosen *not* to force your arm into my teeth that night. You could have chosen to save your humanity.”

I shook my head again. “Running away would have meant losing you. I would have been lost even if I survived.” I grinned.

She rolled her eyes. “You know I hate it when you’re charming.”

“And you love how much you hate it.”

“And I hate how much you love it.” 

I shrugged. “We didn’t choose the life, it chose us.” I pulled out my phone and looked at the map. “Okay, the hunters are closing in, and the Tribals will be pissed that we got another 19 of them.”

“Thirteen,” Lacey corrected.

“I’m counting the half dozen that ran away in fear when they saw you take down three at once.”

She smiled wider. 

“Well, the hunters want to kill you, and you want to kill the Tribals. That leaves you with just me, unfortunately.”

“Lucky me.”

“Nah, I’m nothing but trouble.”

She wrapped her arm around my waist and leaned in for a kiss.

That’s when something banged at the door. “Aw, fuck,” I sighed. “I don’t know who this is, by I know they want to kill us.”

“You’ve got the tungsten bullets?” she asked. 

“Fresh out, but I have fangs. I like my fangs.” I licked my teeth.

She squeezed my ass once and nodded. “Okay. Once more, just as we are. After this, we disappear again.”

“I wouldn’t have it any other way,” I answered. “[Let’s go](https://www.facebook.com/P-F-McGrail-181784199029462/).”
