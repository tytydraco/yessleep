Rock climbing wasn’t my first idea of a good time, but when it made my girlfriend so happy, how could I not go? What could go wrong right? Really. Just one time in real life and not in an indoor simulation of rock climbing, make the girlfriend happy. Maybe see some sights, take a souvenir, get a nasty bruise to remember the trip by and then never do it again if I could help it. Anything was better than working my shitty internet IT job setting up routers and modems remotely for mostly old folks whose tech expertise extended to that of a can opener. Their willingness to learn was varied, but again, anything was better. 

On our way to the rock climbing place in Indian creek, Utah, my girlfriend Mia talked animatedly in the passenger seat about rock climbing techniques, how to position your hands inside the large, open cracks that jutted their way through the reddish cliff face. I was perfectly content to listen and nod along accordingly, knowing full well that I wasn’t going to make it very far up at all. I was determined to go just high enough for her to say she was proud of me, and then scurry myself back down like a disgruntled spider to watch and be supportive from the ground. Where I belonged. I always thought she was so cool for doing this sort of thing, but you wouldn’t ever catch me near a piece of climbing equipment if it could be helped. 

When we arrived at the climbing spot, I got out of the car and craned my neck back a little bit to take in the absolutely gorgeous sight of the soaring peaks and beautiful array of sandstone colors that painted the landscape with their dusty hues. Towering cliff faces and spiralling precipices stared back at me as I put my hands on my hips and took in the gorgeous views. Yep. I was gonna probably die today. Better than doing IT, I reminded myself harshly.. 

“Danny!” Mia called from the trunk of the car, her voice laced with a wide grin, “C’mere so I can fit you with your harness.” 

Definitely gonna die. I made a show of begrudgingly dragging myself over to her to which Mia snorted in amusement and patted my chest with mock sympathy, “Oh, you poor big man forced to be active for once in your little techy life.” 

“Have pity.” I begged dramatically, throwing a forearm over my eyes for extra effect, “I miss my desk chair.” 

“I’m sure you do.” She said flatly, shoving the sit harness into my stomach just hard enough to make me let out a huff of air, “Put this on, and try not to get your junk stuck in the zipper. I don’t wanna have to take you to the hospital yet.” 

“Yet?” I asked, only half nervously. 

She grinned at me and shut the car trunk with a thud, going about fitting herself with her own harness. I got mine on as comfortably as one could, it was a waist harness so if you lost your footing the rope would catch and keep you suspended enough so that you wouldn’t fall to your death. She checked the clasps on the back and then started pulling me by the waist band of my harness towards the nearest cliff face. 

Better than IT, I told myself as she secured the rope, tying several knots over and over in a particular sort of way. She chatted happily with me, explaining the clasps and what they meant. The terms Solo Roping and bolts being spoken out loud but I was too busy staring down, or rather up, the side of the ridiculously high cliff face she wanted me to attempt to climb. Before I knew it she had monkeyed her way up a stretch, and pounded in the rope and tether before scurrying back down to secure a length of rope around me and reassured me that if I fell, the knot would catch me before I hit the ground. 

“And what…dislocate my hip?” I asked, tugging at the rope to make sure it was properly connected. 

“Only if you don’t fall from a high place but I’m not gonna let that happen.” She smiled brightly from above, beautifully. She was like the sun, reflecting its rays back at me in a gorgeous redirection of positivity and confidence. 

I felt like a rain cloud, but smiled back, my anxiety peaking as she spun on her heel and approached the wall. I had seen Mia climb many cliffs before, some of them even bending over her at an angle in some instances, but there was something about THIS cliff that made me extremely afraid for her. Maybe it was the fact that I was expected to climb the damn thing too that made me see it in a more intimidating light. I watched her go up, up, up, one foot after the other. 

Looking far above her head I noticed something odd in the cliff. Something was shining in the sunlight. Mia had paused at this point and was looking up, squinting against the sun to look at the same thing I was seeing. Above this oddly shining rock was a slice in the cliff, an opening. I knew Mia, and by the time I had opened my mouth to tell her that I didn’t want her climbing that high, she told me: “I’m going to see what that is! Follow me!” 

Me, being a good boyfriend, knew enough about my girlfriend’s hobby and had done it enough in practice to be slightly okay at it. But it was a requirement from the beginning as it was her passion, and my skill determined how long I was going to keep on living my life, so I followed dutifully after her, watching the ground get lower and lower with every god forsaken hoist of my body weight. I pressed myself against the hot, gritty stone, and looked up at her as a gust of wind blew by, sending a small dust cloud over us both. “You doing okay?” She called down after me. “I’m just peachy!” I called back, trying not to sound as stupid as I thought I sounded. 

“Whenever you say that, you aren’t peachy!” Mia called back, unperturbed at the meters of space between her and the ground, looking down at me, “Do you need to go back?” 

“NO.” I called back up at her, taking another shot at grabbing for the stubborn handhold I couldn’t quite reach, “I’M AN EXPERT.” She laughed again. Good. This was better than IT. When I looked down at the ground again after the next five minutes I came to the eventual conclusion that it actually was not better than IT, and in fact, much worse. At this point I clung to the cliff wall and breathed as steadily as I could. One misstep and I could fall. One misstep and this harness would be the thing that determined whether or not I was to keep living. What felt like miles above me, Mia suddenly shouted: “Dan! I found the thing!” 

“What thing?” I called up at her, my voice cracking pathetically and echoing over the rocks. 

“The shiny thing!” She had disappeared from the side of the wall, and had somehow managed to hoist herself up into the crack in the cliff face. She was looking down at me on her belly, holding the object out for me to see. She was still too far away from me for me to see it properly but I squinted anyway. “What is it?” I asked, wondering if I could go down now. 

“A dagger!” She called back excitedly and that got my attention almost immediately, “It’s a really cool ornate dagger. Someone must’ve lost it.” “Hold onto it!” I grumbled as I began to climb higher, determined now more than anything else to see this interesting forgotten dagger. Maybe it was worth something! Before I knew it, I was up where she was, and I scrambled pathetically into the crack in the cliff. I wiggled up beside her and she showed me the dagger, running her fingers across the expertly crafted metal. It looked like a Scottish Dirk, which struck me as immediately odd for being in the area. It looked extremely old, the blade chipped in several places and rusted over slightly after being exposed to the elements for what appeared to be months. The hilt of it was wide, and wrapped in dirty leather scraps, but the pommel was round, and bore a faded inscription that wrapped around it several times. Mia tilted it so that I could see and we both tilted our heads at it in confusion. “Can’t read it.” I said, rubbing my jaw in thought. 

“You sure it’s not the prophecy on the One Ring?” Mia joked and I elbowed her. “Oh please,” I said teasingly, “I’d obviously be able to recognize Tolkien’s elvish the second I saw it ma’am.This just looks weird.”

It was then that Mia had managed to wrench her head to the side to peer behind us into the crag we had smashed ourselves into. She went silent a while and then looked back at me with wide, excited eyes. 

“It goes back.” She said in the hushed, eager voice that often came up when she wanted to do something I absolutely did not want to do, “Danny there’s a cave! It opens up behind us.” 

“We don’t have the equipment for it, Mia.” I said, fixing her with what she called ‘the look of supreme lameness’.  

She frowned at me in response, her cheeks puffing out in a you-never-wanna-have-fun kind of way, but let’s be real here, I was just trying to keep us from getting hurt. Caving was no joke. People got stuck, or lost in caves, and they died. There was a story I read a long time ago on the internet called Ted the Caver that had absolutely destroyed any and all of my already nonexistent willingness to descend into ANY subterranean space. Not to mention that one caving incident where a man got stuck upside down in a crevice and died there waiting for help. I’d be damned if I let Mia die like that. She had a free spirit but by no means was I going to let that spirit lead her to death. 

“We need to go back down.” I said, beginning to pull my body over the ledge and back down onto the cliff face. She wriggled her arm from its awkward spot and grabbed my sleeve, tugging me back towards her. 

“Please, Danny.” She was really pushing this, the knife still held in her other hand, glittering tantalizingly in the light. My eyes fell on it again and I can’t exactly explain why but I started to believe that it would be fine if we just…wriggled in a little ways to see what would happen. Maybe we were at the site of some kind of archaeological discovery. Maybe we had found a secret cave entrance that was some kind of important site for ancient people of the area. 

I doubt they’d have Scottish style daggers though. 

I looked into her eyes and made a big show of sighing dramatically before I relented with a nod, and Mia wiggled over the distance between us to kiss me softly in thanks before turning all the way around and facing the dark inside of the cave. 

“Can you reach into my backpack and pull out the flashlight?” She asked, and I obeyed, struggling in the cramped space to really move at all. She had more mobility than me since she was significantly smaller, and I handed her the flashlight. She clicked it on and shone the beam of light deeper into the cave. It seemed to narrow on all sides into an odd little hole near the back. She then began to army crawl her way deeper. 

Some instinctual part of me thought it would be best to just…change my mind. Even if I ended up sleeping on the couch or not getting affection for a while from her it would still be better than whatever was deeper in this cliff cave. Anything was better than losing her, but the light off the dagger in her hand bounced tantalizingly, like a beautiful thing I couldn’t reach, so I followed. Dutifully I followed her like I had always done since the very beginning of our relationship.  

Near the back of the tunnel, the hole looked different. It had looked small when we first saw it from the front, but now it looked barely passable as a hole at all. It looked more like a generous crack in the wall. I watched as she began to wriggle through with no trouble but as I watched more and more of her body disappearing into the crack I had this panicked urge to grab her leg and pull her back to safety. “There’s a room!” She called excitedly, her voice reverberating off the stone walls.Then, before I could move properly, her feet had slipped through and I could only see the frantic light of her flashlight flashing over the walls as she seemed to be able to stand up. 

My turn. 

I began to squeeze through after her, grunting with effort and feeling the air leaving me as I pushed through the crevice. I had to turn my body sideways to fit my shoulders through and push with my legs. When I was halfway through, she reached down to play with my hair gently. She was sitting cross legged next to the hole, smiling happily with the flashlight beam under her face. 

It made her look slightly psychotic. 

“Are you having fun?” I asked her in a breathless voice as the rock pushed against my back and chest, restricting my air intake slightly and making me kind of panic. 

“So much fun!” She said, leaning down to kiss my sweaty cheek, “This is so awesome.” 

“Yeah? Well…” I grumbled, getting my arms through and catching myself before I fell on my face, “I’m glad one of us is having a good time.” Her face fell slightly and she reached out to help me the rest of the way. I laid on the dirty ground for a minute in my back, trying to catch my breath and thinking about how if we’d need to make a quick exit I would probably get stuck in there if I wasn’t concentrating properly on movement. 

Quick exit? From what? She leaned over me, hands on her knees and tilting her head. 

“You okay?” She asked softly. 

“Yeah! Why wouldn’t I be?” I replied nonchalantly, trying not to be the downer she always claimed I was. I had always been the careful one, the nervous one, the scared one. It had been a source of contention in our relationship for a long time and I couldn’t help the fact that I had anxiety. Just because I wasn’t as outgoing as her didn’t mean that I was any less fun. Just because I was careful didn’t mean I wasn’t capable of having a good time. I looked up into her beautiful face and managed a shaky smile. 

“You’re freaking out aren’t you?” She asked, helping me sit up. 

“Not yet.” I sighed, tired of this conversation. 

I pushed myself to my feet and she began to shine the flashlight through the room again. It wasn’t so much of a room as it was a sort of natural chamber. The air in there was very still, but fresh since it had a direct link to the outside. The floor was windswept near the hole, and now that I could reach my backpack I pulled out my own flashlight to observe the area. I shone it back towards the way we had come in and paused as I noticed something weird about the way the rock looked from this side. There were scuff and scratch marks on the stone beside the crack that looked uncomfortably like marks made from desperate hands. Darker stains in the dirt arched around the hole like someone was struggling to get through from this side… 

I really needed to stop reading scary books before bed. It was probably from animals. 

“Look!” Mia said in a voice pitched up in excitement, “Look at that doorway!” 

I followed her beam of light to find that there was indeed a doorway. Man made. It had wooden beams on the sides and top with supports. Further beyond it was a tunnel that curved at an angle, seemingly chiseled out of the stone itself by tools. The urge to grab Mia and shove her right back out the crack was mounting as I watched her stride confidently through. I took one look back at the crevice that led to the outside world, before following after her. Dutifully, Faithfully. As always.
