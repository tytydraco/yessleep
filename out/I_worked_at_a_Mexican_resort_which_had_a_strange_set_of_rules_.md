I am a broke Mexican man who was deported from America and I also owed the cartel a lot of money and I needed to do something and as I was wondering the streets I found a pamphlet of a newly opened resort called El cielo del sur or in English The Southern Heaven which was hiring a new receptionist to work the night shift so since  I always stay up late I decided to give it a shot and spoke to the manager Jean Alvarez who quickly arranged an interview the next day. The next day I went to the resort which was a large tropical themed resort and soon I found the manager's office and when I entered I found Mr Alvarez and after I answered some obscure questions such as, if I believe in the paranormal and if I was afraid of the unknown and after a few more questions he got up and  said " You're hired, welcome to El cielo del sur, we are thrilled to have you as our new night receptionist. Although we aren't very strict we do have some rules which you may find quite strange but these are not to be taken lightly since it is vital to keep you safe from 'them', trust me as the manager of this resort I know what I am saying so please follow them and Si amigo, estos son reales, síguelo por el amor de Dios. The rules will listed on a piece of paper on your desk" he said before dismissing me. I left dumbfounded wondering who is 'them' and why did he ask me those questions, nevertheless I picked up my uniform and name tag. The next day I went to the resort and got settled at my reception and saw the list of rule and I began reading it.   
  
Rule 1. If for any reason you are sleepy do not fall asleep this is very important. There is a coffee machine          behind you it is free so don't worry.    
Rule 2. If a man dressed like he is from the Victorian era give him the keycard to room 25 and don't say anything.  
Rule 3. DO NOT TRUST MENENDEZ.  
Rule 4. If you get a uneasy feeling of dread go to the employee brake room and ask the nearest employee who isn't Menendez to take over for a while and remain there until that feeling is gone.  
Rule 5. If you hear children's laughter past 2 to 4 am ignore it if it is not during those times run to the employee brake room and inform the others and hide. (Make sure to get Menendez out of the room first)  
Rule 6. If you see a man in a black robe approach you see if he has a face if so he is just a guest if not there is a hand gun in the drawer take it and shoot him until he stops moving   
3 to 4 shots to the head should be enough.  
Rule 7. If for any reason the phone starts ringing answer it.  
Rule 7a. If they are asking for room service follow the standard procedure.  
Rule 7b. If they are asking for anything else hang up and inform security.  
Rule 8. At 6 am check your phone and if your wallpaper was changed smash it we will pay for the damages.  
Rule 9. If you see bright red eyes staring at you from the darkness shoot it and if it doesn't disappear get out of there now you have 20 seconds before it gets you.

"¿Qué carajo?" I murmured as I sat down on the chair and after a few hours of talking to the guests and customers.  I saw a faceless man in a robe I froze in place forgetting rule 6 I was only saved when my co-worker shot it and yelled "cabrón are you trying to get us all killed!?" as I was about to thank him I saw his name tag, 'Menendez' I suddenly punched him in the face before ripping the gun out of his hand and pointing it at his head and as I watched in horror his face begins contorting and I shutted my eyes before shooting him and when I opened my eyes he was gone and other employees surrounded me and asked what I was doing "It's Menendez" I replied hurriedly, "dude there is no Menendez or anyone with a M in their name to begin with" my co-worker replied, I ran to the desk and looked for the list of rules but it was gone I turned around and my co-workers are also had disappeared and my desk than the walls than the surrounding landscape, only then I realized that I didn't shoot the faceless man and now it's too late for me to do anything.
