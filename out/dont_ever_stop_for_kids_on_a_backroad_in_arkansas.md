i don’t usually post on here but i can’t stop thinking about this night. this happened last summer, around july, when i was driving through arkansas on my way back to texas. i had taken one of those little two-lane highways because i hate the interstate at night. figured it’d be quieter, more peaceful.

first mistake.

the thing i remember most clearly was how dead the road felt. no gas stations, no lights, just trees pressing in on both sides. my gps kept losing signal and the only thing lighting the way was my crappy headlights. i was already a little on edge, you know? it felt like i was driving through a tunnel that never ended.

then i saw them.

two kids, maybe ten or eleven, standing on the side of the road. one boy, one girl. they weren’t waving or anything, just… standing there. and here’s the thing: it was almost 1am. middle of nowhere. no houses in sight.

i slowed down because, i mean, what kind of person doesn’t stop for kids out there? the boy stepped forward like he was about to come to my window. he had on this old striped t-shirt, dirty shorts, bare feet. the girl was holding a raggedy stuffed rabbit.

but the second i rolled down the window, everything in me screamed wrong.

their eyes didn’t adjust right to the headlights. it’s hard to explain, but it was like their pupils didn’t shrink, just stayed huge and black. i asked, “you guys okay? where are your parents?”

the girl tilted her head, and i swear her mouth moved but the words came from the boy. “can we get in the car?”

my stomach dropped. the voice was too low, too calm. not a kid’s voice.

i muttered something like “nah, sorry, i can’t” and put the car in drive. that’s when they both smiled at the same time. wide. too wide.

i floored it.

for a few miles i kept looking in the rearview, shaking, trying to convince myself i was just tired, that i imagined it. but then the radio cut on by itself, blasting static so loud i thought my speakers blew. i tried to turn it off, but the dial wouldn’t work. through the static i swear i heard whispering, like dozens of voices layered on top of each other.

“let us in.”

i pulled over, heart racing, ripped the aux cord out, even tried to kill the ignition. nothing worked. the car just kept humming, radio screaming.

that’s when i saw movement in the side mirror.

those kids were walking out of the trees, like they’d been keeping up with me. except i’d been doing at least 60 mph. the girl’s stuffed rabbit was dragging in the dirt, leaving this long dark trail behind it, and the boy’s shadow—god—his shadow stretched across the road way too far, like it wasn’t connected to his body at all.

i lost it. slammed the gas, didn’t look back. the radio finally cut out about ten minutes later, but the silence felt worse somehow.

when i finally hit a town—small place called mount ida—the first thing i did was pull into a gas station and just sit there under the fluorescent lights until sunrise. the clerk came out at one point, asked if i was okay. i couldn’t even explain. i just shook my head.

here’s the part that keeps me up though.

the next morning, once i’d calmed down a little, i googled around. thought maybe i’d find some local news about missing kids. instead i found a post on some paranormal forum from a guy who’d driven through the same stretch of road two years earlier.

he described the same thing. two kids, middle of the night, asking to get in his car.

his post ended with: “i let them in. haven’t been the same since.”

and that was it. no updates. no replies. just dead silence.

so yeah. i don’t care if i see a whole damn daycare walking down a country road at midnight—i’m never stopping again.
