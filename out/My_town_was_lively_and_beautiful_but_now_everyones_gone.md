My previous living arrangement ended the day that my wife left me. I had 3 children that I loved dearly but my wife lied to the court and I was banned from seeing them again. I was forced to move on from this situation but I wasn’t sure that I could. 

I moved to a new town to start a new life around a month ago. It was full of life and beautiful things that made life so worth living. The shop owners were happy about their jobs, there was a monthly town party, and everyone loved each other dearly.

I moved into a small little ranch at the outskirts of the town and I got a job in the local police station sorting files. It wasn’t a life I saw myself living a few years ago but I made a good living so I was happy for a while.

A few months after I moved, or last week, whatever you see it as, I got up and ready as usual and walked out of the door. My car stopped working so I decided to just walk to the station.

When I arrived, I was greeted with a warm welcome from everyone.

“Hey Sam! Welcome back!” They said.

“I was here yesterday?” I mentioned.

“Well we missed you,” they said in unison, “we are all connected in this town of course.”

Creeped out, I went and sat down at my desk and started sorting the files of a case that recently shook the town.

A woman and her 2 children had been brutally murdered in their home. Everyone had suspicions that her previous husband did it as a revenge for her going out with a new man.

The case sent chills down my spine. How could anyone do that? I tried to imagine myself in that situation and it only made things way worse.

The man had been taken away to a nearby asylum and lived day to day screaming his children’s names and laughing maniacally at his doctors. 

I had seen many cases before but this was certainly the worst I had seen for a while. I decided to go out on a break and calm myself down. The townspeople looked at me with concentration and dead silence as I walked down the street. 

I walked into a bar and I called for the bartender to bring me a virgin Bloody Mary (I don’t drink since I left my life behind) and he started talking to me in a creepy voice.

“You have to snap out of it.” He said.

“What?” I asked.

“Snap out of it.” He said.

“Okay…” I said.

I left in a hurry and went straight home. I searched on the internet about the town but nothing came up. I became more aware that the town I loved may have been less nice than I thought. I remembered that I forgot to clock out of work and I decided to walk over there again. 

Everyone was gone.

I was scared, alone, and I just wanted to see my kids again. I wanted to leave and go see my kids but I was stuck in town. I screamed out loud asking for someone to help me.

“HELP ME,” I screamed, “I WANT TO GO HOME.”

“Snap out of it.”
“Snap out of it.”
“Snap out of it.”

I woke up. My memory was fuzzy and my mouth was dry. I asked what happened and a man in a white coat old me to remember for myself.

“Where are my kids?” I shouted.

“You know where.” He said.

“Show them to me.” I yelled, “I WANT TO SEE MY KIDS.”

He showed me a picture. It was a crime scene… they were dead.

“How?” I cried.

“You,” he whispered, “you did this to your kids.”

I sat there trying to remember. He was right. I killed my own children. How could I? I loved them so much. 

I got angry, I stole the doctor’s pen and stabbed his throat with it. I ran outside and breathed the air for the first time since that faithful day. I didn’t regret a thing.

I laid down on the street and laughed. I accept my fate. I am going to see my children again. I’m going to heaven.

I am a good person. I am I great person. I am free….
