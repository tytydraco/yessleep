The creak with all the slightest movements, the darkness in between each board, and the overwhelming feeling to get to the top as fast as humanly possible. Or looking down the long corridor with the sound of nothingness filling the air, paralyzed not being able to take a single step into the darkness. 

What I just described was a phenomenon almost everyone has experienced at some point in their lives, going up or down an old staircase or looking down a hallway in the middle of the night. 

Almost everyone I have ever talked to has had this same phobia and it still lingers in the back of their minds anytime they have to get up at night. Usually, these fears are unwarranted, just the imagination of a child running rampant, that's what I used to think.

I learned that all the fears we had as children were and still are completely justified. I’m a twenty four year old man and that one night all those years ago still lurks in the back of my head to this day, because I know what is waiting for us every time the lights go out.

I was eight years old when my life changed forever. I was your standard, stereotypical, Midwest kid. 

I loved playing sports, watching cartoons, and going to church every Sunday. 

I was also very anxious, quiet, afraid of almost everything, and had nightmares all the time. 

My parent’s house itself definitely didn't help with any of my fears. To fully understand where I am coming from, I need to briefly explain the layout of the house. 

It was an older structure with a…… unique design, the only room upstairs was my bedroom and the steps led directly into it. No door, or any privacy if anyone wanted to come in they could.

The steps looked like they were somehow even older than the house itself. They were your typical brown, rough, wooden steps.

They would creak every single time you would take a step. I had gotten into the habit of counting all twenty steps in my head after the creaks every single time I would go up or down them.

The steps also didn’t have any backboards under them, just open spaces between each step. The bathroom was right behind the stairs and you could look right through them and see it.

My room was pretty normal. I had a closet with a squeaky door obviously, and a window with a broken lock to the side of my bed. 

With the window, the creaking steps, and no bedroom door is it shocking that I had nightmares often? The two worst were the man in the window and the man under the steps. 

They were exactly what they sounded like. I would dream that there was a figure standing right outside my window looking in at me. The figure would then try to open my window and enter my room. 

I would always wake up before the figure could get me. Thank God, I was traumatized enough.

The other would be me walking up the stairs in the middle of the night, when suddenly a hand would reach out from between the steps. 

The figure would grab me by my ankle and pull me into the darkness with me kicking and screaming the whole time.

Thanks to these dreams, it was always a struggle to get me to bed. I would beg to stay in my parents room or to sleep with the lights on. 

This went on for as long as I can remember, I always had a reason to be afraid. I even asked if they could board up the window so nobody could climb inside. 

My parents had explained to me several times that to look in my window a person would have to climb onto the roof and that would be impossible with no ladder and the dogs would hear them and bark. 

Also if someone was under the steps once again the person would have had to get in without them or the dogs hearing them.

My dad would always say, “I have no idea where you get these thoughts from. Son, you sure have a crazy imagination.” 

My mom would also say, “If you put half that imagination into school you’d be an A+ student.”

Funnily, I guess my grandpa was part of the blame too. Whenever he used to watch me it didn’t matter what a movie was about or its rating. If he wanted to watch something he was going to.

“These people wouldn’t have to worry about getting eaten if they just didn’t get into the water!” Or, “Them idiots just need to quit trying to get into space! I mean every single time!”

Spiders, aliens, tornados, and especially sharks. I was terrified of all of them. Whenever my parents would confront my grandpa on the matter he would always say the same thing, “It builds character! He needs to be a man!”

My grandpa definitely is a character and I guess I appreciate that he tried to toughen me up. I still won’t go into water above my waist though for the rest of my life.

I would always tell the other students and teachers at my Sunday school about the movies and their contexts. 

Most of the other kids were equally as horrified, while the teachers always tried to tie them into their lessons.

Whenever I would bring up a film they would reference a story from the Bible, like instead of being eaten by a shark Jonah was swallowed by a whale, or instead of being crushed by a giant, David defeated one.

This did help for a time, and it was fun and comforting to know God had protected the people in the stories.

Until, I found out demons were a thing.

The idea of a monster like a demon actually existing rocked me to my core. The only comfort my teachers were able to give me was that as long as you said, “In the name of Jesus” all the demons would flee.

My parents would tell me that there was power in the name of Jesus and if I was really scared to start praying.

I did this for a while and it did help. I felt good knowing I had someone on my side. They were also just movies and dreams. I wasn’t in any actual danger. 

All of this was eclipsed by that one fateful night. I am still haunted by every single little detail.  

It was a warm, humid summer night. The sky was clear with the sounds of nature outside, frogs croaking in the small pond behind the house, and crickets chirping in the woods.

I was sleeping in my bed. My parents were asleep in their room downstairs with our dogs. I could have only been asleep for a few minutes until I started dreaming. 

In my dream, I was sitting in my room watching TV, when suddenly I heard my window creaking open. I turned and saw the black figure standing there. 

As soon as my eyes made contact with where its eyes should have been, it ripped the window right open.

I shot up from my bed, it was that same freaking dream again. My forehead was covered in sweat and my heart was pounding in my chest. 

I sat up with my head in my hands. I wept softly, why did it have to be every single night? Why could I never have any peace?
Why?

After sitting there feeling sorry for myself I started to feel a discomfort in my stomach. There wasn’t any pain, but I had felt it several times before.

I got it any time I had to talk to an adult I didn’t know. I was a pretty shy kid so I didn’t like having a lot of attention on me.

I sat there for a few seconds before the thought burrowed into my head. My window……. somebody was watching me. 

I started to breathe very quickly as my heart started pounding once again. I knew there was something there. I knew it wasn’t only a dream.

I kept my head in my hands and began trying to reason with myself. “It was only a dream! It’s not real! It’s only a dream!”

While I tried to calm myself down I kept thinking, I had never had that discomfort from the dream before. I had only gotten it when people were watching me. I closed my eyes, and thought to myself……. “I gotta look.”

“There’s nothing there….. It’s all in your head…..There’s nothing there….. It’s all in your head…..There’s nothing there….. It’s all in your head…..There’s nothing there….. It’s all in your head…..”

I began to turn to look at the window while keeping my eyes closed. I kept repeating to myself, “There’s nothing there….. It’s all in your head…..There’s nothing there….. It’s all in your head…..There’s nothing there….. It’s all in your head…..There’s nothing there….. It’s all in your head…..”

I slowly opened my eyes and looked straight through the window and saw…. 

Nothing.

I let out a huge sigh of relief. I told myself, “Everything is okay….. everything is okay…..” 

After a few minutes, I managed to get my breathing under control and my heart stopped beating wildly in my chest. I realized that with all the excitement I had to go to the bathroom. Thank God I didn’t go in my bed.

I made my way out of bed and walked to the edge of my room where the steps started. That’s when I noticed that my closet door was slightly opened so I gently pushed it until it clicked closed. “I could’ve sworn I closed it all the way” I whispered to myself. 

I turned my attention back to the steps, I always especially hated going down them at night. The creaks were so loud, but thankfully my dogs were so used to it and didn’t bark when they heard them. Or I used to be thankful. 

I tried to move very slowly to avoid making as much noise as possible. “Creak…Creak… Creak… Creak.” On all twenty steps going down. 

Finally, I reached the bottom, stepping onto the hardwood floor. For some reason, I made the habit of turning around to look at the steps after I reached the bottom every time. 

I would also look to see the opening of the bathroom directly behind them. Early signs of OCD I guess.

I made my way around the steps to the bathroom. I drug my feet to make as little sound as possible. 

I closed, and locked the door behind me. After doing my business, I was washing my hands when all the sounds outside went silent.

The frogs and the crickets all stopped suddenly. This startled me as I remembered what my dad used to tell me.

“Whenever animals go quiet it means there is a predator in the area.” 

I thought to myself, maybe there was a raccoon or owl in the yard. I was pretty sure they ate frogs and crickets. 

I didn’t even finish this thought until I heard something that made my heart drop into my stomach….. 

I heard a door creaking open.

I knew which door it was, there was only one that made that sound. It was my closet door.

I froze and tried to rationalize the sound. Maybe I did not close the door all the way, but I was sure I heard the click of the door closing. “I know I heard it click.”

Then….. it happened. 

I heard….. the footsteps on the stairs….. coming from my room…..

I tried to move, and I tried to scream but I was paralyzed to the floor. Every muscle in my body tightened. There was nothing I could do but count the steps quietly to myself.

“Five….. Creak….. Six….. Creak….. Seven….. Creak….. Eight….. Creak…..” 

I managed to slowly stumble, backwards until the back of my feet were touching the bathtub.

“Eleven….. Creak….. Twelve….. Creak….. Thirteen….. Creak….. Fourteen….. Creak…..” 

I got into the bathtub and pulled the curtains closed, rolled up into a ball, buried my head into my knees, and closed my eyes as I counted the approaching final steps.

“Seventeen….. Creak….. Eighteen….. Creak….. Nineteen….. Creak………. Twenty….. Creak……….”

I took a deep breath waiting for whoever was in the house to get me. I heard the footsteps coming closer and closer.

The footsteps were slow and methodical. It sounded like whoever it was, they were also dragging their feet.

It didn’t sound like shoes on the hardwood floor, they weren’t wearing any shoes? It was barefoot, why was it barefoot?

Whoever was in the house was trying to stay as quiet as possible. Images of a tiger stalking its prey came to mind.

I also started to hear a slight scratching sound. It wasn’t scratching the hardwood floor, it sounded like drywall?

It was scratching the walls as it was dragging its feet across the ground, why was all the sudden making more noise?

Was whoever, they were trying to scare me? No, I knew that sound. 

My grandpa had to wear glasses so when he used the bathroom at night he would drag his hand on the wall to help guide him.

They were trying to find the bathroom door. After minutes of waiting and listening, I heard the scratching start on the wooden bathroom door.

I held my breath as the doorknob in the bathroom started to jiggle and turn. I started shaking, unable to scream or move again, I could only sit there and whisper to myself.

“Please God don’t let it get me! Please God don’t let it get me! Please God don’t let it get me!”

After a few seconds, the handle stopped moving and everything was quiet. I poked my head up and kept listening.

A moment of relief washed over me, it was trying to get inside at least for the moment couldn’t. 

I heard the dragging footsteps start again, this time it sounded like it was walking away. The scratching along the walls also started again. 

This continued for a few more seconds until I heard the sound of scratching wood again, followed by the sound of another door opening close by.

I wondered what it was doing. What door did it open? What door was close to the bathroom? Until I realized…..

“The laundry room is right next to the bathroom…..”

Why would it go inside the laundry room? The only stuff in there were the washer and dryer, dirty clothes and……. a window?

Was it trying to get back outside? Why else would it go inside the laundry room? Was it still looking for me or……?

“The breaker was in the laundry room……….”  

I remembered my dad showing me how the breaker powered all the lights and electronics in the house.

That’s when the lights in the bathroom immediately cut off and I heard all the air conditioners in the house suddenly stop. I was in complete silence and darkness.

I sat there for what felt like hours trying to stay quiet. Tears started forming in my eyes and sweat poured down my head.

I finally told myself, “I need to get to my bed, I’ll be safe in my bed!” Pure childhood logic, hiding in your bed makes all the boogeymen go away. 

I managed to finally stand up and fumble my way to the cabinet over the sink where we kept a spare flashlight. 

I turned it on to make sure it would work. The light wasn’t super bright, but I was able to see at least 2 feet in front of me. 

I knew the layout of the house so I would easily be able to make it to the steps.

I unlocked the door and grabbed the handle. I closed my eyes and kept trying to pump myself up by saying, “I need to get to my bed, I’ll be safe in my bed! I need to get to my bed, I’ll be safe in my bed!”

With one last deep breath, I unlocked, turned the handle and opened the door welcoming in the pitch black darkness…..

I shined the light on the back of the steps and saw…..

Nothing…..

I shined the light down the hallway, and saw…..

Nothing…..

I took a deep breath and looked into the laundry room and saw…..

Nothing…..

The window in the laundry room was open, I could feel the humid air from outside. Did it really leave?

After looking in the empty room for a few seconds I turned around and, still trying to stay quiet, quickly headed for the stairs.

Once I got to the start of the stairs I took one more look up the steps to the opening of my room with the flashlight and through the steps.

I then began my silent but fast ascent back up the steps. Even in my panicked state I still quietly counted the steps as I went up them 

“One….. Creak….. Two….. Creak….. Three….. Creak….. Four….. Creak….. Five…..”

“Boom!”

I got to the fifth step when…..

I felt something grab my leg…..

I fell face first on the hard wooden steps. After reorienting myself I flashed the light down on my ankle. 

A bone dry hand with skin, pitch black as the darkness surrounding us, squeezed my ankle causing me to yelp out in pain. 

I then foolishly looked and flashed my light forward. My face was right in front of one of the openings.

That’s when I saw the most ungodly sight………. the face I see every night when I close my eyes……….

It's…. Face! Oh God, it's face….. its pitch black skin….. that looked too tight to fit on its skull…..

Its eyes….. it had no visible eyes….. they were being blocked…..

Its top lip!

It was pulled back over its eyes and nose only leaving two black holes for nostrils.

It had moist, blood-red gums, with its crooked, misshapen, yellow teeth……

It’s tongue started licking its bottom red lip. It began curving its bottom lip up like it was attempting to smile.

I tried to scream but all I could muster was a whimper, I sobbed and quietly shrieked while the thing seemingly taunted me by clicking and bellowing.

It sounded like an alligator. I could feel its hot breath on my face. It was laughing at me! It was toying with me like how a cat plays with a captured mouse.

I closed my eyes with tears still rolling down my face. And kicked its hand as hard as I could.

That’s when its bottom lip dropped…..

Its half baked attempt at a smile was gone, it tightened its grip around my ankle, and began growling.

I made it angry….. it wasn’t playing with its prey anymore…..

The thing suddenly started pulling my ankle through the opening of  the steps. I tried to scream and started kicking again with my other leg. 

I made contact several times but no matter how hard I kicked it, the thing was unfazed, its skin felt rough and stretched, kind of like a burn blister.

It kept pulling me further through…..

It grabbed a hold of my other ankle and began pulling harder….. I could now feel its hot breath on my legs.

My ankles also felt like they were about to be torn completely off. My back felt like it was on fire from the wood scraping me the entire time. 

The thing had pulled me up to my chest, I held onto the step above with all the strength I had left.

I felt blood start to come from my fingers and they were quickly starting to give way. My nails were being chiseled down and I could hear the tip of my fingers scratching the wood.

It was at that moment I truly thought I was going to die….. My back, burning like fire, my forehead drenched in sweat, my eyes swelling with tears, my fingers bleeding, and my ankles breaking. 

With whatever strength I had left I screamed as loud as I could.

“IN THE NAME OF JESUS!”

I suddenly felt the hands around my ankles let go, I opened my eyes, and flashed the light, the thing was gone…..

I heard the dogs start barking wildly and my parents' door slammed open, the dogs came sprinting to the steps and my mom and dad started screaming my name.

It didn’t matter. I layed there and I sobbed, my mom pulled me out from the steps and into her arms, and I clenched onto her with what little strength I had left.

She tried to calm me down and rock me while my dad fought with the light switch.

I muttered out, “Breaker….. the breaker…..”

My dad ran to the laundry room and a few seconds later all the lights in the house blasted on. 

That’s when my mom screamed as she saw the bruises on my ankles and the blood coming from my fingers. 

That’s when my vision was taken over by an overwhelming white light. I passed out in my mothers arms.

The following weeks were kind of a blur, the police were called and found no evidence of any forced entry. None of the windows were opened.

After I gave my description of the thing that attacked me, I was given a full psychiatric evaluation.

I tried to tell them about my ankles but the bruises were in such a weird pattern that none of the doctors concluded that they came from someone grabbing me.

They concluded that I was sleepwalking and was simply acting out my dream. That answer was good enough for my parents since it was the most logical.
 
I had to see a therapist for a while after the experience. Every single week I had to hear, “It wasn’t real, it was in your head.”

It's been almost seventeen years since the incident. I have since graduated college, moved away, and now own my house out in the countryside. 

The stairs in my parents' house have since been remodeled covering the spaces between the steps. 

I still go to church every Sunday. I know that the only reason I’m still here is because there truly is power in the name.

I don’t care if people don’t believe me. I don't even care if you’re reading this and don’t believe me. 

I know what I felt, I know what I saw, because I remember that feeling of the eight year old me seeing that unholy face looking back at me licking its teeth and lip.

I just leave this message to whoever is reading this, the next time you hear the sounds of creaks in your house at night, count them as they come.

And remember there is power in the name. I pray he saves you too.
 
“Seventeen…Creak…Eighteen…Creak…Nineteen…Creak………. Twenty……….Creak.”
