I lived in a province called Rizal in the Philippines when I was around 6 to 8 years old. Our house was located on a farm in the mountains and we also had a small hut in the property where my mom would play card games every weekend night. Since I was still young, I would just stay in the main house with my nanny. I’m an only child, so my only playmate was my nanny or Ate in Filipino. One night, we played hide n’ seek and Ate was "it” so I hid in my mom’s room.

For context, our second floor was basically the attic because all the rooms were downstairs. Parallel to the stairs was the living room window which had long, translucent curtains. I giggled quietly when I heard Ate going upstairs then slightly opened the door to peek but  was instantly hit by a foul smell, like rotting meat. I gagged so hard that I nearly slammed the door shut. I think after a while, Ate realized I wasn’t upstairs so she headed down instead.

Halfway down the stairs, I heard her stop and say, “Boom, huli ka!” (“Caught you!”) which I found strange because there’s no way she could’ve seen me in the room since the door was closed. I was debating whether I should come out or not when she suddenly yelled and told me not to come out  from wherever I was hiding and to just wait for her. I was so scared and was on the verge of peeing my shorts because I heard the loud thumps of her feet running down the rest of the stairs. It felt like hours before she opened the door to where I was hiding and practically dragged me out to the hut. I could see the panic and sweat on her face while she whispered to my mom. My mom immediately got up and told her friends that they were done playing and will continue another time. That night, the three of us slept together in one room even though Ate usually slept in the living room.

The next morning during breakfast, I overheard Ate talking to one of our other house helpers while they were cooking. Apparently, when Ate was coming down the stairs during our game, she saw a figure hiding behind the long curtain and when she squinted, she saw feet sticking out from underneath. She thought it was me which was why she said, “Boom!” but when she got closer, she saw that the feet looked like they had walked through mud and were rotting. Ate was frozen on the spot as the figure started to slowly move forward from behind the curtain until its whole outline was pressed against it. Ate said it was a woman smiling (I know, sounds cliché, but that’s really what she said) with white eyes. Her clothes were wet and dirty, like she had been buried in soil. Before the woman could fully step out from behind the curtain, Ate ran to find me. She didn’t even look back, even though she could hear rustling sounds getting closer and closer.

After that incident, my mom had the entire farm blessed again and they also burned the curtains. Ate ended up with a really bad fever for a week, always drenched in sweat like someone had been pouring water over her. A lot of strange things happened in that house before, but thankfully, whatever Ate saw never showed up again.
