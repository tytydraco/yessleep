Last Night after dressing my wounds for the third time I laid down for bed. They Are still fresh and it causes me a great deal of discomfort to lie down. Or sit, or move for that matter. I've done a good deal of thinking on the subject and the only feasible thing I can consider is that subconsciously my arms scratched at my own body whilst I scratched at the trees within the dreams cape. However The uniformity and dedication to these scrapes are not those of a sleeping man but a man who deliberately and with good reason marked the surface.

Upon lying down for bed I was fearful to Mar the trees as I had the night before at risk of harming myself in my sleep again. While my wounds are minor and there was no guarantee the result would have been the same I did not want to inadvertently cause more serious damage to myself.  However in the small hours of the night I found it difficult to think of another method of marking the ground I had tread.

I thought to possibly mark the dirt but I remembered,the ground is rather cluttered with debris and such a mark would be rather difficult to discern over time or long distance. Another possibility was driving sticks into the ground as I walked but the ground is cold and hard from what I recall and Driving each stick would either be strenuous or impossible. 

Eventually in the middle of my deliberation I drifted off into slumber and subsequently woke again in the same place, in the position I had been in every time. I stood and glanced around the clearing to find the trees I had marked last night. As I had suspected they were still there, still scarred with fresh scrapes that identified them to be my proverbial trail of breadcrumbs.
I followed them along, picking up a large stick along the way. Despite my doubts I wanted to avoid scraping at more trees once I had arrived to my last marked location. The night prior I had not walked for long. If I had to hazard a guess I would assume around thirty minutes or so, however time is hard to gage in a place absent of any indicators that it had passed.

It does little to help that the time I spend in the woods each night seems to have no pattern. It has been minutes at times and hours at others. Though No matter the time i spend there, I always find myself awake at a time that does not match the amount I've spent there. There have been instances where I've been in the wood for minutes and woken up nearly twelve hours after I had fallen asleep.

Last night I wandered my marks to their end before taking the husky branch and dropping it to drag behind me in order to make a new type of lead. It left a mark but as I expected it was not a significant One, making note that I would have to pay closer attention when I reach this point tomorrow night. 

I wandered straight for a good deal of time. Roughly forty five minutes pulling the heavy branch along the ground with a small amount of downward force placed around the middle of it to allow it to properly dig into the soil. I had made some decent ground when I was pulled from the place in the haze of panic just a small bit outside of midnight. typically i would remain awake and go about my routine, no matter the hour but this time I had a vested interest in investigating my dreamscape.

I glanced down at my torso wrapped in gauze to see if the blood had leaked from it but I found only sweat drenched rags, not as If that revelation was any better.

I'm rambling again.

visited My medicine cabinet, originally to clean the used bandages from my body but was instead drawn to a bottle of melatonin and I had a sort of epiphany if one could call it that. If I force sleep back onto myself I can revisit the place.
So I did exactly that. I swallowed a few and waited in my bed for them to take me back to the forest. And they had. The second time returning I was far more determined to not have progress ripped away.

Thus, when returning I did not wait or walk. I ran, as fast as my legs would take me I ran in the direction of my markings. until i reached the end of scarred trees and on to the pathway the branch had made which surprisingly Enough had been much easier to follow than I had previously expected. Another thing that had surprised me though significantly more perplexing was the absence of labored breathing. Despite my running to this location it displayed no Ill side effects onto me.

I wanted to take advantage of this discovery but when examining my surroundings at the end of my dirt trail I could not find the branch I had used to mark it. Littering the ground where a smattering of twigs and small sticks that would not have had the heft to break Through the dirt and still maintain their integrity so I instead opted for taking a more solid appendage from one of the many trees that populated the wood.
I have yet to find the words to do these arboreian things proper justice but it should be noted that they are large. Smaller than the California redwoods but much larger than the common conifer. Their branches are sturdy And thick and seem to have a sort of…dull glow to them at times, the bark however is a pale color, almost Grey but I suspect it is just a trick Of the light. No.It is a trick of the mind because the place is not real, it is nothing more than a reoccurring dream.

I'm rambling.

The point I am attempting to make is that the trees are strange and gargantuan and the limbs made wonderful candidates for breaking through the ground. 

So I found a low enough branch that dropped enough for me to leap vertically and grab it. It had a spring to it and seemed to be very much alive and it took a good deal of my strength to snap it from its parent. After rending the branch I did as I had before I shoved it into the dirt and this time I began to move as quickly as I possibly could without slipping The branch out of the divot or losing my balance. I walked, or rather jogged for what seemed to be hours before something caught my eyes. Light beckoned me only a small distance ahead. There was a tree.

This one was smaller, a sampling that glowed with a white light much brighter than its siblings.  It stood in a clearing much like my starting point. However, I found myself infuriated when I stood in the clearing to realize it was surrounded By the same god forsaken wooded giants that I have become so familiar with.

I wept there. Overcome with the beauty of something that was so because it was different, I wept because one day it would grow to look just like the clones that circled it. 

During my emotional spat I heard the whispers again, this time more powerful, they held more emotion, spoke louder, with more purpose.
Where It not for my sobs I would have made out what It was they had said to me “we…something,  something…path. Something else”

The moment I heard them I awoke again. 
Overcome with anger I liked from My bed and made to show the closest object to me but was instead greeted by a horrible pain that shot up my arm, I am not too man to admit I shrieked with pain in this moment and with horror the next. I looked to my arm to locate the source of the pain, I assumed another path of thin scratches but instead was met with the bone of my arm protruding from the skin, completely disconnected from its other half. It hung there limp and dangling the pain only made bearable through my pulsing adrenaline. I held the place in which the bone had pierced through my skin and I stood to walk to my bathroom taking note of the wounds around my body beginning to sour a bit. They smelled rancid and leaked a pungent slurry of sweat, blood, and forming infection. Why are they spoiling so fast?

I don't believe I have mentioned this but I am myself a doctor. I have not attended and will not attend the hospital because I could not allow my co workers to sew me this way. I refuse to allow them to think they are working with a mad man.
I set the bone myself through a great deal of pain and gritted Teeth I managed to pair the jagged pieces of the carion puzzle together before placing a makeshift splint over it.

As I write this now, my arm still damaged. Torso is still covered in gnarled scratches to say that tonight I will listen closer to the whispers, I will continue to travel forward within the wood because in only two nights I have suffered far too much to simply ignore the place and dawdle aimlessly like I had before. 

Next time I will mind the trees
