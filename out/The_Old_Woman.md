I was on my way home from a late-night shift at the hospital when my car broke down on a deserted stretch of road. I was miles away from civilization, and my phone had no signal. I was stranded.  
  
As I sat in my car, feeling helpless, I saw an old woman walking down the road towards me. She looked frail and tired, and I felt sorry for her. I rolled down my window and asked if she needed help.  
  
The woman smiled at me, and I could see that she had only a few teeth left. She said that she lived nearby and offered to let me stay the night at her house while I waited for a tow truck.  
  
I was hesitant, but I didn't have any other options. I got out of my car, and the woman led me down a narrow path that led to a small, dilapidated house.  
  
The woman's house was old and musty, and I felt uneasy as soon as I stepped inside. The furniture was old and worn, and the walls were covered in faded wallpaper. I noticed that there were no family photos or personal belongings in the house - it was as if the woman lived alone.  
  
I was exhausted, and the woman offered me a room to rest in. As I lay in bed, I could hear strange noises coming from the rest of the house. It sounded like someone was moving around, but when I got up to investigate, there was no one there.  
  
I tried to sleep, but I couldn't shake the feeling that I was being watched. The house felt alive, like it was hiding secrets in its walls. I was scared, but I didn't want to be rude to the old woman who had offered me a place to stay. I decided to tough it out and try to get some rest.  
But then I heard a bloodcurdling scream coming from outside my room. I jumped out of bed and ran towards the sound. I found the old woman lying on the floor in a pool of blood, her throat slashed open.  
I was horrified and ran back to my room to call for help, but my phone was missing. I searched the entire house, but I couldn't find it. I realized that I was trapped in the house with a killer, and I had to find a way to escape.  
I searched the house again, looking for any clues or weapons that could help me. That's when I found a hidden door in the basement. It led to a secret room, filled with creepy antique dolls and dusty old books.  
As I searched the room, I found a journal that belonged to the old woman. It contained disturbing entries about her descent into madness, and how she had killed her own family and neighbors to please a demonic entity that she had made a deal with.  
I knew then that I had to get out of the house as fast as possible. I made my way back upstairs, but I was ambushed by the killer. It was the old woman, still alive and wielding a bloody knife.  
We struggled, but I managed to overpower her and flee the house. I ran as fast as I could, and eventually, I stumbled upon a road where a passing car picked me up and took me to safety.  
The police investigated the old woman's house and found evidence that linked her to several unsolved murders in the area. I was lucky to have escaped with my life, but the memories of that terrifying night have haunted me ever since. I now have a deep fear of old, abandoned houses and the horrors that they may hold.
