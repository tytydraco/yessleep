Someone once said there are never any clean deaths in life. Death is never cinematic. It's either far too quick or far too slow. Young as I was, I couldn't grasp it at first. Mom and Dad would have long talks alone, sometimes it'd grow in volume but never above a whisper. They didn't want me knowing. Rocky couldn't hear them either, though he never left. Always lurking, always hanging over me.

For years this spectre haunted me. I even had to go to a sleep clinic because there were numerous nights I couldn't sleep with Rocky there. I dare not tell anyone. I had reached the point where I realized that if I had told anyone, they'd most likely throw me in some insane asylum. Let's not even entertain the idea of what it would be like if people did believe what I saw. It was when I was about eight years old that mom and dad pulled me aside. They were, at last, open and honest about what the problem was.

Cancer.

I don't know the word for it. Irony? Dark humor? Some divine amusement that in my life where I was constantly the unwilling host to a saw-mouthed monster that saw me as its one friend, the most normal of horrors had crept into my life? I wouldn't know the word for it. But it certainly changed things. Money around my house became tighter. Mom went in for more treatments as time went on. We'd have peaks and valleys where it looked like mom would get better only for it to reappear like an ugly ghost.

It was during this hospital visit that I saw the...antithesis of Rocky. Or whatever the alternative to him was. We had gone to a hospital so mom could get more bloodwork done. It was the first time I had opted to come along. I felt I was old enough to handle it now at the mature, adult age of ten. Walking the halls of hospital, I saw them. They looked like your classic grim reaper. Dark-hooded things, slowly and mournfully moving up and down the hallways.

Loud and panicked beeping went off. My family moved to the side as multiple doctors came rushing down the hallway with a massive cart of supplies and medical equipment. The voices were rushed and panicked. IV drips. Drugs. Things I couldn't pronounce as they tried to save someone's life. A young man, from the sound of it. I knew they had failed when I heard things go quiet...and then the screaming began. That horrid screaming. That screaming I knew would bring other things like Rocky.

But this time, it didn't.

The black-robed things began to congregrate as I saw his blue spirit wildly thrash, trying to push them away. He didn't speak, the man howling like an animal even as they descended upon him. But there was no ripping, no squelching. There wasn't any sound at all. One by one, they held him. His spirit wasn't torn apart, he simply seemed to fade away like dust. A peaceful...end? I wouldn't know for sure. Maybe they were just the kinder alternative to Rocky. Either way, their end seemed very preferrable to whatever Rocky would do.

This was the visit, however, that would make things go wrong. For years they had tried everything they could with mom. Delays, hopes, chances. Today, there would be no second chance; Her cancer had progressed to being terminal. They could keep her alive longer, to be sure, but it wasn't going to last. She had to make a choice. Prolong things...or let them run their course.

We went home in silence that day, contemplating. I cried. A lot. I was sad. I was losing my mom. It was the worst thing that could have happened to me...until I heard her ask for something that made my stomach drop into the pavement: "Jacob. I want hospice. I...I want to be home."

Hospice. That word I knew. It's when people died at home. A home where Rocky was. There was no way I could convince her. I was old enough to realize that and knew things wouldn't work out in my favor. That'd mean I'd have to do something I hadn't in years. I'd have to talk to Rocky. When we arrived home, I quickly got up the stairs. Mom and Dad thought I needed time alone.

Rocky was there today, watching me as I locked eyes with him. His head tilted. "You haven't looked at me like that in a long time. Those eyes. Those lights..."

"You need to leave," I demanded in a quiet whisper.

"...Why?" he'd ask.

"Because I said so." I didn't want to tell him the truth. "If you're my friend. If you EVER were my friend? You'll leave. NOW."

A long silence. The room thick with tension. Rocky stared at me, those hands scraping the floor. He'd move closer, crawling on all fours to get at eye-level with me. A boy, trying to be strong in the face of a monster. "No."

"W-What do you mean no? I want you o-out!" I stuttered, trying to hold my ground.

"No. I am not leaving. Your lights. Your voice. I need them. I want them. But that's not why I'm not leaving, no no. I'm not leaving because I can smell it." Those slits on Rocky's face opened, breathing in deeply, fingers dragging along the ground.

"...The...smell?" I moved away from him. Rocky's anatomy had only gotten worse as I got older, but the smelling never sat right with me.

Deep inhales resounded in the room. "Oooh, I can smell it. Something's close. Something's decaying. Soon..." Rocky muttered. "...Someone's crossing. Maybe they'll cross over soon. I need it. I want it. I have to feast. I MUST feast."

"Y-you're...you're a freak. A monster."

"No. I am an animal like any other. We're all animals. We all have needs. And I need this." Rocky clawed his way away from me, but those deep inhales never left. He kept sniffing, drinking in the stench of death. Drinking in my mom dying. I had never been more angry, never more scared and never more helpless.

The next two years went by both like a flash and agonizingly slow at the same time. More family came to visit. Dad spiraled into depression. Mom tried to keep things happy even as she degraded and all the while, out of the corner of my eye, I could see Rocky. He grew bolder day by day, wandering around our house like a beast claiming territory. A ward to anyone else around that this was his to have. I wanted to punch younger me for bringing in a feral monster into our home.

And just like that, there we were. Most of the family was gathered around the bed. Mom lay there, gaunt and pale. She looked between all of us, holding my dad's hand. And there was too, Rocky. Looming over the entire preceedings, eyes fixed on my mother.

There were tears abound by everyone but I was holding it together as best I could. Mom looked at me. "Honey?"

"Yeah?" I stared at her. Her eyes were sunken by sickness. Mine were sunken in horror and sorrow.

"I love you and always will, you know that right?"

I nodded. I knew that was true.

"And you know I'm always going to be watching over you, right?"

I nodded. I knew that was a lie.

"If you're ever..." Mom started saying something. She continued to say something. But I couldn't hear her words, my eyes growing wide. Tears ran down my face. The people around me must have thought I had broken down at last at everything happening. In truth, I could recognize the sound. Like rainfall hitting wood. Drip. Drip. Drip. I knew what it was, my eyes wandering. I wish I hadn't looked.

Rocky was drooling from that open, knife-filed maw, right onto the floor.

Mom smiled at me. "You're going to be ok." I wasn't. "I love you so much and I'll always be here." She wouldn't. "Do you all mind...if I close my eyes? For just a moment?"

"Go ahead mom." Inside I was screaming at her not to shut her eyes. Not to let go. Her eyes shut. Her breathing slowed...and slowed...and slowed. I could bear it. I ran. I left the room and I ran into mine. I shut the door, I locked the door. I stuffed my head under a pillow, I turned on the tv, I started playing music. Even so, I could hear my family in the other room. They were all crying, talking, speaking among themselves. I could hear them. I could hear everything.

The screaming started. My mom's voice. It didn't last long at all. Before I had only heard Rocky's work from afar. A room away, I could hear every horrid thing. My mind could piece together similar sounds alone: The wet, slashing sound like a butcher's knife cleaving through meat. The bludgeoning noises of heavy hands on something soft and wet. The sound of someone overturning a bucket, spraying its contents on the floor and around the room. The screaming devolved into soft cries, gurgling, choked grasps. And then the other sound. The gorging. The wet noises of a jawless maw cramming in anything that could feet, tearing chunks apart. 

It lasted for about ten minutes but it felt like a thousand years. Anger welled in me alongside my terror. Let me tell you, reader, that fear and hate intermingle. They're lovers, close spirits and they make a home together. For the first time, I felt something other than fear about Rocky spread through me: Raw, unbridled hatred. After all, he just killed my mom.

Rocky didn't return to my room until an hour later. I don't know if it was some manner of clarity after "eating" or genuine guilt. But return he did. Fingers and teeth, stained in blue as he'd look at me before moving to a corner to sit.

"Get out," I whispered.

"It had to be this way," Rocky responded.

"I'm going to kill you."

At this, Rocky snapped his head towards me. Shock. Not that he felt betrayed or hurt, like I had said something that wounded him. No, this was a look of surprise. Not once since this thing had crossed over had it been threatened. There was almost a look of amusement in its eyes...and then it smiled. That bloody hole of a maw twisted into the closest thing of a grin it could. "Good luck."

Rocky crawled out of the window then, leaving behind a trail of gore. A trail I could never wash out. When I'd sleep, when I'd come home, I'd always see it. The dark blue stain of what my mom had been. 

There is not much more to it. We buried her remains. Dad was depressed but he moved on. I didn't. I never did. After what happened, Rocky never came back. I know Rocky is out there in this in-between. And it is why I am writing this; Consider this my confession. This will be the last you hear of me because I figured it out. I have figured out what makes you into something like Rocky when you die. I am an adult now with the funds and capabilities to finish this plan.

I am going to do many things, terrible things. I am going to drink deep of the well of monsters and give myself every single fighting chance I have against that horrible thing. And when I feel I have drank as much as I could until bile fills my soul, I am going to return to my home from when I was a boy and cross over. I am going to find Rocky and I will make him pay. I don't know if I can stop a monster and the thought of seeing him again fills me with dread and horror. But it also fills me with hate. And hate will drive me forward.

I know what happens when you die and god willing, I am going to make Rocky find out what happens after.
