Hey there back again I’m trying to take time to get my posts out there but it’s getting harder to find the time to write these down but I will continue to get these entries out here as soon as I can, here we go.



When the car first came into contact with the metal shutters they began to screech as if this door could feel every shred of agony we were about to go through but unfortunately our pain would not be so short lived, next I heard the cries of the poor puppets that desperately clung to us still begging for the salvation they thought we could provide all the while they were being caught on every piece of jarring metal and ripped and torn through the back of the car staining us crimson combining with the tears in my eyes, the last thing I could do was brace myself for a quick death and closed my eyes as everything came back up to high speed and it all went black.



I’m not sure how much time passed when I eventually gained consciousness but the only important fact I took note of was that I was still breathing, my senses all coming back slowly bringing with them all the pain I had missed out on during my beauty sleep. I reached over next to me to try and see if Matt was still in one piece but when I felt nothing but an empty chair beside me my heart sank. I was alone, he was gone and the sounds of pleas for help were drawing in closer.



 I had no time to waste I pushed the door as hard I could but it wouldn’t give in, I was losing time the sounds were getting closer with each passing moment the best bet I had was to kick out the remaining glass and make my way out through the remnants of the windshield, wincing as I was getting caught on the sharp glass. I had no thoughts. I was reduced to a wild animal running on instinct alone telling me to claw and scrape and run.



I ran in a frenzied panic as fast as I could, not caring about my injuries, not knowing how severe they might be, but also looking for any possible places I could hide, leaving the hooked blood bags searching for me behind. Throwing myself over the counter of a nearby fast food place I tucked myself under the desk and curled into a ball covering my face desperate not to make a sound as the fast approaching noises of rage and desperation seemed to almost turn into a series of thunderous shouts I could only imagine what kind of abomination was on its way to tear me apart. Praying to anything and everyone I could think of to let this all wash away and take away all the torturous hate that was spewing from the mass of people only a few feet away. I hoped to wake up after some drug fuelled nightmare that I had put myself in, that my subconscious dreamed up this whole hell, but that wasn’t true I slowly opened eye’s as the shouts and wails of the slave driven dead were pulled away deeper into the mall leaving only my shaking bruised torn body in its wake.



I laid there for a while not daring to move, I was teetering on the brink. I had to gain back control of myself. I slowed my breathing, counted up to thirty then back down just like my sister had showed me when this was last happening. The memories of these time’s started to flood my mind slowly, threatening to push me back down the mental stairs I had climbed up back to a stable frame of mind but I pushed them to the side. This was not the time or place for revisiting a shitty time in my life. The only thing I needed to focus on right now was finding a new way out of town, there had to be a car still lingering in the multi-car park before that though I slowly rose above the counter still looking and listening for any signs of “people” but it was too difficult to make out anything the power seemed to be out or at least the lights were turned off, the only light available was the cold light of the moon shining through the skylight that seemed to span most of the mall, except something was wrong with it the moon I mean it seemed almost discoloured I obviously couldn’t make it out, but it just made my small blessing of light seem that much more sinister as if we were all being watched from hundreds of miles away. 



Dismissing this haunting feeling I turned away from the skylight and thought to grab a map from one of the nearby stands, looking at this I could see that I would have to carefully make my way through the food courts and the rest of this colossal sized shopping centre and head towards the security office near the back, hopefully I would find something to defend myself with. Finally after everything had calmed down and once I’d made my plan my thoughts turned to Matt. Where the hell was he? Had he abandoned me or had he been ripped out of the car and taken just as everyone else had? Strung up for me to see calling for help? Begging to be cut free of his strings. Even if he did leave me I still want to find him I just don’t think I can do this alone, the thought of being trapped here with all these beasts was almost enough to make me fall apart. It didn’t matter I need a way out so I took my first steps into this dark freezing place while still hoping I would be able to save myself.



After leaving the food courts I kept low to the ground, it was clear after the amount of noise I had made in my explosive entry, that all the puppets had followed through after desperate in their search for the both of us. By now since most of the action had calmed down they also seemed to settle down. There was a sudden realization about them, their cries for help had ceased. The only way I could tell they were still here was that their ghostly silhouettes were just hovering in place, deathly still as if they were desperately trying to be a part of the background waiting intensely for me or any other prey to slip up and fall into their clawing snatching hands. 



 The further I went into the mall I started to see more of the tendrils strewn around, all over the walls and floors, it was getting harder to make my way around them in the dark I didn’t have a clue if they would come alive at the slightest touch and make me another one of their unwilling actors in their grotesque performance at playing human. Whatever had come here was intent on taking every last living person for a purpose I could only shudder at. Not missing a step between each safe space of untangled floor I had only a short distance to cover before I got to the security office that was when I heard the slightest groan from only a couple feet away “**Please…don’t go…**” 



I came to a halt immediately the noise catching me off guard I slowly turned to the source of the sound seeing the remnants of a face protruding from the wall of tendrils, I nearly slipped as I took a fear stricken step backwards “Oh Christ” I said with shaky breath. Not everyone is so lucky to be turned into a mindless puppet, every person is needed yes but just not for gathering. Some it seemed were needed as livestock and as I looked at this poor victim I had realized I had driven us straight into the slaughterhouse.



 The “person” that was against the wall in front of me looked as if they had been in piranha infested waters and left without hope of rescue, parts of their face were missing chunks taken out by the almost silent chewing of the tendrils going over their body again and again. I was sick to my stomach I didn’t know what to do. What could have I done honestly? Please I’m really asking. I still think about this now. Every night I see their face I had no idea who this person was but the impact they have left on my life in those short moments will haunt me for the short time I have left. But that was only the precursor to my night terrors because when I thought I could muster up the courage to put this poor creature out of their misery I had no idea how many people were here not until I began to hear the muffled cries and screams beneath the walls of flesh. 



The calls started slowly. I took a step back tears in my eye’s. The small whimpers began to turn into loud pleads. I turned away from the slow slaughter of innocents and the chewing of a million hungry mouths. I could feel her eyes on me. “**Don’t go…**” she pleaded, I began to sob “I’m so sorry” I said barley above a whisper. As I started to run away they all began to scream in unison, the walls, the ceiling “**SAVE US! DON’T LEAVE!**” ”**COWARD!**” ”**KILL US!**” I could feel them all coming down around me. Blaming me, hating me and all I could do was apologize and run away. Please I need you to understand. If I could do anything I would have. But I just kept running until I saw the salvation of the security office sign then slammed the door behind me. The noise I made didn’t matter because what can you hear above the screams of hundreds and thousands? Nothing. Except for pain and the accusations they cast. 



I’m sorry I know I need to keep writing it’s just this one is harder to revisit. I’ll come back as soon as I can I need to rest. Moving is getting harder and harder but I’ll catch you up when I’m feeling up to it again.
