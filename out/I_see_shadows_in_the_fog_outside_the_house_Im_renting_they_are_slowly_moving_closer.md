I didn't know where else to post this, so I may just do it here. I don't want to be begging for help neither do I want any support. I just want to make as many people aware as possible, never should you rent a house near Lough Gara...



It all 4 days ago, I went for a little vacation to Ireland to take a break from the city life in New York. Initially my destination was a small town known as Ballymote, but while looking around the area I saw that there was a nice house near lake "Lough Gara" it was no brainer I thought, it had 5 starts and seemed like a nice place. I didn't need to be near any tourist attractions as I've already been to Ireland 7 years ago, that time I stayed in county Clare and have been to most tourist attractions, this time all I wanted is a week in the nature. After looking at reviews I've noticed that there were only 2 reviews and that the place has been only open for a month, which was probably the reason why I didn't see it while planning the trip. After countless busses and taxis I have finally made it to Monasteraden. It was even smaller than Ballymote, but close to Ballaghaderreen which was a relatively big town compared to the others. For all shopping I would have to go there. Which would require getting a lift or a taxi, but it wasn't a big issue I though back then. I had already made a stop there while going to Monasteraden to get some basic groceries and familiarized myself with the town.

It was getting late by the time I made it to the house, the sun was setting and a light rain was drizzling onto me. I texted the owner that I have made it to the house, and was also delighted to find out that there was WiFi in the house. Upon entering I saw that there was a small kitchen, a bedroom and a small bathroom. The house was quite small but still comfy. I unpacked my belongings and went to turn on the TV, only to find that there was no TV in the house. It was understandable, TVs can be quite costly and maybe it was something to do with the TV license, either way I had WiFi which allowed me to watch YouTube. I made myself some Irish Tea and found the Teacakes I bought in Ballaghaderreen, I enjoyed the final moments of the sunset as the moonlight slowly replaced the sunlight. I went to bed.

The next morning I woke up to see a really heavy fog outside, It was so thick that I could not see the closest electricity pole which was just about 30 feet away from the window. I decided to just wait out the fog, but it lasted till the end of the day. I tried going outside but it was hard to enjoy the nature when you could not even see the said nature. I spent the rest of the day eating some frozen meals and watching YouTube, hoping that it would get better the next day. While making my way back to my bed, the noise of the clock and the fridge in the kitchen was broken by a knock on one of the windows, I turned around to see who knocked. No one was visible... I decided that it was a bird perhaps, or I just misheard something. But then 10 minutes later while I was lying on the bed, scrolling through reddit. I heard it again, this time it was louder... A lot louder. I stood up and looked, no one again. I even went outside to check, but still no one, though I did seem to see that the fog has became weaker. I could see the outlines of the trees and bushes while the day before they weren't visible. But also some tall shadows, it was hard to see what they were at the time. So I didn't really think much of them and went back into the house, I managed to fall asleep. At night even through sleep I could hear occasional knocking, but still managed to sleep until 9am. 

After waking up I saw that the fog was still there, Weaker again. The shadows were clearer, I could make out that they looked almost human. But they were tall, also they were a lot closer than the last night. At first I wasn't sure what to do, maybe this all was a nightmare. No, it felt real. It had to be real... I went outside to make sure, I knew it was a stupid decision but I had to be sure that it wasn't my mind. When I got outside, I could hear a low pitched hum coming from the distance and rough gasping that the shadows made. I went inside and quickly called the owner, he answered. But as soon as I told him what was happening he hung up, I tried calling him again and again, but I was ignored. Eventually I called the police, or should I say Garda, they didn't believe me at first. But I convinced them to send someone to check on me, I was warned that I could be fined for making false calls. I didn't care at that point. I stayed inside for the rest of the day, no one showed up, I decided to call the owner again; No answer. After calling the emergency services again, they said that someone had to have responded by that time. They said to call them 3 hours later if no one would be with me by then, I agreed.

It was 1am yesterday, 3 hours have passed since the last time I called. I dialed the emergency services once again, and confirmed that no one showed up. I was told that the officers who should have been here have disappeared, and that they have sent a special unit to me. After they asked me a bit more questions I was told to stay inside and wait. I did wait until morning, I tried watching YouTube to relax. And cooked a meal to myself, but the unease didn't go away which was unsurprising. The shadows were slowly moving in, and I knew that if no one showed up it could be it... I got a call from unknown caller in the evening, they told me that they were with the emergency services. The caller asked me if it would be possible for me to get something bright, I was told that special unit had some "difficulties" getting to me and that a helicopter was dispatched. The only issue was that my location wasn't on the map, and that gps didn't even show my location so I had to signal my location to the helicopter myself. The caller never explained in detail what "difficulties" they were. But I figured that it didn't matter much, if I was actually gonna be rescued. I said that I'll call them again once I found something. After some more searching all I found was a flashlight, which I knew wasn't enough. I thought about making a campfire, but decided that it would be my final resort as I didn't want to spend more than a minute outside. I called the number again, I explained that all I had was a flashlight. The caller told me that tomorrow (today) I will need to have to found a way to signal them, or else I'll have to wait until the fog has cleared. I was left hopeless.

I haven't slept last night, It's 10am. I am currently thinking about ripping off some of the floor boards to make a campfire, I know this might not even work. But what other choice do I have? I will search around a bit more, and if I don't find anything, I will try doing the campfire thing. The shadows are really close now, I can hear the hum inside the house now. The fog is a bit weaker once again. I don't know what will come out of this, but i'll try to keep you updated...
