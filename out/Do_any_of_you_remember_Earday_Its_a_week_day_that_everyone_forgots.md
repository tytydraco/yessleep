No? Yea I didn't think so. I usually forget it myself if I don't go through my mnemonic routines trying to remember my daily necessities. This might seem like an insane statement if you don't personally know me. But all you need to know about the subject is that I started taking notes and daily rereading and forcefully memorizing them in order to combat a brain injury that thankfully healed years ago. But old habits die hard. But this \*\*Post\*\* is not about that.

First of all. After going through these mnemonics. I stumbled around an event That was completely necessary for me to attend(lets say meeting a friend). It was planned to occur at this odd day called Earday. From what I wrote about it. The date matches in the calendar what Thursday would have been at the same time. When I recheck my calendar the event never existed in that time and I have a similar engagement in a completely different date. (I am keeping the details obscure to protect my privacy).

As if I accidentally signed up to something twice. That is if I believe my notebook over my calendar. Anyone else would have chalked it up to a brain fart or something similar. This doubt would have been with me, if it wasn't for some memories returning the longer I meditate on that day and what I did in it.

You might be wondering why I don't just leave it and move on. 'You just miss wrote something its okay'. But you don't know me. I live in an incredibly structured frame of reality. My understanding of all I believe to be real and objective truth is written down in my notebook, I don't write down my thoughts and daydreams in this book. Its sole existence is based on this truth and its just been proven false. I won't be able to trust the validity of the topics I write down in my notebook in the 100% range I usually  assume. I would not be as comfortable depending on it as I did before.

My tactics of retracing actions and attempting to manually remember every event has eliminated the chance of misremembering events and occasions. I restructured my life for such a thing to rarely happen to me if it ever even happens. Feeling the sense of losing a memory is traumatic to me and makes me dwell on this feeling of casually forgetting/imagining/hallucinating something that may or may not happen.

In my notebook. The very first occurrence of the name of this odd weekday was 4 months ago. It was written as if I was having trouble in remembering that I need to do something at that day and was constantly struggling to commit it to memory. As if it was actively being wiped from all of existence while I was actively remembering it and my memorization process took long enough for my memory of a memory of the word to have survived what ever spell a cosmic horror casted to wipe it out of all our collective consciousness and material references.

This would have been just an interesting peculiarity. If it was just a name for a retired weekday and all calendars collapsed their days from 8 to 7 days. But from what I observed in my research. The weekday Earday(through research i found out it means (Earth's day, Old English "Eor√æe")) was not wiped from existence. We are all still existing when it passes. Its just that we never seem to remember it.

This realization shook me to my core. What is happening in these days and why does it seem like there are never any material effects to our normal days. Our finances, The food in our fridge and literally any other material effect that could be observed.

Well I have figured out a bit of the mechanisms. But it would be easier for me to just flow all my discoveries in a queue of surprises to you. So you stay engaged and so you wont forget what you are actively reading in this moment. (if you notice, that you have not followed this post properly. Please use one of my favorite memorization tactics to combat mental fog. Every time you read one new word, reread all preceding words from the beginning until the next new word. You will deeply memorize all the text you read from now on. For this subject you might have to restart this process multiple times).

So lets start before I believed Earday was a real weekday. At that time my attempts at trying to remember these enigmatic days was wasted on tangents and real life responsibilities. At this point I have been pulling hair trying to figure out. Why I seem to have miss remembered such an important event months ago. Even though the event occurred and passed in a different date. I was still obsessing with the oddity of the subject.

Through days of research and back tracing all my activities. I memorized all interlinked events and heavily focused on oddities. Through this I discovered that this misremembering is systemic and Every time it occurs, its between Wednesday and Thursday.

After becoming hyper aware. For the first time I actually remembered what happened when it was Earday. I woke up that day wrote down a paragraph or three of my current research of Earday as if i was not even living it and went through my normal routine. Ate, brushed and left for work. My work day was normal. But everything i typed in my computer screen was gibberish.

My boss and colleagues were discussing meetings about nonsense topics. Such as "Scandinavian names that rhyme with Margret"  and "Deconstructing the office furniture to lower global warming" I promise this is not a normal topic that is acceptable in my job.

From an outside perspective these all seem like normal activities everyone is just doing. When you recall the passed event. But when you actually try to remember what the actual substance of any of these topics that might have been discussed you draw a blank. I would have pointed out more stuff of that day. But i actually forgot most of it and these tidbits are the tiny fragments that passed through.

Eventually It becomes easier to remember. When you commit it to memory the day you wake up right in the start of Thursday and trying to remember what happened yesterday. You will be able to really drill them in and avoid the memory loss to a certain extent. And the amnesic effect is also weaker When you already know a lot like I am starting to. The more you know of what happens in these days, the more you remember.

The next week. I made another discovery. In Earday My wife made me a large apple pie. This would have been a normal statement. If only i was married. I don't even have a girlfriend. I don't know the woman, but I remember her fondly. This interloper in my life seems to have a comfortable and lazy relationship with me. As if we knew each other for many years.

We spoke nonsense to each other and I left for work and this time we had a team building exercise that happens once a month. I recall that this event already happened two days ago. So it seems like events get dislocated forwards and backwards in date relative to Earday.

When I woke up. I had a vague recollect of the events and I instantly jolted awake and started writing down all events and observed objects. The more the better. I was confused multiple times by my dreams and my memory of yesterday. As they both occupied a similar level of haziness. And quickly leaving my mind. As if beasts bucking and fighting for an exit from my memory. I usually keep a detailed dream journal to make sure nothing is forgotten. But considering the magical situation currently. I will have to abandon this private tradition.

What struck me the most from that dream was that my life situation actually differed from my reality. This strange woman occupied a position in my life that is impossible in reality. NOT because I cant get married. But I haven't yet and I was working under the assumption everyone just wakes up as zombies in those days. Every single person I have seen is a person that exists in my life normally. My neighbors and coworkers. Some people in transit that I often see go to work or school are there.

But who is this woman. I have no idea who she is and have never seen her before. She doesn't live in my house so how could I wake up to see her. Wait... Is she really not in this house.

I sense a creeping foreboding in that moment. I slowly move to every closed door and open it. Terrified to see what could be a feeble tiny woman. Door 1.. check. The room is empty and there doesn't seem to be anything. Door 2.. check. The same as the last one.

I continue this process for Door 3,Door 4, Door 5, etc.. I am relieved to see that there is no stranger in my sanctuary. Sorry for frighting you. I am just trying to convey the fear I felt in that moment. Let me continue to explain my next discoveries.

For the next two weeks consecutively. They both now included this new entity called Wife(i don't know her name). My days at work were also the same as every other time. I submit my completed work each time with my normal writing at the start. But any work done after the day starts was filled with Gibberish. Its as if an angsty teen wrote half a report and got sick of it and padded the rest with junk. Hopping no one notices.

Whats truly unique is that this is the point I realized the amnesic effect is weakening considerably. As if this forbidden knowledge got used to me and surrendered in its attempts to escape my mental vice trap. Allowing me to grasp even more of its body with each following attempt.

This next week was what truly spooked me to comprehend this is an unnatural state of the world. It is not a magical plane of existence that I discovered and can pioneer its reclamation to add more workdays for everyone. Maybe the reason no one can remember it. Is to protect them from observing this horror.

When I woke up on Earday. My wife was crying, The amnesic effect was particularly high as I don't recollect anything except her weeping and then her death. I mourned and cried for her. I don't know what happened and any attempts on trying to recall draws a blank. Its really not in my head anymore. No matter what I could not remember anymore details of the morning. What was most upsetting was that I went to work that day and deep depression hugged me as I spent my work day typing out nonsense.

Everyone was depressed. No one was happy in my work place. I could not really understand why everyone was so upset. Was what happened to me a universal event.

When I woke up the next day in Thursday. I did the same as every week and wrote down everything as fast as possible. But this time it was different. I was actually depressed and sad. This is the first time anything from Earday passed to the next day.

I went out into public and saw a seen of general gloom. people were sad and less smiling face were seen than Normal. Is this what seasonal sadness is. Something out of our realm of knowledge is taken away from us and the backlash it induces leaves us depressed.

How many unexplained mental illnesses come from these unknowable events that occur in a day that we all collectively forget.

Or maybe we choose to forget.

I will share my next discoveries in a later date, when the recollection of this event stops affecting me so badly. I still have 2 months of active research logs left. But I still want to gauge how many people are still able to hold the memory of Earday long enough to finish reading this whole post. Before I waste my time trying to teach it to more people that cant hold it in memory. Maybe I finally lost memory of Earday and these months of obsession just disappear.  Not even remembered as a bad dream.
