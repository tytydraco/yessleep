**"Or What?"**

It started with a broadcast. A deep, distorted voice emanated from every radio, television, and internet stream simultaneously. The message was simple but chilling: *“The truth has been hidden. Decide for yourselves. Or what?”*

No one knew where it came from, but the world went into chaos within hours. Flat Earth forums exploded, their members claiming validation. Alien believers pointed to the skies, insisting that the broadcast was proof of extraterrestrial interference. Governments scrambled to contain the uproar, issuing statements that only deepened suspicions. The phrase *“Or what?”* became a rallying cry for everyone who believed the world wasn’t as it seemed.

In Quebec, the fleur-de-lis flag rose higher than ever as whispers spread about secret archives hidden in Montreal. They claimed the Vatican and NASA conspired to bury evidence of ancient extraterrestrial encounters. A shadowy group known as *Les Veilleurs* promised to reveal everything if they could breach the supposed vault.

Meanwhile, a group of scientists working in a crumbling observatory claimed to detect a signal from deep space—encoded within it, a map that led to a city long buried beneath the desert sands. But just as they prepared to publish their findings, the lead scientist mysteriously vanished, leaving behind a hastily scrawled note that simply read: *“We were never alone.”*

Conspiracy layered upon conspiracy. Some argued the world governments had colluded to inject microchips via vaccines, controlling humanity under the guise of health. Others believed the Earth was no globe but a flat plane, surrounded by an impenetrable wall of ice. The chaos spilled into the streets, with holograms of aliens projected on skyscrapers, protests demanding the "truth," and people wearing tinfoil hats with grim determination.

In the middle of it all, an amateur astronomer named Dana sat in her basement, poring over her telescope data. She didn’t believe in conspiracies—at least, not at first. But the patterns she saw in the stars didn’t match anything she’d learned. It was as if the entire sky had shifted overnight. Or had it always been this way, hidden in plain sight?

Then, the broadcast returned. The same voice, clearer this time. *“Decide your truth. The clock is ticking. Or what?”*

The message ended with coordinates pointing to an unmarked location in the Arctic. A team of journalists, thrill-seekers, and doomsday preppers raced to the site. What they found was beyond anything they imagined: a monolithic structure, part machine, part organism, glowing with an otherworldly light. Inside, carvings depicted two Earths—one round, one flat—colliding in a cosmic battle.

The final message carved into the stone read: *“You were warned. Or what.”*

As the ground beneath them began to tremble, the group realized that the choice wasn’t about believing one version of the truth or the other. It was about something far worse: what happens when both are wrong.Here's a story inspired by the image:
