It all started a couple of weeks ago. We were on a walk through the old town near my apartment, it had become mine and my daughter’s tradition every weekend since the divorce. A way to keep us close together and bring a sense of normality back to her life. It was also for me, my therapist recommended it. She said it would help to calm the voices. We came across a shop we hadn't seen there before, it was an old shop. It was strange, staring at it blocked out all the noise of the traffic going down the road. Almost as if even looking at it trapped me in its own world, I should have never brought my daughter into that shop. I should have just let her stay at home playing her silly little video games "getting that loot" as I always hear her say. She begged me to go in with her, Since the divorce I feel like I can't say no to her even after the stands on my foot while begging for an ice cream sandwich from the van in town. In we went and the first thing that catches my eye was this old, dilapidated doll. It was so ragged it looked like it had experienced time in a bloody dog’s mouth. Unfortunately, it wasn't only my eyes it caught... my daughter had an instant attachment to this fucking doll. Immediately begged me to buy it for her, of course I did. I was stupid. I was reckless. I could have just bought her a fucking teddy. But I didn’t, I should have known something was off when the old lady at the desk said to just take it. My mother always told me that nothing in this world is free, everything has a price… even if its not monetary, I just didn’t know I’d be paying with my soul.  


As soon as we got hope she practically ripped the front door off its bracket, going straight up to her bedroom and slamming the door. I didn’t see her for the rest of the night, the part that still sends shivers down my spine. I heard 2 sets of footsteps after she went into her room. I can still hear the carousel music that was blasting from her room. Looking back at it now, that was the night I lost my daughter. Lost her to that fucking doll. She wasn’t the same after that night, the next day when she was going back to my ex’s house. We have a strict rule to keep things at each other’s house, nothing goes between houses. It was almost impossible to rip that doll from her grasp when my ex came to pick her up. It was like taking food away from a dog, I had to get 3 stitches in my hand. Even with what ive done on my own wrist, ive never had to have stitches. My therapist shit herself when she saw them, the scratches looked like they came from claws.   


I haven’t seen my therapist since that day, recently since my daughters been at her mothers, one of my neighbours’ dogs has gone missing. So has the old lady who lived down the street. When I’m in bed I can’t sleep, all I hear is singing from my daughter’s room. I should have gotten rid of it while I still could… I can’t now. My ex dropped my daughter off yesterday saying she can’t take her anymore. She called her a demon, then she just left without saying. She looks awful, her skin is almost grey now, her eyes just black. They’ve lost the gorgeous blue that they used to be. It looks like she’s bit her nails into claws, looking like serrated daggers, her cuticles are all bloody.  


I haven’t heard back from my ex about when she’s going to take this fucking gremlin back, I can’t stand being in my own house anymore. My daughter, if I can even call her that anymore doesn’t let go of that doll, we eat with it. The fucking doll has its own plate,   
She won’t part with it. She’s almost like family now…
