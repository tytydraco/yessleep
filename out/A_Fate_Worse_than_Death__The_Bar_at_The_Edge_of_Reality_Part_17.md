Long story short: I [found my friends](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/11li8kd/a_tangled_web_the_bar_at_the_edge_of_reality_part/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) by literally colliding with them in the fog. I wish I could tell you I valiantly searched for them and managed to hunt them down with my sheer willpower and strength. But that would be a bigger lie than when I was fourteen and told my uncle I had no idea *how* the pool had ended up empty with nothing but a few koi fish chilling in the last two inches of water left behind. (Spoiler alert: Milo and I absolutely had an idea, because we’d caused it. Accidentally, of course. But that’s a story for another time).

What actually happened in the fog is that I was wandering distractedly, intently focused on trying to turn the prickle of déjà vu in the back of my brain into something helpful, hoping the Ancient One would make sure I didn’t, like, wander off a cliff—and I walked straight into Milo.

To be fair, he didn’t see me either. The fog was just too dense. It was only when we were both standing there, holding our foreheads where they’d collided and wincing in pain, that we realized we’d found each other at all.

Immediately, Milo dropped his hand and instead embraced me, squeezing me so hard I gasped for breath. “Oh, thank Neptune, you’re *alive!”* he practically shouted in my ear. I wheezed and tried to choke out something resembling *please let go I can’t breathe.*

He either didn’t get the message or didn’t care, because he hugged me even tighter as he turned his head to yell over his shoulder. “I FOUND HIM!”

Asher and Acacia appeared immediately, blossoming out of the fog nearly within arm’s reach. It was amazing how I hadn’t seen or heard them even when they were *that* close.

Meanwhile, I was still wheezing. Asher took one look at my undoubtedly purple face and casually ripped Milo away from me with one arm, like it was the easiest thing in the world. “Would be pretty anticlimactic if we found Ian only for you to choke him to death,” he said pointedly to Milo.

“He’s had worse,” argued Milo with a shrug.

I wheezed. “Yeah, from a sea monster *trying* to kill me.”

Milo grinned, eyes glinting mischievously behind his glasses as they met mine. “Which time?”

My coughs turned to laughs, and I finally straightened up as my breathing returned to normal. For a moment, everything felt the way it used to: just me and Milo, making dumb jokes at each other’s expense as we went on adventures together, knowing Henri would be waiting with snacks and words of wisdom when we returned.

*Henri.* His name crossing my mind brought reality crashing back down. They didn’t know. It had been only hours since I’d seen my friends—I was pretty sure, although who knew how time passed in the Ancient One’s cavern?—and yet so much had happened. So much had changed. I’d found out that the murderer and I were both fragments of the Ancient One itself. Henri had been killed. Hell, I’d *met* the murderer and chased her across dimensions.

How did I even *begin* to tell them what I’d experienced?

I didn’t sink to my knees on purpose. It just kind of happened, as the thoughts piled up and my anxiety spiraled and the pain at losing Henri welled up all over again. Before I knew it, I was sitting on the ground, crying ugly, loud tears.

My friends were there in an instant. Through the sobs, I sensed more than saw that Asher and Milo had settled on either side of me. Acacia knelt directly in front, facing me.

“Ian,” she said quietly, placing a calming hand on my knee. “What happened?”

I tried to tell them. I did. But I couldn’t find the words between all the crying, so I just ended up shaking my head.

Milo whispered, “I’m here, Ian. Whenever you’re ready.”

Their quiet support was sweet, but it was Asher who pulled me out of it. I felt him hesitate as he hovered beside me, and after a moment he must have decided to go for it, because suddenly he wrapped his arms around my chest, engulfing me in a tight but gentle embrace.

Considering that a thin layer of dark leather was all that was keeping his touch from instantaneously killing me, it was oddly comforting. I found myself relaxing against his shoulder, his dark hair tickling my face as he leaned his head against mine. “I know,” he whispered into my ear. “I felt it happen. I’m so sorry. We don’t have to talk about if you don’t want to.”

My mind seemed to clear, like clouds parting after a thunderstorm. Somehow it was freeing to think that he already knew about Henri’s death; it made it easier to cross that gaping dark chasm of pain to tell them about it.

So as my tears slowed, I did. I took a deep breath and started from the wolf pulling me away in the fog: the Ancient One, Henri, the murderer. I only left out a few details—like that she’d killed Asher and Acacia’s father. I couldn’t bring myself to voice it. Not right now. The pain of losing my surrogate father was too raw, and I couldn’t imagine dredging up a similar pain for them. It just seemed…cruel.

Milo, Asher, and Acacia were a good audience. They gasped in the right places, comforted me in others, fumed in quiet anger towards the end. But they mostly stayed quiet, which helped me to get through it all, especially the rough parts, when I choked over my words and had to swallow back fresh tears.

Asher’s arm around me helped too. He left one arm loosely draped over my shoulder the entire time, and it was reassuring. An anchor to reality.

When I was finished, there was a long silence. The dense silver fog continued to roll around us, and our breath vanished into the mist.

That is, until Milo broke it. “Henri was the best,” he said solemnly. “I swear we’re gonna have the grandest memorial service you’ve ever seen, one that honors him. I’m a hell of an event planner. You’ll see.”

I smiled. “Thanks, Milo.”

He wasn’t done. Continuing as if I hadn’t spoken, he said, “But first we have to stop this monster! By monster of course I mean your other half.” He looked at me and made a face. “Or…your sister?”

I shrugged. “*I* don’t know how it works.”

“Doesn’t matter, then,” he said dismissively. He was on his feet now, energy building in his voice. I hadn’t even noticed him stand up. “Whatever she is, we’re gonna find her and we’re gonna destroy her. For Henri!”

This outburst was met with silence. Milo, undeterred, continued to stand there with his arms raised above his head for emphasis. Slowly, I stood up. “Let’s do it.”

Milo cheered. I rolled my eyes.

Asher and Acacia got up too, and as they did, I turned my back to Milo. “Was it…quick?” I asked them in a low voice.

Asher nodded. “I felt it right before it happened. He wasn’t close to death…and then, in an instant, he was. That’s when she must have showed up. But his soul crossed over right after. She didn’t draw it out. Must have caught him by surprise.”

I’d figured as much—there was no chance she’d be able to beat Henri in a fair fight—but it was nice, at least, to know that it had been fast. That he hadn’t suffered.

“We really are sorry,” murmured Acacia. “We wish we could have helped.”

“I know,” I said.

Then we returned to Milo just in time, because he was staring into the fog and whistling loudly, doing his best to be as obnoxious as possible in his display of his giving his privacy. I swatted him on the arm. “Stop that. You sound like a dying phoenix.”

“Oh, you mean elegant and stately and ready to immediately be reborn from the ashes?” he countered. “Thank you, I consider that a compliment.”

“It wasn’t a compliment,” said Acacia, just as Asher grumbled, “You shouldn’t.”

I hid a grin. “Okay, well, Milo’s inability to whistle aside, I need to figure out where that Gothic building is. The longer I wait, the more likely it is that she tries to draw me out first by killing someone else. No one else is dying for me. We need to take the fight to her.”

“Right,” said Acacia. “Only problem is, couldn’t it be anywhere? You travel all over both dimensions.”

I thought it over. “Definitely human dimension,” I said with certainty. “Based on the colors alone.” It was true; the building had been made of some kind of dark stone, and the headstones were starkly white, but the leaves on the tree branches waving in the wind had definitely been green. So had the grass, what little of it there appeared to be. The lack of gray hills and violently purple buildings ruled out Neverland.

Asher made a face. “Guess Acacia and I can’t be of much help then.”

Acacia shrugged sheepishly. “As I’m sure Asher told you, this is the biggest change in scenery we’ve ever had.” She gestured around at the endless fog. “Which is impressive, considering there’s *no* scenery here.”

“I kind of like it,” said Asher.

Milo rolled his eyes so hard I was surprised they didn’t pop out of his head. “Not this again,” he groaned. “Ian, you’re a fragment of a powerful ancient being. Make him stop. The entire time you were fighting spiders and chasing murderers, we were wandering aimlessly in this maddening fog, and he *kept saying that he liked it.* I’m gonna strangle him.”

Asher smirked. “Go on and try.”

Milo opened his mouth, and I immediately slapped my hand over it. I wasn’t sure if he was planning to retort or start a magical, sleep-inducing song as revenge, but either one would *not* help our case. “Bigger problems,” I hissed.

He licked my hand.

Cursing at him, I pulled back just in time for him to double over in fits of laughter. As he straightened, pushing his skewed glasses up his nose, he gave me a little grin. “Sorry. Old trick. Ready to get to business.”

“Oh, I know,” I mumbled, remembering the dozen times he’d done the same ‘old trick’ when we were kids.

It hadn’t been long of me and Milo laying on the ground, bouncing ideas off each other, before I heard whispers in the mist, growing louder. I bolted upright. What if it was her? Or the antlered wolf she’d sent to grab me last time? “Do you hear that?”

My friends all looked at me like I was insane. “No,” said Milo incredulously.

Understanding dawned on Asher’s face. “It must be the Ancient One!” he said excitedly. “Maybe it’s trying to help!”

He was right. The Ancient One couldn’t leave its cavern, but it could reach me through the fog, at least a little—I mean, I’d heard its voice and seen its silver thread before I’d ever met it. I was sure it must be even weaker now, considering the effort it must have expended to bring me to its home, but it was trying.

I closed my eyes and listened.

Suddenly, the words were crystal clear, as unbroken as the surface of a quiet pond. And I heard them all as if the Ancient One stood right next to me.

*Ian,* it whispered, in the soft-but-deafening, fragile-but-rich, gentle-but-powerful voice I now recognized, *I apologize for the way our conversation ended. I do not currently have the strength to guide you here. I do not even have the strength to continue this connection for long.*

I wasn’t sure I could communicate back, but when I thought the words, I heard my own voice speak them as audibly as if I’d said them aloud, though my mouth never moved. *It’s okay. I understand.*

*Thank you,* it whispered, and I heard the waver in its voice as it grew more muffled. Like a bad phone connection. *But I want balance to be restored as much as you do. And so I will offer you her location.*

My heartbeat quickened. *Please.*

*Her anchor point is among humans. It is—*

The voice vanished, crackling into silence with a noise like static. Cursing, I opened my eyes and began to pace in frustration. I knew it was no use trying to call out. I had felt the connection to the Ancient One, that invisible silver thread binding us through the fog, fade with the vanishing of its voice. “It *tried* to tell me where she is, but it was too weak to maintain the connection,” I said frustratedly, running an impatient hand through my hair. “That was the *worst* timing.”

“We’ll think of it, don’t worry!” said Milo. “Even if it takes us *years.* We won’t quit!”

“We don’t *have* years!” I protested. “We need to—”

Suddenly there was a sigh from all around us, as if the very fog itself had let out the world’s longest breath. A faint mist-filled breeze swept past me, and as it swirled I felt it tug at something by my hip. I looked down just in time to see the balled-up napkin from Oasis be gently pulled out of my pocket, unfolding as it drifted to the ground. Then the breeze was gone as quickly as it had come, and the fog around us rolled heavily once more.

“I assume that was the Ancient One’s doing?” said Asher.

I knelt to pick up the napkin, turning it over in my hand to see the Griffin’s Edge emblem. “Yeah,” I said, oddly touched. “Its last effort to help, in the only way it could. But we got this napkin in Oasis, which *can’t* be it.”

“But the *first* napkin didn’t come from Oasis!” Milo practically shouted in excitement, his blue eyes sparkling like sunlight off the ocean. “That one came from the church where you found the dead priest!”

He was right. It clicked, and I felt like the biggest idiot in both dimensions for not putting it together sooner. Sure, I’d been mostly *inside* that church, occupied with the poor priest’s bloody corpse on the altar, but after I’d called 911, I’d walked outside and down the street before finding a gap to return to [Griffin's Edge](https://www.griffinsedgebar.com/).

And now that Milo had said it, the puzzle pieces had snapped into place. The Gothic building was that church, the same exterior I’d seen when I’d left it. I even remembered the gate and the graveyard beyond, once the memories came swirling back; I’d nearly bumped into someone leaving it as I hurried away from the crime scene.

That priest couldn’t have been a random murder, then. If the church was truly her ‘default,’ as she’d put it, did she know him? Was it coincidence that I’d jumped there?

My money was on yes and no, respectively.

“It’s definitely the church,” I said confidently. “I can picture it enough to get there. Problem is, there’s no *way* it’s as easy as strolling in to kill her. I mean, she knows I saw it. Even if she thinks I don’t know where it is, there’s a good chance she’s got *some* protections in place.”

Acacia’s eyes twinkled as she and Asher looked at each other with identical mischievous grins. “We may not be able to come with you to the human dimension, but we can make sure you have some tricks up your sleeve.”

“Stealth is kind of our thing,” added Asher with a smirk.

“Trust me, I know,” I said, thinking of how Asher had seemed to appear out of nowhere every single time he’d found me in the dark forests.

I won’t bore you with the details of our conversation, because there really wasn’t much to it. All three of them were inhuman and would be inherently unstable on the human side; I mean, I’d accidentally dragged both Milo and Asher there before and nearly seen them combust in front of me. So I’d have to go alone.

That was fine. Probably for the best. But what I *didn’t* want was 1) another wild goose chase until I inevitably lost her again or died somewhere along the way, especially if there were more giant spiders involved, or 2) her to get the drop on me and go back to Griffin’s Edge or somewhere else entirely to kill more innocent beings. I wanted this to end. I wanted to kill her. For Henri, and for the rest of the scared inhumans and humans crowding the bar right now, and for all the others who didn’t deserve to die.

So I also had to make sure she didn’t get away.

All in all, it was probably only twenty minutes or so before we’d made a very risky, possibly very stupid plan—but is there really any other kind when Milo and I are the ones behind it?

Luckily, the Ancient One must have been on our side, because we’d barely resumed walking when we found the fog beginning to thin, and only a few minutes later emerged from the mist, Griffin’s Edge looming down the path ahead of us.

My heart ached at the familiar sign above the door. I wanted so badly to go inside, find Uncle Henri in his office, and tell him all about our plan. Guaranteed he’d have a better idea. But he wouldn’t make me feel dumb about it. He’d listen, his lilac eyes never drifting from my face, and only when I was done would he sigh and say, “I have a few suggestions you may like to take into account.” And I would, and everything would work out because Henri was the wisest being alive.

Well. He *had* been. I swallowed the lump in my throat and turned away from the bar. I wouldn’t let myself go back until I’d gotten justice for him. He deserved that much.

My friends followed me to the left fork in the path, the branch that led to the human dimension. I could feel the shifting fabric of reality here, the constantly-changing gaps opening and closing all around us.

“This is where we leave you,” said Milo solemnly. “We hope you fare well on your mission, O Great and Valiant Errand Boy.”

I rolled my eyes. “Shut up. I’ll see you soon.”

Acacia gave me a hug as Asher winked at me over her shoulder. “Don’t die.”

“I’ll do my best,” I said.

Then I turned and walked into the fog, heart pounding, picturing the Gothic church and its graveyard in my head. The same way I’d traveled so many times before, but this felt different. More…final.

I stepped through reality just outside the gate of the graveyard. A few humans hurrying past on the sidewalk didn’t even notice­—a combination of being occupied by their phones and reality doing its sneaky thing of hiding nonsensical sights, blending them into the reweaving of its fabric so that no one even realizes anything weird happened at all.

I looked at the church, then at the gate to the attached cemetery. Neither were super fun options; both seemed pretty ominous. But an instinct deep in my gut told me that the actual focal point had to be the graveyard. I mean, my default was the dark forests, where harbingers made their home—as close an intersection to the living and dead planes as could be found in Neverland. And where would the line between living and dead blur the most in the human dimension?

A graveyard.

“Henri, I want you to know that I hate this, but I’m doing to do it anyway,” I muttered under my breath. “You better be proud of me.”

Then, with a deep breath, I pushed upon the gate, which made an awful squealing noise—maybe they intentionally don’t grease cemetery gates for the sole purpose of adding more creepy ambience?— and started down the stone path.

The headstones made me uneasy. Some were new, stark white marble bright against the grass, and some looked to be hundreds of years old, the stone crumbling apart and the words unreadable, destroyed by time. But that wasn’t the uneasy part. *That* came from the fact that I sensed auras around some of them: remnants of spirits, soul fragments that hadn’t quite moved on.

Look, I’ve met ghosts before. Despite popular culture ideas, there really aren’t a lot of them. Most beings, human and inhuman alike, move on quickly, or at least find their way eventually. Harbingers used to help with that process. But with the harbingers no longer doing business, occasionally a soul doesn’t make it. Those are the ones that become ghosts.

Unfortunately, ghosts often become violent. Beings on the wrong side of the human versus inhuman dimensions aren’t stable; they combust. Beings on the wrong side of the living versus dead planes have a similar issue. No, they don’t combust—that would solve the ghost problem—but they aren’t stable either. Over time, they lose memory of who they were, becoming volatile and aggressive.

And a few of those auras I was sensing? Let’s just say I didn’t want to provoke them.

Wielding Sgrios with one hand and keeping the other wrapped around the lighter in my pocket, I crept forward through the graveyard. I figured it was only a matter of time before she knew I was here—if she didn’t already.

Suddenly, there was a blur of gray to my right. I turned just in time for a growling mass of fur and teeth to lunge through the air and sink its teeth into my raised arm.

I cursed and rolled to the ground, bringing the wolf with me. What was with this girl and wolves?! This one didn’t have antlers—I was pretty sure it was just a normal, human-world wolf—but its teeth were every bit as painful as the antlered wolf’s in the mist. Its breath also stank like rotten meat, and I fought between the instincts to groan in pain and gag as I wrestled against its strong legs.

Struggling to get the lighter from my pocket as the wolf’s weight pinned my unbitten arm to the ground, I glanced around frantically for any sign of the murderer. Nothing. Just me and the growling, quite possibly rabid wolf.

*Shit.*

I still held Sgrios in my hand even as the wolf’s teeth dug deeper into that arm. Grimacing in pain, I moved my wrist to twist Sgrios around and, throwing myself onto my side with all the force I could muster, I jabbed the knife backwards into the wolf’s eye.

It howled and finally released my arm, stumbling away as blood dripped onto the stone. Panting, I staggered to my feet and wasted no time ripping out my lighter, opening it just long enough to reduce the wolf to ash and burning flesh, the grass around it as singed as my fingers.

I looked down at the bloody wounds soaking through the jagged tears in my sleeve and sighed. The pain was really sinking in now as the adrenaline faded, and I wasn’t a fan. It hurt too much to raise my arm. With a groan, I shifted Sgrios to my left hand.

No, I am not ambidextrous. Which meant this might get interesting.

Well, she clearly knew I was here, and I did *not* want to draw this out. “Come on, then!” I shouted into the empty graveyard. “Show yourself!”

She didn’t, but apparently a few of the local ghosts took this an invitation. The temperature immediately dropped about twenty degrees—my breath came in little clouds­—and I felt a shift in the air behind me. Cursing under my breath, I turned around.

Three of them. Two were recognizable as people, a man and woman respectively, but the third must have been here a long, long time, because it was a blurry, flickering jumble of shapes, more like a collage of human body parts and clouds than anything. Which meant it would be very, very violent.

Fire wouldn’t do anything against ghosts. But iron would, and one of my knife’s many base materials is, in fact, iron. So I raised Sgrios and gestured for them to come closer. “Don’t be shy, now.”

Screeching, the man and woman spirits swept towards me. A few messy swings with Sgrios—like I said, I am *not* left-handed—dissipated them in puffs of smoke. Easy enough. I had at least a few seconds before they could reform.

But then the old one came. I stabbed at it with Sgrios as it flew at me with an unholy scream, but all the blade did was dissolve small components of the ghost, not the entity itself. It swept through me, sending me to my knees, shivering like mad. It felt like I’d just been flung into an ice bath.

The old ghost circled back around to a cluster of gravestones just ahead of me. The man and woman reformed on either side, faces twisted in fury.

I had a few options here. I could get back up and keep fighting with Sgrios. Two of the three ghosts were simple enough to hold off; the third, I knew I simply had to aim better—a blade containing iron and salt right through the heart will dispel even the strongest of ghosts—and there was about a 50% chance I could do that with my left hand before it got bored of torturing me and tried to devour my soul.

I could also run into the church. Holy ground, and all that. The ghosts wouldn’t follow.

But then, still on my knees, I caught a glimpse of blond through one of the ghosts. There! Behind an oak tree a few rows of headstones away. The murderer was here, and she was watching.

Which meant it was time to enact the second, and stupidest, phase of our plan.

So I provoked the old, angry ghost. Still on my knees, I looked at it defiantly. “You can’t kill me,” I spit out. “You’re nothing but a stuck soul, doomed to this cemetery forever. You don’t have the power.”

Yeah, old ghosts are violent, aggressive—and not the smartest. That did the trick. It roared and flew at me, and I slashed half-heartedly at its jumbled mass, not even trying to hit where its heart would be.

Which meant it thrust an arm-like appendage into my chest and began to tighten its grip on my soul. I won’t lie; it was one of the more painful things I’ve experienced, which is really saying something, considering the life I lead. I can’t really describe it other than to say it was like a cold grip around my heart, squeezing tighter and tighter until it seemed my heart would explode.

Each gasping breath escaping my lungs brought with it a flash of silver in the air. I’ve seen enough souls to know that it wasn’t just due to the cold; the ghost was literally squeezing my soul out of my body. My vision began to turn black around the edges as the spirit eagerly devoured the small puffs of released soul. I had to be close enough to death for my friends to sense it. *Come on, any time now would be great!*

I could barely see—my heart felt so compressed I was sure it was about to implode—my entire body felt so, so cold, like I’d never known warmth and never would again—

And then, as my consciousness began to slip, I heard them. Shouts across the graveyard, the murderer’s voice, the splash of water. A moment later, the pressure on my heart vanished, and I fell to the ground, gasping, black spots dancing across my eyes.

I turned my head to the side to see Asher standing over me, facing the ghost like it was the easiest thing in the world. He held his hands up in front of him—ungloved—and a swirling, black, oil-like substance circled like whirlpools from his palms.

He was talking. As the ringing in my ears faded, I could hear his words. “—too far gone to pass over peacefully,” he said sadly. “There’s not enough of you left. I’m sorry I can’t do more for you. But I can end your suffering.”

I watched, mystified, as the black substance blossomed outwards, wrapping around the old ghost in thick coils, spreading until they covered its entire surface. The ghost screamed once—and then the darkness collapsed as if it were a black hole, and both the substance and the ghost were gone.

Asher glanced back at me as he pulled his gloves on. “You okay?”

“Yeah,” I said in wonder, slowly getting to my feet. Because surprisingly, I was. Sure, blood was still dripping from the teeth wounds on my arm. But soul wise? Fine. “What *was* that?”

Asher shrugged. “A way to destroy souls that can’t be saved.” He coughed, and a bead of blood appeared at his lips.

That’s when reality came crashing back down on me. As I looked at him more closely, I realized just how sweaty he was, how his cheeks were turning gray. We needed to get out of here. Hopefully the others were ready to go too. “You’ll have to tell me more about it sometime,” I said. “Preferably when you’re not in danger of combusting.”

He made a face at me and followed me towards the tree where I’d seen the murderer, trying to muffle his coughs. My heartbeat quickened as we rounded the last few gravestones to see Milo and Acacia sitting on the ground, the murderer between them, soaking wet and unconscious.

“She didn’t know what hit her!” said Milo triumphantly. His face, too, was very sweaty. “The risks were well worth it.”

Remember how I said this was a risky and stupid plan? Well, that was why. The murderer had expected me to come alone. And I had—but the idea was, once I knew she was there, to let myself get close to death. Asher and Acacia would sense that and know to come. They couldn’t last long in the human dimension, but they could last long enough to save me and catch her by surprise, assuming we left right after. And catching her by surprise was probably the only way to beat her.

Consider it poetic justice for the way she’d surprised Henri.

Did this mean that every single of us had to directly risk our lives for this plan? Absolutely. But hey, I’ve risked my life for less.

And so far, so good. Last step: get out of here. I knelt by Acacia and Milo. “Not clear yet,” I said. “Hop on.”

They each put a hand on my good arm. Milo placed his other on the murderer. Asher rested a hand on my shoulder. I looked up at him and grinned. “Trust me, this’ll be much better than shadow travel.”

He groaned, though whether in exasperation or pain I’m not totally sure. “You’re really gonna risk my life for jokes right now?”

“Just the one,” I said with a smirk, and then dug my nails into the bloody skin of my arm. The sudden shock of the pain did exactly what I wanted it to: with a gasp, we jumped.

Right into the dark forests, of course. I don’t think I’ve ever been happier to see the gnarled trunks and twisted roots of those woods.

Asher, Milo, and Acacia all looked better immediately. The stabilization of your atoms will do that to you. Milo wrapped me in a hug. “For a dumbass plan that relied a whole lot on luck, timing, and nearly dying, I’d say that went pretty well.”

I looked at the unconscious murderer lying at our feet. I wanted answers, and then I wanted to kill her. Only at that point would it be over.

“Yeah,” I said, with a glance around at my friends, their solemn silence broken only by growls in the undergrowth and the steady dripping of my blood onto the rotting leaves. They met my eyes, and I knew they were with me until the end. Hell, if our last plan hadn’t proved that, nothing would. ["Let's finish this."](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/12i1zu4/bad_faith_the_bar_at_the_edge_of_reality_part_18/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)
