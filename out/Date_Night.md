Sitting in his armchair, he excitedly read through his phone. “This movie got a 9.5/10 from local critics, I hope it’s as good as they say. This is our first night out in how long… 4, 5 months?” 

Chuckling, the wife replied “I was going to say it felt like 4 or 5 years.” 

The Couple had welcomed a new baby to the family at the beginning of the year, bringing their headcount to four children under the age of 6. The parents hadn’t been out on the town in some time. Their plan was to revisit some of their favorite spots from past dates. They’d start with their favorite bistro downtown for some surf and turf, head to the local drive-in to catch the new slasher film, and finish the night off with some gelato down at the river walk. They adored their children, but you could see on their faces how excited they were for tonight.  

The Mother sat at the dinner table, reviewing her notes that she was leaving for Brittany. Brittany had babysat the kids in year’s past, but The Mother still felt the need to lay everything out for her. Scanning the list one final time, she read them back to her husband. 

–Money for pizza 

-Soda and water stocked in the fridge 

-Passcode to the security system, and our spare key 

-Both our cell numbers 

-Neighbors’ numbers next store just in case 

-Diapers in the changing room upstairs 

-Formula and heating instructions

“Do you think I have everything?”

He could hear a slight paranoia in her voice. “Honey, Brittany’s been babysitting the kids for a while now. Don’t worry she’ll be fi-”

With the typical inflection and pep you’d expect from a young teenager, Brittany quickly replied- “Oh I know, but I got off of work early, and I know you mentioned how excited you both were, so I figured I’d give you a head start on your date!”  

Impressed and a little shocked, the Husband and Wife welcomed Brittany in, reviewed their list, brought her up to the playroom where the kids were hiding out, and said their goodbyes.  

At dinner, The Husband and Wife were having the time of their lives. The food was excellent, the cocktails were great, and the band was playing their favorite songs. This would be an evening to remember. 

As they were finishing the main course, The Mother felt a vibration in her purse- Brittany was calling. Sneaking in one last bite, she answered. Before she could say hello, Brittany spoke. 

“Hiiiii hey it’s Brittany, SO sorry I’m calling so late- I know we agreed on me coming over at 6, but I ended up getting stuck late at work and I won’t be able to come babysit tonight. I know you’re probably sitting at home wondering where I am. I’m so sorry if I ruined your date night, hopefully I can come watch the kids tomorrow if that works for you?” 

“…Hello?”
