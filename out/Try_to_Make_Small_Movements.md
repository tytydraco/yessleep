I’ve experienced sleep paralysis on and off for most of my adult life. It isn’t really a big deal to me anymore. I can feel it in my body when it starts and I’m typically able to talk myself through it.    
  
First, I realize that I’m neither really sleeping nor awake, and I can’t move. I try not to panic, and I gently remind myself that if I start thinking about scary things, they will manifest themselves. So, I think about positive things and remind myself that I will eventually wake up. Most of the time this works, and I’m proud of how far I’ve come with these strategies. Last night, however, I had some trouble.   
  
I went to bed listening to thunderstorm sounds on YouTube. It’s lovely, and it helps me with everything from studying to sleeping. So, it’s not unusual for me to choose a video that’s several hours long and let it carry me from afternoon to evening. 	   
  
It was some time after 2 AM, and I noticed in my half-asleep state that my YouTube thunderstorm sounds were being immensely overpowered by the booming, glorious sounds of a real thunderstorm outside my bedroom window. I am deeply comforted by rain, and I was more than excited to jump out of bed and open the window on the far side of the room and bask in the storm’s beauty before snuggling back into bed.    
  
My window is missing its screen, and I knew my carpet would probably get a little wet depending on the direction of the rain, but I didn’t mind. My room is on the second floor, and I don’t usually think twice about having it open all night. Back in bed, I let the euphonic symphony of the storm lull me back to sleep.    
  
Sometime later, I was distressed to find that I was being deceived yet again into a sleep paralysis episode. As my consciousness transitioned from deep sleep to somewhere more ambiguous, I accepted my fate.    
  
   
  
*You are safe. You will wake up when you’re ready.*   
  
   
  
My anxiety was growing rapidly, and I was desperate to avoid the whole thing altogether.    
  
   
  
*Deep breaths, try to make small movements.*   
  
   
  
My thoughts kept traveling to the thought of my open window. I was staring right at it. 

  
  
*Look for inconsistencies. Are the curtains even that color?*  

  
  
I knew they were. I knew there were no inconsistencies. I knew that I was past the point of self-soothing, and that my fears had already begun to form my reality in the realm I was stuck in. I tried to imagine the first flush of dawn creeping in through my window. I desperately tried to hear the small sounds of morning birds chirping and waking up the flowers in the garden.    
  
   
  
*Why isn’t it working?*   
  
   
  
All I could feel was immense pressure on my chest and the sickening awareness of my immobility as I stared brokenly at my open window. An incredibly loud, wet, SLAP rang through the room as a decrepit hand gripped my windowsill from outside.    
  
   
  
*You’re on the second floor. It isn’t possible. You’re dreaming. Wake up. WAKE UP.*   
  
   
  
I watched against my will as a horrifyingly disfigured man pulled himself effortlessly through my window, peeking up at me with a joyous and excited smile. He had a massive hole where the left side of his jaw should be, and a discolored pool of drool spilled out and down his body.  His eyes were somehow lifeless, but wide with adrenaline and thrill.    
  
I stopped breathing for what seemed like minutes. I watched his movements, anticipating him lunging at me.    
  
Instead, he dropped to the floor in a thump and began crawling and sliding his body on the floor, inching closer and closer to the side of my bed. I couldn’t move my body. I couldn’t turn my head. All I could do was listen to the sound of his wet body dragging on the floor and his incessant, childish giggling. He was overjoyed by my fear and helplessness. I screamed with no sound and begged with no voice.   
  
   
  
I woke up to the sun beaming through my window and the sound of birds chirping dutifully. A little too late, but better than never. I was covered in sweat and terrified, but I could move my fingers.    
  
I sat up in bed and thanked the heavens that I had made it through to the other side. I promised myself I’d go back to the psychiatrist and try to find out what other options I might have. I was so relieved, but not quite ready to start my day. I felt fragile and raw.   
  
I looked over to the window and smiled at how it was all sort of ridiculous. However, I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t a little paranoid about the amount of dirt on the windowsill. But when was the last time I cleaned it? And I left the window open overnight after all.    
  
I opened my phone and began scrolling through Reddit to ease myself into the day. I began reading a lengthy post and grew irritated when I saw my brother calling, blocking my screen.    
  
“What’s up?”   
  
“Katie, did you see about what’s going on in your area?”   
  
“It’s not the best area, Brian. There’s always something going on..”   
  
“There was a security breach at the forensic psychiatric hospital. There on Wentworth?”   
  
“Damn, no kidding.”   
  
“A bunch of people got out. No way you didn’t get any alerts on your phone. Or you slept through it knowing you.”   
  
“I’ll check it out. Listen, I gotta go. I have work soon.”   
  
   
  
I was still a little shaken, and I wanted to get off the phone. My brother always had some news or conspiracy to share, and I wasn’t feeling it.    
  
I dropped my phone to my side and was about to slide out of bed and shower when I heard a small, muffled noise from under the bed.    
  
“Cassy?” I called for my old but loving cat.   
  
I waited to hear her scooting from under the bed to come lay with me.    
  
   
  
All that could be heard was a small, stifled, childish laugh.
