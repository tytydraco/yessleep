I never felt much attachment to ancestry. 

I knew who I descended from in the abstract, the way some families keep old portraits or repeat the same stories at gatherings. Thomas Jefferson was one of those stories. 

I never introduced myself with it, never used it as leverage, never felt like it belonged to me in any meaningful way. It was simply a fact, one that didn’t matter until the paperwork was finished and the land was legally transferred.

The delay wasn’t unusual. Estates tied to old property often take years to untangle, especially when records are incomplete or quietly neglected. 

What was unusual was how little resistance there was once the claim went through. No foundation stepped forward. No historical society objected. No government office asked follow-up questions beyond the bare minimum. It was as if the land had been waiting for someone to remember it, and once I did, no one wanted to acknowledge that it existed at all.

The property was located in a rural part of a state where Jefferson once owned land. The drive there took longer than I expected, not because of distance but because the signal faded early and roads narrowed until they became more suggestion than infrastructure. 

By the time I parked, there was nothing around me but trees, brush, and the sound of insects. No nearby buildings. No signage. No indication that anyone had been there recently.

The cabin itself was barely standing. Vines wrapped around the walls so tightly that they seemed structural, as though removing them would cause the whole thing to collapse. Moss covered the roof in thick, uneven patches, and several boards had warped or split entirely. It didn’t look preserved or protected. It looked abandoned in the truest sense of the word—left behind and allowed to rot without ceremony.

Inside, the air was heavy with mold and mildew. The floor creaked under my weight, and I moved carefully, testing each step before committing to it. There was no electricity, no furniture worth noting, and no signs that anyone had stayed there in living memory. No trash. No candles. No footprints. If this place had been forgotten, it would have been done thoroughly.

I wasn’t searching for hidden compartments or secrets. I was documenting the structure, taking photos for insurance purposes, when one of the floorboards near the back wall gave way beneath my foot. 

It didn’t snap cleanly. It sagged inward, soft and compromised, revealing a shallow pocket of dirt beneath the cabin.

Something had disturbed it recently. The soil was loose, uneven, with small claw marks along the edges. An animal burrow, most likely. As I knelt to inspect the damage, I noticed a corner of metal protruding from the dirt at an unnatural angle.

I dug with my hands.

The object I uncovered was a small lockbox, rectangular, rusted nearly brown, and heavier than it looked. It wasn’t buried deep, just hidden enough that it would have gone unnoticed if the floorboards hadn’t decayed and something hadn’t decided to dig there. I remember thinking that if I hadn’t stepped exactly where I did, I might never have found it at all.

The box resisted when I tried to open it. The hinge creaked loudly, protesting movement after what felt like decades of stillness. Inside was a single item, wrapped in oilcloth that had long since lost its effectiveness.

A journal.

The cover was cracked and warped from moisture. Pages stuck together in places, and mold had eaten away entire sections, leaving holes where words should have been. Even so, most of it was intact. The handwriting was immediately recognizable. I didn’t need to consult an expert to know whose it was. I’d seen enough reproductions to recognize the slant, the pressure, the consistency.

At first, the entries were mundane. Land management. Political frustrations. Observations on governance and human nature. It read exactly like what you’d expect from a man who believed documentation was a duty, even in private.

Then the tone shifted.

Not abruptly, but deliberately, as if the writer had decided that what followed needed to be recorded just as carefully as crop yields and correspondence.

August the Second, Seventeen Hundred and Seventy-Six.

“This day we set our names to parchment, and by doing so, set in motion a future that must be guarded against all known threats, and some unknowable ones besides. Independence is a fragile thing. It cannot endure without sacrifice.”

A few pages later, there was a drawing.

Three shallow grooves carved into uneven stone, arranged in a precise triangle. Lines channeled inward toward a metal grate at the center. Beneath the grate, Jefferson had shaded the page heavily, darkening it until the paper nearly tore.

There was a caption beneath the drawing, written carefully.

“The formation must not be altered. Distance is essential.”

I assumed symbolism at first. Allegory. A philosophical exercise. Jefferson was prone to those. But as I read on, it became clear that this was not a metaphor.

The journal spoke of a chamber beneath what would become Independence Hall. Jefferson did not explain how it was discovered. Several pages that should have addressed that were missing entirely, torn from the binding so thoroughly that only ragged edges remained. Whatever those pages contained, someone had gone to great lengths to ensure they were never read.

Jefferson referred to what lay below as the Leviathan.

“It is ancient beyond measurement, yet keen in its understanding. It recognizes the terms of our agreement and expects adherence without exception.”

Descriptions of the entity were sparse, but what little he wrote was unsettling in its restraint. He described its breathing as a bellowing sound, something between laughter and the movement of deep water through stone. He noted that the first exposure rendered even resolute men helpless, minds overwhelmed by its presence, bodies collapsing into paralysis that lasted hours.

Only one man, according to Jefferson, had seen it fully.

Washington.

No elaboration. Just the name, written once and never referenced again.

The ritual itself was described with clinical precision. Three lambs, positioned equidistant from one another at the points of the carved triangle. Their throats cut at any time, so long as blood flowed uninterrupted through the channels toward the center. The person placed above the grate was not drugged or unconscious.

“They fall regardless. The Leviathan’s proximity disrupts the mind upon first contact.”

Jefferson wrote that the blood carried something with it—an offering, though he never named what exactly. As it reached the person at the center, the flesh would begin to change, slowly losing cohesion, dissolving into a viscous mass that slipped through the grate below. He noted, almost clinically, that the screaming was not from pain, but from terror.

“They are aware of what is happening. That awareness is the true offering.”

He justified it all with the same certainty he applied to political theory.

“I will bear this sin gladly, if it means this land will never kneel to foreign boots.”

There was one entry where he acknowledged doubt—not about the ritual, but about the future.

“There may come a time when the Leviathan requires more food. I fear for the safety of our home then.”

What finally convinced me this wasn’t a delusion was the dates.

Jefferson recorded every ritual meticulously. Every two weeks. No deviations. No missed entries.

Out of a need I still don’t fully understand, I cross-referenced those dates with publicly available missing persons records. At first, I assumed coincidence. People go missing all the time. Patterns emerge where none exist.

So I checked again. Narrowed the criteria. Removed false positives. Looked only at the day following each recorded ritual.

There was always someone.

Sometimes the reports were vague. Sometimes they were delayed. But the pattern held.

Jefferson mentioned, almost in passing, that two enslaved people he had “released” were, in truth, never freed. They were offered.

He wrote of it with visible discomfort, but no hesitation.

“Freedom, if it is to mean anything, must be preserved. Even at great cost.”

I took the journal home.

For the first few days, nothing happened. That almost bothered me more than if something had. I expected a reaction—some sign that removing the journal from the cabin had mattered. Instead, life continued with irritating normalcy. I went to work. I slept poorly. I read the journal in fragments, never for too long at once, as if spacing it out might make what I was learning easier to absorb.

It was on the fourth morning that I noticed the vehicle.

I was leaving my apartment earlier than usual, still half-asleep, when I saw it parked across the street near the restaurant on the corner. A black SUV, large but unremarkable at first glance. Fully tinted windows. Clean. Too clean, considering how dusty everything else on the street usually was.

I didn’t think much of it then. People park there all the time. I walked past it without slowing down and went about my day.

The next morning, it was there again.

Same spot. Same angle. I noticed it only because I caught myself checking for it without realizing why. The windows were dark enough that I couldn’t see inside, even in direct sunlight. There was no license plate on the front or back. No bumper stickers. No decals. Nothing that identified it as belonging to anyone in particular.

By the third day, it had become part of the scenery.

I started to notice patterns. It was always there when I left in the morning. Always gone by early afternoon. I never saw it arrive, and I never saw it leave. No one ever entered or exited the vehicle while I was watching. I told myself that meant nothing. I reminded myself how easy it is to assign meaning once your brain decides to look for it.

Still, I began changing my routines slightly. Leaving at different times. Taking different routes. Watching reflections in windows as I passed. The SUV never followed. It never moved. It just waited.

At night, I found myself checking the street before closing the blinds. The vehicle was never there after dark.

I didn’t tell anyone about it. Saying it out loud would have made it sound ridiculous. A parked car is not a threat. A pattern does not imply intent. I knew all the rational explanations, and I repeated them to myself often.

Then I checked the journal again.

Not for new information, but for reassurance. For proof that I wasn’t imagining connections that weren’t there. That was when I noticed how often Jefferson wrote about being observed, even when he believed himself alone. How frequently he mentioned the necessity of discretion, of isolation, of ensuring that knowledge did not travel faster than it needed to.

The next morning, the SUV was still there.

By then, I had started timing it without admitting that’s what I was doing. Early arrival. Consistent departure. No variation. It was as predictable as the ritual dates in the journal, and that realization made my stomach tighten in a way I couldn’t explain.

On the day it left early, I noticed immediately.

I looked out the window out of habit, expecting to see it where it always was. The space was empty. At first, I felt relief—an almost embarrassing sense of validation, like I’d proven to myself that nothing was wrong after all.

That relief didn’t last.

The absence felt louder than its presence ever had. I checked the time. Too early. I stood there longer than necessary, staring at the empty curb, waiting for it to reappear. It didn’t.

That was when I became aware of how quiet the apartment felt. Not peaceful—anticipatory. As if something that had been holding position had finally been released.

I stepped away from the window and tried to focus on anything else.

That was when I noticed the smell.

It wasn’t strong at first. Just something sharp and wrong in the air, like cleaning chemicals or burning plastic. It didn’t belong in the hallway. I checked my door, then the vents. Everything looked normal, but the smell lingered, growing heavier the longer I stood there.

Instinct told me to leave.

I moved quietly, grabbed my keys, and slipped out through the stairwell instead of the elevator. The smell followed me down, faint but persistent. When I reached the ground level, I hesitated, listening for footsteps, for voices—anything that would confirm I was being paranoid.

The door opened to the outside.

Someone was waiting.

I didn’t see their face. I didn’t hear them approach. All I felt was the impact.

Something solid struck my knee from the side, hard enough that my leg folded the wrong way. There was a sound—a wet, hollow crunch—and then I was on the ground, screaming before I realized I was screaming. Pain flooded everything. I remember seeing blood on the concrete, too much of it, spreading quickly.

The person moved fast after that. Hands under my arms. A grip that knew exactly where to hold me. I remember thinking, distantly, that they weren’t rushing. This wasn’t panic. This was a procedure.

They started dragging me away.

I don’t know how far we got before sirens cut through the haze. Red and blue lights reflected off nearby buildings, sudden and disorienting. The grip on me tightened briefly, then released. I heard footsteps running. Someone shouting.

I remember someone else kneeling beside me. A voice asking my name. Asking what happened. I tried to answer, but everything went dark before I could finish the sentence.

I woke up in a hospital.

My leg was immobilized, wrapped, and elevated, pain dulled by medication. A uniformed officer sat nearby, flipping through a notebook. They told me I’d been lucky—that a patrol had been close enough to intervene, that whoever attacked me ran when they realized they’d been seen.

They asked if I recognized my attacker. I didn’t.

They asked if I had any enemies. I didn’t.

They asked if anything had been taken. I told them no.

That’s when I decided to write this.

Not because I think it will change anything. Not because I believe the people responsible will be exposed. The officer didn’t know anything beyond a routine assault. The doctors didn’t ask questions beyond what was necessary to treat me. To them, this was an isolated incident.

I know better.

Tomorrow is still the next ritual.

Jefferson believed that endurance justified secrecy, that freedom required sacrifices no one would ever acknowledge. Maybe he was right. Maybe this country has only survived because the cost has always been paid quietly, by people who were never supposed to be noticed.

I don’t know what will happen to me after this. I don’t know if I’ll be allowed to recover in peace, or if this was meant as a warning rather than a solution.

All I know is this: if you live in America, don’t assume safety is guaranteed. Don’t trust that being ordinary makes you untouchable.

Be careful. Stay aware. And don’t let your guard down.

I guess I’m hitting the road when I get out of the hospital.

If anyone has any ideas of what I could or should do, tell me. I’d love to go over what I’ve found with anyone who doesn’t think I’m crazy.
