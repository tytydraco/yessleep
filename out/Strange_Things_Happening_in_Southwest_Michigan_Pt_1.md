Hello all,

For some time now, I’ve been thinking of sharing some of the strange things I’ve experienced at a local state park, Grand Mere, which I’ve frequented for most of my life. Before I begin, I want to preface this by saying that I am not a huge believer in the paranormal, though I do have a personal faith. The things I will describe are probably nothing more than perfectly normal events that felt frightening in the moment but, in reality, have reasonable explanations. That said, I don’t have those explanations, and these things have stuck with me as outliers in an otherwise normal life.

I started going to the park when I was about six years old. My mother would take me, my brother, and my sister out for hikes to get some fresh air and expend energy so we could focus better on our schoolwork (we were homeschooled—and no, I’m not weird. You’re weird). Those early visits shaped a love for the outdoors that has lasted my entire life. There’s something about the way the sunlight filters through the trees and the air seems to hum with a quiet, ancient energy that has always drawn me back.

The park itself is mostly wooded. There are three small inland lakes surrounded by swamp and scrubby growth. Farther back from the waterline, you can find some very large old-growth trees that were spared from harvesting due to the difficult terrain. As you head west through the woods toward Lake Michigan, the ground begins to rise, forming high ridges and steep hills that eventually lead to vast, windswept sand dunes. Eventually, the tree cover breaks, revealing rolling dunes that stretch toward the shore, their peaks offering breathtaking views of the lake’s endless expanse.

As a child, this place was paradise. We would spend hours listening to the birds and racing each other to the top of the next hill. My brother and I would scour the ground, hoping to find spent shotgun shells or bullet casings left behind by hunters (though we had no idea at the time that actual artifacts had been unearthed in these woods). Finding deer tracks or spotting other woodland creatures filled me with elation, and the superhuman speed granted by bounding down the tallest dunes made my spirit soar. I remember feeling like an explorer, discovering something new every time we visited. Whether it was a mossy hollow that looked like a fairy grove or a gnarled tree that seemed older than time, the park felt alive with secrets waiting to be uncovered.

But you had to be careful. It was easier to get turned around than you might think. The woods had a way of closing in on you, and the familiar trails could vanish into the undergrowth if you wandered too far. Even seasoned hikers have been known to lose their way in those woods, and as a kid, I learned firsthand how disorienting they could be.

I remember one particular day when we stayed out longer than intended. My mom, my siblings, and I had been exploring a new trail, captivated by the sights and sounds around us. The scent of pine needles and earth hung heavy in the air, and we’d been distracted by a cluster of wildflowers growing in a spot where sunlight pierced the canopy. As the light began to fade, we realized we had lost our bearings. The path we thought would lead us back to the parking lot twisted in directions we didn’t recognize.

At first, it was just a mild concern, my mom’s tone calm but firm as she urged us to keep moving. But as the woods darkened, her voice grew sharper. The rustling of leaves seemed louder than before, the shadows deeper and more ominous. We passed the same fallen tree twice, and my mom’s hand tightened on mine as she whispered to herself, trying to stay composed. My siblings and I began to feel the tension, our earlier excitement replaced by a gnawing unease.

As we pressed on, a strange hush fell over the forest. The usual chirping of birds and rustling of squirrels seemed to vanish. Instead, there was an unsettling silence, broken only by our labored breathing and the crunch of leaves beneath our feet. I could swear I heard faint whispers, just beyond the edge of my hearing. My brother insisted he saw something—a shadow, a figure—moving between the trees. My mom dismissed it, but her quickened pace betrayed her unease. I found myself glancing over my shoulder, the sensation of being watched growing stronger with every step.

The air grew colder as the last slivers of sunlight disappeared, and the trees seemed to close in around us. I remember tripping on a root and scraping my knee, and as I knelt on the forest floor, I caught a glimpse of something odd. A small, perfectly round clearing—no leaves, no debris, just bare earth—sat nestled between the trees, as though someone had swept it clean. In the middle was a single, jagged rock, almost like a marker. My mom pulled me up before I could look closer, urging us to keep moving.

As the minutes dragged on, the forest seemed to grow even denser, the tree trunks forming a labyrinth around us. Shadows danced in the corners of my vision, fleeting and insubstantial, but enough to send shivers down my spine. My sister began to cry, her small voice breaking the silence as she clung to my mom’s leg. It felt like we were walking in circles, the undergrowth pulling at our ankles as if trying to hold us back.

Finally, just as panic was beginning to set in, we stumbled out of the dense woods into a small dirt parking lot. A group of people had gathered there to watch the sunset, their laughter and chatter breaking the eerie spell of the forest.  My mom asked for directions back to our car, her face pale and glistening with sweat. I remember looking back at the tree line as we walked away, feeling as though something was watching us from the shadows. Even now, I can’t forget the sense of relief that washed over me as we left the woods behind.

Over the years, I have walked every path in the forest countless times, searching for that strange clearing I had seen, but I’ve never been able to find it again.

Thanks for reading. I plan to update with Pt. 2 as soon as I can. Next time, I’ll share some of the park’s history, including its connection to the Potawatomi people who once lived in this region. Their stories and presence seem woven into the fabric of the park itself.

Stay tuned.
