As a kid, I have had 3 consistent fears. The Dark, Tight Spaces, and haunted dolls. The first long term home I grew up in was a house in a simple neighborhood. My mother told me when I was around 13 that she use to practice witch-craft before she turned to Christianity. She never told me when she stopped, but thinking back she must've stopped when I was around 10, because that is when we stopped celebrating Halloween due to the religion.

This happened to me around 11 years ago. My memory is a little hazy when it comes to my age, because my memories of that house seem to have blended together. However, I do have a lot of clear memories of weird things that have happened to me up until about 4 years ago. One of my first memories of something weird happening, was before my mother turned to Christianity, so I believe I was about 8 or 9. For as long as I can remember, my mother has always believed in the supernatural. She would always warn me about spiritual doors that open whenever I watch anything horror related. I never listened, and to be honest I don't think I have listened to that warning to this day.

My mother use to go to the bar after work, so she would buy some things to keep me and my brother entertained while she's gone. My sister kinda just locked herself in her room with her laptop and phone, so I never really saw her much. One day my mother bought me and my brother a tent so we can camp in the middle of the living room for the night. My older brother has medium functioning autism, so he wasn't much help with setting up the tent, but thankfully this tent must've been made for children, because I was able to put it together in about 10 minutes. The main thing I remember about the tent was that it barely fit me and my brother so we could both sleep in it and it has a zipper door. When day turned to night I put 2 blankets and pillows into the tent and told my brother that it's time to go camping in the living room. We turned off the lights and crawled into the tent before I zipped the tent door closed. I pulled my blanket over me and rested my head on the pillow as I remember feeling the carpet brush against my skin. I slowly drifted asleep.

I woke up in the middle of the night feeling the need to pee. I remember being thankful that I didn't pee in my sleep, because I use to wet my bed a lot until I was about 10 or 11. However, I now have to make sure to get out of the tent without waking my brother up. I slowly pulled my blanket off and looked at my brother to make sure he was asleep. Thankfully he was, so I crawled over to the zipper door and slowly zipped it as quietly as I can before waiting a minute to make sure my brother didn't wake up. I remember looking at him to see that he's still asleep before turning to the open door to crawl out and just before I reached my hand to the other side, I saw a humanoid creature run across the opening of my tent. It looked as pale as paper and very skinny like a starving man with no clothing, running like a dog sprinting for something in the distance.

I remember sitting there, shocked still as I stared out the opening before quickly zipping the door close and crawling to my brother to wake him up "Jack, Jack, let's go to the bathroom". "No, Alex" he mumbled in his pillow. Of course I should've known that he wasn't gonna be any help, but I was scared and just wanted someone to be with me. I tried insisting on him coming with me but my brother didn't want to go with me. I remember turning around and staring at the zipper door for about 10 minutes until my need to pee became unbearable, so I decided that I had to go on my own. I sat in front of the door and thought of a plan to open the zipper door and quickly run in a straight line to the bathroom door where there is a lock and I will be safe in there. I took a quick breather before opening the zipper door as quietly as I can and listened for any movements. After not hearing anything, I got ready and ran as fast as I can out from the tent and into the bathroom before closing it, locking the door, and turning on the light. Thankfully nothing was in the bathroom, so I was able to use the bathroom peacefully.

After I used the bathroom I remember waiting at the door for about another 10 minutes as I built up the courage to run out the bathroom and straight into my room. That was the first time I've seen my fourth new fear. I don't know how to explain it, but I still shiver whenever I see anything that reminds me of that thing. Thankfully, my brother was okay the next morning despite me leaving him there with my new fear.

I told my mother about what happened that night, but of course she didn't believe me. I was a 9-year-old with an expansive imagination after all.

I never want to see that thing again.
