Growing up in Kansas, we were raised on history. Both the proud and the macabre. The Dust Bowl. The Great Flood of ’51. The F5 Torndado of '66. Brown v. Board. Bleeding Kansas. Where I’m from though, there’s another kind of history as well. The kind that’s whispered in bars and behind locked doors after dark. The kind passed down like warnings between generations. Urban legends to scare the kids.

Tales like the Albino Woman who roams Rochester Cemetery or the lost town of Ashley, Kansas that was swallowed in a single night. There’s one legend though that always stood above the rest

Stull, Kansas. One of the seven gates to Hell.

A forgotten patch of earth between nowhere and nothing.

I never believed in Hell.
Not really.
Well, not until that night. 

What you're about to read is my attempt to explain what happened. I know it's gonna sound Insane, dramatic, like something ripped from a story but I lived it, I survived it.. It’s eaten at me every day since.

We weren’t ghost hunters. Not even close.
We were just four high school kids from Topeka with secondhand cameras and dreams of going viral.

Me, Vince, Lara, and Gabe.

The plan was simple: record a fake ghost hunt, add some spooky sound effects and fake our way to internet fame. Stull Cemetery was the obvious choice. Every kid in Kansas knows the story about the staircase behind the old church.
A stairway that only appears on certain nights, when the moon turns red and the wind goes still.

They say if you find it, it leads to Hell. They say the Devil walks those steps twice a year.

We would laugh because we knew it was bullshit or at least we thought it was.

We got to Stull just past 12:37 AM.

The highway was empty, the kind of empty that makes you feel watched. The kind of quiet that presses down on your skull. No wind. No insects. Even the trees looked like they were holding their breath.

The cemetery gate was chained shut, rusted shut, like it wanted to stay closed.
Gabe grinned as he pulled out bolt cutters and snipped through. “Already scarier than half the ghost shows out there.”

Smart ass.

Lara was first through the gate, GoPro on her chest, flashlight in one hand, fearless as always. Vince followed, camera rolling. Gabe carried the rest of the gear. I brought up the rear, feeling that growing unease crawl up my spine.

Inside the walls, the cemetery felt wrong.
Not haunted, more like hollow. Like the place had been emptied of anything human.

Even the stars were gone. Just a dull, reddish haze hanging in the sky like dried blood on glass.

The old church ruins stood crooked in the moonlight, nothing more than rotting stone and collapsed wood. We started with the basics: EVP session, whispering dumb ghost questions.

“Is anyone here with us?”
“Did you die here?”
“Are you angry?”

Nothing. Static.

Then Lara asked, “Are you trapped here?”

And the recorder screamed back:
“BELOW.”

Not a whisper.
Not a glitch.
A voice. Deep, guttural, not human. The kind of voice that rattles inside your bones like a tuning fork. The kind of guttural that would make Alex the Terrible and Phil Bozeman jealous.

We played it back three times.
Same voice. Same word. Same sick guttural sound.

Below.

Gabe’s flashlight caught something behind the church. Something square, half-buried. We brushed the dead grass aside and there it was:

A concrete trapdoor.
No handle. Just an iron ring in the center.

We pulled it open and the smell hit us like a truck.
Rot, sulfur and something old. Something ancient and wrong.

Beneath that door was a staircase that descended into the black darkness.

Vince muttered, “This is it. This is the shot.”

I laughed, nervously. “Guess we found the stairway to Hell.”

If only I knew how right I was.

One by one, we stepped down into the dark.

The air grew colder with every step, like walking into the lungs of something dead. Thirty feet down, the walls were slick and wet. No graffiti. No bugs. No signs of life at all. Just cold stone and something else, like a heavy pressure, a weight behind your eyes, like something watching from inside your own skull.

After what felt like five minutes of descent, Gabe whispered, “Shouldn’t we be under the cemetery by now?”

He was right.
The stairs didn’t curve.
They didn’t end.

They just went down.

Vince turned the camera toward me to film, and I started to say something but then it came without a warning.

Not a whisper or even a voice, just a sound from below.

Mechanical and organic all at once. Like wet gears grinding through a scream. Like something metal being tortured. 

We froze.

The sound came again.

Louder. 

Closer.

Vince wanted to go back. Gabe argued. “We didn’t come this far just to come this far.”

I backed him up enthusiastically, “Yeah, we can make history here. No one's ever filmed this. This is real. We’re gonna break the internet, we're gonna be famous just like we all have wanted so badly!" 

Lara, brave as usual just pushed through us all and said "let's go."

It was settled, we followed her, we kept going.

The walls changed. Symbols began to appear on the walls as we descended, they appeared to be carved, burned, etched in languages that looked ancient. Hieroglyphs that made no sense to any of us.

The air thickened with a oily, acidic like feeling. 
Breathing became painful, you could literally taste the sulfur in the air.

Then… the staircase ended.

We stepped into a chamber the size of a cathedral.

The floor was covered in this wet, sticky, sludge. We couldn't make out what it was in the dark and our flashlights couldn't reveal what it was fully. 
The walls were covered with drawings. Stick figures of humans worshipping winged giants. Circles of fire consuming men, women and children. The one that caught our attention the most though was of demons, on their knees, worshipping something else. Someone else.

A much larger figure. Winged as well but also crowned and horned.

We concluded it had to be Lucifer, Satan, the devil himself. 

We stood in silence, stunned.

Vince breathed, “That’s him… That’s the Devil.”
Lara muttered, “People really worshipped him here.”
Gabe said what we were all thinking: “But, it’s not just people, these show demons worshipping the devil as well. What if, these were sights the artist really saw in person?"

Before anyone could process it enough to answer, we laid eyes on the throne.
Massive. Carved from bone. It was at the far end of the chamber, elevated above a stone path.

We stepped toward it.

That’s when we saw them.

Shapes in the dark. Dozens. Maybe even hundreds.
Tall, crooked silhouettes, hunched and twitching. 
Lined up in rows, crouched, kneeling, facing the throne.

At first we thought they were statues.

Then one of them moved.

It turned its head, showing a mouth full of jagged teeth, glistening like needles.

Its limbs cracked as it shifted. Its elbows bending backwards and then it shrieked.

The same sound from the staircase.

That wet metal grinding tortuous scream! 

Then, as if on cue,
they all began to awaken and turn.

Lara screamed. Which if you knew Lara, you knew how fucked this situation truly had to be.

Vince dropped the camera.

Gabe ran.

I followed.

We fled back to the stairway, but it was fucking changing.

The steps twisted beneath our feet, they got narrower, slicker, pulsing like veins. The walls moved, breathing in and out like flesh.

Where the fuck were we and why the fuck did we ever step foot into this godforsaken place?

Next thing I know, Gabe tripped. 

I turned to try and save him but instead I seen something drag him into the dark. 
He didn’t even scream. His face was already gone.

We ran faster. It was all we could do in that moment.  We were all so fucking terrified.

Then out of nowhere something dropped from the ceiling. It was fast, sharp, and silent. Lara disappeared in a flash of red. I remember seeing the terror in her eyes as she looked down at me as she ascended towards the darkness above us.

I still can't believe I had to watch my friends die right in front of my face. 

These fucking monsters took my friends and there was nothing I could even do about it. 

It was just me and Vince left. 

We were scrambling to catch our footing on the slick goopy sludge like flooring, rambling upwards, breathless, sobbing, praying. Scared out of our fucking minds.

We reached the trapdoor and shoved it open.

The sky above was black, not a star or cloud in sight and there was streaks of red throughout created from the bright red Moon.

The cemetery was dead. Tombstones shattered. 
Grass gray. 
Everything smelled of ash and sulfur.

We were out.

Vince collapsed beside me, so I turned to check on him.

He wasn’t looking at me though, he was staring right through me.

Eyes wide. Mouth trembling.

Then I saw one of them walking towards us, I ran, I ran as fast as I could and then I heard this scream, this sickening blood curdling scream, that sound still echoes in my nightmares. 
I ran so fast it felt like I was falling.

I made it out of that cemetery and ran as fast as I could away from there. 

I woke up in my bed that next morning.

Alone.

Gabe, Vince and Lara were gone and not just gone in the way you would think.

They were gone from everyone else's memory.

Like they never even existed.

They were erased.

Gone from social media, phone records, yearbooks.

Only one thing remained.
That fucking EVP recording.

That one word.
That one impossible, monstrous word:

“BELOW.”

That was ten years ago.
Tonight, the sky is red.
The wind is still.
The time is right.

I’m going back.

I’ve gathered a real team this time. Seasoned ghost hunters, researchers, a couple of my military buddies, people who think they’ve seen it all.

I’m posting this in case I don’t return.

I need people to know I existed.
That my friends existed.
And that what happened in Stull was real.

If this is the end for me.
If I vanish too.
I beg all of you to do me one favor.

Stay the fuck out of Stull, Kansas.
