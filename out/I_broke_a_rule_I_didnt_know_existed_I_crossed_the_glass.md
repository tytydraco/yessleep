I’ve never liked mirrors. Something about the way they reflect, not just light, but something else. Like they remember more than they should. I used to joke about it. Until last night.

I was fixing my tie in the bathroom, just a normal end to a long day. My reflection followed every move… until it didn’t. As I adjusted my collar, my mirrored self paused. Just for a second. Long enough to feel wrong.

I froze. I tilted my head left. The reflection went right. I backed away. It followed… and then stopped. Eyes locked on mine.

That’s when I remembered something I hadn’t thought of in years. I was maybe seven. Crying in front of my bedroom mirror. My mom knelt beside me and said something I didn’t understand back then: “Just don’t get too close. Don’t cross the glass.”

I always thought she meant it figuratively. But now? Now I’m not so sure.

The reflection smiled. Not my smile. Wider. Off. Like it had never practiced being human but was trying anyway.

I stumbled and hit the sink. Water sprayed my wrist. I looked down. When I looked back up, the reflection hadn’t moved. Except now it was raising its hand.

Mine wasn’t.

Its arm lifted slowly, like through water, until it pointed directly at me.

Then it spoke.

“Wrong move.”

The voice came from the mirror, not from me, not even an echo. Just a sound that crawled into the room like smoke. I ran.

As I hit the hallway, the voice followed. “You crossed the glass…”

I turned back toward the bathroom. The mirror was still visible… but it wasn’t reflecting anymore. The counters looked warped, stretched like melting wax. My reflection was still standing there, grinning with hollow, black eyes.

I should have run. But I didn’t. Something in me wouldn’t allow it.

I stepped closer. The air smelled faintly burnt and sweet, like wilted flowers and dust. The mirror shimmered, like heat rising off pavement.

There was a crack in the corner of the glass. In the reflection, it ran straight across my throat.

I leaned in. My reflection did too, mirroring me again. But the eyes were still wrong. Still watching.

Then the lights went out. Total darkness.

Then the whisper returned. “You crossed the glass. And now it remembers you.”

Panicking, I reached out blindly. My hand touched the mirror. But it wasn’t cold. It was soft. Like skin. My fingers sank in. The mirror wasn’t reflecting anymore. It was opening.

I tried to scream, but nothing came out. The pressure in my chest tightened with each second, like the air itself was folding in on me. The mirror’s surface rippled again, and I could see movement, shadows slithering behind the glass, shapes without form, shifting like smoke underwater.

They were watching me. Waiting.

I don’t know what I thought I was going to do, maybe break the mirror, maybe run again. But I couldn’t move. My feet felt rooted to the tile. My hand was still pressed into the glass, or whatever it had become. It didn’t feel like glass anymore. It felt like flesh trying to remember how to be solid.

Then something gripped my wrist.

It didn’t yank or pull. It just held me there. Firm. I looked down and saw fingers, pale, thin, and twitching, sliding through the surface, wrapping around my arm like vines. I stared at them, paralyzed.

“You were always going to come back,” the voice whispered. “We just had to wait for you to forget.”

The mirror pulled harder. My other hand clawed at the frame, but it was no use. The lights flickered violently. The glass, or... skin, began to stretch and breathe.

I could see my reflection again now. But it wasn’t standing still anymore. It was pacing. Smiling. Mimicking panic in my own face as if rehearsing how to wear it. Then it stopped and turned toward me one last time.

It winked.

And then everything went black.

I woke up, if you can call it that, staring out from the other side.

The bathroom looks the same. My toothbrush. The towels. The cracked tile on the floor. Everything’s normal. Except I’m not really there. I’m behind it now. Watching.

Waiting.

I don’t know how long I’ve been here. Time doesn’t work right. But sometimes, when the lights are low and the glass fogs over, I see him, the one that took my place, living my life like he’s always belonged.

And sometimes, just sometimes… he looks into the mirror and winks back.

He knows I’m still here.
