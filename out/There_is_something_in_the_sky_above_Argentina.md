Now there is a rule here on this subreddit that everything must be assumed to be true, but you can corroborate this yourself.

There is a light in the sky above Cordoba, Argentina. I am here on a volunteer service trip. Go outside, right now, if you are in Cordoba, or maybe even just Argentina, and look straight up. There is something in the sky.

It's moving erratically. Like a drone, or a weather balloon. At first I thought it was a plane. But it's been up there for hours, so it is not a drone. It could be a weather balloon. Could be. But it stays in the same general area, below the cloud level (I don't know if weather balloons go below the clouds or not) and it doesn't go outside of this general area in the center of the sky, like it is tethered to something. There's a different reason I don't think it's a weather balloon.

It's sickening. I don't mean that metaphorically. It is sickening to observe. When you look at it long enough, your ears start to ring. Like in the movies when there is a flashbang, but at a much lower volume. Then the dizziness. You feel increasingly woozy. Then the absolute dread. The feeling of primal terror.

The feelings this light in the sky causes are abject discomfort. You feel like you are looking down the barrel of a gun, like this light is ready to explode, or come crashing down at you, any moment. The dread paired with it is unlike anything I have ever experienced. I have seen the worst horrors of life. I promise you. Every terrible thing you can imagine on the dark web (Funkytown and more). This feeling is incomparable.

It makes you think the world is going to end. Like you are walking alone in the woods with no communication and no weapons and you have noticed a mountain lion stalking you. You feel as if you are going to be violently torn apart.

I'm not the only one. I had my housemates come look, and each and every one became upset or angry with me that I asked them to look. They all said they regret it. They all went inside when the feelings of terror arrived.

So why keep looking? This is where I need your help, /r/nosleep. It is spelling something. It is fucking creating letters and numbers with its flight path. I can't tell what because I can't get it on my phone camera, and looking at it too long makes me feel like I must drown myself in the pool in front of me. Someone needs to go out and record this, because in all my years alive and of all the things I have experienced and witnessed, this is something else. It's worse than a vengeful God, or aliens, or cosmic horrors. It is like looking into the eyes of pure torture and hate.

I am going to bed. I will try and provide updates. Somehow, though, I'm worried if I sleep tonight, I will never wake again.
