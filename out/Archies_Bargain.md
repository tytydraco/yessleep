“Wake yourself mate”, a deep gravelly voice boomed out from the dark, as a withered, calloused hand scraped against my sleeping garb, a firm grip on my shoulder shaking me to a state of awakening. 

The light creeped in through the porthole of my quarters, the sun barely creeping over the horizon illuminating the Captain’s face in a bright orange. The man was tall and pale, the sunlight permeating through blinding me as it reflected off his aging face. 

As I squinted my eyes, I croaked out a weak, but firm, “good morning”. 

You see, the Captain and I haven’t been seeing eye to eye as of late. The division between us growing each day as we kept sailing towards what he thought was a promise of riches, a cascading mountain of gold and gemstones large enough to put Ebenezer Scrooge to shame. But I have seen this before. I know better than anyone that nothing good can come from a chance encounter. Especially not an encounter from a worn-down port town tavern. 

As the ships navigator, I was sworn to my duty to guide these men, safely through the frigid waters, regardless of my own feelings surrounding the Captain’s fantasies. 

“I’ll be out in a moment, Captain” I said, gritting my teeth as the pain in my back and head alternated, rhythmically, cascading a symphony of pain along the entirety of my frame. Despite this, I pulled myself to my feet, the cold wooden floor sending shivers into my body through the bottoms of my frosted digits. 

Quickly and most certainly begrudgingly, I slung my garments onto myself, wincing in pain with every swift movement made, so as to not anger the Captain more than I already had, following yesterday’s abusive tirade about the dangers of wandering into senseless fantasies.

When I cracked open the door, I saw the hallways were still bereft of any light, the hanging lanterns empty and pristine, pinpricks dust beginning to coat the inner walls of the glass as the Captain forbade any lighting of the fires, as per the instructions given by the stranger, which are beginning to feel more like strict regulations on how to live our day to day lives onboard his vessel. 

Slowly, I stepped out the adjoining door and onto the deck, seeing the crew already lined up in front of the Captain and the stranger, who both looked increasingly agitated at the lack of my presence in what they considered a timely manner. 

Once I reached the crew, I slipped into the mass of eight men, and awaited the Captain’s ridiculous ramblings. As he began to speak, I could barely focus on the words, as again I found my gaze stuck to the well-dressed stranger standing adjacent to him. Since the day he stepped on board, my eyes had been involuntarily glued to him. Whenever he was near, a feeling of distrust, and increasing skepticism washed into my psyche, never allowing myself to lower my guard. At night, sleeping no easier, vivid nightmares plagued my dreams, while the feeling of being watched never wavered. I would awake from a deep slumber to see a shadowy figure standing at the foot of my bed, before slowly creeping its way out the doorway. 

“Now men!” the Captain spoke, his gravelly voice booming as if it had been swarming for a decade around his rounded stomach. “We are three days out from treasure, if we are to reach this destination unscathed, you are all to listen to our new friend,” turning his head to look the stranger in the eyes. “Mr. Archie has had his peepers privy to this loot horde since he was just a boy, and with us at the helm, he now has the means to acquire it. But don’t fathom mates, he has ensured us our fair share of the booty.” The crew cheered, their fists shot towards the sky, which was now illuminated by the morning glow. 

Once again, amidst the celebrations, I found myself staring at the strange man. He was an Englishman, tall for his people but certainly not an intimidating figure. He looked not like a wealthy businessman, say for his clothes that sported silver buttons, the details of his suit lined by golden thread so fine that it had its own illuminative glow. And despite the conditions of a ship, where every seat, barrel, door and floor had grime, dirt and debris, his suit seemed to never have a speck. Alas, the suit hid the more hideous details. The man had a frail frame, with arms and legs that elongated out of their sockets as if he were stretched as a child. Each finger on his sunken hands came to a boney point, appearing that at even the slightest of touch, would shred your wears to tatters. His cheeks clung the bones of his jaw like he hadn’t eaten for weeks, and his red, inflamed gums puffed up into his rotted teeth like a sailor dying to scurvy. 

I snapped back to reality by the Captain calling for me, “Thomas!”, the flair in his voice screamed of a deep hatred, “we need to get this ship moving.”

Hesitantly, I nodded.

“Drop the sails!” yelled the Captain, as the crew scattered to their stations. Mr. Archie had the map in hand, pointing out our destination whilst I mapped out our approximate location. “What is this treasure we are after anyways?” I asked, our noses down, entranced by the illustrations on the thick paper. “I want only one thing. All the gold, and gems, and anything else you can plunder is all your crews’ to keep”, he replied, still holding the map with a ferocious grip, as if he thought the sea and wind herself would try to steal the map from his clutches. “And that would be?” I further inquired, hoping he would spill what he had so desperately be seeking for. “The time will come”, is all he muttered. 

Whilst we sailed, the Captain eagerly peered through the spyglass at every passing object, be it a bird, or floating debris. Curiously he scanned the horizon, an unwavering smirk plastered across his cracked lips.

As the sun began to set, the Captain and Mr. Archie wrangled up the crew for a hearty meal. Albeit a stranger to us, Mr. Archie had generously bought a large amount of provisions for the crew, which the chef had prepared during the voyage. Upon entering the galley, my nose was surrounded by a cacophony of smells, the distinct smell of stew, roasts, and hearty vegetables. The table was littered with a feast, which included the likes of a gigantic pig roast, complimented rich and savoury grilled leeks, and on the other side, a rich, deeply flavourful rabbit stew, with crusty bread to dip inside. The man had even bought butter, which was considered a delicacy among the men in this vessel. 

We feasted for what felt like hours, the booze flowed, the crew danced, and the food kept coming out, each dish filled to the brim with hearty meals. They sang shanties of riches and of women beyond our wildest dreams, they spoke of how they’d spend their gold, some had dreams of owning land, becoming a father, whilst others dreamt of extravagance. Some even dreamed of creating a fleet of ships, enough to take down even the largest of Spaniard ships. 

By the time the night was over, I was stumbling. Manuel helped me to my feet, and together we stumbled our way to the quarters. Manuel was a strong young Spaniard who had joined our crew after a trial by blood, in which he was the last survivor on a small vessel we had destroyed. We had boarded the ship, to find three Spaniards still aboard the ship, the Captain had us tie each of them up as we ransacked them. Manuel, the youngest of the three, began to beg and plead for his life, but the Captain was having son of it. He raised his blade to Manuel’s throat, telling him to “shut your filthy Spaniard trap, for if I hear another word from your serpent tongue, I’ll cut it out before we leave you to Neptune.” But something in Manuel’s eyes gave him pause, like Manuel never wanted to be on that ship in the first place. Without a second thought, he cut the binds holding the man in place, and handed him another blade that he kept in his boot. The crew protested, saying a Spaniard would no sooner die before betraying their own, but Manuel, did. He slit the throats of the other two men on board, before returning the blade to the Captain, a gesture which only served to earn the young man more respect in the eyes of the Captain, and as such, he was one of our own. 

As we said our goodnights, and headed into our separate quarters, I couldn’t help but feel the existential dread I had felt earlier. The searing, painfully obvious feeling of somebody watching me, their eyes slicing hot daggers into the back of my skull. Even as I drunkenly stumbled, the feeling was unmistakeable. I tried to turn to look, but I could not unglue my neck from where it was looking, straight ahead at my bed. 

I fell onto the woven blankets, trying desperately to ignore the feeling I have become all too accustomed to since the arrival of Mr. Archie, but it was unwavering. As I lay, I felt a coward, like a child whom hides under his blanket for fear that simply looking at the monstrosity, will allow it to see them. But no matter what I did, I could not move. I could not scream. I could not utter a word. 

The feeling worsened, the quiet, light slapping of bare feet against the wooden floor exasperated the fear, but the worst was yet to come. 

As I lay, the feeling of static against the back of my shirt became increasingly noticeable, the faint tickle of breathing cascaded up my neck in waves, as if whomever was behind me was fighting their lungs in an eternal battle to pull even a wheeze of air out of them, and as the feeling of being watched ramped up, the searing pain of somebody staring directly into my soul made my muscles scream as every last one of them tensed up, feeling as if they were going to burst one by one and fill my room with a percussive orchestra of agony. 

My heart was beating out of my chest, its rhythm amplified in my ears as I struggled to breathe, the feeling that I was going to die in that moment, whether it be to whatever was behind me, or the immense fear, was undeniable. 

Then, I passed out. 

While the crew dreamt of riches and women, I spun through endless horrors. In my dreams, the ship did not make it to our destination. 

A maelstrom of souls, hundreds of not thousands of screaming men, women, and children rose endlessly into the sky like a hurricane, an orange hue illuminated the horizon like hell on Earth, whilst the blackened shadowy storm billowed and crackled with thunder and heavy rain, the screams drowning out the cries of the crew as we desperately tried to batten down the hatches. One by one, the shadowy pursuers began to board the ship, each of them a boney mass of rotting flesh and guts, an unspeakable horror that felt like a grim warning that if we did not change course, our fates would be sealed. As I backed away from creatures, they slowly surrounded me, their boney hands pulling at my arms and legs leaving gashes as their sharpened bones sliced me like a knife. I tried to fight but there were too many, they were dragging me, somewhere, but I had no choices. Even as I fought it became imminent that it was either they dragged me away, or I died to a thousand cuts. 

The pain was unbearable, it was a searing pain, like a hot blade slicing through your muscle and flesh before cauterizing itself, just to inflict as much torture and agony before you ultimately perished. 

They knelt me before the storm, their fingers dragging through my shaggy, unkempt hair, before grasping hard and snapping my head back to stare into the madness. I felt my soul escaping, being dragged out of my physical half and towards the maelstrom of others. I saw my lifeless body, shadowy essence of myself escaping through my open mouth, assisted by those creatures skeletal hands, until I fell limp.

Then, as if it had never happened at all, I awoke. 

Looking out the porthole, the sun was just beginning to break the horizon. The glow of the morning sun burned my weary eyes, an after effect of the alcohol and shameful crying I had done the night before when that… thing, imbedded itself into my mind. 

The cold floor against my feet felt, oddly, satisfying today. The hangover hit like a truck, and all I wanted was to lay down on the wooden floorboards. But as I stared, something caught my eye. 

The floor was covered in a light layer of frost, except for the few wet footprints that lead out the door. They were small, most definitely that of a woman, or an adolescent boy. I felt a shiver go down my spine as I remembered the feeling of breath on my neck last night. I muttered to myself, “Who is on the ship with us?”

Once dressed, I stormed directly to the Captain’s quarters. The knock that came out of my desperation was loud enough to wake the entire ship. 

Groggily and angrily, the Captain opened his door, “what in God’s name do you think you’re doing James?” he hissed. 

“Captain, we have to change course. Now.” I steadfastly replied. 

He slammed his fist against the door, an anger broke out of him I hadn’t seen since a Spaniard had killed his brother. “Are you kidding me?” he erupted, “for the first time in your miserable existence you’ll be able to have anything you’ve ever wanted, and you are backing out of this, on me, on us?”

The crew slowly began to creep into the hall, hearing the commotion. Their judgmental eyes glaring me down as if I had just committed a cardinal sin. 

“I am not backing out on you Captain, I just know something’s wrong with this whole expedition. There’s footprints in my quarters. Wet ones. Ones of a woman, or an adolescent boy. Come see for yourself.” I said. 

The eyes of the crew mates looked amongst themselves, then back at me. 

“I don’t care if there’s an alligator in your bed, we are not turning around. And that’s final.” The Captain replied, the rage so clearly boiling over that the veins in his pale forehead were on the cusp of bursting. 

“I refuse to navigate it. We need to stop at the nearest port.” I argued. 

The crew broke out into whispered gasps. Nobody had challenged the Captain’s authority, and the feeling that they’re going to be losing out on riches beyond their imaginations made some speak up. 

“We need you, James. Please.” some pleaded. Others glared at me in disgust. 

“We don’t need him.” The Captain finally spoke up, “throw him in the brig.”

Three of the crew men approached me, I pleaded and begged, telling them this is a mistake, but it was of no use. The idea of riches was too far seeded in their minds to care about safety anymore. Their minds were made. 

I wailed and unleashed a flurry of punches on my captors but it was to no avail, they easily overpowered me, and began to drag me down into the darkness. I continued to plead and fight be nothing worked. My back and head ached as I thrashed about but the only thing on my mind was survival. I kicked one of the mates in the groin, freeing myself temporarily before feeling my ankles being grabbed again. I grabbed ahold of the railing to the stairs, fighting the urge to let go as they pulled on my legs, the muscles in my arms feeling as if they’re tearing apart, the burning in my biceps turned to freezing cold ice and eventually the railing gave way, breaking off from the wall and hitting me square in the chin, knocking me unconscious. 

And that’s where I am now. I woke up an hour ago in the brig. Sailing towards certain death, with no say, and no escape.

If anything changes, I’ll be sure to update you all.
