The bathroom mirror mocks me. The zit on my forehead throbs red, screaming its defiance. First week back at uni and I look like a sewer rat. Several days' worth of clear skin flushed down the crapper by this blemish.

Girls will be recoiling, faces screwed up in disgust. They'll whisper and laugh. Assuming any of them even bother to glance my way.

I cling to my pathetic illusion that some girl might actually find me intriguing, but is too shy to let on her interest. It's a self-made fantasy, a flimsy shield against the brutal reality: I'm invisible to every woman. This zit won't make a difference, just another layer of grime on an already pathetic surface.

The tension coils my shoulders tight. I stomp to the living room, irritation simmering, and find my mom blubbering on the couch.

"What's wrong, mum?" I snap, already on edge.

"Dad..." She sobs. "He's... he's with your grandmother."

I stare at her. "What are you even saying?"

She sniffs and wipes her nose with her sleeve "Your father is having sex with your grandmother."

"What?" My jaw drops open wide.

Downstairs, I find him still under the sheets. He sticks his head under there deeper when he sees me coming. "Dad, what the hell is going on?" I yell. "Also why are you still sleeping? You promised to drive me to university!"

He grunts something muffled and unintelligible from under the blankets.

"And what's with you and grandma?" I lose it completely, "you're 70 years old for fuck's sake! Having sex with your own mother?"

As I say this, it hits me: My grandma's been dead for seven years.

Who the hell is he sleeping with?

A noise from the kitchen sends me running, heart pounding in my chest. It's a succubus! A nightmare comes to life, all stretched skin and bleached bones, eyes burning with hunger for blood and flesh.

She lunges at me with claws extended, a screech tearing from her throat. I backpedal away but she's too quick, catching my wrist in an iron grip.

"No!" I yell as she drags me toward the kitchen sink. Her claws graze my face, pain blooms near my eyes.

Suddenly, a blinding light explodes behind her, and there's this Saint Nicholas standing with his sword. With one mighty swipe of that blade he slices through her, cleaves her in two. Green viscous innards splatter everywhere, covering me in a pool of filth and rotting flesh.

I retch. Saint Nicholas stands there smiling, his face all smug.

"Be more careful next time," he says with a wink. "Don't wander into the kitchen without calling me first."

I nod. I want to hug him, but he shakes his head. "Fist bump?" He offers.

I stand there shaking, the stink still clinging to my skin, like fear made physical. My thoughts spiral. Am I losing it?

I head upstairs to shower off the stench. In the bathroom mirror, the zit stares back. Shit! I take a deep breath and try to shake off the horrors of the day.
