Dom dreamt he floundered in a superheated sea, and an octopus had ensnared him in its tentacles, and he was suffocating... 

Dom woke, sweating, tangled in his quilt, nose still blocked and sinuses swollen from flu. Pulling himself free of the bedding, he staggered up, vision spinning, and shuffled into the kitchen. The house was empty, late morning sun pierced through the partly drawn curtains, and he squinted at the note on the fridge. 

“Hi babe, there's soup in the fridge if you want to reheat it for lunch. Don't forget to check on Blue. Back around 6. Hope you feel better. Love ya.” 

The thought of food made his stomach lurch threateningly. He glanced out the window into the backyard, saw that Blue was chasing her tail and barking excitedly, and holding on to a box of tissues as if it were a baby, he lumbered to the couch and collapsed, wheezing. He flicked on the TV, and promptly fell asleep. 

He woke, startled, to the chant of “Je-rry, Je-rry,” and pressed the mute button in disgust. So thirsty. He looked out the window again as he filled his glass from the tap, and couldn't see the dog. 

“Blue,” he croaked, his voice cracked. He sipped the water, grimacing in pain as he swallowed. “Blue,” he called again. No dog appeared. “Ah fuckit,” he muttered. Blue had recently realized she could jump the fence, and ran off almost every day. Normally he fretted about the ranger nabbing her, but today he was too sick to care. She always came home eventually. 

He returned to the couch, and watched a therapeutic dose of daytime TV. A little Ricky Lake, some Days of our Lives, and he dozed again. When he blinked awake once more, the shadows outside were lengthening. He blew his nose, and added the sodden tissue to the small mountain accumulating next to the couch. He heard growling outside, and when he managed to stand up, overcome the dizziness, and walk to the window, he saw that Blue had returned, and was chewing on a grotty child-size red shoe she'd found somewhere, and growling contentedly. Great, more crap for the backyard. 

Rae should be home soon. He looked forward to her sympathy and attention. She'd make him tea with honey in it, and maybe scrambled eggs. She'd tolerate his pathetic state, though she'd remind him of it once he was better. 

The car pulled into the driveway, and he arranged himself on the couch, going for a noble blend of stoic and suffering. She came in, dropped a kiss on his forehead, and clucked sympathetically while she turned on the news. 

“How was your day?” Dom asked hoarsely. 

She made a face. 

“Horrible accident, not far from here actually. Kid got hit by a truck. He came into the ER, but there was nothing they could do for the little guy. Look,” she gestured at the screen. “This is it now.” 

He looked at the images – the twisted remains of a child's bicycle, a sobbing mother, a small figure on a stretcher being loaded onto an ambulance, the red shoe on his visible foot dirty and stained. 

“And what was really awful,” Rae went on, “was that in the accident, one of his feet was completely severed, and the emergency services guys couldn't find it anywhere at the scene. God only knows where it went.” 

She wandered into the kitchen, still talking, and he stared blankly at the TV, mouth full of bile. 

“I guess I should feed Blue,” Rae said.
