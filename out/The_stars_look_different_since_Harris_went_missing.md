***Space is silent.*** A perfect, airless hush pressing in on our ship as we orbit the moon Calypso. Between me and that void are only a few inches of metal—my last shield against oblivion. 

Far below, Calypso’s icy surface glows with reflected sunlight, and beyond it Saturn looms as a distant, dim half-circle. Inside our cramped vessel, I hear nothing but the hum of life support and my own breathing.

There are only two of us aboard this research ship, sent on a long mission to study Calypso’s bright surface and the strange readings coming from beneath its crust. My crewmate, Harris, is an engineer, and I’m the pilot-scientist. We’ve spent months in transit and orbit. Harris was competent and calm, if a bit distant; we worked well together, but we were colleagues, not quite friends.

••

Three days into orbit, Harris went outside the ship on a routine EVA to fix a jammed sensor on the hull. I watched from the cockpit, keeping an eye on his tether and listening to his steady voice over the radio as he inched along the side of the craft. Calypso’s white landscape spun slowly below him. Nothing seemed amiss until a blaring proximity alarm made me jump.

An instant later, something struck the ship with a thunderous bang, and the whole vessel shuddered. I lunged to the nearest viewport and saw Harris’s tether trailing loose. My heart froze. One moment he had been attached to the hull; the next, I caught sight of his white-suited figure tumbling away into the blackness. 

***“Adrian!”*** he shouted, his voice breaking with panic over the comm. I grabbed the controls, trying desperately to orient the ship or fire thrusters to chase him, but automated safety locks had kicked in. ***“Hold on!”*** I yelled, uselessly. I watched in helpless horror as Harris drifted farther, a tiny flailing silhouette against the starry void. His breaths were ragged over the radio, then painfully calm. Through static, I heard fragments of his last transmission:

***”…so beautiful… you have t—”*** Then, nothing.

••

I called his name until my throat ached, but there was only silence. Harris was gone—lost in space with no way back. Eventually I sent a terse report of the accident to Mission Control, knowing it would be hours, maybe days before anyone even received it.

With a transmission delay of this long each way, it felt like I was just screaming into the void. I was utterly alone, left to float in orbit with the awful weight of what had happened. 

The next few hours passed in a numb haze as I alternated between frantic scans for any sign of him and stunned disbelief that my crewmate—the only other human out here—was now just… gone. The sight of Harris’s empty seat across the cabin hit me like a punch to the gut. We had worked together for months, yet I realized I never truly knew him—and now I never would. 

Outside the viewport, Calypso gleamed in the sunlight below, indifferent to the tragedy that had just unfolded; the silent stars offered no comfort.

••

Sometime later, as I sat strapped in the cockpit, a sound jolted me upright. A dull, rhythmic **knock… knock… knock** echoed through the hull. I thought I was imagining it at first. Nothing should be making that noise out here. Then it came again, resonating through the metal. Heart pounding, I floated down the narrow corridor toward the airlock, gripping the wall rungs to propel myself through the weightlessness. 

*The sound was coming from there.*

••

Through the small round window of the thick outer hatch, I could see the stars… and a figure. There was someone outside the airlock, knocking to come in. A surge of impossible hope and confusion hit me. I pressed my face to the glass, peering out. It was an astronaut in a white EVA suit. 

My breath caught in my throat as my helmet light reflected off a familiar patch on the suit’s chest: **HARRIS.** It was him. He was right there, clinging to the exterior rung next to the hatch.

I almost laughed with relief—and then I saw his helmet, or rather the lack of it. Harris’s helmet was gone. Nothing protected his head; I could see his uncovered face fully exposed to space. My stomach dropped in utter disbelief. He couldn’t be alive out there with no helmet, not after hours in vacuum. Yet here he was, looking right at me.

••

In the dim starlight and the glow from our ship’s running lights, I finally saw his face and recoiled. Harris’s skin was pale as chalk and marred with web-like cracks of blackened, ruptured veins. A dusting of frost glittered on his cheeks and forehead. His eyes were wide open, fixed on me through the window; the whites were blood-red and one pupil was blown, giving him a wild, inhuman gaze. His lips had peeled back from his teeth in a stiff grimace that might have been a grin. He looked like a corpse flash-frozen in the midst of a scream. And still, he knocked—raising one bare hand to rap his knuckles against the hull, again and again, with patient, horrible insistence.

I hung there, paralyzed, unable to comprehend what I was seeing. The vibration of each knock through the hull proved it wasn’t a hallucination. As I struggled to gather my wits, a burst of static hissed from the wall speaker. My heart almost stopped. Through the crackle, I heard a weak whisper: “Adrian… let me in.” It was Harris’s voice, distorted and warbling, slightly out of sync with the movement of his lips outside. It felt like hearing a ghost in the machine.

••

I pressed the intercom button with shaking fingers. ***“Harris?”*** I croaked. ***“How… how are you—?”*** My question died as his voice, soft and eerily calm, came through the speaker again. 

**“It’s okay,”*** he crackled. ***“I’m okay now. Let me in, Adrian.”*** There was a strange echo behind his words, a layered whisper that made my skin crawl. ***“Come outside with me… you have to see this. It’s beautiful,”*** he continued.

Through the tiny window, Saturn’s ghostly rings shimmered behind him and the stars blinked uncaring. Space had always been beautiful in its own cold way, but not like this—never like this. Whatever wonder he thought he’d found out there, it felt wrong, defiled by the impossibility of his presence.

My blood ran cold. That voice was definitely Harris’s, but he was speaking in a way he never had before—too calm, almost gentle, and completely at odds with the nightmare in front of me. 

The Harris I knew would be frantic, gasping for air, not serenely inviting me into the vacuum. He would never ask me to step outside without a suit. Every instinct I had screamed that this was not truly my crewmate at all, but something else wearing his skin. For all I knew, the strange anomaly beneath Calypso’s crust that we came to study had reached out and done this to him. 

I darted a glance at the suit telemetry panel on the wall; it was flickering with impossible data, alternating between flatlines and erratic spikes, as if even the computer couldn’t decide if he was really alive or dead.

I realized my hand was hovering over the airlock release. I desperately wanted to believe he was somehow alive and saveable, but opening that door felt like stepping off a cliff. My arm shook as I fought the urge. In the end, I couldn’t do it. A choking sob escaped me as I backed away from the hatch. ***“I’m sorry,”*** I whispered, not sure if he could even hear.

••

Through the window, I thought I saw his expression falter—the grin slackening into something like disappointment. Slowly, Harris placed his pale hand on the glass, fingertips splayed. He dragged them down the window, leaving streaks of frost where his skin met the icy surface. The faint squeal of his frozen fingertips on the glass made me wince. Then the knocking resumed, a steady, unrelenting beat echoing through the hull. 

He was going to wait as long as it took. He wasn’t leaving. For the first time, it felt like the vacuum of space itself was pounding to get inside.

My mind reeled between desperate denial and creeping terror. This couldn’t be real, *and yet it was happening inches away from me.* I felt utterly trapped—alone in a tin can in Saturn’s shadow, with my dead crewmate’s impossible apparition waiting just outside, trying to get in. I hovered there in the dark corridor, lit only by a faint red emergency glow, trembling and on the verge of panic, caught between disbelief and a slowly mounting, unspeakable dread.
