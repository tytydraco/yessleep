As I plunged into the ice cold water, with the last bit of energy I had I did my best to swim to shore. My leg was still aching and I needed to find my way out of the forest. I heard a high pitch scream in the distance, and I knew it wouldn't be long before that thing found me. I had to move fast. I realized after moving deeper into the heart of the forest, I couldn't keep this up with my leg. I also realized that the fall down to the water agrovated my other leg also. I looked around, and spotted a wooden shack. Out of options I limped toward it, tried the door and it opened. I was safe, for now.

The shacks layout was almost like a tool shed, many tools on the wall, a shelf in the very back with boxes upon boxes on it. I took out my phone, and tried to call the police. As I suspected, I got no signal. Frusterated I threw my phone against the wall. I was scared, alone, and badly hurt. Just then, I heard the door swing open, and the ominous click off safety on a gun. 

The figure holding the gun, was a man with slick black hair. He looked to be in his mid 50s, he had a long beard also. He asked me who I was, and why I was in his tool shed. I explained to him, I was lost and hurt and that I needed help. He noticed how bruised I was, and I showed him the gash on my leg. He put the gun down and introduced himself. His name was Darren. 

Darren helped me up, and I asked him if he had a phone on him. He said no, and explained that you didn't get service on this side of the Forrest. He did however, know his way around the Forrest, and he could take me to the nearest road. I agreed, and followed him in the darkness. Not even 5 feet outside the shack, and I saw 4 other men in animal masks waiting outside. Before I could do anything, I was hit in the head with the butt of Darren's rifle. It all went black.

I woke up tied to a tree trunk with Darren staring at me. The 4 men in the animal masks were behind him, holding different assortment of weapons.


>Darren: "Look who's finally awake, just in time"

>Me: "What the fuck is going on, why are you people doing this to me?"

>Darren: "You interrupted the cycle, you weren't suppost to escape. The Forrest, the desolate chose you."

>Me: "What the fuck are you talking about? Please just let me go."

>Darren: "You were suppost to die, the desolate wishes it."

>Me: "Please, please I'll give you guys money. Just please let me go. I am begging you. I won't tell anyone, you have my word."

Just then I heard it's scream, it was coming near. With that the 5 men left, and I was left to die. I started to panic, my heart was racing. I was tied up to a tree, left for dead. I had to find a way out. I then remembered in my pocket I had my pocket knife. For some reason those crazy bastards, didn't take it off of me. I slowly shuffled my hand towards my pants pocket, and attempted to grab the knife. I managed to grab it, and cut myself free.  But then I saw it, the creature found me.

As soon as I got up, I tried to run but remembered my leg was hurt. There was no way I could outrun this thing, just then Darren and the other 4 men came back. They started coming towards me, but then the creauture lunged towards the 5 men. Tearing each of them limb from limb, as they fought. The amount of gun shots were deafening. I took this chance to escape, and as fast as I could I got out of there.i could still hear the shrieks of the men, and that creauture. I had to keep going, I had to get out of this forsaken Forrest. I just hoped my luck doesn t get worse.
