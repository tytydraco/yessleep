The man in a white coat was walking hurriedly down the hall of the old building, each step creating a deafening echo in the silence around him.
“Fuck”
The man exclaims as he opens the door to a mess of an office at the end of the hall, he flicks the light and stumbles around the office slinging open drawers and cabinet looking for something.
“Where is it?!” The man yells
Where “clunk” the man’s hand slides his hand across the cold metal of the gun.
He turns then… “silence”.
“What the fuck?, it just ends there?” Mike exclaims stepping away from the screen.
“Told you it’s an odd one” I say, “now, let’s go check the body” 
“Nothing?” Mike says 

“there’s nothing wrong with the body just cold”
“We’ll then what was he shooting at?”
Right then we hear a bang from the end of the hall, as we both spin around looking at the hall for the source.
“Did you hear that?” I said already knowing the answer
“Come on let’s go check it out” Mike says
“hate this part of the job” I say letting out an unenthusiastic sigh
“The main part?” Mike chuckled to himself 
Trying to replace our fear with comedy.

We work our way down the hall, Me and Mike each have our hands on our service pistol, as we inch our way with each step around the corner at the end of the hall we freeze.
Standing in front of me was a 6ft tall dog like creature that had more mouth then face, rows and rows of sharp blood stained teeth, and fur that was black, patchy, and covered in blood the beast shot its head up as me and Mike pull our weapons and immediately begin firing, What the fuck is that!” I scream as we start taking steps back towards the office.
Mike just looks at me as with fear in his eyes as our bullets seem to do nothing more than scratch the beast.
“Reload” 
I yell as I switch the mag to my pistol.
The creature starts to slowly walk towards us, speeding up with each step until we’re all running down the hall, Mike turns to fire hoping to catch it off guard as the creature jumps and bounces off the wall tumbling towards Mike at full speed
“MIKE!” 

I scream as the beast digs into his flesh, but I don’t stop I take the chance to grab Mikes gun and run past the creature and around the hall,
As my shoes scratch on the ground further grabbing the creatures attention as it slowly picks it’s head up looking for me, it screeches as it runs and bounces off the walls as I make it to the red exit door.

I slam my shoulder into it falling into a room full of desks and chair 
“Ah fuck” I yell
Picking myself off the ground trying to pop my shoulder back in place when I turn to see the creature about to leap through the door when I slam it hitting the creature in the face.
Quickly grabbing a chair and putting it under the handle as the beast slams against the door, not getting through until I’m almost to the stairs, I run and run sweat beating of my face as I swing the door open just then the creatures flys over my head landing at the bottom of the stairs, I quickly started running up as fast as I could feeling pain in my chest with each passing breath,
“Fuck you, I yell at the creature”
Going through another door at the dip of the stairs the beast close behind, when it dives and grabs my foot swinging me back and fourth until it snaps off like a twig.

AHHHHH SHIT!! 

I scream as I fly through the air slamming through another door.
The creature stepping towards me slowly spitting my leg on the ground.
“What…, what are you I yell?”
It seems to smile as it charges towards me, quickly I grab a metal pole from the broke door holding between the creatures open mouth as it try’s to bite down on my head, grabbing my pistol with my other hand I hold it to its eye and unleash every round left in the clip.
The creature finally dropping to the ground, life fleeting from it’s eyes as I passed out.

I woke up 5 days later in a hospital covered in scars, a broken shoulder and a missing leg, when I asked the supervisor if I killed it
He simply smiled and said some folks are here from a government agency when 3 men wearing all black suits with a logo of 3 arrows pointing towards the center on their shoulder, the oldest of the 3 steps forward extending his hand saying 
“If you can tell me how you killed the beast I can get that leg situation handled for you, maybe even a promotion as he winked”
I just smiled.
