It began on July 2nd of last year. I was traveling for the first time. Unbelievably, I'd never left my hometown until then. So I was excited to say the least. My parents were worried, however. They've lived in our town for their entire lives, never venturing outside of it. But, I'm an adult now and have finally moved out. So I decided to celebrate this occasion with my first trip. I picked somewhere just a 30-minute drive from my home. But to me, that was still far, far away. My best friend, Jeremy, and I decided to take a river tour with an exceptional view of the mountains and hills. I only wish this memory wasn't tainted by what happened because it was beautiful indeed. 

Upon arrival, we got in our raft and sat in the chairs. Our tour guide was equipped with a paddle, and he guided us along the river. He had clearly been doing this for a long time, made evident by his tan skin and wrinkles. He guided us effortlessly through the winding river. It was peaceful. So peaceful, I decided I’d take some pictures for memories. A decision I’d soon come to regret. When I attempted to fish my phone out of my jean pockets, well, it slipped. With a plop, it landed right into the water before I even had time to react.

I yelled out. 

“My phone!" The tour guide stopped and looked in my direction. “Hey! Can you help me? My phone fell in the water?"

“I’m sorry, but there's not really anything I can do. These waters are NOT suitable for diving." I was silent. I didn't know what to say. What was I to do? At least I had my friend with me; otherwise, I may have had trouble getting home. Maybe my parents were right after all. They’d always warned me that our hometown was safe, and we knew that to be the case, but outside was unknown. Dangerous places lurked out there, and they didn't want me to find them.

I was being dramatic. Of course, they were wrong. Millions of people travel every year, and most of them are fine. They’re just superstitious and old-fashioned. 

“Dude, I’m sorry," Jeremy said.

“Yeah... It’s fine," I said. The rest of the boat ride was awkward and uncomfortable. I could no longer enjoy the pleasant view with the thought of losing my phone in the murky river depths at the forefront of my mind. I made sure to call my parents using Jeremy's phone so they wouldn't worry. Or at least worry less.

After returning home from the unfortunate trip four days later, that's when things started becoming out of the ordinary. I immediately talked to my parents about my phone, reverting back to my fearful ways. There was a comfort in this. 

But when I told them, my mother said something strange in reply.

“Oh, well, that's weird. We just got some texts from you."

“Hmm? When?"

“As soon as you arrived."

My heart dropped. How was that possible? Had someone scooped my phone up from the river and stolen it? The tour guide, he must have gotten it right after we left. No, that was silly. I sounded just like my parents.

“What did it say?"

“It was just a picture." That thought gave me chills. I hesitated.

“Of what?" My mother flipped her phone screen around to face me. A murky brown image. It was definitely underwater. I gulped. What the hell?

“H-how is that possible?" My mother shook her head.

“I’m not sure. Maybe it glitched and took a picture when you dropped it."

“But, I dropped it four days ago. The phone should be dead by now and suffering from water damage. And this picture was taken with the flash on! I don't even have the flash on usually!"

It was then I heard the doorbell ring. I hesitantly waltzed over to the door. There stood Jeremy.

“Dude, something weird is going on," he said. 

“Don’t tell me you've been getting texts from my phone."

“Uh yeah, how'd you know?"

“My mom got one too." I was shivering.

“What was it?" I asked.

“I don't know. It didn't make much sense. It’s all jumbled up and gibberish. It looks almost like a drunk text."

“Let me see." He handed me his phone.

“sn syv Eeda" I was dumbfounded. It looked like a text that would be sent if someone was just randomly hitting letters on the phone.

“I don't understand, how is this possible? My phone is at the bottom of a river."

“Do you think somehow somebody got it? Dude, what about the tour guide? Maybe the reason he didn't want to dive in was so he could go retrieve it later. I mean, come on, that dude has to know how to dive."

“But that still wouldn't explain the strange texts."

“OK, maybe he dove in to retrieve the phone, right? And when he was coming up to the surface, he accidentally took a picture while unlocking the phone. You were taking a picture in the messaging app to send to your mom, right?"

“That’s right, I was."

“Exactly, so he could have opened it and mistakenly taken a picture."

“OK, that's possible, I guess. But then what about the weird message to you?"

“Well, I mean, come on, the phone has water damage, that's a fact. So I’m sure it's been hard to use, probably has a mind of its own. Maybe that text was unintentional too." My mom interjected.

“I think he's right." She said, pointing at Jeremy. “I think we should call the police." 

So that's what we did, that same day we reported my phone missing and that we had a possible lead on who stole it. But nothing came out of it, the tour guide was searched and they found nothing. We then asked the police if someone could dive in and retrieve my phone. They told us nearly the same thing the tour guide had. That the water was too dangerous to dive in. They said we'd need to wait till they could find the proper machinery and tools to do so, but not to get our hopes up. I’m sure they had more pressing matters than a lost phone.

The following day, another text went through. This time it was my dad who received it.

"uj NSjo" What did these mean? I was beginning to think my phone was being haunted by a CAPTCHA generator. None of this made any sense. I stared and stared at the strange message, contemplating its meaning, when something hit me. The strange correlation I had made in my head with the CAPTCHAs gave me a revelation. CAPTCHAs are randomly generated. This led me to the idea of anagrams. I’d been obsessed with anagrams and codes as a kid, so I decided to put these to the test, dreading what I may find.

I found a website that solved anagrams but none of the words stuck out to me, so I opted for one that solved for multiple words. I hit enter. I scanned the screen through multiple nonsensical pairs of made-up words when I saw one that stood out like a sore thumb.

“Seven days." My heart stopped. That was the one, it had to be. It was the only one that made any sense remotely. But what did that mean? Seven days to what? I wasn't sure I wanted to find out.

Already on edge from the first find, I hesitantly entered the second mystery message. This list of possibilities was even shorter. Have you ever experienced being so scared that all the hairs on your neck stand up and tears well in your eyes? That’s what I faced when I discovered the only phrase that made sense out of this collection.

“Join us." I jolted backwards from my computer. This was becoming too much. I tried to calm myself down and convince myself it was just a coincidence. I decided I didn't need to be alone at a time like this, so I powered off my laptop and headed for the living room. I longed for the comfort my parents provided me in unknown situations.

When I walked out of my door, I saw something odd. My mother was standing in the corner, her phone pressed hard to her ear as if she was desperate to hear. I could see she breathed heavily as she muttered something to whoever was on the other end.

“Uh, Mom?" She didn't react. “Mom, who are you talking to?" I said, as I drew closer. Her shoulders widened and her posture fixed.

“Oh, it's nothing, honey! Just something for the PTA."

“Why are you standing in the corner?"

“Oh, well, the service is best right here, don't you think?" she said with a grin.

Unblinking, without turning my back towards her, I crept backwards into the kitchen. I jolted as someone grabbed me from behind. 

I then watched my mother run through the house and out of the front door. 

“It’s okay, Michael," my father said from behind me. His grip tightened on me; I was unable to free myself. He pushed me towards the open door. It was broad daylight; surely someone would see this. Someone would stop them. My father moved with a quick pace, like he was in a hurry. I tried to yell, but he clamped his hand upon my mouth. My dad was a strong man, but this felt different. It was like his primal instincts were kicking in.

I scanned for any neighbors out, hoping somebody would be outside tending to their lawn and see me. But it was to no avail. My mother swung open the back door of the family car and pushed me inside. Then my father slammed the door shut behind me, before hopping into the driver’s seat. Frantically, I tried to open the door, but my father locked it before I had a chance.

He peeled out of the driveway at an unreasonable speed, knocking down several trash cans, taking off down the road. 

“Please, what's going on?! Why are you doing this?!"

My parents said nothing; they just stared straight ahead and grinned. Deep down, I knew where they were headed. I took this very route not too long ago. Only at the speed they were going, they'd get there much quicker than I. My father raced through the pavement, running through red lights and stop signs. I hoped and prayed a cop would try to pull us over, but none did. It was as if they'd all taken the day off.

We drew nearer. I dreaded it. I feared what awaited me. What had been calling out to me from the depths. I did not care to face it. There it was, now just within view, was that dreadful river where it all began.

I darted my eyes around, searching for an exit. The river drew nearer. In my parents’ possessed state of hurry, they didn't tie me up. Maybe they thought they didn't need to. But I took advantage of that. With a huge bump, the vehicle rolled into the grassy bank on the river. I had to do something. Using the bump as momentum, I lunged into the front seat and grabbed the steering wheel. I veered it to the right towards a set of trees.

My father’s strength was caught off guard by my quick maneuver. He tried to set the vehicle back on its intended course, but it was too late. We came crashing into the trees. Right as we did, I noticed something. In the water was another car, sinking. I recognized those bumper stickers. 

Jeremy.

A large gash formed on my head from the collision. My head spun as I reached for the car's locking mechanism. I pushed the driver’s side door open and jumped over my father. He sat unconscious in the driver’s seat. My mother grabbed at my feet, yanking at me, trying to pull me back. I trudged forward, both of my shoes flying off. I rolled out the car onto the grassy floor. Without looking back, I ran in the opposite direction. I expected my parents to be chasing me. Because of this, I was extremely hesitant to turn around. When I finally did, I was surprised and horrified to see that they weren't chasing me. 

They were sinking into the river.

I walked onwards back home for several hours as night fell. Finally reaching my home, where the front door still remained wide open, i slammed it shut behind me. I looked at the clock in the kitchen, noticing it was now after midnight. A loud knock at the door drew my attention, and then a sudden realization came upon me.

It was now seven days after I dropped my phone into the river.
