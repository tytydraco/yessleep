*I'm scared.*

But writing keeps me calm.



I've been hearing voices in my head since I was 6, voices that always told me what I should do, like *'put your leg out and trip that man'*, or *'the driver isn't good, he's going to get into a car crash soon'*, and I've always complained to my parents about it. So when I was 7, my mother brought me to a doctor, or at least that's what she called it. But I think they had another name for those doctors... *psychiatrists*, I think.

The nice lady ran some tests, asked me some questions, but it took really long.

I didn't know much at that time. I couldn't understand anything. I only listened to my mother when she told me to wait outside the room while she had a little chat with the doctor. She came back out awhile later with an envelope in her hands. I never asked about it.

I was afraid there would be something wrong with me. I always asked, *"Mommy, is there something wrong with me?"* And my mom would always smile and shake her head, assuring me that everything was fine.

I was a really cheerful girl, with a decent number of friends growing up. Despite the voices, I've never really let it bother me. I've learnt to shut it out over the years. My mother said I was perfectly normal, and I believed her. *After all, my mother has always been right.*



I'm 13 now, but the voices never left. In fact, they sounded angrier, *as if they didn't like being ignored.*

Earlier today, my parents left for a vacation to Los Angeles. I told them I'd be fine alone for a week.

I had invited my best friend of 3 years over for a sleepover, with my parents' permission of course, and the promise that we wouldn't cause any trouble. (Let's call her Amy)

Amy suggested that we watch a horror movie, since it was her favourite genre. I'm not really a fan of horror, but seeing her so eager, I couldn't bring myself to say no.

I'll admit, the movie scared me to death. By the time it ended, Amy told me that I looked like I'd just seen a ghost. I laughed it off, though honestly, I know I'm a scaredy cat. *But is it really my fault..?* The voices get louder when I watched anything horror related, which was why I avoided them as best as I could.



At 11pm, she suggested that we play a game her parents had taught her. Though... I'm not sure if parents should be teaching their kids these kinds of stuffs.

*Charlie Charlie.*

I don't know why I agreed. Perhaps it was due to the adrenaline from the movie.

But for those of you who don't know how it works, you basically draw a cross on a piece of paper, and label the 4 boxes: yes, no, no, yes. Then put a pencil along one line and balance the other pencil above the first one along the other line so they form a cross. To start the game, you have to ask, *'Charlie Charlie, are you there?'* and if the top pencil spins and points to yes, you can go on to ask your question, whatever you want.

We shut off all the lights and closed the windows to prevent any wind from getting in.

We asked twice before we got a response.

We were having so much fun, not really thinking much about anything else. We asked stupid questions and laughed at every reply.



*But when we ended the game, we forgot to say goodbye.*

  
And I don't know if that mattered.



That night, I woke up at 2am. The voice in my head said, *"Someone's watching."*

I look around the dark room. The moonlight streaming in from the window casted weird shadows on the walls, making the atmosphere even more unsettling.

I turned over and shook Amy, waking her up.

She stirred, groaning in frustration, opening her mouth, probably to ask why I was waking her up at 2am. But before she could get a word out, I heard it. *A soft thud. Then another.* Coming from the corridor. I refused to admit it, but they sounded like footsteps.

I whipped my head towards the doorway. I couldn't make out anything in the dark. *Was someone in the house?*

The voice came again. *"Go check it out."*

I had never once listened to the voice in my head, but this time, *I did.*

I looked back at Amy, who was staring at me like I had grown a second head. *"What?"*

*"Did you not hear that?"*

*"Hear what..? Why'd you wake me up at... freaking 2 in the morning??"*

Should I tell her and freak her out too? Or go check it out myself, in case I really was an idiot being paranoid at every little sound. I chose the latter.

*"I'll go check something out, just wait in here."*



I grabbed my phone, in case I needed to make an emergency call or use the flashlight, before padding towards the doorway, leaving a puzzled Amy in bed.

I forgot how long it took me to clear the whole house. But thankfully, not a single soul in sight.



I climbed back up the stairs, preparing to head back to bed. *But what I saw at the doorway froze me in my tracks.*

A doll. No, not the kind that kids hug to bed every night. This one... 7 feet tall..? Maybe even taller. It has no face, just a smooth surface made of... fabric..? It looked like fabric. It had long black hair touching the floor, arms and legs, but no fingers or toes. Just rounded limbs like a puppet. It was wearing a worn out dusty blue dress with what looked like burnt holes.

God knows how long I was staring at this thing, and what snapped me out of my shocked state was a voice. *Amy's voice.* Except...



*It was coming from the doll.*



*"What's taking you so long..?"* It spoke.

I didn't reply.

It said a few other things, but I didn't process any of them. All I could hear was the rapid pounding of my heart in my ears.

And then it started walking towards me.

*I turned and ran.*

*I didn't look back.*



It called my name. But this time, it didn't sound like Amy. It was low-pitched, almost a growl. *And it sounded angry.*



I didn't want to fumble with the keys to get out, so I hid in the storeroom beside the kitchen where it couldn't see me.

It was still calling my name. And it was getting closer.



*"Just stab it in the head. It's the weakest area."* The voice in my head spoke again.

For once, I sat there and thought about it. It sounded doable. I was shaking like a leaf at the thought, but it was worth a shot.

So for the second time in my life, *I listened to the voice in my head.*



I peeped out from the storeroom. The doll was still walking around the house, looking for me, calling my name. It was only about time before it finds me.

*"Stop hiding... What's wrong?"* It spoke again.



I took a deep breath, trying to calm myself down and stop trembling. Before I knew it, I was sprinting to the kitchen, towards the drawer where my parents kept all the knives. I pulled it open, picking up the first blade I saw.



When I turned back around, the doll was staring at me. Just standing there, watching. *As if in shock.*

I didn't think. I just acted. I could still remember the adrenaline rush as I charged towards the doll at full speed, *plunging the knife straight into its head.*

I didn't know if it screamed, because all I could see was the crimson red blood that I was now covered in.

I screamed, pulling out the knife, watching as the now lifeless body of the doll collapse into a heap of fabric on the ground.

*But... it wasn't bleeding. Not a single drop of blood on it.*



I almost broke down at what I had just experienced. I forced back my tears, running back upstairs. Amy was still in bed, waiting for me.

*Or that was what I thought.*



I reached the doorway, catching my breath. "Amy-" I choked out.

*The bed was empty.*

*Where did she go?*



A horrible thought flashed through my mind. *Had that doll... taken her..? Was that why it had her voice at the beginning?*

I blink away the wetness in my eyes, running back downstairs.

But I wasn't prepared for the sight that greeted me.



I expected to see the doll on the ground, but the doll was nowhere to be seen. What laid in its place was...



*Amy.*



Her body lifeless, *with a pool of crimson red blood around her head.*



I stood there and stared at the scene for what felt like hours, before quietly walking over to pick up my phone which had dropped in the storeroom. 

And now.. I'm here in my parent's bedroom, still covered in blood. *Amy's blood.*



I've been in here since 4am. It's daytime now.



But I found something. The envelope my mom brought out of the doctor's room when I was 7.

Now I know what's inside. *I know what's wrong with me.*

My diagnosis letter.



*Suspected schizophrenia.*

*Come back for another checkup after monitoring for six months.*



That was what my mother never told me.





Perhaps she didn't want me to feel different from others, she thought that it would take my cheerfulness away. I had always been fine, right..? My mother never took me to visit the nice lady a second time... and now... there's a body downstairs. Not just anyone's body, but my best friend's.



*And I was the one who killed her.*



But now, one noticeable thing has changed. My head feels quieter, calmer, *like the voice is gone.*

And honestly? I hope it never comes back. Because if not for it, I wouldn't have done what I did.



There's a dead body in my house and I don't know what to do.

*I'm scared.*
