I slowly pulled into the driveway of my friend Jack. We had planned to meet up that day, but I was running a little late.

I gently knocked on his front door, and he slowly opened it as he looked down at me.

He was tall, but it also didn’t help that I was pretty short; he stared at me as I’d just said something insane.

“Why did you come back so quickly? I thought you said you had to go back to your apartment?”

Now I was confused. I was late because of work — I knew I hadn’t come here earlier. “Are you okay, Jack? I just left work. I know I’m late, but not that late.”

Jack’s face twisted as if he were trying to rewind his own memories. It looked like he was genuinely trying to convince himself of what he thought he’d seen.

Eventually, he forced a hesitant smile. “Guess I was lonelier than I thought. I’m glad you’re here though — I already set the games up.”

I laughed and followed him inside. We started playing, and I beat him in almost every game… but the whole time, something felt off. He kept glancing at me like he was comparing me to something else.

I don’t know what made him think I’d been there earlier, but whatever he thought he saw, it must’ve felt real to him. Jack doesn’t imagine things — not like that.

Eventually, it got late, and I had to head home.

I walked up the staircase to my apartment and took out my keys. When I went to unlock the door, the slightest touch pushed it wide open.

My whole body locked up. I could almost hear my parents’ voices from childhood — the door is always locked when you leave. I never forgot that. Not once.

With a shaky hand, I flipped on the light.

At first, everything looked normal. I actually felt myself exhale and stepped inside… and that’s when the wrongness hit me.

Everything in the apartment was moved by just a few inches. Barely noticeable — unless you knew the room as I did.

I bumped my shin on the coffee table, hard, and I knew it hadn’t been there earlier.

I searched every inch of the apartment. Every closet, under the bed, even behind the refrigerator. Nobody was there. Nothing was missing. Nothing was broken.

Someone had been inside just to move things.

I locked the door and curled up in my blankets, trying to calm down with cat videos, but I didn’t sleep at all.

At daybreak, I grabbed my wallet and drove to the nearest store. I bought as many cheap cameras as I could afford and set them up in every corner of the room, even above the front door.

It should’ve helped. It didn’t. I still didn’t feel safe, so I spent what money I had left renting a cheap hotel room for the night.

I checked in, locked the door three times, crawled into the bed, and opened the cameras on my phone.

Hours passed. Nothing happened.

Then my apartment door handle twitched. Slowly. Then turned. The door eased open, and a woman stepped inside — short brown hair, a jacket a size too big for her.

I switched to another camera angle to see her face.

My blood ran cold.

She had my face. Or something wearing my face. Every detail. Even the way she carried her shoulders, the way she scanned a room. It was me.

Then she turned directly toward one of the cameras and waved.

Her mouth moved slowly, like she wanted me to take my time reading it.

“I can see where you are.”

My hands shook so badly I dropped my phone onto the bed and yanked the blanket up over me.

I just need sleep, I told myself. If I sleep, I’ll stop freaking out. It’ll make sense tomorrow.

I lowered the blanket just enough to grab my phone again. My breathing was shaking so hard I could hear it. She wasn’t on the cameras anymore. Not on any of them.

Then I heard the tapping on the hotel window.

Soft. Rhythmic.

Exactly how I tap when I’m distracted.

“Let me in, Susie… I’ve been looking for you for so long.”

I couldn’t see her through the blinds, but I felt her presence. I covered my mouth and breathed as quietly as I could.

“Pretending you can’t hear me, Susie? That’s mean. I thought we could meet each other properly. Maybe even help each other… the way you wish you could’ve helped your sister.”

My stomach twisted. Nobody knew about that. I’d never told Jack, never told anyone. Only my parents knew about the accident, and they never talked about it.

“H-How do you know about her?” My voice came out small and shaking.

Soft giggling came from behind the blinds. “I know because you know, Susie. I know how much you loved her. And I know how much it hurts.”

The tapping sped up, sharp enough to feel like it was drilling into my skull.

“It wasn’t your fault,” she continued, almost gently. “But you never stopped thinking it was, did you?”

“I didn’t— I wasn’t— I didn’t mean—”

My voice cracked, and I pressed my fist against my mouth.

The tapping stopped. Silence.

Then—

A slam.

I spun toward the hotel door just in time to see it swing inward.

She stood in the doorway — me, but smiling too wide, like her face didn’t know how to be human.

She rushed at me, grabbed a handful of my hair, and slammed my head backward against the wall. Pain exploded across my skull, and hot blood slid down the side of my face. I screamed and swung blindly, hitting her ribs hard enough to knock her over.

I fell on top of her and scratched at her face. I saw a smear of red appear beneath her left eye, and she shrieked and thrashed. She grabbed my wrist and bit down. I tried to pull away, but her grip was impossibly strong.

She flipped me over and squeezed her hands around my throat. My nails raked at her arms, her face, anything I could reach, but the room started spinning. My vision narrowed.

Everything went black.

When I woke up, sunlight was leaking through the blinds.

My head throbbed, and everything felt foggy. Last night came back in pieces, scattered and blurry, but real. I know it was real.

There was a bite mark on my arm and my neck still felt sore.

I don’t know why she stopped. I don’t know why she left me alive.

But I’m still me.

And I’m still terrified.
