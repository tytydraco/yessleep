You must understand. 

Four years ago, when Moses came into my prison cell, the scales were dropped from my eyes and I was chosen. He called me to be God and gave me magic. I used it to alter the world that coexisted around me. I was made of other stuff. I was not slinging crystal while I was inside prison so my mind was clear. But the responsibility became too great. When I got out I started crushing rock again. I lost some of my magic but not all, and the doctors told me there wasn’t any magic. But I could see the orbs of power that they claimed gave them presidency and I manipulated the light so that it turned their truths into lies and I could keep using. I had to keep using. I started living under the bridge so that I could avoid the cosmic beings that were giving me so much responsibility. They wanted me to run for president so I could help the children of the world not get raped by the pedophiles, which is just an anagram for politicians. 

It was just me, Bryan, and Will underneath that bridge. Together we’d go out on speed runs so we’d always have a bit to use. I would rub ferns into our sores and needle pricks to prevent infection. We lived in houses of our own making. It made us brothers.

One night, they came for us in vans.

I tried to call for the cosmic beings to stand barrier to the violence, but they never arrived. They pulled us out of our sleeping bags and pushed us into the back of their vehicles. I could see their auras around them, and it was like lightning made of darkness. I manipulated the energy to turn them good, but they must have had a rival wizard because just as soon as I’d make their visages glow with pure silver light, and beg for them to let us go, it would flip back to black, and at some point they yelled “shut him the fuck up” and I felt one of them poke my neck and I floated away into some dark place that Moses prepared for my protection. Moses has always been there to protect me.

The doctors say I see things. I saw those vans. I saw those people. I didn’t see them. I *SAW* them.

I woke up again, and I was on a table. I could see the auras of those around me, and there must have been a legion stuffed into that room with me. It was hot. I was sweating. I was naked, and then the men in white coats arrived. I spoke of many things to them. I told them about the cosmic joining, of how I was to have intercourse with Gaia, and that my seed would sprout children that would end world hunger, and her holy universal orgasm would bring peace to all the earth. Then we would all have sex in the orgy that followed, and then we would truly all be of one love. I spoke so fast I almost bit my own tongue off. They put a rag into my mouth. I tried to speak around it, but I started to choke on the cloth that was soaked in blood and spit. They numbed my body, but I was awake. They took knives and cut me. They took needles and injected me. I tried so hard. I pulled against my restraints. I used my magic to move their orbs, but there were stronger beings pulling the puppets strings of those men in white coats. They put metal on my bones and devices into my organs. I think they wanted to read how I worked, to discover my innermost mystery. They took my testicles, my penis. They made me into a fucking ken doll.

Then they sewed my mouth shut.

Once they were done cutting and sewing and making me into what they wished, they put me alone in a room. They started showing me videos. Pictures that were not related flashing one by one until my brain saw the knowledge of the world in them. The cosmic beings finally came, and they told me not to believe. It was lies, they were lying to me. The men in coats came in and tried to get me to kill a rabbit. When I didn’t, they injected me with LSD, or I think it was LSD. I did it sometimes with crystal and it was similar. I still didn’t kill the rabbit. I had promised Moses I wouldn’t. I would not give into the violence of this world. I couldn’t give into the violence of this world. They beat me with sticks when I wouldn’t. I told myself that these are the things that Christ must suffer, and so I suffered them. Three times they cut me open and put new things in me. Each time, I would not kill the rabbit. Sometimes they brought Bryan and Will in and showed me how they would kill the rabbit. My friends now had no eyebrows, no hair. I could see that the dark beings at the center of the earth had made them into coats, had hollowed them out and taken control of their bodies like a second skin. They told me to kill the rabbit, and I still wouldn’t. I didn’t want to. I had promised.

When the stick beatings didn’t work, and the imposters that were no longer Bryan and Will couldn’t convince me of their lies, they injected me and I fell into that dark place prepared by Moses.

I awoke in a pile of hollowed out shells. Bodies bleeding and twisted. Some I recognized as others who had lived under the bridge. Others were alien to me, as if they were from another planet. The cosmic beings told me they were. A man in a white coat pulled a lever and dumped us all into the ocean. He must have not seen me moving.

I hit the water and I swam. I learned to swim as a child. I swam until I made it to shore.

There were gaping wounds on my body where they had taken out some of the devices. I hadn’t used in weeks, so my body was weaker, but my mind was clear. I was alive, and I had seen the men in the vans. I had seen them take my friends. I needed to tell someone. The cosmic beings were telling me not to, but I needed to. I removed the stitches that kept my lips together. I couldn’t go to the hospital. They would see my wounds and just give me pills. I tried to go to the police, but the devices that they implanted in the concrete at the station had synchronized frequencies with the devices the men in white coats had left inside of me. I could not enter, not without screaming.

I could not go back to the bridge. I had promised Moses. I had lost Bryan and Will.

So I went home.

Clint, I am leaving this phone underneath the tree where we used to hide our secret record. This is a new secret record. The cosmic beings are using their mind powers to hold my tongue but my thumbs are still mine. You won’t find me. I need to keep going. 

I am posting this to warn the world. I have seen the men in the vans. I have seen their cuttings and devices. They are taking up people in the streets. I did not *SEE* them. I have *SAW* and *SEEN* them. With my eyes, my real eyes.
