As I wrote down this story, I had chills running down my spine, and tears welled up in my eyes. Just thinking about it brought me back to those sleepless nights. I wish I could embellish the story, maybe add some explanation that would soothe my mind. But I won’t do that. I cant; I want to share it with you as it is.

But okay, let’s start from the beginning.

The story is quite recent, as it happened just a year ago. My friend Sam (that’s not her real name— it would be hard to pronounce, but also because I don’t want her to come across this post) and I have known each other since middle school. We always chose the same elective classes, shared a lot of similar interests, studied at a similar level, and even got similar results on our school-leaving exams. Looking at it, it’s no surprise that sooner or later, we found ourselves signing up for the same university. We didn’t manage to find a place to live together, despite our best efforts. Anyway, we survived our first year of university. There were plenty of parties, lots of drinking, and a lot of crying over textbooks during our first exam session, but there were also tears of joy when we managed to pass the year with excellent grades. We even had a good chance of getting a scholarship.

That gave us the idea—why not go on a student exchange for one semester? Not only would the university cover some of our expenses, but we’d also get extra funds for our academic achievements. We decided to apply, and, well, we got in! Before we knew it, we were signing papers with the foreign university, packing our suitcases, and buying plane tickets. We opted for a dormitory since it was the cheapest option, and, well, we didn’t really need a fancy apartment for just one semester.

The cheapest option was a double room with its own bathroom but a shared kitchen with another double room. We didn’t mind. We’d known each other for so long, and we’d stayed over at each other’s houses plenty of times. Sure, one night at a friend's house is different from living together for an extended period, but I didn’t give it much thought. Those were potential problems for future me. I didn’t expect, however, that they would haunt me to this day.

I remember the day we arrived at our new room. We inspected every inch of the place and somewhat unpacked our suitcases before lying down on our beds, a little tired from the trip. Our beds were side by side, separated by a low partition wall. The wall had holes that served as shelves, and you could see the other person through them. Sam said something to me then, something I didn’t take seriously at the time.

"I guess I should warn you," she began. Though there was a hint of amusement in her voice, she sounded surprisingly serious. "Remember when I told you during our first sleepover that I sometimes talk in my sleep?"

"I remember. I think you even ordered a burger that night," I laughed at the memory, and so did Sam.

"Well, the situation has gotten a bit worse. Sometimes I sleepwalk now, especially when I’m stressed."

"Uh, but you’re not going to try and walk out into the hallway or jump out the window or anything, right?"

"I don’t know. A few times, I ended up in my parents’ room, or once I even went outside completely naked, and it was snowing! Thank God our yard is fenced, and no neighbor saw me."

"Should I wake you up if it happens? I read somewhere that you’re not supposed to wake a sleepwalker," I asked, a little more concerned.

Sam told me that it was usually difficult for anyone to wake her up from sleepwalking. It had happened a few times, though, and she didn’t react negatively, so she suggested I call her name a few times first. If that didn’t work, I could nudge her a bit. The atmosphere got a little eerie, so I decided to make a joke to lighten the mood.

"Don’t worry. If you try to run naked through the dorm, I’ll make sure to capture it on camera," I teased.

She let out an indignant gasp, which quickly turned into laughter.

At that moment I didn't know what awaited me.

It was during the first week of our adventure at the new university when Sam first spoke to me in the middle of the night. The creaking of the bed woke me up. Through the shelves in the partition wall, I saw that my friend was sitting upright on her bed. She wasn’t moving, just staring ahead at nothing in particular. The weak light from a streetlamp illuminated our room through the blinds. I watched her curiously for a moment, but a chill ran down my spine when she turned her face toward me. Her eyes were half-closed, looking in my direction but not really seeing me. It was as if I were invisible. And then, she said two words: "Golden hourglass."

It amused me a little. I decided to see if she would respond to me.

"Yes, Sam, we can go to the store tomorrow and buy one if you want," I said.

She then lay her head back down on the pillow, and I think she muttered a curse under her breath, which made me laugh even more.

The next morning, I told her about the whole thing. She seemed a bit embarrassed and apologized for waking me up, but ultimately, we laughed about it over breakfast.

"Sometimes I can be rude and swear a lot when I’m in that… trance," she admitted.

"Just like any other day," I shrugged.

"Oh, fuck you!" she playfully punched my arm, and I dramatically massaged the ‘hurt’ spot.

That same week, Sam talked in her sleep two more times. One time, she seemed to be trying to buy airplane tickets, as far as I could tell from her mumbling. Another time, she just said, "Tag," giggled, and went back to sleep.

By the fourth incident, it wasn’t so funny anymore, although I still wasn’t too worried about my friend's nightly antics. This time, Sam woke me up, not by shifting in bed, but by shouting: "Look there!"

I jumped up immediately and looked at her. She was pointing at the ceiling. I asked her what she saw.

"A hole. A black hole. Something… something’s watching us."

I wasn’t sure what scared me more: a) she was seeing something that wasn’t there; b) we were, according to her, being watched; or c) it was something, not someone, watching us.

"Sam, there’s nothing there. Please, either wake up or go back to sleep."

"Okay," she answered briefly and went back to sleep. I, on the other hand, had a hard time falling asleep again, to put it mildly. The next morning, I asked if she remembered anything from the night before, but she didn’t. She did say she had a strange dream, though she couldn’t remember what it was, just that it was weird.

Incidents like these happened more frequently, especially as the workload for our classes piled up, along with the number of projects and essays to prepare. It became a stressful time, and we had to give up going out and traveling for a while.

The first time I jumped in fear and wanted to hide under the blanket was when Sam got out of her bed. She left her bed to stand directly in front of mine! She stood by the wall, right across from me, looking at me the same way she always did—as if I were invisible.

“Sam…” I called out, “Sam!” I shouted louder and then repeated it several more times, but nothing could wake her. She just stood there, staring straight ahead (at me). I was so paralyzed and too scared to go over and poke her. I finally mustered the strength to move, but as soon as I made a bigger motion, Sam returned to her bed. I didn’t sleep at all that night; I spent the rest of it scrolling through my phone until the sun came up. I also decided not to tell my friend about it—I didn’t want to trigger the guilt she would feel every time I mentioned her nighttime antics. Sam often talked in her sleep, and I had somewhat gotten used to it. Sometimes, I didn’t even wake up anymore. It was the feeling of being watched that usually woke me.

The first time Sam disappeared from our room, and I only woke up after the fact, was in mid-November. I started looking for her, terrified that she might hurt herself. Honestly, even if she were sleepwalking naked, in this moment, it wouldn't seem as funny as it did when we joked about it. I first checked the kitchen, then the bathroom. She wasn’t there. I peeked into the hallway and went to the stairwell, but she wasn’t there either. Our room was on the first floor (though, by first floor, I mean there was another level beneath us that was the ground floor, with nothing but the stairwell entrance and stairs leading to the basement where the laundry was). Above us, there were two more floors. I quickly ran upstairs to check if she was in the corridors, but I didn’t find anyone. I went back to our room, terrified and anxious, unsure of what to do. Then I saw her. I noticed, through the half-lowered blinds, that she was standing in the middle of the courtyard, staring up at our windows. My heart stopped. Tears welled up in my eyes. It was one of the scariest experiences of my life. But I couldn’t give in to the fear—this was still my friend that needed help. I rushed downstairs and immediately tried to wake her. When I shook her by the shoulders, she suddenly tried to extend her hand in front of her, which made me step back. She pointed to our windows.

“I don’t want to be there,” she said, and I burst into tears. I don’t know what possessed me to ask:

“Why?”

I didn’t like her answer.

“It’s always watching.”

I didn’t see anything in the windows. That didn’t comfort me, though. Sam woke up shortly after, confused and clueless about where she was or what had happened, and started apologizing.

“You don’t remember anything? Not at all?” I asked with a hint of hope.

“I had a dream… I was running away from someone. I feel like I keep having the same dream over and over, but I never remember exactly what’s happening,” she admitted. I felt somewhat relieved, thinking it was just a nightmare manifesting in her actions. Not something… else.

“You don’t remember who you were running from? Nothing?” I pressed, maybe not because I wanted more details but because I wanted to delay going back to our room for as long as possible.

“It might sound silly, but I feel like whoever I’m running from is masked. But with each dream, their face slowly starts to show.”

“And what will happen when you finally see it?” I asked.

“I have no idea.”

When we returned to the room, we turned on all the lights. We planned to stay up playing games until morning because neither of us wanted to sleep. However, Sam lost to exhaustion and fell asleep around 5 a.m. I couldn’t.

Around noon, after we’d both caught up on sleep, I decided to ask her a few things.

“Hey, Sam, have you had these sleepwalking and hallucination episodes before?”

“Yeah, but they’ve never been this intense. Maybe it’s the change of environment…”

“And have you ever tried to do something about it? Have you seen a doctor?”

She thought for a moment.

“When I was little, I used to wake up screaming. My parents would rush in, panicked, saying I’d point at things that didn’t exist and ramble nonsense until I wore myself out and fell asleep again.”

“Did you see the same thing back then?”

“I’m sorry, I don’t know… I just remember the dream that triggered it was always the same. It made my head spin in the dream, then panic would rise inside me, which only got worse when I felt like someone was watching me, and then… poof, I’d wake up screaming.”

I listened, fascinated. I’d never been interested in dream psychology (?), nor had I ever believed in any meanings attached to dreams, but maybe in this situation, I should set my skepticism aside.

“Imagine trying to push a round object through a hole that’s too small, or watching an object slowly move further and further away until it’s so tiny that you shouldn’t be able to see it, but you still can, and then suddenly, without warning, it snaps back to its original size. You’re probably familiar with the feeling of falling in a dream. Now, combine all those sensations. That’s what I felt during that nightmare. Like nothing fit—like there was both too much and too little of something at the same time.”

“Did you go to a doctor?”

“Yeah, but they said it would pass, that it was just my age, and my parents should watch what I eat and watch before bed. And well, they were somewhat right. The nightmare didn’t bother me for several years after that. Occasionally, I’d talk in my sleep, but nothing like now.”

It began to dawn on me that nothing could be done about the situation, and I had to endure living with her for about two more months. She wasn’t on any medication, and there was no clear understanding of what was happening to her or what triggered these nightmares and hallucinations. It didn’t just happen during stressful situations, though they certainly acted as a catalyst.

“When we get back from the exchange, I’ll make an appointment with a doctor,” she told me, and I was glad she didn’t dismiss the matter.

At the beginning of December, I decided I needed to go home for the holidays early. Sam scared me so much one night that I had to hide in the kitchen.

It wasn’t that late—just past midnight. I was watching a movie on my laptop. Sam had her bedside lamp on, so I assumed she was still awake. She kept bumping her elbows and knees against the wall between our beds. Granted, the beds weren’t very big, and sometimes we’d hit the wall when turning over, but with Sam, it looked like she was doing it on purpose.

After a while, she called my name. I asked her what she wanted, but she didn’t answer—just repeated my name again. I put down my laptop and looked through the shelves. Sam was practically glued to the wall. It looked like some invisible force was pushing her further and further, so much so that three-quarters of the bed was empty. I even had trouble seeing her entirely from behind the wall. I hoped it was just some silly game of hers, or that maybe a board under the mattress had broken and she didn’t want to move for fear of making it worse. Hope, as they say, is a fool’s ally.

“Can I sleep in your bed?” Her voice trembled slightly. It was hard to tell if she was asleep or not.

“Why?”

She didn’t answer for a long time. The room was completely silent, and no sounds came from outside either. It was as if the world had stopped for a moment. Sam took a deep, shaky breath. She sounded scared. She had never shown such emotion when she talked in her sleep before. But again, I asked myself—was she even sleeping?

“Because… I don’t want to sleep with it,” she whispered, and chills ran down my spine.

“Maybe… maybe you could ask it to leave your bed?”

“It doesn’t want to.”

“Why not?”

“It can’t say.”

“Why?”

Another long pause. We both whispered as if we didn’t want it to hear us, though I saw nothing there. I clutched my blanket tightly. My heart was pounding so hard in my chest that at one point, it was the only sound I could hear as Sam pondered her answer.

“Because it doesn’t have a mouth,” she whimpered on the verge of tears, then started making choked sounds. I didn’t know if she was trying to say something or if she was in pain. Whatever was happening to her, it was painfully overwhelming. I’d had enough. My mental health was hanging by a thread, on the brink of a complete breakdown. I couldn’t remember the last time I had a peaceful night’s sleep. I was a wreck, struggling to function normally in the mornings. It was getting harder to concentrate in class. Every evening was filled with overthinking and the fear of what might happen. The fear of what would wake me up.

I threw my blanket over my shoulders and jumped out of bed, heading for the kitchen where I intended to lock myself away.

Before I distanced myself from Sam, I said, "You can sleep in my bed."

To my surprise, she reacted very aggressively. She started cursing at me, calling me a bitch, and hurling insults. I burst into tears because it didn’t sound like my Sam. Sure, she swore occasionally, and she'd even warned me about it before, but the amount of anger and hatred behind those words made it seem like I’d done something as horrible as killing her dog.

A moment later, the second door to the kitchen opened. Our two other roommates peeked out to ask what had happened, and when they saw me crying and on the verge of a nervous breakdown, they invited me into their room. I spent the night with them. We locked the door, just in case. I briefly explained what was going on between Sam and me. At that moment, we felt like we were living in our own horror movie.

The next morning, I bought a return ticket to my home country for the earliest available date. I lied to my professors, telling them I had to go back early due to a family member’s funeral. They seemed to understand, offering condolences and wishing me a happy holiday despite everything. I told my parents that the Christmas break started earlier in that country, and they didn’t question it. They were just happy I came home. I didn’t tell anyone what I had been through in the past months. All I wanted was to finally sleep in my own bed. It was an amazing feeling. After just one night, I felt much better—refreshed and relaxed. That break did wonders for me.

A few days before Christmas, I got a message from one of my roommates. It said:

"Since you left, Sam seems really stressed at night. Sometimes we hear her yelling something in the middle of the night. Last night, she knocked on our door. We didn’t open it and pretended to be asleep. She went back to her room and started shouting something again. We don’t know what to do. Should we report this to someone? We don’t feel safe with her around, even with the door locked."

Below the message was a voice recording. My roommate did her best to repeat the words Sam had been shouting when she returned to her room. After listening a few times, I figured out that Sam was probably repeating "shut up" over and over again.

I replied to the girls, saying I’d reach out to her family. Maybe they’d know how to handle this, though the chances were slim, considering Sam herself had no idea what was going on and how to stop it.

I decided to message her older brother. He had moved out of their family home a long time ago, and it had probably been years since they lived under the same roof, but from what Sam had told me, they were still very close. For the sake of this story, let’s call him Matt.

Here’s the transcript of our conversation:

Me: Hey, Matt. I’m a friend of Sam’s—don’t know if you remember me, we’ve only met a few times.

Matt: Oh hey! Yeah, I remember you. How’s it going? How’s the student exchange?

Me: Well, I’m actually writing to you about that.

Matt: I’ve never been on an exchange, so I doubt I’ll be much help.

Me: Umm, it’s more about Sam.

Matt: Oh, okay, what did she do this time? She’s alright, right? I just talked to her a couple of days ago.

Me: Physically, yes.

Matt: What do you mean?

Me: You know I live with her, right? In the same room. Sam’s had issues with sleep-talking since she was a kid, hasn’t she?

Matt: Ahh, that. As far as I know, she grew out of it. If she still talks in her sleep sometimes, you don’t need to worry! I know it can be creepy when it wakes you up in the middle of the night, but she usually just says a few random words and goes back to sleep.

Me: Well, it’s not exactly that… it’s gotten worse. She’s sleepwalking, seeing things that aren’t there, watching me sleep until I wake up, and worst of all, she keeps saying something is watching her too. Last night, she yelled at someone and scared our other roommates.

Matt: Oh… I didn’t know it had come back. That does sound disturbing, but I don’t know how I can help. As far as I know, it was never this intense, and she and our parents usually just shrugged it off.

Me: Is there any history of mental illness in your family? Sorry to be so blunt, but you need to understand my situation.

Matt: Yeah, I get it, and I really feel for you. I’ll talk to our parents about it and see if we can figure something out.

Me: Thanks, I appreciate it.

Our conversation ended there. Matt kept his promise because when I returned to the dorm after the New Year, Sam was gone. And I don’t mean she was just out of the room at that moment or hadn’t come back from the holiday break yet—half the room was completely empty. Her clothes were gone from the closet, her books, her laptop, her cosmetics—everything had disappeared.

I hadn’t messaged her during the break. I wanted to distance myself as much as possible from the situation that had affected us, which meant distancing myself from her too. I felt bad about it because she had been my close friend for a long time, but I needed to clear my own head. I hadn’t heard from her either, so I just stood in the middle of the room, completely bewildered, wondering what had happened to my roommate. She couldn’t have dropped out of school—not when we were at the end of the exchange program. We only had a month of exams left.

That’s when I heard a soft knock on the kitchen door. It was one of my other roommates. We exchanged greetings and small talk, then she said, "Sam asked me to tell you that she’s really sorry for leaving without any notice."

"Where is she now?"

"She said she’ll only come back for the exams and will stay in a hotel during that time."

My stomach churned with guilt. I felt like crying, thinking I was somehow responsible for ruining her experience of her first student exchange. That same day, I sent her a few messages, but she didn’t reply. Not that day, nor in the following weeks. The same happened when I tried reaching out to Matt—no response. This time, I couldn’t sleep for a completely different reason. I was worried about my friend.

After the exams, I went home. My adventure abroad was over. I didn’t tell anyone about what had happened with Sam—it seemed too personal. When she didn’t show up for classes at the start of the new semester, I decided to visit her home. Her mother informed me that Sam was now in a facility where she was receiving help, but didn’t go into details. She only mentioned that on her last night abroad, Sam had been running through the hotel lobby, screaming and rubbing her eyes as if she had seen something she desperately wanted to unsee. The security guard caught her before she could run out into the street. They called an ambulance, but the language barrier made it difficult for them to figure out what had really happened. Apparently, she fell asleep while being examined by the medic.

Many of our mutual friends asked me what had happened to Sam, but I dodged their questions every time. Days and weeks slowly passed, I had no contact with my friend, and the memories of the student exchange faded away. This story probably would have never come to light if it weren’t for what made me tell it.

Last night, I did something strange. My mom told me over breakfast that she heard some incoherent mumbling in the middle of the night. She walked into my room and saw me sitting up in bed, staring off into space. Apparently, I looked at her, giggled, said “tag, you’re it,” and then went back to sleep.
