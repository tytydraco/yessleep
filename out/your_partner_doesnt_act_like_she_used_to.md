You find yourself out in the woods with your girlfriend, Alice, and four other friends, Sarah, Jacob, Rasmus, and Fabian. It's 3:00 AM, and the pale moonlight barely illuminates the surroundings, but the six of you are having a good time. You're gathered around a campfire, sharing stories and laughter, feeling the warmth of the fire contrasted with the chilly night air.

Rasmus was telling a ghost story that you really hated, because it scared the shit out of you. it went like this "you know. these woods isnt really innocent. many people have reported missing people nearby. and this isnt even a part of the story. because its true. one man even reported his best friend acting super weird after she came back from being missing. and i really think we should be really careful out here" and he ends his story. you notices that everyone laughs at the story except you.  
  
The hours pass, and the mood is light, with no hint of what's to come. The laughter and chatter continue until Alice suddenly looks at one of the trees, her expression turning peculiar. She watches it with an intensity that sends shivers down your spine, and then, without warning, she runs into the dark forest.  
  
You and the others are left bewildered, exchanging shocked glances. You wonder what could have possessed her to dash into the wilderness, but none of you can offer an explanation. You contemplate searching for her, and as you turn toward your friends, they appear equally baffled and concerned.  
  
You decide to venture into the forest to find Alice. As you delve deeper into the woods, the atmosphere grows more ominous. The moon's feeble light struggles to penetrate the dense canopy, casting eerie shadows all around. The rustling leaves and distant hoots of owls add to your growing sense of unease.  
  
After some time, you stumble upon Alice standing in front of a massive, moss-covered stone. It's so dark that you can hardly see her. You place a hand on her shoulder, and a bone-chilling cold races down your arm. Her shoulder feels as cold as ice, and a moment of dread passes over you. As you turn her around, you realize that it's not truly Alice. Her appearance is the same, but something is fundamentally wrong. The unsettling feeling vanishes quickly, and she starts laughing, followed by the others.  
  
You all return to the campsite, convinced it was just a strange joke. As you make your way back towards the car, Alice suggests a "faster" route through a particularly pitch-black section of the woods. The idea is met with unanimous refusal, with you being the first to object. Her response is a resentful, icy stare. During the car ride back home, an unsettling feeling lingers in the air. you feel like you got her angry by not taking her way. because shes now ignoring you. but you dont really care.  
  
Rasmus drops you off first, offering comforting words. " hey man. dont worry about it." he says " this is just a stupid joke as usual. and you have nothing to fear! alright? " he finishes. you answere whit a smile. and hugs him. you exit the car, but before you can close the door, Alice grabs your shoulder and whispers, "Hey, see you later," sending a chill down your spine. you close the door. and Weeks pass, and Alice refuses to speak to you since the incident in the woods. You're not bothered by it; in fact, you're relieved to avoid the woods altogether.  
  
  
However, it becomes apparent that something is not right with your friends. they all had refused going back to that forest whit alice for a while. but some days ago, alice sent out invitations to everyone except you. to follow her back into the woods. your just happy that you didnt have to follow. but the strangest thing is what happened when your friends came back. They've all been acting strangely ever since that camping trip back whit alice, and they relentlessly try to persuade you to return to the forest with them for another camping excursion. Their insistence unnerves you, but you steadfastly decline their invitations.  
  
As days turn into weeks, you begin to feel a sense of foreboding. You're certain that one day, you will be forced to return to those sinister woods, whether you like it or not. Your apprehension grows as you contemplate the eerie events that transpired during your last visit. You can't shake the feeling that an inexplicable malevolence lurks in those woods, waiting for your return.  
  
You often lay awake at night, plagued by the memory of Alice's peculiar behavior and the unspoken dread that shrouded the forest that night. You wonder if she and your friends have become mere vessels for some unknown force that now compels them to return to the woods. What secrets do those dark woods hold, and why do they insist on taking you back there?  
  
As the days turn into months, you continue to resist their invitations, knowing that a sinister destiny awaits you in the forest. You begin to research the area and stumble upon unsettling stories of disappearances, strange occurrences, and eerie legends tied to those woods. It's as though the forest itself has a malevolent consciousness, and it's calling for you, its reluctant guest.

as time flies by. you notice how it gets more and more frantic by everytime. someday they will notice that your just ignoring their requests. and you know deep inside that someday you must follow them. and when that day comes, it will be your last. your going to die in that forest.
