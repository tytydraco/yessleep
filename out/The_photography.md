It was late at night when my brother called me. His voice was tense, which was already a sign that something was wrong. "What's up?" I asked, worried. He began talking about his son, Lucas, who had been wandering around the house at night for weeks. That in itself was strange, but what was worse was that he frequently whispered things into the empty air.

At first, my brother thought it was just a kid thing. Maybe an imaginary friend or something like that. But Lucas wasn’t the kind of kid who had imaginary friends, and his behavior was starting to get more disturbing. He avoided looking his parents in the eyes, and whenever they asked him about it, he always responded with a simple "nothing." His evasive tone made my brother increasingly suspicious.

One night, while Lucas was wandering through the house, my brother decided to quietly follow him. He saw Lucas standing in the hallway, staring at the blank white wall, whispering inaudible things. As he tried to understand what his son was saying, he realized that the words made no sense. They were disconnected sounds, almost like an unknown language. Fear gripped him, but he didn’t know what to do.

The next day, when I visited them, my brother told me everything. I tried to calm him down, saying that maybe Lucas was just going through a strange phase, something that would pass soon. I decided to try to get closer to Lucas, to see if he would tell me anything. After all, he’d always been very attached to me. And if something was wrong, he’d probably tell me.

I spent the afternoon playing with Lucas. He seemed normal, laughed at my jokes, and told me about school, but I noticed a certain distance in his gaze. It was as if he was there with me, but his mind was somewhere else. I thought maybe he was just tired, but that feeling of unease didn’t leave me. Before leaving, I decided to take a picture of him to show my girlfriend, who always thought Lucas was adorable.

I took several photos; Lucas posed and laughed, and for a moment, I really believed he was okay. That night, I showed the photos to my girlfriend. She smiled as she looked at the first ones, but when she reached the last one, her smile disappeared. "Who’s that person?" she asked, looking at me with a mix of confusion and fear. I laughed, thinking it was a joke. "Person? He was alone."

She then showed me the photo, and my heart froze. Next to Lucas, there was a shadowy figure, almost indistinct but clearly there. It looked like a shadow but with an almost human shape. There was no way it could be just a normal shadow, not with that kind of clarity. I couldn’t understand it; no one was there when I took the picture. I stared at the image for several minutes, trying to find a logical explanation, but nothing made sense.

Fear began to spread through my body, a feeling that something was terribly wrong. I immediately called my brother, but he didn’t answer. I sent him a message, asking him to call me as soon as he could, but his response took a while. Meanwhile, my mind was racing, trying to process what that image meant.

When my brother finally called back, I was somewhat desperate. I told him about the photo, and at first, he thought it was just an illusion or a glitch in the image. "It could be just a camera malfunction; it happens," he said, trying to reassure me. But I knew it wasn’t that. There was something in Lucas's expression in the photo, something I hadn’t noticed before: a slight smile, as if he knew that figure was there.

That night, I couldn’t sleep. I kept looking at the photo over and over, trying to decipher what that figure was. It seemed to have a face, but it was distorted, as if it wasn’t entirely human. Something told me that this wasn’t just an image but a real presence. I started to wonder if Lucas had seen this figure before and if that was what he was whispering about at night.

I decided that the next day, I would go to my brother’s house and show him the photo in person. I wanted to see his reaction and maybe even Lucas’s. But when I got there, something was different. The house seemed darker, as if the presence of that figure had permeated the place. My brother was pale, and Lucas was quieter than ever. It seemed like everyone there knew something I didn’t.

I showed the photo to my brother, and his expression immediately changed. He stayed silent for a long time, just staring at the image. When he finally spoke, his voice was trembling. "This… this isn’t possible," he said. I asked him what he meant by that, but he couldn’t articulate a clear answer. He just kept repeating that it couldn’t be real.

Lucas, who was nearby, looked at the photo and, to my surprise, didn’t seem scared. In fact, he looked at me and said, with the most natural tone in the world, "That’s my friend." My heart raced. "Your friend?" I asked, trying to stay calm. Lucas nodded, still with that strange smile. "He comes to see me at night. He said he’s going to take me to a better place."

My brother panicked and started yelling at Lucas, begging him to stop saying those things. But Lucas kept smiling as if he knew something we didn’t. I didn’t know what to do; it was all too surreal. I decided we needed help, someone who could explain what was happening. But who? And how could we explain this to someone else?

In the following days, Lucas became even more distant. He stopped talking to his parents and started spending more time alone in his room. My brother began to lose control, desperately trying to get some explanation from his son, but Lucas remained silent. The tension in the house was palpable, as if something terrible was about to happen.

I continued visiting, trying to be there, but the feeling of helplessness was overwhelming. One night, while I was there, I heard Lucas talking to himself in his room. I approached the door, trying to hear what he was saying, and what I heard made my blood run cold. "I’m ready. I’m ready to go with you." I quickly entered the room, but Lucas was alone, sitting on the bed, staring at the window.

When I asked him who he was talking to, he just smiled and said, "He said it’s almost time." I didn’t know how to react to that, and my brother was on the verge of a breakdown. We decided it might be best to take Lucas to a psychologist, someone who could understand what was happening in his mind. But something told me this wasn’t just psychological.

The night before the appointment, I got a desperate call from my brother. He was screaming, saying that Lucas had disappeared. I rushed to their house as fast as I could and found my brother collapsed on the living room floor. "He’s gone… He’s gone with him," he kept repeating, crying uncontrollably. I asked him what had happened, but he couldn’t explain.

We searched the entire house, the yard, every place Lucas could have been, but he was nowhere to be found. The window in his room was open, and the cold night wind was blowing in, but there was no sign of Lucas. We called the police, but I knew deep down they wouldn’t find anything. Lucas was gone, taken by that figure, that "friend" only he could see.

The following days were a blur of search and despair. My brother could barely eat or sleep, consumed by guilt and fear. The police investigated, but there were no clues, no logical explanation for Lucas’s disappearance. The only things left were the photos I had taken and the image of that shadowy figure that still haunts me to this day.

The photo was shown to the investigators, but none of them could explain what that figure was. Some said it was just a shadow, an illusion, but I knew the truth. That was real. It was a malevolent presence that had taken Lucas from us. And the worst part was knowing that Lucas was ready to go, that he had accepted it as inevitable.

My brother never fully recovered. He blames himself every day, reliving that moment when Lucas looked at the photo and said that was his "friend." I, on the other hand, try to move on, but that image doesn’t let me rest. I can’t help but look at the photo from time to time, hoping to see something that will help me understand, but all I see is the same horror that terrified me that first night.

And sometimes, when the house is silent and night falls, I think I hear Lucas's voice asking for help.
