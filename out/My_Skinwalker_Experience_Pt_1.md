My day started off pretty normal. At 06:30 my alarm woke me up and I proceeded with my normal routine such as: I showered, brushed my teeth and threw my hiking gear on. I'm a pretty avid hiker, wouldn't say very experienced but I know what I'm doing, so I go every weekend when I can. Around 07:30 that was when I were ready to drive to my chosen hiking route (Basalt Mountain, Colorado), this was about a 3hr drive from where I live so I was pretty exhausted by time I got there after being up so early. 

The hike started off great, sun was beaming down on me and I could hear all the birds singing and all the critters running around in the forests. Along my route that I chose, there was gorgeous views and amazing scenery so I stopped whenever I could to take in the views and just live in the moment. A few times I stopped to make my self a coffee and to take some stunning photos for my partner back home in the UK, however, by time I got to the top I realised it was getting dark. This is when I realised I was walking back in the dark. This is were it started to get creepy.

On my way back down I had the sharp feeling on the back of my head. Like someone was watching me. I chose to ignore it and carried on walking. The thing is though, the more I walked and the darker it got, the feeling kept getting more intense. In an act to distract my self I whistled the tune to my favourite song, this is when I could hear someone walk behind me in the distance, but not too far to not hear them. Too far to see them though. I kept glancing behind me and kept seeing nothing, looked to my left and right and still nothing. As I kept on walking I could still hear it following me and that sharp feeling of being watched was getting unbearable.

About 40 minutes has passed since setting off back down and I didn't notice whatever was following has been slowly getting closer. I realised this when I looked behind me, about the 100th time, and this time I saw a deer. This wasn't a normal deer either. This deer looked like if it was dead, but somehow still alive. It had red glowing eyes locked right onto me, its skin all patchy and some of it hanging off too. Bones where sticking out off its limbs and chest, blood also dripping from its mouth. It just wasn't natural. By time it sunk in to what I was looking it at it started walking to me at a fast pace. That ain't normal either I thought. Then it hit me. I'm gunna die if I don't run. I flung my body around and started sprinting for my life, with every ounce of energy I had. That's when I heard it. That shrill scream from behind. Sounded half human, half cayote. The human half sounded like a death scream. It sent chills down my spine and my shit into my pants. 

Foot steps where getting faster and closer behind me, but I kept on pushing. My legs where burning and my lungs screaming. I wanted to quit. That's when it was close enough I could hear it grunting, I was shitting my self.
