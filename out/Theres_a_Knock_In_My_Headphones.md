I haven't slept in 2 days. I can't. I haven't been able to get rid of it. I need help. Any help. 

It started a week ago. My job at the factory is boring. So unbelievably boring. But it has its benefits. It's easy work, I won't say it's terribly important but it's easy. And I don't get interrupted often. So I listen to music. Or audiobooks. Or anything really. Just something you pass the monotony of the day until the end of my shift. My old headphones, reliable as they were, finally gave out on me. So I finally bit the bullet on a new pair. It's where the issues started.

I did my usual that day. Clocked in, sat down along a long production line, put the headphones on, and fiddled the day away. About 2 hours into my shift I heard the faintest knocking sound. I don't how long it had been there. It must have blended in with the music but I couldn't unhear it now. I paused the music but the knocking persisted. "Must be something wrong with one of the machine belts" I thought as I took the headphones off.  But the sound disappeared. 

I looked around carefully and listened but outside the quiet hum of the machines it was silent. Until the headphones went back on. Then a gentle distant knocking continued. I tried to turn up the music and to my surprise, the knocking didn't get any louder. I shook it off as a weird quirk of the headphones and got back to work. The rest of my day was like every other. 

The next day at work started just the same and just as yesterday my headphones started to knock.  Only this time, it was louder. It wasn't loud per say but even at louder volumes it could still be heard just barely under the blaring tones of my music. At lunch I asked a coworker from a different building if she could help me. She was in charge of some of the maintenance at the factory and I figured if I could get a quick answer, she would find it. 

"Hey, Brianne, you got a second? I have a tech question."

Brianne gave me a half smile. "You're lucky you don't bug me often or I'm going to charge you next time. What's up?"

I took my headphones off from around my neck. I got these 2 days ago. New model. There's an odd knocking sound that doesn't seem related to the volume, any thoughts?"

She took them from me. "Couldn't be a normal problem could it?" She took the headphones for a beat and listened. "How often is it happening?"

"All the time" 

She handed them back. "Well then I fixed it because it's not there now" 

"Really? Thank yo-" I stopped as the headphones went back on. "Very funny. It's still there."

She snatched them back and put them on " Dude I'm telling you it's not there. Now I'm going to eat my food. Here, take them back but I'm not messing with you, it's silent when I listen."

I go back to lunch and try and listen to an audio book but that knocking really disrupts the flow of things. So off they stay for the rest of the day. I get off work and go to the store where I bought them. I politely ask for a replacement pair and although the clerk didn't hear an issue either, he didn't see anything wrong with the return. He stowed the pair I had and handed me a sealed box and I went on my way. I opened them at home and put them on..... And the knock returned. It grew louder than earlier and had a new feeling behind it. One of urgency. I threw the headphones off and dug in my drawers. I found an old pair of ear buds. It's the kind that frays internally after a while and unless you play Cat's Cradle with the cord, never plays out of both ears. But I needed something else. 

And that's when I heard it again. Knocking. Knocking. Endless, God damn, knocking. And a voice. Soft. Child like. As quiet as the knocking when it first started. And only four words. 

"Can I come in?" 

I threw the buds across the room and they lied there. Inanimate and uncaring and I caught my breath. It was ridiculous right? How could a voice call to me from there? I checked my phone and had no one on a call. I walked to the door and no one was there. Probably some girl who got the houses mixed up and left. But I wouldn't pick up the ear buds and head phones again. I went to sleep. I dreamt of little things. I was a hero for a brief moment. A student forgetting a test the next. And then, I stood in front of a door way. 

It was an older door. It didn't feel ancient and not even necessarily out of place or time but it was worn. Paint chipped at its edges, the hinge was rusted in places but it looked solid in construction and a beautiful shade of red. On the other side, a knock. Steady, rhythmic, growing ever louder. The door appeared to grow more near despite my feet feeling glued to the floor in this space, like the floor was contracting beneath me. 

My hand moved. I watched it leave my side and drift towards the door in a motion I did not command. The knocking continued, louder and louder. It was deafening. My hand touched the door and I heard the voice.

"Stop." The voice said. The same small, young, feminine voice as before. "I'm not alone." 

I awoke in a start, sweat covering my body. It was only 1:35 in the morning. I could feel my heart racing, beating in my ears. Only, it wasn't my heart. It was the knocking. 

Knock. 

Knock.

Knock. 

I couldn't sleep the rest of the night. It was all I could do to drown out the incessant knocking. Fortunately it was Saturday and I didn't have to explain this to my coworkers but I didn't know what to do. I couldn't find a source. I tore clocks off the wall. I turned off every electronic. I ripped up floorboards praying this was some perverse Edgar Allen Poe joke but it didn't matter. Whether I was at home. Whether I was outside. Whether I had something in my ears or not the knocking persisted. 

"PLEASE STOP KNOCKING! I begged to no one and cradled my head in my hands trying desperately to block the noise from within. And I heard it again.

"Can I come in?" 

She sounded clearer than last time, closer. And scared. I closed my eyes and I took a breath "If I say yes, do you stop knocking?"

"Yes I promise." 

"You can come in." And almost before the last word left my mouth I was met with blissful deafening silence. I cried. Tears of joy that my mind was mine again. Never again would I complain about the peace of quiet. 

"Thank you" 

Dread filled my body all at once at the voice that was not mine. Her voice filled my mind, like the voice that reads out your thoughts had changed. It was still sweet and young, there was no malice in it. But it didn't belong there. 

"Why?" I asked "Why can I still here you?"

"Because you let me in. You let me leave that place."

"What place? What are you talking about?"

"The place beyond the door."

And it started again. Far too soon it started again. That fucking knocking. 

"No. NO! YOU said you would STOP THIS! WHY DO YOU KEEP KNOCKING?"

Her voice was subdued. Terrified. "I'm not."

"I told you I wasn't alone."

Knock. 

Knock. 

Knock. 

"You can't open the door again."

Knock. 

Knock. 

Knock. 

"No matter how long. No matter how loud."

Knock. 

Knock.

Knock. 

"You can't answer him."

Knock. 

Knock. 

Knock. 

A voice I hadn't heard before came in from a distance away. From a direction I could not trace. From every direction and from no where. It was confident. It was curious. It held a weight, even while quiet, like malice manifest. I felt it smile behind its breath as it spoke.

"Can I come in?"
