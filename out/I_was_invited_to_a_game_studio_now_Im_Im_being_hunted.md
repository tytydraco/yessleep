I was invited to the makers of Dead By Daylight Studio, and now I’m on the run for knowing something about the game I’m not supposed to know.  I  arrived to Behavior Studios due to being invited for a tour. We were given one rule, don’t leave the group under any circumstance. Curiosity got the best of me and the second the tour guide turned her back I snuck down a corridor and decided to walk as quiet as possible until I found a door leading to stairs. I quietly open the door and decide to head downstairs to what I can only assume to be their basement.

 I get down and enter the basement only to be introduced to the wretched smell of death. I slowly walk and see cells aligned in one of the hallways almost like a hall of prison cells. I continue walking and see a giant room with gurneys, and test tubes with some sort of liquid. I can’t believe my eyes when I’m one of the gurneys is the trapper from the game, and some doctors seeming to patch an injury up from his own trap. I hide before anyone can see me confused and unsure if I even believe what I saw. I hear commotion back towards the prison cells and make my way that way.  I see some para-military people dragging people down the hall and shoving them into cells.  I go down a third corridor and see a giant theatre size screen monitoring security cameras. I see a giant area blocked off with walls that looks like the map Coldwind Farms with 4 very real people, running from a very real Trickster. This all but confirms what I thought I witnessed in the lab, they are kidnapping people and making their own sick real life version off the game. The security cams change to another map, just as The Wraith “moris” a person before cloaking. That’s not possible, they aren’t turning people into these killers, they are creating these killers out of thin air.  I hear people running in my direction and I hear shouting. 


“He’s in here!” I hear one of the doctors from earlier shout. 


I duck and start to run towards the stairwell. I hear gunfire behind me one bullet grazing my arm as I get to the stairwell. 


“Stop!” I hear what looks to be the one in charge of the handful of security guards firing at me. 


I bust through the door and charge up the stairs. I come running out of the stairwell shoving the tour guide over as I realize the tour must just be ending.  The tour guide falls over and trips one of the security guards who unintentionally fired his gun at another one of the people invited for the tour. I rush out to my car speeding off faster than I have before. For anyone who plays Dead By daylight, like I use to. It’s not just a game, it’s a distraction for a very deadly experiment they are working on.
