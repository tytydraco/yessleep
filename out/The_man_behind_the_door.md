It started with the knocking.

Three soft taps on my bedroom door, always at 3:17 a.m. Not 3:15. Not 3:20. Always 3:17. I live alone.

The first night, I thought I was dreaming. The second, I told myself it was the wind or a neighbor. By the third, I stayed up, phone clutched in my hand, eyes locked on the door.

3:17.

Knock. Knock. Knock.

I didn’t move. Didn’t breathe. Just stared. The door didn’t open. Nothing came in. But the knocking was real. My heart thudded against my ribs like it wanted out of my chest.

I tried to catch it on video the next night. Sat there in the dark with my phone camera aimed at the door. 3:17 came. Three soft knocks. When I checked the footage the next morning, I could see the door, the time stamp… but no sound. Nothing.

I posted about it on a small paranormal forum. One reply stood out: “Don’t open the door. No matter what you hear.”

I never said anything about opening it.

The next night, it wasn’t just knocking.

A voice. Raspy, like it had swallowed smoke. “Let me in.”

I froze.

Again, 3:17. Again, three knocks. Again: “Let me in.”

I didn’t. I couldn’t. I pushed my dresser in front of the door the next day, heart hammering as I waited for nightfall.

That night, 3:17 came.

No knocks.

Instead: a whisper, right by my ear. “That won’t stop me.”

I screamed and turned the light on. Room was empty. Door still closed. Dresser unmoved.

I barely slept after that. The voice didn’t come every night, but when it did, it said things only I should know. Secrets I’d buried. Regrets I never voiced aloud.

One night, I finally screamed back. “What do you WANT?”

There was silence.

Then: “You left the door open. Once. That was enough.”

My blood went cold. I hadn’t. I never leave that door open at night. But one night… weeks ago… I’d stumbled in drunk from a party. Fell asleep before closing it. Just once.

That night, 3:17 came.

No knock.

No voice.

Just the sound of the door handle turning—slowly, deliberately.

I ran. Out of the room, out of the apartment. Didn’t stop until I was sitting in my car, shaking.

I’ve been sleeping in motels ever since. Different towns, different beds, never the same place two nights in a row.

But last night, 3:17 a.m., the motel door rattled. Three soft knocks.

This morning, scrawled on the bathroom mirror in condensation:

“I found you.”

I don’t know what to do or what this thing is.

I need your help! Im lost and don’t know how to get this to stop. Has this happened to anyone else?

Im losing my mind and I haven’t slept. Im begging for yalls help. Im writing this in a public place where theres people around so there can be witnesses to whatever happens but at the same time I don’t fully trust those around me.
