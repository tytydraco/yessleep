She never goes away and it is getting worse

I have always been a little different. Quite a loner if I’m being honest. I always preferred doing things myself. Ever since I could walk. Nobody ever really liked me. My classmates always thought I was the weird kid.  But that’s not the point of the story. See things have gotten very weird. A few years ago I met the love of my life. It was right before COVID hit and ruined everything. Me and this girl did everything together. I was around her all the time and we were inseparable. Every night I would go to her house. She wasn’t very liked either. People thought she was a weird person. I will never think that no matter what happened. 

One night on October 28th 2021 I was waiting for her to pick me up. Once I got to her house something felt different. I ignored it and we ended up falling asleep on her bed. About an hour later I awoken to her getting out of bed and we’ll things went down from there. She died. For the next few weeks her death would replay in my head over and over. Then it stopped. But it gets worse. It started small. She would be in my bed with me sometimes or she would be standing in my room. Never speaking. Then she started talking to me. She followed me everywhere I went. We would have conversations back and forth like we always did. But it got worse. My mind has always been a little weird. I always had a feeling as if someone was watching me. As if everybody was out to get me. But this is different. She started telling me how much everybody hated me and how everybody wished I was dead. She would watch me suffer and tell me that somebody was going to kill me. 

One day I screamed at her to leave me alone. She told me she would kill me when she seen me again. Now I’m terrified. I have seen her a few times. So now I do not feel safe. I moved to a new place made all new social media. The people around me think I’m crazy but I know what I saw. They all say she’s dead but I know she’s somehow haunting me. This has been going on for a year now. I’m going to so many doctors and therapists over all this but it never gets any better. 

But ever since I moved she’s been gone. Well that was until last week. I had just gotten a new piercing because I cope by getting things like piercings and stuff like that. Right before that I had a doctors appointment. When I went to go get my piercing something felt off. Once I was finished I got back into my car. Until I felt like someone was watching me. Looking around me car and finding nothing wasn’t a big shock to me. I felt the need to drive by her house and I was going to see how her mom was doing. I think that may have been the biggest mistake of my life. 

I drove by her neighborhood twice but wouldn’t go in it. When I finally build up the courage I saw something. Standing on the lawn was my girlfriend. But this was different. Her hair was thin and looked like a lot had fallen out, her body was super thin, her skin was so awfully pale, her hands were so thin and her fingers were longer, on those hands her nails were sharp, and her eyes. Oh her eyes were black. I drove my car away as fast as I could but now I can’t sleep for the fear that she is after me once again. I’ve moved so she doesn’t know where I am but what if she finds me?
