Nature can kiss my ass, I thought angrily. My face must have displayed the subtitles because Abbi immediately asked, “Why are you so sour today?” I mentally raised a middle finger to the tree line skirting the far bank of our campsite. I’d had just about enough of this mosquito-infested camping trip that my two best friends insisted on. Don’t get me wrong, the trip was fun, but my tolerance for nature had run out within the first week. Why on earth they insisted on camping for two weeks—at a site right on the river—was beyond me. Didn’t they realize mosquitoes breed in water? To make matters worse, we were surrounded by happy campers. Ah, the joys of living in the wilderness.





“Cheer up, Kay, it’s your last night,” Abbi continued with a grin. I rolled my eyes in response. I wanted to be a *hikikomori* already. But that luxury would have to wait for at least another 24 hours.





“Oh, I know what will lift her mood,” Jayce chimed in. His cheeky grin and deep dimples never failed to send a tingle down my spine. “I saved this beauty just in case.” Winking at Abbi and me, he produced the biggest joint I’d ever seen. I was pretty sure its size could have floored Snoop Dogg himself. “Tonight’s going up in smoke, girls.”





Well, Jayce’s bribe certainly proved effective. We smoked one joint, then another. The day melted into evening, and my mood lifted considerably. Heck, I could live in our campsite for another two weeks if Jayce kept producing these green delights. By the time the constellations graced the night sky, the munchies had kicked in full force. A few failed attempts at making a campfire later, we were enjoying the fruits of our labor in the form of s’mores. There’s just something about melted marshmallows that hits that sweet craving just right. By the time I was on my third s’more, the herb-induced haze had already faded.





Jayce fed the fire with more logs, sending a shower of sparks flying into the night sky. The wood crackled and hissed as the last bits of moisture escaped from the doomed branches. My eyes wandered to the tree line, only visible as a dark void in the black night.





“Did you hear that?” Abbi asked. I was too lost in thought to pay attention to the sounds of nature.





“Hear what, Abs?” Jayce asked while I cocked my head sideways at her.





“It sounded like a cat,” she responded, her eyes darting to and fro as if they could pierce the darkness beyond the campfire’s light.





“There it is again!” she shouted, leaping to her feet excitedly.





“Abs, you already have five cats. You can’t rescue every cat in distress,” I grumbled. Abbi pouted, and I could see her mind was made up. She was going to look for this feline in need.





“Are you sure you’re not imagi—” but Jayce’s words were cut short by a shrill meow. It sounded like the cat was close to camp.





“Oh, all right, let’s go look for it,” he said, resigned to his fate as bodyguard and cat-catcher.





“I’ll feed the fire,” I volunteered. I had no desire to venture into the darkness. Besides, I didn’t like cats. They were moody and unpredictable.





Another shrill meow spurred the pair into action. Armed with flashlights and their cell phones, they disappeared into the dark.





The meowing intensified for a few moments, then all was silent. I could see the beams of light from Abbi and Jayce’s flashlights as they searched for the animal. I was so focused on what those two idiots were doing that I didn’t notice the meowing growing ever more distant—and that they were wandering farther away from camp. By the time their flashlights dwindled down to two little pinpricks, the deafening silence finally registered in my brain. It was as if the dark had turned into a massive soundproof room, sucking up all the sounds of nature and leaving an uneasy nothing in its wake.





Just as I moved to place another log on the fire, a small, tinny-sounding meow broke the silence.





If the cat was near camp, then where had Abbi and Jayce wandered off to?





Another meow sounded, closer this time. Looks like I was going to be the unsuspecting hero in Abbi’s feline-saving tale after all. Then a thought came to mind—if I caught the cat, I could persuade them to leave camp tonight. The cat would need food, and I was sure we didn’t have any. I didn’t know much about cats, but I knew feeding them s’mores was a bad idea. The thought of going home early energized me.





“All right, kitty, I’m coming for you,” I said in a low voice.





“All right, kitty,” the night echoed back.





The warbled sound sent a chill down my spine.





I shook my head and silently blamed Jayce. He must have gotten some bad green, I thought.





“…kitty,” echoed through the night.





The sound turned my skin to ice. I spun around, instantly angry. Jayce and Abbi must be playing some sick joke. Serves me right for being a sourpuss earlier, I suppose. Forcing a laugh, I raised my hands in defeat, “OK, guys, you’ve got me. You can cut the crap now.”





Silence.





“Seriously, guys,” my heart thudded in my ears, “you’ve got me good.”





Still more silence. Then a snap behind me. I spun around in the circle of dim light our campfire provided. Blood drained from my face as my eyes rested on two growing beams of light. My world shattered when Abbi’s disappointed voice carried through the night, transfixing me. “It’s no use,” she said, “the cat’s gone.”





“Cat’s gone,” repeated an oddly distorted voice behind me. Sweat pooled at the small of my back, and I smelled the sour stench of my own fear. With difficulty, as if I were a mannequin come to life, I turned around, fearing what I would see, but fearing what I wouldn’t see even more.





My eyes met and locked onto two intensely black pupils. In the distance, Abbi and Jayce’s voices grew louder, but their warmth did not reach me. Those eyes, dimly lit and framed by pale, loose skin, drew me in. Again the voice repeated, “Cat gone,” sending razor blades of pain into my ears. I was rooted in place. My mind screamed that I should run, scream, do anything, but my body would not obey. All I could do was watch. Then all turned black as its gaping maw grew ever wider…





Something was shaking me, but I was not ready to wake yet. The shaking was insistent, though, and I forced my eyes awake. Abbi’s annoyed face swam into view. “Jeez, Kay, you could have put a few logs on the fire before dozing off, you know.” Jayce was next to her, stifling a grin. “It’s probably the smokes from earlier. Made her conk out. Don’t be too harsh on her. You know Kay’s a lightweight when it comes to this stuff,” he said, as he took a long drag from a newly lit joint before offering it to me. “This night’s going up in smoke, remember,” he said.





“Remember,” I replied, my voice thick and slow with sleep.





“Don’t give her that,” Abbi reprimanded, “she’s already so out of it she can’t speak properly.”





“Can speak properly,” I retorted sluggishly. Replying was more difficult than I anticipated. Forming full sentences felt nearly impossible. It was so hard to think. I felt drained, and a gnawing feeling in my middle was infuriating. What was it?





“Hungry?” Jayce asked. “Want a s’more?”





“Are you daft!” Abbi yelled, her shrill voice sending needles into my brain and eyes. “Don’t you see how pale she is? She needs real food. Not sweets. I told you not to bring those damn things along, but you never listen, do you!” Abbi was full-on mad now. Her anger rolled in hot waves off of her.





“Oh, come on! It’s not the first time she’s smoked with us! You really can’t blame me for how sick she looks. It’s probably greenies.” This offhand comment from Jayce sent Abbi’s temper skyrocketing, igniting a full-on argument between the two.





Food. Now that was a compelling thought. Saliva pooled in my mouth at the idea. Food. Yes. That’s what I needed. But not s’mores. No, I needed something more… sustaining. But the noise these two were making… the noise was painful. If only the noise could stop. Who should I eat first, I idly wondered. Abbi looked like she would still the pain in my middle for a few hours…





Wait… what the hell am I thinking!? Ah, yes, I was thinking of food… food to stop this gnawing feeling in my middle. My gaze settled on Jayce. It would be best to deal with him first; he looked like he could put up a fight. I could always have fun later hunting Abbi down.





My jaw silently unhinged, and I got to my feet with surprising speed. I was on Jayce in a second; his skin became my own ten seconds later. All the while, Abbi stood there transfixed. The sheer horror of my actions had left her a statue. The hunger was quieter now, and I was able to think a bit better. Gazing at my arms, I saw the loose folds of skin.





“Is this my skin?” I asked to nobody in particular. The hollowness of my voice failed to register in my ears. “I don’t like it.” My gaze fell on Abbi. Abbi had nice skin. I could wear hers for a while. Hunger pangs flared up in my abdomen, and my decision was made.
