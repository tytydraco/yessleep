Does anyone know about this weird plague that broke out in the Old West? I've tried reading up on it, but the history books don't mention anything.

Uncle Ray loved his Spaghetti Westerns. Loved anything to do with the Old West. In fact, he was buried with a VHS of The Good, The Bad and The Ugly.

So when I found that my inheritance consisted of two hundred books on cowboys and the American Frontier, I wasn't surprised. What did pique my interest however was something slipped into the sleeve of one of the books. 

It was a journal entry. I'm not an expert, but it looks old and, the way it reads, might be genuine. But it's tough to say. 

I worry because it describes an Old West that I didn't think existed.

Here's the journal entry. Maybe someone can tell me if it's genuine.

Walker McCoy was the measure of how stubborn the dead could be. He was buried at twenty-two feet in some nowhere prairie just outside of Greer County on October 4th 1867. Two days later, a group of Indians found his severed arm—identifiable only by a trashy signet ring. That limb had been scrambling amongst the brush, squeezing the guts out the ass and mouth of a field mouse. We hadn't a clue where the rest of Walker had gotten to, but that crook’s arm went back into the ground at thirty feet the very next day.

That's why you should never ride idly if you happen upon the double crosses. We do as good a job as we can, given the circumstances. But there's only so far down a shovel can go. And the dead are getting mighty restless lately.

On a sunny day, the flattened tin cans pinned to the sidewalks flash like a trout. Still, no amount of metal on the ground could make Mangum shine. It was a beat-up town pulled this way and that until its arms swung loose from their sockets. It was neither here nor there. Wasn't ours or theirs. A place secured only by a promise.

Wyatt sat outside the post office, whistling a broken tune and watching Nellie Rose brush down her mare. My brother always had a song in him when that girl was around. Like all the other guys in town. Such a shame she'd never look his way. Just as well, Wyatt'd been digging graves for so long he'd taken on the form of a tombstone. He was a pale, lumbering slab of a man that cast the darkest of shadows.

“Eyes back in your head,” I said, slapping him on the shoulder with the roll of posters I’d picked up. “Nellie Rose doesn’t want a man so acquainted with the dead.”

“Dutch, I was just”—he cleared his throat and pushed a hand through his sweat-slick hair—“admiring her horse, that’s all.”

I grunted, then hitched up a seat next to him. 
“Are those all the Second Timers?” Wyatt said, nodding at the posters. He lit up a smoke, took a long drag, then blew out a big, obnoxious cloud up into the sky. 

I frowned at him in silence until he stubbed the bastard out and apologised. “Yep. These are them.”

“Looks like a lot. How many?”

“Twelve.”

Wyatt looked at me. “Twelve?”

“Yep.”

He blew out a sigh, then relit his smoke. “Surprised we ain’t had people demanding their money back.”

I grunted again. I swiped the cigarette from his hand, took a drag of my own, then passed it back. “I guess that’s why we round them back up.”

He nodded absently. His gaze fell back on the girl. “Still no sign of Walker?”

“Nope. But if he was on Indian land we’d know by now.”

“Is that good news?”

I shrugged, stood up and squinted down the high street. I watched passers-by mill about in the dust clouds kicked up by the horses and carts. The murmuring of midday crowds and the rattle of shoes on the tin-pressed sidewalks. The men slumped in chairs outside the saloon bar with empty bottles pinched in their hands. 

The smell of scorched earth and sweat. It was a scent that never quite left a Mangum resident. Even if they’d laid plenty of distance and time between them and the town. Some folk called it a souvenir; most called it a curse. Though, with the way things were lately, I think too many people carelessly throw that word around. I mean, it was just a town. A nowhere place full of nowhere people; all stooped and wild eyed beneath the unforgiving sun. 

Shit, I know Mangum wasn’t much, but it was home. And I’d sooner ride into hell than see my town overrun by either Indians or the dead.

“Anyways, let’s go,” I said, helping Wyatt up to his feet.

He brushed off some dirt on his trousers, pulled out his gun, inspected the chambers then holstered it again. “Where are we headed first?”

“Same place as always,” I said, “where the holes are.”

***

We’d buried Hattie Sinclair last winter at twenty four feet. The poor girl was fifteen when she hit the dirt. Her back was bent out of shape after a fall from a horse. Mr Sinclair needed extra convincing to lay his daughter to rest. He wanted to hold out until the Spring. The ground’s a little hungrier then and doesn’t tend to spit people back up. But everyone knows a body doesn’t keep long under the Mangum sun. 

At the time, I thought we’d put enough mud down. But it turned out that Hattie had gotten a bit itchy a couple of weeks back and was now stalking cattle down by the Salt Fork. 

That’s why Wyatt and I rode out so close to the double crosses. We owed Hattie’s daddy an apology.

We followed the Salt Fork most of the way, every now and then sweeping the valley for anything strange. But the land was still. All that moved was the Salt Fork which trembled beneath the sun. Its ragged clay bluffs burning red like a wound. The land was silent, except a couple of crows that cawed mockingly from overhead.

After a couple of hours, we found what we were looking for.

“Blood everywhere,” Wyatt said, bringing his horse to a trot and swiping the flies from his face. His shirt was already clinging wetly to his back. 

“Our girl must be close,” I said, nodding at the pried open ribcage of a cow. 

Its innards were now just a vicious red smear across the dirt. Squinting against the sun, I could see the cow’s spine beyond a small thicket. I almost mistook it for a snake basking in the sand. A little further on, an undiscernible lump of meat that I assumed to be the creature’s head. Then, where the dust met the sky, an old barn house loomed. It appeared to be held up with the trees growing through it.

I looked to Wyatt who was circling the disembowelled cow. He cocked his head, then blew out a sharp whistle. I pulled my horse up alongside him to see what had caught his eye.

As soon as I saw it, my hands went slack on the reigns and an oily fear churned about in my guts. 
“Fuck! Fuck!” 

Curled up inside the carcass of that cow was a fresh body. A child. A small bundle of bones draped in lumps of drooling meat and ragged strips of skin. Indian skin. And in that poor boy’s contorted mouth was the other dismembered hand of our friend, Mr McCoy. Wrist-deep to the teeth, fingers still scratching at the back of the kid’s skull. Walker’s crook brand still visible on the grey meat of his forearm.

I wheeled my horse round. “Bag him up and find somewhere to bury him. I’ll get the girl.” Then, I set off at a gallop towards the barn, hoping that we hadn’t completely fucked the whole town.

*Walker. That stubborn bastard. Why wouldn’t he just stay dead?*

***

The barn was no longer what I’d call a building. If it wasn’t for the roof and the branches of a nearby tree, I’d doubt the walls would stand at all. 

Long ago, someone had once painted the wooden panels in red. Since then, seasons had come and gone. Now, the paint had blistered into rosettes of sun-starched pink. Each peaked through the lattice of vines that wrapped their way around the barn’s exterior. It was almost beautiful.

Two large doors were barricaded by a long plank of wood. Though that didn’t matter as a large hole yawned open down the left flank of the structure revealing a room crowded with shadows.

I ducked my head to get a better look inside and noticed a crimson streak snaking along the floor. I checked my gun was loaded and used the barrel to tear away a dusty curtain of cobwebs, then entered the building.

Death was on the air. Heavy and sickly sweet. I scanned the room to see wooden crates and tool blades rusted into bubbled orange. A wooden ladder rose up into the hayloft. I stepped towards it, then froze.

A sound. Brief as a breath. And quiet, like a dying man’s sigh. My eyes snapped to a dark corner of the barn. A shape had peeled away from the shadows. I cocked my gun and hunkered down behind an old wooden barrel. I watched as the small figure shambled about in the darkness. 

Hattie. 

She must’ve torn out her throat somehow, because each breath sounded like a peculiar sob. Peering around my cover, I cocked my gun and trained it on the movement in the gloom.

*Make it clean, Dutch. The girl’s gotta still look like her poster when you haul her back to town.*

Placing my finger on the trigger, I squinted down the barrel, steadied my breath and waited for her to move into my sight. 

The figure lurched forward, breaking away from the shadows and, just as I was about to blow that son of a bitch away, I lowered my gun.

It wasn’t Hattie. No, the shape that staggered out from the darkness was alive. Another Indian kid. A girl, maybe eight or nine—definitely older than the boy in the cow. She was all beat-up and covered in blood. A ragged tear ran across her face from ear to chin. A thick slab of flesh had peeled away from her cheek and flapped limply with each uneasy step. She was struggling to suck in a full breath; her body shuddering with shock.

I raised the gun again, fixed the girl in my sight. My finger loitering over the trigger. Quick and easy. It was the right thing to do. 

The girl’s eyes lazily slid around in her head and then locked onto me. They widened and she began to scream and sob. The girl dropped to her knees and threw up her hands, mumbling words I could not understand. But the gesture was clear. She was pleading to me. Praying that I’d spare her life, that I’d save her.

I holstered my gun and slowly approached the blubbering wreck. Hands on my hips, I blew out a sigh and frowned down at her. 

Who cared if she was Indian? The kid was too damn young to have so much fear in her. Crouching down, I tried to catch her eye. Then, when it was clear that she was too scared to look up, I reached out to, I don’t know, shake her out of the shock she was in. But she flinched, clambered backward and pressed up against a wooden crate. 

The Indian whimpered and wheezed as she struggled to catch a breath. Blood bubbled out the hole in her cheek. Her eyes, wild and wide, fixed on me. No, a place beyond me.

 A soft, uneasy padding sound came from behind me. Warm and wet air blowing against the back of my arm. My heart started knocking about in my chest. I didn’t tend to let them get this close. That’s why Wyatt and I spent so much time down at the shooting range. Distance was your only friend against these ghouls.

*Rookie move, Dutch. You stupid son of a bitch.*

A low guttural moan rose up from behind, sending a shudder down my spine. I slipped my hand down to my holster and slowly drew out my gun. All the while, I watched the fear in the Indian’s eyes. 

“Hi Hattie,” I said under my breath. 

“Hi...Hattie,” it echoed with a voice like dirt.

*She can talk?*

I turned, raised my gun up, and shot. Her head wasn’t quite where I’d expected it to be. While my bullet kicked up some hay at the back of the barn, Hattie stood about a yard or two away, her back was crooked and snapped sideways. Her sheered spine jutted out of the top of her churned up hips like a bison’s tooth in an upturned grave. Her upper body had folded in on itself so that her head knocked against her left hip and both wrists scraped along the floor. 

That face. It’d once belonged to a child. It had once been the reason for Clint and Jude Sinclair to get out of bed every morning. But now...

She looked like leather held to the flame, all cracked and black with rot. Her mouth was gulping like a land-bound fish. Her eyes were dull and grey like tarnished steel.

Hattie’s lips slowly peeled up and away from her teeth and gums as she opened her jaws wide. The grey skin of her face loosely bunched up beneath her eyes like fabric caught in a sewing machine. Then she let out a crackling howl and lunged at me.

 Hattie’s upturned torso swung wildly on a tangle of tendons and muscle tissue at her waist. Her arms swiped at my side, grabbing a fistful of my shirt. She hooked a finger into my flank, digging deep into my chest and curling around one of my ribs.

 I got a shot off and blew a hole in Hattie’s arm. A wet lump of meat peeled back and flailed around like a muddied rag as we wrestled against one of the barrels. My shirt had started to become wet and red. That finger was still stubbornly clasped around my bone. I felt her other hand fumbling about my knee, trying to get a good handful of my pants.

I took the gun and began hammering down on Hattie’s hand. But the angle was awkward. Hattie didn’t bat an eye. My other hand was making wild swipes as she’d now gotten a hold of my leg. 

Another gnarled finger pressed into me. I screamed and tried to push her away. But Hattie was strong and relentless. The finger tore open my skin and wriggled its way into the soft tissue at the back of my knee. She clumsily plucked at a tendon, sending a severe shudder through my leg and making it buckle.

We both hit the floor. My gun tumbled out of my hand. 

Hattie’s guts spilled out of her hips all over me. A wet tangle of rubbery ropes pressed between us. Juices pooled out and soaked my shirt, getting into my face, my mouth. The smell of rot hit me hard. I wanted to be sick. Gagging and sputtering up phlegm

“Shit!” I cried. Another sharp fingernail tore at my flank and ripped a dirty hole in me. Then she pushed another squirming finger inside.

 Hattie’s fingers dug deeper, coiled around the rubbery threads in my knee and slowly pulled. Harder and harder. Then, snap. My leg folded on its own accord. A pain lanced through me like a cut from a rusty blade.

Bile purged up my throat and rolled about in my mouth like a thick, fiery slug. I spat it out onto Hattie’s dirt-matted hair in a pathetic act of defiance. I grabbed at the hand attempting to  excavate my chest and desperately tried to pull it free. But with each tug, Hattie’s grip around my rib grew tighter. Her hand was now knuckles-deep in me.

It was no use. I’d have to try another way. Or else...

*Maybe if I was off my back, I could break away?*

I rocked my body. Kicked off a nearby wooden crate with my good leg. Hattie resisted, tried to hold me down, but I kicked out again and managed to shift my weight enough to roll us over. 

“Shit. Shit,” Hattie hissed. 

Her mouth gargled with hatred. She snapped those tombstone teeth at my stomach, yet bit down on nothing but air. I coughed out a laugh, already thinking myself a winner. Then, she showed me how dire my circumstances truly were and twisted her fingers around inside my chest. 

Then, she pinched on something and pulled.
A half-gasp trapped in my throat and my body recoiled with the pain. Pink and blue lightning flashed at the edges of my vision. 

Glancing down at the wound in my chest, I noticed something odd. Between Hattie’s fingers and thumb was a glistening crimson bulb that was now protruding from between my ribs. It looked like my chest had blown a huge bubble. 

She gave it another twist. I couldn’t breathe. I couldn’t fucking bre—

I swiped wildly at her hand. Started prising her fingers away from the flesh she’d excavated from me. But her grip, it was so tight. And my fingers, they were so slippery with her rotten offal and my blood. 

Another vicious tug. My vision flashed white and vomit lurched up my throat, burning like a stab from a cattle prod. My hands still fumbling, still failing me. 

I was going to pass out. I was going to die.
Hattie would continue to rip me apart. Then, the Indian. Then...who knows.

She pulled again on my lung. The organ slipped a little further out through that small gash in my side. A bloody lump exposed. The inside out.

My body snapped forward. I vomited again. 

And all I could think about was train tracks. Blackened steel girders and wooden sleepers bisecting the desert and disappearing into the horizon. Iron John Keen. The railroad worker with a sun-burnt scalp, oil-smeared cheeks and a daily spot at the saloon bar. 

*So why John?*

John had an accident whilst laying track a decade ago. He’d been steaming drunk and, after a long day in the sun, collapsed onto a box of rail spikes. He woke up with a hangover and six inches of steel hanging from the side of his head. Now fully healed and nowhere near sober, Old John always enjoyed showing the boys his party trick where he’d poke his entire tongue out the hole in his cheek.

As I breathlessly fought with that bitch and watched her groan and gnash and tug at me, I wondered if I’d still be alive when that railroad tongue eventually flopped out of my chest.

A noise. Loud and hard and shaking the air around me. Hattie’s face broke open and bloomed like a poisonous flower. Her skull shattered into sharp shards of white and oozed with a charcoal sludge. 
Hattie’s weight fell away. Her grip relinquished and suddenly air filled my chest again.

Another gunshot. Then another. 

***

I was breathing. Ragged and shallow, but breathing nonetheless. I tried to open my eyes. Light swarmed in, flashing and blinding. A whirl of colours and shapes. 

I tried to get up and was firmly shoved to the floor. Pain vibrating through my entire body. 

“Dutch,” a voice said. “I don’t think you should move yet.”

“Wyatt?” 

I peered up at the silhouette looming over me. The dark face sickly spinning, yet slowly coming into view. And, just before the light hit Wyatt’s panicked eyes, I could’ve sworn I’d seen another man stood in his place. 

A dead man. A lost man. The crook.

“What the fuck happened?”  

“Ain’t it obvious?” I coughed. 

“Don’t worry, Dutch. It’s okay.” Wyatt wasn’t fooling anybody. His voice a couple of registers too high. “We’ll get you to Mary. Or Needles. Or anyone who can stitch you back up.”

I felt pressure on the wound in my chest. I coughed again. The taste of sick in my mouth. 

“Not Mary,” I said, my hand taking a fistful of Wyatt’s shirt, “She’ll tell half the town and we can’t have anyone knowing what went down.”

“Okay. Needles,” Wyatt said. His presence still felt otherworldly. “I’m sorry about this.”

A sharp pain in my side. I curled up into a ball. 

“Fuck!” I screamed. I gasped and gasped for a breath that didn’t come. My hand went searching for the blade he’d thrust into my side and instead found a small gulping hole. And then, suddenly I could breathe again. “What did you do?”

“I don’t know, Dutch.” That squeaky nervous voice from when our daddy would bring out the belt. “Just kinda pushed it back in.”

“Pushed it back in?”

“Yeah,” he said, “I don’t think your lungs are supposed to be on the outside.”

I sucked in another deep breath. it hurt like a motherfucker, but at least I had air in me again. I rolled onto my side, then tried to brave the blinding lights again. I opened my eyes. 

Dark lumps of flesh everywhere. Wooden crates upturned and glistening with blood. The splintered hole of cool blue sky in the side of the barn. The warm afternoon sun lancing in and motes of dust flashing gold on the air.

And a body. 

The girl. Not Hattie, the Indian. A bloodied bundle in the hay and dirt. Legs and arms splayed out in all directions. Such a shameful shape. Her face was now loose and emptied of the fear and pain from moments before. Smoke coiled up from a nasty hole above her left eye. Those eyes, how they stared for miles and miles and miles as if fixed on some unseen place beyond. 

“What d’ya do?” I coughed.

“Saved your dumbass,” Wyatt grunted back. He was tearing off strips of his shirt and pressing them against my blood-slick skin. “Shot those ghouls that jumped ya.”

I grabbed at Wyatt’s collar and brought him eye-level. Rage rising in me like a burning flame. 

“There was only one!” I spat into his gormless face.
“But-bu—”

I shook my head. “Another Indian kid.”

“Oh.” 

Wyatt glanced over at the body. Then his face creased into a deep frown.

“Yep,” I said, nodding. Then, suddenly sapped of all energy, all hope, I collapsed into his shoulder. My rage drained away and left me cold. It was futile. Anger wouldn’t change anything. We already had the blood of one Indian on our hands. What was two? 

“Can you walk?”

“Don’t know. And I’m scared to try.”

Wyatt’s jaw was tight. Nostrils flared. The face of that kid who was always too nervous to wade out beyond the reeds in the river, despite being a head and shoulders above all the other kids in town.

Wyatt nodded, then disappeared for a while. He searched the barn for some wood and rope. Then, he did his best to piece together a makeshift brace for my bad leg. It was awkward and hurt like a motherfucker, but, with Wyatt’s help, it got me to my horse.

I kept my eyes trained on the horizon whilst Wyatt bagged up the girls and prepared the barn to burn. No witnesses, no evidence, no crime. Only we’d know. And God, if he was still knocking around.

The sun was loitering pretty close to the distant mountains when Wyatt finally emerged from the barn dragging two full hessian sacks. You didn’t need to peek inside to guess which one was Hattie’s. All shapeless and wet. It reminded me of when momma would return from the Salt Fork with a sopping bundle of laundry draped over her shoulder. 

Then, after slinging the girls over the back of each horse, Wyatt set that barn ablaze. We didn’t wait long before setting off for the spot Wyatt’d picked out for the boy in the cow. Just waited long enough to watch the shadows dance along the walls inside and smoke begin to plume out. 

We must’ve ridden out about a quarter mile when I reigned in my horse and looked back at the flame. The sky was beginning to bruise and the flame had completely swallowed the barn. Its amber tongues almost looked like they were licking at the pinkish underbellies of distant clouds.

Almost content with the sight, I was about to ride on. But something caught my eye. Amidst the fiery blaze, I could see something dark moving within the open shell of the barn. 

“What’s that?” I said, nodding toward the flame. 

Wyatt followed my gaze and cocked his head. “What d’ya see?”

I squinted, tried to get a better look. A shape moving within the fire. As black as night. 

Smoke? Or maybe some wooden joists had started to fail? No. It looked like a...a man.

A dark figure stepped out from the fire and then stopped. The flames still danced above the man’s frame, but he appeared unperturbed. Motionless. Silent.

Why wasn’t he thrashing around in pain? Rolling in the dirt and screaming?

“Do you think that’s...” Wyatt didn’t even have to utter his name. 

We both knew. Of course it was that stubborn bastard. The start of all our problems. The reason Mangum was a godless patch of dirt. It was the crook. It was Walker.

“We should turn round and take him out,” Wyatt said, sidling up next to me.

I shook my head. My eyes fixed on the man on fire. “No. We got bodies to bury.”

“But, Dutch, he’s on foot. We can finally get that son of a bi—”

“Enough!” I shouted. My words ringing out over the empty land. “We have three bodies we need to deal with and only three working legs. How do you suppose we also bring that bastard home too?”

“But Dutch—”

“But nothing!” I said, turning my horse around and my back on the fire. “The dead’s gonna be the last of your worries when some pissed-off Indians come to town looking for their kids and find our crook’s fingernails in one and your bullet in the other. Let’s just do what we do and dig some deep fucking holes. Now take me to the dead boy.”

***

It wasn’t far and Wyatt had already made a hell of a start on the grave. The dirt looked good. Barely any rocks, which for Mangum is like striking oil. 

We dug in silence until the moon was the only light we had. Wyatt shouldered most of the burden, but, despite my leg, I was pleased with the amount of earth I’d been able to shift. Perhaps all was not lost.
For a while, we just stood there and stared out across the land. The distant mountains looked like the spine of a felled giant. 

“Squint hard enough and you can see the double crosses,” Wyatt said, finally breaking the silence.

I nodded. “You don’t need to see them to know they're close.”

“Yep.” Wyatt lit a cigarette and started to smoke. He offered me a drag, but I declined. “You okay?”

I shook my head. Then, after letting the question roll around in my skull for a while, I asked: “Have you ever heard *them* talk?”

Wyatt shot me a look, took a long drag then spit into the dirt. “Nope.”

“Hattie did.”

I frowned at the distant cluster of wooden stakes that stippled the ground. Their shadows were long and hatched the sun-starched grass.

“Does it matter?” Wyatt said, flicking his smoke into the dirt.

“I don’t know.”

We rode back to town. Hattie’s chewed-up corpse slumped over the back of Wyatt’s horse. Our backs against those two unmarked graves. Not a word shared between. Silence, our only honesty. Our only safety.

For a while now, Wyatt and I had tricked ourselves into thinking we were doing the town a favour. Heck, there were days when I’d joke and half-believe we were doing God’s work. How foolish we were. In truth, there’s nothing complicated or special about what we do. In the end, all we do is dig holes, throw people in them, then pray the ground accepts our offerings.
 
*Doing God’s work...*

Christ. I knew it. Wyatt knew it. Everyone in Mangum had the thought rattling about in their head somewhere. How could we continue to have faith when the dirt just kept saying no?

The morning light flashed crimson off the pressed tin by the time we could see Mangum on the horizon. The town looked like it was on fire. Perhaps it soon would be. It was the only thing remarkable in the dead yet hard-fought landscape. Everything else was just sky and dirt. The dirt that had grown tired of us and started rejecting the dead. 

But we pressed on. On towards Mangum; our home that we’d betrayed. Our hearts now heavy with the debts we owed. Our minds rattled by dreams of a ravaged world and a heaven closed to all creatures who scuttled beneath that silent sun.

After seeing Walker burning against the twilight sky, I was certain that there was a Hell. But it wasn’t a place we go, but rather something we become.
