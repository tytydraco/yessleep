I think there is a poltergeist/ entity my house

Hi I think I have an entity or poltergeist in my house. I’ve been living with my partner for the past couple of months now with his family. They have been small encounters such as hearing footsteps upstairs and things being moved around. When everyone is asleep his mum has cleaned the house since then and it has helped up until last week. 

Last week I was on the phone to my partner who was at work at the time talking my dog then went into defensive mode trying to protect me growling at one corner of the room. I have never seen him so on edge or protective over me, he had a low tone growl and the hairs on his back and neck was standing up. He was fixated on this corner of the room. I then said told my partner “it looks like he’s growling at the balloons.” I’ve had these helium balloons in my room since my birthday last month. As soon as I said that something tugged on the strings of the balloons  aggressively I got myself and dog out of the room. 

The next night I was woken up for my sleep. This was unusual for me as I normally sleep through the night and don’t wake up as I’ve woken up, I’ve sit up and looked at the end of the bed my partner was standing in front of the balloons looking at me watching me sleep sleep as I was about to call out to him. I looked at my left and realised he was sleeping next to me. I looked back up at whatever was watching me. It felt like it was him. It looks like it was him. The only difference was it had no facial features and pitch black eyes, this had spooked but I managed to get myself back to sleep.

Ever since the first night this happened there has been a very heavy feeling downstairs like a weight is on my shoulders no matter where I go. This feeling has been following me but getting worse when I enter downstairs my partner can feel this as well. 

The next night I heard six taps coming from the same corner as if someone was knocking/tapping on the wall. Then I saw a really tall dark shadow poking its head into the room from the doorway. This happened a couple times like it was playing peekaboo with me after this. I put my cross back on around my neck since I’ve put my cross back on I feel it has made this thing  angry as I felt like hands are around my neck choking me.  
After that night I went to a crystal shop in the morning. I bought white sage and crystals for protection. I feel as if this is also made it angry later in the day. Some friends came over as soon as I walked in they could feel a heavy presence and weight on their shoulders. 

Later that night around 1:40 am to 1:45 am I was woken by my dog growling outside of my room and barking. I woke up to a big thud or bang after that I had five more bangs and my dog was getting even more on edge. After every single one. I managed to put myself back to sleep in about 10 minutes later. My partner woke up to what sounded like nails been so scraped across the dryer which is also downstairs my dog walked out to check what it was and got scared and ran back into the bedroom. He heard this about two times until he woke me up we were both very scared. I was scared to the point. I couldn’t move then decided we were going to sleep upstairs. We feel as if this also made it angry as when we went upstairs we could hear doors slamming and banging happening. It’s safe to say my partner didn’t get any sleep last night. I’ve even tried staging the house myself while ringing a bell. This didn’t work for me. I feel it just made it angrier. Me and my partner have both had scratches on our body we can explain how they got there along with my partner having bruises on his body 


I’m really scared and don’t know what to do. If anyone knows what this is would you please let me know? This would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for taking your time to read this.
