I should start this with some context. Yes, I have contacted the local police. The only thing I have touched (which I definitely should not have) are the notes and the box I found them in, which I’ve transcribed here.

 I live near the Pacific Northwest, a pioneer town, some remnant of the Oregon Trail. The most lovely part about living in this part of the country is all the nature. I have the Rocky Mountains quite literally in my backyard, and because of how close they are, the foothills at least, I like to leave my house and just go explore. I never leave home without water, and I know the area pretty damn well, so I feel comfortable going alone (well, not entirely alone, I bring my dog with me.)

There's a hiking path not too far away from my house, not even a 20 minutes walk, so if I'm ever down or want to unwind, I just head out that way with my dog, and just get a nice fresh breath of air.

I’m just headed down my usual path, when my dog, Rory, starts acting up. Like he just stops, and starts growling into the woods. I'm getting nervous, I assume there's some animal he can smell, that I can see.

Here’s the bigger problem. My dog is a terrible guard dog. Major wimp. So what ends up happening, is he suddenly yelps, and books it away from me, and into the brush, burning my hands from the leash being torn out of them. I start sprinting after my dog, through the woods.

Running through woods is hard. Branches and stuff cutting me, I'm tripping over stuff, just trying not to lose sight of my dog. I'm following him, calling out for him to come back, just trying my damned hardest as a pet owner to not lose him. That, is when I stumble into a clearing, and my dog finally calms down, and lays down.

Looking around, I got really confused. It was a ghost town. Like old timey buildings all around, burnt down. Shells. Never been in this area, or heard of this. I had NO idea anything like this was around here. So I make a note of where I ran over here from to make my way back later, and go over to my dog, to find out he's laying next to BONES.

Like a charred human skeleton. Scared the fucking daylights out of me, never seen anything like it before. It was old, so no meat or anything on it, but still, it's a body. So I grab my dog’s leash, trying to yank him away, and his growls at me.

My dog has never growled at me. He’s the sweetest boy ever. Wouldn't hurt a fly. A lover, not a fighter. A fleer if anything, like how I got in this situation in the first place. That's when he started rooting under the skeleton. I thought he was trying to steal a bone or something, so I start shitting myself thinking I'm going to get in trouble for desecrating a grave, when he grabs something from under the skeleton. I grab it out of his mouth, and take a look at it, brushing it off. I (against my better judgment), open it, and there's just a bunch of…letters. I decided I’d transcribe them here, then put it down next to the skeleton, and call the police or…a museum or something. An anthropologist maybe? Something like that. This is what the notes read.

Dear Brother,

I write to you about my journey to the Oregon Territory. I know not when I will get these letters to you, nor if they will, but I will write nonetheless. The construction of the town is coming along well. Our spirits are high, and productivity is great. A few homes have already been constructed, as well as a House of our Lord. The land seems fertile, the fish are plentiful, and the forest is brimming with game. This place truly feels like our Garden of Eden.

However, there remains some unease amongst us, a strange change taking root. It started with the arrival of a stranger, a preacher man by the name of Father Coleman. We are unsure as to how he arrived in our developing town, but his appearance was nevertheless accepted into our community. We claims to be a traveling missionary, spreading the good word of Christ into these untamed lands. 

At first, we welcomed him with open arms, excited to hear his sermons and guidance, a good sense of leadership to propel our town onto the map.

Although, his influence rapidly grew beyond the pulpit. His teachings were strange, unlike any I have ever participated in my own. Speaking about how God is nature, and may return to Him through the soil. I believed his teachings to border on heretical, but alas, I seem to be mostly alone in my worries. 

After Church, he guides his followers into the forest where they remain for hours at a time, and after they emerge back to town, they are still, eyes vacant like a beast. They are quiet, cold, and distant.

Dear Brother,

I must confess I am getting worried. Coleman’s followers grow by the day, and their behavior is becoming ever more peculiar. The more devout of his supporters no longer attend gatherings or work alongside us. Instead they sit amongst themselves, speaking in hushed voices and quiet whispers. Their eyes, once full of wonder and excitement, appear dull and sunken. 

I overhead them them speaking as I walked to my home after work, and what I heard sent a chill to my core.

“The great change is upon us.”

When I asked one of them, Samuel, what he meant by this, he stared at me with a blank face, and merely said “All will be revealed in time.”

August 10th

Dear Brother,

I fear we are in great danger. Coleman and his followers have become brazen and violent. They have taken over the church, tearing down the symbols of the Lord and etching strange sigils of skulls contorting and spiraling in on themselves.

They hold their sermons at odd hours, and I have seen them carving their symbols into the trees around the area. The air hangs thick with tension, and even the birds refuse to fly over our town. 

Last night, my neighbor, Mrs. Thompson, tried fleeing town with her children last night. She claimed to have seen a dark ritual Coleman and his followers were performing in the woods. Her own husband caught her at the edge of the woods, and Coleman and his followers just watched as he dragged her back into the church.

This morning, I tried getting a look into Mrs. Thompson’s house, and it was utterly empty, and her children are nowhere to be found. 

August 15th

Brother I am writing to you in haste, for I fear I may not have much time. The entire town has fallen under Coleman’s spell. Those of us who resisted have been hunted down and captured. They came for me last night, but I was able to evade them. I am writing this to you under the light of the moon. I am hidden in the forest, but I know not how long I may remain undiscovered. 

I fear I cannot leave this place. It feels the further I go, the more the town calls to me.

God has chosen me to bear witness to these horrors, and I must bring an end to Coleman and his worshippers.

August 16th

Dear Brother,

What I have witnessed today must not leave the confines of these letters and my own mind.

Under the light of the full moon, Coleman and his followers filtered out of the church in a line, making a circle in the church's courtyard. That's when they began dragging out my neighbors, the ones who were not caught under Coleman’s spells. They forced them into the circle, and made them kneel. Coleman walked into the middle, and began chanting in a language I could never understand, and all around him, his followers began chanting the same thing, over, and over, and over again.

“In the Name of the Coligon”.

That's when those in the circle began to still, their crying, screaming, and thrashing, ceased. Coleman, or The Coligon, began to laugh a horrible laugh. He scratched at his neck, ripping and tearing chunks off of himself, making sickening squelches as he continued to laugh and laugh until all that remained, was his skull. The rest of his body began to pop, bend, and contort until he was standing on all fours, a beast unlike any I had ever seen. His skin hung in tatters, his eyes a black unlike any I had ever seen, and his grin a grotesque thing, with rows of jagged, mismatched teeth.

As his followers chanted, the air only grew heavier, a sense of dread freezing me to my position. The people in the circle remained unnaturally still, their eyes wide with terror but unable to scream, as The Coligon circled around them, sniffing the air as if tasting their fear. 

With a final growl, The Coligon lunged forward, tearing into the nearest person’s neck, ripping into them with savage glee. Blood sprayed across the courtyard, and the chanting only grew louder and louder. One by one, The Coligon ripped into the townsfolk, feasting upon them, and their lifeless bodies hitting the floor.

As The Coligon finished, the chanting slowly diminished, and once they were done, they stood up, and took out a dagger, each one of them drawing across their own neck, and fell to the ground simultaneously.

Then it looked at me.

The Coligon, standing in the middle of its circle of death and misery, looked directly at me with that savage grin.

Then it turned, and walked into the church, closing the door behind it.

I knew what had to be done.

I burned that church to the ground.

I burned the houses.

I burned the forest around the town.

Nothing may stand in this profane place.

I have left these letters behind so you may know what happened here, and as a grim warning.

Dear Brother, Beware the Coligon.


And that's all they wrote. Fucking creepy shit. I did some poking around the ruins, and I cannot find anything that looks like a church or oddly enough, any other skeletons or thankfully, some demon deer creature. I do feel a little watched, but that's usual after I read a scary story. Did I mention I don't like scary stories? My dog is acting normal now, looking up at me with that dopey face of his. I love him. I called the cops (like I said in the intro here) and they said to wait till they got here so I can try and guide them to the area. They’re also going to get the National Parks service out to investigate as well. Past that, not really my problem, and hopefully, will never be my problem again.

I guess I'll just look out for the Coligon myself.
