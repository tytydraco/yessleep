TODAY ( the volunteer)

I was in a movie theater watching family guy (idk) then everything switched and these two men with no face just a pinstripe suit  comes sits next to me and now on the big screen it reads “enjoy your life for 7 seconds” and it’s a video of us and the two men on the screen. End credits roll and it says “thanks for VOLUNTEERING”

I heard the shower running behind the theater's emergency exit door. I get out of my seat and the two men pushed me back down and said “NO” we take you they have to grab my wrist because my hands are missing 😢. They are now walking me to the door and says “go head open it” 

I open it to find myself in MY bathroom with the shower on (I know it’s me I  know my humming)  I’m hesitant to walk in but one of the guys pushes me and goes “7 seconds, save yourself” 

 I pull back the curtain to see me myself smiling sewing my skin together humming. I start crying and now my hands are back again ..  the guy says “4 seconds”  I cry saying I don’t know what to do and then a gun magically appears … 

“3 seconds”  I’m screaming begging them to stop, then bullets appear…. “2 seconds” I couldn’t take it anymore I didn’t know how to save me. I loaded the gun and shot myself in the head as I’m dying one guy is helping me in the shower and the other stands over me and says

 “stupid girl now you’re dead like you always wanted to be”


THEN YESTERDAY ( Lady in the window) 

just moved to this new town new city and every night it’s this lady ( dark figure no face but I can tell it’s a lady) she watches me cook, clean, eat every night.
So one day I forgot to take out the trash and grabbed the trash can and raced down the block to make it and the lady tripped me made me miss the garbage truck

I asked her why did she do that she said “because I’m you, you always fail” pushed me in the garbage can and I felt her rolling me down the block
I’m now in my own home but she says it’s her home because remember she said she is me, she is now sitting on my chest forcing me this drinking and screaming at me turning demon like

Whatever she gave me left me unable to move or speak but I can still hear and see , she puts me in a coffin and before kicking me in the grave she says “ I’m just trying to save you”

I have now reached that point where I fear sleep. It used to be fun but now it’s not fun anymore. I use to look forward to sleep but I rather not. Nothing is fun anymore. Nothing IS FUN
