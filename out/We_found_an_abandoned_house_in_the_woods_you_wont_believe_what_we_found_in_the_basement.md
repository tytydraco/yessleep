Me and Mike have been friends since school. We would always go on these wild adventures as we lived by a huge national forest. We normally stuck to the trails and always kept a compass on us, It was of course easy to get lost in the woods. We had planned to head out early one day and try to go further than we had ventured before. He came to mine just after 06:00, I drove us over to a clearing in the forest. We used this as well as other people as a start point to the many trails that meandered off into the woods. Most of these we had walked for many years all of them sign posted and color coded. That way you could find your way back. 

We took the red route, this led onto the purple route. We got about 4 hours into our hike when we came across a half moss covered sign up ahead. Underneath the sign it looked like an old track ran straight through the forest, of course it looked like it hadn’t been used in years but still distinguishable against the surrounding foliage. Mike said “Let’s follow it for a few clicks, see if it goes anywhere”. I was hesitant I didn’t want this to distract us from our initial plan but I was up for exploring so I agreed. 

The track had been reclaimed by the forest and was difficult to follow but sure enough through the trees we could see a building up ahead. We must have walked the uneven track about half an hour already, so we could do with a rest. As we neared the building a few hand written signs welcomed us, ‘KEEP OUT’, ‘PRIVATE PROPERTY’ and ‘TRESPASSERS WILL BE SHOT’. The place had obviously been long abandoned so we didn’t think to much of them. As we approached the graffiti covered door we could see it had been chained closed. The chain and lock was covered in rust, it made an agonising screeching noise when we moved it. 

There was a broken piece of old iron fencing laying amongst the weeds a few yards away. Mike picked it up and tried to break the lock, it took a few attempts by both of us but eventually ‘crack’. We undone the chains around the handles and prised open the doors. A cloud of dust and dirt surrounded us, we both got out our flashlights from our backpacks. As we walked in the floorboards creaked and the rooms echoed. The place looked untouched since the 80’s at least. Streams of light filtered through the boarded up windows exposing boar and stag heads all hung around the room. 

We decided to split up, Mike went up the stairs, while I wandered into the kitchen. You could tell that time and the surrounding forest had consumed the property but it seemed as though when it was left, it was immaculate. I could hear the house startle with every footstep Mike took upstairs, fine wood dust floated down under where ever he walked. I shouted up to him “Anything up there Mike?!” He came back a moment later “Naah man, just like a normal house just dusty as fuck!” I laughed “Yeah, same here dude” I walked out of the kitchen and noticed there was a door under the stairs. I tried to open it but it wouldn’t budge. I called up “Mike, get down here, help me with this door!” He came down and we both pulled at the doorknob. We heard a small click and then it whined open, the hinges seemed to scream at us. 

We both turned our flashlights to the opening, there was a staircase leading to a basement. The steps were crooked and disjointed we held onto the wooden rail as we descended. There was an old switch that illuminated at the bottom, I tried flicking it. Nothing, as I expected. We flooded the room with our flashlights, there were glass cases lining the wall with a central case in the middle. All of them covered in a thick layer of dust. 

Mike walking into the room said “Geez, smells like something died in here!” I replied “yeah, this doesn’t seem right to me”. I heard Mike behind me sudden go “oh fuck, what the hell is that!” I shone my light over to him, he had wiped the dirt off one of the cases, It looked like a wax figure of a woman but all disfigured. I felt a lump at the back of my throat, “what the hell is this place man?!” We wiped a few more and again our eyes were met with more creepy looking wax like dolls all clothed in different dresses.

“This is fucked up dude” I said while trying to compose myself, he said back in a shaky voice “that’s nothing man, look in the centre case”. There hanging was the clothed remains of a person bound together by former muscles. I retracted back nearly dropping my flashlight, “we need to get out of here Mike, this place feels rotten”. I noticed a withered yellow stained envelope on a small wooden table next to the central case. We heard a loud tap on one of the glass cases behind us, we nearly jumped out of our skin. Mike stuttered “bring it with us, we’re getting the fuck out of here!”

We ran out of that place like there was no tomorrow, we were spooked, we felt like we had just crawled out of hell. We didn’t stop running until we came to the trail point once again. This trip was over for us, we didn’t want to be in this forest anymore. We got back to my car about 3 hours later. 

We sat dishevelled in the front seats, I pulled the envelope from my coat pocket and opened it. A hand written note was inside. 

Here is what the note read: 

—————————————————————

Hello, 

I am a self titled collector, there are many people who collect many different things in this world. Some collect antiques while others collect paintings, I know one thing though. Everyone collects things of beauty.

I wasn’t always a collector though, no, I worked for the family business. We were animal technicians, we would prepare deceased pets and hunters trophies as preserved things of beauty. I was good, maybe the best at what I did for 20 years I was a master taxidermist. One day a family came to me with an offer, it was a rare one and one which I hadn’t come across before. They wanted me to work on a deceased relative, it was the family’s and the deceased persons wish, to preserve them forever. At first, I was horrified but they were willing to pay 5 x my yearly salary. 

I spoke with my two brothers and father, they opposed it profusely. They said it was immoral, forbidden and above all illegal. After this point I left the family business, due to, creative differences. I set up a small business of my own, I was in control. I worked on the family’s relative, a thing of beauty. Capturing someone eternally is something to be admired, no? I didn’t get another offer of this kind but it intrigued my creativity. 

The first of my collection came by chance, I was often lonely and needed some company. I lived out of the way not many people only the odd hiker, I preferred it like that. I picked up a young lady as she was working her usual spot on an evening in a town about 10 miles away. We went back to my place and things got a bit crazy, a mixture of pills and alcohol were the main guests at our party. When I became more aware a few hours later, my company had unfortunately expired. Such a pretty young thing I couldn’t just let her fade away into dust, she needed to be frozen in time. I was the one that could make that happen, an everlasting beauty. 


I cleaned her up and worked my magic, she was a natural masterpiece. Once I had finished I dressed her in a stunning yellow dress, she was ready for her podium. I placed young Monique behind a glass case with a small plaque “Monique, the original beauty”. This unbeknown to me would be the first of many, I must admit the many ‘accidents’ may have been slightly forced by me, what can I say I was impatient. 


My collection now stands at over 43 individual pieces of elegance. They are all lavishly dressed and cased, stood in an eternal walk way of the exquisite and grace. Many may have other feelings towards what I do, what I collect, but after all I only encapsulate a brief moment of life, and present it eternally.

I have nearly completed my collection, after all these years. As I place the last case in the center of my hall of trophies. I fit the rope to the top of my podium. I will not be preserved, I will not be eternal but at least I will be surrounded by pure, beautiful artistry. 

 People will not understand. 

Here is art, for you all to see. 

Please. Enjoy my collection.

I felt sick. Even writing this back now makes every hair on my body stand on end, the thought of being surrounded by all of that death in one room made my skin crawl. 

We both decided to report this to the police with this note as evidence. They searched for miles into them woods, for days, weeks even. they found no buildings, no signs or anything. I  think they even started believing that we had made it all up as some sick joke. 

We both know what we saw out there, the proof is written in the note.

We haven’t been in that forest since, heck we ain’t even spoke about it. Someone out there knows what that place is. Maybe his family, maybe he had help, I don’t know.

To be honest I would rather just forget the whole thing.
