All my life I have been a huge true crime fan, I read books, listen to podcast and spend endless amounts of time researching the most minute details of cases. But there was one particular case that stood out to me, and I am a little obsessed with it. The case of The East Texas Butcher, It really captures my interest as I was so fascinated by the fact the police could never find any links to the women, they didn’t know how he chose his victims or what his modus operandi was. So that lead me to the start of my journey, I wanted to pay homage to the East Texas Butcher and what better way than to recreate his killings. I wanted to copy them to the very last detail; the type of rope he used, the same knife, I wanted to find women that resembled the victims but that would prove more difficult.

 So, a few weeks ago I saw this woman, she was mid-twenties, with shoulder length brown hair and stunning green eyes. 

I decided that she would be my first victim, I watched her for a few days tracking her every movement, she was predictable and stuck to a routine. She would go to work at the local library, stop at the store and then head home for the night. She lived in a small, detached house just outside the city, it was perfect. It was near the woods of the butcher’s first killing and the nearest neighbour was around 50 yards away, so I was unlikely to be seen. I bought all that I needed from the hardware store and put it in my car. I drove to her house and arrived at around two in the morning. 

A dim streetlamp was the only source of light; I wore a full black outfit with a black balaclava in my pocket. I parked about a five-minute walk away from her house and made the short walk trying my best not to be seen. I walked around to the back door and used the back of my knife to break the windowpane closest to the lock on the inside. The glass shattered, I hoped that she didn’t hear but realistically it didn’t matter. I reached inside and carefully opened the lock trying not to cut myself on the shards of glass still sticking out. It opened and I crept in, the house was bigger than it looked from the outside. I made my way to the stairs and crept up them slowly one-by-one. 

I found her bedroom door and opened it, careful not to make any noise. She was lay sleeping soundly unaware of my presence. I woke her up and told her if she made any noise I would kill her. I bound her ankles and wrists just like the East Texas Butcher and killed her with my knife. Then came the hard part. I had visited the site of the killing but navigating my way in the dark with a tied up, close to death woman on my shoulder was a bit different. After a long while of searching, I finally found the clearing that the butcher had dumped the first body. I left the woman there and hoped that someone would find her. My first recreation was a success, and it felt so satisfying. 

A few days later I saw the news, the woman had been found by a pair of hikers in the woods. The headline read:

‘THE EAST TEXAS BUTCHER RETURNS’

The satisfaction was immense; I felt a sense of pride and accomplishment for the first time in my life. But that didn’t last long. Later that week I received a letter, I found it when I walked out my front door. It was just sitting there, there was no address on it. The letter had been hand delivered. I went back inside sat down and opened it up. It said:

Dear Mr Copycat,

I commend you on your fine work, but I do not appreciate the fact that you copied my kill. If you know what is good for you, you will stop and leave it there. If not there will be consequences.

Kind regards,

The East Texas Butcher

The note was handwritten. I thought it must be some kind of prank, I was very active in the true crime reddit communities, and many people knew of my obsession with the butcher, especially the few friends that I had made and met in real life. I chalked it down to one of them playing a prank.

I decided to continue on with my quest, I wanted to recreate every kill. I found another target, she was much like the first woman, however this one was slightly older. I followed her to work, she worked at a small store on the till. I never went in, didn’t want to give the police any clues. But I watched and waited for the perfect time. I followed her home a few times and one night, she was alone and it seemed her neighbours had gone away for the night. I decided this was as perfect a time as ever. The butcher’s second kill was much like the first. I broke into the woman’s home and tied her up with the same kind of rope as the first. This kill though I slit the woman’s throat and left her to bleed out. I didn’t need to move her as the butcher had left the woman in the bed to be discovered by a concerned relative and so I did exactly the same thing. 

This kill took longer to be discovered and after a week, I was desperate to recreate the next one. I wanted this one to be as perfect as possible, the butcher had killed a young woman around twenty who went to college. So, I decided to hang around the local college and find the perfect target. It took a few days of me just sitting in the car looking around but eventually on the second day I found her. She looked eerily similar to the butcher’s third victim, the same strawberry blonde hair, the same blue eyes and around about the same height from my estimations. 

I followed her for the next day and waited for the perfect moment to grab her. I had bought a van for cash from a used car place about an hour away from the college. The night after first seeing her I followed her down a street at night, It was quite late, she must have been coming back from a party. When there were no cars or people around, I quickly drove the van in front of her, stopped and grabbed her. Using the chloroform I had kept in my pocket I put her to sleep and threw her in the van. I waited an hour and took her home when all my neighbours had gone to sleep.

I took her to the basement, chained her to the pillar and put a gag around her mouth. I walked to my front door and checked outside to make sure there was no one that had seen me. To the side of my door was a small package that I had missed in my haste to get the woman into my house. I grabbed it and walked back inside. 

I sliced the package open with my pen knife, inside the package was a polaroid photo. I recognised the woman in the photo instantly. It was the butcher’s fifth victim, she was tied up and very much still alive. My heart dropped and a bead of sweat dripped from my head onto the table. The only person who could have taken this photo was the butcher.

I shakily turned the photo around and on the back was a handwritten message.

‘I gave you a warning, you are ruining my legacy. If you copy my kill again, I will come to this house and you will be my final victim’. I dropped the photo. I could hear my heart beating out of my chest, I can still hear it now whilst writing this and I have just heard the woman wake up. My third victim is locked in my basement and the butcher will kill me if I finish the recreation, what am I supposed to do!
