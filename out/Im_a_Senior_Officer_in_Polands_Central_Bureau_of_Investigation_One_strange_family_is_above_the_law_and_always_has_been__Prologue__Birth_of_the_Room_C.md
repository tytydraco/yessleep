I’m 37 years old. I hold one of the most sensitive positions in the CBŚP — Centralne Biuro Śledcze Policji — Poland’s Central Investigation Bureau of Police. It’s the kind of job where most people stop asking what you actually do after you say the title. They nod politely, maybe crack a joke about James Bond, then change the subject. Which is fine. That’s usually the safest thing for everyone.

And yes. I’ll admit it straight up: I’m a nepo baby.

My career path was shaped long before I ever filed my first report. My grandfather wore four stars on his uniform and commanded silence when he walked into a room. He was a general from the old school — the kind of man who shook hands like he meant it and trusted no one who smiled too much. I’ve seen black-and-white photos of him standing beside men history books now call controversial. Back then, they just called them necessary.

My father took a different path. He never wore a uniform, but he didn’t need one. He built his influence from the shadows — in think tanks, private dinners, backroom advisory roles that left no official footprint but shaped more decisions than any minister could admit. He and Donald Tusk have known each other since the early 2000s. Vacationed together once, back when Gdańsk still had that post-Solidarity optimism clinging to the air like sea salt.

I remember hearing Tusk’s name for the first time when I was twelve. It was Christmas Eve. My father and his friends had already had a few glasses of nalewka, and someone joked about who’d be prime minister next.

"Donald’s smart enough. But not cruel enough," one of them said.

My father smiled, shook his head, and replied, "He learns fast."

They all laughed. I didn’t understand it then.

Now I do.

So yeah, when the 2023 parliamentary elections happened, and Law and Justice (PiS) finally fell, I was already exactly where I needed to be. Not by merit. Not entirely. I won’t lie to you, my name was on the shortlist before the votes were even counted. The old guard collapsed in November, and by January I was promoted fast. Too fast.

Was it earned? Maybe in part. I wasn’t incompetent. I had the cases, the arrests, the field experience. But that’s not why they picked me. Let’s not pretend. But here’s the thing most people don’t get: not everyone born into power wants to wield it.

Some of us just want to get the job done. Cleanly. Quietly. By the book.

I told myself, maybe, no, definitely, foolishly, that I could be one of the good ones. That I could rise with the new government and help build something better. That I could serve the law instead of playing its angles. I wanted to believe that the post-PiS era might finally be the moment when old ghosts stopped running the country.

I was wrong.

Because within months of settling into my new office, I learned there are ghosts older than any party. And one Polish family that has never, ever answered to the law.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We were on the verge of implicating seventeen individuals, including current and former senators, voivodeship-level officials, two deputy mayors, and three businessmen who sat on the advisory board of the 2025 presidential frontrunner Karol Nawrocki, an “independent” candidate public ties to no party, but silent support from every PiS-aligned media outlet in the country.   

Operation Świetlik (Skylight) was just days away from execution.

A full-scale, multi-agency takedown of one of the last surviving money channels from the PiS era. A legacy operation that had survived two government transitions and three changes of internal leadership by mutating just enough to remain invisible.

We had eyes on it for over six months. No press. No leaks. No unnecessary communication with the prosecutor's office. We kept it in-house, four of us, rotating night shifts in a secure wing of the CBŚP, under Section 12B, Special Operations Unit. We flagged every transaction through a fictitious infrastructure company registered in eastern Lublin Voivodeship.

On the surface, it was a defunct construction firm. No contracts since 2021. One office, no staff. Fake website. But the grant applications kept coming. And the money kept moving.

Through a network of regionally registered non-profits, fake agricultural cooperatives, and “strategic consultancy” firms, funds earmarked for rural revitalization, transport modernization, and disaster relief were quietly siphoned off, laundered, then reappeared as "private contributions" and untraceable donor payments to local election campaigns in 2023. Seventeen targets. All of them “unaffiliated” — but all part of the same silent ecosystem that kept PiS alive long after 2023. The theory was that if Nawrocki fell, so would PiS’s last serious bid to retake the presidency, not just in 2025, but in the next decade. And that made *us* the tip of the spear.

And while we worked in silence, upstairs, the country was on fire. The 2025 presidential elections were in full swing if you could call it that. In reality, it was less a democratic process than a controlled demolition of whatever public trust remained after two decades of ideological trench warfare. Poland was *splintered*. Sliced along invisible lines: class, geography, education, faith, language, trauma, fatigue.

You had to pick a side — and if you didn’t, one would be picked for you.

The war between Koalicja Obywatelska — the Civic Coalition built on the bones of Platforma Obywatelska — and Prawo i Sprawiedliwość (Law and Justice, PiS) had been the only political constant since 2005.

Two armies. Two visions. Two myths about who had saved Poland, and who had nearly destroyed it. And in 2025, it wasn’t just ideological anymore. It was existential. The war in Ukraine, once a unifying force, had become a wedge. At first, we opened our doors. Gave shelter. Food. Hope. But now? After three years of rising prices, social strain, and endless right-wing propaganda?  Refugees weren’t people.

PiS-aligned outlets ran daily stories about border violence, “cultural clashes,” and alleged corruption in refugee assistance programs. TikTok was filled with clips of fake crimes, algorithmically juiced to enrage. And the *worst part*? The Coalition, posing as modern and tolerant, just started copying them.  Not openly, but you heard it in the new language. Words like “vetting.” “Resource allocation.” “Protecting Polish identity.”

The message from the top was clear: Don’t give PiS a way back in. Hold the center, no matter what. Compromise if you must.  And that’s how you end up with a political elite desperate enough to fast-track an entire corruption investigation not for justice, but for optics.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Then came ZK-Alpha.

A single soft ping on the office terminal, barely louder than the hum of the fluorescent lights above. It was 3:42 in the morning. We were all still at our workstations, exhausted but wired, too close to the finish line to let ourselves rest.

Magda , my friend from the analysis division and the one person I trusted completely in the Bureau, was polishing the final draft of the report. She’d been with me on this operation from the beginning. Smart, meticulous, the kind of analyst who could spot a laundering pattern buried in twelve thousand lines of ledger entries. Her eyes were bloodshot, but she kept typing. We were that close. I was across the room, double-checking the chain-of-custody documents for the asset seizure package : a list of bank accounts, vehicle registrations, and two warehouses flagged for forensic processing. Jacek, from Financial Crimes, was snoring lightly in the chair by the back wall, half-dressed, one boot still dangling off his foot.

Then the screen blinked. It happened so fast we almost missed it. White text on a red border, burning its way across Magda’s terminal, then mine, then every connected screen in the room. A system override. The kind that bypasses passwords, credentials, and protocols. The kind you’re not supposed to see unless you’re the one issuing it.

CASE CLASSIFICATION OVERRIDE: ZK-ALPHA  
Access Level Raised to 6.  
All Materials Transferred to Sector D/0.  
Operations Terminated.  
Further Activity Restricted.  
THIS CASE IS NOT IN YOUR JURISDICTION.

For a long second, none of us moved. Magda slowly turned her head toward me. Her bony fingers, with bitten nails and unrestored green nail polish, hovered frozen above the keyboard. Her lips parted as if to speak, but nothing came out. The color had drained from her face. I felt it too, that pressure in the chest, like the air had thinned. As if someone had cracked open a vacuum and sucked all the oxygen out of the room. And then, finally, in a whisper barely audible over the hum of the monitors, Magda said the words we were all thinking.

It’s her. It came from above.  From someone we couldn’t se From the one person in Poland who could kill an operation like Skylight with a single phone call.

The Matriarch.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Magda slammed her hands on the keyboard so hard that three keys flew off.

— What the fuck was that?

— ZK-Alpha, — she said, too quiet.

Jacek jolted awake, blinked at the screen, and muttered groggily:

— Did I just dream we got nuked?

— No dream, genius. — Magda was already pacing, hands tangled in her hair. — It’s gone. Everything’s fucking gone. Files. Backups. Logs.

Jacek stood up, wobbling slightly as he rubbed his eyes.

— This has to be a mistake. A misfire. Someone pressed the wrong button, right? They’ll walk it back.

— Who? — she snapped. — Who’s gonna walk back a direct override from fucking Sector D? Santa Claus? Fucking Ghostbusters?

I stared at the screen. The cursor was still blinking, a little digital metronome keeping time with the end of our careers.

— They told us to dig, — I said. — They gave us clearance. Oversight, Ops, fuckin’ Coordination Group. Two weeks ago, they were screaming for blood. *Get the Justice Fund clowns before they poison the vote.* Their words, not mine.

And now?

Now it was like we never existed.

Magda froze mid-step, her breath hitching.

— No. No, fuck that. She wanted this. I remember the language. *Priority status. Full tracking. Minimize exposure.* That came down her channel. Not PiS. Not some backbencher. Her.

The door creaked open behind us.

Mateusz walked in, half-dressed, still chewing something that looked like cold pizza.

— Why the hell are you all— What happened?

Jacek kicked the empty coffee bin against the wall. It hit with a hollow clang.

— We’re fucked, that’s what. ZK-Alpha hit us like a damn airstrike.

Mateusz squinted at the terminal, then at the three of us.

— You’re kidding.

— Do we fucking look like we’re kidding?! — Magda snapped, her voice cracked open and raw.

She yanked open a drawer, pulled out a half-empty pack of Vogue Menthols, and lit one with trembling fingers. The cherry glowed like a sniper dot in the stale gray air.

— I had a kid in Radzyń threaten to hang himself when we flipped his boss. You know how deep that trail ran? — Jacek was shouting now, pacing like a caged animal. — You think we just hallucinated all of it?

— I lost a source in Lublin, — Magda muttered, exhaling hard through her teeth. — Gave us a shell company with three confirmed connections to Nawrocki’s media fund. And then she vanished. *Poof.* Like she never existed.

Mateusz looked between us. He didn’t speak. Just stood there chewing slower now, his face blank.

There was a beat of silence, and then I said it, because someone had to:

— The Matriarch made the call.

No one argued.

Because there was nothing left to say.

Jacek spat on the floor.

— Kurwa mać… She’s playing both sides. First she lets us burn the PiS dirtbags so the press can say, *“See? This isn’t political,”* and then the second it gets close to Nawrocki’s campaign network? Boom. Curtain drop.

— No, — Magda whispered. — It’s worse than that.

She flicked the cigarette ash into her coffee cup, eyes locked on the floor.

— She’s not playing both sides. She owns the fucking board. That’s what we keep forgetting. Left, right, PiS, Platforma, Third Way — it doesn’t matter. We don’t work for the state anymore. We work for her ecosystem.

Mateusz finally spoke, voice flat.

— So what now? We just… forget?

— That’s what she wants. — Jacek’s voice was lower now, like a fuse winding down. — That’s what they all want.

I didn’t answer.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We didn’t get called into the director’s office.

He came down to us.

That never happens. Not unless it’s serious — the kind of serious where someone has to say *“I’m sorry”* out loud instead of sending it in a memo.

He stood in the doorway like a man walking into his own postmortem. Pale. Tie crooked. Collar wilted. His hands didn’t stop fidgeting, and his eyes looked like he’d been awake since ZK-Alpha hit the servers.

Nobody said a word.

— I want to be clear, — he began, voice low and clipped, — this decision didn’t come from me. It didn’t come from Oversight. It didn’t even come from Interior.

Magda crossed her arms, still holding the cigarette between her fingers. The smoke curled around her head like a halo gone bad.

Jacek sat on the edge of the desk, arms heavy on his knees, like someone waiting for a sentencing he already knew was coming.

Mateusz was standing by the whiteboard, stiff, eyes darting between all of us like he was the only one who hadn’t been told the punchline yet.

The director looked straight at me.

— You did good work. All of you. Better than expected. But the message came down this morning. No discussion.

He paused, like he didn’t want to say it. Then he said it anyway.

— Donald’s furious.

A beat.

— I mean *really* furious. Half the Council was ready to push it public — press, prosecution, the whole goddamn circus. Make Nawrocki bleed on live television.

Magda raised an eyebrow.

— And?

The director’s jaw tensed.

— They were told to stand down. Told — or *reminded*, I should say — that there are things in this country we *don’t* push.

— Reminded by who? — Mateusz asked. His voice curious. That was always the danger sign.

Magda swallowed hard. She said the name like it physically hurt to speak:

— The Bińskis.

And just like that, it was in the room. The weight. The chill. That sour taste in the back of your throat when something *bigger than policy* moves through your chain of command.

No one said anything. Not right away.

Except for still curious Mateusz.

— Who?

The kid looked genuinely confused. Poor bastard. First major operation, first all-nighter, first real lesson in how the country *actually* works.

Jacek let out a low, bitter laugh.

— You don’t know the Bińskis?

Mateusz shook his head slowly.

— Should I?

Magda turned toward him, her tone surgical.

— If you're lucky? No. If you're smart? You’ll pretend you still don’t after today.

The director exhaled and stepped farther into the room.

— Look, this isn’t some conspiracy theory. This is real. Every government since at least the '90s,  probably longer, has had an... understanding with them.

— What kind of understanding? — Jacek asked, not even trying to hide the contempt.

— The kind that says: *You don’t investigate us. We won’t interfere.*  
They don’t lobby. They don’t buy seats. They don’t play in the open. They just… exist and asking favors.

— And if we do investigate? — Magda asked.

The director looked at her. Not with anger — with exhaustion.

— Then you lose everything. Every case. Every contact. Every thread you pull gets clipped. Every warrant you file vanishes. People you trust stop taking your calls.

— So we’re just supposed to leave them alone? Like they’re ghosts?

He didn’t answer. He didn’t have to.

We all knew the answer.

Except Mateusz, who just stood there, still holding a half-wiped marker in his hand, like the whole thing had been a joke that no one explained to him.

Mateusz broke the silence first. He looked at all of us like we’d just handed him a blank map and told him to find his way out of a minefield.

— Wait. Hold on. This sounds like— I mean… is this some kind of fucking conspiracy theory?

Nobody laughed.

He took a step forward, gesturing vaguely toward the air like he was trying to grasp something invisible.

— You’re telling me one family has leverage over *every* government? That they don’t even need to run for office? They just… what? Sit in some mansion and call shots from behind a curtain?

— They don’t live in a mansion, — Magda said flatly. — They live in a yellow house with green shutters outside Starachowice. Three dogs. One SUV. Regular lawn. I’ve seen the property file. Nothing special.

— Then *what the fuck is this?!* — Mateusz snapped. His voice cracked just slightly, but it was enough. — Are they old PiS donors? Did they bankroll something illegal? Are they blackmailing Tusk? Like what — they’ve got kompromat on the president?

Jacek chuckled, but there was no humor in it.

— Kid, if they had kompromat, we’d all be reading about it in a TVN24 leak by now. No. They don’t blackmail. They don’t need to.

— Then *why the fuck does Donald listen to them?!* — Mateusz barked. — I mean, he’s not a saint, sure, but he’s not a puppet. He’s supposed to be one of the smart ones, right? He let us chase this case for six “jebanych” months. He wanted it done. So what the hell changed?

The director didn’t answer. He just leaned back against the doorframe and rubbed his temple like this wasn’t the first time he’d heard the question.

I finally stepped in.

— Nothing changed, Mateusz. *That’s the point.* This was never about new information. There’s no “reveal” coming. No smoking gun. The Bińskis don’t pull strings. They *are* the fucking string. They’ve been there longer than any party, longer than this version of Poland. And everyone knows it — in government, in media, in intelligence.

— Then *what are they?!* — Mateusz’s voice was barely a whisper now. — Lobbyists? Secret police leftovers? Generational oligarchs? What the fuck are they?

Magda’s eyes met mine. Then she looked at him.

— We really don’t know.

Jacek added, quieter now:

— And the worst part is… nobody tries to find out anymore.

Mateusz ran both hands through his hair, the kind of motion you do when you realize you're in the wrong movie, the wrong agency, the wrong reality.

— So that’s it? We just shut the fuck up? Let them kill ops and smile and wave?

Magda took a long drag of her cigarette, then crushed it into her coffee cup without blinking.

— Welcome to adulthood.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It was late summer 2022, and the evening clung to the garden like a heavy, invisible mist. The villa in Konstancin-Jeziorna, my father's pride, was filled with quiet, careful men. You could feel it, even through the slow jazz bleeding from the terrace speakers: a tension under every handshake, a tightness behind every smile. It wasn’t a formal gala, nothing that would end up in the press the next day. Just a “garden evening” — as the invitation had put it — full of important nobodies and nobody-important types, all orbiting the dying gravity well of the PiS government. Because make no mistake — the men gathered that night knew their time was almost up. The latest polls were brutal. The protests weren't stopping. Even their own grassroots were crumbling. The empire was cracking, and everyone could smell the smoke under the fresh-cut grass and imported champagne. And yet, they came.

Deputy ministers. CEOs of half-public companies. Senators past their prime.  
Ex-generals in tailored civilian jackets, still standing a little too straight.  
Even a few bishops’ emissaries, hiding their collars but not their eyes.  
And of course — the PiS elite. The ones who still thought they had another years in them. The ones too stupid to realize they were already ghosts. The ones too smart to admit it.

Something had shifted.

I didn’t know what yet, only that half the conversations were shorter than usual, and more people than normal kept checking their phones and slipping away early into the waiting dark Mercedeses lined up by the gravel driveway.

I was still a regular officer back then — nothing special, still on Warsaw beat duty most days — invited more out of courtesy than necessity. The son of a man like my father couldn’t just disappear from events like these without questions. So I drank the cheap scotch they handed to junior guests, kept my mouth shut, and stood by the window pretending not to listen.

It was while pretending not to listen that I heard it. The name.

Not shouted. Not even spoken loudly. Just floated, like smoke, from a conversation between my father and an old deputy minister of justice.

— Biński.

The deputy paused mid-sentence, looking around the room instinctively, the way a soldier looks before saying something that could get him court-martialed.

— You sure we’re cleared to say that out loud?

My father gave a small, tight-lipped smile — the kind you learn only after surviving thirty years in Polish politics.

— We’re not. But this one’s family.

The conversation shifted immediately, like a door slammed shut.

I didn’t ask anything then. Not in front of others. But it stayed with me, heavy and sour, like bad vodka in my stomach.

Later that night, after the last car had disappeared and the staff began clearing the glasses, I found my father again. He was standing alone on the back veranda, his jacket slung over the railing, sleeves rolled up, a glass of Belvedere Vodka sweating in his hand. The porch light cast his face in uneven gold, making him look older than he ever let himself appear during the day.

I approached quietly. He didn’t look at me as I leaned on the railing beside him, just stared out into the garden where the sprinklers whispered over the dark lawn.

— Who are the Bińskis? — I asked.

For a moment, I thought he wouldn't answer.  
Then he tapped his cigar lightly against the crystal ashtray and spoke without turning his head.

— Have you ever wonder why every government, no matter how different they pretend to be, ends up bending in the same places?

— That’s politics, — I said, maybe too quickly.

He laughed, soft and sad.

— No, Oskar. That’s pressure. And some of it doesn’t come from Brussels. Or Berlin. Or Nowogrodzka. Some of it comes from Starachowice.

I frowned. Starachowice?  
A small industrial hole in Świętokrzyskie? What the hell could come from there?

I pushed.

— So who are they? A company? Some old elite network?

He finally turned toward me, the porch light catching the sharp lines of his face.

— They’re a family, — he said simply. — Not flashy. Not oligarchs. You won’t find yachts or golden toilets. Upper-middle class, mostly. 40 to 60 members, depending on how you count the cousins and second wives. They keep quiet.

He nonchalantly sipped his Belvedere, the ice clinking softly.

— Their roots go back a long way. Before the war. Before the partitions even ended properly. The first one anyone remembers clearly was Artur Biński — born 1880, died 1994. Wealthy factory owner. Textile magnate.  Imagine Oskar Schindler if he hadn’t grown a conscience.

I blinked.

— 114 years old?

He smiled grimly.

— They tend to live long. Very long.

I didn’t know what to say, so I just waited.

He went on, almost to himself now.

— After Artur, there was Lucjan. Took over in '72. Quiet man. Ran the family like a private order. No noise, no scandals. Just… deep influence. He died three days ago, in case you hadn’t picked up the mood tonight.

— 109 years old, — my father added, almost respectfully. — And with his death, things will change. Quietly. Carefully. But they will.

I hesitated.

— Who takes over?

He exhaled, watching the smoke drift upward into the humid night.

— A woman. Celina Bińska.  
— Different kind of mind. Different kind of game.

He didn’t say more. And I didn’t ask.

Somewhere in the dark, a peacock screamed again — that raw, ugly sound that doesn’t fit in the civilized world, no matter how pretty the cage you build around it.

My father stayed silent for a moment longer, staring out into the damp dark, as if the answers to things better left alone might somehow be glimpsed between the heavy branches and the night mist. Finally, he spoke, voice low, almost detached.

 — They’re not our rulers, — he said. — Not in the way you think. They don’t issue decrees. They don’t march armies. They don’t bankroll elections or bribe ministers in parking garages.

 He turned his glass slowly in his hand, watching the ice swirl and settle.

— They’re more like a current in a river. You don’t see it. You barely feel it. But if you swim against it, it drags you under before you even know you’re drowning.

I didn’t answer. I didn’t know how. He continued, slower now, choosing his words like someone laying down stones across a fast-moving stream.

— Some people in this country spend their whole lives thinking they’re steering the boat. Presidents, prime ministers, billionaires. They make plans. Draft reforms. Declare wars, sometimes. And the whole time… the current just keeps moving the same way.

He tapped his cigar against the ashtray again, the motion practiced, almost unconscious.

— If you’re smart, Oskar, you don’t fight the current. You don’t even try to understand it. You keep your head above water. You build your life on the riverbank, far enough that you can watch without being pulled in.

I swallowed, feeling the weight of the humid night close around my ribs like a vice.

— What happens if someone tries to swim against them? — I asked.

My father smiled — not warmly, but with that grim, bone-deep knowledge only old survivors carry. Best case? You vanish. Quietly. A transfer. A resignation. A "personal decision to leave public life." The kind of thing no one questions because they all know better.

He paused.

— Worst case? You become a warning to others. And no one even says your name out loud again.

The sprinklers clicked off somewhere in the garden. The silence that followed was louder than the jazz from the house, louder than the distant hum of the city beyond the forest.

My father drained the rest of his glass, set it down on the railing, and finally looked me straight in the eye.

— Really Oskar, don’t think of them as villains. Don’t think of them as heroes. They’re not playing the same game as the rest of us.

And then, as if that exhausted whatever thin reserve of candor he had left, he clapped me once on the shoulder — not roughly, but heavily — and walked back inside, leaving the door swinging softly in the night breeze behind him. I stayed there for a long time, staring into the blackness where the garden ended and the woods began, trying to imagine a Poland that had currents you couldn't see and rules you couldn’t fight.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 I thought I’d buried it. That night on the veranda, the way my father’s voice dipped into something colder and smaller when he talked about the Bińskis. The way the conversation ended — not with an explanation, not with advice, but with a silent warning: don’t dig. I thought I filed it away forever, locked it deep under “shit I’ll never understand” — right next to Vatican finances and what really happened to that MiG crash in ‘96. But memories have a funny way of clawing their way back when you’re angry enough. And that night, standing under the dead buzz of fluorescent lights, staring at the empty, blinking cursor where Operation Skylight used to be, I remembered everything. Not scared. Not spooked. Just… pissed off.

Pissed that even my father, the always-on-the-top man who raised me to believe in facts, in work, in doing the hard thing, had folded like it was nothing. Pissed that for all their money, all their myths, all their careful, invisible hands, the Bińskis were still just people. Pissed because I wanted to be a good guy. Still. Even now. And when I looked around that wrecked ops room, I saw it in their faces too. Magda, chain-smoking with one boot braced against the wall, daring the ceiling to fall. Jacek, scowling at nothing, because nothing was all we had left. Mateusz, pale and stubborn, blinking too fast like he wasn’t gonna cry but maybe could’ve. They wanted the same thing. Not glory. Not revenge. Just to be good people in a system that didn’t want good people anymore. That’s why we did it.

That’s why Room C was born.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

That night, I couldn’t sleep. When I finally drifted off, the dream came.

I saw a veranda. Faded wood, creaking under the weight of late summer heat. Two young people, maybe twenty, twenty-two, sat there. A girl in ripped jeans rubbed her temples like she was fighting off a migraine. A boy in a tweed jacket scrolled lazily through TikTok shorts on his phone, half-listening.

The girl pressed her fingers against her temple, scowling.  
— My head hurts.  
The boy didn’t even bother glancing up from his phone.  
— Shocker. Maybe it’s because you think too much.  
— No, idiot. It’s different. There’s something out there. Something small. Rotten.  
The boy smirked, flicking through some mukbang short.  
— We have a new enemy? How cute.  
— It’s not funny. — She leaned forward, eyes narrowing. — It’s sharp. Focused.  
The boy stretched like a cat, completely unimpressed.  
— So what? Let the worms crawl. It's probably just Tusk and some of his peons are whinning. No one is stupid enough to attack us directly.  
The girl’s mouth twisted in something between a smirk and a grimace.  
— That arrogance will get you gutted one day.  
— Only if we let them get close. — He shrugged, finally looking at her. — Which I won’t.  
— You think old grandpa Lucek would’ve let his guard down?  
— Grandpa wasn’t perfect. — The boy grinned, cruel and lazy. — If he was, he'd still be here cleaning up after Mother’s messes.  
— Careful. — Her voice dropped, low and dangerous. — He knew how to survive without throwing tantrums.  
— Survival’s easy. — The boy slipped his phone into his pocket and stood, towering over her. — We just have to remember what we are. And what they’re not.  
He stepped off the veranda into the night, the wooden boards creaking under his boots. Over his shoulder, he added, almost lazily:  
— If they come at us, sis? We crush them, burn them, dig out children from the bellies of their wives by unsharp knife, whatever what'll be fun and games. Simple as that.  Wanna order some KFC?
