I pressed myself against the tunnel wall, waiting for The Wyrm of Yurg to pass. 

He would find me again soon. It was only a matter of time. I would go down one tunnel thinking I had lost him, only for him to appear around the next corner, an expression of utter torment on his wizened face as he reached for me, toothless mouth wide and salivating. 

He had relentlessly pursued me ever since our first encounter, where I lost my AR-15 without even getting a chance to fire it. One moment I was striding down the tunnel, confident in my firepower, the next he was bursting through a wall and all became a whirlwind of dirt and grunts and the overwhelming scent of moist flesh. 

I clutched my knife tightly as the earth itself vibrated. 

The Wyrm was here. 

I shielded my eyes from the falling dirt and managed to catch a glimpse of that pink tumor which pulled its segmented bulk with hundreds of arms much too small for its body. It went down a path I had ran down earlier and then was gone. 

I flicked my flashlight back on and jogged away. I knew I could outrun the creature, but he would never stop pursuing me. 

It was a war of attrition then. 

So be it. 

I have fought surrounded by smoke and sand beneath a burning sun, dehydrated and wounded while my team died around me. This was nothing in comparison. 

Sure, I was running low on water and didn’t have any more firepower. 

But at least I was fighting in the shade. 

I grinned and took a sip from my hydration pack, then set off on a steady jog. 

The more paths I went down, the more I realized my intel was outdated. Mister Fulcrum had been active down here ever since the Feds left. I found a host of attractions randomly scattered throughout the subterranean maze that were clearly an ode to the past. 

In one section I found a large playground filled with over-sized teddy bears at play. They were frozen in time on the swings, slides, and monkey bars. 

I didn’t care for how life-like their eyes were. 

In deeper sections of the playground I saw scenes of these teddy bears ‘bullying’ each other behind the big toys, in some cases going so far as to be outright ‘killing’ each other. A gold bear pulled the button eyes free from a smaller brown bear. A blue bear with leather pants shanked another while a group of other bears watched. Red cotton tumbled out of the wound and onto the wood chips. 

I saw even worse scenes as I picked my way through. I will spare you all the details. 

I spray-painted a mark near the next exit to remind myself I had been this way already and left. 

The new tunnel led me to a hallway covered with mirrors. I stumbled through, no longer able to tell where I was. Image and reality became a blur. My eyes could no longer reliably tell how far or near anything was. I think I lost about an hour in there and likely would have stayed longer had it not been for the Wyrm’s appearance on the far end. 

“Marcel,” he moaned. “Complete me Marcel…” 

I shook myself free from the illusion and started to shatter mirrors with my flashlight. The Wyrm flopped forward, his wispy beard trailing on the ground. 

I broke another mirror only to find that it was a doorway through a narrow corridor. I dived through right in time to avoid the Wyrm’s sudden leap towards me. He roared and reached through, his little hands unsuccessfully grasping for me. 

“Fuck you fatass,” I spat. 

The Wyrm wobbled back and then threw himself against the wall. It was like a bomb went off. A huge crack opened in the stone. He did it again. The crack got bigger. “You would feel so good in my belly Marcel,” he gurgled. 

I picked up the pace and fought down my panic as the rocks pressed against my body, forcing me to twist and contort. I hated small spaces like this. It reminded me too much of the closet my foster mother would throw me into as punishment. 

The path through the wall split off into three different directions. I ran straight down the middle. 

A bad idea. 

It took me to another dead end, but not an empty one. Here there was a concession stand that had bagged popcorn, bottled water, and different candies. It all looked fresh too. Manning the register was a blue-gray Furby with light brown eyes. At that point I would have liked nothing more than to grab a bag of those peanut M&Ms. Instead I punched the Furby, sending it flying. I was hungry but not stupid enough to fall for obvious bait. 

Fearing that the Wyrm was picking up on my tagging system I stopped spray painting the walls and followed pure intuition for some time. 

It seemed to work because after going through tunnel after tunnel for hours I hadn’t heard or seen the Wyrm. 

Exhausted after running for so long I decided to take cover by a carousel. It was the only 
protection within the wide cavern I now found myself in. I drank the last of my water and had some jerky. It had been over six hours since I first entered the tunnels. 

I closed my eyes briefly, but when I opened them I found that two hours had passed. “Damn it,” I whispered. It was a miracle that the Wyrm hadn’t found me dozing. Rolling my shoulders and stretching I stood, only to notice that the carousel was moving. 

Goats. Goats were riding the carousel. Goats with intelligent eyes and there were a dozen of them. Worse yet were their seats. They sat upon wooden people with bent backs and agonized faces. 

I pointed my knife their way and settled in a combat stance, ready to start dropping the fuckers left and right. 

They didn’t move. They were content to watch me while riding their wooden steeds. I walked backwards and didn’t stop until I collided with a wet mass of sweating worm-flesh. 

“You won’t be needing that,” the Wyrm said. He grabbed me by the knife arm and threw me up into the air. I shouted, flying higher and higher as my stomach did backflips. In the darkness I reached for something, anything, and then my hands closed around a huge stalactite. 

The goats hopped from the carousel over to the Wyrm. They formed a circle around the creature and began to dance hoof in hoof, their harsh laughter floating up to me. 

“Let go Marcel. You only delay the inevitable. And would it not be better for you to no longer be so alone? To be in me, always? It would take some time for me to digest you…but I could sing to you during that process…make it easier…make it last forever, if you would like…it starts feeling good after a while…”

My hands, slick with sweat, were slipping. I tried to hold on but it just wasn’t enough. I slid down the stalactite and nearly dropped, only one hand holding me up. 

I closed my eyes and repeated the names of my mother and father against the dark speech below. 

All my life I had held on. Held on to the point of suffocation. Constricted life by binding myself to the past. Cut everyone off and forced myself to face things alone like a fool. 

And where had that gotten me? Was hanging onto the edge of some fucking rock with a demon waiting beneath really where my parents wanted me to end up in life? 

Fuck it. Is this what I wanted for my life? To die like this? 

I looked into my very soul and knew I have never feared death. I only feared dying poorly. 

The sound of waves crashing against the shore rose. I breathed in and breathed out to their rhythm. 

Then I let go. 

I fell towards the cavern floor, the Visitor’s gift in hand. The awesome power of the sea coursed through the weapon as it flared with a brilliant golden light and lengthened. 

The Wyrm stared up at me, confused, and the goats ceased their dance. 

Remember how I mentioned my nickname was ‘Tyson’ back in the day? 

Well I had another: ‘The Hammer.’ 

I roared as a massive war-hammer burning with the glory of a thousand suns flared to life in my hand. I swung it at the Wyrm, sending a pulse of energy through all one hundred thousand pounds of him. 

He flew back as if he weighed less than a baseball and crashed against the far wall. 

Halos of flame and something…more…twisted about my body, energizing me with a power that I had never known before. I slammed the war-hammer against the floor and roared again. 

The Wyrm slowly rose and unraveled to its full height. It swayed on the tip of its tail, the many faces which ran along the length of its body howling. I realized that the worm-flesh was burning and peeling off. 

“You…you have been claimed already Marcel,” he rasped. “I will not quarrel with you any longer.” 

“I will burn this place down with you in it, no matter how far you dig, worm.” 

The Wyrm took one last glance at me before diving into the earth, “There are worse things than death, Marcel.” 

After he was gone, the war-hammer deactivated. I stared at the smooth cylinder for a while, yearning for the power to return. But I couldn’t force it. I got the sense that it was more of a companion than a tool. 

I gathered myself once more and continued on, this time with the knowledge that I was hunter, not prey. I felt powerful. Invincible. 

How does that old verse go? Pride comes before destruction, or something like that?

As it turned out, the Wyrm was right. There are worse things than death. 

You see, I had forgotten about something. But it did not forget about me. So while I slept, it crept out of my pocket, went up my torso, and paused right before my nostril. Then it dug in. Swam right up my nasal passage. Around then was when I woke, but it was already too late. 

The Finger seemed to cackle before it pierced my brain. I screamed. White-hot pain coursed throughout my body, causing my tendons to vibrate like plucked guitar strings and my bones to shake. Something came alive within my skull and shifted, exploring around before deciding that this was the right place. Then it split. It fractured into trillions of fragments that shot throughout my form, consuming me with the power that opens doors to places best left alone. This power was not my friend. It was cold shadow, alive in its own right, eager to commune and speak with the voices of the dead. 

I opened my eyes and saw that I had carved furrows into solid rock with just my hands. I also saw a clear golden thread leading down a distant tunnel. I followed it back to the cavern where I fought the Wyrm. 

There I perceived after-images of myself, the Wyrm, and the goats alternating along various paths. On some, the goats and I defeated the Wyrm. Along others, I was the Wyrm and someone else, a youth with light brown hair and gray eyes was facing me, sadness plain on his face. I knew I could spend a lifetime watching the minutiae of destiny, but I had to get going. 

Fulcrum was waiting for me.
