When Dad got sick and went to the hospital, my sister asked me to take over the building he managed while he was gone. I thought it would be simple: collect rent, fix the occasional leak, check on tenants. The building wasn’t much, an old five‑story brick place with peeling paint in the halls. Some days it looked gray, other days a sickly yellow that made the fluorescent lights harsher. Dad lived in an apartment in the basement, always tinkering with boilers and patching pipes. It smelled of rust, dust, and something sour, like wet rags left too long.

I got bored and decided to repaint his apartment as a surprise. Moving paint cans, I found a small leather‑bound book wedged behind a shelf. It was worn and dusty, the pages smelled of mold and ink. At first the entries were ordinary—tenants, repairs, notes about the building. Then came the passages about the rat.

The author, apparently the super of the apartment building years ago, wrote of shadows scuttling in the basement, a rat with strangely human eyes appearing in impossible places: on high shelves, behind walls with no holes. Traps never worked. Once he found a trap wedged between walls where no space existed. Another time, he found one of his traps that held a severed finger in place of the cheese he had baited it with. The diary devolved into spirals of symbols and glyphs that seemed strangely familiar to me as I stared. Where had I seen those symbols before? Then it struck me. I remembered my university days studying non‑Euclidean geometry. The patterns obeyed a twisted logic.

Curious, I took the book to my old math professor, Dr. Langley. She looked at the symbols, murmuring, “These aren’t random. They describe structures, not in three dimensions. Something else.” She asked to borrow the diary for study, which I reluctantly allowed.

Back in the basement, after stripping paint from the walls, I saw faint symbols etched beneath. They matched the diary’s markings. Near the boiler I caught sight of a rat, its eyes disturbingly human for a moment. I shook it off as fumes playing with my imagination and opened some windows to air out the place. Nevertheless I laid out a few traps and baited them.

Days later, Dr. Langley called me to her office again. She spread the diary open, dark circles under her eyes. “These describe spaces of at least thirteen dimensions. Not just describing but shaping them.” She faltered. “As if they were more than just theory... actual doors in the fabric of space. It sounds ridiculous, I know, but whoever wrote this journal apparently believed just that. The math here is incredibly complex.”

The next morning as I checked the traps, I gasped. The bait had been removed from one of the traps and a small gold ring was placed onto the mechanism. As if the rat were trying to bait me. I racked my brain all day trying to figure out who or what had done that. Later in the night, as I crawled into bed, there came a muffled snap beneath my blanket. An empty trap had just missed my toes. A shadow fled back into the walls. My phone rang—it was Dr. Langley. “I found something, a warning note, in the binding.” She asked to meet again but this time at a café near the university where she taught.

In the café she explained: the symbols at the back of the book weren’t decorations but sequences that, in theory, opened cracks in the fabric of space. The diary’s author described things he couldn’t comprehend intellectually but nevertheless had an intuitive understanding of the complex symbols. She whispered, “Your building isn’t just old. It’s porous.” I walked home deep in thought.

Later, my sister called. “Dad’s taken a turn. Come to the hospital quickly!” When I saw him he looked gray, smaller than I remembered. He stirred and coughed dryly. He rasped, “It’s the eyes… don’t look at them.” His words clung to me as I returned to the building.

Back at the apartment, I noticed the traps had shifted. Then I saw the rat, its red eyes staring back at me, unblinking. Then it fled into a dark corner, disappearing. I walked over to where the rat appeared and saw on the floor a chalk circle etched on the wood, with symbols, sharp and deliberate. Within the circle, a faint outline of a door appeared. Heart hammering, I pried it open with a crowbar. Beneath the door a staircase spiraled down into darkness.

I descended. The air grew heavy, metallic. The stairs wound deeper than the building should allow until the passage opened into a large cavern. At the far end stood a black‑stone altar carved with more, impossible symbols. Pressure throbbed in my skull as I stared. I turned to leave. For a moment, the beam cut across the altar and something small crouched there, tail curling. Two bright eyes fixed on me. Then they were gone.

I sealed the trapdoor at the top and called Dr. Langley. I told her about the door appearing where none had been before. “Is it possible for the symbols to manifest space?” She hesitated. “In theory… yes.” She wanted to see it and asked me to call her later. I agreed and hung up. That night I tried again, “Hello?” Someone answered. I didn’t recognize the voice. “I’d like to speak to Dr. Langley,” I said. “It’s important.” “This is her daughter Anna. Mother was bitten by a rat and seems to have an infection. She’s in serious condition in the hospital. Is this in regards to the notebook she was looking at?” she asked. “Yes,” I said.

Anna’s voice shook as she told me her mother had explained to her what the notebook meant. Everyone who had been in contact with the rat got sick. Worse, the number of infections seemed to be increasing around the world. The creature was somehow able to spread the disease worldwide but its means of transmission was a mystery. They could find no identifiable vector. Her mother believed the rat was somehow using the drawings on the walls to cross vast distances and spread the disease. Unless it was stopped, the disease would spread like the Black Death.

I thought of my father burning with fever. “What does she suggest we do?” I asked. “We need to find the animal and kill it,” Anna snapped. “Mom’s instructions were to trap the rat at the altar to prevent it from using the other dimensions to escape.” “Meet me tonight,” I said, and gave her directions to the apartment. Together we would try to lure the rat down to the altar and put an end to it.

We met at my apartment. Anna was an attractive young lady about my age, dark hair, slender but obviously fit. I showed her the stairs leading down to the altar. The crypt waited. Together we descended the stairs to the altar. The silence was suffocating. Finally we reached the bottom and walked over to the altar. “Now how do we lure that animal down here?” she asked. I tapped her shoulder and pointed to the staircase we had just descended. “I don’t think that’s going to be a problem.” I pointed my flashlight to the stairs, and there at the bottom stood a large rat with humanlike eyes. Worse, it had at least a couple hundred of its buddies, and they were all looking at us. “What do we do now?” I asked as the mass of these furry nightmares began to approach us like an army with our rat at the head. “Look,” she said, “above the altar.” She pointed her flashlight above the altar at a small crawl space. “Hurry, climb up into that alcove quickly.” “You first,” I insisted, “then me.” There was no time to argue and I was just clearing the altar as the rats swarmed below. Soon they were in a frenzy on the altar and leaping at my boots. We climbed into the crawlspace above the altar where a tight passage appeared and we proceeded on our hands and knees. After a long, tight crawl, the passage opened into a chamber. At its center stood a glass dome. Inside were two thin, greenish humanlike beings. They shrank back, then one whispered: “Help us.”

“Who are you?” I asked.

“Two centuries ago,” the alien said, “we were part of an exploration starship exploring this part of the galaxy when our ship crashed. We were the only two of a dozen crew members who survived. We were badly injured and should not have survived ourselves, but a kind young woman found us in the forest and brought us back to her village to treat our injuries. In gratitude for her kindness we showed her some of our science, how to use the outer dimensions to travel quickly anywhere in the world. But soon we noticed a change in her—she became cruel towards her neighbors. She was using our science to punish those who called her a witch. When we learned this we refused to teach her more. She grew furious and used what she had learned to trap us here. We weren’t allowed to grow stronger nor to starve. We have been in this limbo for two centuries now. At one point we gathered what strength we had between us and tried to use our science to kill her. We would have, but at the last moment her soul escaped into the body of a rat.”

Anna’s breath caught. The rat‑witch.

“How do we free you?” I asked.

“Sunlight,” he rasped. “Open the hole above. Only then can we break free.”

“But the rats,” Anna began. “We’ll never get out that way, there are hundreds of them on the altar. We wouldn’t stand a chance.”

“You won’t need to.” The alien pointed to chalk in the corner. “Draw what we tell you.”

For half an hour I traced symbols on the wall. With the last stroke, the stone rippled into a hole. We crawled through and found ourselves outside in the sunlight above a small pit. I ran back to the apartment for picks and shovels my father kept. For two days we dug until sunlight pierced down onto the dome. The moment the light touched them, the beings stirred, their strength returning. With a crack, they shattered the glass.

A piercing shriek tore from the basement. I spun back toward the building just as the lead rat staggered into view, its eyes burning with hate. Sunlight struck its fur and smoke hissed upward. It writhed, twisting unnaturally, then collapsed. For a heartbeat the air smelled of scorched hair and something older, fouler. Then it was gone. The swarm broke, scattering into shadow. The witch’s hold was broken.

That evening my phone rang—first the hospital, then another number. Both my father and Anna’s mother had made miraculous recoveries. The fever had lifted, the infection gone. Specialists were baffled. We knew why.

Anna and I walked through the city in silence, the streetlights buzzing overhead. At last she slipped her hand into mine. Her grip was strong, steady. We didn’t speak of the dome, the witch, or the sunlight that burned and healed. Some secrets bound us tighter than words.

Weeks passed. People often asked how we could afford the seemingly endless travel—Rome one week, the Great Wall the next. We smiled and said we’d won the lottery. The truth was simpler, stranger. When we needed money, we could step into any vault and fill our pockets. Maybe not the most moral lifestyle, but after what we’d faced, the world owed us. Besides, more than one homeless person woke to find a gold Krugerrand in their tent come morning. We did what we could.

Even now, as I look back on those nights in the basement, I wonder whether the shadows are truly gone, or only waiting. But I know this: Anna and I no longer mistake the ordinary for safe.
