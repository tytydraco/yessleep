“It's not that hard bro!” I said, “I know, just give me a second.” said Saul. We were in the forest, Saul was taking forever to climb up a rock ledge, and I was sitting up on top of the ledge looking around. We were boys, climbing through the forest for fun, as boys do. Saul finally got up the ledge and we continued our exploration. It was hard to see through the dense trees, but we managed. A few hours had passed of us trekking through the forest, it was sunset now, “We have to start going home.” I said. “Thank God, this is so tiring,” said Saul, There was a small clearing in front of us with the moon shining down making a glow, like the type you see in those stupid romantic movies. I walked into the clearing with Saul on my heels, I heard a quick gasp and turned around, Saul was nowhere to be seen. “Saul?!” I yelled. I traced my steps back, scanning the tree line for Saul then suddenly the ground disappeared out from under my feet, and my head slammed into something metal…

Saul was shaking me, “John? John wake up!” Saul yelled at me. My head was aching, I didn't know what had happened. I looked around, Saul was over me, looking relieved that I was awake. “What happened?” I asked, “Why the hell are you asking me!?” Saul responded. I looked around now that I had come to my senses, there was a deep hole above us. We were in a WW2-era bunker of some sort, everything was rusty, and…… blood, blood was everywhere. Saul saw my eyes widen and turned to take in his surroundings as well, “What the hell…” Saul said under his breath. There were skeletons, but these skeletons were torn to pieces, It was so gruesome, a skull was caved in, a person's chest was ripped open and so many other horrid things that I don't dare to remember. I got up and stumbled a little bit, Saul and I were huddled close together as we tried to avoid the bodies. Now that I look back on it we probably should have been more scared, but I think we might have just been in shock. We stumbled down a hallway without even communicating, we both knew there was no other way out. In the distance, there were tiny drops of water, like a leaky tap echoing down the hallway, and I flinched every time it hit the ground. 

In the hallway we were walking down there was even more carnage there were blood trails, like something dragged the bodies down the hallway. We stopped for a few seconds and sat down, “Are we just going to ignore all the bodies and blood?” Saul whispered, “Yes, that’s exactly what we are going to do.” I said. That's when we heard it, a deep growl echoing down the hallway. Saul looked at me his eyes wide with fright, “What the hell was that!?” he whispered, I didn't answer him, I wish I did because that growl, that deep horrible growl was the last thing he ever heard. From the darkness down the hallway, a huge hand about the size of Saul’s face emerged from the darkness. I didn't have time to say anything, it grabbed Saul by the chest, and I heard the horrible crunch of his ribs being crushed. Saul screamed, a horrible shriek. As that thing pulled him into pitch blackness and he kept screaming, and I had to listen to him as the thing ripped him to shreds, I was helpless. Just staring into the darkness, listening to my best friend, wailing as the thing from the darkness finished him off.
