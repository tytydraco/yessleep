[My Grandpa Knows David Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/u/ThatGuyWhosAfraid/s/lqQT2csSB0)

I am unsure how to start this final post, or even how to go about writing this entire thing. It’s been awhile since my last post on David so I suppose I should start with what came after it.

It was my Grandpa, Justin, and me, sitting around the dinner table with plates full of food prepared by Grandma. We did not speak much. All of us, maybe not Grandma, were thinking about David.

It was a good meal.

Time would pass by as the five of us ate. My grandmother talked the most out of us. She would tell Justin how great of company he was and how grateful  that Justin and I were close friends. Of course the two of us let out a small giggle at the comment, we were close but not ‘close’ I suppose.

After night fell, Justin and I retreated to the guess bedroom. The silence remained. The two of us would just look at our phones, waiting for something to happen, for David to show up. Justin, being bored, opened up his Tik tok. There was little noise coming from our room. It was the first time I let myself relax for a moment. I allowed myself to slowly fall into a sleep.

Must have been around 8 when I fell asleep. I woke up around 3 or 4 hours later, checking the clock on the wall. 1 in the morning. Justin must have fallen asleep right as I was waking up as his phone was still playing a video as he slept with the one lamp in the room on. The scene before me was just like one of our sleepovers as kids.

I had a few notifications on my phone. Most of them were just updates on the games I had on my phone, one or two of them were just telling me that some famous people I followed had posted, and I had a lot of messages from my Ex. That was a bit strange as we basically cut contact after David attacked me. I unlocked my phone, read a couple of messages, the first one being from a hour previous and the latest being from one minute before. 108 messages were sent to me in that time.

I rushed out of the house, only having time to pick up a few things. As I left I screamed back inside the house where I was going. I hoped for it to wake someone up.

12:59 Help.

It was expected at this point that David would strike again, I just didn’t know who. I hoped it would be me, I wanted to be attacked again, but that girl who cheated on me? Who hurt me? I wanted to just leave her to defend herself, I wanted to pretend like I never got those messages, but I couldn’t. I just couldn’t let her be killed. I hate her, don’t get it twisted, but I wouldn’t wish death on her. It would haunt me.

It was a short drive from my Grandparents to Janes’ place.

I only had a few weapons, the Six Shooter, a Rifle, the knife that my Dad got me for my 12th birthday, a bottle of hairspray, and some weed Justin left in my car. For the sake of this situation, I just grabbed the Six shooter my Grandpa gave me, and the knife. The Rifle would be too heavy, and the other items were not even mine- hell they wouldn’t even be useful. I mean, David only has so much hair, and I doubt we could talk things out through a smoke sesh.

I was parked in the driveway. The entire neighborhood was silent, not even the bark of Janes’ neighbors’ dog could be heard (an annoying little mix between a chihuahua, maltese mix who was always up till three). Walking around the house to the back, I find where David got in. I almost didn’t believe it, the fucker climbed up to the second story of the house. I can tell he broke in by the torn screen and shattered glass.

‘Hey fucker!’ I scream into the dark home, ‘Come down and fight me like a man!

It wasn’t my brightest moment, but it helped shake a bit of the nervous feeling in my bones. David also didn’t come down, I almost thought the house was empty.

I received a message on my phone from Jane asking if I have a death wish. I texted back to mute her phone as I wanted to FaceTime her, to see what she was seeing. After a second, she FaceTimes me.

She was hiding in one of the closets in her home. It was hard to tell which one, but when she put her phone camera up to the slit separating the two doors, I could tell she was on the first floor by the staircase leading up into the second floor. Through the camera, I could see David slowly walk past her as he came near a window, he was peaking out.

I look up from my phone, there he was. He was smiling, and I was frozen. I could see into his mouth again and just like last time I was left in fear.

David was not from this earth.

David quickly began to shut all the curtains and blinds in the house. From the outside, it looked as if they all shut at the same time. I peak down at my phone to see David moving at an impossible speed before stopping by the back door. He was waiting for me to come in. It clicked in my head.

I don’t know if David had a concept of technology, but he understood human behavior. He understood and kept up with human behavior as the generations grew and made technological advancements. This attack on my ex was just like a man using an elk call.

I was being hunted.

David was the one apex predator to surpass humans.

All of the questions came running back, why let me live this long? Why not kill me as a kid? Why now? What is preventing him from breaking down that door and killing me here?

What is David? And what does it want from me?

I look up at the back door.

It was either my time to die, or my time to avenge all of those who came before me. I had unknowingly ran into a trap where only one of us comes out alive.

I make my way back to my car carefully and quietly. I was still on call with Jane, David didn’t move at all. I was worried about my phone or Jane’s phone being broken like how the cameras from home corrupted when recording David. But they were fine. I grabbed the rifle, pause for a second, grab the hairspray and Justins’ things. I wanted to make sure I wasn’t missing anything- I needed to know I wasn’t missing anything.

I exit my car for a second time a just stare at the house.

There was no place for me to enter without David knowing, In every situation I think of, it involves noise. The front door is locked, all the windows are closed with screens on them, and David was already at the back door. If I wanted to get in with a fighting chance, I would need to be quiet.

I could enter from where David entered?

Impossible with my height.

I look at the ground, I notice a few large rocks, flowers, and other useless things. Things looked grim.

If Jane wasn’t inside, I would try to burn the whole place to the ground.

Would fire even work?

Dam it.

I am not a hero, nor am I am not the heroic type. I want to go home and sleep in my own bed knowing my mom and dad are near. I hate this.

I hear the roll of a car coming down the road, the headlights illuminating every house. It wasn’t until the car parked next to mine did I realize that It was Justin’s car. I make a shush finger, Justin immediately picked up what was going on. I hang up on Jane sending her a message saying Justin was here.

Silently, Justin exited the car. We whispered, unsure if this thing had superheating, I hoped not.

“Do you have any idea on what to do?” Justin whispered.

“Nope.”

“Fuck. Is it out for blood this time?”

“I think so.” I answered this question with a bit of hesitation.

“Why?” Justin asked. I had that same question. I have seen how David moves, how he runs, his strength, his everything. But it only left me with more and more questions, why why why?

I looked around again, looking at everything that I could grab. I checked Justin’s car as well. There were several household items he had yet to unpack. Apparently he was at Walmart when the events of my last post happened, he was ready to go home when he received my call.

Me and Justin went over everything, and we had a plan.

The house was silent as we set this plan into motion.

The whole idea was to get Jane out and to safety, then Justin and I would figure out how to kill David. Justin would hopefully get David’s attention and stall him outside the house while I got Jane out of the way.

In an attempt to get David’s attention, Justin would break a window furthest from where Jane was. If David attacked Justin, I would barge in and get Jane the hell out of the house and out of the way. Justin would have the rifle I brought and attempt to blast David into oblivion. If David was still standing, I had something prepared.

“You understand you could die?” I ask Justin.

“This thing has haunted our town for generations, killing families for hundreds of years. If I have a small chance of bringing David down then I am taking it.” 

“Remind me not to take you gambling.” I respond

Justin let out a small giggle, not too loud. “I’m surprised you can joke at such a time.”

I was too. And I agreed with what he said. While I may never have been the heroic type, while I might be scared shitless, I had to do this.

“God speed,” I say, walking into my position.

“Don’t be so corny, smart ass.”

It was around 2 in the morning, a hour had gone by since I had first gotten here. My heart started to speed up, thinking about David. The horrors I saw, the pain I felt, everything David had done. I don’t believe in destiny or fate, but standing there waiting for my signal was one of those moments where my non belief might had faltered. David had been watching me since I was a kid, now here I am as an adult waiting for our final confrontation.

I hear the glass shatter from the other side of the home, I slip through a window, breaking the screen down. David was distracted by Justin, thank fuck, I could tell by the gunfire.

I find Jane, right were I last left her on call.

She was alive.

But there was something different about her. I grabbed her arm and pulled her out the way I came in from. I told her to get out of here, that I would deal with this situation. There was something wrong with Jane.

But I had no time to waste, I couldn’t waste time figuring out what she needed. In retrospect, I wished I had stopped for just a second to ask her what was up.

I run back to where Justin was, the gunfire stopped and I feared that David had already killed Justin. I grab the plan B, just in case.

As I turn the corner I see the two of them, Justin laying yards away. He was bruised and bloody. David turned towards me. David was shot several times, but very few shots broke the indestructible skin that David had. The car light from Justin’s car illuminated David from behind.

I could barely make out his injuries, the shadow David cast was intimidating. 

I wip out my six shooter, I aimed all six shots to where I thought David’s smile would be. I think maybe one of them hit, but that did not stop David. He let out a primal scream, as he quickly shuffled towards me.

I ran into the house, David following behind me, crashing into the door frame.

I ran into the bathroom quickly locking the door as I finished preparing my plan B.

Aluminum is a highly reactive material accessible to the common man thanks to aluminum foil. Of course, aluminum wont react to the food you cover with it. Those chemicals that do react to aluminum will not be found in the food you eat (if you cook right). Another thing to note, you never mix chemicals when cleaning because you can accidentally create dangerous situations.

I was going to purposely create one of those dangerous situations.

I had an empty bottle, already filled with aluminum foil that Justin had purchased. I knew Jane had the cleaning supplies that I needed to create an explosion.

There was a thud that hit the bathroom door.

As quickly as I could, I begun filing the bottle of aluminum with cleaner, praying that It wouldn’t react too soon, or too late.

Another thud.

I put a lid on the bottle.

Another thud, this one almost breaking the door.

I jump into the bathtub carefully.

David breaks the door down, splinters going everywhere. Simultaneously I throw the bottle at David, ducking for cover in the tub.

The explosion was louder that I thought it would be, I must have used way too much materials.

A bright flash took over the bathroom for a brief moment. A loud ringing sound took over my hearing.

My eyes were still adjusting, but the I could see David’s shadow laying on the ground.  I had no time to waste, I pull out a lighter that Justin used whenever he smoked, and grabbed the bottle of hairspray left in my car.

I rush over to David, his skin looking red and a little burnt.  I shake the hairspray, aimed-

Nothing came out of the hairspray.

It was empty. Of course.

Before I could go back into the bathroom and grab one of the other bottles that Jane had, David thwacked me. His long arms sending me flying across the home.
 
The adrenaline was still pumping through my body, I crawled, trying to get outside, but David was stronger than I was.

David stood back up, stumbling and clearly in pain, he made his way to my broken body. He lifted me up, my eyes more adjusted, I see what the bomb did to him.

It wasn’t just his mouth shifting this time, all of his skin as well. 

“You… prey… challenge…” The words coming out of David, his mouth was unmoving like a ventriloquist. The voice came straight from where I assumed his vocal cords would be.

I struggle to speak a sentence in a response, “what do… what do you want from me!”

Before David, or Johnson, or the amalgamation of ever changing flesh could respond, several shots rang out into the air. Multiple holes appeared in the shifting skin. Out of those holes a blood like substance poured out like a fountain. David dropped me, his screams became less animalistic and more human, he turned around to see Jane with Justins gun.

David rushed her, she fired more shots.

I grab a few spare bullets from my pocket.

David became a difficult target to shoot at, he was faster and nimble compared to an hour ago. Almost intaintly David reached Jane.

I watched in horror as in one swift movement, David killed Jane.

I dropped two bullets out of the three I had. David turned to me.

It was all happening so fast but everything seemed to slow down for me figuratively.

Anger, Sadness, Fear.

I took a breath, David took a step.

This was one of those moments where my non faith in fate faltered. This encounter was several years in the making, I had one bullet- one last shot to correct the hurt and pain that was inflicted on my grandfather, Justin’s upstairs neighbors, the man who told my grandfather about Liver Eating Johnson. This was Justice for Sheridan Wyoming. My home.

I took another breath, David took a step. He opened up his mouth, his mouth opened and turned his entire body into one large mouth, rows and rows of teeth following the mouth that now consisted of his stomach. I raise my gun, aiming for the head.

I pulled the trigger, and prayed.

Simultaneously, knowing that there was nothing left I could do, I laid down and passed out.

I would wake up to live another day.

My grandfather told me about everything that happened while I was passed out.

First thing he told me, I killed David.

Jane’s neighbors all called 911, rightfully so, about gunfire waking them up. Police and paramedics show up to find Justin half dead, Jane dead, me three quarters dead, and an unidentifiable corpse. It looked like a mound of flesh and bone according to my grandfather.

The second thing he told me was my own condition.

Justin would make a full recovery, he would just be in the hospital for awhile. But I was paralyzed from the waist down. 

I knew the risk of fighting David. For my bravery, god seemingly gave me a second chance at life in exchange for my legs.

The third thing was about legality of what I did.

Thankfully, there is some sort of officer high in ranking who knew about my grandfather and how his kid was taken away from him. There will be no legal issues that will affect me and Justin. This last situation is being written off as a bear attack. 

It is the last ‘bear attack’ that will ever be documented.

So that is it. David is dead. I don’t think I ever will get closure on some things. Things like why David waited so long to attack me, how did he live as long as he did, who was David in the first place.

But that is alright with me.

It has been a week or two since I got out of the hospital, I started writing this last post yesterday. Jane’s Family came down from New York to gather her things and plan a funeral for Jane. They stopped by my parents house where I will be staying, probably for longer than I ever thought I would, to say hello and goodbye to me.

We had a long conversation about Jane and I, and what our relationship was. Apparently Jane did cheat on me, but felt terrible. Calling her mom about the mistake she made. But that is neither here nor there. I thought about telling them the true story, what really happened, but decided against it. They don’t need to live the horror that I had.

On a brighter note, once Justin had gotten out of the hospital, he made his entire house handicap accessible. I told him not to but he insisted. He says that I am welcome to stay if I am sick of my parents taking care of me. I think I might take his offer. It would be nice to live somewhere else.

I suppose that this is the end of my story with David. I apologize if this isn’t the ending that some of you expected or wanted. But that is just how the cards were dealt. I guess If you ever plan on going across Wyoming, come down to Sheridan, it is a beautiful small town with a bright future.
