You know, I found 6-7 funny at first. Absurdism is the name of the game when it comes to memes, viral videos, or *any* entertainment on the internet. Who remembers that GIF of the roflcopter: an ASCII helicopter built of ROFL blades, backslashes, and underscores?

That was twenty-five years ago.

Brainrot is an old phenomenon, so if you were expecting me to call 6-7 a signifier of the end times, keep scrolling. This isn’t that story.

This is the story of my nephew, Grant.

Grant did not like 6-7. He didn’t like most things. He was a troubled boy, to put it mildly, and the signs of his burgeoning anti-social personality disorder were plain for years. I still remember the beastly smile he wore when, at eight years old, he “accidentally” toppled a pot of boiling water onto his mother. The signs of ‘psychopathy’, if you like, were there for years. But we brushed them under the rug.

Now our lives have been forever changed.

It happened in June, on the thirteenth birthday of my son, Richie. His mother, Jodie, and I were hosting a gathering at our house with classmates and relatives.

“Hey, Dad, tell Owen the joke you told me the other day,” my son begged. “The one with the numbers.”

I was surprised. Richie *wanted* me to be embarrassing in front of his friends? I foolishly leapt at the chance; rabbit, meet snare.

“Sure!” I said eagerly. “Why was six afraid of seven?”

Owen giggled. “Six-seven.”

The two of them hit me with that meme’s accompanying two-handed gesture, as if they were shifting the balance of a weighing scale.

But 6-7 was new to me. “Huh?”

“Don’t worry about it. Finish the joke, Dad,” urged Richie, whose face was red and puffy from stifled laughter.

I raised an eyebrow. “What did I say that was so funny? I’ve not even got to the punchline yet… I’ll try again. Why was six afraid of seven?”

“*SIX-SEVEN!”* called out my niece, Allie.

There came cackles from everyone but her older brother, Grant.

“Stop it,” he cautioned her.

Their mother—my sister, Tessa—chimed in with a sigh and explained the situation to me. “Grant and Allie have been fighting about those stupid numbers all week.”

Richie muttered under his breath, “Yeah, ‘cause Grant’s a weirdo.”

I shot him only a half-stern look. I agreed. But I would have called him far worse. The last time my nephew had visited our house, Socks the Cat barely survived. The poor feline came hurtling out of the kitchen in a panic, bearing a burn mark in his fur; explained by a cigarette stub found in the outside waste bin. Despite his parents’ best efforts, Grant smoked. Everyone knew that. He was the only smoker in the family.

Tessa assured me nothing like that would ever happen again, but I’d known for years that something was wrong with my nephew. It wasn’t a phase. He was innately broken. Had been from birth. And neither Tessa nor her drunkard of a husband, Pete, had ever been able to bring their brutish spawn under control. In fact, the boy’s father hadn’t even bothered to come to the party that day. He’d given up on Grant.

Honestly, given that wicked and unfeeling smile on the boy’s face, I don’t blame them.

They’re not the only ones to blame, anyhow. Hurting animals? That’s always the sign of worse things to come. I should’ve put a stop to it after he maimed Socks.

I shouldn’t have let Grant back into my home.

“Come on, Dad,” said Richie with a giveaway grin. “Give us the punchline.”

I rolled my eyes, but I obliged, knowing full well that I was playing into whatever inside joke the children were brewing. “Okay. One last time: why was six afraid of seven?”

“*SIX-SEVEN!”* Allie yelled again, drawing further giggles; again, from everyone but her big brother.

“*I TOLD YOU TO STOP SAYING THAT!”* Grant roared, twice as loudly as the little girl.

Then the sixteen-year-old boy backhanded his nine-year-old sister across her crown. Allie yowled and started to sniffle, whilst the other children gasped at the foul display of violence. They scuttled away from the older boy in fear.

“Grant, stop it!” said Tessa in a feeble voice.

The boy ignored his mother and slapped Allie again, so forcefully that she fell onto hands and knees, looking up at me tearfully. I am ashamed to say that only then did I notice the uneven colour of the girl’s face; the slightly darker shade of peach around the eye, which I presumed to be concealer. *Only* around the eye.

She was covering up something.

As my sister trembled at the sight of her own son, I looked towards Jodie, who was whispering into her phone; calling the police, I imagined. She’d threatened to do as much when Grant hurt the cat. I was proud of her for taking action, and I kicked myself for not doing anything to help my sister those many years, so I climbed to my feet. Better late than never, I suppose.

“Right!” I shouted at Grant. “You. *Out*.”

Tessa didn’t tell me off for reprimanding her son. She looked relieved, if anything, that somebody had finally stood up to him. The sixteen-year-old, on the other hand, simply scrunched up his face and grimaced at me.

“I won’t ask you again, Grant. This is my son’s birthday party, and you’re ruining it. Outside. *Now*.”

To my surprise, upon being asked a second time, the boy did as I asked. He let me march him to the front door, with his mother and sister in tow. He *let* me. I must reiterate that. I may well have struggled to overpower him. He was of a similar height and build to me. Six feet tall and broad-shouldered. I was glad that he didn’t kick up a fuss.

Now I think, as with Socks, this was all part of his game.

He wanted us to go outside.

“David…” Jodie started.

“Two minutes,” I told my wife as I led my sister’s family out of the front door.

“Right,” I heard her say with faux-steadiness. “Come on, everyone. This is a party… Who wants to, erm, play a game?”

With Tessa and Allie hiding behind me, I shoved Grant along the driveway towards their car.

“Go easy on him, Dave,” my sister said. “He’s just a boy.”

“That excuse won’t fly anymore,” I snarled, before reminding myself to direct my anger at Grant. “You’re a little monster. You think it’s a game to hurt animals? To hurt your own *sister*?”

Grant eyed me with ferocity. In all honesty, that eased me a little. It had always been his *lack* of emotion which terrified me, so I decided I’d take rage over his typically cold demeanour.

“We’ll… We’ll go home now,” Tessa stammered, fumbling for her car keys as she and Allie shuffled around to the car’s front doors. “I thought we would have a nice time… Allie really wanted to see her cousins. I… I’m sorry, Dave. I’m so sorry.”

“It isn’t *you* who should be apologising,” I said, before jabbing a finger into Grant’s chest.

“Don’t touch me, Uncle David,” he warned.

“You don’t like that? Imagine how your sister feels.”

Grant whispered, “I told her not to say 6-7.”

“This isn’t the first time, is it?” I continued. “I see the concealer around Allie’s eye. Covering up some bruise you gave her, no doubt.”

Tessa’s eyes widened, and she shook her head at me, cautioning me against taking that route.

Too late.

Grant’s face shifted, and I realised I’d been a fool to cherish those wrathful eyes; to be grateful for a sign of emotion in the boy’s face, fiery or otherwise. That didn’t make him human. The fury in those empty brown eyes may have been a blaze, but it was a blaze in a blizzard; a futile spark of warmth in the implacable cold.

My terror returned as I reminded myself what I’d always known:

This boy was hollow.

“A bruise?” said Grant. “No. I gave Allie a cut.”

Before I responded, there came pain.

Searing, crippling pain in my lower abdomen. Multiple waves of pain, in fact, and I gargled a wordless cry of primal fear as I looked down to see the teenager repeatedly plunging a small knife into my gut.

I staggered backwards after he retracted the blood-stained switchblade the fourth or fifth time. Then my knees juddered, and my legs gave out. I was lying on my back on the driveway. Limp. Helpless. Able only to lift my head slightly to look forwards. I thought I was about to die as that boy approached me.

The worst part was that he didn’t say a word as he towered above. Neither did I; terror paralysis, I think. I heard my sister and niece sobbing at the car, and I tried to croak out for them to drive away to safety, but my voice failed me. And then my eyes widened as Grant put his switchblade into his pocket and knelt beside me, stale teenage breath puffing down onto my face.

“Why was six,” he began, tapping me on the chest, “afraid of seven?”

Tears trickled down my cheeks.

“Answer the question, Uncle David.”

I shivered. “B… Because…”

The boy cut me off by lunging down; driving his teeth, as if they were not canines but fangs, into my neck. I screeched out in agony as the pain, perhaps worse than the knife blade, tore through my body.

“Dave!” screamed Tessa, and I heard her running towards us.

As she thumped her son helplessly on the back, he stopped mauling my throat, and I let out a cry of relief. My gut and my neck throbbed, and I could feel warm blood trickling free. I struggled to crane my head forwards, but I looked up in time to see the teenage boy square up to his mother, then hurl her to the lawn.

The rest happened in a flash.

I didn’t see it all, but I saw too much. I saw Grant plunge that blade into his mother’s eyes, one by one. Heard her screams. I’ll never *stop* hearing them.

I don’t know whether I fainted from blood loss or the horror of witnessing the attack, but I don’t remember much after that. I think I may have heard the blood-curdling cries of people and police sirens before losing consciousness.

Thank God for Jodie’s 999 call, and thank God the police station is only a two-minute drive from our house.

I woke with a start in the hospital, and it took plenty of reassuring words from my surrounding family members to realise that I was safe; I was no longer trapped in that horrifying moment on the driveway. The terror passed.

The trauma, I fear, is to stay.

I blubbered when I learnt that my sister survived, but was savagely blinded by her son. The responding officers managed to stop Grant before he hurt anyone else. The boy was sent to juvenile detention for aggravated ABH, which is a joke, as it was evidently attempted murder. He’ll likely be out in a few years. The judicial system isn’t equipped to deal with children like him. It’ll try, but it’ll fail. Grant will not be rehabilitated.

He’s evil, all the way [down](https://www.reddit.com/r/dominiceagle).
