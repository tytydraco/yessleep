Seeing ghosts isn’t always a scary thing, especially if you’re like me and you’ve noticed them since you were a little kid. I must have  been around 8 years old when I met my first otherworldly friend. I remember waking up during the night to the sound of her footsteps moving softly past the door to my room. It always made me feel a sense of calm and warmth. She was a kind woman, a bit younger than my parents, who loved to sit in the rocking chairs on our front porch while she stared up at the night sky. We never talked much, but I never felt the need to. Her clothes were old fashioned and looked a bit like a maid’s uniform. I think I assumed at the time  it was a costume, but now I believe it was just the work clothes she wore while she was alive. 

For a long time, I wondered if she had been a dream or perhaps some sort of elaborate imaginary friend. However, as I got older I began to meet more ghosts in less easily deniable circumstances. I’d meet them in places like libraries, coffee shops,on the bus, anywhere you might have a quiet moment where the living didn’t demand your attention. I don’t know if this is the case for other mediums but I find it’s easier to try and understand them without speaking. It’s not that they can’t communicate verbally, it’s more that they’re a bit like deer. If you push to hard, move too abruptly, or speak above a whisper you risk seeing them vanish. It makes sense looking back; these were relative strangers who had no real commitment or connection to me. I don’t think they really expect to be noticed or paid much attention to. 

I explain all this first to try and help you understand just how different -she- was. To explain how a quirky but normal part of my life managed to become the nightmare people tend to picture when they think about ghosts haunting someone. 

It was at a party that I noticed her first. I’d met a few spirits in settings like this before and that made sense to me. At a lot of parties it’s  easy to slip in unnoticed and perch like a wall flower away from any dance floor or games. -She- was at the outer edge of the party, but she wasn’t observing passively like other ghosts typically did. It was clear from the moment I felt her presence that she was there with a purpose. I had first felt the hairs on the back of my neck stand up, which then caused me to swivel to see what had piqued my anxiety. We made eye contact and I felt the pit of my stomach drop instantly. Her irises were a piercing, almost glowing electric blue color . The bruises on her face and blood shot sclera only made that blue stand out more.  Her pupils were noticeably different sizes, like she had some kind of concussion. She demanded my complete attention, as if that targeted glare was the only thing in the room. That was not the look of a lost traveler, no she was here for a purpose and that purpose had something to do with me.  I desperately scanned my memories; did she… know me somehow? 

I must have looked like I was having some kind of silent anxiety attack because next thing I knew a friend’s firm hand squeezed my shoulder.

“Hey you ok?” 

I shook my head, trying to reset myself. The girl was gone as quickly as she had appeared but that look felt seared on my brain like branding iron. 

“Uh yeah sorry, must be Hailey’s edibles, I can’t believe I took two.” 

My friend laughed, “I told you not trust her math about the dosage! Come on, let’s go grab some food to keep them from knocking you out completely.” 

I let my friend grab me by the hand and lead me towards the kitchen. I was completely sober so far that evening but at least now I could pass off any weird things I did on something else. I don’t tend to talk much about seeing ghosts, even with people I’m close to. It’s just not worth it most of the time. They never actually get it and I know I’ll probably just be made fun of. However at that moment I was considering breaking my unspoken rule. That spirit had genuinely freaked me out for the first time, and I couldn’t shake the feeling that something awful was going to happen. For the rest of the party I stuck close to my friends and tried to focus on their faces. I hoped that if they found it too weird they’d just assume I was stoned or drunk and zoning out. 

That night, she followed me into my dreams. It was like watching a home video tape of my life, complete with fast forwarding, rewinding and random skips. She’d show up in the background looking at me, the child version of me specifically. It was an intense, fixated stare, like she was mentally making notes and recording every detail. I felt like I was frozen in place, like I was paralyzed. I couldn’t scream, I couldn’t move. I couldn’t do anything. I could only watch.

I woke up drenched in sweat, and I saw a too human shaped shadow behind the dresser. Had the ghost just been watching me sleep from there? I picked up my phone, planning to put the emphasis on the doom in doom scrolling. My dad had texted me at about 2am. All it said was “call me.” I had to take a deep breath. Texts like that are never good news. 

My dad picked up on the first ring. He sounded as exhausted as I felt. He reassured me about the safety of my family after I babbled several disjointed questions. There was a distinct pause before he said softly “it’s you I’m worried about.” I tried to laugh it off, and insisted I was fine. He didn’t argue, he just asked me to meet him at the bar by his house. We’d grab dinner like we use to and talk. I hesitated, but he insisted it was important so I agreed. 

After work I got on my usual bus, and sure enough, the ghost was already there. I wondered if she’d learned my schedule or if she’d been following me all day. I’d thrown myself into my job and managed to literally keep my head down the whole 8 hour shift. If she had been there, I had to believe she was just another grumpy person in the crowd. In that setting I got a lot of angry looks from the living too. 

The bus was quieter, though, and mostly empty. Which meant I had far fewer distractions to keep my mind occupied. At least she had chosen a seat near the back, so I could sit up front with my back to her. The intensity of her expression was bad enough, but she also clearly resembled what she’d looked like just before her death. I’d never seen that before and never wanted to again. I could tell something horrible had happened; her skull was  noticeably fractured, swelling and drenched in blood.  One of her arms hung loosely at her side, dislocated at the shoulder. It was her leg that was the worst part, though. Part of the bone jutted out at an angle, with a sharp, clearly splintered end. 

Something about her glare was starting to feel tangible, like somehow her eyes were generating an icy air current. It was August, so I tried to pass off the sensation as just a fluke of the bus’s AC. I didn’t want to think about how powerful she might be and what she was capable of doing to our material plane. I’d really never met a spirit like this before and I felt thoroughly out of my depth. She made me feel helpless  and out of control in a way that definitely was getting to me.

When I got to my stop, I exited the bus and heard uneven footsteps behind me. For a split second I tried to convince myself it was a normal human that had gotten off, but then I felt that icy chill again.  I wanted to shout and tell her to fuck off already, but didn’t want to make that kind of scene in public. All I needed to make this day worse was to have the cops called on me. It was as if my spectral stalker knew this, because she seemed to move closer. Now I could hear that the footsteps were falling perfectly in sync with mine. I might have thought it was an echo if I didn’t know better. I definitely did not appreciate her skills at mimicry, even with her shattered leg. 

As I stepped off the curb to cross the street in front of the bar, something odd happened. It sounded like the poltergeist had stopped . I didn’t dare pause or glance in her direction until I got to the door, but there my curiosity got the best of me and I just  had to know. Turning slowly, I studied her new behavior. She was leering at me, yes, but there was a new frustration in her expression. Like she was trying to calculate something. I kept my eyes fixed on her as I pushed the door open and entered the bar. 

My dad was waiting in a back booth and waved me over. He asked me about my day and if I’d slept alright. I was honest that no I hadn’t slept well and that today had been hard, but I didn’t tell him why. At least at first. My dad is the kind of person that wanders  through conversation topics so I barely noticed when he got on the topic of my childhood home. “We found out one of the two sisters who lived there at the time worked as a maid up the hill.“ That caught my attention. “Wait what was her name again?” “Hannah” I mouthed her name as I remembered my childhood ghost. My dad must have seen the recognition dawn on me because he said softly, “I always thought you could see her too.” My eyes widened as I looked at my father. He nodded silently for a moment. “Yes, I also see spirits.  Where did you think you got this from?” I didn’t have an answer to that so I just asked him to tell me more. 

My dad explained that he’s also seen spirits since he was little, but it wasn’t until Greg died that he was able to do much with the ability. Greg had been  dad’s best friend. He was a volunteer fire fighter that was killed in the line of duty when I was little. I knew the loss had been hard on my dad so I appreciated hearing that Greg was still bringing him comfort in some way. It also made sense to me that Greg wouldn’t have let death stop him from helping those around him.  “Did you know he always liked this bar, and we’d go out drinking together here before you were born. I think this is one of the places he still spends time.” I remembered my unknown ghost stopping at the street corner and wondered if Greg had something to do with that. Nothing else had seemed to stop her yet, so maybe Greg was the difference. 

“Listen Honey, I don’t want to scare you but something happened recently and Greg and I think it’s important to talk to you about it. I might have accidentally gotten you involved without intending to.” 

“What’s going on?” I couldn’t keep the fear from entering my voice. 

My dad took a moment to collect himself. It was clear whatever he had to talk about was difficult. 

“A few days ago, I was volunteering at the community center, like I always do on Thursday. We were outside in the garden that afternoon…”  He swallowed, pausing for a moment as if  struggling with how to phrase what he had to say next. 

“I heard the screech of the tires and a loud thump. I must have been the closest because I got there first. You know Greg taught me what to do in emergencies like car accidents so I kneeled down beside the young woman who was laying in the road. She must have hit her head pretty hard because there was already blood matting her hair. It looked like it was coming from her ears too. When my volunteer supervisor showed up I told her to call 911. The other volunteers tried to calm down the driver and assess if she had any injuries. I kept talking to the young woman, trying to get her to stay with us. I asked her about herself, she struggled to speak but she said her name was Angie, she lived near by. It was when she said she was your age, that hit me hardest. I couldn’t stop thinking of you. But I… I couldn’t keep Angie awake. She stopped speaking and went unconscious by the time the paramedics got there. A few days later I learned from my supervisor, that Angie had passed away. I already knew because her spirit had come to me first. She was so angry. Silent but just the kind of pissed off that radiates off a person. I felt like… I don’t know quite how to describe it? Like she rewound my memories of her accident. She stopped the film when she saw me thinking about you and I guess kinda zoomed in on it.” He shuddered as if thinking about it still creeped him out. 

“It’s like I could feel her latching onto you. Greg was watching this happen, as by that point he could tell something was up. He told me that Angie was angry her life was stolen from her. She was angry that you were still alive, still happy, still able to live out the rest of your life.” My dad paused, he was grimacing. 

“I don’t know Rachel, I think she’s gonna try to  like, live through you somehow. I don’t know if she can steal your body or anything that drastic, I don’t think she knows if she can either, but I know she wants to.” 

Silence hung between us as I stared down at my food, unable to move, unable to speak, barely able to breathe. I felt tears pricking at my eyes.   

“Dad, what the hell do I do? She’s been relentless, I can’t… I can’t keep doing this.” I didn’t dare ask the question I wanted to. -What if it never stops?-

“I… I don’t honestly know.”

I covered my mouth as I let out a choked out sob. I was grateful my back was to most of the bar. 

“Greg thinks he can help you, but he can’t do it through me. He needs to talk to you.” 

I shook my head. “I don’t… I’ve never tried to… it’s up to the ghost isn’t it? I’ve never like tried to summon someone before?” 

“I don’t know a lot, but I do know we have more control than they do. You’re going to have to reach out. “

“But -how-?” My voice was louder and sharper than I meant it to be. I could see in my peripheral vision a few near by bar patrons midwesternly averted their gaze. Awkwardly I swiped at my eyes with my shirt to dry the tears. 

My dad shrugged dramatically, “some of the old traditions must have a bit of truth to them right? I know he still like scotch.” 

I covered my face with my hands and groaned. My least favorite part of ~adulting~ was realizing how often your parents were just making shit up as they went along too. 

“Wait,” my dad interrupted my already whirring thoughts, and I peaked at him from between my fingers. He was grabbing his wallet. I dropped my hands and watched him.

“Here,” he held out a worn out card, it was the jack of clubs. I gingerly took it from him and looked it over. Before I could ask for clarification he added,
“That was Greg’s lucky card. From the deck we always played with.” 
I could tell the emotional weight the card must carry for my dad. It was with reverence that I gently tucked it into my own wallet. 

“Understood,” I said softly 
My dad was sheepishly avoiding my gaze as he shrugged again. “I know it might not be enough but it’s all I got.”
I reached out and touched my dad’s arm. “I’ll figure it out, one way or another. I promise.” 

By 3am, I was starting to regret that promise as I sipped at an energy drink. Not that I really needed it; fear was keeping my heart rate up high enough that I feel every fluttering beat. Adrenaline was screaming at me to run, to fight, but there I was, quietly  considering  different arrangements of candles. 

I wasn’t normally awake at this time, but I wanted to do everything possible to skew the odds in my favor. The rituals I had been  frantically  scrolling through seemed to largely agree this would need to occur during the so called witching hour from 3am to 4am. 

I had scotch out as my dad recommended. It look me hours of digging through storage to find the  Philadelphia themed shot glass I’d been given. Greg was from Philly, and there was a chance the glass had been his at one point, or at least a gift from him. I’d also driven almost an hour to find the one place close to me that sold any Tastykake product so I’d have a proper food offering. 

I kept myself frantically and consistently busy so my eyes wouldn’t dart to Angie’s lingering form hovering over my shoulder. She was now finding ways to mess with electronics, and the flickering lights were threatening to trigger a migraine for me. However I persisted. This was my best shot, and with her gaining more strength by the hour, I tried not to think about how it might be my only shot. 

At about 3:20, a thunderstorm began to roll in. I heard the rain and thought about how fitting it was. I left my window open (to give Greg some options when it came to entering my shitty little apartment), and could smell the summer night air filtering through. It helped ground me, and drew me back to the summer evenings spent in my backyard while Dad and Greg relaxed and played poker with their friends. I closed my eyes and took several deep breathes before beginning. 

The first step, I had decided, was to place Greg’s card upright, leaning against the scotch and snack cake. The figure appeared to shift slightly in the candle light as I stared at it. 

Next I rose to my feet, and walked to my front door. I opened it all the way and called out, “let all who wish me well enter.” (I’d chosen that phrase to keep Angie from getting any big ideas.) 

I stood there for several minutes, my hand nervously gripping the knob. My neighbors would definitely think I was some kind of crazy wannabe witch after this. But honestly I was coming to terms with the fact that that  assumption might be fair, I mean I was literally trying to work with a ghost right now. For a second I could swear I smelled cologne. That had  to be a good sign too right? Greg had always hated the way you can’t wash off the smell of smoke the first time, so he wore things to cover it up when he was out with his friends. It had been a long time but still that smell felt intrinsically right. I waited until the smell shifted, and then gently closed my door before returning to my dining room table. 

“Greg Hanson, I ask you to please join me at this table,” I gestured to the chair I’d pulled out across from me. It felt so formal and uncomfortable to speak that way but that was what the experts online insisted on. A cold gust came through the window. The candles all flickered and threatened to be snuffed out. Greg’s card was blown over, so it lay face down. I began to frantically shake my head. 

“No not you! Stop it!” I yelled reflexively reaching out and pulling the offerings away from what I assumed to be Angie again. I picked the card back up and held it in my now trembling hand and stared at its little face. I couldn’t keep doing this  ritual. It wasn’t working. I had to try something else. Anything else. 

“Greg, please, I don’t know what I’m doing. She won’t stop, I can’t make her stop. I’m so scared.” I couldn’t stop the tears that were now freely flowing down my cheeks as I let myself sob. “Do you remember that fourth? I must have been like 5. I was holding a sparkler. You told me… you told me not to touch it, but I just had to. It was so beautiful.” My vision was starting to blur but something told me I had to keep looking at the card. I used my shirt to messily rub at my eyes like a child would. “You… you told me it was a burn. God I must have been screaming so loud but your voice was so soft. You were so nice to me even though I did something bad. I asked how you knew what to do and you said it was your job. You told me you protect kids like me everyday. You help them when they’re scared like I was.” 

I hadn’t noticed at first, but the room was now noticeably warmer. I couldn’t tell if it was the tears, the movement of the candles, or something else but the small figure seemed to shift again. Their expression looked just as warm and kind. It gave me an idea. Moving the offerings so they were next to me, rather than across the table, I shakily got to my feet and looked for my deck of cards. 

“I also remember when you taught me to play solitaire. You said it helped you clear your mind,” I said softly, sniffling occasionally as I shuffled and tried to collect myself. I dealt out the cards and took a deep breath. Turning to the spare card I said whist fully, “I’ll try to come up with a way for us to play poker, I always wished I had been old enough to join in, but they stopped playing once you were… gone.” 

My attention was fixed on the cards, as I began to catch Greg up on what he’d missed. I told him about how my brother and sister were doing. I told him that dad had been married again for a year when I was 10 but it didn’t work out. I told him about how I’d failed out of college, but I was going to try again at the community school up the street in the fall. I told him everything you’d tell your godfather after not seeing him for 20 years. 

I must have fallen asleep on the table because the next thing I remembered was my dream. I was still yammering on about my family, and I saw Greg just as he was. Angie was there again too, sitting in the chair across from us.  She was still clearly upset, but now resembled a version of what I imagine she looked like before the accident. 

When I woke up. The shot glass was empty and turned upside down with the card on top of it. I couldn’t find the tastykake at first but then I noticed an empty plate near where Angie had been sitting. I couldn’t help but laugh. 

“I hope this is a truce Angie! You took the peace offering, that means you agree to be peaceful!” 

The cool but gentle breeze from the window brushed against my arm. Shaking my head and making my way to the kitchen I murmured, “Greg and I will hold you to that.”
