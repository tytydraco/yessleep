The last thing I remember is the knife.  

But let me start earlier.  

It was raining that night—the kind of cold, needling rain that soaks through your clothes and pricks your bones. I’d stayed late at O’Malley’s, nursing a whiskey to avoid going home to my empty apartment. The bartender, a grizzled guy named Walt, kept glancing at the door like he wanted to close up. “Last call was an hour ago, pal,” he’d grumbled, wiping down glasses with a rag that smelled of mildew. I tossed a twenty on the bar and stumbled into the alley, shortcutting toward my car.  

Big mistake.  

The alley reeked of dumpsters and wet asphalt. A flickering bulb above the back door spat feeble light, casting long shadows that seemed to *twitch*. I’d taken three steps when I heard it—the crunch of a boot behind me. Before I could turn, an arm hooked around my throat, squeezing until my vision pulsed with black stars.  

“*You*,” a voice snarled. Hot, sour breath hit my ear—whiskey and rotting teeth. “Think you can talk to my girl? Think she’s yours?”  

I didn’t even know who he meant. The new waitress? The woman who’d sat two stools over, laughing with her friends? My lungs burned as I clawed at his arm, my nails scraping over tattooed skin. He laughed, low and wet, and spun me around.  

His face was like a nightmare. Pockmarked and covered in scars with a spiderweb tattoo crawling up his neck. One eye was milky white, blinded, the other a sharp, hateful blue. “Pretty boy,” he spat. A switchblade flicked open in his hand, its edge glinting under the dying street light. “Let’s see how pretty you are when I’m done.”  

The first stab went into my gut.  

I’d never felt pain like that—a white-hot *rip*, like he’d unzipped my insides. I gagged, tasting bile and blood. He yanked the blade out just to plunge it into my shoulder, pinning me to the alley wall. I screamed, but he clamped a hand over my mouth, his fingers digging into my jaw. “Shhh,” he hissed. “Don’t wanna wake the neighbors, do ya?”  

He worked slowly. Sadistically. The knife dipped into my thigh, my side, my chest—not deep enough to kill, just enough to make me writhe. Blood pooled in my shoes, warm and slick. I tried to beg, but all that came out was a wet gurgle. I knew I liked to flirt a little when I was drunk, but c’mon, did I really deserve to die for it?? 

He leaned in, his ruined eye inches from mine. “She might’ve smiled at *you* tonight,” he whispered. *”But she’ll scream when she sees what’s left.”*

The final cut was the worst. He dragged the blade across my throat, slow, savoring the split of skin. I felt it—the *pop* of something vital—before the world tilted. My knees hit the ground. The rain diluted the blood, washing it in pink rivulets toward the gutter.  

The last thing I saw was his boots stepping over me. “Sweet dreams, pretty boy.”

I woke up choking on dirt.  

My lungs burned. My fingers clawed upward, nails splitting against rocks and roots until I burst through the soil like some grotesque seedling. Moonlight glared down, cruel and bright. I rolled onto my back, gasping, my shirt stiff with dried blood and mud. The grave was shallow, half-hearted, dug beneath a gnarled oak at the edge of the city’s forgotten cemetery.  

That’s when I heard the whimper.  

A stray dog—mangy with visible ribs pawed at the edge of the grave. Its eyes glowed yellow in the dark. Instinctively, I reached out, my hand trembling. “Hey… it’s okay,” I rasped.  

The moment my fingers brushed its fur, the dog *seized*. Its legs stiffened. A gurgling sound bubbled from its throat, and then it collapsed, tongue lolling, eyes clouded like marbles.  

I scrambled back, heart thrashing. The corpse began to… *rot*. Flesh sagged, fur sloughed off in clumps, and within seconds, all that remained was a greasy skeleton and the stench of decay.  

“What the *fuck*?” I whispered.  

The wind answered. Not with words, but with… *voices*. A chorus of them, hissing like static, overlapping, urgent.  

***Kill.***  

***Kill them all.***  

***Feed us.***  

I clapped my hands over my ears, but the whispers slithered into my skull anyway, oily and insistent. My head throbbed. I stumbled toward the road, my legs jelly, my hands leaving smears of grave dirt on street signs. The world felt tilted, wrong.  

The first person I saw was a jogger. Pre-dawn, neon vest glowing. He nodded as he passed, earbuds in, oblivious.  

My hand grazed his arm.  

And with that he dropped mid-stride, faceplanting onto the asphalt. His body convulsed once, twice, then stilled. Skin grayed, peeling like wet paper. The whispers purred.  

***Yes.***  

***More.***  

I ran. Or tried to. My feet carried me to the 24-hour diner on 5th, the one with the sticky booths and coffee that tastes like burnt tires. A waitress stopped in her tracks as I staggered in—*“Honey, you look like hell, what happened?”*, she exclaimed as she reached out to steady me.  

Big mistake.  

Her fingers touched mine, and her smile melted. Literally. Her face sagged, eyes liquefying, teeth clattering to the floor like Chiclets. The other customers screamed. So did I.  

The cops came. Of course they did. Officer Ramirez, a local cop who’d pulled me over more than once, drew his gun. “Hands where I can see ’em!”  

I raised them, trembling. “I didn’t—*I don’t know what’s happening*”

He grabbed my wrist.  

A wet *crunch* echoed as his bones turned to dust inside his skin. He crumpled, uniform collapsing into a sack of meat and rot. The whispers roared now, a hurricane in my head.  

***Don’t stop***  

***No mercy.***  

***We are hungry.***  

I fled into the streets, a monster in a dead man’s skin. Every accidental brush—a homeless man’s shoulder, a woman’s purse, a child’s stray ball—left corpses in my wake. The news called it a bio-terror attack. The National Guard quarantined the city.  

But they can’t stop me.  

The whispers guide me now. They’re *louder* when I kill on purpose. When I *lean into it*. I stand on rooftops and watch the chaos below—sirens, fires, bodies piled like cordwood. My fingers drum against the concrete ledge, itching to touch, to *feed*.  

I don’t sleep. Don’t eat. The hunger isn’t in my stomach.  

It’s in my hands.  

Last night, I found the man who murdered me. He was holed up in a motel, watching the news, a bottle of Jack in his fist. I didn’t say a word. Just pressed my palm to his sweaty forehead and watched his eyes burst like overripe grapes.  

The whispers laughed.  

They’re right, of course. This isn’t a curse.  

It’s a gift.  

So here I am, walking down Main Street, arms wide, fingertips grazing everything—mailboxes, car doors, screaming faces. They fall like wheat under a scythe. The air reeks of spoiled milk and copper.  

And the whispers?  

They’re singing now.
