My father was a pretty easy going person. He was always the “fun dad” who’d get my brother and I what we want from McDonald’s or take us to the arcade downtown over the weekend. We’d play catch in the backyard and go hiking in the Green Mountains that always stood as the backdrop of my childhood. He was a very outgoing person and active in our small town community. He coached my baseball team and sometimes stood in as an Assistant Scoutmaster for our local troop; Troop 191. I looked up to him a lot, more than maybe most if I’m being honest with myself. Definitely more than my brother Sean. And now I look back at how my father was, especially during my most formative years, and I wonder how exactly he did it.

He was the owner of a local security company. They’d set up cameras, alarms, the whole nine yards. They also provided guards and watchmen services. As far as I’m aware these jobs were few and far between. It was fairly rare that any person or place really needed protection in Harmon. Our police force had a total of five members and they were all part-timers other than the chief. What I didn’t realize as a child was my father’s company was farther reaching than Harmon’s vague borders with the wilderness that surrounded it. 

They were contracted across the state, across New England sometimes. Again, most of this was alarm and camera security system work. Glorified electricians essentially but they were good at what they did. The watchmen positions only became available every once in a blue moon. And that was only because my father rarely took those jobs. He didn’t even have dedicated employees for the work, simply hired freelancers looking for a quick buck essentially watching cameras in an office for 8 hours a night.

Things started to change after the recession however. People didn’t have the money to splurge on expensive security systems. My father knew we would struggle if he didn’t make changes. And soon what was the outlying limb of his business became its core. People needed work, more and more properties were being neglected and abandoned, and my father saw the opportunity to capitalize on both. 

I remember he started coming home later than usual, sometimes I didn’t even see him until the next morning. Frankly I was too young to really know what was going on. Sean might’ve been more aware but I’ve never talked to him about it. As I grew up I learned little bits and pieces of the night watchmen my father employed and the places they were hired to guard. He’d usually have some funny story to tell of the nightly reports he had come in. Sometimes there was nothing he’d tell me, however. When he got home he’d simply drop his coat off in the mudroom and brush past my brother and I towards my mother with nothing but a shallow smile. I would watch my mother wrap her arms around him and they’d quietly walk into the next room, away from our prying ears and my prying eyes.

As I grew older and all through high school, I was asked by many of my classmates if my dad could get them into one of the many properties which they surveyed. I’d always say no of course, my father was very adamant about how dangerous those places were. He’d always say “We aren’t protecting the property from people, we are protecting people from the property.” And anytime anybody I knew would try to make it past the watchman, they would end up in my father’s office by the morning. Despite usually having known them since they were 5, Harmon was a small town after all, he never hesitated to let the police teach them a lesson. That included my best friend Devin, who lived two houses down from mine.

Devin was probably one of the worst offenders if I’m being honest. I never dared join him on any of his expeditions but once he got a car he was gone pretty much every single night. He was a smart kid, far more intelligent than the normal crowd that would break into any of the places my father’s company surveyed. As a result, he got away with it. He wasn’t there to trash the places though, just explore from what I was told. He’d show me pictures he took off his camera during lunch at school the next day and to be honest, I didn’t really understand the appeal. They just seemed like abandoned buildings. Dirty, dusty and probably dangerous. My father’s words were still etched into my mind. Devin always defended his expeditions however, despite the risks he took to achieve them.

After high school I honestly didn’t know what to do with myself. I tried my hand at community college but that didn’t go far. Looked into the trades but I’ll be the first to admit I wasn’t built for the blue collar lifestyle. After six months or so, in the spring of 2018, my father offered me a job.

“Hey kiddo, can I come in?” He asked, knocking on my bedroom door. I swung around in my desk chair, pausing the game I was playing.

“Yeah of course” I replied with a bit of hesitation. I knew this conversation was coming. It had been months and I’d been stuck working at the local Urgent Care behind the front desk. A carry-over from my short interest in pursuing medicine. It wasn’t the most glorious work, and sometimes it certainly wasn’t pretty, but I was comfortable there. He sat down on the bed across from me and folded his hands, letting out that sigh that always came before your parents said something you didn’t want to hear.

“Adam, we need to talk about where you’re going.” He said plainly.

“W-what do you mean ‘where I’m going’”?

“I mean where you’re going, what you want to do with your life, college, career, anything at all. I-I hate seeing you just wasting your time here.” He elaborated.

“Dad, I have a steady job, I’m just figuring out what I want to do.” I said as sternly as I could muster. It was a weak attempt.

“You told me that back in the fall, it’s May now son. I gave you your time. Now I just can’t watch you waste your time anymore.” My father admitted.

“What are you trying to say?” I asked with a bit of hesitance.

“I want to give you an opportunity, since clearly you aren’t pursuing one yourself.” He finally spit out. “A job, working for me.”

“Dad no I’m not-” He quickly cut me off.

“Adam, listen, it’s better pay then you’re getting. Hell it’s better pay than your brother is going to get once he finishes school. It can be the start of a career for you. Or at the very least, you can start saving some real money for the future. And it’s easy work, you’ll have plenty of time to ‘figure out what you want to do’” He tried selling me, even repeating my own words. I shut my eyes for a moment and exhaled.

“What’s the job?” I asked begrudgingly, knowing this was less of a choice than he was making it out to be.

“Night watchmen. Five days a week, eight hours each day. I’ll even let you pick your days off.”

“I thought you didn’t want me going to those places. Aren’t they dangerous after all?” I questioned, trying to use his words against him. He rolled his eyes.

“I know what you’re doing, son. And you’re not a kid anymore. Plus you’ll be there legally, not trespassing like your friends. I’d be handpicking your assignments anyways, I won’t have you going-”

“If I’m going to take this job, I don’t want any special treatment Dad.” I argued. “You offer me this job, I will go where you’d send any other watchmen.” He didn’t respond for a moment, clearly not having a quick counter like he did for anything else I’d said up until that point. 

“I um… i-if that’s what you want.” He finally stumbled out, less assertive than before. His demeanor had completely changed in those few moments. Any confidence he conveyed had eroded severely. He looked at me with eyes that told me to fight the offer that he himself had just been arguing for. And I looked back at him with a new sense of cockiness, like I'd somehow beat him at his own game. I barely even thought about what I was doing. I knew my job was dead end anyway so I didn’t see much stake in keeping it. Maybe this was a smart idea. My father had always had my best interest in mind, he wouldn’t have ever offered this to me if he thought I couldn’t handle it. But then again, I had thrown in a term that he did not offer.

“I’ll do it.” I agreed simply, giving him a smile. He nodded silently, slowly rising from the bed and walking towards the door.

“Alright I’ll let you put your two weeks in then um… I guess we’ll get to work.”

“Looking forward to it, Dad.” I told him. He bit his lip, looking like he was holding back something as he shut the door behind him. I didn’t think twice about it, more interested in returning to my game than my father’s minute facial expressions. In my own defense, I was 19 and I was stupid.

After I’d finished up at the Urgent Care, my father started me out shadowing one of his other watchmen. His name was George, an older man in his early 60s. He had bushy grey hair with a matching mustache and always wore a shirt and tie to the job, despite my father insisting to me that just a solid black shirt and pants would do fine. George took his job seriously but he seemed happy to take me under his wing when my father explained the situation. 

I worked with George for two weeks, watching over the light bulb factory that had closed about 10 miles outside of Harmon. I remember people talking about it the first couple of years after it closed, Devin went a couple of times. But I guess the owners were tired of the place getting broken into and my father was the man to call. 

George explained all the odds and ends of the job, when to interfere, when to make the call to the police and how to use the camera system in the security trailer. Admittedly, upon first impressions, this might’ve been the easiest job of my life. The first week, nothing happened. And I mean nothing. George started letting me lead the perimeter walks, camera setups and system checks but other than that, we sat in that little office all night long. It took a bit for George to start talking but once he did, I barely got a word in. It made the nights fly by, the man telling me his life story night after night, in almost chronological order. He had plenty of time after all, we weren’t going anywhere.

The second week, I had my first encounter. I had graduated from leading perimeter walks to soloing them. George assured me he was watching me the whole time and we had walkies if anything went wrong. I wasn’t too worried though, the place had been dead all of the last week. And this week was shaping up to be no different. 

I rounded the corner of one of the old brick buildings into a courtyard before stopping dead in my tracks. Through the open window on my left, I heard the crackle of broken glass and the shifting of dust over the concrete floor inside. My heart dropped for a moment before I tried to regain my composure, pulling out my flashlight and shining it through the window.

“Is somebody in there? This is security.” I said as seriously as I could pull together. I waited for a moment but got no response, not a sound. I let out a sigh, pulling out my radio.

“Hey George, I think I’ve got someone inside building 5.” I dispatched.

“You need a hand, kid?” He asked in a scratchy, gruff voice.

“I um… I’m going to check it out myself. I’ll let you know, alright?” I decided, starting to walk towards the ajar door to the left of the window. “Also they’ve got to secure these doors.”

“I’ve been saying that for months. Alright just watch yourself in there, Adam. Remember these places can be dangerous.” He advised. “I can be there in 2 minutes if you need.”

“Got it, will do.” I answered quickly, clipping the radio back to my pocket and pulling open the old metal door. I stepped up to the factory floor and found the space completely void of movement. Void of sound. Void of life. It was dark, dank and water pooled where the ceiling leaked. Old equipment was still bolted to the floor and made the vast space feel like a maze with only my flashlight to guide me. I called out again.

“This is security, if you’re in here I’m going to find you. This is private property and you’re trespassing.” I said, repeating another one of George’s lines he’d taught me. My words echoed off the distant walls of the space, making me feel even more isolated and small. Despite it being a pleasant 65 outside, inside it couldn’t have been higher than 40. I shivered as I stepped further into the moonlit space, surveying every nook and cranny I could find. A shiver went up my spine as I crossed into the next room. It might as well have been a clone of the last but it felt noticeably different. Colder and heavier, even more decayed. I heard the sound of the debris swishing under my feet as I walked. Dust, chipped paint and glass crunched as I inspected the room the same as the one before it. As I came to a stop and looked up at one of the massive pieces of machinery, I realized something was seriously wrong. While I was standing still, the sound of my footsteps kept going without me. And this wasn’t an echo, that would’ve only lasted for a couple of seconds at most. This was clear, it was close, but slowly it sounded as if it were moving away. I stayed completely still, my heart pounding as I listened to the sound step around the machines, onto the catwalk with its distant metal clank, and back down to the factory floor on the other side of the room. Then it came to a standstill and the room returned to silence. I finally turned my head, my flashlight shaking in my hand as I crept around the corner. And there, standing at the far doorway into a long dark hallway, was the silhouette of a man. 

He stood completely still, almost like a cardboard cutout. I shined my light towards him but the beam seemed to almost dissipate before it made it across the room. Despite what George had told me time and time again about confrontations, I had to admit I was terrified. As I slowly walked closer I had to keep reminding myself that it’s just a person.

“S-sir you can’t be here. This is p-private property.” I stumbled out, completely failing to deliver an intimidating tone. I got no response from the man. His silhouette stayed exactly in its pose, standing almost inhumanely straight up. Even as I approached him, my flashlight’s warm glow still wouldn’t reach him. I tried whacking the battery compartment to get a little more juice out of the light but all it did was kill the light completely. I tried to stay calm as the silhouette watched me from the doorway. I frantically tried sliding out the batteries and reinserting them, my eyes dashing between my hands and the silhouette. Screwing the cover back on, I flicked on the light to find the figure was gone. 

“H-hey, stop fucking with me. We’re gonna c-call the cops and you’re going to be charged with t-trespassing.” I warned in a futile state of panic. I turned around in circles, shining the light on any and every surface of the room. He hadn’t gone far, he couldn’t have. I didn’t even hear his footsteps and it had only been a moment. I finally rested my eyes back in front of me and there, just as I’d left him, was the silhouette of the man. The flashlight did nothing to give the figure any details, he remained as dark and featureless as our surroundings.

“W-what the fuck…” I whispered through quivering lips, dropping the light to my side. Finally, for the first time since I’d laid my eyes on him, the silhouette of the man moved. His arm stretched stiffly towards the open door, like the muscles hadn’t been used in years. His hand closed slowly into a fist and he began to knock against the metal. At first they were nonsensical, slow and the sound of the metal interrupted the immense silence that filled the space between us. I stood completely stunned, frozen and unable to move. I thought to turn and run but I feared what would happen if I lost eye contact with the figure. I could feel my heart pounding as the knocks started to become more consistent but still slow and intentional. The man let the sound play out before he’d go again and the knocks became more aggressive and loud, almost unnaturally so. The sound seemed to bounce off the walls, surrounding me in a way that I couldn’t explain. Then it came to a stop as quickly as it began. The arm lifted one last time and gently tapped the door in a familiar rhythm, the shave and a haircut. I watched it lower back to his side, just as jagged and stiff as it had raised. The figure’s body then turned to face the open doorway to his right and slowly, almost robotically, walked through the door and out of my view. I quickly started to breathe freely again, my breaths long and labored.

“G-get your shit together, Adam. Get this guy and call George.” I whispered to myself as I hesitantly stepped forward. My slow walk quickly grew to a run as my fear mounted. The worst case scenarios and unknowns were building in my mind before I whipped around the corner the man had just stepped through. The room was small, with lines of shelves on either side and a small window towards the ceiling at the far end. Its safety glass was shattered but the wire mesh kept it in place. The room was empty. Nothing disturbed, no footprints, no other way out than through the doorway I’d watched since he’d walked through it. Any sense of calm I had disintegrated almost immediately. My eyes danced from wall to wall, hoping somehow I’d missed the full grown human that should’ve been standing right infront of me. My mount fell agape as I stepped back slowly, almost dropping my flashlight with how much my hands were shaking. I grabbed the walkie from my pocket, admitting defeat as I was completely and unabashedly freaking out.

“George, h-hey it’s Adam. I-I don’t know what’s going on but this guy keeps disappearing a-and he was banging on the walls trying to f-freak me out. Can you g-give me a-a hand finding h-him?” I asked, my voice a stuttering mess as I tried to downplay exactly what I’d been experiencing. The line stayed static, my mentor's familiar gruff voice absent where it should’ve been. “H-hey, you there?” I asked again after a few moments of static. And again, I heard nothing. “G-George? George, pick up the damn walkie!” I ordered, feeling the panic swelling inside me. But George never answered. 

I looked in either direction, trying to find the nearest exit. In the darkness I couldn’t make out anything and I tried to retrace my steps towards the door I’d entered through. My walk was slow, cautious, as I moved around the dusty assembly lines and heavy machinery. As I passed a row of dirty, fogged windows, a rush of wind whistled through the building, sending the trees outside swaying and loose debris inside flying. Tree branches smacked against the windows as I passed, making me jump back in fright. I was more on edge than I’d ever been before and if I’d heard a pin drop I imagine my ears would have caught it. I continued past the windows, barely making it a few feet before realizing that something wasn’t right. While the wind had subsided, the branches kept hitting the windows. I swung my light around faster than I’d ever moved before but it revealed nothing. The branches were completely still, yet the tapping continued. It was slow, purposeful, and I quickly understood its source wasn’t something outside. 

I finally took off in a dash towards the next room, the soft taps of the window behind me turning into aggressive, loud bangs. The sounds bashed off of different materials, metal, brick, wood, anything that was available. I didn’t dare look behind me as I tripped around the corner into the next room. But it followed me faster than I could run away. I could hear objects right beside me being pounded, smashed and tossed, shaking the floor beneath my feet. I saw the moonlight shining through the open doorway in front of me as I kept running as fast as I possibly could, the vigorous, angry violence behind me gaining closer and closer to my ears. I heard loud bangs against the brick wall beside me, so strong that the plaster began to crack and chip. I swung around the handrail and felt something knock my leg out from under me, twisting my ankle as I tumbled down the stairs and out onto the crumbling concrete.

I didn’t move for a moment, almost hoping that I could somehow play dead. But that thought didn’t last long. I quickly pushed myself to my feet, feeling the throbbing pain in my ankle as I hobbled away from the doorway. I barely made it five feet before collapsing to the ground again, starting to cry as I rolled onto my back. I picked my head up and looked back at the factory building. Silence surrounded me, as if nothing had happened. The leaves of the trees rustled quietly above and that was all. In front of me, standing in the doorway I’d just come through, was the man. His black silhouette almost blending into the darkness behind him. I stared at him, frozen and helpless like a deer in headlights. He simply stood for what felt like hours before moving his arm to the metal door, just as he had back inside. He balled his hand and gave the door two solid, slow knocks. Then he turned, and the black silhouette slipped back into the shadows. 

I walked in agonizing pain back to the security trailer, my entire leg throbbing in pain as I tried to move as quickly as I could. I kept trying to radio for George but even outside, the walkie couldn’t reach him. When the trailer came into view, something immediately seemed wrong. The lights inside were off. The flood lamp that was pointed down onto our security car had gone out as well. The place seemed lifeless and empty, just like the rest of the factory.

“S-shit” I muttered under my breath as I hobbled up the stairs and through the door. The room was cold, dark and almost devoid of sound. George’s usual early morning radio show had been replaced with white static. And in the office chair, hand grasping his chest, was George. He was heaving heavily, his eyes terrified as they rolled over to meet my own. I nearly fell again as I hurried to his side.

“G-George, w-what the hell happened? I-I’m calling 911, it’s going to be ok I promise.” I insisted, my months of working the front desk at an Urgent Care coming right back to me. I grabbed the phone off the desk and with trembling fingers, dialed 911. I knew what I was looking at. I'd seen it more times than I’d like to admit. George was having a heart attack. 

The ambulance arrived within ten minutes, Harmon Regional Hospital was only a few miles away but it felt like a lifetime had passed as I tried to keep the man conscious. He never spoke, focusing all his efforts on breathing as I kept repeating over and over. We sat in the dark, with the sound of the radio static the only thing breaking the silence of the desolate property. Paramedics swung the door open followed by the police who quickly took over the scene. George was moved onto a stretcher, his almost limp body carried out of the room. The paramedics took us both to the hospital, the police giving me a ride in the back of their cruiser.

“So uh… what happened to you, kid? You look like you just went through hell.” The officer asked as we pulled out behind the ambulance. My face was slumped against the glass, watching the desolate factory slowly disappear behind the trees.

“I uh… tripped down the stairs inside one of the buildings. Twisted my ankle and fell on the pavement.” I said softly.

“Thought you guys don’t go inside unless there's suspicion of trespassing.” He recalled.

“Y-yeah I thought I heard something inside but um… didn’t find anyone. Probably was just an… an animal.” I tried to say, the words barely able to trickle out of my mouth.

“Right… guess you guys get a lot of that. Just so you know, if you think someone could be in there, we can investigate. I can have officers inside in-”

“No,” I insisted, a renewed energy in my voice. I couldn’t imagine having any other soul enter that place, and I certainly wouldn’t have it happen because of me. “I-it was an animal. You don’t need to have anyone go in there. Trust me.”

“Alright, alright. If you say so, kid. If you say so.”

I told my father the same thing when he and my mother made it to the hospital. My mom was just relieved I was alright. I looked worse than I really was despite the cuts, bruises and boot I got put on my foot for the next two weeks. My father looked at me differently however. He was all smiles, glad I was safe and said he was sorry I had to go through the whole ordeal. But there was something else in his eyes I couldn’t quite place. Mannerisms that didn’t quite match. I didn’t really understand it and at the moment, I didn’t really care to. But I do now.

I was back on the job after the boot came off, my dad got one of his other guys to cover the factory with George out of commission. He lived through the heart attack but never went back to work at that factory. He never told a soul what happened in the time he was alone either. And I did the same. 

Not until right now. I worked for my father’s company for a year and a half. And there are many things that I never understood about what would happen on that job. Long after The Knocker, as I started to call him. But whatever happened always stayed there. And I didn’t. Now I’m happy to say I don’t have to work the nights, I don’t even work in security. I live with my girlfriend Emma two states away and I’ve been happy. Money is good, relationship is good, life is good. My time working as a watchman doesn’t even cross my mind. It’s always been covered up by something better.

But last night I woke up in the middle of the night. Emma was still asleep, her dirty blonde hair having fallen over her face as she slept facing me. I couldn’t help but smile, she always looked funny when she slept. I stretched a little under the covers as I adjusted and got ready to shut my eyes again. I let out a long breath before settling in again, rolling over and shutting my eyes. But just as quickly as they shut, they were quickly wide open again. I heard a knock on the glass, and then another, and then more. They were delicate but purposeful, almost rhythmic. It lasted almost ten minutes and ended in the same way, a shave and a haircut. 

I’ve spent the entire day today trying to figure out what caused it. Wasted my entire Sunday. I tore the house apart and checked every inch of the exterior. Every bush, every tree, anything that could reproduce the knock. But it was a dead end at every turn. In the back of my mind, I knew I was simply delaying the answer I already knew was right. Emma thinks I’m going crazy trying to find the source of a knock that wasn’t even loud enough to wake her up. But she doesn’t understand and I don’t intend to explain it to her. Not yet anyway. 

I’m afraid to go to sleep tonight. I don’t know what will happen. Maybe nothing, maybe the same thing, maybe something worse. The unknown worries me, because the Knocker isn’t the worst thing I encountered on that job. And as much as he terrifies me, there are much bigger fish in the sea.
