My mom died three days before a major deadline at work.

It still hadn’t sunk in. I’d catch myself reaching for my phone to tell her something, a small win, a dumb joke, only to stare at the empty screen and remember she wasn’t there anymore.

Grief pressed on me like cold stone, heavy and relentless.

But the project was due in three days. No breaks. No room to fall apart.

Just after midnight, my phone buzzed. Her old number lit up the screen.

My heart twisted. I didn’t want to answer. But I did.

“Hello?” My voice trembled.

Static. A faint, crackling hiss.

I hung up, telling myself it was a glitch, a prank. But something knotted in my chest said otherwise.

The next morning, Dad called. His voice was quiet, tired.

“Son,” he said, “you should take some time off. Let yourself breathe. Grief isn’t something you can push through.”

“I wish I could,” I said. “The project’s due Friday. I have to keep going.”

A long pause. Then, “Just think about it, okay?”

Work blurred into itself. My eyes burned from staring at the screen, but my mind kept drifting back to that call, the silence, the number, her missing voice.

At midnight, the phone buzzed again. Same number.

I answered, hands shaking.

“Hey, Mijo,” her voice came through, soft and warm like she was right beside me. “How was your day?”

I swallowed hard.

“Busy.”

“You always work so hard,” she said gently. “Did you eat? Sleep enough?”

For a moment, I forgot she was gone. I wanted to believe it was really her.

“I’m trying,” I whispered.

“Good.” She paused. “I’m proud of you. I know this is hard. But you’re strong.”

Then, so quietly I almost missed it, “I’m waiting to see you.”

My throat went dry.

At lunch, I called Dad.

“How’re you holding up?” he asked softly.

“Not great.” I swallowed the lump. “I keep hearing her voice. Like she’s still here.”

“That’s grief talking.” His voice was gentle but firm. “You can’t let it consume you. Maybe take a day off. Come visit me. We could go fishing, like before.”

Fishing.

The project was due the next day.

At midnight, the phone buzzed again.

I didn’t want to answer. I tried to ignore it. But I needed to hear her voice.

“Hey, Mijo,” she said, warm and close, “How’s the project coming?”

I closed my eyes.

“It’s hard. I’m exhausted.”

“You’re doing great.” Her voice trembled with something I couldn’t place. “I’m proud of you. But promise me you’ll rest. You don’t have to be strong all the time.”

“I wish you were here.”

A silence thicker than any I’d known. Then, “I have to go now. But I’m waiting. Your dad and I, we’re waiting.”

The words hit like a punch to the gut.

I froze.

Dad had been dead for three years.

I remembered then, the fishing trip I skipped. The one Dad begged me to go on, but I said no. Said I had to stay late, had a shot at that promotion.

He went without me.

And never came back.

The silence crushed me. The calls. Her voice. The waiting.

Comfort? Or something darker?

A siren song pulling me closer to the edge.

I sat in the dark, phone in hand, everything I’d held onto slipping away.

Maybe it was grief. Maybe something else.

The calls didn’t stop.

Some nights, when the silence is thick enough, I still hear her voice, soft, warm, waiting.

And maybe, deep down, I don’t want it to end.
