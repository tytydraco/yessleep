I know how this sounds, but I swear I had a reason.

Every once in a while, when my roommate Conner wasn’t home, I’d check his room. I didn’t do this to steal anything or be a snoop for the sake of it. No, I wanted to reassure myself that I wasn’t living with someone who’d eventually end up on the news.

Conner isn’t a regular guy. He’s a little too proud of his German heritage if you know what I mean. The kind of pride that sneaks into places where it doesn’t belong. Nazi jokes that land wrong. WW2 Facts nobody asked for. He says them casually, like he’s just sharing trivia, but he always watches your face afterward. Always checking for judgment.

To make matters worse, he’s obsessed with guns and knives. He collects them. Displays them. Lines them up on his wall like achievements. There’s a twisted dagger mounted above his TV that he once called “a real beauty,” and I remember wondering why anyone would need something shaped like that unless they’d spent time imagining what it would feel like to use it.

His room puts out bad vibes beyond just the murder weapons. Between morbid heavy metal posters for bands no one has heard of and the two movie posters he has up (American Psycho and Joker by the way), there were lots and lots of old war memorabilia that seems to always happen to be German. No Old US Army helmets or Red Army ushankas. He only had the stuff his favorites used. That included a WWII gas mask hanging on the wall, stiff and yellowed from prior use. He fucking loved that thing and would wear it at night to freak me out. 

So yeah, I consider it my civic duty to search his room from time to time. Not because I’m nosy. Because when someone surrounds themselves with weapons, Nazi iconography, and incel shit, you start wondering if they’re ever going to act out one of their special interests.

I sat at his desk and logged into his computer. His password was his favorite movie plus the same numbers he used for everything. The numbers 12, 13, and 14, no idea the meaning behind those, but he uses them for everything: usernames, gamer tags, passcodes. His over use of them, made guessing his password a lot easier that’s for sure. 

The browser that opened upon logging in wasn’t Chrome. It was a Tor browser.

Conner loved talking about the “deep web” or the “dark web.” Always said it with a grin, like he knew something about it everyone else didn’t.

At first, it almost felt stupid. Drugs. Weapons. Things so blatant they felt fake. I even laughed at one site offering hired killers like it was an online food menu. 

It seemed my fears of Conner were unfounded. He was just using the dark web to cosplay being a criminal. None of this shit was real.  

I was about to get off when I noticed a message pop up on Conner’s computer through the open door. A chat app I didn’t recognize. The sender name was just a single letter. X.

Curiosity won. It always does.

The messages assumed I was Conner. X joked with him about always working during the matinees. X even mocked him for being sloppy and not using his ghost??? Whatever the hell that meant.  When I replied, pretending to be sick and home from work, the response came almost instantly.

They sent a link.

They called it a Red Room. 

I knew what that was, but I told myself it wasn’t real. The FBI  says they aren’t, so I clicked anyway.

The screen went dark, then bright red. Like a theater curtain pulling back. The chat exploded with emojis. Popcorn. Eyes. Smiley faces. It was like a demented twitch chat.

Then the stream started.

There was a young woman on screen, tied up and terrified.

The first bid was for her to get one of her fingers cut off and fed to her. I laughed at first. I actually fucking laughed thinking it was all bullshit, but then a man in a hockey mask stepped into frame with a knife not all that disimilar to the ones Conner had hanging on his wall. 

The man in the hockey mask cut her finger off like it was a piece of meat at the deli. As she screamed he shoved it down her throat and she vomited it back out. So, he tried to feed it to her again, but this time she kept her mouth shut, so he grabbed her by the nose and squeezed until it started gushing blood. That got her to scream again and after three of the worst minutes of my life, the man in the hockey mask got her to eat the finger.

I won’t repeat the other bids. I won’t repeat what people were asking to be done to her or how casually they typed it. I just remember realizing, in a cold, quiet moment, that Conner had more points saved up than I’d seen spent so far and people were spending a lot.

I muted the audio and nearly threw up. I ran to my laptop and considered calling the police, but I doubted that would be any good. They’d think I was making this shit up, so instead I tried reporting the site through the FBI’s cybercrimes division. When I went back to Conner’s room to grab the pertinent site information, a private message popped up.

“I wouldn’t do that.” X said. I tried to ignore it until X added, “Ed…” That’s my name. 

I considered what to do next. How could X know it was me and not Conner? How the fuck does he even know who I am? Did Conner tell them about me?

“Do what?” I replied, curiosity getting the better of me.

“Report the site like you’re trying to do right now. It won’t work Ed.”

“Why not?” I replied again, taking pictures of the conversation with my phone.

“Nice try. I’m in your phone too.” X replied, not in the chat this time, but through my phone’s messenger app. 

“You still can’t stop me.” I texted them back, hoping that taunting them would get them to overplay their hand.  

That’s when X replied back with my full name, home address, credit card number, and the names and addresses of my parents and sister.

X told me the site would be gone before anyone found it. That I’d sound crazy. Then they said something worse.

“You don’t want to be in the next show, do you?”

They told me to place a bid.

Not to save her. But to participate and implicate myself too.

“All you gotta do is have him cut her…that’s all.” X explained.

When I put in the bid, my hands were shaking so badly I almost missed the enter key. I didn’t even look at the number afterward. I just stared at the screen, waiting for something to stop me. An error. A disconnect. Anything.

The chat froze.

Then it exploded.

Question marks. Laughing faces. People typing things like *what?* and *is this a joke?* Someone accused me of wasting points. Someone else said it was boring. I felt this thin, stupid flicker of hope rise in my chest. Like maybe confusion was enough. Like maybe nonsense could derail this death machine.

On the stream, the man in the hockey mask tilted his head. He looked genuinely curious. He set the knife down.

I didn’t breathe until I saw his hand come back into frame holding an electric razor.

The sound was what broke me. That low mechanical buzz cutting through the silence. The girl started crying immediately, like she already knew what was coming, like humiliation hurt almost as much as everything else. She tried to turn her head away, but she couldn’t go anywhere.

Hair fell into her lap in uneven clumps.

The chat went quiet again. Not angry this time. Watching.

I felt sick, but I also felt something worse. Relief. A coward’s relief. I told myself I’d done something. That I’d changed the outcome. That this was better.

Then the applause started.

Clapping emojis. Fire. People calling it “bold.” “Avant-garde.” Someone typed that it was poetic. That stripping her identity was more interesting than hurting her body.

I wanted to scream at them that they were all insane. That this wasn’t art. That this wasn’t even mercy. It was a thin attempt to appease X without it weighing too heavy on my conscience. 

A private message popped up.

“Well done.”

Before I could even process that, another bid appeared. Bigger than mine. Bigger than anything I’d seen all night.

The man in the mask stepped back so the camera could see her clearly. Her ruined hair. Her shaking shoulders. Her empty, exhausted eyes.

He grabbed a machete.

I knew what was coming before it happened.

I muted the audio, but it didn’t help. Her now exposed scalp erupted red as she was cleaved to death with the machete. I think somewhere between the fifth and sixth swing, she died. At least I hope she did. 

When he was done, The man in the hockey mask left the machete in her skull much to the sick delight of the chat. 

The stream ended shortly after.

I cried until my chest hurt. I prayed that was the end… The horrible sickening end…

It wasn’t.

X  messaged me again. Said I had one more task to complete to prove they could trust me. Said unlike the last one, it would be “fun.”

When I read X’s final task, I couldn’t help but look up from the computer screen and towards Conner’s wall. The gas mask and the knife were both staring back at me.

“You know what to do.” X said.

That night, Conner came home like nothing was wrong. Headphones on. Heavy metal Music blasting. He barely looked at me as I watched TV in the living room.

Later, from my room, I heard him settle in. The familiar clicks of his keyboard. The same browser opening. The hum of his music, still blasting in his ears.

Another message arrived for him. I saw it reflected faintly off the window as I stood behind his door.

“Ready for the show?” It was from X.

I picked up the knife on the wall behind Conner as he typed his response.

“Always.” Conner replied. 

When the stream loaded, Conner didn’t understand. He saw on the screen his own face. Confused. Then as he came to realize what was going on, afraid…very…very afraid.

A message popped up.

“Great, because tonight you’re the star!” 

X’s message caused Conner to rip out his earphones and turn around to see me standing right behind him. I was wearing the gas mask holding his favorite knife that he loved to imply was used on Holocaust victims. 

I won’t lie to you all, X was right. I did have fun.
