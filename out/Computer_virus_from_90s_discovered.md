I was heading to work on a winter morning, before the sun had come up yet, it was one of those fake winters that were warm enough to go outside wearing a t-shirt. The deadline for my story about old archived web pages was two days away, so I was planning on staying late. I bumped into my coworker Gary as we were entering the elevator. He was holding steaming hot coffee and it spilled on my pants. Fortunately, I had a backup pair in my office.

While I was changing my clothes, I remembered an old story about a guy that made some blogs back in the 90s that were deleted. He was supposedly a genius programmer, Eric Erdmann. They also say he was killed by the government because was close to cracking some encryption algorithm. This was interesting to me because our workplace recently got access to a huge internet archive. The kind with exclusive information most places don’t dream of having. I immediately went to my computer and loaded up the archive search. I had no luck finding the original blogs so i gave up shortly after. As if he knew I was having problems, Gary came up to apologize for the accident and asked if he could help with anything. 

Right before lunch, we finally found it. The site was online only for a day and most archives had it deleted so we got lucky with ours. It wasn’t just a blog, but a huge collection of web pages written by Erdmann in 1996. I was starving so I went to eat before continuing.

As the day went on I was reading the pages and writing about it in my story. When it started to get dark I realized I needed to hurry up and finish. Just before I left I noticed the page downloaded a file “program000.exe”. I hastily deleted it and shut the computer down. I was too tired to continue.

The next day, I overslept. I got to work around 10 and went to the elevator, there was a coffee stain still in the corner. While I was going up I realized I missed a text message from Gary. It was sent at 8:26 AM: “Hey are you coming in? I saw you sent me a mail about the website we found”. I didn’t send any mail. When I opened the notification the message was deleted. I went to Gary’s office, but it was empty. I must have imagined the notification I thought. I got to my computer and opened the archived pages to continue working. I was having a lot of problems with the screen. It would suddenly turn off for a few seconds and turn back on. I reported to problem to my IT guy and he took the computer for a bit. I had nothing to do so I went for a walk to get inspired. It was freezing outside. As I was heading back I saw someone standing im my office through the window. It was Gary, he was looking directly at me.

I pulled out my phone and called him, he didn’t move. I went into the building and ran up the stairs. I got a text message from him: “I’m sorry”. I heard the sound of cables creaking and what felt like an earthquake. A thud from below. I ran to my floor and opened my office door. Gary was inside and looked shocked when he saw me. He was holding a sharp piece of metal, it looked like a part of his computer. I realized that I didn’t see anybody else on the floor when I got up. I ran straight to the elevator, and as I ran past Gary’s office I smelled some smoke, his computer was on the floor smashed with smoke filling the room. The elevator doors opened and I took a step forward. There was no floor, the elevator had fallen down. Thankfully I grabbed the walls on the side and didn’t fall. I got out using the stairs and looked up. The floor was burning up. Soon enough the firefighters came. 

Today, I got a message from Gary. It’s been year since the fire. The message had an attachment “program000.exe”. This time I threw my phone away.
