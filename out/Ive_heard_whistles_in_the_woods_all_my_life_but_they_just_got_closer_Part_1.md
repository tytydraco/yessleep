I have lived in the woods all my life with my family ever since I was 6 we lived in this nice small cozy cabin in the woods of Utah. It’s nice don’t get me wrong but ever since we moved there even when I was young I always felt it as unsettling and sinister in a way. I remember the first day we moved there like it was yesterday, we unpacked I played with my older sister Sarah all day we went outside played kickball I miss those days. I thought this was our dream home and during the day it was the most beautiful home we could have lived in, but that’s during the day but at night it’s a different story. 

That night on the first day we moved there I was in my bed, well a air mattress since our furniture wouldn’t come until the next Thursday so I was stuck on that uncomfortable air mattress that made my back ache and I still get back pains sometimes from that crappy mattress. It all started at midnight, my room had a large window looking out to the woods, usually those woods were majestic, in the sunlight the vibrant greens would shine in the light but at night it looked like a endless void with towering trees that looked like figures. Needless to say I was terrified that first night I hid under my covers shivering and terrified the I heard it for the first time and not the last time: A whistle. I was confused and panicked I thought it was just in my head even if I was six years old I knew people just didn’t whistle in the middle of the night in the woods. It was a rhythmic whistle but it had a sense or eeriness and malice in it. I screamed I hid that screen in my body for the last five minutes but I broke and I screamed and my parents rushed in a flicked the light on. As soon as I screamed the whistling stopped. My parents comforted me and Sarah woke up. 

“David what the heck? It’s 12 in the morning go to sleep.” Sarah had told me exhausted. 

I just said “Sorry” and after about I think a hour of comforting I calmed down and fell asleep. In the morning I woke up to the smell of pancakes and bacon and I ran downstairs to find my mom cooking for us. She greeted me like she always did in the morning and I sat on the floor since as I said before our furniture wasn’t there yet. My dad came down With Marine and we all ate. We are in silence until my dad mentioned the night before of me screaming and telling them about whistling in the woods. 

I immediately tensed up remembering the eerie tune I heard the night before and I just stayed silent looking down at my food. Marine looked at me and just sut hugged me knowing the incident shook me up. Sarah was my best friend and sister and she was the best person in the world besides my parents and I always found comfort in my Older sisters embrace and if I could have it back I would. 

For the next 5 years every night was the same, I heard the whistling I screamed and my parents and sister comforted me but slowly I found a odd comfort in the whistle I thought of it as a lullaby and it made me at ease. The “peaceful” phase as I call it where nothing happened and I got used to it. Now you might be wondering why I’m telling you about my past but I needed to show you what the whistle was like before it got weird. 

Just so you know I’m 19 and the peaceful phase lasted for another 8 years until last month. That week I was at a party trying to have fun and get away from studying for final exams because those exams were slowly breaking me. It was actually Sarah’s idea to take me, she’s 24 now but she is still as caring as she was before but she’s at college and came to visit that week. Not much in that party was eventful except for some embarrassing moments I’m not gonna say because it’s not important. It started when I got home I stumbled on my bed drunk tired and exhausted even if it was only 11:30. I sat on my bed for like what 30 minutes waiting for the whistle to put me to sleep but at midnight I heard it but it was, different it was louder and I heard footsteps crunching the leaves outside. I freaked out thinking It was just the alcohol but I feel asleep anyway. This happened for the next couple weeks and I knew it was real and not because of my drunken state until last night I saw what was causing the whistles. 

Last night I was at my computer playing video games then I heard the whistle but I had headphones on so how did I hear it? I heard footsteps, twigs snapping and leaves crunching like normal but I got very curious. I walked to the window and I looked out to the woods and I saw a black figure with a long black trench coat and a fedora and white eyes. It was tall as I could see if I had to guess the figure was about 7 or 9 feet tall and it was just whistling and staring at my window the eyes I felt like the gaze was full of malice like it was going to attack. I tried to take a picture but when I looked at the picture it was just a black screen. I’m not sure what to do now I’m so paranoid now thinking that figure is going to attack me in my sleep. Maybe I just need to calm down I’m not sure. Maybe someone has advice there’s a psychic in a nearby town so ima go there today I’ll post an update after I get the fortune. 

It hurts so much I shouldn’t have left in the middle of the night how could I be so stupid why didn’t I just stay home and wait till morning? Maybe I shouldn’t have went through the woods at midnight apparently that whistling freak dosent like me being out in its domain at night or something not my fault he attacked me! So I went to the fortune teller and she said that a figure would follow me everywhere I go. I thought it was a load of crap but I don’t know now. It hurts so much I think I might pass out but… Whatever I need to get this out before I pass out! So after I got the fortune I decided to take a shortcut through the woods since it was still light outside so I thought I’d be safe. I got lost I did and eventually I got to my house it was 12 and I heard the whistling and I turned around the figure was there just… staring at me it looked at me it’s eyes full of malice. I tried to back away but it got me. I’m leaning against my house as i write this the ambulance should be here but it hurts im shaking I’m on the verge of a panic attack I head the whistling still and now I see the eyes staring at me from the woods I think it’s going to lunge at me again. I see the lights but I don’t feel safe I don’t feel safe I don’t feel safe.
