I never really thought twice about where I worked until all of this. I didn’t think I would have to.

It’s…pretty run of the mill for a first job, the only one I could get with no experience. Ride operator at a local amusement park. I work long hours for almost minimum wage running rides, but the cash is nice. Worst part is the heat and standing, but like I said, even minimum wage with crazy hours generates a good income for a 17 year old guy.

I didn’t mind working in my department, and I’m almost positive my life would have been way easier if they just let me stick to it. Everything started when I had to work warehouse last week. I didn’t know enough rides, so instead of sending me home I was helping run supplies. Everything was fine, but it was getting late…definitely past when I was scheduled, and I had one run left. The sun had been down for at least 30 minutes by now, and I had to get supplies to a lakeside restaurant in the park. I could tell by walking to it that pretty much everyone had left by now except grounds and the rest of the warehouse workers. I wheeled the stuff on the pallet out to the spot, pretty average stuff like beans and beer, nothing I couldn’t unload myself. Not like anyone was there if I couldn’t. I went inside to see where I’d have to put the stuff away; found the freezer, fridge, and the shelves where I put the rest of the dry supplies. I was also snooping around a bit to be honest, I had never been in the back of a restaurant like this, let alone with nobody around. It was sort of eerie with only the buzz of appliances and random scheduled music, but I’m not really a believer in ghosts or anything, and I just really wanted to clock out.

Needless to say, I’m challenging my preconceived beliefs after…everything.

As I started putting the items away, I noticed the door to the back room opened and shut in a way that sounded like someone was coming in after me. The first time it happened I set the beer I was about to put away down and looked around, nobody was there so I assumed it’s just the way the door is. As I continued though, the atmosphere just kept shifting into something worse and worse. It felt like eyes were on me, like the shadows were watching me, waiting for something. I should have just…left or something. Piled all of the stuff in one go and dipped. I was fighting my gut feeling, fighting what I can only imagine getting stalked feels like. But it was so silent. No creaks, no whistles, not even the music was playing anymore. I assumed “okay dammit long day I’m just freaking out over nothing” and grabbed the last thing, a sac of sugar. I went inside and headed to the back room, this time though, it…it didn’t shut twice.

It sounded like something caught it. I tried to pretend like I didn’t notice but my entire body went into panic mode. My heart felt like it dropped straight to my feet, and I started sweating like someone was focusing one of those high beam flashlights on me despite the cooled backroom. I slowly walked to the shelf and stood there for what felt like eternity, knowing something was going to be behind me. I mustered up the courage to turn around, looking at the ground. It was worse than if I had just faced forward, maybe I wouldn’t have noticed it if I did.

 It was crouched in the corner, the only thing I could make out was...*huge* eyes, but it was enshrouded in unusually empty darkness. I followed it as it slowly started rising, what I could only imagine was it standing, fixated on me. Shallow, uneven breathing was coming from it, making no mistake that it was at least somewhat alive. I slowly walked forward, it didn't move, didn't blink. Just watched, right in front of the door. I inched closer, and closer, its eyes following suit. As I reach for the handle, it snaps down, meeting my face. In its closeness, I noticed that it faintly smelled like something that had just been killed. Coppery, a bit rotten, but its eyes were huge, bloodshot. It's breathing grew louder, deeper, more strained than it had before. If I hadn't left right then I don't want to try to fathom what could have happened, but that thing, it felt utterly evil. Not hostile like a hungry animal following its instincts, utterly evil. All I know is that I ran. Grabbed the pallet and ran like hell. 

I felt it behind me. I knew if I turned around it would be there.

I got to the back gate, turned in the supply slip, and clocked out. I went through security, finally ready to just get home, but I had forgotten my ride was still fifteen minutes out. I sat outside as it started to sprinkle, only the flicker of the HR building to keep me company. Five or so minutes before my ride pulled in, I heard it again. The shallow breathing through the fence where the lockers were. I didn't dare turn around, I already knew what was there.

That thing didn't stay on the park grounds. I can feel it lurking around in the dark, a misplaced breath, a glint of light in the shadows. I don't know what it is or what the hell it wants, but I can feel it waiting like it did in the restaurant. Even as I write this at my table, I'm desperately trying to ignore the breathing on my neck. This happened last weekend, and I'm scheduled today, I don't know if anyone will believe me or has any similar experiences at the park, but I'm going to try to ask around. I can't stand losing my mind like this.
