Haven’t left the building for over two weeks. No one’s physically detaining me here, exactly. It’s more than that.

Whenever I’ve tried to leave, I wake up in bed.

I wouldn’t say I black out, which implies that I lose consciousness. It’s somehow more seamless than that. My foot hits the sidewalk, and the next moment, my eyes open to a view of the ceiling. No dizziness. No feeling like I’m about to pass out. The transition is instant. It's like two pieces of film stock from different movies have been perfectly spliced together in my memory.

Been living off what was pre-stocked in the kitchen when I arrived; protein bars, soups, dry cereal. Goddamned bunker food.

I've attempted to call 9-1-1 from my phone, but the line just rings and rings. No one ever picks up. Not sure this is even going to post, but it's worth a try.

Whatever is happening to me, it has to be related to [this sculpture](https://imgur.com/a/pG6mDk4).

If you know what culture it hails from, what its purpose is, or any other information about it, feel free to skip the rest of this and DM me.

If you don't know what it is, or you need more context, feel free to read on. Whatever you do, just hurry.

The creaking is getting closer.

My brother used to describe me as *spiritually inclined.* Fox meant it as a joke, of course. You could tell because he always said it with a sarcastic upward inflection, like a used car salesman presenting an 84’ Ford Broncho with nine-hundred-thousand miles on it to a customer as a *certified pre-owned vehicle.*

It was a playful euphemism meant to dull the pain of mom’s rejection. For the most part, it worked, too.

I’m not a godless hellspawn. No, no, no - nothing of the sort. Where did you hear that, my mother? Well, that’s just a nasty rumor she feels compelled to spread. The words I would use are *spiritually inclined*.

Everything was a joke to that lovable son of a bitch. The worst part is there’s some God’s honest accuracy to the phrase.

I can’t find a better way to describe my affliction.

*Psychic* isn’t quite right. I can’t predict horse races or winning Powerball numbers, nor can I read minds. I’m not necessarily a *medium,* either. Don’t hand me your grandmother’s most treasured broach and expect me to commune with her like I’m some kind of walkie-talkie to the afterlife that you can click on and off. I’m just not that interesting, unfortunately.

What I’ve been cursed with is like normal human intuition but with a slightly broadened spectrum of ability.

To make it simple, I can feel the comings and goings of the soul; upcoming births, upcoming deaths, sometimes other big changes in a person’s life that are on the horizon but haven’t yet materialized. That said, the information I can glean is very non-specific. It’s almost like temperature; a characteristic that I can pick up on, but it doesn’t always give me more information than "warm" or "cold".

Think about it this way: if I handed you a hot slice of pizza, would you be able to tell me *why* it was hot from just feeling it? Could you differentiate whether it was hot from being in the oven versus hot because it was just pulled from a burning building by the temperature alone?

Maybe. More likely not, though, and I guess that’s the point. It’s really not as impressive, or in the case of the church I grew up in, as blasphemous as movies like *The Sixth Sense* would have you believe.

Like I said, I’m not a *soothsayer.* I’m no *prophet,* *oracle,* or some fucking *demon-kin.* I’m just…*spiritually inclined.*

Fox understood that. He normalized it for me, made it digestible, even though he wasn’t the person experiencing it. My brother was beautifully empathic like that.

God, I miss him.

\--------

As I’ve alluded to, we were raised in a religiously strict household. I’m talking *Harry Potter is a lieutenant of Satan himself* levels of orthodoxy. Thus, my inherent spirituality was sacrilege. I’ve been unclean since the day I was born, to borrow some more verbiage from my mother.

The way Fox used to tell it, people picked up on my “gifts” around when I turned two years old.

It was cute when I’d smile at pregnant women, waving hello at the unborn souls in their abdomen throughout Sunday Service. People would giggle at my fixation, but otherwise, no one paid the behavior much mind.

It was *decidedly* less cute when I’d stare at a random person, forlorn and waving goodbye to them through the entire sermon, only to have them die in a car crash twenty-four hours later. The fourth time something like that happened, my mom couldn’t claim it was coincidence anymore.

I entered this world marked, apparently. Unforgivably heretical before I could even put a sentence together to defend myself.

So, by the time my consciousness was fully operational, I had already garnered a pretty shitty reputation in our community. By then I was learning to suppress my spirituality, sure, but the damage was already done.

I was a pariah, or some unholy leper. An untouchable.

No sane person would be seen handing me kindness; that was social suicide. Mom certainly fell in line with the verdict. The first time I experienced serious menstrual cramps, buckled over from the spasms at our local market, she dumped a small vial of holy water on my head, concerned that the demon inside me was about to be released into the world at large. She genuinely looked surprised when I didn’t burst into flames, too.

Don’t think I would have made it to my twenties without Fox. He was my foundation.

When he disappeared on a hike three months ago, I put my entire life on pause.

Left town and everything else behind without a second thought. Quit my job. Broke up with the person I’d been seeing. Purged my savings account to spend on hotel rooms, search efforts, missing person ads, and eventually, a funeral.

Six weeks into the search, we found his backpack at the bottom of a ravine. An assortment of human bones was located not too far away, as well. Fox must have fallen off the cliff-face two hundred feet above where we found his belongings. Good chance he died on impact, or so I’ve been told by the coroner.

Really just wish they said he *definitely* died on impact. Whatever happened, it’s already over and done with. Why not just lie to me?

I was devastated. Beyond devastated, actually. Turned inside out. Annihilated. Crushed and pulverized until I was nothing but a pile of human rubble on the ground.

What really fucked me up was that I didn’t feel it coming.

I was with Fox the day before he went missing, and I didn’t sense a goddamn thing. Overtime, my spirituality lulled me into a weird state of security regarding death. Based on my track record, I was under the impression that I would have plenty of warning before someone I loved passed on. I mean, I sensed my mom’s death approaching half a year in advance, and my feelings about her were lukewarm at best.

But with Fox? Nothing. Not a blip, not the smallest fragment of an inkling. My brother’s death completely blindsided me.

Eventually, I decided to pick up the pieces of myself and move on.

Not that I had a choice in the matter, honestly. The money ran out. It was either put my head back on my shoulders or embrace homelessness.

The first step in that process was finding a new place to live. With the measly cash I had left and no employment, being able to afford a deposit to sign onto a lease seemed impossible.

Which made Ms. Byrne’s email feel like providence.

\--------

*Dear Cailyn,*

*I’m sorry it took me so long to reach out. I had to ask around the congregation for your email address. Once I had it, I wasn’t sure you’d want to hear from anyone back home. Given everything that happened, I mean.*

*But this is the godly thing to do, I think. I can’t imagine how much you’re hurting, and I know you must be in need of support.*

*If you need a place to stay, you’re welcome to come live with me for a while. Alternatively, I’m very close to my apartment’s landlord. I’m sure I could get you a discounted rate on a small condo.*

*Caelum Gaudium Fas,*

*Ms. Byrne*

\--------

At face value, this solved an enormous problem. A step in the right direction. Something to get me back on my feet.

Before long, though, I felt a sort of bubbling discomfort develop in the pit of my stomach.

Out of all the people I grew up with, Ms. Byrne is certainly who I’d expect to actually reach out to me in a time of crisis. She was our Sunday school teacher, and fit the part wonderfully; awkward, frizzy brown hair, thick coke-bottle glasses, soft-spoken, always wearing a turtleneck.

Always nice to me, too. As much as the congregation would allow her to be, at least.

What I’m saying is, it would make sense for her to reach out. However, the more I considered it, the more uneasy I became.

Parts of it were just…off.

For example, I’m damn sure no one back home had my email address, so where the hell did she get it? Not only that, but the timing felt a little *too* perfect. The moment I started perusing apartments on Zillow, a message from her just happens to appear in my inbox, blatantly asking if I need a couch to crash on or an apartment to rent out at a reduced rate. Could be a fortunate coincidence, but the line between coincidence and conspiracy can be a blurry one.

Finally, and maybe this was me being overly suspicious, but what the *literal fuck* is that random Latin at the bottom? Is that normal? Am I supposed to recognize what that means off the cuff?

I should have just ignored it, honestly. Putting the phrase through Google’s Latin translator didn’t help me understand; it only served to creep me the fuck out.

*Caelum Gaudium Fas:*

*“You Make Heaven Happy”*

Eventually, though, I white-knuckled my way through the apprehension. The offer was too good to turn down, and I had no other workable prospects.

In the end, I should have trusted my gut.

*------*

On the day I was scheduled to move in, Joanna, an elderly woman who was the landlord of the building, met me in the lobby. At first, I was relieved that I had suppressed my paranoia.

Superficially, the place was nice; warm and inviting, more in line with a historical bed-and-breakfast rather than an apartment complex. Antique furniture, dark oak floors, the walls cramped with oil paintings and mirrors.

Logically, I should have been over the moon.

But I couldn’t savor my luck. I was so goddamned anxious. As I stepped inside, violent unease swam quick laps around the inside of my chest like a prowling barracuda.

Joanna did not soothe that unease.

She was polite, but the woman was intensely odd. Hazy cataracts in both eyes, long uncut fingernails, body hunched over the counter on account of the spine in her upper back sharply curving downwards like she was slowly evolving into a human question mark.

And all that’s without describing the way she moved.

I could tell she hadn’t been expecting me when I arrived, jumping from behind the front counter to greet me, rambling about how she had lost track of time. Every few steps, she’d stop for a fraction of a second, only to then immediately pick up the pace again. There was a weird rhythm to the whole thing, too. Her gait was disjointed, yes, but it had a pattern to it.

***Tap tap tap tap tap tap***\*, stop.\* ***Tap tap tap tap tap tap tap***\*, stop.\* ***Tap tap tap***\*, stop.\*

***Tap tap tap tap tap tap***\*, stop.\* ***Tap tap tap tap tap tap tap***\*, stop.\* ***Tap tap tap***\*, stop.\*

Initially, I felt ashamed of being offput by her movements, thinking it must be a manifestation of some medical condition. Maybe the aftereffects of a stroke. Maybe end-stage Parkinson’s disease.

The only problem with that theory was that, for her age, Joanna was remarkably spry and coordinated. She just didn’t seem weak. It all appeared very deliberate and intentional, as opposed to a symptom of a disease.

***Tap tap tap tap tap tap***\*, stop.\* ***Tap tap tap tap tap tap tap***\*, stop.\* ***Tap tap tap***\*, stop.\*

Joanna didn’t slow down her asymmetric gallop as she approached. I thought she was going to run straight through me.

At the last possible moment, however, the woman suddenly deactivated, landing inches from my face and meeting my bewildered stare with unblinking eye contact. I took and step back, and thankfully; she didn’t follow me forward. That said, she kept moving her head in line with my own, standing on her tipped toes so we were eye level, mirroring me.

It was almost like she was attempting to use her body to prevent me from seeing something behind her.

Reflexively, I tried to peer over her, but she was doing a surprisingly good job blocking my view of the lobby. There was the chiming of an elevator bell and the soft mechanical rumbling of old doors closing from down the hallway. Briefly, I saw behind Joanna and glimpsed the flashing light of a down arrow aside the elevator.

Then everything was silent.

I had become so focused on determining what Joanna was desperate to hide that I didn’t notice she had stopped talking.

But she was still staring into my eyes.

With the elevator door closed, however, Joanna relaxed. The nervous energy that had gripped her moments before seemed to dissipate in an instant, gently evaporating into the air around her like steam from a hot cup of tea.

*“Are you ready to see your room, dear?”* she croaked.

No introductions, no formalities, nothing. I only knew who she was by her name tag.

*“Uh…sure…”* I replied. Before I could say more, she had turned and was trotting towards the elevator.

*“We can tidy up the formalities later. Let’s get you settled in.”*

***Tap tap tap tap tap tap***\*, stop.\* ***Tap tap tap tap tap tap tap***\*, stop.\* ***Tap tap tap***\*, stop.\*

When we were in the elevator, I noticed something that gave me pause. There were three floors: a lobby, and then two floors of apartments above the lobby.

No buttons for anything *below* the lobby, despite the down arrow that just flashed in the hallway. Maybe there was at one point, but there wasn’t anything now.

I did notice an unmarked keyhole, however.

\--------

A few agonizing minutes later, I clicked the door to apartment 376 closed and slammed the deadlock into place. Joanna had offered to show me around my unit, which I respectfully declined, still thoroughly unnerved by her impish behavior.

The apartment is 900 square feet. How much is there to really see? Most days, I feel pretty confident that I can tell the difference between a toilet and a sink. I think I’ll be OK.

I wheeled my two suitcases from room to room, inspecting the premises carefully. Truthfully, I was still waiting for the catch. Some explanation for why I was getting this space at such an insane discount, inherently distrustful of empathy being the sole reason I was receiving such help.

No black mold, no cockroach infestation, no squatters. No obvious signs of damage, dilapidation or disease.

It was fairly well kept, to be perfectly frank.

The place even came pre-furnished, which was another incentive to move in. Before Fox died, I lived in my ex’s apartment, and they owned all the furniture. Didn’t have a single couch, ottoman, or kitchen appliance to my name.

From bedroom, to bathroom, to kitchen, everything was neat and in working order. The walls were mostly barren, excluding the mirrors; there was at least one in every room, if not more.

Eventually, I wandered into the tiny living space. It was the last room I had to inspect, and I was feeling a burst of cautious optimism as I walked in. The tension in my shoulders loosened, falling below my clavicles for what felt like the first time since Fox went missing.

*Maybe there wasn’t a catch,* I thought.

Of course, that thought popped into my head *right* before I saw it.

Positioned on a small black end table in the room's corner, there the goddamned thing was.

[A sculpture](https://imgur.com/a/pG6mDk4) of seven stone figures, arm and arm in a circle, with a candle in the middle, all neatly contained on top of a wooden plater in the shape of a hexagon.

I…I don’t know that I can detail what I sensed at that moment. I’m not sure I can do it justice.

The best I could come up with is this.

\--------

Visualize the most traumatic thing you’ve ever experienced. Focus in on that terrible, life-defining dread. Hold it tightly in your mind. Now, imagine the feeling of total elation. Pure, orgasmic, undiluted joy. Finally, try to imagine them at the same time. They’re like oil and water; they simply won’t mix. Instead, they both are frantically trying to supersede the other, vying for your undivided attention. Expanding and growing over each other like dualing cancers.

I tried to move my feet, but they wouldn’t budge. I tried to close my eyes, but my lids had seemingly receded inside my skull. It was almost like the object and I were embroiled in a conversation that I couldn’t turn my back on, speaking to each in a language I didn’t consciously understand.

That’s what I felt, staring at the sculpture, the platter, and the candle.

Well, with one additional thing on top of that emotional cacophony.

Somehow, I felt my brother.

And once I did, the chanting started.

\--------

A few minutes passed, when a muffled voice from directly outside the apartment door startled me out of my trance.

*“Are you sure I can’t help show you around, sweetheart? I’d love to…I’d love to show you a few things.”*

Joanna was still where I had left her, *right outside* the apartment door. She could have left and came back, but somehow, I knew that wasn’t the case.

The woman had been waiting outside for something to happen.

I stumbled backwards, dizzy and intensely nauseous. My eyes burned, seething with an extreme, searing pain like I had just pulled them off the surface of a waffle iron. Leaning against a table, I let my eyelids fall, which afforded me some relief.

After about a minute, I forced my eyelids back open. My vision was hazy. I could just barely discern the numbers on my watch.

7:32 PM. I’d entered the apartment a little after 4.

I hadn’t been staring at the sculpture for a handful of minutes.

Three hours had passed.

\--------

As soon as I was able, I draped a heavy blanket over the sculpture.

My plan from there was to pick the damn thing up and chuck it out the window into the alleyway below. It didn’t *look* heavy, and yet, I nearly threw my back out trying to lift it up.

I couldn’t make any piece of it move an inch. Couldn’t pick up the sculpture. Couldn’t push it off the table. I wasn’t even capable of picking the fucking candle up.

*Fine,* I thought. *I’ll deal with this “King Arthur/sword in the stone” bullshit tomorrow.*

Before I could turn away from the sculpture, though, another thought popped into my mind.

*Maybe I should light the candles?*

Immediately, I banished the notion from my skull. After what I had just experienced, that felt like an insane thing to do. Beyond that, however, the thought didn’t feel like my own.

Instead, the idea felt external. Like someone else had thought it and the thought had somehow found a way to burrow inside me.

——————-

That night, sleep did not come easily. It wasn’t necessarily the ongoing pain in my eyes that kept me up, although that was certainly a contributing factor. Between the sculpture, sensing Fox, and the frequent creaking of the apartment’s walls, my mind couldn’t calm down.

When I finally put my head on a pillow, I hoped exhaustion would bring sleep quickly. It almost did, I think.

But then, the creaking started. 

Soft, heavy thumps accompanied by the shrill buckling of ancient floorboards that made sleep impossible. Every ten minutes or so, I’d hear it. The first time, it was directly behind me. Then it was down the hall. Then back behind me. The walls were alive with something. I just didn’t know what.

After who knows how long, I drifted off.

Sometime later, the sensation of rising heat in the palm of my hand woke me up with a start. My eyes shot open. Disbelief flooded over me like a crashing tidal wave.

It was mid-morning, and I was standing over the sculpture, lighter in hand, nearly about to put the first of three wicks to the flame. In a state of absolute panic, I flung the blanket back over the sculpture while averting my eyes as much as I could.

The next night was identical to the first, tossing and turning, plagued with thoughts of Fox, the sculpture, and the creaking.

The next morning was identical to the first, as well. Woke up standing next to the sculpture, seconds away from lighting the candle.

And if I'm being completely honest, I don't know *what* I was doing between those times.

When I threw my lighter out, I somehow found a box of matches. When I threw the matches out, I woke up holding the lighter from the trash, greasy from an unknown substance. Locking the lighter away didn’t solve anything, either. I still woke up with it my hand. The drawer I locked it inside had been broken open. Splintered around the edges and lying face down on the kitchen floor like a wooden corpse.

*Did I even have the strength to do that?* I wondered, not particularly thrilled to imagine the other possible explanations for how the lighter had been freed if I didn't do it.

I attempted to contact Ms. Byrne at the number she’d given me in a follow-up email, but the line was disconnected.

When I walked the halls, there was never anyone there. Haven’t seen *any* other tenants, actually. It’s like I’m the only person living here.

And that more or less brings me up to the point where I put a hammer through the wall.

\---------

The mirrors gave it away. Why have one on nearly every wall, in every room?

When I took a closer look, I noticed that they weren’t even hanging on the walls. There was no space between the mirrors and the plaster. They were *fused* to the walls.

Like maybe they were one-way mirrors.

I started knocking below every mirror in the apartment. The space under the mirrors were hollow and sonorous for about a foot in either direction. As I knocked farther away from a mirror, the sound would abruptly become muted and dense.

There were some spaces behind my walls.

It took me about ten minutes to make an opening large enough that I could slip through. Sweat poured from body, partly from the exertion, party from seeing the abyss that lay beyond the hole, oozing into the apartment like black jelly.

I steadied my breathing, and I knelt down close to the makeshift entrance to the tunnel inside the walls, my heart thudding against my rib cage like a hydraulic press. Just before I put my head in the hole, I saw something; a familiar shape in the darkness.

A hazy, white circle, as still as the grave and only a few inches from my face. Despite the familiarity, I couldn’t initially identify what I was looking at. The thing was barely visible in the dark.

I forced my head closer, creeping across the threshold. Then, like a flash of lightning before the explosion of thunder, bright and silent, I realized what was familiar about the circle.

It was a cataract.

Joanna’s face bolted forward, nearly head-butting me as I frantically pulled myself back. She pushed her head through and met my petrified gaze. From what I could see, it didn’t look like she was lying flat on the ground. No, her neck fucking *curved* under the hole; the trajectory of her spine seemed to go upwards at an almost ninety-degree angle, like her body was standing straight up inside the wall.

*“When you’re ready for me to show you around, all you have to do is ask, dear. But you do have to ask.”*

And with that, her head slithered out of view. A square piece of plaster then appeared, covering the hole. From the other side, Joanna got to work covering the breach, nailing the material into place with a horrifically familiar rhythm.

***Tap tap tap tap tap tap***\*, stop.\* ***Tap tap tap tap tap tap tap***\*, stop.\* ***Tap tap tap***\*, stop.\*

***Tap tap tap tap tap tap***\*, stop.\* ***Tap tap tap tap tap tap tap***\*, stop.\* ***Tap tap tap***\*, stop.\*

***Tap tap tap tap tap tap***\*, stop.\* ***Tap tap tap tap tap tap tap***\*, stop.\* ***Tap tap tap***\*, stop.\*

\--------

That was about an hour ago.

I’ve locked myself in the bathroom closet, which is the only space that doesn’t have a one-way mirror.

Whoever Joanna is, *whatever* Joanna is, they haven’t tried to take my phone and my charger yet. An oversight on their part that I’m attempting to take advantage of.

Does anyone recognize [this sculpture?](https://imgur.com/a/pG6mDk4)

Nothing is coming up on google, and I need information.

9-1-1 is still not working, and the creaking is getting closer.
