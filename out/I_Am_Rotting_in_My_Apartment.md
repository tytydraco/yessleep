Forgive me. I'm so tired. My skin is crawling all over. As I lay here, laptop on my chest, I can't find the energy to do anything but write. So, write I will.

I signed the lease in late May after acquiring my new job. It was an austere brick building with a dingy tile-floored lobby lit by yellow bulbs that maintenance never seemed to replace. A single palm plant sat beside an ancient elevator system which screeched like a hundred nails on chalkboards each time it opened. A perpetual puddle decorated the corner by the double glass doors; from pipe leakage or rain I did not know. Rent was cheap. It was perfect.

Move-in only took half a day. I don't own much. The mattress was the most arduous task. A heavy rain began just as I was sliding it out of the van. I hadn't thought to bring a plastic cover. I was considering the potential damage of dragging fabric across wet asphalt when a man cleared his throat behind me.

"Looks like you could use some help!"

I turned to see an incredibly tall and broad man. He was dressed in a stretched white tank top and paint-stained cargo shorts. Maybe late forties. Older than me, I guessed anyhow, based on his thin graying hair, which was aggressively slicked back with some kind of product. He had shiny black eyes and a wiry mustache styled into muttonchops, giving him the appearance of a retired pro wrestler. His teeth were very white. The mustache bobbed almost cartoonishly as he spoke.

"The name's Rick. Doorman, security, mailman... everything man. whatever you need I'm your guy."

This is how I came to know my jailer.

"Dan," I said by way of introduction. "Help would be nice."

Together we hauled the mattress into the elevator, sandwiching it between us. I always found it quaint that hotels and old apartments kindly omit floor thirteen when labeling their halls. The thing is, they can't do a thing to change the architecture itself. Counting from the ground up, I would still be making my home on the veritable thirteenth floor. I pressed the button for floor fourteen.

"Fourteen?" Rick gasped. He peered around the mattress to stare at me, his voice low. "You know what they say about floor fourteen tenants, don't you?"

"No..." I rocked onto my back heel, putting some space between us. "What do they say?"

Rick barked a laugh. "Absolutely nothing! You thought you were special?"

I laughed along, because that's what you do when someone's trying to break the ice. I didn't find it very funny.

Once we'd gotten the mattress back out of the elevator I thanked him again and he left me to it.

I approached my room alone. The brown tile hallway had a smell to it. Sweet and heady. One of my neighbors had an affinity for incense or fragrant cooking, I presumed. It wasn't unpleasant, but it was always there, I would soon discover. The smell never left.

I unlocked the door.

Inside, the scent was less overpowering. After leaning the mattress against the wall, I took a moment to just sit on the floor of the common room between overturned furniture and stacks of cardboard boxes. I was strangely exhausted. For whatever reason, I stretched out flat on that cool, uncarpeted floor, staring at the ceiling. There was no light fixture. I hadn't noticed that detail in the virtual photo tour. They never tell you everything.

I thought about my mother scolding me from the couch when I told her I was leaving for the city.

"It's not fair, Daniel," she'd said. "How can I take care of you when you're so far away?"

Really, she was the one who needed care more than I did. If anything, I'd felt guilty leaving her behind several states away. But one day I'd taken a walk around our small town, under an overcast sky, looking at those same few strips of concrete and dead grass and empty shopfronts, realized that it was slowly withering my soul. I had to get out.

\_\_

After unpacking, I was unbelievably tired.

As soon as I hit the pillow that evening, I was out like a light. My dreams were strange, full of syringes and bright lights and masked strangers with glassy eyes.

In the middle of the night, I was hit with a wave of nausea. My head throbbed. My chest felt as if it were being compressed in a vise. I stumbled to the bathroom and knelt, coughing and retching over the bowl.

Something in my throat dislodged itself and slid out of me, smooth and slippery and round.

It was an eye.

It bobbed there in the water, spinning slowly. My first instinct was to flush it away in horror, but it was so odd, so completely unbelievable, that I found myself fishing it out with a glass from the kitchen and setting it aside on the edge of the tub.

I studied it for a moment. Its surface was clean and pearly white aside from a thin strand of muscle tailing from the place where it would normally attach to the socket. The iris was a beautiful shade of dark brown, almost black, with flecks of amber. Its pupil was wide and empty, staring at nothing.

At some point I must have hobbled to bed again, because I woke up on my mattress in the morning.

What had jolted me awake was the shrill buzz of my apartment doorbell. It kept going until I dragged myself to the door. Through the peephole, I recognized the thick mustache and shiny eyes of Rick, the everything man.

I undid the deadbolt and Rick let himself in.

"Morning, Dan," he chirped.

He was holding a tray full of styrofoam to-go boxes. He handed me one labeled with my apartment number. "Breakfast," he explained. "Courtesy of management."

I thanked him. He pushed past me and began poking around at the AC unit. I figured he was just doing a routine inspection, so I let him carry on while I hung back the living room, awkwardly holding my box. I popped it open while I waited.

Inside, I found a plastic fork and a large cinnamon roll topped with green sprinkles. I hadn't eaten anything yet. The almost sickly sweet smell of the frosting was intoxicating.

Wordlessly, Rick surveyed the kitchen. I heard him open the fridge, which I had not yet stocked. I heard the faucet squeak on, then off again. Seemingly satisfied, he moved on to the bathroom. I heard the shower turn on and off again, then the faucet, and finally the flush of the toilet.

By the time he returned, I'd eaten the entire pastry. Rick gave me a once-over, like he was inspecting me, too. He gave a shiny, straight-toothed grin.

"You passed," he said.

Something in that smile unsettled me, but I brushed it off, mostly because I simply did not understand it at the time.

In retrospect, I think it was a kind of hunger.

Rick left without another word. I heard him whistling down the hall, keys jingling.

As I stood contemplating the interaction, my phone rang. I rushed to my desk.

I work in tech support. I am rarely required in the office. Most of my work is done from my PC or over the phone. It's not exciting, but it pays well. Plus, I don't have to leave the house unless I want to. For a homebody like me, this was a perk.

My client had just joined the call when I heard a scraping sound coming from the bathroom.

It was only at this moment that I remembered my midnight illness. Surely what I'd seen had been a bad dream, the byproduct of a nasty bout of food poisoning.

The scraping reached my ears once more.

Then, a crash.

I politely put my client on hold and ran to the bathroom. The glass cup had slipped off of the tub and shattered. I knelt down to pick up the glass, dreading what else I'd find lying on the tiles.

There it was, staring up at me from among the shards.

An eyeball.

The pastry churned in my stomach, threatening to come up. I gagged. That *thing* had come from inside of me.

Was this a rare sort of rare health condition? I combed my mind for any sort of explanation and came up short. Logic was running thin.

The fact remained: something very foreign had taken place within my own body.

The eye writhed like a tadpole.

I panicked. I grabbed a dustpan and swept it and the glass into the trash without ceremony.

I sat there for a few seconds, considering my options. The thought of it squirming in there, alive of its own accord, was too much to bear.

I grabbed a wad of toilet paper and fished the eye out of the can. Through the thin paper I could feel it wriggling beneath the pads of my fingers like some kind of mutated roach.

I booked it to the kitchen, dropped the vile thing down the drain, and ran the garbage disposal until it had been sufficiently pulped. After that, I ran the water for another minute or two until I was satisfied that any trace of flesh had gone.

I sank down against the counter. A cold film of sweat coated my forehead and neck.

I didn't know what to do from there. My body felt heavy, tired beyond belief. The thought of leaving the apartment suddenly seemed as impossible as lifting a semi-truck. I cancelled my work call and went back to bed.

An hour later, I got another call. It was Rick.

"Dan the man," he said, peppy as ever. "Come downstairs whenever you've got a minute. Management wants to see you."

\_\_

The office was nicer than the rest of the building. It was a pristine, freezing cold room in the basement of the complex. The walls were pale green, the floor and ceiling a minimal, tiled white. It felt and smelled like a doctor's office.

I sat on a hard, upholstered green chair facing an empty desk. On top of this desk rested a placard labeled "Resident Management" in embossed lettering. Beyond the desk was a wide, opaque white window. As I waited, a shadow appeared behind this window. The person's silhouette was made fuzzy by the tinted glass.

A smooth feminine voice crackled down from some hidden loudspeaker in the room, speaking my unit number.

"That's correct," I said. "Why did you want to see me?"

"It has come to our attention that you breached our agreement today."

"What do you mean?" I shifted in my chair uncomfortably.

The person behind the glass gave an exasperated sigh.

"When you signed with us, you agreed that no damage would come to the contents of your apartment."

I was stunned. "With all due respect, I just moved in yesterday. I've barely had a chance to unpack." The speaker remained silent, so I pressed further. "What damage could I have possibly done?"

"All contents must remain undisturbed," the voice said, emphasis on the "all." She sounded more irritated than anything. "This especially includes organic materials. Did you gloss over that paragraph within your lease?"

"I... I'm afraid I don't know what you mean." My head spun. Though I hated the implications, they could only be referring to the thing I'd just disposed of in my kitchen sink.

I heard a pen click, then the sound of scribbling on paper.

Beneath the window, a slot creaked open. A rubber-gloved hand poked through, shoving a stack of papers onto the desk.

"Please review the document," said the voice. "We operate on a three strike system here. You are on your first infraction. Two more, and we will be left with no choice but termination. I have circled the relevant section."

I opened my mouth but couldn't find the words. I just took the packet and began to read.

It was my lease. Each page contained my initials in the corner, as well as that of the property manager. I located the circled paragraph:

*Tenant must not destroy or otherwise inflict damage upon any and all contents of the apartment, including blinds, windowpanes, countertops, walls, ceilings, or floors, doors, misc accommodations, and especially organic materials. Organic materials include but are not limited to body of tenant (see: tissue, fluid, bone, hair) and additional bodily expulsions.*

*Preservation of the apartment ecosystem is of paramount importance to the success of this community and its objective. Failure to comply will be addressed by management on a strike system. Upon the third strike, management reserves the right to terminate the offending tenant.*

This section was new. It had to be. But there were my initials neatly printed in my handwriting. I flipped to the final page to find my full name printed in bold and my signature scrawled on the line below.

"This can't be legal," I said. "I never agreed to this."

"You said that you'd say that." Her flat, matter-of-fact tone made my blood boil.

"Can you explain what the hell is going on before I get a lawyer?" I said, standing so abruptly that my chair tipped over.

She laughed at this. "I'm afraid that won't be possible."

A musical chime sounded over the speaker.

From a white, nearly invisible door to my left emerged two people in pale green hazmat suits. Thick visors shielded their faces from my view as they grappled my arms with surprising strength. I struggled, screaming in protest. I felt a piercing pain in my neck, and the world was cloaked in cotton.

Everything felt light. I was gliding out of the room, being lifted on some kind of dolly. I craned my head to see who was pushing me. A familiar wide grin and wiry mustache slid into view, distorted and alien.

"Hey, champ," Rick said. "Let's get you back to your unit."

\_\_

Since that first day, I have been living in a state of total fear and isolation. I don't know what this place is, but I know that it is making me very ill. All the while, they're watching my progress from somewhere beyond these dingy walls. If I follow the rules, things are easier.

I don't leave. I get my groceries delivered and take all of my appointments online.

I have tried to run. Rick always finds me before I make it through those double doors and out into the sunlight. He is the sentry of this ancient building I have come to despise. He is always smiling, even as he wrestles me to the ground, even as he drags me back to my own unit door with its peeling paint and rusted metal numbers. I don't think he's even human.

I've grown accustomed to the smell of the body as it falls apart.

It's not just eyes now. Pieces of vertebrae and swatches of sinew clutter my fridge in pitchers and plastic containers. Strange butterfly-clusters of ears cling to the lamps and windows in shuddering sheets of flesh. Strips of gums and teeth crawl like inchworms across my countertops.

Furthermore, something is wrong with my skin. Every night, I feel it fluttering and pulsing, as if it, too, wants to replicate exponentially,

to multiply,

to escape.

I'm pretty sure I'm breaking protocol just by writing this account. If anyone finds this, know that I am alive, but I am rotting all the same.

I don't know how much longer I have. Last night, an entire hand crawled from my throat.

The apartment buzzer just rang. I already know who it is.
