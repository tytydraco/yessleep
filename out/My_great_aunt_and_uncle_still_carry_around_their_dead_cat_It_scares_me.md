 Hi. Can anyone give me advice on what to do? I’m 14 and i’ve been living with my great aunt, great uncle, and their “cat”, Sox (if I can even call it that anymore). Of course, I love my great aunt and uncle, but their cat is very much dead. 

   They loved that old furball a lot,  but he died when I was about eleven. They treat it better than they treat me and my brother, in all honesty. I know people cope with grief differently, but it’s just a cat skeleton with a coat of skin and fur (definitely not the cats original fur. It’s not even the same color.) hanging off it, maggots crawling on it, and weirdly large and healthy eyes for how long it’s been dead. As someone who has loved animals all my life, it really freaks me out. I imagine it would disturb any sane person. 

Like, imagine being in my position. Your parents are on a trip, you only have your little brother (who refuses to go near our great aunt, great uncle, or the gross cat-corpse thing) and a stuffed shark, and you’re sure the people you’re staying with are absolutely delusional. Like yesterday night. 

   As I was going to the restroom I saw my great aunt muttering to the “cat” in the room she shared with my great uncle. I thought it’d be interesting, because she always had their room’s door closed and wouldn’t allow me or my brother inside. She was saying the usual things people say to their pets, until she pet its head and one of its eyes fell out. Gross.   
   She cursed under her breath and began to walk to the closet. Her closet had a lock, which was immediately suspicious. I mean, who locks their closet? She put in a 4 number code that I believe started with 3 and grabbed something from her closet. It was floppy and limp. Looked like a stuffed animal. I watched as she set it down on a towel on her nightstand, reached into its eye socket, and popped one of its eyes out. It was bleeding. It was fucking bleeding. It was a real cat, and a freshly dead one at that. 

   Obviously I wasn’t going to stay there after seeing my aunt pick out a cat corpse from her closet that wasn’t Sox, so I snuck out of there as quick as I could. I don’t think she saw me, but i’m still scared. If my great aunt can so casually pluck an eye out of a dead cat and carry the corpse of another around, i don’t even want to think about what she could do to me and my brother. 

   When they get back, i’m telling my parents that I don’t want to stay with my great aunt and uncle again. I don’t know if they just collect dead cats from like.. pet morgues or something, or if she’s killing them, but I know Sox has had 4 different color eyes since I’ve been here, and that fur isn‘t his.
