When I was a child, I lived in a house saturated with religious objects, as if faith were less a belief and more a form of surveillance. There were two crucifixes. One hung in my bedroom: fluorescent, cheap, and ugly, glowing faintly in the dark like it refused to let the night exist. The other was in my parents’ room. That one was different. Larger. Realistic to an uncomfortable degree. Every wound carefully carved, every rib visible, the face frozen in pain. It hung in the exact center of the wall, facing the bed. There was no way around it. It was the last thing you saw before sleeping and the first thing you saw when you woke up.

At the time, it felt normal. Not healthy—just familiar. And familiarity has a way of disguising damage.

What was never normal was the atmosphere. The house was tense in the way a body is tense before being hit. My parents fought constantly, violently, without structure or restraint. There were no rules, no cooling-off moments. Just shouting, threats, insults meant to humiliate. Machismo wasn’t an idea; it was the air. Tolerance was nonexistent. Everything lived at the edge of hatred.

I remember one afternoon with unsettling clarity. My mother pressed a hot iron against my father’s face. She didn’t burn him, but she wanted him to feel how close it was. The threat mattered more than the injury. After that, we lived trained to listen. To recognize tone shifts. To calculate danger by volume. I learned to be alert even while asleep.

Nightmares became routine. Not elaborate dreams—just abrupt awakenings, heart racing, jaw clenched, the sense that something was wrong before I even opened my eyes. One night, I woke up like that and went to the bathroom. My body moved automatically, still half inside the dream. When I came out, I looked down the hallway toward my parents’ room.

The crucifix was there.

It looked larger than it should have, closer. The body appeared wet, darker than usual, as if the shadows had thickened. The blood—painted, sculpted, familiar—seemed suddenly excessive. Too vivid. Not symbolic anymore. It felt like an accusation. Like something that had been watching everything and was now refusing to stay quiet about it.

I didn’t think it was alive. I didn’t think it was moving. What terrified me was how real it felt in that moment, how my mind could no longer separate the image from the violence it oversaw every day. The blood looked fresh because the house was fresh with it. Because I had already learned what it meant to live surrounded by threat.

I felt sick. My stomach tightened, my legs went weak. I didn’t scream. I didn’t wake anyone. I turned around and went back to my room as fast as I could, closed the door, and got into bed. I lay there staring at the darkness, waiting for my heart to slow down, listening for footsteps, for shouting, for anything.

Years later, I understand that memory doesn’t always return as a story. Sometimes it comes back as an image with too much clarity. An image that doesn’t explain itself, because it doesn’t need to. The body recognizes it immediately. The fear is already there.

What stayed with me wasn’t the crucifix itself. It was the feeling that even the walls were watching, recording everything, silently approving the damage. That the image on the wall wasn’t there to save anyone—only to witness it all and make sure it was never forgotten.

And sometimes, without warning, it still isn’t.
