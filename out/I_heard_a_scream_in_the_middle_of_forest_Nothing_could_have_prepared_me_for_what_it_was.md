I took a day off to clear my head. I was admitted to hospital a day before due to fainting. After blood results came back normal, the doctor said it’s purely psychological. I tried arguing, but the doctor insisted that I was most likely overworked and that I needed rest. Deep down, I knew he was right. Since my company’s merger, most of the paperwork fell on me, and I felt as if I was trying to be at two places at once.



He prescribed some of the blood pressure medication, but more importantly, he suggested I should take a vacation, somewhere in nature, and far away from people. As soon as I came home, I turned on the computer and looked up places near me. I loved hiking as a teenager, so I found a small town nearby, with a wonderful mountain trail. Most of the comments were five stars, however some of the negative ones caught my attention, people claiming they had a weird feeling of not being alone on the trail, a constant feeling of being watched.



I knew that feeling very well, our brains tend to be overly paranoid when it comes to being alone in the middle of woods, so I brushed the comments off. Not my first rodeo. I dug out my old boots, favorite green shirt, hiking pants and a backpack, and drove almost three hours to reach the town that very afternoon.



I arrived somewhere in the afternoon, around 2 PM, checking into a local motel. The place was small, but beautiful, placed at the foot of the mountain, dense evergreen forest rising above the calm lake, with a naked mountaintop that must have had a magnificent view as a prize for the long hike. 



I asked the receptionist how long it takes to reach the top, and she told me somewhere between two or three hours. Perhaps I should have waited for the morning, but seeing the sharp top of the mountain bathed in the afternoon sun filled me with such excitement that I could not have waited.



I grabbed the backpack and a bottle of water, leaving my phone in a hurry. Maybe even on purpose, as I wanted to be disconnected from people as much as possible. The asphalt road turned into an earthen trail, warping around the edge of the lake, slowly leading into a thicker and thicker forest, dense pine trees allowing just faint slivers of sunlight to pierce through them here and there, turning warm afternoon into chilly and crisp forest twilight.



Half an hour into the hike, the straight, flat trail turned into the curvy, rising one. A deep valley started stretching towards left, with dim mist forming forwards bottom, and a steep slope to the right, an impenetrable wall of trees forming a natural barrier above, dots of blue sky visible only through slow dance of pines, as their skirts swayed under the occasional gusts of wind.



The trail began getting steeper, and the minutes turned into what felt like hours, wearing me down enough to stop and catch my breath. I reached into my pocket by the reflex to check the time, and remembered I had left my phone in a room. I did not wear a watch, and with very little sunlight, it became difficult to tell the time. 



Just as I was debating whether I should give up and go back before night could reach me, I heard a muttered shriek up ahead on the trail that froze the blood in my veins. 



Every instinct screamed inside me to just turn around and run, but I had to check. It might have been another hiker that needed help. I started walking slowly on the curved path, unable to see what was behind the corner. Another scream came, but this time, I could clearly hear the words.



***“Let me leave! Please let me leave!”***



This time I needed no convincing from my instincts. Something was very off here, and I didn’t dare checking what. I turned around the trail, and I ran for so long, until fatigue eventually caught up with me. I bended, hands on my knees, letting my lungs catch up, but also lowering the tone of my breathing as much as possible, trying to hear something. Anything.



The woods were silent. Way too silent. Aside from the breeze squeezing though heavy forest that made leaves hiss silently, nothing else could be heard. I found that more unsettling than calming, more so, I had a strong feeling of being followed. I went on as another hour passed, maybe, and the trail seemed never to be never ending. I don’t know if it was because I was trying to leave as soon as possible or because everything looked more or less the same. 



I passed the corner of the trail in a hurry, my shirt caught on the thorns of the bush, growing by the trail. A piece of my favorite green shirt was left hanging on the bush, but I did not care. I just kept walking, passing another corner several meters in front, this time a bit more carefully, not to scrape another bush.



Adrenaline rush and fear from the scream must have distorted my sense of time. I looked up, the sunlight pierced trees in the same manner, which meant it was still the day. It did not feel like it should have been a day, by my objective feeling, so much time has passed that by now it should have been the night. I brushed off the feeling, continuing down a descending curved road, not waiting to check if someone, or *something,* was really following me.



I had to stop again soon, as muscles in my legs were burning from the long walk, and a new type of fear started to creep on me. Have I been lost? I have been walking back for so long, way longer than it took me to get upwards, right to the place where I heard the scream. No matter, that must mean that it should take no more than an hour, and I will finally be out of this forsaken place.



I kept walking and walking, for what seemed another hour, my anxiety and fear growing bigger with each step.I thought about leaving the trail, and heading straight down over the curved slope. I immediately pushed the thought back. That is how most of the hikers get lost, by leaving the trail. So I started running. I just wanted to be back in my motel bed, and out of this gloomy forest.



I ran and I ran, left and right, left and right, through the ceaseless curved path. As I cut the corner I felt sharp pain on my torso and I stopped with a yelp. A bush scratched my exposed side, and what I saw made me run cold sweat. On the bush that scratched me, there was something. A piece of fabric. Green fabric, like the one I had ripped from my shirt earlier. In agony of realisation, before I could contain myself, a scream left my mouth.

“*Let me leave! Please let me leave!”*
