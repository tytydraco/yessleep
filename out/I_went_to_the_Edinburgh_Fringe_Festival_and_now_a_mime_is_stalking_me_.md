This happened last week and I really don’t know what to do. I didn’t know where else to post this or who to tell, so here we are. 

Firstly, one thing you should know about me is that I hate street performers. I hate the live music. I hate the comedians. I hate the juggling knives whilst jumping through a ring of fire people. Can’t stand any of it, not for me - so sue me. 

But having lived in Edinburgh, Scotland for the past 7 years and NEVER having attended the world-famous ‘Edinburgh Fringe Festival’ seemed a little wasteful. I mean I grew up in a wee village on the Scottish Borders and always dreamed of moving to Edinburgh, and it’s been great: the old architecture, the rich history running through the city and of course the magnificent castle standing on the hill in the centre. But every August for those 4 weeks while Fringe Fest is going on, I will lock myself away and not be heard from. 

As you can tell, really fucking hate street performers. 

I had a wee bit of a bad experience with one when I was younger, but I won’t go into it. 

So aye, this year I thought I should just face my fears and get on with it. See some of the city while it’s the time of year where it’s most full of life. What a mistake that was. I got to Old Town, where most of the acts take place (also where some of Harry Potter was filmed, a fun fact for the non-Scots) and was immediately overwhelmed by the scene. The cobble streets and iconic buildings of the Royal Mile were littered with tourists from across the world.  On top of that, was the dozens of street performers that covered every spare corner of every building there was. Each of them with their hat or case or bucket or whatever they were collecting the change of the ‘generous’ Scottish public with right in front of them. 

I took a deep breath, and immersed myself in the crowd. And it was great to start with. 

I joined in with everyone laughing at the juggling comedy act, listened sorrowfully to an extremely talented violinist and held my breath whilst a daredevil walked a tightrope. 

Huh, maybe these street performers ain’t much of a pain in the arse after all?

Then I saw him. 

The man that would haunt me. The man that’s ruining my life. 

He was stood right at the end of the street, on what seemed to be the only quiet corner there was to stand on. There was no crowd there, barely even any passersby - definitely no one giving him a second look. He was a mime. And true to the spirit of his ‘act’, he had the strange getup of a mime too. His face was painted all white, with two black paint slits going through his eyes from his forehead to his cheek. He had a very old fashioned black suit on, with broad shoulders and dust all over it - making it appear grey. The only colour was the tuft of pink hair atop his head, that looked very out of place with the rest of his outfit. 

Weird bastard, I instantly thought. 

However the following thought was: 
‘Come on, Ewan, where’s your empathy?’

Fuck it. What’s the worst that can happen?

I began walking over to him. Out of sympathy more than anything, see his act had already started. He wasn’t like the rest of these performers that would draw a big crowd before they began (to maximise £’s in there hats I’d imagine), he had started without a single person watching him. Weird bastard indeed. But weirdly admirable in a way too. He did the whole ‘trapped in a box’ bit, the ‘picking up the telephone and going down the stairs’ one too. It seemed very amateurish and basic to be doing at the prestigious Edinburgh Fringe Festival, but who am I to judge. I finally got in front of him and looked down at the little cardboard sign he had in front of him. Scrawled in extremely messy handwriting it wrote:

‘The Most Breath-Taking Show on Earth’

‘TIPS APPRECIATED’

I had a chuckle and looked back up at the mime. He was looking at me now. And he had a huge, haunting grin on his face. His eyes had widened, and I wanted to leave right then - but something kept me there. Something kept me as he continued his act. He mimed tripping over something that wasn’t there, he did some ‘fishing’ and then ‘drove a car’. It was all stuff I thought a child could do, to be honest. Very underwhelming, and that’s when I should’ve left. Ya bloody idiot. 

But I didn’t. 

Instead he finished up his act, and pointed to his small upturned bowlers cap on the floor. Pointed for a tip? Ha! Fat chance! I didn’t even fork out for the daredevil, was I fuck gonna fork out for some shite mime! I should’ve turned and left, but some stupid part of my brain thought I had to give him some ‘justification’. 

‘Sorry mate, I just didn’t understand what was so breathtaking about it. Not much change any-‘

As I was explaining a huge worried expression came onto his face. Almost panic, before he started miming tying a noose. He put his head through the ‘gap’, and tightened it. But then his face started contorting. I first saw his eyes widen slightly. Then his eyes begin to grimace. The veins started popping out of his forehead and the redness in his face shone through his white painted makeup. 

‘Mate, what are you doing!’ 

All he did was point at the ‘breathtaking’ word on his sign. 

I looked back up from my brief glance down and his nose had now began to bleed from the strain of no oxygen. I could see his eyes beginning to flutter. 

Fuck! Was he really doing this! This wasn’t miming, he actually couldn’t breathe. 

‘Fine! Fine!’

I reached into my pocket and tossed a handful of change into his hat. Probably about 80p, not much or anything, but it was the only way I could think to make him stop. And he did. He took an extravagant bow, and on his way up looked at me through his eyebrows, with that huge grin again. 

Fuck this. I turned and walked away, back to the crowds of people. But something possessed me to turn back around, to take one last look at this freak. 

But he was gone. No sign of him or his hat, or his sign. How the fuck did he get out of view that quick? And why? He makes 80p and calls it a day? I shook it off and decided to go to the pub, needed a pint to calm my nerves. 

I was at the pub a few hours. Aye, I like a drink - even if it’s on me own. By the time I left it had gotten to about 8 or 9pm, and I was ready to just hop on the bus back to my flat (apartment if you’re an American). Sitting on the X25 bus on route to the outskirts of the city, I had a strange feeling. Very cliché, I know, but it‘s true. A feeling of being watched. I looked behind me to the few other empty seats and tried to calm myself down. Just chalked it up to my weird encounter earlier in the day. 

I got home to the flat and Jasper jumped up onto my lap straight away. He’s my wee cat, a black Scottish fold with lovely green eyes - he’s a sweetheart. I’d began cooking myself some food, when I heard it. When I heard him. 

I was stood in the kitchen, when I caught his reflection on the kitchen window opposite me. The mime from before. He was tiptoeing up to me, in an over-exaggerated, cartoonish way. I spun round in an instant, and there he was with that same chilling grin. Now stood at the door between my kitchen and living room. He raised up his right hand, covered by his white butler gloves, and gave me a small wave. I tried to spurt out some kind of insult or threat, but all that came out was a whimper. 

He raised up his left hand, and in a slow theatrical motion, began to use it to take the white glove off of his other hand. 

To take the glove off of his hand and show me the stump that was underneath it. All of his fingers, severed. 

I froze in fear and shock. Unable to act or do anything. He began the mime of how the happened, or I assume so, by raising his left hand and ‘cutting’ the fingers off of his right one. Letting out these inaudible screams as he did so, screams that looked so real. I looked back up to his face, and he was crying. Feint tear lines were emerging on his cheeks, leaving two distinct tracks on his white face. His smile still remained though, juxtaposing his teary eyes. 

He began to mime putting a gun to his head. 

He took a step towards me. 

He mimed himself cocking the barrel. 

He took another step. 

He opened his mouth, and ‘rested’ the gun in there. 

He took a final step towards me. 

He pulled the imaginary trigger. 

But what wasn’t imaginary, was his head exploding all over my kitchen walls. Blood and parts of brain everywhere. Small white bone particles even. I threw up, I’m not ashamed to admit. 

The rest of that night I blacked out, I knew in my head I couldn’t call that police - how ridiculous would this sound? A man blew his head off with no gun? In my kitchen? Just leaving the headless corpse of a mime in an old suit? No way would they believe that. I began deep cleaning the whole kitchen, I scrubbed and scrubbed and got all the blood and ‘other stuff’ cleaned up. I used three bottles of bleach and even had to splash some cologne under my nose at one point to hide the smell. 

What the fuck should I do with his body? 

I’ve got it dumped in an old suitcase now, but don’t know what to do with it - any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. 

Fuck, I’m asking reddit how to hide a body? 

I did find a card in his suit pocket, that was it. It was a business card for some circus or something, just called ‘The Fun House’ with a telephone number. 

So aye, that was more or less where I was up to. Freaked out beyond belief and retching with anxiety every night. 

Then last night came along. 

I was doing the dishes, staring out the same kitchen window that I first saw his reflection - when I saw something out in the carpark. It was a quick shadow, something darted between the cars. It was when I focused my eyes, I could see more clearly. 

Another fucking mime. 

Almost identical to the first one, but this one had a shaved head and small bowler hat. Same old suit though and same makeup. 

But this one was dancing, almost. It was like a waltz or something, using the quick movements to dart between cars - but doing it in this unmistakable dancing motion. He stopped, and looked up at me. Straight into my eyes. Before he took a bow, and upon looking back up - the same chilling smile on his face. I could see his yellow teeth even through the window into the dark carpark. 

Then he mimed one last action. 

He pointed at his own eyes, and then at me. Then he pulled a long, rusty knife from his jacket pocket - and pointed that at me too. 

I closed my eyes and wished for it all to be over. The rotting corpse in my suitcase. The mime with the knife outside. I opened them up again, and he was gone. 

All he left was the paranoia the whole event instilled in me. 

Oh, and the fingerprints all over my kitchen window I woke up to this morning. The finger prints, and the feint outline in white paint of a face pressed up on the glass.
