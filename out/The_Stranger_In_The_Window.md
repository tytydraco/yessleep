I turned 13, and my family moved into this old two-story house in a small town. My bedroom was situated on the first floor; it had this huge window that faced a forested area. At first, I loved it—the house had character, and my room was cozy. However, things started to feel wrong.

It began one night when I had just lain in bed. My curtains were open, and I could make out the dark shapes of trees swaying gently outside. Lying there, I felt a prickling sensation, as if someone was staring at me. I passed it off as my imagination, but each night, this feeling of being watched grew stronger, invading my thoughts until I could hardly sleep.

One night, just as I was about to drift off, I heard a light, steady tapping on my window. So slight that it might have been my imagination, yet it continued: tap, tap, tap. My heart pounded in my chest. Part of me wanted to ignore it, but I couldn’t help myself. Slowly, I turned my head, and that was when I saw it.

A face: pale, expressionless, staring right at me through the glass. The features were shadowy, but the eyes glinted with an otherworldly intensity. I froze, too terrified to move or scream. The figure itself didn’t budge; it just watched me. Then, as suddenly as it appeared, it backed away into the darkness and vanished.

I hardly slept that night. I told my parents, but they brushed it off as a nightmare or a trick of the light. I knew what I had seen, and I felt the weight of their disbelief pressing down on me.

Determined to feel safe, I made a conscious effort to close my curtains tighter. But at about the same time the next night, the tapping began anew—soft and patient against the glass. It felt as if it were waiting for me. I lay still, hands clenched in my covers, and after what felt like hours, the tapping stopped.

The next morning, I wanted to investigate. Outside my window, I found something strange: a faint footprint in the dirt, as though someone had stood there for a long time. It led away toward the woods, disappearing into the underbrush.

A week later, my parents surprised me by pruning some bushes around the window. I hadn’t wanted to go near that part of the house in days, but curiosity got the better of me. As my dad pulled one of the larger branches back, he froze.

There, wedged between the leaves, was a tattered gray swatch of cloth—a shirt. Shredded and filthy, but unmistakably human. In jagged handwriting on the inside, the words read, "I can see you."

I begged my parents to switch my room to the second floor, and though they didn't understand why, they agreed. Once I was moved, the feeling of being watched seemed to fade.

But I never forgot. Sometimes, while passing the old room, I felt a chill run down my spine—a nagging sensation that I was not alone. It was as if the darkness beyond my window still held secrets, and somewhere out there, the face watched and waited, biding its time.

And every now and then, when the wind rustled the trees just right, I could swear I heard that soft, patient tapping on the glass, echoing in my mind, a reminder of the stranger who once peered into my world.
