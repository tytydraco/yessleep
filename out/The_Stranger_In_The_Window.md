I turned 13, and my family moved into this old two-story house in a small town. My bedroom was situated on the first floor; it had this huge window that faced a forested area. At first, I loved it—the house had some character, and my room was cozy. However, things started to feel wrong.

It started one night when I had just lain in bed. My curtains were open, and I could make out the dark shapes of trees swaying gently outside. Lying there, I felt this unusual sense of prickling, as if someone was staring at me. I passed it off as imagination, but during succeeding days, this feeling of being watched kept coming back stronger.

One night, just as I was about to fall asleep, I heard a light, steady tapping on my window. So slight it might have been my imagination, yet it continued. Tap. Tap. Tap. I sat up, my heart pounding. Part of me did not want to look; however, part of me did force myself. Slowly, I turned my head, and that was when I saw it.

A face: pale, expressionless, staring right at me through the glass. The features were shadowed; the eyes, though, they glinted with some strange, otherworldly intensity. I froze, too terrified to move or scream. The figure itself didn't move, either; it just watched me. Then, just as suddenly as it had appeared, it backed away into the darkness and vanished.

I did not sleep much that night. I told my parents, who just chalked it up to some kind of nightmare or a trick of the light. I knew what I had seen.

A few nights later, I made a conscious effort to close my curtains tighter. But at about the same time of night, the tapping started afresh: a soft, patient tap-tap-tap against the glass. Halted there, it might have been waiting for me. I lay perfectly still, my hands clenched in the covers, and after some hours—it felt like—it stopped again.

The next morning, I wanted to see if there was something outside, indicating an individual lurked around my house. That is when I saw something strange. Right in the dirt, just outside my window, was a faint footprint, as though someone had stood there, not moving, for a long time. They led away toward the woods where they disappeared.

I thought it would be, but a week later, my parents surprised me by pruning some bushes around the window. I hadn't exactly been hot to get near that section of wall in the intervening days, so I hadn't gotten a much closer look. Then, my dad reached one of his big bushes and froze as he pulled it backward.

There, wedged between the branches, was a tattered gray swatch of cloth—a shirt. Shredded and filthy, but unmistakably human. And in faint, jagged handwriting on the inside of the fabric, the words read, "I can see you." Later, I begged to switch my room to the second floor. My parents never understood why, but they did it. Never again did I see that face, but sometimes, while passing that old room, I swear I feel someone… watching.
