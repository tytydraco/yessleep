As I stood over the carcass laying in front of me I felt like I couldn't move. 

Maybe there was some residual shock from the crash, but I feel that it was just a small part of it. 

It's that the more I looked, the less sense everything made. Everything I knew started to feel just slightly wrong. I had lived in these woods my whole life and had never seen anything like that. 

I had run over a few animals before. On accident I mean, of course, it happens when you live around these parts, but it would always leave me a deep sadness for days. 

There isn't much you can do about it, it's not like wild animals are taught to check the road before crossing, they just do, and always at the worst time. 

It felt different this time. 

Something inside me told me it was a good thing this happened. That I had done a good thing, accidentally, but a good thing nonetheless. 

That thing did not look benevolent, unlike anything else that belonged to this forest.

It looked like something more dangerous than an apex predator, something above the food chain. Above us. 

The first thing that struck me was its limbs. Some of them were now crooked from the impact with my car, but that actually made them look less abnormal. 

They were long, thin, and sharp like a sort of blade. It's the only way I could describe it. It felt like their only purpose was to move and kill.

I started thinking about something I had heard sometime before that night. A couple of hunters had warned the town something new was living in the woods. 

They had found a dead bear while out hunting but said that what killed it couldn't have been a wolf or a big cat of some sort, since it wouldn’t make sense for them to cause a scene like the one they found.

They said there was blood everywhere. The bear had its rib cage sliced open and its heart ripped out of it. 

What killed it didn't take a single bite out of the body, and neither did any of the other animals. It's like something had marked its territory and asserted its dominance in the woods.

They said the forest looked deserted, that it was completely silent as if something had scared everything away. 

No one believed them at that time. The town just issued a wolf warning some days later, and it wasn't even the first time they came into town, so no one got too worked up about it. 

That story made a lot more sense now. 

Its skin was of a dark tone, more specifically, it reminded me of the dark blue color fingers turn when they get frostbite. 

It also had this weird quality of blending with the darkness, like a camouflage of some sort, but for shadows. The edges of the body kept blending with the darkness of the asphalt. 

Where I live nights are very dark so that's probably why I couldn't notice it in time to react. The road I travel for work or go home is full of blind turns, and it's while I was driving on one of those that the accident happened, but I think that even if I had enough time I wouldn't be able to see it anyway. 

You could have it right beside you and not notice it if it was just slightly dark outside, but at that point, you'd probably be dead anyway. 

I crouched to inspect it. Its skin was harder and colder than anything I had ever felt on a living being before, and the smell was… Well, there was no smell. 

It felt like the perfect creature in some sense. Perfect for hunting or surviving anything, the weather, or attacks by other animals. It could show up and disappear like nothing ever happened. It would leave no trace. Nothing to go off of. 

Its face laid against the concrete. 

I thought about it hard before taking a look. 

I already knew that if I had turned its head to take a look at it I'd never forget it. That it would haunt my dreams forever and never leave me alone.

So I did. 

I pushed its cranium to roll it over. There were some hairs on the top of its head, only a few strands. The face was like a skull. It reminded me a lot of a human one, and I tried to believe it wasn't at the moment. 

It had holes where its eyes and nose should be and its mouth was quite small but stuck in a malevolent grin. It looked like the head of a corpse left to rot but that never fully did.

I looked at its lifeless face for a while. I waited for it to open its eyes and look at me because I feared that if I turned around and headed back to my car it would get me. That it would rip me apart and steal my heart like it did with that bear. 

Then, it twitched. A jolt of life coursed through its body.

I dropped its head, fell back on the cement, and backed away as that thing, while struggling, began to stand lifting one limb after another.

It turned its head to look at me dead in the eyes. There was a dim light inside its eye sockets, and it was enough to read what it was feeling.

That thing was full of anger, spite, and hate, but for some reason toward me, as if we had met before. As if I had wronged it even before hitting it with my car. It probably wasn't an accident after all, it was just trying to get close to me.

A light coming from behind us interrupted the moment.

It was my dad. When I didn't come home at the usual time he set out to check if I hadn't crashed somewhere on the way home since it wouldn't have been the first time. 

The time it took to turn my head away was enough. 

I felt a breeze and very light tapping on the road's cement. When I turned back to look at that thing it was gone.

He asked me what I was doing in the middle of the road like that and I couldn't really explain myself at the time. 

I didn't know how to explain what happened, so I said that I had hit a deer, although the totaled front of my car raised some questions about the validity of my claims since a deer could never render a car useless like that. 

Some time has passed since that night. I've been feeling its presence lately. Growing closer and closer, and ever so evil. It lurks in the shadows, behind the trees, and always just outside of my view periphery.

Some days ago something struck a hunter. 

From what I was told it's exactly like what happened to that bear once. 

Chest ripped open, missing heart, nothing else done to the body, and the place where they found him becoming an eerily deserted part of the woods. 

But there was a new detail in the scene. A trail of dark liquid leading further into the woods. 

Apparently, that hunter was able to get a shot off.

That hunter was my father. 

I told him of the accident a few days after the crash. My story didn't sound new to him. Our family already had an encounter with that "spirit." 

The funeral was yesterday, and that thing showed up too. Far away, just at the edge of the woods next to the cemetery. It wasn't even a surprise to me after what I had been feeling lately. I expected it. 

It was standing in the snow on two feet, looking straight at me, mocking me, but it did look weakened. My dad had got him good.

I don't have much time left, but I know what to do. 

The night before he died, my father told me everything I needed to know, and more importantly how to stop it.

What I can tell you right now is that its name is [Clint](https://www.reddit.com/user/NoobNoSleeper/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button).
