**SETTING**

When I was younger I used to live in the middle of nowhere. We had neighbors but we were separated by a fairly large amount of land and lines of trees. This area I lived in is known for addicts, kidnappings, and overall a lot of sketchy things even though the population was small. I lived in an old schoolhouse on an old property that had a church, another school house, and an old graveyard that sat directly behind my house.

One night I was about 15, it was summer and I had been up all night playing old games I had installed on my PC. We had internet but it was one of those terrible limited services that only gave you like 2GB a month or something like that. I wasn't familiar to this type of lifestyle since I grew up playing video games online and watching YouTube so most of the time I just sat in silence if I wasn't watching a movie I'd already seen on DVD for the 20th time.

This night in particular it was 2 A.M. and my house was completely silent. I was wearing headphones while playing a game but during a moment of silence I heard rustling outside the house. We also had two dogs on the property and soon after hearing leaves rustling outside they started barking aggressively. I was also on the second floor of the house so I looked out my window and didn't see anything so I figured maybe it was just an animal or something else.

A few moments later though while trying to get rid of my paranoia loud thuds and screams immediately shot my adrenaline through the roof. My parents at the time had their room in the basement so my first reaction was to run downstairs and try and get there to get them. Luckily my step dad had already heard the noise and we met at the same time. We look over into the kitchen where our back patio was and saw some man beating on the door screaming for help. My step dad had went over to the door and began talking to him and noticed he was wearing a brown jacket and blue jeans and they were covered in blood.

My step dad began trying to ask him questions telling him to get back all while the guy was pleading trying to find any way into the house. The first question he asked was why he was covered in blood, to which the guy claimed he was shot and people were in the woods hunting him. This immediately caused my step dad to have me get a gun and to turn all the lights off in the house so if it was true they couldn't see where we were in the house. During all of this I remember my step dad telling him to show us his wound so we knew he wasn't lying. Sounds like a weird thing to ask but at the time the guy was being odd and he kept asking if he could get into our basement or would say things like I'm gonna climb through your window if you don't let me in.  Nevertheless the guy refused to show us that he had been hurt and eventually confessed that it wasn't his blood. I remember in this moment it made my heart drop.

In the middle of all of this the cops have already been called and the cops said they were by the house and for some stupid reason said to come outside so they could find the house. With my luck my step dad tells me to go out to the front porch and wave the cops down while he watched the guy on the back porch. This was the scariest moment for me cuz I was the one that had to go out and get the cops all while not knowing if he was alone or if other people were actually after him.

As I open the front door I see a few cop cars go right past our house not seeing me waving and I remember panicking telling them that they drove right past us. Eventually though the cops do arrive and I slam the front door and lock it again. I remember seeing bright lights shine on the guy at our back door and hearing police intercoms yelling at the guy telling him to get off the porch.

At the end of it all it turns out the guy was a druggie and he had family nearby and they apparently took him home and did nothing but drop him off. We never got to find out where the blood came from and how or why he even ended up at our house. This was one of many weird things that had happened while living there and i'm glad that I don't have to ever go to that place again.
