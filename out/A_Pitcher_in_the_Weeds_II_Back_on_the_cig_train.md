[It started with the manila folder.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1jkldy1/a_pitcher_in_the_weeds/)

The manila folder curled at its edges like the cigarette smoke I couldn’t seem to quit, twisting and rising into the stale air of my office. It hummed faintly against the desk, a vibration I could feel down to my bones, and the whispers grew louder every time I touched it. The schematics buzzed under my fingertips like static on an old TV, and the notes—half-scrawled warnings, half gibberish—seemed to shift when I wasn’t looking.

I hadn’t smoked in a month, but this case had me lighting up like I was trying to outrun my nerves. The first drag burned sharp, cutting through my throat like broken promises. The smoke lingered in the room, hanging heavy as if even it couldn’t escape.

Then came the knock on the door.

The cigarette dangled from my lips as I stared at the frosted glass that read, “Gary S. Kraft, Investigations.” The knock came again, sharper this time, and I ground the Lucky out in the overflowing ashtray on my desk. The door swung open before I even reached it.

“I’m Alice,” the girl said, stepping in and scanning the room like she was checking for traps. She clutched a battered flash drive in one hand, her other jittery at her side. “David told me where to find you.”

Her green eyes landed on the folder, narrowing like she already knew too much. “Marcela knows you have it,” Alice said. “She sent them. They’re coming.”

“‘Them,’ huh?” I said, lighting another cigarette from the smoldering butt of the last. The ember flared as I exhaled, keeping my voice calm even as my nerves prickled. “And what’s on that thing you’re holding?”

She didn’t answer right away, just glanced toward the window like she expected Marcela to climb through it. “We can’t talk here,” Alice said finally. “It’s not safe.”

She wasn’t wrong. The whispers in my head were louder now, curling around the edges of my thoughts and drowning out the last scraps of reason. I grabbed my coat, stuffed the folder into my bag, and nodded for her to follow. This wasn’t the kind of meeting you could hold in public, but I knew a place that was close and private enough to buy us time.

We slipped into the F train station at 7th Avenue, the fluorescent lights buzzing faintly as we waited for the train to screech in. The hum of the folder in my bag synced with the vibrations in the tracks, the ache building at the base of my skull. Alice clung to the flash drive like it might save us, while I worked through another cigarette. The smoke curled around us, thick and acrid, catching the flicker of the lights above.

The train rattled us to an old dive bar a few stops down, the kind of place where people kept their heads low and didn’t ask questions. Its boiler room had been my bolt-hole once or twice before, and the owner didn’t mind me using it as long as I kept his name out of it.

The air in the cramped space was damp and stale, clinging to the back of my throat. Alice wasted no time, jamming the flash drive into my battered laptop and glancing toward the bag at my side. “The folder,” she said. “We’ll need it.”

I hesitated, the whispers clawing at my mind like nails on glass. Every instinct told me to leave it closed, but I handed it over anyway, watching as Alice opened it carefully, like it might bite her.

David’s face flickered onto the laptop screen, hollow-eyed and pale. His voice cracked when he spoke, the words trembling but clear. “Resonance isn’t just a project,” he muttered. “It’s alive. It learns. It adapts. Every mind it touches—it grows stronger.”

He stopped, glancing off-screen as static swallowed the edges of the video. “Marcela lied,” he said, louder now. “It’s not about progress. It’s about control. Burn it. Burn everything before it spreads.”

The video cut out, replaced by a single word flashing in sharp white: RUN.

Alice staggered back from the screen, clutching her head as the whispers roared louder. The boiler hissed behind us, the shadows in the room stretching unnaturally as the lights began to flicker. I pulled out another cigarette with trembling hands, the ember flaring brighter as the shadows started to move.

They poured out of the walls like ink, glitching and distorting as they surged toward us. Alice collapsed against the floor, her green eyes flickering to black as she struggled to breathe.

“You’re marked,” she gasped, her voice layered and metallic. “You can’t run.”

But I didn’t stop. I grabbed Alice by the arm and dragged her toward the stairs, the shadows twisting violently as they followed. They stopped at the edge of the boiler room, writhing against the walls like they couldn’t step into the open air. My cigarette hit the concrete floor, the ember sparking one last time before it burned out.

We staggered into the alley behind the bar, Alice barely able to stand as she leaned against the brick wall. Her eyes had returned to green, but they were distant, hollow. The whispers were quieter now, but the folder in my bag buzzed again—sharp, insistent.

And then it came—a voice low and guttural, threading through the back of my thoughts. “Burn the folder, detective. Burn it—or it burns everything.”
