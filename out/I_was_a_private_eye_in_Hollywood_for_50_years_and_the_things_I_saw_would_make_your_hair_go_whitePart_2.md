Hello. I don’t know if you remember me, but my name is Norman B Hayes and I was a private investigator in Hollywood for 50 sum years. Since I last wrote I’ve had a bought as eventful a day as an old fella like me can have. Went to a bingo night down at our local church, planted some some sunflowers down there too, took the grandkids to see that new F1 race car picture(it was solid, but when you know what I do, watching movies is kinda like eating a hot dog), and caught up on some Jeopardy with the misses. That new host though, he is no Trebek. Where’s his showmanship? Where’s his panache? And his voice? Oh, compared to Trebek, it’s like nails on a chalkboard!



Anyways, when I last left off I was telling you about my first case, the actress and her stalker, who had somehow weasled his way into being her newly wed husband. After barely escaping their home and hearing what I presumed to be the sound of one of them shooting the other, I drank myself into a guilt induced stupor, only to wake up to them on my TV starring in a re-run of the previous night's episode of a talk show. 



It was relieving to an extent, knowing that this case wouldn’t have to become a murder mystery, but also frightening in its own regards. I knew what I heard. You don’t fire off four gunshots in  a suburban home unless you're trying to dispatch one of the residents, but on the TV, she looked fresh. He looked fine, like he’d cleaned up for this appearance, but she looked almost brand new.



I decided to take the clues I did have and try to piece together a story with them, though the only real physical evidence I had was the broken shards of the perfume bottle I’d nabbed. I took the shattered pieces and set them on my kitchen table. It was nicer glass than I’d seen anywhere in the city, or the world for that matter. Beautiful etchings danced across its destroyed form, seemingly depicting some scene, but I couldn’t make out what it was. The only thing decipherable to me was a few series of letters. They were scattered among the pieces, but eventually I was able to find and put them all together. Took a minute, I was never one for puzzles, but once I did get it figured out, I was given a name. 



Dr.Louis Verwood.



I had never heard the name before but LA’s a big town and I was new, so that made sense. I decided to contact some of my constituents in the business, to see if this guy was a regular thorn in the side that I’d have to learn to live with. Sadly, it was a dead end. None of my buddies had been hired to find the guy, so none of them knew who he was. Apparently reclusivity is a running trait of men in my profession. The only way to find this guy now was to hope he had a number in the phone book or walked around with a giant sign proclaiming his name around his neck. The phone book seemed more probable, but I’d yet to call the phone company to have one sent to me, so I’d just have to find one to borrow.



I am not proud to say the first place I checked was a bar 5 blocks over, but I was thirsty and needed the exercise. 



“Hayes! Your usual?” Christ,  do I come in here enough to have a usual already. Maybe all those people back home who told me I'm a degenerate alcoholic were right.



“No thanks, I was just wondering if you had a phone book I could borrow?”



“Awfully strange thing to come to a bar for.”



“If you only knew.” We made some more small talk and I ended up a few drinks deep before he pointed me to the phone booth in the corner. Normally I despise themed bars, but occasionally the tacky design comes in handy. I assume it was there for theming purposes at least. Maybe the owners were just the odd type. In the booth was a dial up and phone book on a chain to go with it. I skimmed it until I found him, my infamous doctor. It was around the time that I had to dial the number that I began to regret the drinks, as they certainly prolonged my stay in the booth. I just couldn’t seem to get the number right, but on attempt 11, I finally did.



A drudging sound began to invade my ears. It was shocking that any noise was coming out of the phone at all, judging on how the booth didn’t seem to be connected to anything and was inside a tacky LA dive bar. It then dawned on me that I was likely being punked by that bartender. He did seem an awful smiley, the key sign of a no good liar. I dropped the phone and went to leave the booth, but when I tried to open the door, the thing wouldn’t budge. I tried to catch the attention of the other bar patrons, but it seemed like no one could hear me, like I wasn’t even there. Then in a flash, it was all gone. The dive bar was replaced with a blank void filled with white dots. Was I in space? It seemed a possibility when gravity suddenly abandoned me, leaving me floating in this little box. I stared in shock and awe at the beautiful eternity in front of me. It was more nothingness than one man, hell, than anyone could comprehend. It was at this point that gravity decided to make its return to me with a vengeance.The box began to move through the void at unspeakable speeds in incomprehensible directions, slamming me full force into its walls as it did. I won’t lie and say it was a pretty ride or that I didn’t get violently ill at multiple points during that seemingly endless dizziness, but eventually we landed in what must’ve been some kind of body of water judging by how we crashed into it, floated to the top, and bobbed up and down. This was my introduction to the world on the other side, the side that  only makes itself visible to looneys, mystics, and believers on our side. It made sense it’d begin to leak over into LA, as I'd come to find out it had more than an abundance of all three. 



I thought of taking a moment to rest in my telephone box spaceship, but the horrid scent of all my vomit made me change my tune. I popped open the door and looked at the empty black sea surrounding me and the white dots above. Reaching out, I batted at the water to test its depth, only to find that it seemed to turn solid at my touch, like oobleck. My grandson tells me the scientifically accurate term would be “non-newtonian fluid”, but nothing about this place was scientifical, so oobleck feels more right.



Very tentatively, I stepped out and began making my path across the sea ahead of me. I must’ve gone on for miles, climbing over waves and passing through trenches before I finally saw that doctor's office in the distance. It was almost like it had been ripped from our side, with the building being accompanied by a torn up piece of sidewalk and a streetlamp in front. The walk was easier once I finally had a destination, maybe 20 minutes and they flew. The feeling of the rock solid sidewalk beneath my feet is one I never thought that I’d miss. Walking up the steps to the front door, I noticed the sign that I assumed was unreadable from a distance, was also unreadable up close. The letters seemed to dance around like a mirage. I would question it, but it was so strange that I couldn’t even think up something to ask. Rather than spending another moment considering that, I knocked on the door.



“Be there in a moment.” called out a weak voice. I heard the tapping of what sounded like a cand grow closer and closer before a man who looked like he must’ve been alive for a hundred years opened the door. Now in my old age, I realize that judgement may have been a bit off. This man certainly wasn’t a hundred, probably closer to 90. “Hello there young man. Do you have an appointment?”



“No, I actually came to ask you some questions about a product you’ve been selling?” The old man thought for a moment, before waving me in with his decrepit hand,



“Alright, but you’ll have to be more specific. I sell far too many things to have them all memorized.” As I entered, I saw with my own eyes that he wasn’t lying. Hundreds of bottles lined hundreds of shelves with thousands of knick knacks and artifacts filling the floor. It all resembled the Piggly Wiggly’s from back home more than any doctors office I’d ever been to.



“I’m wondering about this perfume, smells real sweet, sweeter than anything natural should. The bottle was all fancy with these little sketches in it. You got something like that?” 



“I believe I know what you speak of, give me a moment to check inventory.” The old man began to hobble towards the shops check out.



“You gotta cash register?”



“I’m not giving hand outs if that's what you mean.”



“I meant no disrespect, just why would you need money in a place like this?”



“You’d be shocked. The rent on this place is atrocious! 90 whole dollars a month, can you believe that?”



“Nope.”



“Eh, it’s better than the alternative.”



“I bet.” I never did find out what the alternative price was, but I assume something like teeth or your soul. I’m sure you kids out there wouldn’t mind giving those up for a place like that. My grandson thinks that's too referential, but what does he know about working a crowd.



“Yes, here it is.”



“Here’s wha-” The old man proceeded to pull out a book that must have been the size of a mustang. Somehow though he was able to open it with ease, crushing his cash register under the weight of the cover. He then crawled atop the book and somehow managed to read from atop it.



“You said it smelt sweet?”



“Yeah.”



“Ah, then you are most certainly dealing with one of our love potions. Now the question remains, which one?” 



“Love potion? Like magic?”



“Not like magic, it is magic, plain and simple!” Even now knowing the depths of the occult and paranormal that would invade my life, I still am often pulled back to this first moment in that store in the sea of void and stars. What if I hadn’t been curious? What if I hadn’t delivered that champagne or decided I had to save this woman? The outcome would’ve likely been the same, regardless of my involvement. So, why would I let this sense of optimistic heroism control me in this moment and honestly throughout my life? If I’m being honest, I don’t have an answer besides that it just felt right. These small meaningless acts of good have given me some kind of meaning. Even if I couldn’t save her, I know that she saved me. I’m getting ahead of myself. Spoiling the story even. Sorry. I am truly sorry dear reader. Forgive me, if you can find it in your heart to do so.



“Okay, so how will we know what kind of love potion this guy’s been using?”



“Describe to me the effects that it had on the woman.” I told him about the hazy eyes and how the scent of the thing seemed to radiate out of her. “Standard side effects” he called those, said I needed something more specific.



“I heard gunshots from the house. I assumed that he’d killed her, but she was doing the press circuit that same night looking better than ever on some talk show.” The old man went silent.



“Maybe you weren’t wrong.”



“What?”



“Those gunshots you heard, I believe they did kill this woman. If I'm correct, it may not have even been the first time she died either. This man, her husband, describe him to me.” My head was spinning. How could she have come back to life? No. No, it had to just be some love potion trance. It just had to be. I’d always had nerves of steel, but for the first time I could feel myself become weak. I couldn’t even ball my first at that moment. I was so weakened by the dread taking hold of my heart.



“Uh-he’s skinnier than a pole, tall as one too. Greased up hair, patchy beard, and his eyes are blue like the sky in winter. The kind that could glow in the dark, give you the willies.” The old man was hardly paying attention, too preoccupied in scanning through his book. Suddenly though he stopped and practically flew off of his book in excitement.



“YES! I figured it out! The man you speak of was in my store, not but two months ago. He came for a very specific love potion. He came seeking a way to assist this woman in falling in love by killing and bringing her back, reborn as his revenant bride. That way she’d be his for all time.”



“So he killed her.”



“How else would he remove her memories of the stalker he was? This man wanted everything that he didn’t control out of this woman's mind. He wanted to be her world, her only waking thought, and if he failed at that, he wanted a method that would allow him to try again.”  
  


“Try again?” The old man seemed to be impatient with my confusion.



“It works like this. He goes to her home, kills her, and then feeds her the potion. She is then reborn, her old form becoming a short of egg for her to tear off.”



“She’s really gone then.”



“Yes, the version you encountered was just a copy. A cage trapping her soul to earth, her physical form becoming just a plaything for this man.” I clutched my hand to my mouth and attempted to stabilize myself.



“I’m sorry. Was this woman special to you?”



“Just a client, but she was good. No one deserves this. How could you do this? How could youe sell that knowing what it’d be used for!”



“I think it’s time for you to leave.”



“No, you’re gonna answer me!” The old man shifted back and forth uncomfortably.



“Did you see that blob movie a few years back?”



“What could that possibly have to do with this?”



“Her mind, it won’t be able to handle the repeated stress of dying and repressing all those memories over and over again. She won’t live forever. In fact, at the rate he’s going I doubt she makes it out of the week. Eventually, all that bad stuff is going to return to her brain and break down the regeneration process and what comes out after that…well, I just hope your world is able to kill it quickly. If they can’t, I suggest leaving the city as soon as possible.”



“I won’t. I can save her or whatever is left of her in that clone.” I was brave back then. So sure of myself.



“The only way out is gonna be through for you then?”



“Exactly.”



“I wish you luck in your efforts. Just remember, you’re not that deep underground. As long as you don’t panic you should be able to unbury yourself.”

“Wha-” The old man clapped his hands and I was transported back home, or rather into the patch of earth in front of my apartment building. Thrashing against the Earth, I was able to rip myself out fairly quickly. Looked like a zombie, must have scared the hell out of the neighbors. Crawling out of my freshly dug grave, I had a new job and I would be damned if I failed at it.



Alright, the misses is calling me for dinner. I’m spending so much time on the computer now, it’d put my grandson to shame! Another cliffhanger too. I’m becoming quite the writer. Maybe when I’m done here, I’ll finally start up on that flower encyclopedia I’ve been meaning to start up. Over and out.



From,



Norman B Hayes
