The last thing I wanted to hear when returning from work was my friend asking, “Hey Hamza, want to go on a hike?”

You got to be kidding me.

“Nope,” I replied, setting my stuff on a table.

“Come on, man. It’s a Friday, and you’re off for the next two days.”

“That is precisely why I want some shut-eye right now.”

My friend, Osama, and I rented an apartment together in Islamabad, as it was near our workplace.

“You can go with Jamshed. He said he had no plans for the weekend,” I said.

“He has trouble going up the office staircase. I doubt he would be eager for a hiking trip,” replied Osama.

“How about I make an offer? I will do the dishes and clean the flat for the next week. How does that sound?” Asked an enthusiastic Osama.

The offer was not bad.
“Fine, but we will only go halfway as it’ll get dark in a few hours.”

“Sure, I’ll go get packing.”

“By the way, we’re going to trail 11 on the Margalla hills?”

“Bingo!” replied Osama.

About 45 minutes later, we reached the entrance to trail 11. By this time, the sun had gotten lower, and its glow cast a red hue in the clouds. Several hikers were climbing down at this time.

“Let’s get going then. It’ll probably get dark in an hour or so,” I stated.
Osama nodded in agreement, and we started our ascent.

As we made our way up, I couldn’t help but notice that we were the only ones going up. Everyone else was descending from the hills. It made sense as it was not recommended to hike in the dark as visibility gets poor and you are more prone to injury. That excludes the fact that wildlife gets more active at night. There were a few reports of leopard sightings in the area, however, that was about it.

Forty minutes into the hike, we reached a clearing where a small stream flowed from the adjacent hills and crossed the path in front of us.

“We should head back now. The sun is getting low, and it’ll be dark in a few minutes,” I said.

“Just a little further,” pleaded Osama.

“Why? We have reached the halfway point.”

“I know, but just a little further.”

“Fine”, I sighed.

We climbed a little further, with Osama guiding the way. We slowly took out our flashlights as it had gotten dark.
“Osama, it’s too dark now. Let’s turn back,” I said.

“I see it!” exclaimed Osama as he darted towards a row of trees.

Once I caught up, Osama showed me the reason for the hike. In his hands, he held Jacaranda flowers, which he just plucked from the trees.

“So, there’s this girl in my office who just joined. I really found her cute and found out she loves the color purple. I remember seeing these flowers the last time I hiked here and thought this would be the perfect gift for her.”

“That is so you, my friend,” I said as I gave him a playful shove. “If Romeo is finished, can we please head back now?”

“Yup, I have got what I wanted”.

With that, we started descending the hills. Pretty quickly, I saw the stream which we had passed earlier. Suddenly, Osama caught my shoulder.

“What’s wrong, you need more flowers now?” I asked, looking back at Osama, however, his expression was serious.

He pointed towards the far end of the stream just as it flowed downstream. “Look”.

I followed his finger and was surprised to see a person standing at the edge of the stream there. Under the faint moonlight, it looked like a woman who was wearing an ‘abaya’, covered head to toe in a black gown. Her face was turned in the other direction, so I couldn’t see it.

“What’s she doing out here all alone at this time? She must’ve lost her way. Let’s go help her”, I said as I tried to move forward, but Osama’s grip tightened on my shoulder.

“I don’t know, man. It’s dark right now, and we are alone on these hills, which are usually deserted at this time. We shouldn’t interfere with her”, stated Osama as he gulped.

It sank in what Osama was implying.
“You think that’s not a human?”

“All I’m saying is we should just quickly leave.”

I looked back at the woman; she was now walking along the edge of the stream.

“Yeah, let’s not interfere.”

We quietly moved towards the stream. As we reached the edge, the woman started walking in the water, however, her steps didn’t create any ripples in the water. It was then I noticed that she wasn’t walking through the stream; she was levitating on top of the surface.

I quickly took out my phone and started taking pictures. No one was going to believe me if I didn’t have any evidence.
I looked at Osama, his gaze transfixed on the woman.

“Our steps will make noise if we step into the water,” I whispered to him.

“We will have to move quietly then,” he said.

I cautiously took a step in the water. The water was cool and only reached up to my ankles.

“Let’s move”, I said.

With each step we took, our eyes were fixed on the woman. Once we were halfway through, the woman sat down on the water. We both froze. Osama took out his phone to take a picture, however, he had his flash on. Once he clicked on the capture button, light flashed from his phone. Osama hurriedly covered the flash with his hand, but it was too late.

The woman instantly turned her head towards us. Her eyes were completely white and shone under the moonlight. I was horrified at what I saw. The woman slowly got up and took a step towards us.

“Leave”.

Her deep voice echoed in my ears.

I didn’t need to be told twice. I grabbed Osama’s arm, who was frozen in fear, and then sprinted. I don’t think I have run this fast in my life. I never looked back as I ran, and neither did Osama. The way down wasn’t too rocky and thus made our descent easier.

We reached the bottom of the trail quickly. None of us said a word to the other and darted towards the car. As soon as we were in, I locked the doors.

“What the hell was that?” shouted Osama.

“I have no idea, but I think that was definitely not a human”, I said, shivering at that thought.

Osama took out his phone.
“Let’s see the pictures we got. People will definitely believe us when they see these”.

He quickly opened his phone’s gallery and paused.

“What’s wrong?” I asked as I leaned in to look at his phone.

“There’s nothing there,” he said in a quiet voice.
I looked as he showed me the photo. He had captured the stream clearly, however, there was no woman in the picture. I took out my phone and went through the pictures I took. Sure enough, not a single picture I took captured the woman.
