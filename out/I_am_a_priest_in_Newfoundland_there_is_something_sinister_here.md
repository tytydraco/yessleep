It would be a lie to say I grew up wanting to be a priest. My father would take my sisters and me to church every Sunday, whether it was snowing or blisteringly hot, we always went. While my sisters were off finding their husbands, I was growing in the faith and spent more time praying than socializing. However, I was still hesitant when my father told me I should attend a seminary school after graduation. It was not exactly the most thrilling prospect as a seventeen-year-old kid, but after some thought that summer, I decided to give it a shot. It would be the best and worst decision of my life.



Once I was fully ordained, I was dispatched to a corner of the globe that had drifted away from the church. I ended up in a town on the Atlantic coast of Newfoundland called Blythe. It was a small, isolated fishing town whose main claim to fame was the rumored existence of a nearby Viking landing site. I knew it was my calling when I learned it had previously been host to a catholic church. However, after it burned down in the early 1800s with the priest inside, there was never any attempt to rebuild it.



On my first visit to Blythe, I found the remains of the old church buried deep in the woods outside of town. There was barely anything left besides the cellar and some large logs still blackened by flames. It would be easy to clear the rubble and build my new church atop where the old one once stood. Luckily I was given sufficient funds by the Vatican for this undertaking. 



The locals were leery of me initially since not many outsiders came through their neck of the woods. On this first visit, I tried my best to introduce myself to as many people as possible, but sadly, my trip ended before I could make any real progress. I did, however, pay a group of workers to begin constructing the new church before I left. 



On my second trip, the locals were more receptive to my presence. Several people approached me, asking about the church, faith, and me personally. Frankly, I wasn’t expecting this kind of reception after my last visit, but there was one encounter that stood out. 



I was visiting the construction site. The sun was getting low and the workers were packing up for the day. Most of the framing had been done and I took great pleasure walking through the hollow interior imagining what it would look like finished. That was when one of the workers approached me.

	

“Excuse me, Father?” He asked, taking off his hard hat.



“Yes?”



I would come to find out his name was Johnathan Heathstead. He stood there and scratched his head like he wasn’t sure what to say next.



“Do you…Do you believe in demons?” He asked.



“Yes, I sure do.”



“But do you *believe* in them?”



“I…I don’t know what you’re asking,” I said.



Johnathan paused for a long second before speaking.



“Never mind.”



At the time, I didn’t think too much about this interaction. Looking back I should have. 



On my third visit, I brought two suitcases and my cat Spots. I was finally moving to Blythe. The church was finished, at least as finished as a church in the backcountry could be. I was proud of it. I was so excited that I opened the doors to all visitors that first day. I was already greeting nearly two dozen people before I even had a chance to unpack. While that might not seem like many, every pew was filled in that small church.



There was one man, however, who wasn’t sitting. He was standing in the back watching me as I gave my little sermon and invited the crowd to attend that Sunday’s mass. After everyone filed out, he approached me.



It was Johnathan. I could hardly recognize him. He looked tired, with dark bags under his eyes and a long, disheveled beard. His clothes looked two sizes too big and it took me a moment to recognize they were the same clothes he was wearing the day I had met him. 



“Father,” He croaked, his voice harsh and dry, “Do you have a moment?”



I paused, unsure how to react.



“I need help,” he said with tears welling in his eyes.



While I was ready to listen to him talk about losing a loved one or going through a nasty divorce, I wasn’t ready for what he ended up saying. I ushered him to the first row of pews and we sat for a few minutes before he started talking.



“Father…Do you believe in the Devil?” He asked.



“Yes of course.”



“Do you believe he walks among us?”



“Sadly I do. He exists in the hearts of men everywhere.”



Johnathan paused, more tears spilling down his cheeks. I became acutely aware of the smell of fresh lumber at that moment. Strange what you notice in the silence between words.



“I believe the Devil has his grip on me,” he whispered.



“What makes you think that, my child?”



Johnathan took a long, steadying breath before he spoke again.



“I don’t know why, but I’ve started to…do things.”



“What things?” I pressed.



“I…I black out sometimes. Sometimes only for a few minutes, but other times for whole days. When I wake up…When I wake I…Sometimes I come to and I’m waist-deep in the ocean on the brink of the abyss. Others…others I am bare-chested and covered in b-blood. Normally I am outside, on a rock, or up a tree. But, sometimes I am in the basement of my house scribbling like a madman with chalk and blood.”	



“Whose blood is it?”	



“I-I-I don’t know. Sometimes I swear it is fish blood, others I am not too sure. Our dog went missing a few weeks ago…I don’t know.”



Johnathan broke down. Sobbing into his hands. I noticed they were slightly stained red. 



“Father, I need help. Please!”



Now, the Church has had controversy with mental illnesses being conflated with possession, so to say I wasn’t exactly reaching for my cross and Bible over what this man was telling me would be an understatement. 



“Let me consult with my superiors,” I said, patting him on the back, “they will surely know what the best course of action is.”



“Father, I need help now!”



“Yes I know, but I am limited in what I can do right now.”



Johnathan’s face immediately sobered up and a flash of rage shined in his eyes. Tears still rolled down his cheeks as he stood up and stormed out of the church. 



“Go in peace!” I called out after him, “God protects all of his children and gives us strength!”



Johnathan paused halfway through the door and turned back to me.



“Then I am no child of God,” He said before slamming the door shut.



I sat in the empty church for a while, considering what had just happened. My welcome to the town had gone smoothly so far but I was afraid, after how that confession went, that I might not be up to the task. Spots jumped up on my lap and started purring. It put me at ease and the rest of the evening went smoothly.



I had no way of knowing that that night, Johnathan would enter his basement and never emerge again. 



It was a closed-casket funeral. A small, intimate affair even though I am sure half the town showed up. It was there that I met Marie, Johnathan’s widow. A few days after the funeral, I decided to stop by the new widow’s home. I didn’t feel it was appropriate to crowd around her at the funeral or to simply ignore her. My motivation wasn’t entirely altruistic, a selfish part of me wished to wash my hands of the guilt that had weighed on me since I got the news. 



When Marie answered the door, it was obvious she’d been crying. Her eyes were red and puffy and her nose was almost rubbed raw.



“Good evening Father, what can I do for you?” She asked.



“I just wanted to stop by and offer my condolences,” I said.



She opened her mouth and closed it several times.



“Would you like to come in?” She said, biting back tears, “I would appreciate some guidance.”



Marie led me inside to a small, two-person dining table in the kitchen. 



“Coffee?” She asked.



“That would be great.”



Her hands were shaking as she grabbed two mugs from the cupboard. 



“Father,” she started, “do you believe in demons?”



Now, I like to believe I am a rational man, but I would be lying if I said that question didn’t immediately make me feel sick to my stomach.



“Yes, of course.”



“Can they make a sane man do what Johnny did?” She asked, placing the mug of old coffee in front of me before sinking into the opposite chair.



“What did Johnathan do?”



“I-I don’t know. He told me he was having nightmares but I didn’t think they were all that serious. I mean who would? What was I supposed to do?”



“My child,” I placed my hand on her wrist, “what did Johnathan do?”



Marie wiped at her nose and looked at the basement door.



“He came home late and he was sweating like crazy. I got him water and he seemed to settle down. We went to bed and…and…” she broke down but quickly composed herself, “I found him down there that morning. The sheriff took his body and some photos but it was clear it was self-inflicted. The door was locked from the inside. He told me I get to be the one to clean it up but I haven’t opened that door since that morning.”	



“I’m sorry.”



“Why, Father, why did this happen?”



“I don’t know.”



“What should I do?”



“I…I don’t know,” I sheepishly said.



Marie stood up and walked over to the window.



“You haven’t touched the basement?” I asked.



“No. No, not yet.”



“Let me help, it’s the least I can do.”



Marie led me to the basement door. She didn’t open it, only nodding towards the doorknob before shuffling back to the dining table. 



The door whined as it swung open revealing nothing but a curtain of darkness just past the threshold. A distinct metal tinge hung in the air and stuck on my tongue. I rolled up my sleeves and whispered a quick prayer. Each step creaked as I descended into the darkness. I didn’t know what to expect but it wasn’t what was down there. 



I pulled on the light cord. It was an unfinished basement with low beam ceilings and concrete floors, a desk was pushed to the side with a rug rolled up and stored on top. It made a clearing in the middle of the basement. 



It was red—red everywhere—streaks and drops, smears across the floors and on the walls. A tinge of rusting iron hung in the air. Among the streaks, there were broken fingernails and scraps of skin. It made me feel weak.



At first, there was no pattern to the madness. Just intersecting lines and circles, hard angles, and jagged scribbling. My head was spinning and I stumbled back to the stairs. I sat for a while, staring at the self-inflicted carnage when it finally started to form.



It was a single, massive rune, or at least something like a rune. It was surprisingly intricate, with large smears making up the border with smaller drops and streaks for finer details. I took several pictures of the rune from every possible angle. I didn’t know what I would do but I still felt I should document it. It took a few hours to clean up the blood. Even after cleaning, the floor was still stained red. 



“God be with you,” I said standing on the house's front step, “it always gets better with time.”



Marie didn’t say anything as she slowly closed the door. 



Several months passed and I had settled into a routine. The buzz around the new church had died down and there was regular attendance during mass. While it wasn’t the most exciting place to be, Blythe and the surrounding countryside had started to grow on me. With the coming of fall and the changing of leaves, I found myself outside more and more. 



The forests behind the church could have well been endless. The locals had carved hiking paths through the trees and several fallen logs made excellent benches. I hadn’t seen or heard anything about Marie since I visited her house that night. Rumor was that she had secluded herself and was living as a hermit, barely leaving her house. Who could blame her?



Since that night, I haven’t looked at the photos I took. There was no need to; they were seared into my memory. I thought about that night regularly on my walks through the woods. There was one tree that was my turning point for my walks. Rumor has it that it was a lone survivor of the region's old-growth forest. I say this as a man of God; I understand why ancient peoples believed these great things to be gods themselves.



It was after one of these hikes that I found a note folded up and slid under the door. It was written in handwriting so heavy it pierced the page a few times. It simply read: 



*Help.*



While it was a bit of a stretch, I presumed the note was from Marie. After all, who else would it have been from? She just needed help after Johnathan passed away. Oh how wrong I was. It was getting late but I made the trek out to her house that night. The house sat on the outskirts of town overlooking the ocean. 



Once I reached the front door, the sun had already set and the insects had started singing their tunes. I was about to knock when I realized the door was already open.



“Mrs. Heathstead?” I called out.



Nothing but the darkness of the house answered. The door let out a low creak as I pushed it open.



“Mrs. Heathstead? Are you here?”	No response.	



I stepped inside, the floorboards moaning under my feet. 



“Mrs Heathstead are you there?” 



I was about to turn back when I heard a faint sobbing coming from the basement. The basement door was slightly ajar, inky darkness on the other side. I took a step closer. The sobbing suddenly stopped. 



I heard whispering coming from the basement.



“What did you say? Mrs. Heathstead?”



The voice that responded was raspy and almost indiscernibly quiet.



“There’s a man at the top of the stairs.”



I took a step closer, my heart pumping in my ears as the voice spoke again.



“And another in the basement.”



Screaming echoed from the basement. The inky darkness was dispelled as orange flames burst from the basement. I fell back, barely avoiding a burst of flames that licked at the place I was just standing. Scrambling to my feet, I barely got out of the doorway before the door slammed shut. By what force I don’t know.



It was only for the briefest of moments, but for a second I thought something was staring at me from the window. As I blinked the windows exploded in flames sending shards of glass flying in every direction.



The Heathstead house burned down in less than 5 minutes. It took nearly double that for the first men carrying hoses to respond. I stared at the flames, my clothes and hair singed.  The flames swirled and licked the night sky.



The Sheriff seemed just as confused and disturbed as I was when I gave my statement. Whether this was because he believed me or didn’t, I don’t know. I was still an outsider after all. A couple died so soon after I arrived. Even the most trusting man would be suspicious.



It was eventually ruled as self-inflicted. It is easier to believe that a grief-stricken widow would choose to end her pain than for it to be the work of the devil.



I don’t know what I saw in that window. If I saw anything in that window. I like to believe I am a reasonable man as much as I am a holy one. But after that night, I find myself struggling for answers.



All I know is the devil is real, and I fear he is here in Newfoundland.
