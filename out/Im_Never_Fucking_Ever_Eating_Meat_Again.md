Every Sunday evening, I like to make a big soup to meal prep for the week. I’m somewhat of a gym bro, so protein is pretty important to me. With that in mind, I do bone broth, ground turkey, mushrooms, corn, and beans. I season the broth with salt, pepper, and paprika. It’s 70 grams of protein per serving, and I eat this meal 3 times a day. I know that might seem pretty boring, but I’m a simple guy. I don’t get tired of my routine.



Anyway, last Sunday, something fucking crazy happened while I was making my soup. I don’t think I’ll be eating it again anytime soon.



I had the broth simmering in a pot on one burner while I cooked the ground turkey in a pan on the other. I always wait to season my meat until it’s almost done, so when the last bits of pink were starting to fade, I walked to the pantry to grab a couple of packets of taco seasoning. But while I was pushing away boxes of cereal and granola bars, I heard something that made me freeze in place.



“Agh!” A groan of pain, sharp and quick. Like someone had accidentally cut themselves with a knife. As soon as the sound came it was gone. 



As someone who lives alone in a one-bedroom apartment, I’m not used to hearing the sounds of *other* people’s pain in my house. “Hello?” I yelled out. “Is anyone there?” 



I stepped out of the pantry and looked around, then did a quick trip around the living room, my bedroom, and the bathroom. Of course, I was all alone. 



I decided the sound must have come from a neighbor watching TV, or maybe even just the sizzling of meat juice on the pan. Otherwise, maybe I was just hearing things.



So I grabbed the taco seasoning and continued work on my soup. I was in the midst of mixing the seasoning with the ground turkey when I heard something else.



“Please, stop! Help me!”



I gasped and dropped the spatula on the floor as I stepped backwards. This time the sound was much louder, more profound, more obvious. It was clearly coming from directly in front of me—from the pan.



I looked around the room and yelled out again, loud enough that I’m sure my neighbors all heard me. “Are you okay?! Do you need help?!”



“Stop cooking me!” The voice responded. “Please, stop! Don’t eat me!”



I stepped forward and looked down at the meat. Physically, there was nothing to suggest that it could have been talking to me. No face forming from the pan, no ghostly entity forming from the steam.

I closed my eyes and pinched myself. Surely I was dreaming, or, at the very least, having some sort of mental breakdown. Was I hallucinating? Was I schizophrenic? It runs in my family, but I didn’t want to believe it was catching up to me at the ripe age of 25.



When nothing happened for a minute or so, I decided I was going to dump the meat. It’s not that I really believed it was sentient, I just knew I wouldn’t feel comfortable eating it after the strange hallucination. I decided I’d go to bed and schedule a doctor’s appointment in the morning. It was all some mental issue. Some medicine would fix me right up and I’d never hallucinate like this again. Problem solved. No biggie.



I turned the stove off and was about to dump the meat when it spoke again.



“Leave me here.”



“What?” I asked. Even if it was a hallucination, I had to see it through at this point.



“Thanks for letting me go, but please… just leave me here. I’ll take care of myself.”



“Oh… okay,” I said.



I ran to my room and closed and locked the door. I’d schedule the appointment in the morning and try to forget any of this ever happened.



Somehow I managed to fall asleep that night. When I woke up in the morning, I hurried to the kitchen. I was hoping to find some kind of proof that I’d imagined the whole situation. What I actually found was much worse.



The pan was empty, and the meat was nowhere to be found. On the floor there were light brown footprints, bleeding the color of my taco seasoning. I followed the prints to the front door, which was hanging ajar, the door knob covered with that same colored liquid.



I still don’t understand what happened that night, but, whatever it was, it’s not normal. I just hope it’s not dangerous.



Whatever the case, I let it out. Whatever happens next is on me.
