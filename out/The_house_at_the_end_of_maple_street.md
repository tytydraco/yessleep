I grew up in a typical American town where everyone knew each other, and every house had its story. But there was one house that everyone avoided – an old, dilapidated mansion at the end of Maple Street. Stories about it had been circulating for years, but no one ever checked if they were true. Until we did.

I was 18, and along with my three friends – Matt, Jason, and Erica – we decided to break that rule. One night, we chose to go inside. The building was in terrible condition: windows boarded up, the roof partially collapsed, and the front door slightly ajar, as if inviting us in.

Inside, the air was thick with dust and rotting wood. The walls were covered in mold, and the floor creaked with every step. On the old fireplace stood a few photos – all showing the same family: a mother, a father, and two boys. Their faces were scratched out, as if someone had deliberately scraped them away with their fingernails.

As we wandered through the house, we came across a children's room. It looked as if someone still lived there – toys scattered across the floor, a blanket carelessly thrown over the bed. But there was no one inside. Suddenly, we heard a faint whisper. We looked around, but we were alone.

Terrified, we decided to go down to the basement. That was a mistake. As soon as we opened the door, an icy draft hit us. The basement walls were covered in hundreds of names – some crossed out, others freshly written. In the corner stood an old, decayed chair, and on it lay a child's doll. Jason picked it up, and at that moment, we heard a loud bang – the basement door had slammed shut behind us.

Our flashlights started flickering. Erica began to scream, and Matt tried to break down the door. Then we heard footsteps. Heavy, slow, as if someone was descending the stairs. But no one was there. Jason let out a strangled cry. We turned to him – on his shoulder was a pale, bony handprint.

The door finally gave way, and we ran outside. When we turned back, we saw something that still haunts my dreams. In the upper window stood a boy. His face was blurred, just like in the photos.

The next day, the house was gone. We drove there, but there was nothing – just an empty lot overgrown with weeds. We checked old maps – the house had burned down in 1974.

A few days later, Jason started acting strangely. He was silent, often lost in thought. He said he had nightmares where someone whispered his name. One night, Erica called me, sobbing hysterically. Jason had disappeared. The police never found him.

Matt and I started having strange dreams. We saw that house, its interior – but in our dreams, it looked different. It was well-maintained, as if someone still lived there. In the corner of the living room sat the boy, his blurred face staring straight at us. We couldn’t wake up, and when we finally did, we felt pain, as if someone had touched us with icy fingers.

One night, I woke up to a noise coming from the hallway. My heart pounded as I heard a faint whisper: "Jason was here too." I jumped out of bed, but there was no one there. On the floor, I saw something that made my blood run cold – barefoot child’s footprints leading toward my bed.

The next day, I left town and never returned. But to this day, when I fall asleep, I sometimes hear whispers. And when I look in the mirror, I see something that shouldn’t be there – the shadow of a boy with a blurred face.
