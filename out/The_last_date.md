It was our first date, and I wanted it to be memorable. So, I decided to take her to the tarot show that had been advertised on the radio all week. It was supposed to be a fun and spooky experience, but little did we know that we were in for a terrifying ride.

As we entered the dimly lit tent, the smell of incense filled the air, and I could see the excitement in her eyes. The fortune teller, dressed in a long black robe, welcomed us, and we took our seats at a small table. She began shuffling the tarot cards and asked us to pick three each.

My girlfriend went first, and the fortune teller studied the cards intently before declaring that she had chosen the Death card. My girlfriend laughed nervously, thinking it was all a show. But, as I picked my cards, the atmosphere changed.

The fortune teller's face grew serious as she looked at the cards in front of her. "The cards are telling me that you both are in grave danger," she said. I rolled my eyes, thinking she was just trying to scare us. But then, the ground beneath us began to shake.

"What the hell is going on?" my girlfriend shouted, gripping my arm tightly. The fortune teller's eyes widened as she began to speak in a language I couldn't understand. Suddenly, a group of people appeared out of nowhere, dressed in long robes and holding candles.

"We have been waiting for you," one of them said, and before we knew it, they had surrounded us. I tried to stand up, but they pushed me back down, and the fortune teller began to chant. The room grew colder as the candles flickered, and I could feel a sense of dread growing inside me.

My girlfriend began to cry, and I tried to comfort her, but I was just as scared. Then, as the chanting grew louder, I saw something move in the shadows. It was a figure, dressed in black, with glowing red eyes.

The figure stepped forward, and the fortune teller bowed before him. "Master, we have brought you the sacrifices you requested," she said, and my blood ran cold. Sacrifices? What the hell was going on?

The figure approached us, and I could see the wicked smile on his face. "You two will make excellent offerings," he said, and I knew then that we were doomed.

We tried to fight, but the robed figures were too strong. They bound us, and before we knew it, we were being dragged outside. The moon was full and bright, and I could see the twisted faces of our captors in its light.

They took us to a clearing in the woods, where a circle of stones had been set up. The figure in black began to chant, and the others joined in. My girlfriend and I were forced into the center of the circle, and I could feel the heat of the fire they had lit.

As the chanting grew louder, I knew that this was the end. The figure in black raised his hands, and I closed my eyes, waiting for the inevitable. And then, everything went black.

I woke up in a hospital bed, my body battered and broken. The doctors told me that my girlfriend was dead, and that I was lucky to be alive. But I didn't feel lucky. I felt like a prisoner, trapped in a nightmare that I could never escape. 

The memory of that night haunted me for the rest of my life, and I could never forget the terror I had felt as I watched my girlfriend being taken from me. It was a date that I would never forget, but for all the wrong reasons.
