I am going to begin with an apology. This is a long story. There are a lot of people involved and a lot has happened. I am determined to give everything its due.

What follows is, as far as I am looking at it, an origin story. It is the story of how I came to be a part of The Séance Club. It is the story of a long weekend at Windhaven Manor, and how we found ourselves caught in a struggle between the living and the dead. 

\----

It began the moment we entered the narrow alley. Yellow light from the bar reflected off the cobblestones made slick by the winter drizzle. A neon sign flashed above the door: *The Exchange*. I hesitated. Two half-steps and I almost lost contact with the peloton of my new colleagues on their way to Friday night drinks at the local. Beth nudged my elbow and smiled and said, “Here it is.”

A strange humming rose up in my body. It was something I had only felt once before. Every atom in my body vibrating in sync, creating a resonance that pulsed through my veins and buzzed in my ears. I swallowed hard and hoped it was something misremembered, a negative association made worse by time. Of the event that singularly ruined my childhood. I pushed it down.

The buzzing intensified the moment I stepped into the bar. I gritted my teeth and told myself there was some other cause. Perhaps the wall of air warmed by radiators and the body heat of Friday night drinkers after a long week of work. Or the sickly smell of alcohol. Or the incessant staccato of chatter and laughter. But that was a lie, and I knew it.

I tried to ignore it. To focus instead on Freddie, the tall Scot who, for the grand total of a month, had been my boss. He talked with a laconic drawl that was instantly engaging. In the bar, cradling three-quarters of a pint, he held court. The ring of colleagues all laughed as if on cue, and I forced a smile even though I missed the punchline. 

I pulled at the collar of my shirt. Sickness rose in my stomach. I had forgotten that part. Beth touched the back of her hand to my shoulder and a thin voice penetrated the bubble. 

“Do you want another?”

A mouthful of beer remained in my glass, but I didn’t want it. I nodded and broke eye contact and left the circle. I needed a breather. I had hidden in the school toilets that first time. Now, I fell back on old habits. This time my parents wouldn’t come and take me home. This time I was on my own. 

I grabbed at the rail above the narrow stone steps leading to the lower floor. The cold and inert steel was like a limb gone numb refusing to join my body in its flurry of activity. My head swam. Why are the toilets always down in the cellar? 

If upstairs was claustrophobic, the cellar was an oppressive cocoon. The vibration buzzed with such intensity it almost drowned out the heavy bass of the music from upstairs. I slipped on the bottom step and threw out my arms. The rough stone walls tore at my skin, but I barely felt it. 

At the end of the dimly lit passageway stood two wooden doors. The sign reading ‘*Gents’* offered itself as my saviour. If I could make it there and sit, perhaps it would pass. I didn’t make it. I buckled at the knees and collapsed to the floor a mere three paces from the stairs. 

I scrambled into a seated position and propped against the wall. A severe pain radiated from the base of my skull. I leaned forwards and tried to raise myself from the ground. A man wearing a pair of rough leather shoes came from the other end of the corridor and stopped before me. 

“Are you here to help?”

I didn’t understand the question. I was the one on the ground. I could have sworn my mouth filled with water and I turned to spit, but nothing came.

Using the wall for support I stood. The small man stared up at me open mouthed. He wore a filthy button-up shirt that could have come from a thrift store and smelled of fish. He irradiated a warmth and seemed to buzz with the same electricity pumping through my own body. I thought of that boy, all those years ago. He had buzzed too. That was how I explained it to my mother. 

He lifted his eyebrows expectantly.

“I can’t help you,” I said.

“Then why have you come?”

“What are you talking about?”

A hand touched the inside of my elbow followed by a voice in my ear.

“Sam, are you alright?”

It was Beth. I pushed off the wall and stood under my own steam. I nodded.

“Who are you talking to?”

I searched her face for any sign that she was joking. I found only a genuine concern. I looked at the man in the tattered shoes and filthy shirt and then back to Beth. Her eyes flicked to the corridor behind and then back to me. She couldn’t see him. The other kids and the school maintenance man couldn’t see the boy stuck under the table either. 

I shook my head. “No one. I’m talking to myself.”

The man reached out a hand and touched me. A blunt shock of electricity smacked my arm and I pulled away. 

“I need help,” he said.

I turned my back to him. 

“Are you alright?” Beth asked.

I shook my head. “I’m feeling a bit off. Better head home.”

I pushed past her and stumbled up the stairs. A pair of voices entreated me to wait; Beth and the man who only I could see. I tripped on the top step and sprawled onto the floor. A group of guys with loosened ties and elbows on the bar laughed. I picked myself up and made a bee line for the door, keeping my head down and making eye contact with no one. Back then in the schoolyard, I had insisted the boy was there. That it was everyone else who was crazy. Today I would not be so stubborn. 

On the train home I played the event back over in my head. By now Beth had returned to my colleagues standing in a circle drinking beer and told them. Would they laugh? Would they raise eyebrows? Would they say to each other that they had known from the first there was something wrong with me? Coming to the city was a bad idea. Mother had been right. I had hoped for so long that she was wrong.

That night I did not sleep. I was caught between a home I had left and to which I did not want to return, and a future life that may already be slipping from my fingers. It was the loneliest night of my life. 

\-----

My mother often spoke of fate and God’s plan. For her nothing ever happened without a reason. If she were with me the night after the incident in the cellar of The Exchange, she would have said that it was God telling me I made a mistake leaving home and coming to the city. That I was never meant to live a normal life. Not someone like me. And I might have agreed with her. 

I did not expect what happened next. There was no mention of it at work on Monday. The topic of conversation was football. I remained on the sidelines.

And then came the invitation. Beth asked me to join her friends on a trip to the seaside over the long weekend. On instinct I turned her down. She pressed.

“I know what it’s like to come to a place where you don’t know anyone,” she said. “It’s a couple of friends from high school. We call ourselves The Séance Club. Once a month we go somewhere with a history of supernatural activity-“

“Haunted houses,” Freddie interjected from over the partition. “They go to haunted houses. It’s a load of nonsense.”

Beth continued, undeterred. “We’re going to a place in Windhaven next week, you should come along.”

Everything happens for a reason. Beth wasn’t shunning me as I feared, but throwing me a life preserver. I told her I would go. A split second decision I had no idea how to rescind. With every passing second I found justification. I came to the city to make friends, to live a life, a life my mother tried to deny me. I couldn’t spend it hiding. I couldn’t run away. I had run away from mother and home already. Where else was there to go? 

Deep down I knew the reason I said yes. There was a question that hung over my head every waking moment since that day in the schoolyard. Am I really different from everyone else?

Beth promised to pick me up outside my flat. I twisted the handle of my bag as I waited. The night had brought the cold and I let my lower jaw rattle. A white Camry slowed and then stopped and I bent at the waist to search for Beth’s unfailingly friendly face through the window. The tint on the windows meant I saw my own reflection. I hesitated and then thrust out my hand and opened the door. She smiled under the glow cast by the light above her head. 

Parker lived a five minute drive away and was ready at the front door when we pulled up. He piled his bags into the back – a small travel bag and three bigger, heavier bags. Beth warned me about this. Parker, she said, was a bit of a tech geek. He had temperature monitors and sound recorders and video cameras to record the séance. Together with Juliet they ran a small online channel and uploaded the videos of each event.

I moved into the back seat and let Parker sit up front with Beth. They chatted away like the old friends they were and I let them. My knees were pushed high in the cramped back seat. I felt like an extra and unnecessary limb.

As the city and its endless warren of bitumen and brick gave way to the motorway cutting through fields, the open spaces brought calm and reminded me of home. It had been a good idea to come, and even with a séance scheduled at midnight, it still might be the best night’s sleep for weeks. 

“Awful quiet back there,” Parker said, half turning but not taking his eyes off the road ahead. 

I froze in my seat, unable to find a suitable response. Brushing aside an initial instinct to apologise, I tried to find a joke to insert into the silence and my brain blanked.

Beth’s laugh broke the impasse. “He’s joking.”

Parker turned fully now. “Sam, is it?”

I nodded.

“Sorry we’re being antisocial. I haven’t seen Beth since the last one of these. She has no time for her friends anymore.”

Beth scoffed. Parker tapped her thigh with the back of his hand.

He continued, “You work with Beth?”

“I started about a month ago.”

“Are you from the city?”

“No. I’m from the west coast. A farming village. You won’t have heard of it.”

“You like the city?”

“I’m still getting used to it.”

“I wouldn’t be anywhere else. I need stimulation. You know what I mean?”

I nodded and then realised Parker couldn’t see me. The silence hung for a few seconds and Parker continued.

“Have you ever done anything like this before?”

“No.”

My stomach fluttered and I told myself it was only my growing hunger.

“Did Beth tell you about the place?” Parker said.

“Only a little.”

“The place we’re going to is a guest house, set up all alone on a hill and overlooking the ocean. Old English manor style. Textbook haunted house, it’s a damn cliché. Was in private hands until a few years ago. The reviews of the people who have stayed there since talk of a ghostly presence.”

He turned to me now, a big smile on his face.

“Don’t freak him out before we even start,” Beth said.

“He should be prepared.”

“Don’t worry,” Beth said, making eye contact in the rear vision mirror, “the most that will happen tonight is a creaking floorboard and some radio interference on Parker’s gadgets.”

“Tosh,” Parker said. “Beth here is what we in the trade call a sceptic.”

“The trade? You talk about it as if it is a legitimate pursuit.”

“Have you not seen my equipment? It’s all very expensive and high tech. How dare you call me anything but legitimate. Did she tell you about Juliet?”

“Yes.” Beth had mentioned Juliet. The third member of the so-called Séance Club. She hadn’t given any details, only that it was Juliet who had formed the club and it was she who led the séance itself. 

“She’s harmless,” Beth said.

“She can be a bit much for first timers,” Parker said. “She’s so excited about it all she drove up early. After you first meet I’ll pull you aside and get a report on your first impression. And make sure you compliment her Ouija board. She’s proud of it.” 

Parker chuckled. 

I had never even seen a Ouija board, except in the movies. I brought the image to mind, letters lined up alphabetically and a ‘yes’ in one corner and a ‘no’ in the other.

Beth checked the GPS propped on the dashboard. “Almost there.”

We left the main road and wound up the hill on a narrow gravel track. Beth squinted. The night was dark. She checked the GPS and looked out ahead.

“There should be a turn here somewhere.”

“There,” Parker said, pointing.

Two marble pillars and a giant steel gate marked the entrance. A fence of crumbling stone separated the grounds from the rolling countryside. The fence looked old, almost ancient. On the pillar to the right was a sign. Beth slowed and read the black lettering aloud. Windhaven Manor. 

The long driveway was lined with trees, skeletal and black in the winter darkness. The headlights struggled to reach beyond the front row of trees, hinting at a deeper and darker forest beyond. My mind formed impressions of decrepit structures hiding out there among the woods. 

At the end of the driveway stood the house, illuminated on one side by a spotlight set in the front yard that shone back onto the house. It created an unusual effect, as if there should be a second light on the other side for symmetry. But as it was, one side of the house was bathed in light and the other side was obscured in murky shadow.

The house was a typical English Manor style structure, a double storey rectangle of white stone. Tall ground floor windows set on a regular grid. Those on the second floor smaller, but placed directly above their ground floor companions. Four chimneys poked up above the parapet in each corner. It was a picture of opulence and symmetry, save for the half-light and half-dark effect of the spotlight.

A stone fountain marked the end of the driveway and we drove into a large courtyard of crushed gravel. Beth slowed the car to a crawl and the gravel popped under the tyres. A red Mercedes was parked against a low-height stone fence on the far side, not out of place in the grand courtyard of the mansion. Juliet’s car, I guessed. Beth pulled in beside it and parked.

Parker jumped out and pulled the seat forward so I could exit. I stood tall and stretched my legs. I breathed in the cold night air and a rush of adrenaline coursed through my body. I took a step back and stumbled and threw out my hand to balance myself on the side of the car.

“Are you alright?” Parker said.

“Yes,” I lied. I took a couple of quick and deep breaths. The now familiar vibration buzzed again in my ears. I willed it to stop. It didn’t listen. 

Beth stopped unloading the car and put a hand on my arm. “Are you sure you’re ok?”

“Yes. I think I got a little car sick at the end there with all the winding roads.” I puffed out my chest and exhaled slowly and tried to convince myself of the lie.

“Walk it off Sam, we’ve got work to do.” Parker slapped me on the back and started lugging his bags to the house.

Parker climbed the steps topped with dark slate and pushed open the wooden door. The spotlight rising up from the gravel made the white stone walls almost glow. Up on the second storey the lights were on. The silhouette of a figure appeared in the window closest the car and lingered. Overcome with a sudden sense of grief, which had no origin I could trace, I let out an involuntary whimper. I bent over and put my hands on my knees.

Beth put her hand on my back. “Do you need to be sick?”

“I don’t know.”

“Here, take a walk with me.”

She wrapped her fingers around my forearm and led me to the side of the house. Tables and chairs of painted metal stood on a large grassed area. A giant oak tree stood alone surrounded by flower beds. The breeze carried the smell of the ocean. I took a deep breath. 

“I don’t know what came over me,” I said.

“You’ll be fine.”

A storm brewed in the distance. Lightning lit up the sky and for a moment the vista of green field in the foreground and dark blue ocean in the background flashed before us. Thunder rumbled, low and deep. The wind picked up and smelled of rain. 

“Maybe the talk of ghosts got to me a bit,” I said shakily.

“There’s nothing to it. You’ll see. It’s just a bit of fun.”

“There’s no such thing as ghosts, right?”

“Right.”

Lightning streaked horizontally in the clouds above. I could make out the edge of the land before it fell away to the ocean below. A girl stood out there in the distance by the edge. She stood far off, but somehow I saw her as if she were right beside me. She wore red and her black hair fell in ropes as if it were wet. She looked up at the house, at us standing there. Then darkness came again. I was about to ask Beth if she had seen the girl and then another flash of lightning lit up the sky and the girl was gone. 

A clap of thunder, closer now. 

The first drops of rain fell.

“Let’s get the bags inside,” I said.

Inside it was cold and I left my coat on. The narrow foyer led to a double-height space in the centre of the house, with a wide staircase at the back. A chandelier hung from the ceiling and portraits in gold frames hung on the walls. All the rooms, upstairs and down, were arranged around the perimeter. 

A door swung open in the back corner and Parker leaned out.

“Where have you two been? Go upstairs and find a room. Any room without a bag already in it is up for grabs. We have the place to ourselves.”

I followed Beth up the stairs. At the first landing level one flight turned left and the other right. She went left at the landing and it occurred to me that it was the right side of the house illuminated by the spotlight, and so I went right. At the top level we each turned back and found bedrooms in the front corners of the house. Beth opened the door and flicked on the light and entered.

I stood by the door I had chosen. The white paint was old and cracked. I wrapped my fingers around the handle and a wave of electricity rushed through my body. I pulled back my hand. The silhouette I saw from the courtyard was from the window in this room. The strip at the base of the door was dark. There was no light on inside the room now.

I crossed to the adjacent corner and knocked on the door. Beth stood over the bed, her hands buried in an unzipped bag.

“Can we swap rooms?” I said.

“Is it not to your liking Mr. Ash?” she said, putting on the air of a frustrated concierge. 

“No,” I stammered, my addled brain searching for a way to keep the joke going, but I found none. And so my response hung in the air. I wiped back my fringe and looked away. 

“Oh, no problem,” she said and zipped up the bag.

I took a step back and gave her space. She slipped by and I mumbled an apology. She smiled. She opened the door and turned on the light. I entered my room and closed the door behind me. 

The bed looked like an antique, its ancient metal frame roughened with age. An oversized chair made of thick, dark wood was pushed into one corner. An elongated oval-shaped mirror hung on the wall beside the chair, tall enough to reflect my entire body. I turned away from my own gaze and punched the bed and wondered if Beth heard. I dumped my bag beside the bed and went downstairs.

The door Parker had appeared from led to the kitchen at the back of the house. A stack of pizza boxes sat on the table. Parker opened the lid of the top box and took a slice. The smell was enough to make my stomach turn.

“We’re lucky we beat the storm. Want a slice?”

“Not right now,” I said and patted my stomach. “Still not feeling the best.”

“When you want some they’ll be here. Don’t take the pizza out this room. Juliet doesn’t want the smell contaminating the rest of the house. She’s particular with the scents and the lighting and everything else.”

Parker crammed the rest of the slice into his mouth. 

“Let’s go introduce you to Juliet,” he said.

The formal dining room was as big as my apartment. Thick curtains were drawn against the huge windows. High above hung an ornate chandelier, but it and all other lights were off. Stationed around the perimeter of the room were a dozen or so candles giving off thin wisps of acrid smoke. 

Parker flicked on a set of lights hung from the wall. Juliet spun around and glared at him.

“Turn off the lights,” she said.

“We haven’t started yet. I need a few minutes to set up the equipment. Come say hello to Sam.”

Juliet winced and crossed the room. I held out my hand and she took it. She was small and impossibly thin and dressed all in white. She wore a gold necklace ending in a pendant shaped like a star. A thin line of black mascara framed the top row of eyelashes. 

She took a step back, keeping hold of my hand. “Do you have something lighter to wear? We try to avoid black. It helps the spirits understand we are not here to harm.”

I pulled at my coat. “It’s a bit cold in here. But I can take it off for the performance.”

Juliet gave a slight shake of her head and released my hand. “I’m not feeling your energy. Do not take offence if I ask you to leave the room during the séance.” She hit the last word a little harder than the rest. 

I searched the table for the Ouija board Parker had mentioned.

“Where is the Ouija board?” I asked.

Juliet made a ticking noise with her tongue. “Sam, Ouija boards are children’s toys. We are not here on children’s business.”

From across the room Parker smiled and winked. He had stitched me up. 

Beth walked in holding a slice of pizza.

“Back to the kitchen,” Juliet said and spun Beth around and marched her out. “You have two minutes and it’s lights out.”

Parker held out his palms. “I have to set up all the cameras.”

Juliet waved a hand and closed the door.

“Come and help me Sam,” Parker said.

Sam unzipped the largest of the black bags and pulled out a tripod. 

“Set that up in the corner.”

“Over here?”

“Right there.”

I fumbled with the legs and finally got them to click. Parker swung in behind and propped a video camera on top. He switched it on and framed the table and turned it off again. 

“This one does visible light. This guy here does the infrared.”

He opened a second of the bags and pulled out a black rectangular contraption that had two lenses on the front and a tablet with a screen on the back. He propped it on a wooden chest against the back wall. 

“Then we have these.”

He handed me a small device a bit bigger than a television remote. At the top was a coloured scale protected by a glass screen. 

“This one,” he said, “measures electromagnetic fields. And last but not least we have the sound recorder.”

He plopped a silver box on the table in the middle of the room. 

“And that’s it. Ghost hunting 101.”

I fingered the switches on the sound recorder, happy to have something to take my mind off the unease in my stomach and the cold. 

“Have you ever captured anything?”

“A couple of anomalies on the infrared. Some gnarly voices on the sound recorder. But it’s all run of the mill stuff in our world. I’m waiting for that big fish, the one that makes the world stand up and take notice. It’s out there waiting, I just need to find it. Maybe tonight.”

He smiled. Footsteps came up the hall. Parker flicked out the lights expecting Juliet and Beth. When no one appeared he stuck his head out the door.

“I swear I heard something.”

I shrugged. “Maybe they’re having fun with us.”

A flash of lightning penetrated the curtains and lit up the room. Thunder followed. The rain intensified and drummed on the windows.

Parker smiled. “We have the weather for it. Come, let’s go eat.”

I started with a beer. The first few sips bubbled in my stomach and threatened to come right back up, but then my body warmed to the task. The alcohol mixed with my blood and drove away some of the unease. I slipped out of my coat and pulled a pizza box close.

Parker said, “There he is.”

Rain belted against the windows. Another flash lit up the room and thunder followed immediately and we all brought our hands to our ears. The power went out. Juliet, led by the light of her phone, brought back four candles and stood them on the table and lit them. 

Parker pushed his face into the glow of a candle and smiled. “Now we have the right atmosphere.”

I asked, “Why do we start at midnight?”

Parker threw his palms in the air. “Yes, why do we start at midnight? Witching hour is 3am.”

Juliet said, “Idle superstition. Strictly, the time is not important. The conditions have to be right. Our mindset must be right.”

Parker opened another beer. “And our mindset improves if we have a few hours of drinking under our belts.”

Beth held up a bottle and Parker raised his from across the table.

Beth said, “Tell us what, or who we are expecting tonight.”

Juliet made little effort to hide her annoyance. “Didn’t you read my email?”

Parker smirked and raised a finger to Beth. “You always do this.”

Beth shrugged, “I’ve been busy. We’ve worked late all week. Tell them Sam.”

“I read the email,” I said.

Parker slapped the table and laughed.

Juliet said, “This house is a strange case. It was in the same family for generations. No murders. No mental illness. Nothing. It’s a clean slate. Then a few years ago it is sold and opens to guests. And then the sightings start. Screaming in the night and objects getting flung off tables and sudden temperature drops. No one can say why.

“The only item of interest I found was a case of two sisters going missing on the same night just before the place was sold. They found one washed ashore not far from here. The other vanished and was never seen again.”

The figure of the girl out by the cliff edge flashed into my head and a feeling of dread broke through. Coincidence, I told myself and I pushed the image aside.

Juliet checked her phone, “It’s almost midnight.”

“Let’s begin.” Parker jumped up and led us out.

We arranged ourselves around the large table in the dining room. Our shadows flickered on the wall by the candle light. Parker checked his equipment one last time and took his seat.

Juliet closed her eyes and held out her slender arms. She inhaled and pointed her palms to the ceiling. “We come with respect and kindness and ask permission to commune with you tonight.”

Beth and Parker followed Juliet’s lead and closed their eyes. I did the same. The wind calmed and the rain eased enough that I could hear the soft crackling of the burning candles. The same vibration I had felt at the pub a week earlier rose in my body, overcoming the numbness of the alcohol.

And then there was a knock at the table. I opened my eyes. Juliet, Parker and Beth all sat still, their arms outstretched and palms pointing to the sky.

“We thank you.” Juliet bowed her head.

My heart beat faster. The vibration turned to resonance and threatened to burst through my skin. A strange feeling grew from within and my mind drifted as it does at the moment of falling asleep. The sound of the rain pelting against the window softened. I closed my eyes. 

When I opened them again the door to the dining room was open. I was sure it was closed when we began. A light came from the hallway and my first thought was that the power had come back on. The temperature dropped and I wished I had my coat. 

A figure appeared in the door. A girl dressed in white with long flowing blonde hair. Every muscle in my body tensed and I slapped my palms on the table. A rush of wind circled the room and a few candles went out. The girl dressed in white entered the room. She passed by Parker and as she did Parker sat bolt upright and opened his eyes wide. He swivelled his head from side to side, searching the darkened room.

“What is happening?” Beth’s voice sounded distant even though she sat beside me. I looked to her and, like Parker, her eyes were open and she wore a look of pure terror. 

Juliet brought down her arms. She opened her mouth but her voice faltered. She finally managed to say, “We acknowledge your presence.”

The girl in white turned and came towards me. She walked slowly and deliberately. Around her neck was a gold necklace hanging a heart-shaped pendant. She held her hands together and in front as if she were carrying a bouquet down a wedding aisle, but there was nothing in her hands. A flash of lightning lit up the room and the girl. Her eyes were big and blue and hinted at tears. Where her mouth should be was nothing but a strip of skin. 

Behind her the door slammed shut and then opened and slammed shut again. Parker stood and picked up the camera from the tripod.

“Stay seated,” Juliet said, her voice distant as Beth’s had been.

“I have to get this,” Parker said. He pointed the camera to the door and it swung open once more. Screams came from the hallway. The door slammed shut.

A flash of lightning and thunder on its heels, the sound muffled like the voices in the room.

The girl stopped beside me. A candle burned behind us and gave her pale skin a glow. She leaned down as if to whisper in my ear, but no words came. Her face was now inches from mine and the electricity buzzed in my ear with such intensity that I braced for a shock. 

She brought her hands to her face and brushed them on the skin where her mouth should be. Some phantom transparent cord tied her wrists together.

My lungs filled with stale air. My eyes burned as if I had spent the last hour crying. I felt a pressure below my fingernails as if dirt was packed underneath. A searing pain rose in the pit of my stomach, no, lower than that.

“What do you want?” I said.

The girl stood tall and she held my gaze. The table shook and the windows rattled. I felt a presence behind me. The girl in white looked up and over my shoulder. Her body tensed and she bent over and flailed as if she were having a seizure. She brought her hands to her face and covered her eyes. She grabbed at her hair and pulled. And then in an instant the girl in white went limp. She fell back, but she did not hit the floor and instead floated above it as if carried by some invisible force. 

The hair on the back of my neck prickled. The sensation of a presence behind me grew. A shape, a silhouette appeared in my mind’s eye, dark and somehow hostile. I dared not turn and look.  

The girl in white floated over the table and hovered for a moment. The door flung open and in an instant the girl in white flew through the opening and into the corridor. The door slammed shut.

I brought my hands to my head and cried out, “Make it stop. Make it stop. Make it stop.” Over and over.

A clap of thunder penetrated deep into my head and I fell back off my chair and to the floor. When I opened my eyes the lights were on and Beth leaned over me. Parker stood behind her and pointed the camera at me.

“Are you ok?” Beth said.

“Are they gone?” I said.

“Is who gone?”

“Are they gone?”

I sat up. Juliet remained in position at the table. The door to the dining room was shut. The girl in white was gone. I spun around to where I had sensed the silhouette, the dark presence, and there was nothing. 

Parker lowered the camera. “What just happened?”
