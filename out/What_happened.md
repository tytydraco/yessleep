It's not a to long story
But something happened to me 3 and a half years ago and I'd like to understand what happened to me. 



I consider it one of the best vacations of my life, but also the one where I experienced the strangest and possibly most dangerous thing in my life!




I was on the Ile d'Oleron with my grandmother, my mother, my two cousins, and my little sister in a little wooden house that was really nice and had a garage with bikes, it was during the summer vacations of 2020, the beach was a few minutes away by bike, and the path linking our house to the beach was in a large forest far from the road and unlit, so we went to the beach all day with my cousins and my sister or we went for bike rides and it was a really nice vacation.



But one day one of my cousin and I had an idea: go to the beach at night! Although it didn't take long by bike, on foot it was a 40-minute walk, and we couldn't take the bikes out of the garage because that would have made noise and woken up mother, who didn't know we were planning to go out in the middle of the night, but we were motivated and felt all-powerful!



We walked through the forest with our phone lights on and we had a good laugh, only our phones had respectively 10% of battery for me and 8% for my cousin. We arrived at the beach and in front of it there was a camper van with a gentleman in it who was pacing up and down. We paid no attention to it and went to dip our feet in the water, it being 2.30 in the morning.




All went well and then, after several hours of fun in the water, we saw a gentleman riding a very special kind of bike that I'd never seen before in my life. He had his headlight on and came straight at us, so we started running in complete panic, but he eventually turned around, I jokingly shouted to him "you've scared us", he simply turned his head without saying anything, then left - well, not really, because a few feet further on we couldn't see him anymore,but we saw a flasj coming where the bike where, so we look there was a flash, attracted by this famous flash, wondering what it is, and wondering if we're not being photographed. Are what it is ? We doesn't understand at the moment so we looked this flash with a lot of questions




And at one point I get the idea, certainly the best idea I've ever had in my life, the idea of turning my head to look around and there I saw, on the opposite side of the road from the wane, a group of three people coming discreetly towards us on the same type of "bike" that I'd never seen before, but they hadn't put their headlights on, so we couldn't see them coming. 





Our survival instinct with my cousin kicked in and we ran to get back on the path that led to the house we were renting, except that the path was in the forest in the dark and took, even walking fast, at least 30min on foot, it was I think, the longest 30 minutes of my life wondering what would have happened if I hadn't turned my head and maybe these people were following us, Was the flash a photo? was it to get our attention ? what simply happened ? and to this day I haven't figured it out, but I remember the first thing I thought was "we're in a Cannibal Corpse video". 





On the way back from the trip, my cousin's phone went dead because it had run out of battery - all that was left was my phone to light the way, and it only had 6% battery life. After that, I couldn't sleep all night, and all the questions I have about this story are still unanswered, if anyone has any idea what might have happened?
