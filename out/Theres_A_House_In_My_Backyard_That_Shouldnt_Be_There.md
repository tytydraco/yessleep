I'm not usually one to post on forums like this, but lately, something strange has been happening, and I'm hoping someone here might have an explanation. For the past few weeks, I've been seeing a house - a house that shouldn't be there.

It appears in my backyard at night. I can't explain it. There's no house there during the day, just an empty patch of grass and the fence. But as soon as the sun sets, this old, crumbling structure is standing at the edge of my yard, silent and still, like it's always belonged there. I've tried to tell myself it's some trick of the light or my mind playing games, but it's hard to shake the feeling that it's waiting for something. For *me.*

It keeps coming back. Night after night. And now I can't stop thinking about it.

Every time I see it, I get this overwhelming feeling, like it's calling to me. I've been keeping my distance, telling myself that staying away is the right thing to do. But the pull is getting harder to ignore. Last night, I couldn't resist anymore. I stepped outside, trying to stay calm as I approached the house, thinking maybe if I got close enough, I'd be able to figure out why it's there - why it keeps coming back.

But the closer I got, the more I felt it - that terrible *wrongness* in the air. This was my first time walking toward the house, but it felt like I'd been near it before, like it had always been there, waiting for me to get close. It wasn't just a chill or a shiver - it was something deeper, something that settled into my bones and made my skin crawl. The air around the house felt thick, like it was *alive*, pulling me toward it even as some unseen force seemed to push me away.

The house loomed over me, dark and imposing, its windows thick with grime, like they were hiding something - or maybe someone - inside. The front door was slightly ajar, just enough to suggest that all I had to do was push it open a little wider. Step inside. See what was waiting for me.

But I didn't. I stopped right there, at the edge of the doorway, frozen. Staring into that thick, yawning blackness, I felt an overwhelming sense that something was holding me back. It wasn't just hesitation - it was as though the air itself between me and the entrance was alive, holding its breath, waiting for me to take that final step. But I couldn't. It was like I'd forgotten how to move forward.

I could hear things inside, though. Voices.

They were faint, barely more than whispers carried on the wind, just out of reach. I strained to listen, but the words slipped away before I could make any sense of them. They sounded like they were calling out names, but none of them were familiar. The whispers ebbed and flowed, tugging at something deep inside me, something that felt buried. It was like I should know who they were, but I don't.

They want me to come inside. I can *feel* it. 

I don't know. Has anyone else experienced something like this? I know how it sounds, but I'm starting to lose my grip on what's real and what isn't. If you've had anything even remotely similar happen, let me know.

Because if this is real... what am I supposed to do?
