Hello. I'm Dr. Smith T. I am a Physicist and a Professor at (REDACTED) University... or was, before I disappeared for ten years. Multiverse... different dimensions... being a young, ambitious man with enough knowledge, I couldn't help but be obsessed with that fascinating topic. The charm of being the one to prove the existence of a whole different earth in a whole different reality was enchanting to me. When I finally did it, I got stuck there for a decade. What I've seen there is... definitely worth telling. Nobody believed what I said. My former colleagues viewed me as crazy then; now they think I've just completely lost it. I don't blame them. I wouldn't have believed me either. I'm in a miserable state at the moment. I need to slowly get my job back, but it will take a while. I'm not really in the mental state to work. Anyway, I came across this subreddit, and many people here seem to share their abnormal experiences. So, I'll post my most important and eventful notes here. 

Day One: I did it. I fucking did it. The formula was perfect this time. I feel like a... a car that's overloaded with a thousand suitcases and about to explode, except that I'm overloaded with excitement.. I don't know if I'm even making sense right now, but it doesn't matter. I'll note what's worthy of... well, being noted.

Note One: After a bit of observation, it seems like I'm placed in a biome that I'm not familiar with. I'm in the middle of some kind of field with lots of grass, except that... the grass is gigantic. And I mean, really gigantic. I tried looking up earlier, and I couldn't really see the sky. However, I was able to see the empty blue sky when I suddenly came across a massive empty spot. I knew it wasn't the end of this strange biome, however, because, in a distance, I saw more of the gigantic grasses. 

Note Two: Apparently, the massive empty spots are kind of common. Every twenty minutes or so of walking, I come across one. Another thing worth noting is how common earthquakes are. They're not that strong, really. Just a couple of shakes and loud, heavy sounds like something huge is falling. They also get more frequent and louder the more I walk.

Note Three: I'm shaken to my core. What I saw... I think I'm safe now. As I was walking, I felt the earthquakes getting louder and louder. And then, a huge shadow towered over me. I felt myself gagging from the sudden stench. I felt like I was at a graveyard that had non-buried bodies, and they were all decomposing. I ran as fast as I could, thinking it would be some kind of huge bird trying to find food for its eaglets. But I found myself in one of the empty spots again, and I saw it clearly. In front of me was an incredibly giant figure walking on two legs. Its brown, yellowish fur looked very dirty, as if it had never been in water before. The stench was deadly. I finally understood the source of the earthquakes and the empty spots. It was just that giant creature, simply walking. 

Day Two: I got no sleep last night. I couldn't. Instead, I followed the giant carefully. It seemed like it didn't take any notice of me. I was a tiny, helpless ant in the presence of a bigger, superior creature. After hours of stalking it, it seemed like I was out of the huge grass area, and reached somewhere disturbing. There were many of that creature, each of them had the same characteristics. And, they were all.. mindlessly mating, like it was their purpose, like they only lived for that. They were covered in fur, except in certain areas: their genitals and their faces. They all had the same humanlike face. It's also worth mentioning that their faces always looked blank. Always. No reaction to anything. Non-sentient beings that mate ruthlessly and only rarely leave to find sources of nutrition.

There are also many of them. Like, very many. Once a female gets pregnant, she gives birth in the span of two to four hours. I also noticed that they die a lot. If I were to assume, it would be because of exhaustion due to the excessive amount of sex or the lack of nutrition. I might stay here a couple of days to study them more, since they don't seem very dangerous, although very big.
