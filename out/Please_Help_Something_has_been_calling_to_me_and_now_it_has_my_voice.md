It is currently 4:13pm January 28th, 2024. I am going to get this all down here, and in case this is the last time that I am here to reach out I hope that I put this in the right place. My name is Maggie Williams, I am 24 years old. I just moved into my new house three weeks ago, and if I could take everything back I would/ I am currently student teaching in a kindergarten classroom in a local school district and I thought everything was perfect. That was until about a week ago.   
  
I live alone. It is not a big house, far enough out of town to get the country feel, but close enough that the commute to work is less than a half hour. Typing this now I am in the closet in the only bedroom of the house. Not even the locked door or the hanging coats that are blocking the door are enough to make me feel safe at this point. My father thinks that I am too far from home, and the high elevation is just sending me into a state of madness. At this point I need someone to believe me, this is not altitude sickness, this is not home sickness, this is not a descent into madness. I am in danger. It is here.  
  
Enough about me, there should be enough there that someone will know where to find me if I do not make it out of here. About a week ago I heard a voice calling to me. Late at night, it sounded like it was coming from the back yard. I turned the light on, but I could not see anything, and the tree line was too dark to see any past that. I think looking was my first mistake. A few days later my doorbell started. Every 33 minutes it would ring twice. All night long, starting around 11pm, until 4 am. Every. Thirty-three. Minutes. Exactly. For weeks. I took the batteries out of the sensor, it still happened. I took the sensor off the wall completely and threw it away. I watched them take it when they took the trash, and it kept happening. I took a hammer and smashed the doorbell that was hanging by the door. There is only a mere slightly discolored spot and some dents in the house at this point, and yet it keeps ringing.   
  
After the doorbell it was the reflections. Out of the corner of my eye I could see it. Tall, dark, twisted face, no clothes but seeming to have no body parts at the same time.It started in the mirrors. I covered them but could still feel it there. Watching. Always watching through the sheets. I smashed the mirrors. They now sit broken, but still tightly wrapped with dark sheets. Anything that can cast a reflection in the house is now covered. With no reflections I can still feel the featureless face on me.   
  
Last week, I let it in. I did not mean to. I was at the end. The bell was seeming to echo as if it was coming from my brain. I was in my closet like I am now, but I could not take it any more. I stood and ran to the front door. I swung the door open and screamed “Leave me alone.” I just wanted whatever it was to leave me alone.   
  
Now it calls to me. Now, it calls to me. But it is me. My voice, but not quite right. My reflection, but not quite right. My footsteps, dragging footsteps up and down the hall all night long as the bell rings. As the voice calls. As it tries to call me from my place. It cant seem to find me. Not yet. It moves in the shadows. It is the shadows. It is the very air around me. And it will not stop until it finds me.   
  
I can hear it now. “Leave me alone, leave me alone, leave me alone, leave me alone, leave me alone, leave me alone, leave me alone, leave me alone, leavemealone, leavemealone, leavemealoneleavemealone” Its chant seems to be coming from the hall, and inside my head at the same time.   
  
My name is Maggie Williams. I am 24 years old. I am a student teacher to 22 amazing kindergarten students. I am not going crazy. This is happening. That is not me. I need help. If anyone sees this, I need help. If anyone sees this and it is too late, please find my mother and father, Mary and Kennith Williams, and let them know what really happened to me. 

I’m sorry mom. I should not have opened the door.
