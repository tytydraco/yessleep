I don't know when it started, but these terrible, vivid nightmares or night terrors—they've been with me for as long as I can remember. It doesn't matter how old I was; the dreams always featured scenes of war, apocalyptic scenarios, and encounters with killers. Faces haunt me still, their eyes piercing into my soul, their voices screaming, their bodies falling. There was the knife at my face, the desperate breathlessness of running as fast as my legs could carry me.

But amidst these recurring nightmares, there's one memory that stands out, though even now, I question its reality. It was during a time of renovation at our home, back when I was barely 13 or 14 years old. My bed was positioned under a window without its cover, just a curtain draped across a nearby door. My brother slept above me on a bunk bed. It was the early 2000s, and I had just received my first mobile phone, a Sony Ericsson Xperia (or something very similar). I was thrilled, exploring its features and settings late into the night.

As I navigated through the menus, I stumbled upon something unexpected—an unfamiliar screen, horizontal where it should have been vertical. Intrigued and slightly uneasy, I continued to explore. Then, abruptly, an eye appeared on the screen. It was unlike anything I'd seen before—beautiful yet chilling, very petrifying. with vivid green irises adorned in dark green shadow and shimmering gold, framed by long, luxurious lashes. I remember the fear that gripped me as the eye seemed to look right through me, freezing me in place.

I panicked, heart pounding wildly, and hastily placed the phone on my chest, as if shielding myself from its gaze. For minutes—or what felt like an eternity—I lay there, eyes shut tight, biting my lip, trying to calm my racing heart. When I finally mustered the courage to move, I switched on the light beside my bed. Strangely, I didn't feel like I had just woken up from a dream; rather, it felt as though reality had been intruded upon.

The phone never exhibited that strange behavior again. To this day, I wrestle with the memory, unsure if it was a hallucination born of sleep deprivation and youthful imagination, or a genuine, inexplicable encounter with something beyond comprehension. Unlike my usual nightmares, this experience didn't terrify me in the traditional sense. Instead, it left an indelible mark because I struggle to separate it from what I perceive as reality—a nagging doubt that lingers in my mind even now.

In the years since, I've delved into various explanations—from glitches in early mobile phone technology to paranormal phenomena. None of these theories have satisfied the uneasy feeling that lingers within me. It's not just the image of the eye itself but the profound sense of being watched and the uncertainty about whether it was a mere glitch or something more sinister.

Reflecting on that night, I wonder if there was a connection between my recurring nightmares and this singular event. Could it have been a manifestation of my subconscious fears, projected onto the screen of a new and unfamiliar device? Or was it a glimpse into a realm beyond our understanding, a brief intersection between the mundane and the supernatural?

Over the years, I've shared this story with only a few close friends and family members, often met with skepticism or dismissive laughter. It's understandable—how could a simple mobile phone evoke such profound unease? Yet, for me, the experience remains a touchstone, a reminder that reality is often more complex and mysterious than we can comprehend.

As I continue to navigate adulthood, I find myself drawn back to that moment of uncertainty and fear, grappling with questions that may never have clear answers. Perhaps, in the end, the ambiguity of that night is its own lesson—a reminder to approach the mysteries of life with humility and an open mind, acknowledging that some truths may forever elude our understanding.

So, I carry on, haunted by both my nightly terrors and the enigmatic encounter with the eye on my phone, searching for meaning in the overlapping realms of dreams and reality. For now, the lines remain blurred, and I find solace in the knowledge that I am not alone in confronting the inexplicable—whether in the dark recesses of my mind or the glow of a digital screen.
