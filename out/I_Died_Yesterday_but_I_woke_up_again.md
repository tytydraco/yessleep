I need help.

No matter how many times I think it over, no matter how many times I check the date, no matter how many times I look at the pictures, no matter how much I look at the stains on the concrete, no matter how much I tell myself it was a dream... I know for a fact it was real.

I died, and now I'm back.

Yesterday was normal, if not a little better than normal, since I went out to eat ice cream with friends. I woke up, ate breakfast, finished by deliveries, and then headed back home. A normal day, until I opened the door of my apartment to find a person robbing my place. I still don't know how they got in, the door was locked and so were the windows. I am also on the third floor and there are bars over the windows. Unfortunately that doesn't change the fact that they got in, and stabbed me.

I didn't know they had a knife, I was just trying to protect what little I had. I know now it would have been better to call the police... but I didn't. I attacked him and in return, I was stabbed in the gut and bled out on my apartment floor alone.

I still remember my last words clearly, "I hope mom comes to my funeral." Honestly, now that I have time to think it over, I feel like I could have said something more important. I guess in the moment I just wanted to see  Mom again.

I woke up six hours later in my bed in a completely different set of clothes, with my wound fully healed.

At first I thought I might have been dreaming. It was the most logical explanation, especially since I woke up in my bed. That was until I saw the very obvious red stain on the floor, in the exact spot I died in. I had no idea what to do. I stood there in the hallway staring down at the evidence of my very own murder, now both the victim and witness to a crime that had now been reversed.

I covered the red stain with a mat, and cried for a while. Then considered my options, I could call the police, but I had no reasonable explanation. I could tell people, but they wouldn't believe me, or worse, they would lock me up. I could look for answers, but there was nothing to go off of, other than the robber, the knife, and how I woke up. The only thing I could think to do was continue on with my life as normal.

It felt surreal, eating breakfast, walking to work, delivering packages, and then going back home that day. I couldn't help myself but question if anyone noticed something different about me. Yet, nobody said a word, nobody glared at me or flinched, or even gave me more than the usual 'hello'. Honestly, at the end of the day I found myself asking if my death meant anything at all. Although after getting slightly frustrated at the lack of attention, I realized that if I had changed then people would ask too many questions and I didn't want that either. So I just went through the day feeling confused and annoyed by my current situation.

After work I decided to take a detour and walk through a nearby park. Its really small, but being alone in an open space allowed me to think a bit.  
The few questions which I still am asking are; Why was I revived? Did the robber revive me or did something else do it? Is this temporary? Can I die again or was it just that one time?  
I know I can answer that last one easily, but even after what happened I still fear death. I am not going to end my second chance for curiosity's sake. Even though my life is dull, I enjoy it. I am grateful to be alive, just slightly worried about what will happen next.

The time I spent at the park greatly lifted my burdens and I headed home feeling much more gratitude then I had been. In fact I walked home feeling kind of like a children's cartoon character that had just learned their lesson. Even as I am writing this I feel that way, because what other purpose did that nightmare serve? I highly doubt that I am supposed to become some kind of superhero now. I will still look for other reasons and clues to what this all could mean, and if someone is behind this, but for now I am just going to continue living my life as normal.

I just saw something. There is someone outside my window. I called the police and am in my closet now. I went through the hallway opposing that window, so they couldn't see where I hid.

It's been thirty minutes and the police haven't arrived yet. I don't think that figure was the robber, they looked too short. I have no idea how they got to that window. I don't want to die again.

It's been an hour and I still don't hear sirens. My phone is at fifty seven percent as of me writing this. I called again but all they said was they were on they're way. I'll continue writing until something happens, if I hear someone enter my apartment I'll publish this.

It's been three hours. It's nearly 12:40pm at this point. Where are the police? Why are they knocking on the window? If no one comes in the next ten minutes I'll just post this and run.

It's behind me. I can see it's eyes in the reflection. I don;t knwo want to do oh god help me please. Please someone help. I'm ttoo afriad to move. I'm not going to type it'll hear

I woke up again. I was killed by whatever was in there with me. I am currently in a donut shop two blocks away from my house, I got out of there as soon as I realized what had happened. I called the police, but it hung up on me when I did. I've tried so many people's phones, but none of them work. I am too scared to even tell anyone now. What if it silences them to? I have no idea if it can do that, but I don't want to test it.

One of my questions was answered last night though, I can die multiple times. Each time feels like sleeping, it's not darkness, just fuzziness for an instant and then I wake up again.

I don't know what that thing was but it was horrifying. I can't describe much of it, other than eyes. It blended in with the wall, but was just slightly off that I could see it's eyes in my phone screen's reflection. I think it's reviving me, for what purpose though I have no clue. I just know that whatever it is wants to kill me. 

I went to work and nothing seemed out of the ordinary. I think I'll stay in a hotel tonight, and then maybe go back to my apartment tomorrow. I'll go with someone though, just in case it's still there. Then they can call the police for me... or if not that, at least I'll have someone else who I can talk to about all this, other than whoever reads this after I post it.

After I arrived at my hotel room I called a work friend over, explaining I was at a hotel due to someone stalking me. It was a simple but believable lie. He asked if I had contacted the police about it, and I told him I had and they didn't do anything about it. That stuck up a nice conversation about how law enforcement just isn't reliable for crimes like these without evidence, it got my mind off things, even though I felt kind of awful for bad mouthing the police when they *really couldn't* do anything to help.

It's almost 11:30pm as I'm writing this, and I feel good about my plan. My work friend is going to leave in a few minutes, but there has been no sign of it. 

It's here.

My work friend is currently in the bathroom, and I can see it out the window again. It isn't up close like it was before.  It's in the parking lot below instead, looking up at me. It also doesn't look human like it had when it was in the window last night. I'm not taking my eyes off it until he gets out of the bathroom. It only appeared after he left, so if he comes back maybe- MAYBE it might leave me alone. I can type more after he comes out of the bathroom, but the line is about to drop out of my peripheral vision.

He sees it too. I'm not crazy. He sees it. He tried to call the police, but the same thing happened. I explained a little and he got pretty pissed that I didn't tell him, but agreed he probably wouldn't have believed me. We're taking shifts watching the thing, it hasn't moved for half an hour.

I can feel it touching me. It feels like pins and needles where ever it does. Then after it pulls away it itches for a while like a bug bite. I hate this. We don't know how it got in. I think I'm going to die again. I'm not worried about me dying though, I know I'll come back. I'm more worried about Mack. I don't want him to die because of this being I now seem to be carrying around with me. He is watching me type from his hiding spot under the bed. He can probably see what it fully looks like. If you're reading this after I've died Mack, I'll be okay I promise. This has happened two times already. I'm sorry I dragged you into this, please stay away from me after you get out of this. I don't want anyone to else to die. 

I can't drop the phone. 

My hands feel like they're asleep. 



Why haven't you killed me yet?

Can I speak?

Please don't.

Where did you come from?

Why are you bringing me back?

Is it permanent?

What is it?

Why?

Will you kill us after I do it?

Please.

Why me?

So it was random?

Then why was I chosen?

The plea for help I began with seems almost foolish now. I started confused, and ended writing this feeling almost like I'd found the answers to all my questions. It spoke to me, and I wrote back to it. Mack is still hiding. In fact it's still watching me type this. It always was, because this is exactly what it wanted. I can see it's form move in the static of black shadows of the room and windows. 

Before I wrote it off as my mind playing tricks on me, like when I thought there was something in the blackness of my bedroom, or down the hall. I'll wake up tomorrow, but today I'm going to die. I'm going to die, and wake up every day for the rest of my life, until the end of time. I asked how to stop it, because I know eventually I'll cave.

It answered me, but don't worry, it said they'll wake up.
