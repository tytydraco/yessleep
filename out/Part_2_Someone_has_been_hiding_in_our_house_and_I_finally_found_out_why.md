From the night I saw the pale creature in our living room, things were not the same for me. I was now convinced not only that I wasn’t crazy, but that Jacob somehow knew something I didn’t know. What had made him angry at me? What did he see behind me, in the dark, just moments after I’d seen that pale creature staring at him? He kept telling me I was still hallucinating. He kept telling me he was concerned, though his behavior was not matching his words. He didn’t really seem concerned. He seemed stressed.  
  
I decided to go to my mom’s, out of town for a couple of days. I told Jacob it was just to take a break and get away from the house.  
  
What I really wanted was to get some space from him. And last, to finally prove to myself I wasn’t hallucinating. The pale baby wasn’t a hallucination. If I wouldn't see it at my mom’s, it meant it wasn’t haunting me in any horror-ish movie kind of fashion.  
  
A tiny creature was hiding in our house, and it was hateful. There was something unsettling about the idea someone was hiding within the same walls we lived in every day. How often was it standing behind me or watching me while I was cooking, eating, reading, sleeping? Knowing exactly what was hiding it though made it even worse.  
  
My days at my mother’s went on uneventfully. I did some work for the agency from her house, and didn’t have any kind of hallucinations or episodes. I spoke to Jacob on the phone, and he seemed fine, if more rushed than usual. I just thought he was busy with work.  
  
At night, I kept thinking of our uninvited guest. Of his sorrowful voice calling “mom” when looking at me, of his sudden hateful eyes once he’d turned to Jacob. Had I left Jacob in danger at home? For some reason, I didn’t feel concerned about him. Ever since this horror had started, I’d felt like he was hiding something from me. The constant denials of what I was living, the gaslighting. And then that quick look behind my back that night. Had he seen the pale baby as well? If yes, why deny it? Why go to such lengths to make me feel crazy?  
  
What was he hiding?  
  
After three days, I got back home. We grabbed pizza and Jacob seemed to be in an exceptionally good mood. He didn’t look angry, concerned, or rushed in any way. For a moment, I thought things were about to finally calm down. Maybe we had been the victims of an isolated supernatural episode? A ghost of some sort that had occupied our lives?  
  
I snorted at my own naivety for such an interpretation. I had never experienced nor believed in any kind of supernatural. I never saw or thought I could see ghosts. And now here I was, not only believing it, but also finding a “rational” explanation for its disappearance!  
  
I finally accepted then, while looking at a smiling and caring husband, I had just had a burnout episode, and nothing was wrong with Jacob, with me, or with the house.  
  
I went to sleep relieved.

How stupid can someone be?  
  
How quick can I possibly go from thinking Jacob is hiding something, that a ghost-ish baby is haunting our house, only to a few days after rejecting everything as a projection of my stressed mind? Such a dumb rollercoaster!  
  
A rollercoaster that got to its final destination in a decisive and frightening way that night.  
  
It didn’t take another encounter with the baby to wrap up everything I had seen and finally put me on the right track, where I could finally accept something was happening to us. All it took was a nightmare. A horribly realistic nightmare.  
  
I had just come home to find Jacob standing in the living room, behind the TV. Exactly where the pale creature had been standing a few nights back. Jacob was breathing heavily, he wasn’t looking at me. I looked at his rapidly rising and falling chest, then lowered my sight to look at his hands. They were open, the palms raised up, like he was studying them. They were soaked in blood. He didn’t seem to be aware of me until I took a step toward him.  
  
He suddenly snapped his head upward, but his eyes didn’t lock on me yet, they wandered through and beyond me. Like he was seeing things that I couldn’t. Until they locked on me. And they changed. They started growing to a hate I had never seen in him. A hate I’d only seen in our unwanted guest that night. His thin lips turned into a snarl, he cocked his head on his left, like a predator fascinated by a prey it didn’t expect to find there.  
  
“J-Jacob?” I took a step back, suddenly frightened by him. He matched each step I took backward with one toward me. The room suddenly fell quiet. It started to change. The walls took a different shape, strange signs and letters started to appear on them.  
  
The writings were all over the walls and floor, drawn in what looked like red chalk. None of them made any sense to me. I only remember some words:  
  
“KABIAKKRAKKROY SIDEREUS IGNAVS TVRINVS”  
  
I looked around the room I didn’t recognize anymore. Candles were displaced all over the floor, lightening the words written all around me.  
  
“You filthy witch!” Jacob’s voice suddenly shifted my focus back to him. He was very close. He shouted with a hate I couldn’t believe was coming from him. And then he raced toward me. I didn’t even realize what was happening before he grabbed my hair, pulled me back, spun me around and then threw me on the ground with such violence I thought all my teeth had broken. I was laying with my face on the wooden floor when I suddenly felt him on my back. He grabbed my hair again, pulled me up and threw me.  
  
And suddenly I was rolling down wooden stairs, each step hitting different parts of my body. Jacob’s voice still echoed in the house, calling me names. On the last step, I finally managed to scream. I looked at the stains of blood on the stairs, then I looked at my belly, where most of the pain seemed to come from. It was bleeding. I kept screaming.  
  
And that’s when I found myself sitting up on our bed, in our home. It was like my brain had just synchronized back into my body in the middle of a loud and long scream. Jacob was sitting next to me. His hands were on my shoulders, and when I turned to him I saw his face. No snarl, no hate in his eyes. But it was Jacob, the same Jacob I’d just watched beating me with savage violence, and throwing me downstairs I’d never seen before in my life.  
  
“GET OFF ME!” I shouted and pushed him away, I stood up next to the bed, shivering. I tried to make sense of what had happened. The violence, the pain, those stairs… Those eyes. It all felt so real. It took me a few seconds to figure out I’d had a bad dream.  
  
I was about to speak, then I heard it. A faint cry, the same cry I’d heard before. Now coming from… Our room? I heard Jacob talking to me, but he was only noise in the background. Nothing mattered to me other than identifying the source of that sorrowful cry.  
  
And the moment I did understand where it was coming from, a shudder crawled across my spine and tickled the back of my head. I cocked my head back and looked up at the ceiling. There, crawling with his back to me, like a spider, was the baby, the creature. I could only see its back, wrapped in the same rags and ripped clothes. Old clothes. The toddler stopped the moment I saw it, like he’d somehow felt my look on its neck. Then its head twirled, in such an unnatural way I felt bile reaching the back of my throat, but I didn’t look away. His eyes fixated on me.  
  
“*Mom*.”  
  
His tiny right hand then left the ceiling he was crawling on, and raised to point at something. I followed his bony finger to see what he was pointing at.
