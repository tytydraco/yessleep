 don’t know where to post this, but people here seem to understand when something is wrong and no one else believes you.

I’m an artist. Not a successful one—just competent enough to pay rent. I work mostly in ink and clay. Abstract forms. Symbolic abstractions. I’ve always been skeptical of people who claim art “channels” something.

I don’t believe in that.

That’s why this is so hard to explain.

It started with a sketchbook that didn’t belong to me.

I found it in a storage unit I’d just rented. The manager swore it had been empty before. The book was old, soft leather, filled with symbols that looked… wrong. Not occult symbols. Not runes. Nothing I recognized.

They felt unfinished.

Incomplete in a way that made my head hurt if I looked too long.

I almost threw it out. I wish I had.

Instead, I started copying them. Not because I wanted to—because my hand wouldn’t stop.

The first symbol felt harmless. Familiar, even. When I drew it, I felt calmer. Focused. Like something had slid quietly into place.

The second symbol made my wrist ache.

The third made my stomach roll.

That’s when I noticed something else.

When I finished a symbol, something changed.

Not around me. In me.

Memories didn’t disappear so much as lose their weight. Emotions dulled at the edges. I caught myself pausing mid-thought, reaching for details that felt just out of reach—names, sequences, the reason I’d picked something up in the first place.

I didn’t panic. I adjusted. People do that when something doesn’t fit yet.

Then I saw someone else drawing them.

He was sitting in a café, hunched over a notebook. I only caught a glimpse of the page before my breath hitched.

I knew the shape instantly.

My pulse spiked. My hands started shaking before I realized I’d stopped walking.

I approached him without thinking.

“Where—” My voice cracked. I swallowed. “Where have you seen that?”

He looked up slowly, eyes narrowing, confusion pulling his face tight like he was trying to recognize me through fog.

“What are you talking about?” he said.

That made it worse.

“You didn’t make that up,” I said, too fast. “You didn’t just invent that.”

His chair scraped back. He closed the notebook halfway, like he was shielding it.

“Why are you asking me that?” he snapped.

My chest felt hot. My thoughts tangled.

“You’re watching me,” I said before I could stop myself. “You’ve seen it somewhere else. Someone showed you.”

His expression shifted—from confusion to something sharp and afraid.

“I don’t finish them anymore,” he said quietly. “I stopped when it started taking things.”

I asked what things.

He stared past me, jaw clenched, like answering would make it happen again.

A week later, I found him again—this time in a hospital ward. Catatonic. Hands bandaged. The nurses said he kept trying to draw on the walls with his fingers.

They showed me the marks.

They weren’t complete.

That’s when I realized the truth.

The symbols aren’t knowledge.

They’re requests.

Each one asks for something small. A memory. A feeling. A piece of identity. And if the symbol is wrong—if it’s incomplete—it asks again.

And again.

I tried to stop.

I really did.

But once you’ve started, it doesn’t let you quit. The symbols appear everywhere—reflections, cracks in the sidewalk, the negative space between objects. They don’t demand. They wait.

And if you don’t finish them, something else does.

I started waking up with ink on my hands.

Clay under my fingernails.

New symbols completed in my own style—more precise than anything I’ve ever drawn.

Each time, I felt smaller.

Lighter.

Like something was being assembled using pieces of me.

Last night, I finished the symbol I’ve been avoiding.

I don’t remember drawing it.

But when I looked at it, I understood what it was asking for.

It wasn’t asking for knowledge.

It was asking for completion.

The room feels crowded now, even when I’m alone. When I close my eyes, I feel pressure—like too many limbs folding into too little space.

If anyone reading this has seen these symbols, or knows someone who has—please tell me how to stop.

Because something is answering back now.

And I don’t think there’s much of me left to give.
