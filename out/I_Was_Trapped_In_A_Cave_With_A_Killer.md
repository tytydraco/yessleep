Hell Hole. One of the most wicked caves in the world to explore. Located in Santa Cruz, California, a trek through this pitch-black claustrophobic nightmare consisted of impossibly narrow passageways, dizzying vertical descents and deadly drops everywhere. And that’s why I loved it. The caving, or spelunking, community was small, but tightly knit and craved these death-defying adventures. Why did we do it? Some people loved being able to “get away from it all” and that was true; when you’re 100 feet underground, you may as well be on a different planet. But for me, it was the adrenaline rush. So, when my childhood friend, and fellow caver, Zeke, told me he’d found an entirely new cave while camping, just a stone’s throw away from Hell Hole, I couldn’t book my flight fast enough.  
I arrived at the Wilder Ranch State Park and pulled up next to Zeke’s car. I stepped out of my car and approached Zeke, who was grabbing gear from his trunk. There was someone with him I didn’t recognize. He was tall but slim and was bald with striking grey eyes.   
“Jack!” Zeke said to me, then glanced over at the man. “This is Günther. I met him when I went to Oktoberfest. He’s caved all over Europe. He’s here on vacation and wanted to join us.”  
“Cool,” I said, shaking Günther’s hand. He nodded at me.  
“Nice to meet you,” he said in a thick German accent.   
“Kyle coming?” I asked. Zeke shook his head.  
“Flight cancelled due to bad weather. He’s stuck in Canada. Might be a couple days. He’s pissed.”  
After exchanging pleasantries, we headed towards the cave, directly opposite the direction of where Hell Hole was. About ten minutes later, we arrived at a rock covered hole behind a bush.  
“I didn’t want anyone else to accidentally find it and fall in, so I covered the entrance up,” Zeke said, pulling the rocks away.  
The entrance was about the size of a manhole covering. I shined my light into it and saw that it was a ten-foot drop right off the bat.   
“Did you explore any?” Günther asked Zeke.   
“Just a little. There’s a slight downwards sloping birth canal right away, probably 100 feet. There are one or two cracks with light on the way down. It opens into a small room, but it’s pitch black and that’s where I had to turn around because I didn’t have a headlamp.”  
“Okay, let’s double check our gear and head in,” I said.  
Our gear consisted of special hard hats with LED headlamps, back-up flashlights, glowsticks, various tools, ropes, a first aid kit, some snacks and water. We were also wearing flexible grippy climbing boots, grippy climbing gloves and knee and elbow pads. No phones, because once you were under, there would be no signal. Zeke also had a GoPro to document the excursion.  
“So, it’s supposed to start raining around 2pm and this cave will definitely flood. So, we have a hard return time of noon. No point in risking it. And that still gives us about six hours in there. Besides, we’ll be here for the next four days. No need to go crazy on the first,” I said. Everyone nodded. Zeke pulled his GoPro off his hard hat and tapped it.  
“Dammit! I forgot to change the battery,” he swore. He rifled through his bag and then sighed.  
“I left the spare in the car. Y’all go on ahead and get through the birth canal, I’ll catch up to you.”  
Before we could argue he took off. Günther and I exchanged looks.  
“Should we wait?” he asked. I shook my head.  
“Nah, let’s get in there. I’m dying to see it. We’ll just wait in the room after the birth canal.”  
And with that I climbed in. I descended the ten-foot drop by pushing my feet up against both sides of the cave entrance, and then inching down until I could drop the last five feet. I gave Günther a thumbs-up, before clicking on my headlamp and plunging headfirst into the birth canal.  
It lived up to its namesake. Remember those tight tubes that you would climb through in playgrounds as a kid? Now shrink it by 50%, make it cold, slippery and so tight that you might get stuck at any second. I shimmied down the chute for a few minutes. It narrowed, and I realized my hard hat wouldn’t make the squeeze. Since my hands were splayed out in front of me, I slowly pulled the hard hat off and pushed it in front of me, then continued onwards.  
It was still too tight. The walls of the chute were pressing down on my chest from all angles. I couldn’t get a deep breath in at all. I tried to wriggle backwards but couldn’t get any purchase. Was I stuck?  
Panic started to creep in. Zeke was a little guy… had he unknowingly gotten me stuck 40 feet below the earth by not realizing I couldn’t fit? This tunnel was barely bigger than a basketball.  
But then I steeled myself… Zeke knew what he was doing and wouldn’t have made so simple a mistake. More so, this wasn’t my first time. I knew what I had to do.  
I exhaled fully, and watched a little dust kick up in front of my face. Once the last ounce of air left my lungs, I felt the ceiling pull off my back. I kicked forward and continued onwards, and the walls let up a little more so I could breathe shallow.   
After what felt like a good ten minutes, I heard my hard hat slide over a rocky edge and hit the floor. Light spilled up in the room in front of me, and I breathed a sigh of relief. I pulled myself out of the birth canal and took a breather.   
After catching my breath and putting my hard hat back on, I glanced up into the birth canal. The downward slope was slight, so I could just make out Günther’s chin about fifty feet away.   
“It’s gets real tight!” I yelled into the canal, “You’ll have to exhale fully.”  
“Ja. I am about to reach that spot!” he replied. I turned away and shined my headlamp around the room. It was about ten feet by ten feet with a ceiling around eight, so decently sized. The rock walls were slightly wet, and I saw a couple spiders skittering about. To the side of the room was a hole, about three feet high, that led further into the cave. I glanced inside and saw a narrow passageway that ended in a blind turn. Lastly, next to the entrance of the birth canal, was an elevated ledge. Satisfied, I took my hard hat off, leaned back and waited for Günther to arrive.  
About ten minutes later, Günther reached the end. I grabbed one of his hands and pulled him out. He sat down heavily, and rubbed his sweaty bald head with his shirt.  
“Okay, now we will wait,” he muttered, before leaning back and closing his eyes.   
About thirty minutes went by, during which we rested and talked a little. I glanced at my watch; it was nearly 8am now.   
“He’s gotta be in the birth canal by now,” I said. I turned to the entrance and peered into the shaft but saw nothing.  
“Zeke!” I called, but no answer came back. I started to lean back but then noticed a beam of light filling the canal. A moment later, I could just make out Zeke’s chin.   
“He’s on the way,” I said.  
“Gut.”  
I glanced back into the tunnel and saw Zeke’s face come fully into view. He looked at me, and I narrowed my eyebrows. He looked pale, as if he was freezing. He was also expressionless. Except for his eyes, which flashed darkly at me under the shine of my light.    
“Zeke?” I asked, startled. Zeke took off his hard hat, which blocked my view of him. I sat back, a little troubled.  
“Something wrong?” Günther asked. I shrugged.   
“I don’t think so.”   
The next ten minutes went by slowly, as we listened to the sound of Zeke wriggling his way down the birth canal. It seemed that he struggled immensely to get through.  
“Don’t forget you have to exhale at the tight spot to make the squeeze!” I yelled into the birth canal. I pulled back, very confused at this point.   
It took Zeke forty minutes in total to get through according to my estimate, which again didn’t make sense. Finally, he reached the exit.  
Günther and I both grabbed a hand and pulled Zeke out of the birth canal.  
As we pulled, I realized something wasn’t right. The hand I pulled was large and had a crushing grip. The hand released to grasp the side of the exit and Zeke pulled himself out. Günther and I stared in confusion as Zeke righted himself in front of us. But his body was all wrong. Zeke was a small guy, no more than 5-5… but he was now easily 6-2, with powerful arms and broad shoulders.   
“Was zum Teufel?..” Günther breathed.   
Zeke’s face was still completely expressionless and looked even paler than it was thirty minutes ago. It was milk white. Zeke turned to me, and those dark eyes flashed maniacally. At the same time, a thin line of blood trickled down his throat.  
 And then it clicked in my head. This wasn’t Zeke. This was somebody else.  
AND HE WAS WEARING ZEKE’S FACE.   
The man pulled a massive combat knife out of a sheath on his forearm. The stainless steel glinted under the light of his headlamp.   
Günther turned to me.  
“Run.”   
The man lurched forward and plunged the knife into Günther’s chest. He ripped it out and a spray of blood splattered my face. It stopped and then sprayed again a half second later. It stopped and then sprayed again, stopped and again…  
I screamed and dove headfirst, blindly, into the three-foot hole at the end of the room. I hit the ground face first, and my hard-hat went flying off my head, sending a beam of light spinning around the room before disappearing down the passageway. I scrambled to my feet, tasting blood in my mouth and feeling a spike of pain in my nose, which was immediately followed by a trickle of blood down my lips and chin, issuing from my nostrils.   
A sickly crack echoed through the passageway. I turned towards the three-foot hole as the man approached it.   
Günther’s severed head dropped through the hole. It hit the ground with a wet thud and then came to a stop at my feet.  I tried to scream again, but my pounding heart was in my throat. Then the snow white face of Zeke poked through the hole and those vile eyes stared hungrily at me.  
Gulping blood, I turned heel and sprinted for the end of the room, where the blind turn was. I rounded it and gasped.  
It was a vertical cliff, which I had just stepped off. I howled as I felt myself fall and flung my hands out for something to grab. My right hand found purchase on a jagged rock edge, and I gripped it for everything I had. The rock sliced my palm, but I did not let go, wincing as the knife edge dug deeper into my flesh. I threw my other hand up onto the edge for support and then looked down into the pitch-black abyss, unable to see what was beneath me.   
Carefully, I withdrew my bleeding right hand and fumbled for my fanny pack. I unzipped it and withdrew a glowstick. I jammed it against the rock wall, cracking it, and then dropped it below me. It fell for about forty feet, before stopping.   
A light shined on me, illuminating my precarious position on the rock wall. I glanced up and saw the face of Zeke, staring at me from under his headlamp. He disappeared for a second, then reappeared with a bundle of ropes. My stomach flipped; I had to get down first.  
Throwing caution to the wind, I scrambled down the rock wall, my bloody right hand slipping as I did. I made it down halfway before losing my grip and falling the rest of the way. I landed feet first, before slamming my tailbone into the rock. A bolt of pain shot up through my back.  
Darkness.   
I took a sputtering breath as I came to in a heap on the rock. The first thing I noticed was the sound of a hammer striking a nail. I opened my eyes and saw two ropes snaking down the cliff face. The hammering stopped and the man began to climb down the ropes. He was taking his time. I glanced at my watch and saw that it was nearly 10am. I’d been out of it for more than an hour, long enough for him to set up those ropes.  
I clambered painfully to my feet, my breath catching in my chest when my tailbone wailed at me in pain. I ignored it and hobbled away. The man reached the bottom and I saw that he wasn’t running. He was walking.  
It made sense. The only way out was back the way we came. I was trapped and he knew it. There was no need to run.   
If he wasn’t going to run, neither would I. I slowed my gait a little, just enough to prevent any more blind cliff jumps. I staggered down the passage which continued for a good ten minutes. I pulled out my back-up flashlight and shined it in front of me, knowing that the man was close behind. Whenever I noticed the shine of his headlamp, I picked up the pace, and the pain of my tailbone increased every time.  
My nose was broken, my right hand was cut open, my tailbone was certainly broken and upon reaching into my mouth, I pulled out a bloody canine and two molars. I also likely had a minor concussion, because my head was pounding. I felt my scalp and some blood on my fingers confirmed the injury. I had no weapon, and nearly all of my gear was still sitting in the room next to the birth canal. All I had was a flashlight and a half dozen glowsticks in my fanny pack. I was running through an unexplored cave that could end at any moment and I had no way to defend myself.  
The pain in my tailbone spiked and I puked on the rocky floor; it was mostly the blood that I had been swallowing. The light of his headlamp illuminated me and I took off again.   
I reached a narrow chute, not as tight as the birth canal, but would still take time to push through. I steeled myself and climbed in.   
Running on instinct and muscle memory, I quickly passed through and climbed out into a new passageway that continued on for some distance. How deep did this cave go? We were easily hundreds of feet below the earth and it was starting to get quite cold. I shivered, knowing that we would have never gone this deep on the first excursion. I glanced back into the chute and saw Zeke’s blank face as the man struggled through it.  
Struggled was the key word. He was having a lot of difficulty. A light bulb went off in my head. Whoever this monster was, he wasn’t a spelunker. His body type was all wrong for starters; I personally couldn’t believe he’d manage to squeeze through the birth canal at all with those broad shoulders and doing so took him nearly forty minutes when I did it in a quarter that time. It also took him more than an hour to set up those ropes. This freak was a novice at best. This could even be his first time in a cave. That said, he wasn’t letting lack of experience stop him.   
I checked my watch. It was close to 11 now. It would take more than an hour to get back to the surface in my condition, and by then, rain may have started to flood the cave…  
Such worries were pointless because in order to get out I would have to get past him, which was never going to happen because he’d gut me like a fish. There was no telling how much deeper the cave went, but at some point, it would end or become impassable, and then he would reach me. I had to figure out a way to get past him. I took a deep breath and tried to think of a plan.   
There was a loose stone on the ground. I picked it up and weighed it in my hand, a good six or seven pounds. If I lied in ambush by the chute, I might be able to surprise him and strike his head. But it was risky. And if I did manage to kill him, his body could plug the chute and might get stuck, trapping me. Within a few hours I’d be drowned under water.  
I closed my eyes and saw those powerful hands seizing the rock from mine and then beating me to death with it.  
No, I needed a different way. Someway I could trap him or at least get around him and back up through the cave. Once he was behind me, he’d never catch up before I got out. Then I could make a dash for my car in the parking lot. The keys were in my fanny pack.   
A wave of pain struck me and I wobbled on my feet. I put my non-injured hand out and steadied myself. Yeah, fighting was definitely not going to work. I’m 5-9, 140 lbs. soaking wet and beat up. This guy was 6-2 and easily 215 with a knife. I didn’t have a chance in hell head-to-head.  
I stepped forward into the passage and looked around for anything. I rounded a few more turns, ducked under a low overhead and stepped over a pit that dropped into what looked bottomless. This continued on for some time. The path was tricky, and I knew it would hold him up trying to navigate it.  
Eventually I came to a long “hallway” of sorts. At the end was a narrow gap you could shimmy through, but next to it was an impossibly tight mini birth canal. I walked up to the narrow gap and looked through; it went on about fifty feet before opening up. I shimmied through it. It was tight but nothing the big freak couldn’t handle. The wall was crumbly though and a few pebbles landed on my head as I worked my way through.   
Suddenly, I felt the ground shift and the rock screeched. I gasped and pushed through as fast as possible, before spilling out the exit. I glanced back and watched a large stone fall into the gap, but not enough to cover it. The passageway shivered but stabilized. If the freak came through that, with all his weight…  
I turned forward and my heart dropped. I’d reached the end. A complete dead end. Smooth rock stared back at me. It was just a little cramped room, no more than five feet across. This was the end.   
And so, the wait began as I tried to think of a plan. I knew that eventually he would reach me. He was taking his time, being careful, and when he did finally get to me…  
I checked my watch. It was 1pm, an hour past the deadline of our hard return. I’d spent over an hour in this room, racking my brain trying to think of something that could save me. It would probably take two to three hours to return from here, and by then most of this could be underwater. I had to do something.  
At that moment, a light fell on my face. He had finally reached the gap.  
This little rock closet would be my doom. Günther’s severed head flashed in my mind. Then mine…  
I just wanted to see the sun again. Smell fresh air…  
I pounded my left hand against the walls and screamed. The howl bounced around the rock walls and my splitting headache doubled.    
He was looking at me; the harsh light on my face was the dead giveaway. I glanced back into the narrow gap and saw Zeke’s face, watching me blankly as he slowly inched through it. The stainless-steel knife was in his hand. I had maybe another five minutes until he possibly reached the end. Even now, he was stepping over that stone that fell down.   
I sat down and closed my eyes, praying for a miracle.  
I opened my eyes. The other side of the mini birth canal stared back at me. I shakily got to my feet and peered at it. A child couldn’t fit through this. How could I? It made the entrance birth canal look like a bad joke.   
But… if I could get in there and somehow get through before he reached the end of the gap, noticed I was gone and went back the other way, I’d be in front of him…  
I stuck my head in to test it. Maybe it was possible. It had to be. If it didn’t, I was dead. If I didn’t try it, I was dead.  
I pulled my head out and shined the light into it to properly judge the tightness of the passage…   
No. It was impossible. I would never fit. Under the light I could properly see how tight it became. This would be my doom.   
My only option was to try to get around him and back in the gap. When he stepped out, maybe I could dive past him for the gap… throw a stone at him for distraction. It was all I could do.   
And then I heard a screech of rock, followed by a biblical roar.  
I looked into the gap and gaped as I saw stones plummeting behind the man, a cave in. There would be no escape through the gap now.  
He took off wildly towards me in an effort to get out. The mini birth canal, and certain death, was my only option. What would be worse? Being stabbed to death or being stuck until I drowned?   
I had to try to make this squeeze.  
I ripped off my boots, pants, socks, fanny pack, knee and elbow pads and even my shirt.  Nearly everything was cast off, so I’d have a better chance of making the squeeze. Gripping my flashlight and a glowstick in my good hand and my car keys in my bad, I climbed into the mini birth canal in only my underwear and climbing gloves.    
Madness. Utter madness. I got stuck immediately. It was my shoulders. I gritted my teeth and cranked my whole body into the corkscrew. I moved an inch. MORE. I squirmed, wiggled and shoved further. Behind me I heard him exit the gap followed by the pounding of stones. The gap was surely closed off for good. There was no other way out but here.  
I couldn’t see him, but I suddenly felt a hand grab at my foot.   
I screamed and jammed myself harder into the stone. His hand slipped and then he was out of reach.   
I was stuck again. I exhaled fully and tried to move. No dice. I strained and the crushing rock walls clamped down on me. I took one shallow breath and then forcefully exhaled again squeezing every last ounce of air from my lungs. My shoulder found a gap and I pushed forward. I took another shallow breath and exhaled hard again. Little by little I wormed through this impossibly narrow tunnel.   
Until I once again was stuck. I tried the exhale trick but that failed. In fact, now I could barely breathe at all. The corners of my vision started to constrict. The rock walls closed in around me, pushing into me, pressing down on all sides, encasing me fore-  
I bit my tongue hard. Then bit it again even harder and felt blood well up. I pushed it out of my mouth and let the blood dribble down my chin and onto my bare chest. A slight bit of lubrication…  
Gripping the rock in front of me with my outstretched hands, I pulled for all I had and moved again. My head was cranked fully horizontal, and my neck was screaming at me, but I pressed onwards.   
And then I ground to a halt. Once more, I exhaled hard again but no luck. I was surely stuck this time. The rock walls flattened me from all sides. I couldn’t move a muscle.  
I pictured my body, permanently trapped, being found by the first responders. It was bloated from the water and my glassy eyes stared blankly at the four walls of my stone coffin.   
NO. There was one last thing I could try.  
I emptied my bowels.   
I felt the smallest of a gap open up and pulled for everything I had. My ribs clicked, and then I felt my lowest rib break fully. My shoulders cracked. I could feel the bones of my skull compressing. My pelvis bent. My vision shrunk to a tiny dot. The rock strangled me until…  
I fell forward into running water. I gasped for air and erupted into a coughing fit. Finally, it ceased. I looked up into the paralyzing darkness. I grabbed my flashlight, which had fallen in the water before me and clicked it on. It didn’t come on. It had been smashed at some point during my frantic struggle. I felt around in the void and found the glowstick. I cracked it. The passageway was illuminated in eerie green. The air was thick with dust from the cave-in.  I looked at my near naked body; my legs and arms were covered in scrapes and blood from the squeeze. My face and chest had been rubbed raw as well. I shined the glowstick into the water and felt around until I found my car keys.   
A harsh light illuminated me and I glanced back into the mini birth canal. Zeke’s face was watching me.  
He had no chance. He wouldn’t even be able to fit his shoulders into the entrance, let alone get through. I stared at Zeke’s face and then bored my eyes into the Killer’s eyes.  
“This is your tomb now, motherfucker.”   
His eyes, once maniacal, now flashed with fear and then panic.  
I turned my back on him and he began to scream behind me. It was animalistic and wretched.   
The water was rising and quick. I pushed forward, ignoring sharp pricks in my bare feet from the rocks. My breathing was ragged, and each breath made my lowest rib groan. I had to keep going.  
I nearly stepped into the bottomless pit, since it was now invisible under water, but remembered at the last second where it was.  
I reached the chute, now going upwards, and entered. Water was rushing down, hitting my face like a jet. I clambered up. Slipped. Fell. Tailbone exploded in pain. Tried again. This time I found footing and pushed up it. I reached the top and kept going.   
Dizzy, but alive, I eventually reached the cliff I had fallen off. A flood of water was cascading down it. The water was up to my neck now. I was shivering uncontrollably, but I was so close. I grasped the ropes and ascended.   
At some point on the cliff face I blacked out but came to near the top. I couldn’t stop shaking. I climbed over the edge, battling the river of water that was slamming me.   
At last, I reached the ten-by-ten room. The birth canal was an impassable geyser of water, but most was going into the three-foot-high hole. I would have to wait. If I drowned… so be it. Günther’s headless body was facedown in about two inches of water.  
“F-F-Forgive me,” I pulled his jacket off and his pants and boots. I wrung the clothes out, put them on and then grabbed the first aid kit from the little gear bag. I pulled out a trauma blanket, went to the elevated ledge and threw it over me, before passing out.  
Hours later, the geyser stopped. The room was flooded and the entrance to the birth canal was partially underwater. But that wouldn’t stop me.  
I grabbed Günther’s headlamp and made the final trek through the birth canal and out of the cave. At the entrance, I found Zeke’s body. It was bloated from the water and his bloody skull and dangling eyes stared at me as I passed.    
I heaved myself up the ten feet and out into the night air. The entire area was flooded.   
I stumbled to the parking lot, opened my car door and drove away…  
First responders were incapable of getting through the birth canal safely. But Kyle, who arrived two days after this happened, was a cop, and he assembled a few local spelunkers to make the recovery. They went down there with all the gear… and a pistol, just in case.   
They were able to get Günther’s body out of the cave via ropes, pulleys and lubricants. His head was not found.    
Kyle and the crew, needing to confirm my story that I gave from the hospital, headed deeper into the cave. They reached the bottom and peered into the mini birth canal.  
The waterlogged body of the freak was wedged inside. Forever stuck.  
They said it looked like he’d broken both of his shoulders trying to squeeze through it. And he was still wearing Zeke’s face.
