TW: Child abuse

The attacks of the animals came next, like the plagues God had sent to Egypt in the bible. Ambiguously nasty-looking insects attacked the townspeople, and rats were found stashed inside dark places in the houses. All were rabid, attacking people and devouring their food. There were wild dogs too, galloping into the town in packs, who would snap and bite adults, but sit and allow the children to stroke and even ride them. Meanwhile, whenever any of our Simulation Kids neared these animals, they would freeze in what seemed to be shock, or fear, for a few seconds, before turning tail and scampering away.

We all agreed that these events were not a simple coincidence. The dreams, Ron’s suicide, the animals. It all had a sort of common theme; the children. The normal children were safe, their dreams pleasant and no harm coming to them, while the Trio, *our children*, were feared, an element of the unknown which frightened whatever we were dealing with.

Being the sort that we were, it was obvious to us that this was some kind of spirit. Researching the beliefs of the Natives who had lived in this area, we discovered the tribe that lived on the land had worshipped a wide variety of gods, who were more spirits that symbolised and stood for specific elements of life or nature, not quite personifications, but more guardians of these aspects.

One which stood out for us was the Warrior Mother, an entity who represented what the Natives observed as the fierce, protective nature of women for their children. There were several legends of this spirit appearing as a savage 10-foot tall giantess and killing members of rival tribes who had killed children. In other tales, one recorded in the diary of a Christian missionary, natives said that the crows who ripped apart another of his congregation were sent by her to avenge the young children he had been sexually abusing during their visit.

The connections were harrowing, and at this point it had been brought up in team discussions that it might be a good idea to abandon the project. Had we really achieved that much in the time we’d been here? Was it really worth endangering and torturing these people for god knew how much longer?

“No, no, I don’t want any of that, alright?” Josh, by this time, looked like a madman. He’d been deteriorating since that party, as if that bitch he’d chosen to go with had somehow sucked out his soul. “The show must go on.”

It was getting irritating at this point, it did nothing more than dampen everyone’s mood and certainly did not work wonders on our morale as it once had.

In the end we decided to communicate with our enemy. We had a guy for this sort of thing, a real eccentric everyone called Mister Zap. He was tall, with dark skin, and a soft, soothing British accent. He set up in the basement of our headquarters, where he said he could ‘feel the currents the strongest’ (an odd gentleman, as I’ve mentioned), took some speed, and meditated, drifting off to sleep with a quaint smile on his face. All of us watched, yet again holding our breath in anticipation for something we only dared to truly believe in.

Afterwards, his eyes snapped open, and he began to purposefully stride around the chalk circle he had drawn for himself.

“One of these.” He said, curtly. His voice was a lighter pitch than it usually was, but at the same time more assertive. “Be quick, I dislike these arrangements. You are the ones with the odd children and the fake settlement, correct?”

“Yes. We’d like to ask why you’ve been attacking us?”

“Because you are an affront to all I am meant to represent. I know what you have done to children previously. All children of the world are mine. All of them. And while my reach does not expand to beyond this place, I will not allow you to victimise them here.”

“None of the children here have been-”

“You have caused turmoil to the children who were brought here, none have had enough sleep and all are tired from having to do the same thing every day.”

“We’re doing a job here…er, ma’am.”

He snorted harshly. “Do not address me as anything of your modern world. The matron spirit need not be a woman nor a man.” His face then twisted into a frown, eyebrows packing in together darkly. “I dislike the treatment of children in your settlement, yes…but naught affronts me more than your…activities on my land.”

“The children?”

“Yes. You aim to create your own shamans I gather? For the service of your rulers? They disturb me. All children in the world, all children of all nations, they are mine, as I have said.” He shivered. “But those things are not mine. And they are certainly not yours. I will not allow them to live here any longer.”

“Well, should we move them then?”

“No.” He smiled without humour, raising his chin authoritatively. “You will kill all three of them. If you have not done this in three days, or if you try to move them elsewhere, a great storm will sweep through this place and take with it all you have built, killing every man and woman foreign in blood to this land. This is my final ultimatum.”

Mister Zap returned, and the spirit was gone.

Over the next few days, it was broadcast on TV that there were sudden and unexplained signs that sometime soon, a devastating storm would sweep through our area. The winds were high, so powerful that mailboxes got sent flying from the ground, and people were told to stay inside. The animals continued their erratic behaviour, squirrels jumping down onto people from trees and birds flying headfirst into and splatting all over windows.

Among all the chaos, we had lost four citizens of Bleekerville on the first day after our ritual, all of them children and amongst them our three subjects. The group had gone missing suddenly, sneaking out of the house at night, while the other had gone missing early in the morning on his way to school.

We had the whole town on the manhunt in the surrounding area, which, due to the current nature of the animals and the weather, was extremely treacherous. Eventually, they found the Three, who had been sleeping in a small den in a bit of wood where no animals lived. They had the other kid with them, who had apparently been forced to do all sorts of unpleasant things for them, including seeing how long he could hold his breath for, how many times he’d have to head butt something for before he went unconscious, and what they were even planning on surveying before they were found was how long the poor kid could go without sleep. He looked battered when he was recovered, and taken back to his home. When we asked why he’d agreed to do all this, he told them that he hadn’t, not initially.

He said that when he refused their demands, the Trio would close their eyes, and give him ‘Nightmares’. This, at least, was a sign that they were developing as we wanted, but not in a way which we could control.

We didn’t know what to do about them. After this incident, we’d placed them firmly under our surveillance in the headquarters, telling everyone in the town to get back home. All three looked somewhat bashful, but by no means guilty. Eric, as usual, looked quite pleased with himself, and even proudly showed us his notebook in which he had been recording all of their prisoner’s ‘statistics’. The team stayed in the briefing room for almost 5 hours, arguing back and forth over what had to be done.

During most of this time, Josh sat with his head in his hands, hair tousled up and eyes rimmed with red. There was something beyond natural disturbance going on with him, and everyone knew it. He’d take to pacing around when it got quiet, muttering the same five words himself. “The show must go on.” It was around then that I could never imagine being so rallied and emboldened by such a cheesy, clunky phrase. He had lost all of his charisma. He only spoke once, and, uncharacteristically, it was to suggest the course of action that the spirit had demanded.

The sun went down on the second day since we spoke with the spirit, and the winds only blew stronger. In the night, Eric had asked to go to the toilet every hour, and had clogged up the toilet with so much toilet paper that the plumbers were still cleaning them out by mid-day.

That day was grim. Everybody knew what had to happen. Everybody knew the decision we were going to have to make, but nobody wanted to. It was deathly silent in all of our offices, and every glance at the clock made our stomachs churn.

I decided that morning that I was going to quit. I had had enough, I was no longer passionate about what we were trying to do, I never was, and I could not for the life of me even begin to imagine seeing any semblance of significant success in the future. I strode to Josh’s office to tell him this, and I found him staring into space in front of him, an accumulation of sleep and crust layering his twitching eyelids. When I arrived there, he didn’t even let me begin, just looked up at me with irritation.

“You jealous it wasn’t you?” He croaked.

“What?” I said, genuinely confused.

“At the party. You could smell that stink eye you were giving Lisa from a mile away.” He said. “Come to bitch about that or something?”

“N-no.” I said, offended. “I’ve come to tell you that I want to…to tell you that I’m quitting.”

He stared blankly for a moment, like a fish.

“Shame.” He said after a while. “I did that to get to you, y’know? Make you jealous? Usually works with birds.”

“What the hell is wrong with you Josh?” I asked, appalled. This version of him was foreign to me.

Ignoring me, he continued with a lacklustre drawl. “Right. So. Quitting? Why on earth would you want to do that? The dead kids only just become too much for you because god said it's wrong? I don’t find that to be too much of a deal-breaker personally.” He paused for a moment, then continued with subdued fury. “You want to leave, do you? You think you can? You think you’ll ever be able to leave any of this behind? You want to take what you give us away, huh? No. No, alright, no, damn it. Stop me if you’ve heard this one before but the show-”

“Shut up! Please!” I cried at him.

He sank back, his emotions going from 100 to 0 in a second, tracking his journey from standing up with his fists clenched, to flopped back down on his chair, hopeless. “Go then. Go.” He said listlessly. “But just know for the rest of your life, it’ll be ‘we’.”

“What the hell are you talking about?” I sighed, tears in my eyes.

He smiled then, with a certain glint in his eye that I almost recognised as the old him. “You know, Kate. You know. It’ll always be us. We’re an entity, now, I suppose. All a part of one body. A body I’m beginning to think doesn’t know what to do with itself.”

Then, Abigail Meline came in. She was crying, and she apparently needed to speak to Josh. He sat bolt upright when she came in, suddenly attentive. He hadn’t degraded to the point of showing it to the townsfolk just yet. I felt compelled, again, to comfort her, and tried to coax her into stringing together a coherent sentence, however the closest I could get was “oh god I’m a horrible person.”

After a while, it seemed like this wasn’t working, so I tried something different.

“Alright, honey, why don’t you start from the beginning?” I said. Josh nodded to her, encouraging.

Shaky, Abigail nodded. She started telling us, her story occasionally broken by snorts and sniffles, about how about a week ago Dennis started asking uncomfortable questions to her. “Why don’t I have any brothers or sisters?” He’d ask. She initially shooed him away, though later on, he’d started saying other things.

“Why do you hate me, mommy? Why don’t you like children?” She described how she’d got a lump so large in her throat when he asked that she almost couldn’t answer. Abigail had always seen children as irritating, and a disadvantage to life, as well as thinking it inhumane to bring other people into this world. While she was telling us this part, me and Josh shared a look of guilt. She seemed to have lived under our regime so long that she’d forgotten it was us who made her have a child originally. She told us, in an almost confession-like manner, how she really had come to love Dennis, despite how strange a child he was. This only made her seem more distressed.

However, then she started having dreams that she described as similar to the one I had of the dead children, only in her’s, she was throwing the bodies into the pit herself. She said she didn’t sleep for several days, just so she didn’t have to see that. After not sleeping for at least three days, she began to think that it was somehow Dennis’ fault. Whatever we were doing to him was giving him the power to affect her dreams. Later that day, she said that she thought she heard a bird talking to her.

“Killer.” It said in a cold and arrogant voice, a woman’s voice, she said.

She started breaking down properly at this point. “I was only 15” was all she could say. My heart sank for her. The spirit was fiercely vengeful of children to a degree we had not anticipated.

Then, Dennis came into her room one night. He told her that he’d been speaking with his sister. Dennis told Abigail about his nameless, jealous sister, who’d been calling him names, and putting his stuff in the wrong places. “She’s annoyed mom. She’s annoyed you gave me a chance and she didn’t get one.” Dennis was crying, shouting at his mother. “Why did you kill her mom?” 

Abigail had grabbed a belt on the bed beside her and struck Dennis three times, screaming in rage.

“Oh god, I’m sorry. Please, please stop, I don’t deserve any help. I’m a horrible person.” Was all she said after that.

Josh was staring into space again when she finished. He’d then taken her to see Dennis in his cell, watching sadly from the doorway as she hugged him tightly.

Night fell like a corpse shroud, and we heard the storm approaching from beyond our walls. We’d sort of accepted it. Maybe if we all just stayed here, it would destroy us too, this old god wiping all evidence of our blasphemy from the earth so our gods would not learn of it. Maybe that was for the best.

We got messages from the townsfolk, who said that they were trying to evacuate, but the roads were all blocked somehow. We didn’t respond to them.

Later that night, Trevor the guard, who patrolled the dark halls past his shift for that night, found Eric in one of our offices, highly classified files spread out around him like comic books on a bedroom floor. He was studying one closely.

“The hell are you doing you little runt?” Said Trevor.

“I’m learning how to write reports. For my research.” Eric said. He had not been surprised by Trevor, judging by how in the surveillance footage he barely moved a muscle.

Trevor had never tolerated anyone he was allowed to bully disobeying him, and it was a hell of a day to break this pattern. “Get off your ass and go back to your cell you little freak.”

Eric put down the file and sighed, then stood up, hands on his head and his eyes closed. “Okay. But I’ll only go if you get me a glass of water.”

“What?” 

“Go and get me a glass of water. And walk like a chicken while you're doing it.”

“The fuck did you just say to-” But it was too late, Trevor was already turning on his heels and bopping his head out in front of him, hands tucked into his armpits with his elbows flapping at his sides. “Cluck cluck.” He said, eyes glazed over, as he disappeared back into the dark corridors.

Eric chuckled to himself as he sat down and began to read the file again. It was a good one, all about this weird living ball the organisation had been given which evolved whenever they did anything to it, so they had to find new ways of opening each time.

He was reading about how they’d put children in there for experiments when he stopped. He could hear someone behind him. He stood up, and turned around to see the glint of something metal in the darkness, alongside the menacing shape of a man approaching him. A farmiliar man, a man he knew to be great.

Eric had seen Trevor coming, he had seen everything that had happened so far, the man who stood in front of the car, the storm, him and his friends getting taken here, he’d been able to anticipate what would happen next his whole life. But whatever was in the dark, he had not seen yet. And he could not see what would happen next. His voice, usually self-assured and callous, hitched in his throat as he stammered out to the figure. “W-who’s there?”

When Trevor had come to, he had hobbled to and from the water dispenser, carrying a paper cup perfectly balanced in his jutted out mouth. When Trevor came to from hypnosis, he dropped the paper cup on the floor and let it spill. When Trevor came to, he saw Josh Bleeker holding a pistol to Eric’s head.

“Josh?” He asked, utterly bewildered.

*Bang.*

“The show must go on.” Josh said sadly, shoulders sagging.

*Bang.*

In his cell at that moment, Louis, who was sitting on the floor savouring a cockroach that had crawled from between the walls, suddenly began to feel something against his forehead, a kind of pressure. It was like the feeling of the oncoming march of sleep, only it slowly became more painful until he was wriggling on the floor, gritting his teeth. Then, the pressure came to a peak, whatever force was trying to get in his head had finally found a nice, soft part. The inside of his head exploded as the pressure ripped through it, coming out the other side and making a large dent in the wall behind him. Louis did not feel pain for long after the force was tickling around his head, but the few seconds before he died were excruciating. Dennis was sleeping when it came for him, the first time he had dreamed in his life, about his sister hugging him, telling him she was sorry, and he felt nothing. The storm outside abruptly resided.

The next day was the most horrible of all, but simultaneously the easiest. All of my burdens had been relieved. All three of our subjects had died, alongside Josh. What was slightly more messy was Bleekerville. Swathes of the identical houses had been splintered and scattered all across the surrounding area by the winds, one struck by lightning and had been transformed from a tame suburban home to what might look like an industrial factory from afar, metallic black and bellowing smoke into the sky. Cars had been thrown up in the air as families attempted to escape, and had been lodged into the branches of trees, or carried into street lights and smashed in half.

Half of the population had died that night, crushed and battered by the detritus swirling around them. Among them, Abigail Meline and her husband, as well as Louis’ parents, and Mrs O’Leary. Mr O’Leary had to be torn from her body, thrashing and beating his fists weakly at the recovery team. He was never told what happened to Eric and died only a few months later in a drunken fight. Those who survived were given all they were promised, and those who did not were buried in the same town graveyard, which until then had been full of the hollow graves of imaginary people. Among the dead there were no children, who had all been miraculously protected from any kind of harm during the storm. All of them, even the ones who had lost their parents, came out of the experience with no substantial sign of mental trauma, and all of their memories of the town completely vanished quickly afterwards.

And that was that really. The whole team made it, in the end, and since this had dismally failed, it was back to the drawing board. That veiny headed freak who suggested this eats lunch alone again, and he barely speaks during team meetings. We got a new director, some slimy old fat man who perpetually wears black-tinted glasses.

Apparently, they’re going to start sending us children again soon.

I did not quit. Josh was right, I couldn’t. I had one foot in already, all I could do now was place the other in.

And so I did, I have continued to work in this department until the present, continuing to help terrorise innocents for no sensible reason. Because at this point, what else can I do?

We will continue, as long as the government pays us, as long as there are childhoods to be ruined and as long as there are mysteries to scratch the surface of then run away from what was seen beneath the scar.

The show must go on.
