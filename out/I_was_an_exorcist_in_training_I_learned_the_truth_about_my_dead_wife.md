“Matthew?”

I heard Sofia’s voice even more distinctly this time. I was sprinting toward her now as she called my name again and again. The wind in the hallway grew warm, then disappeared, then blew again even hotter, as if some great beast was breathing in the distance.

Finally, the hallway ended, terminating in a large chamber built of ancient bricks, all coated in a sheen of wet. Were the rocks themselves sweating? Numerous grates lined the stone floor, the hot air wafting up from them and heating my feet through my shoes. 

In the center of the room, in a cage of silver crosses tarnished from years of neglect, sat Sofia. 

“Matthew?” she asked. “Is it really you?”

She looked beautiful, better than I remembered. She wore a red silk robe that did nothing to hide her form, and I couldn’t help watching the way it fell over her body. 

She certainly looked better than she’d looked on the slab at the morgue the last time I’d seen her, her face bloodied from slamming against the steering wheel, her neck bent at an impossible angle.

I knew what I was seeing was impossible. And yet, for a brief moment, just a second, I wanted it so badly to be true that I let myself believe it was.

“Come to me, my love,” she said. “There must be some way for you to get me out of here.”

I found myself looking around for a rock, a crowbar, some forgotten piece of metal I would use to smash her cage to pieces. As I looked, we both heard footsteps, fast approaching down the hall.

“Never mind that,” she said. “Just come closer. Kiss me through the cage. Let me taste your lips just one more time.”

I hesitated now. There was something different about her skin. It was rippling a bit with a silver sheen. My desire began to mix with fear. I imagined pressing my lips through a hole in the cage only for her to bite them off. I imagined the blood running down my face as she cackled, my flesh dangling from her lips. 

“Now,” she said, and her voice was lower than before. I lifted my right foot from its place on the ground, preparing to step toward her. As I did, she shrugged off the silk dress, revealing her naked body. I felt myself harden in a way I hadn’t in years, since she’d died, and I’d given myself to god. Careful not to touch the silver cage, she moved closer to me, just barely not touching the metal. 

“Come,” she said.

I lowered my foot to the ground.

“The scar,” I said after a moment. “The burn on your shoulder. It’s not there anymore.”

“I’m whole now,” she said. “I’m perfect.”

“You’re not her,” I said, tears pouring down my face, and as I spoke the words, her skin began to shimmer silver, and I saw her for what she was: a woman wrapped head to toe in roughly-made sacks. The bags were made of coarse cloth with silver threaded through, and bound tightly at the neck, wrists and ankles with thicker silver rope.

Before I could speak another word, she lunged forward, lurching against the side of the cage. There was a sizzling sound from where she threw her shoulder against the metal, and she screamed in pain, her voice more like a chorus than a single woman’s howl.

I staggered back and fell on the slick, wet ground. 

“You see it, then, for what it is?” asked Cardinal Robles, approaching from behind me.

I nodded.

“She has had many names, but she’s known mostly as Abyzou,” said Cardinal Robles.

“You can call me Abby if you like,” said the thing in the cage. She had retreated to the center now, away from the lattice of silver crosses. “Since we’re so close and all. We were just about to have a little moment, weren’t we Matty?”

“You don’t know a thing about me,” I said, but she started laughing. Then she held up her hand, which was bound inside the cloth bag. She pulled at it with her opposite hand, revealing the outline of a missing finger.

“They didn’t get all of me in here,” she said. “There was a piece I’d left out in the world. Ask them where I left it, Matty. Ask them where it was. How do you think I’ve been calling to you all this time? How do you think I know you so well?”

I looked over at Cardinal Robles, who slowly nodded. 

“There’s much to explain, but not here.” He looked agitated. Walking over to a small hole in the wall, he shouted down, his voice echoing. “Tell someone that the fucking holy water needs a fresh blessing!” Then he smiled again and turned back to me.

“Natural hot springs,” he said, gesturing to the vents. “You bless the water, and voila! Keeps them nice and docile, most of the time. Now, come on. Before she tries to dress up like your high school crush and gets you worked up all over again.”

Slowly, I backed away, following the Cardinal out of the room. The whole time, the demons eyes didn’t leave me. Beneath the bag covering her head, I saw her tongue poking out, forming a small wet spot.

“See you again soon,” she said. “Sooner than you think.”

And when she said the words, I believed her, and I was terrified. Because for the first time, I truly believed a demon had seen my soul and known the weak places in it. Because I knew I was imperfect.

Abyzou called after us as we ascended through the dreary maze. At first it was my name, over and over again. Then it became more of a guttural moan, some sort of cross between pleasure and pain. Even knowing what she was, it took everything in me not to turn back and run to her.

“You’re trembling, Father Matthew,” said Cardinal Robles. “But is it your body or your faith that’s shaking?”

“I’ll be fine,” I said, still unable to control the palsy. I was still trying to digest everything the demon had said. “Is it true?” I finally asked. “That she left a piece of herself somewhere? What did she mean?”

“Search your heart,” he said.

About a year into our marriage, I woke to find Sofia missing from bed. I got up and walked down the hall. The house was utterly silent. Then, beneath the silence, I heard a sharp intake of breath, the sound you make when you’re doing everything in your power not to cry out. 

Coming down the stairs, I saw a light on in Sofia’s sewing room. I heard the sound again, and I called Sofia’s name, but there was no response.

Finally, I came to the doorway of the room and looked inside. There sat my wife, a half-finished quilt on her lap. I recognized it as one she’d been working on earlier that day, a blue and white pattern inspired by old Dutch delftware. Except now, a deep red had soaked through.

“Sofia?” I asked, but she didn’t respond. She was doing something with her left hand, picking at it maybe? Pressing something? I took a step forward. She inhaled, gritting her teeth, trying not to scream.

Then I saw the needle. It was a large one, perhaps four or five inches long. She had inserted the pointed end into the palm of her hand and was pressing on it now, pushing it deeper and deeper into the skin. As I watched, she pushed with all of her strength, and the needle made a tent of the flesh on the opposite side of her hand before finally piercing through, the blood blooming red around it.

She sighed in relief now, tears coming to her eyes.

“Sofia!” I screamed, running to her, and something seemed to flash on in her eyes. “What are you doing?” 

“I got three stitches wrong,” she said quietly. “Three in a row. I had to punish myself.”

“We need to call a doctor,” I said. 

She was crying now.

“There’s something wrong inside me,” she said. “Something it left behind. It won’t come out. It’s been there so long, it’s all tangled up. It’s a part of me now, forever and ever.”

I was still looking at the needle, trying to decide if I should pull it out, or wrap it in cloth before I called 911. 

“They thought they got it out, but they didn’t,” she said. “Not all of it.”

I was nearly hyperventilating as we continued our ascent. The memory of the needle had flooded through my mind all at once. Of course, Sofia had many such episodes. It wasn’t exactly that I’d forgotten them, but they were compartmentalized, kept separate from the Sofia I wanted to remember. 

At the same time, I was well aware that Sofia had been possessed once, and that it had left its scars on her forever after. If I’m being honest, half the reason I joined the clergy was to exact some measure of revenge on the demons that had hurt her.

“Wait,” I said. “So you’re saying that demon… that was the one who–”

“Abyzou possessed your wife when she was a young girl,” said the Cardinal. “We sent two of our best exorcists. At first, the demon fought to stay in. Then, just before they could perform the ritual of binding, the demon escaped back to Hell. Apparently, she left a bit of herself behind inside your wife.” He wiggled a pinky in explanation. I thought of the thing in the cage, the missing finger under the cloth bag.

“After that, Abyzou possessed another girl in South Korea,” he went on. “Then a young mother in Australia, a grandmother in Spain. She would use their flesh to fulfill certain desires before… discarding the bodies. She moved quickly. In each of those cases, we couldn’t catch her fast enough. Our priests arrived to find corpses. Finally, she grew bold and tried to possess a nun in Milan. That time, I went personally and bound her before the demon could escape. Now Abyzou remains in the nun’s body, caged up as you saw her. She won’t hurt another soul.”

As he spoke the last words, he opened a door, and we entered a light-filled room where the air no longer smelled of sweat. For the first time in hours, I felt I could breathe.

“Now you understand, I hope, the need for what we do,” he said. 

I nodded weakly.

“The question is,” he said. “Now that you know everything, do you want to join us?”

I nodded again, but with more confidence this time.

“I want to catch as many of these bastards as we can,” I said. “I want to fill this [dungeon](https://www.reddit.com/r/scarymaxx/comments/zwo5o8/welcome_to_the_world_of_scarymaxx/).”
