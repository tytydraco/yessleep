It's been almost two years now, since that day on the 10 August 2021. Or should I say, the night between 9-10. I used to attend a school which I'll call 'Rambling Dreams', as I'm too afraid to say what its' real name is. I graduated that school December of last year. I'll call myself 'Crab' in this tale.

I've always had strange dreams. Once I dreamt that I passed a golden retriever in the car, and then passed a specific looking-green oval with a circle of brown grass in the middle. Years passed, and I did those things, golden retriever and all. I thought it was funny, but I wasn't laughing that night.

The dream on the 9-10th was strange, obviously. Me and my teacher were alone, on the younger kids' grade school playground, the same playground I loved playing on when I attended the primary school. She was telling me all about \[**REDACTED**\], a female 18-year old student who had died in a motorcycle crash on a weekend in February of 2020. I was listening, and scared. My dreams were usually crazy, (e.g, I had a dream I was forced to make out with an alpaca to earn my living), and this dream was eerily monotone.

The sky around the playground was dreary, a blank grey with a strong cloud cover. The normally drowning noise of the kids was not heard whatsoever. It was like they had all died.

"Crab, this student was not known for being under any influence whatsoever, but on this day she apparently had a few pints too many and was drunk when she crashed her motorcycle into smithereens," Teacher said. I was sick. I knew I was dreaming, but I am not a lucid dreamer, nor someone who can stop their dreams at will. I remember all the dialogue, still to this day.

"That's terrible." I found myself, or my dream-self, saying. I wanted to get out.

It was like there was a massive tarantula on me, but that tarantula was the fear of dreaming again the next night. I hate death, and things mentioning death. I hated when my dreams mentioned death. The  dream felt all too real. I could feel my throat catching, and my tongue felt like something diseased. I felt squeamish and decidedly not in control. My hands were cold and shaking, and my heart was pumping in my dream-self's chest.

"Yes, it was. I wonder if the same thing will... happen to you." Teach mumbled insidiously. I felt like something had just been predicted. *That's stupid.* I thought to myself. I could think my own thoughts, but I couldn't control my movements. I was trapped, like I was in a nightmare rather than a dream. That's what it felt like.

Suddenly I was teleported out of the playground. Back to the room, my old room I used to share with my sister. I had woken up; it was a Tuesday, a school day. I was afraid to look my teacher in the eye. I worked hard, but I wasn't putting in any real focus. It was like I was a scared zombie, but I was in control.

That day, I decided, I was going to google \[**REDACTED**\]'s name. It was silly to presume that my dreams were real, I thought, but I should still google her name. Maybe that would free the doubts I had.

I worked up the courage to start typing on my phone and the first thing that came up was her name in all lowercase, followed by 'car crash'. I clicked on that.

It couldn't be real... could it?

And there it was. My local news station's online website with an article headline reading, '18-year-old girl tragically killed in a motorcycle-car manslaughter'. *No.* I thought. There was no way this student was real... right?

But the report said otherwise. Listed off \[**REDACTED**\]'s college hopes, an interview with her older brother, some photographs of the scene and of her, and then at the end, a formal notice from the lawyer of the guy who killed her. I was in shock. I had planned to see if it was real or not, do some quick scrolling, but it was truly something that had happened.

I remembered I needed to get home quickly, and hopped into my car. I tried to come up with logical explanations for it. I didn't hear about the case or even know her name before the dream. I didn't dream the last 7-or-so minutes. I didn't-

And then I saw it. *HER. \[****REDACTED****\].*

She's on a motorcycle, cheerfully, with a can of who-knows in her hand. Doesn't even notice me as she drives fast as the limit will allow... actually, faster. And we're about to crash, when suddenly a freaking minivan swerves in front of us and snaps me out of it. Dazed, I turn left, even though I know that's not the right way home and I'm not going to get home by my curfew-of-sorts. Once I'm sure I'm safe, I turn around.

She's not there.

*What the fuck.* I think to myself. And I've just realised as I'm typing this out that I've just relived the entire encounter and typed in present tense. But as much of a burden as this horrific experience is, I will live to tell it to you, Reddit.
