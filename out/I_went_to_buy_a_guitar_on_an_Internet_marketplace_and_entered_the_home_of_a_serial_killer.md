I am a troubled artist.



Starving and stupid, my soliloquy serves as a stark warning; not superfluous by any stretch of the imagination, for in the Internet exist man-made horrors beyond human comprehension. My tale of terror took a trembling turn two hours ago, when I stumbled into a dark, damp dwelling deep into a rural suburb of my city. 



Ah, context. Yes, you, the reader, considering that you’re consuming this letter with no knowledge of my name, need context. You may be wondering why I’m sending this to you, or who I am, and that’s okay. You don’t have to know my name, I only need you to understand my story and take it to whatever authorities you need to take it to. In time the truth will come out, yet the lives of the innocent victims shall never be returned to them, but it’s best now to nip it in the bud; to starve this beast of which I have been bellowing about internally for two hours. 



I am Logan. I am a guitarist in a rock and roll band named Fire Kittens, and we were on the verge of making it big time. Talent directors decided that indeed, our work was derivative, but detractors were few and far between; we had developed a damn nice fanbase in our small West Virginia town, and our tones were teetering on the brink of amazing. We made the kids dance; rancid and sweaty, our seemingly simple songs became anthems for a generation of youngins in the rambunctious region, but image is the essence of showbiz, and our desaturated schemes were ultimately considered too boring to sign a deal with the regional record label that had recorded our EP and expressed interest in a contractual obligation. 



Riverrat Records, those bloody bastards, banished our chances at superstar success, so I set out on a simple search; I was determined to discover a new look for myself and for the band. I needed a gimmick, and god dammit, a Gibson wouldn’t do it. I would’ve loved to have found a luthier looking to let go of a lick-making machine for a decent price, but my twisted fate would disagree with my requests.



I loaded up CurbAlert, a modern day, multifarious marketplace, and mobilized myself in search of what would actualize itself to be a murderous merchant. Plummeting through posts of pet rocks and half-eaten sandwiches, I found her. She was beautiful, and I envisioned myself holding her in my hands as I peeked out into the crazy crowd calling my name. Narcissism is in the blood, and I knew that this would put me over the top. 



She was a handcrafted guitar; off-white in color, the body rakishly resembled repulsively realistic human femur bones welded together, their bulbous edges shining in the photo’s ring lighting, and six imitation teeth were tacked onto the tiny headstock. Decorated with round knobs resembling the casing of a retina, the guitar was a horror hound’s wet dream, its realistic appearance akin to a Tom Savini special effect. 



I had to have it, and I composed a correspondence to the luthier. His email address was [tremoloterror88](mailto:tremoloterror88@gmail.com)@protonmail.com, and I felt a cold chill while my chattering fingers were typing at blazing speeds. The email read as follows:



“tremoloterror88, 

I am a guitarist for local band Fire Kittens. We play shows at area bars, and I’m looking for a new guitar to spice up my image. I’m interested in purchasing the guitar from you and would like to work out some sort of deal. I’m strapped for cash, but we can make other arrangements.



Thanks, 

Logan” 



With a swift stroke, I sent the email to tremoloterror88 and while I eagerly awaited a response, I wrote a few riffs for the album that we were working on. Within minutes, I received a response from the seller, and we agreed to meet up in the following hour to complete our eleven-hundred dollar exchange. 



I hopped into my hollowed out cargo van, painted jet black with rimless wheels and a skull with crossbones spray-painted on the side panels. A couple of fuzzy red dice were hanging from the rear view mirror, which was broken and dangly, and the booze stains which had been simmering in the summer heat had a sour smell. Crusty it was, but it was a tour van, a veteran of a very chaotic Rust Belt tour. We visited seven cities and played sixteen shows, while severing any semblance of self-respect; bar girls are boisterous, yet a bandmate must do what must be done. 



Driving across Pilgrim Boulevard, I realized that the GPS on my Samsung phone was taking me to a place I had never been. Our home base wasn’t exactly small, but it wasn’t exactly large either, and living here for the entire duration of my life had led me to believe that I had driven every ruined road in the greater metropolitan area. 



The GPS had directed me towards a strange neighborhood; a homeowners association ran the unincorporated town, and they kept a very strict appearance code. Lawns were to be no more than two inches in height, houses were to be pastel colors only, and there was no tolerance for yard junk. Cleanliness was the standard in the neighborhood of Green Hills, and the homeowners association enforced their rules with an iron fist. 



As a natural societal outcast and general asshole, I was no stranger to feeling like a stranger. A dangerous misfit, I had refused the working world and instead chose to chase my own dream, but that day the reality of my burned out fantasy struck me like an open G chord. I saw his neighbors, and they stared with unease, their bush trimmers in hand and riding lawnmowers moving. I wanted to finish my purchase and get out of dodge before a boomer with a bush trimmer toppled me. Surely they were worried about their property values being lowered by my matte-black van touching the road adjacent to their driveways. 



I pulled up to the destination, a light pink cottage with a yellow door and white shingles, the freshly-mowed lawn glistening in the fiery autumn sun. 1996 Dora Drive was the address, and as I emerged from my emission-machine, I was greeted by a man not much older than me. He wore a pink polo shirt with straight khaki chinos, perfectly contoured to his long legs, and a pair of penny loafers, an unusual choice in 2024. 



“Nice to meet you,” proclaimed the man, who I assumed to be tremoloterror88. “I’m Mark from CurbAlert.”



He stuck his hand out for a handshake before wincing as I grabbed his hand, his assumption being that I was dirty because of my appearance; my long hair, beard, and band tees created a crusty caricature, and his cordial demeanor demonstrated his societal value. He was a corporate man, it seemed. 



“Yeah, good to meet you too,” I replied, suspicious of what I was getting myself into. It’s true that his kind was not my kind, and despite the best attempts by the world to condition me to love, I stuck to what I knew. I didn’t know anything about the corporate world, nor did I ever want to. All I needed was booze and bud to make me happy in the evenings, but come morning time I was a grouchy old geezer. 



“Come on in,” said Mark. “But don’t be alarmed by my decorations.” 



As a horror fanatic, I had seen it all before, so I told him that I wouldn’t be bothered. I just wanted to get that guitar and go become a superstar. He motioned for me to come inside, and opened the door in front of me, where a foul odor hit me like a dump truck running into a nitroglycerin plant, the aroma of death and decay wafting through the air. Normal on the outside, I immediately noticed that this was not a normal house on the inside. No, this was something far more fatal.



As the door locked behind me, I noticed a tapestry of human flesh on the wall, which was adorned with bones of animals and people alike. Skulls topped the lampshades, creating a damning darkness and a feeling of dread filled the room. I continued looking around, trying to examine all of the unique artifacts I was seeing for the first time. The smells of rotting flesh were nauseating, and as I looked around I started to feel uneasy. Did I really need this guitar? At what cost was this terrifying transaction?



“I dunno man, I think I should be going,” I proclaimed while holding back vials of vomit. The silence pierced my ears like a needle gun, and I turned around. Mark was gone. I was alone in this dwelling of death and demise, my unwise choices leading to a lair in which I could’ve been trapped forever. 



With confusion and disgust sweeping over me, the whirlwind of emotions grew more sinister as they rapidly switched back and forth in this macabre miniature mansion. I nearly vomited again at the stench of sliced skin hanging from the ceiling and walls, and in a feeble attempt to escape back to the world which I had hated for so long, I used every muscle in my body to pull at the door to no avail. It was locked from the outside, and even the strongest bodybuilder in the universe would look like a soft schoolgirl trying to escape the clutches of Mark’s domain. 



A static emerged from the walls, a faint whisper of feedback from a system of speakers. It was Mark. 



“I guess I should’ve told you before you got here, but I’m a bad host,” said Mark, his devious grin evident in the tone of his sarcastic voice. He let out a brief laughter before the transmission terminated and the static resumed. I glanced around the room in utter disgust, and the broadcast came back again. 



“I forgot to tell you… you can leave, but… you’ll have to find me first. Have fun.”



In some sort of terribly twisted maze, I found myself in a real life escape room with a menacing eye watching over me like that 1980s pop song. Cameras hidden in craniums must have been watching me, as I could feel Mark’s presence everywhere inside the shadowy shack. I had no other option. Powerless and even more helpless, I had to play along with his evil experiment, and so I creeped through the kitchen doorway, spreading seven strings hanging with stacks of teeth so yellow and rotten. Cavities decorated the dental disasters, and their genuine germiness reminded me of my own golden woes. 



I was in the kitchen, its checkered, bloodstained floor and aggressive aromatics attacking my nasal cavities. Crude paintings on caucasian canvases of stretched skin lined the urine-yellow walls, a dehydrated dye resembling the Backrooms. Cryptids covered these canvases: the Moth Man, Slender Man, and the Flatwoods Monster mirrored my now emotionless expression. Hiding my horrified feelings, I adopted a straight face as a defense mechanism, wondering when I was going to find Mark and embark on an escape and maintain my silence.



In a crescendo of curiosity, I crept to the fridge and cracked it open, revealing a row of thick, dark steaks wrapped in plastic and a sealed jar of a human brain with pickled pink ridges. The cabinets contained cups made from hollowed out femurs and bowls made from the brain’s defense structure: the skull. The sink was filled with blood and brain fragments, and cockroaches crawled on the caramel-colored countertops. The chairs were made from a skeleton each, and a torn-up tablecloth sat on the table. 



Continuing through the macabre maze, I made my way to the master bedroom, where a bed frame made of bones and a comforter of human skin was conjured from a life of sin. Friday the 13th posters covered the blacked out walls, and a wallside bookshelf held a slew of college-level anatomy textbooks and schizophrenia-level religious texts. I glanced at the words on the spines, and I didn’t recognize the names etched on their bound backs. Xythar, the demon of the tenth dimension, was the one that stood out to me, and I pulled it from the shelf in an attempt to self-educate, but it was attached to the shelf.



The shelf spun around, and a hidden hallway emerged from the black walls. I tiptoed to the opening, and the sloped corridor descended into darkness. With chrome panels on each side, broken up by tanks of people and preservatives. The youthful beauty of fully nude girls next door on full display reminded me of an alien’s aquarium, a zoo of gorgeous zombies. I meandered my way to the doorway at the end of the corridor, and I knocked. 



“Come in,” whispered Mark into a microphone, his grin still evident. 



I walked in the door, and Mark sat on a throne of unnaturally large human bones. “You made it through,” declared Mark. “I didn’t think you’d make it, but you did. You’re a different breed, and I believe you can keep a secret, but I don’t trust you. I need you to do me a favor.”



I looked at him with my blank face, and asked “What do you want?”



Mark, lifting his finger and smiling, inquired “What do you think of my office chair? It’s made from some bones I found while excavating some mounds out on Route 10. You don’t actually think those things are sacred, do you, Logan? Anyway, I need you to make a blood pact with me. I will cut an X into my finger, and you will cut an O, and we will shake hands in the name of Xythar. I’m clean.”



What the hell? I thought. I had already witnessed said horrors beyond human comprehension, and I had to do anything I could to make it out of this portal to Hell. I agreed. 



He grabbed a book from his desk and waltzed over to a couchside coffee table, inviting me to have a seat. I reluctantly walked to the table and sat down. 



“Xythar, Devourer of Worlds,” shouted Mark. “I call upon your dark power. Tonight, a sacred pact is made in blood, sealing Logan's silence. He knows Mark's secret, a truth that must remain hidden. Should Logan betray this trust and reveal Mark's darkness, I beseech you, unleash your wrath upon him. May his fate be a testament to your unwavering strength, a reminder that your will shall not be defied.”



Mark grabbed a switchblade from his floral-printed shirt pocket and looked me directly in the eye, smiling wide and laughing. He carved an X into his palm, and the gash erupted with blood. He didn’t flinch, and seemed to enjoy the pain. Must’ve been a masochist.



“It’s your turn, Logan,” uttered Mark in between heavy breaths. 



I grabbed the knife and dug into my calloused palm, etching an oval into my rough flesh. Blood erupted from my hand too, and we shook hands, his firm and mine trembling.



“I expect your silence,” demanded Mark. “And so does Xythar.” 



Xythar, a deity I had never heard of, would never dictate my decisions, but I did what any rational person would do, and I agreed to the pact. Mark directed me to a doorway and opened it, revealing my gnarly guitar, and I climbed up a cobweb-covered ladder to exit through a cellar door in the back of the home’s foundation. I sprinted to my safe place, my trusty van, and scrambled out of the sinister neighborhood, calling the cops and screaming to them about what I had just seen. 



I made it back home where I am writing this letter, and I have been narrowly avoiding death since the second I left the property. It started with a snake bite in the passenger seat of my van, and culminated in a near-collision on Pilgrim Boulevard while I was heading back to my studio apartment in the middle of the city. 



I feel the walls caving in. I don’t have much time, as Xythar is coming. This isn’t a pity party, it’s a swan song; an understanding of the coming reality, and a desire to immortalize my story before I become a simple statistic.



I feel a crisp breeze and a tapping on the window. An invisible force, the inter-dimensional deity Xythar will surely shackle me and take me to his hellish dimension, forever forgotten in a fiery world.
