Hey there! My name is JC. I started working as a night auditor for a hotel in a fairly large city a few weeks ago, I don't want to expose the exactly location as if corporate finds out I'm documenting my experiences here I could get in trouble, but I know one thing for certain and it is that there is something seriously off about this place.  


On the surface, it seems like your normal three star hotel. Plenty of rooms, a bar that's open six days a week (with the exception of Sunday), a pool that's closed indefinitely due to a "maintenance issue" that management will not disclose to us, right in the heart of my city.   


As stated, I'm the night auditor here, from 11pm to 7am five days a week I'm here, running reports, sending emails, placing orders, the whole kit and kaboodle. I wanted to have somewhere to share some of my stories, and I figured Reddit would be the best place for it.  


To start off, every night, around 11pm, our security guard locks the internal door. Our entrance is an airlock of sorts, the exterior door will always open, and there's a scanner for guests to scan their keys and staff to scan their fobs to get in after hours. (staff of course constituting myself and the security guard).  


All in all, it's a pretty laid back gig. I come in, get most of my work done by about 2 in the morning, get the lobby cleaned for breakfast crew and our houseman when they arrive at 5, get our little store re-stocked and spend the rest of my shift listening to horror podcasts on YouTube or scrolling Reddit. That is... until recently.  


Over the past couple of nights, I've started to notice things severely strange about our location. At first, it was small things, phone calls with no one on the other end (or worse so, just breathing), doors that would open and close on their own, and a monitor in the back office with a camera fixed on our bar that since I've started working here constantly glitches out or cuts out entirely for no discernible reason.

...until tonight, I happened to notice something strange. Our bar's been closed all week, I guess management felt if we had it open, especially for the 4th of July, things might get a little out-of-hand, so why was there someone behind the counter when I looked at the camera?   


I had to do a double take, but sure enough, there is somebody behind that counter. With how glitchy the camera is, I can't seem to make out any features of this person. But they seem... outlandishly tall. Now, our security guy, Jacob, is like 6'7", he is a TALL man, but whoever's on the camera seems to DWARF him by comparison. Jacob is actively doing an outside round right now, and I don't want to trouble him to come in over some Amazonian trying to sneak a drink.   


This was my thought process going out to the bar to tell whoever this was to kick rocks. But when I got there... there was no one there, not even a sign that there was anyone. When I returned to the back office whatever was on the camera was gone, at least that I could tell.  


Now, I could just be hallucinating, working nights like I do, with the overactive imagination I get from consuming horror story after horror story and with no small amount of Red Bull coursing through my system, this could JUST AS EASILY be chalked up to hallucinations. I'll have to ask Jacob if he's ever encountered anything like this before.  


The interior door keeps opening on it's own too, which Jacob has noted to me shouldn't be happening. I'll probably have to put in a fix-it ticket which will no doubt piss off our maintenance staff who would kill for the chance to not have to do anything for a day. But things always break here.   


This won't be the last you hear of me. I have to finish running my audit which means that this entry's gotta come to an end here, however in my next entry I'll include a video of the camera glitching out, it's really bizarre. And if anyone has any insight on what could've been behind the bar, I'd greatly appreciate it! Thank you.  


For now, Your Local Night Auditor is signing off.
