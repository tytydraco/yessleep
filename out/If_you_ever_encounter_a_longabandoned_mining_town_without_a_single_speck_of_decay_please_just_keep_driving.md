The authorities say my friends *must* have gone crazy.

They claim no right-minded person would end things the way they did.

But we were only stranded in the desert for one night. Not weeks, not months, not even a full day. Twelve measly hours. 

Who loses their sanity over the course of a single night? 

There were four of us: Hailey, Yasmin, Theo, and me. We were an unlikely bunch. Not much overlap in lifestyles, career paths, or political leanings. That said, we all had three things in common:

We were young, we were healthy, and we all loved visiting abandoned places. 

Our destination that morning was an abandoned mining town located in southwest corner of our state. Just a mile from the nearest highway, nestled snuggly in the valley between a pair of red rock mountains, there it was:

Wasichu. 

Per usual, Hailey led the charge. 

She flung herself from the passenger seat and began dashing towards a nearby church. Theo was livid. I, on the other hand, couldn’t help but chuckle at the sight. There was something comedic about watching a woman clad in a lavender Lululemon body suit sprinting full-tilt into a ghost town. Wavering slightly in the wind, the town almost seemed to shy away from Hailey, as if she were an affront to their modest, God-fearing sensibilities. 

I slung my camera around my neck. With the midday sun beating waves of dry heat against our backs, we hopped out of Theo’s Jeep and began exploring. 

The town wasn’t much, but even from a distance, I could tell it was surprisingly pristine. As Yasmin, Theo, and I walked down Wasichu’s singular street, a sense of awe embedded itself deep into my gut. 

The Saloon’s porch was weathered, sure, but none of it was outright rotten. No holes, no obvious termites chewing through the wood, not one plank out of place. The schoolhouse windows were caked with dust, but none of them were broken. We could even read the signs denoting which building was which. By my estimation, the paint had to be more than a century old. 

It was incredible. 

Would’ve been even *more* incredible if Theo and Yasmin had the decency to fuck off somewhere else for a bit and leave me be. 

I couldn’t focus on taking good pictures. 

There was Yasmin and her oral fixation with sunflower seeds, audibly shattering the shells between her teeth, sometimes discharging a red-tinged glob of spit into a napkin if one of the shards jabbed her gums and drew blood. When she finished a bag, she always had another. Theo often joked that if we were to get lost, rescuers could just follow the trail of blood, spit, and empty plastic bags to our exact location. 

Not to say he was any better. 

Just as obnoxious in a different way. 

The man couldn’t shut his damn mouth.

Always chattering, always joking, always filling the air with some sort of meaningless drivel. When Hailey’s mom passed, he couldn’t even keep his lips sealed for the whole funeral sermon. He just *had* to comment on the shape of her coffin. Not even a quarter of the way through, he leaned over to me, whispering about how the edges were "weirdly round". Like they were burying her inside a hollowed out torpedo. 

Before long, I’d reached my limit. Told Theo and Yasmin I was going to splinter off on my own for a while. They were disappointed, but that was their business, not mine. I knew I’d jogged far enough ahead once I couldn’t hear the incessant chewing or the relentless jabbering anymore. 

I couldn’t hear anything at the end of the street, actually. 

Ain’t a lot of white noise in the desert - a gust of wind singing through a sand dune here, a grasshopper chirping in some bluegrass there - but this was different. The silence was pure. Oppressive. All-consuming.

I was standing in front of a squat, windowless building. A shed, maybe. Couldn’t be sure. It was the only building without signage. 

I twisted the doorknob. Didn’t open. My hand encountered a clunky resistance, like it was locked, but it couldn’t have been, because on the second try, it gave way. The hinges didn’t creak. My boots didn’t thump against the floorboards. Everything remained silent. 

A red-orange flicker met my eyes, pulsing, pushing back against a hungry darkness. 

Candlelight, I think. 

That’s where my memories end for a while.  

I didn’t pass out or anything. The sensation was gentler. Seamless. Similar to falling asleep. One minute, your head is resting on a pillow, and you’re reflecting on your day or reviewing what the plan is for the morning, and the next minute, you’re gone. Wisked away. 

Actually, I do remember *one* detail. A single sound, loud enough to pierce the silence, and one that I’d recognize anywhere.

*CLICK. CLICK. CLICK. CLICK.* 

The shuttering lens of my precious camera. 

My memories resume after nightfall. 

The veil rises, and I’m staring at a red-orange flicker and an encroaching darkness. At first, I thought I was still in the shed, but the scene had changed. The flames were larger, more effervescent, and the darkness was dappled with a bright array of white pinpoints. 

A campfire below a clear night sky. 

Theo’s voice booms into focus. 

“Jesus Christ, Hailey! Remember what Valentina said when she circled this place on our map?”

Yasmin was curled into a ball on the opposite side of the fire, knees tucked against her chest, head buried in her thighs. Theo was on his feet, gesturing wildly at Hailey, who was pacing so furiously that she was kicking up small clouds of sand in her wake. 

“Yes, Theo, of course I do - “ 

“Then why the fuck did you sprint into town when we got here? Valentina specifically said: ‘Look, don’t touch.’ That was the plan. We all agreed! We’ll stop, get a few pictures - from a distance - and enjoy the fucking scenery.”

Hailey threw her hands in the air. 

“You *really* think the land is...what...cursed? *That’s* why your car won’t start? You sure it isn’t your complete lack of responsibility? Your *absolute* failure to *ever* take good care of anything? I mean, give me a break, Theo.”

His pupils fell to the sand. Nascent tears shimmered against the roaring fire. 

“And you know what? If we’re taking a stroll down memory lane, remind me - did I put a gun to your head and force you into Wasichu?”

My eyes swung back to Hailey. Guess she could feel my gaze on her, because her attention flipped to me. 

“I’m sorry - something you’d like to add?”

I shook my head *no*.

“Then stop fucking staring at - “ 

Those were her last words. 

Hailey’s anger vanished. 

Her arms became limp. 

The expression on her face turned vacant; every muscle relaxed, except the ones that controlled her eyes. Both were bulging, practically exploding from their sockets. One eyelid retracted from view, rising so high that I couldn’t see it anymore, disappearing somewhere inside her skull. The other hung halfway down. There was an indent above her lashes; a crescent from how hard her iris was pushing against the inside of the lid. 

There was a pause. 

Then, all at once, her body reactivated. 

She started sprinting. 

Wide, endless circles around Yasmin, Theo, and me. 

“Hailey...w-what are you doing?” Yasmin whimpered. 

No response. No change in her facial expression. 

“Jesus, what the fuck is wrong with you?” Theo said. 

She didn’t stop. She wouldn’t slow down. 

And I couldn’t pull my eyes away. 

Minutes passed. Our pleas fell on deaf ears. Her breathing became harsh. Sputtering wheezes spilled from her heaving rib cage. Her head became flushed, swelled with blood until it was the color of a bruise; a deep, throbbing indigo. My chest felt hot and heavy, like someone was ironing my breastbone. 

“Stop! Hailey, please, stop!” Yasmin screamed. 

Theo attempted to tackle her. 

He dove, but missed her waist. 

His arms wrapped around her shins. 

Hailey tripped, and the ball of her left ankle slammed into the hard sand. A sickening crunch radiated through the atmosphere. It barely slowed her down. She ran on the mangled appendage like it was the most natural thing in the world. After Theo's attempt, Hailey changed her trajectory. She sprinted into the darkness, straight forward, full steam ahead. 

The rhythmic snaps of shredding tissue got quieter, and quieter, and eventually, we couldn’t hear anything at all. 

Yasmin collapsed onto her side and began to softly weep. 

Cross-legged, catatonic, Theo turned to me and asked:

“Why...why didn’t you try to help?”

I didn’t have an answer for him. 

All of a sudden, Theo leapt into the Jeep and jammed his keys into the ignition. Tried to resurrect his car for nearly an hour, to no avail. There was gas in the tank, and he could flick the headlights on and off, but the engine was stubbornly dead. The machinery refused to even make a sound. 

At some point, exhaustion put us all to sleep. 

*CLICK. CLICK. CLICK. CLICK.* 

I awoke in a sitting position. 

My eyes were already open. 

I could tell that Theo was still sleeping, but I wasn’t looking at him. 

In the dim light of the waning fire, I could see Yasmin on her knees, hunched over, spine curled. Both hands were darting between her mouth and the ground, over and over again. The scalding pressure against my chest returned. An endless series of gritty *squeaks* emanated from her churning jaw. The noise was hellish, but quiet. Wasn’t loud enough to wake Theo on its own. 

Yasmin’s eyes were bulging. One was half-concealed behind a paralyzed eyelid. The rest of her face was loose, abandoned, a mask that obscured everything but her eyes. 

She was eating anything that was in front of her. 

And I watched her do it. 

It was mostly sand. Handful after handful of grainy sediment. That said, Yasmin held no culinary discriminations; nothing was off the menu. Sagebrush. A line of ants. A few beetles. One small rodent I had trouble identifying before she shoved it into her waiting maw. Hell, I even saw her take a bite out of a tarantula. The injury wasn’t fatal. It skittered away on its remaining legs before she could deliver the killing blow. 

Her throat swelled. Her stomach expanded. I think I heard a muted *pop*. Minutes later, she fell onto her back, mercifully still, finally full. 

I waited, seemingly unable to do anything else.  

As dawn crested over the horizon, Theo woke up. 

He rubbed his eyes and saw me first: petrified, motionless, upright. Incrementally, I witnessed a gut-wrenching fear take hold of him. Eventually, he turned over, and he was greeted by Yasmin’s bloated corpse bathed in a golden sunrise. 

Theo sprang to his feet. 

His mouth opened wide like he was about to say something, chastise me for my indifference maybe, but that’s not what came out. 

The fear evaporated, his one eye bulged, and only then did he begin. 

It was the single loudest scream I’d ever heard. 

And, God, to my abject horror, it just kept going. 

Seconds turned to minutes. The noise became shrill, crackling every so often. My ears began to ring. The valley brightened. Minutes accumulated. A gurgle crept into the scream. Blood trickled down the corners of his mouth. His lips turned the color of day’s old snow: the ashy white-blue of dirty slush piled high on the edges of busy streets. 

After about an hour, he choked, I think. Or he died from blood loss. The cause doesn’t matter. 

He collapsed, and it was finally over. 

I stood, walked over to Theo’s Jeep, and climbed in the driver’s seat. With my camera still slung around my neck, I turned the keys. 

The engine growled to life.

I drove home. 

Eight days later, I’ve been cleared as a suspect. The coroner examined the bodies. It’s evident that I didn’t lay a finger on any of them. 

I know better, though. 

I may not have touched them, but I’m not blameless. The last four pictures on my camera proved it. Didn’t mean much to the police when they saw them, but it's meant everything to me. 

One shows the door of that shed swinging open.   

The next shows a black box on the floor, the front engraved with orante gold symbology, surrounded by lit candles. 

The third is closer to the box, and the lid is up, revealing a necklace perched atop red satin. Two small, violet gemstones dangle from a silver chain. They’re fused together. One is a full sphere, one is a half sphere. 

The final picture is identical to the third, but the necklace is gone. 

I’m still wearing that necklace. 

I can feel the gemstones pushing into my chest. 

No matter how I pull, I can’t take it off.

All I can do
