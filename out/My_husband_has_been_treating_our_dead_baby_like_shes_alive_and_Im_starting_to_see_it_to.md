I don't know where it went wrong. When my husband(25) and I(26) received news that my last check up had revealed I was pregnant we were ecstatic. We immediattely rushed home to order things for a nursery. We could already imagine ourselves as a perfect little family. When the gender was revealed to be female it was even better as we had always wanted a little girl. When she was born she was crying but stopped as soon as she was placed into my arms. 

She radiated pure sunlight. Everything in the room seemed to blur and I could only focus on her. My Angel. My Angelica. Eventually after feeding her the nurses took her away so I could rest. As I drifted off I could see my husband smiling and crying happy tears. When I woke up though 5 hours later something was wrong. My husband was crying still but not happy tears. These were loud wails. The doctor stood in front of him with a solemn yet saddened look on his face.

The anesthesia hadn't worn off fully and I started moaning and screaming asking what was going on. The nurses had to put me to sleep as I was trying to rip out my iv. Later I would come to learn my baby had unfortunately been a victim of SIDS

When I was cleared and checked out I went home and cried and screamed into my pillow for days. My work was very understanding and gave me even more payed leave days. If I hadn't been wallowing in misery I might have noticed my husband being suspicious. The support of family and freinds eventually helped me recover. A few days later I started going back to work.The week after on tuesday my husband said he would have a suprise for me when I got home. I expected to come home to a nice dinner or maybe a clean house but instead I came home to see my daughter. 

My husband looked at me gleefully as he showed me her. My brain was so wild with thoughts I could hardly hear him talking about how he had her turned into a doll a while ago by some professianals. My eyes welled up with tears and I ran to my room crying. My husband came in to console me. He told me to just try it out. He eventually persuaded me into it. I tried to indulge him. I thought this was how he was dealing  with his grief. i thought he would get over it.

I know it sounds stupid now but I was blinded by sadness. Immediately I hated it. It was so hard to watch as he would pretend to feed it a bottle and tuck it in. I was holding out hope and finding numbers for professional therapists all the while. one day I was off work and my husband wasn't so I was left at home alone. My husband had put it on the kitchen counter to feed it "Breakfast".

I couldn't stand looking at it so I tried tom move it when I touched the thing I shreiked. It wasn't cold or hot but warm. ALIVE warm. My husband got home shortly after and I told him I was tired. I went to our bedroom and thought about what happened. From that point it all started to spiral downwards. A few days later my husband said "Look our baby's taking her first steps!" I looked over with gritted teeth and I could have swore I saw the doll move it's leg. 

Another time I woke up in the middle of the night to what sounded like a baby crying only for it to stop seconds later. Even weirder  I've seen my husband whispering to the doll, at night and when he thinks i don't see him. I think i'm going insane. I don't know what to do! Who should I even talk to about this?!  All I know is I don't even wanna look at it!

It's a terrifying and depressing reminder of what we could have had...
