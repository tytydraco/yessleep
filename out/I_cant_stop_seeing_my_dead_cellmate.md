I got out of prison six months ago, and I’ve been scraping by ever since. Spent a few weeks in a shelter, then another one, then a few nights in the park when I got sick of the smell of piss and desperation. Eventually, I landed here—a crumbling little house on the bad side of town, the kind of place where the cockroaches own the lease and the wind howls through holes in the drywall. It ain’t much, but it’s got a roof, and after what I’ve been through, that’s something.

But ever since I walked out those gates, I haven't felt alone.

I keep seeing him—Susan.

Yeah, you read that right. His name was Susan. He was my cellmate for two years, a wiry little guy from Mississippi with a slow, syrupy drawl and a grin that could charm a snake. He used to say he got the name from his grandma, who named him after some long-dead uncle. "Old family tradition," he told me, like that explained anything.

Susan was a Satanist. Not the kind that just wears pentagrams and listens to heavy metal. No, Susan believed. He used to sit on his bunk for hours, eyes closed, whispering things under his breath. He said our bodies were just rentals, that the real us was something bigger, something waiting to break free.

"You ever feel it, boy?" he'd ask me, voice low and conspiratorial. "That tug at the back of your mind? Like you ain't really in your skin, like somethin' in you is strugglin’ to wake up?"

I told him he was full of shit.

Three years ago, he hung himself in our cell. No warning, no note. Just tied a bedsheet to the bars and stepped off the toilet like he was boarding a train. I remember the sound his neck made. It was quiet. Too quiet.

I didn’t think about him much after that. Not until I got out.

Now I see him.

Not full-on, standing-in-front-of-me see him. Just flickers. A shadow in the corner of my vision, a shape in the bathroom mirror when I look away. And his voice—God, his voice.

"Well, ain't this just pitiful?"

He talks to me like he used to, all honey and hellfire, like a televangelist working a crowd.

"Look at you, scroungin' in the dirt like a goddamn insect. Ain't you tired? Ain't you ready to rise?"

I try to ignore him. I tell myself it’s PTSD, a guilty conscience, whatever. But he won’t shut up.

And the worst part?

He’s starting to make sense.

At first, it was just little things. I’d catch myself thinking about what he used to say, about how the body ain’t nothin’ but a cage, about how the soul is meant to ascend. Then I started feeling it—the tug he talked about, like something inside me is straining against my ribs, desperate to break loose.

Last night, I woke up to the sound of my own voice.

I was whispering. Chanting.

The words felt familiar, but I don’t know what they mean. I bit my tongue so hard I tasted blood just to make it stop.

I’m scared.

I don’t want to end up like Susan. I don’t want to wake up one day and find myself standing on a chair, a noose around my neck, stepping off into nothing.

But I can feel him, pressing closer, curling around my thoughts like smoke.

And I’m starting to wonder if maybe—just maybe—he was right all along.
