It all started one day when three men dressed in black came into my office. They presented me with a movie script and asked me to produce it. I told them I would read it. They then left. I read it.

It was dark. It was strange. 
I decided to pass on it. Two weeks passed and I received a phone call. The caller asked me if I would produce their script. I declined. The caller began threatening me.

He spoke in such a way I felt fear and terror. No human could talk like that. Not that dirty. 
When I told him I didn't fear his threats, for God is by my side, he blasphemed God in a manner that shocked me to the core.

At home, I noticed small things happening. I would turn off the TV, then, when returning to the room, it would be back on.
Items would disappear and then appear in different places.

I would feel watched. I would see shadows. Just glimpses of them.
One day, I was walking all alone on an empty street and I saw a huge wolf. It growled viciously. 

That was weird, as no wolves lived in my area as far as I knew.

The beast slowly walked towards me. Sharp teeth. Then, it left. Back home, I got another call. The person asked me if I changed my mind about the screenplay.

I said no. The script was vile. And poorly written. And not interesting enough. I could go bankrupt if I made it. So I refused yet again.
I lived alone. I could hear footsteps all around me, like something invisible walked around me. I jumped on the bed.

I saw animal footprints on my bed. Then, something growled next to my face. It stopped. I couldn't sleep that night. 

The next day, I went to work. I found my desk upside-down. Like a tornado passed by.
I decided to call the local parish. An exorcism might be needed, but it would take time. 
On my way home, a police officer pulled me over. I was speeding. I was so distraught that I didn't notice my mistake.

After giving me a ticket, the officer told me to produce the screenplay.

How did he know about it? 
Back home, I took a seat on the couch. I noticed some red dots on my shirt. It was.. blood. Then, more and more drops as it started to rain blood from the ceiling.
I screamed. It stopped. There was no trace of blood left.

Knocks on my door. I opened it, and lying there was my cousin, who had died six years ago. Like a ghost or a zombie. I peed on myself.

He told me to produce the script, then vanished. I was still determined not to do that. It was too poor and too strange. No one would see it!
Moreover, I decided to burn it. I grabbed the script and threw it into my chimney, where it began to burn.


From its ashes, the fire reignited itself. And the flames rose high in my chimney. And from the fire emerged a demon so frightening I was paralyzed by fear at its sight.


I felt its cold breath in my face. I fled. I entered my car and just drove. Fast. 


My heart pounding like crazy. Then, all I remember was a loud bang and crash, then I woke up in a hospital, lying on the bed. Everything hurt. The doctors told me I had an accident.


I heard later that those men went to another producer, and he made the movie. 


I heard people who watched it lost their minds or were turned into murderers.


As for me, I can't sleep anymore, for when I close my eyes, that terrible demon is all I can see.
