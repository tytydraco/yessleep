This isn’t a cry for help.
This is a warning.
Please don't take it as anything but.
Healing is a long process, I am not fixed, I just want somewhere to leave this behind,
Somewhere I can one day look back on. Something that doesn’t smell like blood and vomit.

Micheal gave me a parting gift today.
I guess telling him to kick me out everyday got to him eventually. If I could see his face I’d see him angry, maybe crying too. His face isn’t necessary, I can tell with his blurry shifting mouth and the disfigured reflection of mine on the foggy window, Its disgust. He can’t fuck anybody with the reeking smell of a walking corpse leaking its scent onto the cheap furniture. It doesn’t matter now. Even with a bed I usually fall asleep on the floor anyways. This is better for everyone. A book and a pen was nice, he gave me $50 to buy a sleeping bag or food, I wont. He knows I wont. This isn’t for me, its for him, so he doesn’t feel guilty. On the first page is the date and a phone number incase of an emergency. 

Night of Sunday


The streets are pretty at night. They really are. I can’t feel the warm or cold on the thin layers of skin wrapped around my meat suit. The fabric of my clothing dances around, pulsating and mimicking the pulse from my heart trying to breathe its way back into being, breathe its way outside of me, I won't let it. The pavement is cold and hard but its solid, its just about the only solid thing out there. Greenery tries to eat me, Same with mattresses and dirt. Lights distort the shape of buildings and trees, they all spiral and whirl and become complicated shapes like geometric examples in math exams. Maybe if I was a little smarter I wouldn’t be here. I wish I liked math. 

A few days after sunday.

It's funny how quick people go back to animalistic grouping with enough drugs floating through their system. Im dull to the process of getting it, its not hard. I go to somebody as high as me with money from their living parents, their disappointed and crying mother and father. I talk as soft as I can, the ugly and the older they are the more they’ll pay. I let them do what they want. It’s not hard. They can take the living and the breathing clothes off of me to grant their freedom for the moment, they can fuck what they want and how they want and when they want, it’s all the same to me. They’re on so much they cant see how thin and bruised I am, I’m on so much I can’t feel what they do to me. Works out evenly, don’t it?


Dates are for stupid people with ties


Somebody didn’t wake up today. I don’t remember her name, or how she looked. Her crooked slimy teeth dangle out of her mouth, hanging on by bleeding strands. I wonder how many beat her, how many paid. Her soulles blue eyes look up at the men taking turns. There might be a pulse, its enough. Both sides couldn’t care less. Maybe a version of her once did, a version of me once probably did. I get offered more smack for kissing her and letting them use me too. Its the first time I turn them down. I guess corpses are my limit. She was nice, I miss her hugs. I miss the warmth of bodies. Everybody here is so cold. So Silky, I can see them the same way Micheal slowly became. There’s the general shape of the body but its not quite. There. Eyes with deep bags, mouths with broken teeth, dishaped noses and slit eyebrows. I can see the parts but it doesn’t make a whole. They aren’t a them. Nobody is. Reality is when something is, something that is, is real, right? Am I an is? I know I used to be a person. I miss my dog. I remember how she looked. Her lower leg bone torn a foot out from her body.  The nerves and bone making up the joint showing wide on display. Half her face locked in an emotionless glare and the other half crushed. She taught me that bones are really white. She died quickly. Is my dog an is or a was? She’s a memory now, a deflated balloon dangling out in the back of the empty sacks of my brain. We are all people because we remember things that make up our speech, our language, even dogs know us as their owner from memory. All mine are tied up and locked away, remembered when its convenient. This book can help with that. Does that make me something that once was? Everyone remembers me before the me that became of me. Every fuck, every hug, every friend I’ve made as new me, They dont remember me. The dead girl with blue eyes didn’t think of me. She let people use her anyways. She probably didn’t care what they did to her. Maybe so, or maybe something else. Her blue eyes have been following me. Leaking in through the tight gaps in brick walling, her yellow teeth. I wish I could remember her better. Im sure I see her face everywhere but I can’t tell. Do ghosts know the difference between sobriety and high? I can hear her crying sometimes at night. More needles, more silence, more bliss. If I stop taking I start to care, I dont like the caring. Keep it far, far, far away. I’ve done so much im ashamed of. 


I’ve gotten into a group

It’s a nice crowd. 
Long hair with beanies and long hair with loose tops.
Their animals and creatures dangling off of their rotting moldy shoulders are shifting and rotating. Have I been taking more and more than I used to? I keep going and keep going until the walls cry with me. Until I see her. Its how I know im high enough now. She pets my dog now. The leg and half her skull still melting downwards. The cold concrete building has hands that reach through the windows in the morning, clawing at the cold, eating it up as long as it can and when its gone everything goes louder. The moaning is louder at night.
Its not good moaning.
We’ll spend the few minutes of waking up and it fading away briefly to talk.
The two girls are called Sarah and Riley. One of them was pregnant at 14 with their brothers child, the other tried to kill herself for something else that she couldn’t say. That lost look in her viney green eyes told me the memory. Something she tried looking for to have a place to blame. Somewhere to be capable of saying that this wasn’t her fault, that she’s a result not a cause. It hurts too much, her mind wont let her remember it. I wonder if she’ll survive remembering it. She puts the needles straight into her veins after carving an open wound into her skin. I wonder if she feels it, I wonder if I still care about bodies. I hug into the two, they hug me back. The boys used to love eachother. Its not love anymore. Its a promises they’re too far gone to remember the details of. They’re chained together by eachother but they cant remember why. What the chains are made of. Its a promise they’re keeping but dont remember the details of. Their cold disgusting skin pulsates and shifts around and around and spirals from worms and scorpions. Spiders and Snakes. Is it them or is it me? The girl with blue eyes mouths out something but can’t get it out. I wish I had the strength to walk up and pet my dog again. Even if its hanging by a strain of flesh, her tails wagging. 


I saw Micheal today

I caught his cologne and his dangly, wirey hair dancing through the earths harsh breath like screaming tortured worms. I think he noticed me but didn’t want to talk to me. I looked at my reflection and couldn’t notice me. The person who looked back is not an is anymore, its a was. Im a corpse, no better than the girl following me around. People start treating me the way I treat her too. Its not disgust and moving out of the way anymore. Its nothing. I dont get talked to, I dont get looked at, I wont be talked about anymore in a joking sense. The only part of my individuality left is a collection of pages on a war torn notebook filled with words that wont ever mean anything until im gone. Maybe one day my rotting mass will be connected to somebody rich and famous, maybe one day i’ll be the long dead failed relative of a queen with black rotten bones filled with dents. Maybe my tears will slowly make dents. Like water forming caves over millions of years. I never cry and think. I cry while im asleep, I cry when I think. I cry when I remember. My Micheal won’t look at me the way he used to, back when I was a thing. 

A poem


Once upon a day gone by
I watched the sun filled shine in my eyes
The careful detail of a nice bright smile,
With white teeth and clean breath that I used to lie,
I loved and thrived, through foster houses with pride,
I wrote and sang and lived to die but kept with all my lies.
The lies they ate and ate and ate
Until that girl turned into a snake
Consuming the black, the bad, the plague
Letting the sad decay
I’ll eat
And eat
And eat
And eat
Until the light decays.
If im never happy, im never sad.
And ill eat it all away.


Riley’s gone

Riley cut herself too deep a few days ago.
She didn’t leak anymore than she normally would. The knife carving a messy dishapen cut from as high as she could reach up her shoulder down to her palm. It's a miracle she survived half as long as she did. The idea of mentally cold bodies is different now. Every breathing thing has some warmth. After she went cold, after days, somebody checked her pulse. I knew. I didn’t say it. Neither to me or to anybody else, I didn’t let it. I didn’t let her die. She was alive to me. Her fake warm leaking out of her fake body with strands of copper scented tar pouring out of her. Her veins looked like spaghetti. Like somebody took a rusted fork and swirled it around and around mixing all the veins among eachother into a mangled disgruntled mess. One of the two boys tried to touch her but I slapped them away. I dont know why I did that, but I needed to. I went to the street carrying her. She was so light.
The spiders and reptiles hiding between the floorboards perched out to wave goodbye and laugh.  “You let her” I hear through the sniggering. “You killed her”. 


I begged for somebody to call an ambulance but I misjudged how bad the region I had sunken into was. Their hostile blurry faces looked away with disdain and disgust. I wasn’t a begging body. I was an invisible woman with a disgusting corpse in her invisible hands. I was a problem they could avoid. I waited with her for two days. I was sober for two days.
The heat, the burning erosion eating and burning the inside of me, my body was a broiler.
The colour and magical shapes unfocused and dissolved from my vision as the world became sharper. The bad thoughts came back. I miss my dog. 
The bad thoughts came back. I miss my life. 
The bad thoughts come back. My mom is crying against a wall with mascara running through the green dress she borrowed from a friend.
The bad thoughts come back. My mom is on the bed with a needle the size of my arm on the floor alongside more than I could count at the time.
The bad thoughts come back. I ruined everything.
She couldn’t handle a child but she had one. She couldn’t handle a job but she took two.
She couldn’t handle living, so she stopped trying.
The ambulance comes back.
I can’t tell if its happening or if its a memory.
I’m nine again and dragging my mothers corpse outside.
They try to take Riley out of my hands.
I drag her down the stairs not realising the foaming and bleeding from her mouth. I wont notice. Not this time.
I tell the ambulance she’s ok and lock my hands around her ruined body.
I fail to unlock the door with the key, through tears and enough fear to paint my hair white.
They put two stretchers out of somewhere, they make space for the both of us.
I wait outside for three hours before my father gets back from work.
I hold Riley’s hand in the ambulance while they put a mask on me and a bag over her. 



13/05/2025

I'm surprised Micheal picked up.
My emergency contacts were dead.
I woke up a week after the incident. My body needed a lot of alot.
The white is an odd contrast to the dark I had gotten so used to.
They had opened my book and called the first number they could find. 
I didn’t have an ID so I was a John Doe until he arrived.
The nurses told me he had been waiting for days. 
He looks so pretty. He weeped and apologised but it was for nothing.
He couldn’t have changed this, it was happening regardless.
I get relief from seeing Riley okay, I thought she was long gone. 
Micheal doesn’t see her.
Riley’s sitting across the room and laughing.
Laughing with a girl in a green dress, a girl with blue eyes, and a dog without a leg and a stitched up skull.
