  What was your school library like? What was your school librarian like? Was he/she mean? Were they nice?


 The reason I'm asking you all this will be clearer when I tell my story. Hopefully you will catch on to what I'm saying. Or just think this is another creepypasta and scroll on.


 On one particular day everything was fine. We all had fun that day in middle school. I liked hanging out with my friends because I couldn't hang out with them after.


 When the time to go to the library came I was excited. I loved the library. Basically I loved books in general. The time you can spend and think you are in a fictional created world was fascinating.


 The way the library is usually always quiet is a good thing for me. I love reading in silence. I especially love having conversations with the old librarian Mrs. White.


 She was a sweet kind old woman. Nobody was rarely mean to her. Of they were they were properly scolded by the principal.


  As all my classmates were in the library doing our science work because our teacher called in sick the bell rung.


 Welp, off to Music. I thought.


 But I had to finish this chapter of this book I'm reading first. I had already completed my work as I always did before the other classmates. I was reading a fantastic story about a thing called a hobbit.


  I loved fantasy worlds. The way that even if you stray far from the story just to explore the world in the book itself.


 I hear someone calling my name in a sort of a silent whisper.  "Mark".


   I turned around to find no one in the library. Not even the librarian. My heart started beating as i put the book up. 


  "Hello? Mrs. White?" I called out thinking that she was probably in the back with the audio tapes and the newer books that they get through mail.


   Shit. I thought. I'm going to be late.


   As I went towards the door I heard my name in that same silent whisper.


   "Mark". I heard it this time. It sent chills all the way down my spine. 


   "Mark", my brain instinctively went into fight or flight mode. But I went to the direction of the voice anyway. For some reason i couldn't move my legs on my own. It's like something was controlling me.


   My legs feel like they were about to faint as they kept walking. I felt like I was going to black out. Help, I thought and pleaded to the brain in my head. Don't listen to it. Don't listen to this voice. What is this voice and what does it belong too?


  As i went past Mrs. White's desk and towards the small dark room that's always seems like something is going on in there for Mrs. White. 


   I took a quick glance past the desk and into the hallway as no one is in it. Well I'm in trouble now I thought sarcastically since I'm pretty sure the thing with the voice plans to kill me.


   My head then goes back towards the room I'm walking too. Feels like I'm walking the green mile, I thought again in my head.


   Then my whole body stops moving. I couldn't even movie it if I tried. My throat was becoming dry and sweat was going down my body. Then a long hairless hand with claw line fingers went out the dark room and held onto the right side of the door.


   Please don't go out any further, I thought in fear. I'll have nightmares for the rest of my life.


   "Mark", it says in that silent voice whisper again as its other arm goes to the left side. Both arms leaving scratch marks by the door. 


  Then it's grotesque head comes out of the darkness. It looked like Mrs. White's head except morphed into a terrifying shape.


   "Mark", as the silent voice goes through its hideous open mouth with rotting sharp teeth. 


   In my mind I'm crying as I am thinking I'm going to die. If i die I knew it wouldn't leave nothing left. This hideous creature wouldn't have survived this long without doing so.


   I then with one last resort of my humanity that can still move and think went to embrace a hopefully fast death. 


   "Warn them". That thing said in the same dark whisper. Until then i noticed the rasp in it's voice. "Warn the bad one's that I will come for them". 


   Then this thing went back into the darkness of the room and my body fell as if released by it's weight. Then with the same fear of it still lingering I ran to the door of the library and started knocking and banging as fast and hard as i could.


   When a teacher eventually came to my aid I found out that school was over. Somehow that thing kept me there for the whole rest of the school day. 


   As the teacher went to lead me out of the school building I went to take one last look at that dark room. None of that things scratch marks beside of the door were there.


   It made my heart beat faster as I left that school building.


   Now the thing I'm going to say is what that creature wanted me to warn. I got what it was trying to say and what the creature is. This thing is a manifestation of all librarian's bad thoughts. It then heads out and hunts the kids that made it be born.


   It never hunted me. But, i know that as I went to a couple of highschool reunions that some of my classmates that everyone knew as the bad kids but changed had mysteriously disappeared. Mrs. White the librarian died when I went into highschool but that creature still lives. 


   Memories linger more than a person does when it dies.


   So next time you see your librarian make sure you always be nice to him/her. Make sure to warn the bad kids in your school. If you are one of the bad kids reading this. 


   I pray for you. Cause it's already with you. Watching.
