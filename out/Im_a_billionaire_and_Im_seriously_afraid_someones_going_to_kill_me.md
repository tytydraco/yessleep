I should have known that the interviewee looked fake as shit.

He had a very well fitted suit, with an expensive looking haircut, but I could tell his shoes were knockoffs. 

It was on his second round interview that I was called down to see him. He had all the right experience, and his voice wasn't grating, so in my mind, I was already thinking: *sure*, *he'll do.* But at the end of the interview, when we shook hands, a fiery pain shot through my palm. Like a bee sting.

When he pulled away I could see he had been wearing a sharp *tack* on the inside of his palm. I was flabbergasted. 

He gave a little laugh. “Gotcha.”

I looked him in the eyes. “Gotcha?”

With a shrug, he walked himself out the door. I told the front door security that he was never allowed back in.

\*\*\*

Cut to: the next day when I took my morning shower.

Waiting for the temperature to turn hot, I held my hand out beneath the faucet and felt the water run down my hands. **About thirty seconds into this, I noticed my skin was melting off.**

I screamed. Ran out of the shower. Towelled myself dry.

Half my left hand had turned skeletal. The flesh in between my fingers had leaked off like melted wax. Other parts of my arm also appeared *smudged*. It's like I was suddenly made of play-doh.

\*\*\*

A quick visit to a private hospital revealed nothing. No one knew what was wrong with me.

I had lost all pain reception in my body. Although I was missing chunks of skin, muscle and fat tissue in my arms, none of it hurt. Like at all. The doctors also couldn’t figure out why my body was reacting to water in this strange way. A single drop on my skin turned my flesh into mud. **Water was able to melt me.**

Two weeks of various tests proved nothing.

I was worried for my life, sure. But I was equally worried that the dolts at my company were messing up preparations for our biggest tech conference of the year. 

So I hired the doctors to visit me at my home. I wasn’t about to abandon the firm I had spent building for my entire adult career.

\*\*\*

I came back to work wearing gloves, long pants and a turtle-neck. The only liquid I could drink without any damage was medical-grade saline.

No matter how much deodorant I put on, I would reek. It's what happens when you wear three layers of clothes and aren't allowed to shower ever again. But no one seemed to mind. Everyone knew I had developed some kind of skin disorder, and politely ignored the subject. As loyal employees should.

I was exclusively bouncing between my house—to my limo—to my office—to my limo—back to my house where sometimes doctors would await me with further tests.

My favorite restaurant remained unvisited. I skipped my oldest son’s birthday.  I even missed my fuckin’ box seats for the last hockey game for godsakes.

\*\*\*

Yeah, yeah, I’m sure you're all laughing. 

But death is death. Billionaire or not, I’m sure you too would be terrified if you were being followed around by a maniac in a red hoodie.

A maniac who was clearly that shithead interviewee.  He obviously never got hired anywhere else because he’s constantly been spying on my house from across the street.

I’ve sent my security out after him, but he’s a slippery little fucker, with ears like a rat. Anytime anyone gets close, he skitters away without a trace.

It’s been a nightmare. I’ve hired four extra guards but the only thing they're good at is using their walkies to tell me everything is “all clear”.

The one time my personnel almost grabbed him, He left a large red water gun at the scene. A super soaker.  

That's how I know he's been planning to assassinate me the whole time. The tack. My new disease. **He's trying to melt me.**

\*\*\*

Yesterday, they finally caught him. 

I wanted him sent straight to a cop car, straight to jail. But apparently you can't arrest someone for carrying a couple water balloons in their jacket. 

So instead I had them lock him up in my deepest basement office at my work. His hands were tied and he was stripped of all his belongings, including a diary riddled with slogans like ‘Wealth Must End’ and ‘Deny, Defend, Depose’.

I had his full name and documentation from when he applied at my firm. I threw his resume onto his lap. “So Mr. Derek Elton Jones, am I part of your ‘kill the rich’ agenda?”

He stared at his resume, not looking me in the eye. “Billionaires shouldn’t exist,” is all he said.

I scoffed. Incredulous at the accusation. “I’m not a billionaire. That’s an exaggerated net worth that can change at any moment. I run a tax software company. Is there something I’ve done wrong?”

“You help the rich evade tax.”

*Is that what he thinks?*  “That’s the exact opposite of what my software does actually. My customers are people who want to pay their taxes *properly.”*

He stayed silent, staring at the floor. I resisted the urge to smack the back of his head.

“Tell me exactly what sort of biological weapon you pricked me with 2 months ago, and then maybe we can discuss how I’ll let you go.”

He mumbled something under his breath. 

“Speak up. Derek.”

His nose wriggled. “...Haven’t bathed in weeks have you?”

I came up to his face. I was *this close* from slapping him.

“That’s why they call you *stinking* rich,” he smiled.

Before I could strike his cheek, his spit **sprayed my face.** My vision blurred instantly. I recoiled and yelled. 

When I settled down and carefully wiped his saliva off my brow, I could see part of my nose, lips and left eye lying on the floor.

He just stared at me, laughing. 

“Don’t you get it? I didn’t infect you with anything! You did this to yourself! Your greed, your untouchable ego—it’s all rotting you from the inside out!”

\*\*\*

I had to leave my work because of the condition my face was in. I couldn’t risk infection.

My guards let Derek leave too, because my lawyer said I could face serious legal trouble if I tried to trap someone against their will. So I relented.

Now, I’m left alone, trapped in my crumbling body, surrounded by doctors who keep either drawing blood or injecting me with experimental drugs.

I haven’t told my ex, or my kids or any of my family really, because what would they care? They haven’t spoken to me since last Christmas. 

I’ve already paid off the local news to highlight one of my last big donations to a charity in Ghana because people have to remember the good that I’ve done. And I have done good.

I came up from a middle-class family and worked hard to earn an upper, *upper* class lifestyle. I’m a living tribute to the American dream. *The power of an individual’s will to succeed.*

I keep thinking about the last words Derek said. About my selfishness and avarice. I keep saying to myself that he doesn’t know what the fuck he’s talking about, and that he’s just following some stupid trends on social media. He should learn to respect other people, our society, our whole system of capitalism.

But despite all this, when I stare at the twisted reflection of myself in the bedside mirror, at the exposed skull emerging on the left side of my face… a bizarre feeling of acceptance hangs over me that I can’t quite explain.

It's like… even though I look like a melting wax sculpture, like a godawful zombie that arose from the grave, and despite me knowing that I should book some reconstructive surgery, or at least some flesh grafts to even out my complexion, a small voice inside me says, “*no don’t.* *You deserve to look like this.”* 

I can’t help but wonder, *maybe I* [*do.*](https://www.reddit.com/r/EclosionK2/comments/1g0837r/welcome/)
