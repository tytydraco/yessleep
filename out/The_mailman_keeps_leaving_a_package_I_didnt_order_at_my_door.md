I've lived in the same house for years. It's in a middle class neighborhood which I had always considered to be a safe place for my wife, son, and I to live. Last year we were having some issues with our packages being stolen so I installed a security camera outside which comes with an app that notifies me when movement is sensed outside. I work as a fireman which means I have to stay overnight a lot. Today I got a notification from the app that movement was sensed outside our door. Normally I wouldn’t check what was up because it goes off fairly frequently due to us living on a major road. However it was 2 am and something was telling me to check the app. I clicked on the app and saw that the mailman was dropping something off. I thought this was strange as the mailmen in my neighborhood come between 9-10 am almost everyday and I couldn’t see a reason for the mailman to be working at 2 am. I called my wife knowing there was a good chance she was awake as she tends to stay up late getting work done. I called her and asked if she had ordered something,

“No, why?” she replied.

“The mailman just dropped something off, don't go outside or open it until I get home.” I answered anxiously.

I got off work at 2 the next day and went home to my wife and son. I walked outside and noticed that there was no package. I went onto my security camera app to make sure that I did not miss someone stealing the package. We had left the package out overnight. It would have been a perfect opportunity to steal our package. However when I went onto the app I noticed there was a recording that I must have gone off while I was sleeping. I clicked on the recording with haste and what I saw haunts me. The mailman was back but this time with a knife. He picked up the package and stared at the camera. The mailman's face was blank with the exception of two jet black, soulless eyes. I immediately called my wife's parents and my wife and son went to stay at their house until I figured out what was going on. I did not have work for the next couple of days so this was the perfect opportunity for me to investigate the situation. I assumed this must be some sick teenager with a mask pulling a prank and I was determined to catch them. It was 2 am the same night and I got a notification on my phone. I got out of bed and started making my way to the door. I stopped in my tracks when I saw what was on the camera there. The thing was standing with a package looking dead at the camera but this time with my wife's face. As I looked at the live footage in horror I realized that it wasn't my wife, it just had her face there was no hair and the body was clearly a man's body. I ran back to my room and grabbed my gun out of the safe. I stood at alert and called my wife.

“Are you at your parents house?”

“Yes, why what is going on?” she asked in a frantic voice it was obvious that I had just woken her up.

“I'm coming over now to keep the doors locked and stay safe.” I hung up the phone and started to walk outside. I saw the package. I picked it up and ran to the car. I positioned my mirrors and turned to pull out of the driveway. Sitting in my passenger seat was my wife with a knife in her hand.

“May I have that package back?”
