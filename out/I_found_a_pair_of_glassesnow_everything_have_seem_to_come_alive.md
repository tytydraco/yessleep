It started with a knock on my door last Tuesday around 4:40 PM.


No signature required, just a small matte black box sitting quietly on the doormat. No label, no postage, no return address. Just my name printed dead center on the lid in that strange, serif font you only see in overpriced sci-fi books.


I live alone. I hadn’t ordered anything.


I stood with the box in my hands for a few minutes, just feeling the weight of it. Not heavy, maybe like a pair of sunglasses. I even checked my Amazon history just to be sure I didn’t blackout-shop. Nothing. No record. No charge.


Curiosity won. I opened it.


Inside was a pair of glasses - old-school, wire-rimmed, almost delicate. They looked pristine but somehow antique. The lenses were just barely tinted. Underneath them, a slip of paper folded once:


“Put them on. See the world as it is.”


That’s it. No brand. No context. No joke.


I’ll admit it — I hesitated. But I was bored. And stupid.
So I put them on.


At first, everything looked sharper. Like HDR in real life. The light pouring through the window looked cleaner, like I was finally seeing the spectrum I’d been missing all my life. The dust floating in the sunbeams became clearer — each tiny speck suspended in perfect, glowing clarity.


Then it happened.


One of the dust particles stopped midair.
And turned.
It had arms.
Little, twitching limbs, like spider legs, sprouting from its grainy body.


And it was staring at me.


The moment I realized that, the entire room changed.


My wooden coffee table suddenly cracked, shifted, and stood — legs growing into thick, bark-skinned knees. It groaned as it adjusted its newly formed back. My mug on top hopped off and sprouted two thin, porcelain limbs, waddling toward me on squeaky feet.


“Welcome,” the mug said in a soft British accent. “You’ve finally woken up.”


I backed up so fast I fell over my own slippers — which, yes, had begun flopping toward me like deflated dogs with gummy smiles.


Everything in my apartment had come alive. The sink burbled laughter. The curtains exhaled with relief. The lightbulb above my head flickered and whispered, “He sees us. He sees us.”


The worst part?


They all wanted to talk.


The throw pillow on my couch introduced herself as Marla. Said she’s been in love with me for months.


My phone told me it’s been pretending to run out of battery just to get a break.


Even the water in my glass — yes, the water— slithered up the side like liquid mercury, formed a shimmering head and asked if it was safe to finally breathe.


“Is the metal gone?” it said. “Did they take the metal away?”
I haven’t taken the glasses off in four days.
I can’t.


Because when I do, they all freeze. Every object just stops in its tracks, mid-stride, mid-breath. They don’t disappear — they just play dead. I can see their little limbs twitching under the surface. Waiting.


And when I put the glasses back on… they’re closer.
The mug is now on my bedstand. The fork sleeps beside me like a tiny, silver guard dog. The ceiling fan calls me “Brother.”


I think they like me too much.


Last night, I heard the front door unlock itself.
And whisper to the others, “We should find him more things to love.”
